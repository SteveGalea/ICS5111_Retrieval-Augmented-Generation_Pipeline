{"summary": "we have previously reported that dendritic cells may be involved in the immune escape mechanisms for SARS-CoV. in this study, we focussed on the gene expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs), chemokine receptors (CCRs) and death receptor ligands in SARS-CoV infected DCs. evidences in the literature, including ours, support the role of immune evasion in the severity and immunopathology of SARS. we suggest that the developmental status of the host immune system may be responsible for the age-dependence of disease severity in SARS. some toll like receptors (TLRs) are expressed on the cell surface (TLR-1, TLR-2, TLR-4, TLR-5, TLR-6, TLR-10) while some are located within intracellular compartments (TLR-3, TLR-7, TLR-8, TLR-9) they are differentially expressed in different DC subsets and are modulated in response to a variety of stimuli. death receptors (DRs) play important roles in innate and adaptive immune responses. ligands include tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, FasL and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL/Apo2L) the basal levels of extracellular TLRs gene expressions in CB DCs were high and no significant upregulation was detected after infection with SARS-CoV. the expression of TLR-10 was 1 copy per 104 -actin genes. p = 0.003 p = 0.003 TLR-3 - - - - TLR-4 - p = 0.04 - - TLR-6 - - - - TLR-7 p = 0.04 - - - TLR-8 - - - TLR-9 - - - - CCR-1 - - - - CCR-5 - - - p = 0.02 - p = 0. mRNA concentrations in adult (a) and CB (b) immature DCs were assayed at 3 h and 9 h after infection with SARS-CoV. low but significant upregulation of TLR-7 was detected at 9 h after infection. expressions of these CCRs in adult and adult DCs were significantly higher than in adult DCs. mock infected cells were included as negative control. concentrations normalised to those of -actin mRNA in the corresponding sample. death receptor ligands, FasL and TRAIL, mRNA concentrations in adult (a) and CB (b) immature DCs were assayed at 3 h and 9 h after infection with SARS-CoV (MOI = 1). the concentrations were normalised to those of -actin mRNA in the corresponding sample. toll-like receptor (TLR)-1, TLR-2, TLR-4, TLR-5, TLR-6 and TLR-10 expressed on cell surface. their mRNA concentrations in adult (a) and CB (b) immature DCs were assayed at 3 h and 9 h after infection with SARS-CoV (MOI = 1). 0.005 CCR-3 - - - - CCR-5 - - - p = 0.02 p = 0.01 - p = 0.03 FasL - - - TRAIL - p = 0.005 - p = 0.01 **Adult DCs (n = 7) CB DCs (n = 5) TLR, toll-like receptor; CCR, chemokine receptor; FasL, Fas the concentrations were normalised to those of -actin mRNA in the corresponding sample. the basal levels of intracellular TLR-8 gene expression in CB DCs were very high and no significant upregulation was detected after infection. Mock infected cells were included as negative control. concentrations normalised to those of -actin mRNA in the corresponding sample. in both adult and CB DCs, significant upregulation of TRAIL gene expression was not detected. however, there was significant upregulation of TRAIL gene expression. the low level of TLR-10 was similar to that reported by Jarrossay et al. [10] and the low level of TLR-10 was similar to that reported by Kadowaki et al. [11]. Viruses may subvert the TLR response to evade the host defense by: (a) producting specific viral particles that block TLR function. the identification of such ligands may have therapeutic applications for the treatment of SARS. in a recent study on the control of coronavirus infection by plasmocytoid DCs, it was demonstrated that mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) induces Type I IFN response and the recognition of MHV is mediated by TLR7. mRNA expression in adult SARS-CoV infected DCs suggests a loop in facilitating the trafficking of DCs. further investigation is needed to determine which mechanism is involved in CCR-3 upregulation. the development of animal models for SARS has been difficult because relevant signs of clinical illness and death cannot be reproducible in most animal models. a recent study has shown that mice deficient in either CCR1, CCR2 or CCR5 showed more prominent airway epithelial cell apoptosis and more severe lung pathology. TRAIL expression in infected CB DCs was highest (5000 copies/104 actin genes) further investigation is needed to confirm the cytotoxic function of SARS-CoV infected DCs on immune cells. findings may explain white pulp atrophy in the spleen and lymphoid depletion in lymph nodes of SARS patients. Isolated CD14+ monocytes from the positive fraction were resuspended in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 50 IU/ml penicillin and 50 g/ml streptomycin. cell viability, as measured by trypan blue exclusion, was more than 95%. the purity of the isolated cells as measured by flow cytometry was consistantly between 90% to 95%. cells were inoculated by SARS-CoV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. virus allowed to be adsorbed for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. unbound virus was washed off by excess volume of PBS.
