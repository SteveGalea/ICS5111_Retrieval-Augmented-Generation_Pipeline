{"summary": "influenza B virus (IBV) and influenza B virus (IBV) both contain eight genomic segments. the vast genetic diversity of IAV is found in waterfowl, but only limited subtypes infect mammals. IBV and ICV are found principally in humans and rarely infect other species. virus isolation, genome sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis showed that D/OK and three bovine isolates were closely related and did not reassort with human ICV. in vitro reassortment experiments between D/OK and human ICV failed to identify viable reassortant viruses. a large sample set of BRDC cases were screened by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) to determine the molecular epidemiology of IDV in association with other bovine respiratory disease viral agents. clinical samples from bovine respiratory disease submissions to the Kansas State University Veterinary Diagnostic Lab were screened by a BRDC PCR panel. IDVs were isolated at Newport Laboratories from PCR-positive field samples. IDVs were previously isolated from swine exhibiting influenza-like symptoms (7). phylogenetic analysis was performed using the SegMan NGen module from DNAStar. hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay was used in the hemagglutination inhibition assay. all viruses were assayed in triplicate. sequences for the six IDVs isolated from clinical samples were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KM392468 to KM392509. clinical samples from bovine respiratory disease submissions were screened by a BRDC PCR panel which detects BVDV, BHV-1, BRSV, PI3 and bovine coronavirus. virus isolation was performed with IDV qRT-PCR-positive bovine samples using confluent monolayers of HRT-18G cells in DMEM without trypsin. growth was confirmed by qRT-PCR and a hemagglutination assay using 0.5% washed turkey red blood cells, as IDV is noncytopathic on HRT-18G cells. Rabbit polyclonal antisera generated using D/660 and D/OK were used in the HI assay. all viruses were assayed in triplicate. hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test was performed according to the WHO protocol. ten (4.8%) of the 208 samples submitted for BRDC diagnostic testing were positive for IDV by qRT-PCR, with threshold cycle (CT) values ranging from 21 to 29. other viruses associated with BRDC were detected by qRT-PCR. full-genome sequences were determined for the six IDVs isolated from clinical samples in cell culture. phylogenetic analysis of each segment was performed for 10 viruses, including nine bovine viruses. PB1 segment showed the highest homology among strains (>99.3% identity) a gray shading indicates segments clustering with D/OK. ND indicates lineage not determined due to high overall homology. HI assays performed using polyclonal antiserum generated against D/OK and D/660. hemagglutination inhibition titers were calculated by normalizing mean heterologous HI titers to mean homologous HI titers. the molecular structure of the HEF protein of D/3-13 (D/660 clade) was modeled to investigate the genetic basis for the cross-reactive mean HI titers observed with heterologous antiserum. 208 samples submitted for BRDC diagnostic testing were positive for IDV by qRT-PCR. threshold cycle (CT) values ranged from 21 to 29. other viruses associated with BRDC were detected by qRT-PCR. genome sequences were determined for the six genomic segments of IDVs isolated from clinical samples in cell culture. phylogenetic analysis of each segment was performed for 10 viruses, including nine bovine viruses (D/660, D/628, D/729, D/14-22, D/1-35, D/3-13, D/13-21, D/11-8, and D/9-5) HI assays were performed using polyclonal antiserum generated against D/OK and D/660 antisera. heterologous mean HI titers against D/OK and D/660 antisera were normalized to homologous D/660 and D/660 antisera. red bars represent relative mean HI titers to mean homologous HI titers. hemagglutination inhibition titers were calculated by normalizing mean heterologous HI titers to mean homologous HI titers (mean heterologous HI titer/mean homologous HI titer) IDV incidence was similar to that of other recognized BRDC pathogens. previous phylogenetic analyses found that IDV is most closely related to ICV; the highly conserved PB1 segment has 72% identity to the human reference strain (7). the divergent HEF segment has only 53% identity to this strain. IAV infects multiple species; however, the majority of the genetic diversity is found in its waterfowl reservoir. avian and nonavian viruses sporadically leads to antigenic shift, which can result in IAV epidemics and pandemics. the HI results and molecular model of the D/3-13 HEF suggested that amino acid 212 may play a role in IDV antigenicity. previous ICV studies have shown that changes in or around the variable region from positions 180 to 214 can result in the loss of recognition by antibodies and that K212 is directly involved in antibody recognition.
