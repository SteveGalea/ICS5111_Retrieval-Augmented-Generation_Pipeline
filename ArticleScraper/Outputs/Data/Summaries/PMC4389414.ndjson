{"summary": "in humans, CPS-CQ is strikingly more efficient than immunization with radiation attenuated sporozoites (RAS), raising the hypothesis that this might be partly due to CQ. the aim of this study was to investigate whether co-administration of CQ during sporozoite immunization improves cellular responses and protective efficacy. this study does not provide evidence for a direct beneficial effect of CQ on the induction of sporozoite-induced immune responses and protection in P. berghei malaria models. the higher efficiency of CPS compared to RAS might be explained by an indirect effect of CQ."}
