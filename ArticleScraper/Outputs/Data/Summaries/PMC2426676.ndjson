{"summary": "Background Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection can cause acute lower respiratory tract illness in infants, the immunocompromised, and the elderly. we deleted the M2-2 gene and evaluated replication of rhMPV/M2-2 virus in vitro and in vivo. hMPV has been assigned to the metapneumovirus genus of the pneumovirus subfamily within the paramyxovirus family. the genome contains 8 transcription units with at least 9 open reading frames (ORFs) that encode a nucleocapsid protein (N), a matrix protein (M), a phosphoprotein (P) that likely associate with the polymerase complex, a fusion glycoprotein (F), an attachment glycoprotein (G), a large rhMPV/M2-2 exhibited somewhat restricted replication in vero cells. the deletion resulted in higher levels of viral mRNA transcripts in tissue culture. previously unreported genetic instability was observed. rhMPV/M2-2 has deletion in the M2-2 gene adjacent to a SwaI site. modified nucleotides are underlined and the IG sequence is bold italics. rhMPV/M2-2 plaques were less than 50% the size of rhMPV plaques. the plaque size of rhMPV/M2-2 was markedly diminished compared to rhMPV. rhMPV/M2-2 is dispensable for replication in vero cells. rhMPV/M2-2 virus stocks had major subpopulations with inserted A nucleotides. subpopulations with inserted A's were also detected at nt5551 or nt5572 in SH that would result in premature translation termination in the SH ORF. rhMPV/M2-2RT-PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 plasmids. 14 of the 15 rhMPV/M2-2RT-PCR products had an inserted A nucleotide. no fragments containing A nucleotide insertions were detected in any of the 15 RT-PCR fragments spanning the identical region in P4 of rhMPV. 14 of 15 cloned RT-PCR products of rhMPV/M2-2 had an inserted A nucleotide at nt5060, nt5213 or nt5222 in the M2-1 gene. insertions of U, C or G were not observed in 15 cloned RT-PCR products derived from the identical region of rhMPV. total RNA was extracted from a passage 4 stock of rhMPV/M2-2. 1 kb RT-PCR products were inserted in pCR2.1 and 15 individual plasmids were sequenced. one sequence had an A inserted at nt4964 in the M2-1 gene. but no insertions of C or G were observed. a total of 23 poly A tracts and 2 poly U tracts with 4 or more contiguous A or U residues were among these sequences. the high frequency of A insertions was predominantly confined to the region encoding the non-essential genes M2-1 and SH. rhMPV/M2-2 and rhMPV/GFPpolyA viruses were smaller than rhMPV plaques. rhMPV/M2-2 and rhMPV/GFP plaques were both smaller than rhMPV plaques. yA as well as the control viruses rhMPV and rhMPV/M2-2 were harvested on day 4 for Western blot analysis. the levels of hMPV F as detected by Western blot were considered equivalent among the GFP-viruses. insertion of the GFP cassette was well tolerated by hMPV in vitro. cells were observed in monolayers infected with rhMPV/M2-2/GFPpolyA. expression of the gene indicated that the reading frame of the GFP gene had been restored in some virions. cell-to-cell spread within the focus of infection suggested that the restored GFP gene sequences were present in progeny virions. at least one insertion occurs out of approximately every 17 infections at 10 PFU/infection. the frequency of insertions was significantly elevated in the absence of M2-2. a well was scored as positive if GFP fluorescence was observed. rhMPV/M2-2/GFPpolyA replication suggests misincorporation of A nucleotides is not hMPV sequence-specific. we compared the amounts of rhMPV/M2-2 viral transcripts with that of rhMPV in vero cells. the size of the minor species is consistent with the monocistronic transcript. rhMPV/M2-2 infected cells were infected with rhMPV or rhMVP/M2-2. this increased level of read-through was unexpected since we had sought to preserve the native M2/SH noncoding sequences. the levels of transcripts in cells infected with rhMPV/M2-2 were several-fold higher compared to cells infected with rhMPV/M2-2. the up-regulation was maintained up to day 4 when peak titers were observed. however, the increased levels of viral transcripts produced by the rhMPV/M2-2 mutant were not accompanied by an increase in virus titer. no significant differences were observed between the amount of genomic RNA in cells infected with rhMPV/M2-2 and rhMPV. deletion of M2-2 altered the ratio between hMPV genomic RNA and mRNA. rhMVP/M2-2 is attenuated in hamsters. NT Lungs wt hMPV/NL/1/00 5.9 +/- 0.3 4.6 +/- 1.4 0.4 +/- 0.1 0.4 +/- 0.1 rhMPV 6.0 +/- 0.6 5.1 +/- 0.5 0.4 +/- 0.1 rhMPV/M2-2 2.3 +/- 0.6 3.3 +/- 0.4 0.4 +/- 0.1 placebo ND ND 5.6 +/- 0.6 replication of rhMPV/M2-2 was restricted in hamsters and animals were protected from challenge with wthMPV/NL/1/00. the deletion was designed to preserve the native ORF of M2-1. the first 21 amino acids of the putative M2-2 protein and the entire M2/SH non-coding region (NCR) were maintained. rhMPV/M2-2 plaques were less than 50% the size of rhMPV plaques. the peak titer of rhMPV/M2-2 was 7.22 +/- 0.16 log10 PFU/ml. rhMPV/M2-2 is dispensable for replication in vero cells. the immunostained plaques were treated with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole. the immunostained plaques were inoculated with rhMPV or rhMPV/M2-2 at MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell and incubated at 35\u00b0C. subpopulations with inserted A's were also detected at nt5551 or nt5572 in SH that would result in premature translation termination in the SH ORF. one population is the correct cloned sequence; the second has one inserted A nt (sense direction) at nt5222 in the M2-1 gene. nucleotide insertions were predominantly T (genomic antisense direction), with one A. the nt number of the last A in the poly A tract is used, though it is not known which A residue in the poly A tract is the inserted residue. RT-PCR products spanning nt4536 in F to nt5623 in SH were obtained from rhMPV/M2-2. 14 of 15 cloned RT-PCR products of rhMPV/M2-2 showed 79 transition mutations, 2 transversions, and 1 deletion. 7 of 15 cloned RT-PCR products of rhMPV/M2-2 showed a total of 17 transitions, 2 transversions, and 1 deletion. there is a high frequency of U insertions in the genomic RNA. this region contains 14 poly A tracts and 3 poly U tracts with 4 or more contiguous A or U residues. this region contains 14 poly A tracts and 3 poly U tracts with 4 or more contiguous A or U residues. an assay was developed to detect insertions by designing a GFP ORF with an 11-nt sequence, CGA6TTA. this resulted in a frame shift in the downstream reading frame and a premature translational stop codon at the 6th GFP codon. the modified GFP ORF is labeled GFPpolyA (Figure 1D). Western blots indicated F expression was comparable between viruses. fluorescence was robustly detected in viruses that contained native GFP ORFs. fluorescence was robustly detected in viruses that contained native GFP ORFs. in vitro and insertion of the CGA6TTA sequences in the N terminus of the GFP ORF effectively silenced GFP expression. in vitro, vero cells were inoculated with rhMPV/GFP, rhMPV/GFPpolyA or one of the control viruses rhMPV/GFP, rhMPV/GFPpolyA or rhMPV/M2-2/GFP, at MOI of 0.1 no GFP-expressing foci were observed in wells inoculated with either 100 or 1000 PFU/well of rhMPV/M2-2/GFPpolyA. fluorescence was observed in 25 out of 384 wells (6%) inoculated with 10 PFU/well of rhMPV/M2-2/GFPpolyA. a well was scored as positive if GFP fluorescence was observed 4 days p.i. rhMPV/M2-2 transcripts were compared with rhMPV in vero cells. each of the 24 viruses retained GFP expression. RNA was extracted from vero cells inoculated with rhMPV or rhMPV/M2-2 at an MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell. the size of the minor species is consistent with the monocistronic transcript while the size of the major species coincided with the predicted size of the M2/SH read-through product. RNA was extracted on 1% agarose gel in the presence of 0.44 M formaldehyde gel, transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled anti-sense riboprobes. RNA in a duplicate gel was visualized with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV light. rhMPV/M2-2 had higher levels of transcripts but equivalent or lower titers compared to rhMPV. the levels of rhMPV/M2-2 transcripts peaked at day 3 (lanes 1, 3, 5 and 7 in Figure 5) rhMPV/M2-2 transcripts peaked at day 3 (lanes 1, 3, 5 and 7 in Figure 5) titers of wthMPV/NL/1/00 and rhMPV in nasal turbinates and lungs were comparable. however, the titers of rhMPV/M2-2 were 3.7 log10 PFU/gm lower in the URT and 1.8 log10 PFU/gm lower in the LRT, relative to rhMPV titers. c 28 days posit immunization, 4 animals per group were challenged with 106 PFU/animal of wt hMPV/NL/1/00. 4 days post challenge, the animals were sacrificed. sequence analyses were performed on P4 stocks of rhMPV/M2-2. these analyses revealed major subpopulations (as high as 50%) that contained insertions of A nucleotides (sense direction) in the M2-1 and SH ORFs. these insertions appeared predominantly in A tracts and were also readily detected in an A tract introduced in the GFP ORF. deletion of the hMPV M2-2 gene resulted in up-regulation of viral transcription. the levels of rhMPV transcripts peaked at day 3 p.i., while levels of rhMPV/M2-2 transcripts remained high through day 4 p.i. is consistent with a higher level of viral transcripts in rhMPV/M2-2 infected cells. the genes immediately upstream and downstream of the M2 and SH transcription units also existed predominantly as monocistronic transcripts. the frequency of readthrough transcription at the M2 gene stop sequences appeared to be accentuated by the removal of the M2-2 ORF. however, the increased frequency of readthrough at this gene junction may perturb the expression of downstream genes such as SH, G and L. rM2-2CAN97-83 had a deletion of 152 nt in the M2-2 ORF. our construct had a deletion of 142 nt and a SwaI site introduced adjacent to the polyA tract of the M2 gene stop sequences. mutations do develop in SH, G, L and non-coding regions (NCR) more studies are needed to gain detailed knowledge of the hMPV polymerase complex and the role of M2-2 during hMPV replication. ablation of the M2-2 ORF also resulted in up-regulation of viral transcription but not genomic RNA. aberrant transcription regulation and increased genetic instability could contribute to the attenuation phenotype rhMPV/M2-2. recombinant virus rhMPV/NL/1/00/E93K/S101P was constructed as previously described. rhMPV/M2-2, rhMPV/GFP, rhMPV/GFPpolyA, and rhMPV/M2-2/GFP were recombinant. the first SwaI site was positioned at nt5326, downstream of the native stop codon of M2-2. the second site was positioned at nt5468, upstream of the native stop codon of M2-2, and was generated using the primer 5' CATAGAAATTATATATGTCAAGTTTAAATTTAAATTAG and its complement. the second site was positioned at nt5468, upstream of the native stop codon of M2-2. StuI (nt4495) to ClaI (nt8693) fragment containing M2, GFP, SH and G genes was isolated from the hMPV SphI/ClaI subclone. an 11 nt poly A insert was cloned into the NheI-N/P-GFP-NheI cassette. the cassette was ligated into the hMPV SphI/Cla I subclone at the Nhe I site the cassette was inserted at nt5316 to generate rhMPV/M2-2/GFP or rhMPV/M2-2/GFPpolyA respectively. recombinant viruses were generated from cDNA as described previously [27]. cells and supernatant from the transfection were harvested together. Plaques were immunostained with ferret polyclonal antisera directed to hMPV diluted 1:500 in PBS containing 5% powdered milk (w/v) cells were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-ferret antibody (Dako) diluted 1:1000, followed by incubation with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) to visualize plaques. the nasal turbinates and lungs were harvested from 4 animals per group. on day 28 post infection, immunized hamsters were challenged with 106 PFU/animal of wthMPV/NL/1/00. RT-PCR of recovered viruses was generated using a one-step Ultrasense RT-PCR kit. RNA was separated on 1% agarose gel in the presence of 0.44 M formaldehyde. it was transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) the hybridized bands were visualized using a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche) 100 Units/ml penicillin G sodium with 100 ug/ml streptomycin sulfate. recombinant virus rhMPV/NL/1/00/E93K/S101P has been described. cDNA for rhMPV/NL/1/00/E93K/S101P was constructed as previously described [17]. to generate rhMPV/M2-2 cDNA, two Swa I restriction sites were introduced into the SphI/ClaI subclone, which contained the SphI (nt 100) to Cla I (nt8678) fragment derived from rhMPV/NL/1/00/E93K/S101P. a StuI (nt4495) to ClaI (nt8693) fragment was isolated from the hMPV SphI/ClaI subclone and inserted into the full-length cDNA to form rhMPV/GFP. a StuI (nt4495) to ClaI (nt8693) fragment was isolated from the hMPV SphI/ClaI subclone. to ClaI fragment of the hMPV SphI/Cla I subclone was inserted into the full-length cDNA to generate rhMPV/GFPpolyA. an Nhe I site was introduced into the SwaIM2-2 subclone at nt5316. the stop codon of M2-1 is in bold and the Nhe I site is underlined. hMPV Plaque Assay Virus titers were determined by plaque assay. monolayers of Vero cells in TC6-well plates were inoculated with 10-fold serial dilution of virus. after 1 hour adsorption, monolayer was overlaid with optiMEM diluted 1:1 with 2% methylcellulose. the virus inoculum was replaced with 2 ml optiMEM. Combined cells and supernatant were collected at 24 hr intervals for 4 or 6 days. rhMPV, rhMPV/M2-2, and wthMPV/NL/1/00 were infected intranasally. RT was deactivated by treatment of the product at 94\u00b0C for 15 minutes. phenol/chloroform extraction was performed on the RT product. RNA was separated on 1% agarose gel in the presence of 0.44 M formaldehyde. the authors are employed at MedImmune, Inc."}
