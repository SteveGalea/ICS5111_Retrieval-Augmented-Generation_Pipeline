{"summary": "papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) is a high-risk DNA tumour virus. it is a major causative agent of cervical cancer. cellular transformation is associated with deregulated expression of the E6 and E7 oncogenes. in this study, RNA aptamers were employed as molecular tools. human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are DNA tumour viruses that infect keratinocytes in epithelia. more than 100 types have been identified [1], [2] and are classified as low-risk or high-risk, depending on the associated risk of cancer development. nucleic acid aptamers are single-stranded oligonucleotides. peptide aptamers are composed of a variable peptide loop attached to a protein scaffold. they are non-immunogenic and can be synthesised to very high purity. aptamer A2 was selected as one of the highest affinity binders. the sequence and predicted secondary structures of A2 are shown in Figure S1. this molecule inhibits cellular proliferation via induction of apoptosis in an HPV16-transformed cervical carcinoma cell line. cells were transfected with up to 100 nM A2 and analysed after 24 hours. no significant changes in cell viability were measured after 24 hours. siHa cells transfected with A2 had reduced cell viability after 48 hours. cells were allowed to adhere to microelectrode-coated 96-well plates for 18 hours prior to transfection with either A2 or an aptamer selected to an unrelated protein as a negative control. this aptamer contains the same primer sequences as A2 and only differs in the N30 random region. the predicted lowest energy structures of both A2 and SF1 are shown in Figure S1. apoptosis assays were performed in which SiHa cells were transfected with increasing concentrations of aptamer (up to 200 nM) apoptosis assays were performed in which siHa cells were transfected with increasing concentrations of aptamer (up to 200 nM) apoptosis assays were performed in which siHa cells were transfected with increasing concentrations of aptamer (up to 200 nM FITC-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide to identify apoptotic cells. a small increase in apoptosis was induced in cells transfected with control aptamer SF1, 9.251.9% and 11.22.0% at 100 nM and 200 nM, respectively. however, the level of apoptosis in cells transfected with A2 was greater. the innate immune response in HeLa cells has been shown to be much reduced compared to C33A cells. if the results were due exclusively to innate immunity, we would have expected a greater effect in C33A than in HeLa cells. A2 Binds at the N-terminus of HPV16 E7 E7 has three conserved regions. binding of E7 to p300 involves residue 2 in CR1 as well as residue 24 in the LXCXE motif. binding of TBP requires residues in the zinc-binding domain of CR3 [46] aptamer A2 was probed for binding to wild-type (WT) GST-E7, GST-E7-2, GST-E7-4, GST-E7 H2P and GST-E7 C24G. aptamer A2 could disrupt interactions between pRb and pRb. the amount of pRb precipitated by GST-E7 was reduced. GST alone did not interact with pRb in either the absence or presence of A2. this data confirm that A2 is able to disrupt the E7-pRb interaction in vitro. the high level of E7 expression in caSki cells meant that it was not possible to deliver sufficient aptamer in order to detect statistically significant levels of apoptosis. the level was sufficient for detection by immunoblotting and thus allowed the effect of aptamer to be determined. the experiment therefore allows quantification of levels of E7 and pRb in two ways. transfected cells were transfected with aptamer, incubated for 24 hours. level of E7 was significantly higher than in cells transfected with A2. pRb levels were elevated during the 24 hour incubation with aptamer. CaSki cells were mock-transfected or transfected with either 100 nM A2 or SF1 (control aptamer) and incubated for 24 hours before lysis and co-immunoprecipitation with 2 g of either anti-pRb or anti-E7. immunoblot analysis was then performed to detect E7, pRb or GAPDH. aptamer A2 binds to GST-E7 in vitro. cells are derived from a human cervical carcinoma. no significant changes in cell viability were measured after 24 hours. cells were transfected with 25, 50 or 100 nM of either A2 (panels C and D) or control aptamer SF1 (panels E and F) and incubated in serum-free media for 4 hours. cells analysed by the Roche xCELLigence system for a further 48 hours. both siHa and HaCaT cells mock-transfected with lipofection reagent alone continued to proliferate over time. however, the proliferation rate fell rapidly when cells were treated with staurosporine as an inducer of apoptosis. the subsequent small rise in cell index observed with SiHa cells with aptamer A2 caused the cell index to decrease over time. the changes in cell index measured by RT-CES were greater than the changes in viability measured by MTT assay. this could reflect insensitivity of the latter, or that the real-time cell sensing assay may over-estimate reductions in cell growth because of changes in cell morphology. both SF1 and A2 have a small effect on the level of apoptosis measured in both HeLa and C33A cells. if the results were due exclusively to innate immunity, we would have expected to see a greater effect in C33A than in HeLa cells. cells were either mock-transfected, treated with staurosporine at 0.5 M or transfected with either A2 or control aptamer SF1. Graphs show total % apoptosis and standard errors of at least three separate experiments. binding of A2 to E7 was moderately affected by small deletions in the zinc-binding domain. however, binding was abrogated by point mutations at residues 2 or within the LXCXE motif at position 24. the changes seen in A2-E7 binding as a result of point mutations. haCaT cell lysate (lane 1) was incubated with GST-E7 (54 M) immobilised onto GM-beads. in the absence of A2 (lane 2), pRb was precipitated by GST-E7. GST alone did not interact with pRb in either the absence or presence of A2 (lanes 6 and 7 respectively) 100 nM A2 or SF1 was transfected into caSki cells, a cervical cancer cell line containing several hundred copies of the HPV16 genome. the high level of E7 expression in CaSki cells meant that it was not possible to deliver sufficient aptamer in order to detect statistically significant levels of apoptosis. the level of co-immunoprecipitation of E7 by anti-pRb was reduced by 80%. this is mirrored by the reduction of the input level of E7 in cells transfected with A2 for 24 hours. in cells transfected with aptamer SF1 the level of E7 was significantly higher than in cells transfected with A2 (lane 2). SF1-transfected cells were mock-transfected or transfected with either 100 nM A2 or SF1 (control aptamer) and incubated for 24 hours before lysis and co-immunoprecipitation with 2 g of either pRb or anti-E7. Graph shows the results and standard errors of 4 separate experiments. pRb levels shown as % mock. p0.05, **p0.01. E7 proteins from high-risk HPVs have a high degree of intrinsic protein disorder. this flexibility may contribute to its ability to bind to a variety of proteins. it is possible that A2-mediated inhibition of the critical E7-pRb interaction could result in instability and degradation, thus allowing restoration of pRb levels. the use of siRNA molecules is to interfere with protein synthesis at the translational level. we have demonstrated little effect of A2 in three HPV16-negative cell lines. a separate study has identified further RNA aptamers to HPV16 E7. ise other E7 aptamers from the selected pool [14] and aptamers to HPV16 E6, as targeting both oncoproteins is likely to have an additive effect. studies are also on-going to further investigate the pathway of E7 loss, the specificity of the aptamers and aptamer delivery into primary cells. sequences of the N30 regions were CCCUUCAUCAUUAACCCGUCCACGCGC and UCGGCUCAAAAAUACACCAUACA respectively. cell proliferation assays Measurement of cell viability was undertaken using the MTT assay. cells were seeded at 104 per well of a 96-well plate and incubated for 24 hours prior to transfection.
