{"summary": "induction and over-production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines is a common phenomenon in many viral infections [1]\u2013[6]. however, expression of these genes was differentially up-regulated at the transcriptional and translational levels in cells infected with a certain virus. however, only a moderate increase of the expression of these genes at the protein level was detected [8]\u2013[9]. genome-length mRNA1 encodes two replicase proteins in form of polyproteins 1a and 1a/b. the four major structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), are encoded by different subgenomic mRNAs. in coronavirus-infected cells, no obvious inhibition of host protein synthesis was observed at least at early stages of the virus infection cycle. eIF3 plays an important role during translation initiation by bridging the 43S preinitiation complex to mRNA via the cap binding complex eIF4F. eIF3f could interact with the S protein from two coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus. cells were cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum (Sterile) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and maintained at 37\u00b0C in humidified 5% CO2. pGBKT7-SC was used as bait to screen a cDNA library prepared from HeLa cells. the total cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes. the first antibody was added to the supernatants. the beads were washed 5 times with the lysis buffer before subjected to SDS-PAGE. in vitro translation of luciferase RNA was preformed using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) the in vitro transcribed RNA was precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in RNase-free water. in vitro translation was performed in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. cells were transfected with 1.2 g of empty vector pKT0, 1 g pKT0/S+0.2 g pLUC, and 1 g pKT0+0.2 g pLUC. at 24 hours post-transfection, cells were lysed using the passive cell lysis buffer provided by Promega. Plasmid pIBV-SC was created by cloning a SmaI/HindIII digested pGAD-3f into EcoRI/XhoI digested pGEX-5X1. all constructs were confirmed by automated nucleotide sequencing. 100 g of cDNA library DNA was sequentially transformed into the pGBKT7-SC-transformants. the cells were plated on minimal selective synthetic dropout (SD) media SD/-Leu/-Trp/-His plate. positive colonies were selected by dotting colonies onto SD plates. induction with 0.4 mM IPTG at 37\u00b0C for 3 hours. gradients allowed to stand for 3 to 5 hours at 4\u00b0C before layering 0.2-ml sample onto a gradient. transient expression of viral protein in mammalian cells using a vaccinia virus/T7 system. semiconfluent monolayers of HeLa cells were infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus. plasmid DNA was transfected into vTF7-3-infected cells using effectene transfection kit. Plasmid pGBKT7-SC was constructed by cloning an EcoRI/BamHI digested PCR fragment into EcoRI/BamHI digested pGBKT7 (Clontech) the PCR fragment was generated with full-length SARS-CoV S gene using primers (5\u2032-CGGAATTCCTTGACCGGTGCACC ACTT-3\u2032) induction of many virus-inducible genes occurred at the transcriptional level. however, induction of the same genes at the translational level was found to be usually minimal to moderate. eIF3f expressed either on its own or together with the Myc-tagged SC. Western blot analysis of the same precipitates with anti-Myc antibody showed presence of the Myc-tagged SC only in cells co-expressing the two proteins. immunofluorescent staining of HeLa cells expressing eIF3f (panel A), SARS-CoV S protein (panel B) or co-expressing eIF3f and S (panels C, D and E) the subcellular localization of the proteins was examined at 12 hours post-transfection by dual labelling with a mixture of anti-S and anti-Flag antibodies. Western blot analysis of the same precipitates with anti-Flag antibody showed presence of the flag-tagged eIF3f only in cells co-expressing the two proteins. this interaction was further investigated in cells co-expressing the two proteins by immunofluorescent staining. the protein was located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus with predominant nuclear localization in some cells. GST-eIF3f was mixed with the purified GST alone. both proteins were detected in fractions 11\u201314. these results substantiate the conclusion that SC could interact with eIF3f. in vitro transcribed luciferase mRNA (0.5 g) was translated in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in presence of [35S] methionine. in vitro transcribed luciferase mRNA (lane 1) was translated in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [35S] methionine. luciferase gene expression was analyzed by Western blot with anti-luciferase and anti-S antibodies. the same membrane was also probed with anti-actin antibodies as a loading control. addition of equal amount of the purified GST-eIF3f fusion protein substantially relieved the inhibitory effect. luciferase activity is 37-fold higher in cells transfected with Luc+empty vector. approximately equal amounts of luciferase mRNA were detected in cells transfected with luciferase together either with an empty vector or the S construct. interaction of IBV S protein with eIF3f and inhibition of the translation of a reporter gene Co-immunoprecipitation was performed. HeLa cells expressing the Flag-tagged eIF3f (lane 1), the Myc-tagged IBV SC (lane 2) and eIF3f+IBV S (lane 3) were harvested at 24 hours post-transfection and lysed. the total cell lysates were either detected directly by Western blot with anti-Flag antibodies or immunoprecipitated with anti-IBV S antibodies. ase+IBV S and luciferase+SARS-CoV S were harvested at 24 hours post-transfection and lysed. the total cell lysates were either detected directly by Western blot with anti-IBV S (top panel), anti-IBV N (third panel) and anti-actin (bottom panel) antibodies. luciferase activity in the total cell lysates was measured. Western blot analysis of the same precipitates with anti-flag antibody detected the Myc-tagged SC only in cells co-expressing the two proteins. this results confirm that the N-terminal portion of the IBV S protein can also interact with eIF3f. fusion-competent S protein (IBV S(p65)) cloned from a vero cell-adapted IBV passage 65 (p65) and fusion-incompetent S protein (IBV S(EP3) cloned from chicken embryo passage 3 (EP3) was carried out to support that interaction between S protein and eIF3.5 leads to inhibition of protein translation. in cells transfected with IBV S(p65), expression of the S protein would be inhibite at 8 hours post-infection, approximately equal amounts of S protein were detected in cells expressing both constructs. much more S protein was detected in cells expressing S(p65) than in cells expressing S(EP3) at 10 and 12 hours post-infection. luciferase gene was fused to the C-terminus of the S(EP3)-luciferase and S(p65)-luciferase constructs. a furin cleavage site was placed between the S and luciferase sequences. a stable cell line expressing the Flag-tagged eIF3f was then established from vero cells. RNA at 0, 8 12, 16 and 24 hours post-infection showed the presence of very similar amounts of viral RNAs in both cell clones. however, significantly less S protein was detected in cells without expressing the Flag-tagged eIF3f. ten micrograms of total RNA extracted from one portion of the harvested infected cells were separated on 1.3% agarose gel. bands corresponding to the genomic and subgenomic mRNA are indicated by numbers 1\u20136 on the right. the same membrane was also probed with a Dig-labeled GAPDH probe as loading control. Western blot analysis of IL-8 at the translational level showed detection of IL-8 in both cell clones. more induction of IL-8 protein expression was detected in cells expressing the Flag-tagged eIF3f at earlier time points. stable expression of the Flag-tagged eIF3f could offset the inhibitory effect of S protein on the translation of virus-inducible genes. drastically increased detection (5-fold) of IL-6 in cells expressing flag-tagged eIF3f was detected. eIF3f Virus infection activates transcription and translation of many host genes. Western blot analysis of the same precipitates with anti-Myc antibody detected the Flag-tagged eIF3f expressed either on its own or together with the Myc-tagged SC. the same cell lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody. total lysates were either detected directly by Western blot with anti-S antibodies or immunoprecipitated with anti-S antibodies. subcellular localization of eIF3f and SARS-CoV S protein was examined at 12 hours post-transfection. lag monoclonal antibody showed presence of the flag-tagged eIF3f. Western blot analysis of the same precipitates with anti-Flag antibody showed presence of the flag-tagged eIF3f only in cells co-expressing the two proteins. this interaction was further investigated in cells co-expressing the two proteins. the purified proteins GST-SC either on its own or mixed with an equal amount of GST-eIF3f were subjected to ultracentrifugation through 15\u201350% sucrose gradients. when GST-eIF3f was mixed with the purified GST alone, it was mainly detected in fractions 4\u20136 (Fig. 2, second panel). these results substantiate the conclusion that SC could interact with eIF3f and further demonstrate that the two proteins could form stable complexes in vitr complete inhibition of the luciferase expression was achieved when 600 nM of purified GST-SC protein was added to the system (lanes 2\u20138) luciferase expression was achieved when 300 and 600 nM of purified GST-SC protein was used. luciferase mRNA was translated in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in presence of [35S] methionine. luciferase gene expression was analyzed by Western blot with anti-luciferase and anti-actin antibodies. the same membrane was also probed with anti-actin antibodies as a loading control. addition of the same amount of the purified GST-eIF3f fusion protein substantially relieved the inhibitory effect. expression of S protein could substantially inhibit the luciferase expression. empty vector alone did not cause any inhibition. luciferase activity is 37-fold higher in cells transfected with Luc+empty vector. Western blot analysis of the same precipitates with anti-Flag antibody led to the detection of the flag-tagged eIF3f only in cells co-expressing the two proteins. this results confirm that the full-length IBV S protein could also interact with eIF3f. precipitates were analyzed by Western blot with anti-Flag or anti-Myc antibodies. luciferase activity by IBV and SARS-CoV S protein was inhibited. total cell lysates were either detected directly by Western blot. Western blot analysis of the same precipitates with anti-Myc antibody detected the Flag-tagged eIF3f. luciferase activity in cells co-transfected with either IBV or SARS CoV S protein showed that the luciferase activity was drastically reduced. Western blot analysis of the same precipitates with anti-IBV N antibodies, however, did not detect the N protein. results confirm that IBV S could indeed interact with the endogenous eIF3f protein in virus-infected cells. syncytial cells were observed on almost the whole monolayer at 10 to 12 hours post-infection. Western blot analysis showed slightly more S protein was observed in cells expressing S(EP3) construct at 6 hours post-infected compared to cells expressing S(p65) construct at 8 hours post-infection. the viral protein expression was analyzed by Western blot with rabbit anti-IBV S antibodies. the same membrane was also probed with anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody as a loading control. one stable cell line with high expression and one with undetectable expression of the Flag-eIF3f were chosen for the study. the two cell clones were infected with IBV in a time-course experiment. analysis of viral RNA at 0, 8 12, 16 and 24 hours post-infection showed the presence of very similar amounts of viral RNAs in both cell clones. the two stable Vero cell clones were infected with IBV at a multiplicity of infection of 2 and harvested at 0, 8, 12, 16 and 24 hours post-infection. ten micrograms of total RNA extracted from one portion of the harvested infected cells were separated on 1.3% agarose gel. the same membrane was also probed with a Dig-labeled GAPDH probe as loading control. Western blot analysis of the total cell lysates with anti-actin antibodies was included as a loading control. analysis of IL-8 at the transcriptional level showed induction of IL-8 mRNA in both cell clones infected with IBV. in cells without expressing the Flag-tagged eIF-3f was observed at 16 hour post-infection. increased detection (5-fold) of IL-6 in the supernatants was detected. cytokines and chemokines could promote inflammation by induction of acute cell and tissue injury. the IL-6 mRNA was significantly up-regulated in SARS-CoV-infected dendritic cells. however, only slight increase of IL-6 at the protein level was detected in the serum of SARS patients. the inhibitory effect appears to be general, as the synthesis of viral and cellular proteins can be affected. infection of cells stably expressing flag-tagged eIF3f with IBV showed reduced virus production compared with cells without expression of the protein. it supports that inhibition of the translation of virus-induced transcripts is beneficial to the virus. however, there is no evidence to support this speculation at present. multiple N-terminally truncated forms of the S protein can be detected in cells either infected with SARS-CoV and IBV or transfected with S protein constructs from both viruses. cell-cell fusion can be induced in cells either infected with most coronaviruses or transfected with the S protein construct. fusion of neighboring cells would provide additional fresh eIF3f, which in turn enhances the expression of virus-induced transcripts pre-exist"}
