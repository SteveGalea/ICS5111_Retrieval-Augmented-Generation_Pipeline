{"summary": "the emergence of novel diseases in the 1970s and 1980s led to infectious disease rising back up the health policy and political agendas. authors had begun to review similarities between these diseases and identify patterns in their origins and emergence. by the end of the 1990s, the study of EIDs was a staple of most schools of public health. emerging diseases were identified in a series of well-reported die-offs in wildlife. pathogens were also implicated for the first time in species extinctions, or near-extinctions, e.g. canine distemper in the black-footed ferret, chytridiomycosis in the sharp-snouted day frog. the first definitive identification of disease as a cause of species extinction was published in 1996 following the demise of the last population of the polynesian tree snail. this added to evidence that infectious agents had caused the extinction in the wild of the black-footed ferret, the extinction of around one-third of Hawaiian honeycreepers and the slime mould-induced decline of eelgrass. a series of papers disputing the role of chytridiomycosis in amphibian declines ensued. long-term datasets have since been published which provide convincing evidence that amphibian chytridiomycosis alone can cause mass mortalities leading to population declines. the first international policy measure to control amphibian chytridiomycosis has been slow to be enacted. the significance of infectious disease as a cause of historical extinctions is likely underestimated due to a previous relative lack of infectious disease focus and diagnostic capability. the authors reiterate the widely proposed hypothesis that most emerging pathogens originate in wildlife and spillover into human hosts due to a range of ecological, demographic and socio-economic changes. some authors propose that bats harbour a disproportionate number of emerging zoonoses compared with other mammalian groups. the anthropogenic spread of pathogens has been responsible for the emergence of a series of high-profile wildlife EIDs. the global pandemic lineage of B. dendrobatidis arose from a single hybrid origin via an ancestral meiosis. a body of literature has developed the concept of the ecosystem service of disease regulation. it proposes that natural biodiversity limits the exposure and impact of many pathogens, including those that are zoonotic, through a dilution or buffering effect. if biodiversity is depleted, this ecosystem service is impaired and zoonotic pathogens are more likely to emerge. the WTO agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measures was enacted on 1 January 1995 to protect human, animal and plant life from disease-causing agents. only two pathogens are listed for this purpose: B. dendrobatidis and Ranavirus [42] most countries use import controls to only protect against domestic animal diseases of obvious public health or economic importance. it is often difficult, time-consuming, logistically challenging and very expensive to identify the origins of newly emerged pathogens of humans. despite indications that bats are the natural reservoir hosts of these viruses, clear evidence has only been found for Marburg virus infection in bats in limited locations [88\u201390]. endmic zoonoses from wildlife EID events have been the focus of intense research over the past two decades. this disproportionate focus on EIDs probably relates to the dislike of human society for uncertainty, or put more simply, fear of the unknown. this may lead to perverse scenarios in which fear of disease can have greater impact than the direct impact of the outbreak itself. the review by Daszak et al. was perhaps the first \u2018One Health\u2019 review of emerging diseases. it brought together veterinary, ecological, conservation and human medical perspectives. the field of One Health has expanded substantially since 2000. rabies in humans transmitted through dog bites kills around 60 000 people annually. the disease is easily preventable (and arguably open to eradication) through repeated annual or biannual mass vaccination of dogs. rabies in humans kills around 60 000 people annually. the cost implications of zoonotic EIDs were highlighted by Daszak et al. [17] as a rationale for policy measures. but methods for calculating the economic consequences of disease emergence have not advanced in the interim. estimates of the cost of the 2003 SARS outbreak range from $5 to $50 billion. a revision of an earlier analysis of global drivers of disease emergence shows that land-use change correlates strongly with the emergence of zoonoses from wildlife. a series of laboratories now specialize in identifying novel pathogens of zoonotic potential before they emerge may increase our capacity to reduce their risk of emergence. both EIDs and endemic zoonoses can be tackled using a One Health approach. this includes the identification and mitigation of human activities that lead to disease emergence and spread. endemic zoonoses are not seen as a threat to the developed world. a.A.C. was supported by a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit award.
