{"summary": "the intracellular parasite is responsible for the majority of the world's malaria morbidity and mortality burden in humans. to date, the parasite has developed resistance to all major antimalarial drugs. the development of new technologies aimed at understanding parasite genome variability provides hope in identifying new drug targets. Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) has been successfully used to look at structural variation and CNV in multiple P. falciparum strains. large-scale sequencing efforts identifying SNPs have spurred the development of SNP microarrays. the microarray contains blocks of probesets for SNP genotyping and CGH. samples from one quartet typically have hybridization signals in a similar dynamic range. these signals are used to determine base calling robustness. a one-way ANOVA indicates significant differences between mean Dscore at various probe lengths (P 0.0001) out of the nine tested probe lengths, 39-mer probes generated the lowest mean Dscore with the best discrimination ability ( = 0.3575) a one-way ANOVA analysis indicates probe melting temperature Dscore are significantly different from one another (P 0.0001) the CNV-SNP array genotypes 1,507 of the 1,631 publicly available Broad Institute SNPs and 2,621 of the 2,743 publicly available NIH SNPs. the accuracy of all SNPs assayed on the CNV-SNP array maintain >95% accuracy at all Dscore cutoffs with 97.1% accuracy. microarray accuracy rate was calculated by comparing microarray base calls with sequence data for five parasite genomes. at more stringent discrimination scores, accuracy rate increased. features, including a 500 bp CNV event, were recognized and consistent between hybridizations with this microarray platform. however, it becomes more difficult to confidently detect small CNV events algorithmically. degraded samples can not be recovered for effective CGH by WGA. ng of starting DNA for 3D7, HB3 and Dd2 were quantified and hybridized on the microarray. no base calling or CNV detection differences were seen between the different starting amounts. the manufacturer-recommended starting amount is 1,000 ng to produce at least 10 g of labeled product. the amount of human DNA present in each sample was quantified. the amount of human DNA present in each sample was quantified. 33 to 92% of the total DNA was found to be human. all probe lengths except 39- and 41-mers have a significantly different mean Dscore (P 0.05) the lowest mean Dscore with the best discrimination ability for probe melting temperatures was generated at 66\u00b0C from the range of 42 to 82\u00b0C ( = 0.2647) the CNV-SNP array genotypes 1,507 of the 1,631 publicly available Broad Institute SNPs and 2,621 of the 2,743 publicly available NIH SNPs. the accuracy of all SNPs assayed on the CNV-SNP array maintain >95% accuracy at all Dscore cutoffs with 97.1% accuracy. data for five parasite genomes demonstrate greater performance than average if those SNPs are more amenable to hybridization-based interrogation. b) Mean number of base calls produced at various Dscore cutoffs for all SNP loci. features, including a 500 bp CNV event, were recognized and consistent between hybridizations. the amplification process introduces noise, confounding CNV detection by any platform. degraded samples can not be recovered for effective CGH by WGA. more than 10 g of labeled DNA was obtained from all labeling reactions. no base calling or CNV detection differences were seen between the different starting amounts. manufacturer-recommended starting amount is 1,000 ng of DNA to produce at least 10 g of labeled product. the amount of human DNA present in each sample was quantified. the amount of human DNA present in each sample was quantified. 33 to 92% of the total DNA was found to be human. Sense and antisense resequencing probe quartets were used for SNP genotyping on the CNV-SNP array. a SNP call required that sense and antisense probe quartets made complementary calls. signal intensities within SNP probe quartets were more similar to each other than to probes in other probe quartets. longer, isothermal probes increase signal strength while also being short enough to remain sensitive to single base mismatches. some loci are more easily genotyped than others, and some remain inaccessible to microarrays and short-read sequencing technologies. current SNP genotyping microarrays are focused on high quality SNP loci that are easily genotyped across microarray platforms. microarray platform continues to improve in density and offers unique configurations up to 12-plex of 135K probes. microarrays remain cheaper, produce data more quickly, require less computational innovation. technology still lag behind the performance of microarray CGH. a NimbleGen resequencing probeset is composed of eight probes per SNP locus. each probe quartet is identical except for the central nucleotide. common SNPs (SNPs identified in at least two parasite isolates) were blasted against the 3D7 genome. some SNPs represented by a single isolate were included in the microarray. a total of 45,524 SNP loci queried by 364,192 probes balanced to 66\u00b0C melting temperature were included on the array. samples were considered multiple clone infections if one or more of the seven microsatellite loci showed multiple alleles. only unique genotypes were included in the study. Thailand-Burma samples with an inadequate amount of DNA were whole genome amplified. denatured sample was quick chilled on ice and incubated with 50 units of Klenow fragment. labeled product was resuspended in water, and 10 g of test and reference samples combined. hybridizations included 1 Denhardt's solution (Sigma Aldrich) in the hybridization buffer. microarray data analysis SNP analysis Data for 3D7, HB3, Dd2, SC05, and 7C126 were extracted from scanned images and resequencing base reports generated using NimbleScan v2.5. the discrimination score (Dscore) for each probe quartet was calculated as a background corrected ratio of the signal from the second greatest intensity probe. data for HB3 and Dd2 hybridized against 3D7 were extracted from scanned images and normalized using NimbleScan v2.5. a NimbleGen resequencing probeset is composed of eight probes per SNP locus. each probe quartet is identical except for the central nucleotide that assays the nucleotide variant. each plex in our 3-plex 720K NimbleGen microarray contains resequencing probes for SNP genotyping and CGH probes for CNV detection. samples were synthesized using maskless photolithography. of 101,581 candidate SNP loci downloaded from PlasmoDB and BLASTed for uniqueness, probesets for all SNP loci reported in at least two parasites lines were included in the microarray. each probe quartet is identical except for the central nucleotide that assays the nucleotide variant [27] common SNPs (SNPs identified in at least two parasite isolates) were blasted against the 3D7 genome to verify a unique 21-mer SNP typing probe sequence. CGH microarray probes were designed using standard NimbleGen CGH protocol [36] modified for the P. falciparum genome. resulting probes were clustered with nearest neighbors and sorted to remove probes with extensive sequence identity to any other probe. samples were considered multiple clone infections if one of the seven microsatellite loci showed multiple alleles. only unique genotypes were included in the study. labeled product was resuspended in water, and 10 g of test and reference samples combined (6 g for 5K SNP chip samples), dried down, and resuspended in hybridization buffer. hybridizations for patient blood samples included 1 Denhardt's solution (Sigma Aldrich) in the hybridization buffer. 7, HB3, Dd2, SC05, and 7C126 were extracted from scanned images. base calls were made on resequencing probesets when the sense and antisense probes made complementary base calls. the discrimination score for each probe quartet was calculated as a background corrected ratio of the signal from the second greatest intensity probe. data for 3D7, HB3, Dd2, SC05, and 7C126 were extracted from scanned images and resequencing base reports generated using NimbleScan v2.5 (Roche NimbleGen, Inc.) base calls were made when the sense and antisense probes made complementary base calls. the discrimination score (Dscore) for each probe quartet was calculated as the average of the third and fourth highest signal intensities. copy number variation analysis Data for HB3 and Dd2 (n = 6 and n = 4 respectively) hybridized against 3D7 were extracted from scanned images and normalized using NimbleScan v2.5 (Roche NimbleGen, Inc.) copy number events from the segmentation analysis in HB3 and Dd2 against the reference 3D7 were compared to known CNV. the CNV breakpoints are precisely identified between hybridizations. four genes (PFE1150w, PFE1155c, PFE1160w, and PFE1165c) are affected by this CNV."}
