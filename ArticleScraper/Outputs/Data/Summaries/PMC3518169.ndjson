{"summary": "Methods Singapore EDs accessible 24/7 were surveyed using the national ED Inventories instrument ( http://www.emnet-nedi.org). ED staff members were asked about ED characteristics with reference to calendar year 2007. Results Fourteen EDs participated (100% response). there has been no systematic study to describe or classify EDs in Singapore. there is a large degree of heterogeneity among EDs, particularly between rural and rural settings. this would extend to the range of services available in each ED with significant variations in their annual census. the us has led the field in formulating a system to document and inventory EDs. one way forward for Singapore to improve emergency care is to collect basic and internationally comparable characteristics of all EDs. a national inventory could potentially help each ED determine the standard of care they wish to achieve, while having an overall understanding of standards. the study was jointly coordinated by the country coordinator and the Emergency Medicine Network (EMNet) the study was determined to be exempt by the Institutional Review Board of Massachusetts General Hospital. questions were subdivided into four categories: ED characteristics. data that required numbers was initially estimated by the respective ED administrators. if confirmation of numbers was available to the country coordinator, such confirmation of official numbers was obtained. subsequently verified by the country coordinator close to the nearest thousand or hundred patients seen for the year 2007. at least part of the ED was open 24/7. it was contiguous in physical layout without a triage-to-service patient flow system. patients seen for non-psychiatric disorders would be referred immediately. the median number of combined adult and child visits per year for all EDs was 39,450 (interquartile range 30,000-130,120), with a mean of 74,440. seven EDs fell into this category, all of which were in the private sector with a mean patient load of 21,893 adults (range 12,000 to 29,738). 6% of all patients requiring admission through EDs came from private institutions. 94% of those requiring admission came from public sector EDs. the majority of EDs reported an average length of stay of between 1 and 6 h. only 15% reported their ED as being undercapacity and 15% as overcapacity. none of the private sector EDs considered themselves to be at overcapacity. dental, obstetric, gynaecological and maxillofacial consultants were not available in two large public general hospitals. all 14 hospitals answered 100% of the survey questions completely. there were no instances of any questions being left unanswered. Virtually every ED had cardiac monitoring available immediately. all 14 surveyed EDs operated from an institutional base, i.e. they were located in hospitals. one was a psychiatric ED, while the other 13 were general EDs. lone psychiatric ED will be described initially, separately. the private sector managed 29% of all children and 23% of all adults who sought care at EDs in the country. the private sector managed 29% of all children and 23% of all adults who sought care at EDs in the country. nearly 98% of all ambulance patients were sent to public sector hospitals. 6% of all patients requiring admission through EDs came from private institutions. 94% of those requiring admission came from public sector EDs. three EDs (23%) reported an average length of stay of less than 1 h. none of the private sector EDs considered themselves to be at overcapacity. none of the private sector EDs considered themselves to be at overcapacity. the availability of plastic surgery consultants appeared to correlate with the type of emergency the EDs reported that they were capable of treating. each institution would have had at least one nurse on duty in at least one of the ED areas, 24 h a day and 7 days a week. almost every ED (92%) had cardiac monitoring available immediately. five of the six public hospitals and three of the seven private facilities had respiratory isolation rooms available in the ED. four private EDs were still dependent on manual systems for such information collection. public sector EDs appear to be equivalent to some of the best similar facilities in countries such as the us [6]. private EDs appear to be staffed by doctors who utilise technology more sparingly in the daily care of patients. a future study may be useful in examining quality differences between private and public EDs. one of the consequences of being perceived as a low-performance ED may be greater reluctance on the part of public emergency ambulance services and patients to want to use them for emergency care. EDs in other developed countries have been struggling with issues related to overcrowding. a study in 2008 found that non-emergent use of the ED had fallen from 57% to 12% over a 12-year period following the implementation of these interventions. the concern about overcapacity may reflect access block issues in these institutions. at least six EDs have CT scanners either within or just adjacent to their premises. mechanical ventilators are available in the resuscitation areas of all public EDs as part of national disaster preparedness. this relates to public perception for the need for prompt management of disaster casualties. Singapore could offer a useful model for EM workforce studies, residency training curriculum, and ED benchmarking and comparisons. countries that have a strong private sector may also learn from the Singapore experience when it comes to comparing delivery of care by public and private EDs. authors\u2019 contributions LSW is coordinating the manuscript submissions at EMNet. she conducted background research, performed data analysis and drafted the manuscript.
