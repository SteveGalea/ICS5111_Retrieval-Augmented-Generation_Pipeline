{"summary": "the use of non-invasive ventilation in these patients is controversial. the aerosol dispersion may contaminate the environment and health-care co-workers. 401 cases of influenza AH1N1 were confirmed in 2009. between 62 and 100% of the patients require mechanical ventilation (MV), with a mortality rate ranging from 16 to 58%. invasive MV has several complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, which is a risk factor for mortality. there is a concern that NIV might lead to aerosol dispersion, which may contaminate health-care co-workers. RT-RTPCR testing was performed in all patients with suspected signs of influenza A H1N1 that were treated at our hospital. nasopharyngeal-swab samples were collected at hospital admission and respiratory secretions obtained from intubated patients. all influenza A H1N1 virus-confirmed patients admitted to the hospital were included in the study. patients were informed of the reasons to use NIV to treat acute respiratory failure. patients needed to collaborate with NIV to use it, being alert and responsive to commands without agitation. patient was promptly intubated at ICU admission. there were 86 patients admitted to the ICU with suspected cases of swine-origin influenza A H1N1 virus. of these cases, 20 patients were confirmed with RT-RTPCR test. the characteristics of the 20 patients admitted to the ICU are listed in Table 1. the APACHE II score ranged from 7 to 25 (median of 7) none of the patients presented acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. the APACHE II score ranged from 7 to 25 (median of 7) the number of days on NIV ranged from 1 to 11 (median of 3 days) none of the patients had hypercapnic respiratory failure. the median carbon dioxide arterial pressure before using NIV was 33.8 mmHg. we identified 1, 401 patients with confirmed diagnosis of influenza A H1N1. of these, only 139 (9.9%) patients needed hospitalization. our ICU admission incidence was lower than that reported in most studies. in this study we had a success rate with NIV in 41.6% of the patients. our APACHE II score was lower than that described by others. many researchers are concerned about using NIV during pandemic respiratory infections due to the infectious exhaled aerosol. all influenza A H1N1 ICU patients stayed in individual and isolated hospital bed to avoid contamination to other patients. our success rate with NIV indicates that patients with influenza A H1N1 can benefit from it, thus preventing the need for invasive MV. patients with influenza A H1N1 admitted to hospitals worldwide had a high mortality rate (13 to 39%) [1-9] but in our study the hospital mortality rate was 2.1%. authors declare that they have no competing interests. CS and CT participated in the data collection. CVS and LC were responsible for collecting RT-RTPCR testing results. ARM participated in the statistical analysis and in drafting the manuscript."}
