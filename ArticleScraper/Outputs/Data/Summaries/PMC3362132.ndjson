{"summary": "respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, rhinovirus (RV), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus (PIV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) among the most common causes of viral respiratory infection in children and adults. virus-induced inflammation can be detrimental to the host. COX-1 is generally constitutively expressed, while COX-2 expression is rapidly induced by growth factors and cytokines. PGH2 can be converted by specific synthases to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), PGD2, PGE2, and PGI2. effects of PGE2 are mediated by its signaling through four distinct G protein-coupled E prostanoid (EP) receptors, EP1-4. kotriene A4, LTA4H\u2014leukotriene A4 hydrolase, LTB4\u2014leukotriene B4, BLT1 and BLT2\u2014B leukotriene receptor 1 and 2, LTC4S\u2014leukotriene C4 synthase, LTC4\u2014leukotriene C4, -GT--glutamyl transpeptidase, -GL--glutamyl leukotrienease, LTD4\u2014leu leukotrienes C4, D4, or E4 are collectively known as the cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) expression of 5-LO is tightly regulated and is restricted to cells of the myeloid lineage, such as monocytes/macrophages, mast cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils. human bronchial epithelial cells and fibroblasts are capable of producing both cysLTs and L cysLT1 mRNA is expressed in epithelial cells, bronchial smooth muscle cells, interstitial macrophages, and the nasal mucosa. cysLT1 mRNA is expressed in epithelial cells, bronchial smooth muscle cells, interstitial macrophages, and the nasal mucosa. it is expressed more ubiquitously, with high mRNA expression detected in the spleen and low levels in most human tissues the effects of GE2 are mediated by its signaling through four distinct G protein-coupled E prostanoid (EP) receptors, EP1-4. EP1 receptor is coupled to an unidentified G protein and mediates PGE2-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+. EP2 and EP4 receptors mediate increases in cyclic AMP (cAMP) concentration by coupling to G s. leukotrienes LTs are also generated by liberation of AA from cell membranes. this is modified by a series of enzymes beginning with 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), which acts in concert with 5-LO-activating protein (FLAP) to form leukotriene A4 (LTA4). Alternatively, LTA4 can be conjugated to reduced glutathione by leukotriene C4 (LTC4) synthase to form LTC bronchial epithelial cells and fibroblasts are capable of producing both cysLTs and LTB4. the intermediate LTA4 can be transferred from an activated donor cell to a recipient cell. the effects of LTs are mediated by signaling through G protein-coupled receptors. mRNA is expressed in epithelial cells, bronchial smooth muscle cells, interstitial macrophages, and the nasal mucosa. mRNA is expressed in epithelial cells, bronchial smooth muscle cells, interstitial macrophages, and the nasal mucosa. human BLT1 is expressed primarily in leukocytes. PGE2 cysLTs Neutrophils Inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and bacterial killing Promotes NO generation in neutrophils Macrophages Inhibits AM phagocytosis, ROS generation, and bacterial killing Enhance AM phagocytosis Enhance AM phagocytosis T cells Promotes Th17 differentiation Induces T cell recruitment Enhances Th2 response B cells/Antibody production Promotes DC the role of PGE2 is not strictly suppressive, as it has been shown to promote certain pathways in immune differentiation. for example, PGE2 can act on uncommitted B lymphocytes to promote isotype switching to IgE or IgG1 [45\u201347]. COX inhibitors inhibit antibody production in activated human B lymphocytes [48, 49] LTB4 induces antimicrobial peptide release from neutrophils in vivo. cysLTs play a role in regulation of a pulmonary Th2 response. cysLTs are recognized as important mediators in the pathogenesis of asthma. widespread expression of COX-2 has been demonstrated in airway epithelial and resident inflammatory cells in the absence of overt inflammation. high concentrations of COX products are present in the epithelial lining fluid of human airways, potentially playing a role in regulation of human airway homeostasis [27] bacterial killing Promotes AM phagocytosis, ROS generation, and survival Induces NO generation in neutrophils Macrophages Induces AM phagocytosis, ROS generation, and bacterial killing Enhances AM phagocytosis Enhance AM phagocytosis T cells Promotes Th17 differentiation Induces T cell recruitment Enhances Th2 response B cells/Antibody production Promotes DC migration Promotes DC migration Cytokines Suppresses I cysLTs and LTB4 can promote migration of dendritic cells in vivo. cysLTs and LTB4 can enhance phagocytosis by AMs. cysLTs increase IL-17 production and Th17 differentiation. studies have reported that LTB4 acts synergistically with IL-4 to induce activation, proliferation, and differentiation of human B lymphocytes. a separate study reported that 5-LO inhibitors actually enhanced B lymphocyte proliferation [82]. cysLTs can promote microvascular leak [11], enhance leukocyte survival [83, 84] and induce nitric oxide (NO generation in neutrophils. za upregulates COX-2 expression both in vitro and in vivo. it has been suggested that COX hyperinduction contributes to the exaggerated cytokine response observed in severe human H5N1 infections. triple therapy significantly reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-, and IFN-. another group treated influenza-infected mice with paracetamol, a selective inhibitor of COX-2. influenza infection upregulates 5-LO expression and/or levels of LTs in cell lines and in lungs of infected mice and humans. few studies have examined influenza infection in the context of altered 5-LO production (either due to genetic deficiency or pharmacologic inhibition) the beneficial effects of COX-2 deficiency may also be due to shunting of released AA to the 5-LO pathway. the differences in COX and 5-LO products may reflect the different pathophysiology of the influenza strains used. mortality rates of up to 80% reported for severe RSV pneumonia. treatment with COX inhibitors reduces RSV replication in vitro and diminishes immunopathology in vivo. a possible effect of MK-571 on viral titers was not examined in this study. successful treatment of RSV infection may require the use of an antiviral agent in combination with an anti-inflammatory agent that limits immunopathology. studies in animal models used pharmacologic agents given to mice. cysLT1 antagonist montelukast was used as treatment in children with RSV bronchiolitis. cysLT levels in BAL fluid are increased upon rhinovirus infection in humans. adenovirus pathogenesis are limited by the strict species specificity of adenoviruses. using mouse adenovirus type 1 to study the pathogenesis of adenovirus respiratory infection [138] will provide a useful tool to define the roles of eicosanoids to adenovirus respiratory infection. HCMV induces 5-LO expression and LTB4 production. treatment of influenza-infected mice with celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, did not significantly affect viral titers or disease severity. treatment did suppress production in the lung of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-, IL-6 and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) a group treated influenza-infected mice with paracetamol (acetominophen), a selective inhibitor of COX-2. paracetamol-treated mice had improved lung function and reduced immunopathology. the degree of improvement was generally less than that seen in paracetamol-treated mice. influenza infection upregulates 5-LO expression and/or levels of LTs in cell lines and in lungs of infected mice and humans. few studies have examined influenza infection in the context of altered 5-LO production. COX-2/ mice showed higher BAL fluid levels of cysLTs than wild-type mice. however, increased survival was associated with lower LT levels and higher PGE2 levels in the treated mice. treatment with COX inhibitors reduces RSV replication in vitro. inhibition also reduced transcription and production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-8 and RANTES (CCL5) successful treatment of RSV infection may require the use of an antiviral agent in combination with an anti-inflammatory agent that limits immunopathology. further support comes from a model of pneumonia virus of mice, a paramyxovirus that is a close phylogenetic relative of RSV. cysLT antagonist montelukast was used as treatment in mice with RSV bronchiolitis. there are no human studies that examine prophylactic administration of 5-LO pathway inhibitors or receptor antagonists to high-risk children. eicosanoids to adenovirus respiratory infection can also cause respiratory infections, although symptomatic disease is uncommon in immunocompetent individuals. HCMV induces 5-LO expression and LTB4 production in vascular smooth muscle cells as well as COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in fibroblasts. inhibition of LT production or signaling during respiratory viral infection is associated with less inflammation accompanied by variable (but generally beneficial) effects on lung physiology. administration of exogenous LTB4 also blunted inflammatory responses to influenza virus in one study. piratory viral infections cause substantial disease and are associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare utilization. fewer drugs are available to treat infections with herpesviruses such as herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, and HCMV. exaggerated eicosanoid production has been associated with increased susceptibility to bacterial infection that is linked to impaired neutrophil and macrophage phagocytosis. increased PGE2 production has been reported in humans with a variety of disease states including cancer [146], aging [147], HIV infection [148], malnutrition [149, 150], and stem cell and solid organ transplant recipients [151, 152]. eicosanoids modulate host immune responses that are important contributors to viral pathogenesis. it will be essential to better define mechanisms underlying the effects of eicosanoids on both innate and adaptive immune responses."}
