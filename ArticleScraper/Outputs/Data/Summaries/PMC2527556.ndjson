{"summary": "study evaluates the impact of academic detailing and a computerised decision support system (CDSS) on clinicians' prescribing behaviour for patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) Methods The management of all patients presenting to the emergency department over three successive time periods was evaluated. international and national guidelines have been produced to guide the management of CAP [13-15] but uptake has been poor. results of interest included prescription of antibiotics that were concordant with guideline recommendations, early identification of the severely ill patients and adjustment of antibiotics to meet recommendations for prescribing in the severely ill group. the study focused on antibiotic prescribing for all patients who were initially diagnosed with CAP by the treating clinician in the ED. the first (or 'baseline') period was from April 2003\u2013March 2004. the second (or 'academic detailing') period (AD) was February 2005\u2013October 2005. the third (or 'computerised decision support') period was from April 2006\u2013September 2006. cic Society severity score (CURB) was integrated with databases containing patient demographics and pathology results to facilitate rapid calculation of scores required for these prediction rules. users could choose to skip the score to obtain antibiotic advice alone. a single clinician was assigned to make judgements about difficult issues. a random sample of these cases was cross checked with a second infectious diseases physician. the time to antibiotic therapy was calculated using the time of presentation, documented electronically by the ED triage nurse. the researchers had no clinical role in the ED over the study period. there were no major changes in the number or composition of staff in the ED over the study period. a priori level of statistical significance of 0.05 was assumed. the baseline period extended over one year to give an indication of the baseline pattern of change in the rate of concordant prescribing over time, in the absence of any intervention. the 'expected' proportion of concordant treatment at any given time corresponds to a regression line fitted through the data. we hypothesized that the rate of concordant prescribing after the intervention would be greater than that expected given the observed trend before the intervention (the first and second time periods) at the start of the second (academic detailing') time period, a program of academic detailing was initiated at the hospital. the program involved training two senior ED clinicians, a pharmacist and a nurse to provide academic detailing to their colleagues. they spent one on one time educating colleagues about antibiotic prescribing recommendations. users had access to medical literature via the internet, along with local interpretation of this literature within the CDSS. the CDSS was available hospital wide and its use was entirely voluntary. no specific incentives were provided to encourage it. a single clinician was assigned to make judgements about any difficult issues. a random sample of these cases was cross checked with a second infectious diseases physician. the time to antibiotic therapy was calculated using the time of presentation, documented electronically by the ED triage nurse. the use of moxifloxacin alone was deemed appropriate. patients who received additional antibiotics were still classed as appropriate. a number of secondary outcomes were also examined. the baseline period extended over one year to give an indication of the baseline pattern of change in the rate of concordant prescribing over time, in the absence of any intervention. the computerised decision support period included enough patients to detect an expected further improvement in concordance from 65% to 75% (120 patients, power = 0.8 and p = 0.05). patients were generally older than those in the other two time periods. the observed death rate during the CDSS period appeared to be higher than for the other two periods. differences in the number of patients who died in the ED for whom supportive therapy was not thought appropriate Table 1. n (%) 35/390 8.9% 12/213 6.5% 16/128 7.8% 0.23* Comorbidities: (%) CCF 20.4 15.3 18.0 0.30 COAD 23.4 15.3 26.3 0.02 Neoplasia 13.7 14.4 16.5 0.73 CRF 11.9

release of the guideline, the concordance rate was around 60%. at the end of the study period, the rate of concordant prescribing was high. the broken line is a regression line that best fits the observed data in just the first and second time periods. horizontal arrows demonstrate the timing of the two interventions. the vertical arrow represents the difference between the 'predicted' concordance and the observed concordance after the computerised decision support system (CDSS) intervention. compared the AD period with the baseline, the odds of an allergy prescribing error were 0.99 [0.31, 3.16], p = 0.99; compared the CDSS with the AD period, the odds ratio for such a prescribing error was 0.47. the percentage of patients empirically prescribed a cephalosporin was 38.2% for the baseline period, 38.1% for the academic detailing period, and 42.8% for the computerised decision support period. doxycycline 4.2% Computerised decision support period Penicillin IV + roxithromycin 28.6% Ceftriaxone + roxithromycin 17.3% Ceftriaxone + azithromycin 12.8% Ceftriaxone 6.7% Penicillin IV + doxycycline 6.0% Discussion This study demonstrates the pattern of behavioural change in emergency department clinicians over three and a half years. the CDSS was associated with changes in many secondary outcomes of interest. this change occurred without a major increase in the overall rate of cephalosporin use. this change occurred without a major increase in the overall rate of cephalosporin use or the average antibiotic costs per patient. this study describes a clinical setting familiar to most tertiary australia hospitals. the major limitation of this study is that the changes were not compared with a separate control group. this study used the same group of clinicians at different time points as controls. Melbourne Health had no influence over the findings described in this study. authors have no other personal financial interests in the CDSS."}
