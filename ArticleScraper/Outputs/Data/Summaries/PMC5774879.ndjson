{"summary": "the currently known members of the Alphavirus genus are divided into the New World (NW) and the Old World (OW) alphaviruses (1). most of the NW alphaviruses exhibit an encephalitogenic phenotype. in humans, these viruses cause debilitating diseases. nonstructural proteins are synthesized as precursor polyproteins P123 and P1234. they are later processed by nsP2-associated protease activity into individual nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4. this stepwise processing regulates synthesis of the negative-strand RNA genome intermediates, G RNAs and SG RNAs. processes in the host cell were also investigated as potential therapeutic options. these included an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase kinase-3 (GSK-3) that governs proinflammatory responses in the host cell (17); acriflavine, an inhibitor of Ago2 (18); d-() enantiomer of carbodine, which inhibited cellular CTP synthetase and was capable of decreasing levels of intracellular CTP. NHC is a very potent anti-VEEV agent, with an EC50 below 1 M. most VEE virions released from the NHC-treated cells contain mutated viral genomes. RESULTS NHC has a strong negative effect on infectious titers. Vero cells were infected with VEEV TC-83 at an MOI of 0.5 PFU/cell. at the indicated times p.i., media were harvested, and viral titers were determined by a plaque assay. NHC was most potent when applied 2 h before infection, causing a reduction in infectious virus titers of more than 4 orders of magnitude. addition of the compound at 6 h p.i. had a very small, 5-fold, negative effect on final infectious titers. the number of genome copies of VEEV TC-83 (GE/ml) was measured by qPCR. in the same samples, the number of genome copies of VEEV TC-83 (GE/ml) was measured by qPCR. infected cells were incubated in NHC-free medium until 4 h p.i., and media were replaced. all of the samples indicated in panels A and B were harvested at 24 h p.i., and viral titers were determined by a plaque assay on Vero cells. infectious titers were determined by a plaque assay on vero cells. the standard deviation are too low to be visible on the plot. the experiment was performed three times. the majority of mutations acquired in the presence of NHC were transition mutations. VEEV resistance to NHC develops very inefficiently. the drug-resistant phenotype likely required multiple adaptive mutations. nsP-coding sequence of plaque isolate 1 (PP1) contained 34 synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations. plaque isolate 2 (PP2) had 41 mutations in the same fragment (57.3 mutations per 10,000 nt) mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions in the nsPs were presented in Fig. 5A. a large number of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations in the nsP-coding sequence were the same in both randomly selected plaque isolates. this was a strong indication that development of any resistance to NHC is likely to be a rare event. such a mutant likely appeared in one of the intermediate, earlier passages; however, it continued to accumulate other mutations. o cells in six-well plates were infected with VEEV TC-83, PP2 or PREV1 at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell and were incubated with or without 2 M NHC. at the indicated time points, media were collected, and the infectious titers (PFU/ml) and concentrations of genome-containing viral particles (GE/ml) were determined by a plaque assay on Vero cells and RT-qPCR, respectively. the PP2 isolate was passaged 20 times in vero cells in NHC-free media. after the last passage, the resulting virus population was homogeneous in terms of plaque size. a plaque-purified variant (PREV1) from this population was used to sequence the nsP-coding genes. a standard plaque assay, cell monolayers infected with the same dilution samples were overlaid with 0.5% agarose-containing media without or with the indicated concentrations of NHC. the indicated concentrations of NHC were applied at 0 h p.i., and media were harvested at 24 h p.i. the PP2 drug resistance was unstable and in the absence of NHC, this mutant reverted to an NHC-sensitive phenotype. the evolution to higher replication rates of the pseudorevertant PREV1 was the result of accumulation of additional mutations in the PP2 genome. to further evaluate the mechanism of NHC-specific inhibition of VEEV replication, we performed a detailed comparative analysis of VEEV TC-83 and PREV1 pseudorevertant. PP2 mutant produced essentially the same level of particles (GE) in the presence or absence of NHC. this compound caused a modest decrease in virion release and a strong decrease in virion infectivity. however, the negative effect of the compound on infectious titers of PP2 but not on particle release was also detectable. VEEV TC-83 population showed relatively low diversity after 20 passages. only 7 mutations with frequency above 5% were found after 20 passages. none of the mutations became prevalent (with frequencies above 50%) mutations that lead to NHC-resistant and NHC-sensitive phenotypes of VEEV TC-83 are closely located in the 3D structure of the catalytic domain of VEEV nsP4. the structure of FMDV 3D protein is presented as a solid, light blue ribbon. amino acids that bind RNA template are presented as turquoise sticks for both polymers. mutation was 23% at passage 5 and steadily increased to 76% by passage 15. by passage 20, the mutation was no longer prevalent and was replaced in the virus pool by a combination of two other amino acid substitutions, P187S and A189V. mutation accumulation in the index finger suggested the possibility of its function in regulating nucleotide incorporation by nsP4. the predicted 3D structure of VEEV nsP4 was located very close to each other (Fig. 10) and to the mutations found in the NHC-resistant virus population and in the plaque isolates PP1 and PP2. nsP4-specific mutations are determinants of resistance and sensitivity of selected VEEV variants to NHC. nsP4-specific mutations determine the resistance of VEEV replication to NHC. in a standard plaque assay performed on the indicated viruses, vero cells were overlaid with 0.5% agarose-containing medium either with or without 1.5 M NHC. after 2 days, plaques were visualized by staining with crystal violet. mutants were viable, replicated at the same rates as VEEV TC-83. however, in the presence of 1.5 M NHC in the agarose overlay, the parental VEEV formed almost undetectable, pinpoint plaques. the VEEV/P187S mutant, surprisingly, was found to be more sensitive to compound than parental VEEV TC-83. mutation induced significantly higher resistance to NHC than the early A189T mutation in nsP4. cloning of A201V into the genome of the VEEV/3x mutant had a profound negative effect on viral resistance to NHC. the VEEV/3x mutant replicated in vero cells to the same titers and at the same rates as the parental VEEV TC-83 and VEEV/3x mutant. NHC demonstrated a strong negative effect on the replication of VEEV TC-83 in vero cells. in the applied experimental conditions, NHC reduced titers of released virus progeny by 2 and 4 orders of magnitude. in the applied experimental conditions, NHC at 1 and 2.5 M concentrations reduced titers of released virus progeny by 2 and 4 orders of magnitude. NHC was most potent when applied 2 h before infection, causing a reduction in infectious virus titers of more than 4 orders of magnitude. if added at later times p.i., the negative effect on released viral progeny titers gradually decreased. media from cells incubated with the compound starting from 2 h prior to infection, the GE/PFU ratio was >100-fold higher than in media harvested from mock-treated cells. this was an indication that early treatment led to release of mostly noninfectious virions. however, the antiviral effect of NHC depends on its application time. treatment started after 4 h p.i. caused a relatively small negative effect on the infectious titers, irrespective of NHC concentration and despite its presence in the media for a longer period of time (20 h) the first 4 h p.i. are a critical time for the antiviral effect of NHC. the media were harvested at 24 h p.i., and the virus titers were determined by plaque assay on vero cells. the results are presented in Fig. 4A. a 941-nucleotide fragment of viral genome in both samples was amplified by RT-PCR. the PCR products were cloned into a plasmid, and for each sample, the plasmid insertions of 50 randomly selected clones were sequenced. the majority of mutations acquired in the presence of NHC were transition mutations. VEEV resistance to NHC develops very inefficiently. after 15 passages, we selected a viral population, capable of replication and CPE production in the presence of 3.2 M NHC. no homogeneous viral population was found at any passage, including passage 20. this was indicative of continuous viral evolution, even after acquiring partial resistance to NHC. mutations in structural genes had no effect on virus infectivity. PP2 isolate demonstrated the same GE/PFU ratio as the original VEEV TC-83. a large number of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations in the nsP-coding sequence were the same in both randomly selected plaque isolates. mutations identified in plaque purified variants PP1, PP2, PREV1 and plaque-purified VEEV TC-83 are highlighted in gray. a total of 5 105 Vero cells in six-well plates were infected with VEEV TC-83, PP2 or PREV1 at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. VEEV TC-83 was passaged in parallel 20 times in the absence of NHC. neither changes in plaque sizes nor changes in virus titers were detected. both mutations found in the virus passaged without drug were transversions. this resulted in accumulation 20-fold more mutations than in the absence of the compound. cells were incubated either in the absence (A) or in the presence (B) of 2 M NHC. at the indicated time points, media were harvested, and viral titers were determined using a plaque assay on vero cells. most of the standard deviations are too small to be visible on the plot. wt VEEV TC-83 could not develop plaques in the presence of 2.5 M NHC. PP2 mutant replicated more efficiently than parental VEEV TC-83 and PREV1. in the absence of NHC, this mutant reverted to an NHC-sensitive phenotype. PP2 mutant produced essentially the same level of particles (GE) in the presence or absence of NHC. PP2 mutant was able to release viral particles to higher infectious titers compared to VEEV TC-83 and PREV1. resistance of PP2 to NHC was only partial. NHC induces rapid evolution of the VEEV population. we applied next-generation sequencing (NGS) to characterize the effect of NHC treatment. nsP4-specific mutations were present in the viral pool with frequencies higher than 50%. the same mutations were identified in the plaque-purified variants PP1 and PP2. mutations that lead to resistance to NHC are closely located in the 3D structure of the catalytic domain of VEEV nsP4. the amino acids that were substituted in the pool of PP2 virus passaged 20 times in NHC-free media are shown in medium green (I190) and light green (A189 and P187) the presence of VEEV genomes encoding a nonconservative amino acid substitution I190T steadily increased with virus passaging. mutations in plaque-purified VEEV isolate PP2 correlated with the findings of numerous new mutations in the genome of plaque-purified, NHC-resistant VEEV isolate PP2. mutations in viral populations at passage 5, 10, 15, and 20, determined by NGS. mutations in viral populations at passage 5, 10, 15, and 20 were determined by NGS. combination of I190T, P187S, and A189V mutations was identified in both the pool of NHC-resistant mutants (Fig. 8B) and the genomes of plaque-purified variants (Fig. 11A) nsP4-specific mutations determine the resistance of VEEV replication to NHC. a total of 5 105 vero cells were infected with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 2 PFU/cell. titers were normalized to those in the samples harvested from mock-treated cells. the VEEV/I190T mutant was more resistant to NHC than the parental VEEV. VEEV/P187S was more sensitive to this compound, and the VEEV/3x mutant was the most resistant to the NHC treatment. in addition, we compared the effects of both mutations on development of virus resistance to drug. the most widely used nucleoside analog with the antiviral activity is ribavirin (27, 28) it demonstrates a broad-spectrum inhibitory effect against a number of RNA viruses and low cytotoxicity and functions as an RNA mutagen. this leads to the accumulation of random mutations in viral genomes. the antiviral activity of another nucleoside analog, NHC. this compound exhibited a very strong inhibitory effect on VEEV infection in cell culture. previous studies showed that in cultured cells, NHC is rapidly converted into mono-, di-, and triphosphate forms, along with other metabolites, such as CTP and UTP. infected cells produced 10- to 20-fold fewer G RNA-containing viral particles. this was an indication that most of the released virions contained noninfectious viral genomes that were incapable of producing a spreading infection. a high proportion of these plaques were small and pinpoint in size. the immature replication complex, which is composed of P123 and nsP4, is only present within the first 4 h p.i., at the amplification stage of viral RNA. in this complex, RdRp might utilize NHC-TP more efficiently than in a mature RC that contains completely processed, individual nsPs. the same mutation was prevalent in almost 100% of the viral genomes by passage 20 (in the presence of NHC) the ultimately developed triple mutant contained a combination of P187S, A189V, and I190T substitutions in nsP4. their presence made virus replication clearly more resistant to the drug (Fig. 11) PP2 mutant further evolved to a more efficiently replicating phenotype. it was also acquiring mutations dramatically more efficiently than the original VEEV TC-83 in the absence of drug. the more efficiently replicating phenotype of PREV1 correlated with a complete loss of NHC resistance. this mutation may compensate for the defect caused by a triple substitution in the index finger domain. this study demonstrated several key features of NHC. NHC induces high mutation rates in the genome of replicating VEEV. the original plasmids containing the infectious cDNAs of VEEV TC-83 were described elsewhere (44). mutations were introduced into nsP4 using standard PCR-based techniques. sequences of the plasmids and details regarding the cloning procedures can be provided upon request. cells were harvested for RNA isolation and sequencing of viral genomes. media were used as stocks for further analysis of viral isolates. one of the plaque-purified variants, PP2, was additionally passaged 20 times in vero cells in the absence of NHC. st EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad) and a CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) the specificities of the products were tested by measuring their melting temperatures, and the data were normalized to the mean threshold cycle of the SINV control. cDNAs synthesis and qPCR analyses were performed using the above-described protocols. 300-bp paired-end sequencing was performed on a miSeq Illumina machine. Illumina BaseSpace was used for base-calling and read demultiplexing. trim Galore (v0.4.1) was used to remove adaptor contaminants. 20 VEEV TC-83 None 20 2,239,203 1,697,248 (75.80) d10 VEEV TC-83 NHC 10 2,748,574 1,291,652 (46.99) d15 VEEV TC-83 NHC 15 1,312,641 456,518 (34.78) d20 VEEV TC-83 NHC 20 2,102,043 949,366 (45.16) r5 VEEV TC- the RNA-seq data have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE106752. a total of 2.5 106 Vero cells in 100-mm dishes were infected at an MOI of 1 P.
