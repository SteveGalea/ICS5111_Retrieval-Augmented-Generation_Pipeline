{"summary": "the livestock industry is faced with the double constraint of limiting its use of natural resources (land use for feed production and grazing, water input) and antibiotic consumption. reliable methods are needed to evaluate the economic and environmental impact of prevention measures aimed at reducing the incidence of endemic livestock pathogens. bovine herpes virus type 1 (BHV-1), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine parainfluenza 3 (BPIV-3), bovine adenovirus type 3 (BAdV-3) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) the risk of BRD is greatest during or soon after the transportation of cattle. France constitutes an interesting case study for three reasons. it comprises the largest cattle population of Europe [11]. its population structure is complex and diverse. it therefore constitutes a relevant case study to create a generic model. literature review was performed beforehand to identify the cattle production parameters significantly affected by BRD. based on these data, production parameters of cattle affected and not affected by BRD during their production period were estimated, as described in Material and Methods part 2.2. all male calves used for veal meat production and a large proportion of male calves used for young bull meat production are transferred to other farms for fattening. the age at transfer is comprised between 1 week and 1 month. veal meat production is vulnerable to BRD in breeding farms between 7 days and 150 days of age. in male weaned calves moved to other farms for fattening and in non-weaned calves being fattened in veal feedlot farms. effects of changes in BRD incidence rates in 5 specific at-risk production stages. in the first 40 days after introduction in feedlot, i.e. from 250 to 290 days old (in the young bull feedlot compartment of the dairy sector) the effect of BRD incidence reduction in these production stages was assessed at the level of their sector. the methodological framework of the study is illustrated in Fig 1. Methodological framework of the study. the French cattle production system is composed of two distinct sectors of comparable size: the beef suckling sector and the dairy sector. a given proportion of newborn calves are used as breeding herd replacements. males are sold as young bulls between 1 and 2 years of age, after a period of fattening or sold as weanlings. all male calves used for veal meat production and a large proportion of male calves used for young bull meat production are transferred to other farms for fattening. the age at transfer is comprised between 1 week and 1 month. calves used for veal meat production represent less than 10% of the total number of calves born per year in both beef and dairy sectors. veal calves from introduction in feedlot (at 7 days) to slaughter at about 6 months (in the veal feedlot compartment of the dairy sector) veal calves moved to a different farm for fattening, in the first 40 days after introduction in feedlot. literature review and model parameters Many production parameters of cattle are potentially affected by BRD occurrence. a literature review was performed to identify cattle production parameters which were demonstrated to be significantly impacted by BRD.

Eradicating BRD in this production stage would result in a 5.1% increase in the beef sector productivity (95% CI: 4.7\u20135.5%) in financial terms, this gain of productivity would represent an additional revenue of approximately 95.5 million EUR/year at national level. eradicating BRD in beef and dairy calves would have substantial effect on the demographic structure of the female cattle population. proportion of female calves used as surplus would increase by 1.3% (95% CI: 1.2\u20131.4) and 0.8% (95% CI: 0.6\u20131.0) in the beef and dairy sector respectively. in each cell: Mean value (in bold type); between parenthesis: successively, 95% confidence interval with constant market values and 95% confidence interval with 5% variation in market values.

p 1 = + ( 1 - p) ten thousand values of the abovementioned parameters were sampled from their modelled probability distribution. corresponding changes in productivity in response to given changes in BRD incidence rates were estimated. variability of market values (livestock products prices and additional farming costs) was also accounted for using the same method. a specific research was conducted in the online records of the French veterinary theses. a given effect was considered for inclusion in the model if its significance was demonstrated by at least half of the selected studies conducted on it. quantitative estimates of the selected effects were chosen for use in the model. a breeding female (i.e. cow) was defined as a female cattle during her reproductive period (i.e. from her first calving until her departure from the system) the model determined the proportion of female and male calves used as breeding herd replacement in order to maintain a constant population. value of PV, TME and AC directly resulted from the set of equations: P V = i n R o i V o i V o i T M E = i m n i m n i m n i m e i A C = i m n i c i + i c t With m the total number of sub-categories (determined by purpose and BRD status the totality of the milk produced by breeding females was considered to be entirely purchased (as raw milk or milk replacer) the formula used to estimate the ME required by breeding females to produce 1 kg of milk was supplied by the national research council. mean ADGs of cattle of the considered class of age were considered to be = p1 + (1 p)0 and 1 0 =. the duration of the rearing period of veal calves at sale time was considered to be independent on their ADG. however, the final weight reached by veal calves at sale time was considered to depend on their ADG. 0 and 1 were assumed to be equal to the current standard deviation of ADG in the cattle population. risk of downgrading of carcasses of veal calves or young bulls affected and not affected by BRD were calculated as: 0 = - p 1 = + ( 1 - p) the model is steady-state and deterministic, assuming a constant livestock population over time. based on the mortality rates in the different age classes, the herd breeding performance parameters and the sex ratio of the breeding stock, the model determined the proportion of female and male calves used as breeding herd replacement. m the total number of sub-categories (determined by purpose and BRD status) ci the additional variable cost per cattle head per unit of time in the sub-category i, i the number of treatments of BRD cases administered in sub-category i per year and ct the average veterinary cost of BRD cases treatment. the formula used to estimate the ME required by breeding females to produce 1 kg of milk was supplied by the national research council [71]. the formula used to estimate the ME required by breeding females to produce 1 kg of milk was supplied by the national research council. the population during the considered critical period was considered to be = p1 + (1 p)0 and 1 0 =. mean ADGs of cattle of the considered class of age were inferred from, p and : 0 = -

p 1 = +. a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the dependency of the model results to market values. the relative effect of each market value was estimated from the Pearson product correlation coefficient between model outputs (the proportion change of the sector productivity) and sampled model inputs (the considered market value) (DOCX) Click here for additional data file.
