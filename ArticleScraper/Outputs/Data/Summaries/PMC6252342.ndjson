{"summary": "interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a regulatory cytokine with a demonstrated anti-inflammatory function and plays an essential role in preventing allergic inflammation (1), autoimmunity (2), and pathogen-induced immunopathology. IL-10 has been reported as a product of activation of multiple immune cell lineages. innate immune cells including dendritic cells (DCs) (7), macrophages (8), neutrophils (9), and innate lymphoid cells co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b has been proposed to be a cell surface signature of the Foxp3 IL-10high Tr1 cells. IL-10 can be highly up-regulated in activated Foxp3+ Treg and CD8+ T cells under inflammatory conditions and/or upon TCR activation. co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b is a generic signature of IL-10-producing T cells. co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b is also a shared feature of human IL-10-producing FOXP3 CD4+, FOXP3+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. antibodies from BioLegend (San Diego, CA); Pacific Blue-CD90 (53-2.1), FITC-TCR (H57-597), APC-LAG3 (C9B7W), PE-Cy7-CD49b (HM2), and PE-Cy7-CD62L (MEL-14) were from BioLegend; eFluor 450-CD4 (GK1.5); Alexa Fluor 700-CD4 (GK1.5) were ed in 0.2 mg/ml Liberase TL (Sigma, St. Luis, MO) in 37\u00b0C for 15\u201330 min, then filtered and red blood cells were lysed before analysis. intestines were flushed, opened longitudinally, and inner contents removed with the blunt end of scissors. digestion in 100 U/ml collagenase VIII (Sigma) in 37\u00b0C for 1 h, filtered, and lymphocytes isolated using gradient separation farmer's lung disease (hypersensitivity pneumonitis) model Mice were exposed to 150 g Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula (SR, ATCC 29034) extract on 3 consecutive days each week as previously described (41), for 4 weeks. anti-human CD3 (1 g/ml) and CD28 (CD28.2, eBioscience, 1\u20133 g/ml), recombinant human (rh) IL-2 (PeproTech, 200 U/ml), IL-10 (PeproTech, 100 U/ml), IL-27 (R&D System, 25 ng/ml), and IFN-2b (R&D System, 10 ng/ml) were added to differentiate Flow cytometry data were acquired on LSRII, FACS Aria II or Fusion systems (BD Biosciences), and analyzed in FlowJo (Tree Star, Ashland, OR) all analyses were performed on fixed viability dye negative singlet population.

AG3 and CD49b marks both IL-10-producing TR1 and Treg cells IL-10 production can be significantly elevated in the pulmonary mucosa during the late stages of parasitic infection by Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb) both Foxp3 and Foxp3+ T cells are capable of producing IL-10 in the pulmonary tissues post Nb infection (40). the levels of LAG3 and CD49b expression are similar between the Foxp3+ and Foxp3 counterparts of IL-10+ CD4+ T cells. IL-10-producing CD4+ T cells, regardless of Foxp3 expression, have a high capacity of co-expressing LAG3 and CD49b. IL-10-producing T cells include both Foxp3+ and Foxp3 subsets. vs. Foxp3 IL-10-producing LAG3/CD49b double positive CD4+ T cells. gMFI of LAG3 and CD49b in Foxp3+ vs. Foxp3 IL-10-producing CD4+ T cells. the relative proportions of IL-10-producing Foxp3+ CD4+, Foxp3 CD4+ and CD8+ subsets differ in the various disease models. in the SR-triggered farmer's lung disease model, Foxp3+ CD4+ T cells are the majority of the IL-10-producing LAG3+CD49b+ T cells in the lungs. model of parasitic infection shown in Figure 2, our data suggest that co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b marks all IL-10-producing T cell lineages in the pulmonary system. all experiments were performed using mice carrying the IL-10GFP/Foxp3RFP dual reporter system. cells were isolated from the lungs and gated on live singlets for analysis. IL-10-producing T cells in vivo in pulmonary tissues under multiple inflammatory conditions. we injected IL-10GFP/Foxp3RFP mice with an anti-CD3 antibody. co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b marked a portion of the IL-10-producing T cells following TCR activation in vivo. mice carrying the IL-10GFP/Foxp3RFP dual reporter system were injected with CD3 antibody on day 0 and 2 and analyzed on day 4. data represent results of three experiments, and are presented as Mean S.E.M. human IL-10-producing Treg, Tr1 and CD8+ T cells exhibit a LAG3+CD49b+ phenotype. cells were cultured under IL-10-inducing conditions. cells were stimulated and subjected to intracellular staining. data represent results of more than three independent experiments. anti-IL-12, and IL-27 can efficiently induce the differentiation of Tr1 cells (28, 40, 43), which express high levels of LAG3 and CD49b. IL-10-producing CD8+ T cells can express higher levels of LAG3 and CD49b than their IL-10-producing CD4+ counterparts induced in the same cell culture. co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b marks both IL-10-producing TR1 and Treg cells IL-10 production can be significantly elevated in the pulmonary mucosa during the late stages of parasitic infection by Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. both Foxp3 and Foxp3+ T cells are capable of producing IL-10 in the pulmonary tissues post Nb infection (40). IL-10-producing CD4+ T cells, regardless of Foxp3 expression, have a high capacity of co-expressing LAG3 and CD49b. IL-10-producing LAG3+CD49b+ CD4+ T cells include both Foxp3+ and Foxp3 subsets. fected mouse lungs are CD4+ T cells, including both Foxp3+ Treg and Foxp3 Tr1 cells. fected mice were exposed intranasally to house dust mite (HDM) protein extract. we observed significant percentages of IL-10-producing T cells in the lung tissue of mice exposed to HDM (Figure 3A), SR (Figure 3C), or WSN/flu virus (Figure 3E). these IL-10-producing T cells all co-expressed high levels of LAG3 and CD49b. however, relative proportions of IL-10-producing Foxp3+ CD4+, Foxp3 CD4+ and CD8+ subsets differ in the various disease models. data compared composition of IL-10-producing LAG3+CD49b+ T cells in various murine models of pulmonary inflammatory and infectious disease models. co-expression of IL-10-producing LAG3+CD49b+ T cells marks all IL-10-producing T cell lines in the pulmonary system. co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b is a generic feature of IL-10-producing T cells in vivo in pulmonary tissues under multiple inflammatory conditions. we injected IL-10GFP mice with an anti-CD3 antibody that has been shown to stimulate pronounced IL-10 production by T cells through TCR activation in vivo (23, 40) mice carrying the IL-10GFP/Foxp3RFP dual reporter system were injected with CD3 antibody on day 0 and 2. mice carrying the IL-10GFP/Foxp3RFP dual reporter system were analyzed on day 4. human IL-10-producing FOXP3+ CD4+, FOXP3+ CD4+, and CD8+ subsets all up-regulated both LAG3 and CD49b expression. cells were stimulated and subjected to intracellular staining. data represent results of more than three independent experiments. the importance of this work is emphasized by the need to specifically identify Foxp3 Tr1 cells. findings suggest that the use of LAG3 and CD49b should be combined with other markers to uniquely identify these cells. co-expression of LAG3, CD49b, and CD226 is sufficient to distinguish Foxp3 IL-10-producing Tr1 cells from. both LAG3 and CD49b can individually be up-regulated in activated T cells. co-expression of IL-10 production is more restricted to IL-10-producing subsets. IL-10 stimulation through autocrine and/or paracrine may induce expression of LAG3 and CD49b+ in stimulated cells. in unstimulated T cells, LAG3 is retained in the intracellular compartment. CD49b plays a critical role in cell-cell interaction and adhesion (50) the CD49b pathway activates multiple downstream effector signaling pathways, among which is the RAS/MAPK signaling cascade. parasite infection (Nb) and mite allergen (HDM) induced predominantly IL-10-producing LAG3+CD49b+ T cells that are CD4+ with very few that are CD8+. in the bacterial exposure (SR) and viral infection (Flu) models, we observed an increased proportion of IL-10+ LAG3+CD49b+ T cells that are CD8+. a more comprehensive understanding of the IL-10-producing CD8+, Foxp3CD4+ and Foxp3+CD4+ T cell subsets awaits further investigation. this finding does not negate the feasibility of utilizing co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b in marking a wider range of immunosuppressive IL-10high T cell populations. authors conceived research, designed experiments, analyzed and interpreted data. conflict of interest statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
