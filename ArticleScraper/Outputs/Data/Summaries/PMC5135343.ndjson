Xue et al. (17) reported the structure of the N-terminal substrate-bound enzyme with Leu at the P2 position. when P2 is Phe, in addition to the S2 pocket, the S3\u2032 subsite is formed to accommodate the P3\u2032 Phe. the C-terminal substrate (A) and the N-terminal substrate (B) are indicated by stick models. the P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 residues are shown in blue. the P1\u2032, P2\u2032, and P3\u2032 residues are shown in pink. the TAEDMLN loop region forms a short 310 helix in one subunit (yellow in Fig. S1B), but is not well ordered in the other subunit (red in Fig. S1B) this conversion is induced mainly by the rotation about a single bond. the binding of the P2 Phe to the S2 subsite results in formation of the S3\u2032 pocket. the conformations of the Phe (P2) and leu (P2) substrates are quite different. the C-terminal portion of the Phe (P2) substrate is bent, allowing the P3\u2032 Phe to bind to the S3\u2032 pocket. the major conformational difference of the Phe (P2) substrate is simply the rotation about the angle of the P2\u2032 residue (Fig. S5 A and I) a substrate recognition mode unique to the C-terminal autoprocessing of 3CLpro. the protease recognizes residues on the N-terminal side of the cleavage site (P1\u2013P4). the 3CLpro cleavage products could become inhibitors of 3CLpro. alternative recognition pattern (P2 = Phe/P3\u2032 = Phe) is used for the C-terminal processing of 3CLpro. after the cleavage, the P3\u2032 Phe residue is separated from the P2 Phe residue. this is the only site that uses this recognition pattern (P2 = Phe/P3\u2032 = Phe) the mature P2 = Phe enzyme (wt) shows higher proteolytic activity than the mature P2 = Leu enzyme (F305L) after cleavage at this site, the mature P2 = Phe enzyme (wt) shows higher proteolytic activity than the mature P2 = Leu enzyme (F305L) (Fig. 2E) the difference in Ki value causes an approximate twofold increase in the apparent kcat/KM (wt vs. F305L) even at low enzyme concentrations (i.e., low [I] in this experiment. the 3CLpro moiety (or NSP5) exists between two membrane proteins, NSP4 and NSP6. the local concentration of the C-terminal inhibitory sequence of 3CLpro on the endoplasmic reticulum likely would be high. this mechanism appears to exist only in the SARS-CoV 3CL protease. unbiased Fo\u2013Fc difference electron density map for omitted residues 303\u2013310 is contoured at 3.0. the unbiased Fo\u2013Fc difference electron density map for omitted residues 303\u2013310 (P4\u2013P5\u2032) is contoured at 3.0. proform (PDB ID code 2DUC) X-ray data Space group P21 P212121 Unit cell, A 52.282 63.682 B 96.317 90.237 C 67.753 110.268,\u00b0 102.90 Resolution, 1.7 2.2 Wavelength, 1.0000 1.0000 No. of observations 357,673 252,832 No. of unique reflections* 71,412 (7,113) 32,224 (3,096) Completeness, % 100.0 (99.5 the C-terminal portion of one of the subunits is bound to the active site of the subunit from an adjacent asymmetric unit. the interaction of the C-terminal portion with the adjacent molecule is facilitated by the inherent flexibility of the C-terminal heptapeptide CSGVTFQ (residues 300\u2013306; Fig. S1B), which corresponds to the P7\u2013P1 residues. structure determination statistics Statistic Mature form (PDB ID code 2DUC) Proform (PDB ID code 5B6O) X-ray data Space group P21 P212121 Unit cell, A 52.282 63.682 B 96.317 90.237 C 67.753 110.268,\u00b0 102.90 Resolution. mation is over all observed reflections, respectively. mation is calculated with random selected reflections. 3CLpro moiety is formed during protein synthesis reaction. the enzyme and the substrate were combined immediately after their synthesis. the apparent kcat/KM value (i.e., cleavability) was obtained as described previously. the enzyme and the substrate molecules synthesized by the E. coli cell-free protein synthesis method were mixed together, incubated for 1 h at 30 \u00b0C. to estimate the activity quantitatively, a series of enzyme solutions diluted by 2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-... fold was prepared before the mixing (1:1). the cleavability (i.e., apparent kcat/KM) was reduced to 1/5, by the alteration of Phe3 of the substrate to Ala/Asn (F-to-A/N) this means that the P3\u2032 position for C-terminal processing is actually recognized by the enzyme. in contrast, for N-terminal processing, the alteration of Phe3 of the substrate to Ala/Asn (F-to-A/N) did not affect position \u20131 and/or position 306 of the enzyme for autoprocessing of the N and C termini abolished the autocleavage (19). these proforms (Q\u20131N, Q306N, and Q\u20131N&Q306N) actually exhibited lower activities compared with the mature form for the C- and N-terminal processing of the wild-type substrate (Fig. 2 B and C, respectively) the substrate peptide portion of 3CLpro is shown as a surface presentation. the surface presentation of the flexible heptapeptide TAEDMLN is in orange. the surface presentation of Gln189 is in green. the positions of P2 Leu (E) and P3\u2032 Phe (F) in the N-terminal processing site on the enzyme are depicted by space-filling models. Schematic drawings of interactions between the S2 pocket/ P2 position and the S3\u2032 pocket/ P3\u2032 position. the side chains of Gln189 and Met49 are shifted outward. when Phe is in the P2 position, the side chain of Met49 lies along the side chain of the P2 Leu. the side chain of Met49 lies along the side chain of the P2 Leu. heptapeptide TAEDMLN (orange), in the C-terminal substrate sequence-bound form (A) and the N-terminal substrate sequence-bound form (B) dashed lines indicate hydrogen bonds, and associated figures indicate their distances in Angstroms. the detailed mechanisms for the formation of the S2 and S3\u2032 subsites are as follows. the binding of the P2 Phe to the S2 subsite results in formation of the S3\u2032 pocket, consisting of Thr25, His41, Cys44\u2013Ala46, Met49, Phe (P2), and Gly (P1\u2032) in both positions, CH\u2013 interactions (21) occur between the CH3 group of Met49 and the phenyl group of Phe (P2) and between the CH3 group of Ala46 and the phenyl group of Phe (P3 the dual specificity cannot be expressed as a single \u201cconsensus sequence\u201d. the logical operation between the P2 and P3\u2032 positions A (P2 = Phe\") B (P3\u2032 = Phe\") A IMP B (Cleavage\") True True False False False False False False False True A: Amino acid residue in P3\u2032 position. ase recognizes residues on the N-terminal side of the cleavage site (P1\u2013P4) so that the C-terminal portion of the cleavage site retains the main recognition sites. the 3CLpro cleavage products could become inhibitors of 3CLpro, but except for the mature 3CLpro, they can escape from the enzyme. mature enzyme with the Phe305-to-Leu alteration showed reduced cleavage activities for both the C terminus (Phe305/Phe309) and N terminus (Leu-2/Phe3). this reduced activity likely occurs because the F305L mutant has a stronger inhibitory sequence (P2 = Leu) than the wild-type enzyme (P2 = Phe) the tetrapeptide Val-Thr-Leu-Gln (P2 = Leu) had an 11-fold stronger inhibitory effect (Ki = 11.5 6.0 M) than the tetrapeptide Val-Thr-Phe-Gln (wt; P2 = Phe) (Ki = 126 42 M); this result provides further evidence of the reduced inhibitory effect of the C-terminal portion of the mature 3CLpro. difference in Ki value causes an approximate twofold increase in the apparent kcat/KM (wt vs. F305L) in this experiment. the difference in the inhibitory effect between Phe and Leu at the P2 position of the C terminus on the apparent kcat/KM must be greater in the cells. both substrates with the P2 Leu and the P2 Met likely are bound to the enzyme. the substrate with the P2 Phe should bind to the enzyme, as in the structure shown in Fig. 3A. dimerized precursor dimers can process the N termini of other precursor dimers or monomers. the results suggest that in these N-terminal processing processes, the Phe residue at the P3\u2032 position of the processing site is not required. the Phe3 phenyl group of the mature enzyme is buried in the protomer and supports the N finger. for the P2 position, TRUE means Phe, and FALSE means leu. for the P3\u2032 position, TRUE means Phe, and FALSE means Ala or Asn. for the return value, TRUE means \u201ceffective cleavage\u201d and FALSE means \u201cineffective cleavage\u201d the presence of the phenyl group prevents the enzyme from snugly interacting by itself with the entire P2 side chain. the second phenyl group of Phe at the P3\u2032 position hydrophobically participates in the interaction. the phenyl group is required for the structure of the mature enzyme after the cleavage. the phenyl group of the mature enzyme, derived from the P3\u2032 residue in the profrom, is buried in the protomer and supports the N finger (N-terminal residues 1\u20137) the cooperativity between two subsites (i.e., subsite cooperativity) revealed in the present study was not detected by conventional statistical methods. value, TRUE means \u201ceffective cleavage\u201d and FALSE means \u201cineffective cleavage\u201d. for the P2 position, FALSE means an aliphatic residue without the -branch. for the P3\u2032 position, FALSE means any residue other than Phe. type 3CLpro was modified at three points: the active site Cys145 was changed to Ala, the S-tag portion and the 10-aa extension at the N terminus were removed. the first translated methionine residue was completely removed in the E. coli cells, as determined by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. the data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using HKL2000 (24) the crystal belongs to the space group P212121, with unit cell dimensions a = 52.3, b = 96.3, and c = 67.8, and diffraction data were obtained up to 2.2- resolution. the models were rebuilt manually using O (26), and were refined with CNS (27) and PHENIX (14) the structures were refined to an R-factor of 19.4% (Rfree = 22.1%) at 1.7- resolution for SARS-3CLpro-wild type (PDB ID code 2DUC) and to an R-factor of 21.8% (Rfree = 25.9%) at 2.2- resolution for 3CLpro-C145A-10aa (PDB ID code 5B6O). KM and kcat values were calculated using tetrapeptides VTFQ (ValThrPheGln), VTLQ (ValThrLeuGln), and VTAQ (ValThrAlaGln) at 0, 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, and 2.8 mM concentrations, in 0.2 mL of a solution consisting of 1.5 M (i.e., 1/26 of the KM value) from the 9-mL cell-free synthesis solution, approximately 5.8 mg of the purified 3CLpro was obtained. the plasmid encoding wild-type 3CLpro was modified at three points. the active site Cys145 was changed to Ala. reservoir solution contained 0.1 M MES buffer (pH 5.8), 4% (wt/vol) PEG 6000, 3% (vol/vol) DMSO, and 1 mM DTT. diffraction data were collected on an ADSC Quantum210 detector. structures were refined to an R-factor of 19.4% (Rfree = 22.1%) at 1.7- resolution for SARS-3CLpro-wild type and to an R-factor of 21.8% (Rfree = 25.9%) at 2.2- resolution for 3CLpro-C145A-10aa (PDB ID code 5B6O). tetrapeptides VTFQ (ValThrPheGln), VTLQ (ValThrLeuGln) and VTAQ (ValThrAlaGln) were used at 0, 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, and 2.8 mM concentrations. the ratio of rates with/without an inhibitor tetrapeptide, v0/vi, was measured."}
