{"summary": "Objective CDC routinely conducts contact investigations involving travelers on commercial conveyances, such as aircrafts, cargo vessels, and cruise ships. the agency used established systems of communication and partnerships with other federal agencies to quickly alert contacts of potential exposure to two travelers with MERS-CoV. CDC received more than 2,000 reports annually from private and public sources of travelers who are ill or who have died during travel. a manifest order requires airlines to provide CDC with information on the index patient and the index patient's potential contacts. the time it takes for CDC to obtain the manifest varies, but information is typically received within two business days of the request for information on nonurgent cases such as TB. the primary sources used to supplement manifest data are federal databases accessed by CBP's national Targeting Center-Passenger (NTC) the mission is to provide advance antiterrorism targeting, research, and coordination within CBP and among numerous law enforcement and intelligence agencies. the transportation security administration's Secure Flight Program33 collects information on all u.s.-bound air travelers. no formal protocol is in place to provide Secure Flight Program data to CDC. protocols include evaluation of crew members when it is likely they were exposed. a passenger seated beside someone with TB for eight hours or more would be considered a contact, whereas flight crew members with brief interaction would not be considered contacts. a passenger seated beside someone with TB for eight hours or more would be considered contact. for 45 of 234 (19%) travelers, only the first and last name were provided. the airlines did not provide contact information for 1,335 of 2,500 (53%) travelers. for these international flights, CDC uses other information sources. customs declaration forms are used only in urgent investigations when other information sources are not available. the transportation security administration's Secure Flight Program33 collects information on all U.S.-bound air travelers. no formal protocol is in place to provide data to CDC during public health investigations. travelers who cannot be assigned to a U.S. or foreign jurisdiction are often not contacted. a passenger seated beside someone with TB for eight hours or more would be considered a contact, whereas flight crew members with brief interaction would not be considered contacts. the 80-passenger manifest included contact information for all but seven travelers on the flight. CDC was not notified of any passengers on the flight who needed to be contacted in the united states. all 80 travelers on the London-to-Chicago flight were notified within four days. one contact was determined to be outside of CDC jurisdiction. twelve crew members were contacted by the airline employer. bus investigation The first index patient traveled by shuttle bus from a one-hour trip to northern Indiana. CDC worked with the shuttle company to identify the driver and nine travelers on the bus. manifests are not prepared for bus travel, but credit card records were used to obtain passenger contact information. the 80-passenger manifest included contact information for all but seven travelers on the flight. CDC was not notified of any passengers who needed to be contacted in the united states at the time of the investigation. CDC was not notified of any passengers who needed to be contacted in the united states at the time of the investigation. no contact information was provided by the airline for 71 (21%) travelers on the manifest. the airline later provided additional information, including dates of birth, which improved success in searching for these travelers. eLocation of passenger at initial contact bOne person was determined to be outside of the centers for disease control and prevention's jurisdiction. 35 states or territories were involved, with a median of five contacts per state (range: 1\u201394) in total, 528 of 544 (97%) contacts were notified within five days of case confirmation. CDC uses established relationships with other federal agencies and existing notification systems to obtain contact information for travelers. use of secondary data sources has greatly improved the accuracy and completeness of traveler contact information. effectiveness can more easily be measured in the number of travelers contacted and the speed with which this contact occurred. the primary limitation of tracing travelers during a contact investigation is the incomplete contact information on passenger manifests. the lack of initial contact information for many passengers is the greatest challenge. the lack of initial contact information for many passengers is the greatest challenge. large-scale tracing of air travelers was effective in rapidly notifying jurisdictions of potentially exposed contacts. CDC recently leveraged both approaches for an Ebola contact investigation involving two commercial flights. a large-scale expansion of routine processes allowed for rapidly identifying and notifying air travelers of potential exposure."}
