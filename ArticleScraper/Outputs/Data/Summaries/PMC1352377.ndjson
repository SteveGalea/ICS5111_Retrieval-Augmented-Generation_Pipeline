{"summary": "new system ZCURVE_V has been run for 979 viral and 212 phage genomes, respectively, and satisfactory results are obtained. the average specificity of both systems is well matched, but the average sensitivity of ZCURVE_V for smaller viral genomes (100 kb) is higher than that of GeneMark. the first step in analyzing a completely or partially sequenced genome is to identify all its genes. the first step in analyzing a completely or partially sequenced genome is to identify all its genes. there are some well-known computer systems for gene-finding in bacterial and archaeal genomes. the ZCURVE system for finding protein-coding genes in bacterial and archaeal genomes developed by our group has been used in 40 laboratories or institutes all over the world. a new system specific to coronavirus genomes, ZCURVE_CoV, has been developed subsequently [11] by adapting similar algorithm of ZCURVE. a self-training system, ZCURVE_V is presented to address the problem. ZCURVE_V system has been run for 979 viral and 212 phage genome records. the default settings are adopted for all the options unless indicated otherwise. it should be noted that the RefSeq records are not provisional. a total of 30 viral genomes not annotated by GeneMark were used for the comparison. a total of 30 viral genomes not annotated by GeneMark were used for the comparison. xylostella granulovirus (PxGV, NC_002593), adoxophyes orana granulovirus (AdorGV, NC_005038), Neodiprion lecontei nucleopolyhedrovirus (FAdV-9, NC_000899), porcine adenovirus C (PAdV-5, NC_002702), citrus tristeza virus (CTV, NC_001661), citrus triste over 90% of the 979 viral and 212 phage genomes analyzed here are shorter than 100 kb. if the average is performed over all the 30 genomes, Sn and Sp are 95.7% and 93.0% for ZCURVE_V, respectively, whereas Sp and Sp are 86.2% and 92.5% for GeneMark.

SARS-CoVs belong to coronavirus and their genomes are single-stranded [17] 12 genes are found by the ZCURVE_V system. the two genes missed by it are completely or nearly completely embedded within other genes. the gene-finding performance of ZCURVE_V for the three well studied viruses is generally better than that of GeneMark. the predicted gene codes for a C4-type zinc finger protein in Stx1 and Stx2 converting bacteriophage genomes. the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by this gene is found to have a significant similarity (E-value for BLASP = 8e-15, Identities = 58%) with the lysis protein (RefSeq AC: NP_892111) found in the pseudomonas putida KT2440 genome. bacteriophage P4 Genes annotated Genes predicted by ZCURVE_V Start Stop Strand Function Start Stop Strand VZ score 247 648 + hypothetical protein 247 648 + 0.162 651 1718 + hypothetical protein 651 1718 + 0.111 1746 2540 - 0.071 2607 3926 - Integrase 2607 3926 - 0.345 __ __ __ 3954 4103 - 0.307 4096 ZCURVE_V is a self-training method and enables analyzing anonymous viral and phage genomes without any human intervention. the prediction of ZCURVE_V is more accurate than that of GeneMark for viral or phage genomes shorter than 1000 bp. genes predicted by either the ZCURVE_V system or the GeneMark VIOLIN database are finally predicted as genes. the results are listed in Table 6. it becomes a hotspot to develop an integrated genome annotation platform. joint applications of ZCURVE_V and GeneMark for the four viral genomesa Organisms CLYVV LCDV-1 TGEV YLDV Annotated genes 5 110 9 152 ZCURVE_V Annotated genes found 4 107 8 151 Additional genes found 0 5 0 5 GeneMark VIOLIN Annotated genes found 4 106 8 150 Additional genes found 0 8 0 9. a total of 979 viral and 212 phage genome records were downloaded from GenBank release 141.0 [20]. each record corresponds to a genome or a genomic segment. the predicted results of the GeneMark VIOLIN database were also downloaded before July 20, 2004. if the 'Maximum ORF' is larger than 400 bp, it is directly regarded as a seed ORF (gene) however, if the 'Maximum ORF' is less than 400 bp, it is regarded as a seed ORF only if the base composition at the second codon position meets the following equation: G2 (A2 + C2 + T2)/3 + 0.1, where A2, C2, G2 and T2 are the occurrence frequencies x i = ( a i + g i ) ( c i + t i ), y i = ( a i + c i ) ( g i + t i ), x i, y i = ( a i + c i ) ( g i + t i ), x i, y i = ( a i + c i x k X, y k X and z k X are the coordinates, X = A, C, G, T and k = 12, 23. x k X, y k X and z k X are the coordinates, X = A, C, G, T and k = 12, 23. an ORF or a fragment of DNA sequence can be represented by a point or a vector in the 33-dimensional space V. the space V is a 33-dimensional super-cube with the side length of 2. A total of 33 parameters denoted by u 1 o u 33 o are calculated according to the equation (5) for the seed ORF. coding potential index VZ is defined as VZ = D 0 2 D ( u ) 2 / ( 2 D 0 2 ) 7 where D0 is a constant called maximum Euclidean distance, whose default value is 6.90. all ORFs with VZ scores greater than 0 are regarded as possible protein-coding genes, whereas those with VZ scores less than 0 are regarded as non-coding. seed ORF is selected using a simple approach. it is found that an ORF with the largest length among all others in a genome is very likely to be a protein-coding gene. if the 'Maximum ORF' is less than 400 bp, it is regarded as a seed ORF (gene) the frequency of bases A, C, G and T occurring in an ORF or a fragment of DNA sequence with bases at positions 1, 4, 7,...; 2, 5, 8,..., and 3, 6, 9,... are actually the frequencies of bases at the 1st, 2nd and 3rd codon positions. ides AA, AC, and TT occurring at the codon positions1-2 and 2\u20133 of an ORF or a fragment of DNA sequence be denoted by p12(AA), p12(AC), p12(AC),... and p12(TT) respectively. let the 3-dimensional space V k X be spanned by x k X, y k X and z k X. the 33 components of the space V, i.e., u1, u2,..., u33, are defined as follows u 1 = x 1, u 2 = y 1, u 3 = z 1, u 4 = x 2, u 5 = y 2, u 6 = z 2, u 7 = x 3, u 8 = y 3, u 9 = z 3. the space V is a 33-dimensional super-cube with the side length of 2. A total of 33 parameters denoted by u 1 o u 33 o are calculated according to the equation (5) for the seed ORF, which corresponds to a point O in the 33-dimensional space. each ORF, which is represented by a point in the 33-dimensional space, is extracted as candidates of genes. if the VZ score of the longer ORF between the two overlapping ORFs minus a given value is still larger than that of the shorter one, it is recognized as gene, and the shorter is a non-coding one. there are three main features between the present viral gene-finding system ZCURVE_V and our previously reported bacterial gene-finding system. registered users may also download the executable version of the program ZCURVE_V. the predicted results for 979 viral and 212 phage genomes are provided through the database named DOVGZ."}
