{"summary": "at least two million people die each year from clinical complications of the disease. the most severe manifestations of Pf malaria occur as a direct result of parasitemia following invasion of erythrocytes by post-liver blood-stage merozoites. at least two million people, mostly children below the age of 5 years, die each year from clinical complications of the disease. cyto-adherence is mediated by an orchestrated set of interactions between specific regions within the ectodomain of PfEMP-1. a well-characterized host receptor that mediates cyto-adherence of most Pf isolates to the peripheral vasculature is human CD36 (Ockenhouse et al., 1989) the CIDR1 domain primarily binds to CD36 and to members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, including IgM and CD31/PECAM. the DBL2 domain mainly binds to CD31/PECAM-1. recent studies have revealed that erythrocyte invasion and cyto-adherence represent essential evolutionary strategies for parasite growth, survival, and persistence. KS occurs in at least four epidemiological forms, each with its own distinctive clinical disposition determined by age, sex, geographical location, socio-economic status, previous exposure to parasitic infections, co-infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and the extent of acquired or iatrogenic immunosuppression. KS occurs in at least four epidemiological forms, each with its own distinguishing clinical disposition determined by age, sex, geographical location, socio-economic status. eKS is currently the most common cancer in adult east and central africa men. eKS follows only cervical and breast cancer in adult women. cKS and eKS are generally not associated with an immunosuppressed state. cKS affects young, immunocompetent individuals. etiology suggests walking barefoot allows soil-borne aluminosilicates, iron oxides, and other clay minerals to be taken up through sweat glands and abrasions by resident macrophages. the resulting chronic lymphatic irritation, inflammation, and immune suppression could in turn support primary infection through these portals. KS is one of the most prevalent childhood cancers in malaria-endemic areas. the incidence of KS displays a considerable degree of geographic variation that mirrors the prevalence of its causative agent. KS incidence is particularly high in sub-Saharan Africa, a region with one of the highest rates of malaria deaths. a molecular link between KS and malaria has not been rigorously examined at a micro level. the role of malaria as a co-factor for eKS has been hypothesized based on the potential of the Anopheles mosquito vector to contribute to person-to-person spread of KSHV. this would then create a local permissive environment for KSHV infection. expression of the major KSHV replication and transcription activator (RTA) is essential for virus replication and dissemination. it is dependent on activation of p38 and extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) mitogen-activated protein kinase. the two viruses can co-exist as latent episomes in certain peripheral effusion lymphoma-derived cell lines. they also display similarities not only in the mechanism of induction of the lytic cycle but also in the distribution of endemic cancers associated with them in regions of high malaria endemicity. new evidence suggests that the exit from latency to the viraemic state that supports eBL development may be impacted at a molecular level by the replicative blood-stage form of the parasite life cycle. the mechanism by which conjugation of pRBC-expressing pRBC with EBV-infected B cells triggers virus replication remains to be elucidated. helical heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) derived from KSHV entry glycoprotein B (gB) also upregulated CD36 expression. effect of these helical peptides could be blocked by a monoclonal antibody to CD36. melanoma-derived Mel1700 cells were seeded in a six-well plate. cells were either left untreated or pre-incubated with 10 g/ml of anti-CD36 antibody clone FA6-152. cells were incubated with either 100 g/ml of KSHV gB-derived HR1, 200 g/ml HR2 peptide or 2 mM sodium butyrate (NaB) a previously unrecognized mechanism by which KSHV lytic replication could be induced in the context of a Pf malaria co-infection. this model provides many new opportunities for experimental examination of the ability of parasite-derived antigens to reactivate KSHV during cyto-adherence on the surface of infected blood endothelial cells and within tissues and organs. PfEMP-1 interacts with its cognate epitope within the ectodomain of CD36 on the surface of microvascular endothelial cells. this interaction activates one or more of the Src-like kinases, which in turn initiate a phosphorylation cascade that results in p38 and ERK/MAPK activation. this process culminates in activation of a cellular transcription factor, likely AP-1 (dimer of c CD36 has never been directly associated with KSHV pathogenesis. but some of its pleiotropic functions are consistent with its potential contribution to the basic pathobiology of KSHV. the role of TSP-1 in this context is relevant, given that TSP-1 is present in high concentrations in human saliva. it is also anticipated that isolation of polymorphisms in CD36 may open up additional opportunities for population-level studies aimed at explaining the overlapping distribution of KS, Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma, and malaria. KSHV-encoded microRNAs can directly target TSP-1 mRNA for degradation. the angiostatic signal is associated with viral lytic replication while the angiogenic phenotype is linked to the latency phase. the angiogenic phenotype is linked to the latency phase. in vivo, these dichotomous effects are consistent with promotion of angiogenesis, invasion, and tumor metastasis in disease-relevant cell types. ET-1 is a pro-angiogenic peptide secreted by the vascular endothelium and its deregulation is implicated in the pathogenesis of many malignancies. ET-1 receptor blockade limited KS cell invasion in an in vivo tumor growth model. SHV could establish long-term persistence by establishing a state of limited CD36-dependent viral reactivation or reduce CD36-dependent cyto-adherence. the latter outcome might be associated with an increase in the likelihood for parasite access to the extra-peripheral organs such as the brain, which may elevate the probability of cerebral malaria. mutations in CD36 \u2013 a molecule that is important for parasite persistence \u2013 cause a deficiency that does not alter malaria pathogenesis. the mutations and their phenotypes occur at high frequency in malaria-endemic areas with a high prevalence of viruses associated with endemic cancers. the impact of such a genetic influence can only be measured against the host\u2019s ability to restrict virus replication and dissemination. signaling events transduced through CD147 are associated with survival, metastasis, and invasion of a variety of cancer cells. CD147 stimulates enhanced stromal release of multiple matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which are among the key mediators of angiogenesis and metastatic transition. de novo KSHV infection of human endothelial cells results in upregulated expression of CD147. two recent reports showed that KSHV-induced endo-MT was dependent on the activity of membrane-type-1 MMP. this is consistent with a role for CD147 in endo-MT since MT1-MMP is a CD147-stimulated endopeptidase involved in extracellular matrix remodeling. anti-human CD147 (neurothelin) antibody can potently block KSHV fusion. it is consistent with existence of CD147 in the membrane of KSHV-permissive cells as part of a molecular supercomplex. xCT/CD98hc complex confers resistance to some chemotherapeutic drugs. the intrinsic resistance of KSHV-positive peripheral effusion lymphomas to the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel and doxorubicin depends on orchestrated interactions of CD147 with lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor 1 (LYVE-1) and the homodimeric ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-G2/BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein) drug transporter that is highly expressed on the surface of primary effusion lymphoma (PEL)-derived cell a first-line experimental testing of such a concept should seek to determine whether blood-borne merozoites or soluble forms of PfRh5 can indeed bind CD147 on KSHV-infected cells. in Figure 5, we highlight some of the important nodes of intersection between KSHV and the malaria parasite in endothelial cells and skin-derived melanoma cells. structural mimics of MC179 can also induce virus reactivation in a CD36-dependent manner. in lymphatic (LEC) and other endothelial cells, KSHV upregulates CD147 but unlike in Melanoma cells, the virus downregulates both CD36 and its angiostatic ligand, TSP-1. these effects are likely to promote angiogenesis, invasion, and tumor metastasis. a strictly HAART-based approach to KS management frustrates efforts. the benefits of HAART are not long-lasting and end up being more detrimental to many patients with advanced KS. the probability of recrudescence of KS in patients treated with HAART later in life is unpredictable. artesunate has anti-angiogenic effects on KS-derived endothelial cells. if adopted as such, the promise of its dual use for KS is attractive for co-infected individuals. artesunate is already well tolerated as an anti-malarial drug. more than half of the world\u2019s population still lives in areas where there is a risk of contracting the disease. lack of practical and affordable animal models would be valuable for evaluating the efficacy of drug and vaccine candidates. ant aspects of PfRh5 and other \u201caccessible\u201d Pf antigens may result in a more meaningful outcome associated with minimal impact on the human host. pathogen-centered approaches could be used alone or in conjunction with the RTS,S vaccine that is based on the most prominent surface antigen of the pre-liver sporozoite stage. however, the primary goal of any given approach would be to elicit the safest, most long-lasting and most efficacious outcome that recent advances have revealed a surprising node of intersection between KSHV and malaria pathogenesis at the level of the molecular controls that regulate the persistence of these highly successful infectious agents. erythrocyte invasion and cyto-adherence have illustrated the extent to which Pf can exert its impact on human physiology; and alterations in the expression and function of the host receptors that support these processes. induced downregulation of CD36 could effectively alter the overall disease burden by limiting peripheral sequestration. this could in turn increase parasitic access to the central nervous system, leading to a higher probability for cerebral malaria. a syndemic link reveals a co-evolutionary paradigm centered at the putative dueling role of CD36 as a mediator of parasite sequestration on one hand. increased binding of PfEMP-1 to upregulated CD36 leads to virus reactivation. new research emphasis should include the important goal of developing practical in vivo platforms that could facilitate systematic, experimental integration of population studies. conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
