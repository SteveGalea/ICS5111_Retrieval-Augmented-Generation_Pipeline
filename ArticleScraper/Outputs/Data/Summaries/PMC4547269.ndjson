{"summary": "MERS is a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) it has been responsible for over 1,300 human infections and 500 deaths since its discovery in 2012. eight studies report a correlation between exposure to extreme weather events and undernutrition. other factors examined include temperature, cultivated land area, crop yield, and the effects of household size, socioeconomic status, and demographic variables. the authors demonstrated targeted nucleotide replacement with up to 20% efficiency in PD1. the short-lived Cas9 RNPs are typically degraded 24 hours after delivery into cells. they may be safer than approaches that expose cells to Cas9 for long periods in strategies aimed at engineering primary human T cells. the master gene regulator hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 traced the pathway that leads from drug-induced activation of HIF-1 to BCSC formation. glutathione caused FoxO3, a transcription factor, to localize to the nucleus and activate a set of genes encoding pluripotency factors, which induce the BCSC phenotype. gene expression analysis identified several genes that were conversely regulated in wild-type and mutant mice. of these, three genes\u2014Nppa, Sln, and Myl4\u2014were found to be implicated in cellular pathways tied to calcium regulation, heart contraction, and blood circulation, likely explaining the superior cardiac function in the mutant mice under severe hypoxia."}
