{"summary": "the emergence of these viruses and other biothreat agents has raised world concerns for their use in biowarfare/bioterrorism. active immunization in which a vaccine is administered to elicit a protective immune response is generally the desired therapeutic goal. passive immunization in which specific antibodies are administered is generally the desired therapeutic goal. pBAD_ZF was constructed using pBAD/gIII as the starting plasmid. the final product vector, pBAD_ZF, was used for cloning and expression of antibody light and heavy chains. each mouse was initially dosed with 1 104 plaque forming units (pfu) of live virus by the intraperitoneal route on days 0, 14 and 28. cDNA libraries were constructed using the BD SMARTTM kit. cDNA encoding heavy chain antibody domains was amplified using 11 VH forward primers and a kappa reverse primer from oligonucleotide sequences described in Essono et al. pBAD_Fab_ZF was transformed into high efficiency XL1-Blue cells. plasmids were isolated and transformed into rosettagamiTM (DE3) competent cells. a library stock of these transformed expression host cells was stored in 10% glycerol at 70\u00b0C. DNA display Magnetic Dynal beads were labeled using 1 mg/ml antigen. 100 l of these beads were washed with 2 fresh sonication buffer. supernatant was removed and supernatant containing the eluted plasmids was removed. cells in 96-well plates were pelleted by centrifugation for 20 min at 4000 r.p.m. cells were sonicated for 1 min in an ice-bath chilled microplate horn. lysate added directly onto an antigen-coated 96-well ELISA plate. ase, 100 l of SureBlueTM TMB (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was added and incubated for 1 h. 1 M phosphoric acid was added to stop the reaction, and absorbance at OD 450 nm measured using a SpectroMax Plus spectrophotometer. Flow cytometric analysis SARS-CoV spike protein was labeled with biotin. 4 nM spike protein was added to various concentrations of Fabs or IgGs. spike protein\u2013antibody solution was incubated at room temperature for 45 min. a polyclonal rabbit serum was used as a positive control and diluent as a negative control with each set of samples tested. Approximately 100 pfu SARS-CoV in 100 l of EMEM media was added to an equal volume of diluted antibodies and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. fragment libraries were constructed based on the human germline immunoglobulin heavy and light chain variable domains (VH and VL) and human variable domains that have been through the natural, immunological maturation process. for each FR, several fragments were designed to represent the diversity seen among natural FRs. gene site saturation mutagenesis was performed using 32-fold degenerate oligonucleotides to randomize each codon in the CDR regions so that all possible amino acids would be encoded. the mutated DNA pool was transformed into XL1-Blue cells and all possible variants for each site were identified by sequence analysis. biacore analysis The kinetics of the human and chimera antibodies were tested using surface plasmon resonance technology on a Biacore 2000. each antibody was captured onto the sensor surface using an anti-human IgG antibody at the desired level of 200 RU. presenting dose was calculated by multiplying the total volume (Vt) of experimental atmosphere inhaled (Vt = Vm length of exposure) by the aerosol concentration (Ce) the inhaled dose was 293 pfu based on the concentration of the virus in the aerosol and predicted volume of air that each mouse inhaled in 10 min. each mouse was initially dosed with 1 104 plaque forming units (pfu) of live virus by the intraperitoneal route on days 0, 14 and 28. the same dose of -irradiated virus on day 47 ranged from 1:25 600 to 1:409 600. pBAD_Fab_ZF was transformed into high efficiency XL1-Blue cells. plasmids were isolated and transformed into rosettagamiTM (DE3) competent cells. DNA display Magnetic Dynal beads were labeled using 1 mg/ml antigen. 100 l of these beads were washed with 2 fresh sonication buffer. supernatant was removed and supernatant was removed. 100\u2013500 colonies were selected and placed into 96-well plates containing 0.2 ml LB-Carb. cells were grown for 16 h, then diluted 50\u2013100-fold into 1 ml LB-Carb. cells were sonicated for 1 min in an ice-bath chilled microplate horn. 100 l/well rat anti-mouse kappa light chain antibody conjugated to peroxidase was added and incubated for 1 h. 100 l of SureBlueTM TMB (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. 1 M phosphoric acid was added to stop the reaction. Flow cytometric analysis SARS-CoV spike protein was labeled with biotin using the Biotin Protein Labeling kit. the spike protein\u2013antibody solution was incubated at room temperature for 45 min and then incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. eptavidin\u2013phycoerythrin cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. the cells were washed 3 (PBS), resuspended in 500 l PBS. a polyclonal rabbit serum was used as a positive control. dsDNA CDR fragments were created by annealing synthetic oligoucleotides encoding the mouse sequences. oligos were designed to leave single stranded overhangs on both sides. fragment libraries were constructed based on the human germline immunoglobulin heavy and light chain variable domains. eight light chains were designed and synthesized in addition to the reassembly library. each of these chains represents one of the eight sequence clusters identified in the bioinformatic analysis. gene site saturation mutagenesis was performed as described previously. one ELISA was a functional ELISA using the spike protein as the antigen following the protocol described above. the secondary antibody was an anti-human kappa antibody conjugated to peroxidase (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) the second ELISA measured the relative amount of antibody expressed. presenting dose was calculated by multiplying the total volume (Vt) of experimental atmosphere inhaled (Vt = Vm length of exposure) by the aerosol concentration (Ce) based on the concentration of the virus in the aerosol and the predicted volume of air each mouse inhaled in 10 min. fusion protein\u2013plasmid complex was found to be extremely stable by Biacore analysis. tests were done to ensure that no plasmid switching occurred at this time. multiple separate screens were performed using Dynal beads coated with the spike protein, whole viral isolates, and infected cell lysates as antigens. data from one ELISA plate shows the recovery rate of SARS-reactive antibodies from the screen was 10\u201315%. twenty-eight of these antibodies bound to the spike protein with 3-fold or greater activity than background. all antibodies were added at a 12 nM concentration with the exception of (D) which was at 8 nM. Listed % represents the % of cells following in the defined gate. these three antibodies retained their ability to block spike protein binding to the vero E6 cells. italicized rows represent antibodies that exhibited spike-blocking activity in the flow cytometric assay. HuFRTM technology was used to convert the mouse variable region sequences of the 4049Fab14 antibody to human antibody sequences. the top 10 antibody variants from the heavy chain library were normalized to the relative expression of antibody variant. the specific activity for each antibody was further normalized to the wild-type control antibody (WT: chimeric antibody, 4049Fab14). one of the humanized clones (61G4) achieved 80% neutralization of the SARS virus at a 3.5\u20134-fold lower concentration compared to the mouse\u2013human chimera (WT) and a second humanized clone (61H4) was equal to WT. clones not shown in Fig. 4C had 80% neutralization capabilities less than wild-type (WT) each of these amino acids was individually mutated to all other possible codons in the backbone of the mouse\u2013human chimera. the total number of plates screened for the 67 amino acids found in the CDR regions was 34 \u201896-well plates\u2019 (1350 clones) these antibodies were screened in the same functional and quantitative ELISAs as the framework reassembly screen. for each antibody was normalized to the wild-type (WT) control antibody. the number of plaques resulting in 50 and 80% neutralization is noted. a new library was constructed to place all combinations of positive or neutral single point mutations into the backbone of the framework reassembly clones. four different point mutations were chosen from the light chain and a single mutation from the heavy chain (49B9) the total library size was 64 possible combinations. the top 10 performers all had 1.75-fold or better binding activity when compared to the WT chimera. the best antibody (i.e. 2978/10) achieved 80% neutralization at an 8-fold lower concentration than the WT chimera. those variants with equal ability to the WT antibody are not shown. mice were necropsied and lungs taken for viral isolation. at a dose of 15 mg/kg, replication of SARS-CoV in the lung was reduced to 15 000-fold. several animals showed no evidence of SARS virus in the lung. the fusion protein\u2013plasmid complex was found to be extremely stable by Biacore analysis. tests were done to ensure that no plasmid switching occurred at this time. multiple separate screens were performed using Dynal beads coated with the spike protein, whole viral isolates, and infected cell lysates as antigens. fusion proteins analyzed in an ELISA using spike protein as a capture reagent on 48 wells of a 96-well Maxisorp plates. bovine serum albumin coated on the remaining 48 wells was used to determine specificity of binding. six of the 28 candidates inhibited binding of the spike protein to vero E6 cells. the purified antibodies were tested in plaque reduction neutralization tests using a live SARS virus on the permissive Vero E6 cell line. the results are summarized in Table I and showed five antibodies exhibiting 50% neutralization activity at concentrations ranging from 0.59 to 21 g/ml. italicized rows represent antibodies that exhibited spike-blocking activity in the flow cytometric assay. HuFRTM technology was used to convert the mouse variable region sequences of the 4049Fab14 antibody to human antibody sequences. the random combination of all the possible heavy and light chains results in 62 720 combinations. the top 10 antibody variants from the heavy chain library were normalized to the relative expression of antibody variant. the specific activity for each antibody was further normalized to the wild-type control antibody (WT: chimeric antibody, 4049Fab14). a humanized clone (61G4) achieved 80% neutralization of the SARS virus at a 3.5\u20134-fold lower concentration compared to the mouse\u2013human chimera (WT) and a second humanized clone (61H4) was equal to WT. clones not shown in Fig. 4C had 80% neutralization capabilities less than wild-type (WT) the total number of plates screened for the 67 amino acids found in the CDR regions was 34 \u201896-well plates\u2019 (1350 clones) these antibody variants were screened in the same functional and quantitative ELISAs as the framework reassembly screen. these clones (24%) exhibited a specific activity when normalized to the mouse\u2013human chimera 1.0. the number of plaques resulting in 50 and 80% neutralization is noted. Statistical analysis at the approximate WT antibody concentration for 80% neutralization indicates better neutralization (i.e. fewer plaques) for 51E7 and 52G3 (P 0.02 and P 0.03, respectively) the total library size was 64 possible combinations. the top 10 performers all had 1.75-fold or better binding activity compared to the WT chimera. the best antibody (i.e. 2978/10) achieved 80% neutralization at an 8-fold lower concentration than the WT antibody. the variant contained the two mutations from the top two individual clones (51E7 and 52G3) placed in the light chain framework exhibiting the best activity (61G4). replication of SARS-CoV in the lung was reduced to 15 000-fold. several animals showed no evidence of SARS virus in the lung. bP 0.008 compared to control. despite significant successes, there are some limitations to this approach. for ribosome display, the limitation is that proteins are made entirely in vitro. for in vivo production, we made functional Fabs in specific strains. the method could probe any protein\u2013protein or protein\u2013nucleic acid interactions in vivo, unlike a phage display screen. the entire library can be screened in half the time (1.5 days compared to three days) the framework library sequences were designed so that the same set of sequences can be used to ligate to the CDR regions of any antibody in which humanization is desired. the significant disadvantage to this approach is that for each antibody, a whole new set of PCR primers needs to be designed. a haloalkane dehalogenase was increased by 30 000-fold when combining eight single-point mutations. of the eight mutations, three required multiple base pair changes at each codon. the chance of finding these mutations using error-prone PCR would be exceedingly rare. 2978/10 was shown to inhibit viral replication in the lungs of aged mice at a dose of 15 mg/kg. this dose is similar to that required for Palivizumab, an anti-RSV therapy currently being used in humans. the timeline for identification of novel specific antibodies is rapid."}
