{"summary": "government agencies and policymakers have called for enhancing citizens\u2019 and communities\u2019 resilience to prepare populations in advance of disasters. resilience can be defined as the capacity of a community to recover from disasters and from other problems, such as violence and economic downturns. resilience can be defined as the capacity of a community to recover from disasters and from other problems. the next phase to advance resilience will require greater focus on factors that contribute to field building, and within that, the development of a resilience-oriented workforce. this paper takes a resilience field building perspective to workforce development\u2014aiming to connect fragmented professions around the challenge of creating resilient communities. the paper arose out of discussions at the Resilience Roundtable [8]. participants underscored many of the challenges facing the development of a robust workforce that can address the need for more transdisciplinary and integrated action. actors from different disciplines need to work together to create new conceptual, methodological, and translational innovations that integrate and move beyond discipline-specific approaches. the literature search identified a total of 281 articles. after removal of duplicate articles, 230 remained. a total of 32 articles were available for full text review. the articles spanned a variety of study types, including needs assessments of existing workforce, program evaluations, and reviews/commentaries. the articles spanned a variety of study types, including needs assessments of existing workforce, and program evaluations. five principles to integrate behavioral health services in the public health disaster response plan which use a strengths-based approach to prioritize resilience. highlights the importance of context, collaboration, and coordination; recognize the unique needs of pediatric populations. Disaster Preparedness/Response Health Nurses Presentation of Workforce Training Program Training Workforce development and nurse preparedness for schools of nursing. a framework for \u201cdisaster health\u201d, which included: (1) primary disciplines; (2) support disciplines; (3) community response, resilience, and communication. public health emergency simulation exercise Describes a public health emergency simulation exercise with undergraduate senior nursing students enrolled in a public health clinical course. a majority of nationally certified EMT-Basics and paramedics reported participating in both individual and multiagency disaster-preparedness training. nurses who were confident were more likely to have had actual prior experience in disasters or shelters. achora and Kamanyire 2016 disaster preparedness/response health nurses review/Commentary training highlights the current state of nursing education and training. organizations exhibited a reluctance to share confidential information. this resulted in multiple organizations requesting information from grieving families. some of the most successful activities during that recovery rested on years of relationship and trust building. some of the most successful activities rested on years of relationship and trust building. ness workforce individuals in disaster preparedness and response must be set up to integrate human and infrastructure systems sectors. private lawyers, in addition to public attorneys, have a role to play to protect citizens when dealing with public health emergencies, particularly in the areas of liability insurance, sick leave, compensation policies, on-call requirements of health care professionals. IPE for the resilience-oriented workforce needs to be much more interdisciplinary than is currently in practice. there is a need to integrate health sciences with urban planning and engineering education for resilience. one that comes close is the framework for \u201cdisaster health\u201d set forth by the world association for disaster and emergency medicine. training and professional education programs can be competency-based, which have proven effective in other fields, such as public health preparedness [43]. competency-based competencies may include community outreach and engagement, decision making under uncertainty, holistic planning, and asset identification. a resilience-oriented workforce must balance decisions and tradeoffs. lack of organizational familiarity has been cited as a barrier for effective partnerships. lack of organizational familiarity has been cited as a barrier for effective partnerships between public health and emergency management agencies and local academic institutions. examples may include coalitions, public-private partnerships, integrated data systems, multi-sector planning bodies, and community advisory boards. a clear need for such structures was demonstrated in the response to the 11 September terrorist attack on the world trade center. some of the most successful activities during that recovery rested on years of relationship and trust building. a few articles highlighted the role of non-health and emergency preparedness workforce individuals in disaster preparedness and response. a few articles highlighted the role of non-health and emergency preparedness workforce individuals in disaster preparedness and response. the literature review identified several elements of training that could support resilience education. IPE for the resilience-oriented workforce needs to be much more interdisciplinary than is currently in practice. there is a need to integrate health sciences with urban planning and engineering education for resilience. one that comes close is the framework for \u201cdisaster health\u201d set forth by the world association for disaster and emergency medicine (WADEM) [39] training and professional education programs are needed to help resilience-oriented professionals expand their skill sets over time and adapt to the evolving needs of the community they serve. training and professional education programs can be competency-based, which have proven effective in other fields, such as public health preparedness [43] a study assessed the role of a volunteer workforce and found that volunteers in private organizations are willing to assist in disasters and have skills they can be used as part of disaster mitigation. we did not find any existing leadership models with a resilience orientation. instead, we describe what resilience-oriented leadership looks like and elements that would be critical to include in a model. the literature to date has identified a preliminary set of competencies that will be needed, as well as a starting point for a conceptual framework for educational programs for \u201cdisaster health\u201d despite the recognition that resilience development will need disciplinary understanding across a range of human and infrastructure sectors. the Workforce Field Building Hub is meant to be a systems-building initiative. it brings together leaders from across the interdisciplinary and diverse local and national workforce community to identify common issues and solutions. a similar type of approach could help to develop and sustain the new resilience-oriented workforce. research will need to collect and synthesize data to support metrics to evaluate the development of a resilience-oriented workforce. a resilience-oriented workforce spans many disciplines and requires a collaborative model that promotes information sharing structures. leadership models should foster a balance between workforce autonomy and operation as a collective entity. a workforce that appreciates resilience thinking will need to become better versed in the intersection of human systems and infrastructure systems integration."}
