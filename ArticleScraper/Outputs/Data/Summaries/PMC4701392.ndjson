{"summary": "-Crystallin and argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) are homologous proteins. they share about 70% amino acid sequence identity and function as homotetramers. each monomer consists of three domains. tetrameric -crystallin is unfolded via a multistep pathway. the dimeric form is transiently detected during this unfolding/refolding process. the assembly of two dimers acts as a kinetic barrier in the refolding pathway. the interaction of E267 with Y158 at the dimer interface was found to stabilize the quaternary structure of -crystallin in a cooperative manner. a marked hysteresis was observed during the refolding of 5 M GdmCl denatured -crystallin. the presence of stable intermediate during unfolding of K315A mutant protein was not observed. the effects of this interaction on the folding pathway of wild-type and mutant proteins were investigated using urea as a denaturant. the different distributions of dissociated component from wild-type and mutant proteins suggest the quaternary structure dissociates in different ways for wild-type and mutant proteins. the eluted protein was pooled and treated with ammonium sulfate to 1.2 M. the retained proteins were eluted at 0.3 M ammonium sulfate. the experiments were carried out by overnight incubation of -crystallin in 1.5 M urea at 25\u00b0C. the refolding experiments were carried out by dilution of the denatured monomeric -crystallin into a solution containing 1.5 M urea and 0.8, 3 or 5 M GdmCl. data analysis The transition region in Fig 2B for the reversible dissociation of K315A mutant -crystallin in urea solution was analyzed using the following method. changes in average emission wavelength (AEW) of tryptophan fluorescence are represented as a function of GdmCl (A) and urea (B) concentration. labels of () and () represent the unfolding and refolding of wild-type and K315A mutant protein, respectively. R T + exp ( G 1 0 m 1 [ D ] + G 2 0 m 2 [ D ] + G 3 0 m 3 [ D ] ) / R T + exp ( G 1 0 m 1 [ D ] + G 2 0 m 2 [ D ] ) / R T (2) where yI1 and yI2 are the signals in the I1 and I2 states. fluorescence spectra were measured on a Perkin-Elmer LS-50 luminescence spectrophotometer at 25\u00b0C. all spectra were corrected for buffer or denaturant absorption. the ANS (1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid) was used as probe to bind with proteins. the radial scans were recorded with a time interval of 7-min and a step size of 0.003 cm. all data were fitted to the continuous c(s) distribution model and a continuous size-distribution with respect to frictional ratio (f/fo) model. the partial specific volume of the protein, solvent density and viscosity were calculated using the SEDNTERP program. data for the linear increase in signals was fitted to a linear equation using SigmaPlot 10. Thioflavin T assay The assay was performed by setting the excitation wavelength at 440 nm and measuring the emission spectrum from 460 to 600 nm. proteins unfolded in denaturant were diluted into 50 mM Tris-acetic acid buffer (pH 7.5) to give 0.05 mg/ml of protein in the presence of thioflavin T (ThT) protein production and purification The recombinant wild-type and the K315A mutant -crystallin or A-crystallin plasmid were transformed and over-expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) with induction by isopropyl--D-thiogalactopyranoside. the supernatants of crude cell extracts were loaded onto a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column (HiPrep 16/10 Q X -terminal His6 tag were purified on Ni affinity column (Chelating Sepharose FF, GE Healthcare) then desalted using a Sephadex G-25 column (26 mm x 12 cm) as previously reported [11]. refolding experiments were carried out by overnight incubation of -crystallin with various concentrations of urea or GdmCl in 50 mM Tris-acetic acid buffer. y 0 = ( y n + m f [ D ] ) + ( y u + m u [ D ] ) exp ( - ( G u 0 - m [ D ] ) / 1 + exp ( - ( G u 0 - m [ D ] ) / R T ) where y is the observed signal from tryptophan fluorescence, yn and yu are the the protein concentrations used in the assays were 0.03, 0.2 and 0.1 mg/mL. the unfolding curve from tryptophan fluorescence was analyzed using a four-state unfolding model described as the transition from N to U with two intermediates, I1 and I2, in the process. yI1 and yI2 are the signals in the I1 and I2 states. m1, m2 and m3 are the variation in the free energy of unfolding with the GdmCl concentration. a molar absorption coefficient of 2.44 x 103 M-1cm-1 was used for all calculations. circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter at 25\u00b0C. experiments were performed in 20 mM Tris-acetic acid buffer (pH 7.5) with a 1 mm path-length over a wavelength range from 200 to 250 nm. all spectra were averaged from three accumulations and were buffer corrected. electrophoresis was carried out at 10 mA and 15\u00b0C for 400 Vh. gel was fixed in 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. all measurements were carried out at 25\u00b0C. the structural model was used as a template to build the K315A mutant model using the build mutant protocol. the best scoring model conformation was selected for energy minimization. equilibrated models were submitted to MD simulations for 100 ps at NVT. unfolding of the wild-type and K315A mutant protein follows a multistep process in urea solution. dilution of 3.5 or 4 M urea denatured wild-type -crystallin or 6 M urea denatured K315A mutant protein did not result in the restoration of the properly folded conformation. a dramatic increase in fluorescence was observed at around 3 M and 1 M urea. the highest signals occurred around 2 and 5 M urea for the mutant and wild-type protein. dilution of the 2.5 M urea denatured mutant protein resulted in restoration of a native-like conformation. the size and size-and-shape changes of wild-type and K315A mutant protein in different urea concentrations were determined by sedimentation velocity measurements. in the absence of urea, the two proteins appeared as one major component with sedimentation coefficients about 8.5 and 8.4 S. denatured wild-type protein at 3.5 M urea resulted in refolding into one major component with an S value of 8.1. around 25% activity was recovered following refolding. a single peak with an S value of 4.5 was observed for the mutant protein at 1.5 M urea. the monomers were reassembled into a similar quaternary structure of wild-type protein after removing the urea. refolded protein showed around 80% ASL activity was recovered. monomeric -crystallin was incubated in 1.5 M urea before introducing varied GdmCl concentration. labels of () and () represent the unfolding and refolding of monomeric K315A mutant protein, respectively. the results suggest the conformation of the partly unfolded intermediate could affect the folding reversibility of the monomeric K315A mutant -crystallin. signal changes in the tryptophan fluorescence with different urea concentration were used to calculate the thermodynamic parameters by directly fitted to the two-state mechanism (Eq 1). the quaternary structure of K315A mutant protein was recovered from the denatured monomers instantly after dilution. dilution of 5 M GdmCl denatured wild-type -crystallin showed no detectable activity. no protein aggregation was detected upon dilution of 0.84, 3 and 5 M GdmCl denatured monomeric mutant protein into buffer containing 1.5 M urea. however, when 0.84 and 3 M GdmCl denatured monomeric mutant protein was diluted into buffer, no aggregation occurred. the label of () represents refolding of 0.84 M GdmCl denatured monomers by dilution with buffer including A-crystallin. the protein concentrations of monomeric K315A and A-crystallin used in the assays were 0.1 and 0.5 mg/mL. distances between the C of D237 and R182, R302 and E330 and the two A315 residues were measured to evaluate the extent for subunit dissociation between the A-C, A-D and A-B dimeric pairs. these interactions are lost on replacement of K315 with A315. tryptophan fluorescence was used to monitor conformational changes during the unfolding process in the microenvironment around the tryptophan residues. there are two tryptophan residues, W74 and W169, in the structure of -crystallin. they are located in the solvent accessible domain 1 and helix bundle of domain 2, respectively. natured mutant protein was able to refold into a conformation similar to the original state. dilution of 3.5 or 4 M urea denatured wild-type -crystallin or 6 M urea denatured K315A mutant protein did not result in the restoration of the properly folded conformation. mutant protein denatured in 3.5 and 2.5 M urea were diluted to final 0.6 and 0.3 M urea. mutant protein denatured in 50 mM Tris-acetic acid buffer, pH 7.5, were shown as dark gray peaks. the protein concentration used in all assays was 0.2 mg/mL. K315A protein dissociated in 1.5 M urea was diluted to final of 0.26 M urea in 50 mM Tris-acetic acid buffer. at 2.5 M urea two components were observed for wild-type protein with sedimentation coefficients about 6.6 and 3.2 S. the proportion of the second (monomeric) peak increased from 6% to 27% to 60% in the presence of 2.5, 3.0 to 3.5 M urea. mutant protein was unfolded in 1.5 M urea for overnight followed by addition of 5 M GdmCl and incubation for 2 hrs. then, the protein was diluted 40-fold and incubated for overnight before activity measurement. d no detectable activity. monomeric protein lost about 30 and 55% of secondary structures at 1 and 3 M GdmCl. changes in tryptophan fluorescence were correlated with exposure of hydrophobic areas. the protein concentrations used in the assays were 0.03, 0.1 and 0.1 mg/mL for (A), (B) and (C), respectively. dilution of monomeric K315A mutant protein denatured in 5 M GdmCl resulted in refolding to a similar conformation as the original monomeric state. however, dilution of 1 and 3 M GdmCl denatured monomeric protein resulted in the increasing of the 0.4 2.3 0.1 3.9 0.1 a The reversible dissociation process was described as a two-state transition from the conversion of the tetramer (T) to monomeric intermediate (M) the data were fitted to a 4-state unfolding model (Eq 2) described as the transition from M to U. the quaternary structure of K315A mutant protein was recovered from the denatured monomers instantly after dilution. the amount of the assembled protein was increased with the incubation time possessing about 60% of the activity recovered. the similar result was also shown for 5 M GdmCl denatured wild-type -crystallin. monomeric K315A mutant -crystallin was incubated in 1.5 M urea. the label represents refolding of 0.84, 3 and 5 M GdmCl denatured monomers by dilution with buffer including A-crystallin. the results suggest the possible formation of ordered aggregates. no changes in the signal were observed during the incubation period upon refolding of 5 M GdmCl denatured monomeric mutant protein. the results suggest a different disassembly process for tetrameric wild-type and mutant proteins. Fig 7. Molecular dynamics simulations. type and mutant protein showed similar and not reversible denaturation in the presence of GdmCl. differences in the denaturation pathway were observed when urea was used as the denaturant. however, the non-covalent interactions between the intra and inter-subunits might be disrupted by the ionic character of GdmCl. the dissociated monomers seem to refold into alternative conformations then re-associate into tetramers with only part of the catalytic activity recovered. it is interesting that the interactions provided by K315 at the interfaces seem to affect the disassembly pathway of the quaternary structure of wild-type protein. dissociation at the interfaces of two primary dimers would be expected to occur at the initial stage. the simulation result provides a novel pattern for dissociation of the double dimeric protein compared to diagonal dimers. intermediates of the mutant protein resulted in the aggregates (A1 and A2) formation and the chaperone function of A-crystallin was invalid in this process. the monomers that reversible dissociated from wild-type -crystallin were in a molten globule conformation. aggregate formation occurs during reassembly process from refolding of partly unfolded monomeric intermediates of -crystallin. the intermediate with the highest exposure of hydrophobic conformation is particularly prone to aggregate formation. a single polypeptide chain of -crystallin after translation would be assumed to fold into functional tetramers as the proposed refolding pathway for K315A mutant. however, due to the interactions by K315, the tetrameric protein would be assumed to dissemble in an alternative manner to form the diagonal dimers. raw sedimentation data were fitted to the continuous size distribution model using the SEDFIT program [25]. the panels show the raw sedimentation and theoretical fitted data (solid lines), and the fitting residual, respectively."}
