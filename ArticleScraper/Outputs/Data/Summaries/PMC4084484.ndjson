{"summary": "participants in five overlapping cohorts provided blood samples for testing by plaque reduction neutralization tests at 6\u20139 mo intervals. each cohort had separate human subjects protocols that were in compliance with US federal regulations governing the protections of human subjects. we removed individuals from consideration who were born after 1995. this resulted in the removal of 1,465 children from consideration. this resulted in the removal of 1,465 children from consideration. results were left-censored (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A), interval-censored (Fig. 1), and right-censored (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B), corresponding to individuals who had any instance of seroconversion to more than one serotype. this approach means our estimates of FoIs are biased low. f = d F / d t, the likelihood for the three types of censored data are given in SI Appendix, Table S3. we considered each individual\u2019s infection status to be independent of others, which allowed us to take the likelihood of the data as the product of each individual\u2019s likelihood. to estimate pdf f, we used a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. we ran 10 chains, each of length 100,000, and evaluated convergence primarily by monitoring scale reduction factors (SI Appendix, Fig. S13) for our analysis, we combined the last 15,000 steps of each chain and randomly sampled 1,000 steps to remove autocorrelation. to estimate R ( t) for the entire population of Iquitos, we used our FoI estimates to calculate the fraction of the entire population susceptible at any time t. the number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious person at any time t was the effective reproductive number, denoted R ( t ). R 0 was used to calculate the critical vaccination coverage required to eliminate a pathogen. the critical vaccination coverage level, p c, satisfies the following relationship (5): p c 1 1 R 0. [7] Approval of Experiments Involving Human Subjects. analysis includes 12 y (1999\u20132010) of data from five longitudinal dengue cohorts involving Iquitos residents >5 y of age. participants provided blood samples for testing by plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs) at 6\u20139 mo intervals. in some circumstances, studies overlapped in time and space. dilutions of 1:60, 1:80, 1:60, and 1:40 for DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4, respectively (11) provided confidence in our interpretation of serologic results. on this basis, we designed an algorithm to identify infections that minimized the probability of false-positive results by (i) using serotype-specific thresholds. the data were left-censored (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A), interval-censored (Fig. 1), and right-censored (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B), corresponding to individuals who entered the study already seroconverted, and left the study having never seroconverted, respectively. we defined a set of B-splines (33) as basis functions for f. we could not estimate the function f before 1999 because we did not have data before that date. seroconversions that occurred before 1999 were left-censored, allowing estimation of the proportion of the population that was exposed before the beginning of the study. for each day, we selected the middle 90% of the estimates to form our Bayesian credible interval (BCI) at that point. all analyses were done with R (38) and the R package fda (39). we evaluated convergence with the R package CODA (40). we assessed the sensitivity of R 0 to this interval in SI Appendix, section S5. we then used this approximation of the effective reproductive number to calculate an estimate of the basic reproductive number, R 0, on day d by scaling our approximation by the fraction of the entire population that is susceptible. 84.0% of the 11,703 study participants seroconverted to at least one DENV serotype by the time they left the study. for 36.2% of all individuals who seroconverted to DENV-4, it was their fourth infection with a DENV. left-, interval-, or right-censored individuals entered the study. left-censored individuals left the study having never been infected to the specific serotype. no PRNT test was conclusive for certain serotypes. essentially 0 for DENV-3 and DENV-4 (SI Appendix, Fig. S18C) and 0.004% (SI Appendix, Fig. S18D), respectively. the fact that these estimates were not exactly 0 was likely an artifact of the fitting procedure because no individuals were identified with a left- or interval-censored DENV-3 or DENV-4 infection until after the respective introductions. invading serotypes (DENV-3 and DENV-4) decreased at rates similar to those within the sample population. daily estimates ranged from 0 to 0.002 (Fig. 3), with the highest estimates being for DENV-3 and DENV-4. DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-2 were all highly correlated. yearly FoIs for all serotypes were elevated, however, in late 2009/early 2010. the yearly FoIs of DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 were all correlated. the yearly estimates for all four serotypes were high in 2010, each exceeding 0.1. the absence of a cohort study from late 2005 to mid-2006 does not preclude the estimation of yearly estimates of FoI. daily estimates of R 0. for each serotype daily estimates of R 0 as well as the 50% BCI are plotted against time. the absence of a cohort study from late 2005 to mid-2006 is indicated by the gray shaded region. the yearly R 0 estimate of DENV-1 and DENV-2 experienced the largest jumps from one year to the next. highest yearly R 0 estimates were lower than the highest daily estimates for all serotypes. highest yearly R 0 estimates occurred in 2010. a vaccine should be distributed to 79% of the population. the final dataset included 38,416 blood samples that provided serotype-specific infection information for 11,703 individuals. the number of left-censored infections for those serotypes was higher than for DENV-3 and DENV-4. in total, 84.0% of the 11,703 study participants seroconverted to at least one DENV serotype by the time they left the study. for 36.2% of all individuals who seroconverted to DENV-4, it was their fourth infection with a DENV. for each serotype the number of interval-censored infections are plotted against year. for comparison purposes the scale of the y axis is not the same in each panel. fewer deNV-1 and DENV-2 interval-censored infections than deNV-3 and DENV-4 interval-censored infections. the susceptible proportion of the study subpopulation decreased for all serotypes. at the end of the study, s ( t) was reflective of the order of serotype introductions into Iquitos. however, susceptible estimates within Iquitos decreased at rates similar to those within the sample population. the loss of data increased median values and credible intervals of estimates around the gap. the large credible intervals and timing of the estimated peak FoI for 2004 may be an artifact of synchronized timing of blood draws in 2004. every serotype had at least one year with a yearly FoI that exceeded 0.1, corresponding to seroconversion in 10% of the study population that were still susceptible to that serotype in that year. the largest yearly FoI for any serotype was the 2008 estimate for DENV-3. the absence of a cohort study from late 2005 to mid-2006 does not preclude the estimation of yearly FoI estimates for either 2005 or 2006. the absence of a cohort study from late 2005 to mid-2006 is indicated by the gray shaded region. our estimates of DENV-3 ranged from below 1 to 4.72 by 2010. Weekly and monthly estimates of R 0 resulted in similar, slightly lower values. sharp increases in the FoI were preceded by sharp spikes in R 0. the highest yearly R 0 estimate for DENV-1 and DENV-4 occurred in 2010 [DENV-1: 2.62 (50% BCI: 2.56\u20132.68) and DENV-4: 1.43 (50% BCI: 1.39\u20131.47)]. from serotype to serotype, values of R 0 and, in turn, p c varied. our estimates for R 0 varied from 1 to over 5, depending on year and serotype. this is consistent with the notion that DENV-4 is less transmissible than the other three serotypes (42, 43). serotype-specific approach revealed synchronous dynamics among DENV serotypes. deNV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-4 all achieved their local maxima in 2010. novel serotype invasions are rare events, in our case two over 12 y. the synchrony between serotypes indicates there are common drivers. deNV is dependent on a mosquito population to complete its transmission cycle. cross-reacting anti-DENV antibodies can result in false positive PRNT results. we compensated for this by excluding individuals who seemed to seroconvert to multiple serotypes in the same time period. this does not guarantee that we completely controlled for incorrectly serotyping an infection owing to a cross-reaction. an individual has temporary immunity to heterologous DENV infection (57), which may have affected our estimates (44) incorporating death would increase our estimates. longitudinal studies provide valuable detailed information on pathogen transmission, especially when rates of asymptomatic infection are high. the minimal vaccine coverage required to effectively control dengue varies by serotype. the inclusion of accurate, serotype-specific estimates of critical transmission parameters will be crucial for selecting delivery strategies."}
