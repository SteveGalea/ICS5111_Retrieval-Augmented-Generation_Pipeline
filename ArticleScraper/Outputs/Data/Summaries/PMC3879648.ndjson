{"summary": "primary care doctors were randomized to mask wearing and non mask wearing clinical consultations in public primary care clinics in Hong Kong. a significant and negative effect was found in the patients\u2019 perception of doctors\u2019 empathy (CARE score reduction -0.98, p-value = 0.04). a facemask is a loose fitting disposable device covering the wearer\u2019s nose and mouth. it acts as a physical barrier to potential contaminants in the immediate environment. there is little proven benefit in the sole use of facemask to prevent healthcare personnel from contracting infections. studies have demonstrated the impact of doctors\u2019 empathy and patient centred care on patient enablement [22] and health outcomes [6,23] in both chronic and acute conditions [24-27]. a randomized control trial was conducted to explore the effects of facemask wearing among primary care doctors in Hong Kong. hypothesized that patients who consulted mask wearing doctors would report lower scores in doctors\u2019 empathy when compared to non mask wearing doctors. a trained research assistant approached consecutive patients for their willingness to participate in the study and to obtain informed consent. the primary outcome measure was the Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) measure. the CARE measure has been found to be a reliable and valid tool to assess patient-rated empathy of doctors during consultation. to CARE measure scores [30,31] were also included in the questionnaire. included the reason for consultation, self-assessed general health. information on participating doctors was also collected and included doctor\u2019s gender, age and training grade. two of the five clinics agreed to participate in the study. the chosen study period was from august - September 2011. all doctors (n = 40) were invited of whom nine doctors participated. patients rated their overall satisfaction with the doctor-patient interaction on a 7-point likert scale (1 = worst, 7 = excellent); and 2) patient enablement, by using the six-item patient enablement instrument (PEI) rating is on a 3-point scale (same or less/better/much better) and scored as 0, 1, 2. Total PEI score is calculated by the average of the scores of the applicable items multiplied by six. important independent predictors of CARE measure were pre-identified and included in the model. this can adjust for possible cluster effects of patients nested with doctors, as well as potential confounding effects from patients\u2019 demographic variables, such as age and gender. no significant differences between mean scores of patient satisfaction and patient enablement between the two groups. the mean CARE score of the MASK group (33.93) was significantly lower (p = 0.04) than the mean of noMASK group (34.91) (Table 2). mask wearing and knowing the doctor could potentially interact with facemask wearing on CARE measure. CARE scores were reduced by -4.71 CARE score difference. previous known important predictors, general health in the past 12 months. poor general health in the past 12 months was linearly associated with a lower CARE score (-1.51) Knowing the doctor quite well or very well had the highest positive impact (4.36) on CARE score. per minute of self reported consultation time, CARE score also increased by 0.32. CARE score estimate of 42.58 when the patient knows the doctor well is reduced to 36.91 (13.3% drop) when the doctor wore a facemask. the random effect of doctors was assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0.11. no significant association was found between facemask wearing and patient satisfaction. a 5.67 drop in CARE score measure is likely to be clinically significant. the findings may be strengthened by increasing the number of clinics and extending the study into private practice settings. randomisation was executed on a sessional basis. this would reduce any potential variation in doctor\u2019s behaviour. this would be more disruptive to the clinic session. CARE Measure score (model A) and with interaction effect (IE) of mask wearing shows the interactive effects of mask wearing and \u201cknowing the doctor well\u201d. average consultation time is 7.66 minutes, the consultation was for new (acute) illness. mask wearing among patients who did not know his/her doctor well was minor and did not reach significance. however, the positive effect of \u201cknowing the doctor\u201d on CARE score was greatly diminished when the doctor wore a facemask with a reduction in CARE score estimate of 5.67. the random effect of doctors was assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0. The variances are estimated and presented in Table 3. a 5.67 drop in CARE score measure is likely to be clinically significant. a 5 point drop in CARE score in the original study in the uk was able to differentiate between significantly below average doctors and significantly above average doctors [29]. a randomized controlled trial found that the wearing of facemasks by doctors had little effect on patient enablement and satisfaction but had a significant and negative effect on patients\u2019 perceptions of the doctors\u2019 empathy. further studies into the complexities of the doctor patient relationship could yield important tools for an effective therapeutic relationship in optimising a patient\u2019s health outcomes. facemask wearing has become mandatory in some countries and clinical institutions. a review of current policies may be warranted in light of current findings. in some countries where wearing facemasks is uncommon, care must be taken in conveying effective infection risk advice to healthcare professionals and caution in adopting guidelines regarding universal mask use. facemasks offer limited protection in preventing infection [3] and aerosol transmission [35] through mucous membranes. negative impact on patient\u2019s perceived empathy and relational continuity can reduce potential therapeutic effects such as decreased depression, improved immune response, improved quality of life and improved health outcomes. a negative impact on the patient\u2019s perceived empathy and relational continuity can reduce potential therapeutic effects such as decreased depression, improved immune response, improved quality of life and improved health outcomes [36,37]. in some countries and clinical institutions where facemask wearing has become mandatory and universal, review of current policies may be warranted."}
