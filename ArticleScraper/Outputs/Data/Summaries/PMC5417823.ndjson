Lysate supernatants were then bound to Dynabeads linked to anti-FLAG or anti-V5 for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. then washed 3 with INO80 wash buffer (40 mm HEPES-NaOH 7.9, 0.25 m NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) samples were resolved on 4\u201312% NuPage Bis-Tris gels (Life Technologies) TFPT was produced by in vitro transcription and translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S] methionine according to manufacturer's instructions. in vitro translated proteins (10 l) were diluted into 100 l of assay buffer, when appropriate, incubated with SUMO1 or SUMO2 and the SUMO E1 and E2 enzymes. bound proteins were removed by washing, and bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and auto a weak signal, foreground median and background median signal intensity will be similar, and its SI will thus be 1. To normalize the signal, we assumed true hits are relatively rare and almost evenly dispersed in each block. positive hits need to be detected in 2 out of 3 triplicate experiments to be considered positive. positive hits that were detected in negative control chips were also excluded from analysis. chips were washed 3 with assay buffer and 3 with PBS. followed by incubation with DyLight 549-anti-SUMO1 (21C7) or DyLight 649-anti-SUMO2 (8A2) antibody pre-bound to either anti-Flag (F1804, Sigma St. Louis, MO), anti-myc (R95025, Life Technologies), or anti-V5 (R9605, Life Technologies) antibodies for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C and washed 3 times with SUMO IP wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and GST-tagged SUMO1, SUMO2, or SUMO2 trimer were expressed in bacteria. all GST-tagged proteins were purified by affinity chromatography. in vitro translated proteins (10 l) were diluted into 100 l of 1 PBS. TFPT was produced by in vitro transcription and translation in rabbit reticulocute lysate in presence of [35S] methionine according to manufacturer's instructions. radiolabeled protein was then incubated either with or without SUMO1 or SUMO2 and the SUMO E1 and E2 enzymes for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. SUMO binding experiments were conducted with four probes representing the SUMO1, SUMO2 and the SUMO1 and SUMO2 trimers. chips were incubated overnight in blocking buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.3, 100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 0.05% Tween-20, 2% BSA) cells were washed with 1X PBS, then lysed in SUMO IP lysis buffer. cells were then sonicated on ice and centrifuged at 15,000 g for 10 min. lysates were transferred to cold microcentrifuge tubes. lysed in INO80 lysis buffer (40 mm HEPES-NaOH pH 7.9, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol), followed by centrifugation. lysate supernatants were then bound to Dynabeads linked to anti-FLAG or anti-V5 for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C and then washed 3 with INO80 wash buffer (40 mm H serum albumin in assay buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.3, 100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 0.05% Tween-20) translated proteins (10 l) were diluted into 100 l of assay buffer, when appropriate, incubated with SUMO1 or SUMO2 and the SUMO E1 and E2 enzymes. a background correction was applied to the remaining spots, defined as the signal intensity (SI) value of each spot as the odds ratio of the foreground median divided by the background median. if a spot has a weak signal, foreground median and background median signal intensity will be similar, and its SI will thus be 1. positive hits that were detected in negative control chips were also excluded from analysis. SUMO2 monomer or trimer in assay buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH pH 7.3, 100 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 0.05% Tween-20) chips were washed 3 with assay buffer and 3 with PBS, followed by incubation with DyLight 549-anti-SUMO1 (21C7) or DyLight 649-anti-SUMO2 (8A2) cell lysates were incubated with Dynabeads (Life Technologies Carlsbad, CA) pre-bound to either anti-Flag (F1804, Sigma St. Louis, MO), anti-myc (R95025, Life Technologies), or anti-V5 (R9605, Life Technologies) antibodies for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C and washed 3 times with SUMO IP wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm GST-tagged SUMO1, SUMO2 and SUMO1 and SUMO2 trimers were expressed in bacteria and GST-INO80E was expressed in yeast. all GST-tagged proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. TFPT was produced by in vitro transcription and translation in rabbit reticulocute lysate. radiolabeled protein was then incubated either with or without SUMO1 or SUMO2 and the SUMO E1 and E2 enzymes for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C to yield a mixture of SUMOylated and unmodified TFPT. analysis protein microarray data from both SUMO-binding experiments and SUMOylation experiments (18) were integrated with protein-protein interaction data from publicly available databases. if analysis protein microarray data from both SUMO-binding experiments and SUMOylation experiments (18) were identified and analyzed as previously described. SUMO-binding proteins were found by two SUMO2-focused affinity purification and mass spectrometry based screens. the SUMO2 monomer probe bound to the largest number of proteins (306), as well as the largest number of unique proteins (128). gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed several notable properties of these proteins. this analysis revealed significant enrichment for cytoplasmic localization among proteins that were bound by all four probes. er and SUMO2 monomer shared the largest number of molecular function GO terms. enriched GO terms common to proteins that bound all four probes included three terms: \u201cmetabolic process,\u201d \u201cmuscle contraction\u201d and \u201coxidation reduction.\u201d each of these contained at least one predicted canonical SIM. the integration of these three types of data sets resulted in a network of 2503 nodes, connected by 9520 edges. these network motifs can be considered to be the basic building blocks for the network and provide the information underlying the design principle of SUMO-dependent networks. network analysis of SUMO binding and SUMO-conjugated human proteins. the network motif that was the focus of subsequent experiments is boxed in orange. INO80E, TFPT, and SUMO2 form the SUMOmodPPI network motif. INO80E binds to SUMO1 and SUMO2 through a C-terminal SIM domain. we mutated the hydrophobic residues in the hydrophobic core of the SIM to alanines. mtSIM mutant showed a 70% reduction in binding of INO80E to GST-SUMO2. binding to GST-SUMO1 was unchanged. but the truncation mutant showed an 80% reduction in binding to GST-SUMO2. either SUMO1 or SUMO2, we observed a strong band representing a 20-kDa molecular weight shift consistent with a SUMO-modified form of TFPT. however, when we incubated the in vitro translated TFPTK216R with the SUMOylation enzyme cocktails, no such shifted band was observed. PIAS1 and PIAS3 induce modification of TFPT by SUMO2. immunoblotting using an anti-myc antibody to detect SUMOylated TFPT. in the absence of myc-SUMO2, no bands were observed in the anti-myc blot. however, when we cotransfected SUMO2, we saw a strong band representing SUMO2-modified TFPT. this shows that Lys216 is essential for SUMOylation of TFPT in mammalian cells. SUMOylation Enhances Interaction Between TFPT and ION80E INO80E INO80E and TFPT are known subunits of the human INO80 chromatin-remodeling complex. the SUMOmodPPI network motif containing INO80E, TFPT and SUMO2 predicts that SUMOylation may enhance interaction between INO80E and TFPT. INO80E selectively binds to SUMO-conjugated TFPT. INO80E was immunoprecipitated, then immunoblotted with anti-V5 to detect coimmunoprecipitated TFPT. binding reaction using the INO80EC10 mutant lacking the C-terminal SIM. we found a significant reduction in binding of the INO80EC10 mutant to the SUMO2-modified form of TFPT, whereas binding to the SUMO1-modified form of TFPT was not significantly reduced. this suggests that the C-terminal SIM of INO80E is specifically required for interacting with the SUMO2-modified form of TFPT. we cotransfected wildtype and INO80EC10 mutant with TFPT and SUMO2. this was observed for both the wildtype and the INO80EC10 mutant. this was observed for both the wildtype and the INO80EC10 mutant. 457 total SUMO binding proteins identified by our assay. only 13 previously identified SUMO-binding proteins were previously identified. 270 previously known SUMO-binding proteins were previously identified. SUMO1 and SUMO2 monomer probes were based on the proteolytically processed (mature) forms of SUMO1 and SUMO2. the SUMO1 and SUMO2 trimer probes were expressed as trimeric fusion proteins. enriched GO terms common to proteins that bound all four probes shared the largest number of molecular function GO terms. the SUMO1 trimer and SUMO2 monomer binding proteins shared the largest number of GO terms. this combined data set includes 2910 high-confidence SUMOylation substrates, 489 high-confidence SUMO binding proteins, and 6121 reported protein interactions. the integration of these three types of data sets resulted in a network of 2503 nodes, connected by 9520 edges. this enrichment score reflects the difference between the observed occurrence of this network motif in the integrated SUMOylation network and its expected occurrence in a set of random networks. network motif class 10 represents two interacting proteins that are both SUMOylated by SUMO1. in total, we found 4,377 instances of this network motif (n = 4377) this number of occurrences is significantly more than what we would expect from a random network. INO80E binds to SUMO1 and SUMO2 through a C-terminal SIM domain. INO80E mtSIM shows reduced binding to GST-SUMO2, but not GST-SUMO1. in the first mutant, we mutated the hydrophobic residues in the hydrophobic core of the SIM to alanines. in the second mutant, we made a truncation mutant that lacked the ten C-terminal residues. the mtSIM mutant showed a 70% reduction in binding of INO80E to GST-SUMO2 whereas binding to GST-SUMO1 was unchanged. in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]-methionine followed by incubation with or without the SUMOylation enzymes with either SUMO1 or SUMO2. however, when we incubated the in vitro translated TFPTK216R with the SUMOylation enzyme cocktails in the presence of either SUMO1 or SUMO2. o, we tested the ability of TFPT to be SUMOylated in transfected mammalian cells. we cotransfected TFPT with or without myc-tagged SUMO2 into HEK 293T cells. then immunoprecipitated V5-TFPT using an anti-V5 antibody. then immunoblotting using an anti-myc antibody. transfected with TFPT, SUMO2 and PIAS1 constructs, we observed a strong signal corresponding to mono-SUMOylated TFPT with several additional bands representing several higher molecular weight forms of SUMOylated TFPT. however, in cells cotransfected with TFPTK216R, SUMO2 and PIAS1 constructs, the anti-myc immunoblot showed only weak signal corresponding to the highest range of molecular weight the INO80E C-terminal SIM is important for the ability of INO80E to interact with SUMO2 and that TFPT is modified by SUMO2. in order to test this hypothesis, we conducted an in vitro binding assay to measure binding between INO80E and SUMO-modified TFPT. myc-tagged INO80E was immunoprecipitated, then immunoblotted with anti-V5 to detect coimmunoprecipitated TFPT. when we performed a binding reaction using the INO80EC10 mutant lacking the C-terminal SIM, we saw a reduction in binding of the INO80EC10 mutant to the SUMO2-modified form of TFPT. mutant INO80E coimmunoprecipitates both TFPT and TFPTK216R. we cotransfected wildtype and INO80EC10 mutant with TFPT and SUMO2. results suggest that SUMO2 promotes the INO80E-TFPT interaction. human proteome microarrays prepared fluorescently labeled SUMO isoform-specific monoclonal antibodies. we then performed SUMO-binding assays in triplicate for each of the four probes. only 13 previously identified SUMO-binding proteins were previously identified. the surfaces corresponding to the first alpha-helix and second beta-strand for both SUMO1 and SUMO2 are shown in color (nitrogens are shown in red, oxygens in blue and carbons in green) this surface has been reported to be important for interactions with other proteins. a surprising result of this analysis was the finding that of all pairwise combinations of probes tested, proteins that bound the SUMO1 trimer and SUMO2 monomer shared the largest number of molecular function GO terms. sarcospan and alpha-1-syntrophin are members of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC), which plays a role in membrane integrity. a total of 2910 high-confidence SUMOylation substrates, 489 high-confidence SUMO binding proteins, and 6121 reported protein interactions. the integration of these three types of data sets resulted in a network of 2503 nodes, connected by 9520 edges. this enrichment score reflects the difference between the observed occurrence of this network motif in the integrated SUMOylation network and its expected occurrence in a set of random networks (38). network motif class 10 represents two interacting proteins that are both SUMOylated by SUMO1. network motif class 10 represents two interacting proteins that are both SUMOylated by SUMO1. assay revealed that INO80E binds specifically to the SUMO2 monomer and the SUMO2 trimer. the other protein in this triad, TFPT, was previously found to be specifically modified by SUMO2 in the presence of the SUMO E3 ligases PIAS1 and PIAS3. INO80E mtSIM shows reduced binding to GST-SUMO2, but not GST-SUMO1. we mutated the hydrophobic residues in the hydrophobic core of the SIM to alanines. in the second mutant, we made a truncation mutant that lacked the ten C-terminal residues. wildtype TFPT and the K216R mutant were translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]-methionine and incubated either with or without the E1 and E2 SUMOylation enzymes. a strong band representing a 20-kDa molecular weight shift consistent with a SUMO-modified form of TFPT. we immunoprecipitated V5-tagged TFPT and immunoblotted against myc-tagged SUMO2 to detect SUMOylated TFPT. in the absence of myc-tagged SUMO2, no bands were observed in the anti-myc Western blot. this shows that Lys216 is essential for SUMOylation of TFPT in mammalian cells. in cells cotransfected with TFPT, SUMO2 and PIAS1 constructs, we observed a strong signal corresponding to mono-SUMOylated TFPT with several additional bands representing several higher molecular weight forms of SUMOylated TFPT. however, in cells cotransfected with TFPTK216R, SUMO2 and PIAS1 constructs, the anti-myc immunoblot showed only weak signal corresponding to the highest range of mo the SUMOmodPPI network motif containing INO80E, TFPT and SUMO2 predicts that SUMOylation may enhance interaction between INO80E and TFPT. the SUMOmodPPI network motif containing INO80E, TFPT and SUMO2 predicts that SUMOylation may enhance interaction between INO80E and TFPT. SUMO-conjugated TFPT was immunoprecipitated, then immunoblotted with anti-V5. the INO80EC10 mutant did not show any difference in its interaction with unmodified TFPT. this suggests that the C-terminal SIM of INO80E is specifically required for interacting with the SUMO2-modified form of TFPT. wildtype INO80E could coimmunoprecipitate both wildtype TFPT and TFPTK216R (lanes 9 and 10). however, when we cotransfected the mutant with TFPT, we observed a greatly reduced ability of mutant INO80E to coimmunoprecipitate both TFPT and TFPTK216R (lanes 11 and 12). we purified SUMO1 and SUMO2 monomers, as well as SUMO1 and SUMO2 trimers, to be used as polySUMO chain mimics. we then used these protein probes in a novel human proteome microarray-based SUMO-binding assay. only 13 of these 13 previously identified SUMO-binding proteins were previously identified. SUMO1 and SUMO2 protein surfaces generated using macPyMOL. surfaces corresponding to first alpha-helix and second beta-strand for both SUMO1 and SUMO2 are shown in color. moylation We next conducted gene ontology (GO) analysis on the novel SUMO binding proteins. this analysis revealed several notable properties of these proteins. the importance of SUMOylation in the cytoplasm may be underappreciated. function has been unexplored, skeletal muscle actin is SUMOylated and altered cellular localization of SUMO1 has been observed in skeletal muscle in response to physical exercise (36, 37). as with molecular function, the SUMO1 trimer and SUMO2 monomer binding proteins shared the largest number of GO categories compared with any other pairwise probe combination. at least one node represents SUMO and at least one node represents a protein from either the SUMO-binding or SUMOylation data sets. these three proteins are then connected by edges that represent one of three types of protein-protein interaction. one representative example is shown for each class of the tripartite motif. SUMOmodPPI consists of the INO80 chromatin remodeling complex subunits INO80E and TFPT, and SUMO2. the other protein in this triad, TFPT, was previously found to be specifically modified by SUMO2 in the presence of the SUMO E3 ligases PIAS1 and PIAS3. INO80E, the INO80E SIM mutant and the INO80EC10 were generated by in vitro translation in the presence of [35S]-methionine and incubated with glutathione sepharose-bound GST-SUMO1 and GST-SUMO2. in order to test whether this predicted SIM was important for SUMO binding, we made two mutant forms of the protein. TFPT is SUMOylated at Lys216 Next, we turned to the other protein in this network, TFPT. to test whether this lysine residue was important for SUMOylation, we created a lysine-to-arginine TFPT mutant, TFPTK216R. the mutant was translated in vitro with either SUMO1 or SUMO2. HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with TFPT and the K216R mutants. we immunoprecipitated V5-tagged TFPT and immunoblotted against myc-tagged SUMO2. in the absence of myc-SUMO2, no bands were observed in the anti-myc Western blot. TFPT SUMOylation at Lys216 is Enhanced by PIAS1 and PIAS3 In Vivo Our group had shown significant enhancement of TFPT SUMOylation in the presence of the SUMO E3 ligases PIAS1 and PIAS3. in cells cotransfected with TFPT, SUMO2 and PIAS1 constructs, the anti-myc immunoblot showed only weak signal corresponding to the highest range of molecular weight SUMOylation Enhances Interaction Between TFPT and ION80E INO80E and TFPT are known subunits of the human INO80 chromatin-remodeling complex. the SUMOmodPPI network motif containing INO80E, TFPT and SUMO2 predicts that SUMOylation may enhance interaction between INO80E and TFPT. INO80E selectively binds to SUMO-conjugated TFPT. we found a significant reduction in binding of the INO80EC10 mutant to the SUMO2-modified form of TFPT. however, binding to the SUMO1-modified form of TFPT was not significantly reduced. we transfected cells with myc-INO80E and V5-TFPT. then conducted immunoprecipitation using anti-myc, and Western blotting using anti-V5. this showed that wildtype INO80E could coimmunoprecipitate wildtype TFPT and TFPTK216R. a combination of SUMOylation and SUMO-binding mediate the interaction between INO80 complex subunits. this suggests that both SUMO-modified and unmodified forms of TFPT may compete for binding to a single site on INO80E. in mammalian cells, we found that the interaction between INO80E and TFPT may be dependent on the INO80E SIM. INO80E and TFPT may interact with other endogenous SUMO-modified proteins. these proteins have been proposed to serve a regulatory function that is likely specific to metazoans. there are no known orthologs of these subunits in yeast. a recent study found that knockdown of the INO80 ATPase and other INO80 complex subunits INO80E and TFPT resulted in embryonic stem cell differentiation. a YY1 binding site also overlaps with a TFPT DNA sequence motif identified previously (8) in the orthologous region of the human genome. this work extends the list of known SUMO-binding proteins 10-fold. our analysis of randomly chosen purified proteins indicates that these proteins are generally of high quality and high purity. unidentified contaminants, including other interacting proteins, could interact strongly with our SUMO probes."}
