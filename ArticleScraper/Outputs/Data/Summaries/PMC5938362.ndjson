{"summary": "introduction hepatitis C virus (HCV, genus Hepacivirus, family Flaviviridae) is a hepatotropic human pathogen with an estimated worldwide seroprevalence around 2.8%. the seven major HCV genotypes display remarkable antigenic variability and are classified into several recognized subtypes. the origin of HCV as a human pathogen is still an unsolved puzzle. some authors envisaged the possibility that HCV evolved from a horse-to-human transmission event. others suggested that HCV originated in relatively recent times from one or multiple cross-species transmission events from a still to be defined species. most RAVs naturally occur in treatment-naive patients. in some instances RAV prevalence differs among genotypes or subtypes. we also analyzed the most important cell-surface molecules that mediate HCV cell entry. gene trees were generated by maximum-likelihood using phyML with the approximate likelihood-ratio test (aLRT) method. only sites detected by both methods were considered positively selected. the NS5B region we used for dating is non-recombining. the tMRCA of EHV/CHV was estimated on a phylogeny of 18 sequences with complete coding sequence information. GUIDANCE detected no uncertainty in the alignments. the action of saturation and purifying selection can underestimate the tMRCA. aBS-REL estimates branch lengths more reliably than other commonly used models. aBS-REL estimates branch lengths more reliably than other commonly used models. the PL method in r8s employs a smoothing parameter, which represents how much the assumption of a molecular clock has been relaxed. cross-validation was run to determine the best smoothing value for the aBS-REL tree. 500 samples were drawn from aBS-REL analyses to estimate branch length variance. branch-site tests from PAML and BUSTED were applied. p-values from both methods were FDR-corrected to account for multiple tested branches. positively selected sites were then identified through the BEB analysis. dN/dS ratio is rendered infinite for dS values equal to 0. SLAC and FEL were used to estimate evolutionary rate at RAV vs. non-RAV positions. dN-dS statistics were also exploited to provide an overall view of HCV genome evolution. subtype 1b strain (PDB: 1ZH1) and the structure of human OAS1 (PDB: 4IG8) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) two docking methods were applied and their results compared for consistency. the best models from ClusPro and Patchdock were superimposed. the receptor grid was generated around the Sphingomyelin Binding Domain (residues E230 to G263) the docked ligand-receptor poses were analyzed. the 3D structures were rendered using PyMOL (the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.8.4.0 Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC) the cutoff p-value was set to 0.01 in both GARD and RDP4. no method detected recombination in any alignment. gene trees were generated by maximum-likelihood using phyML. the NS5B region we used for dating is non-recombining. it was selected because it is one of the most conserved across HCV genotypes. the tMRCA of EHV/CHV was estimated on a phylogeny of 18 sequences with complete sequence information. the action of saturation and purifying selection can underestimate the tMRCA, and selection-informed models can improve branch length estimation. we thus applied a branch-site test to estimate branch lengths while taking into account the effect of different selective pressures among lineages in the phylogeny. cross-validation was run to determine the best smoothing value for the aBS-REL tree. a latin hypercube sampling scheme (LHC) was used to sample from the aBS-REL parameter distributions so as to estimate the confidence interval. phylogenetic trees were generated by maximum-likelihood. selection acted on the internal branches of HCV phylogenies. the p-values from both methods were FDR-corrected to account for multiple tested branches. positively selected sites were then identified through the BEB analysis. SLAC and FEL were used to estimate evolutionary rate at RAV vs. non-RAV positions. dN-dS statistics were also exploited to provide an overall view of HCV genome evolution. the 1b subtype was used in the original study describing interaction between OAS1 and NS5A (Taguchi et al., 2004) two docking methods were applied and their results compared for consistency. Specifically, we used the patchDock server (Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2005) and imposed that the residue in NS5A is located at the binding interface. the simulations were performed using the OPLS3 force field. the docked ligand-receptor poses were analyzed in terms of Glide Score. the 3D structures were rendered using PyMOL. no evidence of positive selection was detected for CLDN1 and SRB1. selection was not detected at OCLN or CD81 in primates. however, positive selection was not detected for rodents.

Both RAV positions and positively selected sites displayed variable dN-dS values. this is not unexpected for positively selected sites as they were identified using branch-site tests. hosts for hepaciviruses, Chiroptera were analyzed separately from other species in the Laurasiatheria superorder. no evidence of positive selection was detected for CLDN1 and SRB1. selection was not detected at OCLN or CD81 in primates.

CD81 is required for human Plasmodium falciparum and rodent Plasmodium yoelii sporozoite hepatocyte infection. the molecular details of the interaction with this virus are unknown. zoonotic events are commonly associated with bursts of positive selection whereby the pathogen adapts to successfully infect and be transmitted in a new species. a paradigmatic example of this is the distribution of the IFNL3/IFNL4 polymorphism most strongly associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV. the frequency of the protective genotype differs dramatically among populations and this variant explains part of the ethnic variance in the probability to clear HCV infection. the positively selected sites we identified herein represent excellent candidates for future functional studies. the positively selected sites are expected to modulate viral phenotypes. this is in line with the notion that substitutions at RAV positions can reduce viral fitness. author contributions MS conceived the study, with inputs from DF and MC.
