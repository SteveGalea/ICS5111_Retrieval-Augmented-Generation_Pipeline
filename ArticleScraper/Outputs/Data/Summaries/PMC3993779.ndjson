{"summary": "DEN infection in humans causes a wide spectrum of illnesses ranging from mild dengue fever to severe complications such as dengue hemorrhagic fever. DEN infection in humans causes a wide spectrum of illnesses ranging from mild dengue fever to severe complications such as dengue shock syndrome (2, 3). nanoparticles such as AgNP have been found to be highly cytotoxic to many mammalian cells. the adverse effects of using nanoparticles such as AgNP are a concern. applications of nanomaterials as antiviral agents have lagged behind antibacterial studies. the surfactant-modified NSPs such as NSQa, NSQb, and NSQc showed less cytotoxicity and enhanced antimicrobial activities. NSQc, but not the pristine clay, potently blocked the plaque-forming ability of JEV and suppressed infection with DEN-2 and influenza A virus. the complexes of NSP and negatively charged surfactant may be potent and safe antiviral nanomaterials against several pathogenic viruses. NSQa, NSQb, and NSQc were created by use of different surfactants with NSP as described previously (27). the zeta potentials of nanomaterials in water were determined by laser light scattering using a zeta potential and submicrometer particle analyzer (Delsa Nano S; Beckman Coulter) for gel electrophoresis, the nanomaterials were mixed with loading dye (5% glycerol, 0.05% bromophenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol, and 0.05% neutral red) cells were treated with NSQc before virus adsorption for 2 h. cells were washed and incubated for 22 h at 37\u00b0C. culture supernatants were collected for virus titration. cell lysates were harvested for Western blot analysis of viral protein expression. group of 5-week-old mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) inoculated with virus and intracerebrally (i.c.) injected with 30 l of PBS (i.p. plus i.c. route) for the therapeutic mode of testing, groups of 5-week-old C57BL/6 mice were infected with JEV through the i.p. plus i.c. route. at 6 h postinfection, the mice were treated with the SK-N-SH cells (ATCC HTB-11) and human lung carcinoma A549 cells were cultured as described previously (28, 29). the propagation and plaque formation of the JEV RP-9 strain and DEN-2 PL046 and NGC-N strains have been described previously (28, 29). agarose gel was stained with ethidium bromide (EtBr) and photographed under UV light. the gel was stained with ethidium bromide (EtBr) and photographed. cells were washed and incubated for 22 h at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. cells were preincubated with 1 or 10 g/ml of the indicated nanocompounds or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. group of 5-week-old mice were infected with JEV through the i.p. plus i.c. route. at 6 h postinfection, the mice were treated with the indicated NSQc compounds (20 or 80 g/ml) or PBS by i.p. injection. mice were monitored daily for lethality. images of NSP were slightly different from those of NSQa, NSQb, and NSQc. the modified clays showed zeta potentials at steady values of 37 and 44 mV. NSQb, which is NSP modified with nonionic Triton X-100, slightly reduced JEV infection. NSQc, which is NSP modified with anionic SDS, greatly blocked JEV infection. 10 g/ml of NSQc completely eliminated plaque-forming ability of JEV (IC50 = 2.15 g/ml) the undialyzed NSQc contains 42% NSP and 58% SDS. 71% of the SDS was NSP bound and the remaining 29% was free in solution. NSQc(A30) was still able to reduce more than 90% of plaque formation at 10 g/ml. XTT assays showed that at 10 g/ml, all types of NSQ did not affect cell growth. NSQc(A30) had lower cytotoxicity than the parental NSQc. NSQc(A30) had no significant effect on cell growth. NSQc blocks early steps of JEV infection. NSQc relies on electrostatic interaction to inhibit virus binding. NSQc relies on electrostatic interaction to inhibit virus binding. NSQc relies on electrostatic interaction to inhibit virus binding. NSQc and NSQc(A30) reduce JEV binding on the cell surface. preincubation with DMSO (0.2% and 1%) did not abolish the anti-JEV activity of NSQc and NSQc(A30) virus titers (PFU/ml) are means SD (n = 3), and indicated groups were compared using Student's t test. NSQc suppresses infection by DEN-2 and influenza A virus. NSQc(A30) and NSQc(A50) were incubated with DEN-2 (A) or influenza A virus (B) for 1 h (MOI of 5), then incubated with DEN-2 (C) or influenza A virus (D) for 1 h. after virus adsorption, cells were washed and further incubated at 37\u00b0C for 22 h. mice infected with a virulent RP-9 strain can show signs of ruffled fur, hunchback, limb weakness, and paralysis. a DEN model in Stat1/ mice showed paralysis, hemorrhage, vascular leakage, and death after being challenged with a mouse-adapted DEN strain (39). NSQc treatment can impede the in vivo viral infectivity. the levels of viral replication in the brains of mice treated with 80 g/ml NSQc or NSQc(A30) postchallenge were lower than those in mice treated with PBS or NSQc(A50) postchallenge (with a 6-h delay) however, further delay of the treatment to 1 day after JEV challenge did not confer a protective effect. NSQc targets an early step of the viral life cycle and should be given early after infection C57BL/6 mice were challenged with JEV (RP-9; 2 105 PFU/mouse) survival of mice was observed daily. the numbers of mice in each group and the survival rates are shown in parentheses. MMT and NSP demonstrated zeta potentials at steady values of 37 and 44 mV. modifications with AgNP, nonionic surfactant, and anionic surfactant resulted in only slight changes of the zeta potential for AgNP/NSP, NSQb, and NSQc. cells seeded in 6-well plates were adsorbed with JEV (200 PFU) mixed with solvent (PBS) or 10 g/ml MMT, NSP, or AgNP/NSP (A) or with the indicated NSQ compounds. NSQc(A30) contained 30% NSP and 70% surfactant. NSQc(A30) had a potent anti-JEV activity (IC50 of 1.81 g/ml) NSQc(A30) was still able to reduce more than 90% of plaque formation at 10 g/ml. NSQc(A30) has a ratio of 30% NSP to 70% surfactant. NSQc and NSQc(A30) have the best therapeutic indices of 22.14 and >17.89. among the 6 clay-derived nanomaterials tested, NSQc was a safe and potent anti-JEV agent. NSQc blocks early steps of JEV infection. dsorption for 2 h (during), after virus adsorption for 22 h (post) or during all of these times for 26 h (all) Western blot analysis was performed for protein levels of JEV NS3 and actin as a loading control in cell lysates. NSQc relies on electrostatic interaction to inhibit virus binding. NSQc and NSQc(A30) reduce JEV binding on the cell surface through electrostatic interaction. NSQc was incubated with the indicated NSQc (1 and 10 g/ml) at room temperature for 1 h was adsorbed onto BHK-21 cells at 4\u00b0C for 2 h. NSQc suppresses infection by DEN-2 and influenza A virus. antiviral activity against DEN-2 and influenza virus was lower with NSQc(A50) than with NSQc(A30) and NSQc(A30) greatly abolished its anti-DEN-2 and anti-influenza virus activities. the indicated NSQc compounds (0, 1, and 10 g/ml) were incubated with DEN-2 (A) or influenza A virus (B) for 1 h (MOI of 5), then incubated with DEN-2 (C) or influenza A virus (D) for 1 h. NSQc alleviates the mortality of mice infected with DEN-2. DEN model in mice showed paralysis, hemorrhage, vascular leakage, and death after being challenged with a mouse-adapted DEN strain. we used the established murine models of JEV (28, 37) and DEN-2 (39) to assess whether NSQc treatment can impede the in vivo viral infectivity. NSQc(A30) postchallenge (with a 6-h delay) were lower than those in mice treated with PBS or NSQc(A50) however, further delay of the treatment to 1 day after JEV challenge did not confer a protective effect. NSQc targets an early step of the viral life cycle and should be given early after infection. mice that received treatment with the indicated NSQc after a 6-h delay were sacrificed at day 5. relative JEV RNA levels in the brain tissues were quantified by RT-qPCR and normalized to that of actin. in NSQc significantly reduced the cytotoxicity and allowed for exploration of the in vitro and in vivo antiviral potentials. the combination of NSP and SDS, or perhaps other anionic surfactants, may pave a new way to develop novel antiviral nanomaterials. we demonstrated the antiviral activities of NSQc against 3 different viruses, all of which are enveloped viruses. negatively charged heparin interferes with viral attachment and blocks infection. NSQc may trap virus by electrostatic interaction, prevent interaction of virus and host cell, and then block viral binding/entry into host cell. negatively charged NSQc is able to adsorb with virus particles and then results in blocking of viral binding onto the host cell. despite the availability of JE vaccines, there is no DEN vaccine or specific medication for treating DEN infection. despite the availability of JE vaccines, JEV is still the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia."}
