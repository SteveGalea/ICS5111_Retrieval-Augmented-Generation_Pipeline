{"summary": "HCV is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. it is flanked by untranslated regions (UTRs) at its 5 and 3 ends. it is mediated by several entry cofactors located on the cell surface. viral RNA encodes a single polypeptide of about 3,000 amino acids (a.a.) the envelope glycoproteins of viral particles then fuse with the endosomal membrane to release viral genome into the cytoplasm. the nascent translated polypeptide is subsequently processed by a combination of cellular and viral proteases to mature into structural proteins. p7 and nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) are involved in the assembly of viral particles. NS3 and NS4A have its dual role in both viral replication and assembly. is, liver fibrosis, liver cirrhosis and ultimately to hepatocellular carcinoma. current standard of treatment comprises pegylated interferon- and ribavirin. but the severe side effects and different efficacy restrict the success rate of this combined therapy. hepatocytes in liver develop into liver steatosis, liver cirrhosis, and liver cirrhosis. the chronic infection leads to hepatocellular carcinoma formation in nearly 3-5% of viral-infected patients. activated IRE1 signaling triggers endonucleolytic cleavage of X-box protein-1 (XBP-1s) mRNA. XBP-1s protein encoded by XBP-1s mRNA is more stable and functions as a potent transcriptional activator of UPR genes that contain the unfolded protein responsive elements (UPREs) the UPR improves the efficiency of protein folding, removes misfolded proteins through the ERAD system, or triggers cell death [21,40]. the UPR improves the efficiency of protein folding, reduces protein translation and translocation. nic fibroblast (MEF) Activations of the CHOP and Grp78 mRNA levels by HCV E1 and E2 Induction of CHOP and Grp78 protein level by HCV E1 and E2 Enhancement of alternative splicing of XBP1 mRNA by HCV E1 and E2 Activation of UPR and ERAD by HCV Chan and Egan. NS2 Upregulation of CHOP and Grp78 mRNA levels by HCV NS2 Induction of ATF6, Grp78, and CHOP by transfection of HCV full-length and subgenomic replicons Modulation of IRES-mediated translation Von derm Bussche et al. inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6) and protein kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) are indicated. spliced XBP-1 (XBP-1s) transactivates gene expressions of chaperones, lipogenic genes, and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) mic replicon contains only the genome fragment of NS3 to NS5B in human hepatoma Huh7 cells leads to the cleavage of ATF6 and transcriptional activation of UPR chaperon protein, 78-kDa glucose regulated protein (GRP78) further studies demonstrated that HCV NS4B can induce ATF6 and IRE1-XBP1 splicing, two signal transduction modules of UPR. sir et al. first showed that transfection of JFH1 RNA into Huh7 cells can simultaneously activate the three modules of UPR signaling. knockdown of genes involved in each arm of UPR strikingly inhibited the viral RNA level [50]. results suggest the overt activation of UPR in cells expressing the full-length viral genome is indispensable for HCV RNA replication. ER stress-UPR signaling has been shown to be induced in the liver biopsy of patients with chronic HCV infection. autophagy is an intracellular \u201cself-eating\u201d process that targets the cytoplasmic components via the double membrane vacuoles to lysosome for degradation. autophagy exerts a broad range of impacts on cellular pathways to counteract stresses, e.g., nutrient starvation. autophagy pathway involves a series of vacuole regeneration processes. at least four complexes of ATG proteins have been identified to regulate the autophagic process. at the stage of nucleation of IM/phagophore, inhibition of the mTOR by nutrient starvation results in translocation of ULK 1/2 complex from cytoplasm to a unique ER membrane-associated compartment. LK1/2 complex onto ER-derived membrane leads to recruitment of PI3K complex. the newly-generated PtdIns(3)P recruits downstream effectors such as the double-FYVE-containing protein 1 (DFCP1) and WD-repeat domain PtdIns(3)P-interacting (WIPI) family proteins. this process requires ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L and ATG4-ATG3-LC3II two UBL complexes autophagy fuses with vacuoles derived from endocytosis and lysosome to form autolysosome. sequestered materials are degraded and recycled for further use by cells. poliovirus, rhinovirus, and mouse hepatitis have been shown to induce autophagy. rapamycin (mTOR) complex dissociates from the unc-51 like-kinase 1 or 2 (ULK1 or ULK2) complex, leading to dephosphorylation, activation, and translocation of ULK1/2 complex to ER. the class III phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (class III-PI3K) complex activates the class III phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kina LC3 is processed by the cysteine protease ATG4, resulting in the exposure of the exposed glycine of LC3. the exposed glycine of LC3 is activated by ATG7 (E1-like enzyme), transferred to ATG3 (E2-like enzyme), and then covalently linked to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to form the lipidated form of LC3, i.e., LC3-II. the lack of enhanced autophagic degradation of a long-lived protein p62 and inefficient maturation of autophagic vacuoles in cells expression HCV JFH1 viral RNA. the authors demonstrated that suppression of ATG7 or LC3 dramatically inhibited the replication of HCV viral RNA [50]. knockdown of Beclin or ATG7 inhibits HCV-PAMP-mediated innate immune response. knockdown of beclin or ATG7 also potentiates activation of expressions of IFN and ISGs in the HCV-infected human immortalized hepatocytes. HCV-JFH1 (2a) infection/ Huh7.5-1 Formation of GFP-LC3 punctate structure No colocalization of autophagic vacuoles with viral proteins Viral particle assembly Tanida et al. [82] HCV-JFH1 (2a) infection/ Huh7 Transient association of ATG5 with NS5B and NS4B Colocalization of ATG5 with membranous web Organization of replication site Guevin et al HCV-JFH1 (2a) full-length and subgenomic HCV replicon RNA transfection/ Huh7 Induction of autophagy in HCV replicon cells Impaired autophagic flux in Con1 replicon cells but not in JFH1 replicon cells Requirement of autophagy for cell survival. replication of HCV-Con1 (1b) and JFH1 (2a) replicon RNA transfection / Huh7 and Huh7.5-1 An inverse correlation between microvesicular steatosis and the level of autophagy Colocalization of autophagic vacuoles with LDs Impaired autophagy causing cholesterol accumulation Metabolism of LDs. silencing of ATG7 and Beclin moderately decreased the level of extracellular infectious HCV particle. but they did not affect intracellular amounts of viral RNA and proteins. on the other hand, Taguwa et al. demonstrated that interference with the HCV Con1 (genotype 1b)-induced autophagy by ectopic expression of a protease-inactive mutant ATG4BC47A leads to severe cytoplasmic vacuolation and cell death [ IRGM may target autophagy-associated proteins via the immunity-associated GTPase family M protein (IRGM). IRGM may play a central role in the regulation of HCV-triggered autophagy. additional studies will be necessary to determine how HCV RNA or proteins exploit the cellular signaling pathway to activate autophagy. family can induce apoptosis by binding to the so-called death receptors. binding specificities of ligands to these receptors are determined by the typical amino-terminal cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) the binding specificities of ligands to these receptors are determined by the typical amino-terminal cysteine-rich domains. apoptosis is associated with activation of caspase 3 and the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) two studies showed that HCV infection can induce the TNF-mediated cell apoptosis through upregulation of TRAIL and its receptors, DR4 and DR5. overexpression of HCV NS5A/ Monkey kidney cell line COS7 and Hep3B Binding of HCV NS5A to p53 Suppression of p21/waf1 expression by HCV NS5A Inhibition of p53 -mediated transcriptional transactivation and apoptosis Inhibition of p53 downstream apoptotic signaling Lan et al. mediated apoptosis Prikhod'ko et al. [109] Baculovirus-mediated expression of HCV E1/ Insect Sf9 cell Induction of DNA fragmentation by HCV E1 Induction of cytotoxicity by HCV E1 Induction of cytotoxicity by HCV E1 Activation of apoptosis. NS3 Inhibition of apoptosis by HCV NS3 required serine protease activity Tanaka et al. [113] HCV- chimeric J6/JFH1 (2a) infection/ Huh7.5-1 Activation and nuclear translocation activated caspase 3 by HCV infection Accumulation of BAX on mitochondria by HCV infection. virus infection often leads to cell cycle arrest through altering cell cycle regulators. the viral infectivity factor (Vif) encoded by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been shown to induce G2 arrest via its interaction with p53/murine double minute 2 (MDM2) axis to promote HIV replication. a decrease in cell proliferation of the HCV-infected cells is associated with the reduction in cell population of G1/S phase and accumulation of G2/M phase cells. these results conclude that HCV infection can differentially induce the arresting effect at different stages of cell cycle.

NIH3T3 Interaction of NS5A with Grb2 Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by NS5A Interference with ERK signaling. Huh7 Inhibition of MAPK-activated transcriptional factor AP1 by NS5A Interference with ERK signaling by NS5A Interruption ERK pathway. the HCV NS3/4A has been shown to interact with ataxia-telangiectsia mutated (ATM), a sensor protein essential for cellular response to DNA damage. overexpression of HCV NS3/4A causes cytoplasmic retention. mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) constitute mitogenic signaling pathway that regulates cell growth in response to extracellular stimuli. three arms of mitogenic signaling including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38MAPK pathways have been identified. the stable complex consisting of HCV NS5A and p85 was also demonstrated in the cells harboring a subgenomic HCV replicon. these studies collectively indicate that HCV modulates MAPK and PI3K pathways to control cell growth signaling of the infected cells. the ER is a cellular organelle for folding and modification of membrane-bound and secreted proteins. activated IRE1 signaling triggers endonucleolytic cleavage of X-box protein-1 (XBP-1s) mRNA. XBP-1s protein encoded by XBP-1s mRNA is more stable and functions as a potent transcriptional activator of UPR genes that contain the unfolded protein responsive elements (UPREs) Activation of these three modules of UPR signaling leads to a coordinative response which reduces the unfolded proteins that enter into ER. the UPR improves the efficiency of protein folding, removes misfolded proteins through the ERAD system, or triggers cell death [21,40] p78, and caspase 12 Benefit to viral RNA replication Zheng et al. [44] Overexpression of HCV E1 and E2/ HeLa and Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) Activations of the CHOP and Grp78 mRNA levels by HCV E1 and E2 Induction of CHOP and Grp78 protein level by HCV E1 and E2 Enhancement of alternative splicing of XBP1 mRNA by HCV E1 and HCV-JFH1 (2a) infection/Huh7 and Huh7.5 Induction of eIF2 phosphorylation by HCV NS2 Upregulation of CHOP and Grp78 mRNA levels by HCV NS2 Induction of eIF2 phosphorylation by HCV NS2 Modulation of IRES-mediated translation Von derm Bussche et al. three major signaling transducers of UPR include inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6), and protein kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) are indicated. PERK transduces the signaling to activate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) via phosphorylation. replication of NS3 to NS5B in human hepatoma Huh7 cells leads to cleavage of ATF6 and transcriptional activation of UPR chaperon protein, 78-kDa glucose regulated protein (GRP78). further studies demonstrated that HCV NS4B can induce ATF6 and IRE1-XBP1 splicing, two signal transduction modules of UPR. sir et al. first showed that transfection of JFH1 RNA into Huh7 cells can simultaneously activate the three modules of UPR signaling. knockdown of genes involved in each arm of UPR strikingly inhibited the viral RNA level. results suggest that the overt activation of UPR in cells expressing the full-length viral genome is indispensable for RNA replication. transgenic mice with the HCV genotype 1a patient\u2019s serum, the ER chaperon GRP78 and an apoptotic protein, Bcl-2-associated protein X (BAX) were upregulated. expressions of NF-B and B-cell lymphoma-extra large protein (BCL-xL), two anti-apoptotic molecules, were decreased, indicating that HCV-induced ER stress sensitizes the infected cells to apop autophagosome then fuses with endosome and lysosome, forming the autolysosome where the engulfed material is degraded by lysosomal proteases. induction and completion of autophagic process rely on stringent regulation of signal transduction pathways. at least four complexes of ATG proteins have been identified to regulate the autophagic process. the translocation of ULK1/2 complex onto ER-derived membrane leads to recruitment of PI3K complex. the newly-generated PtdIns(3)P recruits downstream effectors such as the double-FYVE-containing protein 1 (DFCP1) and WD-repeat domain PtdIns(3)P-interacting (WIPI) family proteins. this process requires ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L and ATG4-ATG3-LC3II two U autophagy fuses with vacuoles derived from endocytosis and lysosome to form autolysosome. the sequestered materials are degraded and recycled for further use by cells. poliovirus, rhinovirus, and mouse hepatitis virus have been shown to induce autophagy. rapamycin (mTOR) complex dissociates from unc-51 like-kinase 1 or 2 (ULK1 or ULK2) complex. the ER-localized ULK1/2 complex activates the class III phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (class III-PI3K) complex, leading to dephosphorylation, activation, and translocation of ULK1/2 complex to ER. LC3 is processed by the cysteine protease ATG4, resulting in exposure of the C-terminal glycine of LC3. the exposed glycine of LC3 is activated by ATG7 (E1-like enzyme), transferred to ATG3 (E2-like enzyme), and then covalently linked to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). emerging lines of evidence have indicated that autophagy is activated by HCV [50,51, sir et al. proposed that HCV-induced autophagic response undergoes incomplete process which is hampered at the maturation stage of autolysosome [50] the authors demonstrated that suppression of ATG7 or LC3 dramatically inhibited the replication of HCV viral RNA [79]. reciprocally, activated autophagic response by chemical inducers dramatically inhibited the HCV-PAMP-mediated innate immune response. knockdown of Beclin or ATG7 inhibits HCV growth but also potentiates the activation of expressions of IFN and ISGs in the HCV-infected human immortalized hepatocytes. lipidation of LC3B-II Formation of GFP-LC3 punctate structure Requirement of autophagy for initial replication of HCV, but not for the maintenance of existing replicating genome No colocalization of autophagic vacuoles with viral proteins Translation of viral RNA Dreux et al. NS4B/Huh7.5 Induction of autophagy by HCV; NS4B Mapping of HCV amino acids 1-190 for autophagic activation Requirement of Rab5 and PI3K for autophagic activation Organization of viral replication site Su et al. autophagy activation is independent of Bcl2-Beclin dissociation. autophagy activation is not through inhibition of mTOR activity Viral RNA replication Shrivastava et al. several papers have reported additional roles of autophagy in the assembly of HCV infectious virus and surveillance of the HCV-infected host cells. they showed that silencing of ATG7 and Beclin moderately decreased the level of extracellular infectious HCV particle, but did not affect the intracellular amounts of viral RNA and proteins. RNA viruses, including HCV, may target autophagy-associated proteins via the immunity-associated GTPase family M protein (IRGM). Knockdown of IRGM strikingly impaired the HCV-induced autophagic response. IRGM may play a central role in the regulation of HCV-triggered autophagy. TNF family proteins are potent inducers of signaling that triggers activation of NF-B-mediated cell survival signaling. some of the members of TNF superfamily can induce apoptosis by binding to the so-called death receptors, e.g., TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), Fas/CD95, TNF receptor apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor 1 (TRAILR1/DR4), or TRR nomura-Takigawa and colleagues first showed that replication of HCV replicon RNA triggered apoptotic cell death through NS4A-mediated mitochondrial damage. further study by Deng et al. showed that infection of the HCV J6/JFH1 strain into Huh7.5-1 cells induces apoptosis which is associated with activation of caspase 3 and the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polyme overexpression of NS5A/ Monkey kidney cell line COS7 and Hep3B Binding of HCV NS5A to p53 Suppression of p21/waf1 expression by HCV NS5A Inhibition of p53 -mediated transcriptional transactivation and apoptosis Inhibition of p53 downstream apoptotic signaling. caspase 8 Sensitization of cells to Fas-induced apoptosis by HCV NS3 Promotion of caspase 8-mediated apoptosis Prikhod'ko et al. [109] Baculovirus-mediated expression of HCV E1/ Insect Sf9 cell Induction of DNA fragmentation by HCV E1 Induction of cytotoxicity by HCV E1 Activation of apoptosis Chiou et al NS3 mutations at position 106 from leu to ala (L106A) Interference with anti-apoptotic activity by L106A mutation on NS3 Inhibition of apoptosis by HCV NS3 required serine protease activity Tanaka et al. [113] HCV- chimeric J6/JFH1 (2a) infection/ Huh7.5-1 Activation and nuclear translocation activated caspase 3 by HCV infection Ac viral infectivity factor (Vif) encoded by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been shown to induce G2 arrest via its interaction with p53/murine double minute 2 (MDM2) axis to promote HIV replication. HCV core-induced phosphorylation of RB enhances the DNA binding ability of E2F transcriptional factor 1 (E2F-1) and activates the gene expression of S phase kinase-interacting protein 2. a decrease in cell proliferation of the HCV-infected cells is associated with the reduction in cell population of G1/S phase and accumulation of G2/M phase cells. the results conclude that HCV infection can differentially induce the arresting effect at different stages of cell cycle. an et al. [122] Transfection of HCV viral replicon RNA / Huh7 Inhibition of RB expression by HCV replication Interference with RB expression by HCV NS5B Stimulation of cell proliferation and S phase entry by HCV NS5B. chromosomal aberrations and chromosomal breaks by HCV infection Binding of HCV core to NBS1 Inhibition of the Mre11/NBS1/Rad50 complex formation by HCV core Inhibiting DNA repair process. chromosomal instability Machida et al. NIH3T3 Interaction of NS5A with Grb2 Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by NS5A Interference with ERK signaling. overexpression of HCV NS5A/ HeLa; Transfection of subgenomic HCV replicon. overexpression of HCV NS5A causes cytoplasmic retention and dephosphorylation of ATM, leading to a defect in DNA repair and sensitization of Huh7 cells to ionization. despite the role of modulating cell cycle progression, HCV was shown to be involved in DNA damage response. mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) constitute the mitogenic signaling pathway that regulates cell growth in response to extracellular stimuli. three arms of mitogenic signaling including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38MAPK pathways have been identified. HCV NS5A protein was shown to interact with the p85 subunit of PI3K complex to activate the PI3K downstream AKT and BAD signaling molecules. the stable complex was also demonstrated in the cells harboring a subgenomic HCV replicon. this indicates that replication of HCV viral genome may regulate kinase activity and signaling of PI3K. apolipoprotein-B (ApoB) degradation promotes insulin resistance through JNK-mediated inhibition of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). increased expression of a UPR chaperone, Grp78, positively correlates to pathological grade in liver cancer. overexpression of XBP-1s also shown to promote neoplastic transformation. autophagy Activation of autophagy by HCV has been demonstrated by several research groups. despite its functional role in viral growth, HCV-activated autophagic response has been suggested to regulate antiviral immune response, modulate apoptotic cell death signaling, promote host cell survival, and counteract virus-induced lipid accumulation. autophagy is considered a process that suppresses malignant transformation. inhibition of tumor suppressor genes, such as phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and p53, can lead to decrease in autophagy [158,159] apoptosis HCV has been reported to activate apoptotic cell death via death receptor-triggered extrinsic pathway or mitochondria-mediated intrinsic mechanism. in the cells harboring the replication of HCV viral RNA or complete life cycle of infectious HCV, certain viral proteins have been shown to inhibit apoptosis. apoptosis has its potential role in the pathogenesis of chronic liver disease by inducing liver inflammation, liver injury, and liver fibrosis. apoptosis has its potential role in the pathogenesis of chronic liver disease by inducing liver inflammation, liver injury, and liver fibrosis. HCV NS5B protein decreases the RB abundance and enhances E2F transactivation of S-phase genes, thus promoting cell proliferation. RB exerts its critical function as a tumor suppressor in tightly regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. uncontrolled apoptosis and oncogene activation have been implicated in the development of HCC, suggesting that HCV-altered cellular signaling pathways could be involved in the pathogenesis of HCV-related liver diseases. a small animal model capable of supporting complete HCV life cycle is critically necessary for dissecting how a change in cell cycle progression and DNA damage response affects pathogenesis of HCV-associated diseases. PERK enhances sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-SREBP cleavage activating protein (SCAP)-mediated lipid synthesis in ER via attenuating the synthesis of Insig-1 protein. PERK-mediated shut down of protein translation along with ERAD impairs lipid secretion through promoting apolipoprotein-B (ApoB) degradation. in vitro experimental models overexpressing viral protein and cell culture model capable of supporting HCV replication cycle. in future, dissection of relationship of virus-induced ER stress and UPR signaling with hepatosteatosis, liver injury, chronic inflammation, and tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma is urgently needed. autophagy Activation of autophagy by HCV has been demonstrated by several research groups [50,51,73,74]. y leads to an elevation of cholesterol level in HCV-infected cells. this implies that autophagy exerts its role to counteract the virus-triggered lipid accumulation. despite its catabolic role in lipid metabolic cycle, autophagy also plays an important role in tumorigenesis. autophagy is also induced by chemo in anti-cancer treatment. interference with autophagy can synergistically enhance the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs to kill cancer cells. it is possible that HCV-activated autophagic response may contribute to the tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. ic pathway or mitochondria-mediated intrinsic mechanism have been shown to inhibit apoptosis in cells harboring the replication of HCV viral RNA or complete life cycle of infectious HCV. apoptosis has its potential role in the pathogenesis of chronic liver disease by inducing liver inflammation, liver injury, and liver fibrosis. cell cycle arrest and DNA damage, mitogenic signaling, and PI3K pathway HCV was shown to alter cell cycle progression by multiple mechanisms. HCV core protein decreases RB abundance and enhances E2F transactivation of S-phase genes, thus promoting cell proliferation. deregulation of MAPK signaling by HCV may perturb the control of host cell growth in response to extracellular stimuli. however, uncontrolled apoptosis and oncogene activation have been implicated in the development of HCC. further investigation into how HCV infection causes cancer will be further needed. supporting evidence from infected patients and in vivo small animal model are desperately needed to understand the bona fide physiological and clinical relevance of cellular response in the development of HCV-derived liver diseases."}
