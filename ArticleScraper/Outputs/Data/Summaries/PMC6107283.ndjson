{"summary": "coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus of human Enterovirus. in adults, only few cases of CVB3-induced hepatic necrosis have been reported [2, 3], whereas in neonates, CVB3-induced hepatitis is more frequent [4]. we investigated spatio-temporal conditions of IFN- induction and IFNAR signaling during CVB3 infection. we found that hepatocytes, and not myeloid cells, were the main IFN- producers that also had to be IFNAR triggered. in vivo imaging, we found moderate amounts of IFN-I in spleen and maximum levels in cervical lymph nodes (cLN) 3 to 4 dpi. in the liver, peak levels of IFN-I and IFN-III were detected 3 and 2 dpi, respectively. lysates of secondary lymphoid organs contained only minimal IFN-III levels. mice were sacrificed at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 7 dpi (n = 3\u20139). hepatocytes, but not myeloid cells, are major IFN- producers upon CVB3 infection. lethally irradiated C57BL/6 recipient mice were reconstituted with bone marrow. abundant BLI signals were observed in the liver that were similar to those detected in IFN-wt/-luc>IFN-wt/-luc control mice. so, upon CVB3 infection IFN- expression within the liver was contributed primarily by non-hematopoietic cells. IFN-wt/-luc recipients reconstituted with IFN-wt/-luc BM were used as controls. eight weeks after transplant, mice were infected i.p. with 2 104 PFU CVB3 and imaged at 0, 2, or 4 dpi. IFN-III-responsive Mx2 promoter [14] were evaluated upon CVB3 infection. constitutive expression of the reporter was observed in non-infected mice in the liver. kinetics of the reporter induction was similar to that detected in IFN- reporter mice. pancreatic acinar cells showed MX1 expression in infected Mx1-IFNAR-/-IFNLR-/- mice. acinar cells responded to IFN-I, but not to IFN-III. liver and pancreas of CVB3 infected as well as uninfected Mx1-WT, Mx1-IFNAR-/-, Mx1-IFNAR-/- and Mx1-IFNAR in bile duct epithelial cells and pancreatic duct epithelial cells concomitant IFNAR and IFNLR signaling mediates Mx induction in hepatocytes. in vivo imaging was performed at the indicated dpi (n = 3; one representative mouse is shown). 1, Mx1-IFNAR-/-, Mx1-IFNLR-/-, and Mx1-IFNAR-/-IFNLR-/- mice were infected as in (C) and monitored for survival. IFNAR signaling in hepatocytes prevents CVB3-induced hepatitis and virus dissemination. -IFNARfl/fl mice showed moderately increased ALT levels. hepatitis correlated with impaired IFNAR signaling of hepatocytes. all mice of different genotypes analyzed showed a similar extent of pancreatitis. l/fl mice were compared with C57BL/6 mice by one-Way ANOVA test. Graphs depict virus titers in liver, pancreas, spleen, heart, salivary gland (SG) and brain. IFNAR-/- mice developed focal liver cell necrosis 2 dpi (Fig 5A, line 1) and widespread and severe coagulative hepatic necrosis at 3 dpi (Fig 5A, line 2). necrosis in CVB3-infected IFNAR-/- and Alb-Cre+/-IFNARfl/fl mice was not accompanied by infiltration of immune cells. CVB3-infected liver tissue correlated with severity of liver injury. bile duct epithelial cells did not show any abnormalities in light microscopy. all CVB3-infected genotypes displayed infection of pancreatic acinar cells. pancreatic islet and duct epithelial cells were not affected. qPCR analysis of primary human hepatocytes 24 hr after CVB3 infection showed upregulation of Ifn- and Isg15 mRNA expression. however, the expression of Isg15 was upregulated, indicating autocrine IFNAR triggering of the hepatocytes. in vitro cultured primary hepatocytes from C57BL/6 mice were CVB3 infected at MOI 0.01, 0.1, or 1 and after 24 hr incubation supernatants and cells were harvested. bars depict mean + SEM. induction of the 5 most abundantly upregulated ISGs is shown as [fold change] relative to uninfected controls. we inhibited the IFN-I and/or the IFN-III axis during CVB3 infection of primary human hepatocytes. infected human hepatocytes showed abundant Mx induction at 12, 24, and 48 hpi. B18R treatment reduced this induction, while IFNLR had only a minor effect. RNAseq was performed on total RNA samples of two donors 24 hpi. infected reporter mice were perfused with PBS, organs were dissected. luciferase expression was analyzed ex vivo in organ homogenates. lysates of secondary lymphoid organs contained only minimal IFN-III levels. luciferase activity was analyzed at the indicated time points by in vivo imaging. results pooled from three independent experiments (n = 3\u20136) values are mean SD. in vivo imaging of such mice revealed moderate bioluminescence imaging (BLI) signals in the abdomen 2 dpi and in the cervical region 4 dpi. in such mice abundant BLI signals were observed in the liver that were similar to those detected in IFN-wt/-luc mice. IFN-wt/-luc recipients were reconstituted with 1 x 107 BM cells from C57BL/6 (B6>-luc, red) or IFN-wt/-luc mice were used as controls. eight weeks after transplant, mice were infected with 2 104 PFU CVB3. Upon CVB3 infection IFNAR, but not IFNLR, signaling mediates Mx gene induction in hepatocytes. kinetics of the reporter induction in the upper abdominal region was similar to that in IFN- reporter mice. X1 expression in hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells in infected Mx1-IFNAR-/- mice was similar to that in infected Mx1 mice. both hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells responded to IFN-I. pancreatic acinar cells showed MX1 expression in both Mx1-IFNLR-/- and Mx1-IFNAR-/- mice IFNAR-/- and Mx1-IFNAR-/-IFNLR-/- mice were infected with 2 104 PFU CVB3 and sacrificed 2 dpi. histological analysis of the liver of infected Mx1-IFNLR-/- mice did not reveal inflammation and necrosis. histochemical analysis of MX1 expression within sections of liver (line 1) and pancreas (line 2). MX1 positive nuclei of hepatocytes (line 1) or acinar cells (line 2). Bars = 10 m. Representative sections of one mouse out of four are shown. NARfl/fl mice with a hepatocyte-specific IFNAR-deletion were CVB3-infected. in infected Alb-Cre+/-IFNARfl/fl and IFNAR-/- mice dramatically enhanced ALT levels were found. in infected WT controls and LysM-Cre+/-IFNARfl/fl mice showed moderately increased ALT levels. values are mean SEM (n = 3\u201313) for Alb-Cre+/-IFNARfl/fl mice. Graphs depict virus titers in liver, pancreas, spleen, heart, salivary gland (SG) and brain. no signs of liver damage were detected in CVB3-infected C57BL/6 mice. liver sections from infected LysM-Cre+/-IFNARfl/fl mice did not show pathological changes. necrosis in CVB3-infected mice was not accompanied by infiltration of immune cells. biliary duct epithelial cells did not show any abnormalities in light microscopy and were not infected. bile duct epithelial cells did not show any abnormalities in light microscopy and were not infected. CVB3-infected primary murine and human hepatocytes mount IFN- responses that confer ISG induction. qPCR analysis of primary human hepatocytes 24 hr after CVB3 infection showed upregulation of Ifn- and Isg15 mRNA expression, but not of Ifn-1 mRNA expression. we detected only very low amounts of IFN- protein in the supernatant of CVB3 infected primary human hepatocytes, while IFN-III levels were very abundant. in vitro CVB3 infected murine and human primary hepatocytes mount IFN- responses. pooled data from five similar experiments are shown. bars depict mean + SEM. primary human hepatocytes from donor 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 were CVB3 infected at MOI 0.1 for 2 hr. infected human hepatocytes showed abundant Mx induction at 12, 24, and 48 hpi. B18R treatment reduced this induction, while IFNLR treatment had only a modeate effect. RNAseq was performed on total RNA samples of two donors 24 hpi. hepatocytes showed exclusively IFNAR- and not IFNLR-dependent ISG induction. hepatocytes showed IFNAR- and not IFNLR-dependent ISG induction. hepatocytes prevented severe liver cell necrosis and dissemination of the virus to other organs. in vivo isolated primary murine hepatocytes mounted substantial IFN- responses. in a recent study, CVB3-infected mice with a cardiomyocyte-specific IFNAR ablation showed enhanced virus replication in the heart. hepatic IFN-I responses determined whether peripheral organs, such as the heart, were assaulted or not. hepatocytes and bile duct epithelial cells showed constitutive Mx2 induction. bile duct epithelial cells showed MX1 and ISG15 upregulation. bile duct epithelial cells showed MX1 and ISG15 upregulation. eloid cells showed normal survival of CVB3 infection and only moderate or no hepatitis. mice with a hepatocyte-specific IFNAR-deletion showed increased virus titers in the liver and the virus disseminated to other fully IFNAR competent peripheral organs. eloid cells showed normal survival of CVB3 infection and only moderate or no hepatitis. anoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) or its adaptor MDA-5-transducing mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) suggested the need of MAVS-dependent signaling in hepatocytes for the induction of IFN-I responses. hepatitis in LCMV-infected WT mice was moderate and without associated hepatocyte necrosis. in mice IFNAR signaling mediated critical ISG induction in hepatocytes. primary human hepatocytes expressed IFN- as well as IFN-. hepatocytes responded in vitro to IFN-III treatment. the relevance of IFN-I vs. IFN-III in the human liver during CVB3 infection needs to be better understood. hepatic IFN-I is critical to control CVB3 infection. hepatic IFN-I is critical to control CVB3 infection.
