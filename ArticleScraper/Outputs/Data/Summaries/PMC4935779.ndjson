{"summary": "3A tagged with GFP(S11) assembles with GFP(S1-10) to yield GFP fluorescence. a transposon-based insertion mutagenesis study revealed that the N-terminal region of poliovirus 3A tolerates small insertions (32, 37). Specifically, viable insertions were found after residues 2, 6, 9, 10 and 11. the next day, cells were fixed and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. the 3A protein was visualized with an antibody staining for p3A-myc. p3A(S11aa2) was visualized by the GFP fluorescence as a result of assembly with GFP(S1-10) GFP(S1-10) can assemble with 3A(S11aa2) to yield GFP fluorescence at the sites where 3A is localized in the cell. 3A(S11aa2) is able to perform the same functions as untagged 3A. enteroviruses hijack the Golgi-resident PI4KB via their 3A protein to ROs to enrich these membranes in PI4P (phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate), an essential lipid for viral RNA replication (22). PI4KB was present in a faint Golgi-like pattern in untransfected HeLa cells, whereas in 3A-transfected cells, an intense PI4KB signal was detected at membranes containing un 3A(S11aa2) interacted with GBF1 and ACBD3 in a mammalian two-hybrid system (38, 39, 45\u201347) similar to untagged 3A, 3A(S11aa2) interacted with GBF1 and ACBD3 even in the presence of overexpressed GFP(S1-10) tagging 3A with GFP(S11) results in a replication-competent CVB3 that generates fluorescent replication organelles. the tag was retained in the 3A protein without mutations. the tag was retained in 3A for five passages, further demonstrating that residue 2 is an amenable site. both infectious virus production and viral RNA levels of the tagged CVB3 were delayed compared to those of wt CVB3. this delay in replication has also been observed for recombinant polioviruses that encode 3A proteins with small epitope tags. in uninfected cells, GFP fluorescence was not observed throughout the cytoplasm but in a pattern that is reminiscent of a 3A staining pattern. this suggests that assembled, fluorescent GFP is found only at sites that contain 3A(S11aa2). this is likely the result of recruitment of GFP(S1-10) to sites where 3A is localized in cells. an uninfected cell and typical examples of cells early in infection (5 h p.i.) and later in infection (6 h p.i.) were stained with an anti-3A antibody. to ensure that GFP fluorescence is emitted from 3A(S11aa2) sites, cells from the same infection were stained with an anti-3A antibody. 3A(S11aa2) localizes to ROs that have tubule and DMV morphologies. cells were infected with CVB3-3A(S11aa2), stained with MitoTracker deep red FM. live-cell imaging reveals the dynamics of Golgi disassembly in live infected cells. live-cell confocal imaging was first carried out with a narrow pinhole (95.56 m) to detect the first local changes in Golgi structure during infection. GM130 was observed as a condensed perinuclear signal in uninfected cells or early in infection with CVB3-3A(S11aa2). however, the first 3A-GFP signal detected in infected cells was rarely associated with GM130. live-cell imaging reveals the association between 3A accumulation and local perturbation to Golgi morphology. cells transduced with mCherry-GM130 MLV particles were mock infected (A) or infected with CVB3-3A(S11aa2) (B) images were collected at 5-min intervals. bar, 10 m.

BGM cells were infected with CVB3 GFP(S1-10) 3A(S11aa2) cells were infected for 30 min at an MOI of 1. cells were subjected to titration analysis after freeze-thawing cycles to determine the amount of infectious virus particles. GM cells infected with CVB3-GFP(S1-10)-3A(S11aa2) accumulated a clear band at around 60 kDa, which corresponds to the precursor VP0 (36 kDa) fused to GFP(S1-10) we also examined CVB3-EGFP (EGFP stands for enhanced GFP) (27), which also is delayed in replication compared to wild-type CVB3 but not as severely as CVB3-GFP the dimmer signal is a result of the equimolar ratios of 3A(S11aa2) and GFP(S1-10) generated by this virus, while BGM(GFPS1-10) cells produce an excess of GFP(S1-10) the cleavage site may be unable to assemble with 3A(S11aa2) and/or become fluorescent. wild-type 3A in p3A-myc was replaced with this PCR product. the same strategy was used to introduce GFP(S11) or the StrepII tag (i.e., residues SAWSHPQFEK) in the infectious clone of CVB3 (p53CB3/T7) described elsewhere (64) a puromycin resistance gene was used for the production of stable cell lines. the plasmid pQCXIP or pRetroQ-mCherry containing the gene of interest was used to produce stable cell lines. pACT, pBIND, and pG5Luc (Luc stands for luciferase) vectors were from Promega. pBIND-GBF1 encoding the N terminus of GBF1, pACT-3A, and pBIND-3A were described previously. cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers as primers with a TaqMan reverse transcription reagent kit. cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers as primers with a TaqMan reverse transcription reagent kit. cells were transfected with 200 ng of plasmid DNA using Fugene6. cells were infected with CVB3-3A(S11aa2) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 to 10. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. cell washed with fluorobrite medium supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 25 mM HEPES just prior to imaging. cells were maintained in a live-cell imaging chamber at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. imaging was carried out from 2 h p.i. in a live-cell chamber at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 with a leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with a HyD detector and with a 63 (1.4-NA) oil immersion objective. for each position of interest, a low-resolution tile scan was taken of the surrounding area. the mitochondrial pattern in the EM images was compared with the MitoTracker deep red FM signal. this secondary marker was critical to determine the z-plane in the confocal data, the best fit of the EM cell section under analysis."}
