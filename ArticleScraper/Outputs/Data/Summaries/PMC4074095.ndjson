{"summary": "multi-method training needs assessment included reviews of competency domains needed to implement the international health regulations (2005). nine competency domains identified as essential for HERO staff were developed into priority in-service training modules. experts from academia and experienced practitioners prepared and delivered each module through lectures followed by interactive problem-solving exercises. reforms to strengthen emergency preparedness and response capabilities included new laws and regulations [7]\u2013[10], increased support for training and research, and the adoption of international best practice [2]\u2013[4], [11]. the HEROs within any one province collectively employ around 1000 staff members. the HEROs within any one province collectively employ around 1000 staff members. Australia developed a national framework for disaster health education to provide guidance for educators to achieve a standardized and integrated approach across the country [20]. the seven levels were defined as informing the community, raising awareness of health workers, providing basic knowledge and skills for health workers, advancing the knowledge of health workers and enhancing expert knowledge amongst a small group of health workers. the multi-method training needs assessment and subsequent steps of the ADDIE model were reviewed critically by a technical advisory panel. the panel offered suggestions for strengthening the curriculum development process, as well as the content, relevance and quality of the curriculum. self-administered questionnaires were sent to 115 HERO staff in china. a technical advisory panel (TAP) was appointed to critically review and offer comments and suggestions on all aspects of the needs assessment and curriculum development process. each module encompassed theories, laws, concepts and tools essential for HERO staff to perform effectively in their work. domains 1 to 8 were transcribed from both the IHR [13], [21] and the Chinese references [7], [10], [11]. study respondents suggested they be considered as discrete competency domains. the 1606 health staff responded to the curriculum development questionnaire. not all characteristics of the 1606 respondents at various levels were known. 11 of the 18 competency domains shown in Table 1 were to be developed into the individual modules shown in Table 3. they included six of the eight IHR-related competencies, while the remaining two, \u2018national legislation\u2019 and \u2018national co-ordination\u2019 were omitted because they were directed mainly at national-level decision-makers. case studies and desktop simulation exercise were ranked as the preferred training method by 94% of respondents, followed by lectures (85%) and case studies (85%). median preferred time for each module was 2.5 days. a case study designed by the facilitator was the assessment and management of the risk of an infectious disease outbreak at a conference attended by about 1000 international participants. each small group would then be expected to present a 20 minute report for further discussions at a plenary, with a synthesis of key learning points. each of the five phases of this model were reviewed critically by a technical advisory panel. the panel offered suggestions for strengthening the curriculum development process. the multi-method training needs assessment and subsequent steps of the ADDIE model are detailed below. self-administered questionnaires collected data on the same issues. they included health emergency experts from the government, the military and the academic sector, and senior staff of HEROs. they also explored their awareness of existing training activities and the associated relative strengths and weaknesses. domains 1 to 8 were transcribed from both the IHR [13], [21] and the Chinese references [7], [10], [11]. study respondents suggested they be considered discrete competency domains. 45% of respondents had worked previously as clinical practitioners, 35% as preventive health practitioners, and 8% as health administrators. 58% had less than 5 years experience in emergency response work. the respondents, key informants and the Technical Advisory Panel identified major weaknesses in existing training programs. they stressed the need for adopting interactive learning methods and problem-solving exercises in the classroom. they supported replacing the \u2018hazard-specific\u2019 approach with the \u2018all hazards\u2019 approach to managing emergencies. the number of respondents who expressed a high level of need for these modules is shown in Table 3. case studies and desktop simulation exercise were ranked as the preferred training method by 94% of respondents. the median preferred time for each module was 2.5 days. participants were expected to review and revise their jurisdictional plan using a similar learning approach with their local team members. each small group would then be expected to present a 20 minute report for further discussions at a plenary, with a synthesis of key learning points. study on developing in-service curriculum for new professional cadre of HERO staff from across the country adds to literature on china\u2019s health reforms. it describes the multi-method approach used to identify training needs systematically, and to adopt international best practice in partnership with senior decision-makers and content experts. the process required active engagement with experts in government, academia and the military, as well as input from 1606 immediate potential beneficiaries. the curriculum marks the beginning of a new journey for strengthening the performance of the recently established HEROs in jurisdictions across China. the initial effort focused strongly on meeting the WHO requirements for developing the core capacities required to implement the IHR [21] and in particular, to strengthen the competencies of the \u201clevel four\u201d health staff [20] who play lead roles in emergency planning and management. training must be linked with an appropriate performance support system [31] that motivates staff to apply the newly acquired knowledge and skills, and in this way, to start contributing effectively and creatively to the workplace. the support system includes explicit guidelines, supervision as well as feedback on the quality of their performance."}
