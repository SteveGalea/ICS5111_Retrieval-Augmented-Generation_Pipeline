{"summary": "proteomics addresses identification, profiling and structure/function of proteins at a cellular or organism level (2,3) transcriptomics is widely used for studying genome-wide gene expression patterns and regulatory networks. most of these data repositories host individual data types and do not provide organism-wide integration of genomic, transcriptomics and proteomic data. the RC is a unique publicly available proteomics data resource. it hosts a wide range of \u2018omics\u2019 data sets on pathogen and host interactions. it integrates all experiment data submitted by PRCs to illustrate gene or protein functions involved in pathogen biology, and host and pathogen interaction. data integration Data is integrated in a protein-centric manner by mapping all proteins and genes in the experimental results to UniProtKB (14) or UniParc (15) accession numbers. RC created identifiers for gene(s)/protein(s) that could not be mapped to the existing databases. 167 outer membrane proteins were identified as interesting targets and released on the RC website. about 700 proteins from C. parvum and 2400 proteins from T. gondii have been identified and released on the RC website. microarray and mass spectrometry are attempting to deliver a functional and structure catalog of the SARS-CoV proteome in order to initiate a comprehensive program for therapeutic intervention. the experiment data model supports multiple data types from transcriptomics, proteomics and genomics experiments. common features across experiment types, such as experiment metadata and sample attributes, are modeled in generic data structures. available data The currently available data sets and data types, reagents and the corresponding organisms at the RC are listed in Table 1. Currently, 167 outer membrane proteins were identified as interesting targets and released on the RC website. racis Yersinia pestis Homo sapiens Protein\u2013protein interactions were carried out through random two-hybrid screening and directed screening technologies. two data sets using directed screened interactions among 67 proteins from Homo sapiens and 2 proteins from B. anthracis and 4 proteins of Y. pestis were released on the website. the predicted complete proteomes of organisms, as well as the annotation data extracted from the iProClass database, are available at the link (http://www.proteomicsresource.org/Resources/Catalog.aspx). DATA DISSEMINATION All data stored in the RC are publicly available for query through the web navigation system at http://www.proteomicsresource.org/. specific individual or group gene(s)/protein(s) in which the user is interested can be searched by entering keyword(s) or UniProtKB ID(s) and the search results can be exported as well. experimental results data provided by the PRCs can be downloaded from the FTP site. a variety of protein analysis tools are provided to allow further analysis of search results (e.g. BLAST, peptide match, etc.) search results are linked to the underlying experiment data allowing data type specific analysis and visualization. two data analysis tools are described subsequently. a GO term result frequency diagram is returned that provides the user with an overview of the GO terms. a gene group from the experiment ID \u2018UOM_MA_07\u2019 can be submitted for AmiGO analysis using the \u2018GO analysis\u2019 button at the bottom of the page. a database of GO terms, for organisms listed in Table 1, has been built into the RC system. the RC provides the scientific community with integrated, heterogeneous, experimental data and comprehensive protein annotation. the RC provides the scientific community with integrated, heterogeneous, experimental data and comprehensive protein annotation. a summary table of mitogen-activated protein information is presented. the table can be customized with \u2018Display Options\u2019. the user can navigate to the comprehensive annotation data of the mitogen-activated protein. all genes/proteins from the organism data will be listed with rich annotation. the user can navigate to 'experiment summaries' by clicking on Experiment ID to find any experiments containing data on that protein. the user can navigate to the comprehensive annotation data of the mitogen-activated gene. the user can also start at the individual protein level and navigate to the experiments containing data for them. the goal of the biodefense proteomics program is to generate and make publicly available the experimental data from characterization of the pathogen proteome, pathogen and host interactions, mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis, and selected host innate and adaptive immune responses to infectious agents. it is anticipated that this proteomics program will provide a research resource to the scientific community to discover potential candidates for the next generation of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. the available data in the RC greatly facilitates the analysis of the host and pathogen interaction using the framework of cyberinfrastructure built at the RC (26\u201330). a researcher can query all proteins that have been experimentally demonstrated to interact with secretion system chaperones and further refine that list by choosing those proteins that have been annotated as having signal peptide characteristics. bioinformatics, genome-sequencing and high-throughput genome-wide experimentation have led to characterization of complex components pathosystems. the available data in the RC greatly facilitates the analysis of the host and pathogen interaction using the framework of cyberinfrastructure built at the RC (26\u201330) several data sets including mass spectrometry, gene expression microarray, protein 3D structure and genomic clone data are available for public access. as more data are integrated into the resource, it will become an even more valuable tool for the scientific community."}
