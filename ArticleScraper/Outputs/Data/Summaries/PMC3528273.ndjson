{"summary": "avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IB), causes respiratory infection and diarrhoea in cattle. bovine coronavirus (BCoV) causes respiratory infection and diarrhoea in cattle, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) cause vomiting and wasting disease in pigs. expression of the nsps triggers the rearrangement of host cell membranes. it is likely that expression of the membrane associated nsps 3, 4 and 6 is responsible for inducing these rearrangements. however, the precise mechanism by which nsps induce membrane rearrangements remains to be elucidated. membranes in SARS-CoV infected cells were derived from and joined to the rough ER. outer membranes of the DMVs were interlinked, studded with ribosomes and were also joined to the convoluted membranes and ER. a detailed analysis of the membrane rearrangements triggered by IBV infection of mammalian vero cells remains to be performed. autophagy autophagy is a cellular pathway for self-degradation. it allows a cell to degrade long-lived proteins, aggregated proteins and organelles during periods of starvation. this pathway allows a cell to degrade long-lived proteins, aggregated proteins and organelles during periods of starvation. formation of the autophagosome proceeds by addition of new membrane to the phagophore, as opposed to budding from an existing membrane. recruitment of these proteins occurs via the generation of PI3P by the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex (PI3K), including BECN1. ATG12 becomes conjugated to ATG5 in a process requiring the enzyme ATG7 and the enzyme ATG10. this complex localises to the phagophore and can determine the site of conjugation of the second Ubl system. microtubule associated protein 1B light chain 3 (LC3) is initially cleaved by ATG4 near the C-terminus at position G120 to generate cytoplasmic LC3-II. many viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade autophagy by inhibiting the pathway, or diverting the process to benefit virus replication. many viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade autophagy by inhibiting the pathway, or diverting the process to benefit virus replication. initial work showed that MHV infection induced autophagy. MHV replication was markedly reduced in ATG5/ embryonic stem cells. further work using SARS-CoV again showed co-localisation between nsp8 and LC3. all studies indicated that LC3 became punctate upon coronavirus infection, suggesting an induction of autophagy. nsp6 induced autophagosomes fused with lysosomes and autophagosomes were susceptible to wortmannin treatment. nsp6 homologues from MHV, MHV and arterivirus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus also induced autophagy. MHV replication does not require the complete autophagy pathway, or conversion of LC3I to LC3II, in agreement with previous work. MHV RTCs co-localise with markers for cellular EDEMosomes [56,57], vesicles involved in ERAD tuning and knockdown of EDEMosome cargo receptor SEL1L reduced virus replication. Detailed characterisation of membrane structures induced in cells infected with alphacoronaviruses, MHV and SARS-CoV needs to be performed. the location of RTC assembly and the site of viral RNA transcription and replication need to be identified. the mechanism by which these rearrangements are generated is not understood. is autophagy acting as a cellular defence to virus infection. does the virus have mechanisms to control this response?"}
