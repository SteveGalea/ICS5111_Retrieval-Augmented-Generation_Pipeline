{"summary": "nosocomial infections have become a global concern recognized as a major patient safety issue. prolonged hospitalization due to nosocomial infections increases costs and unnecessary expenses for the hospital. many people realize again the importance of strengthening nosocomial infection control at hospitals in developing countries. between 2000 and 2009, they have contributed to the promotion of nosocomial infection control in Vietnam in collaboration with leading hospitals [10, 11]. since 2010, in response to the growing concern regarding nosocomial infections, we have focused our efforts in Nepal through collaboration with Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH) ourocomial infection control committee, nosocomial infection control department, infection control team, manual for nosocomial infection control 3 Surveillance conditions Staff who have received training on nosocomial infection control or not, Plan of holding \"in-service training\" 7 Current problems Requested the hospital to describe the current problems. technical cooperation project and fact-finding survey at TUTH TUTH was established in 1980 with the assistance of a grant-aid from the japanese government as the first medical school in Nepal. TUTH is playing a leading role in medical care as well as human resource development in Nepal as the oldest and one of the most advanced medical schools. questionnaire was developed based on the previous surveys in Vietnam [11]. the questionnaire consisted of the following items: \"general information of the hospitals, control system including manual and infection control committees\" the recovered data were processed using SPSS Ver19 for Windows. in some hospitals, direct observations were conducted to determine the actual situation of ICC, manuals, current problems and awareness level of hospital staff regarding nosocomial infection control. study was performed by direct observation and interviews with heads of the departments of clinical microbiology and pharmacology and doctors of internal medicines. ethical approval was obtained from the Institute of Medicine, Kathmandu, Nepal prior to using the questionnaire in the target hospitals. no hospital was equipped with sufficient quantity of N95 masks and goggles. 81.3% of hospitals responded that the preparation level for novel influenza was poor or slight. only one hospital had a plan of zoning formulated according to the risk of infection. ial infection cases at 62.5% (10/16) of the hospitals and 6.3% (1/16) of the hospitals for some cases were regularly carried out in 43.8% (7/16) of the hospitals in the survey. seven hospitals had a strong interest in cooperating with foreign hospitals. the first ICC in Nepal was established in 1988 at TUTH. in-service training has been conducted for most of the staff at TUTH. a comparatively good infection control manual was prepared. manuals for infection control were used in 52.9% (9/17) of the hospitals. only three hospitals had manuals for novel influenza. an infection control committee (ICC) was established in 41.2% (7/17) of the hospitals. hospital staff received training for nosocomial infection control None 7 Majority of staff 2 Hospital held in-service training for nosocomial infection control No 10 Yes 6 Hospital held in-service training on novel influenza No 15 Yes 1 Training: training programs including those organized by other hospitals and the hospital that the staff belong to. general information on hospitals The average number of beds in the surveyed hospitals was as follows: national hospitals; 372 (150\u2013497), private hospitals; 206 (50\u2013750), other hospitals 328 (156\u2013500) the average number of clinical departments was as follows: national hospitals; 18.0 (14\u201322), private hospitals 9.7 (6\u201315); other hospitals 17.5 (15\u201320). six hospitals (four national hospitals, one private hospital and one other hospital) were organizing training programs for their staff. one had already conducted a training program on SARS and/or novel influenza. only one hospital had a plan of zoning formulated according to the risk. seven hospitals had a strong interest in cooperating with foreign hospitals. a particularly strong expectation was observed regarding research support, information supply, PPE provision, and guidance in building an effective control system. in-service training has been conducted for most of the staff at TUTH. in-service training has been conducted for most of the staff at TUTH. a comparatively good infection control manual was prepared. an increasing number of hospitals have been establishing ICCs in recent years. but the management and implementation of activities need further improvement. detailed status of nosocomial infections and their causative agents should be strictly monitored and properly utilized in clinical practice. Nepal has not experienced a SARS outbreak, and no human case of avian influenza has been reported to date. awareness of nosocomial infection control seems to be lagging behind countries where a SARS outbreak did occur. a foundation for appropriate nosocomial infection control is also considered useful for novel influenza control. a significant disparity exists between major cities and rural areas. in the future, the expansion of nosocomial infection control to hospitals in remote areas will be needed."}
