{"summary": "7733 consenting cases of febrile respiratory illness (FRI) had clinical data and nasal washes collected prospectively. 49% of cases tested positive for at least one virus, of whom 10% had multiple infections. most frequent etiologies for mono-infections among FRI cases were Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (13%), Influenza B (13%) and coxsackevirus (9%). in the tropics, viral respiratory pathogens exhibit different seasonality and transmission characteristics compared to temperate climates. the year-round circulation of respiratory viruses in the tropics may also predispose patients to co-infection with multiple pathogens, with implications for severity of disease [10,11] and secondary bacteria infection [12,13]. ILI is defined as fever 38.0\u00b0C with cough or sore throat. this allows for detection of a larger number of respiratory pathogens. patients who visited primary healthcare clinics in the camps between 11 May 2009 and 31 October 2012 were recruited. the assays are multiplex PCR assays coupled with bead array detection technology. the assays can simultaneously detect and subtype 18 different pathogens including influenza A (FLU-A) and influenza B (FLU-B) logistic regression analysis was performed to compare the risk of having an individual symptom/sign among viral mono-infections. non-significant variables were dropped at a significance level of 0.05 to obtain the final model. patients who visited primary healthcare clinics in the camps between 11 May 2009 and 31 October 2012 who met the FRI criteria were recruited. a total of 20 l of extract were extracted using the DNA minikit (Qiagen, Inc, Valencia, CA, USA) the assays are multiplex PCR assays coupled with bead array detection technology. Specimens that were Resplex II positive for FLU-A were further subtyped with real-time PCR for H1 or H3 (Singapore Ministry of Health), or for FLU-A(H1N1)pdm09. logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the differences in symptom expressions for each pair. to assess the presence of paired symptoms/signs for all viruses, we conducted binomial tests. the peak in June and July 2009 corresponds to the FLU-A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic [16]. as the FLU-B cases fell, Adenovirus E (ADV-E) cases started to increase. influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (FLU-A(H1N1)pdm09) etiologies of selected infections are illustrated in Table 2. at least one virus was detected in 3794 of the 7733 FRI cases (49.1%) of the 3794 cases, more than one virus was detected. ie/Echovirus 708 (9.2) 318 (4.1) 37 (2.8) 324 (9.4) Influenza B 604 (7.8) 449 (5.8) 7 (0.5) 441 (12.9) Rhinovirus 574 (7.4) 220 (2.8) 24 (1.8) 257 (7.5) Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 568 (7.3) 393 (5.1) 3 (0.2) 459 (13.4) Adenovirus E 516 (6.7) 3 more than 60% of patients with influenza and adenovirus infections presented with ILI. but several other viral infections led to high rates of ILI. the sensivity, specifity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of ILI for influenza was 72.2%, 48.1%, 40.1% and 69.3% respectively. Coronavirus 229E 0.6 (0.3 to 1.1) 40.0 (22.7 to 59.4) Coronavirus NL63 0.8 (0.5 to 1.4) 47.1 (29.8 to 64.9) Coronavirus OC43 1.7 (1.2 to 2.4) 38.6 (28.1 to 49.9) Coronavirus 0.0 (0.0 to 0.2) 0.0 (0.0 to 0.2) 0.0 (0.0 to 97.5) Non-viral aetiologies accounted for 33.9% of the I coV-OC43 and hMPV were more likely to cause dry cough. EV and hMPV were more likely to cause fever 38.0\u00b0C. if the observed proportion is lower than the expected proportion, the cell will be shaded by blue color. if the observed proportion is lower than the expected proportion, the cell will be shaded by blue color, and red color otherwise. the initial peak corresponded to the FLU-A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic [21], with the subsequent lower incidence likely due to vaccination with the pandemic vaccine a year before seasonal vaccination was started. prevalence of pathogens varied throughout, with some negative correlation observed between the viruses. the high incidence of CV warrants further study. previous studies have identified a co-infection rate of 11.0 to 47.0% [6,11,24,33,34] for viruses. this is higher than the 9.9% found in this study. the heterogeneity of results across different studies highlights the difficulty of using clinical symptoms in determining the etiology of ILI. we also detected a small proportion of asymptomatic individuals who tested positive for the various viruses. this could represent carriage without infection or subclinical/asymptomatic infections during periods of virus circulation. early etiologic diagnosis of influenza has been shown to be cost effective [42] with reduced antibiotic use. it may be possible to combine a clinical diagnostic model with rapid testing to achieve these goals. limitations The analysis was limited to viral mono-infections. future studies should explore co-infections and bacterial infections.
