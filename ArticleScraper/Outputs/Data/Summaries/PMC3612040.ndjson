{"summary": "human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are typed into seven species (A to G) with greater than 64 genome types reported in which the associations for specific human diseases are characterized [1], [2]. Specifically, within species B, HAdV-B3, -B7, -B16, and -B21, belonging to subspecies B1, are respiratory tract pathogens, as are HAdV-B14, -B35 and -B55, the genome was sequenced, analyzed, and compared with other reference adenovirus genome sequences archived in GenBank. it is nearly identical to a HAdV-B14p1 strain (303600) recently characterized from an outbreak in the USA (2006). genome DNA was extracted from 140 l of infected cell lysate using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Ltd.; Germany), applied according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. a PCR strategy with 64 primer pairs was employed to amplify the whole genome with overlapping fragments. DNA sequence alignments were revealed using the bioEdit sequence alignment editor software (v5.0.9; T. Hall, North Carolina State University) all sequences were submitted for BLAST analysis (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi/) the annotated coding sequences corresponded to their counterparts from other HAdV genomes.

DNA sequencing Amplified genomic fragments were purified using agarose gel electrophoresis with a QIAquick gel extraction kit. Sanger-based DNA sequencing reactions were performed bi-directionally using an ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit. genome was assembled using Sequencher (v4.0.5; Gene Codes, Inc.; Ann Arbor, MI) genome and gene phylogenetic analysis were re-aligned and re-assembled into a single consensus sequence using the software MEGA v4.0 (Molecular Genetic Analysis Software; http://www.megasoftware.net). Phylogenetic analysis was performed via the maximum-composite-likelihood method that generated neighbor-joining and bootstrapped trees of phylogeny.

'true' adenovirus type 11 viruses are renal tract pathogens, i.e., HAdV-B11p, -B11b, and \u2013B11c. improved detection, identification, and high resolution analysis of the genomes of these highly contagious emergent and re-emergent pathogens will enable a better understanding of this virus. HAdV-B14p1 genomes, hexon, fiber, and E1A genomes show high levels of identity, suggesting a common ancestry. phylogenetic analysis of the three genes support partition of HAdVs into species, originally based on biological, epidemiological, and structural attributes. of these, HAdV-B14 and -B55 are recent re-emergent respiratory pathogens. an epidemiological investigation was not able to determine the origins of the child's HAdV-B14p1 viral infection. new strains of HAdVs are problematic if there is no herd immunity present to counter that specific virus. HAdV-B55 is an emergent pathogen in china as HAdV-B55 is responsible for a large respiratory disease outbreak in 2006. phylogenetic survey and protein percent identity analysis support this view. this particular type 14 genome data will enable the identification and further understanding of any future emergent recombinant HAdV resulting from adenovirus type 14. 29] were deposited in GenBank. they are available under the following accession numbers."}
