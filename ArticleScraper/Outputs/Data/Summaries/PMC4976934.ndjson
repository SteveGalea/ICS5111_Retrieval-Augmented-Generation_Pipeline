{"summary": "study aims to describe the viral etiologies, the demographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics of children under two years of age who were hospitalized with a lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) focusing on RSV (prevalence, seasonality, subgroups, viral load) and its association with disease severity. syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in young children. 50% of children are infected during their first year of life. by 3 years of age, 100% have experienced at least one infection. criteria were age between 1 month to 2 years, cough, a clinical diagnosis of LRTI based on WHO criteria. exclusion criteria were patients with known non-respiratory or non-infectious respiratory diseases such as asthma. EDTA blood were used for whole blood cells counting, and liver enzyme measurement by CH1 and CH2 laboratory. the multiplex real-time PCR detects 13 other human respiratory viruses. influenza virus A (flu A); influenza virus B (flu B); adenovirus (AdV), enterovirus (EnV), human metapneumovirus (MPV), human coronaviruses (CoV-229E, HKU1, SARS CoV & NL63), human rhinovirus (RV A, B and C), parainfluenza virus 1, 2 and 3, 4 (PIV1, a higher clinical score indicates more severe disease. ALT and AST levels were considered to be elevated if above 36 IU/l and above 58 IU/l respectively. all statistical tests were performed as two-tailed tests at 5% significance in either R version 2.13.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) or Intercooled Stata version 9.2 (College Station, TX, USA) study participants. children from the Respiratory Wards (RW), Emergency Care Units (ECU) and Intensive Care Units were eligible for inclusion in the study. RNA was analyzed by multiplex real-time RT-PCR on a Roche Light Cycler 480 II Thermocycler (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) [9, 10] and RSV Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA) Real-time RT-PCR (LNA assay) on a DNA Engine Peltier Thermocycler and Chromo 4 real-time PCR system detector. clinical severity score was introduced to grade clinical status of patients at enrolment. only patients from whom all components in the score table were available were given a clinical severity score. long hospitalization was defined as longer than 7 days. smoker(s), number of members at home, fever, RSV infection (RSV positivity, viral load, and subgroup) and RV infection (RV positivity as single infection or co-infection with RSV) the models\u2019 predictive ability was investigated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model. rates from 60\u201374 per min 2 Respiratory rates from > 75 per min 3 Chest indrawing 2 Wheezing 1 Stridor 1 Apnea 3 Cyanosis 3 Low SpO2 (92) or under oxygen 3 NCPAP or CPAP or ventilated during hospitalization 4 High ALT** 1 * A higher clinical score indicates more severe disease. all statistical tests were performed as two-tailed tests at 5% significance in either R version 2.13.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) or Intercooled Stata version 9.2 (College Station, TX, USA) results Demographic, clinical features and viral etiologies of study population A total of 632 children aged 1\u201324 months were enrolled into the study between May 2009 and December 2010. only 18/598 (3%) had blood culture test which was part of standard clinical care at hospitals. only 5/18 were positive (1 Staphylococcus aureus, 1 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Haemophilus influenzae, 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 Klebsiella spp). 535/632 (85%) children received antibiotics, 100% children with clinical diagnosis of pneumonia received antibiotics.
