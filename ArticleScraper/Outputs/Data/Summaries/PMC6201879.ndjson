{"summary": "molluscicide was originally developed and marketed as a molluscicide by Bayer in the late 1950s. it was later found to be an effective anti-helmintic and has been used in the clinic for decades to treat intestinal tapeworm infections in humans. niclosamide has been shown to be relatively safe after a single dose, but it is unclear if chronic treatment with niclosamide would lead to adverse effects. niclosamide has been identified in several screens as a compound with broad anti-cancer activity. this has been attributed to its ability to regulate multiple cellular signaling pathways frequently dysregulated in cancer biology. we also identified niclosamide in a high throughput screen focused on identifying modulators of non-classical peroxisome biogenesis. niclosamide derivatives have divergent activities on ATP homeostasis and the Wnt pathway. niclosamide derivatives that lack uncoupling activity can be made with improved pharmacological properties to treat different indications. PH5CH8 cells were authenticated using STR profiling (Genetica) and compared to reference databases (ATCC, DSMZ and Cellasuarus) to exclude contamination with known cell lines. human embryonic kidney (HEK 293T cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in complete DMEM containing 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. 20 l of compound or DMSO was first diluted in 10-point 2-fold format in a 96-well plate and 1l of each compound was directly dispensed to each well. after 4 hours, 20 l of media with compound was removed from each well using the biomek NX workstation. cells were cultured for an additional 72 hours to induce de novo lipid synthesis. image analysis was performed using open source Cell Profiler software. a pipeline was developed to automatically identify nuclei, cytoplasm and for feature extraction. the typical steatotic \u201cfingerprint\u201d score represents approximately 45 individual features. HEK293 cells stably transduced with the human OCT3 transporter were plated in black-walled microclear plates at 60,000 cells per well in growth medium. cells were incubated overnight to allow attachment before growth medium was removed and replaced with 150L of assay medium containing compound dilution. a value of p0.05 was considered statistically significant. protein extraction and immunoblotting HEK293T cells were seeded in 6 well plates and cultured to 50\u201360% confluence. Western blotting of mouse liver tissue lysates was performed as described previously [31]. a dilution of 1:2000 was performed using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System. the differences between the control (DMSO) and the compound treated wells were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Dunnett\u2019s post hoc test. p0.05 was considered to be significant. 0.3\u20130.8 min (5\u2013100%B), 0.8\u20131.2 min (100%B), 1.2\u20131.5 min (100\u20135%B), 1.5\u20132.0 min (5%B) method 2: Injection volume: 1 L; Gradient: 0\u20130.3 min (20%B), 0.3\u20130.8 min (20\u2013100%B), 0.8\u20131.2 min (100\u201320%B), 1.5\u20132.0 min (5%B). blood samples were centrifuged at 2,000 g for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C. plasma samples were stored at -7515\u00b0C prior to analysis. plasma samples were then thawed and analyzed by LC-MS/MS method. mice were bought from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and were singly housed at constant temperature and light/dark cycles of 12 hours a day. all experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. histological examination was performed using an Aperio ScanScope slide scanner. degrees of steatosis were graded as follows: 5%:0, 5\u201333%:1, 33\u201366%:2, 66\u2013100%:3. commercially available reagents for the synthesis described below were used as received. a full description of the synthetic protocol for all molecules described herein is available in S1 supporting information. PH5CH8 cells are not commercially available and short Tandem Repeat (STR) profiles are not in existing databases. PH5CH8 cells were harvested and counted using a Vi-Cell XR (Beckman-Coulter) and seeded at 3000 cells per well in 200 l of PH5CH8 culture media. after 48 h, the media was removed and replaced with 200 l of fresh culture media. Hoechst-33342 was added to each well and incubated at 37\u00b0C. cells were then washed once with 100 l PBS and HCS LipidTOX green neutral lipid stain (Thermosfisher) was applied following a 1:1000 dilution in PBS. the plates were sealed with aluminum foil using a Thermo-ABgene plate sealer. data were normalized to percent control (NPC) using the equation NPC = (Xi-\u2014C-)/(C+\u2014C-) x100. the values were averaged and compounds were identified as positive hits if they reduced steatotic phenotype by more than 45% relative to maximum signal control. a ratiometric analysis was performed to determine changes in the Lifetime fluorescence signal: Lifetime (s)[T] = (D2-D1)/ln(W1/W2), where D is delay; W is fluorescence window value at each time point. the differences between the control (DMSO) and compound treated wells were analyzed using the Student\u2019s t-test. phospho-AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Thr 172; Cell Signaling #2535), total AMPK (Cell Signaling #2603), Fatty acid synthase (FAS); and carbonic Anhydrase 3 (CAR3; Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc-50715) were used at a dilution of 1:2000. 16L of lysate was transferred to white 384 well small volume assay plate. antibody dyes were added per assay protocol. quantitation was performed on a PHERAstar (BMG) MS/MS using a (Shimadzu corporation) LC system coupled to a Shimadzu Triple Quad 5500 mass spectrometer with an ESI interface. the system used a waters XSelect HSS T3 C18, 2.5m, 2.1 x 50 mm column eluted with one of two methods using mobile phases A (water, 0.1% formic acid) and B (acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) 0.2ml of blood was collected pre- and 0.5, 1, 2, 4 8 12 and 24 hours after dosing. blood samples were centrifuged at 2,000 g for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C. negative control chemicals were 2-Aminoanthracene (2-AA) for all S9 activation experiments, 2-nitrofluorene (2-NF) for TA98, Sodium Azide (2-NF) for TA100 and TA1535, Sodium Azide (SA) for TA1535, TA1535 and N-methyl-N\u2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) for WP2 uvrA. mice fed standard chow diet were used as controls and remained untreated. mice were humanely euthanized, the entire liver was excised and liver color was immediately evaluated. steatosis was classified as microvesicular, macrovesicular or mixed. score for hepatic steatosis using the sham animals as controls (steatosis score of 1.0) Statistical analysis was performed using JMP 12 and GraphPad Prism7. data are presented as mean SE. images of unstimulated and stimulated cells were captured on a cellomics/Thermofisher CX5 automated high-content microscope using an Olympus 20X LWD/0.7NA objective. images of unstimulated and stimulated cells were collected and automated image analysis was performed to tabulate the cellular lipid content (green channel) control wells and stimulated cells treated with 1 M niclosamide (F) red lines represent mean and standard error of stimulated and unstimulated cells. we further developed a custom image-processing algorithm and data analysis pipeline based on the open source Cell Profiler software platform. this enabled accurate quantitation of the steatotic phenotype and key cellular features. niclosamide, Metformin and Triacsin C inhibited the steatosis phenotype. niclosamide reduced steatosis by 92 19% and 77 12% respectively. niclosamide imparts poor solubility, limits oral bioavailability. our initial goal was to improve absorption characteristics of experimental compounds by replacing the aromatic nitro group with an electron withdrawing ester or acid moiety. the strong electron withdrawing nitro group has also been associated with increased protonophore activity which is believed to be the underlying mechanism by which niclosamide affects ATP synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation. of the 11 compounds, 7 had greater predicted solubility compared to niclosamide that was -4.76 logS. the predicted solubility of 600657 was best with a value of -0.36 logS followed by 600494 (-2.16 logS), 500200 (-2.21 logS) and 500873 (-2.51 logS) ylbenzamides with in vitro activity for attenuating the hepatic steatosis phenotype were tested using the Mitoexpress Xtra-Oxygen Consumption Assay kit. the phenylbenzamides derivatives produced varied responses in the OCR assay ranging from no change in respiration for 500200, 600657, 600489, 500873, and 600494 to significant changes for 500199, 600655, 60065 changes with * indicate statistically significant (p0.05) OCR values compared to basal OCR values. phospho-AMPK Thr-172 (p-AMPK) levels were evaluated by Western blot in HEK293 cells treated with the phenylbenzamide derivatives. 57 did not appear to stimulate phosphorylation of AMPK or increase oxygen consumption rate. 600489 stimulated phosphorylation of AMPK only at the highest concentration. cell lysate was seeded at 10,000 cells per well 24 hours prior to treatment. 16L of cell lysate was incubated with HTRF phospho-AMPK detection reagents. verapamil performed as expected as assessed by the percentage of the initial concentration of compound remaining after 1 hour with only 7.5% and 4.5% remaining after 60 min in HLM and MLM preparations respectively. 600494 exhibited the greatest metabolic stability with 99.4% and 109.6% of the initial concentration remaining after 60 minutes in HLM and MLM respectively. tested sample 64.2 Negative Control 97.7 Heat-inactivated Control 91.1 Mouse Tested Sample 107.5 Negative Control 106.4 Heat-inactivated Control 105.5 600494 Human Tested Sample 99.4 Negative Control 92.8 Heat-inactivated Control 98.5 We next explored pharmacokinetics profiles in Sprague Dawley rats following oral and IV administration of four of these compounds.

surrogate for kinase activity. 500199, 500200 and 600453 were also analyzed for effects on p-AMPK Thr-172, FAS and CAIII. treatment of HFD fed-DIO mice with 10mg/kg of 500199, 500200 and 600453 for 12 days also stimulated phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr-172, and reduced FAS and CAIII protein levels. the steatosis score was used to evaluate the livers, scoring microvesicular or macrovesicular steatosis and fatty infiltration zonality. sham animals typically had greater than 70% steatosis resulting in a steatosis score of 3.0. niclosamide, 600453 and 500199 reduced the mean percentage of steatosis to 38% and 19% respectively. 20-week old animals were treated IP with 500199 at 10 or 25mg/kg. at day 0, 3, 6 and 9 animals were weighed and tissue samples were collected for standard histological scoring of hepatic steatosis. 500199 improves fatty coat phenotype in high fat diet fed mice. the effect of low and high dose 500199 on hepatic steatosis phenotype on day 6 of treatment. animals treated with 500199 showed a dose dependent improvement in steatotic phenotype. this quantitative analysis can be used along-side comprehensive manual histological scoring to measure changes in the steatotic phenotype. liver X receptors (LXR), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) are required for the transcriptional control of SREBP-1c by insulin. cells were fixed and labeled with HCS LipidTOX green neutral lipid stain. images of unstimulated and stimulated cells were captured on a cell-permeant nuclear counterstain. the unstimulated positive control shown in Fig 1B and 1E represents the basal lipid content for PH5CH8 cells. the insulin and T0901317 stimulated negative control cells accumulated significant lipid droplets. this phenotype was ameliorated by niclosamide as demonstrated by the lipid droplet accumulation in panel F. the score is normalized per-plate to 0\u2013100% effect using the \"unstimulated control\" and \"stimulated + DMSO Vehicle\" as controls. niclosamide, Metformin and niclosamide both inhibited the steatosis phenotype in this platform. phenylbenzamides used this platform to systematically explore the phenylbenzamide chemotype. the nitro group on niclosamide imparts poor solubility, limits oral bioavailability and is a potentially liver-toxic moiety. we hypothesized that by removing the nitro group we may disrupt the mitochondrial uncoupling activity of niclosamide. all newly synthesized compounds were tested using 10-point, 2-fold dilutions ranging between 1M and 1.9nM. of those tested, 52 compounds were designated as active. clogP and cLogD values and IC50 for each derivative are shown. the predicted aqueous solubility* at pH 7.4, cLogP, and cLogD (pH 7.4) were calculated using instant Jchem or MarvinSketch. inhibition of steatotic phenotype was quantified in PH5CH8 liver cells. no change in respiration for 500200, 600657, 600489, 500873, and 600494. phenylbenzamide derivatives showed a dose dependent increase in OCR. 500833 and 500832 were only significantly elevated at 1M. p-AMPK Thr-172 was evaluated in HEK293T cells. 500199 but not its acid form 500200 stimulated phosphorylation of AMPK peaking at 5 M. 600655, 500832, 500833, 600653 and 600453 also stimulated phosphorylation of AMPK. cells were seeded at 10,000 cells per well 24 hours prior to treatment. 16L of cell lysate was incubated with HTRF phospho-AMPK detection reagents. the unstimulated (DMSO) and positive controls lysates are shown in green and red respectively. 89 was found to be completely degraded after 60 min. 3.1% remaining in HLM and 2.7% remaining in MLM. phenylbenzamide derivatives significantly improved oral bioavailability. a single oral dose of 5mg/kg of 600453 formulated in PBS gave a peak plasma concentration of 2050ng/ml. a peak plasma concentration of 1850ng/ml and 5.3-hour half-life correlated to

niclosamide. treatment of sham animals with 10mg/kg of 500199, 500200 and 600453 for 12 days also stimulated phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr-172. the livers of treated animals became darker red in color compared to the sham HFD-fed animals, which were visibly lighter and tan in color due to ectopic fat accumulation. histological analysis of the lower left lobe from treated mice showed an improvement in macro- and micro- steatosis within 12 days. 500873 (28% steatosis) and 600494 (25% steatosis) also showed reduced steatosis with a score of 1.25. in some cases, livers more closely resembled livers from standard chow fed mouse with 5% steatosis. steatosis stained whole liver sections (A) and body weight in grams (B) of HFD-fed mice with and without 500199 administration at 10 or 25mg/kg by I.P for 9 days. s of treated animals were drier, consistent with reduction in triglycerides. the effect was greater in some animals than others. in general we observed changes in coat appearance with niclosamide, 500199 and 500832 treated animals. mook et. al. recently showed inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation can be separated from uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and alterations in cellular ATP. the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation leads to increased oxygen consumption without a concomitant rise in ATP production. the requirement of uncoupling for clearing hepatic steatosis was not directly tested in these studies. niclosamide tested their ability to attenuate hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. this approach identified a number of novel compounds that fail to increase oxygen consumption at concentrations up to 3M. this finding suggests that it may be possible with SAR elucidation to separate the effect on hepatic steatosis from any potential mitochondrial uncoupling activity and related effects on glucose metabolism. number of compounds reported herein have greater cLogP values and significantly improved cLogD values as compared to niclosamide. niclosamide leads to an increase in sperm head abnormalities, clastogenic effects on human lymphocytes, and frame shift mutations in salmonella sp. [47, 48, 57] phenylbenzamides are one of three most influenced genes upregulated in mice. niclosamide reversed CAIII upregulation, suggesting CAIII may be a suitable biomarker for measuring the beneficial effects of therapeutics on hepatic steatosis in vivo. AMPK is a highly-conserved serine threonine kinase that regulates cellular metabolism. niclosamide presents a number of potential challenges to becoming a safe and effective drug for extended therapeutic use. in an effort to identify novel compounds with better preclinical properties that retain in vivo efficacy for the treatment of hepatic steatosis. genotoxicity, and does not stimulate respiration in cells. this suggests this compound may be a good candidate for further clinical development for fatty liver disease."}{"summary": "molluscicide was originally developed and marketed as a molluscicide by Bayer in the late 1950s. it was later found to be an effective anti-helmintic and has been used in the clinic for decades to treat intestinal tapeworm infections in humans. niclosamide has been shown to be relatively safe after a single dose, but it is unclear if chronic treatment with niclosamide would lead to adverse effects. niclosamide has been identified in several screens as a compound with broad anti-cancer activity. this has been attributed to its ability to regulate multiple cellular signaling pathways frequently dysregulated in cancer biology. we also identified niclosamide in a high throughput screen focused on identifying modulators of non-classical peroxisome biogenesis. niclosamide derivatives have divergent activities on ATP homeostasis and the Wnt pathway. niclosamide derivatives that lack uncoupling activity can be made with improved pharmacological properties to treat different indications.

W is fluorescence window value at each time point. the differences between the control (DMSO) and compound treated wells were analyzed using the Student\u2019s t-test. phospho-AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Thr 172; Cell Signaling #2535), total AMPK (Cell Signaling #2603), Fatty acid synthase (FAS); and carbonic Anhydrase 3 (CAR3; Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc-50715) were used at a dilution of 1:2000. 16L of lysate was transferred to white 384 well small volume assay plate. antibody dyes were added per assay protocol. quantitation was performed on a PHERAstar (BMG) MS/MS using a (Shimadzu corporation) LC system coupled to a Shimadzu Triple Quad 5500 mass spectrometer with an ESI interface. the system used a waters XSelect HSS T3 C18, 2.5m, 2.1 x 50 mm column eluted with one of two methods using mobile phases A (water, 0.1% formic acid) and B (acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) 0.2ml of blood was collected pre- and 0.5, 1, 2, 4 8 12 and 24 hours after dosing. blood samples were centrifuged at 2,000 g for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C. negative control chemicals were 2-Aminoanthracene (2-AA) for all S9 activation experiments, 2-nitrofluorene (2-NF) for TA98, Sodium Azide (2-NF) for TA100 and TA1535, Sodium Azide (SA) for TA1535, TA1535 and N-methyl-N\u2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) for WP2 uvrA. mice fed standard chow diet were used as controls and remained untreated. mice were humanely euthanized, the entire liver was excised and liver color was immediately evaluated. steatosis was classified as microvesicular, macrovesicular or mixed. score for hepatic steatosis using the sham animals as controls (steatosis score of 1.0) Statistical analysis was performed using JMP 12 and GraphPad Prism7. data are presented as mean SE. images of unstimulated and stimulated cells were captured on a cellomics/Thermofisher CX5 automated high-content microscope using an Olympus 20X LWD/0.7NA objective. images of unstimulated and stimulated cells were collected and automated image analysis was performed to tabulate the cellular lipid content (green channel) control wells and stimulated cells treated with 1 M niclosamide (F) red lines represent mean and standard error of stimulated and unstimulated cells. we further developed a custom image-processing algorithm and data analysis pipeline based on the open source Cell Profiler software platform. this enabled accurate quantitation of the steatotic phenotype and key cellular features. niclosamide, Metformin and Triacsin C inhibited the steatosis phenotype. niclosamide reduced steatosis by 92 19% and 77 12% respectively. niclosamide imparts poor solubility, limits oral bioavailability. our initial goal was to improve absorption characteristics of experimental compounds by replacing the aromatic nitro group with an electron withdrawing ester or acid moiety. the strong electron withdrawing nitro group has also been associated with increased protonophore activity which is believed to be the underlying mechanism by which niclosamide affects ATP synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation. of the 11 compounds, 7 had greater predicted solubility compared to niclosamide that was -4.76 logS. the predicted solubility of 600657 was best with a value of -0.36 logS followed by 600494 (-2.16 logS), 500200 (-2.21 logS) and 500873 (-2.51 logS) ylbenzamides with in vitro activity for attenuating the hepatic steatosis phenotype were tested using the Mitoexpress Xtra-Oxygen Consumption Assay kit. the phenylbenzamides derivatives produced varied responses in the OCR assay ranging from no change in respiration for 500200, 600657, 600489, 500873, and 600494 to significant changes for 500199, 600655, 60065 changes with * indicate statistically significant (p0.05) OCR values compared to basal OCR values. phospho-AMPK Thr-172 (p-AMPK) levels were evaluated by Western blot in HEK293 cells treated with the phenylbenzamide derivatives. 57 did not appear to stimulate phosphorylation of AMPK or increase oxygen consumption rate. 600489 stimulated phosphorylation of AMPK only at the highest concentration. cell lysate was seeded at 10,000 cells per well 24 hours prior to treatment. 16L of cell lysate was incubated with HTRF phospho-AMPK detection reagents. verapamil performed as expected as assessed by the percentage of the initial concentration of compound remaining after 1 hour with only 7.5% and 4.5% remaining after 60 min in HLM and MLM preparations respectively. 600494 exhibited the greatest metabolic stability with 99.4% and 109.6% of the initial concentration remaining after 60 minutes in HLM and MLM respectively. tested sample 64.2 Negative Control 97.7 Heat-inactivated Control 91.1 Mouse Tested Sample 107.5 Negative Control 106.4 Heat-inactivated Control 105.5 600494 Human Tested Sample 99.4 Negative Control 92.8 Heat-inactivated Control 98.5 We next explored pharmacokinetics profiles in Sprague Dawley rats following oral and IV administration of four of these compounds.

surrogate for kinase activity. 500199, 500200 and 600453 were also analyzed for effects on p-AMPK Thr-172, FAS and CAIII. treatment of HFD fed-DIO mice with 10mg/kg of 500199, 500200 and 600453 for 12 days also stimulated phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr-172, and reduced FAS and CAIII protein levels. the steatosis score was used to evaluate the livers, scoring microvesicular or macrovesicular steatosis and fatty infiltration zonality. sham animals typically had greater than 70% steatosis resulting in a steatosis score of 3.0. niclosamide, 600453 and 500199 reduced the mean percentage of steatosis to 38% and 19% respectively. 20-week old animals were treated IP with 500199 at 10 or 25mg/kg. at day 0, 3, 6 and 9 animals were weighed and tissue samples were collected for standard histological scoring of hepatic steatosis. 500199 improves fatty coat phenotype in high fat diet fed mice. the effect of low and high dose 500199 on hepatic steatosis phenotype on day 6 of treatment. animals treated with 500199 showed a dose dependent improvement in steatotic phenotype. this quantitative analysis can be used along-side comprehensive manual histological scoring to measure changes in the steatotic phenotype. liver X receptors (LXR), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) are required for the transcriptional control of SREBP-1c by insulin. cells were fixed and labeled with HCS LipidTOX green neutral lipid stain. images of unstimulated and stimulated cells were captured on a cell-permeant nuclear counterstain. the unstimulated positive control shown in Fig 1B and 1E represents the basal lipid content for PH5CH8 cells. the insulin and T0901317 stimulated negative control cells accumulated significant lipid droplets. this phenotype was ameliorated by niclosamide as demonstrated by the lipid droplet accumulation in panel F. the score is normalized per-plate to 0\u2013100% effect using the \"unstimulated control\" and \"stimulated + DMSO Vehicle\" as controls. niclosamide, Metformin and niclosamide both inhibited the steatosis phenotype in this platform. phenylbenzamides used this platform to systematically explore the phenylbenzamide chemotype. the nitro group on niclosamide imparts poor solubility, limits oral bioavailability and is a potentially liver-toxic moiety. we hypothesized that by removing the nitro group we may disrupt the mitochondrial uncoupling activity of niclosamide. all newly synthesized compounds were tested using 10-point, 2-fold dilutions ranging between 1M and 1.9nM. of those tested, 52 compounds were designated as active. clogP and cLogD values and IC50 for each derivative are shown. the predicted aqueous solubility* at pH 7.4, cLogP, and cLogD (pH 7.4) were calculated using instant Jchem or MarvinSketch. inhibition of steatotic phenotype was quantified in PH5CH8 liver cells. no change in respiration for 500200, 600657, 600489, 500873, and 600494. phenylbenzamide derivatives showed a dose dependent increase in OCR. 500833 and 500832 were only significantly elevated at 1M. p-AMPK Thr-172 was evaluated in HEK293T cells. 500199 but not its acid form 500200 stimulated phosphorylation of AMPK peaking at 5 M. 600655, 500832, 500833, 600653 and 600453 also stimulated phosphorylation of AMPK. cells were seeded at 10,000 cells per well 24 hours prior to treatment. 16L of cell lysate was incubated with HTRF phospho-AMPK detection reagents. the unstimulated (DMSO) and positive controls lysates are shown in green and red respectively. 89 was found to be completely degraded after 60 min. 3.1% remaining in HLM and 2.7% remaining in MLM. phenylbenzamide derivatives significantly improved oral bioavailability. a single oral dose of 5mg/kg of 600453 formulated in PBS gave a peak plasma concentration of 2050ng/ml. a peak plasma concentration of 1850ng/ml and 5.3-hour half-life correlated to

color compared to the sham HFD-fed animals, which were visibly lighter and tan in color due to ectopic fat accumulation. histological analysis of the lower left lobe from treated mice showed an improvement in macro- and micro- steatosis within 12 days. 500873 (28% steatosis) and 600494 (25% steatosis) also showed reduced steatosis with a score of 1.25. in some cases, livers more closely resembled livers from standard chow fed mouse with 5% steatosis. steatosis stained whole liver sections (A) and body weight in grams (B) of HFD-fed mice with and without 500199 administration at 10 or 25mg/kg by I.P for 9 days. s of treated animals were drier, consistent with reduction in triglycerides. the effect was greater in some animals than others. in general we observed changes in coat appearance with niclosamide, 500199 and 500832 treated animals. mook et. al. recently showed inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation can be separated from uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and alterations in cellular ATP. the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation leads to increased oxygen consumption without a concomitant rise in ATP production. the requirement of uncoupling for clearing hepatic steatosis was not directly tested in these studies. niclosamide tested their ability to attenuate hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo. this approach identified a number of novel compounds that fail to increase oxygen consumption at concentrations up to 3M. this finding suggests that it may be possible with SAR elucidation to separate the effect on hepatic steatosis from any potential mitochondrial uncoupling activity and related effects on glucose metabolism. number of compounds reported herein have greater cLogP values and significantly improved cLogD values as compared to niclosamide. niclosamide leads to an increase in sperm head abnormalities, clastogenic effects on human lymphocytes, and frame shift mutations in salmonella sp. [47, 48, 57] phenylbenzamides are one of three most influenced genes upregulated in mice. niclosamide reversed CAIII upregulation, suggesting CAIII may be a suitable biomarker for measuring the beneficial effects of therapeutics on hepatic steatosis in vivo. AMPK is a highly-conserved serine threonine kinase that regulates cellular metabolism. niclosamide presents a number of potential challenges to becoming a safe and effective drug for extended therapeutic use. in an effort to identify novel compounds with better preclinical properties that retain in vivo efficacy for the treatment of hepatic steatosis. genotoxicity, and does not stimulate respiration in cells. this suggests this compound may be a good candidate for further clinical development for fatty liver disease."}
