{"summary": "a robust public health laboratory system is essential to ensure global health security. the program sought to expand molecular laboratory testing capacity to detect a broad range of respiratory pathogens in clinical respiratory specimens collected during disease surveillance and outbreak investigations. the CDC has developed laboratory capacity for seasonal influenza virus and pandemic influenza preparedness. the NICs often have standardised, state-of-the-art equipment. the NICs often have standardised, state-of-the-art equipment. fluenza respiratory virus products received from IRR Participation date in basic training on respiratory viruses Bangladesh 2 1 94 July 2016 Benin 0 0 0 April 2017 Burkina Faso 1 0 23 July 2016 Cameroon 1 1 37 July 2016 C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire 1 1 28 July 2016 Democratic Republic of Congo 1 0 29 April 2017 Ethiopia 1 0 20 - Gambia 1 0 30 - Ghana 1 1 14 - Guinea-Bissau 0 0 0 April real-time PCR instruments evaluated by CDC to be compatible with this reagent panel include the 7500 Fast DxTM (Applied Biosystems), Mx3000P\u00ae and Mx3005P\u00ae (Agilent, Santa Clara, California, United States), CFX96TM and CFX96TM Touch (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, United States) za 2 (HPIV2) Human parainfluenza 3 (HPIV3) Human parainfluenza 4 (hPIV4) Influenza A, B, C, H1N1 (FLUA, FLUB, FLUC, H1N1) Human coronaviruses 229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1 Human coronavirus (Cor63, Cor229, Cor43, HKU) MERS-CoV assays upE, N2, and N3 CDC provided countries access to a commercially available multiplex assay kit known as FTD33 Respiratory Pathogens\u00ae. the kit comes with its own proprietary primers, probes, PCR buffer, enzyme mix and controls needed to perform the tests. a previous version of the kit, the FTD21 Respiratory Pathogens Kit, was validated against the CDC respiratory virus singleplex assay panel. lab training took place in august 2016. nine countries participated and were trained in the expanded respiratory viral pathogen detection. lab subjects from CDC and the association of public health Laboratories guided participants through the exercises. external quality assessment panels enable laboratories to process and test proficiency samples using the same protocol they use for clinical specimens. results will be reported back to Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics for scoring and the compilation of performance reports. CDC may recommend additional training and technical support, if necessary. introducing new laboratory testing reagents through the IRR is a way of supporting countries that do not normally perform routine surveillance testing beyond influenza virus detection. introducing new laboratory testing reagents through the IRR ensures that laboratories had a single-stop source for vital, quality-assured laboratory reagents. this eliminates the need to get separate quotes for the same products specific to the different laboratories. the IRR is an important tool in the rapid expansion of testing capacities for the GHSA countries. introducing new laboratory testing reagents through the IRR is a way of supporting countries that do not normally perform routine surveillance testing beyond influenza virus detection. this eliminates the need to get separate quotes for the same products specific to all the different laboratories. authors\u2019 contributions B.W. and S.A.B. provided the article framework. K.A.A., E.G., S.S., S.H. and J.W. added clarifications and additional text where appropriate."}
