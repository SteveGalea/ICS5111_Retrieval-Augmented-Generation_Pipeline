{"summary": "protein disordered regions are segments of a protein chain that do not adopt a stable structure [1,2,3,4] in some cases, the disordered region can encompass the entire protein, and any protein with an IDR can be referred to as an intrinsically-disordered protein (IDP) a variety of protein disorder prediction methods have been developed and have been widely used. DNdisorder is a sequence-based approach for predicting disorder developed using ensembles of deep networks. training of the deep network was done using the DISORDER723 dataset. SPINE-D was developed to predict short and long disordered regions of proteins. it was constructed using a three-layer neural network and one-layer filter. silico protein order/disorder prediction was originally trained on high-resolution X-ray crystal structures. it uses PSI-BLAST to search over a filtered sequence database to generate sequence information for each protein target. the extra information increases performance, but at the cost of time needed for the search. WiDNdisorder outpaces their performance in terms of recall for short disorder regions and overall balanced accuracy and AUC. results and Discussion 2.1. Review of Practical Applications of Protein Disorder Prediction 2.1.1. Applications of protein disorder prediction in identifying Biological evolution and other traditional bioinformatics domains. DISOPRED [9] and PreDisorder [11] were adopted to predict protein disordered regions in this study. protein disorder prediction has also been applied to identify some functionally-conserved domains in enzyme and evolutionary domains in protein or DNA binding domains in transcription factors. the application of protein disorder prediction tools promotes drug discovery. a significant change in the structural tendency of a protein region may give rise to the malfunction of such a protein and disease risk. the application of protein disorder prediction tools promotes drug discovery. protein disorder prediction was applied to cluster coronaviruses into three groups. it is classified as in disorder group C, in which coronaviruses have relatively hard inner and outer shells, giving rise to the virus\u2019s highest oral-fecal and respiratory transmission components. method leverages recent advances in machine learning (e.g., deep networks, dropout and maxout) to predict a residue\u2019s state (i.e., order/disorder) solely from the residues included in a very wide window centered on the residue under consideration. method is a stand-alone method and does not use information stemming from multiple sequence alignment or PSSM. isorder makes order/disorder predictions through a two-stage process. in the first stage (i.e., Tier 1), order/disorder predictions are made for each residue from the protein\u2019s primary sequence. in the second stage (Tier 2), the initial prediction is refined using the predicted order. Table 3 shows the results of a comparison of WiDNdisorder versus the unrefined predictions generated from one wide deep network (i.e., Tier 1 predictions) on both evaluation datasets. this indicates the value of the two-stage prediction approach used by WiDNdisorder. a number of disorder predictors were trained for input windows of size 31, 51, 71 and 91. the AUC for each combination of window size and network architecture was calculated for the CASP10 and D01111_TEST dataset. a prediction script was created to calculate the entire time needed to predict the ordered/disordered state of each residue in a protein. the average execution time needed to make ordered/disordered predictions for a protein was 7.86 and 7.19 seconds on the DO1111_TEST and CASP10 datasets. WiDNdisorder lagged behind DISOPRED3 and PrDOS-CNF. it is possible that this performance could be further enhanced by combining it with additional deep networks or other fast approaches to create a particular method. a similar process was used by Jones and Cozzetto in the construction of DISOPREDV3. in this evaluation, ESpritz predictions were made using the \u201cX-ray\u201d model. WiDNdisorder achieved an AUC of 86.3 on the same reduced test set. we hypothesize that the maxout nodes and dropout learning procedure guarded against overfitting or learning the noise in the longer range sequence data that was provided as input. the resulting deep network was then able to make use of the added data for a modest boast in performance. protein disorder prediction can be applied in identifying biological evolution and exploring new functions. a similar study was performed on the impact of alternative splicing and protein structural disorder on mammalian exon evolution. DISOPRED [9] and PreDisorder [11] were adopted to predict protein disordered regions in this study. several protein disorder prediction methods have been applied to aid in new drug target discovery or design. one method, called MFSPSSMpred, was proposed to identify moRFs. DISOPRED [31] can be involved in finding new drug candidates and at a lower cost. protein disorder prediction tools, metaPrDOS, IUPred, disCon and Anchor were applied to predict the disordered regions of the wild-type and mutant proteins. the increase in intrinsic disorder leads to the protein\u2019s loss of function, which is essential in disease risk identification. preDisorder [11] and preDisorder [11] were used to predict protein disordered regions. protein disorder prediction can be applied in identifying biological evolution and exploring new functions. protein disorder prediction has been used in some traditional bioinformatics problems. a work by Pryor and Wiener [21], the FOLDINDEX webserver [22], ESpritz 1.2 [7], DISOPRED2 [9], SPINE-D [6], preDisorder [11], VSL2B [20] and seven other tools were used to detect intrinsic disorder in membrane proteins. a variety of methods have been proposed for disorder-based rational drug design or design. protein disorder prediction has been of a great help in predicting the disease risk of mutations and studying the mechanistic basis of diseases. a significant change in the structural tendency of a protein region may give rise to the malfunction of such a protein. WiDNdisorder: A Fast, Sequence-Based Disorder Predictor WiDNdisorder is a sequence-based ordered/disordered predictor suitable for studies on the genomic scale. the method is a stand-alone method and does not use information stemming from multiple sequence alignment or PSSM. DNdisorder was also included in the evaluation, since it is also based on deep networks. the evaluation metrics used include balanced accuracy, F-measure, Sw and area under the ROC curve.

WiDNdisorder performed quite well on two independent evaluation datasets. WiDNdisorder outpacing its principle competitor ESpritz. WiDNdisorder makes order/disorder predictions through a two-stage process. order/disorder predictions are made for each residue from the protein\u2019s primary sequence. in the second stage, the initial prediction is refined using the predicted order/disorder state of neighboring residues as additional input to the prediction process. predictor length of disordered region 1\u20135 6\u201315 16\u201325 >25 WiDNdisorder 76.2 57.9 67.2 74.3 ESpritz (v1.3) 74.7 63.3 67.4 55.9 DISOPRED (v3) 39.2 43.3 52.2 58.5 DNdisorder 75.4 74.1 76.1 57.9 Table 5. deep network Configuration Input Window Size (in Residues) 31 51 71 91 dropout only 71.0 70.0 73.0 74.9 maxout nodes only 71.3 73.0 74.7 75.8 maxout nodes with dropout 76.7 77.7 78.4 78.8. WiDNdisorder was designed to make quick and robust predictions. it is comprised of 2 DNs and does not use additional evolutionary information. DISOPRED3 and DNdisorder make use of this extra information. this leads to better performance, but prediction times are much longer. proteins with longer IDRs may have trouble forming crystalline structures. this could lead to problems preventing a protein\u2019s structure to be determined experimentally. WiDNdisorder is novel in its application of a wide, fixed width sequence window. the input to feed forward neural networks has generally been limited to the range of 5\u201335 residues. the global topology of the protein does play a role, but encoding more of the protein sequence typically results in poorer performance. the machine learning method has difficulty distinguishing the limited signal present in the added input. the neural network can be applied to predict labels of novel data. a deep neural network is distinct in that it consists of several layers. a two-tiered order/disorder predictor was constructed and used to create WiDNdisorder. a grid search was performed using Jobman. the aim was to maximize the area under the ROC curve. the second stage predictor for WiDNdisorder (i.e., Tier 2) was formed using DO1111_TRAIN and DO1111_VALIDATION. the DisProt dataset contains 694 proteins sequences, each of which is a minimum of 27 residues in length. the residues were not used in training or evaluation in order to avoid introducing noise into training data. D01111_TEST was not used or inspected during the development of WiDNdisorder to ensure fair assessment of WiDNdisorder\u2019s performance. the dataset contained 95 proteins, among which roughly 6%\u20137% of the residues were disordered. features were encoded to represent the protein sequence for areas surrounding the target residue. for each residue in the window, 21 binary values were used to encode the residue type or missing residue. this provided a means to represent each of the 20 standard amino acid types and a missing residue. this provided a means to represent each of the 20 standard amino acid types and a missing residue. the balanced accuracy provides a better sense of a method\u2019s performance on both ordered and disordered residues for a fixed decision threshold. a higher score indicates better performance, and AUC values range from 0.5 for a random classifier to 1.0 for a perfect classifier. a deep neural network can be viewed as a function that maps a numerical characterization of a phenomena to a particular real value that can be used to represent a class. the lowest layer represents the input to the neural network. the lowest layer represents the input to the neural network. a two-tiered order/disorder predictor was constructed and used to create WiDNdisorder. the two-tiered prediction mirrors the work produced by Spencer et al. a model was created for each half of the training set and then used to make predictions for the other half. for Tier 2, the input layer consisted of 2093 features. the final predicted value is then sent through a linear transformation to scale the output. these residues were not used in training or evaluation in order to avoid introducing noise into the training data. the final dataset called DO1111 contained 604 protein sequences from the DISORDER723 dataset and 507 protein sequences from the DisProt dataset. of these protein sequences, the ratio of order to disorder was approximately 2.2:1. distribution of the length of disordered regions in the DO1111_TRAIN dataset. each bin represents a range of five residues, and the last bin represents the number of disordered regions that have a length greater than 100 residues. the protein\u2019s primary sequence had to be characterized numerically to be feed into the deep network. the same encoding process was used as previously described for Tier 1. the 22nd feature for each residue in the window was used to encode if a predicted disorder value was encoded. this resulted in a final input vector 2093 long in size for the Tier 2 prediction. the balance accuracy provides a better sense of a method\u2019s performance on both ordered and disordered residues for a fixed decision threshold. the decision threshold used to calculate recall, BAC, Sw and F-measure was 0.5 with the exception of ESpritz, which used a threshold of 0.064. disorder prediction has become an indispensable tool for many biomedical problems. we developed a new deep learning method to predict protein disorder from one primary sequence only. the method can be a valuable tool for large-scale scanning of big genomics data for identifying disorder proteins relevant to many biomedical problems."}
