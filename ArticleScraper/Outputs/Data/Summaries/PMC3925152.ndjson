{"summary": "coronaviruses are large enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses associated with a wide range of clinical presentations in animals and humans[1]. in september 2012, a novel human coronavirus, named MERS-CoV, was identified in two patients with severe acute respiratory disease in Saudi Arabia [2]. the authors showed that MERS-CoV was 50-100 times more sensitive to IFN- treatment than SARS-CoV. however, there is no clear therapeutic protocol beside supportive treatment in MERS-CoV infection. the outcome of these two patients largely differed. patient 2 had an immunological analysis performed prior to histamine-induced angioedema. qRT-PCR expression analysis Samples were kept at 80\u00b0C. RNA extractions were performed using Qiagen RNeasy mini kit. a DNA melting curve analysis was carried out in order to confirm the presence of a single amplicon. GAPDH was used as an internal reference gene in order to normalize the transcript levels. control samples were obtained from patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced pneumonia requiring BAL in the Infectious Diseases Unit (n = 2). a BAL was performed for diagnosis and used as control for virus-induced pneumonia. the resulting cDNA (equivalent to 25 ng of total RNA) was amplified using the KAPASYBR real-time PCR kit (Kapa Biosystems, United States of America) RT-PCR was performed with the following forward and reverse primers. mRNA levels (2-Ct) were determined by comparing (a) the PCR cycle thresholds (Ct) for the gene of interest and GAPDH (Ct) and (b) Ct values for treated and control groups (Ct). patient 2 had an immunological analysis performed prior to histamine-induced angioedema. qRT-PCR expression analysis Samples were kept at 80\u00b0C. RNA extractions were performed using Qiagen RNeasy mini kit. a DNA melting curve analysis was carried out in order to confirm the presence of a single amplicon. a gene of interest was used as an internal reference gene in order to normalize the transcript levels. a gene of interest was used as an internal reference gene to normalize the transcript levels. clinical symptoms began on April 22; he was transferred to the intensive care unit and intubated on April 30. on may 8, the patient required implementation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and died on may 28 of refractory multiple organ failure. IFN levels were decreased in sera and BAL from patient 1 compared to patient 2. none of these markers were activated in control, HSV and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections. kinetic analysis of IL-12 and IFN levels in the sera after infection shows that patient 2 promoted an early Th1 response mediated by IL-12 and IFN in response to MERS-CoV. adapted response to control MERS-CoV replication requires early IL-12/IFN secretion. two cytokines were associated with a poor outcome during viral infection. both patients initially promoted IL-10 and CXCL10 secretion in response to MERS-CoV. but for patient 2 the response was transient for both IL-10 and CXCL10 during the first week following the onset of the first symptoms. IL-23 secretion was significantly increased in BAL from patient 1 compared to patient 2. Interestingly, IL-23 secretion was increased in the BAL supernatant of patient 2 during HSV replication. several reports have been published providing a more detailed description of the disease. the analysis of the host response is a cornerstone in the design of relevant approaches. previous studies reported the critical role of IFN in the innate immune response against viral infection. previous studies focusing on the outcome of SARS-CoV infected patients showed that an early and robust innate immune response mediated by type-1 IFN led to high level of IFN-stimulated cytokines. IL-10, a cytokine associated with Th-2 adaptive immune response that represses IFN secretion[20], was associated with poor outcome in the early stage of SARS-CoV infection[7]. IRF3 in humans exhibits high polymorphism[22] that may explain the difference between immune responses and outcomes of patients 1 and 2. the sequencing of this key protein in our two patients may contribute to better understand host susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection. IFN secretion leads to decreased CD8 T lymphocytes proliferation and increased viral replication."}
