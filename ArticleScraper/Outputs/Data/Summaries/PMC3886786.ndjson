{"summary": "the first case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection was reported in September 2012 from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. since then, 81 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with 45 deaths were reported by eight countries, of which 66 (81.5%) were from the KSA 2. there have been no cases reported in Asia. the virus has the ability to cause profound apoptosis of human bronchial epithelial cells 10. all confirmed cases have had respiratory disease and most have developed pneumonia 11. rapid transmission and high attack rate in hospital settings have raised concerns about the risk of health care associated transmission of this virus 12. estimates of total migrant workers by the International Labor Organization for 2010 were 105.5 million, 30 million from within Asia 19. remittance from workers in selected Asian countries alone contributed 58.9% of total foreign exchange earned in 2011 21. the WHO has not yet issued a travel health warning for any country, nor recommended conducting on-arrival screenings at ports of entry. the infectious nature of MERS-CoV means that there is a risk of contracting the disease through infected individuals who have visited the Middle East in the preceding 10 to 14 days. region Inbound migration refers to the flow of persons traveling into a country 23. KSA, Qatar, Kuwait, UAE and Jordan are the major destination (labor receiving) countries. the numbers of both residency visa holders and tourists visiting Sri Lanka from the Middle East, disaggregated by country of residence, are shown in Table 3. both KSA and the UAE remain the primary source countries of migrants within this inbound category. both KSA and the UAE remain the primary source countries of migrants within this inbound category. an estimated 280,901 people will travel from the Middle East to Sri Lanka. this number does not account for the number of returning Sri Lankan tourists and irregular migrants from the Middle Eastern region. 'at destination' (time spent in the Gulf States) and 'upon-arrival' (arrival back in Sri Lanka) each stage in the migration cycle offers unique opportunities for public health action/intervention based on enabling mechanisms and capacities harnessed in routine migrant worker pathways. the importance of health accessibility for migrant workers to primary and specialized health care facilities in the Gulf States also needs to be emphasized through state-to-state and regional advocacy mechanisms. it is recommended that public health authorities and global bodies such as the WHO and the International Organization for Migration utilize the support of existing inter-regional and trans-national migrant worker networks. Immigration Counter Referral for those migrant workers returning from Arabian peninsula and neighboring Middle East countries may also be directed from the SLFBE migrant worker arrival desk. Managing risk communication also forms a vital strategy for any form of public health preparedness and response. global health authorities recommend partnerships between public health authorities, at national and regional levels, with the labor migration industry and migrant worker networks in establishing both institutional and policy mechanisms."}
