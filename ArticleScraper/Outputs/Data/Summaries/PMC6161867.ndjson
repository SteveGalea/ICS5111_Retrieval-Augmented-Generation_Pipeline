{"summary": "the camel (Camelus dromedarius) is a unique species and can be a better provider of meat and milk in desert areas than other farm animals. the total population of dromedary is estimated to be about 25 million heads all over the world. a basic understanding of bone and cartilage repair is essential to save the lives of thousands of camels used for this agribusiness. camel milk fat contains fewer short-chained fatty acids, but the same long-chained fatty acids can be found. some researchers claim that the value of camel milk is found in the high concentrations of volatile acids especially linoleic and polyunsaturated fatty acids. nanobodies have the unique ability to bind molecular clefts, such as the active site of enzymes, thereby interfering with the function of the target protein [22]. nanobodies are also considered as a significant tool in various therapeutic disciplines due to their very small size. iPSCs can be generated from differentiated cells by retrovirus-mediated transfection of four transcription factors, namely Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 [31] iPSCs show a great deal of potential for stem cell therapies and clinical applications particularly for elite animals [32] iPSCs could be used for regenerative medicine in precious genetically superior camels used for racing and beauty shows. we have isolated ESCs and trophectoderm stem cells from camel embryos on feeder-free conditions. a differential expression of certain genes such as Klf4 showed significant increase in trophoblasts when compared with the ESCs. this raises the question as to whether Klf4 or other transcripts are essential for pluripotency in camels. the best source for isolating the coding DNA sequence (CDS) of these genes is the blastocyst stage of in vivo or in vitro produced embryos. another team has isolated the mesenchymal stem cells from camel adipose tissue and showed its differentiation capabilities into adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic cells. studies have helped to substantiate the potential applications of somatic cell nuclear transfer (cloning) to overcome several problems in various biology fields. this technique can be used to propagate camels with the highest potential for milk production, beauty contests or racing champions. iPSCs will be used for the genome conservation of elite genetically valuable animals. the functions of individual pluripotency gene over-expression on early embryonic development in camels. in vitro disease modeling could yield new insights into disease mechanisms."}
