{"summary": "testing for E. coli is part of the routine epidemiological examination for diagnosis of calf diseases, alongside testing for rota- and coronavirus, Cryptosporidium spp., and Salmonella spp. despite diarrhea in calves remains a major cause of annual financial losses for farmers. the main characteristics of E. coli isolated from diarrheic calves were higher counts of bacteria from different parts of the intestine and isolation of bacteria from internal organs. these changes were proposed to stem from toxins released by bacteria that eventually altered the intestinal physiology. however, he disputed the role of E. coli as a causative agent of the disease in colostrum-fed calves. E. coli is a common part of the intestinal microbiota of most mammals and birds. only a small fraction of the population belongs to pathovars. pathotyping is based on the occurrence of VAF and virulence mechanisms (intestinal pathogenic E. coli) nt E. coli (DAEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC; including Shigella) are less known in cattle. toxins involved in farm animal infection are F4, F5, F6, F17 and F41 fimbriae. DAEC are defined by their diffuse adherence (DA) pattern on HEp-2 or HeLa cells. DAEC express fimbriae like Dr and F1845 and/or afimbrial adhes. the bacteriophage carried enterohemolysin (e-hlyA) is often associated with the STEC pathotype. the role of the bacteriophage carried enterohemolysin (e-hlyA) is so far not known. several O groups are more prevalent in single pathotypes. other tools for the characterization of isolates are genotyping methods. systematic reviews and even meta-analyses of previous studies are still rare endeavors. Selected publications had to be available for downloading and had to contain extractable data in English about the presence of VAF in E. coli isolated from calves. compiled data contains: year(s) and country of sampling, number of animals sampled, presence of diarrhea, number of isolates analyzed. d by the linear model y = a * x fitted to data from all publications with clearly indicated collection periods. isolation year was treated as the response variable and publication year was used as the explanatory variable. literature search and eligibility criteria The PubMed database was searched for studies published from 1st of January 1951 to 31st of December 2013 with phrases: \"E. coli calves virulence genes,\" \"E. coli calf\" and \"E. coli calf virulence genes\" data was stored in relational database created specifically for this study. isolates originally annotated as eae, eaeA, and/or intimin were re-coded as eaeA-positive. another reason for unification was the diversity in analyzed genes. data processing and statistical analysis The prevalence of VAFs or E. coli pathotypes was compared between healthy and diarrheic animals using the chi-square test of independence with Yates's continuity correction. the same statistical test was used to determine relationships between the prevalence of a VAF and the year of isolation of E. coli. PCR was used most often for VAF detection in E. coli. more than a half of papers contained information about serotypes. 3 0 117 0.0000 0.9756 cdt 6 78 1271 0.0614 2 7 77 0.0909 0.6468 cif 1 15 255 0.0588 1 0 21 0.0000 0.7666 CNF 10 135 1880 0.0718 6 55 1356 0.0406 9.089e-04 CS31 7 183 646 0.2833 2 1 145 0.0069 1.404e-11 eaeA 33 1203 9779 0.1230 29 8 0 56 0.0000 NA ipa 3 0 107 0.0000 1 0 56 0.0000 NA kpsMII 2 4 103 0.0388 1 1 56 0.0179 0.9756 ldaE 1 7 16 0.4375 1 0 23 0.0000 0.0069 LT 5 3 1141 0.0026 1 0 56 0.0000 1 LTI 7 0 409 0.0000 3 0 806 0.0000 NA aap 1 0 the presence of ETEC VAFs was investigated in 9597 isolates from 27 countries in 51 publications. ST and LT were present in 4.3% (254/5849 isolates) and 0.3% (7/2672) isolates. STI (4.9%) was isolated more often than STI (3.2%). F5, F17, and F41 fimbriae were isolated 5.7, 1.2, and 23.7 times more frequently from diarrheic calves than from healthy ones. the prevalence of ST-positive isolates increased over time in diseased and healthy animals. the average prevalence of STECs isolated from healthy animals was 19.4% and from diseased animals 18.2%. only 51 publications including 5676 isolates determined co-occurrence of toxins. the dashed vertical lines represent the mean prevalence of the given pathotype of all studies. labels contain information about the first author of the study, the year of publication, the health status of animals (H, healthy; D, diarrheic; M, mixed; U, unknown) and the year of isolation. the presence of the cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF) was investigated in 2125 isolates from nine countries in 14 publications. the presence of the cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF) was investigated in 2125 isolates from nine countries in 14 publications. only the most prevalent and pathotype-associated VAFs were chosen for further analysis and discussion. in summary 16 VAFs were associated with animals' health status with p-value lower than 0.05 (lowest p in these group 1052) identification of five VAFs was associated with healthy calves, while 11 of them with diseased. 23 0.0000 NA ent 1 0 61 0.0000 1 0 56 0.0000 NA escV 1 14 61 0.2295 1 16 56 0.2857 0.9005 F17 15 735 2328 0.3157 4 231 854 0.2705 0.0437 F1845 1 0 14 0.0000 1 3 122 0.0246 1 F41 15 293 2030 0.1443 6 6 991 0.0061 2.521e-31 F5 36 719 5566 0.1292 12 0 NA saa 4 119 248 0.4798 3 60 863 0.0695 9.715e-52 sfa 4 37 998 0.0371 1 3 56 0.0536 0.9756 STI 17 172 2178 0.0790 8 7 1261 0.0056 1.531e-19 STII 7 50 1043 0.0479 3 0 806 0.0000 3.924e-09 stx 4 27 94 0.2872 2 20 130 0.1538 0.0584 the prevalence of various ETEC adhesins is shown in Table 2. F5, F17, and F41 fimbriae were the most frequently studied. they were isolated from 9.5, 30.4, and 11.1% animals. p 0.0005 prevalence decreased over time in diseased and healthy animals. prevalence did not change for the other VAFs within this time. each subpanel corresponds to one VAF. the average prevalence of STECs isolated from healthy animals was 19.4%. only 51 publications including 5676 isolates determined co-occurrence of toxins. 344 isolates were Stx1-positive (6.1%), 405 isolates were Stx2+ (7.1%) and in 259 isolates both Shiga toxin genes were present (4.6%). the prevalence of EHEC independent of health status was 8.7% (1197 isolates were EHEC) with 6% in diarrheic and 10.7% in healthy calves. the presence of DAEC VAFs was investigated in 1568 isolates from 10 countries. in vitro cell-based or ex vivo assays are the primary choice for this purpose. the most often used was the Vero cytotoxicity assay, which is found in 27 manuscripts. a significant drop in F5 prevalence over the past years was observed. the role of ST toxin in the pathogenesis of calf diarrhea seems to be doubtful. the authors of this manuscript should raise an important question at this moment. if the highest prevalence of VAF from E. coli isolated from diarrhea is between 5 and 15%, what is happening with the rest of isolates\" high prevalence of STEC, EPEC, and EHEC in healthy and diarrheic animals shows that these animals can be considered as reservoirs for human pathogenic E. coli. lack of Stx receptor in vascular endothelium makes cattle a perfect candidate as a reservoir of STEC/EHEC as it is not possible for them to develop systemic disease. DAEC and EAEC are well-known as a diarrhea causing agent in humans. but there is scant information about their prevalence in cattle and calves. analysis of methods used in studies appraised in this work is worth a small separate discussion. our systematic review and meta-analysis provides useful information about the history of scientific investigations performed so far. our data suggest new trends for future work concerning E. coli in calves as an etiological agent of disease or in carrier state."}
