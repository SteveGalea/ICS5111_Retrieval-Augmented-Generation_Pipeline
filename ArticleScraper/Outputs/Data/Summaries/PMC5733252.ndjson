{"summary": "the study was conducted to detect canine parvovirus antigen in dogs presented with diarrhoea to the government Veterinary Clinic in Kumasi, Ghana. a total of 65.67% of samples from puppies below 6 months were positive. the study is the first documented evidence of the existence of CPV in Ghana. canine Parvovirus (CPV) is considered by many researchers as the leading cause of diarrhoea in dogs under 6 months old. other clinical signs associated with CPV include acute vomiting, anorexia, haemorrhagic diarrhoea, dehydration and depression. the government Veterinary Clinic in Kumasi, Ghana is one of such clinics where there have been several cases of morbidity and mortality in dogs due to suspected CPV. this study was done to provide documented evidence of the existence of CPV in dogs in both CPV-vaccinated and unvaccinated dogs. most of the dogs presented for treatment at this clinic live within the Kumasi Metropolis. CPV was detected in 72 dogs presented to the government Veterinary Clinic, Kumasi with history and/or clinical signs of diarrhoea and anorexia with or without vomiting. no local breed was presented to the clinic with symptoms described for CPV during the study period. Figure 1. Distribution of the total number of dogs tested according to breed representation. the dogs tested were divided into two age groups: 6 months old and >6months old. s recorded a higher percentage of positive cases (61.54%; 24/39) than females (60.61%; 20/33) no positives were recorded in dogs older than 6 months (0/5) studies from. Nigeria recorded 1 out of 17 (5.56%) of the local breeds positive for CPV as compared to 11 out of 41 (1.15%) of the exotic breeds. studies from. Nigeria recorded the highest cases of CPV in local breeds of dogs and mongrels. a higher percentage of positive cases in unvaccinated dogs than in vaccinated dogs. this corresponds with the findings of Singh et al. (2013) who had a prevalence of 64% in unvaccinated dogs and 50% vaccinated dogs. there was no dependence of vaccination status on the susceptibility to CPV infection in this study. dogs presented with haemorrhagic diarrhoea had a higher prevalence of 69.05% compared to 50.0% dogs without haemorrhagic diarrhoea. this particular finding is very important to note, particularly in Ghana where most clinicians rely on the presence of profuse foul-smelling watery bloody diarrhoea."}
