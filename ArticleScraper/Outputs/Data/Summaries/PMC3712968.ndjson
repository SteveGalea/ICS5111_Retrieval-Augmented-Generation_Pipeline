{"summary": "infections account for substantial morbidity and mortality and fever is often the only indication of infection in this patient group. bacteraemia is identified in 23%\u201333% [3], [4], [5], [6], [7] of all patients. a third of febrile episodes unexplained despite extensive microbiological investigations. pro-inflammatory response towards endotoxins, sCD14, a receptor for LPS, could be a suitable immediate early response biomarker for fevers associated with microbial translocation. adult patients with haematological disorders were included in a cross sectional study. plasma was diluted 110 with 10 mM MgCl2 solution and heat inactivated at 80\u00b0C for 12 minutes. plasma was then cooled at room temperature for 15 minutes. 50 l of the sample was added to empty wells of an endotoxin free flat bottomed 96-well plate (Lonza) the color change was measured at 540 nm within 15 minutes. the final absorbance reading was subtracted from the background reading. the absolute count of lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD56+NK cells, and monocytes was determined. correlations were calculated by using Spearman\u2019s rank test. the inclusion criterion was chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. patients that developed fever were sampled within 72 hours. plasma was diluted 110 with 10 mM MgCl2 solution and heat inactivated at 80\u00b0C for 12 minutes. plasma was then cooled at room temperature for 15 minutes and 50 l of the sample was added to empty wells of an endotoxin free flat bottomed 96-well plate (Lonza) dissolved in water was added to each well, followed by 50 l of N-(1-naphthyl) ethylene-diamine dihydrochloride, 0.525 mg/mL, producing a brilliant magenta-colored derivative. the color change was measured at 540 nm within 15 minutes. results A total of 103 febrile neutropaenic episodes and 42 afebrile neutropaenic episodes were included in the study (Table 1). the majority of patients were treated for acute leukaemias and none were diagnosed with invasive fungal infections. microbiological findings were assumed to be the primary cause of fever. a neutrophile counts were obtained from medical records. cell counts for lymphocytes and monocytes were performed in 59 episodes where the material was available. aenic episodes with bacteria (n = 37), virus (n = 28) and FUO (n = 38) (B) were correlated with higher (p = 0.0212) endotoxin levels at a median of 110.9 pg/mL (IQR = 93.2 pg/mL\u2013139.1 pg/mL) compared to a median of 101.4 pg/mL (IQR = 90.4 pg/mL\u201311 sCD14 concentration in FUO episodes were similar to those with Gram-negative bacteraemia. no correlation was observed between viral findings and sCD14 concentrations. sCD14 concentrations measured in febrile neutropaenic episodes. Febrile patients had similar plasma endotoxin concentrations as the afebrile patients. further stratification of the febrile episodes based on microbiological findings revealed significantly (p = 0.0077) elevated endotoxin concentrations in FUO episodes. episodes with documented bacterial (104.7 pg/mL [IQR = 87.1 pg/mL\u2013112.3 pg/mL]) findings were similar. sCD14 A positive association was observed between sCD14 concentrations and manifestation of febrile status (p = 0.0066) with sCD14 concentrations higher in febrile episodes (3.03106 pg/mL [IQR = 2.17106 pg/mL \u20133.89106 pg/mL]) compared with afebrile episodes (2.51106 pg/mL [IQR = 1.86106 pg/mL\u20133.08 no correlation was observed between viral findings and sCD14 concentrations. association between sCD14 concentration and underlying disease was not observed. sCD14 concentrations measured in febrile neutropaenic episodes. pression in patients [12] and small sample sizes limited their work to only systemic concentrations of endotoxins [13], [14] or positive faecal bacterial cultures as indicators of microbial translocation. the patients were less immunosuppressed compared to the current study, leading to difficulties for adequate comparison. sCD14 concentrations in episodes with Gram negative bacteria were not higher than those with Gram positive bacteria. sCD14 concentrations in episodes with bacterial findings were similar to levels found in plasma of HIV-1 infected patients where microbial translocation had been documented. despite higher endotoxin concentrations in the FUO group, there is no corresponding increase in sCD14 response observed. monocytes and to a lesser extent, neutrophils have been suggested to be the main sources of sCD14, either by shedding of mCD14 or secreted directly. correlation of findings with enterocyte function and integrity could provide more insight into possible mechanisms of translocation. microbial translocation could contribute to febrile episodes in an adult neutropaenic cohort. an association between prophylactic antibiotic use and increased plasma endotoxin concentrations was observed."}
