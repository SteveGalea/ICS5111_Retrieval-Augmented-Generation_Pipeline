{"summary": "nine cellular proteins were found to bind preferentially to the 3\u2032 end of the TGEV genome. the role of the poly(A) tail in the binding of these proteins with the 3\u2032 end of the genome was studied. the specific RNA domain interacting with these cellular proteins was further analyzed. proteins (600 g) from cytoplasmic extracts of TGEV-infected Huh-7 cells were pulled down without RNA () or with TGEV genome ends 5\u2032 (5\u2032) and 3\u2032 without (3\u2032) and with (3\u2032 A) poly(A) tail, separated in SDS-PAGE gels. last 493 nt of the TGEV genome were divided into six overlapping RNA fragments (F1 to F6) that were used as baits in pulldown fragment F6, covering nt 28469 to 28580, contained the hypervariable region (HVR) and the highly conserved octanucleotide (OCT), originally described for MHV (27). biotin-labeled RNA fragments, generated by in vitro transcription, were used as baits in pulldown assays, together with the full-length 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genome as specificity controls. proteins (600 g) from cytoplasmic extracts of TGEV-infected Huh-7 cells were pulled down with the six overlapping fragments (1 to 6) covering the last 493 nt of the TGEV genome or with TGEV genome ends 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 without poly(A) or without RNA () as specificity controls. the pulled down proteins were separated in SDS-PAGE gels together with 50 g of the initial protein extract (I) F2 was divided into three fragments (F2.1, F2.2, and F2.3) that were used as bait in pulldown assays. the presence of EPRS and RRS in the initial extract (I) and in the pulled-down fractions was analyzed by Western blotting. the GAIT element are outlined in green, are shown. numbers above the sequence alignment indicate the genome position of fragment F2.2L. a stem-loop with an internal asymmetric bulge was also predicted for the viral RNA domain. the interaction of EPRS and RRS with viral RNAs in the context of TGEV infection was analyzed by RNA immunoprecipitation assays. cytoplasmic extracts of TGEV-infected ST cells were immunoprecipitated with EPRS- and RRS-specific antibodies. the presence of the viral genome and sgmRNAs in the immunoprecipitated RNA-protein complexes was analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT- in vitro analysis of the interaction of EPRS and RRS with the viral GAIT-like RNA motif. the pulldown assays did not discriminate whether the interaction of EPRS and RRS with the viral GAIT-like RNA motif was direct or mediated by other cellular or viral proteins. the RNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel. the biotinylated riboprobe was detected using the BrightStar bioDetect kit (Ambion) three chimeric mRNAs expressing the luciferase protein were in vitro transcribed. three chimeric luciferase reporter mRNA constructs were subjected to in vitro translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. the translation of these chimeric constructs was quantitated by chemiluminescence and expressed as the percentage of translation of each construct in the presence of the GAIT complex. a recombinant TGEV harboring mutations in the GAIT-like RNA motif was engineered by reverse genetics using a the rTGEV-mutG virus contained the nucleotide substitutions A to G (genomic position 28178), U to C (genomic position 28181) and C to U (genomic position 28190), which were predicted to partially disrupt the stem structure and the internal asymmetric bulge. the mutations introduced were silent and maintained the amino acid sequence of protein 7. mutated viral GAIT-like RNA motif was not able to pull down both aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, indicating that EPRS and RRS did not bind to the mutated viral GAIT-like RNA motif. mutated viral GAIT-like RNA motif was not able to pull down both aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, indicating that EPRS and RRS did not bind to the mutated viral GAIT-like RNA proteins from cytoplasmic extracts of TGEV-infected Huh-7 cells were pulled down with either the native (F2.2L-WT) or the mutated (F2.2L-mutG) TGEV GAIT-like RNA motif. the presence of EPRS and RRS in the initial extract (I) and in the pulled-down fractions was further analyzed by Western blotting. all the analyzed genes increased their expression during the virus infection. the levels of viral genomic RNA, sgmRNA 7 and TGF- mRNA were also evaluated as a control. no significant differences were detected in the levels of viral genomic RNA, sgmRNA 7 and TGF- mRNA in cells infected with either the WT or mutant viruses. in cells infected with rTGEV-mutG compared with cells infected with rTGEV-mutG. a significant increase in the IFN- and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) production was also analyzed. the viral GAIT-like RNA motif interfered with the host immune response. two siRNA transfection steps were needed to achieve a sustained silencing at the mRNA and protein levels of about 43% and 35% for RIG-I and MDA5 respectively. despite the modest reduction of MDA5 expression, it was previously described that a similar reduction is enough to observe an effect on cytokine production. in nonsilenced cells, infection by the rTGEV-mutG virus led to increased TNF and IFN- mRNA levels compared with those total RNA and proteins were extracted at 12 and 18 hpi (36 and 42 h) after second transfection. silencing was evaluated at 36 (blue) and 42 (red) h after second transfection. silencing was expressed as percentage of RIG-I and MDA5 mRNA remaining. gRNA are expressed as percentages in comparison to gRNA levels in nonsilenced and noninfected cells. the figure shows the effects observed at 18 hpi (42 h after the second siRNA transfection), when they were more evident. in all cases, GUSB mRNA levels were used as the endogenous control. at 8 hpi, total RNA was extracted, and levels of viral genomic RNA (gRNA) were quantified by RT-qPCR in noninfected cells, untreated or treated with IFN-. GUSB mRNA levels were used as an endogenous control in all cases. PCRs were performed with the oligonucleotides XmaI-T7-VS and TGEV-3\u2032-pA-RS to amplify the 3\u2032 end without poly(A) tail. the PCRs were performed with the oligonucleotides XmaI-T7-VS and F1-RS for fragment F1, F2-VS and F3-RS for fragment F2, F3-VS and F4-RS for fragment F4, all PCRs were performed with the platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) the resulting amplicons were purified with the Qiagen gel extraction kit. the resulting amplicons were purified with the Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen) TAGCATTGC F5-VS CGCGCGCGCGCGGGTAATACGACTCACTATA(G)GGTTGTACCTCCTATTAC F6-VS CGCGCGCGCGCGCGCTACGA a VS, virus sense; RS, reverse sense. transcripts were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C and treated with 10 U of DNase I for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. at 16 hpi, cytoplasmic cell extracts were prepared as described previously. total protein concentration was determined with the BCA protein assay kit. biotinylated RNA (between 5 and 10 g) was diluted in 200 l of RNA-binding buffer. in nuPAGE 4 to 12% bis-Tris gels with morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS) SDS running buffer (Invitrogen) Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% dried skimmed milk in TBS (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl) and then probed with specific antibodies diluted in TBS and 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS) containing 3% oxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in TTBS-3% dried skimmed milk for 1 h at room temperature. RNA-protein binding reactions were performed by incubating 100 pmol of the 3\u2032 biotinylated TGEV GAIT-like RNA motif. the gel was blotted onto positively charged nylon membranes. cytoplasmic supernatant, corresponding to 1 107 cells, was immunoprecipitated with anti-EPRS, anti-RRS, or anti-GFP (Roche) antibodies. the purified RNA was subjected to RT-qPCR for the detection of viral genomic RNA and sgmRNAs.
