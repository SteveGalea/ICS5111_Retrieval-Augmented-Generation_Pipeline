{"summary": "the recent outbreaks of these viruses originated from zoonoses and have significantly impacted global economies and public health. the surveillance of rodents in urban areas is critical for the identification and prevention of zoonotic viral outbreaks affecting human health. the incidence of HFRS was shown to be associated with environmental factors, e.g., temperatures, rainfall, and changes in vegetation. higher temperatures that resulted in increased vole populations correlated with an outbreak of Puumala virus (PUUV) infection in Scandinavia and Belgium. rodent trapping was conducted from 2006 to 2010 at buildings on USAG, Yongsan, Seoul, ROK. rodent infestations were reported to the Pest Control Section, Department of Public Works, Korea Regional Office, Installation Management Agency. rodent trapping was conducted from 2006 to 2010 at buildings on USAG, Yongsan, Seoul, ROK. live rodents were euthanized by cardiac puncture under isoflurane anesthesia in accordance with the approved KU-IACUC protocol. they were then identified to species by morphological criteria and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene. total RNA was isolated from lung tissues of seropositive R. norvegicus using the RNA-BeeTM isolation kit (Tel-Test, Inc., Gaineville, FL) polymerase chain reaction was performed in 50-L reactions containing 10 mM dNTP, 0.5U of Super-Therm Taq polymerase (JMR Holdings, London, United Kingdom) merase chain reaction products were then purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA) cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers or OSM55 (5\u2032-TAG TAG ACT CC-3\u2032) using a high-capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit. cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers or OSM55 (5\u2032-TAG TAG ACT CC support for the topologies was evaluated by bootstrapping for 1,000 iterations. support for the topologies was evaluated by bootstrapping for 1,000 iterations. animal trapping was approved by the U.S. Forces Korea. the live rodents were euthanized by cardiac puncture under isoflurane anesthesia. they were then identified to species by morphological criteria and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using universal primers. the slides were mounted with glycine-buffered glycerol under cover slips. total RNA was isolated from lung tissues of seropositive R. norvegicus. polymerase chain reaction was performed in 50-L reactions. primer sequences of SEOV S segment were OSV844 (5\u2032-CCG ATG TCC ACC AAC AAC ATG-3\u2032), OSV846 (5\u2032-ATC TAT RTT GCA GGG ATG GC cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers or OSM55 (5\u2032-TAG TAG ACT CC-3\u2032) using a high-capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit. cDNA was synthesized using random hexamers or OSM55 (5\u2032-TAG TAG ACT CC-3\u2032) using a high-capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit. a total of 1,950 rodents were captured in/near 234 of the buildings surveyed at USAG, Seoul, ROK from 2006 to 2010. annual infestation rates were classified as high (> 15 rodents per year), moderate (> 8\u201315 rodents per year), low (1\u20138 rodents per year), and very low ( 1 rodent per year). about 59.8% (140/234) of the buildings were considered very low risk for rodent infestations where the TI was 0.4. the total number of captured rodents per month was the highest with 78 R. norvegicus during November 2006. a total of 1,939 (99.4%) R. norvegicus and 11 (0.6%) Mus musculus were captured. the serological prevalence of R. norvegicus was 4.8% (34/707) for anti-SEOV IgG. R. norvegicus formed a monophyletic group with SEOV strains 80-39 and Tchoupitoulas. the nucleotide identity of SEOV strains varied ranging from 94.3% to 100%, respectively, compared with SEOV 80-39. branch lengths are proportional to the number of nucleotide substitutions. the numbers at each node are bootstrap probabilities (expressed as percentages) taan virus (HTNV 76-118, M: NC_005219, S: NC_005218), soochong virus (SOOV SOO-1, M: AY675353, S: AY675349), Muju virus (MUJV 11-1, M: JX028272), Puumala virus (PUUV Sotkamo, M: NC_005223, S: NC_005224), Tula virus (TULV M5302 the genomic sequences of SEOV L, M, and S segments from SEOV Rn10-134 and Rn10-145 showed 98.1\u201398.2%, 98.0%, and 98.4% similarities. the amino acid sequence identity for RdRp, Gn and Gc, and N proteins was 99.4%, 99.4%, and 99.8% with respect to SEOV 80-39. the evolutionary rate of whole-genome sequences of SEOV L, M, and S segments, annual infestation rates were classified as high (> 15 rodents per year), moderate (> 8\u201315 rodents per year), low (1\u20138 rodents per year), and very low ( 1 rodent per year) the TI was the highest for 0.9% (2/234) facilities, e.g., Dragon Hill Lodge complex and the Hartell House (18.8 rodents per year) TI* Building name High 2 4050 190 38.0 Dragon Hill Lodge complex 3724 94 18.8 Hartell House Moderate 8 2667 61 12.2 KATUSA snack bar 1435 55 11.0 PX (AAFES) 4314 53 10.6 Seoul CPAC 2524 52 10.4 Shappette 5211 48 9.6 KATUSA snack bar 1657 42 8.4 Navy club 2254 42 8.4 Finance HQ near bus terminal 4610 42 8.4 Family housing Low 84 NA 1,018 2.4 a total of 1,939 (99.4%) R. norvegicus and 11 (0.6%) Mus musculus were captured, respectively. the serological prevalence of R. norvegicus was 4.8% (34/707) for anti-SEOV IgG. iological survey for SEOV in Rattus norvegicus and Mus musculus collected at the U.S. Army Garrison, Yongsan, Seoul, Republic of Korea, 2006\u20132010 Species Year Total no. collected No. (%) tested IFAT for SEOV (%)* RT-PCR for Seoul virus (%) R. norvegicus 2006 447 160 (35.8) 12 (7.5) 1 (0.6) 2007 403 140 (34.7) 9 (6.4) SEOV 80-39, M: NC_005237, S: NC_005236; SEOV Tchoupitoulas/POR, M: KU204959; SEOV B1, M: AB457794; SEOV Sapporo rat virus, M: M34882; SEOV 5CSG, M: AB618130; SEOV LYO852, M: KF387724; SEOV L99, M: AF035833; whole-genome sequences of SEOV tripartite RNA were determined from two of three SEOV strains. SEOV Rn10-134 and Rn10-145 consistently formed a phylogenetic lineage with SEOV strains 80-39 and Tchoupitoulas. the genomic sequences of SEOV L, M, and S segments from SEOV Rn10-134 and Rn10-145 showed 98.1\u201398.2%, 98.0%, and 98. the evolutionary rate of whole-genome sequences of SEOV L, M, and S segments, recovered in 2010, was 5.3-5.4E10-04, 6.7E-04, and 5.8E-0.4 (substitution/nucleotide/year) for 30 years since SEOV was first identified in 1980. the number of R. norvegicus captured at USAG Yongsan, Seoul, was the highest in November 2006. higher rainfall during the dry monsoon season might cause increased densities of the rats and higher numbers of the rats captured. SEOV Rn10-134 and Rn10-145 were completely sequenced, characterized, and compared with the prototype SEOV 80-39. the termini of SEOV L, M, and S segments showed incomplete complementarity similar to other hantaviruses. an increased knowledge for the prevalence of SEOV in rodent populations in urban environments provides the need for comprehensive rodent-borne hantavirus surveillance and control programs to prevent a critical public health threat. the need for early diagnosis and interventions that significantly reduce morbidity and mortality due to urban hantavirus infections."}
