{"summary": "camels (Camelus dromedarius Linnaeus, 1758) are exceptional livestock animals because of their natural adaptation to hot sandy desert environments. despite the variation in physiological, biochemical, morphological, and behavioral traits, the camel has received little attention with regard to the documentation of these traits. applying a candidate gene approach to camels requires the presence of the phenotype in other mammals and a manageable number of candidate genes to be sequenced. these approaches provide an opportunity to study camel-specific characteristics and for many cases, narrow down the number of candidate genes to investigate. however, several challenges hinder the implementation of these approaches in camels. camel phenotypes require a large number of carefully phenotyped individuals of known ancestry. this necessity justifies the assembly of a camel DNA biobank. the biobank consists of biological specimens (DNA source) accompanied by detailed specimen-associated information. the archive is comprised of 163 samples collected during 2015 (February\u2013April), 2016 (October\u2013December), and 2017 (March\u2013April) the current Cdrom Archive specimen\u2019s information is listed in Supplementary Table S4, both photographs and biological material associated with each specimen is available upon request. it is therefore necessary to use age categories such as juvenile, subadult, and adult instead of years. each age class represents a phase in the growth of a female camel. outer numbers are approximate number of years for the completion of each age stage. the quantity of DNA, obtained from hair follicles, is thus expected to be successfully used in each of PCR, STR and SNP genotyping, targeted sequencing, and whole-genome sequencing. a small bundle of long tail-hairs near the base of the tail can be wrapped around the index finger and plucked upward. nine samples were collected from King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia. circle size corresponds to the number of camel samples from each breeder (location) the majority of the sampled camels in the Cdrom Archive have been photographed multiple times. camel breeds are generally defined based on characteristics agreed upon by breeders. the closest to a camel breed registry or a governing body is the Camel Race Federation in the united arab Emirates (Khalaf, 1999). data collection and organization Sample-specific information of the Cdrom Archive is collected and organized in a unified format using the SamplEase application. the archive is currently comprised of 163 samples that were collected during 2015 (February\u2013April), 2016 (October\u2013December), and 2017 (March\u2013April) most camel breeders in the Arabian Peninsula do not keep track of the specific age of each camel. they label their age class generally based on their behavior, reproductive maturity, and teeth development. it is therefore necessary to use age categories such as juvenile, subadult, and adult instead of years. the biological specimens of the Cdrom Archive presently come from whole-blood, buccal swabs, and tail-hair. the most appropriate camel DNA source for the Cdrom Archive is tail-hair follicles. the quantity of DNA obtained from hair follicles is thus expected to be successfully used in each of PCR, STR and SNP genotyping. most of our samples so far were collected from Kuwait (15 locations) and only nine samples come from Saudi Arabia. GPS coordinates can be used to accurately reference each sample to its location of collection. the breeds currently in the Cdrom Archive are Majaheem, Sofor, Shaele, Homor, Shageh, Waddah, and Omani. for consistency, we have adopted the spellings used by Porter et al. (2016). studying the molecular basis of any trait is more achievable in a breed rather than in a random bred population. the mezayen camel breeds are the: Majaheem, Sofor, Shaele, Homor, and Waddah. we argue for their breed status because (1) each breed is defined by a distinct color group and a set recognized morphological features. a consensus of breed standards exists among breeders specifically for these six breeds. breeders often do not breed Majaheem camels with any of the Malaween breeds. breeders can easily recognize the hybrid due to changes in body features. images were extracted from Cdrom archives photos. mezayen camels are characterized by long tails with a narrow tail-base. the white disks on the tail are reference scales (five centimeters in diameter) images were extracted from Cdrom Archive photos (collected by the authors) the black breed is Majaheem whereas the malaween camels are further divided into five breeds based their coat color. the outer (small) circles represent the \u201csub-colors\u201d of each breed. the sofor sub-colors are crow-black, black, and light. two hair length varieties exist in each of the six Mezayen camels. breeders least favor the long-haired variety of each breed. hair texture variation may aid breeders in selecting camels based on their genotype. comes into two varieties, straight and ringed (Figure 7B) these two varieties occur in all six breeds. breeders select for curly hair that appear as rings. the torso region is considered signs of beauty and health. mutations in the Tyrosinase gene have been associated with darker coloration in specific body parts. the close resemblance in coat phenotype between Syrupy Sofor camels, Siamese and Burmese cats, California rabbits, and mice suggests the TYR gene could be a strong candidate for this phenotype. the six breeds are primarily divided into black vs. malaween breeds. the black breed is Majaheem whereas the Malaween camels are further divided into five breeds based their coat color. the color classifications presented here are more refined and are suspected to identify additional associated variants within MC1R and ASIP of each color. breeders least favor the long-haired variety of each breed, especially when the hair texture is straight. hair texture of mezayen camel coats comes into two varieties, straight and ringed (Figure 7B) these two varieties occur in all six breeds. breeders select for curly hair that appear as rings. the name of this breed is inspired by the camel breeders\u2019 imagination. the name of this breed is inspired by the camel extremities \"seem\" as if they were \"dipped in date syrup\" rom Archive sample would provide valuable insights into the extent of the morphometric differentiation among the camel breeds. based on our personal experience, collecting such data manually is time-intensive and imprecise. we developed a standardized method of photographing the sampled camels using the SamplEase application. extract data from photographs of the Cdrom Archive. authors declare research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. 33.3KB, xlsx."}
