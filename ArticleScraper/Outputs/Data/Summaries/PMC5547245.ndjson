{"summary": "an ontology that expresses the shared concepts and their relationships in a specific field could be used as a semantic framework for social media data analytics. Objective The aim of this study was to refine an adolescent depression ontology and terminology as a framework for analyzing social media data. adolescent depression was one of the major causes of death among young people aged 15 to 29 years worldwide in 2012. in south Korea, it was the single largest cause of adolescent deaths. adolescent depression is a chronic disease with a high risk of relapse. a few studies have examined the mental health status of users by analyzing SNS data. depressed users tended to use negative sentiment words and express anger compared with nondepressed users in their tweets. depressed users had recorded their personal information on twitter. text mining, a representative tool that analyzes social media data, does not express relationships among terms, which is why additional information is required to understand these relationships. an ontology that expresses \u201cthe shared concepts and their relationships in a specific field\u201d [21] could be used as an analysis framework for social media data. the ontology was designed based on the Ontology Development 101 [25] methodology. it was refined by applying the EAV triplet model to the internal structures of the ontology and by aligning superclasses with an upper ontology. the scope and domain of the ontology were defined by compiling a list of competency questions that the ontology should respond to. adolescent depression ontology linked to an upper ontology can be combined with other mental health and disease ontologies. we aligned superclasses with the BFO that has been used as a foundation for combining ontologies and creating high quality shared ontologies. ontology and Terminology Evaluation The resulting ontology was evaluated in terms of description logics and applicability. description logics are logics for the formal description of classes and the relationships between classes. the applicability refers to the utility of the ontology and terminology in sentiment analyses of social media data. we randomly selected about 10% of the sentiment phrases in the sentiment dictionary for depression [26] out of 13,352 total phrases, we identified factors in the signs and symptoms superclass affecting the sentiment of adolescent depression. the total number of texts with any sentiment was 86,957. ontology was designed based on the Ontology Development 101 [25] methodology. it was then refined by applying the EAV triplet model to the internal structures of the ontology and by aligning superclasses with an upper ontology. the ontology was defined by compiling a list of competency questions that the ontology should respond to. model We defined the properties of classes, the value of the properties, and the value type using the EAV data model. entities refer to the core concepts discussed on SNSs regarding adolescent depression. attributes are concepts describing entities in more detail. the first author extracted frequently asked questions on adolescent depression. the second author drew up a list of more detailed competency questions based on the FAQs. adolescent depression ontology linked to an upper ontology can be combined with other mental health and disease ontologies and applied to other domains. adolescent depression ontology linked to an upper ontology can be combined with other mental health and disease ontologies. description logic queries were expressed as combinations between a type of relationship and a core class, that is, depression in our study. three experts in psychiatric nursing extracted core concepts from the answers to the FAQs and mapped them onto the ontology classes manually. out of 3,703,135 texts, this study analyzed 161,581 texts on \"students under 19 years\" or \"elementary/middle/high school students\" each text was coded as 1 (=positive), 2 (=neutral), or 3 (=negative ). the total number of texts with any sentiment was 86,957. three experts in psychiatric nursing extracted core concepts from the answers to the FAQs and mapped them onto the ontology classes manually. the mapping rate was quantified as the extent to which the classes matched. each text was coded as 1 (=positive), 2 (=neutral), or 3 (=negative ). the total number of texts with any sentiment was 86,957. the total number of texts with any sentiment was 86,957. the risk factors superclass was classified into individual, family, school, community, and health facility domains. the intervention superclass was classified into individual, family, school, community, and community domains. the risk factors superclass was categorized into emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and physical changes. adolescent depression ontology alongside the basic formal ontology. examples of entity-attribute-value (EAV) data model in the ontology. adolescent depression ontology alongside the formal ontology. Query results inferred from ontology and core concepts and their synonyms. core concepts of signs and symptoms of a depressed mood in adolescents are marked with blue circles on the right side of Figure 2. \"there is serious bullying\" Myself Classmates or friends Seniors Juniors \u201cStress is severe\u201d Stress Presence Yes No Degree Mild Moderate Severe Cause Interpersonal relation

Insomnia Presence Yes No Type Hard to fall asleep A light sleep Degree Mild Moderate Severe Positive \u201cMy family is the probability of negative sentiment on adolescent depression was increased by 2.92 times compared with baseline. for the logistic regression, the predictive validity was.750 for precision and.742 for accuracy. for the decision tree, the validity indicators were.761 for precision and.750 for accuracy. the risk factors superclass was classified into individual, family, school, community, and health facility domains. the intervention superclass comprised individual, family, school, community, and health facility classes to include the content of prevention and treatment for adolescent depression. the risk factors superclass was classified into individual, family, school, and community domains. core concepts extracted from the answers to the FAQs were identical to the results of the mapping of the concepts onto the ontology concepts. the overall rate of mapping onto the ontology was 88.7%. 5 out of 6 concepts (83.3%) were represented in the ontology. negative sentiment phrases, 735 out of 799 sentiment phrases (92.0%) were defined using the EAV triplet of the ontology class concepts. negative-sentiment phrases, \u201cI am bullied\u201d and \u201cthere is serious bullying\u201d could be represented by combining the entity \u201cbullying\u201d in the risk-factors superclass, with \u201cvictim,\u201d \u201cexperience\u201d and \u201csevere\u201d being the values. antidepressant Taking drug Yes No Cycle of medication Regularly Irregularly Route of

\u201csad,\u201d \u201chostility,\u201d \u201cacademic stresses\u201d and \u201csuicide\u201d contributed negatively to the sentiment on adolescent depression. adolescent depression is affected not only by individual characteristics but also by environmental factors such as the family, school, and community. existing depression ontologies have defined environmental factors as the physical environment (eg, climate, noise, and pollution), social environment (eg, conflict, abuse, and discrimination), and financial environment (eg, income) the ontology included 75.0% of the core concepts identified in the answers to the FAQs. the ontology was able to answer the competency questions on risk factors, signs and symptoms, diagnostics, subtypes, and interventions for adolescent depression. this study improved the interoperability and reusability of an adolescent depression ontology by linking it to an upper ontology, BFO. this would increase the applicability of the ontology in other domains. this ontology can be reused in other studies related to competency questions proposed in this study. concepts extracted from the answers to the FAQs onto ontology concepts derived from description logics queries. the ontology provides an analytical framework for the analysis of SNS data and could improve the accuracy of interpretations of phenomena uncovered by SNS data analysis. the ontology developed in this study differs significantly from the depression ontologies designed previously [28,29] the ontology developed in this study integrated the comprehensive scope of adolescent depression, from risk factors, signs and symptoms, diagnostics, and subtypes, to interventions for prevention or treatment. the existing ontologies cover only restricted domains and a limited scope of knowledge for treatments by subtypes [28], depression-related signs and symptoms [29], or pathological processes of depression [31]. sentiment dictionary for depression was not represented by the EAV triplet of the ontology. 31 signs and symptoms classes were used as independent variables in logistic regression and data mining. academic stress and suicide were significant factors contributing to negative sentiment. adolescent depression ontology comprises 443 classes and 60 relationships. terminology comprised 1682 synonyms among the 443 classes. each class in the ontology was modeled according to the EAV triplet structure."}
