{"summary": "the emergence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and of multi-drug-resistant TB found health facilities underprepared to deal with this resurgence of an old epidemic. the response was a series of guidelines for the prevention of TB transmission in US health facilities published by the Centers for Disease Control. the occupational medicine component of occupational health has a strong focus on secondary and tertiary prevention, i.e., counselling, screening, case finding, medical treatment, placement and disability management of employees. there are other important differences between IPC and occupational health. a new form of activism has appeared, led by TB Proof, a south african organisation of health care professionals (www.tbproof.org), with strong involvement from individuals with a history of TB. TB Proof has identified what it perceives as the lack of urgency in all aspects of primary, secondary and tertiary prevention, including the development of new drugs against resistant disease. the impact of FAST on reducing TB rates in HCWs is still under study. the emergence of human immunodeficiency virus and of multi-drug-resistant TB found health facilities underprepared to deal with this resurgence of an old epidemic. the WHO approach emphasises elements more in keeping with the needs of low-resource countries. the need for a health systems perspective was also recognised by the WHO. the \u2018managerial\u2019 level was made explicit in the WHO guidelines of 2009. the history of occupational health and safety thus includes the political struggles of worker associations and labour unions to secure increasing and mandatory protection in the face of such resistance. a renewed influence of occupational health through the involvement of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) is apparent in a series of guidelines issued on HIV and TB. the administrative component of IPC has recently been \u2018re-focused\u2019 as a programme in the form of FAST.10,18. emergence of technical capacity for early and rapid diagnosis of TB disease and of drug susceptibility of the organism using GeneExpert technology. et al. argue proper attention to infection control should be seen as serving both the goals of controlling TB-HIV and health system strengthening. the argument should be extended to explicitly include occupational health. managers of health facilities may be wary of competing demands on resources across all these three levels of prevention. if effective, it will \u2018switch off the faucet\u2019, reducing pressure on system-wide or \u2018downstream\u2019 protective practices. if effective, it will \u2018switch off the faucet\u2019, reducing pressure on system-wide or \u2018downstream\u2019 protective practices, which is persuasive logic. there is a duty of care, ethical and legal, to pursue primary, secondary and tertiary prevention. this cannot be done without both IPC and occupational health approaches, and on first principles, this is better done through explicit cooperation rather than as parallel, or even competitive tracks."}
