{"summary": "the present review on Houttuynia cordata Thunb. provides up-to-date information with reference to botanical, commercial, ethnopharmacological, phytochemical and pharmacological studies that appears in the literature. the plant H. cordata is an aromatic medicinal herb with creeping root stock. leaf blades are broadly ovate or ovate-cordate, 4-10 cm long, 2.5-6 cm wide, thinly papery, densely glandular, usually glabrous. sometimes they are pubescent at vein axils, usually purplish abaxial, base cordate, apex shortly acuminate; veins 5-7, basal or innermost pair arising ca. 5 mm above the base. leaf juice is taken for the treatment of cholera, dysentery, curing of blood deficiency and purification of blood. leaves and stems are harvested during the growing season and are used as fresh decoctions. leaves and stems are harvested during the growing season. water extract of H. cordata at 100 mg; p.o. also inhibited the local allergic reaction, passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) also reduced the compound 48/80-induced mast cell degranulation and colchicine-induced deformation of rat peritoneal mast cells. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from mouse peritoneal macrophages. NSAID and specific COX-2 inhibitor NS398 functioned similarly in LPS-induced mouse peritoneal macrophages. aqueous solution of sodium chloride solution was reported in carrageenan induced inflammation in the rat pleurisy model and by xylene in the mice ear edema model. the fluid volume, protein concentration, C-reactive protein and cell infiltration were attenuated by HCI at all doses and touched bottom at a dose of 0.54 mL/100 g. quercetin 7-rhamnoside (Q7R) from H. cordata elicited anti-viral activities against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. aqueous extract of H. cordata possess anti-viral activity against dengue virus serotype 2 (DEN-2), strain 16681. hot water extracts of H. cordata blocked infection through inhibition of NF-B activation by the presence of major water extractable flavonoids quercetin or isoquercitrin at 10 M. anti-obesity effect Administration of an aqueous extract of leaves of H. cordata significantly inhibited the corn oil-induced increase in plasma triglyceride levels in mice. production with extract was 2-fold higher than that without extract. treatment with extract did not affect inducible nitrous oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression by RAW 264.7 cells. mortality rate in extract untreated group was 100% at 7th day. H. cordata induced apoptotic cell death in human primary colorectal cancer cells through mitochondria-dependent signaling pathway. the decrease in the level of (m) was associated with an increase in the BAX/BCL-2 ratio which led to activation of caspase-3 and -9. anti-allergic activity Aqueous extracts of H. cordata show significant effect on mast cell-mediated anaphylactic reaction. compound 48/80-induced systemic anaphylaxis in mice. also inhibited local allergic reaction, PCA, activated by anti-DNP IgE antibody. ethanolic extract weakly blocked the increased mRNA level. however, the stimulants and H. cordata ethanolic extract had no effect on the CCR4 protein level. anti-diabetic activity H. cordata water extract showed significant decrease in urinary protein, urinary albumin, monocyte chemo-attractant protein expression level and renal connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) methanolic extract of H. cordata powder increased growth performance, dry matter, nitrogen digestibility, white blood cell concentration, meat longissimus muscle area and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances value in finishing pigs. anti-mutagenic activity Aqueous extracts of H. cordata have been reported to possess anti-mutagenic effect on benzo (a) pyrene, aflatoxin B1 and oxidized frying oil. aqueous extracts of H. cordata showed a dose-dependent response using the Ames test in Sprague-Dawley rats. water extracts of H. cordata exhibit anti-inflammatory activity on lipoteichoic acid (LTA)-induced inflammation in dermal fibroblasts by blocking the tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) pathway. NS398 suppressed the level of LTA-induced TNF-, mRNA and LTA-induced COX-2 protein by up to 40% and 52% respectively. a carrageenan-air pouch model showed that HSE exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting both TNF--nitric oxide (NO) and COX-2-PGE2 pathways. the optimal dosage of HCI showed direct inhibitory activity on cell infection by pseudorabies herpesvirus. the 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) of Q7R was over 100 g/mL. the derived therapeutic index was 7142. aqueous extract of H. cordata possess anti-viral activity against dengue virus serotype 2. anti-bacterial activity of water extract of H. cordata showed anti-bacterial effects against murine salmonellosis. anti-bacterial activity of water extract showed anti-bacterial effects against murine salmonellosis. H. cordata water extract is stable and beneficial in the treatment of bacterial infection including intracellular replicating pathogens. the oil was also reported to play a significant role in activities of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reductase, ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase, aniline hydroxylase (ANH), aminopyrine demethylas six bioactive alkaloids, aristolactam B, piperolactam A, aristolactam A, norcepharadione B, cepharadione B and splendidine were isolated by bioactivity-guided fractionation of a methanolic extract of the aerial part of H. cordata. the extract inhibited the compound 48/80-induced systemic anaphylaxis in mice. ethanolic extract of H. cordata showed beneficial therapeutic effects on the T helper 2-mediated or allergic skin disorders. anti-diabetic activity H. cordata water extract suppressed anaphylactic reaction and IgE-mediated allergic response. anti-oxidant activity of H. cordata is mainly attributed to the presence of chlorogenic acids and its derivatives, catechin and procyanidin B. methanolic extract of H. cordata in an in vitro model has shown to possess free radical scavenging activity. cordata powder (1 g/kg p.o.) increased growth performance, dry matter, nitrogen digestibility, white blood cell concentration, meat longissimus muscle area and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances value in finishing pigs. aristolactams, 5,4-dioxoaporphines, oxoaporphines, amides, indoles, ionones, flavonoids, benzenoids, H. cordata is the only species in the genus Houttuynia. its medicinal importance is well-described in Chinese system of medicine in fever. it is widely used as vegetable in north-eastern parts of india and china."}
