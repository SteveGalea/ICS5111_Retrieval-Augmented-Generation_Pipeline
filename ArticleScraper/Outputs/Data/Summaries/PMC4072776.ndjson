{"summary": "many antiviral drug studies have been based on a functional analysis of viral genes and an understanding of the virus life cycle. acyclovir, which is the best antiviral agent against HSV-1, is a nucleotide analogue that shows an antiviral effect by inhibiting DNA replication [6]. commercially-developed antiviral drugs such as viral DNA polymerases, viral reverse transcriptases, and neuraminidase inhibitors target one or two viruses. scFv against HIV integrase and reverse transcriptase showed reduced viral progeny in scFv immunized cells [16], [17]. scFv against HIV integrase and reverse transcriptase showed reduced viral progeny in virus infected cells [16], [17]. no reports are available about scFv having an antiviral effect against a broad spectrum of viruses. 3D8 scFv has catalytic activity supporting hydrolysis of single stranded and double stranded DNAs in the presence of Mg2+ without significant sequence specificity. scFv is a recombinant single chain antibody linked to VH and VL by linker peptides. the expression patterns of viral open reading frames (ORFs) were identified and the FRET assay and confocal microscopy were performed. the antiviral effect against the DNA virus was caused by (1) nuclear DNase activity that inhibited DNA replication or RNA transcription. uSCH cells expressed similar levels of 3D8 scFv RNA to SCH07072. the mean for the HeLa cell line as a control was 79.48, SCH07041, SCH07071, and SCH07072 were 88.45, 109.17, and 126.38, respectively. 3D8 scFv expression levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in transgenic cell lines. expression levels of each cell line were compared to SCH07072. the SCH07072 line showed the lowest GFP expression compared to that of the other two lines (SCH07041 and SCH07071) and the mutant line (muSCH) the plaque assay data supported the GFP expression results showing the best antiviral effects among the three cell lines. SCH07072 cells had the lowest amount of virus progeny. the plaque assay also showed the highest antiviral effects in SCH07072 cells. the expression levels of 3D8 scFv in SCH07071 and SCH07072 cells were similar. but the antiviral activity of SCH07072 and SCH07071 were quite different. a certain amount of 3D8 scFv protein needs to be expressed. 3D8 scFv expression in transgenic HeLa cells confers resistance to PRV. three 3D8 scFv cells and one mutant 3D8 scFv cell line were challenged with PRV at two different MOIs. SCH07072 cells produced up to 660 relative fluorescence units (RFU) 80 min after the 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled DNA substrate was introduced into the cells. however, fluorescence output from SCH07072 and muSCH cells was a maximum of 200 RFU or less. fluorescence was determined by measuring absorbance at 485 nm. SCH07072 and muSCH had fluorescence levels of approximately 200 RFU. muSCH cells cultured with PAA showed as much virus DNA accumulation as HeLa cells at the early stage of infection. but 68% more viral DNA was detected in muSCH cells compared to the late stage of infection. SCH07072 cells cultured with PAA showed a substantial reduction in viral RNA accumulation during the entire infection cycle. SCH07072 cells expressed 83.1% and 87% less UL19 and UL 38 transcripts, respectively, than those of HeLa cells after virus challenge. the level of viral DNA replication in muSCH and SCH07072 cells was almost identical at immediate early stage. the level of viral DNA replication in muSCH and SCH07072 cells was also observed when selected viral RNA transcripts were measured in these cells at immediate early stage. however, transcription level of these genes in muSCH cells at the same stage did not show any significant difference. the antiviral effects of 3D8 scFv against HSV-1 and PRV infection were contributed by both the DNase activity, which is mainly effective in the nucleus and the RNase activity mainly effective in the cytoplasm. however, further experimental investigations are needed to confirm the antiviral mechanisms of 3D8 scFv proposed in this study. 3D8 scFv and DNase I did not digest DNA at a concentration of 1.4104 U/l. DNA without histones was reduced 34% and 90% after 1 hr and 3 hr. chromosomal DNA in the nucleus was protected from 3D8 scFv because chromosomal DNA is mostly methylated and histone-bound. chromosomal DNA in the nucleus was protected from 3D8 scFv because chromosomal DNA is mostly methylated and histone-bound. SCH07072 and muSCH cells showed similar doubling patterns when 72 hr growth curves were plotted. expression of the 3D8 scFv protein in SCH07072 cells did not affect cell growth or viability. 3D8 scFv and DNase I were detected in both the cytosol and nucleus of HeLa cells. the antiviral effects of the 3D8 scFv protein were almost 8-fold higher than those of DNase I. this result indicates that 3D8 scFv has a greater antiviral effect than DNase I. all transformants showed single bands that reacted with the probes prepared with the 3D8 scFv full gene. the muscle, brain, and liver were chosen because these organs are virus infection routes. the relative 3D8 scFv gene expression levels were investigated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. the relative expression of 3D8 scFv mRNAs was calculated after normalization to the GAPDH gene using the delta delta CT method. each qRT-PCR data point is a representative example of data from three replicate experiments. the difference in survival between WT-PRV and STG90-PRV was statistically significant. 3D8 scFv TG founder (F0 lines) was mated with wild-type C57BL/6NCrjBgi to establish the lines and produce siblings from the F0 lines. each of the four F169 lines were mated with wild-type C57BL/6NCrjBgi and then 20 F269 lines were produced. they were used for virus challenge experiments and named STG69. PRV gpD RNA was detected in the muscle and brain of WT, STG69, and STG135 mice accompanied by disease symptoms. only live STG90-PRV mice showed antiviral effects against PRV. v protein was expressed in the brain at similar levels to those observed in STG90 mice. the expression and presence of antiviral proteins in inoculated cells and tissues is as important as high expression levels in target cells or tissues. 3D8 scFv has no cytotoxic effect on the host cells. the cell viability was found to drop by 50\u201360% upon 10 M of 3D8 scFv treatment. treatment of the cells with 1 M and 5 M 3D8 scFv showed no significant cytotoxicity up to 48 h of incubation. low concentration of 3D8 scFv expressed in transgenic cell lines or TG mice is generally sufficient for conferring antiviral effects without incurring damage to the host DNA. the likelihood of 3D8 scFv having deleterious impact on host cells as well through non-specific nucleic acid hydrolysis activity remains valid. 3D8 scFv proteins were localized in cytosol using a vector system. 3D8 scFv proteins in SCH07072 were present in both the cytosol and nucleus. gene encoding 3D8 scFv was introduced into HeLa cells. scFv lines (SCH07041, SCH07071, and SCH07072) and mutated 3D8 scFv (muSCH) were selected by serial dilution in media containing G418 [28]. SCH07072 expressed the highest 3D8 scFv RNA compared to that of the other two cell lines (1.3 and 4 times more) pcDNA3.1/V5-HisB-3D8 scFv vector and pcDNA3.1/V5-HisB-mu3D8 scFv vector. 3D8 scFv expression levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in transgenic cell lines. the three 3D8 scFv lines and the one mutant 3D8 scFv line were challenged with HSV-1::GFP and PRV which had dsDNA as a genome. SCH07072 showed the lowest GFP expression compared to that of the other two lines (SCH07041 and SCH07071) and the mutant line (muSCH) three 3D8 scFv cell lines and one mutant 3D8scFv cell line were challenged with HSV::GFP at different MOIs. the SCH07072 line showed the lowest GFP expression compared to that of the other lines. cells compared to wild-type HeLa cells 48 hr after virus challenge. fewer cytopathic effects were observed in SCH07072 cells. fewer cytopathic effects were observed in SCH07072 cells. of 3D8 scFv in SCH07041 cells was significantly lower (approx. 1/3) than that of SCH07072 cells. both cells were equally resistant against HSV-1 infection at an MOI of 0.1. the antiviral effect of 3D8 scFv was shown in a dose-dependent manner. SCH07072 cells produced up to 660 relative fluorescence units (RFU) 80 min after the 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled DNA substrate was introduced into the cells. but the fluorescence output from HeLa cells, muSCH cells, and the negative control reactant was a maximum of 200 RFU or less. SCH07072 cells produced fluorescence counts up to 660 RFU 80 min after treatment. 3D8 scFv expressing cells induce viral DNA degradation in the nucleus and viral mRNA degradation in the cytosol. the changes in viral DNA content in SCH07072 and muSCH cells were traced at immediate early (2 hr after virus challenge, ICP4), early (6.5 hr after virus challenge, UL9) and late (25 hr after virus challenge, UL19) stages of infection. muSCH cells under the PAA-untreated condition showed as much virus DNA accumulation as HeLa cells at all stages of infection. quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure the expression of immediate early genes (ICP0 and ICP4), early genes (UL9 and UL29), and late genes (UL19 and UL38) only SCH07072 cells showed a substantial reduction in viral RNA accumulation during the entire infection cycle under the PAA-untreated condition. the viral RNA accumulation patterns in muSCH cells were similar to those in HeLa cells. however, in the absence of PAA the decreased level of viral DNA in muSCH cells is likely to be attributed to an interference of HSV -1 transcription by the RNase activity of the mutant 3D8 scFv. 3D8 scFv protein can distinguish methylated DNA and histone-bound DNA. muSCH cells showed limited antiviral activities at immediate early stage. however, it may indicate that mutant 3D8 scFv with only intrinsic RNase activity is not sufficient for providing a full protection for host cells against HSV-1 infection. 3D8 scFv and DNase I at 10104 U/l started to hydrolyze 0.2 g DNA 1 hr after treatment. at a concentration of 8.3104 U/l, 3D8 digested more non-methylated DNA than methylated DNA after 1 hr of treatment. genomic DNA and non-methylated DNA were treated with 3D8 scFv and DNase I at four concentrations: 10104 U/l, 8.3104 U/l, 1.4104 U/l, and 0 U/l. DNA samples were harvested and analyzed by electrophoresis at 0, 1, 2, and 3 hr after treatment. 3D8 scFv did not hydrolyze methylated or histone-bound DNA when the activity of 3D8 scFv was 1.4104 U/l. chromosomal DNA in the nucleus was protected from 3D8 scFv because chromosomal DNA is mostly methylated. 3D8 scFv and DNase I were transferred to HeLa cells using a microporator. the concentration of each protein was adjusted to be 1.5625103 to 0.05 units. no cell viability differences were observed between 3D8 scFv and DNase I concentrations of up to 0.05 units. the pcDNA3.1-3D8 scFv plasmid was linearized with NruI/StuI/PvuI enzymes and then used for transformation of C57BL/6NCrjBgi. 10 lines (F0: 47, 69, 90, 92, 108, 109, 110, 115, 128, and 135) out of 150 F0 were selected by PCR analysis. 8 scFv expression levels in the F0 69 line were low. mRNA expression was verified by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the muscle and brain of TG mice. in the F0 69 line, the F0 90 line produced 12.25 times more 3D8 scFv in the liver. the F0 110 and F0 135 lines showed 0.29 and 0.07 times less than that of the F0 69 line. therefore, the F0 69 line was used as a control and the F0 90 and F0 135 lines were used for testing the antiviral preventive effects in TG mice lines after PRV infection. the viability of the STG69 and STG135 lines against PRV challenges was 11% (2/18) however, the STG90 line showed 53% (9/17) viability. RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed to confirm virus accumulation in the 3D8 scFv TG lines after PRV inoculation. T-PRV group stained brown for the gpD protein, whereas no staining was observed in the other groups. this indicates that virus multiplication was not inhibited by the 3D8 scFv protein if virus infection was not protected against in the early infection stages by the 3D8 scFv protein. however, STG135 mice were not protected against PRV infection even though 3D8 scFv protein was expressed in the brain. 103.015.6 741.041.0 227.018.7 46.016.8 23.42.6 Male WT 4.00.1 42.04.6 68.02.6 535.088.6 269.025.1 31.08.2 20.81.1 STG90 4.20.0 46.04.0 72.010.4 663.051.5 242.05.6 32.01.0 19.22.9 Standard blood biochemistry parameters were analysed in 7-week-old WT C57BL/6 and STG90 mice. it is not clear how much 3D8 scFv protein actually penetrated into the cells from media when 5 M 3D8 scFv protein was administered. the actual level of 3D8 scFv expressed in transgenic cells was too low to be detected by Western blot analysis. however, it can be concluded that the low concentration of 3D8 scFv expressed in transgenic cell lines or TG mice is generally sufficient for conferring antiviral effects without incurring damage 3D8 scFv is a candidate antiviral protein that can confer resistance to a broad spectrum of animal and plant viruses. 3D8 scFv acts by inhibiting (1) viral DNA replication and RNA transcription in the nucleus via viral DNA degradation. s and viruses HeLa cells were provided by the Korean Cell Line Bank. they were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA), 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Hyclone) and non-essential amino acids (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) the relative concentrations of 3D8 scFv and mu3D8 scFv were calculated by quantitative real-time PCR after normalization to the GAPDH gene. the primer efficiency of 3D8 scFv and GAPDH are 1.845 and 2.065, respectively. cells on coverslips were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature. cells were permeabilized with Perm-buffer (1% BSA, 0.1% saponin, 0.1% sodium azide in PBS) after blocking with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 hr, 3D8 scFv-treated cells were incubated with rabbit cells were washed with ice-cold PBS twice, labeled with anti-rabbit 3D8 scFv Ab, followed by TRITC-anti-rabbit Ab.

Statistical analysis All analyses were carried out using the GraphPAD Prism program. a one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's post hoc t-test were used for statistical analyses. p0.05 was considered significant. pcDNA3.1-3D8 scFv and mu3D8 scFv were amplified by PCR from the pIg20-3D8 scFv vector [23] and then subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 V5/His-B vector. the relative concentrations of 3D8 scFv and mu3D8 scFv were calculated by quantitative real-time PCR after normalization to the GAPDH cells on coverslips were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) cells were permeabilized with Perm-buffer (1% BSA, 0.1% saponin, 0.1% sodium azide in PBS) after blocking with 3% BSA in PBS, 3D8 scFv-treated cells were incubated with rabbit anti-3D8 scFv Ab. cDNA was synthesized from 5 g of total RNA using random hexamers. cDNA was synthesized from 5 g of total RNA. cDNA was synthesized from 5 g of total RNA using random hexamers. the primer efficiency of ICP0, ICP4, UL9, UL29, UL19, and UL38 are 2.081, 1.989, 1.972, 1.916, 1.983, and 2.053, respectively. each data point represents the average of three individual experiments and the error bars indicate standard errors. each dilution (100 l) was used to infect Vero cells in duplicate. each cell line was infected by virus four times and plaques were counted three times. chromatin DNA and naked DNA were treated with 3D8 scFv and DNase I (10104 U/l and 8.3104 U/l, respectively) each DNA sample was harvested after 0, 1, 2, and 3 hr of incubation. the 3D8scFv TG founders (F0 lines) were mated with wild-type C57BL/6NCrjBgi mice to establish the transgenic lines and produce siblings from the F0 lines. all experiments were carried out under the guidelines of the NVRQS, Korea. anti-PRV gpD antibody (Jeno Biotech Inc.) was used as the primary antibody (1100) and was applied for 60 min at RT. samples were then treated for color development with the DAB Detection Kit. plasma levels of total albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, and other total proteins were analyzed using an automatic blood chemistry analyzer. 3D8 scFv and DNase I were transferred to HeLa cells using a microporator. the concentration of each protein was adjusted between 1.5625103 and 0.05 units. no cell viability differences were observed between 3D8 scFv and DNase I. lines 69, 90, and 135 founder mice were challenged with 10 LD50 PRV in the femoral muscle. each TG line and the WT line were challenged with 10 LD50 PRV in the femoral muscle.
