{"summary": "genus glycyrrhiza consists of approximately 30 species, in which six species produce a sweet saponin glycyrrhizic acid (GA) the most studied active constituent of licorice is a sweet-tasting material. the constituent is 50 times sweeter than sugar, making it a widely used sweetening additive in the food industry. 2.39 mg/g of GA and 0.92 mg/g of glabridin were successfully extracted from 1.0g licorice. the different extraction solvents used in the experiment for the extraction of GA and glabridin were water, methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile and chloroform. glabridin 10:90 2.44 0.82 30:70 2.39 0.92 50:50 2.01 0.92 70:30 1.53 0.93 90:10 1.09 0.93 2.2. effects of different extraction methods. 1.0 g licorice powder was extracted with 50 mL ethanol/water (30:70, v/v). 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.0 mg/mL were used for standard solutions of GA and glabridin. each concentration was injected 3 times. 0.05 74.5% 0.77 229 0.06 69.9% 0.07 73.3% 2.1. different extraction solvents used in the experiment for the extraction of GA and glabridin were water, methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile and chloroform. glabridin was easily extracted by methanol and ethanol. 1.0 g licorice powder was extracted with 50 mL ethanol/water (30:70, v/v) in dipping extraction, the powder of licorice was stirred with solvent for different times. the extracted amounts of GA and glabridin increased as the dipping times increased from 10 min to 90 min and no obvious increased after further prolong extraction time. concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.0 mg/mL for standards solutions of GA and glabridin were used. each concentration was injected 3 times. methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile and chloroform (HPLC Grade) were from Duksan Pure Chemical. Co., Ltd. (Korea) water was twice distilled and filtered (FH-0.45 m, Advantec MFS, Inc., Japan) glycyrrhizic acid (mono-ammonium salt hydrate) was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO) Glabridin was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Japan) the extracted amounts are 2.39 and 0.92 mg/g. recoveries are 89.7% and 72.5% respectively."}
