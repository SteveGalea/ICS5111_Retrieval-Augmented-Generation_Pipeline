{"summary": "vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotypes provide a highly validated surrogate system for recapitulating filovirus entry (25, 26) to facilitate viral tracking, virions were engineered to contain a fluorescent protein, monomeric NeonGreen (mNG), fused to the viral phosphoprotein (P) diD labeling was carried out so that the DiD signal remained visible when self-quenched. the plateau for the slow trace begins approximately 28 min after the onset of the signal increase. a.u., arbitrary units. the extent of dequenching varied somewhat among DiD-labeled particles. this may reflect differences in the volumes of endocytic compartments, as well as in the concentration of dye within the viral membrane. we initially investigated dequenching kinetics in Vero cells. thermolysin mimics the required cleavage of EBOV GP by endosomal/lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin B (19, 35), but did not accelerate dequenching kinetics compared to uncleaved EBOV GPMuc. dequenching kinetics of EBOV GPMuc-bearing particles in vero cells versus U2OS cells. viral lipid mixing is strictly GP mediated. failure to acidify endosomes precludes GP activation and infection. failure to acidify endosomes precludes GP activation and infection. a lack of cysteine cathepsin activity hinders downstream events in lipid mixing for EBOV GP. lipid mixing is the express product of GP triggering, which entails some degree of conformational change by proteolytically primed EBOV GP. the endosomal/lysosomal membrane protein NPC1 serves as an intracellular receptor for filovirus infection. a cysteine cathepsin-cleaved form of GP directly recognizing the lumenal domain C of NPC1 (20\u201322, 46) we evaluated lipid mixing in the absence of NPC1. proteolytic cleavage of GP1 exposes the NPC1-binding site. we investigated entry by VSV-EBOV GPMuc particles bearing three mutations in the NPC1-binding site (T83M in the trough, K114E/K115E in the crest) that abolish GP1-NPC1 interaction and viral infectivity (65). lipid mixing was reduced by 97% with this triple mutant. a recent report suggested that EBOV fuses exclusively in compartments devoid of NPC1 (50) the high percentage of dequenching particles colocalized with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Rab7 (98%) indicates the ubiquity of this protein in endosomes supporting GP triggering. a significant fraction of dequenching VSV-EBOV GPMuc particles colocalized with GFP-Rab5 puncta. despite their slower rate of lipid mixing events, these Rab5+ vesicles are likely intermediate endosomes, suggesting that GP triggering can occur earlier in the endocytic pathway. GP2 fusion loop mutations decouple lipid mixing and infection. internalization and late endosomal delivery of VSV particles bearing these mutants did not differ significantly from VSV-EBOV GPMuc. GP (F535R) mutant showed no defect in lipid mixing while being unable to support infection. increased infectivity of particles bearing cleaved GP has been reported. we did not observe this phenomenon or enhanced lipid mixing. dequenching by particles with cleaved EBOV GP was much less susceptible to E-64d blockage. human osteosarcoma cells were cultured in McCoy\u2019s 5a medium (Gibco) all culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin. generation of U2OS NPC1-ko cells was carried out by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing (62) using previously described methods. the deletion in NPC1-#6 cells is predicted to cause a frame shift at amino acid position 167 that leads to production of a truncated protein of 215 amino acids. we confirmed the absence of any remaining wild-type NPC1 alleles by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and further purified through a 10% sucrose cushion at 4\u00b0C and 107,000 g using an SW41 rotor. Pellets were then resuspended in PBS at an approximate viral protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. aliquots were stored at 80\u00b0C until use. pMAZ-IgH and pMAZ-IgL vectors were cotransfected with pMAZ-IgH-KZ52 and pMAZ-IgL-KZ52. antibody production and purification were carried out as described earlier (64), with modifications. s were incubated with ammonium chloride (Sigma) for 15 min or with E-64d (Peptides International) and tetrandrine (Sigma) for 1 h prior to experiments performed at the indicated concentrations. cells were transduced with cellLight vectors (Life Technologies) for early endosomes (GFP-Rab5), late endosomes (GFP-Rab7), or lysosomes (GFP-L KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, 2 g/ml Hoechst stain, and 2% FBS, pH 7.4) were spinoculated onto cells by 20 min of centrifugation at 1,500 g at 4\u00b0C. unbound particles were removed by four washes with cold PBS, and 500 l cold imaging buffer was added to the dish. Statistical significance was established by Student\u2019s t test or by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post hoc Dunnett\u2019s test (**, P 0.01; ***, P 0.001; ****, P 0.0001). cells by VSV pseudotyped with EBOV GP were left untreated (A) or incubated with U18666A (10 M) for 1 h (B), 2 h (C), 6 h (D), or 24 h (E) cells were left untreated (A) or incubated with U18666A (10 M) for 1 h (B), 2 h (C), 6 h (D), or 24 h (E) U2OS cells expressing LAMP1-GFP were infected with DiD-labeled particles bearing EBOV GPMuc. the white arrow indicates the particle of interest."}
