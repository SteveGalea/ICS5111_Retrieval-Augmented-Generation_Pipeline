{"summary": "of the estimated 57 million deaths that occur throughout the world each year, more than 25 percent are directly caused by infectious diseases. more than 90 percent of the worldwide mortality from infectious diseases is caused by only a handful of diseases, including lower respiratory infections, HIV/AIDS, diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis, malaria and measles. the aim of this review is to show the potential of a traditional plant, P. sidoides, for the defence against pathogens and the improvement of immune functions at various levels. the ethnomedicinal use of P. sidoides in the traditional medical systems of southern africa is mainly associated with gastrointestinal disorders. in southern africa, tuberculosis is one of the most commonly notified diseases. EPs\u00ae 7630 is a special aqueous ethanolic extract. results from clinical trials support the use of umckaloabo\u00ae in respiratory tract infections such as bronchitis, sinusitis and tonsillitis. erculosis (MIC of 100 g/mL) was assessed in a broth microdilution alamar blue assay. aqueous acetone extract of P. sidoides showed negligible antimycobacterial activities against the rapidly growing avirulent M. smegmatis. P. sidoides root extracts apparently show limited antimycobacterial activity. in vitro protocols reflect a direct action on mycobacteria pathogens. it is highly likely that the claimed effective use of P. sidoides may be due to stimulation of the non-specific immune system. MIC values were in the range of 200\u20131,600 g/mL, with MICs >800 g/mL for most of the bacteria tested. a series of studies attempting to demonstrate indirect antibacterial mechanisms that could provide a clue to the anti-infective properties of P. sidoides-based herbal medicines. anti-streptococcal activity of EPs\u00ae 7630 polyphenols appeared to be due to the prodelphinidin-type substructure (epigallocatechin and gallocatechin extender units) pre-treatment experiments indicated that the interaction of the anti-adhesive proanthocyanidins occurred only with binding factors on the bacterial surface. the demonstrated anti-adhesive mechanism may well contribute to the anti-infective activity of EPs\u00ae 7630 at an early time point of a bacterial infection. however, further studies are needed to get insight into the underlying principle that bacteria employ to invade our cells. EPs\u00ae 7630 exhibited antiviral effects in a number of assays. prominent cytoprotective effects were observed in a fibroblast-virus protection assay. antiviral factors are members of the IFN family classified in type I and type II interferons according to receptor specificity and sequence homology. the functional assay does not discriminate between IFN-, IFN- and IFN-, but the authors' interest focused on their detection using ELISA. eicosanoids may play a role in the control of viral infection may be excluded. direct antiviral activity of extract was first evaluated in vitro against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) on RC-37 cells using a plaque reduction assay. only pretreatment of viruses with the extract and subsequent infection of RC-37 cells revealed pronounced antiviral effects in a concentration-dependent manner. EPs\u00ae 7630 did not show any influence on non-enveloped rhino- and adenoviruses-induced cytopathogenic effects. observed varying susceptibilities to EPs\u00ae 7630 of influenza A subtypes can be rationalized by mutant haemagglutinins present on the surface of the individual influenza viruses. treatment of the extract with skin powder for the removal of tannins produced an inactive sample. the loss of activity of the polyphenol-free extract indicated that proanthocyanidins apparently represent the underlying active principle. independent support of the antiviral activity of EPs\u00ae 7630 originated from a current study using influenza A strains H1N1 and H3N2. induced cytotoxic defence mechanisms of activated macrophages are shown in Figure 3. primarily imply stimulation of the non-specific immune system. iNOS in activated macrophages induces the release of large amounts of NO for long periods. regulation of NO production is important for human health. in the presence of superoxide anion, a series of NO effector molecules might prevail. release of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- is an early step in a signalling cascade leading to production of antimicrobial NO. mycobacteria have developed multiple mechanisms for entering macrophages by a receptor-mediated pathway. stimulation of the non-specific immune system may contribute to the anti-infective activity of extracts. the immediate question thus concerned the factors that contribute to the immune control of microbial pathogens and possibly viruses associated with respiratory tract infections. the stimulation of the burst activity was still detectable even when all Candida organisms have already been ingested. results from a microbiological intracellular killing assay indicated that the number of surviving yeast cells were reduced by ca. 30% at 120 min compared with controls. pronounced antileishmanial effects were observed against intracellular amastigotes that are of clinical and pharmacological importance. EC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 3.3 g/mL compared with that of 7.9 g/mL for Pentostam\u00ae as positive control. the NO inducing potential of Pelargonium extracts was determined using the supernatants of sample treated macrophages (BMM, RAW 264.7) cultures as a source of secreted NO. that the immune response was considerably more expressed in infected cells. this suggests effective stimulation of the non-specific immune system when needed. the survival rate was not measured in this FACS-based assay due to non-availability of labelled L. monocytogenes organisms. however, stimulation of the non-specific immune system may be anticipated for intracellular residing mycobacteria. compared to the LPS stimulus (10 ng/mL; 184 U/mL) as positive control. gene expression analysis clearly showed augmented and prolonged up-regulation of TNF- transcripts in infected cells. incubation with EPs\u00ae 7630 increased production of intra- and extracellular IL-1 and IL-12 when compared to non-infected and just infected cells. the demonstrated augmented productions of IL-1, IL-12 and TNF- confirmed once more the potential of EPs\u00ae 7630 to induce host defence mechanisms for controlling infectious agents at single cell level. hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyl transferase mRNA was defined as 100%. this finding independently supported the anti-infective potential of P. sidoides. this herbal medicine also stimulated infected cells to produce IFN- transcripts. with LPS + IFN- or EPs\u00ae 7630 (30 g/mL) resulted in a dramatic down-regulation of the IFN- receptor subunit CD119 after 6 h post infection. changes in the expression of CD119 are suggested to affect the sensitivity of the cell in responding to IFN- [80]. traditional and therapeutic use of Pelargonium Sidoides Historically, the ethnomedicinal use of P. sidoides in the traditional medical systems of southern africa is mainly associated with gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea and dysentery) only some records exist for the treatment of respiratory conditions (tuberculosis, coughs, colds, sore throat) umckaloabo\u00ae was approved in germany as a drug for treating acute bronchitis. it is one of the most frequent diagnoses in medical practice. only in less than 10% of cases non-viral agents play a role in its etiology. an acetone extract of P. sidoides showed negligible antimycobacterial activities against the rapidly growing avirulent M. smegmatis. similar results were obtained from testing the extracts against M. aurum, a species reported to be predictive of activity against M. tuberculosis. aqueous acetone extract shows limited antimycobacterial activity under these test conditions. a range of isolated compounds (MICs of 200\u20131,000 g/mL) have been shown to be only modest compared with classic antibiotics. occus aureus, S. epidermis, Neisseria spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenza. MIC values were in the range of 200\u20131,600 g/mL, with MICs >800 g/mL for most of the bacteria tested. these findings prompted a series of studies attempting to demonstrate indirect antibacterial mechanisms. catechin-based polyflavans, a \u2018mixed\u2019 procyanidin sample, a prodelphinidin test substance as well as an A-type proanthocyanidin provided evidence that the anti-streptococcal activity of EPs\u00ae 7630 polyphenols appeared to be due to the prodelphinidin-type substructure. the blocked molecules, for example fibronectin- and collagen-binding adhesions, remain to be identified the demonstrated anti-adhesive mechanism may well contribute to the anti-infective activity of EPs\u00ae 7630 at an early time point of a bacterial infection. also worthy of mention is the potential of the extract to significantly inhibit streptococcal invasion into HEp-2 cells. EPs\u00ae 7630 exhibited antiviral effects in a number of assays. prominent cytoprotective effects were observed in a fibroblast-virus protection assay. eicosanoids may play a role in the control of viral infection may be excluded. eicosanoids may play a role in the control of viral infection. the extract did not induce any cytoprotective effects when directly exposed to ML929F. both herpes viruses cause common infections with recurrent orofacial (HSV-1) and genital lesions (HSV-2) only pretreatment of viruses with the extract and subsequent infection of RC-37 cells revealed pronounced antiviral effects in a concentration-dependent manner. the antiviral effect is likely due to interactions between the virus and extract components which remain to be identified. observed varying susceptibilities to EPs\u00ae 7630 of influenza A subtypes (H1N1, H3N1, H5N1) can be rationalized by mutant haemagglutinins present on the surface of the individual influenza viruses. these structurally modified glycoproteins, responsible for the binding of the virus to the host cell, may therefore be differently affected by the extract. the specificity of EPs\u00ae 7630 polyphenols for this biological activity was demonstrated by testing a range of flavanyl constituent units (procyanidins, prodelphinidins, A-type proanthocyanidins) the data suggested that the neuraminidase inhibiting activity of EPs\u00ae 7630 may be related to prodelphinidin extender units in oligoflavanoids. macrophages are extremely versatile cells involved in complex processes in immune responses. when activated they acquire microbicidal effector functions and secrete cytokines, resulting in recruitment of immune cells and subsequent elimination of the pathogen by phagocytosis. production of nitric oxide and its many congeners (NO) is another key macrophage antimicrobial response. the secretion of cytokines from activated macrophages and related cells is also an integral component of an effective immune response to a viral or bacterial infection. release of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- is an early step in a signalling cascade leading to production of antimicrobial NO. mycobacteria reside within cells and the less effective direct antibacterial potencies. stimulation of the non-specific immune system may contribute to the anti-infective activity of P. sidoides extracts. the immediate question thus concerned the factors that contribute to the immune control of microbial pathogens. the number of surviving yeast cells were reduced by ca. 30% at 120 min compared with controls. the benefit of the oral application may be seen in local effects on both the resident and invading phagocytes at the site of infection. intracellular amastigotes are of clinical and pharmacological importance, with EC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 3.3 g/mL compared with that of 7.9 g/mL for Pentostam\u00ae as positive control. treatment of infected BMM with EPs\u00ae 7630 resulted in a significant decrease of the intracellular GFP signal in a dose dependent manner. onium extracts and their constituents were determined using the supernatants of sample treated macrophages (BMM, RAW 264.7) cultures as a source of secreted NO. that the immune response was considerably more expressed in infected cells. this suggests effective stimulation of the non-specific immune system when needed. the data suggest that EPs\u00ae 7630 induces NO release in a broad spectrum of infectious conditions and, importantly, in therapeutically relevant doses ( 30 g/mL). this suggests stimulation of the non-specific immune system may be anticipated for intracellular residing mycobacteria. this functional bioassay has hitherto not been extended to infected macrophages. but gene expression analysis clearly showed augmented and prolonged up-regulation of TNF- transcripts in infected cells. the accumulation of this membrane-bound cytokine in stimulated infected cells was less pronounced than that in untreated cultures. EPs\u00ae 7630 increased the production of intra- and extracellular IL-1 and IL-12 when compared to non-infected and just infected cells. it is known that IL-1 synergizes with TNF- in the induction of IL-12 production which, in turn, induces IFN- release from both NK cells and T cells. IL-12 mediates protection by inducing NO production. the stimulation of the burst activity was still detectable even when all Candida organisms have already been ingested. results from a microbiological intracellular killing assay indicated that the number of surviving yeast cells were reduced by ca. 30% at 120 min compared with controls. antileishmanial effects were observed against intracellular amastigotes that are of clinical and pharmacological importance. EC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 3.3 g/mL compared with that of 7.9 g/mL for Pentostam\u00ae as positive control. the NO inducing potential of Pelargonium extracts was determined using the supernatants of sample treated macrophages (BMM, RAW 264.7) cultures as a source of secreted NO. the immune response was considerably more expressed in infected cells. this suggests effective stimulation of the non-specific immune system when needed. the survival rate was not measured in this assay due to non-availability of labelled L. monocytogenes organisms. however, an efficient elimination of the invading pathogens may be anticipated. the present data provide a clue for the claimed efficacy of this herbal medicine. all remaining samples showed only a negligible effect ( 5 U/mL) compared to the LPS stimulus (10 ng/mL; 184 U/mL) as positive control. gene expression analysis clearly showed augmented and prolonged up-regulation of TNF- transcripts in infected cells. ELISA was used for monitoring secreted cytokines in cell supernatants. incubation with EPs\u00ae 7630 increased production of intra- and extracellular IL-1 and IL-12 when compared to non-infected and just infected cells. IL-1 synergizes with TNF- induction of IL-12 production. 264.7 cells stimulated for 4 h with 50 g/mL of EPs\u00ae 7630. results are shown relative to hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyl transferase mRNA. this finding independently supported the anti-infective potential of P. sidoides observed at functional levels. the down-regulation of the IFN- receptor subunit CD119 was consistent with similar effects in L. monocytogenes infected BMM [79]. changes in the expression of CD119 are suggested to affect the sensitivity of the cell in responding to IFN-. traditional south africa herbal medicine has found its way into european laboratories. recent chemical, pharmacological and clinical studies of a special extract, referred to as EPs\u00ae 7630 and developed from this traditional medicine."}
