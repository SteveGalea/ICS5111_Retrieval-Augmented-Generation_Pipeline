{"summary": "cells were seeded in 48well plates and transduced with RGD4C/AAVPGFP or RGD4C/AAVPLuc and control nontargeted vectors. after 4 h, an equal volume of complete medium was added to the cells and incubated at 37 \u00b0C overnight. melanoma cells were incubated in vitro with targeted RGD4C/AAVP or control nontargeted vectors for 4 h. after 24 h, internalized RGD4C/AAVP particles were detected using rabbit antiM13phage primary and goat antirabbit AlexaFluor594 secondary (red) antibodies."}
