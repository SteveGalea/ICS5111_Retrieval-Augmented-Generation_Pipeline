{"summary": "senescence is one of the least well-examined and understood areas of veterinary geriatric medicine. a consensus is that there is an age-related decline in absolute numbers of lymphocytes, decreased CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio, and decreased proliferative responses to mitogens comparing \"old\" versus \"young\" dogs. obesity has attendant disease-promoting effects in humans and their pets. large and giant breeds of dogs on average have shorter lifespans compared to small dogs. small and large breed dogs were defined as those weighing 15 kg. medium and large breed dogs were defined as those weighing 15 kg. Bordetella bronchiseptica-specific antibodies were detected by an indirect ELISA as previously reported (7). 96-well plates were coated overnight with sonicated B. bronchiseptica antigen. non-specific binding sites were blocked with 1% gelatin. Statistical analyses were performed using commercially available software programs. descriptive analyses were completed and variables were recoded as necessary for statistical modeling. neither the immune response data nor the time between sample collection and previous vaccination data were normally distributed. the control dogs (median: 279, range: 0 to 1458) and the lean geriatric dogs (median: 28, range: 3 to 142) or between the control dogs and the obese geriatric dogs (P = 0.78, median: 18, range: 5 to 106). there was also no statistically significant difference between CPIV IgG ELISA titers (P = 0.21) or time between sample collection and vaccination in days (P = 0.08) between the le no statistical difference (P = 0.21) was noted between the control dogs (median: 249, range: 0 to 772) and the obese geriatric dogs (median: 9, range: 4 to 313) for time in days between sample collection and last vaccination. no statistically significant difference between CRCoV IgG ELISA titers (P = 0.05) between the lean and obese geriatric groups of dogs. no statistical difference was noted between the control dogs (median: 279, range: 0 to 1458) and the lean geriatric dogs (median: 334, range: 13 to 1922) for time in days between sample collection and last vaccination. canine parvovirus HAI titers were statistically (P = 0.002) higher in the control dogs (median: 1920, range: 60 to 1920) compared to the obese geriatric dogs (median: 480, canine distemper virus SN titers were not statistically (P = 0.16) different between the control dogs (median: 279, range: 0 to 1458) and the obese geriatric dogs (median: 108, range: 12 to 2916) there was also no statistically significant difference between CDV titers (P = 0.36) or time in days between sample collection and vaccination in days (P = 0.04) between the lean and obese geriatric groups Bordetella bronchiseptica Out of the 93 enrolled dogs, 30 had vaccination dates for B. bronchiseptica recorded. these included 17 controls, 10 lean geriatric and 3 obese geriatric dogs. all 93 enrolled dogs, including 37 controls, 28 lean geriatric and 28 obese geriatric dogs, were included in this analysis. CRCoV IgG ELISA titers were statistically (P = 0.05) different between the control dogs (median: 5, range: 0 to 36) and the lean geriatric dogs (median: 11, range: 0 to 34) or between the control dogs and the obese geriatric dogs (P = 0.60 geriatric dogs were statistically higher in the control dogs (median: 324, range: 18 to 972) than in the lean geriatric dogs (median: 108, range: 12 to 972) but no statistical difference (P = 0.10) was noted between the control dogs (median: 279, range: 0 to 1458) and the obese geriatric dogs (median: 158, range: 0 to 2008) for time in days between sample collection and last vaccination there was no statistically significant difference between CDV titers (P = 0.36) or time in days between sample collection and vaccination in days (P = 0.04) between the lean and obese geriatric groups. a major limitation of this study is the relatively small number of experimental subjects and sufficient intragroup and interbreed variation. the percentage of presumed memory CD4 and CD8 T-cells expressing CD44 is increased in older dogs (2). these immunological phenomena could account for the likelihood that primary antibody responses may be reduced in older dogs. this latter possibility may explain the lack of significant differences in responses to CPIV and CRCoV among these groups. these lifestyle effects on exposure are likely to occur in the case of responses to B. bronchiseptica as well (7,14,15) based on these data, it is likely that both age and nutritional status affect the canine response to infectious diseases."}
