{"summary": "the distinction between cellular life and the virus world could be based simply on whether an entity encodes ribosomes or a capsid. in RNA viruses in particular, non-canonical translation seems to be more the rule than the exception, with some individual viruses employing several different mechanisms. this review will discuss some of these recently discovered examples, besides revisiting some classical cases. arrows indicate the probable movement of 40S subunits in a non-canonical manner. in the stop\u2013carry on mechanism, both termination and initiation steps are non-canonical. translation can be divided into four stages: initiation, elongation and termination. the helicase eIF4A and its cofactor eIF4B unwind RNA secondary structures in the 5\u2032UTR of the mRNA. eIF5 triggers hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP, the 40S subunit locks into a closed conformation with Met\u2013tRNAi in the ribosome. eIF1 and eIF5 are released. eukaryotic release factor eRF1 mediates termination of translation and release of the newly synthesized protein. post-termination ribosomes are separated into component 40S and 60S subunits by ATP and ABCE1. mRNA circularization described earlier is believed to enhance translation. non-canonical translational mechanisms provide alternative ways to express multiple proteins from a single mRNA. RNA viruses also have very compact genomes, with the largest around 30 kb (e.g. some members of the families Coronaviridae and Reoviridae) many viruses lack the machinery to add a 5\u2032 cap and/or poly(A) tail to their transcripts and have evolved alternative mechanisms for ribosome recruitment and/or mRNA circularization. some viruses have evolved proteins and or RNA structural elements that further enhance translation of the viral mRNAs. two major classes (types I and II) have been identified that are distinct in structure and sequence. typically require most of the canonical initiation factors for activity, including eIF3, eIF4A and the C-terminal domain of eIF4G, besides the eIF2\u2013Met\u2013tRNAi\u2013GTP ternary complex. similar IRESes are also found in pestiviruses and teschoviruses. initiation may proceed via an eIF2-independent route that involves the cellular protein ligatin. this mechanism has been demonstrated in the sgRNA of Sindbis alphavirus. it can also occur on the hepatitis C virus IRES. a similar positioned but otherwise unrelated overlapping coding sequence appears likely to be present in turdivirus 3 (family Picornaviridae), genus Paraturdivirus. in foot-and-mouth disease virus, two in-frame AUG codons are used as alternative initiation sites to produce different isoforms (Lab and Lb) of the leader protease. members of at least one group of dicistroviruses express an additional protein from a short ORF that overlaps the 5\u2032-proximal region of the structural polyprotein ORF in the +1 reading frame. translation of this ORF appears to be directed by an extra base-pairing interaction in the P-site anticodon. PK I occupies the ribosomal P-site and translation of ORF2 initiates at the GCG codon in the ribosomal A-site. the formation of an additional base pair leads instead to initiation at the +1 frame GCG codon. leaky scanning may allow expression of multiple C-terminally coincident isoforms of a single protein (in-frame alternative initiation sites), distinct proteins encoded by different overlapping ORFs or even distinct proteins encoded by non-overlapping sequential ORFs. ribosomes scan through a region of around 895 nt to translate the third of three consecutive ORFs. examples of known and suspected cases of leaky scanning. see also Table 2 for cases that involve non-AUG initiation. murine norovirus, neboviruses, some sapoviruses VP1/ORF4 Simmonds et al.

ACG Curran & Kolakofsky (1988); Gupta & Patwardhan (1988) Respirovirus. rice tungro bacilliform tungrovirus (family Caulimoviridae) involves three consecutive ORFs. the second ORF initiates at an AUG codon with a poor context. a second case that is looking increasingly widespread occurs in some members of the family Tombusviridae. coat protein and p15 are expressed from a GUG initiation codon. coat protein and p15 are expressed from AUG codons. p6.6 is expressed from a suboptimal context. shunting allows ribosomes to access downstream ORFs in a manner that is 5\u2032-end-dependent but scanning-independent. one of the best-studied examples occurs in viruses of the family Caulimoviridae \u2013 a family of plant-infecting pararetroviruses. pgRNA is capped and has a long 5\u2032UTR, much of which is predicted to fold into a large stem\u2013loop structure. translation is 5\u2032-cap-dependent and the 40S subunits of ribosomes that scan to and translate the short ORF are able to bypass the stem\u2013loop. it is thought that this ability depends on the small subunit of the ribosome retaining certain initiation factors during translation of the short ORF. 40S complexes released after translation of the short 5\u2032-most ORF are able to shunt past a stable stem\u2013loop in the 5\u2032UTR (red arrow) and continue scanning the mRNA. downstream ORFs I\u2013V are translated via reinitiation events that are stimulated by a viral reinitiation factor, transactivator viroplasmin (TAV) the 40S and 60S subunits of the ribosome dissociate and leave the message. after translation termination, the 40S subunit may remain associated with the message, resume scanning, and reinitiate translation at a downstream AUG codon. the ability of 40S subunits to remain associated with the message is thought to depend on certain initiation factors remaining attached to the ribosome during translation of the short ORF. Calicivirus genomes generally contain at least three protein-encoding ORFs. ORF1 encodes the major capsid protein and a small basic protein that is a minor component of the virion. reinitiation is dependent on RNA sequence motifs typically within the 40\u201390 nucleotides directly upstream of the ORF2 termination codon. a proportion of 40S subunits of ribosomes terminating translation of ORF2 are tethered with eIF3 to the mRNA via interaction with the TURBS. the TURBS has also been shown to bind eIF3. a similar reinitiation mechanism appears to be used by influenza B virus for translation of the BM2 protein. the coding sequences overlap with the sequence UAAUG and an upstream TURBS. reinitiation still preferentially occurs at the natural position. TURBS motif 1 (UGUGGGA) is predicted to be located in an RNA secondary structure. the secondary structure is located in the mRNA exit channel of the ribosome. the interaction is likely to be stabilized by eIF3. these interactions act to tether the ribosome to the viral RNA. this prevents its dissociation, allowing time for the recruitment of initiation factors and subsequent reinitiation on the downstream ORF. reinitiation is dependent on sequences upstream of the termination codon. a TURBS-like sequence has not been identified. the reinitiation AUG codon can be some distance upstream of the codon. in cauliflower mosaic caulimovirus, TAV is encoded by ORF VI. several consecutive ORFs are translated via TAV-mediated reinitiation. reinitiation does not appear to require specific sequence elements in the RNA transcript. picornaviruses harbour type I IRESes (poliovirus and other enteroviruses) the initiator AUG for translation of the viral polyprotein is located some distance downstream of the site of recruitment of the 40S subunit to the IRES. similar IRESes are also found in some pestiviruses and teschoviruses. initiation may proceed via an eIF2-independent route that involves the cellular protein ligatin. this mechanism has been demonstrated in the sgRNA of Sindbis alphavirus. it can also occur on the hepatitis C virus IRES. dicistroviruses have two non-overlapping coding sequences where translation of each is directed by a distinct IRES. the intergenic region IRES (IGR-IRES) that directs translation of the 3\u2032 ORF encoding structural proteins is very unusual. it is short (typically around 180 nt) in comparison to picornavirus IRES (typically around 450 nt) canine picodicistrovirus appears to have two picornavirus-like IRESes. the 3\u2032 ORF encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and other non-structural proteins may have a dicistrovirus-like IGR-IRES. ribosomal P-site and translation of ORF2 initiates at the +1 frame GCG codon in the ribosomal A-site. initiation at the +1 frame GCG codon leads instead to initiation at the +1 frame GCG codon and translation of ORFx. distinct proteins encoded by different overlapping ORFs can be considerable. ribosomes scan through a region of around 895 nt to translate the third of three consecutive ORFs. other cases have been identified where three or even four distinct proteins are translated from a single transcript. full details of references in Tables 1\u20135 are available from the authors on request. the coding sequence for a 14 kDa non-structural protein, 1s, lies entirely within the coding sequence for the 49 kDa attachment protein, 1. the 1 AUG initiation codon has a suboptimal context. the 1s AUG codon is 58 nt 3\u2032 in the +1 reading frame. the NSs protein is translated from an ORF of around 100 codons. a similar N/NSs arrangement is also present in hantaviruses. calicivirus RNAs lack a 5\u2032 cap and instead possess a viral protein (VPg) linked covalently to the 5\u2032 end. the presence of VPg facilitates 40S binding on a short leader. the close proximity of a downstream AUG codon to a preceding AUG codon can also increase the efficiency of leaky scanning. there are a number of cases of leaky scanning \u2013 including the PB1-F2 protein of influenza virus A. such codons would be expected to \u2018soak up\u2019 a proportion of scanning ribosomes \u2013 depending on their contexts. however, provided the ORFs are short, these ribosomes may still be able to reinitiate on the major downstream ORF(s) non-AUG initiation normally requires a strong context (e.g. an A or G at 3 and a G at +4) and is enhanced when an RNA structure (e.g. a stem\u2013loop) is able to form at a distance of approximately 14 nt 3\u2032 of the initiation codon. the codons CUG, GUG, ACG, AUU, AUA, AUC and UUG are known to allow appreciable levels of initiation (e an upstream in-frame ACG codon is used to initiate translation of C\u2032. the initiation codon for P lacks a purine at 3, thus all three proteins can be translated via leaky scanning. a homologous extension in feline leukemia gammaretrovirus initiates at an AUG codon. sendai virus C\u2032 (N-term. extension of C) ACG Curran & Kolakofsky (1988); Gupta & Patwardhan (1988) Respirovirus \u2013 human parainfluenza virus 1 GUG Boeck et al.

(1996) Many examples of non-AUG initiation come from plant viruses. in some cases, non-AUG initiation and leaky scanning are used to express three or even four separate proteins from a single transcript. initiation codons are indicated in upper case and nucleotides that differ from a strong initiation context are indicated in red. the 'triple gene block' is an evolutionarily conserved module that comprises three proteins. the allexiviruses clearly contain a TGB3 coding sequence. instead, the TGB2 AUG initiation codon consistently has a weak context (C or U at 3, A at +4) thus facilitating leaky scanning. shunting allows ribosomes to access downstream ORFs in a manner that is 5\u2032-end-dependent but, at least partly, scanning-independent. large stem\u2013loop and 5\u2032-adjacent short ORF are predicted to be present in most sequenced members of the Caulimoviridae. ribosomes that scan to and translate the short ORF are able to bypass the stem\u2013loop and resume scanning at a landing site just 3\u2032 of the stem\u2013loop. downstream ORFs I\u2013V are translated via reinitiation events that are stimulated by a viral reinitiation factor, transactivator viroplasmin (TAV) downstream ORFs I\u2013V are translated via reinitiation events that are stimulated by a viral reinitiation factor, transactivator viroplasmin (TAV) the ability of 40S subunits to remain associated with the message is thought to depend on certain initiation factors remaining attached to the ribosome during translation of the short ORF. reinitiation after translation of a long ORF is much rarer and requires special signals within the mRNA or specific trans-acting protein factors. reinitiation after translation of a long ORF is much rarer and requires special signals within the mRNA or specific trans-acting protein factors. xoviridae \u2013 influenza virus B, segment 7 M1/BM2 Horvath et al.

(2004); Gould & Easton (2007) Totiviridae \u2013 Victorivirus Gag/Pol Huang & Ghabrial (1996); reinitiation is dependent on RNA sequence motifs typically within the 40\u201390 nucleotides directly upstream of the ORF2 termination codon. this sequence region is termed the TURBS (termination upstream ribosome-binding site) it contains a short sequence motif (motif 1; UGGGA and flanking nucleotides) that is complementary to the loop region of helix 26 of 18S rRNA. m1 and BM2 coding sequences overlap with the sequence UAAUG and an upstream TURBS. increasing the distance between the TURBS and the termination codon reduces reinitiation efficiency. reinitiation still preferentially occurs at the natural position with respect to the TURBS. caliciviruses are also capable of expressing the capsid protein from the genomic RNA due to ORF2 being contiguous with ORF1. a termination\u2013reinitiation mechanism is also used by pneumoviruses and metapneumoviruses to express their M2-1 and M2-2 proteins from a single transcript. reinitiation is dependent on sequences upstream of the termination codon, but a much larger sequence region is involved. reinitiation in the above viruses is mediated partly or wholly by RNA sequences directly upstream of the termination codon. reinitiation is mediated by a viral protein \u2018transactivator viroplasmin\u2019 or TAV, which is translated from a subgenomic 19S transcript. TAV-mediated reinitiation does not appear to require specific sequence elements in the RNA transcript. TAV is thought to tether eIF3 to the elongating ribosome during translation of the upstream ORF, thus assisting reinitiation on downstream ORFs. non-canonical translation mechanisms that act during elongation are known as recoding mechanisms. g\u2013Pol polyprotein of Rous sarcoma alpharetrovirus is expressed from overlapping gag and pol ORFs. the mRNA signal for 1 frameshifting in eukaryotic systems comprises two elements: a slippery sequence with consensus X_XXY_YYZ. the mRNA signal for 1 frameshifting in eukaryotic systems comprises two elements: a slippery sequence with consensus X_XXY_YYZ.

(2010) Pi \u2018RT\u2019 indicates a stop codon readthrough site. there is considerable experimental support for the idea that \u2018tandem slippage\u2019 occurs upon encounter of the stimulatory RNA. the tRNAs detaching from the zero-frame codons (XXY_YYZ) and re-pairing in the 1 frame (XXX_YYY) are tolerated. many positive-strand RNA viruses, retroviruses, and some members of the family Totiviridae of dsRNA viruses make use of 1 frameshifting to express their RdRp or reverse transcriptase. in retroviruses and totiviruses, for example, it allows the virus to generate a defined ratio of Gag\u2013Pol that is likely to be optimized for virion assembly. in alphaviruses, the encephalitis serogroup of flaviviruses, frameshifting adds a 52 aa transframe C-terminal extension to the NS1 protein to produce the NS1\u2032 protein. in encephalomyocarditis cardiovirus, frameshifting produces a 128 or 129 aa protein, 2B*, in which just the N-terminal 11\u201312 aa are encoded by the zero frame. oviridae is a family of large positive-strand plant-infecting RNA viruses. the RdRp is encoded by ORF2, which is in the +1 frame relative to ORF1. many 3\u2032 ORFs are translated from sgRNAs. the 5\u2032 CC is conserved despite the corresponding ORF1-frame xCC codon being GCC, UCC or ACC in different isolates. in Trichomonas vaginalis viruses 2, 3 and 4, ORF2 is in the 1 frame relative to ORF1 and 1 frameshifting is predicted to occur on a G_GGC_CCY heptanucleotide. the amalgamaviridae \u2013 a recently proposed family of mono ridae (the largest family of RNA plant viruses) was shown to be translated and essential for virus infectivity. in turnip mosaic potyvirus, the ORF (known as pipo) is expressed as part of an approximately 25 kDa product that is believed to correspond to a fusion of PIPO with the N-terminal region of P3. current evidence suggests that it occurs at the level of translation rather than transcription. readthrough allows the production of a C-terminally extended polypeptide at a defined frequency. in luteoviruses readthrough at the end of the coat protein gene generates a protein required for aphid transmission by their plasmodiophorid vectors. readthrough can be influenced by elements located both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 of the suppressed stop codon. 3\u2032 RNA structures typically beginning around 8 nt 3\u2032 of the stop codon are a common (but not ubiquitous) feature of different types of readthrough. the exact mechanism(s) by which such structures promote readthrough is not currently known, but possibilities include modulation of ribosome activity directly through mRNA\u2013protein or mRNA\u2013rRNA interactions. type II readthrough occurs in replicase gene of a number of alphaviruses. replicase gene of tobraviruses, pecluviruses, furoviruses and pomoviruses.

Exceptions to the canonical translational rules can be programmed or incidental. latter may be thought of as translational noise and occur in probably all genes for a small proportion of translating ribosomes. however, they are not subject to strong purifying selection so are generally not phylogenetically preserved over significant evolutionary distances."}
