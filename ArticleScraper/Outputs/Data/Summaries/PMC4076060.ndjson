{"summary": "subjects with influenza-like illness only had laboratory testing specific for the new influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus during the pandemic CONTAIN phase. two hundred and fifty-five randomly selected samples were tested for other respiratory viruses using a real-time multiplex PCR assay. the ALERT phase was defined as the period when only a few cases of A(H1N1)pdm09 had been reported in a few countries, but not in Australia. the first Australian cases were imported from the Americas; the first locally-acquired case in new south Wales was identified on the 20th May. Combined nose and throat swabs collected in viral transport medium were tested for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus by nucleic acid tests (NAT) between the 25th May and 7th June, 1466 patient samples met the CONTAIN-phase definition for laboratory testing. 43/56 reported a travel history outside Australia, including the 37 passengers on the cruise ship and six with a history of air travel to other countries. human metapneumovirus (hMPV), rhinoviruses and enteroviruses were tested directly from the NA extract and formed the fourth set. four Ls of cDNA or extract was amplified in a total volume of 20 L with 0.5 M of each primer and 0.2 M of each probe. tgatgctttttggrtttcaatatatgg BHQ1 in-house Influenza A (matrix) AMF2 Probe: Cal fluo Red610 acgctgcagtcctcact BHQ2 in-house Influenza B (nucleoprotein) BNF For: yaacgatgacatggagagaaaac in-house BNR Rev: gcctcctgt cattgaggagcaagagcaac in-house Para3P Probe FAM ttggcatcgaacarcattcc BHQ1 in-house Rhino & Entero (5\u2032UTR) Rhi3A For: gaaacacggacacccaaagtaagtaagtaagtaagtaagtaagtaagtaagtaagtaag 255 samples were collected from 219 adults, 33 children and 3 with no age recorded. 113 (44.3%) had one or more respiratory viruses detected. five viral co-infections were identified, four with RSV and rhinoviruses. 3N2, 2 RSV, 1 parainfluenzavirus 2, 1 enterovirus and 2 co-infections with RSV and rhinoviruses.
