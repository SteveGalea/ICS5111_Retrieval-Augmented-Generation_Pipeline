{"summary": "bats may have been the ancestral source of hepatitis C, hepatitis B, mumps, and GB viruses that are endemic in humans. two new lineages of influenza A viruses were recently detected in the little yellowshouldered bat. the viral genome exploits splicing, frame-shifting and leaky scanning to code for at least 14 different proteins. influenza viruses are classified into subtypes based on their two major surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) prior to the identification of influenza virus in bats, 16 HAs and nine NAs had been identified. 1982 also claimed isolation of influenza A virus from bats. the bat sera recognized human H2N2 and H3N2 viruses. this suggests replication and diversification of these viruses occurred over a significant period of time. the \u201cinternal\u201d gene segments from bat viruses (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, NS, M) form outgroups to the same genes from all other extant influenza A viruses. a more recent analysis invokes a large-scale sweep of internal gene segments in avian viruses, drastically reducing genetic diversity for all internal genes. the viral RdRP is composed of the subunits PB1, PB2, and PA. it assembles large complexes with viral RNA and the viral nucleoprotein (NP) to replicate the genome. species-specific RdRP activity is an impediment to host switching. bat cells restrict the activity of an avian-origin polymerase. the bat polymerase and NP support high-titer replication of chimeric viruses in cells from a number of mammals. multiple groups have tested whether avian and human influenza virus could move into bats. HA contains a membrane-distal globular head supported by an extended stem. HA is post-translationally cleaved in the stem region to yield HA1 and HA2 subunits. species-specific variations in sialic acid structures are a major barrier to cross-species transmission. structures of H17 and H18 differ most from canonical HA at the RBS. structures of H17 and H18 differ most from canonical HA at the RBS. the presence of an aspartate at position 136 in the 130-loop of H17 and H18 would cause electrostatic repulsion of sialic acid in the binding cavity. the structures also reveal other changes in the HA trimer that might affect function and stability. the bat NA proteins do not appear to behave as classical hemagglutinins. n10 and N11 assemble as a tetramer with a \u201cbox-shaped\u201d ectodomain. the enzymatic activity is localized to the ectodomain. superimposing sialic acid from prior NA structures onto N10 or N11 shows that even in these larger binding pockets the classical sialic acid substrate would clash with residues lining the pocket [14,58] a similar topology and predicted clash is present in structures of N11, although less pronounced than that of N10 [14] reverse genetics will unravel the unusual biology and replication strategy. the findings will have implications for how influenza viruses adapt to and replicate in novel hosts."}
