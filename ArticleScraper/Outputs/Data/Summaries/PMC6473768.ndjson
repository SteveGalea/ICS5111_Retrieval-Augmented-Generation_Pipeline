{"summary": "chronic rhinitis is characterized by the presence of two or more symptoms for at least 12 weeks. rhinitis is characterized by the presence of two or more symptoms for at least 12 weeks. rhinitis is an umbrella term; it can be distinguished in different categories. the most common causes of chronic rhinitis in the paediatric population are presented. the most common causes of chronic rhinitis in the paediatric population are presented. the most common causes of chronic rhinitis in the paediatric population are presented. allrgic rhinitis (AR) Infectious rhinitis Non-allergic rhinitis (NAR) Drug-induced Hormonal-induced Gustatory rhinitis Local allergic rhinitis (LAR) Mixed rhinitis Structural abnormalities Adenoidal hypertrophy Immunodeficiency Cystic fibrosis (CF) Ciliary dyskinesia Table 2 contains typical signs and symptoms observed during clinical examination. prior allergy testing history (SPT, specific serum IgE) Prior CT imaging or other diagnostic work up Prior surgical history (ear tubes, adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, sinus surgery, turbinoplasty) Atypical symptoms. check for unilateral symptoms, pain, recurrent epistaxis, nasal obstruction without other symptoms, mucopurulent rhinorrhea, thick post nasal drip, and recurrent, prolonged infections. anterior rhinoscopy will allow the inspection of the anterior parts of the nose. it can reveal nasal secretions (transparent or discoloured), crusting, mucosal oedema, anatomic asymmetries, foreign bodies, presence of large polyps, or perforation of the anterior part of the septum. infectious rhinitis Viral infections are the most common cause of acute infectious rhinitis. these episodes can last up to 7\u201310 days and are usually self-limited. human rhinovirus (more than 100 serotypes) is the most common cause of acute infectious rhinitis. the presence of bacterial biofilms in adenoidal tissue or in sinonasal mucosa is suggested to be linked with chronic infections and inflammations of the nose and paranasal sinuses in adults. the presence of rhinitis does not rule out the co-existence of other types of rhinitis in these cases. watery rhinorrhoea (anterior or posterior), pruritus, and sneezing (especially paroxysmal) typically occur immediately after allergen exposure and may last for hours. red, itchy eyes suggestive of conjunctivitis of allergic origin, which strongly correlate with AR. nose is located strategically in the airway and functionally linked to paranasal sinuses, eyes, middle ears, pharynx, larynx, and lower airway. presenting features may be conjunctivitis, chronic cough, mouth breathing, nasal speech, snoring, pruritic mouth and throat, and/or pain of ears on pressure changes. inspection can give us additional clue to further support AR diagnosis. a transient eustachian tube obstruction was demonstrated after nasal challenge with aeroallergens. the pharynx may reveal a cobblestone appearance of the posterior pharyngeal wall and hyperplasia of tonsils and/or adenoids. the significance of different age peaks for several pathologies should not be underestimated. asthma classifies rhinitis by duration and severity according to the effect on quality of life. rhinitis can be classified as seasonal or perennial, based on the relevant allergen. rhinitis can be classified as seasonal or perennial, based on the relevant allergen. chronic rhinosinusitis is not causally related with allergic rhinitis in children. in paediatric population, secretions are often purulent or mucopurulent. symptoms may be bilateral but typically have a unilateral propensity. to make diagnosis of AR and start treatment based on history and physical examination, we need to take a step back to re-evaluate our data and reconsider our diagnosis. using a symptom-based and age-related approach as well as some further tests may be necessary."}
