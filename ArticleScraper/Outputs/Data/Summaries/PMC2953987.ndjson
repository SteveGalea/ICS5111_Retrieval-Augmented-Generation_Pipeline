{"summary": "CSTE electronically distributed a structured, self-administered questionnaire to state epidemiologists in all 50 states and Washington, DC. responses were made anonymous at the time of data analysis. 96% of states would notify CDC of suspected and probable cases of IHR 2005 conditions within 24 hours after diagnosis. of those unable to transmit daily notifications, 5 indicated they would be able to provide daily electronic data to CDC within 1 year. bable 0 1 (2) 0 0 2 Confirmed 0 0 1 (2) 1 Total 31 3 1 7 45 Time frame for notification Suspected 23 (51) 5 (11) 4 (9) 1 (2) 33 Probable 8 (18) 2 (4) 0 0 11 Total 32 7 4 1 45 Poliomyelitis, wild type Time frame for reporting Suspected 22 (49) 1 (2) 1 (2) 9 (20) 37 Probable 2 (4) 0 0 4 Confirmed 0 0 more than 50% of respondents reported having formal information-sharing systems or mechanisms pertaining to emergencies or outbreaks with state law enforcement, emergency management and homeland security, agriculture, environmental protection, and fish and wildlife agencies. most (>80%) states reported having 1 POC for reporting chemical, radiologic, foodborne, infectious, and zoonotic events. the ability to transmit reports to CDC is a critical function. not all respondents included unusual or unexpected events on their state\u2019s reportable conditions lists. most states have formal information-sharing systems with other agencies within their state. risk assessments of unusual or unexpected events should be performed to determine whether they meet requirements for notification to CDC as a potential PHEIC. Performing such risk assessments will enable timely notification to CDC, even before laboratory confirmation. state POCs are likely to facilitate recognition and reporting of potential public health emergencies within their respective states."}
