{"summary": "the introduction of highly effective direct acting antivirals (DAA) designed to inhibit the function of specific non-structural (NS) viral proteins critical to viral replication has resulted in high cure rates in most patients. however, the use of DAA is limited by the high cost (up to US$147,000 for 12-week treatment course) humans and chimpanzees who have been previously treated and cured of hepatitis C could be re-infected after re-exposure to the virus. there is some optimism that the development of a successful HCV vaccine might be possible because a proportion of infected individuals (15\u201325%) clear the virus naturally and develop some immunity that is able to reduce the duration of viremia. several studies involving VLP-based vaccine candidates have already generated promising results in preclinical studies. this article will review HCV vaccine strategies based on homologous or heterologous HCV VLPs (Table 1), plasmid DNA and viral vectors encoding HCV-VLPs (Table 2). NS3 (155 aa) Mice Mihailova et al., 2006 E. coli (K802 cells) Subcutaneous Core (60 aa) also HBV-S1 (27 aa) Mice Sominskaya et al., 2010 HBsAg Mammalian Huh-7, HEK293T Subcutaneous E2 HVR-1 (36 aa) Mice Netter et al., 2001, 2003; Vi VLP expression system Merits Demerits Bacteria Less expensive; simplicity of expression; fast growth rate; high-level expression; genetic stability; simple process scale-up Lack mammalian-like PTM; Poor ability on immunogenicity; Presence of host cell-derived contaminants Yeast Less expensive. self-assembled core-E1-E2 HCV-like particles (HCV-LPs) have been reported to generate HCV-VLPs with biophysical, ultrastructural and antigenic properties. immunogenicity of HCV-LPs is strongly dependent on particle formation because vaccination with heat-denatured particles resulted in reduced antigen-specific T-cell and antibody responses. ovirus-based system generated particles which resemble native virions morphologically. up to three doses of non-adjuvanted or traditional alum-adjuvanted HCV-LPs were essential to reach similar HCV-LP- and E2-specific antibody titers induced with a single dose of HCV-LP+E8Pam2Cys. the sera from immunized mice reduced binding of VLPs and the JFH1 strain of HCV to Huh-7 cells demonstrating the presence of NAbs. other studies have provided evidence that HCV-derived VLPs are a promising vaccine strategy, capable of eliciting HCV-specific humoral and cellular immunity. antigenic structure of the HVR1 region expressed on particles\u2019 surface closely resembled authentic structure. vaccination with a cocktail of HBsAg-S VLPs containing epitopes from either HCV-1a or -1b strains induced antibodies against both HVR1 epitopes that resulted in higher titers than those generated by immunization with the individual VLPs. the chimeric HBsAg-S/HCV antibodies showed increased cross-neutralization of various genotypes of heterologous HCV strains. these results confirm previous observations that the heterodimer is less immunogenic, possibly due to the conformational folding of E1 and E2 at the surface of the HBsAg particles. however, the structure of the E1E2 dimers on these particles might not be representative of dimers on the surface of native HCV virions insertion of foreign sequences into the HBc gene does not impede particle formation making HBc suitable for the development of a VLP vaccine displaying a foreign antigen. chimeric HBc/HCV VLPs carrying a virus-neutralizing HBV pre-S1 epitope and a highly conserved N-terminal HCV core epitope at the C terminus of the truncated HBc protein. pre-S1-HCV core epitopes were not exposed on the surface of the VLP. it was argued that the core epitopes located at the C terminus were not able to induce strong antibody responses to HCV core epitopes. inserting larger amino acid sequences within the HBc particles might affect the ability of the chimeric particles to drive insert-specific immune responses. infectious HCVpp are engineered by pseudotyping HCV glycoproteins onto murine leukemia virus-Gag retroviral core particles. these particles are also commonly used to detect and measure anti-HCV NAb in HCV patients. retrovirus-derived VLPs in heterologous prime-boost combination with plasmo-retroVLP raised NAbs against HCV genotype 1a. no challenge experiments were conducted to assess the anti-HCV potency of these HCV-retro VLPs. however, the use of animal retroviral particles has not been validated as a safe or effective preventative vaccine in humans. rVSV-HCV-VLPs can self-assemble into HCV VLPs (VSV-HCV-VLPs) in baby hamster kidney fibroblasts (BHK-21 cells) these VSV-HCV-VLPs showed similar ultrastructural properties to HCV virions. however, it was argued that these particles may represent the endogenous viruses of BHK-21 cells known as intracisternal R-type particles, rather than the complete budded HCV rVSV-ZEBOV encoding the Ebola virus glycoprotein provides hope for the development of a VLP-based HCV vaccine using this strategy. the protective immunity generated by rVSVs encoding HCV core, E1 and E2 also needs to be evaluated before these particles can be used. plasmo-retroVLPs were superior immunogens for boosting cellular and humoral immune responses in primed animals. a combination of two plasmo-retroVLPs vaccinations followed by a boost with ex vivo produced VLPs was shown to induce HCV-specific cell-mediated response and NAbs. plasmo-retroVLPs can be re-administered for sequential vaccinations without pre-existing vector- associated immunity. the delivery route and/or method of DNA-based vaccines is also a critical factor in determining vaccination outcome. plasmo-retroVLPs are a flexible platform to induce humoral and cellular immunity after homologous or heterologous prime-boost immunization. HCV-Derived VLPs Virus like particles are attractive candidates to elicit NAb responses as they structurally resemble. they are much safer than the wild-type virus from which they are derived. this approach has been used to develop a chikungunya virus vaccine. the immunogenicity of HCV-LPs is strongly dependent on particle formation. vaccination with heat-denatured particles resulted in reduced antigen-specific T-cell and antibody responses. adenovirus-derived HCV-LPs produced in mammalian cells. antigen-specific antibody secreting cells were also detected in the spleen of HCV-LP+E8Pam2Cys vaccinated mice. vaccination of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 transgenic mice with this vaccine generated higher HCV-LP-specific IFN-mediated responses compared to non-adjuvanted HCV-LPs. HBsAg-S particles have been designed as carriers of foreign epitopes inserted at the N-or C-terminus or into the external hydrophilic loop of the HBsAg-S. these epitopes were recognized by human anti-HCV-positive serum containing anti-HVR1-1b antibodies. vaccination with a cocktail of HBsAg-S VLPs containing epitopes from either HCV-1a or -1b strains induced the immunogenicity of the chimeric HBsAg VLPs expressing E1 and E2 proteins as separate immunogens was significantly reduced compared to the responses in rabbits immunized with HBsAg VLPs bearing an E1E2 heterodimer. this results confirm previous observations that the E1 and E2 heterodimer is less immunogenic, possibly due to the conformational folding of E1 and E2 at the surface of the HBsAg particles g-S/HCV VLP demonstrated that mice with pre-existing anti-HBsAg antibodies successfully generated anti-HCV antibodies. these chimeric particles can be used in populations with pre-existing immunity to HBV as a strategy to induce protective immunity to HCV. antibodies to core and NS3 are believed to have no prophylactic value. chimeric VLPs carrying a virus-neutralizing HBV pre-S1 epitope and a highly conserved N-terminal HCV core epitope have been successfully generated. a maximum of 90 aa of human immunodeficiency virus was reported to be tolerated. fusion of 317, 189, or 100 aa of the Gag protein downstream of aa 144 prevented self-assembly of the chimeric HBc particles. pseudoparticles described HCVpp and HCV-retro VLPs as regular 100 nm spherical structures comprised of the dense retroviral nucleocapsid surrounded by a lipid bilayer. boosting with the retrovirus-derived VLPs in a heterologous prime-boost combination with plasmo-retroVLP raised NAbs against HCV genotype 1a which cross-neutralized five other genotypes/strains rVSV is an effective expression vector in a number of different vaccine strategies. the virus has a low seroprevalence in the community and is not pathogenic in humans. the simple genome has only five genes (N, P, M, G, and L) and it does not undergo reassortment or integration. the expression of HCV E1 and E2 by replication-competent and -defective (G-protein-deleted) VSV vectors resulted in correctly folded E1/E2 heterodimers. immunization with rVSVG-C/E1/E2 protected mice against the formation of tumors expressing HCV E2 (CT26-hghE2t) the protective immunity generated by rVSVs encoding HCV core, E1 and E2 also needs to be evaluated before these particles can be used as a vaccine against HCV infection. plasmo-retroVLPs have been engineered to produce retroVLPs pseudotyped with E1 and E2 proteins after in vivo delivery of the DNA. plasmo-retroVLPs were shown to induce HCV-specific cell-mediated response and NAbs (Huret et al., 2013). plasmo-retroVLPs can be re-administered for sequential vaccinations without the concern of pre-existing vector- associated immunity (Bellier et al., 2009). DNA-based vaccines induce relatively weak immune responses to antigens. a recombinant multimeric papMV vaccine platform expressing a HCV-E2 peptide fused to the papMV CP was shown to trigger a strong humoral immune response in mice lasting more than 120 days against the CP and the E2 epitope. the same platform was less effective when inoculated as a monomeric protein, confirming that immunogenicity is strongly dependent on the repetitive organization of the antigen. bacteria (mainly E. coli), the baculovirus expression vector/insect cell system (BEVS/IC) and various mammalian cell lines. the production system used depends on the need to retain more consistent original VLP formation and post translational modifications. x HB\u00ae and Gardasil\u00ae (Merck and Co) are manufactured using this system. the entire HCV core protein expressed in methylotrophic P. pastoris formed particles with similar structural properties as the native mature HCV nucleocapsid particles. more recently VLPs produced in mammalian cells were found to be more immunogenic in a VLP prime/Rec-Ad-C-E1-E2 boost based heterologous strategy. the use of iodixanol ultracentrifugation and stirred cell ultrafiltration resulted in the production of large quantities of HCV VLPs from various genotypes. plant-derived VLPs offer a new approach for oral delivery of vaccines. infected plants successfully generated TMV particles expressing HVR1/CTB. the plant-derived HVR1/CTB reacted with anti-HRV1 monoclonal antibodies. inoculating mice with plant extract resulted in induction of anti-CTB and anti-HVR1 antibodies capable of specifically binding to HCV VLPs. the insect cell system can perform eukaryotic-type PTMs, support high expression levels of foreign proteins with the advantage of lacking mammalian pathogens. a major disadvantage of this system is contamination of the product with co-produced enveloped baculovirus particles. yeast is another well-established platform used for recombinant protein expression and VLP production. the entire HCV core protein expressed in methylotrophic P. pastoris formed particles with similar structural properties as the native mature HCV nucleocapsid particles. Various HCV VLPs vaccine candidates have been successfully produced in mammalian cells including Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), Huh-7cells, and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells. vaccination with recombinant HCV envelope glycoproteins produced in mammalian cells protected chimps more effectively compared to those produced in yeast or insect cells. plant expression systems are suitable for the production of both non-enveloped and enveloped VLPs. tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-derived vector encoding a HVR1peptide fused to the C-terminus of the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) infected plants successfully generated TMV particles expressing HVR1/CTB. the baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system has been widely used for VLP production. insect cells have been used to express several VLP-based vaccines. the system can perform eukaryotic-type PTMs. the purity, potency and consistency of the particles and elimination of host cell and culture media contaminants are crucial for downstream processing of VLP-based vaccines. the purification methods should be robust, cost-effective, scalable and preferably applicable to a wide variety of VLPs. no VLP-based HCV vaccines have progressed to human clinical trials. no VLP-based vaccines have progressed to human clinical trials. author Contributions MM conceived the initial draft of the manuscript. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
