{"summary": "MERS-CoV is comparable to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which killed almost 10% of the affected individuals in China between 2002 and 2003.2 The first MERS patient reported in Saudi Arabia in June 2012 was possibly infected by direct or indirect transmission of the virus from dromedary camels. graphic was generated based on MERS-CoV updates released on 7 July 2015 by world health organization. the analysis involved 14 complete MERS-CoV genomes selected from different countries. the tree was rooted using the Egyptian camel sequence as the most divergent. median age of patients in reported cases is 49 years. median age of patients in reported cases is 49 years. median age of patients in reported cases is 49 years. ike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins are all structural proteins. the accessory proteins, unique to this lineage of viruses, are encoded by ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, ORF5 and ORF8b. some recent studies have shown that they may have an important role in evading the host immune response. stable No No ORF8b AJD81448 28 718 29 056 112 12.2 Unstable No No Abbreviations: aa, amino acid; MW, molecular weight; nt, nucleotide; ORF, open reading frame; PL, papain like. signalP is used to predict the presence of SPs in the proteins. a population-based seroepidemiologic study suggests that the seroprevalence of the virus was several folds higher in people exposed to camels compared with that in the general population. no seroreactivities were reported in the blood samples obtained from blood donors and abattoir workers in Saudi Arabia during 2012. rion interacts with functional receptor DPP4 to facilitate viral entry into the host. 31 MERS-CoV binds to DPP4 through a receptor-binding domain (RBD) located in the S1 subunit. protease cleavage leads to virus\u2013cell fusion and release of genomic RNA into the host cytoplasm. adenylate uridylate (AU)-rich sequences called transcription regulation sequences (TRSs) are encapsidated in the nucleocapsid (N) proteins in the cytoplasm and then transported to the ER\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) for further assembly. a full-length template RNA of genomic length for replication will be synthesized. the proteins involved in replication and transcription (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and helicase encoded by ORF1ab) form replication-transcription complexes. these complexes assemble at the perinuclear regions and associate with double-membrane vesicles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum. receptors including toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) have an essential role in innate immunity. -CoV RBD comprises a -sheet with one small and three large strands organized in an antiparallel manner. it is attached to the core subdomain like a clamp at the upper and lower positions. the fourth disulfide bond is formed between the 3-helix and the 6-strand. the vaccinated mouse was infected with MERS-CoV and transduced with hDPP4 to prove its efficacy. a subunit vaccine (Venezuelan equine encephalitis replicon particles that express MERS-CoV S protein) and an anti-viral drug (poly-I:C) were evaluated. this mouse model can be developed in a period of 2\u20133 weeks. however, this transduction system regulates hDPP4 expression to a low level and limits the expression to the lungs. both proteases cleave pp1a and pp1ab at several locations. a dual non-covalent inhibitor for MERS-CoV PLpro and SARS-CoV PLpro was identified in a high-throughput screening of 25 000 compounds. the currently available crystal structures and the results of mutational studies on MERS-CoV PLpro will aid in developing new inhibitors. accessory proteins do not participate in the structure of MERS-CoV particles. they are difficult to study because of their low expression level as well as their low molecular weight. the dsRNA binds to the RNA-binding domain and induces a conformational change in RIG-I. the caspase activation and recruitment domain initiates the downstream signaling. downstream signaling involves the activation of IRF3, which is phosphorylated and forms a homodimer. the RBD of the MERS-CoV S1 subunit ranges from residues 367 to 606. the receptor-binding motif (V484 to L567) of RBD is located in the external subdomain. the core subdomain contains a five-stranded antiparallel -sheet in the center. two antibodies were tested on a mouse model that was developed by substituting mouse DPP4 ORF with human DPP4 (hDPP4) ORF, assuring normal physiological expression of hDPP4. a previously developed animal model was effective but expressed hDPP4 in all types of cells, resulting in non-physiological expression. a humanized monoclonal antibody against mAb YS110 has also been reported to inhibit MERS-CoV infection in vitro. a mouse model was developed by transducing a mouse with non-replicating adenovirus that expresses hDPP4.51. a subunit vaccine (Venezuelan equine encephalitis replicon particles that express MERS-CoV S protein) and an anti-viral drug ( the crystal structure of the MERS-CoV PLpro bound to ubiquitin revealed the interacting amino acids in the active site of PLpro. eight different PLpro residues (Arg1649, Thr1653, Ala1656, Asn1673, Val1674, Val1691, Val1706 and Gln1708) were mutated. the irreversible compounds with a Michael acceptor group prevent the dimerization of 3CLpro in a time-dependent manner. the current knowledge of key conserved and non-conserved residues is valuable. the knowledge of interacting residues from the cocrystallized compounds will enable the development of 3CLpro inhibitors that are relatively more effective. type 1 IFNs and inflammatory cytokines are produced as a result of the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by TLRs or RIG-I-like helicases. protein 4a blocks IFN induction and works as a strong inhibitor of type 1 IFN by inhibiting dsRNA recognition. the RNA-binding domain of 4a binds dsRNA and does not allow it to bind to the RNA-binding domain of RIG-I, thereby inhibiting the anti-viral signaling pathway. the virus blocks the innate immune response and continues infecting cells. in vitro studies have a major role to confirm the initial anti-viral findings. several cell lines and their suitability for MERS-CoV transfection were reported. despite the research efforts undertaken so far, the exact intermediate host for MERS-CoV and spatial distribution are still not well known. the proteins involved in MERS-CoV entry and replication are attractive targets for the development of anti-viral therapeutics. if this initiative cannot be taken by profit-pursuing companies, it must be carried forward by governments of developed countries or by philanthropic scientists."}
