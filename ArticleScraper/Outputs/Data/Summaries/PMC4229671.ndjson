{"summary": "four-week-old wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 (abbreviated B6) mice and 4-week-old ACE2 knockout mice (B6 background, a gift from Professor Josef M. Penninger) were housed in the animal facility in accordance with institutional guidelines. experimental mouse models of acute lung injury The influenza A H7N9 virus (A/Hebei/01/2013, abbreviated Hb01/H7N9) used in this study was isolated from a confirmed H angiotensin II levels and western blotting Ang II levels were detected. rats polyclonal anti-ACE2 antibodies (R&D Systems) were used for western blotting. viral titers were measured in mouse lung homogenates from ACE2 KO or WT mice on day 5 post-infection. samples were added to 96-well plates containing MDCK cells, then diluted 10-fold. data were expressed as log10 TCID50/g of lung tissue. genome sequences of Hb01/H7N9 are available in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database under the accession numbers EPI509120\u2013EPI509127. live virus experiments were performed in Biosafety Level 3 facilities. quantitative real-time PCR RNA was extracted from the lungs of 4-week-old B6 mice infected with 2 103.5 TCID50 virus. titers were measured in supernatants of mouse lung homogenates from ACE2 KO or WT mice on day 5 post-infection. two research groups cloned the ACE homolog ACE2 independently in 200023. ACE2 negatively regulates RAS by inactivating Ang II24. Hb01/H7N9 virus infection increased Ang II levels in plasma (Figure 1B) of WT mice (p 0.01). ACE2 protein expression was downregulated in WT mice following influenza A (H7N9) virus infection. a significant increase in plasma Ang II levels was observed in influenza A (H7N9) virus-infected patients. ACE2 deficiency increased the severity of H7N9-induced lung injury. ACE2 KO mice that were infected with influenza Hb01/H7N9 virus exhibited survival rates that were reduced significantly compared with WT mice. ACE2 could mediate or protect mice from 2013 influenza infection-induced ALI. wet-to-dry ratio of lungs from WT B6 and ACE2 KO mice (n = 8) at day 5 post-infection. ang II receptor AT1 affects the severity of H7N9-induced lung injury significantly in WT mice. NP RNA expression was quantified using real-time PCR. NP mRNA expression was normalized to GAPDH (n = 10) ACE2 KO mice were treated with AT1 receptor blockers. ACE2 might play a crucial role in influenza A virus infection-induced ALI. schematic diagrams of the RAS in influenza A (H7N9) virus-induced ALI have been proposed. these data suggest that the novel influenza H7N9 virus causes severe ALI in a experimental mouse model at least in part by altering the RAS via ACE2 expression that targets AT1. ACE2 plays a critical role in 2013 influenza H7N9 virus-induced ALI. ang II levels in healthy and H7N9 virus-infected patients were measured using enzyme immunoassays. plasma Ang II levels decreased sharply from early to late phase of influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in the recovered population. ACE2 deficiency increased severity of influenza A (H7N9) virus infection. ACE2 deficiency increased severity of H7N9-infected mice. ACE2 KO mice that were infected with influenza Hb01/H7N9 virus showed survival rates that were reduced significantly compared with WT mice. survival rate of ACE2 mice was 20%, whereas no KO mice survived for at least 9 days after influenza Hb01/H7N9 virus infection. lung edema, defined by the wet-to-dry weight ratio, was much more severe in ACE2 KO mice. the Ang II receptor AT1 affects the severity of influenza Hb01/H7N9 virus-induced lung injury significantly in WT mice. the NP copy number and viral titers were decreased significantly in the lungs of H7N9 virus-infected WT mice treated with AT1 receptor blockers. NP RNA expression was quantified using real-time PCR. NP expression was normalized to GAPDH (n = 10) ACE2 KO mice were treated with AT1 receptor blockers. ACE2 might play a crucial role in influenza A virus infection-induced ALI via the AT1 receptor. ACE2 KO mice treated with PBS control or AT1 inhibitor at day 5 post-infection. NP mRNA expression was assessed using real-time PCR. ARDS is most severe stage of ALI during pathogenic infections25. a significantly larger cohort of H7N9-infected individuals is required to confirm these observations. the current findings provide a molecular explanation for these causes of death and the mechanism of ALI in patients infected with influenza A (H7N9) influenza.
