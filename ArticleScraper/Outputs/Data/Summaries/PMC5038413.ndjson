{"summary": "study All surviving members of the 2012 outbreak in Jordan, their exposed contacts, and their household members who were identified serologically as either MERS-CoV positive or indeterminate were asked to consent to further participation. participants were asked to provide a follow-up serologic specimen so we could compare 34-month results with 13-month results. a nurse who worked in an intensive care unit (participant 06) cared for confirmed case-patients during the outbreak was the only participant for whom ELISA indicated a consistent titer of 1,600 at both times. symptomatic but refused hospitalization. only 2 (29%) had any decrease in neutralizing antibody titers over time. one participant had no detectable neutralizing antibodies. surviving participants consented to further testing. patients reported here had respiratory symptoms, were relatively young, and had few underlying medical conditions. any association between our MERS-CoV antibody results and clinical severity is therefore difficult to assess. each remained positive by microneutralization (>20) 34 months after the outbreak."}
