{"summary": "mutational viral escape by loss of affinity to the drug may induce (synthetic) lethality. mutational viral escape by loss of affinity to the drug may induce (synthetic) lethality. zanamivir is a broad inhibitor of neuraminidase, an influenza glycoprotein. zanamivir is a broad inhibitor of neuraminidase, probably because it interacts with invariant amino acids inside the enzyme active site. zanamivir is a broad inhibitor of neuraminidase, an influenza glycoprotein. invariant positions are too few to constitute a proper docking site for a drug. we propose to also target synthetic lethals (SL), or co-lethals. SL is the lethality resulting when two, individually survivable, mutations are co-present. a set of positions containing invariant amino acids plus an SL set may be large enough a target for putative antiviral drugs. we first aligned 24,155 amino acid sequences of the HIV-1 protease. this protein has more than 60% of variant positions. we wanted to create a tool that is robust enough to be used on other RNA virus databases that are less documented than HIV. these 24,155 sequences were aligned. from this alignment, we found 25 positions that display changes in less than 0,3% of the sequences. we named \"total SLs\" the graph made of 70 nodes representing the 70 protease positions. 290 edges representing the 290 relations \"is co-lethal with\" linking the synthetic lethal positions. three other teams have used different methods to identify couples of HIV protease. the four orange, boxed amino acids (N37, P39, K41, D60) are the locked targets called SG canti. the three red, boxed amino acids (H69, K70, I72) are the locked targets called SG canti. the two yellow, boxed amino acids (L10, T12) are the locked targets called SG fulc. rum. no subgraph is part of the catalytic site [28]. the 4 clusters we identified can now be complemented by their neighboring, accessible, invariants. to compromise viral escape, it should dock on an invariant position or on an SL set. so we added all the invariant positions that are accessible and close, to the 4 locked sets. the connectivity coefficient is increased from CSG-flap = 0.5 to C'SGI-flap = 0.71. SG-flap has 3 invariant amino acids, out of which 2 are within 10 Angstr\u00f6m of each other. the whole set is an interesting result since its amino acids are all accessible. 3D representation of the HIV-1 homodimer (1HSG) protease. mutation in position 40 provokes a total loss of the protease activity. mutants in positions 37 and 39 show a 75% drop vs. wild type. we identify a cluster of 5 amino acids with a connectivity coefficient of C'SGI-fulc = 0.8, which are all close and amongst which at most two may freely mutate. position 10 can have a secondary mutation conferring resistance [33] and that mutations in position 12 occur more often in treated patients than in drug-naive patients [34] we analyzed 24,155 protease amino acid sequences of HIV-1 subtype B. a patient can get a viral sequence - possibly highly mutated - from a treated patient. we wanted to create a tool that is robust enough to be used on other RNA virus databases. 290 synthetic lethal couples were identified using a 0.5% False Discovery Rate (FDR) threshold. these 290 couples span 70 protease positions out of the 74. the 4 remaining positions are not represented in these couples. the graph was built with Graphviz software. from the \"spatially close SLs\" graph, we selected the solvent accessible positions. each oval contains the amino acid (one-letter codename) found in the HIV-1 protease ancestral sequence. the names were given retrospectively, as reminders of 3 specific regions of the protease 3D structure. SG-flap includes positions found in the protease cantilever. and all positions of SG-fulc are in the protease fulcrum. the locked target represented subgraph \"a\" is called SGI flap (orange+green) the locked target represented subgraph \"b\" is called SGI canti (red+green) the locked target represented subgraph \"b\" is called SGI flap (yellow+green) the graph was built using the Graphviz software. mutants in positions 37 and 39 show a 75% drop in the protease activity vs. wild type. double mutants in positions 37 and 39 show a 75% drop vs. wild type. the cantilever and fulcrum A look at SG-fulc yield complementary target recommendations. on SG-fulc, amino acid L10 is interesting because it is linked to the 3 other SLs (T12, K14, L19) as well as to invariant E21. the latter is close to all SG-fulc positions. three out of five positions in SGI-fulc are in the pocket of one of the 10 sites defined by Q-siteFinder. a molecule drug-designed to bind the external loop of the protease flaps could block their mobility, thus keeping the protease from processing its substrate. this idea was developed by Perryman et al. using molecular dynamics [37]. the results are a smaller graph, equal to Figure 2 subgraphs SG-canti and SG-fulc plus 2 amino acids. we believe both approaches are complementary and support each other, as mutual controls. in the case of HIV-1, they are three main branches are groups M, N and O. our method treats variation in all positions as bi-allelic (mutated versus non-mutated genotype) it would seem more informative to take into account the actual amino-acid changes. this would entail choosing a score matrix so as to decide whether the mutated one is similar to the initial one. but the mutations involved in the resistance to anti-protease drugs do not follow the same rules. these are what we call locked targets: spatially close, accessible viral invariant positions and/or potential synthetic lethals (SLs are groups of survivable mutations which are lethal whenever any two co-occur) these targets are unique in that they might minimize or prevent viral escape. pol gene codes for three proteins: the protease, the reverse transcriptase (RT) and the integrase, containing respectively 99, 560 and 288 amino acids. we then pooled all of the amino acid sequences, whole or partial, of subtype B HIV-1 Pol from three databases. we obtained one set of 24,155 protease sequences. the most frequent sequence was represented 257 times. a reference sequence was used to label positions as \"mutated\" and \"wild type\" each position mutated vis-\u00e0-vis the reference was recoded as 0. the same process was iterated for the second position, and so on until the end of the sequence. the same process was iterated for the second position, and so on until the end of the sequence. the associated p-values were calculated for each of the couples of positions. the couples will be called SLs in the following, keeping in mind that they should be called \"potential SLs\". the graph we designed for this study has one node for each protease amino acid position. the graph's edges bear the relation \"is co-lethal with\" the graph's edges bear the relation \"is co-lethal with\" a set of positions containing invariant amino acids plus an SL set may be large enough a target for putative antiviral drugs. we call all these most conserved positions \"locked\" because they \"can't escape\" by freely mutating. pol gene codes for three proteins: the protease, the reverse transcriptase (RT) and the integrase. resulting alignment was used to create a new accurate profile for the alignment of small sequences. from the initial 70,000 set, we collected the partial sequences of 10 amino acids or more that had neither C-terminal nor N-terminal motif. from this final alignment, we removed the 5 sequences that showed insertions. the first position was compared to the first position of the reference sequence. each position mutated vis-\u00e0-vis the reference was recoded as 0 and conserved one as 1. the same process was iterated for the second position, and so on until the end of the sequence. in the null hypothesis that both positions are independent, we performed a one-degree-of-freedom 2 test. using those 4 numbers, we performed 2,701 times, a one-degree-of-freedom 2 test. we computed the false discovery rate (FDR) associated to the different p-values. the positions of these couples are therefore all statistically dependent in pairs. a graph we designed for this study has one node for each protease amino acid position. the graph's edges bear the relation \"is co-lethal with\" the graph's edges bear the relation \"is co-lethal with\" the graph's edges bear the relation \"is co-lethal with\" a set of positions containing invariant amino acids plus an SL set may be large enough a target for putative antiviral drugs. we call all these most conserved positions \"locked\" because they \"can't escape\" by freely mutating. authors have a financial interest in patent application. the authors present their reasons for including all the data, except for incomplete and suspected-erroneous sequences. the authors present their reasons for including all the data, except for incomplete and suspected-erroneous sequences. the same three locked targets were found, but with fewer positions. reviewer's comment We believe there is no formula to compute the minimum number of sequences necessary to determine all the SL couples of any given protein. the Chi2 test imposes a theoretical count in each of the 4 cells of the contingency table greater than 5. the number of SL couples is of course initially unknown. authors' response We read your suggestion with interest. but it appears impossible to execute the described experiments due to the number of sequences in our dataset (24151 sequences) the idea of limiting the phylogenetic study to selected clusters is interesting. authors' response We do not state that a single mutation at the SL cluster is always insufficient for an efficient escape. but we state that if several mutations appear in a cluster, this combination is lethal. this result can be explained by a very moderate fitness loss rather than lethality. authors suggest novel approach to developing drugs that HIV could not easily evolve resistance to: drugs that target multiple sites, all of which cannot jointly mutate. authors then identify sets of mutations that might be suitable drug targets. authors are very forthcoming with the weaknesses of the study. three out of five positions in SGI-fulc (12, 14, 19) are in the pocket of one of the 10 sites defined by q-site (39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62) reviewer's comment I have one major concern with the definition of synthetic lethals, though. phylogenetic relationships can produce apparent non-independence of sites. authors use concept of co-lethality of mutations to identify possible drug targets in HIV. authors use concept of co-lethality of mutations to identify possible drug targets in HIV. the authors identify them on the basis of a test of association. the null hypothesis in this test is that the frequency with which both sites are mutated is the product of the frequencies with which individual sites are mutated. the method in the present paper does not control for the effect of evolutionary history. authors' response We used a dataset of non-redundant protease sequences to determine the SL sets and their deduced locked targets. the same three locked targets were found, but with fewer positions. the corresponding SGI-flap was constituted by the same positions except position 37. manuscript on molecular evolution and structural analysis of the HIV protease. aim of study is to use co-evolution of amino acid pairs for proposing drug binding sites immune to mutational escape. approach based on contingency table analysis ignores phylogenetic structure of the dataset. reviewer's comment It is unclear why does the method treat variation in all positions as bi-allelic (mutated or non-mutated genotype) it is possible that taking into account actual amino acid types would be more informative. reviewer's comment The manuscript would benefit from the clarification of the main hypothesis. authors' response To determine whether a situation is of \u00ab very moderate fitness \u00bb or \"lethality,\" one must examine the p-value associated to the chi2 test. the lower the p-value, the lower the fitness, the closer the situation is to lethality. authors suggest a novel approach to developing drugs that HIV could not easily evolve resistance to. authors are very forthcoming with the weaknesses of the study. they do not oversell their results. the authors identify them on the basis of a test of association. authors' response The claim is that chi2 testing on large samples detects the smallest dependency. but since we check the False Discovery Rate, we can determine the validities of the chi2 tests. reviewer's comment It seems that a better way to define synthetic lethals is to search for pairs of sites that never mutate together. by definition, both mutations cannot be part of the same sub-tree since their co-presence is lethal. the tree resulting from this situation is impossible to analyze, since one should analyze all the sub-trees in order to find the missing branches. the data set is too large to control for phylogeny. it doesn't alter the fact that the data set is likely confounded by phylogeny. this work was done for Lou, 5 years old."}
