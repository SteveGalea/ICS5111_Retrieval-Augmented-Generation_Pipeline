{"summary": "pattern recognition molecules/pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) are classified into three families: toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and nucleotide binding-oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) are classified into three families: toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation associated gene TLR3 activates NF-B, an important transcription factor for IFN-, and IFN production is induced. TLR4 agonists activate NF-B and induce IFN production. chemokines, cytokines, interleukin-1, IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF) are also produced. these molecules promote chemotaxis of the resident DCs toward virus-infected and dead cells. HTLV-1 infects CD4+ T lymphocytes, CD8+ T lymphocytes, DCs, B cells, macrophages, and astrocytes, and preferentially replicates in CD4+ T lymphocytes. HTLV-1 causes latent infection as a provirus, whose genome is integrated into the host DNA. HTLV-1 basic leucine-zipper factor (HBZ) protein suppresses tax-mediated transcription activation of the viral LTR. p30 also contributes to the expression of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9. p30 downregulates the expression of both TLR2 and TLR4 because it binds to PU.1. class I and the IL-2 receptor suppress linker for activation of T cells. HTLV-1 causes proliferation of infected cells rather than virus. HIV preferentially replicates in activated T lymphocytes and activated macrophages. MM promotes proteasome-dependent degradation of the complex. RNA40 activates pDCs, mDCs, T lymphocytes, and monocytes. IL-8 also contributes to the propagation of the virus via the accumulation of T lymphocytes. cosuppressive molecules, such as B7-H1 on DCs and PD1 on T lymphocytes, are upregulated in patients with HIV. in addition, HIV is thought to induce regulatory T cells. NS5A protein suppresses activation of IRAK-1 through its interaction with MyD88. this leads to the shutting off of TLR7 and TLR8 signaling, and to the suppression of maturation and differentiation of pDCs. infected DCs are thought to affect the production of TNF-, TNF- signal transduction, and chemotaxsis. the HA protein of wild virus strain induces cytokines such as IL-1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12 via the TLR2 signaling pathway. interaction of the HA protein with SLAM suppresses TLR4-mediated IL-12 production, but not IL-6 and TNF- production. but IL-12 production mediated by other TLR signaling pathways is unaffected by the HA protein. monocytic cell lines infected with measles virus show constitutive activation of NF-B and proinflammatory cytokine production. monocytic cells infected with measles virus show constitutive activation of NF-B and constitutively high levels of IL-8 production. ubiquitin-modifying enzyme A20 is upregulated in monocytic cells, but not in infected epithelial cells. NS1 protein of type A influenza viruses suppresses innate immune system signaling activated by the PAMPs, via TLR3, TLR4, RIG-I, and MDA5 system. suppression should contribute to efficient replication of infected virus in respiratory epithelial. the viral M2-1 protein inhibits the translocation of RelA to the cell nucleus. NS1 and NS2 proteins have little effect on NF-B or AP-1 activation. HTLV-1 causes latent infection as a provirus. HTLV-1 basic leucine-zipper factor (HBZ) protein suppresses tax-mediated transcription activation of the viral LTR. p30 also contributes to the expression of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9. p30 downregulates the expression of both TLR2 and TLR4 because it binds to PU.1. viral p12 protein suppresses cell surface expression of MHC class I and IL-2 receptor. also suppresses linker for activation of T cells (LAT) HTLV-1 causes proliferation of infected cells rather than virus and suppression of host immune responses. the Vif protein of HIV converts LMM to HMM. the protein promotes proteasome-dependent degradation of the complex. the complex inhibits proteasome-dependent degradation of the complex. strategies contribute to the suppression of HIV proliferation in the lymph nodes. cosuppressive molecules, such as B7-H1 on DCs and PD1 on T lymphocytes, are upregulated in patients with HIV. the virus does not replicate efficiently in these cell types. the NS5A protein suppresses activation of IRAK-1 through its interaction with MyD88. this leads to the shutting off of TLR7 and TLR8 signaling, and to the suppression of maturation and differentiation of pDCs. NF5A suppresses TRAF2 dependent NF-B activation via interaction with NF5A and TRAF2. the HA protein of wild virus strain induces cytokines such as IL-1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12 via the TLR2 signaling pathway. interaction of the HA protein with SLAM suppresses IL-12 production, but not IL-6 and TNF- production. however, IL-12 production mediated by other TLR signaling pathways is unaffected by the HA protein. monocytic cell lines infected with measles virus show constitutive activation of NF-B and proinflammatory cytokine production. monocytic cells infected with measles virus show constitutive activation of NF-B and constitutively high levels of IL-8 production. ubiquitin-modifying enzyme A20 is upregulated in monocytic cells, but not in infected epithelial cells. the NS1 protein of type A influenza viruses suppresses innate immune system signaling activated by the PAMPs, via TLR3, TLR4, RIG-I, and MDA5 system. the mechanism of suppression is mainly via inhibition of IRF-3 phosphorylation [43], leading to suppressed induction of IFN-/, and IFN-1, 2, and 3. the viral M2-1 protein inhibits the translocation of RelA to the cell nucleus. NS1 and NS2 proteins have little effect on NF-B or AP-1 activation. other viral proteins disturb the intracellular signal transduction systems. Vaccinia virus suppresses proinflammatory cytokines, but also induces production of an immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. cytokines produced enhance both sensitivity to LPS and production of TNF-. TNF- suppresses formation and maturation of virus particles. HCMV modulates NF-B activity during the various stages of infection. NF-B then contributes to the induction of proinflammatory cytokines. NF-B mediates upregulation of the host serine/threonine protein kinase. the attachment of EBV to receptor CD21 and the interaction of the virus glycoprotein gp350-gp250 with TLR2 activate NF-B. the virus gB and gH proteins are also candidates for TLR2 ligands. Vaccinia Virus Orthopox viruses produce proteins that mimic cytokine receptors, such as those for IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, IL-1, IL-18, and TNF-. other viral proteins disturb the intracellular signal transduction systems. adenovirus particles induce the production of RANTES, IP-10, and MIP-1. the cytokines produced enhance both sensitivity to LPS and the production of TNF-. TNF- suppresses the formation and maturation of virus particles. the viral US28 protein constitutively activates both NF-B and phospholipase C signaling pathways. the activated NF-B mediates upregulation of the host serine/threonine protein kinase, receptor-interacting protein-like apoptosis regulatory protein kinase (RICK) TLR2 signaling suppresses the transcription of the TLR9 gene via activation of NF-B containing p65 protein. downregulation of TLR9 and upregulation of TLR7 and MyD88 are observed in EBV-infected cells. the immunomodulators should not generate resistant virus to drugs compared to antiviral drugs targeting viral proteins. imiquimod, which is a TLR7 agonist, have been applied to an infectious disease caused by human papilloma virus, condylomata acuminata. polymorphisms have been found to contribute to dysregulation of TLR signaling. the dysregulation has been suggested to be linked with a number of disease sensitivity and condition depending on individual differences."}
