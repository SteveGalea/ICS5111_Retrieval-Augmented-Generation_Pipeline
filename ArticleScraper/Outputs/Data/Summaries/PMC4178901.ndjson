{"summary": "PRRSV is characterized by an acute viral infection that leads to respiratory problems in growing pigs and reproductive failure in sows. in china, a highly pathogenic strain of PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) was isolated and identified in 2006. a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 mediates human CD163 downregulation and production of the soluble form of CD163 (17\u201319) the list of cell surface proteins known to be cleaved by ADAM17 is still growing, and most of its substrates play important roles in modulating inflammation. the metalloprotease ADAM17 regulates PRRSV entry by modifying the expression of membrane CD163. these data provide direct evidence that the metalloprotease ADAM17 regulates PRRSV entry by modifying the expression of membrane CD163. monolayer washed twice with PBS, fixed in 33.3% acetone for 30 min. cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-PRRSV N protein monoclonal antibody (MAb) SDOW17 (Rural Technologies, USA) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Marc-145 or BHK-21 cells were transfected with 2 g of target plasmid pCAGGS/ADAM17, pCAGGS/CD163 and vector control pCAGGS using X-tremeGENE transfection reagent (Roche) at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were inoculated with PRRSV HuN4 at an MOI of 0.1. metalloprotease ADAM17 inhibition assay. used batimastat (BB94; Sigma-Aldrich, MO) as a metalloprotease ADAM17 inhibitor. cytotoxicity effect of BB94 was determined by trypan blue staining. Marc-145 cells were grown to 60% confluence in an antibiotic-free growth medium. they were transfected with siRNA duplexes (ON-TARGET-plus SMARTpoolsiRNA oligonucleotides; Sigma-Aldrich) Membranes were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 60 min. then incubated with a primary antibody for 60 min. membranes were then washed three times with PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20. 10,000 labeled cells were stained with SDOW17-F. all samples were analyzed using FlowJo 8.7 (Tree Star) and FACS Diva. quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) the animal experiment was approved by the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute. all cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. the type II PRRSV strain HuN4 was grown and titrated in Marc-145 cells. Marc-145 or BHK-21 cells cultured in a 6-well-plate until 90% confluence were inoculated with PRRSV HuN4 at an MOI of 0.1. after 60 min of incubation, cell monolayers were washed and then overlaid with an equivalent volume of 2 DMEM containing 10% FBS and 3.0% low-melting-temperature agarose. when plaques had fully developed, the plates were stained with crystal violet (5% [wt/ the cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, Nantong, China) for Western blot analysis of the expression of ADAM17 or CD163. the cytotoxicity effect of BB94 was determined by trypan blue staining with three replicates for each inhibitor concentration (2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 M). PRRSV infection was examined by IFA and plaque assay. cells were preincubated with BB94 for 24 h and then transfected with pCAGGS/CD163. at 24 h postinoculation, the infection was detected by IFA. cell lysates were prepared and assayed for specific gene silencing by real-time PCR and Western blotting. at 24 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and assayed. anti-actin MAb (C4) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. mice anti-pig CD163 and anti-pig CD169 MAbs were purchased from Rural Technologies. quantitative RT-PCRs were conducted in triplicate using SYBR premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa) and 10 M concentrations of specific primers (Table 1). CT values were normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA (GAPDH; internal standard), and the CT was determined by the formula CT = CT (ADM17) CT (siRNAControl). the intracellular effect of BB94 was examined by adding BB94 to Marc-145 cells after PRRSV incubation. BB94 did not modify PRRSV replication in comparison to the mock control. a proteolytic cleavage event, most likely ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding, regulates the expression level of cellular surface protein-like receptor(s) Marc-145 cells were treated with 2 M metalloprotease inhibitor BB94 for 24 h before inoculation. monolayers were stained with crystal violet at 3 days postinoculation. the cells were counted in three independent experiments. pCAGGS vector control suggests that PRRSV entry is suppressed by constitutively activated ADAM17. we also confirmed the overexpression of ADAM17 in Marc-145 cells. the number of PRRSV-positive cells was decreased by ADAM17 overexpression. 145 cells were transfected with 2#-siRNA duplexes or control siRNA at 100 nM for 24 h before they were inoculated with PRRSV HuN4. at 24 h postinoculation, the cell monolayer was fixed and the number of PRRSV-positive cells was determined by FITC-conjugated MAb SDOW17. each value represents the mean the SD of three separate experiments. metalloprotease ADAM17 suppresses PRRSV entry. CD163 has been identified as a possible cellular receptor for PRRSV. researchers recently showed that ADAM17 is required for the induction of CD163 ectodomain shedding in human cells. the concentration of siRNA duplexes was 25 nM (C) and 100 nM (D) the x-axis = log10 fluorescence was determined by using the appropriate isotype negative-control antibodies. the effect of ADAM17 overexpression on CD163 downregulation was examined. the metalloprotease ADAM17 reduces PRRSV entry in PAMs. detergent lysates collected from PAMs and 293T cells were directly subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with rabbit anti-ADAM17 polyclonal antibody. porcine CD163 has putative cleavage sites that are similar to those in the juxtamembrane region of human CD163. we treated PAMs with the ADAM17 inhibitor BB94 before inoculation with PRRSV HuN4. the percentage of PRRSV-infected PAMs was increased by BB94 treatment. downregulation of CD163 by ADAM17 is critical for PRRSV entry. expression of porcine CD163 alone in a PRRSV nonpermissive cell confers susceptibility to PRRSV infection (7). BHK-21 cells were transfected with pCAGGS/CD163 or vector for 24 h. cell lysates were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE before immunoblotting. no significant toxicity was evident for any of the three types of cells at BB94 concentrations 10 M. the metalloprotease inhibitor BB94 significantly increased the production of PRRSV progeny. 86.07 2.15 76.00 5.69 DMSO 100 100 100 93.60 2.33 86.63 0.90 BHK-21 BB94 97.73 0.25 97.07 0.93 97.37 1.07 89.63 1.05 82.83 1.42 DMSO 98.23 0.96 98.30 0.56 98.93 0.73 95.43 1.07 93.20 1.04 FIG 1. we examined the effect of ADAM17 on PRRSV HuN4 entry by transient-overexpression assay. the number of PRRSV-positive cells was lower in Marc-145 cells transfected with pCAGGS/ADAM17 than in the pCAGGS vector control. we also confirmed the overexpression of ADAM17 in Marc-145 cells. specific siRNA duplexes at 100 nM were >60%, as indicated by the relative levels of ADAM17 mRNA to GAPDH mRNA. detergent lysate from ADAM17-specific siRNA transfected Marc-145 cells was subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies to ADAM17 or -actin. the number of cells infected with PRRSV was significantly greater in the ADAM17-sepecific siRNA transfection group than in the control siRNA group (P 0.05) the metalloprotease ADAM17 suppresses PRRSV entry, suggesting that ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding of its putative substrate(s) might be involved in this regulatory mechanism. Marc-145 cells were transfected with 1# and 2# ADAM17-specific siRNA duplexes for 24 h. flow cytometry assay was used to detect cellular surface expression of CD163. the concentration of siRNA duplexes was 25 nM (C) and 100 nM (D) ADAM17 is expressed on PAMs and leads to alteration of PRRSV entry. CD163 is a putative PRRSV receptor on PAMs. a specific ADAM17 protein band was detected from the detergent lysate collected from PAMs and also from 293T cells. flow cytometry was used to quantify the expression levels of CD169 on PAMs. we treated PAMs with the ADAM17 inhibitor BB94 before inoculation with PRRSV HuN4. this suggests that ADAM17 is involved in PRRSV entry in PAMs. putative cleavage sites similar to those in the juxtamembrane region of human CD163 may be cleaved by ADAM17 at the same location. the activity of ADAM17 on PAMs is stimulated upon PRRSV infection and that such activity results in the downregulation of its putative substrate CD163. expression level of CD163 in transfected cells was significantly increased by BB94 treatment. bHK-21 cells were transfected with pCAGGS/CD163 or vector control for 24 h in the presence of BB94 or DMSO. expression level of CD163 on the surface of BHK-21 cells was assessed by flow cytometry. ectodomain shedding by different cells plays a critical role in numerous human diseases, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and inflammation. in the present study, we report that the metalloprotease ADAM17 helps regulate PRRSV entry in vitro. we also report that ADAM17 downregulates the expression level of membrane CD163 from the surface of PRRSV permissive cells such as Marc-145 and PAM. overexpression of ADAM17 decreased the number of PRRSV-infected cells. in the second approach, specific siRNAs were used to knock down ADAM17 expression. ADAM17 is also involved in resistance to PRRSV entry. cleavage produces soluble CD163 (sCD163) (16\u201318) cleavage is species-specific because the CD163 juxtamembrane region in certain nonprimates lacks the substrate motif (1044Arg-Ser-Ser-Arg) this suggests that the cleavage of porcine CD163 by ADAM17 might be caused by viral infection. nontarget cells (BHK-21, PK-15, and CHO-K1) expressing CD163 are infected by VR2332, the North American type of PRRSV (52) this study showed that ADAM17 suppresses PRRSV entry by downregulation of membrane CD163 expression level. this results indicate that ADAM17 is further activated by viral infection and that ADAM17 downregulates CD163. AM17 and sCD163 may be useful in enhancing porcine anti-PRRSV response."}
