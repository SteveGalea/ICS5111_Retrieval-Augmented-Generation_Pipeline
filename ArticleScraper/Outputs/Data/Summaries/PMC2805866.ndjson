{"summary": "the development of global gene expression profiling platforms has revolutionized molecular biological research. genome changes are seen in concert giving the potential for a broader understanding of the disease process. the late 1990s heralded the development of several important technological advances in molecular biological research. mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common location-related epilepsy. MTLE patients with dual pathology may have HS that is: (i) a nonspecific result of the primary epileptogenic lesion and not in itself epileptogenic; (ii) secondary to the primary epileptogenic lesions but also epileptogenic. HS was first described in 1825 by Bouchet and Cazauvieil (8). pathological diagnosis consists of atrophy of hippocampal formation with loss of neurones and reactive gliosis in CA1, CA4 and the dentate gyrus. in CA4, there is a loss of polymorphic neurons and pyramidal neurons. treatment of nonlesional MTLE continues to be a challenge for the epileptologist. monodrug therapy is initially implemented but this may progress quickly to multidrug therapy because of continued poor seizure control. 44% to 72% of patients remaining seizure free compared with 4.3% to 12% of patients on further trials of antiepileptic medications 6, 108, 111.

MPSS MPSS was developed by Brenner et al in 2000. it uses the technology of DNA megacloning in combination with nongelbased signature fluorescence sequencing to generate very large numbers of short readlength sequences. millions of cDNA fragments can be cloned by hybridization of uniquely tagged molecules to microbeads carrying 106 complementary sequences to each oligonucleotide primer used (10). s is possible even with low abundance genes expressed at 30 to 40 copies per million. hybridization techniques require replication of experiments. but cases with a zero signature count have been noted to demonstrate a significantly higher error rate. close to five million tags had been analyzed using this method (102) it has been used in cancer, cardiovascular and immunological studies 74, 76, 77. online SAGE libraries are now freely available to the public. microarrays are ordered samples of DNA with each sample representing a particular gene. they are then assayed for changes in gene expression following experimental treatment or in different disease states. it allows simultaneous monitoring of thousands of genes, thus providing a functional aspect to sequence information in a given sample. MPSS MPSS was developed by Brenner et al in 2000. it uses the technology of DNA megacloning in combination with nongelbased signature fluorescence sequencing to generate very large numbers of short readlength sequences. millions of cDNA fragments can be cloned by hybridization of uniquely tagged molecules to microbeads. quantification of sequences is possible as MPSS generates a digital output. differential expression comparisons can be formed with ease between samples. cases with zero signature count have been noted to demonstrate a significantly higher error rate than those with nonzero figures. electrical kindling models first described by Goddard et al in 1967. electrical kindling models demonstrate seizures with progressive increase in frequency and severity following prolonged stimulation. a chronic increase in seizure susceptibility is seen; however, spontaneous seizures are unusual and not expected. status epilepticus models also demonstrate a varying clinical response of the animal subjects to differing doses of convulsive agents. a high mortality rate is not unexpected and severe neuronal loss is often encountered histologically. initial seizures are unpredictable in their duration and severity and may be difficult to control. electrical kindling current stimulus was applied to a defined area. electrical afterdischarges were observed to appear and gradually lengthen. recordable afterdischarges were observed to broaden in origin from adjacent brain regions to more distant regions and eventually the opposite hemisphere. the absence of a true latent period in electrical kindling is in opposition to this. electrical kindling does not produce spontaneous seizures, unless prolonged kindling is performed. this model demonstrates the classical progression of human temporal lobe epilepsy with an initial convulsive event leading to seizures and status epilepticus before a latency period of varying length and appearance spontaneous seizures. the difficulty lies in measuring the duration of each animal's individual latency period and hence the optimal time point for intervention and study. electrical kindling models Kindling refers to repeated administration of subconvulsive electrical stimuli resulting in progressive development of seizure activity traditionally performed using daily stimulations. electrical kindling was applied to a defined area and was subconvulsive 33, 34. electrical afterdischarges were observed to appear and gradually lengthen. amygdala kindling is the ideal animal model for human temporal lobe epilepsy. the model is coined as the \u201coverkindling\u201d model (79) status epilepticus models demonstrate concordant human changes of severe neuronal loss, granule cell dispersion, remodeling of mossy fiber structures and neurogenesis. neurogenesis has been reported without corresponding cell death whereas granule cell dispersion may occur without evidence of neurogenesis 72, 98. ling SAGE 79 out of 6000 8 days Potschka et al 2002 Rat Amygdala kindling MPSS 264 out of 5696 2 h Tang et al 2002 Rat Kainate kindling Microarray 276 out of 3869 1 day Elliott et al 2003 Rat Pilocarpine Kindling Microarray 400 or 700 out of 8799 3 days 50 or 400 out of 8799* 14 days Lukasiuk et al 2003 Rat Amygd the majority of microarray papers published with regard to epileptogenesis involve chemical kindling. these differ in terms of model used (animal type, epileptogenic substance), time points and anatomical region investigated. hypoglycemia suggests a multifactorial mechanism of injury for kainic acid induced seizures that mimics or utilizes the same pathways as those associated with ischaemia, hypoglycemia or hemorrhage. similarities in histological changes seen in these conditions with marked neuronal loss, fibrillary gliosis with vacuolation and enlarged reactive astrocytes. there were 87 differentially expressed genes within the hippocampus. there were 37 genes regulated at 1 day, 12 at 4 days and 14 at 14 days. there was an overlap of 13 genes with the temporal lobe that showed 208 differentially expressed genes. IER is an animal model of MTLE that demonstrates progressive limbic seizures, eventually resulting in spontaneous generalized tonicclonic seizures at 5 to 6 months of age. 7000 tags were analyzed with creation of a SAGE library for each group consisting of 2492 and 2141 genes. eightyone differentially expressed genes were identified, with genes associated with neurotransmission and intercellular component downregulated. the immediate early gene Homer 1A was most strongly induced at 2 h. the immediate early gene Homer 1A was most strongly induced at 2 h. a Pubmed search utilizing the terms \u201cmicroarray\u201d and \u201cepilepsy\u201d or \u201cseizures\u201d revealed 49 reports. ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, kainic acid induced seizures, hypoglycemia and hypoxia was made by Tang et al in 2002. all genes induced by kainic acid were also induced by ischaemia, hemorrhage or hypoxia. this suggests a multifactorial mechanism of injury for kainic acid induced seizures that mimics or utilizes the same pathways as those associated with ischaemia. RNA was extracted from the hippocampus and temporal lobe at 1, 4 and 14 days following electrical kindling. there were 87 differentially expressed genes within the hippocampus with 37 genes regulated at 1 day, 12 at 4 days and 14 at 14 days. there was an overlap of 13 genes with the temporal lobe that demonstrated 208 differentially expressed genes in a similar time distribution as the hippocampus genes. over 10 000 tags were analyzed in both stimulated and control groups. there were 92 differentially expressed genes, predominantly associated with ribosomal proteins, protein processing and axonal growth. potschka et al used the rat kindling model of epileptogenesis to characterize the genomic changes using MPSS. seven thousand and four signatures with a minimal occurrence of two clones in each run were analyzed resulting in annotation of 5696 identified genes. the immediate early gene Homer 1A was most strongly induced at 2 h. direct comparison of the genomic responses of brain in response to ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, kainic acid induced seizures, hypoglycemia and hypoxia was made by Tang et al in 2002. all genes induced by kainic acid were also induced by ischaemia, hemorrhage or hypoxia. electrical kindling model was used by Lukasiuk et al to investigate gene expression changes during epileptogenesis. there were 87 differentially expressed genes within the hippocampus with 37 genes regulated at 1 day, 12 at 4 days and 14 at 14 days. there was an overlap of 13 genes with the temporal lobe that demonstrated 208 differentially expressed genes in a similar time distribution as the hippocampus genes. over 10 000 tags were analyzed in both stimulated and control groups. there were 92 differentially expressed genes associated with ribosomal proteins, protein processing and axonal growth. there were 55 differentially expressed genes when comparing between the groups with functional classification denoting immune response, cellular metabolism, axonal growth and regeneration, signal transduction, ion transport, synaptic and neurotransmission. the immediate early gene Homer 1A was most strongly induced at 2 h. jamali et al compared samples from autologous adjacent lateral temporal cortex. entorhinal cortex had been subjected to the same environment as epileptic tissue. study suggested dysregulation of neurotransmission and complement systems within the entorhinal cortex as another pathway affected in the process of epileptogenesis. the advent of global expression profiling technology has led to an ever increasing amount of genomic information available. to the end of 2006, there are over 1100 published reports on microarray studies involving the brain and brain disorders, with nearly 100 SAGE studies of same. genetic reactions are clearly different between different species of the same animal (86) these differences must be accentuated even more when comparing the different profiles in mice, rats and humans. status epilepticus models of epileptogenesis possess the advantage of a clearcut progression from initial insult to chronic epilepsy in contrast to electrical kindling. uk et al's review revealed distinct differences in gene expression between the kainic acid and pilocarpine models of epileptogenesis. the pathology of HS deserves special mention at this point. it remains a point of controversy as to whether HS is the underlying cause or end result of the clinical syndrome of MTLE. there were 72 genes reported to be regulated during epileptogenesis in two or more studies. no genes were reported regulated in more than five papers with the majority (50) only regulated in two papers.
