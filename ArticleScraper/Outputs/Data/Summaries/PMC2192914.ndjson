{"summary": "FITC (isomer 1) and LPS (serotype 055:B5) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Metrizamide A.G. was obtained from Accurate Chemical and Scientific Co. mRNA from tissues of wild-type and plt mice was subjected to gel electrophoresis, transferred to Hybond-N+ membranes. for in situ hybridizations, paraffin sections (5 m) from +/+ and plt mice were deparaffinized, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and treated with proteinase K. after hybridization, sections were washed at high stringency, dehydrated, dipped in photographic emulsion N enteric, inguinal, axillary, and brachial LNs from four plt and two +/+ mice were pooled. cells at 5 106/ml were layered onto metrizamide (14.5 g/100 ml medium) cell suspensions of pooled inguinal, axillary, and brachial LNs were prepared. aliquots of LN cells from four mice were pooled, partially purified on metrizamide, stained with biotinylated anti\u2013I-Ad followed by SA-PerCP. single cell suspensions were quantitated, stained with anti\u2013I-Ad and anti-B220, and analyzed by flow cytometry. aliquots were counted and cells were cytospun onto microscope slides for staining with 1:100 biotinylated anti\u2013I-Ad using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Labs) and DAB and counterstained with hematoxylin. the proportion of I-A+ cells was determined by examining 10 fields/slide over 3 slides. PCR was performed using a thermal cycler in a final volume of 50 l. samples were heated to 94\u00b0C for 4 min, AmpliTaq was added. samples were cycled for 35 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. no SLC signal is detected in the LN (B), spleen (D), and PP (E) of plt mice. plt mice have a defect in the homing of naive T cells that leads to a marked decrease in the number of these cells. in the spleens of plt mice, the total number of DCs was normal. in the spleens of plt mice, the total number of DCs was normal. there was a concomitant increase in the number of DCs within the white pulp. the distribution of DCs was examined in cryostat sections of +/+ (A, C, and E) and plt (B, D, and F) mice by immunohistochemistry. NLDC-145+ DCs (red) are distributed uniformly throughout the T cell zone (t) the identity of these cells as DCs was confirmed by their characteristic forward and side scatter profiles. a comparison of eight FITC-painted plt mice with controls at 24 h revealed a 75% decrease in the number of FITC+ DCs in draining LNs. single cell suspensions were prepared from individual LNs. stained with anti\u2013I-Ad and anti-B220. flow cytometry gated on I-A+ B220 cells. FITC signal in draining LNs was due to migration of DCs. whole mounts of abdominal epidermis from +/+ (A) and plt (B) mice show normal numbers and distribution of DCs. spleens of +/+ (C) and plt (D) mice were removed 6 h after intraperitoneal injection of LPS. dorsal ear epidermis from plt mice contains a normal number of DCs. when segments of dorsal ear skin were placed in culture, the number of DCs within the epidermis decreased to a similar extent over 72 h. a similar formation of cords was seen in plt mice. I-A+ cells were counted in 20 fields/slide over 4 slides and calculated as the mean SD of cells/ HPF. nonadherent cells were collected from bottom of wells in which ear skin had been cultured for 72 h. expression of ELC mRNA is decreased in the LNs and spleens of plt mice. expression of ELC mRNA is decreased in the LN (A) and spleen (C) of +/+ mice. expression of ELC mRNA is decreased in the LN (B) and spleen (D) of plt mice. the LD50 for MHV in wild-type mice was calculated to be 1,840 PFU. in plt mice the LD50 for MHV was 5.67 PFU, a 300-fold decrease. in plt mice the LD50 for MHV was 5.67 PFU, a 300-fold decrease."}
