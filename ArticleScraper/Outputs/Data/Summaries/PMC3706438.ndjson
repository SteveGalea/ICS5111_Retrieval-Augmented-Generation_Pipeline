{"summary": "M. tuberculosis infects approximately one-third of the world's population. only about 10% of infected individuals eventually develop TB disease. but only about 10% of infected individuals eventually develop TB disease. mice lacking Ifng have weakened defense against M. tuberculosis [23] and genetic variations in IFNG and its receptor, IFNGR, have been implicated in susceptibility to human TB [25]. the gene is located on chromosome 11p15 and is a potential candidate gene for TB susceptibility. the pediatric TB patients (n = 368) were newly diagnosed to be Pulmonary TB (PTB, pathological changes limited to in lung) or Extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB, pathological changes involving other tissues) at least 1 M. tuberculosis positive culture from their sputum could be sampled from expectorated sputum, induced sputum, gastric aspirates, or string tests. the core promoter of IFITM3 was amplified by PCR using 5\u2032-GAG CCC TGA ACC GGG ACA GTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TGG TGT CCA GCG AAG ACC AGC-3\u2032 primers. this process generated three new constructs with the 204 G/T site changed to 204 T/G. each constructed pGL3-IFITM3 plasmid was transfected into HeLa cells with the pRL-SV40 plasmid. results were expressed as relative light units of firefly luciferase activity over relative light units of renilla luciferase activity. the primers for IFITM3 were forward: 5\u2032-ATG AAT CAC ACT GTC CAA ACC TTC T-3\u2032 and reverse: 5\u2032-CTA TCC ATA GGC CTG GAA GAT CAG-3\u2032. genetic and Statistical anaylysis Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), Linkage disequilibrium (LD), allele frequency, genotype distribution, and haplotype analyses were performed using the SHEsis program. the pediatric TB patients (n = 368) were newly diagnosed to be Pulmonary TB (PTB, pathological changes limited to in lung) or Extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB, pathological changes involving other tissues) the gold standard diagnosis of pediatric TB is made when M. tuberculosis is isolated. DNA extraction and genotyping Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes by using a Genomic DNA Extraction kit (QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) the core promoter of IFITM3 was amplified by PCR using 5\u2032-GAG CCC TGA ACC GGG ACA GTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TGG TGT CCA GCG AAG ACC AGC-3\u2032 primers. the core promoter of IFITM3 was amplified by PCR using 5\u2032-GAG CCC TGA ACC GGG ACA GTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TGG TGT CCA GCG AAG ACC AGC-3\u2032 primers. this process generated three new constructs with the 204 G/T site changed to 204 T/G. each constructed pGL3-IFITM3 plasmid was transfected into HeLa cells with the pRL-SV40 plasmid. results were expressed as relative light units of firefly luciferase activity. all experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated three times. gene and Statistical anaylysis Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), Linkage disequilibrium (LD), allele frequency, genotype distribution, and haplotype analyses were performed using the SHEsis program. differences between non-contiguous variables, genotype distribution and allele frequency were tested by Fisher's exact test. Pulmonary TB (PTB) and Extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB) were diagnosed in 151 (41.0%) cases and 217 (59.0%) cases respectively. details are shown in Table 1.

IFITM3 was shown to limit viral replication at a late stage of endocytosis [18] as IFITM3 overexpression lead to the expansion of enlarged acidified compartments consisting of lysosomes. lysosomal pathway plays an important role in TB pathogenesis [36], [37], it may directly determine the successful elimination of M. tuberculosis by macrophages or the survival of M. tuberculosis within macrophage"}
