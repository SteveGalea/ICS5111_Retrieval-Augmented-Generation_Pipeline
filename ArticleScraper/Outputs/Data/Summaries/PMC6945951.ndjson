{"summary": "acute respiratory distress syndrome and lung injury are frequent causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with extensive trauma, sepsis, pneumonia, and other critical illnesses. mortality continues to be high in the range of 25\u201340%. the reason that this condition continues to remain lethal is because there are no specific treatments. nanocarriers are specially designed to target inflammation and cancer that have a permeable vasculature. nanocarriers are specially designed to target inflammation and cancer that have a permeable vasculature. nanocarriers are particularly attractive for the delivery of molecular targets in the setting of critical illnesses. acute Lung Injury/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ALI and ARDS arise from direct and indirect injury to the lungs and result in a life-threatening form of respiratory failure. the importance of lung injury has been highlighted by the emergence of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome) despite improved molecular understanding, development of specific treatments for ARDS have yet to be developed. peptides target upstream molecules such as TREM1 [23, 24] and reactive oxygen species and Hsp90 that lead to activation of NF-B, ultimately leading to ALI and ARDS. nanoformulations are effective at attenuating lung inflammation in a murine model. nanoparticles can be constructed by various methodologies so that the effect can be targeted at the desired site [6, 7, 8]. nanomicelles stabilize peptides in active biological form (-helix), which is preferred for ligand-receptor interactions. nanoparticles prevent rapid peptide degradation in vivo, thereby prolonging bioactivity. nanoparticles can be introduced by systemic administration (oral, dermal, intravenous, etc.) nanoparticles can be introduced directly into the lung through inhalation or intranasal or oropharyngeal aspiration. nanoparticles can be introduced directly into the lung through inhalation or intranasal or oropharyngeal aspiration. in vivo studies to test therapeutic Efficacy of SSM we recently tested the efficacy of GLP-1 nanomicelles in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury. we have previously shown that this model induces neutrophilic influx in the lung. we have tested the efficacy of TREM1 nanomicellar peptides in a model of LPS-induced sepsis and lung injury. the first TREM identified, and blockade of TREM1 has been shown to improve survival in animal models of sepsis. LP17 subcutaneously in a single dose prior to LPS challenge. the animals were sacrificed 12 h after LPS nebulization. LP17 inhibited the expression of TREM1. studies in animal models have investigated nanocarriers to target endothelial cells. anti-PECAM liposomes loaded with EUK-134 enhanced targeting to the endothelium as compared to control IgG-coated liposomes. these liposomes alleviated LPS-induced lung injury, suggesting anti-PECAM/EUK/liposome may be useful for alleviating acute pulmonary inflammation. treatment with polyethylenimine/ 2-adrenergic receptor improved survival of mice from 28 to 64% in lethal LPS-induced lung injury. these studies show the potential of targeting specific molecules and cell types using a nanomedicine approach to mitigate lung injury and inflammation. nanoparticle delivery to the lungs maximizes efficacy and enhancing resolution of inflammation while reducing collateral damage to innocent bystander organs as occurs in patients with ALI and ARDS. nanoparticles [45, 46, 47, 48] composed of biodegradable lipid-based nanomicelles and polymers fulfill many requirements placed on these delivery systems. this includes the ability to be transferred into an aerosol, stability against forces generated during aerosolization and biocompatibility. alveoli are small and there are approximately 300 million of them in each lung. they have a very large surface area in total (100 m2) for performing efficient gas exchange, making it an attractive organ for direct drug delivery. nanoparticles demonstrate several advantages for the treatment of respiratory diseases. nanocarrier-based gene therapy can upregulate the expression of pulmonary erythropoietin receptor in an animal model of hyperoxic lung injury. these studies suggest that aerosolized or inhalational administration of nanocarrier-based therapies may prove effective at remedying lung injury. novel features, such as dose measuring, breath actuation, and predetermined drug release, can significantly improve drug delivery. nanomedicine promises endless range of applications from biomedical imaging to drug delivery and therapeutics. nanoparticulate drug delivery systems appear to be particularly attractive and promising for drug delivery to organs such as the lung."}
