{"summary": "the rapid emergence of carbapenem-resistant isolates has severely reduced therapeutic options (1, 2). CRAb sheltered coexisting carbapenem-susceptible bacteria, preventing them from being killed by carbapenem. this sheltering effect is clinically relevant because 20 to 50% of A. baumannii infections have been found to be polymicrobial (4\u20136) Bacterial strains and plasmids were cultured in Luria Bertani broth (LB) at 37\u00b0C. overnight cultures were subcultured in fresh LB broth for 2 h before antibiotics or chemicals were added. pYMAb-2 A shuttle vector created by inserting a replicon of a plasmid from A. baumannii ATCC 19606T into pET-28a. Kanr 8 pOXA-58-2 IS1008-ISAba3-blaOXA-58 with its P2 and P1 promoters was amplified using primers XbaIIS1008 and NcoIOXA58 and cloned into the 3 pOXA-83 blaOXA-83 and its promoter in ISAba1 were amplified using primers ISAba1(XbaI)F and OXA-51-like(XhoI)R. blaOXA-58 minus the signal peptide was amplified using primers IS1008(XbaI)F and IS1008(M-BamHI)R. pOXA-5815AA-CT IS1008-ISAba3-blaOXA-58 with a deletion of 5, 10, or 15 amino acids at C terminus of OXA-58 was amplified using primers IS1008(XbaI)F and OXA-58-C5aa(XhoI)R, OXA-58-C10aa(XhoI)R, or OXA-58-C15aa( supernatants (extracellular fractions) were collected, filtered through 0.22-m-pore-size filters. proteins in the 100-kDa fraction were further concentrated using 10,000-MWCO Amicon Ultra centrifugal concentrators. an ECL Western blotting kit (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) was used for detection. an ECL Western blotting kit was used for detection. samples containing equal amounts of OXA-58 were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. zones of inhibition indicated carbapenem inactivation. samples were embedded in agarose and fixed overnight at 4\u00b0C. overnight cultures of A. baumannii and E. coli were diluted 100-fold. cocultures were serially diluted, and 100 l of the dilutions was plated onto MacConkey agar. bacteria and plasmids Strain or plasmids Ec1003 A clinical carbapenem-susceptible E. coli isolate (imipenem MIC, 0.125 g/ml) this isolate was used to demonstrate the sheltering effect of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. 8 pOXA-23 blaOXA-23 and its promoter in ISAba1 were amplified using primers ISAba1(XbaI)F and OXA23-like(XhoI)R. 3 pOXA-72 blaOXA-72 and its promoter in ISAba1 were amplified using primers ISAba1(XbaI)F and OXA-51-like( 3 pOXA-585AA-CT, pOXA-5810AA-CT, and pOXA-5815AA-CT IS1008-ISAba3-blaOXA-58 with deletions in P2 was amplified using primers IS1008(XbaI)F and IS1008(NcoI)R. promoter-EGFP fragment was cloned into the XbaI and XhoI sites of signal peptide of IS1008-ISAba3-blaOXA-58 was amplified using primers IS1008(BamHI)F and OXA-58-20aaSP(NcoI)R. the promoter-signal peptide-EGFP fragment was cloned into the XbaI and BamHI sites of pYMAb-2. proteins in the different cell fractions from 2 108 CFU of bacteria were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. membranes were incubated with primary antibody, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich), and his-tagged proteins were generated in rabbits (3). the two aliquots were adjusted to have similar concentrations of OXA-58. each 20-l mixture was loaded onto a blank disk containing a lawn of a carbapenem-susceptible Escherichia coli. samples were embedded in agarose and fixed overnight at 4\u00b0C with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. after two washes with PBS, samples were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide and dehydrated using a graded acetone series. blaOXA-58 is preceded by ISAba3, which is truncated by IS1008. the genetic structure of IS1008-ISAba3 provides a strong promoter, P2, and a weak promoter, P1, for the expression of blaOXA-58. two major export systems, Sec and Tat, are involved in the periplasmic translocation of proteins in Gram-negative bacteria (12, 13) silico analysis of the OXA-58 signal sequence predicted that OXA-58 was preferentially translocated via the Sec system. strains with C-terminal deletions were also examined to verify that extracellular release of OXA-58 was associated with periplasmic translocation. EGFP was detected in the extracellular fraction when OXA-58 was coexpressed. these results indicated that periplasmic OXA-58 was selectively released. the majority of the extracellular OXA-58 existed in a >100-kDa protein complex. Western blot analysis of extracellular OXA-58 showed that most of the extracellular OXA-58 was present in a protein complex of >100 kDa. most of the extracellular OXA-58 was present in a protein complex of >100 kDa, with or without treatment with 8 g/ml imipenem. extracellular OXA-58 increased in purified OMVs in presence of imipenem challenge. this OMV-associated OXA-58 was also partially protected from proteinase K degradation. the results indicated that OMV-independent OXA-58 and extracellular gyrase were likely released upon cell lysis. the OMV-independent OXA-58 hydrolyzed nitrocefin more rapidly than OMV-associated OXA-58. TEM showed that imipenem treatment increased the formation of OMVs on the surface of an A. baumannii strain that expressed OXA-58 at high levels. a secA inhibitor reduced extracellular CHDL levels and abolished the sheltering effect of CRAb. inhibition of the translocation pathway would also reduce the extracellular release of OXA-58. rose bengal and erythrosin B (22) have been developed. rose bengal at 50 g/ml eliminated the carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii sheltering of E. coli from imipenem killing. TEM of Ab290 expressing wild-type OXA-58 after treatment with imipenem, rose bengal, or both. rose bengal did not inhibit imipenem-induced formation of OMVs. OXA-58 was primarily and selectively released via OMVs. blaOXA-58 is preceded by ISAba3, which is truncated by IS1008. two major export systems, Sec and Tat, are involved in the periplasmic translocation of proteins in Gram-negative bacteria (12, 13) silico analysis of the OXA-58 signal sequence predicted that OXA-58 was preferentially translocated via the Sec system. OXA-58SP-EGFP was detected in the cytoplasmic and periplasmic fractions but not in the extracellular fraction. this results indicated that periplasmic OXA-58 was selectively released. in Gram-negative bacteria, proteins can be secreted across the outer membrane via different transporters (17, 18), OMVs, or both (19). Western blot analysis of extracellular OXA-58 showed that most of the extracellular OXA-58 was present in a protein complex of >100 kDa. most of the extracellular OXA-58 was present in a protein complex of >100 kDa, with or without treatment with 8 g/ml imipenem. XA-58 increased in the purified OMVs in the presence of imipenem challenge. this OMV-associated OXA-58 was also partially protected from proteinase K degradation. XA-58 levels in the 100-kDa fractions also increased. gyrase was not found in purified OMVs by proteomic analysis. the results indicated that OMV-independent OXA-58 and extracellular gyrase were likely released upon cell lysis. imipenem treatment increased the formation of OMVs on the surface of an A. baumannii strain that expressed OXA-58 at high levels. a secA inhibitor reduced extracellular CHDL levels and abolished sheltering effect of CRAb. rose bengal and erythrosin B (22) have been developed. addition of rose bengal at sublethal doses lowered the MIC of imipenem. 290 strain expressing wild-type OXA-58 in different cell fractions (A) and in OMVs (B) after treatment with 8 g/ml imipenem, 12.5 g/ml rose bengal. nitrocefin hydrolysis by OMV-associated OXA-58 without treatment, with 8 g/ml imipenem, with 12.5 g/ml rose bengal. rose bengal at a sublethal dose of 50 g/ml abolished the CRAb sheltering effect for imipenem-susceptible E. coli. this sheltering effect has been associated with polymicrobial infections, which demonstrate higher pathogenicity than monomicrobial infections in the presence of imipenem treatment. EGFP was fused to the OXA-58 signal sequence and overexpressed with the strong P2 promoter. this result suggests that OXA-58 contains an additional domain(s) that selectively triggers OMV formation. this proteinase K-susceptible OXA-58 may be secreted via an unidentified pathway. imipenem and ceftazidime increased the amount of OXA-58 in each OMV. inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis by these -lactams may have caused increased vesiculation and OMV formation. the biological roles of OMV-associated OXA-58 release and OMV-independent OXA-58 release may differ. two major export systems translocate proteins into the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria. most -lactamases are translocated via the Sec system, but some -lactamases are transported via the Tat system (40). the fluorescein analogues rose bengal and erythrosin B were both found to effectively inhibit the ATPase activity of SecA. bengal was also able to diminish the amount of extracellular OXA-58 through inhibition of OMV-associated release of OXA-58. the majority of extracellular OXA-58 was selectively released via OMVs."}
