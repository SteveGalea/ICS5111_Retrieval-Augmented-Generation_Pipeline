{"summary": "noroviruses are a genus of positive-sense RNA viruses that are the major etiologic agent of epidemic nonbacterial gastroenteritis worldwide (11, 12). Symptoms of human norovirus infection are generally self-limiting and typically resolve within 72 h (12), which is consistent with a role for innate antiviral mechanisms such as interferons (IFNs) IFNs exert direct antiviral effects via induction of the transcription of multiple potentially antiviral genes (IFN-stimulated genes) STAT-1-deficient mice (STAT-1/) succumb to MNV infection and have elevated viral titers in multiple tissues. IRF-1-deficient (IRF-1/) mice exhibit defects in CD8 T cell and natural killer (NK) cells (24, 28) and exhibit increased TH2 skewing and decreased production of IFN- by CD4 T cells. IRF-1 plays additional roles in innate and adaptive immunity. MATERIALS AND METHODS Virus stocks and plaque assay were prepared by infecting RAW 264.7 cells. cells were plated at a density of 2 106 cells per well in 6-well plates. cells were inoculated for 1 h at room temperature on a rocker. seven- to 9-week-old mice were orally inoculated with 3 105 PFU of MNV-1.CW3 (38) tissues were harvested into 2-ml sterile, screw-top tubes containing 250 l of 1-mm zirconia-silica beads and stored at 80\u00b0C. cells were plated at a density of 1 105 cells/well in 24-well dishes or 1 106 cells/well in 6-well dishes. infections were performed at day 10 of in vitro culture after 12 to 16 h of treatment with recombinant IFN- or IFN-. gene expression profile of untreated WT bone marrow-derived macrophages was compared to profiles of untreated IRF-1/, STAT-1/, IRF37/, and CIITA/ bone marrow-derived macrophages. a subset of genes was selected for analysis by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) to validate our microarray findings. macrophages, and cDNAs were synthesized (13, 14). qRT-PCR was performed with SYBR green (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in vivo viral titer data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. survival curves were analyzed using the log rank test. all mice used were either derived from C57/BL6 embryonic stem cells or extensively backcrossed to C57/BL6 mice. IFN-R/ and IFN-R/ (17, 26) mice were originally obtained from Michel Aguet (Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Lausanne, Switzerland) DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 5% defined equine serum, 10% CMG14-12 supernatant [37], 1% MEM nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM l-glutamine. in vitro infections, cells were plated at a density of 1 105 cells/well in 24-well dishes. microarray data were normalized using the robust multiarray average normalization routine in Affymetrix's Expression Console software. differential expression analysis was carried out in Matlab. qRT-PCR was performed with SYBR green (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) total RNAs were isolated from C57BL/6, IRF-1/, STAT-1/, IRF37/, and CIITA/ bone marrow-derived macrophages. cDNAs were synthesized (13, 14) using the CT method. all data other than microarray data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software, San Diego, CA. statistical analyses were performed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for in vitro experiments. IRF-1/ mice treated with control MAb had significantly increased viral titers in the intestine, spleen (P 0.01), MLN (P 0.01), liver (P 0.01), and lung (P 0.05) compared to WT and IFN-R/ mice treated with control MAb at day 5 postinoculation. however, deficiency of either IRF-1 or the IFN-R resulted in significant enhancement of viral replication in all organs mice were treated with a control or anti-IFNAR MAb before inoculation with 3 105 PFU of MNV. seven to 10 mice were used per group, and data represent at least three independent experiments. IRF-1/ mice treated with anti-IFNAR MAb showed significant lethality after MNV infection compared to control MAb-treated IRF-1/ mice and control MAb or anti-IFNAR MAb-treated WT or IFN-R/ mice. IRF-1 is critical for resistance to lethal infection with MNV when IFN- signaling is inhibited. there was no statistically significant difference in MNV replication in untreated macrophages over 36 h. however, treatment of WT macrophages with IFN- significantly inhibited MNV replication. there was a significant defect in IFN-mediated inhibition of MNV replication in IRF-1/ macrophages. no significant differences were determined between titers in WT and IRF-1/ cells. inhibition of MNV replication occurs in IFN-activated macrophages independent of the IFN- receptor. vivo that IFN- and IRF-1 have functions independent of the effects of IFN-. IFN-R, CIITA, IRF-3, and IRF-7 were treated with increasing doses of IFN- or medium alone before inoculation at an MOI of 5 (A) or 0.05 (B) IFN- significantly inhibited MNV replication, in a dose-dependent manner, at both high and low MOIs. however, STAT1/ macrophages were unable to control MNV replication even after stimulation with 100 U/ml of IFN-. the signaling molecules IRF-1, but not CIITA, IRF-3, or IRF-7, are required for IFN-mediated inhibition of MNV replication in macrophages. ninety-seven genes were downregulated in a manner dependent on STAT-1. ten genes required just IRF-1 for downregulation by IFN-. eighteen genes did not meet statistical criteria for assignment to designated groups in Table 2. qRT-PCR compared the fold changes in expression induced by IFN- in the various gene-deficient macrophages to those observed in WT macrophages. for 82% (9 of 11 genes) of the genes, our microarray analyses accurately predicted the gene's dependence on the various transcription factors for responsiveness to IFN-. we analyzed groups A to D by gene set overlap analysis using mSigDB. we found enrichment for several metabolic pathways, such as pyrimidine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. Conversely, we found enrichment of several immune response pathways in genes that were inhibited by STAT-1. FN-mediated antiviral effects are revealed and can be studied when IFN-- and IFN--dependent control of MNV in vivo. we compared viral titers in IRF-1/, IFN-R/, and C57BL/6 (WT) control mice treated with either a monoclonal antibody (MAb) against the IFNAR-1 subunit of the IFN-R (anti-IFNAR) (32) or an isotype control MAb prior to deficiency of either IRF-1 or the IFN-R resulted in significant enhancement of viral replication in all organs compared to treatment of WT mice with anti-IFNAR MAb. both IRF-1 and the IFN-R are critical for control of MNV replication in vivo. IRF-1 deficiency also results in increased susceptibility to lethal MNV infection. none of the mice treated with control or anti-IFNAR MAb succumbed to MNV infection. IRF-1 is required for IFN-- but not IFN--mediated inhibition of MNV replication in primary macrophages. based on these results, we hypothesized that IRF-1 would be required for IFN-mediated control of MNV in macrophages. macrophages were inoculated with MNV at an MOI of 5 (A) or 0.05 (B and C) no significant differences were detected by the unpaired t test. treatment of IFN-R/ macrophages with IFN- resulted in significant inhibition of MNV replication. effects of IFN-R were comparable between WT and IFN-R/ macrophages. transcription factors STAT-1, IRF-1, and CIITA are important for induction of specific ISGs in response to IFN-mediated control of MNV replication. to investigate the involvement of other IFN--related signaling molecules in IFN-mediated control of MNV replication, we generated macrophages from STAT-1/ and CIITA/ mice. the 12-h time point was selected because this is sufficient to induce an antiviral state that limits MNV replication. we identified 359 genes whose expression was changed >2-fold in WT macrophages by IFN- treatment. 38 genes were differentially regulated by IFN- when either CIITA or IRF-7 was missing. group A represents genes that are upregulated by IFN- in a STAT-1-dependent manner. group B represents genes that are upregulated by IFN- in an IRF-1- and STAT-1-dependent manner. group D represents genes that are downregulated by IFN- in an IRF-1- and STAT-1-dependent manner. Transcription levels of select genes were examined after 12 h of treatment. genes assigned to group A (A), group B (B), group C (C), group D (D) and group E (E) were examined. FN- in a manner dependent on both STAT-1 and IRF-1 were enriched for lipid metabolism, steroid metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, and terpenoid biosynthesis. DISCUSSION IFNs are likely vital to the host defense against human noroviruses and are important for inhibition of MNV. IRF-1 in IFN-mediated responses in vivo. previous studies with IRF-1/ mice have confirmed the importance of IRF-1 for defense against both EMCV and WNV in vivo. but due to the complex nature of IRF-1 actions in host defense, the specific contribution of IRF-1 to IFN-dependent responses in vivo is unclear. IRF-1/ mice treated with control MAb showed significantly enhanced replication and viral dissemination of MNV. this enhanced replication paralleled the increased replication and viral dissemination induced in WT mice treated with anti-IFNAR. however, in primary macrophages, we observed that IRF-1 is dispensable for inhibition of MNV by IFN-. -Atg12/Atg16L1 autophagosome elongation protein complex is required for IFN-mediated inhibition of MNV replication in macrophages. both are required for the effects of IFN- but not IFN- on MNV replication in macrophages. it is intriguing to speculate that IRF-1 regulates a key early step in an IFN-/IRF-1/STAT-1/Atg5-Atg12/Atg16L studies of immune responses to WNV found that IRF-1 is required for IFN-mediated control of viral replication in macrophages. it is difficult to ascertain the specific contribution of IRF-1 to IFN--dependent responses in vivo. not of the same magnitude, paralleled the increased replication and viral dissemination induced in WT mice treated with anti-IFNAR. however, we did not observe a significant increase in replication in untreated macrophages compared to WT macrophages. further studies may reveal cell type- and tissue-specific requirements for IRF-1 in IFN--dependent but IFN--dependent control of MNV replication. g16L1 complex is shared with IRF-1 in that it regulates a key early step in an IFN-/IRF-1/STAT-1/Atg5-Atg12/Atg16L1-dependent antiviral mechanism. our recent work showed that IFN- blocks the formation of the membranous norovirus replication complex in an Atg5-Atg12/Atg16L1-dependent manner (15)."}
