{"summary": "microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and thereby influencing various physiological and pathological processes. a microarray assay was performed to study the expression pattern of miRNAs in EV71-infected human rhabdomyosarcoma cells. expression levels of 8 most differentially up-regulated miRNAs and 3 most differentially down-regulated miRNAs were confirmed by qRT-PCR. results could extend our understanding to the regulatory mechanism of miRNAs underlying the pathogenesis of EV71 infection."}
