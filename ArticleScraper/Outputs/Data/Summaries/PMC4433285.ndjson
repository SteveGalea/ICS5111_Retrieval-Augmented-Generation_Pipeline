{"summary": "arenaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses capable of establishing asymptomatic, persistent infections in their normal hosts. Lassa virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus are both old world arenaviruses. LCMV is a potent teratogen and highly lethal pathogen in immunosuppressed individuals. the viral polymerase begins replication of the vRNAs to generate antigenomic (vcRNA) or full-length, complementary copies of each vRNA segment. these vcRNAs then serve as templates for the generation of additional L and S segment vRNAs. in total, eight different viral RNA species are generated during arenavirus infection. LCMV can establish a persistent state of infection in both rodent and in vitro cell culture models. infectious virus production typically peaks within the first few days of infection, followed by a marked drop in GPC expression. MC57 cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. a working stock of LCMV strain Armstrong 53b was generated in vero E6 cells. the infectious titer was determined via plaque assay on vero E6 cells. eight week old HLA-A*0201/Kb transgenic mice were given 2 x 105 plaque forming units (PFU) of LCMV strain Armstrong 53b via intraperitoneal inoculation and euthanized on d 4 pi for collection of spleen. all work was approved by the Scripps Research Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. mg of spleen and 600 l RLT lysis buffer were added to a beadbeater tube. RNA was extracted from the clarified supernatant according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNA was eluted in 50 l of nuclease-free ddH2O. versions of the RT primers were obtained from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA) each MGB probe was labeled with the 5\u2019 reporter dye 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and a 3\u2019 non-fluorescent quencher (NFQ) attached to a minor groove binder moiety. RNA extracted from a high titer stock of cell-free LCMV virions was subjected to RT in the absence of an RT primer. the resulting cDNA products were screened via standard PCR using a panel of PCR primer pairs. a panel of four wash buffers were used during affinity purification. the captured cDNAs were subjected to PCR following affinity purification. to prime the synthesis of cDNA from the LCMV S vRNA, S vcRNA, L vRNA, or L vcRNA, we used primers S 2865-, S 861+, L 5906-, or L 126+. RT reactions were carried out in a total volume of 50 l using the TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents Kit (4304134, Life Technologies) cDNAs were either added directly to the PCR master mix or affinity purified using streptavidin beads. each tube was then washed 3 times in 1X Washing Buffer and resuspended in the appropriate volume of PCR master mix. LCMV Armstrong 53b S segment vRNA was detected with RT primer S 2865- and PCR primers S 2275+ and S 2628-. thermocycling conditions were as follows: 94\u00b0 for 10 minutes, 30 or 40 cycles of 94\u00b0 for 30 seconds, 47\u00b0 for 30 seconds, and 72\u00b0 for 2 minutes 30 seconds, then 72\u00b0 for 7 minutes for Fig 3. each sample was subject to standard RT-PCR targeting the vRNAs or vcRNAs of the L or S segment. cDNAs were either added directly to the QPCR master mix or affinity purified using streptavidin beads. each QPCR reaction was carried out in a total volume of 25 l containing 5 l of cDNA template, 900 nM of each QPCR primer, and 200 nM of probe. absolute copy numbers of vRNA or vcRNA corresponding to the LCMV Armstrong 53b S or L segment were determined by comparison with a series of standard quantities (50, 5x103, 5x105, or 5x107 copies) of the pT7-S or pT7-S plasmids. cell lines were grown at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. infection of vero E6 or MC57 cells with LCMV was done at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. for acute time point collections (12, 18 and 48 hr pi) and 7 d pi time point, cells were not split prior to collection. eight week old LCMV transgenic mice were given 2 x 105 plaque forming units (PFU) of LCMV strain Armstrong 53b via intraperitoneal inoculation. RNA was eluted in 60 l of nuclease-free ddH2O. infected cells from tissue culture were trypsinized at desired time point pi. two to 4 million cells were mixed with lysis buffer, homogenized. RT primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, CA) each MGB probe was labeled with the 5\u2019 reporter dye 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and a 3\u2019 non-fluorescent quencher (NFQ) attached to a minor groove binder (MGB) moiety. RNA extracted from vero E6 cells at 48 hr pi was subjected to RT in the absence of an RT primer. the resulting cDNA products were screened via standard PCR using a panel of PCR primer pairs. stock of cell-free LCMV virions was subjected to standard RT-PCR. stock of RT virions was subjected to RT-PCR using the RT primer S 2865- and PCR primers 1856+ and 2628-. a portion of each reaction was subjected to affinity purification. RT reactions were carried out in a total volume of 50 l using the TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents Kit (4304134, Life Technologies) per the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. cDNAs were either purified using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads as described below or added directly to the PCR reaction. cDNAs were purified using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (11205D, Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin, Life Technologies) and the Dynabeads kilobaseBINDER Kit (60101, Life Technologies) for each RT reaction, a volume of 10 l of magnetic beads was pre-equilibrated in 40 l of Binding Solution. each tube was then washed 3 times in 1X Washing Buffer and LCMV S segment vRNA was also detected with RT primer S 2865- and PCR primers S 1856+ and S 2628-. in Fig 4, the following PCR primer pairs were used to map the cDNAs formed during RT in the absence of an RT primer. cDNAs were formed during RT in the absence of an RT primer. each sample was subjected to standard RT-PCR targeting the vRNAs or vcRNAs of the L or S segment. RNA extracted from the samples listed in panel (A) were subjected to QRT-PCR targeting the vRNAs or vcRNAs of the L or S segment. vRNA was detected using RT primer S 2865- and PCR primers-probe S 2275+, S 2338-, and S 2295+P, S vcRNA with RT primer S 861+ and PCR primers-probe S 929+, S 988-, and S952+P, L vcRNA with RT primer L 5906- and PCR primers-probe L 5517+, L 5645-, and L 5582- RT primers S 861+ and L 126+ bind the GPC region or Z region. for the S segment, vRNAs primed by RT primer S 2865- would undergo QPCR using the NP-specific primer-probe set. for the L segment, vRNAs primed with RT primer L 5906- would be quantified using the L-specific primer-probe set (primers L 5517+/L 5645- and probe L 5582-P each primer-probe set was tested for its ability to accurately measure known quantities of a DNA standard control plasmid encoding the target sequence. depicted are the amplification plots and standard curve fit lines for the primer-probe sets specific for S segment vcRNA (A) or L segment vcRNA (B) the signal generated in the absence of an RT primer was as high as 6.8 0.4% of that seen with the specific RT primer for the L segment vRNA and S segment vRNA and vcRNA. the values ranged from 44.8 6.6 to 58.4 3.0% for cell-free or sucrose-banded virions. mouse spleen #2 4 d 3.9 0.8 5.3 2.0 2.2 2.3 58.4 3.0 Supernatant from MC57 cells 12 hr 4.0 0.7 8.7 0.9 14.7 0.3 102.6 11.4 18 hr 5.0 0.3 32.5 2.2 21.2 4.1 111.7 12.9 24 d 6.9 3.7 5.2 1.4 nd nd nd Sucrose-banded virions from vero E6 cells 48 hr cDNAs were then used in a series of PCR reactions to determine the region of the LCMV S segment that was converted to cDNA. the resulting cDNAs were then used in a series of PCR reactions to determine the region of the LCMV S segment that was converted to cDNA. ated RT Primers Circumvents Nonspecific priming of viral RNAs during RT has been reported for several RNA viruses. one effective strategy to circumvent this phenomenon has been the use of biotinylated RT primers to generate target-specific cDNAs and streptavidin-coated magnetic beads to affinity purify these biotinylated cDNAs. the 1X Washing Buffer eliminated the non-specific product without affecting the retention of the biotinylated product. using standard curve plasmids as templates in QPCR reactions, we determined that the addition of up to 25 l of streptavidin beads into a QPCR reaction had no effect on PCR efficiency. RNA extracted from sucrose-banded LCMV virions at 48 hr pi was subjected to RT using 27, 9, 3, 0.3, or 0 pmol of biotinylated primer S 2865- (to target S vRNA) or L 5906- (to target L vRNA), followed by QPCR using the primer-probe sets for S vRNA or L vRNA. it was determined that 9 pmol of primer was sufficient to fully prime the target RNA template for each of the 4 primers. RT was performed on RNA extracted from sucrose-banded LCMV particles. from this experiment, it was determined that 10 l of beads was optimal to capture all of the biotinylated cDNAs. biotinylated cDNAs were affinity purified using 10 l of magnetic streptavidin beads and subjected to QPCR using the primer-probe sets for the vRNAs or vcRNAs of the L or S segment that are listed in Table 3. the vcRNA species were less abundant than the corresponding vRNA species. of S vcRNAs was slightly less than L vcRNAs (ratio of 0.7 0.1 S vcRNA to L vcRNA) there was a consistent hierarchy in the quantities of viral RNA species observed at 12 hr, 18 hr, and 7 d pi. the ratio of S vRNA to L vRNA ranged from 3.7 0.4 (mean SD) to 5.7 0.8-fold, which is consistent with previous findings. the ratio of vRNA to vcRNA for either the S or L segment was variable, ranging from 1.4 0.1 to 3.7 0.5 for the S segment.

RT reactions were performed in the absence of an RT primer as a negative control. cDNA was amplified by each of the primer-probe sets in a subsequent PCR. cRNA values ranged from 44.8 6.6 to 58.4 3.0% for L segment vcRNA. values for L and S segment vcRNAs in the absence of an RT primer sometimes equaled or slightly exceeded that seen with the specific RT primer. 0.1 14.7 0.3 102.6 11.4 18 hr 5.0 0.3 32.5 2.2 21.2 4.1 111.7 12.9 24 d 6.9 3.7 5.2 1.4 nd nd nd virions from vero E6 cells 48 hr 6.2 2.6 111 2.8 6.3 0.7 73.1 3.6 aFor each RNA species, the numerical values represent the mean copy number standard deviation obtained via QRT-PCR in the absence of an LCMV segment-specific primer during a 1785 bp PCR product was detected from both RNA samples. we also amplified a slightly smaller (1501 bp) PCR product. large regions of the S segment are converted to cDNA in a primer-independent manner. RT-PCR was performed on an RNA sample derived from a high titer stock of cell-free LCMV virions. a fraction of each sample was subjected to affinity purification with streptavidin-coated beads. a positive PCR signal was detected for each of the 3 unpurified cDNA samples. the protocol was effective at removing all nonspecific template for each of the remaining 3 RT primers. based on these results, we elected to exclusively use the 1X Washing Buffer in all subsequent experiments. assay optimization Our next goal was to optimize the remaining parameters of the assay to maximize its sensitivity while also streamlining the time required to perform it. RNA extracted from sucrose-banded LCMV virions collected from vero E6 cells at 48 hr pi was subjected to RT using 27, 9, 3, 0.3, or 0 pmol of biotinylated primer S 2865- (to target S vRNA) or L 5906- (to target L vRNA), followed by QPCR using the primer-probe sets for S vRNA or L vRNA, respectively, listed in Table 3. cDNAs generated using 9 pmol of RT primer were affinity purified using a range of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (5 l, 10 l, or 20 l) from this experiment, it was determined that 10 l of beads was optimal to capture all of the biotinylated cDNAs. viral RNA extracted from MC57 cells at 12 h, 18 hr, 7 d, or 24 d pi with LCMV was subjected to RT using 9 pmol of the biotinylated RT primers listed in Table 1. values are listed as mean copies per cell SD and are plotted on the left Y axis. sources of RNA Time pi Ratio of viral RNA species a S vRNA to L vRNA to L vcRNA to L vcRNA to L vcRNA to L vcRNA to L vcRNA MC57 cells 12 hr 4.9 1.1 2.3 0.4 2.0 0.1 4.1 0.2 18 hr 5.7 0.8 3.7 0.5 1.5 0.1 2.3 0.2 7 d 3.7 0.4 1.6 0.1 1.1 0.2 vRNA to vcRNA ranged from 3.7 0.4 (mean SD) to 5.7 0.8-fold, which is consistent with previous findings. the ratio of vRNA to vcRNA for either the S or L segment was variable, ranging from 1.4 0.1 to 3.7 0.5 for the S segment. the fold-change was determined by dividing the quantity of a given viral RNA obtained at the earlier time point from the quantity at the later time point. LCMV generates a total of four replicative RNA species. the QRT-PCR assay we describe overcomes these limitations. the latter three assays include the requirement for large quantities of RNA and/or radioactive reagents coupled with limited sensitivity and throughput. however, these approaches were not designed to specifically track individual LCMV replicative RNA species. cDNAs derived from specific LCMV RNA species share significant areas of complementarity and may be self-priming to one another during RT. the NP, L and Z mRNAs are complementary to one another over stretches of their intergenic regions (IGRs) PCR reactions to map the primer-independent cDNAs generated from LCMV S segment RNAs during RT. if viral mRNAs were the sole cause of nonspecific priming, we would predict that the IGR on the viral RNA species being primed would not be converted to cDNA because the 3\u2019 end of the mRNA primer would contain part or all of the IGR. this result could be expected for virion-derived RNAs due to their lack of abundant m the assay described here circumvents these issues and allows precise quantification of individual viral RNAs. we used the assay to characterize the viral RNA content in sucrose-banded LCMV virions. the ratio of S vRNA to L vRNA was consistent with previous studies [15]. hr, or 24 d pi, the percentage of S segment vcRNA detected without an RT primer was low compared to the values seen with the primer. this may indicate that the vcRNA content in virions can vary over the course of infection. this could have increased the quantity of vcRNA detected in these samples. s assembled are equally amenable to measuring total L or S segment RNA levels. the goal is simply to measure viral RNA load across samples. there is no need for affinity purification of a biotinylated cDNA."}
