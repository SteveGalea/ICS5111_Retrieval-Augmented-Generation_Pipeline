{"summary": "JE virus (JEV) is considered the most serious because of its neurotropical impacts, higher fatality rate, and permanent neuropsychiatric sequelae (1). the expanding geographical range of JEV and potential for outbreaks of JE in nonimmune populations demands an urgent effort to develop effective antiviral therapies. vivo study of DC immunology (17) showed marked exacerbation of JE progression and abnormal differentiation of inflammatory monocytes following CD11chi DC ablation. a skewed IL-17+CD4+ Th17 cell response at inflamed sites may exacerbate JE progression. the imbalanced environment of Foxp3+ Treg/IL-17+ Th17 cells and Ly-6Chi/Ly-6Clo monocytes in response to CD11chi DC ablation may contribute to the exacerbation of JE progression. the study was pre-approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Experiments of Chonbuk National University. all mice were genotyped and bred in the animal facilities of. Chonbuk National University. all mice were genotyped and bred in the animal facilities of. Chonbuk National University. cells were washed twice with PBS containing monensin and surface-stained with FITC-anti-CD4 at 37\u00b0C for 5 h. after washing twice with PBS, cells were fixed with fixation buffer. brain leukocytes and splenocytes were surfacestained with FITC-anti-CD4 markers. s were harvested and homogenized by pressing them through 100-mesh tissue sieves. then digested with 25 g/ml collagenase type IV (Worthington Biochem, Freehold, NJ), 0.1 g/ml trypsin inhibitor N-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 10 g/ml DNase I (Amresco, Solon, OH) and 10 mM HEPES RNAs were extracted from sorted CD11b+Ly-6Clo monocytes. then used in real-time qRT-PCR performed with a CFX96 real-time PCR Detection system. reaction mixture containing 2 l of template cDNA, 10 l of 2 SYBR Primix Ex Taq and 500 nM primers was prepared. temperature was increased from 65\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C at a rate of 0.2\u00b0C/15 animals, cells, viruses, and reagents C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice were purchased from Samtako (O-San, Korea) all experimental protocols requiring biosafety were approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committees (IACUC) of Chonbuk National University. diphtheria toxin (DT) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) the primers specific for cytokines (18,19,26) were synthesized at Bioneer Corp. the expression of transcription factors specific for each Th cell subset was determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) the expression of transcription factors specific for each Th cell subset was determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. the expression of cytokines in sorted CD11b+Ly-6Clo monocytes was determined by quantitative SYBR Green-based real-time qRT-PCR. mice were infected i.p. with JEV (3.0107 PFU), and splenic CD11b+Ly-6Clo monocytes were sorted at 3 dpi. all data were analyzed using bio-Rad CFX Manager version 2.1 software. cytokine gene expression was evaluated by unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test. CD11chi DC-ablated mice showed a higher frequency of IL-17+CD4+ Th17 cells in spleens at 5 dpi. CD11chi DC-ablated mice contained fewer IFN-+CD4+ Th1 cells in their spleens. enhanced CNS-infiltration of Th17 and Th1 cells seems to contribute to exacerbation of JE in CD11chi DC-ablated mice. this imbalance in Th17 and regulatory Treg cells that infiltrated the CNS resulted in a higher ratio of Tregs to Th17 cells in vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice. s to Th17 CD4+ Th cells was calculated using absolute numbers of CNS-infiltrated Tregs and Th17 cells in the CNS at 5 dpi. data are presented as the meanSE of values derived from at least three independent experiments (n=35). monocytes and macrophages are important contributors and/or regulators of immunopathological progression. inflammatory/classical monocytes are Ly-6ChiCCR2hiCX3CR1lo/int. patrolling/non-classical monocytes are Ly-6Clo/intCCR2\u2013CX3CR1hi (20). dysregulated accumulation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi and Ly-6Clo monocytes in the spleen and brains of CD11chi DC-ablated mice resulted in a markedly increased ratio of Ly-6Chi to Ly-6Clo monocytes. this dysregulated accumulation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi and Ly-6Clo monocytes in the spleen and brain may contribute to the exacerbated progression of JE. altered features of CD11b+Ly-6Clo monocytes in CD11chi DC-ablated mice induces the abnormal differentiation of inflammatory CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes. we examined the differentiation of CD11b+Ly-6Clo monocytes in CD11chi DC-ablated mice during JE progression. the levels of activation markers in splenic CD11b+Ly-6Clo monocytes were determined by flow cytometric analysis at 3 dpi. data are presented as the meanSE of values derived from at least three independent experiments (n=35) the ablation of CD11chi DCs may affect the differentiation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi and Ly-6Clo monocytes in inflamed tissues. this inappropriate differentiation of CD11b+Ly-6Clo monocytes in CD11chi DC-ablated mice may fail to regulate JE progression. CD11chi DC-ablated mice showed a higher frequency of IL-17+CD4+ Th17 cells in spleens at 5 dpi, but IFN-+CD4+ Th1 cells showed no change in frequency. CD11chi DC-ablated mice contained fewer CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs in their spleens. discrepancy may be caused by CNS-infiltration of CD4+ Th1 cells from the spleen that is considered reservoir. enhanced CNS-infiltration of Th17 and Th1 cells seems to contribute to the exacerbation of JE in CD11chi DC-ablated mice. CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs were detected by intracellular Foxp3 and surface CD4 staining. ratio of Tregs to Th17 CD4+ Th cells was calculated using absolute numbers of CNS-infiltrated Tregs and Th17 cells. CD11chi DC ablation causes fewer Ly-6Clo monocytes to accumulate in lymphoid tissues and the CNS during JE progression. monocytes and macrophages are important contributors and/or regulators of immunopathological progression. monocytes and macrophages are important contributors and/or regulators of immunopathological progression. CD11chi DC-ablated mice showed a higher frequency and total number of CNS-infiltrated CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes, but fewer CD11b+Ly-6Clo monocytes in the brain. dysregulated accumulation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi and Ly-6Clo monocytes in the spleen and brain may contribute to the exacerbated progression of JE in CD11chi DC-ablated mice. o monocytes was calculated using absolute numbers of Ly-6Chi and Ly-6Clo monocytes in the spleen and brain at 3 dpi. data are presented as the meanSE of values derived from at least three independent experiments (n=35). splenic CD11b+Ly-6Clo monocytes were sorted by FACSAria at 3 dpi. total RNA extracted from splenic CD11b+Ly-6Clo monocytes was used for real-time qRT-PCR. ablation of CD11chi DCs may affect differentiation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi and Ly-6Clo monocytes in inflamed tissues. this inappropriate differentiation of CD11b+Ly-6Chi monocytes in CD11chi DC-ablated mice may fail to regulate JE progression."}
