{"summary": "peptide 6F (D-W-L-K-A-F-Y-D-K-F-F-E-K-E-F-K-E-F-F) was synthesized from all L-amino acids by solid phase synthesis. the vector pBI121 containing a kanamycin resistant gene (NPT II), a cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter (CaMV35S) and a nopaline synthase terminator was the addition of chemically synthesized 6F peptide to the diet was accomplished as previously described for the addition of the 4F peptide (8). preparation and addition of tomatoes with or without transgenic 6F to WD is described below in the processing and analysis of tomatoes section. all experiments involving mice were approved by the University of California at Los Angeles Animal Research Committee. the gene encoding 6F is 54 bp long and encodes the 18 amino acids D-W-L-K-A-F-Y-D-K-F-E-K-F-E-F-F with a molecular mass of 2,435.81 Da. the expression cassette for 6F also contained the plant-derived signal peptide with 23 amino acids (M-I-M-A-S-S-K-L-L-S-L-A-L- transformations without cassette containing sequences for plant-derived signal peptide and 6F are referred to as empty vector (EV) copies harboring the binary vector were sequence verified in the University of California at Los Angeles GeneSeq Core. three plants positive for the 6F gene were initially identified from 120 plants selected in kanamycin. homozygous plants were selected, grown, and allowed to produce ripened tomatoes from which the seeds were again collected. the process was repeated a minimum of 3 times to ensure that the lines were homozygous. analysis was performed using a 4000 QTRAP quadruple mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) equipped with electrospray ionization source. LC-ESI-MS/MS or LC-ESI-MS analysis was performed using a 15N-labeled chemically synthesized 6F peptide. 200 mg of small intestine were homogenized in 10 ml of acetonitrile:water (1:1) and the homogenates were lyophilized and resuspended in 400 l of acetonitrile:water (1:1). samples were run on HPLC using a reversed-phase analytical column and a gradient solvent system of acetonitrile:water (30\u201380% in 20 min) lycopene content of tomatoes was determined by previously described methods. lyophilized tomato powder was suspended in NaCl (3.42 M) and extracted using ethyl acetate and cyclohexane (1:1; v/v) by centrifuging for 5 min at 600 g. ELISA kits for determination of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) were purchased from Echelon (catalog number k-2800s) mice originally purchased from Jackson Laboratories on a C57BL/6J background were obtained from the breeding colony of the department of laboratory and animal medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California at Los Angeles. levels of arachidonic acid and its metabolites were measured by LC-ESI-MS/MS as described previously (8). the percent of the aorta with atherosclerosis was determined by en face analysis as previously described (8, 20). codon usage table (www.kazusa.or.jp/codon) was used to design the DNA sequence. the cassette was cloned into the XbaI/SacI site replacing the GUS gene of the plant binary vector pBI121. the vector also contained the npt II gene for kanamycin selection of transgenic plants. the gene conferring kanamycin resistance is under the control of nopaline synthase promoter (NOS pro) a total of 1,200 tomato cotyledons (Lycopersicon esculentum) were transformed for 6F in two separate experiments and empty vector in one experiment using the procedure described by Frary and Earle (21). lyophilizer system (VirTis, Gardner, NY) to obtain lyophilized tomato fruit tissue (pulp plus skin) proteins from the lyophilized fruit were obtained by homogenization with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in extraction buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, 150 mM NaCl, 2% Nonidet P-40, 1% desoxycholic acid, 0.5% SDS) at pH 8.0 with complete protease inhibitor mixture LC-ESI-MS/MS or LC-ESI-MS was used for routine quantification of 6F peptide in lyophilized tomatoes. peptide was homogenized in 10 ml of acetonitrile:water (1:1) and resuspended in 400 l of acetonitrile:water (1:1). samples were run on HPLC using reversed-phase analytical column. unknown samples (200 l out of original 400 l) were injected and 0.5 ml fractions were collected. samples corresponding to the retention time of the chemically synthesized 6F were dried and analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis. the 6F peptide synthesized from all L-amino acids without end blocking groups (L-6F) when fed to apoE/ mice significantly reduced plasma SAA levels and decreased the percent of the aorta with atherosclerotic lesions. mice were fed WD that did not contain peptide (WD No Peptide) or that contained L-6F without end blocking groups at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day of peptide. after seven weeks the percent of the aorta with atherosclerotic lesions was determined by en face analysis. PCR positive for 6F expressed a band on SDS-PAGE gels that migrated similarly to authentic chemically synthesized 6F without end blocking groups. other tomato lines in Fig. 3 did not (e.g., line 95 and the WT control) regions of SDS-PAGE gels containing a band migrating with authentic 6F demonstrated the LC-ESI-MS signature of 6F (A) the same region on gels without a band did not (B) female LDLR/ mice 10 weeks of age were housed four in each cage. each cage was given compacted WD containing no lyophilized tomatoes. the mice receiving the Tg6F tomatoes received 800 g of 6F per mouse per day (40 mg/kg/day of 6F) after two weeks the mice were bled. the second experiment differed from the first experiment in the following details: i) the mice were older (4\u20135 months of age); ii) the control tomatoes were EV tomatoes instead of WT tomatoes. the results were similar between the two experiments as shown in supplementary Fig. IV. feeding the control EV tomatoes significantly decreased plasma LPA 16:0, 18:0, 18:1, and 20:4 levels. feeding the control EV tomatoes only significantly decreased plasma LPA 20:4 levels. in the second short-term experiment feeding the control EV tomatoes did not significantly decrease plasma SAA levels. the lycopene content of ripened tomatoes that were WT, transgenic for 6F (1A; 17A), or empty vector (108; 110) was determined as described in Materials and Methods. after 13 weeks of feeding WD with transgenic 6F tomatoes (but not EV tomatoes) there was a significant reduction in plasma SAA, total cholesterol, and triglycerides and a significant increase in plasma PON activity and HDL-cholesterol levels. feeding WD with transgenic 6F tomatoes significantly reduced the percent of the aorta with atherosclerosis compared with WD alone or WD + EV tomatoes. the latter was not significantly different from WD alone. the mice in all cages ate all of the diet each night. the aortas from the mice described in Fig. 7 were harvested, processed, and analyzed. the aorta from one of the mice fed transgenic 6F was severely damaged during the harvest and was not processed. plasma-free arachidonic acid, 5-HETE, 12-HETE, 20-HETE, PGE2, TXB2, 14,15-EET, DHA, or 8-isoPGF2. a significant correlation between the levels of LPA 16:0 or LPA 18:0 and the percent of the aorta with lesions is shown in Fig. 10A\u2013E. addition of EV tomatoes to WD significantly reduced jejunum cholesterol levels. cholesterol levels in the duodenum and jejunum were not different between mice fed EV tomatoes or transgenic 6F tomatoes. the levels of LPA in the small intestine of the mice described in Fig. 11 were plotted against the percent of the aorta with lesions for each mouse. if this were the case, we might expect to find intact peptide in the small intestine of mice eating WD with transgenic 6F tomatoes. intact 6F peptide was found in the small intestine of each of these six mice. the lower limit of detection for 6F peptide in the plasma was 100 ng/ml. intact 6F peptide was found in the small intestine. the mice consumed approximately 4 g of the chow per mouse per day. after 10 days the mice were bled and plasma SAA levels were determined by ELISA as described in Materials and Methods. the 6F peptide was found to account for between 0.6 and 1.0% of the weight of the lyophilized tomatoes. most of the tomato lines that were PCR positive for 6F expressed a band on SDS-PAGE gels that migrated similarly to authentic 6F without end blocking groups. other tomato lines in Fig. 3 did not. protein from each tomato line (100 g) was added to each lane and run on SDS-PAGE gels using the protocol described in Materials and Methods. regions of SDS-PAGE gels containing a band migrating with authentic 6F demonstrated the LC-ESI-MS signature of 6F. the same region on gels without a band did not (B) in the first short-term experiment we used WT tomatoes as the control tomatoes. these were grown identically to the EV and transgenic 6F tomatoes in the St. Louis core facility. they were processed identically as stated in Materials and Methods. feeding WD with transgenic 6F tomatoes significantly decreased plasma-free 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE),15-HETE, and prostaglandin (PGD2) levels. feeding WD with transgenic 6F tomatoes significantly reduced plasma PGE2 levels, while feeding EV tomatoes did not (supplementary Fig. IVC\u2013E). transgenic 6F tomatoes significantly decreased plasma SAA, free 5-HETE, 15-HETE, PGD2 and PGE2 levels. feeding the control EV tomatoes significantly reduced plasma SAA levels. in both short-term experiments feeding the control EV tomatoes failed to alter HDL-cholesterol levels. the homozygous transgenic 6F tomato lines 1A and 17A had slightly but significantly less lycopene content compared with WT or empty vector tomatoes. the lycopene content of ripened tomatoes that were WT, transgenic for 6F (1A; 17A), or empty vector tomatoes was determined as described in Materials and Methods. plasma levels of free docosahexaenoic acid 22:6 (n-3) (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid 20:5 (n-3) (EPA) were not significantly improved by feeding either EV or transgenic 6F tomatoes. feeding WD with transgenic 6F tomatoes significantly reduced the percent of the aorta with atherosclerosis. the plasma from the mice described in Fig. 7 was analyzed as described in Materials and Methods for: free arachidonic acid (A); free 5-HETE (B); free 15-HETE (C); free DHA (D); and free EPA (E). the aorta from one of the mice fed transgenic 6F was severely damaged during the harvest and was not processed. the percent of the aorta with atherosclerosis and PON activity (r2 = 0.2585, P 0.0001) and HDL-cholesterol levels (r2 = 0.5948, P 0.0001) there was no significant correlation between the percent of the aorta with atherosclerotic lesions and body weight, plasma-free arachidonic acid, 5-HETE, 12-HETE, 20-HETE, PGE2, TXB2, 14,15-EET, D WD and transgenic 6F tomatoes shown for the percent of the aorta with atherosclerotic lesions and plasma total cholesterol (A); plasma triglycerides (B); plasma PON activity (C); plasma HDL-cholesterol levels (D); and body weight (E). addition of EV tomatoes to WD significantly reduced tissue cholesterol levels in the duodenum and jejunum, but not in the ileum. 2 and LPA 20:4 in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum significantly correlated with the percent of the aorta with atherosclerotic lesions in these mice. addition of transgenic 6F tomatoes to the WD significantly reduced the levels of LPA in the small intestine. the mice described in supplementary Fig. VII were fasted overnight for 20 h. then fed WD with lyophilized transgenic 6F tomato powder containing 900 g of 6F in 2 g of diet. over a period of 30\u201390 min each of six mice ate all of the 2 g of diet. a phase I/II study in humans was undertaken in which D-4F was administered orally in doses ranging from 0.43 to 7.14 mg/kg. maximum plasma peptide levels were low (Cmax 15.9 6.5 ng/ml) but doses of 4.3 and 7.14 mg/kg significantly improved the HII. surprisingly there was no improvement in HII (7). feces (8) and small intestine (9) should be equal concentrations of peptide in at least one compartment containing a major site of action. if administered with niclosamide, the peptide inhibited lesion progression. if administered with niclosamide, enough L-4F might survive degradation after oral administration. the 6F peptide was synthesized from all L-amino acids without end blocking groups but found the activity of the peptide to be dramatically reduced. this led us to seek alternative peptides synthesized from all L-amino acids that might be effective without end blocking groups. this led us to seek alternative peptides synthesized from all L-amino acids that might be effective without end blocking groups. the addition to the diet of chemically synthesized L-6F without blocking groups produced biologic results similar to those achieved with the addition of lyophilized transgenic 6F tomatoes. we cannot exclude that a portion (if not all) of the beneficial effects of expressing the 6F peptide in tomatoes is due to an increase in an as yet unidentified nonlycopene, non6F component of these tomatoes. transgenic 6F tomatoes significantly reduced cholesterol levels in the duodenum and jejunum, but neither reduced cholesterol levels in the ileum. the levels of cholesterol in the small intestine were either very weakly correlated with the percent of the aorta with lesions. studies reported here used only female mice, thus results in male mice need to be determined in future studies. the studies reported here relied on en face analysis of atherosclerotic lesions. intact 6F peptide was identified in the small intestine 2 h after the mice finished eating 900 g of 6F contained in transgenic tomatoes. no peptide was detected in the plasma with methods that would have detected 100 ng/ml."}
