{"summary": "cytoplasmic RNA helicases RIG-I and MDA5 are key antiviral PRRs that recognize nucleic acids derived from RNA viruses. MAVS recruits E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF proteins to conjugate lysine 63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitin chains. TBK1 and IKKi directly phosphorylate IRF3 and IRF7 to trigger their dimerization, nuclear localization, and activation overexpression of MAVS induces apoptosis countered by viral proteins including hepatitis C virus NS3/4A (10) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nonstructural protein NSP15 (11). how MAVS promotes caspase activation is poorly understood but likely involves direct interactions with proapoptotic effector proteins. TAX1BP1 acts as a ubiquitin binding autophagy receptor that plays critical roles in autophagy-dependent clearance of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (26). TAX1BP1 translocates to mitochondria in response to RNA virus infection and inducibly interacts with the MAVS adaptor protein. findings provide new insight into the regulation of virus-induced cell death. tax1bp1+/ and tax1bp1/ MEFs were infected with the RNA virus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. tax1bp1+/ and tax1bp1/ MEFs were infected with the RNA virus vesicular stomatitis virus. total mRNA was extracted and subjected to qRT-PCR analysis for IFN- expression. values in the graph denote mean standard deviations. pSTAT1, phospho-STAT1, and KO HeLa cells were subjected to Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. lysates from tax1bp1+ and tax1bp1/ MEFs were subjected to Western blotting for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) cleavage, a hallmark of apoptosis mediated by the executioner caspases 3 and 7 (28). TAX1BP1 KO HeLa cells were markedly resistant to VSV-GFP replication compared to control HeLa cells. despite potential defects in type I IFN signaling, TAX1BP1 cells were markedly resistant to VSV-GFP replication compared to control HeLa cells. apoptosis was quantified by flow cytometry after fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-annexin V and 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) staining. STS-induced apoptosis was significantly increased in both tax1bp1/ MEFs and TAX1BP1 KO HeLa cells. TAX1BP1 deficiency is largely selective for virus-induced apoptosis. tax1bp1+ and tax1bp1/ MEFs (A and B) and TAX1BP1 WT and KO HeLa cells (B) were infected with 30 HA units/ml SeV for 6 h or treated with 5 M staurosporine (STS) for 5 h or 10 M etoposide (ETO) for TAX1BP1 expression is highest in the human cancer cell lines Hs 852.T (melanoma), LOU-NH91 (squamous cell lung carcinoma), and DLD1 (colon adenocarcinoma) among 1,405 cell lines examined. however, transfection of poly(IC) induced the cleavage of PARP1 in DLD1 cells after 4 h, indicating sensitivity to apoptosis. TAX1BP1 degradation increases susceptibility to apoptosis by virus infection. DLD1 cells were transfected with poly(IC) (5 g/ml) or infected with recombinant VSV-GFP (MOI of 1) for the indicated times. total cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting. a proteomic analysis using stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture revealed that TAX1BP1 is rapidly stabilized by treatment with MLN4924 (54), a selective inhibitor of the NEDD8-activating enzyme. instead, proteasome inhibitor MG132 blocked TAX1BP1 degradation. TAX1BP1 degradation is mediated by both proteasomal and autophagic degradation pathways. MG132 strongly inhibited poly(IC)-induced PARP1 cleavage compared to inhibition by zVAD and 3-MA. however, we were unable to detect any RIPK1 cleavage upon poly(IC) transfection. kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), and p38, were phosphorylated upon VSV infection in tax1bp1+/ MEFs. but phosphorylation of p38 was slightly decreased, and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was completely abrogated in tax1bp1/ MEFs compared to that in controls. this suggests that TAX1BP1 may differentially regulate the activation of the MAPK pathways to promote cell survival in response to we compared the levels of MAVS protein in total cell lysates derived from tax1bp1+/ and tax1bp1/ MEFs. the basal level of MAVS protein was upregulated in tax1bp1/ MEFs relative to the level in tax1bp1+/ MEFs. this suggests that the enhanced sensitivity to virus-induced apoptosis in tax1bp1/ MEFs may be due in part to increased expression of MAVS protein cMAVS, a cleavage product of MAVS, was used as a loading control. levels of MAVS were also increased in TAX1BP1 KO HeLa cells. a previous report indicating that MAVS translocates to the detergent-resistant membrane fractions following virus infection (3). basal level of MAVS protein in TAX1BP1 KO HeLa cells was higher (1.3-fold) than that in control MEFs. half-life of MAVS was also extended in TAX1BP1 KO HeLa cells compared to that in control cells. control and TAX1BP1-deficient MEFs (A) and HeLa cells (C) were treated with 10 g/ml CHX for the indicated times, followed by Western blotting of the total cell lysates using anti-MAVS and --actin antibodies. TAX1BP1 interacts with MAVS and induces its polyubiquitination. polyubiquitination (total ubiquitin) of MAVS was strongly induced in TAX1BP1 KO HeLa cells. conistently, virus-induced K48-linked polyubiquitination of MAVS was absent in TAX1BP1 KO HeLa cells. TAX1BP1 interacts with MAVS and induces its polyubiquitination. 293T cells were transfected with HA-TAX1BP1 together with flag-MAVS and deletion mutants lacking the caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), proline-rich domain (PD) and transmembrane (TM) domain. the IP and total cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. both MAVS and Itch were detected in the TAX1BP1 immunoprecipitates (in Tax1bp1+/+ but not in Tax1bp1/ MEFs) in an inducible manner after virus infection. seV-induced IRF3 phosphorylation was detected in both tax1bp1+/+ and tax1bp1/ MEFs. TAX1BP1 was coimmunoprecipitated with Flag-MAVS FL, PD, and TM. but not CARD, suggesting that the interaction is required for TAX1BP1-mediated MAVS polyubiquitination. TRIM25 was reported to induce MAVS polyubiquitination on lysine 10. we previously found that TAX1BP1 could interact directly with Itch via its two PPXY (P, proline; X, any amino acid; Y, tyrosine) motifs embedded within the C-terminal UBZ domains. TAX1BP1 could mediate the ubiquitination and degradation of MAVS by recruiting Itch through the CARD of MAVS. itch+/+ and itch/ MEFs were transfected with a Flag-MAVS plasmid for 24 h. total cell lysates were subjected to western blotting with the indicated antibodies. sonicated total cell extracts were used for ubiquitination assays. d complex and cell lysates were subjected to IP using anti-MAVS. total cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting with anti-MAVS. TAX1BP1 appeared to be heavily phosphorylated, as indicated by slower-migrating TAX1BP1 bands on Western blots. 293T cells were transfected with Flag-MAVS together with WT HA-TAX1BP1 and the PPXY double mutant (Y741A Y768A) however, MAVS ubiquitination was clearly reduced when the two PPXY motifs in TAX1BP1 were mutated. tax1bp1+/ and tax1bp1/ MEFs were infected with the RNA virus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. tax1bp1+/ and tax1bp1/ MEFs showed strong CPE compared to controls in wild-type (WT) MEFs. RNA was extracted and subjected to qRT-PCR analysis for IFN- expression. the values in the graph denote the means standard deviations. lysates from tax1bp1+/ and tax1bp1/ MEFs infected by VSV-GFP were subjected to Western blotting for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) cleavage, a hallmark of apoptosis mediated by the executioner caspases 3 and 7 (28). TAX1BP1 KO HeLa cells were also more sensitive to apoptosis after infection the enhanced virus or poly(IC)-induced apoptosis in TAX1BP1-deficient cells is likely not attributable to type I IFN autocrine effects. despite potential defects in type I IFN signaling, TAX1BP1 KO HeLa cells were markedly resistant to VSV-GFP replication compared to control HeLa cells. apoptosis was quantified by flow cytometry after fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-annexin V and 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) staining. STS-induced apoptosis was significantly increased in both tax1bp1/ MEFs and TAX1BP1 KO HeLa cells. TAX1BP1 deficiency is largely selective for virus-induced apoptosis. tax1bp1+ and tax1bp1/ MEFs (A and B) and TAX1BP1 WT and KO HeLa cells (B) were infected with 30 HA units/ml SeV for 6 h or treated with 5 M staurosporine (STS) for 5 h or 10 M etoposide (ETO) for TAX1BP1 expression is highest in the human cancer cell lines Hs 852.T (melanoma), LOU-NH91 (squamous cell lung carcinoma) and DLD1 (colon adenocarcinoma), among 1,405 cell lines examined. however, transfection of poly(IC) induced the cleavage of PARP1 in DLD1 cells after 4 h, indicating sensitivity to apoptosis. TAX1BP1 degradation increases susceptibility to apoptosis by virus infection. DLD1 cells were transfected with poly(IC) (5 g/ml) or infected with recombinant VSV-GFP (MOI of 1) for the indicated times. total cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. TAX1BP1 degradation elicited by virus infection was not inhibited by MLN4924. proteasome inhibitor MG132 blocked TAX1BP1 degradation. this suggests that TAX1BP1 is subject to proteasomal degradation upon virus infection in a CRL-independent manner. TAX1BP1 degradation is mediated by both proteasomal and autophagic degradation pathways. MG132 strongly inhibited poly(IC)-induced PARP1 cleavage compared to inhibition by zVAD and 3-MA. however, we were unable to detect any RIPK1 cleavage upon poly(IC) transfection. tax1bp1+/ MEFs were infected with VSV (MOI of 1) for the indicated times. tax1bp1+/ and tax1bp1/ MEFs were pretreated with 25 M SP600125 for 1 h prior to infection with VSV for 6 h. overexpression of MAVS is sufficient for expression of type I IFNs and the activation of apoptotic JNKs. expression levels of MAVS protein may serve as a critical determinant for sufficient antiviral responses. to test this idea, we generated double-KO HeLa cells lacking both TAX1BP1 and MAVS by editing the MAVS gene in TAX1BP1 KO HeLa cells using CRISPR/Cas9 as described previously. cMAVS, a cleavage product of MAVS, was increased in TAX1BP1 KO HeLa cells compared to levels in control cells. the basal level of MAVS protein was also increased in TAX1BP1 KO HeLa cells. the basal level of MAVS protein in TAX1BP1 KO HeLa cells was higher (1.3-fold) than that in control MEFs. the half-life of MAVS was also extended in TAX1BP1 KO HeLa cells compared to that in control cells. TAX1BP1-deficient MEFs (A) and HeLa cells (C) were treated with 10 g/ml CHX for the indicated times, followed by Western blotting of the total cell lysates using anti-MAVS and --actin antibodies. the relative MAVS levels compared to those of the CHX-untreated control cells are shown under the corresponding bands. TAX1BP1 WT and KO HeLa cells were transfected with Flag-MAVS. total cell lysates were subjected to IP with anti-DYKDDDDK tag affinity gel. TAX1BP1 plays an essential role in virus-induced ubiquitination of MAVS. 293T cells were transfected with HA-TAX1BP1 together with full-length (FL) Flag-MAVS and deletion mutants lacking the caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), proline-rich domain (PD) and transmembrane (TM) domain. IP and total cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. both MAVS and Itch were detected in the TAX1BP1 immunoprecipitates. seV-induced IRF3 phosphorylation was detected in both tax1bp1+/+ and tax1bp1/ MEFs. Upon infection, MAVS is targeted to and polymerized on the mitochondrial outer membrane to induce type I IFN expression and apoptosis. ubiquitination assays were performed using Flag-MAVS FL and CARD in 293T cells. overexpression of MAVS alone induced its mono- and polyubiquitination. but coexpression together with TAX1BP1 further promoted polyubiquitin chains. TAX1BP1 could mediate the ubiquitination and degradation of MAVS by recruiting Itch through the CARD of MAVS. we examined the activation of virus-induced MAPK signaling pathways in Itch/ MEFs. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Flag-MAVS and HA-TAX1BP1 (WT or mutants) at a ratio of 1 to 9 for 24 h. after 24 h cells were fractionated into RIPA buffer-soluble and -insoluble fractions. immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to Western blotting. to determine if TAX1BP1 is required for mediating the interaction between MAVS and Itch, we performed co-IP assays using tax1bp1+/+ and tax1bp1/ MEFs. cells were infected with SeV for various times, and total cell lysates were subjected to IP using anti-MAVS, followed by Western blotting with anti-Itch and anti-TAX1BP1. 293T cells were transfected with Flag-MAVS together with WT HA-TAX1BP1 and the PPXY double mutant (Y741A Y768A) however, MAVS ubiquitination was clearly reduced when the two PPXY motifs in TAX1BP1 were mutated. TAX1BP1 deficiency resulted in the accumulation of MAVS in the detergent-insoluble fractions upon its overexpression. TAX1BP1 is a mitochondrion-targeting adaptor molecule that modulates virus-induced apoptosis by facilitating itch-induced MAVS degradation. TAX1BP1 interacts with MAVS and triggers its ubiquitination and degradation by recruiting the E3 ligase Itch. other adaptors have been reported to mediate MAVS degradation. ubiquitin residues on MAVS can also be ubiquitinated by other ubiquitin E3 ligases for its degradation following virus infection (39, 43). TAX1BP1 was unable to promote the ubiquitination of the MAVS CARD mutant lacking K10 (Fig. 7F) the complexity of the MAVS degradation pathways is further highlighted by other ubiquitin E3 ligases. overexpression of TBK1 and IKKi caused slower migration of TAX1BP1. it also appears that MAVS-associated TAX1BP1 may be phosphorylated after SeV infection. TAX1BP1 may also regulate apoptosis downstream of death receptors such as TNFR. plasmid expressing Flag-human TAX1BP1 isoform 1 (amino acids 1 to 789) described previously (50) cDNA of TAX1BP1 was PCR amplified and inserted between the SalI and NotI sites of pRK5-HA. a guide RNA specific to the MAVS gene was cloned into LentiCRISPR-V2 vector. anti-PARP (catalog number 9532), phospho-JNK1/2 (Thr183/Tyr185) and caspase-3 (sc-7148), phospho-p38 MAPK (4511), TAX1BP1 (5101), RIPK1 (3493), rodent-specific MAVS (4983), and K48-linkage specific polyubiquitin (4289) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX. anti-flag (M2) (F1804) and -actin (A1978) antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) anti-IFNAR2 antibody (clone MMHAR-2) was from PBL Assay Science (Piscataway, NJ) cell culture, transfection, and virus infection. mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), HeLa, and 293T cells were cultured in DMEM. cells were lysed on ice for 1 h in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.25% deoxycholate, 10 mM NaF, and 10 mM Na3VO4) the pellet fraction was solubilized by boiling in 1 SDS sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 2% SDS, 10% g immunoprecipitates were washed three times in RIPA buffer. cells were fixed and permeabilized in chilled methanol for 10 min. cells were imaged on a Nikon E800 microscope with a 60 oil-corrected objective. cultured cells were homogenized in buffer B (0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM HEPES-NaOH [pH 7.4] with 30 strokes of a Dounce glass homogenizer. the homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. the pellet was centrifuged at 13,000 g for 10 min. qRT-PCR was performed in a 96-well microplate using an ABI Prism 7500 detection system.
