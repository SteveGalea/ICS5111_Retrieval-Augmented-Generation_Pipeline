{"summary": "the difficulty in establishing a diagnosis originates from the existence of 2 pathotypes of the causative agent, the feline coronavirus (FCoV) after infection via the fecal\u2013oral route and replication of feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) in the intestinal epithelium,11,28,34-36 FECV can undergo mutations. positive immunostaining of macrophages in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of cats with FIP has been reported,15,23 but this approach requires tapping of CSF. new reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) tests seem capable of distinguishing FIPV and FECV pathotypes. the study population reflected the cat population that is usually presented to a veterinary practice or clinic in which a clinician would consider FIP as a major differential diagnosis. we hypothesized that this minimally invasive technique would allow a definitive antemortem diagnosis of FIP in cats without effusion. icterus \u2013 FIP 6 Siamese, 1 y, MI Ascites, icterus \u2013 FIP 7 Thai cat, 5 mo, MI Ascites, fever, icterus \u2013 FIP 8 BSH, 8 mo, MI Ascites, fever, icterus + FIP 9 DSH, 8 y, MN Ascites, neurologic signs, intracranial neoplasia 12 DSH, 3 y, FN As fever, uveitis, hyperglobulinemia \u2013 FIP 25 DSH, 1 y, FI Ascites, icterus, neurologic signs, hyperglobulinemia ++ FIP 26 Maine Coon, 10 mo, MI Ascites, fever, hyperglobulinemia \u2013 FIP 28 BSH, 1 y, MN Pleural effusion, fever, hyperglobulinemia \u2013 FIP 29 BSH, 5 mo, FI Fever, hyperglob in 30 cats, FIP was confirmed by autopsy including histopathology and immunohistochemistry of FCoV antigen in macrophages in tissue lesions. the control group included 11 cats for which FIP was initially considered an important differential based on the existence of one or more of the aforementioned clinical and/or laboratory changes. samples of mesenteric lymph nodes were obtained using a 21-G needle and a 5-mL syringe by aspirating lymph node material postmortem. enlarged lymph nodes were preferred to normal-sized ones, given that enlarged lymph nodes would also be sampled in a clinical antemortem setting. slides were dehydrated in ascending alcohol series and coverslipped using a xylene-based mounting medium. a positive tissue control (brain tissue from a cat with confirmed FIP affecting the central nervous system) was included in every immunocyto- and immunohistochemical staining protocol. samples were semi-quantitatively categorized as either low-yield positive (a few single macrophages with strong positive signal), medium-yield positive (approximately half of the macrophages with strong positive signal) or high-yield positive (majority of macrophages with strong positive signal) clinical signs, results of immunocytochemistry and final diagnosis for all 41 included cats. the study population reflected the cat population that is usually presented to a veterinary practice or clinic in which a clinician would consider FIP as a major differential diagnosis. s, pleural effusion \u2013 FIP 17 DSH, age unknown, FI Ascites, icterus, hyperglobulinemia ++ FIP 18 DSH, 10 y, MN Ascites + Lymphoma 19 BSH, 1 y, MI Pleural effusion \u2013 Lymphoma 20 DSH, 1 y, MI Neurologic signs, hyperglobulinemia + FIP 21 DSH, 8 wk, MI Ascites, ic us ++ FIP 37 DSH, 16 y, FN Ascites, icterus, hyperglobulinemia + FIP 38 Norwegian Forest Cat, 4 y, MN Ascites, icterus \u2013 FIP 39 DSH, 2 y, FN Icterus, neurologic signs \u2013 Cholangitis and cholecystitis, degenerative polioencephalopathy 40 Birman, 9 mo, MI Ascites, icterus tissue samples of various organs were obtained for immunohistochemical staining. samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and processed routinely. sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a graded alcohol series. the primary antibody, an anti-FCoV mouse monoclonal IgG 2A (FIPV 3-70; Linaris Biologische Produkte, Dossenheim, Germany) validated for ICC was applied. slides were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in a humidity chamber. all slides were assessed cytomorphologically and evaluated for cell harvest. only slides containing >50 nucleated cells were further evaluated. ICC-positive samples were further assessed considering yield of ICC-positive macrophages. ICC was positive in 16 of 30 cats with confirmed FIP. it was also positive in 1 of 11 control cats. the cat with the false-positive result suffered from lymphoma. false-positive results have been demonstrated in 2 studies evaluating immunostaining in effusions. specificity of ICC in CSF analysis has been shown to reach only 83%. in a fatal disease such as FIP, high specificity of a laboratory test is crucial. nonspecific binding of the antibody to non-FCoV antigens within the cytoplasm of macrophages could explain the false-positive result. we cannot exclude the possibility that the cat with the false-positive ICC result had comorbidity of lymphoma and early-stage FIP. mesenteric lymph nodes have been identified as harboring high levels of FIPV genomic RNA (gRNA) in cats with experimentally induced FIP. low-to-negative levels of FIPV gRNA were found in the kidneys and variable levels in the liver. sensitivity was lower than expected using mesenteric lymph node FNA in our study. cytologic staining in a pilot study proved to impact negatively on immunodetection of the FCoV nucleocapsid. sensitivity was falsely reduced because of degradation of cells and virus. internal true-negative controls, such as normal feline liver or kidney from a cat, were not included in the staining protocol. we defined samples as ICC-positive if at least 1 macrophage fulfilled the criteria for true-positive staining. potentially, low-yield positive staining could be a normal finding in non-FIP cats."}
