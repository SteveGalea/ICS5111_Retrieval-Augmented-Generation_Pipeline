{"summary": "trypanosoma brucei gambiense (T. b. gambiense) causes a human chronic infection. the other trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (T. b. rhodesiense) causes acute illness in people in eastern and southern africa. all existing anti-trypanosomal therapies suffer from unacceptable toxicity, poor efficacy, difficulties of administration, and increasing treatment failures due to the development of parasite resistance. no new drug has been developed for treatment of early-stage HAT, and only one drug has been developed for late-stage HAT. aromatic diamidines i.e. pentamidine (Figure 1) show their anti-parasitic action by binding strongly to AT-rich sequences in the minor groove of DNA. a number of diamidines have been crystallized with the DNA duplex d(CGCGAATTCGCGCGCGCGCGCG2) which provide valuable models for drug development in the diamidine series. pentamidine is a highly flexible molecule that can assume an array of linked conformations related through torsional rotation. it has been widely used as a drug in humans despite several adverse effects, such as hypotension, abdominal pain, vertigo, hypersalivation, nausea, and mild nephrotoxocity. the unsubstituted diamidine compound 64 (Figure 3a) with secondary amino group in place of oxygen atom exhibited subnanomolar activity (0.001 M) against T. b. rhodesiense. the diimidazoline compound 66 (Figure 3b) exhibited the second highest anti-trypanosomal activity in the series. pentamidine analogues with excellent in vitro activity were evaluated in vivo in the STIB900 mouse model of africa trypanosomiasis. compounds 12, 62 and 64 showed very poor in vivo activity. compound 32 and 66 showed excellent in vivo efficacies in the acute mouse model of trypanosomiasis, providing cures of all infected animals. the cationic moieties on the pyridine rings were lesser cytotoxic than the unsubstituted diamidines. the cationic fragments reduced the activity of compounds against T. brucei rhodesiense compared to pentamidine. the 2, 6-substituted dications (compounds 11\u201313, figure 4a) and 2,4-substituted dications (compounds 14\u201318, figure 4a) compound 6 and compound 66 have excellent in vitro activity (0.001M) better than pentamidine and melarsoprol. replacement of oxygen atoms in alkyl chain improves the activity against the T. b. rhodesiense parasite. benzofuran derivatives In the early 1970s Dann O et al reported the anti-trypanosomal properties of two bisbenzofuran diactions (Figure 5a & 5b) and two phenylbenzofuran (Figure 6a & 6b), but since then these compounds received very little attention. dicationic bisbenzofuran derivatives Tidwell RR et al found that the in vitro anti-trypanosomal activities of bisbenzofuran derivatives against trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense depended on the position and the type of cationic substituents. cytotoxicity against mammalian cells depended on the length of the carbon linker between aromatic moieties. the substitution on the amidine groups affects the anti-trypanosomal properties of bisbenzofurans. the molecules require further investigation to study the influence of the type of cationic substituents and the distance between aromatic moieties on uptake and intracellular distribution of dicationic bisbenzofurans. compound 2\u2032-position of compound 1 resulted into compound 20 (Figure 6a) and compound 32 (Figure 9c) with enhanced anti-trypanosomal activity and higher selectivity against T. b. rhodesiense. compound 32 and 20 showed exclellent in vivo activity providing 3/4 and 4/4 cures respectively when administered intraperitoneally. structure of pentamidine congeners bearing the benzofuran motif decreased with the substitution on cationic groups and increased with the elongation of the carbon linker. cytotoxicity of the compounds decreased with the substitution on cationic groups and increased with the elongation of the carbon linker. furamidine has shown promising results in clinical trials against HAT. two other analogues of furamidine have been evaluated against mouse model. one approach to enhance activity of furamidine has been the replacement of central furan ring with other heterocyclic systems. 3,5-bis(4-amidinophenyl)isoxazole is reported to have high activity against a murine T. brucei rhodesiense modelc [42] but most of these compounds have received very little attention since. recent optimization of the few of the compounds has been reported. compound 32 resulted into compound 41 (Figure 13b) with comparable anti-trypanosomal activity (4.2 nM) as that of furamidine. these compounds of the isoxazole series could be a candidate for further evaluation against animal models of the diseases. the compounds with cationic fragments in the 5,5\u2032-position were in most cases less potent against T. brucei rhodesiense than isomers bearing at least one cationic moiety in the 4- or 4\u2032-position. however compound 46 (Figure 15) with dicationic moiety at 4,4\u2032 position showed excellent in vitro activity (0.004 M) xazole and triazole derivatives of furamidine governed the anti-trypanosomal activity of the two series. position and the nature of the cationic substituent governed the anti-trypanosomal activity of the two series. 62 compounds were screened against the parasite T. brucei rhodesiense. a correlation between anti-trypanosomal activity and DNA binding affinity was observed, suggesting a possible mechanism of action for these compounds. compounds that showed excellent in vitro activity and high selectivity represent new anti-trypanosomal lead compounds. methylfuran group at R3 position was the most potent and significant TR inhibitor with TR inhibitory activity of 1.1 M. the replacement of methylfuran with other groups like furan, phenyl, pyridinyl, thiophene led to decrease in activity. the NH and NMe groups were equally active. 53 compounds were evaluated in vitro for their anti-trypanosomal activity. compound 9 showed better anti-trypanosomal activity (0.007 M) and low cytotoxicity (6.8 M) than melarsoprol (IC50 = 0.008M) topoisomerase inhibitors have evolved as an effective drug target in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. these enzymes mediate mechanistic interactions such as supercoiling, relaxation, knotting or catenating of DNA double helices. topoisomerases can be classified as type I enzymes, which break a single strand of the DNA helix during the catalytic cycle. compounds showed their anti-trypanosomal action by multiple mechanisms. they stabilize topoisomerase-DNA complexes in situ and may also impede topoisomerase binding to DNA. these agents markedly inhibited DNA synthesis by interfering with topoisomerase and possibly other DNA-metabolizing enzymes. some of the duPont compounds, developed as anti-tumour drugs, were highly active but also showed high cytotoxicity on HT-29 cells. in vivo results of these compounds were very poor, as none of the compounds evaluated produced cure of mice in dose escalation experiment up to 100mg/kg i.p. DFMO + nifurtimox are superior to DFMO + melarsoprol and melarsoprol. initial clinical study has shown that DFMO + nifurtimox are superior to DFMO + melarsoprol and melarsoprol. substituted polyamines carry 1,3,5-triazine units as potential anti-trypanosomal drugs. lead structure A was used as a starting point for the synthesis of two series of analogues. in the first series, the influence of structural changes of the central core unit was investigated. the compounds showed poor in vivo activity producing no cure. concentrations greater than 10 mg kg1 induced severe acute toxicity. the actual mode of action for the reported triazine substituted polyamines remains unclear. carbon 5\u2032 does not exhibit an inhibitory effect on human or parasite forms of the enzyme and displays only marginal antiviral activity in comparison to analogues which have been unmodified at 6-amino position. therefore these compounds require further structural modification to develop newer class of anti-trypanosomal compounds with improved activity against T. brucei. azole derivative leads to a six fold reduction in activity as compared to the most potent compound. substitution with nitrophenyl or aminophenyl also results in strong reduction in activity. further substitution with an ethylene group reduces potency up to 4-fold or 18-fold respectively. aza-analogues of furamidine show excellent activity on intravenous dosing. aza-analogues of furamidine exhibit high in vitro activity against T. b. rhodesiense. prodrugs with the methyl analogue were most susceptible to metabolism. analogues (8c) show excellent oral activity in vivo. they are superior to that of furamidine, 2,5-Bis[4-(methoxyamidino)phenyl]furan and 2,5-bis[4-(N-hydroxyamidinophenyl]furan. ring systems have good in vitro activity against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense [87, 88] dicationic N-isopropylguanidino-9H-fluorene (12c, Figure 33) showed promising in vivo biological results by giving 4/4 cures of the treated animals in the STIB900 animal model for africa trypanosomiasis. a number of diamidine compounds have been crystallized with the DNA duplex d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 which provide valuable models for drug development in the diamidine series. these drugs penetrate deeply into the groove and fit snugly between the walls of the groove. their amidines form H-bonds with thymine-O2 and/or adenine-N3 acceptor groups on the edges of the bases at the floor of the groove. pentamidine analogues were synthesized by Tidwell RR et al [24] by introducing substitutions on the cationic groups, changing the position of dications from 4,4\u2032 to 3,3\u2032 position, changing the length of the aliphatic chain between the aromatic rings. the unsubstituted diamidine compound 64 showed subnanomolar activity (0.001 M) against T. b. rhodesiense and was nearly twice as selective compounds 12\u201319 exhibited lower anti-trypanosomal activity compared to pentamidine. compound 12 with three methylene linker between aromatic rings had same in vitro activity as that of pentamidine (0.007 M) pyridyl analogues of pentamidine increased efficacies of pyridyl analogues of 2,5-bis(4-amidinophenoxy)furan (furamidine) increased efficacies of pyridyl analogues of pentamidine increased efficacies of pyridyl analogues. this replacement resulted in series of 18 compounds, most of which had lower cytotoxicity than pent compound 6 showed promising anti-trypanosomal activity (0.001M) and lower cytotoxicity (4.90M) than pentamidine and melarsoprol, but had poor in vivo activity giving only 1/4 cures in the STIB900 mouse model. compound 9 showed excellent in vivo activity curing four out of four animals upon oral administration in STIB900 mouse model. pentamidine and melarsoprol have high selective against the T. b. rhodesiense parasite as evident from their selectivity index (SI of compound 6 = 4900 and compound 66 = 34500 M) the oxygen atom in the aliphatic linker and the amidine groups are important for anti-trypanosomal activity of pentamidine. a series of 49 diactionic 2-phenylbenzofuran derivatives were included in a benzofuran structural motif. Tidwell RR et al also synthesized a series of 49 diactionic 2-phenylbenzofuran derivatives. dicationic bisbenzofuran derivatives were less cytotoxic than compounds bearing substituents in the 4- or 6-positions. lead compound 8 exhibited in vitro anti-trypanosomal activity (0.008 M) compared to pentamidine and melarsoprol. some compounds from Tidwell series showed reduced cytotoxicity profile. however, how the substitution on the amidine groups affects the anti-trypanosomal properties of bisbenzofurans has not been explained. the 5,-substituted dicationic compounds 29 (IC50=0.002 M, Figure 9e) and 32 (IC50=0.002 M, Figure 9c) showed better anti-trypanosomal activity than the 6-substituted dicationic compound 38 (IC50=0.003 M, Figure 9d) selectivity against the parasite of 5,5\u2032-substituted dications was higher than 5,4\u2032-substituted congeners. pentamidine congeners incorporated the benzofuran ring into molecules of pentamidine-related analogues. most of the compounds in the series showed cytotoxicity less than pentamidine, but had lesser potency and selectivity index as compared to pentamidine. cytotoxicity of the compounds decreased with the substitution on cationic groups and increased with the elongation of the carbon linker. the 2-phenylbenzofuran derivatives are attractive molecules because of their high activity, low cytotoxicity and high selectivity against the HAT parasite. the introduction of phenoxy fragment into the aromatic ring protects the phenylbenzofuran dervatives from metabolic deactivation. the diamidine and the hydroxy or methoxy group may be involved in binding to the DNA minor groove. eighteen substituted 2,5-bis(4-guanylphenyl)furans and related analogues have produced cures in mice at submilligram dosage levels. six compounds have produced cures in mice at submilligram dosage levels and have been somewhat more active in this screen than stilbamidine. the compounds with at least one p-amidine moiety displayed good IC50 values. loss in potency was observed in compounds with substituted diamidine at m-position. the introduction of nitro, chloro, or methoxy substituents on either aromatic ring resulted in decreased anti-trypanosomal activity. fragment was used because it was a suitable isosteric replacement for the central five-membered ring of furamidine [45\u201355] and because 1,4-diphenyl-1,2,3-triazoles showed geometrical resemblance to furamidine. but the placement of the cationic moiety in the 4-position increased the cytotoxicities of diamidines 46. most active compound 46 of the series with promising anti-trypanosomal properties. in general the para substituted diamidines in both the series were the most promising compounds with good activity than that of furamidine. compounds1c, 28b, 32b and 41b showed excellent in vitro activity. compounds bearing 2-aminoimidazoline cations had higher selectivity for the parasite. a correlation between anti-trypanosomal activity and DNA binding affinity was observed. the unsubstituted diamidine compound 64 showed subnanomolar activity (0.001 M) against T. b. rhodesiense. the diimidazoline compound 66 showed the second highest anti-trypanosomal activity in the series with the IC50 value of 0.001 M. compounds 12, 62 and 64 showed very poor in vivo activity. compound 32 and 66 showed excellent in vivo efficacies in the acute mouse model of trypanosomiasis. pentamidine analogues were synthesized using pyridyl fragments. the phenyl rings of pentamidine were replaced with pyridyl fragments. this resulted in series of 18 compounds, most of which had lower cytotoxicity than pentamidine. compound 9 did not provide cure in the STIB900 mouse model of infection. but its BBB permeability could be improved by developing prodrug using lipophillic substitution as used in compound 9. excellent in vitro activity of diamidine 6 and high in vivo efficacy of its prodrug diamidoxime 9 warrant further investigation of these dications. pentamidine as these groups were part of recognition motif for P2 amino purine transporter in trypanosoma species. in case of compound 66 the amidine groups have been replaced by imidazoline and the oxygen atom has been replaced by secondary amino groups. this is in accordance with recently reported work [29] according to which there is no direct connection between the affinity for P2 carrier and anti-trypanosomal activity. dicationic bisbenzofuran derivatives Tidwell RR et al found that the in vitro anti-trypanosomal activities of bisbenzofuran derivatives against trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense depended on the position and the type of cationic substituents. cytotoxicity against mammalian cells depended on the length and the type of cationic substituents as well as the length of the carbon linker between aromatic cytotoxicity profile compared to pentamidine decreased as number of methylene groups in the alkyl bridge increased. however, how the substitution on the amidine groups affects the anti-trypanosomal properties of bisbenzofurans has not been explained. selectivity against the parasite of 5,5\u2032-substituted dications was higher than 5,4\u2032-substituted congeners. compound 20 (Figure 9a) and compound 32 (Figure 9c) with enhanced anti-trypanosomal activity and higher selectivity against T. b. rhodesiense. in the series cytotoxicity decreased with the substitution on cationic groups and increased with the elongation of the carbon linker. cytotoxicity of the compounds depended on the nature of the cationic substituents, the placement of the benzofuran motif, and the length of the carbon linker. a prodrug of furamidine, 2,5-bis[4-(N-methoxy)amidinophenyl]furan (pafuramidine) has shown promising results in clinical trials against HAT [36]. two other analogues of furamidine have been evaluated against T. b. rhodesiense mouse model. in 1994 Boykin DW et al have reported the synthesis of dicationic diaryltriazines nucleic acid binding agents. in 1998 Boykin DW et al have also reported the anti-Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia activity of dicationic diaryl methylprimidines. the introduction of nitro, chloro, or methoxy substituents on either aromatic ring resulted in decreased anti-trypanosomal activity (4.2 nM) as that of furamidine. these compounds of the isoxazole series that showed good in vitro anti-trypanosomal activity (4.2 nM) as that of furamidine. the placement of the cationic moiety in the 4-position increased the cytotoxicities of diamidines 46. however, most unsubstituted diamidines showed higher in vitro activities against T. brucei rhodesiense than bis(N-isopropyl)amidines and diimidazolines. promising in vitro and in vivo anti-trypanosomal activity of cationic 1,4-diphenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazoles derivatives and in particular compound 46 necessitate further investigation of this class of compounds as potential anti-trypanosomal drug candidates. in general the para substituted diamidines in both the series were the most promising compounds with good activity than that of furamidine. compounds bearing 2-aminoimidazoline cations had higher selectivity for the parasite. a correlation between anti-trypanosomal activity and DNA binding affinity was observed. series 1 was based on the quinoline scaffold (Figure 18a) in which compound 2 with methylfuran group at R3 position, Br at 6th position of quinoline ring and N-methylethanamine group at R1 position was the most potent and significant TR inhibitor with TR inhibitory activity of 1.1 M. at 4th position the NH and NMe groups were equally active. a total of 53 compounds were evaluated in vitro for their anti-trypanosomal activity and cytotoxicity. compound 9 showed better anti-trypanosomal activity (0.007 M) and low cytotoxicity (6.8 M) compound 10a and its prodrug 10a have promising anti-trypanosomal properties. Efforts are also undertaken to further elucidate the metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and the anti-trypanosomal mechanism of action of this novel and promising class of compounds. testing of indenoisoquinolines with promising activity on mouse leukemia cells revealed all the compounds were more effective against trypanosomes than against mammalian cells. the indenoisoquinolines showed appreciable water solubility indicating that these compounds have good quality for drug development. ebo 8g and Kanebo 8h were also active, with IC50 concentrations in the range of 300 ng/ml up to 900 ng/ml. some of the duPont compounds, developed as anti-tumour drugs, were highly active but also showed high cytotoxicity on HT-29 cells. the in vivo results of these compounds were very poor, as none of the compounds evaluated produced cure of mice. DFMO is the most recently developed agent for late stage T. b. gambiense and T. b. brucei sleeping sickness, but has not been active against all strains of T. b. rhodesiense. the major drawback of DFMO are its cost, the duration of treatment and its availability. the compounds were designed to selectively target the interior of T. brucei via the P2 amino-purine transporter. in the first series the compound containing the n-dodecyl chain showed weak activity against T. b. rhodesiense. methylamino substituted triazines attached to the C9- or C12-(compound 8f, Figure 27) polyamine precursor resulted in most active trypanocidal compounds(IC50 of 8c = 0.27M and 8f = 0.18 M) the compounds showed poor in vivo activity producing no cure to the infected mice. this class of 6-N-cyclopropyl adenosine analogues modified at carbon 5\u2032 does not exhibit an inhibitory effect on human or parasite forms of the enzyme. this class of 6-n-cyclopropyl adenosine analogues modified at carbon 5\u2032 does not exhibit an inhibitory effect on human or parasite forms of the enzyme. therefore these compounds require further structural modification in order to develop newer analogues with improved activity against T. bru the pyrazol ring is the most potent anti-trypanosomals of the series. the substitution of pyrazol ring with isoxazole derivative leads to a six fold reduction in activity compared to the most potent compound. substitution with nitrophenyl or aminophenyl also results in strong reduction in activity. trypanothione reductase (TR) restores the oxidized trypanothione to reduced state. many inhibitors of this enzyme have been developed but most combat with problems related to bioavailability and pharmacokinetics. methyl and ethyl group showed activity while the H and chain extensions to propyl, butyl and cyclopentane led to the decrease in activity. quinoline compounds with promising activity could serve as lead compounds for further development of targeted drugs against trypanosomiasis. compounds carrying aliphatic or a 2-phenylacetyl ester side chains were as potent and selective as their benzoylated counterparts. however compound 9a was unstable due to auto-oxidation, so the unstable alcohols were esterified to generate prodrug 10a. compound 10a can serve as lead compound for further investigation of this class of molecules as potential candidates against HAT. topoisomerases are subdivided into type IA and type IB. most of the compounds showed in vitro activity at submicromolar concentrations. compound 12 with propylamino group at R6 and methoxy group at R2, R3 and R9 was the most active one with in vitro anti-trypanosomal activity of 0.05 M. indenoisoquinoline compound 12 is a promising lead for the development of drugs against sleeping sickness. the compounds are specific inhibitors of topoisomerases, against cultured bloodstream forms of T. b. rhodesiense. the modifications in the quinolone core nucleus led to characteristic in vitro activity and toxicity. vivo ineffectiveness had not been explained and no drug level determination was performed in the plasma of the treated mice. polyamine metabolism inhibitors polyamines are generally involved in growth and differentiation. DFMO is the most recently developed agent for late stage T. b. gambiense and T. b. brucei sleeping sickness. the DFMO + nifurtimox regimen (NECT regimen) allowed reduction in DFMO regimen from 14 to 7 days (56 versus 28 infusions) with a 94% cure rate. success of the combined regimen has been most likely due to ability of DMFO to reduce trypanothione levels and resistance to oxidative stress. monosubstituted compounds showed a slight increase in activity against T. b. rhodesiense compared to the disubstituted compounds. the compounds showed poor in vivo activity producing no cure to the infected mice and concentrations greater than 10 mg kg1 induced severe acute toxicity. the 5\u2032-deoxy-5\u2032-(E)-(iodomethylene)adenosine (EIDDHA) and its 6-N cyclopropyl analogue have shown promising in vitro inhibitory activity against T. brucei. the use of adenosine analogues as anti-parasitics should be explored as a therapeutic paradigm. the synthesis of 4-[5-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-2H-pyrazol-3-yl]morpholine derivatives by Perozzo R et al [80] resulted in the discovery of newer class of anti-trypanosomal compounds having stage specific action. the two compounds, 4-[3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl]morpholine (1.0M) and 1-[3-(4- OH-blocked glutathione diesters are the most active inhibitors of T. brucei parasites. N-acetyl-S-benzyloxy-carbonylglutathione dimethyl ester and the N,S-benzyloxy-carbonylglutathione diester derivatives represent lead structures possessing minimal toxicity. prodrugs with the O-methyl analogue were most susceptible to metabolism. larger O-n-butyl and O-n-hexyl groups were least susceptible to metabolism. prodrugs with larger side-chains did not completely cure the mice. mes of a number of diamidine systems are effective prodrugs. compound 10b and 10d showed good activity in the range of 2 nM. compound 10b had lower cytotoxicity profile but had very poor in vivo activity. the carbamate prodrugs gave promising results with 4/4 cures on oral administration in the STIB900 mouse model. results showed that these compounds bind strongly to the DNA minor groove, but do not have high antiparasitic activity. prodrugs with the O-methyl analogue were most susceptible to metabolism while larger O-n-butyl and O-n-hexyl groups were least susceptible to metabolism. several prodrugs of these aza-analogues (8c) show excellent oral activity in vivo. they are superior to that of furamidine, 2,5-Bis[4-(methoxyamidino)phenyl]furan and 2,5-bis[4-(N-hydroxyamidinophenyl]furan. they have found several excellent candidates for further evaluation. alkylguanidine, and reversed amidine derivatives of fused ring systems have good in vitro activity against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. the dicationic N-isopropylguanidino-9H-fluorene (12c, Figure 33) showed promising in vivo biological results by giving 4/4 cures of the treated animals in the STIB900 animal model for africa trypanosomiasis. computer-assisted drug design approaches based on ligand-based and structure-based drug design have been successfully employed to develop new drugs for the treatment of cancer, AIDS and other diseases. the results have been used as a guide to design compounds that, potentially, have better activity against african trypanosomes. the information can be used to predict new compounds for synthesis that have high probability of enhanced activity. the information can be used to predict new compounds for synthesis that have high probability of enhanced activity. liers is eq 1 with an R2= 0.84 and F= 12.0 Log = 2.57 log P + 1.87 Es + 0.20 MW 0.002 W 102 (1) Equation 1 indicates that the therapeutic activity of these compounds decreases with increasing values of log P and Es. the study should be helpful in developing new compounds with improved efficacy and oral bioavailability. authors have also designed some molecules which showed good activity in silico. the further study of these compounds is in progress. the newer analogues of furamidine also show promising anti-trypanosomal activity along with lower cytotoxicity than furamidine. thus strong activity against T. b. rhodesiense indicates that these compounds should be further evaluated. authors' statement Competing Interests The author declares no conflict of interest Competing Interests The author declares no conflict of interest."}
