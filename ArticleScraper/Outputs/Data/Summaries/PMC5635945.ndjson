{"summary": "a mechanistic framework explains the activity and selectivity of linear cationic antimicrobial peptides in membranes. these molecules have the potential to be developed into highly potent and selective pharmaceuticals. this framework could underpin strategies for the rational design of therapeutic agents. chanosensitivity in a eukaryotic ion channel remains unclear. the asymmetric structure of this channel enables it to sense such a broad profile of forces within the membrane. these results help us understand how eukaryotic ion channels respond to a rich variety of stimuli. sirt7 knockout mice contain a significantly diminished amount of WAT due to the increased Sirt1 activity and Sirt1 inhibition restores WAT in Sirt7 knockout mice. study shows that simulating postnatal switch promoted a switch in metabolism, DNA damage response, and cell cycle arrest in hPSC-CM. small genome symbiont underlies cuticle hardness in beetles Hisashi Anbutsu, Minoru Moriyama, Naruo Nikoh, Takahiro Hosokawa, Ryo Futahashi, Masahiko Tanahashi, Xian-Ying Meng, Takashi Kuriwa tyrosine provisioning is needed for insect\u2019s cuticle formation and hardening. host-encoded aminotransferases up-regulated in the bacteriome. symbiont suppression by an antibiotic and RNA interference induce reddish and soft weevils. the [PSI+] prion of baker\u2019s yeast is a filamentous polymer (amyloid) of the Sup35 protein, producing readthrough of translation termination and different degrees of growth slowing. we show that certain inositol polyphosphates and pyrophosphates promote the propagation of the [PSI+] prion and that an inositol pyrophosphate pyrophosphatase has an antiprion effect. mRNA transcripts for mIgM are always more dominant than mIgG1. these isotype-specific expression differences contribute to B cell regulation. IL-4\u2013producing B cells regulate T helper cell dichotomy. leishmaniasis and schistosomiasis are neglected tropical diseases. there are no effective vaccines and limited treatment strategies. to develop vaccine and therapeutic alternatives, a detailed understanding of host immunity is essential. a knock-in mouse with a targeted mutation predicted to abolish the signaling motif of the inhibitory receptor Ly49A. this mutant mouse revealed multiple mechanisms by which inhibitory receptor signaling controls NK-cell self-tolerance that could impact the efficacy of checkpoint blockade of NK cells. uro Mendoza, Inna Astapova, Hiroaki Shimizu, Molly R. Gallop, Lujain Al-Sowaimel, S. M. Dileas MacGowan, Tim Bergmann, Anders H. Berg, Danielle E. Tenen, Christopher Jacobs, Anna Lyubetskaya, Linus Tsai, and Anthony N. Hollenberg Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) mediate the genomic actions of thyroid hormone endometrium of women with severe preeclampsia (PE) was detected at the time of delivery and persisted years after the affected pregnancy. the transcriptional signature of the defect could enable its detection before (or after) conception, which would aid development of therapies focused on improving decidualization. human pathogen group A Streptococcus produces a potent secreted protease, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB) that is crucial for pathogenesis. we identify a GAS-encoded short leaderless intercellular peptide signal [SpeB-inducing peptide] and define the mechanism by which SIP induces population-wide SpeB production. IP provides a framework for the identification of leaderless peptide signals in other microorganisms. the data reveal a paradigm of bacterial signaling and identify previously unknown molecules that may serve as therapeutic targets. merS-CoV spike protein selectively binds to sialic acid (Sia) Rashmi Voleti, Diana R. Tomchick, Thomas C. S\u00fcdhof, and Josep Rizo synaptotagmins-1 and -7, act as ca2+ sensors for the fast and slow components of neurotransmitter release. this paper suggests an explanation for this apparent contradiction, showing that the C2A domain dominates binding of synaptotagmin-7 to membranes. this paper suggests an explanation for this apparent contradiction, showing that the C2A domain dominates binding of synapt the molecular basis for this regulation has remained unclear for a decade. we found that BPMs are long-sought factors responsible for DREB2A degradation. exposure to seismic air gun signals causes physiological harm and alters behavior."}
