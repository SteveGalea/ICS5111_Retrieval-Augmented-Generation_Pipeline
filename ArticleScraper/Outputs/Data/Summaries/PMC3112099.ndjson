{"summary": "china is at greatest risk of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 due to its huge population and high residential density. a close-ended questionnaire was applied to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices of pandemic among 10,669 responders recruited from seven urban and two rural areas. public education campaign may take the side effects of vaccine and the knowledge about the state's vaccination strategy into account. the world health organization raised its pandemic alert level to the highest level, phase 6 [2], meaning that the A/H1N1 flu had spread in more than two continents. there were few public reports on the assessment of the effect of these policies and the level of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) associating with A/H1N1 among general population. confusion and negative attitude towards the emerging communicable disease may lead to unnecessary worry and chaos, even excessive panic which would aggravate the disease epidemic. sample size This current study was carried out in three phases during the peak season of A/H1N1. the first phase was from 30 November 2009 to 27 December 2009, the second from 4 January 2010 to 24 January 2010, and the third from 24 February to 25 March in 2010. the majority of the questions were closed-ended and variables were categorical, except age. there were seven questions related to the knowledge of A/H1N1, four referred to the attitude and five concerning about the practice in this questionnaire. ing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Jingzhou, Xi'an, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, shenzhen cities. Xi'an in the northwest of China is the provincial capital of Shanxi province. shenzhen of the Guangdong province is in the southeast of china. telephone interviews were conducted from 6:30 pm to 10:00 pm to avoid over-presenting the non-work population. the majority of the questions were closed-ended and variables were categorical, except age. the inclusion criteria were: age18 and proper communication skills. 10669 questionnaires in total were eligible for analysis. the mean age of all respondents was 41.47 years (over range: 18-90 year). of all respondents, 54.4% were female, and 42.4% had received college or above education (Table 1). more than half knew prevention and control strategies for pandemic influenza in china. 72.2% knew that A/H1N1 vaccination was free of charge. 68.2% informed about the state's initial vaccination strategy. know the state's initial vaccination strategy 7280(68.2) 3389(31.8) - Attitudes: 1.
