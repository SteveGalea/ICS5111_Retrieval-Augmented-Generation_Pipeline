{"summary": "Background Acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among young children and adults in developing countries, especially in africa. the majority of ARI's coronaviruses are associated with upper respiratory tract infections in developing countries. HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E belong to the alphacoronaviruses, while HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) belong to the betacoronaviruses. despite the detection of MERS-CoV-related sequences in bats worldwide, the evolutionary source of this novel HCoV remains unclear. study aims to provide information on the association of HCoVs with upper respiratory tract infections in remote rural areas of Ghana. the study was approved by the committee for human research, publications and ethics of KATH and School of Medical Sciences, KNUST, Kumasi, Ashanti region, Ghana (Ethical clearance reference: CHRPE 49/09). the study was performed in three rural areas of Ghana from September 2011 to September 2012. the Techiman municipality is among the 22 administrative districts in the region. subjects were selected as controls if they did not present with any symptom of upper respiratory illness for at least 8 days prior to recruitment. subjects were excluded if they were less than 10 years old, had a history of epistaxis or refused clinical samples to be collected. nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from 90% of all study subjects. the swabs were stored in 1.5 ml RNAlater (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) they were frozen at 20\u00b0C until testing. HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 multiplex RT-PCR testing was similarly performed except that 400 nM of each forward and reverse primers were used. the amplification procedure comprised reverse transcription at 55\u00b0C for 20 min followed by initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 3 min and 45 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s and 58\u00b0C for 30 s.

HCoV detection rates in control subjects were compatible with prolonged excretion of very low levels of viral RNA after convalescence. the overall detection rate for all HCoVs including HCoV-NL63 and -HKU1 was now higher among cases compared to control subjects. the trend was similar for cases and controls with HCoV-OC43 detection. HCoV-NL63 median concentration was however significantly higher in cases compared to controls. the virus load of cases and controls was analysed in different communities. high proportions of HCoVs were identified in the harmattan season (54/215, 25.1%) compared to the wet (80/516, 15.5%) seasons (p = 0.003) the increase of detection of HCoVs was also significant compared to detections in the pre-harmattan season (1.3%, p0.01) and the interim season (7.2%, p0.0004) a representative sample of the encountered viruses was sequenced. sequences resembling the homologous spike gene portions of bat-associated HCoV-229E-related coronaviruses previously described by our group in animals sampled in the study area were not detected. total of 1213 subjects recruited during the study period. major recruitments were done in the pre-harmattan (385, 32%), harmattan (215, 18%) and wet seasons (516, 43%) and minor recruitment was done in the pre-wet season (97, 8%). overall four 487 (40%) were enrolled in 2011 and 726 (60%) were enrolled in 2012. the overall detection of HCoVs was 12.4% (150/1213) single virus detections occurred in 146 samples (12.0%) multiple detections occurred in 4 samples (0.3%). the most prevalent virus identified was HCoV-NL63 (82 detections, 6.8%), HCoV-OC43 (18, 1.5%) then HCoV-HKU1 (5, 0.4%). HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were more frequently encountered in cases than in controls whereas HCoV-NL63 was more common in control subjects. the results for all virus detections in cases and controls did not change significantly when cases showing co-infections with multiple CoV were excluded from the analysis. es Control group Case group Total p-value n = 620 n = 593 1213 HCoV-229E n (%) 7 (1.1) 35 (5.9) 42 (3.5) 0.001 HCoV-HKU1 n (%) 0 (0) 3 (0.5) 3 (0.2) 0.23 HCoV-NL63 n (%) 20 (3.2) 20 (3.4) 40 (3.3) 1 HCoV-OC43 n (%) 3 ( study areas are represented on the x-axis and the y-axis shows the log10 of HCoV-NL63 concentration in copies per RT-PCR reaction. significant differences in viral loads between healthy and control subjects were detected for only the Forikrom community. HCoVs were identified in 88 (12.8%) individuals in the low social contact group and 58 (11.1%) in the high social contact group. there was no significant difference (p = 0.42) in the proportion of the overall HCoVs detected in the two groups. HCoVs contribute significantly to the burden of upper respiratory tract infections. most developed countries have investigated the molecular and epidemiological profile of these viruses. the few published data were mostly from hospitalised subjects under five years. this scenario cannot be ruled out, especially because HCoV-NL63 has generally been associated with mild respiratory infection. lower levels of virus replication in controls as opposed to cases are also suggested by diverging levels of virus concentration particularly for HCoV-NL63. our study recorded high detection rates of HCoVs in the harmattan and the wet seasons compared to the other seasons. possible explanations for this include seasonal variations in host immune status to infection [47] and changes in humidity which increase viral survival in the environment. viruses are frequently detected in healthy control subjects. the use of pure virological diagnostic data is a caveat."}
