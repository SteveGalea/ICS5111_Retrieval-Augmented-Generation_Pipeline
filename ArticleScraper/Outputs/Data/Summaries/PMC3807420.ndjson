{"summary": "MERS-CoV has infected at least 77 people and was able to be transmitted from human to human. the genomic sequence of MERS-CoV is closely related to the sequences of certain bat coronaviruses (3\u20135) some coronaviruses from each of the three genera recognize sugars (17\u201320) some MHV strains also recognize heparan sulfate (15, 16) the boundaries of the C-domain and proposed receptor-binding motif were determined by sequence and structural comparisons with the SARS-CoV S1 subunit. the core structure is in cyan, and the proposed RBM region is in red. the identified MERS-CoV RBD also has therapeutic implications. crystals of the MERS-CoV C-domain were harvested in buffer containing 25% (vol/vol) polyethylene glycol, 27% (vol/vol) PEG 3350, 0.2 MgCl2 and 0.1 M bis-Tris (pH 7.0) after 2 weeks, crystals were harvested in buffer containing 25% (vol/vol) ethylene glycol, 27% (vol/vol) PEG 3350, 0.2 MgCl2 and 0.1 M bis-Tris ( vero cells were infected with recombinant MERS-CoV C-domain for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. unbound viruses were washed with 1 phosphate-buffered saline. HEK293T cells transiently expressing human DPP4 were infected by pseudotyped virus in the presence of 20 g/ml MERS-CoV C-domain. infection efficiency was quantified 48 h postinfection by measuring -galactosidase activity. C-domain (residues 367 to 588) was expressed in insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac expression system (Invitrogen) the protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml and stored in buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4) and 200 mM NaCl. after 2 weeks, crystals of the MERS-CoV C-domain were harvested in buffer containing 25% (vol/vol) polyethylene glycol, 27% (vol/ X-ray diffraction data were processed using HKL2000 (31) sixteen iodine sites were identified with the program HYSS (32) followed by phase refinement and solvent flattening with RESOLVE. HEK293T cells transiently expressing human DPP4 in pcDNA3.1(+) were infected by pseudotyped virus in the presence of 20 g/ml MERS-CoV C-domain or bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 48 h posttransfection, virus supernatants were harvested and concentrated 20 times using amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter units. cDNA3.1(+) vector or pcDNA3.1(+) vector containing the human DPP4 gene. cells were harvested and lysed in PBS with 300 mM NaCl and 0.25% SDS. the protein complex was precipitated with Ni-NTA agarose. recombinant MERS-CoV C-domain inhibits MERS-CoV infection of permissive monkey cells. recombinant MERS-CoV C-domain completely inhibits MERS-CoV infection. coV C-domain pulled down human DPP4 from cells that express human DPP4. results suggest that the recombinant MERS-CoV C-domain interacts directly with cell surface human DPP4 and competes with virus surface MERS-CoV spike protein. lysate was mixed with the MERS-CoV C-domain containing a C-terminal His6 tag. the C-domain/DPP4 complex was then precipitated with Ni-NTA beads. the structure was determined using an iodine derivative obtained by a short cryosoak. the crystal structure of the MERS-CoV RBD contains a core structure and an accessory subdomain. the core structure is a five-stranded antiparallel -sheet with several short -helices. the eight cysteines in the RBD form four disulfide bonds. the accessory subdomain of the SARS-CoV RBD contains a core structure and an accessory subdomain. the two core structures are highly similar, both consisting of a five-stranded antiparallel -sheet. the same region in the MERS-CoV RBD mainly consists of loops. ARS-CoV have diverged in their RBMs to recognize different receptors. these C-domains include HCoV-NL63 RBD complexed with human ACE2 (PDB 3KBH), PRCV RBD complexed with porcine APN (4F5C), and SARS-CoV RBD complexed with human ACE2 (2AJF). HCoV-NL63 and PCRV RBDs contain a -sandwich core structure. the Z scores between MERS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 RBDs and between MERS-CoV and PRCV RBDs are both less than zero. despite their different tertiary structures, these C-domains are located in the same region of their S1 subunits. a closer inspection of these coronavirus C-domains reveals that the MERS-CoV RBD has a structural topology related to those of -coronaviruses. the evolutionary relationship between MERS-CoV and -coronavirus C-domains may be explained by the location of the C-domain on the tip of the trimeric spike protein. this study has successfully positioned MERS-CoV RBD on the landscape of coronavirus evolution. MERS-CoV RBD functions as an effective inhibitor of MERS-CoV entry. SARS-CoV C-domain contains eight essential cysteines that form four disulfide bonds (24) the protein was expressed and purified using the protocol that we used for the SARS-CoV C-domain. the recombinant MERS-CoV C-domain inhibits MERS-CoV infection of permissive monkey cells. the inhibition efficiency increased with the concentration of MERS-CoV C-domain. the recombinant MERS-CoV C-domain completely inhibits MERS-CoV infection. HEK293T cells transiently expressing human DPP4 were infected with different amount of pseudotyped virus alone. at 48 h posttransfection, cells were harvested and lysed. -galactosidase activity of cell lysate infected with 10 l pseudotyped virus alone was taken as 100%. 212121 Cell dimensions a, b, c (45.361, 108.065, 124.287 45.822, 108.817, 124.328,, (\u00b0) 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90 Resolution () 50\u20132.13 (2.17\u20132.13) 50\u20132.32 (2.36\u20132.32) Rsym or Rmerge 0.065 (0.459) 0.119 (0.574) I/I 31.8 (2.0) 18.3 (2.0) core structure and asn487 in the accessory subdomain, respectively. the tertiary structure is stabilized by disulfide bonds and glycans. the two core structures are highly similar, both consisting of a 5-stranded antiparallel -sheet. accessory subdomain of -coronavirus S1 C-domains has been shown to be a hypervariable region that -coronaviruses often use for receptor recognition. the same region in MHV often contains long insertions or deletions, depending on the MHV strain. accessory subdomain is the most exposed and protruding region on the whole spike protein. this region is easily accessible to potential host receptors. -coronaviruses can take advantage of increased evolution rate in this region to screen for and switch to new receptors. tertiary structures of coronavirus C-domains are located in the same region of their S1 subunits. -strands are depicted as arrows and -helices as cylinders. the secondary structures of all of the coronavirus C-domains are colored and numbered in the same way as for the HCoV-NL63 C-domain. all coronavirus C-domains likely share an evolutionary origin. they have diverged into the -sandwich core structure in -coronaviruses and the -sheet core structure in -coronaviruses. the three RBM loops in -coronaviruses further diverged into ACE2-binding RBMs in HCoV-NL63 and APN-binding RBMs in PRCV. ADDENDUM During the submission and review of the present study, two other studies independently mapped the MERS-CoV RBD fragments (residues 358 to 588 and 377 to 662), both of which are similar to the one identified in the present study (residues 367 to 588). this study may be used to control the transmission of MERS-CoV in humans. ii) the therapeutic implications of MERS-CoV RBDs. both issues are critical for understanding and controlling MERS-CoV."}
