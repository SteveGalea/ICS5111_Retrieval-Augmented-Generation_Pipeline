{"summary": "Tilapia lake virus (TiLV) causes high mortality rates in wild and farmed tilapia. it is an icosahedral virus made of a trilaminar capsid with a diameter of 55\u2013110 nm. its genome is made of -ssRNA consisting of 10 segments. segment 1 has weak homology with the influenza virus C PB1 subunit. hemagglutinins (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), inserted into the lipid bilayer, protrude from the outer surface as spikes. HAs play vital roles in virus entry by binding to sialic acid (Sia) on epithelial cell surfaces. NA cleaves sialic acid on virion proteins to prevent clumping. the HA assay is based on the principle of hemagglutination. HA binds to Sia receptors on RBCs, forming lattices that keep RBCs in suspension. the ability of TiLV to agglutinate RBCs from tilapia or other host species has not been determined. we found that TiLV did not agglutinate RBCs from any of the species included in the present study, suggesting an absence of surface proteins with hemagglutination properties. resistance toward lysosomotropic agents indicated that the viral uptake mechanisms were independent of acidification. the virus supernatant harvested from each flask was filtered at a size of 22 m for 10 min. each virus was stored at 80 \u00b0C until use. titer for influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8 (PR8) was determined using the HA assay. cleic acids were amplified using primers specific to each virus. PCR reactions were carried out using the Qiagen kit according to manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. whole blood in the Alsever\u2019s solution from turkey, tilapia, and salmon was washed in PBS to remove plasma, leaving RBCs for the HA assay. for washing, 5 mL of RBCs was diluted in 45 mL PBS at room temperature, followed by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C; the supernatant was discarded. the plate was monitored for hemagglutination at room temperature for 60 min. wells showing a uniform reddish color of RBC suspension were regarded as positive for the HA assay. the highest dilution showing a uniform reddish color was regarded as the HA titer of the virus tested. cells were treated with NH4Cl during virus adsorption. post-adsorption treatment was done at 1, 2, or 3 h post-infection. cell culture flasks were gently tilted to ensure uniform distribution of the virus solution on the cell monolayer. cell culture flasks infected with TiLV were cultured at 28 \u00b0C, while ISAV-infected flasks were cultured at 15 \u00b0C. virus supernatant harvested from each flask was filtered at a size of 22 m to remove cell debris. titer for influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8 (PR8) was determined using the HA assay. cDNA synthesis was carried out in 20 L reaction volumes using the Qiagen quantiTect\u00ae reverse transcription kit. PCR reactions were carried out using the Qiagen kit according to manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. whole blood from turkey was collected and immediately mixed with an equal volume of Alsever\u2019s solution. whole blood in the Alsever\u2019s solution from turkey, tilapia, and salmon was washed in PBS to remove plasma. the 0.5% RBC working solution was prepared by diluting the RBC suspension in PBS at a ratio of 1:20, giving a final suspension of 0.5% RBCs from the stock solution. the 0.5% RBC working solution was prepared every day, while the RBC stock solution was only used up to a maximum of three days. the highest dilution showing a uniform reddish color of RBCs was regarded as the HA titer of the virus tested. the first part was to determine the toxicity of different concentrations of NH4Cl on E-11 cells. cells were treated with NH4Cl during virus adsorption. cell culture flasks were gently tilted to ensure uniform distribution of the virus solution on the cell monolayer. after 1 h of virus adsorption, any unbound virus was washed off three times using PBS. cells were cultured in normal growth media containing 5% FBS after NH4Cl treatment. the HA titer used for PR8 had no direct link to the TiLV and ISAV TCID50/mL. the highest dilution factor at which PR8 agglutinated turkey erythrocytes was 1:128/50 L. however, there was no agglutination by ISAV and TiLV. only PR8 agglutinated turkey erythrocytes, while neither of the piscine viruses (TiLV and ISAV) agglutinated the turkey RBCs (Table 2). rows E and F showed weak agglutination of tilapia erythrocytes by TiLV. rows A and B were similar to the PBS negative control in rows G and H. rows E and F showed weak agglutination of tilapia RBCs by ISAV. rows C and D showed that the highest dilution factor at which PR8 agglutinated tilapia RBCs was 1:64/ PR8 was able to agglutinate turkey, tilapia, and tilapia RBCs, while ISAV only agglutinated Atlantic salmon and tilapia RBCs. lower concentrations, i.e., between 1 and 30 mM, had no toxic effect. ytopathic effects (CPE) seen at 3 days post-infection (dpi) included formation of vacuoles (patches) of detached cells from E-11 monolayers infected with TiLV. there was no significant difference in the mean viral titer detected in the positive control (without NH4Cl treatment) no bands were detected in the RNase free water in the NC lanes tested against TiLV, PR8, and ISAV primers. the viruses used in the assay were PR8 titrated in a two-fold dilution in row A, starting with the highest concentration of 512 HA units. the HA titer used for PR8 had no direct link to the TiLV and ISAV TCID50/mL. only PR8 agglutinated turkey erythrocytes, while neither of the piscine viruses (TiLV and ISAV) agglutinated the turkey RBCs. Figure 2 shows the layout of the viruses used in the assay. 107 TCID50/mL diluted two-fold in rows A and B, PR8 (512 HA/50 L) in rows C and D, and ISAV (106 TCID50/mL) in rows E and H, while rows G and H contained the PBS negative control. rows E and F showed weak agglutination of tilapia RBCs by ISAV at a 1:4 dilution onward, which was similar to the PBS ISAV (106 TCID50/mL), PR8 (512HA/50 L) and TiLV (107 TCID50/mL) were able to agglutinate turkey, tilapia, and tilapia RBCs. in contrast, TiLV was not able to agglutinate turkey, tilapia, or Atlantic salmon RBCs. the cytopathic effects (CPE) seen at 3 days post-infection (dpi) included the formation of vacuoles (patches) of detached cells from E-11 monolayers infected with TiLV. there was no significant difference in the mean viral titer based on Ct-values detected by qRT-PCR from three replicates of E-11 cells treated with 30 mM NH4Cl at 0, 1, 2, and 3 hpi. the inability of TiLV to agglutinate RBCs from any of the species included suggests an absence of surface proteins able to agglutinate RBCs. a lack of an observed effect of lysosomotropic agents indicates an acidification-independent uptake mechanism. hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein binds Neu4,5Ac2 glycans on host cells. this HE is unique when compared with the HA or hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion proteins of other orthomyxoviruses. hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) proteins of other orthomyxoviruses. studies into cell attachment and replication mechanisms of orthomyxoviruses showed that after HA binding to Sia receptors on host cells, the virus is taken up into endosomal compartments by endocytosis. the low endosomal pH mediates the fusion of viral envelopes with endosomal membranes to facilitate virus uncoating. this leads to release of nucleoproteins required for virus replication by acid-dependent cellular proteases. future studies should seek to elucidate the mechanisms by which TiLV binds to host cells and its mode of entry into infected cells."}
