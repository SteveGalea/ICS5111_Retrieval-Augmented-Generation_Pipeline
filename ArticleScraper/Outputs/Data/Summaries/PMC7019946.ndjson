{"summary": "the clinical signs of MERS-CoV-infected patients are similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) the outbreaks of which in china in 2003 caused acute respiratory distress syndrome in humans. a continuous increase of human cases in the endemic areas has been reported. a previous study used the RV (BNSP333) vector modified from the RV vaccine vector SPBN to successfully design a vaccine against MERS-CoV infection [10,21] the RV vector (SRV9 strain) used in our study is screened from the Street Alabama Dufferin strain by plaque purification on baby Syrian hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) cells. the head-to-head comparison of available vaccine vectors is necessary in vaccine design [23] cells and Virus Baby Syrian hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells were cultured in serum-free medium (VirusPro\u00ae, Shanghai, China) at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 on an orbital shaker at 130 rpm. mouse neuroblastoma (NA) cells were cultured with Dulbecco\u2019s modified eagle medium (DMEM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, the completely inactivated virus was purified with 500KD Hollow Fiber Ultrafiltration Column and Sepharose Fast Flow 4 Gel. Fractions were harvested and analyzed by immunoblotting. the total protein concentration of the purified product was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay. ISA201VG (Seppic, Paris, France) and poly I: C (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) were mixed with the compound adjuvants consisting of ISA201VG (Seppic, Paris, France) and an equal volume antigen as the primary vaccination at 3-week intervals. serum samples were inactivated at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min before determining MERS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies. splenocytes were harvested on day 7 after the third immunization. splenocytes were stimulated with 1 M MERS-CoV peptide for 24 h. splenocytes were harvested on day 7 after the third immunization. analysis was performed using the Graphpad 8.0.2 software. results are expressed as the mean SD, and significance in their differences between groups were analyzed using a Student\u2019s t-test. the titers of the recombinant virus were determined by the median endpoint of the 50% tissue culture infectious dose units (TCID50) in NA cells. the virus was inactivated with 0.025% -propiolactone (v/v); the mixtures were incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight and then treated at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. female BALB/c mice were randomized into five groups of 10. mice were intramuscularly prime-immunized with 8 g purified RV/MERS virus. mice were mixed with compound adjuvants consisting of ISA201VG. mouse IgG (1:5000, BioWorld, St. Louis, MN, USA), IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3 (1:2000, Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. plates were then washed three times, and 100 L TMB (3\u2032,3\u2032,5\u2032,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine) per well was added. secreted tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), interferon-gamma (IFN-) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) in the supernatants were detected with the mouse ELISA cytokine kits (MABTECH, Nacka, Sweden). the results are expressed as the mean SD, and significance in their differences between groups were analyzed using a Student\u2019s t-test. a total of five groups of mice (G1\u2013G5) were administered three immunizations with a combined adjuvant through an intramuscular (i.m.) route. G1 was immunized with PBS as negative control; G2 was immunized with 8 g inactivated and purified RV/MERS; and G3\u2013G5 were immunized with 1 g (low dose), 5 g (medium dose), and 20 g (high dose group 3, group 4, and group 5 (G3, G4, G5) were vaccinated with varying doses of the MERS bacterium (Lactococcus lactis)-like particle (BLP) all groups received a second and third identical vaccination boost with a combined adjuvant at 3-week intervals after the primary immunization. MERS-CoV antigen protein displayed on surface of bacterial vector is sufficient to induce high RBD-specific antibody level in mice. sera from 2 weeks after last immunization were tested for MERS-CoV RBD-specific IgG antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) the sera in G5 induced significantly higher levels of IgG3 antibody than those of G2 (Figure 4f). however, further analysis of the ratios of IgG2a/IgG1 revealed that the sera in G2 were remarkably higher than those in G3\u2013G5 (Figure 4f). IL-2 in G3 were significantly higher than those in G4 and G5 at 7 weeks post-immunization (w.p.i.) this suggests that MERS-CoV antigen protein displayed on the viral vector induces a superior cellular immune response than that on the bacterial vector. the particle size distribution of RV/MERS (a) and MERS BLP (b). data was shown as mean SD (n = 3). a PDI, polydispersity index from dynamic light scattering (DLS). a schematic diagram for group design, immunizations, and immunological characterization is shown in Figure 2a. a total of five groups of mice were immunized and detected for virus-neutralizing antibody, IgG subtypes, and cytokines release. a total of five groups of mice were immunized and detected for virus-neutralizing antibody, IgG subtypes, and cytokines release. antigen-induced IgG antibodies can specifically bind to MERS-CoV RBD protein. G3\u2013G5 acquired a stronger binding to MERS-CoV RBD protein than G2. the control samples were detected to have negligible binding activity. sera from 2 weeks after the last immunization were tested for MERS-CoV RBD-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG2c, and IgG3 antibodies by ELISA. sera from 2 weeks after the last immunization were tested for MERS-CoV RBD-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG2c, and gG1 (a), IgG2a (b), IgG2b (c), IgG2c (d), and IgG3 (e) antibodies were determined by ELISA and are shown as end-point dilution titers. the ratios between IgG1 and IgG2a antibody responses were also calculated. researchers have developed and tested several MERS-CoV vaccine candidates in many animal models. one is the recombinant RV expressing MERS-CoV S1 protein fragment. the other uses GEM particles to display the MERS-CoV RBD protein fragment. the inactivated rabies virus-based vaccine is also safe for humans and animals. the results show that the inactivated rabies virus vectors have very safe and immunogenic profiles in animals. this study highlights their promise for vaccine development. the two vaccine platforms in this study have their own advantages and disadvantages. the RV-based MERS-CoV vaccine platform can rapidly induce antibody immune response and higher cellular immune response than the GEM-based vaccine platform. however, there is a risk of incomplete inactivation in the process of inactivating the RV/MERS. origin endowed with adjuvant activity, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), bacterial lipopeptides, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), and other conserved molecules. the receptors for these molecules are the mammalian toll-like receptors (TLRs) the GEM-based vaccine platform may be more suitable to develop mucosal vaccines considering that Lactococcus lactis has been safely used as a probiotic in our foods. the goal of this study was to test vaccine vectors through a comparison of immunogenicity of two MERS-CoV vaccine candidates."}
