{"summary": "the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is a member of the retroviridae family. it is a good representative of this viral adaptability with more than 50 viral RNA transcripts produced by alternative splicing [1,2,3] that allow for the expression of 15 proteins. initiation begins with the attachment of the small 40S ribosomal subunit with associated factors to the mRNA and progression of the ribosome in a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction to find and recognize the initiation codon. the initiation step is complex and highly regulated by at least 12 eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) most mRNAs initiate translation via a cap dependent and scanning mechanism. eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF4G are required for mRNA processing and nuclear export. the eIF4F complex can activate the mRNA to allow proper recruitment and landing of the small ribosomal subunit. 43S PIC can be recruited on activated mRNAs by the eIF4F complex. the eIF4F complex is composed of the eIF4E cap binding protein, the eIF4G scaffold protein, and the eIF4A helicase. this is the cap-dependent translation initiation mechanism. the first AUG codon read by the 43S PIC is used to initiate translation. the nucleotide context influences the initiation rate and the sequence GCCA/GCCAUGG (referenced as the \u201cKozak sequence\u201d) has been reported to favor start codon recognition. the scanning 43S PIC continues to scan the 5\u2032 UTR further downstream to locate and find the next AUG codon [8]. this mechanism allows the production of two isoforms of the same protein if located in the same reading frame [23,24] or two completely different proteins from two distinct open reading frames (ORFs) the mechanism of viral IRESs has been extensively investigated. IRESs mediated translation often provides viral mRNAs with a selective advantage. translation is sustained in circumstances where cap-dependent translation is altered. the methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3) associated with cofactors including METTL4 and Wilms\u2019 tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP) forms a complex that interacts with the mRNA, mostly in the nucleus, to promote m6A. the modification is reversible by at least two eraser proteins, which are FTO and ALKBH5. a subset of mRNAs contains m6A residues in their 5\u2032 UTR [54] that allow a m6A-induced ribosome engagement site (MIRES, Figure 1). m6A residues in their 5\u2032 UTR promote mRNA circularization, via an interaction YTHDF1/eIF3 or METTL3/eIF3 that enhances translation. the activity of eIF2 is modulated by phosphorylation at serine 51 on the alpha subunit. as a consequence, the P-eIF2 binds with high affinity to the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B which reduces the recycling of inactive eIF2GDP into active eIF2GTP. phosphorylation status of 4E-BP is regulated by the mTOR signaling pathway. eIF4E is phosphorylated on a serine at position 209 by the map kinase-interacting kinase (MNK) the role of this regulation remains controversial. some studies suggest that the binding of P-eIF4E to the cap structure is less efficient. the eIF4F complex can activate the mRNA to allow proper recruitment and landing of the small ribosomal subunit at the cap structure. the eIF4F complex can be recruited on activated mRNAs by the eIF4E complex composed of the eIF4E cap binding protein, the eIF4G scaffold protein and the eIF4A helicase. IRESes require all eIFs except eIF4E, type 3 IRESes do not need any of the eIF4F complex components, and type 4 IRESes do not rely on any eIFs nor Met-tRNAi. the 43S PIC can bind m6A located into the 5\u2032 UTR. eIF5B mediates the association of the 60S ribosomal large subunit to the 40S into an 80S ribosome and marks the end of the initiation phase. the first AUG codon encountered during ribosomal scanning of the 5\u2032 UTR is used to initiate translation. this is even more pronounced when eIF2 is phosphorylated and less available to initiate. aryotic mRNAs contain an N7-methylated guanosine linked to the first nucleotide of the RNA via a reverse 5\u2032 to 5\u2032 triphosphate linkage called the cap structure. most mRNAs initiate translation via a cap dependent and scanning mechanism. eIF4E then binds eIF4G, which is often named the scaffold protein as it maintains the architecture of the complex. interaction of the ternary complex to the 40S ribosome is enhanced in presence of eIFs to form the 43S pre-initiation complex. 43S PIC can be recruited on activated mRNAs by the eIF4F complex composed of the eIF4E cap binding protein, the eIF4G scaffold protein, and the eIF4A helicase. the first AUG codon read by the 43S PIC is used to initiate translation. the nucleotide context influences the initiation rate and the sequence GCCA/GCCAUGG (referenced as the \u201cKozak sequence\u201d) has been reported to favor start codon recognition. the first AUG codon can be ignored by the scanning 43S PIC. this mechanism allows the production of two isoforms of the same protein if located in the same reading frame [23,24] or two completely different proteins from two distinct open reading frames (ORFs) IRESs mediated translation often provides viral mRNAs with a selective advantage as translation is sustained in circumstances where cap-dependent translation is altered by cellular events (see Section 2.3) or during viral infection (see Section 5.2.1) the methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3) associated with cofactors including METTL4 and Wilms\u2019 tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP) forms a complex that interacts with the mRNA, mostly in the nucleus, to promote m6A. the modification is reversible by at least two eraser proteins, which are FTO and ALKBH5. a subset of mRNAs contains m6A residues in their 5\u2032 UTR [54] that allow a m6A-induced ribosome engagement site. a subset of mRNAs contains m6A residues in their 5\u2032 UTR [54] that allow a m6A-induced ribosome engagement site. m6A mRNAs are robust in HeLa cells with low activity of eIF4E. picornaviral infections are associated with a strong shut-off of cellular translation without affecting viral mRNA expression. repression is the consequence of virally encoded proteases that cleave the initiation factors eIF4G, PABP, or eIF5B [27,28,29,30] four main classes of viral IRESs according to their requirement for eIFs (non-exhaustive list) IRES Type eIFs Required Family Genus Species I eIF4G, eIF4A, eIF3, eIF1, eIF1A, eIF5 Picornaviridae Enterovirus Poliovirus [25] Rhinovirus A [34] Human coxsakievirus B3 [35] II eIF4G, methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3) associated with cofactors including METTL4 and Wilms\u2019 tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP) [46,47,48] forms a complex that interacts with the mRNA, mostly in the nucleus, to promote m6A. there is only a minor fraction, 0.1% to 0.5%, of adenosine residues that are modified per mRNA [51,52] with a m6A mRNAs in the 5\u2032 UTR allow a m6A-induced ribosome engagement site. m6A mRNAs have been analyzed by toeprinting assay. it does not require any components of the eIF4F complex indicating that m6A can support cap-independent translation. the eIF2 binds with high affinity to the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. the low amount of available and active eIF2GTP in the cell inhibits the global level of translation. eIF2 phosphorylation is regulated by phosphorylation or by sequestration by a family of small proteins that specifically bind to it. eIF4E is phosphorylated on a serine at position 209 by the map kinase-interacting kinase (MNK) the role of this regulation remains controversial. some studies suggest that P-eIF4E can promote initiation of some mRNAs. in vitro studies indicate that the binding of P-eIF4E to the cap structure is less efficient. TAR is a binding site for several proteins including the viral Tat protein [73] and the cellular TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP) [74,75] Interaction of these proteins with TAR sequesters the TAR hairpin and reduces the amount of RNA available for PKR activation. TRBP also contributes to the inactivation of PKR through the formation of two heterodimers: TRBP/PACT (PACT protein is an activator of PKR) 9700 bp primary viral transcript contains at least 5 donor and 8 acceptor sites. all these transcripts are then translated to produce the two major polyproteins (Gag and Gag-Pol), the two fragments of the envelope (Env) and six regulatory proteins (Tat, Nef, Rev, Vpu, Vpr, and Vif) the primary transcript is fully spliced to generate 2 kb viral mRNAs coding for Tat, Rev, and Nef. they are the first ones produced during infection [89] and are exported to the cytoplasm via the nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1)-mediated pathway similar to host cellular mRNAs. several viral transcripts can produce the same protein but they differ by the length and composition of their 5\u2032 UTR. a similar situation has been described for Nef, Tat, Vpr, and Env with 5, 8, 4, and 16 viral RNAs respectively. this diversity is also due to the potential insertion of two non-coding exons. tRNALys3 required for viral reverse transcription is involved in the packaging of the two copies of genomic RNAs. DIS and the kissing loop hairpin are involved in the packaging of the two copies of genomic RNAs. all these RNA motifs are absolutely essentials for viral replication, but they also constitute major hurdles for the scanning of the ribosomal initiation complex. the 5\u2032 UTR IRES is depicted inside the blue line. ribosome attachment can be promoted via hnRNPA1 and S25 proteins. the internal ribosome binding sites of the Gag-coding region are indicated inside the red lines. the PCE and IRENE regions are also indicated. cytoplasmic La protein participates in translational control of some viral RNAs. RNA immunoprecipitation of the mRNP from HIV-1 infected lymphocytes revealed that la protein is associated with HIV-1 viral mRNA [119]. addition of the recombinant La protein to the RRL is sufficient to relieve the translation inhibition imposed by the TAR structure. the RNA helicase A (RHA also named DHX9) is a highly conserved (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) DEAD-box protein involved in many different facets of cell metabolism. the RNA helicase A is a highly conserved (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) DEAD-box protein involved in many different steps of cell metabolism. dEAD-box polypeptide 3 (DDX3) is a cellular ATP dependent RNA helicase. expression of DDX3 is stimulated by the production of the Tat protein 137. over-expression of DDX3 in cells enhances specifically the nuclear export and expression of RRE-containing RNAs in a Rev-dependent manner. DDX3 suggests that eIF4G, eIF4A and eIF3 intervenes through several complexes to promote ribosomal recruitment at the cap structure in the environment of the TAR RNA structure. it is noteworthy that the proportion of active eIF4E is reduced during HIV-1 infection. the virus needs to adapt to these cellular modifications and has to bypass the use of eIF4E. the recruitment of both eIF4A1 and CBP80 on the unspliced RNA is enhanced in the presence of both the Rev and the RRE element. the unspliced HIV-1 mRNA also interacts with the human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-interacting protein with methyltransferase domain (PIMT) this interaction is dependent on both the Rev protein and the RRE. this interaction is dependent on both the Rev protein and the RRE. RNA architecture can regulate the flow of ribosomes engaged in translation on the unspliced mRNA. the efficiency of the downstream ribosomal frameshifting [153] to produce Gag-Pol polyprotein is directly linked to the RNA structure in the 5\u2032 UTR [154]. eIF4GI is a substrate for the HIV-1 viral proteases in in vitro systems using recombinant proteins. the retroviral protease targets two sites on eIF4GI that are located on either sides of the central binding domain of eIF3 and eIF4A [163,165] eIF4GI was required for Cap/DDX3-dependent translation [166]. this contrasts with translation of a reporter construct driven by the HIV-1 5\u2032 UTR followed by the Gag coding region, which was not affected, and even stimulated, by the addition of the enzyme [163,167]. this will be developed later in this review. the HIV-1 5\u2032 UTR promotes internal initiation Viral IRESs are generally long and structured RNA regions that can interact with PIC components. this is generally evidenced by the use of a bicistronic vector in which the putative IRES sequence is placed in the intercistronic region. eIF4E and the N-terminal domain of eIF4G are not required in a similar manner to many other viral IRESs. initiation can occur either at an AUG located immediately at the 3\u2032 border of the IRES as in the case of EMCV, HCV, and CrPV IRESs. initiation takes place with no scanning. initiation codon suggests scanning was required after the landing of the PIC at the 3\u2032 border of the IRES [189]. a recombinant trans-dominant negative eIF4AR362Q mutant was added to the RRL. this was sufficient to repress expression mediated by the HIV-1 5\u2032 UTR. hnRNP A1 is the first ITAF described for the HIV-1 5\u2032 UTR IRES. two other proteins have been involved in the regulation of IRES activity. the first one is the Elav-like protein HuR, which inhibits IRES activity. the nucleation of Gag interferes with incoming ribosomes that initiate translation, both from the 5\u2032 cap and the IRES. the regulatory Rev protein has also been involved in HIV-1 translation. it was shown that Rev can interact with the A loop of the DIS structure. the role of the Gag coding region Seminal studies have shown that the Gag coding region could exert a negative effect on the activity of the 5\u2032 UTR IRES [181,188,204] the region coding for the matrix within the Gag ORF contains instability elements named INS-1 that negatively impact on HIV-1 IRES-driven translation. the binding of a 40S ribosomal subunit can occur directly to the Gag coding region in the absence of any eIFs in filter binding assays. the presence of site 1 is consistent with a backward shift of the PIC to the AUG-p55 codon to promote translation of Gag-p55 [198,210,212] methylation controls the interaction between RRE and the Rev protein. m6A residues were found in the sequence spanning nucleotides 170 to 420. they include the PBS, DIS, and Psi elements, and the beginning of the Gag coding region. the impact of the interaction between m6A residues and the YTHDF family negatively regulates the replication, but not at the translational level, of other RNA viruses. the identification of methylated adenosines inside the HIV-1 unspliced mRNA has just emerged and these nucleotide modifications appear to differentially regulate expression of the unspliced mRNA. nuclear La protein is associated with nascent RNA polymerase III transcripts. cytoplasmic La protein participates in translational control of some viral RNAs. characterization of the function of la protein showed an ATP-dependent double-stranded RNA unwinding activity. the RNA helicase A (RHA also named DHX9) is a highly conserved (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) DEAD-box protein involved in many different facets of cell metabolism such as RNA processing [131], innate anti-viral immunity [132], and in multiple steps of HIV-1 replication [133,134,135]. the ds-RNA binding protein family participates at different levels in the fate of the unspliced mRNA within dEAD-box polypeptide 3 (DDX3) is a cellular ATP dependent RNA helicase. it is a cellular ATP dependent RNA helicase whose expression is stimulated by the production of the Tat protein. silencing of DDX3 in cells does not suppress the export of unspliced mRNA. dx3 intervenes through several complexes including eIF4G, eIF4A and eIF3 to promote ribosomal recruitment at the cap structure in the environment of the TAR RNA structure. the virus needs to adapt to these cellular modifications and has to bypass the use of eIF4E. mRNA in a Rev-dependent manner and CBP80 and Rev were found to be closely associated inside the nucleus [147] the authors also showed that Rev is strongly associated to eIF4A1 and the recruitment of both eIF4A1 and CBP80 on the unspliced RNA is enhanced in the presence of both Rev and the RRE element. this interaction is dependent on both the Rev protein and the RRE. RNA architecture can regulate the flow of ribosomes engaged in translation on the unspliced mRNA. it was proposed that RNA architecture can regulate the flow of ribosomes engaged in translation on the unspliced mRNA. it was proposed that RNA architecture can regulate the flow of ribosomes engaged in translation. the virally encoded HIV-1 protease is required for processing of Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins during maturation. this protease can cleave some cellular proteins indicating that the HIV-1 enzyme is active in the host cell. eIF4GI, PABP, and eIF3d are also involved in translation. translation of a reporter gene driven by the 5\u2032 UTR of the unspliced HIV-1 mRNA was repressed, suggesting that eIF4GI was required for Cap/DDX3-dependent translation [166]. this contrasts with translation of a reporter construct driven by the HIV-1 5\u2032 UTR followed by the Gag coding region, which was not affected, and even stimulated, by the addition of the enzyme [163,167]. the HIV-1 5\u2032 UTR promotes internal initiation Viral IRESs are generally long and structured RNA regions that can interact with PIC components. the recruitment of ribosome on this IRES was rather inefficient in the RRL unless cellular extracts were added [182] reflecting the need for additional cellular factors. most data confirm that the PBS, SD, and DIS structures are required to sustain IRES activity [185,187,188,193]. an RNA sequence that lies directly upstream to the PBS signal was identified as a negative regulator of internal ribosome entry and was called IRENE, short for IRES negative element. eIF4E and the N-terminal domain of eIF4G are not required in a similar manner to many other viral IRESs. puristanol (a small molecule inhibitor of eIF4A) inhibited translation at the authentic initiation codon of Gag. recombinant trans-dominant negative eIF4AR362Q mutant was sufficient to repress expression mediated by the HIV-1 5\u2032 UTR [198]. silencing of hnRNP A1 reduced expression mediated by the 5\u2032 UTR IRES in the context of bicistronic reporter genes. hnRNP A1 is the first ITAF described for the HIV-1 5\u2032 UTR IRES. hnRNP A1 is the first ITAF described for the 5\u2032 UTR IRES. neo-synthesized Gag polyprotein interacts with the encapsidation signal (Psi) located in the 5\u2032 UTR. it interferes with incoming ribosomes that initiate translation, both from the 5\u2032 cap and the IRES. the regulatory Rev protein has also been involved in HIV-1 translation. the role of the Gag Coding Region Seminal studies have shown that the Gag coding region could exert a negative effect on the activity of the 5\u2032 UTR IRES [181,188,204] the region coding for the matrix within the Gag ORF contains instability elements named INS-1 that negatively impact on HIV-1 IRES-driven translation. the binding of a 40S ribosomal subunit can occur directly to the Gag coding region in the absence of any eIFs in filter binding assays. the presence of site 1 is consistent with a backward shift of the PIC to the AUG-p55 codon to promote translation of Gag-p55. methylation controls the interaction between RRE and the Rev protein. m6A residues were found in the sequence spanning nucleotides 170 to 420. this difference with the work of Lichinchi and collaborators could be attributed to the use of different kinds of cells. the impact of the interaction between m6A residues and the YTHDF family also negatively regulates the replication, but not at the translational level, of other RNA viruses such as HCV and Zika virus. methylated adenosines appear to differentially regulate expression of the unspliced mRNA, but also other steps of the viral replication. ribosomal scanning takes place on the 5\u2032 UTR [152] with the help of DDX3 [141,142] some studies have even shown that this low efficiency of translation imposed by the 5\u2032 UTR was necessary for efficient ribosomal frameshifting to produce Gag-Pol [154] the virally encoded HIV-1 protease, which is required for processing of Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins during maturation, can also modulate cellular and viral translation. translation of a reporter gene driven by the 5\u2032 UTR of the unspliced HIV-1 mRNA was repressed, suggesting that eIF4GI was required for Cap/DDX3-dependent translation. this contrasts with translation of a reporter construct driven by the HIV-1 5\u2032 UTR followed by the Gag coding region, which was not affected, and even stimulated, by the addition of the enzyme. the HIV-1 5\u2032 UTR promotes internal initiation Viral IRESs are generally long and structured RNA regions that can interact with PIC components. the recruitment of the ribosome on this IRES was rather inefficient in the RRL unless cellular extracts were added [182] reflecting the need for additional cellular factors. mutations and deletions in the IRES sequence failed to identify any individual RNA structures or motifs that would be critical for ribosomal recruitment. most data confirm that the PBS, SD, and DIS structures are required to sustain IRES activity [185,187,188,193]. RNA sequence that lies immediately upstream to the PBS signal was identified as a negative regulator of internal ribosome entry and was called IRENE, short for IRES negative element [187]. carvajal et al. have shown an inhibition of translation driven by the PV IRES but not from the HCV IRES nor from the HIV1 5\u2032 UTR [185], suggesting that initiation takes place with no scanning. initiation takes place with no scanning, suggesting that scanning was required after the landing of the PIC at the 3\u2032 border of the IRES [189]. hnRNP A1 is the first ITAF described for the HIV-1 5\u2032 UTR IRES. a proteomic approach has also identified a set of 18 cellular proteins associated with the HIV-1 IRES [182]. activity of the HIV-1 IRES is strongly stimulated in lymphocytes and dendritic cells compared to Hela [188] suggesting a cell type specificity for viral translation. neo-synthesized Gag polyprotein interferes with incoming ribosomes that initiate translation, both from the 5\u2032 cap and the IRES. expression directed by the HIV-1 5\u2032 UTR from a monocistronic reporter mRNA was affected by the cleavage of both eIF4G1 and PABP [166]. but when the reporter construct was extended to include the Gag ORF downstream from the HIV-1 5\u2032 UTR, translation was resistant to expression of the viral enzyme pointing out to a regulatory role of the Gag coding region. this mechanism was found to be conserved in the type 2 human and simian immunodeficiency virus relatives [207,208,209]. this was initially demonstrated in poliovirus-infected cells that expressed bicistronic constructs containing the Gag coding region in the intergenic spacer. the expression of Gag-p55 and IRES activity has been studied in several in vitro and cellulo translation assays. methylation of both cellular and viral mRNAs is associated with an increase of adenosine methylation. m6A residues were found in the sequence spanning nucleotides 170 to 420. methylation controls the interaction between RRE and the Rev protein. the YTHDF proteins are implicated at different levels of the viral replication cycle. they negatively inhibit the viral reverse transcription step and promote HIV-1 gRNA degradation. the impact of the interaction between m6A residues and the YTHDF family has just emerged. a global systemic investigation of how protein synthesis is controlled in spliced viral mRNAs has never been undertaken. the knock-down of DDX3 expression in HIV1 (NL-4.3) infected Jurkat T cells\u2019 reduced translation of Gag-p55, but also that of Nef and Vif proteins without affecting their cytoplasmic mRNA level. 16 natural bicistronic mRNAs are produced. all are composed of the Vpu ORF followed by Env. but they differ by their 5\u2032 UTR [1,220,224]. ribosome attachment can occur at the cap structure and requires different RNA helicases (RHA, DDX3, La, and TRBP) to promote unwinding of the 5\u2032 end TAR structure. how the cap structure of the viral transcripts is recognized and which cellular proteins intervene in the process is also a matter of debate. the link between methylation of the adenosine and translation driven by IRES remains to be shown, but these methylated adenosines on the viral RNA modulate both mRNA stability and mRNA translation efficiency. this may provide new avenues for novel potential antiviral targets."}
