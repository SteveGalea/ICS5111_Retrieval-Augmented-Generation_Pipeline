{"summary": "despite the number of studies reported to date, the causative agents of pneumonia are not completely known. we found vegetable and tobacco DNA may be detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. pneumonia may occur as a consequence of the passage of foreign material into the respiratory tracts. it has been reported that aspiration of foreign matter may occur easily among ICU patients. this type of pneumonia may represent a serious cause of illness and mortality among ICU patients [7], [8]. inhalation was confirmed in a total of 7 patients out of the 106 cases. 4 were positive for plant DNA (57%). inhalation was significantly frequent in patients with plant DNA. three of these six plant-positive patients had a history for pneumonia at the admission (cases 2, 5 and 6). available Clinical data showed that three of these six plant-positive patients had a history for pneumonia at the admission.

(99%) Negative Nicotiana tabacum (100%) 16S rDNA Tobacco plant Z00044.2 CMV, cytomegalovirus; HSV, herpes simplex virus. plant DNA can be found when investigating aspiration pneumonia episodes using 16S (chloroplast) and 18S rDNA (chromosome) amplification and sequencing. previous studies of patients with pulmonary infection and cystic fibrosis identified chloroplast. bacterial metagenome of cigarettes was inhaled using 16S rRNA-based taxonomic microarray, cloning and sequencing. this confirms that using broad-range primers to amplify bacterial 16S rDNA gene can detect this tobacco chloroplasts. aspiration was clinically confirmed in two patients and highly suspected in the third. a total of 106 BAL and 106 blood samples were studied from 106 episodes of ventilator-associated pneumonia in ICU patients. the diagnoses of ventilator-associated pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia were defined as described elsewhere [19], [20]. PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing DNA was tested for universal bacteria using broad-range primers to amplify the 16S rDNA gene. PCR was performed using an ABI Thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Courtaboeuf, Belgium). each amplification was carried out in a final volume 50 L containing 5 L of extracted DNA, 1 PCR buffer, 2 L of 25mM MgCl2, 200 M of each dNTP, 200 amplification was concluded with an incubation step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. purified PCR products from the previous steep were cloned into a PCR II TA cloning vector. purified PCR products from the previous steep were cloned into a PCR II TA cloning vector. quantitative PCR was performed using a lightCycler\u00ae instrument. each qPCR reaction was carried out in a final volume of 20 L containing 10 L of QuantiTect master mix, 2 L of probe 0.1 mM of each primer and 4 L of DNA. the reaction mixture was incubated at 25\u00b0C for 10 min and then at 40\u00b0C for 90 min in an ABI Thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) the reaction mixture was incubated at 25\u00b0C for 10 min and then at 40\u00b0C for 90 min in an ABI Thermocycler.

Written consent from patient family members was obtained.
