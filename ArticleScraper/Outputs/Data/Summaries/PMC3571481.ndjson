{"summary": "influenza virus is responsible for a great burden of disease in humans. it follows distinct epidemiological patterns, including the yearly influenza season (1), off-seasonal pandemic outbreaks (2, 3), and sporadic cases with swine flu (4) or avian influenza (5). the clinical severity of influenza virus infection is highly variable and is determined by multiple factors. ferrets infected with influenza virus A/Mexico/4108/2009 were infected with 1 106 50% egg infectious doses (EID50s) of influenza virus A/California/07/2009. animals were sacrificed on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 postinfection, together with a group of four uninfected ferrets. a second round of ferret infections (in-house ferret breeding) was performed using 1 106 EID50s of influenza virus A/Mexico/4108/2009. lungs and lymph nodes were collected from 3 ferrets at 5 days postinfection (d.p.i.) a group of ferrets was infected with 1 106 EID50s of A/Mexico/4108/2009. polyadenylated RNA was isolated using sera-Mag magnetic oligo(dT) particles. the mRNA was synthesized with a superScript double-stranded cDNA kit. the products were subjected to end repair and phosphorylation by incubation. contigs were aligned with BLASTx with a similarity threshold with an E value of 105. the annotations were considered valid only when coincidental gene orthologs from at least two different species were found. some sequences were trimmed to remove nonmatching terminal regions of the contigs. the Iliad Assembler program (http://www.ferretscience.org/2012/02/iliad-assembler.html) was used to place the contigs in the correct relative position and fill the unresolved gaps. the final ferret mRNA library included the newly generated sequences. ferret mRNA library was built using the ferret mRNA sequences. alignments were performed with Bowtie using the parameters -a, -best, -strata, and -S. differential gene expression was computed using DEGseq with the MA-plot-based method with random sampling model. real-time PCR was performed in triplicate using a power SYBR green kit. results normalized to those for the housekeeping gene beta-actin. a group of ferrets was infected with 1 106 EID50s of influenza virus A/Mexico/4108/2009. lungs and lymph nodes were collected on days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 after infection. the RNA from the experiments with A/Mexico/4108/2009 was purified with an RNeasy minikit. the double-stranded cDNA was synthesized with a superScript double-stranded cDNA kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) using random hexamer primers. the products were subjected to end repair and phosphorylation by incubation with a mix containing T4 DNA polymerase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and Klenow enzyme. contigs were aligned with BLASTx with a similarity threshold with an E value of 105. the annotations were considered valid only when coincidental gene orthologs from at least two different species were found. some sequences were trimmed to remove nonmatching terminal regions of the contigs. the final ferret mRNA library included newly generated sequences. DGE was used to analyze at 5 d.p.i. the gene expression profiles in the lung tissue and lymph nodes from ferrets infected with influenza virus. the resulting tag counts per gene were loaded into the MultiExperiment Viewer tool (MeV; version 4.7.4) tool (28), and the differential gene expression was computed using DEGseq with the MA-plot-based method with random sampling model (DEGseq-MARS) BI Prism 7900HT apparatus (Applied Biosystems) results were normalized to those for the housekeeping gene beta-actin. the library of ferret mRNA sequences can be accessed as contigs under accession numbers JP004807 to JP037156. a total of 9,501 ferret mRNAs were covered by a single annotated contig. a ferret mRNA library containing 13,202 annotated sequences was generated. 13,109 mRNA sequences were derived from the newly assembled contigs. lengths in ferret mRNA library were estimated with respect to canine mRNA sequences from the refseq_rna database. the percent coverage of the genes in the ferret mRNA library was estimated with respect to canine mRNA sequences. the number of sequences included in each analysis is shown in parentheses beneath the columns. ferret sequences were aligned with sequences from the refseq_rna database. the homology values between ferret and giant panda were subdivided by protein domains. from all genes contained in the ferret mRNA library, 11,528 gene symbols were mapped. lung tissue was obtained at 5 d.p.i. (n = 3) from ferrets infected with influenza virus. the clinical signs were featured by very mild fever during days 1 and 2 postinfection, marked hypothermia during days 7 to 10 and a mere 3.4% weight loss on day 2. the severity of the clinical signs of ferrets infected with influenza virus was lower than that previously reported for this strain (6). RSAD2 have a prominent role in the antiviral responses. increased levels of different cytokines and chemokines indicate presence of active cell recruitment, inflammation, and immunomodulatory processes in the infected lung tissue. only 425 genes were upregulated, and these included interferon-stimulated genes. gene expression in lung tissue and lymph nodes was analyzed by affymetrix GeneChip Canine Genome (version 2.0) microarrays. RNA was extracted from the lung tissue (A to C) and lymph nodes (D to F) from ferrets infected with 106 EID50s of A/California. gene expression was analyzed by using Affymetrix GeneChip Canine Genome (version 2.0) microarrays. genes were considered significantly regulated if Student t test's P value was 0.05 and the fold variation was >1.5. the list of up- and downregulated genes at each time point were loaded in the DAVID annotation tool. Adaptive immune gene expression was increased on days 5 and 6 postinfection. peak levels for expression of IGHM, IGHG, and CD8A were observed earlier (day 5) following reinfection. RNA was extracted from lung tissue (1, 3, 5, and 7 d.p.i.) and lymph nodes (3 and 14 d.p.i. and uninfected controls) from ferrets infected with A/California/07/2009. results were normalized to those for the housekeeping gene beta-actin. a total of 9,501 ferret mRNAs were covered by a single annotated contig. a ferret mRNA library containing 13,202 annotated sequences was generated. 13,109 mRNA sequences were derived from newly assembled contigs. ferret and giant panda bear genes were classified according to the protein domains present in their mRNA sequences. the number of sequences included in each analysis is shown in parentheses beneath the columns. ferrets belong to same order (Carnivora) and suborder (Canifornia) the homology values between ferret and giant panda were subdivided by protein domains. this analysis revealed which domains are under a higher evolutional pressure than the average for the total transcriptome. the severity of the clinical signs of ferrets infected with A/Mexico/4108/2009 was lower than that previously reported for this strain. the RNA was purified and subjected to DGE tag sequencing. the resulting sequencing data files were deposited in SRA. the RNA was extracted at 5 d.p.i. from the lung tissue (A) and lymph nodes (B) from ferrets infected with A/Mexico/4108/2009. the RNA was extracted at 5 d.p.i. from the lung tissue (A) and lymph nodes (B) lymph nodes analyzed by Affymetrix GeneChip Canine Genome (version 2.0) microarrays. gene expression was analyzed by using affymetrix GeneChip canine Genome (version 2.0) microarrays. gene enrichment was assessed by the Fisher exact test; **, P 0.01. evolution of lung host gene expression during influenza virus infection and reinfection. in an attempt to model the effect of protective immunity, we performed an infection-reinfection protocol with homologous pdmH1N1. peak levels for expression of IGHM, IGHG, and CD8A were observed earlier (day 5) following reinfection than peak levels observed in primary infection (day 7). significant increases in expression of CD8A and IGHM could be observed in lymph nodes by day 3 postinfection. analysis of gene expression is a key approach to the study of pathogenic processes during influenza virus infection in ferrets. however, the characterization of the ferret at the molecular level has occurred at a slower pace than that with other more commonly used animal models. next-generation sequencing will likely present the highest levels of specificity for genes that show high sequence variability among ferret breeds. RNA samples were analyzed by next-generation sequencing (33), and the resulting 90-bp paired-end sequences were subjected to de novo assembly (25). this method resulted in the generation of sequence contigs by searching the gene orthologs of highest sequence similarity in other mammal species. characterization of blood-expressed mRNAs in ferrets would be of interest. better knowledge of sequences of genes expressed in the brain tissue would facilitate the study of neuroinvasive forms of influenza virus infection. dis et al. found that the chemokines CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 were expressed in primary human airway epithelial cells (hAECs) infected in vitro with influenza virus (41), which may closely portray the early chemokine response of the infected cells in the lung tissue. this may closely portray the early chemokine response of the infected cells in the lung tissue. a combination of antiviral interferon responses and cellular effectors of the innate immune response is triggered during a primary influenza virus infection with little or no prior specific immunity. however, antigen-presenting cells get loaded with influenza virus antigens at the infection site, they migrate to the regional lymph nodes, and maturation of cellular effectors of the adaptive response takes place. we found that lymph nodes of ferrets infected with A/California/07/2009 undergo broad gene upregulation, followed by a plateau stage. this decay of the gene activity in the lymph nodes may correspond with the end of antigen presentation processes. at day 5 after infection with A/Mexico/4108/2009, overall gene downregulation is detected, while prominent ISGs and chemokine expression are maintained. ferrets failed to develop observable clinical signs. levels of virus remained low throughout the infection process. results suggest preacquired immunity was able to contain the viral spread during the first stages. ferret mRNAs were sequenced independently as part of different studies. a number of ferret mRNAs were sequenced independently as part of different studies. this model will allow the integration of factors that determine severity of influenza virus infections. new resources will allow others to interpret next-generation sequencing reads from ferret experiments and translate them into biologically meaningful gene expression profiles. a direct comparison of the performance of the three platforms is yet to be made. next-generation sequencing will likely present the highest levels of specificity for genes that show high sequence variability among ferret breeds. more comprehensive characterization of ferret mRNA sequences would be of interest. further characterization of blood-expressed mRNAs in ferrets would be of interest. further characterization of genes expressed in the brain tissue would facilitate the study of neuroinvasive forms of influenza virus infection (35). the chemokines CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 were expressed in primary human airway epithelial cells (hAECs) infected in vitro with influenza virus (41), which may closely portray the early chemokine response of the infected cells in the lung tissue. a better characterization of the host chemokine responses would shed light on the implications of different cell types in a dynamic process. gen-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes and antibody-producing lymphocytes in the infected lung tissue begins at 5 d.p.i., hence initiating the effector adaptive responses. a combination of antiviral interferon responses and cellular effectors of the innate immune response is triggered in a first attempt to contain the spread of the virus. IGHG is significantly increased at 7 d.p.i., consistent with the time required for the switch of immunoglobulin isotypes. this decay of the gene activity in the lymph nodes may correspond with the end of antigen presentation processes. at day 5 after infection with A/Mexico/4108/2009, overall gene downregulation is detected. ferrets failed to develop observable clinical signs during homologous rechallenge with A/Mexico/4108/2009. levels of virus remained low throughout the infection process. this suggests that preacquired immunity was able to contain the viral spread during the first stages. however, during the second stage, CXCL10 and CCL5 together with markers of the effector adaptive immune response were upregulated. this model will allow the integration of additional factors that determine the severity of influenza virus infections. the presence of bacterial coinfections and other comorbidities will help to better characterize the components and the behavior of the different functional processes that comprise the host responses."}
