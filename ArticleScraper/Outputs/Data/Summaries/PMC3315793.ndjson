{"summary": "PCV2 is the causative agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) and porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) it has caused heavy losses in global agriculture in recent decades. it is accepted as the causative agent of a number of diseases in these animals. ephropathy syndrome (PDNS) causes great losses to the pig industry. it is necessary to develop an effective method for detecting PCV2 to prevent these diseases. a rapid, sensitive and easy-to-operate method is still needed. the use of LAMP for detecting PCV2 has been reported by Chen et al [17]. in their study, only four primers were used and no betaine was added to the LAMP assay. however, six primers containing two loop primers were used to amplify different regions of PCV2. this complemented and extended previous methods for PCV2 detection. the sequences showed 100% homology with the ORF2 gene of PCV2. a predictable product of the 137-bp motif was resolved on the agarose gel as expected. all the products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels and stained with goldview. all the products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels and stained with goldview. all the products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels. the sequences showed 100% homology with the ORF2 gene of PCV2. a predictable product of the 137-bp motif was resolved on the agarose gel as expected. all the products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels and stained with goldview. all the products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels and stained with goldview. the LAMP reaction can be performed under isothermal conditions without PCR thermal cyclers within a short time. the reaction was more rapid than ELISA and real-time PCR. the reaction was 100-fold more sensitive than conventional PCR. porcine sera was added to our LAMP reaction system to increase melting speed. the tolerance of the LAMP assay for biological substances was superior to other detection methods. the DNA extraction step can be omitted from the LAMP assay. PEDV, TGEV, RV and PRRSV were used to detect the specificicty of LAMP method for PCV2. different concentrations of DNA were used to determine the detection limit of PCV2 DNA. PCR was carried out in a digital thermostatic water-bath (Jintan Jingda Apparatus Factory, China), as described previously [22-24]. PCR was carried out in a 25-L reaction volume that contained 0.5 M F3 and B3 and 0.75 mM dNTPs, 2.5 M 10 PCR buffer, 2.5 U Taq polymerase, and 1.0 L extracted DNA. the DNA (PCV2, PCV1, PPV and PRV) and cDNA (PEDVD, TGEV, RV and PRRSV) were used as sample templates to initiate the reaction under the optimal conditions. Negative controls were included. the amplified products were digested with HaeIII to confirm the reaction specificity. DNA and RNA extraction DNA was extracted from a pure culture of cells infected by PCV2 according to the instructions of the blood Viral DNA/RNA kit (BIOMIGA Inc, San Diego, CA, USA) the DNA template was used for optimizing the optimum temperature. PCR was performed in a 25-L reaction mixture that contained 0.8 mM FIP and BIP, 0.2 mM of each of the outer primers. PCR was carried out in a digital thermostatic water-bath (Jintan Jingda Apparatus Factory, China) electrophoresis on 2% (w/v) agarose gels and visualized by staining with Goldview. the annealing temperature for PCR reaction was to be optimized. the amplified products were digested with HaeIII. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions KZ, WS, FTH and XMT participated in the design."}
