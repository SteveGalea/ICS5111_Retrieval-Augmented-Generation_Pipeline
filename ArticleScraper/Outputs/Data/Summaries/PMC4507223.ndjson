{"summary": "the consequences of global warming for species diversity are unclear, given the lack of consistent global trends toward either increased or decreased diversity. the authors found that the number of species declined within individual sites and among all sites studied. fingerprints collected in controlled settings, of 15,597 repeat offenders in a Michigan police database, with five or more records spanning at least 5 years for each person. Statistical modeling revealed that although genuine match scores declined with increasing age of the individuals and decreasing image quality, but gender and race had little impact on the scores. the results suggest that the distribution of deleterious genotypes in Brazil likely depends to a greater extent on the amount of continental admixture than on local history factors such as consanguinity or family structure. around 30% of the human DNA that encodes olfactory receptors is unique to each individual. an estimated 30% of HLA matching tests in population-wide screening. authors used a distortion-corrected functional MRI protocol to examine activation in the brains of 27 participants as the participants read individual words aloud. authors used a genetic engineering tool called VelociGene to generate human-compatible monoclonal antibodies against a viral envelope protein crucial to infection. two of the antibodies\u2014REGN3051 and REGN3048\u2014tightly bound to evolutionarily conserved regions of MERS-CoV, blocked viral entry into susceptible cells and neutralized infection by a broad range of viral strains more potently than did antibodies generated using traditional methods."}
