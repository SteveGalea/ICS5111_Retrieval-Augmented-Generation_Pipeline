{"summary": "type I IFNs directly inhibit viral replication by creating an \u201cantiviral state\u201d by upregulating interferon-responsive genes. the importance of the type I IFN response during viral infection is reflected by the fact that most viruses express IFN antagonists that are able to suppress IFN pathways at the level of IFN production. coronaviruses encode four or five structural proteins, approximately 16 replicase-associated proteins, and one to eight accessory proteins. mouse hepatitis virus accessory proteins ORF3b and ORF6, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) accessory proteins ORF5a, MHV and SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) proteins and replicase-associated nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) and nsp3 are all able to inhibit coronaviruses use multiple approaches to evade the innate immune response. both macrophages, in which IFN is induced, and DC, in which IFN is not induced, are important target cells for several coronaviruses. the extent and nature of evasion are cell type dependent. MHV infection was dependent on signaling through the IFN-/ receptor (IFNAR) levels of type I IFN produced in MHV-infected BMM were sufficient to induce maximal activation. exogenous type I IFN treatment did not further stimulate IFN-related gene upregulation at late times postinfection (p.i.)"}
