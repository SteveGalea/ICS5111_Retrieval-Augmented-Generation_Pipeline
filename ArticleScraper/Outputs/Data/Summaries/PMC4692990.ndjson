{"summary": "interleukin 17, first known as cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen (CTLA) 8, originated from a T-cell derived factor with cytokine-like activity. IL17A, along with five functional homodimers (IL17B-F), one heterodimer (IL17A/F), and 5 receptors (IL17RA-RE), composes the IL17 family. this protein is important to adaptive immunity responses, namely, as mediator of chronic inflammation and in lagomorphs and rodents, F. tularensis has the ability to cause septicemia while in humans the outcome of infection is a multisystem organ failure [23] there are several reports of F. tularensis infections in leporids, mainly in rabbits (European rabbit and cottontails) material and Methods Samples of European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus cuniculus and Oryctolagus cuniculus algirus), pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis), brush rabbit (Sylvilagus bachmani), and European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) were provided by the CIBIO Lagomorpha tissue collection. numbering is according to the European rabbit sequence (GenBank accession number XM_002714498.2) and the signal peptide and indels were included in the numbering. the secondary structure of IL17A was predicted using PsiPred and DiAminoacid Neural Network Application (DiANNA) both methods predict protein cysteines that create disulfide bonds. but while PsiPred uses Position Specific Iterated-BLAST (PSI-BLAST) to obtain evolutionary information used to predict the secondary structure of the query protein, DiANNA is a neural network that recognizes cysteines in an oxidized state. IL17A codes for a protein with 155 amino acids (aa) in humans and rodents. the interaction between interleukins and receptors is crucial for their function and signaling. a mutation occurs in the European rabbit and in the European brown hare. the 332Arg>Pro mutation in human Trim5 restricts infection by HIV-1. the 132Arg>Pro mutation in the helicase protein of coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus was lethal to infectivity in vitro. the amino acid present in the human IL17A sequence is underlined. IL17A appears in blue while IL17RA appears in grey. 88Arg>Pro mutation described for leporids. human IL17A is N-glycosylated at Asn68. other putative sites include asn56 in lagomorphs, pig, and cattle. killer whale and the africa bush elephant have no putative sites. for IL17A, similar results were obtained, with the human sequence more closely related to the European rabbit (0.169) than to mouse or rat IL17A sequences (0.236). this is further supported by a Maximum Likelihood tree inferred for IL17A mammalian sequences (Figure 3). a single mutation was detected within the interaction site with IL17RA which may induce crucial changes in IL17A structure, function, stability, signaling, and conformation. the lowest divergence between the European rabbit and human IL17A sequences reinforces the hypothesis that the European rabbit might be a more suitable animal model for studies in the human innate immunity."}
