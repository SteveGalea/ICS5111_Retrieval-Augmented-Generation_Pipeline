{"summary": "infections with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) have been reported from a number of countries and are important conditions in cats. the most common mode of transmission of these immunosuppressive retroviruses is through bite wounds. the most common mode of transmission of these retroviruses is through bite wounds. spatial analysis of FIV and FeLV infections can be a valuable tool in epidemiological understanding of these infections. however, the way areal units are defined can influence the results and inferences based on aggregated data. this has been termed the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) the cats included in this study were conveniently sampled from veterinary clinics and animal shelters across 40 contiguous states of the US and 9 Canadian provinces. the testing for FIV and FeLV was carried out in house or in laboratory using a commercially available ELISA (SNAP Combo FeLV antigen, PetCheck FIV Antibody, and PetCheck FeLV Antigen; IDEXX Laboratories) shelter 9600 241 2.5 (2.2\u20132.8) 166 1.7 (1.5\u20132.0) Age Juvenile 15461 160 1.0 (0.9\u20131.2) 198 1.3 (1.1\u20131.5) Adult 13453 755 5.6 (5.2\u20136.0) 585 4.4 (4.0\u20134.7) Sex Male intact 8649 372 4.3 (3.9\u20134.8) 240 2.8 (2.4\u20133.1) Male castrated 6027 299 5.0 (4.4\u20135.5) 198 3.3 (2.9\u20133.8 4 5 0\u201350 Cases 915 2.64 5.28 0\u201359 Tested 28914 83.57 125.81 1\u2013958 Postal code Seroprevalence 4 7 0\u2013100 Cases 915 1.43 1.78 0\u201326 Tested 28914 45.11 61.58 1\u2013838 FeLV State Seroprevalence 3 3 0\u201320 Cases 783 15.98 25.25 0\u2013145 Tested 28914 5 each Canadian FSA was assigned to the respective county and state based on the postal code conversion file available from StatCan. Moran's I test was applied to the smoothed seroprevalence estimates using empirical Bayesian smoothing. the spatial scan test was applied using the spdep package of statistical software R [23]. w ij is the spatial weights matrix which considers three nearest neighbours. the spatial scan test identifies potential clusters using circular windows of varying radius (size) and location (area centroids) across the study area. it was assumed that the number of FIV or FeLV cases in each area followed Poisson distribution with the expected number of cases in each area proportional to the covariate (risk factor) adjusted cat population [27] poisson distributed counts for rare disease or infections such as FIV and FeLV can be effectively modeled to assess its relationship with group-level risk factors. in this study, interest was to evaluate group-level risk factors for FIV and FeLV infections and quantify the effect of MAUP as change in magnitude and significance of regression parameters. the same model was fit to data at all 3 levels of aggregation (state, county, and postal code) to avoid any influence of the selection method or covariate(s) exclusion in the comparison of models. an exponential covariance structure was based on a semivariogram fitted to the deviance residuals of the Poisson regression models. the testing for FIV and FeLV was carried out in house or in laboratory using a commercially available ELISA. information on postal code of testing facility, type of testing facility (clinic or shelter), age of the cat (juvenile 6 months or adult), sex, and neuter status. information on postal code of testing facility, type of testing facility (clinic or shelter), age of the cat (juvenile 6 months or adult), sex, and neuter status. female spayed 4987 102 2.1 (1.7\u20132.5) 144 2.9 (2.4\u20133.4) Unknown 40 3 7.5 (1.7\u201320.4) 3 7.5 (1.7\u201320.4) Outdoor exposure No 7142 99 1.4 (1.1\u20131.7) 136 1.9 (1.6\u20132.3) Yes 17968 708 3.9 (3.7\u20134.2) 565 3.1 (2.9\u20133.4) Unknown 3804 108 2.8 (2.3\u20133.4) 82 2.2 (1.7\u20132.7) Health status Healthy 28914 83.57 125.81 1\u2013958 Postal code Seroprevalence 3 6 0\u2013100 Cases 783 1.22 2.12 0\u201319 Tested 28914 45.11 61.58 1\u2013838 aThe descriptive statistics for seroprevalence pertain to mean value among states, counties, or postal codes. Moran's I test was applied to the smoothed seroprevalence estimates using empirical Bayesian smoothing. the EB estimation technique can be interpreted as internal standardization. w ij is the spatial weights matrix which considers three nearest neighbours. the spatial scan test can be extended to detect clusters after adjustment for known risk factors or confounders for FIV and FeLV infections. the statistical significance of the clusters was established by 999 Monte Carlo replications with a significance level set to = 5%. the size of the scanning window in the spatial scan statistic was allowed to increase from individual areas and expanded to include neighbouring areas until a maximum of 50% of the total tested population. covariates were modeled as dichotomized variables with cut-offs for low and high categories set at median value (50%) of the respective covariates. the cut-off for categories of covariate FIV and FeLV seroprevalence was set at 3%, 8% and over 8%. an exponential covariance structure was based on a semivariogram fitted to the deviance residuals of the Poisson regression models. the presence of overdispersion in (nonspatial) Poisson regression models was evaluated by testing the model deviance against degrees of freedom using a 2 distribution and a 5% significance level. the Moran's I coefficient was estimated as follows: n i = 1 n i = j n w i j ( y i y ) 2. w ij is the spatial weights matrix which considers three nearest neighbours. spatial scan test identifies potential clusters using circular windows of varying radius (size) and location (area centroids) across the study area. detection of high-risk clusters would indicate the prevalence of FIV (or FeLV) inside the circular window as significantly higher than outside the window. in terms of clustering and cluster, geographic correlation analysis (or spatial regression modeling) for spatial data was carried out to quantify the effect of spatially referenced group-level risk factors on the spatial distribution of disease events. in this study, interest was to evaluate group-level risk factors for FIV and FeLV infections and to quantify the effect of MAUP as change in magnitude and significance of regression parameters. the cut-off of 3% is the general prevalence of FIV and FeLV in cats in north America. the same model was fit to data at all 3 levels of aggregation to avoid any influence of the selection method or covariate(s) exclusion in the comparison of models. a total of 634 postal codes (out of 648) were accurately matched during geocoding. seven records were reassigned to proper postal codes using clinic address. b SDc P value FIV Postal code 0.09 0.002 0.001 3.30 0.01 County 0.15 0.003 0.002 3.82 0.01 State 0.06 0.021 0.409 0.37 0.66 FeLV Postal code 0.12 0.002 0.001 4.05 0.01 County 0.15 0.003 0.002 3.53 0.01 State 0.021 0.011 0.18 0.42 aExpected value of Moran's I under the null hypothesis of no spatial autocorrelation cluster coordinatesa Radiusb Obsc Popd Expe Obs/exp P value State 1 45.894, 73.425 0.00 118 1270 72.56 1.63 0.01 County 1 41.615, 73.201 191.69 118 1191 69.26 1.70 0.01 2 53.329, 114.075 0.00 33 462 13.46 2.45 0.01 3 41.621, 83.653 641.51 345 9648 279.73 1.23 0.01 4 2 Expe Obs/exp P value State 1 48.045, 54.689 1437.00 164 2827 93.48 1.75 0.01 2 45.228, 93.998 637.96 78 1918 47.37 1.65 0.01 3 34.341, 80.767 999.14 272 10089 209.11 1.30 0.01 County 1 48.785, 55.986 1381.90 162 2789 90.83 1.78 0.01 2 47.109, 94.917 seroprevalence of FeLV infections was higher among areas with greater proportion of intact males and cats tested at clinics and with a higher seroprevalence of FIV. associations observed at postal code and county levels may not be evident at the state level (e.g., percentage of juvenile cats in an area and FeLV) 50 Ref Ref Ref >50 0.66 (0.52\u20130.84) 0.01 0.78 (0.65\u20130.94) 0.01 0.74 (0.5\u20131.08) 0.13 % female intact 50 Ref Ref Ref >50 1.25 (0.97\u20131.61) 0.09 1.18 (0.96\u20131.45) 0.12 0.63 (0.36\u20131.09) 0.10 % male intact 50 Ref Ref >50 1.05 (0.82\u20131.35) 0.69 0.88 (0.72\u20131.07) 0.19 2.0 value County P value PRa (95% CI) PRa (95% CI) PRa (95% CI) % juvenile 50 Ref Ref Ref >50 0.76 (0.56\u20131.02) 0.07 0.91 (0.71\u20131.16) 0.44 0.83 (0.57\u20131.21) 0.35 % female intact 50 Ref Ref Ref >50 0.73 (0.53\u20130.99) 0.04 0.77 (0.59\u20131) 0.05 0.94 (0.55\u20131.62) 0.83 % male intact spatial epidemiological methods are sensitive to choice of the spatial aggregation scale for analysis, that is, affected by the MAUP. Moran's I coefficient indicated clustering of FIV and FeLV positive test results. but the strength and significance of clustering varied across spatial aggregation levels. the results from the spatial scan test can be influenced by spatial aggregation as evident from the difference in size, number, and location of clusters for both FIV and FeLV infections. the sampled counties and postal codes were not very different with respect to population characteristics and thus may be insensitive to aggregation effects. the seroprevalence of FIV and FeLV in shelter cat populations mirrors that of cat populations served by veterinary clinics. testing in shelters is driven by housing considerations and potential for adoption, whereas at clinics mostly sick cats are tested. this study did not identify any covariate consistently associated with the outcome across all three aggregation levels. the geographic scales on which these two variables are meaningful factors probably include scales larger than postal code. most of the predictor variables were only significant at lower levels of aggregation. ive Statistics A total of 28,914 test results were included in this study from 688 veterinary clinics and 158 animal shelters. a total of 634 recorded postal codes (out of 648) were accurately matched during geocoding. seven records were accurately matched during geocoding. spatial cluster Detection Tables 3(a)-3(b) and Figures 1 and 2 display detailed information for all clusters identified by the spatial scan statistic. for both FIV and FeLV infections, spatial clusters were detected at all aggregation levels. disease clusters as identified by the spatial scan test for FIV infections among cats in the US and Canada. level differed with respect to size and location. dtotal number of cats in the cluster; eexpected number of ELISA positive cats under Poisson assumption. aLongitude and latitude coordinates of the center of cluster; bradius in kilometers; cobserved number of ELISA positive cats; eexpected number of ELISA positive cats. spatial clusters of FeLV infections (red circles) identified by the spatial scan test at postal code, county and state level aggregation. black open circles represent region centroids. postal code, county, and state levels respectively, with a P value of. aPrevalence ratios obtained by exponentiation of respective coefficients are interpreted as prevalence ratios. rate/risk ratios are interpreted as prevalence ratios. a total of 28,914 test results were included in this study from 688 veterinary clinics and 158 animal shelters. a total of 634 recorded postal codes (out of 648) were accurately matched during geocoding. spatial clustering was identified for FeLV at postal code and county level aggregations (I = 0.12 and 0.15, resp., P 0.01) at state level of aggregation no spatial clustering was detected.
