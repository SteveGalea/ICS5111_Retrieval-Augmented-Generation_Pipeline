{"summary": "from November 1, 2002 to June 18, 2003, 8465 probable SARS cases were reported to the world health organization from 29 countries. the case\u2013fatality proportion was 10%. the spread of the virus has been averted, but the re-emergence of SARS is still in question (3\u20136) 3CLPro protease of SARS-CoV has been considered an important molecular target for anti-SARS-CoV drug discovery and developments. we also examined crude extracts from various teas and a panel of representative natural products in teas for their inhibitory activities against SARS-3CLPro. ITSAVLQSGFRKMA-COOH corresponding to an autocleavage site of the SARS-3CLPro was synthesized and used for protease cleavage activity assay. the highly purified protein was shown by high-performance liquid chromatography to exhibit proteolytic activity in trans. the extracts were then filtered through a millex-GS 0.22 m filter (Millipore, Malsheim, France) to remove particulate matter. the extracts were then evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain viscous masses. these materials were evaluated for their inhibitory activities against SARS-3CLPro. fluorescence due to cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate peptide catalyzed by the protease was monitored at 538 nm with excitation at 355 nm using a fluorescence plate reader. the protease was stored in a buffer containing 12 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 7.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 1 a full-length 3CLPro of SARS coronavirus was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. a 15mer peptide with sequence H2N-SITSAVLQSGFRKMA-COOH corresponding to an autocleavage site of the SARS-3CLPro was synthesized. crude extracts from oolong tea, green tea, black tea and Puer tea were prepared. the extracts were then filtered through a millex-GS 0.22 m filter. the extracts were then evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain viscous masses. using a solvent system comprising solvents A and B mixed using a gradient starting with 100% A, linearly decreasing to 10% A in 8 min, to 100% A in 16 min. the UV detector was set at 214 nm. the development of a fluorescent protease activity assay has been reported previously (7). two compounds, tannic acid and TF2B, were found to be active against 3CLPro. tannic acid is a water-soluble polyphenol present in plant food. tea polyphenols and many tannin components are thought to be anticarcinogenic. methylxanthine (caffeine and theophylline) did not influence 3CLPro activity. catechins, including C, EC, ECg, EGC and EGCg, present in green tea (unfermented) and oolong tea (partial fermented) also did not inhibit 3CLPro activity. catalyzed by the protease was monitored at 538 nm with exicitation at 355 nm using a fluorescence plate reader. numerous black tea polyphenols (especially those of TF1, TF2 and TF3) were found to inhibit 3CLPro. two compounds, tannic acid and TF2B, were found to be active against 3CLPro. tannic acid is a water-soluble polyphenol present in plant food. tea polyphenols and many tannin components are thought to be anticarcinogenic. methylxanthine (caffeine and theophylline) did not influence 3CLPro activity; catechins, including C, EC, ECg, EGC and EGCg, present in green tea (unfermented) and oolong tea (partial fermented) also did not inhibit 3CLPro activity. the enhanced fluorescence due to cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate peptide catalyzed by the protease was monitored at 538 nm with exicitation at 355 nm using a fluorescence plate reader. numerous black tea polyphenols (especially those of TF1, TF2 and TF3) were found to inhibit 3CLPro. tannic acid and TF2B were identified using the HPLC proteolytic assay to inhibit 50% of the proteolytic acitivity of 3CLPro at concentrations 10 M. both tannic acid and TF2B belong to the group of natural polyphenols found in teas. TF1, TF2 and TF3 were more potent 3CLPro inhibitors than catechins in green tea. green tea contains 30% of catechins, black tea contains 9% of catechins and 4% of theaflavins. black tea contains 9% of catechins and 4% of theaflavins (19) theaflavins extracted from black tea neutralize bovine coronavirus and rotavirus infections. it will be very interesting to evaluate, in a separate study, whether drinking black tea can prevent or alleviate the infection of an enteric form of coronavirus."}
