{"summary": "polymorphisms of IFN-,TNF- and IL-10 affect the susceptibility to and outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome. results IFN- +874A allele was associated with susceptibility to SARS in a dose-dependent manner. interleukin 10 (IL-10) is an antiinflammatory cytokine that inhibits the activation and effector function of Th1 cells, monocytes, and macrophages. IL-10 appears to limit and ultimately terminate inflammatory responses by blocking the expression of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. a high IL-10 level would result in suppression of innate host defense. polymorphism of the genes genotyped Genes SNPs rs number References IFN- IFN- +874 A/T rs2430561 [23] IL-10 IL-10 -1082 A/G rs1800896 [23,26-27] IL-10 -592 A/G rs1800896 [23,26-27] IL-10 -592 A/C rs1800872 TNF- TNF- -308 genotypes of all 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were compared between the SARS patients and healthy controls by 3 2 and 2 2 chi square test respectively. logistic regression was used for calculating OR with 95% CI and corresponding P-values between groups. genotypes and alleles of the 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were compared between the SARS patients and healthy controls. logistic regression was used for calculating OR with 95% CI and corresponding P-values between groups by controlling age and sex as covariables. the genotypes of all SNPs were tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) by chi square test. allele IFN- +874 0.001 A/A 332 (69.8) 203 (45.2) 5.19 (2.78 \u2013 9.68) A/T 127 (26.7) 189 (42.1) 2.57 (1.35 \u2013 4.88) T/T 17 (3.6) 57 (12.7) Reference IL-10 -1082 NS A/A 439 (92.2) 411 (91.5) the mechanism by which the IFN- +874A/T allele influences the susceptibility to SARS may depend on its role in the regulation of IFN- production. the role of IFN- in antiviral response against SARS-CoV has also been supported by recent studies showing that IFN- can inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV in combination with IFN- in vitro. genetype frequencies among survival and death SARS cases SNP Death (n = 57) Survival (n = 415) P Number (%) Genotype IFN- +874 NS A/A 41 (71.9) 289 (69.6) A/T 13 (22.8) 112 (27.0) T/T 3 (5.3) 14 (3.4) IL-10-1082 NS A/A 52 (91.2) 383 (92.3) A/G 4 (7.0) 31 (7.5) G/G 1 (1.8) 1 this work is supported by the Outstanding Researcher Awards (YLL & JSMP), Postgraduate Studentships (WPC, GHWT, MWN) and Edward Sai Kim Hotung Paediatric Education and Research Fund."}
