{"summary": "the world health organization was notified of 1,698 laboratory-confirmed human cases and at least 609 human deaths from 26 countries as of March 2016. primary infections have originated from countries within the Arabian Peninsula, but travel-associated cases and some secondary and nosocomial transmissions have been reported in other countries. dromedary camels are part of the culture of millions of people in the middle east. most dromedary camels are bred in east africa countries, primarily in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and Sudan. 1.2 million camels were imported to Egypt in the last 5 to 6 years. sheep (n = 51), goats (n = 36), donkeys (n = 15), donkeys (n = 15), buffaloes (n = 4) and horses (n = 4). milk samples (3\u20135mL; n=38) and rectal swabs (in 1mL viral transport media; n=13) were also collected from camels. equal volumes of 200 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of dromedary MERS-CoV Egypt NRCE-HKU270 (Egypt 270) after 1 hour of incubation, 35 L of the virus\u2013serum mixture were added in quadruplicate to vero-E6 cell monolayers in 96-well microtitre plates. after 1 hour of adsorption, an additional 150 L of culture medium were added to each well. dRp, or N gene RT-PCR assay as described earlier [24,26] PCR products were analysed by sequencing using the protocol available on the web. the PCR product was submitted to a second PCR round using the same primers as in the first round. conditions were 98 \u00b0C for 30 s then 45 cycles (98 \u00b0C for 10 s, 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, 72 \u00b0C for 60 s), then 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. final PCR product was gel purified and sequenced with the same primers at the macrogen sequencing facility (Macrogen, South Korea) milk samples (3\u20135mL; n=38) and rectal swabs (in 1mL viral transport media; n=13) were also collected from camels. 109 throat swabs and 91 sera were collected from 24 fruit bats. origin of camels was identified at the place of quarantine in a village. after 1 hour of incubation, 35 L of the virus\u2013serum mixture were added in quadruplicate to vero-E6 cell monolayers in 96-well microtitre plates. after 1 hour of adsorption, an additional 150 L of culture medium were added to each well. the plates were then incubated for three more days at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. PCR products were analysed by sequencing using the protocol available on the web. a partial 640 bp fragment of the spike gene was amplified using 50-Fwd (5\u2019-CCAATTTA-CGCCAGGATGAT-3\u2019) primers in the first round using one step RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN) and a total reaction volume of 25 L. the final PCR product was gel purified and subsequently sequenced with the same primers at the macrogen sequencing facility (Macrogen, South Korea) one positive imported sample (NC2603/2015) from Sudan was subjected to whole genome sequencing according to a previously published procedure. the PCR cycler conditions were 98 \u00b0C for 30 s then 45 cycles (98 \u00b0C for 10 s, 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, 72 \u00b0C for 60 s), then 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. the final PCR product was gel purified and then sequenced with the same primers at the macrogen sequencing facility (Macrogen, South Korea) a subset of 1,078 camels, a subset of 1,031 underwent serum testing for MERS-CoV antibodies by microneutralisation assays. the seroprevalence was significantly higher in imported (614/692; 88.7%) than in resident camels. adult camels had significantly higher seroprevalence (87.3%) than young camels (51.8%) mERS-CoV surveillance test results in camels based on sampling site, age and sex, Egypt, August 2015\u2013January 2016 (n = 1,078 camelsa). mERS-CoV surveillance test result in camels based on sampling site, age and sex, August 2015\u2013January 2016. a subset of 1,031 camels underwent serum sampling for MERS-CoV antibodies by microneutralisation assays. both male and female camels had a comparable level of seroprevalence (85.1% and 82.7% respectively), and risk of seropositivity. none of the 91 tested bats was positive for MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies. sequences obtained from 15 strongly positive samples were derived from one camel residing in Egypt as well as from camels imported from Sudan. the tree suggested sequences from camels investigated in Egypt formed separate groups from previously published sequences of MERS-CoV. a subset of 1,031 camels underwent serum testing for MERS-CoV antibodies by microneutralisation assays, while all were sampled for rtRT-PCR testing. the virus sequenced for this study is marked by a red square. seroprevalence was significantly higher in imported (614/692; 88.7%) than in resident camels. adult camels had significantly higher seroprevalence (87.3%) than young camels (51.8%). a subset of 1,078 camels underwent serum sampling for MERS-CoV antibodies by microneutralisation assays. both male and female camels had a comparable (p > 0.05) level of seroprevalence (85.1% and 82.7% respectively), and risk of seropositivity (Table 2). sample from a sheep had 1:640 neutralising titre. none of the 91 tested bats was positive for MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies. the confirmed PCR-positive MERS-CoV cases was significantly higher in females than males. the tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. phylogenetic analysis was done using the neighbour-joining algorithm with the Kimura two-parameter model. almost 70% of the imported camels in the past five years originated from the Sudan and the rest from east africa, mainly from Ethiopia. the animals often travel long distances by trucks and may be moved from one live animal market to another. testing of archived dromedary sera revealed that 93.6% of camels originating from Sudan were seropositive for the virus. the number of confirmed PCR positive MERS-CoV animals was significantly higher in female and male camels than males. the number of confirmed PCR positive MERS-CoV animals was significantly higher in females than males (p 0.05) there was however no significant difference in rtRT-PCR positive cases between the age groups. six sheep reacted to MERS-CoV antigens but without neutralising antibodies. all the 109 bats in the present study were negative for MERS-CoV. a systematic longitudinal study is needed to follow up imported camels."}
