{"summary": "more than 500 bats were collected from 25 locations across the country. the number of samples and the collection protocol were justified and approved by the National Museums of Kenya and the Kenyan Wildlife Service. inary attempts to culture bartonella spp. from bat blood showed that the technique developed for isolation of these bacteria is appropriate for processing bat samples. agar plates supplemented by a 10% addition of rabbit blood were incubated at 35\u00b0C in an aerobic atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide for 30 days postinoculation. PCR amplifications were performed in a 25-L reaction mixture containing 5 L 5 Green GoTaq PCR buffer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 0.4 mol of each primer, 200 M each dNTP, 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), and 20 ng of template DNA. positive and negative controls were included with each PCR to evaluate the presence of appropriately sized amplicons and contamination. blood samples collection More than 500 bats were collected from 25 locations across Kenya. the number of samples and the collection protocol were justified and approved by the National Museums of Kenya and the Kenyan Wildlife Service. agar plates were supplemented with 10% amphotericin B. blood from bats was resuspended in brain\u2013heart infusion (BHI) broth. this ratio was difficult to adhere to for samples with a limited amount of blood. agar plates were inoculated with bat blood and harvested and stored in 10% glycerol. amplification of the gltA Fragment A heavy suspension of the microorganisms was heated for 10 min at 95\u00b0C followed by 1-min centrifugation at 8,000 rpm to precipitate the lysed cells. the supernant containing the genomic DNA was then moved to a clean centrifuge tube. Sequencing reactions were performed in a PTC 200 Peltier Thermal cycler by using the same primers as the initial PCR with a concentration of 1.6 M. the sequence analysis software was used to align and compare homologous Bartonella spp. gltA sequences obtained from bat samples and from the GenBank database. miniopterus spp. and T. persicus bats were at significantly higher risk for being infected with Bartonella spp. when each was compared with all other bats. bat species no. tested no. (%) positive Relative risk p value Miniopterus spp. 58 gltA genotypes represented 11 genogroups with a sequence identity value of >96% between genotypes within each group, as proposed by La Scola et al. (28), as a cutoff for this specific gene fragment for species definition within the Bartonella genus. the level of gltA sequence identity between 16 bartonella genotypes identified in E. helvum bats varied greatly, ranging from 78.6%\u2013100%. eight genotypes (sequence variants) were clustered around 4 clades (genogroups) the first genogroup, M1, consisted of 30 sequences from M. minor bats, 1 sequence from M. africanus bats, 1 sequence from M. natalensis bats, and 2 sequences from an unidentified species of Miniopterus spp. bats. the second genogroup, M2, consisted of 5 sequences from M. minor bats, 2 sequences from M. africanus bats, 1 sequence from M. natalensis bat the time required for growth of Bartonella spp. colonies on agar greatly varied from 3 days, observed for several samples from Triaenops persicus bats to 28 days. all isolates were confirmed genetically by amplification. bat species no. tested No. (%) positive Relative risk p value Miniopterus spp. 87 49 (56) 2.41 0.0001 Eidolon helvum 88 23 (26) NS Rousettus aegyptiacus 105 22 (21) 0.6 0.01 Coleura afra 9 4 (44) NS Triaenops persicus 8 7 (88) 2.85 0.001 Hipposideros commerson six unique genetic variants identified in R. aegyptiacus bats were clustered in a monophyletic genogroup, marked as R in Figure 2. Phylogenetic relations among the citrate synthase sequences of Bartonella spp. genotypes detected in bats from Kenya and previously described Bartonella spp. all 7 gltA sequences identified in T. persicus bats formed a monophyletic genogroup. the identity range of 98.2%\u201399.7% within the group. the only isolate obtained from H. commersoni bats also differed from all described Bartonella strains or sequences. an insufficient number of isolates were available to describe an association of specific Bartonella spp. lineages to certain Miniopterus spp. bats. 1 genotype, M3, from M. natalensis bats, was distant from both groups (identity 90%), but was relatively close to the genotype identified in a whiskered bat (Myotis mystacinus) from the united kingdom (11). Discussion This investigation has resulted in the identification and characterization of Bartone bats carry a wide range of ectoparasites, including bat flies, fleas, soft ticks, and mites. diverse arthropods, such as sandflies, lice, fleas, ticks, and mites, have been implicated as potential vectors. limited information is available to suggest alternative mechanisms beyond vector transmission may be responsible for the spread of Bartonella spp. infections among animals. a strong association exists between specific Bartonella species and their mammalian hosts. some observations have indicated that 1 species of Bartonella can infect a variety of rodent species at a given site in Europe (35). bats are known as principal reservoir hosts of lyssaviruses. in africa, these include Lagos bat virus, which circulates in pteropid bats. several species of African bats have been shown to harbor coronaviruses."}
