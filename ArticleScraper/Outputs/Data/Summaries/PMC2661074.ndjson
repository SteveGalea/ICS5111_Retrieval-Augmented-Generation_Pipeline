{"summary": "health care workers (HCWs) are essential to the health system response. but there are few studies exploring HCW attitudes towards pandemic influenza. the aim of this study was to explore HCWs knowledge, attitudes and intended behaviour towards pandemic influenza. endemicity and expanding outbreaks of avian influenza have highlighted the threat of a future global influenza pandemic. experts at WHO believe that the world is closer to another influenza pandemic than at any time since 1968. the aim of this study was to extend previous research by assessing the knowledge and intended behaviour during an influenza pandemic amongst clinical and non-clinical hospital staff. the original version of the questionnaire was pilot tested with five health care workers who were similar in their characteristics to the members of the study population. convenience sample of 1200 (15%) staff members was randomly selected to be surveyed from the 8000 staff members who work in the two hospitals. only 894 staff members returned the survey to us immediately or by interoffice mail. the original version of the questionnaire was pilot tested with five health care workers who were similar in their characteristics to the members of the study population. the original version of the questionnaire was pilot tested, with five health care workers who were similar in their characteristics to the members of the study population. four groups were surveyed: medical (Staff specialists, registrars, medical students etc) Allied Health Personnel (physiotherapists, occupational therapists, psychologists etc) and Ancillary staff (domestic services, administration, computer specialists etc). each ward/department was individually coded with an identification number, known only to the research investigators. in the paediatric hospital, 8.6% (559/2000) of the staff members completed the survey. in the adult's hospital, 8.6% (520/6000) of the staff members completed the survey. of 1079 respondents, 43.8% (n = 473) were able to correctly identify the meaning of \"pandemic influenza\" 54.4% (n = 559) incorrectly labelled a pandemic as either \"a large outbreak of

or a factor of time, with knowledge and intentions changing as exposure to information about PI increases. more than 80% were willing and/or able to report to work during a catastrophic disaster in new york city. only 57% to 68% would be willing to report to work during a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or smallpox outbreak. inappropriate working behaviours were identified when participants were asked to nominate their potential response in a given situation. if they had symptoms consistent with pandemic influenza, 24% of medical staff and 26% of ancillary staff said yes. a second scenario, participants were asked whether they would attend work if a close family member was diagnosed. study by Shiao et al examined a cohort of people quarantined during the 2003 SARS outbreak in canada. authors found that compliance could have been improved by providing enhanced education and support. authors also felt that this could have also reduced psychological distress in the quarantined adults. the online invitation to complete the survey electronically was seen by an unknown number of staff at the paediatric hospital. however, the paper-based survey was comprehensive, yielding a large sample and acceptable response rate. it is also unknown whether responses given to hypothetical situations accurately reflect real-world responses of the respondents in the event of an actual influenza pandemic. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions HS participated in the design of the study and survey and undertook the distribution and collection."}
