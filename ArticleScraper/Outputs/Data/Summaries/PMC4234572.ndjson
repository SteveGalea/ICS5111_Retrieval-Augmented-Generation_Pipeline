{"summary": "interleukin (IL) 10 is a critical regulatory cytokine produced by many types of cells that determine the balance between inflammation and immune regulation by influencing antigen presentation, T-cell differentiation, cytokine production, and intensity of inflammation (12, 13). IL-10 deficiency did not affect virus replication or peak virus titers. mRNA expression measured by quantitative real-time PCR in the brains (filled square) and spinal cords (open square) of NSV-infected WT mice. Ct values and fold change were normalized to GAPDH. response by isolating and counting cells infiltrating the brain. hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained coronal sections for inflammation increased through 7 d after infection. flow cytometry used flow cytometry for identification of cells isolated from the brain. data are presented as the mean SEM of three WT (black bars) and three IL-10/ (open bars) mice. the total number of cells per brain and frequency (percentage of live cells) of microglia. Flow cytometry and intracellular cytokine staining were used to measure production of effector molecules TNF, IFN, and granzyme B. at 5 d after infection, the percentage of CD8+ T cells expressing granzyme B was lower in IL-10/ mice than WT mice. decrease in CD8+ T cells producing granzyme B in IL-10/ mice would be predicted to decrease, rather than increase, cytotoxicity. contour plots show the gating of CD8+ T cells that produce IFN, TNF, and granzyme B at 5 d (A) and 7 d (H) after infection. the frequency of CD8+ T cells that produce IFN (B and I), TNF (D and K), and granzyme B (F and M) was calculated as the mean SEM from three independent experiments. in the frequency (2.97% vs. 14.62%, P = 0.0063; Fig. 4D) and in the number (6.4 102 vs. 5.2 103 cells per brain, P = 0.0153; Fig. 4E) of IL-17\u2013producing CD4+ T cells in IL-10/ mice compared with WT mice. gene Ct values were normalized to Gapdh, and fold change was calculated relative to uninfected controls. data are shown as the mean SEM from three independent experiments. Th17 cells in the CNS of mice with Fatal Viral Encephalomyelitis have a pathogenic phenotype that Is Enhanced in the Absence of IL-10. accelerated disease correlated with an increase in the Th17, but not the Th1, response. mononuclear cells were isolated and pooled from brains of WT and IL-10/ mice 5 d after infection and stimulated with PMA and ionomycin. contour plots show the gating for GM-CSF, granzyme B, and IL-22 production within the CD4+ T-cell population. the Th17 cells in the brains of IL-10/ mice had higher mean fluorescence intensities for GM-CSF than those in the brains of WT mice. a definitive role for a particular Th17 product could not be identified because neither treatment with neutralizing antibody to IL-17 nor GM-CSF improved the outcome. t+ with very few Th1/Th17 cells (IFN+IL-17A+) in the absence of IL-10, there was also an increase in the Th1/Th17 population. mononuclear cells isolated from the brains (n = 6\u201310) of WT and IL-10/ mice 5 d after infection were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin in the presence of brefeldin A. IL-10 KO (orange) relative to an isotype control (gray, filled) contour plots and histograms are representative of three independent experiments. populations of pathogenic Th17 cells are present in the CNS at the onset of neurological disease in WT and IL-10/ mice. disease was accelerated in IL-10/ mice with more rapid onset of paralysis. IL-10 deficiency did not affect virus replication or peak virus titers. titers at day 7 suggest that virus clearance was delayed. the clinical score scale was as follows: 0, no symptoms; 1, abnormal hind-limb and tail posture, ruffled fur, and/or hunched back; 2, unilateral hind-limb paralysis; 3, bilateral hind-limb paralysis and/or moribund; 4, dead. survival was assessed using a Kaplan\u2013Meier curve and log-rank test. WT mice had more monocyte/macrophages (P 0.05; Fig. 2F), and IL-10/ mice had more neutrophils (P 0.01; Fig. 2 H and I) at 7 d after infection. the inflammatory response to NSV infection is similar in WT and IL-10/ mice. 8+ T cells (N and O) were determined. the data represent the mean SEM from two to four independent experiments. IL-10/ mice would be predicted to decrease, rather than increase, cytotoxicity. at 7 d after infection, no differences were observed between WT and IL-10/ mice. differences in numbers or function of CD8+ T cells did not explain accelerated disease in IL-10/ mice. the number of CD8+ T cells that produce IFN (C and J), TNF (E and L), and granzyme B (G and N) was calculated as the mean SEM from three independent experiments. IL-10 Deficiency Increases the Numbers of Th17 Cells in the CNS. the response is increased in the brains of IL-10/ mice compared with WT mice at the onset of clinical disease. mononuclear cells were isolated from the brains (n = 6\u201310) of WT and IL-10/ mice at 5 d after NSV infection. mRNA levels for Il17a and chemokine Ccl20 were higher in IL-10/ mice. both Th1 and Th17 cells began infiltrating the CNS of mice coincident with the onset of paralysis. Th17 cells from both WT and IL-10/ mice expressed all three cytokines. proportions of Th17 cells producing granzyme B were greater in WT than IL-10/ mice, but there were more granzyme B+ and IL-22+. histograms show fluorescence intensity of GM-CSF and granzyme B expression in Th17 cells isolated from the brains of WT (black) and IL-10/ (orange) mice. the frequencies and numbers of CD4+IL-17A+ T cells producing GM-CSF (B and C), granzyme B (E and F), and IL-22 (G and H) in NSV-infected WT (black) and IL-10/ (white) a definitive role for a particular Th17 product could not be identified. neither treatment with neutralizing antibody to IL-17 nor GM-CSF improved the outcome in IL-10/ or WT mice compared with control antibody. mice 5 d after infection were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin in presence of brefeldin A to assess production of IFN and IL-17A by CD4+ T cells. Plots are representative of three independent experiments. the increased presence of Th1/Th17 cells in the absence of IL-10 suggests that these cells are regulated by IL-10 and may contribute to the accelerated disease progression. IL-10 expression increased in the CNS after infection and was identified as a critical regulator of the Th17 and Th1/Th17 response. functional characterization of the Th17 cells revealed a pathogenic phenotype with production of granzyme B, IL-22, and GM-CSF. a role for IL-17 in neuronal damage cannot be excluded because of unknown CNS penetration of the antibody. the functional features of Th17 cells have identified pathogenic Th17 and Th1/17 cells as participants in the immunopathologic process leading to fatal viral encephalomyelitis. this understanding of the pathogenesis of acute virus-induced neurologic disease will aid in identifying therapeutic interventions that focus on immune modulation as well as antiviral drugs. samples in which no virus was detected at a 1:10 dilution were assigned a value of 0.85, halfway between the limit of detection and 0.
