{"summary": "the aim of the present study was to identify the association between FCGR polymorphisms and cryptococcal meningitis. we genotyped four functional polymorphisms in low-affinity FcRs, including FCGR2A 131H/R, FCGR3A 158F/V, FCGR3B NA1/NA2, and FCGR2B 232I/T. cryptococcal meningitis is the most common opportunistic fungal infection of the central nervous system in AIDS patients. however, MBL deficiency was present in only 21% of the cases. underlying mechanism for susceptibility remained unclear. FCGR2A 131R/R had been associated with the susceptibility of meningococcal infection, community-acquired pneumonia, and the development of severe malaria [10]\u2013[12]. FCGR2A 131H/H was reported to contribute to higher risk of bacteremia in pneumococcal CAP patients [13] clinical information and predisposing factors are summarized in Table 1. of the 190 healthy control subjects, 111 were male (58.4%). median age of the control subjects was 44 years (range, 12\u201379 years). some patients had more than one predisposing factor. some patients had more than one predisposing factor. c Immunosuppressive agents including cyclosporine, tripterygium glycosides, vincristine, etc. controls (190) N % P OR (95% CI) N % P OR (95% CI) N % FCGR2A 131H/H (Dominant b) 47

confirmed cases and 16 probable cases of cryptococcal meningitis. 59 were with predisposing factors and 58 were apparently healthy. d There was a haplotype of FCGR3B NA (141G-147C-227G-277A-349A) in controls. the other data were all analyzed with 22 2 test. some patients had more than one predisposing factor. patients with one or more conditions including disturbance of consciousness, cerebral herniation, and death were classified as severe cases. an association was found between FCGR2B 232I/T genotypes and cryptococcal meningitis based on dominant and over-dominant model. no significant difference was found in the distribution of FCGR2A 131H/R, FCGR3A 158 F/V and FCGR3B NA1/NA2 genotypes in patients with cryptococcal meningitis and controlsa. 79 75 0.644 1.110 (0.71\u20131.73) 250 66

among other Asian populations. there seems no marked difference in the distribution of FCGR3A 158F/V genotypes between the Asian and Caucasian populations. the T>G SNP at position 158 of FCGR3A causes a phenylalanine (F) to valine (V) substitution (FCGR23A 131F/V) and FCGR3A 158V/V encoded receptors show higher affinity to IgG1 and IgG3 [35], [36] in the FCGR3B gene, five nucleotides (141,147,227,277 and 349) are combined to form two main haplo ccal meningitis was associated with the FCGR2B 232I/T genotypes, which was not reported in Metediatis\u2019 study. the mutation genotype FCGR2B 232T/T is a susceptible genotype for systemic lupus erythematosus [17], [22], [32], and also provided protective effect for severe malaria in East africa children [17]. the reason for the heterozygotes 232I/T rather than 232T/T under-presented in our patients and those acute ITP children has not been clarified. the cause for discrepant results may be multifactorial, one was the ethnic differences between the two studies. a total of 200 volunteers and 117 unrelated patients were recruited for the present study. patients who met at least one of the following criteria were considered as probable cryptococcal meningitis. idiopathic CD4+ T lymphocytopenia (within 90 days before onset of cryptococcal meningitis) [44], and idiopathic CD4+ T lymphocytopenia (within 90 days before onset of cryptococcal meningitis) were also included. 190 healthy volunteers were included in the control group. bp primer sequence Extension primer sequence FCGR2A 131H/R (rs1801274) 587

according to reference sequences from dbSNP (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/) there were homologous sequences between FCGRs, the specificity sequences were checked with the sequence databases using BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/blast.cgi) each primer pair was tested for potential primer-dimer and hairpin structures extension reaction to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms in the PCR products was performed in a total volume of 10 L containing 2 L purified PCR product, 1 L primer (the concentration was 0.8 M), 5 L SNaPshot Multiplex Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and 2 L ultrapure water. each extended product was added to 1 U shrimp alkaline phosphatase, incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour, and a total of 200 volunteers and 117 unrelated patients with proven or probably diagnosed cryptococcal meningitis were recruited for the present study. patients who met at least one of the following criteria were considered as probable cryptococcal meningitis. latex-Cryptococcus antigen detection system (Immuno-Mycologics) patients and volunteers were assessed for predisposing factors as follow. patients without any of the above mentioned predisposing factors were considered as apparently healthy hosts. 190 healthy volunteers were included in the control group. multiplex SNaPshot detection of single-base extended probe primers was based on

fragments of 587\u20132394 bp and 8 primers for SNaPshot extension reactions were designed by Primer3 online software. there were homologous sequences between FCGRs, the specificity sequences were checked with the sequence databases using BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/blast.cgi) the cycling conditions for FCGR2B and FCGR3B were 95\u00b0C for 2 min, 35 cycles using 96\u00b0C for 20 s, 62\u00b0C for 2 min, and 72\u00b0C for 3 min, then 72\u00b0C for 10 min, and finally kept at 4\u00b0C. PCR products were then purified (add 1U SAP enzyme to 10 L PCR products, incubate at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour, then, inactivate at 75\u00b0C for 15 min) Genotypes were determined by the type of nucleotide presented at SNP site. random sample of 5% of cases and controls was genotyped twice by different researchers, with a reproducibility of 100%. the minor allele counts were compared with database."}
