{"summary": "hDPP4 coding sequence was cloned into a plasmid containing the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 genomic regions of human cytokeratin 18 (K18). the K18 3\u2032 region consists of exon 6, intron 6, exon 7, and approximately 300 base pairs of 3\u2032. four K18-hDPP4 transgenic founder lines were generated and intranasally inoculated with 1 105 plaque-forming units. data are mean standard deviation [SD] for 6\u201310 mice/line. hDPP4 was propagated and titered by plaque assay on vero-81 cells. cytokeratin 18 (K18)\u2013hDPP4 transgenic mice were immunized in the foot pad with 1 105 infectious units (IU) of VRP-S or VRP-GFP in 20 L of PBS. two weeks after the second immunization, mice received 1 105 plaque-forming units. nontransgenic mice received 1 105 IU of VRP-S or VRP-GFP. two weeks later, serum was harvested and 300 L of serum transferred into K18-hDPP4 mice intraperitoneally 1 day before infection. the hDPP4 coding sequence was cloned into a plasmid containing the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 genomic regions of human cytokeratin 18 (K18) the K18 5\u2032 genomic region consists of a 2.5-kb upstream genomic sequence, promoter, and first intron of the human K18 gene. the K18 3\u2032 region consists of exon 6, intron 6, exon 7, and approximately 300 base pairs of 3\u2032 untranslated region of the human ylazine and infected intranasally with MERS-CoV in 50 L of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) mice were examined daily and temperatures and weights recorded. non-transgenic littermates served as controls. cytokeratin 18 (K18)\u2013hDPP4 transgenic mice were immunized in the foot pad with 1 105 infectious units (IU) of VRP-S or VRP-GFP. two weeks later, serum was harvested and 300 L of serum transferred into K18-hDPP4 mice intraperitoneally 1 day before MERS-CoV infection. we generated 8 SPC-hDPP4 founder lines and 4 K18-hDPP4 founder lines. we first screened F2 mice from each founder line for evidence of a pulmonary infection following intranasal inoculation with 1 105 PFU of MERS-CoV. titers achieved in the K18-hDPP4 lines exceeded those in the SPC-hDPP4 lines. MERS-CoV titers were highest in lung tissue 2 days after infection. virus titers in brain were undetectable at 2 days after infection. RNA was abundant in lung 2 and 4 days after infection. RNA was detected in brain tissue 4 days after infection. PP4 mice (n = 2) to uninfected K18-hDPP4 mice (n = 3) housed in the same cages. no virus RNA was detected in the brain, lung, or blood of these healthy cohoused mice. this was not surprising, however, since mice do not cough or sneeze.

SK-N-SH cells, porcine astrocytes, and control Vero-81 cells supported virus replication. interferons occurred later in the brain and did not reach the same levels as in lung. peak expression of RIG-I, MDA5, PKR, MYD88, tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1, CCL2, CCL5 and CXCL10 was greater in the brain than in the lung at the later time points. no virus was detected in the kidney of MERS-CoV\u2013infected animals 2, 4 or 6 days after infection. mice were immunized with 1 105 PFU of MERS-CoV intranasally. mice showed 100% survival and no weight loss during the 14-day experiment. intraperitoneal administration of serum from mice immunized with VRP-S 1 day prior to MERS-CoV infection completely prevented the lethal disease manifestations in K18-hDPP4 mice. control anti-GFP sera\u2013treated mice all died. the titers achieved in the K18-hDPP4 lines exceeded those in the SPC-hDPP4 lines. founder line 3 from both the SPC-hDPP4 and K18-hDPP4 lines showed the highest virus titers 3 days after infection. intranasal infection of transgenic mice and their nontransgenic littermates with MERS-CoV caused no mortality or changes in body temperature. RNA was abundant in lung 2 and 4 days after infection. RNA was detected in brain tissue 4 days after infection. lower levels of viral RNA were also detected in spleen 2 days after infection. the airways were generally intact, with only scattered, uncommon sloughed cells. in some lungs, lymphatic vessels were filled with degenerative cells. Thrombi were also observed, with nearby vascular congestion and necrosis. 0.2.058 Composite score 1.1 0.1 1.3 0.1.999 2.0 0.1.117 2.2 0.1.002 See \"Methods\" section for scoring parameters. a by the Dunn multiple comparison test, compared with control on day 6. MERS-CoV\u2013infected mice exhibited perivascular cuffing (Figure 4B and 4E), cellular degeneration, and debris (Figure 4C and 4D) that were absent on day 2. degenerating and dying neurons sometimes had basophilic cytoplasmic inclusions that were quite prominent (Figure 4C and 4F) 0.0 3 1.0 0.0 3.999 1.0 0.0 3.999 2.2 0.3 6.054 Cerebellum 1 0.0 4 1 0.0 2.999 1 0.0 3.999 1.3 0.3 4.607 Cerebrum 1 0.0 4 1 0.0 2.999 1.0 0.0 3.999 1.8 0.2 8.035 Ependyma 1.0 0.0 4 1.0 0.0 3.999 1.0 0.0 3.999 1.3 0.2 7.510 Hippocampus 1.0 0.0 2 1.0 0.0 Dying cells undergoing degeneration are detected in highly infected regions such as the thalamus or brain stem. a total of 3 of 7 MERS-CoV\u2013infected mice showed high virus titers in the brains. the onset of weight loss was delayed from 3\u20134 days after infection to 9\u201310 days after infection. in a second experiment, MERS-CoV was detected in brain tissue of 3 of 7 mice infected with 10 PFU (approximately 4 106 PFU/g of tissue) no virus was titered from lung tissue. SK-N-SH cells, porcine astrocytes, and control Vero-81 cells supported virus replication. this result was confirmed by immunostaining for MERS-CoV antigen. no human autopsy samples are available to directly assess virus replication in the brain. MERS-CoV\u2013infected mice had scattered-to-patchy evidence of tubular injury, including tubular dilation, cell sloughing/debris, and cellular necrosis. these changes were principally seen late in the course of infection (6 days after infection; 9 of 9 cases) and otherwise only seen rarely/focally at 4 days after infection (3 of 3 cases) unization protects human cytokeratin 18 (K18)\u2013hDPP4 mice against MERS-CoV infection. mice immunized with 1 105 infectious units of VRPs expressing green fluorescent protein (VRP-GFP) or VRP-MERS-S in the footpad. mice were infected with 1 105 plaque-forming units of MERS-CoV 2 weeks after the boost. virus titered >4 days after infection (Figure 5E) immunization completely prevented spread of infection to the brain. inflammatory disease course ensued in K18-hDPP4 mice with a milder disease phenotype. the disease phenotype of the K18-hDPP4 mice shares many features. the disease phenotype of the K18-hDPP4 mice shares many features. a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV strain may help overcome this limitation. we previously used the K18 promoter to generate mice transgenic for human ACE2 as a model for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) following infection with the Urbani strain of SARS-CoV, K18-hACE2 mice developed a lethal disease featuring both lung and brain involvement. magnetic resonance imaging involving the white matter and subcortical areas of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, the basal ganglia, and the corpus callosum [26]. further data are needed to understand whether some patients with MERS have central nervous system involvement with infection."}
