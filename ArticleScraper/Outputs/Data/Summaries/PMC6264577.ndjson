{"summary": "the root of C. simplex has been used in oriental countries as an anti-inflammatory and anti-viral agent. it has also been used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cetate soluble extract of the roots of C. simplex by column chromatography afforded three new cycloartane-type triterpenoid saponins. results and discussion Compound 1, named shengmaxinside A, was obtained as colorless needles. the 13C-NMR spectrum exhibited anomeric carbons at C 107.5. all the above evidence suggested that 1 was a highly oxygenated 9,19-cycloartane triterpene glycoside. a sugar unit and an acetyl unit showed anomeric carbons at C 107.5. 34.2 1.66 (m),1.71 (m) 34.0 1.63 (m),1.75 (m) 34.2 13 --- 41.1 --- 41.1 --- 40.2 14 --- 50.8 --- 50.8 --- 50.8 --- 50.0 15 4.53 (d, 7.6) 78.4 4.51 (d, 7.6) 78.6 4.32 (d, 10.4) 80.8 16 --- 112.8 --- 112.5 --- 106.7 17 1.71 (m) 60.5 1.72 (m gas chromatography (GC) analysis revealed the presence of D-galacose. the presence of a galacose was further confirmed by its NMR data. ddd, J = 2.0, 4.3, 9.2 Hz), 4.53 (1H, d, J = 7.6 Hz) and 3.77 (1H, d, J = 4.4 Hz) in the region of aglycon moiety suggest three additional oxygen-bearing carbons on the aglycone. 1 had the same aglycone as 25-O-acetyl-7,8-didehydrocimigenol-3-O--D-xyloside. the planar structure of 1 corresponded to 25-O-acetylcycloartane-7-en-3-O--D-galactopyranoside. 2 was elucidated as 7,8-didehydrocimigenol-3-O--D-galactopyranoside. it was obtained as a white amorphous powder, which was considered a triterpene glycoside due to the positive results with the Liebermann-Burchard reaction. the 13C-NMR spectrum showed a total of thirty eight carbon signals due to the aglycon moiety, along with a sugar unit and an acetyl unit. all the above evidence suggested that 3 was a highly oxygenated 9,19-cycloartane triterpene glycoside. GC analysis revealed the presence of D-galacose. between H 4.84(H-1') and 88.4(C-3) suggested that the galactopyranosyl was located at the C-3 position. other key long-range correlations were found for H-1/C-3, H-19/C-19, 23-H/C-22 and C-24, H-24/C-25. UV spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1601 instrument. GC analysis was carried out on an Agilent HP 6890N gas chromatograph using an HP-5 capillary column. Fraction D (6 g) was re-chromatographed on silica gel (200-300 mesh, 150 g), eluted with CHCl3-MeOH (20:11:1) as solvent, to afford three sub-fractions. sub-fraction D2 (3.6 g) was further separated by ODS (MeOH/H2O, 6:49:1) to afford five fractions. 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR data are shown in Table 1. acid hydrolysis was performed by a previously described method [28]. the aglycone was extracted with chloroform, and each aqueous residue was adjusted to pH 7.0 with 12% NaOH and reduced with NaBH4 (40 mg) the reduced sugars were acetylated with 1:1 pyridine-Ac2O in a boiling water bath for 2 h to give the corresponding alditol acetates. the HRESIMS was determined on an HP-5 capillary column. chromatography was performed on hypersil-ODS II (10 m, 20300 mm, Yilite, Da Lian, China) Fraction D (6 g) was re-chromatographed on silica gel (200-300 mesh, 150 g), eluted with CHCl3-MeOH (20:1) as solvent, to afford three sub-fractions. sub-fraction D2 (3.6 g) was further separated by ODS (MeOH/H2O, 6:49:1) to afford five fractions. acid hydrolysis was performed by a previously described method. each compound (10 mg) was heated in an ampule with aqueous 12% HCl (5 mL) the aglycone was extracted with chloroform, and each aqueous residue was adjusted to pH 7.0 with 12% NaOH and reduced with NaBH4 (40 mg), followed by acidification with dilute CH3COOH. the reduced sugars were acetylated with 1:1 pyridine-Ac2O in a boiling water bath for 2 h to give the corresponding alditol acetates. edward et al."}
