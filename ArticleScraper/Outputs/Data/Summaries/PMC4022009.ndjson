{"summary": "wet AMD is characterized by subretinal extravasations of neovessels and hemorrhage under and into the photoreceptor cell layer which induces photoreceptor cell loss [2]. dry AMD is characterized by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy and photoreceptor degeneration [2]. phagocytosis of cellular debris and lipids by monocytes in the subretinal space is important in drusen formation and photoreceptors degeneration. in mice deficient in the CX3CR1 gene, phagocytosis of cellular debris and lipids by monocytes in the subretinal space [22, 24\u201326] is important in drusen formation and photoreceptors degeneration. antiretinal antibodies from AMD patients partly react with unknown retinal proteins of varying molecular weight [40] including a 68 kDa neurofilament protein found in photoreceptors outer segments. antiretinal antibodies recognizing glial fibrillary protein (GFAP, expressed by M\u00fcller cells and astrocytes in the retina) and -enolase were found at significantly higher level in AMD patient's blood than in normal controls. oxidation of docosahexaenoate- (DHA-) containing lipids generates carboxyethylpyrrole (CEP) protein adducts. immunocytochemistry localized CEP to the outer segments of photoreceptor rod and the RPE in mouse retina. adducted-proteins are more abundant in drusen and blood from AMD patients. antibodies against -enolase have been associated not only with AMD [42] but also with cancer associated retinopathy (CAR) and nonparaneoplastic autoimmune retinopathy (npAIR) antibodies specific for B-crystallin are found in sera of AMD patients [42] and also in sera of patients with uveitis [52]. autoantibodies against recoverin killed photoreceptors in vivo [58]. they have demonstrated that adoptive transfer of antiretinal autoantibodies from RCS rats killed photoreceptors in vivo. autoantibodies could induce choroidal vessels involution by inhibiting vessel growth or contrary enhancing choroidal neovascularization. lymphocytes may play a role in neovascularization, atrophy of the RPE, and breakdown of Bruch's membrane at early and late stages of macular degeneration. sion of leucocytes was overexpressed in the RPE/choroid complex and the retina. mild T cells infiltration and increased levels of dendritic cells in the retina has also been observed. all these reports suggest a potential role for adaptive immunity in the pathogenesis of AMD. higher levels of CD56+ and CD28 memory T cells increase 3.5 times the risk of developing AMD [72] the risk of AMD is further augmented by 13.3 times in the case of persons with enhanced blood levels of memory T cells. this study indicates a direct cooperative effect of both risk factors on AMD outcome. a particular interest has been raised on CD3+ T cells, either Th (CD4+) or Tc (CD8+) that produce IL-17, during AMD pathogenesis [80]. conventional T cells producing IL-17 should be seen integrated in a global \u201cautoimmune\u201d process involving both innate and adaptive immune components. lai Wei et al. showed that the frequency of CD14+ monocytes expressing the IL-17RC receptor was superior in the blood of siblings with AMD than in their respective sibling without AMD. the IL-17RC receptor was more expressed in the macula of patients with the dry or the wet form of AMD than in non-AMD controls macula, at the mRNA and proteins levels. IL-17 can induce destruction of photoreceptors and of the RPE layer observed during the dry form of AMD. IL-17 is therefore a good candidate to promote CNV during the wet form of AMD either directly, by enhancing the growth of endothelial cells in the presence of angiogenic factors. oxidative stress has been recognized as one of the major risk factors in the development of AMD [6\u20139]. the link between oxidative stress and autoimmune responses could happen as follows. oxidative stress is a common source of tissue and cellular injury. autoantibodies and autoimmune T cells observed during AMD could have been generated following exposure to pathogens during infections with viruses or bacteria. it has been previously reported that an autoimmune type reaction can be induced following infection. it could be proposed that infections could be at the origin of AMD. wet AMD has been associated with elevated serum IgG titers specific to Chlamydia pneumoniae [117] but this has been refuted by Miller et al. more studies are needed to determine their exact role(s) during disease evolution. the knowledge that AMD is probably due to an autoimmune response mediated at least partly by IL-17 producing T cells may provide new therapeutic targets for treatment of this disease. authors suggest antigen-specific T cells play a leading role in AMD pathogenesis. authors demonstrate CEP-specific T cells presence in the eyes of CEP immunized mice in vivo."}
