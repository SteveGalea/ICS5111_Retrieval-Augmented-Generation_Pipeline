{"summary": "HCoV-229E belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus. it is a causative agent of the human common cold. the isolate obtained at that time (VR-740) is still used as a laboratory strain by the American Type Culture Collection. HCoV-229E enters cells at the cell surface in the presence of extracellular serine proteases, such as trypsin, but in their absence, the virus utilizes cathepsin L in the late endosome (15, 16). this suggests that SARS-CoV mainly uses cell surface proteases rather than endosomal cathepsin L in vivo. HCoV-229E strains were inoculated with 229E/lab, 229E/clin-Sd, and 229E/clin-Ng strains. replication rates of both the laboratory strain and clinical isolates in native HeLa cells were almost equal. virus titer was determined in HeLa cells cultured in medium supplemented with trypsin. the data were analyzed using a two-tailed Student t test. treatment of HeLa-TMPRSS2 cells with 5 M camostat blocked 50% of 229E/lab but only 10% of 229E/clin. camostat blocked the entry of both 229E/lab and 229E/clin. this suggests that 229E/clin tends to use TMPRSS2 rather than cathepsin L. at least 200 GFP-positive cells/well were counted at 20 h postinfection. data are expressed as percentages relative to those in HeLa-TMPRSS2 cells cultured in the absence of inhibitors. asterisks indicate statistical significance of data from 229E/clins. 229E/clin entered cells faster than 229E/clin by using endosomal cathepsin L. 7% of 229E/clin entered cells at 1 h compared with 30% of 229E/clin. this suggests 229E/clin entered cells faster than 229E/clin. at least 200 GFP-positive cells/well were counted under control conditions. the number of GFP-positive cells induced by the nonglycoprotein pseudotype control was substituted from the raw data. replication of the clinical strain in HeLa-TMPRSS2 cells was the same as that of the laboratory strain. exposure of 229E/lab and 229E/clin-Sd to the cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074 inhibited entry into HeLa cells by 24%. single (M639R or K711N) or double mutations reduced viral entry by around 50%. or VSV-G were inoculated onto HeLa or HeLa-TMPRSS2 cells. at least 200 GFP-positive cells/well were counted at 24 h postinfection. the data are expressed as percentages relative to those in HeLa cells treated with DMSO. analysis revealed a single point mutation (I577S) in the S protein. entry of 229E/lab into HeLa cells was about 60% of that into HeLa-TMPRSS2 cells, whereas that of 229E/clin-Sd-p1 was about 20%. a single mutation (I577S) in the 229E/clin-Sd S protein recovered virus entry by 60%. eudotyped viruses bearing HCoV-229E S proteins or the VSV G protein were counted under control conditions at 24 h postinfection. the data are expressed as percentages relative to those in HeLa-TMPRSS2 cells. the virus passaged in HeLa cells reduces infectivity in HBTE-ALI cells. aminopeptidase N (APN) increased by 13-fold and 4-fold respectively. there was no increase in mRNA encoding E-cadherin and ZO-1. no increase in mRNAs encoding TMPRSS2 or cathepsin L. HBTE-ALI cells were inoculated with 229E/clin-Sd-p1 and 229E/clin-Sd-p20 (104 PFU), the titers of which were measured in HeLa-TMPRSS2 cells cultured in medium supplemented with trypsin. after 24 h, cellular RNA was collected, and viral RNA was measured by real-time PCR. the tertiary structure was modified by homology modeling using the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software package. the topological features and the locations of the fusion peptide and the cleavage site are similar in both models. all the identified mutations that affect cathepsin use are scattered randomly throughout the S2 subunit; none are close to the protease cleavage site. replication of HCoV-229E clinical isolates 229E/clin-Sd (Sendai-H/1121/04) and 229E/clin-Ng (Niigata/01/08) in HeLa cells at 24 h postinfection was 1 log unit less than that of a laboratory strain, 229E/lab (ATCC VR-740) (2). HeLa or HeLa-TMPRSS2 cells (105) were inoculated with 229E/lab, 229E/clin-Sd, and 229E/clin-Ng strains. after 24 h, cells were collected and ultrasonicated, and the virus titer was determined in HeLa cells cultured in medium supplemented with trypsin. ylamindo-3-methylbutane ethyl ester, a broad inhibitor of cysteine proteases, and camostat, a serine protease inhibitor that inhibits TMPRSS2. camostat had no effect on viral entry into HeLa cells, whereas E64d blocked entry of both 229E/lab and 229E/clin. d, and 229E/clin-Ng S proteins were infected with VSV-pseudotyped viruses. they were infected with 10 M E64d, 10 M camostat, or a combination of the two. at least 200 GFP-positive cells were counted under control conditions. data were expressed as a percentage relative to virus-infected HeLa-TMPRSS2 cells. entry into both the laboratory and clinical strains began immediately after the shift to 37\u00b0C. however, entry into HeLa cells was delayed by 1 h, suggesting that was the time it took for the virus to pass through the endosome. expression plasmids bearing 229E/lab or 229E/clin-Sd S proteins harboring these mutations were constructed. cell entry by pseudotyped VSV harboring the mutant S proteins was examined in HeLa cells. at least 200 GFP-positive cells/well were counted under control conditions. exposure of 229E/lab to 10 M cathepsin L inhibitor III inhibited virus entry into HeLa cells by 90%. single mutations (R642M or N714K) in the 229E/lab S protein recovered entry by 30%, whereas a double mutant recovered entry by 80%. five amino acid substitutions are present around the fusion peptide sequence in the S protein of 229E/lab and 229E/clin-Sd. the data are expressed as percentages relative to those in HeLa-TMPRSS2 cells treated with DMSO. the proliferation of 229E/clin-Sd-p1 in HeLa cells was 1 log unit less than that of 229E/lab. after 20 passages, 229E/clin-Sd-p20 acquired a high capacity to replicate in HeLa cells. analysis revealed a single point mutation (I577S) in the S protein. titers were determined in HeLa cells cultured in medium supplemented with trypsin. there was one amino acid mutation in the S protein of 229E/clin-Sd at passage 20 (I577S) mRNA encoding MUC5AC (a mucin secreted onto the airway surface) increased by 13-fold and 4-fold, respectively. there was no increase in mRNA encoding E-cadherin and ZO-1. HBTE cells were cultured for 4 weeks in differentiation medium. HBTE-ALI cells were inoculated with 229E/clin-Sd-p1 and 229E/clin-Sd-p20 (104 PFU), the titers of which were measured in HeLa-TMPRSS2 cells cultured in medium supplemented with trypsin. after 24 h, cellular RNA was collected, and viral RNA was measured by real-time PCR. reliance on cathepsin leads to reduced viral replication in airway epithelial cells. these results suggest that reliance on cathepsin leads to reduced viral replication in airway epithelial cells. cytopathic effects of HCoV-229E were observed 11 days after inoculation onto cultured cells in the absence of trypsin (1). the virus presumably acquired the ability to utilize cathepsin during the first isolation step or after passage over half a century. the virus must be exposed to the endosomal environment for 1 h during the entry process. endosome by entering via the cell surface using TMPRSS2. the immune cells then trap the virus in the endosome, leading to an inflammatory reaction. viruses that enter cells through the endosome find it difficult to survive in vivo. s in the S2 subunit induce a different conformational state at the cleavage site, thereby impeding access by cathepsin L. further experiments are needed to clarify the mechanism(s) underlying proteolytic activation of the S protein by cathepsin L. HBTE cells were plated on 6.5-mm-diameter Transwell permeable supports. human airway epithelium cultures were generated by growing the cells at an ALI for 4 weeks. all the viruses were propagated in HeLa cells and titrated on HeLa cells. VSV-pseudotyped virus harboring the mutant 229E S protein was prepared using the same method. nucleotide mutations were inserted into a 229E S-expressing plasmid. the titer of VSV-pseudotyped viruses was determined in HeLa cells. cells were inoculated with VSV-pseudotyped viruses on ice for 1 h. cells were treated with E64d or camostat (final concentration, 10 M) to stop viral entry. after 24 h, the cells were counted, and the data were expressed as a percentage relative to those in HeLa-TMPRSS2 cells. real-time PCR Target mRNA Method of detection Primers and probes Name Sequence 229E/lab-S TaqMan 229E-Lab-S-F CGTTGACTTCAAACCTCAGA 229E-Lab-S-R ACCAACATTGGCATAAACAG 229E-Lab-S-F CTATAACTGTCTGCTGT 229E-cS-S-R TACTAGCACTCCTATCAAAC 229E-N-R T HBTE cells were cultured in differentiation medium (Lifeline Cell Technology) for 0 or 4 weeks at an ALI. cellular RNA was isolated by addition of Isogen reagent (Nippon Gene). a real-time PCR assay was performed to quantify mRNA encoding HCoV-HKU1 replicase, 229. to construct the S protein model, the cryoelectron microscopic structure of the MHV S protein (23) was modified by homology modeling (36) using the MOE software package. a two-tailed Student t test was used to analyze statistical significance. the clinical isolate Sendai-H/1121/04 (AB691764; designated 229E/clin-Ng) was isolated from a pharyngeal swab taken from a Japanese patient in 2004. all the viruses were propagated in HeLa cells and titrated on HeLa cells in the presence of supplemental trypsin. cells were grown in 96-well plates (approximately 105 cells/well) and treated with protease inhibitors in 5% FCS-DMEM for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. the cells were inoculated with approximately 102 to 103 FFU of VSV-pseudotyped virus harboring the HCoV-229E S protein. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 20 h. newly prepared HeLa or HeLa-TMPRSS2 cells were inoculated with 103 PFU of virus. after 20 h, the supernatants were collected and the amount of virus was titrated in a plaque assay.
