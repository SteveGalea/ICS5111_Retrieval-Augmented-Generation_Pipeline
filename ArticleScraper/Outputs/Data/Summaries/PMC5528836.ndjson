{"summary": "TMUV is a mosquito-borne flavivirus which belongs to the flaviviridae family. TMUV genome encodes a single polyprotein which is cleaved into three structural proteins (C, prM and E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) NS1 protein contains multiple protective protective T-cell and B-cell epitopes which can induce both humoral and cell-mediated immunity without the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement. NS1 protein of flavivirus has more virus-specific epitopes than cross-reactive ones in contrast to E protein which has more cross-reactive than specific epitopes. DMEM/High glucose (Hyclone, Thermo scientific, USA) in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. all culture media were added with 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum (TransGen, Beijing, China), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Solarbio, Beijing, China) the SDSG strain was isolated from a duck farm in Shandong province in 2013. 6-week-old mice were immunized with TMUV NS1 protein and Freund\u2019s adjuvant. three days after final immunization, mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide. fusion cells were fused with sp2/0 murine myeloma cells. the characteristics of monoclonal antibodies were identified using Pierce Rapid Isotyping Kit (Thermo, Rockford, IL, USA) the cell supernatants and ascitic fluids were respectively diluted from 1:10 to 1:20480. the titers of diluted antibodies were measured by indirect ELISA. 1-21 201WIESKNNGSWKLERAV216 NS1-4 31NYKYYPSTPRRLAKIM46 NS1-22 211KLERAVLGEVKSCTWP226 NS1-5 41RLAKIMVEAHEAGICG56 NS1-23 221KSCTWPETHTLWSDSV236 NS1-6 51EAGICGIRSVSRLEHN66 NS1-24 231LWSDSVVESELIIPKT246 NS1 ten pairs of primers were designed according to the shortened peptide sequences. the primers were annealed and gene sequences of truncated peptides were amplified. the concentrations of purified proteins were measured by a BSA Protein Assay Kit. each well of 96-well plates was coated with purified fusion proteins. the plates were blocked with 5% skimmed milk for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. cells supernatants of different hybridomas were added to each well. fusion proteins were subjected to gel electrophoresis on 12% SDS-PAGE. the membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk overnight at 4\u00b0C. after washing three times with TBST, the membranes were immersed in a goat anti-duck or anti-mouse HRP-conjugated serum. blocking ELISA Each well of 96 well plates was coated with purified NS1 protein in 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. after washing three times with PBST, mouse positive serum against TMUV NS1 protein was added to wells and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1h. cellulose membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk at 37\u00b0C for 2h. after washing three times with TBST, membranes were colored in DAB liquid. running water was used to stop the reaction. inant plasmid pET-28 -NS1 and control plasmid pET-28a(+) were transformed into BL21 cells and induced by isopropyl-thiogalac-topyranoside. after induction, bacterial cells were centrifugated and washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) loma cells using 50% polyethylene glycol (PEG 4000, Sigma) were cultured selectively in DMEM/high glucose containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 mM hypoxanthine, 16 mM thymidine and 400 mM aminopterin. on day five, 50L of HAT medium was added additionally in each cell of the 96 cell plates. the fusion proteins were identified by SDS-PAGE and purified by Pierce GST Protein Interaction Pull-Down Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the concentrations of purified proteins were measured by a BSA Protein Assay Kit (Kang Wei, China) ten pairs of primers were designed according to the shortened peptide sequences. one or two amino acid residues were removed from the carboxy terminal of the peptide. each well of 96-well plates was coated with purified fusion proteins. after washing, cell supernatants of different hybridomas were added to each well. after washing, a goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated polyclonal serum diluted 1:5000 with 5% skimmed milk was added. 2M H2SO4 was used to stop the reaction and the absorbance was recorded at 450 nm by a microplate absorbance reader. 96-well plates were coated with recombinant protein NS1 and BL21 (DE3) cells containing plasmid pET-28a(+ respectively. cells were separated into a 24 well plate and inoculated with TMUV (103.5 ELD50/0.2mL duck embryo allantoic fluid) cells were fixed with methanol and acetone (1:1) for 20 min at -20\u00b0C. after washing three times with PBS, cells were inoculated with goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) with FITC conjugate.
