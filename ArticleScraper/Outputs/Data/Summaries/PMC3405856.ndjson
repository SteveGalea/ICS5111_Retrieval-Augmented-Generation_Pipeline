{"summary": "the cDCs are highly effective at Ag presentation and T-cell stimulation, even in the absence of intentional activation. the cDCs are specially equipped for the secretion of type I interferon (interferon /, IFN-I) and other cytokines. both DC classes share essential DC functions such as highly efficient pathogen recognition. pDCs lack several essential DC features such as dendritic morphology and high MHC class II expression. this has been recently attributed to the role of a specific transcription factor, E2-2, in pDC development. the loss of E2-2 from mature pDCs causes their full phenotypic and functional conversion into cDC-like cells. both DC classes share essential DC functions such as highly efficient pathogen recognition, lack of obvious effector function, and the capacity to mobilize and activate multiple innate and adaptive immune cell types. progenitor cell populations giving rise to all DC subsets have been identified in the bone marrow. cDCs have been traditionally categorized into two distinct subsets, the CD8+ (CD103+ in tissues) DCs and CD11b+ \u201cmyeloid\u201d DCs. the precise function of CD11b+ DCs remains less well understood, although they are generally believed to prime CD4+ T-cell responses. splenic CD11b+ DCs comprise of two distinct cell types whose origin and function differ significantly. some CD11b+ DCs develop through a Notch2- and lymphotoxin- receptor-dependent pathway. the Notch2-independent CD11b+ DCs appear more related to monocytes in their origin and expression profile. s that are functionally similar to CD8+ DCs in lymphoid organs. the notch2-dependent CD11b+CD103+ DCs migrate to mesenteric lymph nodes. these latter DCs appear to reside continuously in the LP and secrete the inflammatory cytokines that recruit and activate local immune cells. a major insight into DC biology has been provided by the identification of human patients with DC deficiency. patients with mutations in IRF8 lack pDCs, cDCs, and monocytes in circulation. relatively little is known about the heterogeneity and functionality of human DC subsets, particularly in tissues. the same physical cell of a given DC subset detects pathogens through pattern recognition receptors, secretes cytokines, migrates into the T-cell area of lymphoid organs, presents Ag, and directs T-cell priming. however, the newly described heterogeneity of DCs in lymphoid organs and tissues suggests a more nuanced view of DC function. agonistic self-peptides may tolerize self-reactive T cells when presented by steady-state DCs, whereas foreign peptides presented by activated DCs induce T-cell priming. the loss of DCs would lead to an unresponsive state in both normal and self-reactive T cells, and prevent self-ag-specific T-cell responses. in vitro observations on the supreme T-cell priming capacity of DCs have been strongly supported by genetic models in vivo. cDCs abolish the priming of allogeneic or Ag-specific T cells in the spleen. some DC subsets have been shown to be essential in the response to specific pathogens. pDCs are important for IFN-I-mediated innate control of acute cytopathic coronaviruses. the pDCs were found to be essential for the priming of virus-specific CD4+ T cells. the pDCs were found to be essential for the priming of virus-specific CD4+ T cells, even though MHC class II expression on pDCs was dispensable. cytokine-induced or genetic expansion of DCs increases pathogen burden in infections with intracellular bacteria such as Listeria. cytokine-induced or genetic expansion of DCs increases pathogen burden in infections with intracellular bacteria such as Listeria, underscoring the role of DCs as \u201csentinels without armament\u201d the migration-based tolerance induction is even more questionable for pDCs. the role of endogenous thymic DCs in central tolerance is plausible but may be relatively subtle or restricted to only certain self-Ag. the identity of targeted DC population have to be precisely defined, and may be critical for the outcome of Ag targeting. the identity of the targeted receptor and its potential signaling function may fundamentally influence the outcome of Ag targeting. a compelling genetic way to test Ag presentation by steady-state DCs involved the Cre recombinase-induced expression of model Ag in DCs in vivo. a study has claimed that constitutive ablation of cDCs causes autoimmune manifestations. it appears likely that the purported \u201cautoimmune\u201d disease was in fact a myeloproliferative syndrome caused by increased serum concentration of Flt3L in the absence of DCs. the nature of self-Ag presented by DCs in the periphery is important. by analogy to T-cell selection in the thymus, strongly agonistic self-Ag would induce tolerization. weakly agonistic self-peptides would provide a positive tonic signal. phenotype is presented by Blimp-1 (Prdm1), a transcriptional repressor required for B- and T-cell differentiation. this phenotype recapitulates the striking prevalence of lupus in females. this suggests that DCs may be ultimately responsible for this mysterious feature of the disease. the absence of DCs leads to only a modest reduction in Treg numbers. the contribution of DCs to Treg maintenance is mediated through the costimulatory molecules CD80/CD86 expressed on DCs. however, the reduction of Tregs does not cause spontaneous autoimmunity or lymphocyte hyperactivation. the increase in DC numbers as a necessary and sufficient cause of Treg expansion remains to be formally proven. the pDCs have been implicated into Treg induction in several specialized models such as organ transplantation. cDCs essentially abolishes the priming of allogeneic or Ag-specific T cells in the spleen. the cross-presenting Batf3-dependent DCs are required for the T-cell-mediated control of Toxoplasma infection. pDCs were found to be essential for the priming of virus-specific CD4+ T cells. pDCs were found to be essential for the priming of virus-specific CD4+ T cells. cytokines such as IL-12 and possibly IFN-I in T-cell-mediated immunity remained moot. DCs in tolerance: central In contrast to their emerging key role in antimicrobial immunity, the role of DCs in the steady-state immune tolerance is still poorly understood. a variant of this scenario suggests that mTECs recruit thymic DCs in an Aire-dependent manner and thus facilitate the generation of Tregs. endogenous peripheral DCs migrate into the thymus, and may induce clonal deletion and/or Tregs for certain model Ag. however, it is unclear whether this mechanism is relevant or operative at all except for special artificial conditions. dec205 (Ly75) receptor used to target CD8+ cDCs is expressed on a variety of non-DC cell types including macrophages and granulocytes. another receptor, Dcir2/33D1, is highly DC specific but marks a functionally distinct subset of CD11b+ cDCs. the identity of the targeted receptor and its potential signaling function may fundamentally influence the outcome of Ag targeting. constitutive ablation of DCs using a similar system causes autoimmune manifestations. however, this study neither documented the full course of the disease. it appears likely that the purported \u201cautoimmune\u201d disease was in fact a myeloproliferative syndrome. in the absence of DCs, these T cells would be relieved of the negative signal. agonistic self-Ag would induce tolerization, whereas weakly agonistic self-peptides would provide a positive tonic signal. however, it has been suggested that DC accumulation owing to defective apoptosis causes autoimmunity. phenotype is presented by Blimp-1 (Prdm1), a transcriptional repressor required for B- and T-cell differentiation. this phenotype recapitulates the striking prevalence of lupus in females. the absence of DCs leads to only a modest reduction in Treg numbers. the contribution of DCs to Treg maintenance is mediated through the costimulatory molecules CD80/CD86 expressed on DCs. however, the reduction of Tregs does not cause spontaneous autoimmunity or lymphocyte hyperactivation. the increase in DC numbers as a necessary and sufficient cause of Treg expansion remains to be formally proven. the pDCs have been implicated into Treg induction in several specialized models. the first important evidence for the induction of self-tolerance by DCs came from the studies based on Ag targeting in vivo by DC-specific antibodies. this approach is elegant and has potential therapeutic implications, but some caveats should be kept in mind. the specificity of Ag targeting and the identity of targeted DC population have to be precisely defined. elucidated the mechanism of DC-induced T-cell unresponsiveness. antibody-mediated and genetic Ag targeting suggest that DCs can induce peripheral T-cell tolerance to immunodominant epitopes. elucidated the mechanism of DC-induced unresponsiveness. apoptosis blockade has not been established in either model. the mechanism of the proposed loss of tolerance in the steady state remains moot. the changes of DC functionality may breach T-cell tolerance and induce inflammation. this was first shown by DC-specific deletion of V8 integrin. loss of Stat3 or -catenin makes DCs refractory to IL-10 or Wnt signaling. phenotype recapitulates striking prevalence of lup. us in females suggests that DCs may be ultimately responsible for this mysterious feature of the disease. these results reveal elaborate molecular mechanisms that are essential to prevent aberrant DC activation and the ensuing breach of immunological tolerance. Flt3L-expanded DCs may not be functionally equivalent to the steady-state DCs, e.g., owing to Flt3L-induced mTOR signaling (Sathaliyawala et al. 2010). the increase in DC numbers as a necessary and sufficient cause of Treg expansion remains to be formally proven. pDC-deficient animals have normal Treg compartments and no apparent T-cell activation or autoimmunity. current evidence suggests that DCs contribute to the induction and/or maintenance of peripheral Tregs. however, it appears unlikely that DCs are absolutely required for Treg homeostasis. some clinical settings may provide fertile grounds for tolerogenic DC applications. anticancer vaccines present the most promising venue. unleashing the capacity of DCs to present Ag and prime effector T cells may bring closer the ultimate success of cancer immunotherapy."}
