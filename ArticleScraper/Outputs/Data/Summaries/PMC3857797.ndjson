{"summary": "current therapy targets viral proteins, neuraminidase and M2, but is hampered by development of resistance. the cleavage of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) by host cell proteases is essential for viral infectivity. deletion of Tmprss2 in knock-out mice strongly limits virus spread and lung pathology after H1N1 influenza A virus infection. non-infected Tmprss2 knock-out mice did not show a phenotype in the absence of infection. wild type mice showed a significant drop in peripheral blood oxygen saturation. Tmprss2/ mutant mice showed only a very mild change. infected wild type mice showed a strong increase in lung infiltrates and also in the number of infected cells. infected wild type mice showed a strong increase in lung pathology and reduced viral spread. Virus-infected cells at day 1 p.i. were observed mainly in bronchiolar regions in both mice (A, B, E, F) however, the overall number of infected cells was lower in Tmprss2/ compared to wild type mice. infected cells were mostly limited to bronchiolar regions in Tmprss2/. broncho-alveolar lavages were collected and the proteolytic processing of the HA precursor protein HA0 was analyzed. hemagglutinin of H1N1 PR8M influenza virus is not processed in infected mice. 105 FFU PR8M and viral particles were concentrated by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion. each sample was loaded undiluted (first lane), and in two dilutions (second lane 11.33, third lane 12) the stripped membranes were incubated with anti-influenza A virus antibody confirming that equal amounts of proteins were loaded for respective samples. eight to eleven weeks old female mice were infected with 101 FFU mouse-adapted H3N2 influenza virus by intra-nasal application and bodyweight (A) and survival (B) was monitored until day 14 p.i. mice with a weight loss of more than 30% of the starting body weight were euthanized and recorded as dead. TMPRSS2 is dispensable for cleavage activation of viruses with a multi-basic cleavage site. if resistance of mice to H1N1 infection was due to lack of HA processing, a virus with a multi-basic cleavage site should spread efficiently and cause disease. murine Tmprss2 is essential for spread and pathogenesis of H1N1 influenza viruses in mice. non-infected mice did not show a phenotype in the absence of infection. all wild-type mice died within seven days post infection. no knock-out mice showed symptoms of disease. Tmprss2/ mutant mice showed only a mild change. 2105 FFU PR8M virus and oxygen saturation in the peripheral blood was measured until day 14 p.i. wild type mice showed a similar onset of the influenza infection on day 1 post infection in Tmprss2/ and wild type mice with infected epithelial cells in the bronchiole. the airways of Tmprss2+/+ mice were surrounded by higher numbers neutrophils and macrophages (I\u2013L) whereas airways of Tmprss2/ mice showed lower numbers of immune cell infiltrations (M\u2013P). Virus-infected cells at day 1 p.i. were observed mostly in bronchiolar regions in both mice (A, B, E, F) eight to eleven weeks old female mice were infected with 2105 FFU of the PR8M virus. hemagglutinin of H1N1 PR8M virus is not processed in Tmprss2 knock-out mice. BAL from infected wild type and Tmprss2/ male mice was harvested at day 1. each sample was loaded undiluted (first lane), and in two dilutions (second lane 11.33, third lane 12) the virus-containing pellets were then analyzed for HA cleavage by Western blots. eight to eleven weeks old female mice were infected with TMPRSS2. mice with a weight loss of more than 30% of the starting body weight were euthanized. mice with a weight loss of more than 30% of the starting body weight were euthanized and recorded as dead. fected wild type mice compared to homozygous mutant mice at days 1 to 3 p.i. TMPRSS2 is dispensable for cleavage activation of viruses with a multi-basic cleavage site. if resistance of Tmprss2 knock-out mice to H1N1 infection was indeed due to lack of HA processing, a virus with a multi-basic cleavage site should spread efficiently and cause disease. murine Tmprss2 activates HA proteins of viruses with a mono-basic HA cleavage site in infected host organism. the co-expression of protease and HA proteins of PR8M, HA4 and H3N2 viruses in transfected cells facilitated HA cleavage of all viruses. viral titers in infected mice were markedly reduced compared to wild type animals. however, no weight loss was observed in mutant mice in a dose-dependent manner. pathology is strongly reduced in Tmprss2/ mice after infection with H1N1 virus and diminished after infection with H3N2 virus. but unwanted side effects are a major concern. TMPRSS2 inhibitors may exert activity against diverse respiratory infections. the protocol used in these experiments has been reviewed by an ethics committee and approved by the \u2018Nieders\u00e4chsisches Landesamt f\u00fcr Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit, Oldenburg, Germany\u2019. the different virulence of PR8M and PR8F virus isolates has been described before [15] heterozygous mutant mice were interbred and wild type, heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice were genotyped by PCR analysis and then used for infections. expression plasmids encoding human and mouse proteases TMPRSS2 were published earlier [10], [13]. female mice at the age of 8\u201311 weeks were anesthetized by intra-peritoneal injection of virus solution in sterile NaCl. survival and body weight loss were monitored until day 14 p.i. mice with a weight loss of more than 30% of the starting body weight were euthanized. pelleted viral particles were lysed in 2SDS loading buffer. lysates were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis, blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane. membranes were stripped for 30 min at 50\u00b0C, washed 1 h with dH2O. sections (0.5 m) were cut from five evenly distributed levels of the paraffin blocks and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. sections were stained with a polyclonal primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. tissue sections were incubated for 30 min with secondary antibody. Virus, mice and plasmids Original stocks of viruses were obtained from Stefan Ludwig, university of M\u00fcnster (PR8M, A/PuertoRico/8/34 H1N1, M\u00fcnster variant), from Peter St\u00e4heli, university of Freiburg (PR8F, A/PuertoRico/8/34 H1N1, Freiburg variant and SC35M [35]. virulence of PR8M and PR8F virus isolates has been described before [15] expression plasmids encoding human and mouse proteases TMPRSS2 were published earlier [10], [13]. previously described expression plasmids for PR8M [38] were used as templates for amplification of the respective coding regions using oligonucleotides. infection was performed by intranasal application of virus solution in 20 l of sterile phosphate-buffered saline. survival and body weight loss were monitored until day 14 p.i. mice with a weight loss of more than 30% of the starting body weight were euthanized and recorded as dead. 1M Tris-HCl (pH 6,8), 10% SDS, 100 mM \u00df-Mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 50\u00b0C, washed 1 h with dH2O and stained for NA by using an anti-influenza A virus goat serum (Millipore) at a dilution of 1500 followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-goat antibody. at 24 h post transfection, cells were transfected with either of the influenza viruses PR8M, HA4 or SC35M at a multiplicity of infection (MOI of 1. at 48 h p.i., supernatants were harvested, cleared from debris by centrifugation for 5 min at 3.500 rpm. peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (KPL, Gaithersburg, Madison, USA) was used as a secondary antibody. sera from non-infected mice were analyzed 14 days after infection for influenza-specific IgG antibodies."}
