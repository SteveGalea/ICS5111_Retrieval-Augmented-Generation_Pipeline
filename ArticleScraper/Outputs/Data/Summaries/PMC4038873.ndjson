{"summary": "reports followed of a similar virus isolated from a man with acute pneumonia. the virus was designated Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (5). it has been reported that MERS-CoV is capable of replicating in a wide variety of mammalian cell types (7). however, it was unclear whether serial growth impacts the viral genome. all samples shared two single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) compared to the reference strain Jordan-N3/2012. this variant is present in 55.8% of reads in the MRC5 passage and 73.4% in the CCL81 passage."}
