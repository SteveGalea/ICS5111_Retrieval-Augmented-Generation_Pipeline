{"summary": "the characterization of these important populations may enable development of new therapeutics to treat acute or chronic lung disease. the characterization of these important populations may enable development of new therapeutics to treat acute or chronic lung disease. the mouse system allowing the study of cell regeneration has supplied a model to explore and describe epithelial lineages implicated in lung repair. in small mammals, the proximal airways are composed of a layer comprising one or two cells thick that rest on a very sparse network of basal cells. undifferentiated cells in the bronchioloalveolar duct junction have been identified as different from the alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECII), the club cells (Clara) or the ciliated cells [17]. in mice, these bronchioloalveolar progenitors share phenotypic characteristics of both club cells and AECIIs, suggesting a niche of progenitors. bronchioloalveolar progenitors obtained ex vivo or maintained in vitro were further shown to express genes involved in stem cells or lung development such as NANOG (Nanog homeobox), OCT4 (Octamer-binding transcription factor 4) and BMI1 (polycomb ring finger oncogene) expression of genes was modulated upon exposure to culture conditions favoring cell differentiation. expression of SP-C (green), CCSP (red) and the co-expression of SP-C and CCSP. the nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) the number of club cells in the lung of large mammals is lower compared to rodents. in vitro expansion and phenotypic characterization of primary airway epithelial cells. small and large cubical epithelial cells proliferated after 3 days of culture. cells from dissociated lung tissues were cultured in vitro on fibronectin-coated plates. cells from ex vivo dissociated lungs were positively selected using anti-CD34 antibody-coated magnetic beads. cells from ex vivo dissociated lungs were positively selected using anti-CD34 cell sorting. expression of CCSP and SP-C among the CD34pos-selected population. hematopoietic stem cells or endothelial progenitors may contribute to the SP-Cneg and CCSPneg cells among the CD34pos population. CCSPpos cells were very low to undetectable in the CD34-sorted cell suspension (1.0% 1.7 and 1.1% 1.8, respectively), confirming that the procedure efficiently purified CD34pos cells and not AECIIs or club cells. results suggest that a bronchioloalveolar progenitor population exists in lambs. ovine bronchioloalveolar progenitors were seeded onto inserts coated with fibronectin and type I and IV collagens. the majority of these cells (>90%) maintained the co-expression of SP-C and CCSP for up to 3 passages. co-expression was performed on in vitro maintained bronchioloalveolar progenitors (SP-Cpos/CCSPpos) or differentiated AECIIs (SP-Cpos/CCSPneg) or club cells (SP-Cneg/CCSPpos). the results are presented as dot plots of the expression of both markers. cultures from 6 independent animals showed the same modulation with an increasing proportion of SP-Cpos/CCSPneg AECIIs. the population of SP-Cpos/CCSPpos progenitors rapidly decreased throughout the passages from over 90% to less than 30%. 1.8%) of the CD34neg/CCSPpos club cells were present after CD34 positive selection from the 6 tested lambs. expression of NANOG, OCT4 and BMI1 is a strong indicator of a stem cell/ progenitor phenotype. expression of NANOG and OCT4 is a strong indicator of a stem cell/ progenitor phenotype. cells cultured in AECII conditions are compatible with the lower proportion of SP-Cpos/CCSPneg AECIIs compared to the 2 others lambs at passage 1. the expression of NANOG appeared to be less stable in the bronchioloalveolar progenitors maintained in vitro compared to those obtained ex vivo. AECIIs were easily detectable in most of the sections due to their high expression of SP-C (Figure 1B) and club cells expressing CCSP were detectable when bronchioli were present on the lung section. rare SP-Cpos/CCSPpos cells were observed in some lung sections. the data are expressed as the mean ( SD) percentage of the cells expressing the cellular markers. suspensions of lung cells repeatedly contained 40% ( 18.5) SP-Cpos cells and 0.65% ( 0.60) CCSPpos cells. large cubical epithelial cells and spindle-shaped cells were rapidly observed after 3 days of culture. a majority of the observed cubical cells were SP-Cpos AECIIs, while few were CCSPpos club cells. a minor population of SP-Cpos/CCSPpos cells was reproducibly identified in culture. cells from ex vivo dissociated lungs were positively selected using anti-CD34 antibody-coated magnetic beads without prior cell culture step. cell surface expression of CD34, a surface protein expressed by some progenitors or stem cells, was then measured by flow cytometry to assess the enrichment of the bronchioloalveolar progenitors in the selected population. pos cells co-expressed CCSP and SP-C with respectively 88% ( 6.8) and 84% (5.5) positive cells. hematopoietic stem cells or endothelial progenitors may contribute to the SP-Cneg and CCSPneg cells among the CD34pos population. expression of SP-C, CCSP, CD34, BMI1, OCT4, NANOG and GAPDH mRNAs in the unselected and in the CD34-selected cells measured by RT-PCR. expression of genes known to be preferentially but not exclusively expressed in stem cells, such as the self-renewal factor gene BMI1 and the pluripotent state-specific transcription factor genes OCT4 and NANOG. the majority of these cells (>90%) maintained the co-expression of SP-C and CCSP for up to 3 passages (corresponding to approximately 45 days in culture) the majority of these cells (>90%) maintained the co-expression of SP-C and CCSP for up to 3 passages. the results are presented as the mean SD of the cells expressing each phenotype. from bronchioloalveolar progenitors to differentiated epithelial pulmonary cells. none to less than 1% of the CD34neg/SP-Cpos AECII were present after CD34 positive selection from the 6 tested lambs. findings strongly argue for in vitro differentiation of bronchioloalveolar progenitors into AECIIs. RT-PCR was used to analyze the expression of OCT4, NANOG and BMI1 in the progenitors maintained in vitro and differentiated. the expression of NANOG and BMI1 was expressed at various levels and predominantly in the medium that favored the differentiation of bronchioloalveolar progenitors into AECIIs. a small population of cells (few thousand) was isolated and characterized as SP-Cpos/CCSPpos cells. they expressed mRNAs for the NANOG, OCT4 and BMI1 genes. they retained the expression of SP-C, SP-C and CCSP. the CD34pos/SP-Cpos/CCSPpos cell population retained the potential to differentiate at least into AECIIs or club cells in specific culture conditions. the cells, maintained in vitro, expressed OCT4 and BMI1 mRNAs, conferring them characteristics inherent to multipotent cells or progenitors. CCSPpos cells were not (preterm lung) or poorly (9 days old lung) detectable in prenatal and early postnatal lung compared to mature lung (91 days) in bronchi, terminal bronchioles and respiratory bronchiole [29]. these elements point the influence of the age of the lung studied, in the search for postnatal bronchioloalveolar CCSPpos/SP-Cpos progenitors. ex vivo-derived ovine bronchioloalveolar progenitors retained expression of the BMI1, OCT4 and NANOG genes. ovine bronchioloalveolar progenitors expressed BMI1 under maintenance/self-renewing conditions, and this expression was not modified by exposure to differentiation conditions. induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) generated from sheep fibroblasts have recently been demonstrated to exhibit an embryonic stem cell-like morphology. level of OCT4 is critical for the state of a cell and its inactivation results in the loss of pluripotency and induce differentiation. ovine bronchioloalveolar progenitors can be purified and enriched from the lung of a large animal. they express progenitor markers, such as the NANOG, BMI1 and OCT4 genes, in vivo and in vitro. these cells have potential to maintain and differentiate in highly specialized epithelial cells. ase XIV and 0.025% collagenase Ia for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. pellets collected in red blood cell lysis buffer for 2 minutes. washed and re-suspended in 1X PBS supplemented with 4% of fetal calf serum. column was rinsed three times with 500 l of 1X PBS, 2 mM EDTA and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. cell pellets were re-suspended at 107 cells per 500 l of the same buffer. the cells were retained onto the magnetized matrix of the column. the PCR reactions were performed using 10 ng of cDNA with the KAPA SYBR FAST kit. 1.6 105 cells were seeded per well in 6-well plates coated with fibronectin. 5 103 CD34pos cells per well were seeded per insert. 5 103 CD34pos cells per well were seeded in 24 well plates coated with only 10 mg/ml of fibronectin. sorted cells were characterized for expression of SP-C and CCSP by flow cytometry. cells were stained with goat anti-rabbit IgGs conjugated to Alexa 488. cells were permeabilized with 0.2% triton X100, washed with 1X PBS and incubated 1 h. cells were then stained with goat anti-rabbit IgGs conjugated to Alexa 488 or anti-mouse IgGs conjugated to R-phycoerythrin. animals were collected from 10 young lambs either from 3 month old animals at the corbas slaughterhouse. the cell pellets were collected in a red blood cell lysis buffer for 2 minutes. they were washed and re-suspended in 1X PBS supplemented with 4% of fetal calf serum. cell number, concentration and viability were tested by trypan blue dye exclusion test. the cell pellets were re-suspended at 107 cells per 500 l of the same buffer. the cells were retained onto the magnetized matrix of the column. the non-labeled cells passed through and were collected as the \u201cnon-retained\u201d fraction. the PCR reactions were performed using 10 ng of cDNA with the KAPA SYBR FAST kit. 1.6 105 cells were seeded per well in 6-well plates coated with fibronectin. 5 103 CD34pos cells per well were seeded per insert. 5 103 CD34pos cells per well were seeded in 24 well plates coated with only 10 mg/ml of fibronectin. sorted cells were characterized for expression of SP-C and CCSP by flow cytometry. cells were stained with goat anti-rabbit IgGs conjugated to Alexa 488.
