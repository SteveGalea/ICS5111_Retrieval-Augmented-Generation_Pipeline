{"summary": "Bordetella bronchiseptica is a small, coccoid-shaped Gram-negative motile bacterium with a size of about 0.2 to 0.5 m by 0.5 to 2 m. the classical Bordetella species harbor many of the same virulence factors, which are similarly regulated. KM22 has been successfully used by our laboratory to develop a reproducible swine respiratory disease model reflective of clinical B. bronchiseptica infections within swine herds and host-to-host transmission. the draft genome sequence of KM22 was previously reported (26). the need to obtain a complete and closed genome sequence for further these studies became clear. whole-genome assemblies were generated using PacBio SMRT Analysis v. 2.3.0 and Canu v. 1.5 (28) software. average PacBio coverage for assembled genome was 475. genome was polished and error corrected using NCBI\u2019s Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (30) whole-genome sequence for Bordetella bronchiseptica isolate KM22 was deposited in DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under accession number CP022962. the PacBio read data were deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive."}
