YPYDVPDYA or FLAG-coding sequence (DYKDDDDK) was introduced in-frame after codon 38, 131, 140, or 258 in the NS4B-coding region by using overlap PCR. selectable replicons were generated by replacing the first cistron encoding firefly luciferase with the gene encoding neomycin phosphotransferase. membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies (NS3 2E3, 1:2,000; NS4B, 1:1,000; NS5A 9E10, 1:10,000; -actin, 1:5,000; CANX, 1:2,000; -actin, 1:5,000; -actin, 1:5,000; -actin, 1:5,000; -actin, 1:5,000; -actin, 1:5,000; CANX, 1: an in vitro replicase activity assay was carried out in a reaction mixture containing 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8], 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM KCl, 40 g/ml actinomycin D, 16 mM creatine phosphate, 40 ng/l creatine kinase (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), 1 U RNas reaction products were isolated using a NucleoSpin RNAII kit. reaction products were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation. transcripts from given pFK plasmids were generated and transfected into human hepatoma cells as described previously. cells were lysed by 50 strokes with a dounce homogenizer. nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 800 g. HCV JFH1-specific reverse transcription-PCRs were conducted in triplicate using oneStep RT-PCR kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), primers S-146 (5\u2032-TCTGCGGAACCGGTGAGT-3\u2032) and the probe 5\u2032-6-carboxyfluorescein (6FAM)-AAAGGACCCAGTCTTCCCGGCAATT-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (3\u2032) grids were incubated with blocking solution (0.8% BSA [Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany], 0.1% fish skin gelatin [Sigma-Aldrich], 50 mM glycine in PBS) for immunolabeling, primary antibodies were diluted (NS3 2E3, 1:120; NS5A 9E10, 1:5,000; dsRNA J2, 1:4; BrdU, 1:50; VAP-A and VAP-B, 1:20 membranes were labeled for NS5A using 15-nm colloidal gold particles. grids were negatively stained using a mixture of 3% aqueous uranylacetate and methyl-cellulose (60:40, vol/vol) for 8 min on ice and examined by using a. built-in megaView camera. a region spanning NS3 to NS5A was amplified with oligo(f_Ns3_NsiI) and oligo(r_NS5A_RsrII) using the Expand long template PCR system. at least two DNA clones per cell clone were sequenced to confirm the presence of the inserted affinity tag. all chosen insertions into NS4B severely diminished or abolished transient replication of a subgenomic JFH1 replicon. only replicons containing the tag after Ala-38 replicated to a detectable level, whereas the insertions at the other sites completely abrogated HCV RNA replication. single mutations Q31R and Q117R, a combination thereof, and the double mutation Q11R plus D34A all rescued RNA replication of the NS4B alanine 38 HA tag insertion construct. replication efficiencies at later time points were comparable to that of the wt replicon. firefly luciferase (Fluc) or neomycin-phosphotransferase (neoR) is expressed as an N-terminal fusion with 16 amino acids of the N-terminal region of the core protein (black line) the second cistron (NS3 to NS5B) is translated via the IRES of the encephalomyocarditis virus. Huh7-Lunet cells were transfected with the full-length HCV RNAs specified on the right. culture supernatants were harvested at the given time points. infectivity titers were determined by limiting-dilution assay. Huh7-Lunet cells were transfected with the in vitro-transcribed luciferase replicon RNAs specified at the top of each panel. after 48 h, cells were fixed, permeabilized with digitonin, and stained with NS4B- and HA-specific antibodies. cells overexpressing CANXHA were fixed, permeabilized with Triton X-100, stained with CANX- and HA-specific antibodies prior to confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. only merged images are shown. Scale bars represent 5 m. sg4BHA31R replicon and CANXHA control cell line isolated intracellular membranes. cells containing an analogous subgenomic replicon without the HA tag served as an additional specificity control. the majority of viral RNA and proteins was broadly distributed in fractions 7 to 11. cell containing a stably replicating wild-type replicon (HCV wt) and control cells stably overexpressing CANXHA were broken by hypotonic lysis. postnuclear cytosolic supernatants were separated by discontinuous sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. after elution with HA peptide, purified material was used for further analyses. multiple large (>500 nm in length) and partially collapsed membrane structures were detected in control eluates of CANXHA-expressing cells. a lower number of membranous structures, corresponding to spherical vesicles with a diameter of 50 to 250 nm, were present in the NS4BHA-purified fraction. scale bars represent 100 nm. more than 100 structures per sample were classified as specified at the top. samples were negatively stained with uranylacetate and examined. 48%, 59%, and 63% of DMVs were positive for NS3, NS5A, and dsRNA respectively. the specificity of immunolabeling was confirmed by quantification of gold particles on membranes. these results demonstrate that besides NS4BHA, NS3 and NS5A are associated with HCV-induced DMVs. equal aliquots of NS4BHA-purified and unspecifically bound material were subjected to treatment with nuclease (1 U/l Benzonase), protease (8 mg/ml proteinase K) and detergent (1% Triton X-100) for 1 h at 25\u00b0C as indicated at the bottom. subsequently, HCV RNA was extracted and quantified by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. total HCV RNA was quantified before and after the in vitro replicase assay. equal amounts of control CANXHA and NS4BHA-purified membranes were subjected to an in vitro replicase assay in the absence () or presence (+) of radioactively labeled [-32P]CTP. after immunolabeling with a BrdU-specific antibody, samples were examined by TEM. only background labeling of membranes was detected with CANXHA control ER membranes and membranes subjected to reaction mixtures lacking BrUTP. the gold label was detected on the outsides of DMVs (27%) (Fig. 6Cb) and also in their interiors (23%). host factors, NS5A and NS5B have been identified as NS5A and NS5B interactors. membrane structures were double labeled for the viral replicase protein NS5A. cellular proteins VAP-A and -B (10-nm colloidal gold) were readily detected. the results revealed an 2-fold enrichment of both cellular proteins on HCV-induced DMVs compared to that on ER control membranes (c and d) the cellular proteins VAP-A and VAP-B are enriched in DMVs. NS4BHA-purified ER control membranes were only decorated with gold particles after P-O immunolabeling, indicating an overall low abundance of cholesterol in ER membranes. determination of cholesterol label density revealed a significant, 9-fold enrichment of cholesterol in HCV-remodeled membranes compared to that in control ER membranes. purified ER control (CANXHA) and HCV-remodeled membranes were labeled for cholesterol using biotinylated perfringolysin O (10-nm gold) and for NS5A (15-nm gold) scale bars correspond to 100 nm. aliquots of NS4BHA-purified material were subjected to treatment with methyl-cyclodextrin (MCD; 10 mM), nuclease (1 U/l Benzonase) and/or detergent (1% Triton X-100) for 1 h at 25\u00b0C. 121 5.1 nm compared to 183 5.5 nm (means SEMs) in the untreated control. results emphasize the role of cholesterol as a structural component of DMV membranes. we wanted to insert an affinity tag into this protein and express it in the context of a functional HCV replicon. the highest number of NS4B-resistant colonies was obtained with the HA tag insertion mutant after Ala-38. no or only very few cell clones were obtained with all the other mutants. for each given cell clone we determined the predominant nucleotide sequence of the NS3- to NS5A-coding region of the replicon contained therein. wt genome and a mutant that due to a deletion in the E1/E2-coding region were unable to produce infectious virus particles. fewer infectious particles were released from cells transfected with the NS4B mutant at all time points. a 30-fold increase in viral progeny release from transfected cells was detected between 24 and 48 h after transfection. numbers indicate amino acid positions of the JFH1 isolate. luciferase activity in cell lysates was determined. data were normalized to the 4-h value that reflects transfection efficiency. NS4BHA was readily detectable via the HA tag. in replicon cells, the abundance of 4BHA31R was reduced concomitant with a reduction in NS5A steady-state levels. replicon cells were harvested 72 h posttransfection and analyzed by immunoblotting. cells were fixed, permeabilized with digitonin, and stained with NS4B- and HA-specific antibodies. only merged images are shown. scale bars represent 5 m. CANXHA is a type I membrane protein with its ectodomain localizing to the ER lumen and a short cytoplasmic tail to which the HA tag was fused. if analysis confirmed recognition of CANXHA with the HA-specific antibody as well as unaltered ER morphology in cells overexpressing this protein. western blot analysis revealed specific copurification of NS3 and NS5A along with HA-tagged NS4B. we also detected CANX in the NS4BHA-specific pull-down assay. eluates were examined for HCV protein and RNA content. monospecific antibodies were used to detect calnexin (CANX), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), NS3, NS5A, and NS4B. no HCV RNA was detected in CANXHA samples, as indicated by the inverted triangles. quantification of total membranous structures per area revealed significant enrichment in the NS4BHA-containing preparation compared to that in the untagged wt NS4B control. compared to that in the untagged wt NS4B control, classification of membrane structures revealed distinct differences for CANXHA- and NS4BHA-captured membranes. dsRNA is a commonly accepted marker for viral RNA replication intermediates. a major portion of DMVs in the NS4BHA elution fraction was found to be decorated with gold particles. only background labeling was detected on naive ER membranes. the combination of nuclease and detergent treatments led to complete degradation of HCV RNA. the small amounts of unspecifically captured HCV RNA present in the preparation with the nontagged NS4B wt were also nuclease resistant. s were incubated with rNTPs, arguing for in vitro replicase activity. we performed metabolic radiolabeling of the viral subgenomic RNA. the incorporation of [-32P]CTP into nascent viral RNA confirmed that isolated membranes contained functional HCV replicase. panel indicates the percentage of non-specifically gold-labeled DMVs (a) or of DMVs with gold labeling on the exterior (b) or apparent in the interior (c) the scale bar in each panel corresponds to 100 nm. (D) Quantification of immunolabeling. cellular proteins VAP-A and -B are associated with DMVs. viruses exploit host cell functions to a large extent. the subversion of cellular proteins by positive-strand RNA viruses is a major focus of research. quantitative analysis of differently sized gold particles on membranes revealed specificity of detection of NS5A. most NS5A-positive membranous structures from NS4BHA capture also contained VAP-A or -B. ER control membranes almost exclusively exhibited single labeling for VAP-A or -B. at least 50 membranous structures per condition were analyzed. only membranes positive for NS5A were considered for the analysis. the analysis is based on 50 membranous structures with a total membrane length of more than 50 m for each condition. quantification of 10- and 15-nm colloidal gold particles on membranes per area of the grid showed explicit tagging of cholesterol and NS5A. determination of cholesterol label density revealed a significant, 9-fold enrichment of cholesterol in HCV-remodeled membranes. structures with a total membrane length of more than 60 m for each condition. the analysis is based on at least 50 membranous structures with a total membrane length of more than 50 m. the HCV RNA amount was reduced 2-fold, indicating a structural function of cholesterol for DMV and thus for HCV RNA stability. however, nuclease treatment of cholesterol-depleted membranes did not further decrease HCV RNA amounts. the main problem is to identify a site that tolerates the insertion of a heterologous sequence without affecting the functionality of the viral protein. NS4BHA31R supported all NS4B-associated functions in the viral replication cycle, at least those required in cell culture. despite detailed knowledge about the three-dimensional architecture of DMVs in HCV-infected cells, determination of their viral and cellular constituents and their exact role in the viral replication cycle is lacking. despite detailed knowledge about the three-dimensional architecture of DMVs, determination of their viral and cellular constituents and their exact role in the viral replication cycle is lacking. a subset of DMVs with apparent membrane discontinuity stained positive for BrU in their interiors. a subset of DMVs with apparent membrane discontinuity stained positive for BrU in their interiors. a subset of DMVs with apparent membrane discontinuity stained positive for BrU in their interiors. we cannot determine whether those DMVs correspond to a subset of not yet fully closed structures. membranous replication factories are shielded from nucleases and intracellular RNA sensors. this topology requires extensive transport of metabolites and viral RNA between the cytosol and the DMV lumen. the bulk of viral RNA resides in a nuclease-protected environment. positive-strand RNA viruses depend heavily on exploitation of metabolic pathways. subversion of host cell factors by HCV and other positive-strand RNA viruses has been a major focus of research in recent years. but little is known about their exact localization with respect to viral replication sites. cholesterol was found to be highly concentrated in HCV-induced DMVs. the 9-fold enrichment indicates a very high relative cholesterol concentration in DMV membranes. the reduced DMV size and decreased HCV genome stability induced by cholesterol removal support this assumption. OSBPs have been shown to exchange sterols for PI4P between different membranes. thus, in a simplified view, transport cholesterol to PI4P-rich compartments. however, HCV, as well as picornaviruses, prominently redistributes and induces intracellular PI4P pools by subversion of PI4KIII. NS4B has proven to be very sensitive to sequence alterations. the exchange of single amino acid residues often exhibits dramatic effects on viral RNA replication (14, 15, 30, 46) NS4B containing an HA tag insertion after Ala-38 still supported HCV RNA replication when at least one additional mutation was present. HA purification overcomes the inherent limitations of antibodies directly targeting viral proteins. despite detailed knowledge about the three-dimensional architecture of DMVs in HCV-infected cells, determination of their viral and cellular constituents is lacking. despite detailed knowledge about the three-dimensional architecture of DMVs, determination of their viral and cellular constituents and their exact role in the viral replication cycle is lacking. TEM has successfully applied to spherule-type replication factories of arteriviruses (51) and coronaviruses (52) and to spherule-type replication factories of rubella virus (53), alphaviruses (54), flock house virus (55), and brome mosaic virus (56). a model of the membrane-associated HCV replicase complex is proposed. the topology requires extensive transport of metabolites and viral RNA between the cytosol and the DMV lumen. this topology requires extensive transport of metabolites and viral RNA between the cytosol and the DMV lumen. this could occur directly for DMVs that are not yet closed and thus linked to the cytosol (19), or may be mediated via a previously unknown transport function of a viral and/or cellular protein. despite detailed knowledge about virus dependency on certain cellular proteins, little is known about their exact localization with respect to viral replication sites. we investigated the localization of two well-described HCV host dependency factors, VAP-A and VAP-B (37, 38, 39), which in uninfected cells are implicated in ER homeostasis and vesicular trafficking. cholesterol was found to be highly concentrated in HCV-induced DMVs. the 9-fold enrichment indicates a very high relative cholesterol concentration in DMV membranes. this would result in local cholesterol concentrations that might be similar to that of endosomes or the plasma membrane (64). HCV, as well as picornaviruses, prominently redistributes and induces intracellular PI4P pools by subversion of phosphatidyl-inositol-4-kinase class III alpha and beta (PI4KIII /), respectively. further studies are needed to address this unifying hypothesis."}
