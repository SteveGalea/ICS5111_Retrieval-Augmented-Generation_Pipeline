{"summary": "virus adaptation to enable efficient human-to-human transmission could lead to worldwide pandemics [2]\u2013[3]. the island of Corsica is an important crossing area for infectious agents, which increases public health importance of establishing an efficient and reliable surveillance system in the region. the corsican Sentinelles network is the only network performing viral testing of ILIs in Corsica. the GPs of the Corsican Sentinelles network participate in the nationwide continuous surveillance of the French Sentinelles network. the network currently includes 47 GPs across the island (16% of Corsican GPs) all samples were tested for influenza viruses A (A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm2009) and B by influenza real-time reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2013PCR) (Table 1) [9]\u2013[14]. Samples were also tested for the simultaneous detection of 26 types/subtypes of respiratory viral pathogens. hemagglutinin (HA) sequences were amplified by RT\u2013PCR using primer sets for human influenza viruses. hemagglutinin (HA) sequences were amplified by RT\u2013PCR using primer sets for human influenza viruses. the GPs report on a daily basis the sociodemographic and medical data for each patient visited (age, sex, diagnosis and hospitalization) the weekly number of visits coded as \"R80 Influenza/R80 ILI\" by SOS M\u00e9decins, was analyzed. the chosen indicator of ILI activity was the number of ILIs coded per week divided by the total number of visits coded per week. a cluster is defined as five cases or more within 4 days and must be reported to the local health authority using a standardized notification form. the total study population was grouped into the following six age groups: 0\u20134, 5\u201314, 15\u201329, 30\u201344, 45\u201364, and >65 years old. cases in age group i (there are n age groups in total), and n is the total population of an age group i. a ratio above 1 indicates disproportionate risk. a ratio above 1 indicates disproportionate risk. the GPs of the Corsican Sentinelles network participate in the nationwide continuous surveillance of the French Sentinelles network. they report each week the number of new consultations for several health indicators, including ILIs [11]\u2013[12]. this system has been strengthened in Corsica since 2006\u20132007. human rhinovirus (HRV) A/B/C, human respiratory syncytial virus A/B, and human metapneumovirus results were confirmed by a real-time RT\u2013PCR. four influenza A viruses have not been sub-typed. double-stranded sequencing of purified PCR products was performed using an Applied Biosystems Sequencer (ABI 3700, Perkin-Elmer) Phylogenetic trees were constructed using a Neighborg-Joining method based on Kimura's two-parameter genetic distances matrix with 1,000 bootstrap replicates (n = 1000) using the MEGA 5.0 program. the weekly number of ILIs coded as \"R80 Influenza/R80 ILI\" by SOS M\u00e9decins, was analyzed. the chosen indicator of ILI activity was the number of ILIs coded per week divided by the total number of visits coded per week. clusters of ARIs are defined as patients who tested positive for influenza by RT\u2013PCR performed on a nasal swab. a cluster is defined as five cases or more within 4 days and must be reported to the local health authority using a standardized notification form. data collected from ILI patients consulting the Sentinelles GPs was entered anonymously in EpiData (v. 1.4.2) surveillance systems analyzed had a significant and strong correlation with the ILI consultation rates of the Corsican Sentinelles GPs during the epidemic period. ILI incidence rates (grey line) per 100 000 inhabitants and weekly distribution of ILI samples positives (histogram bars) to at least one respiratory viruses analyzed (GPs of the Corsican Sentinelles network. Across all surveillance networks, the RIRs were consistently highest for the youngest patients (15 years old) compared with the adults. no clusters of ARIs were declared during the 2012\u20132013 ILI outbreak and epidemic period by the 16 participating nursing homes. the global VC of residents against seasonal 2012\u20132013 influenza virus was 87.6% (95% CI, (86.3%\u201389.0%) for the health care workers, the global VC was 16.0% (95% CI, (13.0%\u201318.9%)) median age of the 182 patients reported by the virology surveillance system was 30.0 years (min = 1, max = the most frequent combination was an influenza B virus with one other respiratory pathogen (Table 3). single infections accounted for 71.5% of patients. age groups 0\u20134 N = 22 5\u201314 N = 33 15\u201329 N = 34 30\u201344 N = 49 45\u201364 N = 34 >65 N = 10 Pvalue Positive (any type type) 100 93.9 70.6 71.4 82.4 70.0 0.012 At least one Influenza virus 72.7 51.5 50.0 61.2 61.8 20.0 0.090 Influenza A 40.9 18.8 29.4 30.6 23.5 10.0 0.385 Influenza B 36.4 30.3 20.6 32.6 38. the evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method. the bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. the influenza B strain belonging to group 3 was characterized by mutations N116K (antigenic site C), K298E, and E312K. the evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method. weekly rates (black line) of J09 to J11 diagnostics estimated over totality of number of visits coded per week by GPs of the emergency general practice network (SOS M\u00e9decins) ILI incidence rates (grey line) per 100 000 inhabitants and weekly distribution of ILI samples positives to at least one respiratory viruses analyzed. three severe influenza cases were reported by ICU clinicians. they median patient age was 62 years (min = 59, max = 66) the patients had at least one risk factor for severe influenza (obesity, pulmonary pathology, or aged >65 years, respectively) male sex (%) 59.3 40.8 61.0 55.8 58.8 Age groups (%) 0\u20134 12.1 15.0 15.0 14.0 17.6 5\u201314 18.1 14.3 15.0 30.2 29.4 15\u201329 18.7 16.3 14.0 16.3 29.4 30\u201344 26.7 23.8 30.0 11.6 23.5 45\u201364 18.7 19.1 24.0 16.3 0 >65 5.5 4.7 22.0 11.6 HAdV 1 A (H1N1)pdm2009, HBoV 2 A (H1N1)pdm2009,HMPV 1 A (H1N1)pdm2009, HRSV 1 A(H3N2), HRSV 1 HRSV, HAdV 1 Total N (% of 182) 17 of 182 (9.3%) Table 4. group 6 was characterized by the additional mutation D163I (antigenic site D) and group 7 by the mutations S143G (antigenic site A) and A197T, with respect to A/California/7/2009. the evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method. all influenza B viruses isolated in corsica during the 2012\u20132013 influenza like-illness outbreak were of the Yamagata lineage. the strains belonging to group 2 were characterized by the mutations R48K (antigenic site C), P108A and I150S (antigenic site A), Y165N (antigenic site B), T181A (antigenic site D) and D229G (antigenic site D) the evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Join the rate of positivity for at least one respiratory virus decreased significantly with age. no clusters of ARIs were declared during the 2012\u20132013 ILI outbreak by the sentinel nursing homes. this result could be explained by the high specificity of the ILI case definition used in the present study. this peak in the 30\u201344-year-old group could be explained by proximity to children as parents. in corsica, no clusters of ARIs were declared during the 2012\u20132013 ILI outbreak in sentinel nursing homes. this was remarkable because of the significant cocirculation of influenza A and B viruses and of other respiratory viruses. the HA sequences of A(H3N2) viruses isolated in corsica during the 2012\u20132013 season [10] were characterized by seven amino acid substitutions at four antigenic sites compared with A/Victoria/361/2011 (2012\u20132013 vaccine strain), suggesting a drift. the lack of virological confirmation for the patients of the emergency general practice network (SOS M\u00e9decins) is an important gap. the consortium will allow the integration of the virological surveillance of more than 20 respiratory viruses with the ILI clinical surveillance of the OSCOUR network (hospital emergency units), the SOS M\u00e9decins network (emergency network of GPs) and the surveillance of ARIs in the sentinel nursing homes."}
