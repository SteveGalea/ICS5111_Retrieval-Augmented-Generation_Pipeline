{"summary": "all participants were working in wards with SARS inpatients, some of which included non-SARS patients. the case group included all infected hospital workers in the five hospitals of the new Territories East cluster of the Hospital Authority in Hong Kong who were registered as SARS cases. 57 of 72 cases nominated 114 controls who completed the questionnaire. 15 cases did not nominate a control and 30 controls were randomly selected from the duty roster of the day before the case felt unwell, matching for job position. a respondent was considered to be exposed to a particular risk if he or she had \u201cnever\u201d or \u201coccasionally\u201d been using personal protection equipment rather than \u201cmost or all of the time\u201d. questions regarding the frequency of hand washing after making contact with SARS patients, patients in general and when there was no patient contact were also asked. a trained research assistant contacted the respondents by telephone to follow up on incomplete or unclear answers. a multivariate conditional logistic regression was fitted using a forward-stepwise procedure with all variables that were marginally significant (p 0.10). logXact for Windows version 4.1 was used for all calculations (7). 6 4.2 15 20.8 8.85 (2.46 to 48.28) 0.0002 Direct contact with patients in generalc 2 1.4 12 16.7 11.54 (2.56 to 106.36) 0.0002 No patient contactf 16 11.7 19 27.1 3.42 (1.38 to 9.30) 0.0061 Glovesb Direct contact with patients in generalc 5 3.6 7 9.7 3.53 (0.77 to 21.85) 0.0001 No patient contactf 20 14.6 19 27.1 2.42 (1.05 to 5. cInformation on 4 controls and 2 cases missing. eInformation on 5 controls and 1 case missing. gInformation on 6 controls and 1 case missing. gInformation on 6 controls and 2 cases missing. hIncluding N95, goggles, gown, gloves and cap.
