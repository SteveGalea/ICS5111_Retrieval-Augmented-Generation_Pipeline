{"summary": "systematic review and meta-analysis to assess clinical severity of viral co-infections as compared to single viral respiratory infections. results Twenty-one studies involving 4,280 patients were included. human metapneumovirus (hMPV) have been identified amongst children with single viral infections. other viruses including adenovirus (ADV), coronavirus and human rhinovirus (HRV) have been reported amongst children with viral co-infections. no systematic review on this topic has been published to date. primary and secondary outcomes We excluded studies which only reported data on outpatients, used multiple diagnostic techniques for viral detection, or included viral-bacterial co-infections. primary outcome reflecting clinical disease severity was length of hospital stay (LOS) primary outcome reflecting clinical disease severity was length of hospital stay (LOS) the maximum score was 8, the minimum score 0. It was decided a priori that a score of 7 was reflective of high methodological quality (e.g., low risk of bias), a score of 5 or 6 indicated moderate quality and a score of 4 or less indicated low quality (e.g., high risk of bias). the quality of evidence was independently assessed for each outcome by 2 reviewers according to the GRADE framework. n, o Mechanical Ventilation 472 per 1000 746 per 1000 (288 to 1000) RR 1.58 (0.61 to 4.13) 285 (3) lowp, q, r, s Note: N = number, CI = confidence interval, GRADE [31] = Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation, RR = risk ratio, SD = standard deviation. all the eight studies had serious design limitations including absence of notification or adjustment for important prognostic factors. there was moderate statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 47%, p = 0.06), which was not explained on further subgroup analysis. a priori hypothesis of no effect was met, serious imprecision was attributed to the inadequate cumulative sample size and large CI. two of the three studies did not primarily focus on the comparison between single vs viral co-infections. interaction tests for subgroup differences were conducted using the Chi-square and I2 statistic. we made a post-hoc stratified analysis of \u201cchildren\u201d by age subgroups based on data availability in the abstracted studies. two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts. potentially relevant full text articles were then screened independently for eligibility. disagreements resolved by consensus discussion or third-party adjudication. high quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect. high quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect. there was high statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 72%, p0.001), which was not explained on further subgroup analysis. only three [33] [19] [24] of the eleven studies focused primarily on the comparison of disease severity between single vs viral co-infections. all five studies had serious design limitations including absence of notification or adjustment for important prognostic factors. there was high statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 75%, p = 0.05), which was not explained on further subgroup analysis. no serious imprecision: Cumulative sample size was appropriate. Statistical analysis was performed using review manager 5.1 (Cochrane Collaboration) [11]. random-effects models were used to obtain summary estimates for all outcomes. for continuous outcomes, we used the inverse variance method to combine results. 37 of the 1,017 unique records identified through our literature search. of these, 37 were assessed for eligibility in full text. 21 studies met inclusion criteria (all cohort studies) of which 16 (76.1%) provided data for quantitative analysis. 2yo Undefined conditions NPAs RT-PCR yes no no yes Choi [16] 2010 S.

A score of 7 represented high quality, a score 5\u20136: moderate quality and a score 4: low quality. there was no significant difference in length of admission between groups (mean difference) 0.20 days, 95% CI 0.94, 0.53, p = 0.59) in post-hoc age subgroup analyses, the effect was similar across all age subgroups (I2 for subgroup analysis 0%, p = 0.77) in post-hoc age subgroup analyses, the effect was similar across all age subgroups (Figure 2). Sensitivity analysis including only studies on viruses with a higher pathogenic potential revealed similar results. there was no significant difference between groups (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.61, 4.13, p = 0.35) but heterogeneity was high (I2 = 75%). in three studies each; acute respiratory wheezing and influenza-like illness (ILI) in one study each. one study did not specify the type of respiratory illness. iagen OneStep yes no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no studies included commercial assays (RT-PCR) were labeled as RT-PCR kit. risk of bias and overall quality of evidence Applying the adapted NOS, the studies achieved a median of 4 out of 8 points (IQR 3\u20134). the maximum score within the total points category was 8, the minimum score 0. A score of 7 represented high quality, a score 5\u20136: moderate quality and a score 4: low quality. there was no significant difference in length of admission between groups. a value less than zero indicates a shorter length of hospital stay (number of days) in patients co-infected with more than virus (favors co-infection). in patients co-infected with more than virus (favors co-infection). 3%, p = 0.04) with higher mortality in preschool children with viral co-infections. this was based on only one study, found to be at a high risk of bias. a value higher than one indicates a higher mortality in patients co-infected with more than virus (favors single infection). 8 studies involving 2,294 patients provided data for the meta-analysis on oxygen requirement as an outcome. no difference was found between both groups with high heterogeneity. the effect was similar across all age subgroups. there was no evidence for differences in effects across age subgroups in post hoc analyses. one may have expected differences in how co-infections affect patient outcomes. a recent experimental study assessing the course of infection of young versus old mice infected with RSV and/or HMPV. strengths of this systematic review include systematic, protocol-driven and comprehensive review with extensive literature search, minimal evidence for publication bias and successful attempts to contact authors. rigorous assessment of eligibility ensured high reliability of the results. limitations predominantly relate to the high risk of bias of the included studies. no studies reported risk estimates adjusted for important prognostic factors such as underlying co-morbidities or bacterial co-infections. an insufficient number of studies precluded some subgroup analyses we planned a priori. in patients co-infected with more than one virus (favors co-infections) CI = confidence interval, df = degrees of freedom. age groups: Infants 0\u201323 months of age, Preschool children 0\u201359 months of age and Children 0\u201317 years old."}
