{"summary": "3.2 million deaths have occurred due to lower respiratory infections and 1.4 million from tuberculosis alone worldwide (2). many new infectious diseases have emerged and few old diseases re-emerged, which were once considered to be no longer a threat to the human being. the major challenges to combat such diseases are that for many of them, there are no effective drugs available. mophilus influenza type b, diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertusis, meningococcus and pneumococcus (15), however they require an adjuvant to potentiate their immunogenicity. nanocarrier based delivery systems provide a suitable route of administration of vaccine molecules and enhance cellular uptake. nanocarriers can be conjugated to nanoparticles surface or incapsulated into core of particles. antigen can be conjugated to the nanoparticles surface or incapsulated into core of the particles. antigen presenting cells (APCs) could further increase delivery of particles into antigen presenting cells. nano-immuno stimulators are the nano scale (20\u2013100 nm) vaccine particles that can improve vaccine efficacy in vivo better than bulk molecules. nano-immuno stimulators are the nano scale (20\u2013100 nm) vaccine particles that can improve vaccine efficacy in vivo better than bulk molecules. different types of NPs used to deliver antigens have been listed in Table 1. antigen nanocarrier used Disease References AGAINST BACTERIAL INFECTION Antigenic protein Poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanospheres Anthrax (41) DNA encoding T cell epitopes of Esat-6 and FL Chitosan Nanoparticle Tuberculosis (43) Polysaccharides Liposomes Pneumonia (44) some of the viral antigens were successfully delivered using inorganic NPs as carriers. delivery of viral and bacterial antigens using gold NPs was also found to induce quite robust host immune responses against influenza, immunodeficiency virus, foot and mouth, and tuberculosis diseases in mice. sp65 antigen in gold NPs exhibited significant reduction in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis, causative agent of human tuberculosis, burden in infected mice. few studies have used hollow mesosporous silica, nanotube and spherical forms of carbon NPs as adjuvants to improve immunogenicity and delivery of protein and peptide antigens against viral infections. some natural biopolymers such as alginate, pullans, inulins, and chitosan have been used as adjuvants (90\u201393) chitosan NPs were demonstrated as nanocarrier molecules for HBV antigens (55), DNA vaccine (56), and Newcastle disease vaccine (42). liposomes entrapped in multilamellar lipid vesicles elicit strong T and B-cell responses. antigenic peptides conjugated to phosphatidylserine (PS-liposomes) elicited strong protective immunity against fungal infection. VLPs are composed of self-assembled viral membrane that forms a monomeric complex displaying a high density of epitopes (115, 116) it is also possible to chemically couple non-protein antigens and small organic molecules onto the viral surface to produce bioconjugates with VLPs. a single dose of dendrimer encapsulated multiple antigens was found to produce strong antibody and T-cell responses against Ebola virus, H1N1 influenza, and Toxoplasma gondii (123). this generation of robust immune response was due to efficient uptake of dendrimers by the host cells. a significant increase in the vaccine efficacy of HIV transactivator of transcription (TAT) based DNA vaccine was observed due to enhanced cellular uptake of PMAM polymeric NPs have received great attention for their applications in the delivery of a number of vaccines. poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid; PLGA) or poly (lactic acid; PLA) poly (lactic acid; PLGA) conjugated antigens exhibited strong immuno-stimulatory property by inducing cytokine and nitric oxide production against mycobacteria infection. chitosan NPs were shown as nanocarrier molecules for HBV antigens (55), DNA vaccine (56), and Newcastle disease vaccine (42). delivery of PLGA and chitosan NP conjugated vaccine molecules enhanced the immune responses at the mucosal site (95, 96) liposomes can encapsulate hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances. hydrophilic molecules can be incorporated into the aqueous core. hydrophobic molecules are encased within the phospholipid bilayer. a specific immune response was successfully generated after the delivery of an antigen using virus capsid protein SV40 in mammalian cells. a single dose of dendrimers encapsulated multiple antigens was found to produce strong antibody and T-cell responses against Ebola virus, H1N1 influenza, and Toxoplasma gondii. a significant increase in the vaccine efficacy of PMAM dendrimer was observed due to enhanced cellular uptake of PMAM dendrimer (124) the possibility to tailor the dendrimers to attain certain biological and physico-chemical properties have made dendrimers promising candidates for the development of new generation vaccines with enhanced immunogenic properties. chitosan NPs were demonstrated as nanocarrier molecules for hepatitis B and influenza viruses. the delivery of PLGA and chitosan NP conjugated vaccine molecules enhanced the immune responses at the mucosal site. liposomes deliver vaccines by fusion with the target cell membrane (101). hydrophilic molecules can be incorporated into the aqueous core, while hydrophobic molecules are encased within the phospholipid bilayer. antigenic proteins entrapped in multilamellar lipid vesicles elicit strong T and B-cell responses (102) VLPs are composed of self-assembled viral membrane that forms a monomeric complex displaying a high density of epitopes (115, 116). it is also possible to chemically couple non-protein antigens and small organic molecules onto the viral surface to produce bioconjugates with VLPs. this generation of robust immune response was found to be due to efficient uptake of dendrimers by the host cells. a significant increase in the vaccine efficacy of TAT based DNA vaccine was observed due to enhanced cellular uptake of PMAM dendrimer (124). a significant increase in the vaccine efficacy of HIV transactivator of transcription (TAT) based DNA vaccine was observed due to enhanced cellular uptake of PMAM dendrimer (124). several toll-like receptor agonists were also explored as immune activators. different immune effector cells such as macrophages, B-cells and DCs express different types of TLRs. these specific interactions eventually initiate downstream signaling cascades to ensure elimination or generation of immunity against pathogens. the plasmid vector translocates to the nucleus to initiate transcription of recombinant genes using the host cellular machinery. a similar type of study has been conducted in the past where the vaccination of DNA or RNA constructs expressing mycobacterium antigens were capable of inducing humoral as well as cellular immune responses. cytokines are known as important signaling molecules secreted by different cells in response to external stimuli. anti-tuberculosis effects were due to production of high antibody titers in immunized mice (130). different immune effector cells such as macrophages, B-cells and DCs express different types of TLRs. these interactions eventually initiate downstream signaling cascades to ensure elimination or generation of immunity against pathogens. the plasmid vector translocates to the nucleus to initiate transcription of recombinant genes using the host cellular machinery. a similar type of study has been conducted in the past where the vaccination of DNA or RNA constructs expressing mycobacterium antigens were capable of inducing humoral as well as cellular immune responses. nanocarriers are a class of adjuvant formulations that consist of saponins, cholesterol and phospholipids in specific ratios. chitosan and dextran sulfate NPs were used for the preparation of cationic and anionic antigenic formulations. particle geometry such as surface to volume ratio plays an important role in the determination of immunogen release and degradation kinetics. size The size of NPs determines the mode of cellular uptake and specificity (155, 156) smaller NPs (20\u2013200 nm) were readily endocytosed by the resident DCs, while larger size (500\u20132,000 nm) NPs were effectively taken up by the migratory DCs. cationic polysterene NPs were efficiently internalized by the APCs. this may be due to electrostatic interactions between the cationic NPs with anionic cell membranes (162, 163) neutral silica-silane shell polymer NPs were less effective in the activation of innate immune cells (128) nano rods were particularly delivered to the nucleus while nano-sheet were retained in the cytoplasm (146, 147, 155). this is an important aspect in the context of improving antigen processing and presentation to T-cells. PLGA NPs of large size (1, 7 and 17 m) showed reduced internalization rate in comparison to smaller NPs (157). smaller NPs (20\u2013200 nm) were readily endocytosed by the resident DCs. larger size (500\u20132,000 nm) NPs were effectively taken up by the migratory DCs. NPs of 150 nm diameter and 450 nm height showed more cellular uptake compared to particles having 1,200 200 nm size. smaller NPs are able to alter the cell signaling processes more efficaciously than the large NPs (31). surface charge Vaccine loaded NPs can also be targeted to specific sites by modifying the NP surface charge. worm-like particles were impaired in phagocytosis as compared to spherical NPs (151). this distinction was ascribed to the differences in contact area between NPs and the target cell membrane. nano rods and nano sheets were internalized via clathrin mediated endocytosis. nano-sheets were particularly delivered to the nucleus while nano-sheet were retained in the cytoplasm. this property is considered useful in the prevention of non-specific adsorption of proteins on NPs. such non-specific adsorption of proteins and their uptake by phagocytic cells can also be preventing by the incorporation of an alkyl linker between the PEG and thiol moieties on NPs. several nanocarriers have been shown to specifically activate DCs to effectuate anti-tumor or anti-viral immune responses. nano-TiO2 and Fe3O4-TiO2 particles could function as a useful vector to promote vaccine delivery in immune cells. endogenously generated antigens are presented in complex with class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC I) on the membrane of APCs to CD8+ T lymphocytes. the activated CD8+ cells kill the infected cells by inducing cytotoxicity. macrophages can be easily targeted by surface engineered NPs. ligands agonist to macrophage receptors can be conjugated on the NP surface. NP endocytosis depends on the type of cell surface receptors. intravenous injection of anti-inflammatory peptide encapsulated polymeric NPs reduced neutrophil recruitment and subsequently hyperinflammation to prevent further tissue damage. the use of NPs to deliver vaccine/drugs in a controlled fashion is now considered as an attractive approach to develop therapeutic strategies against a range of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. surface conjugated immunogenic proteins and peptides were able to activate B cells much stronger than encapsulated antigens (200) a single dose of PLGA NPs with surface displayed ovalbumin (OVA) elicited strong antibody responses in vivo as compared to free OVA (201, 202) NPs can also be used to activate specific immune responses. anti-inflammatory peptide encapsulated polymeric NPs reduced neutrophil recruitment and subsequently hyperinflammation to prevent further tissue damage. the use of NPs to deliver vaccine/drugs in a controlled fashion is now considered as an attractive approach to develop therapeutic strategies against a range of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. a single dose of PLGA NPs with surface displayed ovalbumin (OVA) elicited strong antibody responses in vivo as compared to free OVA (201, 202) NPs can also activate specific immune responses. cytosolic antigens are loaded on MHC class I molecules. polymer NPs (206\u2013209) have been used for antigen delivery to cytosol. inorganic and polymeric NPs have also been used for antigen delivery to cytosol. lipid NPs were shown to induce CD8+ T cell expansion. soluble antigens cannot be effectively endocytosed by the APCs. soluble vaccine antigens can be improved by conjugating them with nanocarriers that can facilitate the recognition and uptake by APCs. a TNF-mimicking eight-amino-acid peptide (p8) induced significant protection against parasite infection in BALB/c mice accompanied by activation of CD8+ T cells. NPs can be tailored for non-invasive administration and prolonged delivery of the vaccine antigens to a specific location."}
