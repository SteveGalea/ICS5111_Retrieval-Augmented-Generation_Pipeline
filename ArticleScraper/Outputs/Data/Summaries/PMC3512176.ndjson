{"summary": "URTI is the most common presentation and may progress to LRTI in 17% to 84% of patients. risk factors associated with progression to LRTI include older age, myeloablative regimen, lymphopenia, mismatched or unrelated donor transplant, graft-versus-host disease, and pre-engraftment status. a randomized clinical trial in HSCT recipients with RSV-URTI compared two dose schedules of aerosolized ribavirin (continuous vs. intermittent) both of them were identified to be effective in preventing RSV-LRTI. time of administration may play an important role in the success of ribavirin-based therapy, with those treated at URTI stage having more favorable outcomes than those treated at LRTI stage. ribavirin is the only drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of high-risk infants and young children hospitalized with RSV-LRTI [34]. ribavirin-based therapy had variable success rates for preventing RSV-associated morbidity or mortality in high-risk HCT recipients [21]. ribavirin-based therapy had variable success rates for preventing RSV-associated morbidity or mortality in high-risk recipients. recipients with RSV-URTI comparing two dose schedules of aerosolized ribavirin (continuous vs. intermittent) were identified to be effective in preventing RSV-LRTI. time of administration may play an important role in the success of ribavirin-based therapy, with those treated at URTI stage having more favorable outcomes than those treated at LRTI stage. the high cost of these drugs combined with a lack of clear evidence of efficacy in this patient population precludes their wide-scale acceptance. adherence to contact and respiratory droplet isolation will help reduce RSV infections in HCT recipients. mortality rates following LRTI can range from 15% to 28%. influenza infection is suspected in patients with \u201cflu-like\u201d symptoms during community outbreaks. prompt confirmation by immunofluorescence assays, enzyme immunoassays, cultures, or PCR-based assays is needed. antiviral therapy was critical in preventing LRTI and death from both strains. antiviral susceptibility patterns for various strains of human influenza virusa,b,c Oseltamivir Zanamivir M2 Inhibitorsd Pandemic 2009/H1N1 Susceptible Resistant Seasonal H1N1 Susceptible Mostly susceptible Seasonal H3N2 Susceptible Influenza B Susceptible Resistant Avian H5N1 Su oseltamivir- and zanamivir-resistant strains in vitro and in mouse models. laninamivir has efficacy comparable to that of oseltamivir. it may also be effective against oseltamivir-resistant strains. the main two contraindications for influenza vaccine are febrile illness and severe allergy to eggs. prophylaxis and preemptive treatment should be administered to all HCT recipients within 24 months of transplantation and to those who have GVHD. some studies have shown that oseltamivir prophylaxis may occasionally lead to the selection of resistant influenza strains. seasonal H1N1 has remained susceptible to zanamivir and M2 inhibitors [48-50]. the rece-nt pandemic 2009/H1N1 strain was only susceptible to zanamivir and zanamivir. intravenous formulations of neuraminidase inhibitors such as peramivir and zanamivir are still being evaluated in phase III clinical trials [51-54] this intravenous route may be advantageous for patients with graft versus host disease (GVHD) of the gastrointestinal tract, because of possible decreased absorption and less bioavailability of oral drugs. the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended daily chemoprophylaxis with an effective antiviral drug for immunocompromised individuals during community outbreaks. the vaccine should be administered prior to the onset of the influenza season and before transplantation or 4 to 6 months following transplantation. URTI is the most common presentation following an incubation period of 1 to 4 days. URTI is the most common presentation following an incubation period of 1 to 4 days. ribavirin therapy, with or without IVIG, has had conflicting results. no PIV-specific antiviral therapy is commercially available, and clinical management of HCT recipients relies on supportive care. the impact of IVIG on overall outcome still needs to be determined. HAdV belongs to the Adenoviridae family of DNA viruses with 6 subgroups and 51 known serotypes. it may infect up to 3% of HCT recipients overall, but has a higher incidence in allogeneic (6%) and pediatric (24-32%) HCT recipients. mortality rate in HCT recipients can be high (15-28%), especially in those with disseminated disease following DNAemia or LRTI. cidofovir is a monophosphate nucleoside analogue of cytosine. it appears to be the most effective agent in vitro against HAdV. no HAdV strains have been shown to be clinically resistant to this drug. adenovirus vaccine was stopped in 1996 because of a lack of funding. a new live oral vaccine against adenovirus types 4 and 7 was approved by the FDA in march 2011. a lack of randomized controlled trials makes it difficult to ascertain efficacy of available antiviral drugs for the treatment of HAdV infections. a few immunocompromised patients with adenoviral infections have been successfully treated with CMX001, without any serious adverse events reported. the main limiting factor in cidofovir use is its associated side effects, mainly the high incidence of nephrotoxicity. a new live oral vaccine against adenovirus types 4 and 7 was approved by the FDA in March 2011. human rhinovirus Commonly known to cause \u201cthe common cold\u201d in the general population, these non-enveloped RNA picornaviruses may cause severe infections in immunocompromised hosts such as HCT recipients [125-127], with the highest incidence in children. the prognosis largely depends upon the severity of immunosuppression. no specific antiviral therapy is available, and treatment is supportive with antihistamines, decongestants, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. many novel drugs, such as pleconaril, BTA-798, and inhaled interferon- 1a (SNG001), are being tested in the general patient population with rhinovirus infections. no drugs are currently licensed to treat HMPV infection. the only drug shown to be active against this virus is ribavirin. there is a dearth of knowledge about this virus and its treatment. the rate of progression to LRTI can range from 21% to 40%. mortality rate increases with the onset of LRTI. no drugs are currently licensed to treat HMPV infection. randomized clinical trials are needed to determine efficacy of novel antiviral agents. future research should focus on developing potent vaccines to prevent outbreaks and epidemics in the community. screening and restricting visitors with respiratory symptoms should be practiced. Vaccination of all caregivers and family members in close contact with immunocompromised patients is essential. active surveillance and sanitization of environmental surfaces contaminated with PIV is recommended."}
