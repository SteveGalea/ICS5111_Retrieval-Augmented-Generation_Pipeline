{"summary": "nonspecific reactive hepatitis is more common among patients with adenovirus, enterovirus and respiratory syncytial virus infection. ALT levels are better indicators of the severity of nonspecific reactive hepatitis. ALT and AST levels can rise by thousands of times the normal range. non-hepatic respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infections lead to increased levels of ALT and AST without hepatic failure. acute lower respiratory tract infection is a common cause of nonspecific reactive hepatitis. more than 60% of infections are caused by a virus. cDNAs were synthesized from the extracted RNAs with the cDNA Synthesis Premix (Seegene Inc., Seoul, Korea) all samples were tested using the Anyplex II RV16 (Seegene Inc.) kit. patients were divided into those with increased levels of ALT or AST and those with normal levels. patients with increased ALT and AST levels were individually compared with those in the normal group. blood test results were compared in accordance with the type of respiratory virus. RT-PCR was run on CFX96 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) RT-PCR. the normal ranges for ALT and AST varied with patient sex and age. patients were hospitalized until their respiratory symptoms and fever improved. less than 63 IU/L for infants aged between 1 and 12 months, less than 60 IU/L for children aged between 1 and 3 years, less than 50 IU/L for children aged between 3 and 9 years, and less than 40 IU/L for children older than 9 years. patients divided into those with increased levels of ALT or AST and those with normal levels. blood test results were compared in accordance with the type of respiratory virus. AST level exceeded the normal range in 45 of the 532 patients. 71 patients (13.3%) had increased ALT or AST levels. the mean length of hospital stay of patients in the increased ALT or AST group was about 1 day longer than that of patients in the normal group. ALT: alanine aminotransferase, AST: aspartate aminotransferase. values are presented as number (%), meanstandard deviation, or number only. AST: alanine aminotransferase, AST: aspartate aminotransferase. there were 59 patients (11.1%) in the increased AST group. the mean AST level was 128.3143.3 IU/L. the rate of increase of AST level was 2.12.3. ALT: alanine aminotransferase, AST: aspartate aminotransferase, AST: aspartate aminotransferase, AST: aspartate aminotransferase, AST: aspartate aminotransferase, AST: aspartate aminotransferase, AST: aspartate aminotransferase, AST: aspartate aminotransferase, AST: aspartate aminotrans 71 patients (13.3%) had increased ALT or AST levels. the male to female ratio in increased ALT or AST groups was not significantly different from those in the normal group. the mean length of hospital stay was about 1 day longer than that of patients in the normal group. the mean ALT level was 136.9131.2 IU/L, and the rate of increase of ALT level was 3.12.9. there were significant differences in the proportion of segmented neutrophils. the lactate dehydrogenase level of these patients was 909812 IU/L. there were significant differences in the proportion of atypical lymphocytes and albumin levels between the groups. the differences were within the normal ranges. nonspecific reactive hepatitis is defined as a secondary hepatic injury induced by a non-hepatic disease without parenchymal liver damage. it is common for patients with a respiratory virus to lack clinical presentations while showing increased ALT or AST levels. the exact mechanism is unknown, but polakos et al. reported that collateral damage seems to induce the condition. the increase rate of AST level was 2.12.3. we presumed that ALT level increases by a greater degree than AST level during a respiratory virus infection. this is similar to the manifestations of acute hepatitis. adenovirus, influenza virus, and enterovirus are known to induce hyperbilirubinemia along with hepatitis. but only patients in the enterovirus infection group showed increased levels of bilirubin. the AST:ALT ratio is used as an indicator to determine the cause of liver disease based on the fact that AST increases in greater degrees than ALT. nonspecific reactive hepatitis was more common among patients with influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus infection. ALT was a better indicator of the severity of nonspecific reactive hepatitis."}
