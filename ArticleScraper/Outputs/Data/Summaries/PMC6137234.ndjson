{"summary": "the economic and social reforms aimed to transform the economic system from a socialist planned economy to a socialist market economy. in public health care, these reforms had far-reaching effects, reducing the financial contribution of the government, with the expectation that public hospitals would raise a growing portion of their operating revenue through user charges (3). medical practitioners were appointed by the government for a fixed term. they expected to return to clinical practice after completing their period in management. this was not the sole contributor to the under-performance of the study hospitals, as adverse health policy decisions were also found to have contributed. the Harbin training center for health services management was one of the first on-the-job training centers established by the Ministry of Health in the 1980s. the university has grown into a school delivering health management courses ranging from bachelor to masters and doctoral degrees. the government recognized the importance of high-quality education and identified transnational partnerships as a method to rapidly boost the capabilities of Chinese universities (11). the 2003 Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Chinese-Foreign Cooperation for Running Schools outline basic requirements. the program was designed with four educational components, comprising a Graduate Diploma, two Master degrees and health policy fora. the teaching and learning packages were distributed to enrolled students at the start of the courses. the students were encouraged to preview the materials and do small exercises before attending face-to-face classes. the block teaching model allowed them to try new strategies and instruments in their organizations. a 1-year full-time MHA (120 credit points) offered onshore at la Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia. it was expected that this onshore MHA would accommodate students who had completed training in China equivalent to the Graduate Certificate (60 credit points equivalence) or the GDHSM. the onshore Australian operations also enabled an expansion of La Trobe MHA partnerships in China beyond Harbin Medical University. the la Trobe CHP successfully organized several fora on health system reform in china. participants included the la trobe CHP alumni, hospital managers, community health managers, health officials, and health research academics from both countries. both countries face similar health policy challenges despite the differences between the two countries. students expressed a higher level of satisfaction for the CHP courses compared to the average of health courses at La Trobe University. the students were more likely to believe that the courses were useful to help them achieve the relevant aim and objectives. the la Trobe China Health Program has started showing long-term effects on students' participation in the health system reform in China. the theory, concept and applications of diagnostic related groups (DRGs) were introduced at the start of the MHA course in 2000/2001. more recently, a group of MHA students established a Chinese version of DRGs based on a doctoral research project on casemix classifications in acute hospital settings in China (20). the bilingual teaching capacity played a critical role in bridging gaps and potential mismatches between the western management theory and the Chinese context. the course adopted a co-teaching model involving monolingual teachers (English only or Chinese only) working closely with bilingual teachers (with Chinese as the native language) the bilingual teachers understood western management theory and practice, as well as the Chinese context, as well as the Chinese context. the LTU CHP staff engaged in research into the health care system in china. the research activities enabled staff to develop a better understanding of the Chinese health system. the achievements of the CHP have been widely recognized in both China and Australia. the recognition of these differences with incorporation in the curriculum was even more important than addressing different characteristics of the health care systems. the program was structured to ensure students were provided with the foundational information. students were challenged to discuss why a particular theory or principle may not work within the Chinese context. academic staff learned as much about the Chinese health system, Chinese cultures and values as the Chinese students and staff learned about western management practices. Developing a targeted culturally sensitive curriculum is made more difficult by the increasing economic pressures for the internationalization of Australian university programs. two universities shared academic and administrative resources in a complementary way. the two universities shared academic and administrative resources in a complementary way. the two universities shared a common goal in internationalization."}
