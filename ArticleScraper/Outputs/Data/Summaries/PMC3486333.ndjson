{"summary": "ebolaviruses have a single-stranded RNA genome that encodes seven structural and two nonstructural proteins (44) the genome is encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (NP) and forms ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) within virus particles, RNPs are found in the form of condensed nucleocapsids. inclusion bodies can be detected by light microscopy (2, 32, 43), fluorescence microscopy (28), and electron microscopy (2, 12, 13, 32, 33, 43) inclusion bodies contain nucleocapsids or nucleocapsid-like structures (12, 33, 35, 43, 46) inclusions are often regarded as a cellular mechanism to dispose of large quantities of misfolded proteins. virus infection, are the site of viral RNA synthesis (26) similar findings were also reported for another rhabdovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus (18). to this end, we generated a recombinant ZEBOV that expresses a fluorescently tagged polymerase. recombinant viruses were based on ZEBOV (strain Mayinga; accession number AF272001). all work with viruses was performed in the BSL-4 laboratories at the Philipps Universit\u00e4t Marburg, Germany. expression plasmids for the minigenome and viral proteins have been previously described. western blotting was performed as previously described 48 h after transfection. cells were visualized on an inverted Axiovert 200 M microscope. a minigenome assay 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids carrying NP, VP35, VP30, and L. expression plasmids for VP40, VP24, and GP were cotransfected. this led to the formation of trVLPs, which contained minigenomes in form of RNP complexes. supernatant from these cells was clarified and stocks were frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA from these stocks was isolated, and the entire genome was sequenced to ensure there were no unwanted mutations. cells were seeded in 6-well plates or 4-well labtek-II chamber slides 1 day before infection. fluor 488 (Life Technologies) conjugate at a dilution of 1:1,000 was used. staining of the endoplasmic reticulum was performed as previously described (41) using the 1D3 anti-protein disulfide isomerase antibody. confocal images were imported into ImageJ 1.44p (1) at a resolution of 2,048 by 2,048 pixels. images were enhanced using a mean-type fast filter and standard settings. a threshold was applied to the images to isolate the inclusion bodies. RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR. all drugs were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and DMSO alone was used as a control in all experiments involving drug treatment. nascent RNA staining was performed using the Click-iT nascent RNA detection kit (Life Technologies) at 17.5 h postinfection, the medium was replaced with 400 l medium containing actinomycin D. 93T (human embryonic kidney) and Huh-7 (human hepatoma) cells were maintained in modified Eagle medium. cells were cultivated in leibovitz's medium without phenol red (Life Technologies) with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin, 20% FBS, and 400 M 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox; Sigma) the full-length clone plasmid encoding the cRNA for a recombinant ZEBOV (pAmp-rgZ-SXBS-L-mCherry) containing L-mCherry instead of L was generated by subcloning the relevant portion of the L-mCherry expression plasmid into pAmp-rgZ-SXBS via unique restriction sites within L (HpaI and PacI) western blotting was performed as previously described (19) 48 h after transfection. trVLPs were used to infect naive vero E6 target cells. luciferase activity reflecting viral minigenome replication and transcription was measured. 50% confluent Vero E6 cells were transfected using transit LT1 per g of DNA and the following plasmids. at 24 h posttransfection, the medium was exchanged, and after 7 days the supernatant was transferred onto fresh Vero E6 cells. RNA from these stocks was isolated and the entire genome was sequenced to ensure there were no unwanted mutations. confocal microscopy, immunofluorescence analysis, and live-cell imaging of infected cells. at indicated times, cells were fixed in 10% formalin for 24 h. at the indicated times, cells were fixed in 10% formalin for 24 h. cells were removed from the BSL-4 laboratory following approved standard operating procedures. cells were seeded into 35-mm u-dishes (Ibidi) 24 h prior to infection. cells were infected in 400 l Opti-MEM without phenol red (Life Technologies) for 1 h. after which the inoculum was removed and 500 l Leibovitz's medium was added. confocal images were imported into ImageJ 1.44p (1) at a resolution of 2,048 by 2,048 pixels. quantitative RT-PCR directed against -actin mRNA was performed. the relative copy number of target RNA was calculated from the change in threshold cycle (CT) value between -actin mRNA and target RNA. cells were fixed in 10% formalin for 15 min, washed once with PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, washed again with PBS, and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-azide. after that, the fixative was replaced with fresh 10% formalin. cells were removed from the laboratory following standard operating procedures and imaged by confocal microscopy. fluorescence analysis of 293T cells expressing L-mCherry. cells were visualized 18 h posttransfection. showed are phase-contrast, mCherry signal, and a merged image. at 48 h posttransfection, cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with an antibody against mCherry. compared the ability of L-mCherry to perform viral genome replication and transcription in a minigenome assay. at 72 h posttransfection, naive vero E6 target cells were infected with trVLP-containing supernatants. reporter activity in target cells reflects viral genome replication and production of trVLPs containing RNP complexes including L-mCherry. reporter activity in target cells reflects the production of trVLPs in the producer cells. rgZEBOV-L-mCherry is incorporated into trVLPs and supports primary transcription in target cells. the recombinant virus showed similar growth kinetics and endpoint titers as a wild-type ZEBOV that was rescued in parallel. large inclusion bodies with a cross-sectional area of more than 10 m2 appeared at about 12 to 14 h postinfection. inclusion bodies filled the majority of the cytoplasm with cross-sectional areas of greater than 100 m2. infected cells initially had small inclusions identical to those observed by confocal microscopy, while at later times larger inclusions were observed. cells were infected with rg-ZEBOV-L-mCherry. at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 h postinfection, cells were fixed, removed from the laboratory and counterstained with DAPI. inclusion body morphology is directly influenced by the cytoskeletal rearrangements taking place during cell division. we investigated the distribution of VP35, which has been described to be a component of viral inclusion bodies and to interact with L (5, 14), in infected cells. rgZEBOV-L-mCherry and RNA were harvested from these cells every 1 to 4 h for 24 h. viral mRNA was quantified using a two-step RT-PCR. for quantification of viral genome replication, a two-step RT-PCR was performed using a genome-specific primer for the RT step, followed by qPCR. vero E6 cells were infected with rg-ZEBOV-L-mCherry. 17.5 h postinfection cellular transcription was shut down by adding actinomycin D to the medium. after 1 h, cells were fixed, and ethynyl-uridine was stained using a highly specific alkyl-azide reaction. ethynyl-uridine (EU) was added to the cells at 18 h postinfection. at 18 h postinfection, actinomycin (ActD) was added to the medium for 1 h. cells were fixed, permeabilized, and the EU incorporated into nascent RNAs was detected using Alexa Fluor 488-azide. cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. at 48 h posttransfection, cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. L-mCherry could only be detected when VP35 was cotransfected. we compared the ability of L-mCherry to perform viral genome replication and transcription in a minigenome assay. 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids for all viral RNP proteins and a T7-driven expression vector for a ZEBOV minigenome encoding firefly luciferase. however, reporter activity in cells transfected with L-mCherry was somewhat reduced compared to cells transfected with wild-type L reporter activity in target cells reflects viral genome replication and production of trVLPs containing RNP complexes including L-mCherry. trVLPs contain both the viral glycoprotein GP and nucleocapsids containing a minigenome. reporter activity in target cells reflects not only replication of the minigenomes in the producer cells but also formation of trVLPs. rgZEBOV-L-mCherry is incorporated into trVLPs and supports primary transcription. the recombinant virus showed similar growth kinetics and endpoint titers. rgZEBOV-L-mCherry is not attenuated compared to wild-type L. infected cells initially had small inclusions identical to those observed by confocal microscopy, while at later time points (about 14 to 18 h postinfection) larger inclusions were observed in the cytoplasm of the cells, either in larger inclusions or in small dot-like structures. cells were infected with rg-ZEBOV-L-mCherry. at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 h postinfection, cells were fixed, removed from the BSL-4 laboratory, counterstained with DAPI. inclusion bodies have been described to be a component of viral inclusion bodies. a subset of VP35-positive inclusions did not contain L-mCherry. formation of larger inclusion bodies coincides with viral genome replication. mRNA was quantified using a two-step RT-PCR. we first reverse transcribing RNA using an oligo(dT) primer. vRNA was reverse transcribed using an oligo(dT) primer. qPCR followed by quantitative real-time PCR. cellular transcription was shut down by adding actinomycin D to the medium. at 18 h postinfection, cells were fed ethynyl-uridine, which is incorporated into nascent RNA. after 1 h, cells were fixed, and ethynyl-uridine was stained using a highly specific alkyl-azide reaction. recombinant ZEBOV expressing a fluorescently tagged polymerase allowed detailed studies of inclusion body formation and function. we chose to tag the polymerase L with mCherry because for the closely related REBOV it had been shown that a hemagglutinin (HA) tag could be inserted into a putative flexible linker region in the protein without loss of activity. luciferase reporter could lose activity by increasing the amount of transfected L-mCherry. this may be due to protein expression or stability rather than an actual loss of polymerase activity. the availability of a fluorescently tagged L that can be detected by fluorescence analysis and Western blotting is of particular significance. rgZEBOV-L-mCherry virus did not show attenuation in vero E6 cells. the recombinant measles virus expressing L-GFP showed a reduction in titer of about 2 to 4 logs at all times (9). the recombinant measles virus showed a reduction in titer of about 2 to 4 logs at all times (9) the first appearance of inclusion bodies in ZEBOV-infected cells after 9 h (40) is much later than inclusion body formation for VSV and rabies virus. rabies virus most cells show only two or three distinct inclusion bodies early in infection, which grow in size, and only later in infection do many smaller inclusions appear. the matrix protein VP40 has been shown to be recruited to inclusion bodies (19) and to be required for the transport of nucleocapsids to the cell surface (36), interacts with microtubules (42) this makes it tempting to speculate that the small dot-like structures apparent late in infection represent nucleocapsids en route to budding sites. evidence for a functional involvement of inclusion bodies in the ebolavirus life cycle has so far been lacking. inclusion bodies were positive for RNA synthesis, coincided with the onset of viral genome replication. a redirection of viral transcription toward inclusions, as seen with VSV, cannot be absolutely excluded at this point. for the closely related marburg virus, ultrastructural studies have described different types of inclusion bodies. inclusion bodies shed highly motile small dot-like structures as infection progresses. inclusion bodies are important structures for the virus life cycle."}
