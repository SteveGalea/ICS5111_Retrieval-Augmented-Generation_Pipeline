{"summary": "in-country CDC staff from the Influenza Division and the Division of Global HIV/AIDS assumed leadership roles. the team was augmented from CDC headquarters, including experts from seven other divisions. a precise activity plan was developed, detailing resources for staffing, technical support, and procurement of supplies and equipment. rRT-PCR assay for enterovirus 71 (EV71) detection. multiplex PCR for detection of seven respiratory pathogens. rRT-PCR was used in new testing platforms using rRT-PCR. the 2-day emergency operations drill included participation and coordination by multiple MoH groups, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, and international partners. a notable outcome was the creation and review of an Incident Action Plan. enhancements to GHS were made within a short period, allowing for accurate and timely testing. CDC and MoH engaged in a substantive dialog about a broader set of pathogens for early detection and rapid response. the emergency operations drill and training built MoH capacity to design and run their own exercises. challenges identified by MoH included limited resources (staffing, infrastructure, funding, and reagents) for GHS activities. orial approach to capacity building for public health emergencies could serve as a model for similar collaborations elsewhere. enhancements to GHS were made within a short period, allowing for accurate and timely testing of emerging pathogens and increased ability to manage a public health emergency through an EOC. application of technology in disease surveillance reduces time for data collection, reporting, analysis, and sharing, thereby enhancing early detection and rapid response to diseases and outbreaks. installation of and training on new testing platforms allowed for harmonization of protocols for selected pathogens across the regional institutes\u2019 laboratories."}
