{"summary": "a novel protein was named TRAF7 [4], but the protein does not have the TRAF homology domain that defines the TRAF family. the distinctive feature of all TRAF proteins is a C-terminal TRAF domain, which is composed of an N-terminal coiled-coil region (TRAF-N) and a C-terminal -sandwich (TRAF-C) TRAFs function as adaptor proteins and ubiquitin ligases to regulate signaling. Symbols for different domains are shown, including zinc RING (Zn RING), zinc fingers (Zn Fingers), coiled-coil (TRAF-N) domain, TRAF-C domain, nuclear localization signals. alterations in TRAFs may contribute to pathogenesis of important human diseases, including cancers, autoimmune diseases and immunodeficiencies. this has sparked new appreciation and interest in TRAF research during the past few years. signaling by death receptors mainly relies on adaptor proteins containing a death domain, such as TRADD or FADD. signaling by the TIM-containing receptors is mediated primarily, albeit not exclusively, via TRAFs [3,24,26] signaling by the TIM-containing receptors is mediated primarily, albeit not exclusively, via TRAFs. the distinct TWEAK/Fn14 paradigm is covered in detail in a recent review by Silke and Brink [32]. TRAFs directly and indirectly employed by the TNF-R superfamily Receptors TRAFs References Receptors containing TRAF-interacting motifs TNF-R2 TRAF2 [26,34] TRAF1, 3 via TRAF2 [27,28,35] TRAF1 via TRAF2 [28] BCMA TRAF1, 2, 3, 5, 6 2 via TRADD [63] DR6 TRAF2 via TRADD [63] TRAIL-R1 TRAF2 via RIP1 [67] Using CD40 and BAFF-R as examples, I briefly summarize recent advances in understanding how TRAFs regulate the two NF-B pathways and activation of MAPKs. in the absence of stimulation, TRAF3 constitutively binds to NIK (the upstream kinase of the NF-B2 pathway) and ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF2 and TRAF6 is rapidly stimulated [27,72,75] these proteins form several separate multiprotein signaling complexes, which result in the phosphorylation and activation of MEKK1 and TAK1. Activated MEKK1 and TAK1 are released from the receptor into the cytoplasm to activate MAPKs and NF-B1, which eventually mediate the effector functions of CD40 [35,72] TRAFs in TLR signaling Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize conserved structures termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of diverse invading microbes. they also detect endogenous molecules released from damaged or inflamed self-tissues. TLR signaling induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. each TLR consists of an ectodomain containing leucine-rich repeats (LRR) that mediate sensing of PAMPs or DAMPs, and a cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1 receptor domain that mediates downstream signal transduction. oligomerization or oligomerization recruits TIR domain-containing adaptor proteins through TIR-TIR interactions, including MyD88, TRIF, Mal and TRAM. ubiquitinated TRAF6 serves as a signaling scaffold to recruit TAK1 via TAB2/3. TRAF6-generated free K63-polyubiquitin chains also bind to TAB2/3 to activate TAK1 and bind to NEMO to activate IKK/ in the receptor complex. the release of the TAK1 signaling complex from TLR4 is inhibited by TRAF3. TRAF6 is also necessary for type I IFN production induced by TLR7 and TLR9 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells. TLR3 recruits TRAF3 and TRAF6 via TRIF, while TLR7 and TLR9 recruit TRAF3 and TRAF6 via myD88-IRAK1. TRAF3 mediates MyD88- and TRIF-induced activation of IRF3 and IRF7. in TRIF-dependent signaling downstream of TLR3 and TLR4, TRAF3 recruits TBK1 and IKK through NAP1 and TANK. TRAF3 catalyzes K63-polyubiquitination of TRAF3 itself, TBK1 and IKK. phosphorylated IRF3 and IRF7 induce expression of type I IFNs. effects of NLRs include secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, anti-microbial peptides and type I IFNs, generation of ROS, autophagy, antigen processing, and expression of MHC class II on antigen presenting cells. these responses induce innate immune clearance of the pathogen, and tailor the adaptive immune system to fight the infection. TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 are required for NF-B and MAPK activation induced by NOD1 and NOD2. oligomerization of NOD1 or NOD2 recruits the dual specificity kinase RIP2 (also called RICK) via a homotypic CARD-CARD interactions. TRAF2 and TRAF5 are required for NOD-induced NF-B activation. TRAF6, CARD9, and ITCH are important for p38 and JNK activation in NOD signaling. the exact mechanism of how these occur is still unknown. AP, oligomerization of NOD1 recruits TRAF3 via RIP2. TRAF3 activates TBK1 and IKK, leading to type I IFN production in epithelial cells. NOD2 induces type I IFN production only in response to viral ssRNA. RIG-I/MDA5 signaling rapidly elicits the production of type I and type III IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines. LGP2 facilitates or antagonizes recognition of viral RNA by MDA5 and RIG-I. INTBAD, TBK1-IKK, NEMO, IKK/IKK, TAB2/3-TAB1-TAK1, MEKK1, Bcl10, and RIP1-FADD-Casp8-Casp10 signaling cascades culminate in the phosphorylation and activation of IRF3, IRF7, NF-B and AP-1. TRAF3 mediates RIG-I-induced IRF3 but not a recent study shows that linear ubiquitination of NEMO switches it from a positive to a negative regulator of RIG-I signaling. NEMO-like adaptor proteins TANK, NAP1 and SINTBAD are constitutively bound to both TBK1 and IKK. autoubiquitinated TRAF3 activates TBK1 and IKK to induce the phosphorylation, dimerization and nuclear translocation of IRF3. activation of IRF7 after viral infection resembles IRF3 activation. activation of IRF7 but not IRF3 is impaired in TRAF6/ fibroblasts. TRAF6 and MEKK1 are also important for ubiquitination of NF-B and MAPKs. IL-17 is the defining cytokine of a new T helper cell population called \u201cTh17\u201d. IL-17 signals through a heteromeric receptor complex formed by IL-17RA and IL-17RC. IL-17Rs have two extracellular fibronectin III-like domains. Act1 is a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase that contains both a SEFIR domain and TIMs. Act1 catalyzes K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF6, which mediates the ubiquitination of IL-17RA and induces the activation of NF-B through TAK1 and IKKs. Activated NF-B further induces the expression of IkB, C/EBP and C/E TRAF3 and TRAF4 inhibit IL-17 signaling by recruiting SF2 and inducing activation of MAPKs. TRAF3 interacts with IL-17RA and IL-17RC and thus interferes with the recruitment of Act1 by IL-17Rs. TRAF4 exerts its negative regulation on IL-17 signaling by competing with TRAF6 for the interaction with Act1. both TRAF3 and TRAF4 restrict IL-17 signaling at receptor proximal steps. if other TRAFs contribute to the regulation of IFN signaling remains to be determined. TRAF6 mediates K63-linked polyubiquitylation of TAK1 at Lys34 and Lys158. results in subsequent activation of p38 and p38 in response to TGF. however, in cancer cells, TRAF6-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRI also promotes cleavage of TRI by TNF converting enzyme (TACE) in a PKC-dependent manner. IL-2 receptor The binding of TRAF6 to the TIM of the IL-2R -chain negatively regulates IL-2-induced Jak1 activation in CD4 T cells. TRAF1 inhibits CD3-induced NF-B2 activation and proliferation in T cells. DNA damage response TRAF6 is essential for DNA damage-induced NF-B activation. ATM translocates in a calcium-dependent manner to cytosol and membrane fractions. ATM-TRAF6-cIAP1 module stimulates TAB2-dependent TAK1 phosphorylation. cIAP1 catalyzes monoubiquitination of NEMO at Lys285. potential involvement of other TRAFs in this response awaits further investigation. a recent study has shown that TRAF2 becomes a highly active K63-specific ubiquitin ligase when bound to sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), which appears to be a cofactor for TRAF2 E3 ligase activity. this suggests that addition of S1P may improve the efficiency of in vitro ubiquitination assays for TRAF2. TRI TRAF6 TGF [65] Kinases TAK1 (Lys158) TRAF6, TRAF2 TNF-R1/2 and IL-1R [187] RIP1 (Lys377) TRAF2 TNF-R1 and IL-1R [179,180] TBK1 TRAF3 TLR3, TLR4 [17,23,81] IRAK1 (Lys134 and 180) TRAF6 TLR7, TLR9, IL autophagy proteins beclin 1 (Lys117) TRAF6 TLR4-, IL-1R-induced autophagy [199] NDP52 TRAF6 TLR3-induced autophagy [199] Regulators of ROS production ECSIT TRAF6 TLR1, 2, 4-induced ROS production [93] TRAFs are substrates of other E3 ligases that catalyze K63-linked or K48-linked polyubiquitination of TRAFs. the known deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) of TRAFs include: (1) ubiquitin-specific proteases, such as CYLD, USP2a, USP4, USP20 and USP20. CYLD, a tumor suppressor and a target gene of NF-B, negatively regulates NF-B and JNK activation. DUBA specifically targets and de-conjugates the K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from TRAF3. DUBA does not affect NF-B2 activation, which is entirely dependent on K48-linked degradative ubiquitination of TRAF3. negative regulation of TRAF signaling is necessary to prevent harmful immune responses and inflammatory diseases. CYLD/ and Usp25/ mice develop severe inflammatory syndrome [219,220]. phosphorylation of TRAF1 (at Ser 139 in mouse and ser 146 in human by PKN1) inhibits TNF-R2-dependent tonic NF-B and JNK signaling in HeLa cells. phosphorylation of TRAF2 (at Ser11 and Ser55 by PKC or IKK) negatively regulates NOD2 signaling in macrophages. immune receptors (such as TLRs, NLRs, RLRs, and cytokine receptors) and adaptive immune receptors (such as CD40, BAFF-R, OX40, 4-1BB, and TCR) some viral and bacterial proteins can function as DUBs to deubiquitinate TRAFs and thus inhibit type I IFN production. 2 and TRAF3 into the Fas death inducing signaling complex to modulate Fas signaling, and powerfully inhibits both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell death induced by Fas [250] some viruses up-regulate miR-32 and miR-146a, which directly target the protein expression of TRAF3 and TRAF6, respectively [251-253]. p TRAFs for viral signaling LMP1 of Epstein-Barr virus TRAF1, 2, 3, 5, 6 to mimic constitutively activated CD40 signaling BRRF1 lytic gene product (Na) of Epstein-Barr virus TRAF2 Utilizes TRAF2 for JNK activation and lytic gene [254] expression v-FLIP of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma herpesvirus (human herpesvirus 8) TRAF6 Activates T mice deficient in TRAF1, 4 or 5 exhibit distinct phenotypes. TRAF4/ mice suffer respiratory disorder and wheezing caused by tracheal ring disruption. the early lethality of TRAF3/ mice is rescued by compound loss of NF-B2 gene. hypersensitive to TNF-induced necrosis [173] Hyperproliferation in response to T cell receptor signaling [266] Lack of 4-1BB-mediated survival responses in CD8 and memory T cells [78,79,171] Required for 4-1BB-induced NF-B1 activation [31] TRAF2 TRAF2/ Germline Progressively runted and die within 3 weeks after birth [267] rely impaired hyperglycemic response to glucagon [268] TRAF3flox/flox, CD19-Cre B cell-specific Prolonged B cell survival independent of BAFF [36,270] Splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy [36,270] Autoimmune manifestations and hyperimmunoglobulinemia [270] Increased T-independent antibody responses [270] Development of B1 lymphomas and splenic marginal zone lymphomas [ Degeneration of high number of Purkinje cells [260] Increased rates of pulmonary inflammation [260] Increased rates of pulmonary inflammation [260] Increased migration of DCs [273] Inhibits IL-17 signaling and Th17-mediated autoimmune encephalomyelitis [273] Mild defect in T-dependent antibody responses [274] Defective in Th1/Th2 differentiation [275] TRAF6 TRAF6/ Germline Perinatal and postnatal leth B lymphocytes TRAF2, 3, 5 and 6 are important in the survival, development, and activation of B cells. in the absence of either TRAF2 or TRAF3, B cells exhibit remarkably prolonged survival independent of BAFF. this is further corroborated by evidence that deletion of cIAP1 and cIAP2 also renders BAFF-independent survival of B cells in mice due to constitutive NF-B2 activation. the survival pathways normally activated by physiologic triggering of BAFF-R by BAFF-R are constitutively activated when the expression of TRAF2, TRAF3 or cIAP1/cIAP2 is absent from B cells [74] Interestingly, TRAF3/ B cells also display enhanced activation in response to signaling by TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, or TLR9 [272]. reduced number of mature B cells in the bone marrow and spleen, and impaired T-dependent and T-independent antibody responses. TRAF1/ T cells exhibit hyperproliferation and increased production of Th2 cytokines in response to TCR signaling. defective 4-1BB-mediated survival responses in effector and memory CD8 T cells. TRAF6/ CD4 T cells display increased Th17 differentiation. increased sensitivity to TGF-induced Smad2/3 activation and IL-2 down-regulation. TRAF1-/- DCs matured in CD154 display impaired NF-B activation and survival. hepatic cell TRAF2 promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis and contributes to hyperglycemia in obesity. skeletal muscle-specific depletion of TRAF6 in mice improves activation and skeletal muscle regeneration through up-regulation of Notch signaling. missiou et al. reported that TRAF1 deficiency attenuates atherosclerosis in LDLR/ mice. deletion of TRAF1 inhibits adhesion of inflammatory cells to the endothelium. available evidence implicates TRAFs in pathogenesis of cancers, autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiencies, and neurodegenerative diseases. available evidence implicates TRAFs in pathogenesis of cancers, autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiencies, and neurodegenerative diseases. deletions and mutations of TRAF3 and TRAF2 have been reported in multiple myeloma [294-296] and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [298,299]. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TRAF3 are also associated with altered risk of multiple myeloma [297]. TRAF4 is overexpressed in breast and lung carcinomas. increased TRAF4 gene copy number is one major mechanism responsible for TRAF4 protein overexpression in human cancers. TRAF4 is located at chromosome 17q11.2 in a region of amplification. lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are associated with both SLE and RA. a single SNP (rs7514863), mapping upstream of the TRAF5 gene and affecting a putative transcription factor binding site, demonstrates a significant association with RA. mutant TRAF6 protein acts in a dominant-negative manner to affect NF-B activation during the development of ectoderm-derived organs, leading to HED phenotype. recent evidence implicates the E3 ligase activity of TRAF6 in the pathogenic aggregation of mutant proteins in neurodegenerative diseases. more direct evidence was provided by a recent study demonstrating that TRAF1 is specifically lost from virus-specific CD8 T cells during the chronic phase of infection with HIV in humans [171]. a study demonstrating that TRAF1 is specifically lost from virus-specific CD8 T cells during the chronic phase of infection with HIV in humans. receptors are mediated primarily, though not exclusively, via TRAFs. these include TRAFs that can interact with the receptors either directly through TIMs or indirectly through other TRAFs or adaptor proteins. TRAF2 and TRAF5 can also modulate signaling by death receptors through association with TRADD, FADD or RIP1. TRAF1 via TRAF2 [28] BAFF-R TRAF3, 6 [36-38] TRAF2 via TRAF3 [28] BCMA TRAF1, 2, 3, 5, 6 [2,28,41] LTR TRAF2, 3, 5 [29,42-47] CD27 TRAF2, 3, 5 [1,48,49] CD30 TRAF1, 2, 3, 5 [1,2] 4-1BB TRAF1, 2, 3, 5, 6 [1,2,50-52] HVEM TRAF1, 2, 3, 5, NIK protein is accumulated in the cytoplasm, induces the activation of IKK and NF-B2 and eventually up-regulates the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family. many other signaling proteins (including TRAF5, TRAF6, TRAF1, Ubc13, MEKK1, TAK1 and NEMO) are also recruited to the cytoplasm of the receptor. a signaling pathway of c-Raf-MEK-ERK-ERK-dependent phosphorylation and down-regulation of Bim also contributes to B cell survival. c-Raf-MEK-ERK-dependent phosphorylation and down-regulation of Bim contributes to B cell survival. d pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) detect endogenous molecules released from damaged or inflamed self-tissues. they also detect endogenous molecules released from damaged or inflamed self-tissues. TLR signaling induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. these provoke acute inflammatory responses as well as phagocytosis and autophagy. TRIF is only used by TLR3 and endocytosed TLR4. TRAM acts as a bridging adaptor between TRIF and TLR4. both pathways initiate complex signaling cascades of phosphorylation and ubiquitination events. TAB2/3-TAB1-TAK1 is dissociated from the receptor and released into the cytosol. TAK1 activates MAPK cascades, leading to activation of AP-1. TRAF6 catalyzes K63-linked polyubiquitination of cIAP1/2, which is also recruited by myD88 and IRAK1. internalized TLR4 recruits TRAF3 and TRAF6 via myD88-IRAK1. TRAF3 mediates MyD88- and TRIF-induced activation of NF-B1 and MAPKs. TRAF1 inhibits TRIF signaling. mers or heterodimers translocate into the nucleus and induce the expression of type I IFNs as well as IFN-inducible gene. TRAF1 inhibits TRIF- and TLR3-mediated activation of NF-B and expression of IFN-, suggesting that TRAF1 inhibits TRIF-dependent signaling [83,97,98] caspase recruitment domains (CARD), pyrin domains (PYD), baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis repeat (BIR) domains. an acidic transactivation domain recruit downstream signal transduction molecules after ligand sensing. the role of TRAF2 in inflammasome signaling has recently been explored. oligomerization of NOD1 or NOD2 recruits the dual specificity kinase RIP2 via a homotypic CARD-CARD interactions. cIAP1/2 catalyzes K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIP2, which further recruits TAB2/3-TAB1-TAK1 and NEMO-IKK/, leading to NF-B activation. NOD1 recruits TRAF2, TRAF5, TRAF6 and TRAF3 via RIP2. NOD2 mediates NOD1-induced activation of NF-B1 and MAPKs. TRAF3 induces type I IFN production through distinct mechanisms. TRAF3 and TRAF6 are involved in the cross-talk between several NLRs and TLRs or RLRs. NLRP12 regulates suppression of TLR-driven NF-B activation. NLRC3 also inhibits NF-B activation by interacting with TRAF6. RIG-I/MDA5 signaling cascades culminate in the phosphorylation and activation of IRF3, IRF7, NF-B and AP-1, which work cooperatively to induce the expression of IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines. TRAF3 mediates RIG-I-induced IRF3 but not NF-B1 activation. both TRAF2 and TRAF5 also contribute to activation of NF-B1 and NF-B1 in RIG-I signaling. autoubiquitinated TRAF3 activates TBK1 and IKK to induce the phosphorylation, dimerization and nuclear translocation of IRF3. depletion of either TRAF2 or TRAF5 leads to reduced IRF3 and NF-B activation upon RIG-I stimulation. p38 activation proceeds via a TRAF2-TAK1-dependent pathway. the kinetics of these two types of ubiquitination on TRAF3 and TRAF6 is still unclear. viruses also induce IRF3-dependent apoptosis in infected cells. apoptosis is triggered by direct interaction of IRF3 and Bax. IL-17 receptors are important in host defense against bacterial, fungal and helminthic parasite infections. the founding member of this family, IL-17, is the defining cytokine of a new T helper cell population called \u201cTh17\u201d. IL-17 receptors are important in host defense against bacterial, fungal and helminthic parasite infections. IL-17RA induces the activation of NF-B through TAK1 and IKKs. Activated NF-B further induces the expression of IkB, C/EBP and C/EBP. TRAF6 also induces GSK3 activation likely through PI-3K, and ERK1/2 activation likely through Raf1 [12,151,159]. factor SF2 (also known as alternative splicing factor, ASF) into the IL-17R-Act1 signaling complex. formation requires an inducible IKK that mediates Act1 phosphorylation at Ser311, adjacent to a putative TRAF-binding motif. TRAF3 and TRAF4 are negative regulators of IL-17R signaling. TRAF2 and TRAF6 are recognized as direct signal transducers of IFN receptors. direct interaction of TRAF6 with IFNR1 regulates NF-B activation and IFNR1 stability in response to type III IFNs. TRI by TNF converting enzyme (TACE) in a PKC-dependent manner. TRAF6 mediates the suppressive effect of IL-1 or LPS on TGF-induced signaling through interaction with the type III TGF- receptor (TRIII) IL-7 restores TRAF1 levels in T cells. IL-17 signals through a heteromeric receptor complex formed by IL-17RA and IL-17RC. IL-17Rs have two extracellular fibronectin III-like domains and a cytoplasmic SEF/IL-17R (SEFIR) domain. Act1 is a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase that contains both a SEFIR domain and TIMs. heteromeric IL-17RA and IL-17RC recruit TRAF6, TRAF2 and TRAF5 via Act1. TRAF6 mediates IL-17-induced activation of NF-B1, IkB, C/EBP and C/EBP. TRAF3 and TRAF4 inhibit IL-17 signaling. the binding of TRAF3 to IL-17Rs interferes with the formation of the activation signaling complex of IL-17R-Act1-TRAF6. TRAF4 exerts its negative regulation on IL-17 signaling by competing with TRAF6 for the interaction with Act1 as TRAF4 and TRAF6 use the same TIMs on Act1. cytokine TGF binds to type II and type I serine/threonine kinase receptors. TRI-TRAF6 interaction induces auto-ubiquitination of TRAF6. TRAF6 regulates activation of TAK1 in a receptor kinase-independent manner. TRAF6 plays multiple roles in signaling by TGF receptors. TGF also induces posttranslational loss of TRAF1, whereas IL-7 restores TRAF1 levels in T cells. no evidence is available about the participation of other TRAFs in TGF signaling. TRAF6 is required for NF-B and JNK activation, and expression of proinflammatory cytokines in response to engagement of C-type lectin receptors during fungal infection [177]. this will elicit further studies of other TRAFs in signaling by C-type lectin receptors. TRAF6 is recruited to the TCR signaling rafts containing CARMA1-MALT1-Bcl10-PKC-IKK-Caspase 8 via interaction with the paracaspase MALT1. this contributes to the induction of NF-B activation and IL-2 production in T cells [174,175]. phosphorylation and cIAP1 catalyze monoubiquitination of NEMO at Lys285. potential involvement of other TRAFs in this response awaits further investigation. potential involvement of other TRAFs in this response awaits further investigation. phenotype of the RING TRAF2 mutant suggests that TRAF2 may not function as an E3 ligase at all. controversy about whether TRAF2 is actually a RING E3 ligase is described in detail in an excellent review by Silke [183] Adaptor proteins NEMO (Lys285, 321, 325, 326 and 399) TRAF6 TLRs, IL-1R, NOD2 [17,23,82,111,192] TRIF TRAF2, TRAF6 TLR3, TLR4 [98] NESCA TRAF6 TrkA and p75 [193] LAT (Lys88) TRAF6 TCR [176] Other E3 ligases cIAP1/2 TRAF 1-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6 recruits TAB2/3-TAK1 and NEMO to activate NF-B in IL-17R signaling. cIAP1/2-catalyzed K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3 recruits TBK1 and IKK to activate NF-B in IL-17R signaling. cIAP1/2-catalyzed K63-linked ubiquitination of the known deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) of TRAFs include: (1) ubiquitin-specific proteases, such as CYLD, USP2a, USP4, USP20 and USP25. CYLD, a tumor suppressor and a target gene of NF-B, negatively regulates NF-B and JNK activation. TBK1-IKK dissociation from TRAF3 and inhibition of type I IFN production induced by TLRs and RLRs.

T cells display neither prolonged survival (as that observed in B cells) nor hyperproliferation (as that observed in TRAF1/ T cells), despite constitutive processing and activation of NF-B2. the TRAF2-NIK-NFB2 pathway does drive the development of fatal autoimmune inflammatory disorder in TRAF2/TNF/ mice. TRAF1-/- DCs matured in CD154 display impaired NF-B activation and survival. but increased TRAF2 degradation in response to CD154 re-stimulation. hepatic cell TRAF2 autonomously promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis. skeletal muscle-specific depletion of TRAF6 in mice improves activation. deletion of TRAF6 inhibits induction of atrophy program in response to starvation, denervation, or cancer cachexia. ablation of TRAF6 also improves phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO3a. endothelial and myeloid cell TRAF6 deficiency inhibits atherosclerosis by reducing proinflammatory gene expression and monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. in contrast, myeloid cell-specific TRAF6 deletion exacerbates atherosclerosis. the survival and maturation pathways normally activated by physiologic triggering of BAFF-R by BAFF-R are constitutively activated when the expression of TRAF2, TRAF3, or cIAP1/cIAP2 is absent from B cells [74]. Interestingly, TRAF3/ B cells also display enhanced activation in response to signaling by TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, or TLR9 [272]. TRAF6 ablation results in defects in generation of CD5+ B1 cells. reduced number of mature B cells in the bone marrow and spleen. impaired T-dependent and T-independent antibody responses. TRAF6/ CD4 T cells exhibit hyperactivation of the PI3K-Akt pathway, resistance to suppression by Treg cells, and also resistance to anergizing signals. activated TRAF6/ CD8 T cells exhibit defective AMP-activated kinase activation and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. hepatocyte-specific TRAF2/ mice exhibit significantly decreased blood glucose levels under high-fat diet conditions. these mice show normal insulin signaling and the hypoglycemic response to insulin, but they have severely impaired glucagon signaling and hyperglycemic response to insulin. hepatic cell TRAF2 autonomously promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis, and contributes to hyperglycemia in obesity. missiou et al. reported that TRAF1 deficiency attenuates atherosclerosis in mice. deletion of TRAF1 inhibits adhesion of inflammatory cells to the endothelium. deletion of TRAF5 in endothelial cells or in leukocytes enhances adhesion of inflammatory cells to the endothelium. the roles of TRAFs in human diseases are just beginning to be revealed. available evidence implicates TRAFs in the pathogenesis of cancers, autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiencies, and neurodegenerative diseases. deletions and mutations of TRAF3 and TRAF2 have been reported in multiple myeloma [294-296] and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [302]. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TRAF3 are also associated with multiple myeloma [297]. overexpression and gene amplification of TRAF4 and TRAF6 have been reported in human carcinomas. TRAF4 is overexpressed in breast and lung carcinomas. increased TRAF4 gene copy number is one major mechanism responsible for TRAF4 protein overexpression in human cancers. polymorphisms (SNPs) in TRAFs have been linked to autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). a single SNP (rs7514863) demonstrates a significant association with RA. XEDAR suppresses the XEDAR-mediated NF-B activation during the development of ectoderm-derived organs, leading to HED phenotype. recent evidence implicates the E3 ligase activity of TRAF6 in the pathogenic aggregation of mutant proteins in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease and Huntington disease. the presence of TRAF1 stabilizes TRAF2, which plays a role in promoting proinflammtory responses in HeLa cells. this area warrants further investigation. TRAF1 is specifically lost from virus-specific CD8 T cells during the chronic phase of infection with HIV in humans. TRAF4 is overexpressed in breast and lung carcinomas. TRAF4 is a target gene of the p53 family of transcription factors. TRAF4 is localized in the cytoplasm in poorly differentiated SCCHN. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TRAFs have been linked to autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) a single SNP (rs7514863) demonstrates a significant association with RA. mutant TRAF6 protein inhibits the interaction between wild type TRAF6 and XEDAR. it suppresses the XEDAR-mediated NF-B activation during the development of ectoderm-derived organs. recent evidence implicates the E3 ligase activity of TRAF6 in the pathogenic aggregation of mutant proteins in neurodegenerative diseases. the presence of TRAF1 stabilizes TRAF2, which plays a role in promoting proinflammtory responses in HeLa cells. a recent study demonstrating that TRAF1 is specifically lost from virus-specific CD8 T cells during the chronic phase of infection with HIV in humans [171]. the interest in TRAFs is also driven by recent discoveries that link TRAF genetic variations to human diseases such as cancers, autoimmune diseases, and immunodeficiencies. the interest in TRAFs is also driven by recent discoveries that link TRAF genetic variations to human diseases such as cancers. yeast 2-hybrid screen, bioinformatic studies and proteomic approaches may be applied toward this end. multiple TRAF-dependent signaling pathways are triggered either sequentially or simultaneously. innate immune receptors (such as TLRs, NLRs and RLRs), adaptive immune receptors (such as TCR, CD40, OX-40 and 4-1BB) insights gained into the structures of each TRAF in complex with its specific signaling partner, substrate, or enzyme will guide the development of structure-based therapeutics. small agonists and antagonists of TRAFs may be devised to enhance beneficial signaling pathways and to interfere with harmful ones. a chemical compound specifically inhibits TRAF2-mediated NF-B activation while enhancing TRAF2-mediated AP-1 activation. chemical, proteomic, and imaging technologies will be needed to uncover these details. are there additional E3 ligases, deubiquitinases, kinases, and phosphatases that target different TRAFs. cell-permeable TRAF6 decoy peptides potently inhibit TRAF6 signaling in cultured cells. cell-permeable TRAF6 decoy peptides potently inhibit TRAF6 signaling in cultured cells. a chemical compound inhibits TRAF2-mediated NF-B activation. the diverse and cell type-specific functions of TRAFs may prevent systemic administration of therapeutic agents that directly target TRAFs. pharmacological inhibitors for cIAP1/2 are currently at various stages of clinical trials for cancers [107], and may be applied to other TRAF-mediated diseases too."}
