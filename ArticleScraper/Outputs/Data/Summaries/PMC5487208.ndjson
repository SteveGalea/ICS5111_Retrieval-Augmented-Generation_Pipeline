{"summary": "a small fraction of these variants transmit between hosts and eventually fix on a global scale. a mutation\u2019s impact on viral replication and immunogenicity affects whether it increases in frequency. at larger scales of space and time, transmission bottlenecks and host heterogeneity also shape viral genetic diversity. we deep-sequenced 37 viral samples collected longitudinally from four immunocompromised patients with long-term H3N2 influenza infections in the 2005\u20132006 and 2006\u20132007 seasons. these patients developed influenza infections in the months after receiving hematopoietic cell transplantations when immune cell counts were still low. nasal wash samples were collected approximately every week. dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26875.003 Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1 give full clinical histories. influenza viral load over time, as quantified by qRT-PCR, and lymphocyte counts over time are shown for all patients. many nonsynonymous mutations occur at sites that affect the antigenicity of HA and the antiviral sensitivity of NA. in NA in particular, we observe the emergence and persistence of mutations T242I and R292K. each subplot represents a site in HA and is labeled by codon number. primer tail sequence is indicated in plain text, homology to the U12/U13 regions in bold text, and gene-specific sequence in bold underlined text. primers were modified from the universal primers described in (Hoffmann et al., 2001) to account for the A/G polymorphism. within-host variants in patient Y. Mutation frequencies over the course of the infection are shown at all variable sites in patient Y. sites were called as variant if a base other than the initial consensus reached a frequency of at least 5% in both replicate libraries of at least one sequenced time point. Mutations located in the overlap of M1/M2 or NS1/NEP genes are displayed twice with the appropriate annotation for each gene. sites were called as variant if a base other than the initial consensus reached a frequency of at least 5% in both replicate libraries of at least one sequenced time point. p-value indicates proportion of 100,000 simulations in which the number of unique sites is less than or equal to what is empirically observed. for both HA and NA, the observed parallelism is statistically significant under this set of constraints. the same HA mutations arise in multiple patients, but evolutionary outcomes sometimes diverge. in three patients, N225D reaches a detectable frequency, but it fixes only in patient X. the influenza genome consists of eight linear segments that freely re-assort with one another but do not recombine. paired-end reads spanned the mutations in the haplotypes in patients X and X. the total frequency of all haplotypes and the frequency of the single most common recombinant haplotype are shown as a function of distance from the haplotype start. the haplotypes 00100000 and 00111111 were both recorded as having experienced recombination by the third haplotype site. the maximum-frequency recombinant haplotype never exceeded 3.5% of the total haplotypes. in large, clonally evolving influenza populations within hosts, a small set of beneficial mutations repeatedly arise and compete against one another in various combinations. many of these beneficial mutations are selected in parallel in multiple patients, but the unpredictability of clonal competition determine which mutations eventually fix. we calculated the expected overlap when the observed number of within-host and global variants were drawn at random from each gene. not all sites are expected to tolerate mutation, so we also performed simulations where we only considered sites for which there was variation in human H3N2 influenza globally between 2000 and 2015. this parallelism in HA evolution remains statistically significant until we assume that less than 50% of HA codon sites tolerate variation. parallel mutations at within-host and global scales. permutation tests for parallel evolution across within-host and global scales. overlapping sites when two sets of sites are drawn at random. the p-value indicates the proportion of 100,000 simulations in which the number of overlapping sites is greater than or equal to what is empirically observed. for HA, the observed parallelism is statistically significant at a threshold of 0.05 unless it is assumed that fewer than half the sites in the protein are mutable. the same mutations often arise in multiple patients. we deep-sequenced 37 viral samples collected longitudinally from four immunocompromised patients with long-term H3N2 influenza infections in the 2005\u20132006 and 2006\u20132007 seasons. intravenous immunoglobulin treatment is marked with a blue diamond. for the plots of lymphocyte counts, inpatient stays are indicated in purple. a number of nonsynonymous (orange) and synonymous (green) variants in each influenza gene reached a frequency of at least 5% in two independent sequencing replicates from any patient sample. each subplot represents a site in HA and is labeled by codon number. average sequencing coverage for each sample and library replicate is shown in 50 bp bins across the genome. low-quality samples are colored in red and were excluded from downstream analyses. a mutation was called if a base other than the initial consensus base reached a frequency of at least 1% with a total coverage of at least 200 reads. Mutations located in the overlap of M1/M2 or NS1/NEP genes are displayed twice with the appropriate annotation for each gene. sites were called as variant if a base other than the initial consensus reached a frequency of at least 5% in both replicate libraries of at least one sequenced time point. sites were called as variants if a base other than the initial consensus reached a frequency of at least 5% in both replicate libraries of at least one sequenced time point. Mutations located in the overlap of M1/M2 or NS1/NEP genes are displayed twice with the appropriate annotation for each gene. a constrained null model in which the fraction of sites considered mutable is the fraction that shows at least two instances of nonsynonymous mutation in the global H3N2 influenza population between 2000 and 2015. the observed parallelism is statistically significant at a threshold of 0.05 unless it is assumed that fewer than 15% of the sites in HA or 35% of the sites in NA are mutable. influenza genome consists of eight linear segments that freely re-assort with one another but do not recombine. lineages carrying beneficial mutations rise and fall in frequency as they compete with one another, making it harder for any one variant to fix. this phenomenon has been characterized extensively in experimental evolution. the total frequency of all recombinant haplotypes and the frequency of the single most common recombinant haplotype are shown as a function of distance from the haplotype start. in the absence of PCR recombination, all haplotypes should consist entirely of bases from one or the other original sample. each bar represents the average number of paired-end reads that spanned the four variable sites of interest in Figure 3B across the two sequencing replicates. the same mutations arise in parallel in multiple patients in our study. in large, clonally evolving influenza populations within hosts, a small set of beneficial mutations repeatedly arise and compete against one another in various combinations. many of these beneficial mutations are selected in parallel in multiple patients but the unpredictability of clonal competition determine which mutations eventually fix. this parallelism in HA evolution remains statistically significant at a 0.05 threshold until we assume that less than 50% of HA codon sites tolerate variation. we defined global variable sites as those at which a variant reached a frequency of at least 10% in a given year after 2000 in the GISAID database of global influenza sequences. parallel within-host mutations in HA are shown in Figure 4C and are omitted. within-host mutations are labeled by gene name, amino acid change, and patient ID. global variant frequencies are shown twice for NA site 150 because mutations arise at that site in two independent patients. for HA, but not NA or other influenza genes in aggregate, the observed overlap of mutations at within-host and global scales is statistically significant. for HA, the observed parallelism is statistically significant at a threshold of 0.05 unless it is assumed that fewer than half the sites in the protein are mutable. the four HA sites that displayed parallel within-host and global evolution in our study (138, 193, 223, and 225) also gave rise to mutations in another study that used Sanger sequencing to analyze laboratory-passaged influenza isolated longitudinally from an immunocompromised child. the parallel evolution that we observe in influenza at the within-host and global scales contrasts with HIV, where similar mutations can arise within hosts that share an HLA type. the parallelism and extensive evolution that we observe in long-term influenza infections contrasts with the limited within-host variation found in prior studies. one recent study deep-sequenced HA from several hundred patients but only found a small number of antigenic variants. but our study suggests that within-host variation may act as a noisy early measurement of global viral evolution. nasal wash samples were collected using 5 mL of saline per nostril. the timing of each sample during an infection was calculated as the number of days since the first influenza-positive nasal wash for that patient. the patient was co-infected with coronavirus for the duration of the influenza infection. patient X A male in 65+ age group developed upper respiratory symptoms in 2006. nasal wash samples repeatedly tested positive for influenza A for 72 days. patient was treated with two courses of oseltamivir. a 6 day course at 150 mg PO BID followed the first flu-positive nasal wash. the patient also received 30 g of IVIG 46 days into the flu infection. the patient intermittently tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus over the same period. we performed 35 cycles of PCR amplification with an annealing temperature of 55 degrees C and an extension time of 3 min. we purified the PCR product using 1X AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter) and prepared libraries for Illumina sequencing using Nextera XT (Illumina) we discarded samples with more than 16 bins with average coverage below 200x. we also identified sites at which a non-consensus base reached a frequency of at least 1% in both replicates and compared variant frequencies between replicates. we analyzed only sequences with passage annotation \u2018Unpassaged,\u2019 \u2018Original\u2019, or \u2018P0,\u2019 indicating that the strains were sequenced directly from the clinical isolates. we pairwise aligned each sequence to the A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) coding sequence (Genbank accession CY035022) we pairwise aligned each sequence to the A/Brisbane/10/2007 coding sequence (H3N2) using the program needle from EMBOSS 6.6.0 (Rice et al., 2000), which implements a Needleman-Wunsch alignment. we tallied the amino acids present at each codon position in each year, discarding sequences that contained indels. we identified sites at which multiple amino acids were present at a frequency of at least 10% within a the p-values given in the main text are calculated under this more conservative null model. we also performed permutation tests for a range of possible proportions of mutable sites. we also calculated the fraction of simulations that matched or exceeded the amount of parallelism observed in our data. nasal wash samples were collected using 5 mL of saline per nostril. samples were considered positive if the assay\u2019s cycle threshold was less than 40, for a limit of detection of approximately 2000 viral copies/mL. timing of each sample during an infection was calculated as the number of days since the first influenza-positive nasal wash for that patient. vir at 75 mg PO BID approximately 30 days into the infection. the patient was co-infected with coronavirus for the duration of the influenza infection. the patient also tested positive for human metapneumovirus. nasal wash samples repeatedly tested positive for influenza A for the next 69 days. the patient died 15 days after the last influenza-positive sample from relapsed AML. the patient was treated with two courses of oseltamivir. the patient was treated with three courses of oseltamivir. a 5 day course at 75 mg PO BID followed the first positive nasal wash. the patient also tested positive for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Aspergillus early in the influenza infection. to amplify the influenza genome, we modified the primers designed by Hoffmann et al. (2001) for full-length amplification of the influenza A genome. we added 1 L annealing buffer and 1 L of 2 uM primer mix. we purified the PCR product using 1X AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter) and prepared libraries for Illumina sequencing using Nextera XT (Illumina) we performed library preparation and sequencing in duplicate, starting from independent reverse-transcription reactions. read mapping We first used bowtie2 to filter out reads that mapped to the human genome. a note on codon numbering and gene annotation We numbered HA codons according to the H3 numbering system. this HA numbering scheme assigns 1 to codon 17 of the full HA gene, which is the beginning of the mature HA protein. phylogenetic analysis For each patient in our study, we determined the viral consensus sequence at the first sequenced time point. we also downloaded the set of 503 sequences in the global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID) EpiFlu database (Bogner et al., 2006) corresponding to all full-length HA coding regions from human influenza A isolates. PCR recombination as described in Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3. we show the number of paired-end reads used to infer the haplotypes in Figure 3. analysis of global variation To identify sites of global variation in influenza, we downloaded all sequences in the global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID) database. fewer unique sites of mutation indicates more parallelism. this null model is overly simplistic, since some sites in a protein experience more evolutionary constraint. we limited the number of sites considered mutable to sites that show at least two instances of nonsynonymous mutation in the global H3N2 population between 2000 and 2015.
