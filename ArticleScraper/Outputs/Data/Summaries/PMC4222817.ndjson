{"summary": "paracetamol is as an analgesic and antipyretic; chlorphenamine is an antihistamine; and phenylephrine, a vasoconstrictor and decongestant. results Mean age was 33.5 (9.5) years in the placebo group and 33.8 (11.5) in the treatment group. the common cold is the most frequently encountered disease in medical practice. it affects most adults, on average two to four times a year, and accounts for up to 40% of work absences. symptoms peak at 2 to 3 days and have a mean duration of 7 to 10 days. renergic agonists, membrane stabilizers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamin C, glucocorticoids, zinc, herbal medications and alpha-interferon. clinical trials of high-dose vitamin C have not found any clinical benefits for patients with the common cold. the common cold was defined by the presence of at least two of the following 10 symptoms: sneezing, rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion, headache, myalgia, throat discomfort, sore throat, dysphonia, cough and fever. symptoms should include fever of at least 38.1\u00b0C and moderate to severe headache or moderate to severe myalgia or arthralgia. sample size was calculated as 132 patients (66 in each group) to account for a possible loss to follow-up of 10% of the volunteers, 146 patients were included in the study. a random error of 5% and a response rate of 30% in the treatment group in comparison with the placebo group. one capsule of a fixed-dose combination of 400 mg paracetamol, 4.0 mg chlorphenamine and 4.0 mg phenylephrine was administered every 4 hours during waking hours between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. each participant received a bottle containing 15 capsules of the study drug or placebo, depending on group allocation, and one bottle containing 12 tablets of rescue medication (500 mg paracetamol). group allocation was disclosed only after data had been collected and entered into the study database. data were collected for this clinical trial from June 2, 2009 to July 7, 2009. the final report was written from august 8 to October 31, 2009. volunteers were excluded from the study if they met any of the following criteria: pregnancy or breastfeeding; known hypersensitivity to any component of the study formulation; use of alcohol or illicit drugs; use of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or barbiturates; perennial or seasonal allergic rhinitis confirmed at screening; vaccination against influenza up to 1 week before inclusion; need for antiviral therapy to treat acute respiratory infection; and participation in another clinical trial less than 1 year before. 146 patients were included in the study (73 in each group) to account for a possible loss to follow-up of 10% of the volunteers. 146 patients were included in the study (73 in each group) one capsule was administered every 4 hours during waking hours between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. each participant received a bottle containing 15 capsules of the study drug or placebo, depending on group allocation, and one bottle containing 12 tablets of rescue medication. the study lasted 10 days and included three clinical visits (V1, V2 and V3) and two rounds of laboratory tests. Efficacy analysis The primary endpoint was the sum of the scores of 10 common cold or flu-like syndrome symptoms evaluated on a four-point Likert-type scale for intensity (severity), 0 = no symptoms; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; and 3 = severe. the maximum and minimum scores for each measurement were 40 and zero respectively. secondary endpoints were overall symptom duration, time to return to usual activities, and use of rescue medication. group differences based on group (placebo or treatment) Placebo group Age (years) 33.5 (9.46) 33.82 (11.48) Sex Female 55 47 Male 18 26 Height (m) 1.64 (0.08) 1.67 (0.11) BMI (kg/m2) 25.28 (4.29) 26.95 (6.03) Mean symptom score 14.23 (4.09) 14.89 (3.78) Weight (kg) 68.21 (13.18) 75.27 (18.53) time from symptom onset analysis of the symptom score curves of both groups revealed that the curves separated after the second dose. a statistically significant reduction in symptom scores occurred in the treatment group in comparison with the placebo group. each group did not reveal statistically significant differences. the main adverse event reported was drowsiness (n = 43), followed by nausea (n = 18). overall, 110 patients experienced some type of adverse effect in both groups. Efficacy analysis Mean symptom scores were calculated for both groups at V1 and V2 (before and after treatment), without any data loss. at V1, the mean (SD) overall symptom score was 14.23 (4.09) in the placebo group and 14.09 (3.78) in the treatment group. at V2, the overall symptom score was markedly reduced in both groups. the mean number of tablets taken was lower in the treatment group than in the placebo group. a greater percentage of patients in the placebo group used rescue paracetamol (50.7%) and this difference was statistically significant. s of HR variation before and after treatment did not reveal significant differences (p = 0.834) at V2, mean SBP was 120.82 (15.93) mmHg in the treatment group and 114.01 (12.29) mmHg in the placebo group. this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.092). time to freedom from symptoms was lower in the treatment group than in the placebo group, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. the rapid symptom reduction precludes demonstration of any between-group differences at the end of the treatment (48 to 72 hours) systolic BP attributable to treatment with the active formulation was only 1.6 mmHg. no increase in sensitivity to sympathomimetic agents and response after treatment was not more intense than in the placebo group. administration of the study drug at the dose suggested in its package insert was more efficacious than placebo in the symptomatic treatment of the common cold or flu-like illness. the study drug also reduced the frequency of use of rescue medication as compared with placebo, and was as safe as placebo. ICS was responsible for management and financial planning and execution of the study. ADD participated in preparation and implementation of the logistics of the study. LFCS was the principal co-investigator responsible for medical review of all patients and data input into CRFs."}
