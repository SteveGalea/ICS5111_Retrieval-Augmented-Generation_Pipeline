{"summary": "crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV; family Nairoviridae) can cause mild disease or progress to a severe hemorrhagic syndrome associated with high morbidity and mortality. cases have been reported in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and africa. the medium (M) segment encodes the glycoprotein precursor (GPC) and the large (L) segment encodes the multifunctional L protein that contains the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and an ovarian tumor (OTU)-like cysteine protease domain. the CCHFV OTU domain possesses deubiquitinase (DUB) and deISGylase activity, enabling the removal of ubiquitin (Ub) and HFV OTU and equine arteritis virus suppress type I IFN signaling during infection (7\u20139). the turnip yellow mosaic virus DUB counters Ub-mediated proteasomal degradation of its polymerase. negative-strand RNA viruses such as CCHFV do not require DUB activity for their RdRp to function. viral DUBs such as CCHFV OTU are expected to counter innate immune responses by removing Ub and ISG15 conjugates from their target proteins. disrupting their activity is expected to enhance immune responses upon infection and hinder viral growth. previously reported efficient recovery of CCHFV when Q16 and A129, critical residues involved in Ub binding, failed. previous attempts to rescue virus containing a mutated OTU catalytically active site (C40A) failed. unexpectedly, a later attempt to generate a recombinant virus with the OTU-C40A mutation was successful. CCHFV-ZsG viruses containing the indicated OTU mutations in A549, BSR-T7/5, and A549 RIG-I KO cells. at the indicated time points (days [D]), ZsG fluorescence was quantified as a measure of viral replication. the use of immunocompromised mice presents limitations in addressing the immune suppression function of the OTU. CCHFV pathogenesis in vivo is limited by the fact that only type I IFN-deficient small-animal models are available. mutating the catalytic site resulted in mild attenuation in vivo. female IFNAR/ mice were infected subcutaneously with 100 TCID50 of recombinant CCHFV (8 mice per group) animal weights are shown as means SD and represent percentages of weight changes relative to a baseline set at 1 day before challenge. UbV-CC4 resembles cellular Ub, but the consensus LRLRGG motif required for cleavage and conjugation of Ub to proteins is mutated. this prevents cleavage by the OTU and thus resembles the inhibitory binding of cellular Ub to L-C40A. hek293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HA-OTU-wt and FLAG-UbV (FLAG-UbV-AA or FLAG-UbV-CC4) after 48 h, levels of protein ubiquitination and ISGylation were assessed by Western blotting. IC50 and related errors were determined in the SigmaPlot 12 enzyme kinetics module. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HA-Ub and hemagglutinin-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub) or with plasmids expressing hemagglutinin-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub) cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HA-OTU-wt and FLAG-UbV-CC4 or the FLAG-UbV-AA control. we then examined the effects of UbV-CC4 on CCHFV OTU deubiquitinase and deISGylase activity. we then examined the effects of UbV-CC4 on CCHFV OTU deubiquitinase and deISGylase Ubiquitination of L was assessed by coimmunoprecipitating V5-L and determining the associated HA-Ub levels. this is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the united states. nairovirus OTU and UbV-CC4 were incubated with a fluorogenic Ub substrate (Ub-AMC) fluorescence levels were determined as a measure for OTU activity. each OTU was tested in triplicate against UbV-CC4 concentrations ranging from 3.9 nM to 5 M. a CCHFV-ZsG reporter virus (LASV-ZsG) expressing a CCHFV-ZsG reporter virus (LASV-ZsG) analyzed the growth kinetics of a CCHFV-ZsG reporter virus in these cells. we measured viral titers and ZsG fluorescence as indicators of viral replication and protein synthesis. A549 cells stably expressing UbV-AA or UbV-CC4 were infected with either the ZsG reporter virus (CCHFV-ZsG-wt) (a) or the unlabeled parental CCHFV (CCHFV-wt) (b) at an MOI of 0.01. data are presented as means SD of results from three independent experiments performed in triplicate. a549 cells stably expressing UbV were infected with these CCHFV OTU mutants (MOI of 0.1), and ZsG fluorescence was determined as a measure of viral replication at the indicated time points. hek293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids, and cell lysates were harvested after 2 days. binding of cellular Ub to the inactive OTU blocks recovery of infectious CCHFV. binding of UbV-CC4 to the inactive OTU mimics this inhibition. specific OTU mutations have been described that selectively disrupt OTU interaction with Ub (Q16R) or with ISG15 (P77D) or both (A129R) the VLP assay allows us to address early steps in the replication cycle, such as entry, uncoating, and primary transcription of the encapsidated minigenome. however, when VLPs were added to UbV-CC4-expressing cells, only a mild reduction in VLP reporter activity compared to the UbV-AA control was detected. infected cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding CCHFV NP, codon-optimized L, and a nanoLuc-encoding minigenome. after 2 days, NanoLuc activity was quantified as a measure of CCHFV RdRp activity. less viral RNA was produced in the presence of UbV-CC4. UbV-AA did not affect minigenome RNA levels. the exact mechanism required for the generation of nascent CCHFV RNA has not been elucidated. previously reported efficient recovery of CCHFV when Q16 and A129, critical residues involved in Ub binding, failed. previous attempts to rescue virus containing a mutated OTU catalytically active site (C40A) failed. a later attempt to generate a recombinant virus with the OTU-C40A mutation was successful. CCHFV-ZsG viruses containing the indicated OTU mutations in A549, BSR-T7/5, and A549 RIG-I KO cells. at the indicated time points (days [D]), ZsG fluorescence was quantified as a measure of viral replication. data are presented as means standard deviations (SD) of results from three replicates. OTU activity is not required for CCHFV lethality in IFNAR/ mice. only type I IFN-deficient small-animal models (IFNAR/ and STAT1/ mice) are available. mutating the catalytic site resulted in mild attenuation in vivo. female IFNAR/ mice were infected subcutaneously with 100 TCID50 of recombinant CCHFV (8 mice per group) animal weights are shown as means SD and represent percentages of weight changes relative to a baseline set at 1 day before challenge. a synthetic Ub variant (UbV) that binds the CCHFV OTU with high levels of affinity and specificity in vitro was recently described (UbV-CC4). the consensus LRLRGG motif required for cleavage and conjugation of Ub to proteins is mutated. this prevents cleavage and thus resembles the inhibitory binding of cellular Ub to L-C40A. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HA-OTU-wt and FLAG-UbV (FLAG-UbV-AA or FLAG-UbV-CC4) after 48 h, levels of protein ubiquitination and ISGylation were assessed. CCHFV strains (f) and other nairovirus species (g) were incubated with the inhibitor for 2 min. the reactions were initiated by adding Ub-AMC. IC50 and related errors were determined in the SigmaPlot 12 enzyme kinetics module. cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HA-OTU-wt and FLAG-UbV-CC4 or the FLAG-UbV-AA control. we then examined the effects of UbV-CC4 on CCHFV OTU deubiquitinase and deISGylase activity. Ubiquitination of L was assessed by coimmunoprecipitating V5-L and determining the associated HA-Ub levels. this is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the united states. foreign copyrights may apply. purified nairovirus OTU and UbV-CC4 were incubated with a fluorogenic Ub substrate (Ub-AMC) fluorescence levels were determined as a measure for OTU activity. each OTU was tested against UbV-CC4 concentrations ranging from 3.9 nM to 5 M. if UbV-CC4-mediated inhibition of CCHFV activity affects CCHFV replication, we measured viral titers and ZsG fluorescence as indicators of viral replication and protein synthesis. CCHFV-infected A549-CC4 cells produced very low to undetectable levels of viral progeny. A549 cells stably expressing UbV-AA or UbV-CC4 were infected with either the ZsG reporter virus (CCHFV-ZsG-wt) (a) or the unlabeled parental CCHFV (CCHFV-wt) (b) at an MOI of 0.01. infectious titers were determined at the indicated time points. a549 cells stably expressing UbV were infected with these CCHFV OTU mutants (MOI of 0.1) and ZsG fluorescence was determined as a measure of viral replication at the indicated time points. hek293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids, and cell lysates were harvested after 2 days. binding of cellular Ub to the inactive OTU blocks recovery of infectious CCHFV. binding of UbV-CC4 to the inactive OTU mimics this inhibition. specific OTU mutations have been described that selectively disrupt OTU interaction with Ub (Q16R) or with ISG15 (P77D) or both. a virus-like particle (VLP) assay allows us to address early steps in the replication cycle, such as entry, uncoating, and primary transcription of the encapsidated minigenome. in order to confirm the results with genuine virus, we used a CCHFV reporter expressing NanoLuciferase (CCHFV-Nluc; Fig. 5b) a minigenome assay was used to determine if UbV-CC4 directly affects CCHFV genome amplification. Huh7 cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding CCHFV NP, codon-optimized L, and a nanoLuc-encoding minigenome. CCHFV likely replicates its genomic material in a way similar to bunyaviruses. this process entails NP binding to genomic RNA to form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, which in turn interact with the L protein. MERS-CoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus encode DUB domains that contain deubiquitinase and deISGylase activity. these viral DUBs contribute to viral pathogenesis by suppressing innate immune responses. suppression of host immune responses appears to be the main function of nairovirus OTUs. CCHFV propagation in the absence of OTU catalytic activity (C40A) was restored by inclusion of an additional mutation that prevents Ub binding to cellular Ub (Q16R), suggesting that binding of the inactive OTU to cellular Ub inhibits viral growth. however, cellular Ub is often found as polymeric chains. prolonged Ub-OTU association appears sufficient to inhibit CCHFV transcription and/or replication. CCHFV OTU-wt, OTU-C40A, and Ub were dialyzed into 100 mM NaCl\u201350 mM HEPES overnight at 4\u00b0C. three independent experiments were run for each, and the data were processed using microcal PEAQ-ITC analysis software. this is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the united states. formation of CCHFV RNP complexes involves interactions of viral RNA, NP, and the L protein. NP binding occurs at two distinct sites located at the N and C termini of L (32), suggesting a possible defect in RNP complex formation. the nairoviral OTU domain displays a high degree of sequence diversity, potentially affecting the binding affinity of UbV-CC4. the four tested CCHFV strains all contain a Gln149. the other nairovirus species predominantly encode a glutamic acid at that position. all animal procedures were approved by the CDC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. procedures conducted with LASV-, CCHFV-, or CCHFV-infected animals were performed in biosafety level 4 facilities at the centers for disease control and prevention. recombinant viruses were verified with deep-sequencing technology. all recombinant viruses were verified with deep-sequencing technology. titration was measured by titration in BSR-T7/5 cells. viruses, animals (6.5 weeks of age, 8 mice per group) were inoculated subcutaneously in the interscapular region with 102 TCID50 of CCHFV diluted in DMEM. mice were humanely euthanized at the indicated time points or when clinical illness scores based on piloerection, decreased activity, neurological signs (e.g., ataxia, paresis/paralysis), dehydration, dyspnea, and/ HEK293T cells were seeded in 10-cm2 dishes (5 106) and transfected with pcDNA-V5-OTU. lysates were incubated with anti-V5-Eu and anti-FLAG M2-d2 (acceptor) lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2) washed with high-salt Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2) proteins were eluted from the beads by adding 2 Laemmli sample buffer and heating the sample at 50\u00b0C for 10 min. pcDNA-Ube1L, pcDNA-UbCH8, pcDNA-NTAP-HERC5 and pcDNA-V5-hISG15 were cotransfected with a plasmid expressing CCHFV-OTU. all plasmid transfections were performed using a transfection reagent (Mirus) pET-15b was transformed into BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells. expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG (isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside) at 18\u00b0C overnight. cells were lysed by sonication at 50% power with a 50% duty cycle for 6 min. the reactions were run with a total volume of 30 l in a mixture containing 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mM DTT, and 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA) each OTU was tested in triplicate against UbV-CC4 concentrations ranging from 3.9 nM to 5 M. Lentivirus was generated by transfecting Lenti-X 293 cells (Clontech) with packaging vectors expressing vesicular stomatitis virus protein G (VSV-G), pPAX2-HIV-gag (Addgene), and pSCRPSY-FLAG-UbV using XtremeGene9 (Roche) after 3 days, supernatants were collected, centrifuged 5 min at 1,000 g CCHFV minigenome RNA levels were analyzed by extracting RNA from transfected Huh7 cells using MagMAX RNA isolation reagents. cDNA encoding viral sequences were performed in biosafety level 4 facilities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA) BSR-T7/5 cells were a gift from K. K. Conzelmann. recombinant IbAr10200 CCHFV was generated as previously described. plasmids encoding full-length L, M, and S genome segments. female B6.129S2-Ifnar1tm1Agt/Mmjax mice were housed in a climate-controlled laboratory with a 12-h day/12-h night cycle. all animals were given sterile water and food ad libitum and were group housed (4/cage) on autoclaved corn cob bedding (Bed-o'Cobs; Anderson Lab Bedding) RNA was quantified using one-step real-time PCR (RT-PCR) targeting the IbAr10200 nucleoprotein gene sequence. data were normalized to 18S RNA levels. lysates were incubated with anti-V5-Eu (donor; Perkin Elmer) and anti-FLAG M2-d2 (acceptor; Cisbio) fluorescence transfer was determined using a Synergy 4 plate reader (Bio-Tek) lysates were harvested in 2 Laemmli sample buffer and heated for 10 min at 95\u00b0C. 4% to 12% Bis-Tris or Tris-acetate SDS-PAGE gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a transblot system (Bio-Rad) primary antibodies were detected with SuperSignal West Dura Fast Western blot kits (Thermo Fisher) OTU activity was determined by cotransfecting Huh7 cells with pcDNA-HA-Ub (DUB assay) plasmid encoding firefly luciferase under control of the IFN- promoter. plasmid constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase was used for transfection normalization. ubiquitin variants were cotransfected to assess their effect on the IFN- response. the clarified lysate was poured over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column equilibrated with buffer A. the eluate was then filtered through a 0.2-m-pore-size filter. the eluate was subsequently filtered through a 0.2-m-pore-size filter. reactions were initiated by adding Ub-AMC and monitored by the increase in fluorescence. cell lines stably expressing UbV-AA or UbV-CC4 were generated using lentiviruses. HFV minigenome encodes the nanoLuc gene flanked by CCHFV noncoding regions under the control of a T7 polymerase. plasmids encoding the minigenome, CCHFV NP, codon-optimized CCHFV L, T7 polymerase, and a firefly luciferase transfection control (pRL3; Promega) after 48 h, luciferase activity was assessed using activity determined the next day as a measure of VLP activity."}
