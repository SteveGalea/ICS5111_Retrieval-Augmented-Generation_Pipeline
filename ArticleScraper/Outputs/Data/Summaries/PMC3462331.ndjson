{"summary": "BACKGROUND By the end of 2009 it was estimated that 740,000 people in China were living with HIV [1]. the overall national HIV prevalence is estimated to be 0.057% (0.042\u20130.071%) among the Chinese population [2, 3]. however, data from the current HIV sentinel surveillance for HIV/AIDS indicated magnitudes and trends in HIV prevalence vary substantially across different at-risk populations. the system consists of multiple level of reporting. villages collected HIV epidemiological data in their allocated areas. from the prevention units, HIV data were further sent through county health and epidemic-prevention stations to provincial centers. the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003-2004 exposed the great deficiencies in both timeliness and completeness of infectious disease reporting in NDRS [17] this substantially changed the landscape of infectious diseases surveillance in china. just 6 months after the SARS epidemic subsided, the china CDC launched the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP) [18] the national center for HIV/AIDS prevention and control (NCAIDS) of china CDC is the overseeing organisation for assembling and analysing all HIV disease information and then presenting a final report to China MOH. a total of 65,481 people are currently receiving ART in 2009. sentinel surveillance is collaboratively supervised by the Chinese MOH and WHO. in 2000, surveillance pilot sites targeting IDU, FSW, male clients and the general female population were established in Fujian, Xinjiang, Guangxi, Shanxi, Yunnan and Sichuan. consistent condom use in commercial sexual contacts increased from 10% in 1995 to 62% in 2009. the proportion who reported never using condoms decreased from 70.6% to 2.0% during the same period. under-utilisation and lack of transparency of information outside certain authorised channels are possibly the greatest obstacle to optimal use of the current system. fragmented authoritarianism in china can be viewed as mixed product of traditional authoritarianism. fragmented authoritarianism leads to absence of accountability in vertical administration of CDCs and lack of cooperation among CDCs. a fragmented system makes it difficult to authenticate the quality of the data. a fragmented authoritarian political structure leads to a fragmented information system. the central china CDC at the top of the administration pyramid has the ultimate authority of data collection, assembling, analysis and distribution. the lack of genuine engagement of civil society groups, including the media and the scientific communities, often results in a results-oriented policy implementation. ensuring the accuracy of reported disease information should be a high priority in the future development of HIV surveillance in China. misconceptions about HIV transmission and prejudice towards PLHIV are widespread among the general population. PLHIV that belongs to at-risk groups, especially MSM, are subjected to greater social stigma due their identity and sexual orientation. only 14-45% of Chinese MSM underwent HIV testing in the past 12 months during 2007-2009 [2, 47-53]. diagnosis of AIDS Clinical HIV Diagnosis Test Source of the blood sample* Status of the confirmation test Confirmation test date and location History of High-Risk Behaviors, (Ever Involved in or Had) Intravenous drug usage Extramarital sexual activities HIV-positive regular sexual partner Sexual acts with MSM Blood donation Receiving blood transfer Positive maternal HIV status Occupational exposure Reporting Organization Name of the organisation Name of the reporting clinician Contact details and report date Without specifying disease stages. all diagnosed and confirmed HIV-infected cases admitted to hospitals are obliged to report through the web-based reporting system to china CDC. all levels of CDC can acquire the data 'live' according to their assigned access privileges. this substantially reduced the average reporting period from 7-8 days to less than 2 days. the hospital-based surveillance in china has cumulatively diagnosed 326,000 people living AIDS. a total of 65,481 people are currently receiving ART in 2009 [23], which accounted for 62.4% of the AIDS cases. inel sites in china increased to 1318, covering 14 at-risk population groups. sentinel surveillance data is integrated with disease information reported from hospitals. surveillance data have revealed that the proportion of IDU among all drug users has increased from 42% in 1994 [28, 29] to 53% in 2001 [29, 30] and 69% in 2009 [31]. a transparent HIV surveillance system across all stakeholders is beneficial for the entire HIV sector in the evaluation and implementation of HIV prevention and intervention strategies. authoritarianism describes any political structure in which overall authority is concentrated in the hands of a single leader or a small group of elite. fragmented authoritarian political structure directly affects the HIV surveillance system in china. this leads to the absence of accountability in vertical administration of CDCs and lack of cooperation among CDCs on the same level. in this structure, the central China MOH cannot exercise direct supervision over the provincial MOHs. a fragmented political structure inevitably leads to a fragmented information system with little openness and systematic mechanisms for synthesis. a fragmented political structure inevitably leads to a fragmented information system with little openness and systematic mechanisms for synthesis. in the current political structure, all levels of government are only accountable to their upper-level administrations, but not to the general public. the absence of genuine engagement of civil society groups, including the media and the scientific communities, often results in a results PLHIV often perceive healthcare institutions as an indispensable source of social support and one of the few places where they may be willing to disclose their HIV-positive status. however, a separate survey among health workers in hospitals showed that HIV stigmatisation remains as the major health-seeking barriers for PLHIV in china [45]. large data gaps and lack of quality control obstruct the full performance of the system. this is partly due to fragmented authoritarianism brought about by the political structure. social stigma and discrimination in health institutes are also key barriers."}
