{"summary": "ebola (EBOV) and marburg (MARV) viruses cause severe hemorrhagic disease in humans and non-human primates. there are currently no FDA approved vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat infections by these Category A NIAID priority pathogens [1]. this is the first identification of a VP40-interacting mammalian WW-domain bearing protein that negatively regulates budding. this is the first identification of a VP40-interacting mammalian WW-domain bearing protein that negatively regulates budding. results Screening of proline-rich motif reading array identifies BAG3 as an eVP40 PPxY interactor. the reading array represents a powerful tool that we have used previously to identify WW-domain proteins that physically and functionally bind to viral PPxY motifs. fluorescent spots indicate a positive peptide/WW-domain interaction. EBOV VP40 peptide interactions with WW1 of Rsp5 (square A, green boxes), WW3 of Nedd4 (square B, purple boxes), and the BAG3 WW domain (square G, red oval) are highlighted. extracts from HEK293T cells expressing flag-tagged mVP40-WT were incubated with GSH beads conjugated with GST-BAG3WW or GST alone. input and pulled-down proteins were detected by Western blotting using either anti-flag or anti-GST antisera. eVP40 and mVP40 interact with full length BAG3 in a PPxY-dependent manner. extracts from HEK293T cells transfected with eVP40 or eVP40-PT/PY plus BAG3-WT were first immunoprecipitated (IP) with either normal rabbit IgG or polyclonal anti-eVP40 antisera. extracts from HEK293T cells transfected with mVP40-WT were first immunoprecipitated with either normal rabbit IgG or anti-mVP40 antisera. expression controls for mVP40-WT, endogenous BAG3 and -actin are shown. hek293T cells were co-transfected with eVP40 plus His/myc-tagged BAG3 WT, BAG3-N (WW-domain deletion mutant), or BAG3-C (BAG domain deletion mutant) hek293T cells were immunoprecipitated with either non-specific IgG, or anti-eVP40 antiserum as indicated. BAG3 interacts with eVP40 and mVP40 in a WW-domain dependent manner. Schematic diagram of BAG3-WT and mutants BAG3-N and BAG3-C. all three proteins contain both His and cmyc epitope tags. HEK 293T cells were transfected with eVP40 or mVP40 alone. expression of BAG3-WT, BAG3-N or BAG3-C consistently resulted in a significant decrease in egress of both eVP40 and mVP40 VLPs. eVP40 VLPs from control cells were set to 1.0. Statistical significance was analyzed by a one-way ANOVA. ns: not significant, *** = p0.001. HEK293T cells were transfected with a constant amount of eVP40 plus vector (-), or increasing amounts of BAG3-WT (A), BAG3-C (B), or BAG3-N (C) the indicated proteins were detected in cell extracts and VLPs by Western blotting. HEK293T cells were transfected with eVP40 plus either random (control) or BAG3-specific siRNAs. both cell extracts and VLPs were harvested and analyzed by Western blotting. we achieved suppression of endogenous BAG3 by approximately 60%. representative images of live cells transfected with GFP-eVP40 revealed the expected pattern of expression in the cytoplasm with pronounced localization around the cell periphery and in PM projections. the pattern of GFP-eVP40 changed in cells co-expressing BAG3-mCherry, resulting in a more diffuse pattern of cytoplasmic localization with little to no PM projections. cells were imaged at 24 hours post transfection using a leica SP5 FLIM inverted confocal microscope. representative images show the colocalization of GFP-eVP40 and mCherry-LC3 in aggresomes. cell nuclei were stained with NucBlue. Scale bars = 10m. HEK293T cells were transfected with vector (pCAGGS) alone, VP40 + vector, VP40 + BAG3-WT, or VP40 + WW-domain deletion mutant BAG3-N. both cytosol and PM fractions were harvested and subjected to Western blot analysis. eVP40 and mVP40 were detected at equivalent levels in all cytosol fractions. the amount of VP40 in the PM fraction in control cells was set at 100%. eVP40 localized robustly to the PM compared to control cells. eVP40 localized robustly to the PM (lanes 6). the levels of eVP40, BAG3-WT and BAG3-N detected at the cell surface correlate well with results from the cell fractionation studies. the general mechanism by which BAG3 inhibits VLP egress is unique and involves sequestration of a fraction of eVP40 away from the PM and into aggresomes in a PPxY/WW domain-dependent manner. titers of VSV-M40 released from cells expressing BAG3-WT were consistently and significantly reduced by >50% compared to controls. expression of BAG3-WT did not have any significant effect on budding of mutant VSV-M40-P2728A. biotinylated peptides containing either the eVP40 WT PPxY motif (MRRVILPTAPPEYMEAI) or an eVP40 PPxY mutant motif (MRRVILPTAAAEAMEAI) were used to screen 115 GST-WW domain and 40 GST-SH3 domain containing proteins. we used purified GST-WW domain fusion proteins and a GST pull down assay to confirm the specificity of the BAG3-VP40 interaction. protein extracts from HEK293T cells expressing either eVP40-WT, eVP40-PT/PY (PPxY deletion mutant) were incubated with beads containing GST alone or GST-BAG3WW. eVP40 and mVP40 interact with full-length BAG3 expressed in mammalian cells. hek293T cells were co-transfected with BAG3 plus WT or PPxY mutants of eVP40 (eVP40-PT/PY) and mVP40 (mVP40-P>A) extracts from HEK293T cells transfected with eVP40 or eVP40-PT/PY plus BAG3-WT were first immunoprecipitated (IP) with either normal rabbit IgG or polyclonal anti-eVP40 antisera as indicated. expression controls for mVP40, mVP40(P>A), His-myc-tagged BAG3 and GAPDH are shown. expression controls for mVP40-WT, endogenous BAG3 and -actin are shown. HEK293T cells were transfected with either eVP40-WT or mVP40-WT. cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with either non-specific IgG, or anti-VP40 antiserum. VP40 plus His/myc-tagged BAG3 WT, BAG3-N (WW-domain deletion mutant), or BAG3-C (BAG domain deletion mutant) cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with either non-specific IgG, or anti-eVP40 antiserum as indicated. extracts from HEK293T cells transfected with indicated plasmid combinations were first immunoprecipitated with either rabbit IgG or polyclonal anti-eVP40 antisera as indicated. BAG3-WT or mutant proteins were detected in the precipitates by Western blot using mouse anti-cmyc antiserum. expression of BAG3-WT or BAG3-C consistently resulted in a significant decrease in egress of both eVP40 and mVP40 VLPs. intriguingly, the inhibitory effect of BAG3 appeared to be more pronounced on budding of mVP40 VLPs. mVP40 VLPs from control cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid combinations. proteins were detected in cell extracts and VLPs by Western blotting. mVP40 VLPs from control cells were set to 1.0. HEK293T cells were transfected with a constant amount of eVP40 plus vector (-), or increasing amounts of BAG3-WT (A), BAG3-C (B), or BAG3-N (C) the indicated proteins were detected in cell extracts and VLPs by Western blotting. eVP40 VLPs from control cells were transfected with eVP40 plus either random (control) or BAG3-specific siRNA as indicated. a similar 3-fold increase was observed for mVP40 VLPs from cells treated with BAG3-specific siRNAs. contrast in VP40 localization can be visualized in neighboring cells expressing GFP-eVP40 plus either low or high levels of BAG3-mCherry. heLa cells were transfected with GFP-eVP40 (green) plus either vector, or BAG3-mCherry (red) and cells were imaged at 24 hours post transfection using a leica SP5 FLIM inverted confocal microscope. confocal microscopy of live HeLa cells revealed the typical pattern of GFP-eVP40 predominantly at the PM in cells expressing mCherry-LC3. however, a fraction of GFP-eVP40 was observed to co-localize with mCherry-LC3 in puncta most likely representing cellular aggresomes. HEK293T cells were transfected with vector (pCAGGS) alone, VP40 + vector, VP40 + BAG3-WT, or VP40 + WW-domain deletion mutant BAG3-N. both cytosol and PM fractions were harvested and subjected to Western blot analysis. eVP40 (B) or mVP40 (D) from three independent experiments is shown. hek293T cells were transfected with eVP40 plus vector, BAG3-WT. cells were fixed at 24 hrs post-transfection, then incubated with rabbit anti-eVP40 antiserum. ocal microscopy correlate well with results from the cell fractionation studies. we found that the general mechanism by which BAG3 inhibits VLP egress is unique and involves sequestration of a fraction of eVP40 away from the PM and into aggresomes in a PPxY/WW domain-dependent manner. we found that the levels of infectious VSV-M40 released from mock- and BAG3-N-transfected cell extracts were quantified by standard plaque titers of VSV-M40 released from cells expressing BAG3-WT were reduced by >50% compared to controls. expression of BAG3-WT did not have any significant effect on budding of mutant VSV-M40-P2728A. we have identified host WW-domain containing protein BAG3 as a novel interactor with the PPxY L-domain motif of both eVP40 and mVP40. BAG3 is the first host WW-domain interactionor to negatively regulate egress of eVP40 and mVP40 VLPs. selective autophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum was recently shown to regulate EBOV replication in murine cells. adenovirus penton base protein interacted with the WW-domain of BAG3 via its PPxY motif to promote adenovirus entry and virus progeny production. a novel, WW-domain interactor with the PPxY motif of VP40 leads to inhibition of VLP and infectious virus egress in a PPxY/WW-domain dependent manner. a more comprehensive understanding of these host proteins may be helpful in the design of future antiviral therapies. plasmids encoding eVP40-WT, eVP40-PT/PY were described previously. pcDNA6 myc-His-BAG3-WT (1\u2013575), pcDNA6 myc-His-BAG3-N (62\u2013575) and pcDNA6 myc-His-BAG3-C (1\u2013420) were kindly provided by K.
