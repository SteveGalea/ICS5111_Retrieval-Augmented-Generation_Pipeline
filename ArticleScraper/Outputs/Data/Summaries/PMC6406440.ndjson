{"summary": "influenza A virus is a significant public health concern with highest rates of morbidity and fatality. they have a wide host range and often jumps the species barrier. genetic drift is caused by point mutations in genes of the virus due to an error-prone RNA polymerase. genetic shift is the result of genetic re-assortment between the genes of two or more different strains of influenza virus infecting the same cell in a host. a total of 18 novel HA (H1-H18) and 11 NA (N1-N11) have been identified till date. most of the possible combinations of 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes have been reported in water fowl which is the main reservoir of IAVs. few host species are susceptible to infection by all the four known influenza viruses. the IBVs almost exclusively infects humans with only a few reported cases in seals [22], horses [23], dogs [24] and pigs [25]. influenza B viruses also cause annual epidemics, but due to the limitation of the host, they have never been known to be associated with any pandemic. a novel influenza virus, recently classified as the influenza D virus, has been identified in several animals. the IBV and ICV have never been the cause of any pandemic scenario. the surveillance activities related to ICVs have not gained much importance compared to IAVs and IBVs as it has been associated with mild clinical conditions. IDV was detected from equine populations and small ruminants, such as sheep and goats from the USA and Canada [40,49] no IDV antibody was detected in the poultry [40,49] the low seroprevalence of IDV in pigs suggests that the virus can infect and circulate in the pigs, but is not as wide spread as it is in cattle. swine exerted a stronger evolutionary pressure than the cattle. based on experimental infection in cattle showed that IDV was detected in both upper and lower respiratory tract. however, the clinical signs and symptoms were mild [2,36,54]. the authors also suggested the possibility of coinfection by other respiratory viruses along with IDV to collectively cause the bovine respiratory disease (BRD) the most commonly detected viruses were the bovine rhinitis A and B virus, and bovine coronavirus along with IDV. the IDV shows optimal growth at both 33 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C further suggesting that IDV is not restricted to an elevated temperature for replication. Iv and IDV have only seven segments that exist in the form of ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) in association with nucleoproteins. the virions are 80\u2013120 nm in diameter. the glycoprotein hemagglutinin-esterase fusion (HEF) helps in viral entry into the host cells. the authors revealed that IDV could withstand and retain its infectivity even at higher temperatures of 53 \u00b0C for as long as 120 min. the IDV was also observed to lose just 20% of the original infectivity when subjected to a low pH of 3.0 for 30 min as compared to IAV, IBV and ICV that were completely inactive at this low pH. influenza viruses that cause zoonotic infections in humans have been shown to have poor transmissibility between ferrets compared to the viruses that cause epidemics and pandemics. studies related to the zoonotic potential of IDV are still in infancy and is unclear. IDV genome structure is similar to ICV, but exhibit a broader cellular and host tropism than ICV. the ability of influenza viruses to acquire frequent mutations makes IDV a potential threat to human health and warrants more comprehensive studies to understand its complexity. moreno et al. focused on the development and validation of MAb-based competitive ELISA for the detection of antibodies against IDV. strategies like the bioaerosol surveillance at the human\u2013animal interface may be advantageous in terms of low cost and less invasive sampling to detect novel influenza viruses. influenza viruses have been the cause of significant concern to human and animal health worldwide. the virus causes morbidity and mortality, but its frequent infection also leads to socio-economic loss. wild birds are the major reservoirs of IAVs. mixed reports for IDV infections in humans further make it important to study the zoonotic potential of IDV. more detailed investigations are needed to better understand this novel virus in terms of its epidemiological, pathological and biological characteristics."}
