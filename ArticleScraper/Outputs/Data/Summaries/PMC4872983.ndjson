{"summary": "in this type of study, the inexistence of a control group may lead to a series of bias and practical difficulties. a program that includes participants followed-up for 3 to 6 months can perceive the first results only several months or years later(2). the ARIMA model was developed in the 1970s by George Box and Gwilym Jenkins. it is based on an adjustment of observed values, and its goal is to reduce as close to zero as possible the difference between the values produced in the model and the observed ones. this model can describe behaviors of stationary and nonstationary series. a stationary series has a \u201cwhite noise\u201d when mistakes consist of a sequence of uncorrelated random variables. the partial ACF (PACF) is used to measure the associative degree between an observation ( ) and an observation made in two periods before removing the intermediate period ( )(15). lation does not show statistically significant results. the autocorrelation must be retested to verify the possible presence of any residual pattern. a form often used is the maximum likelihood. the autocorrelation function (ACF) is a standard tool used to explore time series. a stationary series has a \u201cwhite noise\u201d when mistakes consist of a sequence of uncorrelated random variables. a stationary series has a \u201cwhite noise\u201d when mistakes consist of a sequence of uncorrelated random variables. the investigator creates a new series of data, based on the differences of the current period in relation to the previous one. the autocorrelation must be retested to verify the possible presence of any residual pattern. in this stage, the traditional method of least squares may be used. the first period of the program could not present a significant impact on the patient. in later periods, significant impact levels could be found. in longer studies, attention should be given to external factors of the model."}
