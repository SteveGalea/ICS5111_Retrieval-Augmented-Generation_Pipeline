{"summary": "the world health organization (WHO) is reporting thousands of suspected cases with 317 confirmed cases, over 72 deaths, and a probable case fatality rate of 22%. 14 health care workers have been infected with a case fatality rate of 30%. the virus belongs to the family Arenaviridae, and is endemic over most of west africa. it is estimated that there are over 300,000 infections on an annual basis in West Africa. there are no approved vaccines or therapeutics for the treatment or prevention of LASV with the questionable exception of off-label use of ribavirin. the timeline of various aspects of disease course during Lassa virus infection and efficacy of various preventative strategies. each of the strategies listed has shown protective efficacy in guinea pigs and/or NHPs when administered relative to infection. infected cells migrate to the draining lymph nodes of infected individuals. the type I IFN response is shown to be an important mediator of protection against the virus. pathogenic and lethal LF models have been characterized using mice lacking the IFN/ receptor. LASV can use the above-mentioned strategies to prevent RIG-I signaling. these strategies play an important role in preventing APC activation. the ability to alter the function of APC is likely a critical determinant of pathogenesis during LASV infection. antibodies are thought by many to not contribute to natural recovery. antibodies are not produced at high levels, as neutralizing antibodies are not produced at high levels. mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, complement fixation/activation, and opsonization may play a role in protection from disease. strong T-cell responses against GP1 and GP2 induced by a vaccinia-vectored LASV vaccine were protective against LASV challenge. strong activation and proliferation of CD4 and CD8 T cells are seen in animals that survive infection. the use of immune plasma and convalescent serum as a treatment for LASV has shown to be protective. however, the lack of neutralizing antibodies produced during natural infection may be the reason why no correlation between antibody production and survival has been observed. the lack of neutralizing antibodies produced during natural infection may be the reason why no correlation between antibody production and survival has been observed. a recombinant vaccinia virus was engineered to express the NP from LASV and given to outbred Hartley guinea pigs. a similar dose of the prototypical strain Josiah, a Sierra Leone isolate, is generally only 10%\u201320% lethal in Hartley guinea pigs. the recombinant vaccine vaccinated animals showed some signs of disease with mild fever and acute viremia that was 10-fold less than control animals. a set of secondary comprehensive studies was undertaken in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques to test the individual vaccinia vaccines expressing GP1, GP2 and NP. in strain 13 guinea pigs vaccinated with the ML29 vaccine were completely protected from lethal LASV infection (Josiah and LASV-803213) the ML29 vaccine was able to provide up to 80% protection when given 2 days after a lethal challenge. however, further testing in the gold standard models for LASV disease, rhesus or cynomolgus macaques, is warranted. a mixture of the two recombinant viruses protected strain 13 guinea pigs from fatal LASV challenge; however, sterilizing immunity was not achieved. however, further testing of the YF17D-GPC LASV vaccine in marmosets resulted in poor immunogenicity and no protection from lethal LASV challenge. cynomolgus macaques were vaccinated with a single dose of VSV-LASV-GPC. all vaccinated animals survived the challenge with no overt signs of disease or changes in blood chemistry or hematology. there is considerable genetic variability between strains of LASV. clade III isolate has yet to be tested for efficacy against the VSV-LASV-GPC vaccine. a second VSV-based vaccine in the region may not provide adequate immunogenicity and protection. a single control animal succumbed to classical LASV disease on day 13. SV glycoprotein expression in a single vaccine is feasible and has significant potential to prevent future outbreaks of EBOV and LASV in west africa. an early determinant of disease progression in arenavirus infection is the activation status of virally infected APC. infected APC fail to undergo activation or maturation, leading to effective adaptive immunity while replicating at high levels within these cells. the ability of LASV to alter the type I IFN response may allow for unchecked viral replication and an escape of protective adaptive immune responses. there is evidence that LASV can antagonize the innate IFN response and other cellular mechanisms that lead to both innate and adaptive immune responses. candidates such as the ML29 reassortant vaccine express LASV nucleocapsid protein. this may have important implications for the immunogenicity of this vaccine. the lack of T-cell activation is likely due to an inhibition of the interaction between infected and antigen-primed DCs presenting LASV peptides to T cells. there is also evidence that LASV-specific T cells can contribute to disease through macrophage activation. strong T-cell responses against both NP and GPC seem to persist for years following infection. the role of humoral immune responses during LASV infection has been debated more than that of T cells. neutralizing antibodies against LASV are not produced in large quantities during infection due to the structural properties of the LASV GPC and its glycan shield. innate immune system Professional antigen-presenting cells are the primary target cells for LASV infection. initial infection typically involves myeloid lineage cells and APC. early determinant of disease progression is activation status of virally infected APC. the ability of LASV to alter the type I IFN response may allow for unchecked viral replication and an escape of protective adaptive immune responses. the ability of LASV to alter the type I IFN response is likely a critical determinant of pathogenesis during LASV infection. candidates such as the ML29 reassortant vaccine express LASV nucleocapsid protein. this may have important implications for the immunogenicity of this vaccine. the lack of T-cell activation is likely due to an inhibition of the interaction between infected and antigen-primed DCs presenting LASV peptides to T cells. there is also evidence that LASV-specific T cells can contribute to disease through macrophage activation. strong T-cell responses against both NP and GPC seem to persist for years following infection. the role of humoral immune responses during LASV infection has been debated more than that of T cells. neutralizing antibodies against LASV are not produced in large quantities during infection due to the structural properties of the LASV GPC and its glycan shield. the best therapeutic strategy against LASV is favipiravir, which can be administered up to 9 days post-infection in a guinea pig model. the best candidate with strong efficacy and immunogenicity for LASV prevention have been based on replication-competent vaccine modalities. a recombinant vaccinia virus was engineered to express the NP from LASV and given to outbred Hartley guinea pigs. a similar dose of the prototypical strain Josiah is generally only 10%\u201320% lethal in Hartley guinea pigs. a similar dose of the prototypical strain Josiah is generally only 10%\u201320% lethal in Hartley guinea pigs. ninety percent of animals that received all three proteins survived a lethal LASV challenge (n=10) this is in stark contrast to previous guinea pig experiments. all animals that received the individual proteins succumbed to infection (GP1, GP2 or NP; 0% survival) this is in stark contrast to the previous guinea pig experiments. ML29 also has substantial safety concerns with regards to the genetic stability of a recombinant virus as well as safety in HIV-infected individuals within LASV endemic regions. the YF17D vaccine is highly immunogenic, induces strong cell-mediated immunity, and tolerates recombinant addition of transgenes into its genome. in 2013, an unprecedented Ebola outbreak in west africa resulted in over 30,000 documented cases of infection and >10,000 deaths. several vaccines were accelerated into Phase III clinical trials for testing during the outbreak. antibodies have been implicated as the main correlate of protection for EBOV infection57 with respect to VSV-EBOV-GPC vaccination. the single Josiah-based VSV vaccine could provide 100% protection against several isolates including Sierra Leone (Josiah; clade IV), Liberia (Z-132; clade IV), Mali (Soromba-R; clade V), and Nigeria (Pinneo; clade I) the current Nigerian outbreak strain of LASV is thought to be a clade III isolate and has yet to be tested for efficacy against the VSV-LAS three macaques were vaccinated with VSV-LASV-GPC and challenged with a lethal dose of LASV Josiah. all three animals survived the challenge with no overt signs of disease and no virus was detected in the blood. a single control animal succumbed to classical LASV disease on day 13. a similar dose of the prototypical strain Josiah is generally only 10%\u201320% lethal in Hartley guinea pigs. this highlights the significant diversity and pathogenic heterogeneity of LF. most animals including the recombinant vaccine vaccinated animals showed some signs of disease with mild fever and acute viremia that was 10-fold less than control animals. studies in guinea pigs vaccinated with the ML29 vaccine were completely protected from lethal LASV infection. despite the significant genomic heterogeneity between outbreak strains, a universal vaccine for LASV might be achievable. the ML29 vaccine has undergone some testing in small NHPs, Marmosets in particular, and achieved 100% protection with accompanying sterilizing immunity. 80% of strain 13 guinea pigs were protected from lethal LASV challenge. separate recombinant viruses were generated expressing GP1 or GP2. further testing of the YF17D-GPC LASV vaccine in marmosets resulted in poor immunogenicity and no protection from lethal LASV challenge. the recombinant VSV system is able to tolerate the replacement of the VSV glycoprotein with foreign virus glycoproteins. the resulting viruses are attenuated, safe, and highly immunogenic, making this vaccine a strong candidate for LASV prevention. cynomolgus macaques vaccinated with VSV-LASV-GPC showed no overt signs of disease when challenged with the liberian isolate. the current Nigerian outbreak strain of LASV is thought to be a clade III isolate and has yet to be tested for efficacy against the VSV-LASV-GPC vaccine. the VSV vector has the potential to be used repeatedly for the protection of both EBOV and LASV infection in Africa. the combination of both EBOV and LASV glycoprotein expression in a single vaccine is feasible and has significant potential to prevent future outbreaks. the current resurgence of LASV in Nigeria has again caught the international community as ill prepared."}
