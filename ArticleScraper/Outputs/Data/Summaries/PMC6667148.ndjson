{"summary": "visceral leishmaniasis (VL) by leishmania infantum is a major global disease potentially fatal to humans. it is one of the most important threats among the neglected tropical diseases causing an estimated 300,000 new cases and about 20,000 deaths in humans each year. malnutrition and low hygienic conditions represent risk factors for the spreading of the infection in human patients. the overall prevalence of L. infantum infection is generally lower than in dogs living in the same areas [8,9,12,13] the current distribution of this disease may be underestimated. the subclinical presentation of FeL makes the diagnosis a complex task. the lack of information about the distribution of L. infantum subclinical infections in cats is an obstacle to a clear understanding of the role of cats in the epidemiology of zoonotic VL in endemic areas. serum and blood samples of cats were sent from six veterinary analysis laboratories distributed throughout Italy. serum samples from a cat positive to L. infantum by cytological and molecular analyses were used as positive and negative controls. positive sera were titrated by serial dilutions until negative results were obtained. genemic DNA was extracted from blood using the GenUP DNA Kit. the location of L. infantum positive cats was geo-referenced using a geographical information system (GIS, ArcGIS version 10.3 ESRI), according to the owner\u2019s province. the odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval of L. infantum infection were calculated for each level of the categorical variables. cats were grouped according to age in younger than 18 months old (group 1, G1), between 19 months and 6 years old (group 2, G2) and elder than 6 years (group 3, G3) serological testing Serum samples were tested for anti-L. infantum antibodies. of 10 healthy cats living in a non-leishmania-endemic area (i.e., negative control) were included. samples were scored as positive when a threshold cycle less than 37 was recorded. value0.05 was considered for statistical significance. number of sampled cats (i.e., 2,659) enrolled from northern (n = 1,543), central (n = 471) and southern (n = 645) Italy exceeded the minimum sample size. the prevalence of positive cats detected by serological and/or molecular tests in the different geographic areas was 10.5% (68/645) in the South, 2.3% (11/471) in the Centre and 1.6% (25/1543) in the North of Italy. cats living in the south of Italy were related to higher risk of L. infantum infection than those in the north by the univariate (OR = 7.14; 95% CI: 4.48\u201311.49) and multivariate analysis (OR = 2.66, 95% CI: 1.59\u20134.44). cats living in the south of Italy were related to higher risk of L. infantum infection than those in the north by the univariate (OR = 7.14; 95% CI: 4.48\u201311. the risk of not neutered compared to neutered cats was OR = 1.76 (95% CI: 1.06\u20132.93) and statistically significant (p = 0.028) 115 and 101 cats were positive to FeLV (4.3%) or FIV (3.8%). variate analysis Multivariate analysis OR 95% CI p-value Sex F vs M 0.75 0.51 1.12 0.16 0.81 0.53 1.22 0.3015 Neutering status Not-neutered vs neutered 2.39 1.54 3.73 0.0001 1.76 1.06 2.93 0.028 Geographical area South vs North 7.14 4.48 11.49 0.0001 2.66 1.59 4.44 0.0001 South vs Centre 4.93 2.58 9.43 0.72 0.51 1. in two of these three provinces a higher proportion of qPCR positive samples (3.8% and 1.6% respectively) was also recorded. the location of L. infantum positive cats was geo-referenced using a geographical information system (GIS, ArcGIS version 10.3 ESRI) the occurrence of L. infantum in wild animals has been reported mainly in the centre and south of Italy [34\u201336]. current data available in the literature on the seroprevalence of FeL have been gained using different diagnostic methodologies and cut-off values. cats are more prone to an outdoor life style than younger and neutered cats. the prevalence of cats positive for FeL at the molecular tests also depends on the cat life style. this may suggest that blood is not the ideal tissue for molecular diagnosis of L. infantum infection in cats. a correlation between molecular and serological positivity in dogs infected for canL. there is none between molecular and serological tests for FeL. transmission studies with competent sand fly vectors could provide more information about the role of cats as reservoir hosts of L. infantum. t data on the ability of vectors in the transmission of L. infantum on natural infected cats complicate the appreciation of the role of cats in L. infantum epidemiology."}
