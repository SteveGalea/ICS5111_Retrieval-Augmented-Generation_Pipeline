{"summary": "the death toll from cholera among British and French forces was reportedly around 7000. but 491 455 died of disease, including tens of thousands from cholera. in 1851, the first of a series of international Sanitary Conferences (ISC) was held in Paris. the current, seventh pandemic, which began in Asia in the 1950s, has not taken hold in Europe, but remains a major public health problem in the developing world. cholera has spread to neighbouring countries of angola, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. in 2010, the disease reappeared in Haiti when an Asian strain was introduced in the aftermath of a major earthquake. six months' quarantine for dogs and cats was unpopular. we calculated the increased risk of a cat developing rabies in Britain. this included reducing the quarantine period, tagging, vaccination and serological testing. under a policy of six months' quarantine, it was less than 1 in 50 million prospective immigrants. in the absence of any policy, the risk was about 1 in 10 million. the most satisfactory alternative was to combine vaccination of animals more than three months old at a fixed time (e.g. 6\u201312 months) before entry to the UK with serological testing and permanent marking for identification. the chance of a case within 20 years was not zero, but very small. since 2000, dogs, cats and ferrets have been given freedom of travel. since 2000, dogs, cats and ferrets have been given freedom of travel. they must also carry a passport and enter via an authorized route. XDR-TB has now been found in almost every country where second-line drugs are used. XDR-TB has been found in almost every country where second-line TB drugs are used. emergence of exotic strains of M. tuberculosis presents clinical challenges. but public health strategy for containing spread depends on evolutionary fitness. at the start of an epidemic, this is the basic case reproduction number, R0 [18] if R0 can be held permanently below 1 for all strains, then TB will eventually be eliminated. in nine out of ten settings, all strains of TB, including MDR-TB, were on a slow path to elimination. this was true even in the Baltic states of Estonia and Latvia. the single exception was Russia (four provinces) which may have had severe MDR-TB epidemics up to 2006. 270 000 patients should be treated for MDR-TB in 2015, among the 400 000 estimated to arise each year. the challenge resides in the weaknesses of clinical and laboratory facilities in affected countries, but also in the debate about how best to provide medical services. an estimated 2.6 million people acquired infection in 2009. an estimated 1.9 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses. the argument for preventing transmission was first set out by Montaner et al. ART for HIV/AIDS starts (horizontal axis) and the average time between random HIV testing of individuals (vertical axis) numbers in circles give values of R0 on different contours, e.g. solid black line, R0 = 1. Solid white line marks CD4 = 350 l1. only 36 per cent of all HIV-positive patients with CD4 count less than 350 l1 were receiving ART [30] by the end of 2009, only 36 per cent of all HIV-positive patients with CD4 count less than 350 l1 were receiving ART [30] this is some way from the goal of \u2018universal access\u2019, even for people with late-stage HIV infections. a century and a half after the ISC debated cholera, similar questions apply to influenza control in Europe [33] and how can resources and materials be shared while at the same time preserving intellectual property. there are fears that pathogen samples taken from the source of an outbreak will be quickly exploited for profit by well-funded laboratories in the rich world. the worst-affected countries have under-funded and weak health systems. the incidence of HIV infection could be reduced to very low levels if a large enough fraction of infected people could begin treatment soon after acquiring infection."}
