{"summary": "the HICS is a method by which the hospital operates when an emergency is declared. a tabletop exercise was developed for each hospital which in turn was based on the highest probable risk. no hospital had a high level of performance, except for logistic and finance sections. the ICS is a standardized on-scene, all-hazards incident management approach. the ICS was created in 1970 in response to a series of wildfires in the united states. the goal was to simplify communication and establish lines to authority and command. the lack of internationally accepted standards of performance makes it difficult to evaluate the outcome of health care in a disaster [22,23]. performance is a measure of how well an activity is done and can be measured in terms of accuracy, time, and quality. the vulnerability of Iran, with respect to natural disasters, especially earthquakes, necessitates an effective medical response to disasters. fourteen of the 23 hospitals were public and 9 were university hospitals. a tabletop exercise was developed for each participating hospital. participants discussed the problems at hand, in depth, and make decisions. the scoring according to the job action sheets was done by a group of three evaluators. the evaluators were medical doctors, who had worked in the field of HICS and HDP for at least 6 years. the same group of evaluators was used to for all 23 exercises. a t-test was used to compare means of HICS performance between hospitals with respect to affiliation, size and training courses. a p-value of less than 0.05, two tailed, was considered to be significant. the SPSS 17 (IBM, New York, USA) was used for data analysis. there are 28 standardized scenarios in the HICS-2006 including earthquake, fire and chemical emergencies. the content of these scenarios was extended with respect to geographical information, characteristics of the disaster, and process of influx of disaster casualties. the evaluators compared the participants' documented decisions with the content according to the job action sheets, as a measure of compatibility. the evaluators agreed on to what extent the duties in a job action sheet are provided by the documented decisions of the participant (HICS member) 23 hospitals participated in tabletop exercises and HICS performance history of advanced HICS training course* n (%) No 8 (35%) Yes 15 (65%) Hospital disaster plan n (%) Present 0 (0%) Hospital Command Centre n (%) No 21 (91%) Yes 2 (9%) Hospital size** n (%) Small 6 (26%) Medium 17 (74%) *HICS training modules **Small: less than 100 beds, Medium:100-400 beds The lowest total HICS score was 56 and the highest was 119 no significant difference in performance (P = 0.07) between small and medium hospitals. public affiliation was the only independent predictor of the HICS performance (P = 0.09) the performance at public hospitals was significantly higher than that of university hospitals. there are, to our knowledge, no previous studies on performance as measured by HICS and hospital affiliation. however, public hospitals did not appear superior to other hospitals. there are, however, to date, no studies on the effect of implementing a disaster plan on HICS performance. the HICS and its job action sheets are standardized and used worldwide. despite the lack of internationally accepted standards of performance for disaster health management the HICS does have international recognition. arbitrary cut-off levels require prospective outcome based studies. only one scenario was used for each hospital, which limits the results to these hazards. other hazards would be of interest, such as fire and power shortage. decision making performance of Hospital Incident Command System in five sections. results on each indicator given 0, 1, 2, or 3 points. click here for file (81KB, DOC)."}
