{"summary": "the study was conducted exclusively at the Sir Albert Sakzewski Virus Research Centre, Royal Children\u2019s Hospital and Health Service, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. the necessary ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Royal Children\u2019s Hospital. most (95.6%) samples were nasopharyngeal aspirates. quantitative real-time PCR was not performed because of limited applicability due to inherent variability in respiratory sample collection. presence of MCPyV in samples positive by real-time PCR was then confirmed by using partial large T antigen (LT3) and major capsid protein (VP1) conventional MCPyV detection PCR assays of Feng et al. (3). all MCPyV-positive patients were collected during the spring and early summer months (October\u2013December 2003) five (1.1%) of these samples originated from pediatric patients, which suggests early acquisition of virus. in fact, all 4 MCPyV-positive patients who were not immunosuppressed were 2 years of age. denovirus, WUPyV 1.6 y F Competent \u2013 Fever, convulsions *MCPyV, Merkel cell polyomavirus; Ct, cycle threshold; WU polyomavirus. we could not discern whether the higher frequency of detections in adults was representative of the general adult population.

MCPyV was detected in 1.3% of respiratory samples collected from symptomatic persons. both KIPyV (1,4) and WUPyV (2,4) have been found globally in respiratory specimens with a high prevalence of codetected viruses. however, clear evidence for a causal association with respiratory illness has yet to be identified. MCPyV found in respiratory secretions is similar to the viruses identified within Merkel cell carcinomas. whether and how the virus is translated from the respiratory tract to skin cells, and its role in the malignant transformation of Merkel cells are questions worthy of further investigation."}
