{"summary": "mycoplasma amphoriforme was isolated from a patient with primary antibody deficiency (PAD) with chronic bronchitis. it belongs to the same phylogenetic group as other human pathogenic Mycoplasma species, the pneumoniae group (1, 2). sputum samples were collected from patients attending the primary Immunodeficiency Clinic at the RFL. the age range of all PAD patients tested was 18 to 79 years. LRTI was defined as a new or worsening cough. control subjects recruited using the same exclusion criteria as previously described for patients. ages of patients ranged from 0 to 96 years, with a mean of 19.91 years. control organisms used to test specificity of the assays. bsiella sp. ATCC 700603, Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 6571, Escherichia coli NCTC 10418, Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC 10662, Legionella pneumophila NCTC 11192, Neisseria gonorrhoeae NCTC 12700, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv ATCC 27294 (Depart Respiratory samples from patients with PAD were inoculated immediately on mycoplasma Experience agar. incubated at 36\u00b0C in gas jars containing CO2 gas packs. a small number of cultures that had been stored at 4\u00b0C for less than 4 days were included. this has been shown previously not to affect the viability of M. amphoriforme. the samples were vortexed, cooled on ice, and centrifuged at 13,000 g for 2 min. the resulting supernatants were used for PCR. the DNA from respiratory samples was extracted using the easyMAG system. the oligonucleotides for the M. amphoriforme udg quantitative real-time PCR were designed and optimized. results were analyzed with the cycle threshold set at 0.03. samples that were positive both neat and at a 10-fold DNA dilution were considered positive. samples that were only positive either neat or at a 10-fold dilution were considered equivocal. phoriforme among patients attending the RFL Chest Clinic was deposited with GenBank and assigned accession number HM235442 to HM235446. rRNA sequences for the four positive samples were submitted to GenBank and assigned accession numbers HM235442 to HM235446. clinical samples from two hospitals were used in this study. LRTI was defined as a new or worsening cough and at least one other lower respiratory tract symptom for which there was no other explanation. patients excluded if they had underlying chronic suppurative lung disease (defined as bronchiectasis), tuberculosis, immunodeficiency, or previous study participation (in the previous 3 weeks) mycoplasma fermentans ATCC 23636, Mycoplasma faucium ATCC 25293, Mycoplasma fermentans ATCC 23114, Mycoplasma orale ATCC 23714, Mycoplasma pirum ATCC 25960, and Mycoplasma salivarium ATCC 23064 (Public Health England, United Kingdom); Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, Klebsiella sp. ATCC 700603, Staphylococcus au illus fumigatus (RIE SVC), Chlamydia pneumoniae SA2f (Clinical Microbiology Department, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, United Kingdom) the following viruses were included for evaluation of assay specificity. influenza A virus, influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV1 to -4), human metapneumovirus, human metapneumovirus, human metapneumo extraction of DNA was performed by using a Chelex-based extraction kit. pellets were washed three times with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended with PCR-grade water (5 the pellet volume), and vortexed with 10% Chelex (Sigma, Poole, United Kingdom) the oligonucleotides for the M. amphoriforme udg quantitative real-time PCR were designed and optimized. the oligonucleotides for the M. amphoriforme udg quantitative real-time PCR were designed and optimized. the specificity of the assay was confirmed by the amplification of 1 ng of DNA from the control organisms listed above, in duplicate. the identities of amplicons were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. samples positive both neat and at a 10-fold DNA dilution were considered positive. the 23S rRNA PCR was used for M. amphoriforme identification in RIE respiratory samples for viral screening. the DNA samples were pooled in groups of 10. M. amphoriforme culture, 16S rRNA PCR, and udg qPCR were performed on 281 sputum samples from 88 patients with PAD who attended the RFL Immunodeficiency Clinic. culture was performed on 278 samples, 16S rRNA PCR was done on 275 samples, and udg qPCR was performed on 263 samples. a total of 38 sputum samples from 37 patients attending the RFL Chest Clinic were tested. 17 had a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 14 had bronchiectasis, and 1 patient had both conditions. all four PCR-positive samples were taken from patients with clinical signs of acute LRTI. none had a history of travel, alcohol consumption, or steroid treatment. qPCR assays were screened for their specificity in silico and experimentally tested against the DNA of 35 isolates. both qPCR assays were positive only for M. amphoriforme. multiple samples tested positive for 11 of the 13 patients for which multiple samples were received. positive bacterial loads were 106 organisms per ml of sputum in at least one sample for 10 positive patients. Known respiratory pathogens were found in more M. amphoriforme-negative sputum samples (59%) than in M. amphoriforme-positive samples (24%). 17 patients had a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 14 had bronchiectasis and 1 patient had both conditions. culture results indicated normal respiratory tract flora in 15 samples, H. influenzae in 4 samples, 4 samples with S. aureus, and 15 samples with single isolates of Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, or Citrobacter sp. the respiratory samples screened for suspected LRTI were collected between 1 March 2011 and 11 March 2012. 23 samples from 19 patients (6 adults and 13 children) tested positive in the M. amphoriforme 23S qPCR. qPCRs were specific for M. amphoriforme as they were negative for all other tested species. the 16S rRNA PCR was positive for three mycoplasma-related species. there have been reports of its detection in respiratory samples. a single sample from one patient positive by the 16S rRNA PCR was negative by culture. the high incidence of M. amphoriforme in sputa of PAD patients suggests it may be an important cause of infection in this patient group. one throat swab from a patient was M. amphoriforme positive in this study. other respiratory pathogens, such as S. pneumoniae and viral pathogens, were detected when throat swabs were employed at their expected frequency. the results are important pilot data for the study of M. amphoriforme. these data provide support for M. amphoriforme as a primary respiratory pathogen. this paper provides a methodology that will assist other groups in diagnosing M. amphoriforme infection. it is only by increasing the number of patients identified with this organism. a sensitive detection method will improve detection if suboptimal samples are used. the 16S rRNA PCR and qPCR provided more sensitive detection than culture, identifying M. amphoriforme in 17 patients (25.5% positive samples) and 14 patients (24.3% positive samples), respectively. the detection rate of M. amphoriforme (5%) in patients with acute signs of LRTI was similar to that of other known respiratory pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae (6%), coronaviruses (6%), and parainfluenza viruses (4%) (5). it was notable that M. amphoriforme was not detected in control subjects, as these samples were exclusively throat swabs. longitudinal studies are now required to elucidate the periodicity of M. amphoriforme infection. positive results were mostly found in children (68% of positive patients) but this may reflect the distribution of the samples submitted for testing."}
