{"summary": "human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and 229E (HCoV-229E) belong to the alphacoronavirus genus, a member of the Coronaviridae family. coronaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses with the largest genome of approximately 27\u201331 kb in size. a total of 2,060 consenting outpatients who presented with acute URTI symptoms were recruited at the Primary Care Clinic of University Malaya Medical Center in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, between March 2012 and February 2013. nasopharyngeal swabs were transferred to the laboratory in universal transport media and stored at 80\u00b0C. gene fragment sequencing of the S (S1 domain), complete N, and partial 1a (nsp3) genes was performed for HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E specimens. the PCR mixture (25 L) contained cDNA, PCR buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.3], 50 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl, and 0.1% gelatin) the cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 minute, 54.5\u00b0C for 1 minute, 72\u00b0C for 1 minute, and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes. purified PCR products were sequenced using the ABI PRISM 3730XL DNA Analyzer.
