{"summary": "SFTSV is a novel bunyavirus classified into the genus Phlebovirus and family Bunyaviridae. it has been classified into the Genus Banyangvirus, Family Phenuiviridae and re-named as Huaiyangshan banyangvirus. in this review article, we have called it \u201cSFTSV\u201d. n et al., 2019) and Xinjiang, China (Zhu et al., 2019) indicating that the distribution of SFTSV in Southeast Asia might be much more extensive than expected. the case fatality rate of SFTS is found to vary between 6 and 30% in Japan and South Korea. agent cells Study design Strain of SFTSV IC50/90/99 CC50 References Ribavirin Vero Yield reduction Chinese strain (HB29) IC99 = 263 M >1,929 M Shimojima et al., 2014 Huh7 IC99 = 83 M U2OS IC99 = 78 M Vero Yield reduction Japanese strain (SPL030) IC99 = 424 M >1,929 M Huh7 IC Chinese strain IC50 = 98 M >250 M 2\u2032-Fluoro- 2\u2032-deoxycytidine Vero Yield reduction Chinese strain (HB29) IC90 = 3.7 M >320 M Smee et al. mice and hamsters deficient for the gene encoding signal transducer and the activator of transcription 2 (STAT2/) were found to be susceptible to SFTSV infection following subcutaneous inoculation. newborn mice and rats were susceptible to SFTSV infection when inoculated intracerebrally.

broad spectrum of antiviral activity against various viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, measles, herpesvirus, human immunodeficiency virus, Lassa virus, and [in combination with interferon (IFN-] hepatitis C virus. ribavirin suppressed SFTS replication, suggesting it was effective against various SFTSVs for at least 48 h after inoculation. ribavirin suppressed SFTS replication, suggesting it was effective against various SFTSVs for at least 48 h after inoculation. all IFNs showed dose-dependent inhibitory effects when used alone. the IC90 of IFN, IFN, and IFN was 29 U/ml, 24 U/ml, and that of ribavirin was 43 g/ml. ribavirin has shown a limited protective effect in lethal SFTSV challenges. ribavirin therapy was effective in reducing the case fatality rate from 6.25% (15/240 patients) to 1.16% (2/173 patients) in patients with viral loads of 1 106 copies/mL. favipiravir is converted to its active form, ribofuranosyl-5-triphosphate, by host enzymes. the intraperitoneal administration of favipiravir at a dose of 60 or 300 mg/kg/day for 5 days completely protected mice from death upon SFTSV infection. on the other hand, 40% of the mice treated with ribavirin (i.p.) lost body weight and died from SFTSV infection with reduction of the case fatality rate. of 10 M, including two antibacterial and antifungal disinfectants, hexachlorophene and triclosan. hexachlorophene was the most potent, with an IC50 of 1.3 0.3 M (RNA load) and 2.6 0.14 M (plaque reduction) hexachlorophene was the most potent, with an IC50 of 1.3 0.3 M (RNA load) and 2.6 0.14 M (plaque reduction) CCBs reduce intracellular Ca2+ level and are widely used for treating various cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, angina, and supraventricular arrhythmias. the antiviral activity of CCBs against ebolavirus (Sakurai et al., 2015), marburgvirus (Dewald et al., 2015), Junn virus (Lavanya et al., 2013), West Nile virus (Scherbik and Brinton, 2010), and the case fatality rate was decreased by >5-fold in the nifedipine-treated group (3.6%) compared with the general SFTS group (19.7%) or non-nifedipine treated group (20.8%) a significant decrease in the case fatality rate was also observed in the nifedipine-treated patients. the IC90 of 2\u2032-FdC against SFTSV was 3.7 M in an in vitro assay. this value was much lower than that of ribavirin (49.7 M) in the same study and favipiravir (22 M) in the same study. but all the mice treated with 2\u2032-FdC experienced substantial weight loss. single cup of coffee contains 70\u2013350 mg chlorogenic acid, the ester of caffeic acid. it exerts a variety of biological effects, including the suppression of cancer cells. amodiaquine was identified as a selective inhibitor against SFTSV replication. the CC50 and the IC50 of amodiaquine were >100 and 19.1 M respectively. a suckling mouse model showed that IFN- treatment prior to SFTSV infection significantly reduced mortality, protecting 25% of animals from death. all untreated mice died within 13 days of the SFTSV challenge. ribavirin suppressed SFTS replication, suggesting it was effective against various SFTSVs for at least 48 h after SFTSV inoculation. the IC90 of IFN, IFN, and ribavirin was 29 U/ml, 24 U/ml, and 12 ng/ml, respectively. a clinical study in china showed that the case fatality rate was similar between patients who received ribavirin and those who did not. the differences were not statistically significant, however, it was unexpectedly observed that the patients who received ribavirin therapy had lower platelet counts than those who did not. favipiravir inhibits viral RNA polymerase in the host cells. only a few reports have indicated resistance to favipiravir in vitro. favipiravir significantly inhibits SFTSV replication in vitro. oral administration of favipiravir showed similar efficacy to that of i.p. administration in a mouse model. treatment with favipiravir (300 or 150 mg/kg/day) provided complete protection against a lethal SFTSV challenge in a STAT2 knockout golden Syrian hamster model. hexachlorophene treatment interfered with SFTSV entry without affecting virus-host cell attachment to the cells and virus infectivity. it was predicted that hexachlorophene would bind to the deep hydrophobic pocket between domains I and III of the SFTSV Gc glycoprotein. treatment with benidipine hydrochloride or nifedipine inhibited SFTSV replication by reducing virus induced Ca2+ influx. nifedipine is one of the most widely used drugs for treating hypertension and atherosclerosis in china. 2\u2032-Fluoro-2\u2032-deoxycytidine 2\u2032-Fluoro-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (2\u2032-FdC) is a nucleoside inhibitor used in anticancer drugs. it inhibits various RNA and DNA viruses in vitro. the IC90 of 2\u2032-FdC against SFTSV was 3.7 M in an in vitro assay. treatment with 2\u2032-FdC or favipiravir significantly reduced the viral titers in the serum. the survival rate was 80 vs. 100% for 200- and 100-mg/kg/day treatments. the virus titer in the serum of 200 mg/kg/day-treated mice was higher than those receiving the 100-mg/kg/day treatment. amodiaquine Amodiaquine is a novel compound that is routinely prescribed as an antimalarial drug is reported to show antiviral effects against ebolavirus. the mechanism of inhibitory activity of amodiaquine against malaria remains unclear. type II IFN- stimulates macrophage and dendritic cells to induce direct antimicrobial activities by regulating antigen processing and presentation pathways. but macrophages and dendritic cells can also be stimulated to produce IFN- in vitro under certain conditions. the results of the clinical study conducted by Liu et al. (2013) discouraged us from considering ribavirin treatment for treating patients with SFTS. however, Li et al. (2018) reported that ribavirin is effective for early-stage patients with a low viral titer or for pretreatment of exposed individuals. retrospectively conducted clinical study suggested that nifedipine remarkably reduced the case fatality rate in SFTS patients. the dose used for in vivo mouse study (100 mg/kg/day) was extremely higher than the dose generally used for humans (0.2\u20131.5 mg/kg/day) nifedipine is administered consistently for patients with cardiac disease. amodiaquine and other halogen molecules effectively inhibited propagation of SFTSV in vitro. the efficacy of IFN- both in vitro and in vivo should be evaluated. a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing antigen completely protected mice from SFTSV infection (Dong et al., 2019). a DNA vaccine expressing antigens of SFTSV elicited both neutralizing antibody response and SFTSV-specific T cell response and protected aged-ferrets from the lethal SFTSV infection (Kwak et al., 2019). potential conflict of interest."}
