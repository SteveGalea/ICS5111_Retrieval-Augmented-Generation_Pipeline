{"summary": "zoonotic diseases are highly infectious and can cause pandemics. diseases like eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), western equine encephalitis (WEE) and Venezuelan-equine encephalitis (VEE) can be disseminated as aerosols. diseases like west Nile fever, Hendra, VS, VEE, EEE, JE, Rabies have the potential for spread and ability to cause disease in human. some experimental and observational evidence show that H3N8 influenza virus has infected man. a targeted, multidisciplinary effort is required to understand the risk factors for zoonosis. quine encephalitis (WEE), and Venezuelan-equine encephalitis (VEE) can be disseminated through aerosols and are highly infectious [6-8]. Vesicular stomatitis (VS) is prevalent in many countries of the world and has zoonotic potential. more than 1.8 million people have been infected in north american countries. the mortality rate in human varies from 3-15% and can reach up to 50% in clinically affected horses. horses, human and most other mammals rarely develop the infectious levels of viraemia and are dead-end hosts. few cases in human have been spread through blood transfusions, organ transplants, breast feeding and during pregnancy. the virus has also been isolated from other species of hard ticks in africa, Europe and Asia [36, 63, 64] genus Henipavirus of family Paramyxoviridae containing two members, Hendra and Nipah viruses. the potential for rapid spread and ability to cause disease in man has raised the concerns. up to 2016, 53 disease incidents affecting more than 70 horses and 7 human beings have been reported mainly in the east coast of australia. human infections range from mild influenza-like illness to fatal respiratory or neurological disease. infected people develop fever, headaches, myalgia, sore throat and a dry cough. viral genetic material has been recovered from nasal swabs from horses even after 2 days of experimental infection. the IND serogroup has three subtypes IND-1 (classical IND) IND-2 (cocal virus) and IND-3 (alagoas virus) the virus is endemic in south America, Central America, Southern Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. the disease has been reported across continents in south africa in 1886 and 1897 and France in years 1915 and 1917. the virus is zoonotic and causes flu-like symptoms characterized by fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, headache, retrobulbar pain, myalgia, sub-sternal pain, malaise, pharyngitis, conjunctivitis, and lymphadenitis in humans. the transmission is more likely by trans-cutaneous or transmucosal route. vesicular stomatitis like disease disabled 4000 horses during the Civil War in 1862. animals may become anorectic, lethargic and have pyrexia. ine encephalitis (EEE) is a rare but serious viral disease affecting horses and man. it is transmitted through mosquitoes and man and horses are dead-end hosts. the virus is closely related to Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus and Western equine encephalitis (WEE) virus. eighteen cases of Eastern equine encephalomyelitis occurred in six Brazilian states between 2005 and 2009. transmission of EEEV to mammals occurs via other mosquitoes. infected mammals do not circulate enough viruses in their blood. the enzootic strains are 1-D, 1-E and 1-F of subtype I, subtype II, four antigenic variants (A\u2013D) of subtype III and subtype IV\u2013VI. the enzootic viruses do not produce clinical encephalomyelitis in the equines normally. in atypical ecological niche, variant III-B has been isolated in the USA. primary vectors for the bird or rodent-mosquito life cycle are members of the Melanoconion subgenus (Culex cedecci) infections with both epizootic and enzootic variants are infectious to human beings and can occur in laboratory workers. the workers handling infectious VEE viruses or their antigens should take preventive measures including use of containment facilities. equine and human epizootic VEE viruses were subtype 1-C from Venezuela in 1993, 1995 and 1996 and Colombia in 1995. Countless cases in horses and 75,000-100,000 human cases with more than 300 fatal encephalitis cases occurred in central Colombia in 1960. WEEV is a recombinant between Sindbis and Eastern equine encephalitis like viruses. it has also been reported to cause disease in poultry, game birds and ratites. most people, especially infants and elderly people to lesser extent, may develop encephalitis. the 1970s saw 209 human cases; 87 were reported during the 1980s. only 4 cases in the 1990s, and no cases have been reported in the USA or Canada since 1998. the last documented human case in north America occurred in 1994. horses should be vaccinated 3\u20134 wk before foaling to induce colostral antibody. JE virus is widespread in eastern, south-eastern and southern Asian countries. it is most common in areas under paddy cultivation with pig rearing. JE sero-positivity among equines has been reported in various countries. symptoms may vary from moderate to high fever (41\u00b0C or higher) accompanied by profuse sweating and muscle tremors, aimless wandering, behavioural changes manifest by aggression, loss of vision, collapse, coma and death. encephalitis has invaded 21 rice-growing states of india. 103,389 cases have been reported in India, with 33,729 deaths. rabies cases have been reported across the globe in more than 150 countries. paralytic and dumb forms most common, whereas furious form is not as common as in other species. major clinical signs observed over the period include recumbency, hyperesthesia, loss of tail and anal sphincter tone, fever, ataxia and paresis of the hindquarters. authors could find considerable experimental and observational evidence that H3N8 equine influenza viruses have occasionally infected man. the likely cause of human pandemic in 1889 has also been considered to be a H3N8 EIV [181-183] serological studies of the people who lived from 1892 era have also demonstrated elevated antibodies against the virus. horses, human and most other mammals rarely develop the infectious levels of viraemia and are dead-end hosts. animals other than horses may be susceptible to WNV, but rarely become ill. the time between the bite of an infected mosquito and appearance of clinical signs ranges from 3 to 14 days. there can be sleepiness, dullness, listlessness, facial paralysis, difficulty in urination and defecation, and inability to rise. there is no effective treatment for clinical WNV infection in humans, horses or any other animal. fruit bats of the genus Eidolon, family Pteropodidae, have been found serologically positive for HeV antibodies indicating it\u2019s prevalence in Africa. there are no visible disease symptoms in fruit bats. the mortality rate in horses is about 75%. there are currently no drugs available to treat HeV infection. vaccine effectively checks the transmission of the disease from flying foxes to horses. VS has been reported in horses at about 800 premises in eight states. the virus is zoonotic and causes flu-like symptoms. symptoms include fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, headache. the transmission is more likely by trans-cutaneous or transmucosal route. endemic areas, Lutzomyia sp. (sand fly) is proven biologic vectors. black flies are the most likely biologic vector in the u.s. lesions around the coronary band may cause lameness and laminitis. animals usually recover completely within two weeks. mortality is rare. the disease is present in North, Central and South America and the Caribbean. ee virus (EEEV) was first isolated from infection horse brain in 1933. the human cases were identified first time in 1938 in the north-eastern United States. virus is introduced by mosquitoes, but feather picking and cannibalism contribute to the transmission of the disease within the flocks. clinically affected patients may have pyrexia, muscle pains, headache, photophobia, and seizures. the disease in horses is characterized by fever, anorexia, and severe depression. epizootic variants 1-AB and 1-C are thought to originate from mutations of the enzootic 1-D serotype. the enzootic strains are 1-D, 1-E and 1-F of subtype I, subtype II, four antigenic variants (A\u2013D) of subtype III and subtype IV\u2013VI. infections with VEEV may present, in both humans and horses, as either encephalitic disease or simply a febrile disease without profound neurologic signs. horses may die after a very acute course, even without any neurologic signs, but mortality in humans is generally low. equines are the key reservoir species for epizootic strains of VEEV that cause clinical disease in both horses and humans. the mortality rates in equines during epizootics have been 19-83%. equines may suddenly die or exhibit progressive central nervous system disorders. horses may die after a very acute course, even without neurologic signs. the two VEE vaccines, a modified-live vaccine (TC-83) and an inactivated adjuvant vaccine, have been used in field. the two VEE vaccines, a modified-live vaccine (TC-83) and an inactivated adjuvant vaccine, have been used. a small percentage of people, especially infants and elderly people, may develop encephalitis. about 5-15% of these encephalitis cases are fatal, and about 50% of surviving infants will have permanent brain damage. phalomyelitis occurs and may lead to neck stiffness, confusion, tonic-clonic seizures, somnolence, coma and death. phalomyelitis is caused by JE virus belonging to genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae. it is widespread in eastern, south-eastern and southern Asian countries. JE virus circulates throughout the year in tropical areas of Asia amongst birds, swine and mosquitoes. 3 billion people live in JEV-endemic countries in Asia where 68,000 cases are reported annually. horses are the primarily affected domestic animals and is a public health concern in Asia. morbidity rates reported from field cases vary from less than 1 to 1.4%. most infections are asymptomatic but can manifest as severe encephalitis, and with neurological sequelae in survivors. the first case of Japanese encephalitis was documented in 1871 in Japan. rabies cases have been reported across the globe in more than 150 countries. worldwide cases of human rabies are estimated to be 55,000 or more every year. rabies is relatively rare in horses and usually less than 100 cases are reported in the united states every year. survival is rare in clinically affected patients. exposure to rabies is less common in people handling equines compared to small animals or wildlife. zoonotic diseases like west Nile fever, Hendra, VS, VEE, EEE, JE, Rabies have the potential for spread and ability to cause disease in human. human-natural systems in which host-pathogen systems are nested make specific prevalence of disease emergence or epidemics inherently difficult to predict."}
