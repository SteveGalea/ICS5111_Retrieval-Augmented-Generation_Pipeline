{"summary": "mycoplasma pneumoniae is a major cause of respiratory infection in school-age children. extrapulmonary manifestations of M. pneumoniae infection are known to affect dermatologic, cardiovascular, neurologic, hematologic and hepatobiliary systems in children. however, acute cholestatic hepatitis without pulmonary involvement in children with M. pneumonia infection has rarely been reported. initial laboratory exams showed hemoglobin of 13.1 g/dL, hematocrit 37.0%, white blood cell count of 6,310/mm3 with 72% neutrophils, 11% lymphocytes, 2% monocytes, and platelet count of 89,000/mm3. total serum protein and albumin decreased to 5.5 g/dL (normal range, 6.0-8.2 g/dL) and 3.3 g/dL (normal range, 3.5-5.2 ized ratio (INR; normal range, 0.90-1.10 INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 95.5 seconds (normal range, 29.1-41.9 seconds), fibrinogen of 99 mg/dL (normal range, 182-380 mg/dL), antithrombin III activity of 75% (normal range, 83-123%) other laboratory exams including blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, electrolytes, ammonia, lactic acid, amy autoantibodies including anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and anti-mitochondrial antibody were all negative. serum levels for cardiac troponin I, CK-MB, and CK-BB were all in normal range. total serum bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL (normal range, 0-1.5 mg/dL), serum albumin of 3.8 g/dL (normal range, 6.0-8.2 g/dL), CK of 457 IU/dL (normal range, 24-204 IU/dL), and LD of 3,919 IU/L (normal range, 240-480 IU/L) the patient was discharged on the eighth hospital day without any complaints nor any pneumonia is the hallmark of M. pneumoniae infection. cases of extrapulmonary manifestations presenting in the absence of pneumonia have been rarely reported in both children and adults. pathomechanism of how extrapulmonary manifestations can occur in the absence of pneumonia remains unknown. onset hepatitis may be related with an indirect-type mechanism. cross-reactive antibodies induced by M. pneumoniae interact with sialo-oligosaccharides on hepatic cells. fever over 38\u00b0C developed concurrently with abdominal pain 4 days after resolution of initial body temperature elevation. the development of DIC in M. pneumoniae infection is related with the vascular occlusion type mechanism in the presence of a systemic hypercoagulable state. the main basis of treatment in cases of extrapulmonary manifestations associated with M. pneumoniae infection is antibiotics effective against the organism. antibiotics such as macrolides should be administered to reduce the amount of M. pneumoniae infected cells. we report the first pediatric case of M. pneumoniae infection in a child presenting with acute cholestatic hepatitis in the absence of pneumonia. the clinical course and concurrent extrapulmonary manifestations indicate that an indirect-type plus a vascular occlusion type mechanism may have played a role in the pathomechanism of extrapulmonary manifestations in our case."}
