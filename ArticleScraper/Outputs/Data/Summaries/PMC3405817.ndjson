{"summary": "Isatis indigotica is an herb distributed widely in china. it is traditionally used in clinical treatment of viral diseases like encephalitis. it is associated with antiviral activity against influenza A, hepatitis, and encephalitis. becco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), as well as BHK-21 cells used to determine JEV plaques grown in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) medium containing DMSO (0.005, 0.05, 0.5, or 5%), I. indigotica extracts or marker compounds were added and incubated for another 48 hours. viability was estimated as ratio of living/total cell counts. BHK-21 cell monolayer was infected with JEV at 100 pfu for 1 h, followed by 1 h incubation with drug solutions and overlaid with MEM medium containing 1.1% methylcellulose for viral plaque assays. 0.05, or 0.5%), I. indigotica extract (0, 1, 10, and 100 g/mL), or marker compound (0, 0.1, 1, and 10 g/mL), then immediately incubated with BHK-21 cell monolayer at 4\u00b0C to allow attachment. each extract/virus or compound/virus mixture was removed, cell monolayer washed with cold PBS and overlaid with MEM medium containing 1.1% methylcellulose. two additional groups were infected with JEV and received PBS or DMSO (0.05%) treatment as solvent controls. survival rates were monitored every day for one week. otica like adenosine, betulin, indigo, indirubin, tryptanthrin, lupeol, and 2-benzoxazolinone were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO.) stock solution of marker compounds (20 mg/mL) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), diluted with PBS. DMSO (0.005%, 0.05%, 0.5%, and 5% a 10-fold serial dilution of cultured medium was added into the well of BHK-21 cell monolayer at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and overlaid with MEM medium containing 1.1% methylcellulose. viral plaques stained with naphthol blue-black dye after three-day incubation. infected with JEV at 100 pfu for 1 h followed by 1 h incubation with drug solutions and overlaid with MEM medium containing 1.1% methylcellulose. inhibitory concentration showing 50% JEV plaque reduction (IC50) was determined by computer program. mice were intracerebrally infected with 1 105 pfu of virulent JEV strain Beijing-1. two additional groups were infected with JEV and received PBS or DMSO (0.05%) treatment as solvent controls. survival rates were monitored every day for one week. CC50 values of indigo and indirubin varied from 26.88 g/mL (BHK-21 cells treated with indigo) to 57.47 g/mL (BHK-21 cells treated with indirubin) compared to ethyl acetate and methanol extracts, indigo and indirubin manifested low toxicity to such cells. I. indigotica extract, indigo and indirubins showed dose-dependent inhibition of JEV replication in HL-CZ promonocytic cells. indigo (10 g/mL) and indirubin (10 g/mL) showed virus yield reduced by approximately 40% after 24 h infection. plaque reduction values of 91.57 g/mL for ethyl acetate extract, 78.47 g/mL for methanol extract, 37.49 g/mL for indigo, and 13.68 g/mL for indirubin. both indigo and indirubin tallied a therapeutic index (CC50/IC50) of >10. indigo and indirubin pretreated before JEV adsorption showed antiviral activity similar to simultaneous treatment assay. posttreatment of I. indigotica extracts, indigo and indirubin was ineffective in antiviral activity after virus entry. I. indigotica extracts (a) indigo and indirubin (b) were serially diluted and mixed with JEV. each mixture incubated 1 h with BHK-21 cell monolayers at 4\u00b0C. then virus/compound mixture was removed and cell monolayer washed with cold PBS. each virus/compound mixture was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. the virus/compound mixture was added onto the cell monolayer at 37\u00b0C for another 1 h. diluted solutions of indigo and indirubin contained 0.0005% 0.005%, 0.05%, 0.5%, and 5% DMSO. cells were also treated with serial dilution of DMSO as solvent control.
