{"summary": "the effective control of west Nile (WN), bluetongue (BT), epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) and Rift Valley fever (RVFV) depends on a thorough understanding of the possible implications of dromedaries in the replication or dissemination of the west Nile virus (WNV), bluetongue virus (BTV), epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) and Rift Valley fever (RVFV) Tunisi clinical cases in cattle were reported in countries surrounding the Mediterranean Basin. the aim of the present study was to provide the first serological investigation of four emerging vector-borne diseases in two groups of dromedaries in Tunisia. sera were screened for the presence of group-specific BTV antibodies. the usutu virus (USUV)- and WNV-specific antibodies were detected using a commercially available competition ELISA. dromedaries seem to act as reservoirs, possibly playing a role in the spread of the disease by helping the virus to get through the geographic barrier. there is scarce information about the clinical manifestations of BT in dromedaries. south american camels are susceptible to BTV, but they develop only a mild form of the disease. the presence of the RVF competent vector C. pipiens and Aedes caspius in oases makes this ecosystem favourable for RVF transmission in Tunisia where Aedes could be responsible for the initiation of an outbreak. for EHDV, dromedaries seem not to be involved in the disease transmission.
