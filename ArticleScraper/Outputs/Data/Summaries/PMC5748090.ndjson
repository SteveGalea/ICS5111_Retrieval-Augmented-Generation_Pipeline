{"summary": "study aims to describe demographical and clinical characteristics of elderly nursing home residents with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) during four winter seasons. seventeen NHs with at least one ARI resident in corsica, france, were included. 61 (57%) were positive for at least one of the 21 respiratory agents. NHs in corsica were invited to participate in a daily epidemiological and microbiological surveillance study for ARIs among residents during four consecutive winter seasons. a case of ARI was defined as a person developing sudden onset of any constitutional symptom, in addition to any respiratory sign. the risk factors associated with severe influenza infection were chronic disease and obesity (Body Mass Index > 40 kg/m2) the nasopharyngeal swabs and CRFs were sent by mail daily to the virology laboratory of the university of corsica. a case of ARI was defined as a person developing sudden onset of any constitutional symptom, in addition to any respiratory sign. a case of ARI was defined as a person developing sudden onset of any constitutional symptom. a case of ARI was defined as a person developing sudden onset of any constitutional symptom, in addition to any respiratory sign. nasopharyngeal swabs and CRFs were sent to the virology laboratory of the university of corsica. seventeen NHs enrolled at least one ARI resident, with a total catchment population of 1113 and a mean of 65.5 (min = 56.7 and max = 75.1). human coronaviruses NL63 (HCoV-NL63), 229E (HCoV 229E), OC43 (HCoV-OC43), HKU1 (HCoV HKU1), RSV A/B, HMPV A/B, HAdV, HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HPIV-3, and HPIV-4, human bocavirus (HBoV), enterovirus (EV), human parechovirus (HPeV), and my 107 residents with ARI were enrolled from 17 sentinel NHs. 97 (90.6%) residents had been vaccinated against seasonal influenza. fever (82;76.6%), cough (96;89.7%), and asthenia (58; 54.2%) were the most common symptoms. 61 (57%) were positive for at least one of the 21 target respiratory pathogens screened. four (38.3%) had influenza: 38 (92%) were positive for influenza A (100% A(H3N2) and three (8%) for influenza B/Victori. influenza A(H3N2) circulated in NHs in all four winter seasons. 73.7% of 38 patients with influenza A(H3N2) accounted for 73.7% of the 38 patients. the death rate was significantly more common among ARI residents infected with influenza A(H3N2) than among those with noninfluenza A(H3N2) (p = 0.004), those with respiratory viruses other than influenza (p = 0.002) and those without any identified etiology (p = 0.02). a significant difference in the death rate was observed between ARI residents who tested positive for influenza A(H3N2) and those with noninfluenza A(H3N 33 (71.7) 0.41 Seasonal influenza vaccination 36 (94.7) 61 (88.4) 0.1 18 (90) 0.6 40 (86.9) 0.1 Risk factors 19 (50.0) 36 (52.1) 0.4 13 (65) 0.4 23 (50.0) 0.6 Symptoms Fever 35 (92.1) 47 (68.1) 0.004 12 (60) 0.002 33 (71.7) 0.02 Cough 32 (84.2) 64 (92.7) 0.3 19 (95) 0.4 42 (91.3) 0.2 Headaches the highest number of positive cases was identified in January (week 4). of the 18 positive cases, 11 were influenza A(H3N2) (detected during the 2016/2017 influenza outbreak), and seven were HRV (detected during the 2015/2016 influenza outbreak). the outbreak lasted for 7 days, with an attack rate of 13.7% (5/37) among exposed residents. six residents had been hospitalized (5.6%), and three (2.8%) died. the most common symptoms were fever (82; 76.6%) and cough (96; 89.7%) 61 (57%) were positive for at least one of the 21 target respiratory pathogens screened. forty-one (38.3%) had influenza: 38 (92%) were positive for influenza A (100% A(H3N2)) and three (8%) for influenza B/Victoria. females (median age = 88.4 years; range, 63\u2013103 years) accounted for 73.7% of the 38 patients with influenza A(H3N2) infection. the clinical features were further examined by comparing those with confirmed influenza A(H3N2) with those with noninfluenza A(H3N2), those with respiratory viruses other than influenza (A and B) and those without any identified etiology. 16 2 (10) 0.7 2 (4.3) 0.08 80\u201389 16 (42.1) 31 (44.9) 0.8 11 (55) 0.4 19 (41.3) 0.56 90 15 (39.4) 31 (44.9) 0.8 5 (25) 0.3 24 (52.2) 0.17 Gender Female 28 (73.7) 52 (75.3) 0.4 16 (80) 0.8 33 (71.7) 0.41 Seasonal influenza vaccination 36 (94.7) 61 (88.4) 0.1 18 (90) 0.6 40 (86.9) the highest number of positive cases was identified in January (week 4) of the 18 positive cases, 11 were influenza A(H3N2) (detected during the 2016/2017 influenza outbreak), and seven were HRV (detected during the 2015/2016 influenza outbreak) the outbreak, which was limited to residents, lasted for 7 days, with an attack rate of 13.7% (5/37) among exposed residents. the most frequently detected respiratory virus was influenza A(H3N2), even though the seasonal influenza vaccination rate was 90% among the ARI residents. no coinfections were detected in a number of previous studies. a high-dose inactivated split-virus influenza vaccine was found to be more efficacious than was a standard dose for preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza illness in adults 65 years of age [23]. influenza B/Victoria viruses, which dominated during the 2015/2016 influenza outbreak [24], were not included in the trivalent influenza seasonal vaccine. the presence of fever remained important in the elderly to retain specificity for the diagnosis of influenza A(H3N2). this result is in agreement with those from previous studies [11, 29\u201331], in which fever was associated with influenza among older adults. the circulation of influenza virus, in particular subtype A(H3N2), has been shown to be the main seasonal driver of excess mortality. conflicts of interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest."}
