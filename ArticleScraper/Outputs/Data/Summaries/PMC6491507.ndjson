{"summary": "porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly virulent re-emerging enteric coronavirus that causes acute diarrhea, dehydration, and death in neonatal piglets (3). in adult pigs, PEDV causes watery diarrhea, depression, and anorexia as well as reduced reproductive performance (1\u20133) maternal vaccination increases the amount of passively transferred protective Abs in milk, induced via the gut-MG-sIgA axis. this is the strategy used to protect suckling piglets from PEDV immediately after birth. cytokines increase to support fetal growth and development to prevent rejection of the fetus (21\u201324) in the third trimester of gestation, the immunoregulatory environment is retained until immediately prior to parturition. proinflammatory and tissue repair factors increase, promoting the contraction of the uterus and expulsion of the fetus and placenta (18). results Overall summary of results and significance for the major immune and PEDV protection parameters assessed. tal enteric disease affects multiple maternal systemic immune parameters prepartum, including natural killer (NK) cells, cytokines, B cells, and PEDV Abs and antibody secreting cells. systemic Elevated serum TGF- in 2nd trimester gilts may enhance PEDV B cell/antibody (Ab) responses. Gilt blood CD2CD21+ B cell frequency 2nd and 3rd trimester gilts had significantly higher mean frequencies of blood 4+7+ B cells B cell. systemic Increased blood PEDV IgA and IgG ASCs in 2nd trimester gilts had significantly higher mean PEDV IgA, IgG, and VN piglets Gilt colostrum/milk PEDV IgA and VN Abs 2nd trimester gilts had significantly higher mean colostrum/milk PEDV IgA and VN Abs B cell/Abs, colostrum/milk Increased colostrum/milk PEDV IgA and VN Abs in 2nd trimester gilts. third trimester gilts had significantly higher PEDV RNA shedding titers at PID 2 compared with second trimester gilts. third trimester gilts had significantly higher PEDV RNA shedding titers at PID 2 compared with second trimester gilts. third trimester gilts were the only treatment group with clinical diarrhea (mean fecal consistency score of >1) third trimester gilts had significantly higher porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) RNA shedding titers at post infection day (PID) 2 compared with second trimester gilts. third trimester gilts had numerically higher mean concentrations of serum proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interferon (IFN)- and IL-17 at PID 12\u201317 compared with first and second trimester gilts. it is unlikely changes in serum cytokine concentrations were due to T cells as the frequency of circulating CD4+ or CD8+ cells did not significantly differ between treatment groups. second trimester gilts had significantly higher circulating PEDV IgA and IgG ASCs at PID 12\u201317 compared with first and third trimester gilts. PEDV IgA Ab titers were significantly higher in second trimester gilts at PID 6\u20138 compared with first and third trimester gilts. serum IL-6, a cytokine essential for Ab production (38), was numerically higher at PID 0 and 6\u20138 in second trimester compared with first and third trimester gilts. no significant differences were observed for serum PEDV IgG or VN Ab titers within the first 2 weeks post-PEDV infection. uniform GDs, circulating PEDV IgA and IgG ASCs, Abs and VN Abs were compared at GD 82\u201395, 98\u2013102, and 104\u2013114 in first, second, and third trimester PEDV-infected gilts. second trimester gilts had significantly higher serum PEDV IgA Ab titers compared with first trimester gilts at GD 82\u201395, 98\u2013102, and 104\u2013114 second trimester gilts maintained elevated circulating PEDV specific IgA and IgG antibody secreting cells (ASCs) and serum PEDV specific IgA, IgG and virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies (Abs) in late pregnancy. first trimester gilts had a delayed increase in 4+7+. third trimester gilts had numerically elevated frequencies of circulating 4+7+ B lymphocytes. the mean frequencies of circulating chemokine receptor type 10 (CCR10+) B lymphocytes were also measured post PEDV infection. piglets were challenged with PEDV at 3\u20135 days of age. second trimester gilts provided intermediate protection. second trimester litters gained significantly more weight than all other treatment groups starting at post challenge day. lactogenic immune protection coincided with decreased PEDV RNA shedding titers. mean peak titers were 6.1 0.2 log10 copies/ml, 7.8 0.3 log10 copies/ml, 9.1 0.3 log10 copies/ml, and 10.1.2 log10 copies/ml for second, first, third, and mock litters. weights were normalized by dividing daily weight (lbs.) by PCD 0 weight (lbs.) Piglet PEDV RNA shedding titers were determined by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and expressed as log10 copies/ml. Piglet diarrhea was determined by fecal consistency score >1. circulating PEDV IgA and IgG Abs at PCD 0 were positively correlated with survival rates post piglet PEDV challenge. second trimester litters had the highest peak titers of circulating PEDV IgA and IgG antibodies (Abs) correlating with piglet protection post PEDV challenge. milk PEDV IgG ASCs decreased significantly throughout lactation. similar to ASCs, PEDV IgA and IgG Abs decreased significantly throughout the study. antibodies (Abs) and PEDV virus neutralizing (VN) Abs in colostrum/milk were isolated and added to PEDV ELISPOT plates. whey PEDV (C) IgA and (D) IgG Abs were determined by ELISA. whey PEDV VN Ab responses were determined by VN Ab assay. first, second and third trimester PEDV-infected gilts had significantly higher numbers of PEDV Ab+ cells per microscopic field in the MG compared with mock gilts post piglet challenge. mock gilts had similar or higher mean numbers of IgA and IgG ASC in the spleen, mesenteric lymph node (MLN), and ileum compared with first, second, and third trimester gilts. maternal systemic immune parameters prepartum, including natural killer (NK) cells, cytokines, B cells, and PEDV Abs and antibody secreting cells (ASCs) significantly increased PEDV IgA (colostrum and milk) and IgG (colostrum only) ASCs and PEDV IgA Abs and VN Abs. 4+7+ B cells B cell, systemic Increased circulating frequencies of 4+7+ B cells in 2nd/3rd trimester gilts may facilitate trafficking to the mammary gland Gilt blood CD2CD21+ (activated and/or primed) B cells, systemic Circulating frequencies of CD2CD21+ B cells increase with gestational stage. /milk PEDV IgA and VN Abs 2nd trimester gilts had significantly higher mean colostrum/milk PEDV IgA and VN Abs B cell/Abs. colostrum/milk Increased colostrum/milk PEDV IgA and VN Abs in 2nd trimester gilts is correlated with lactogenic immune protection in piglets III. third trimester gilts had significantly higher PEDV RNA shedding titers at PID 2 compared with second trimester gilts. second trimester gilts had delayed onset of PEDV RNA shedding compared with first and third trimester gilts. third trimester gilts had significantly higher porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) RNA shedding titers at post infection day (PID) 2 compared with second trimester gilts. significantly greater PEDV-induced diarrhea at PID 4 compared with first and second trimester gilts. third trimester gilts had numerically higher mean concentrations of serum proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interferon (IFN)- and IL-17 at PID 12\u201317 compared with first and second trimester gilts. this time point corresponds to gestation day (GD) 104\u2013114 in third trimester gilts, suggesting innate, and proinflammatory cytokines increase immediately prior to parturition in swine. second trimester gilts had significantly higher circulating PEDV IgA and IgG ASCs at PID 12\u201317 compared with first and third trimester gilts. serum TGF-, a cytokine important for IgA class-switching, was significantly higher at PID 0 and remained numerically higher at PID 0 and 6\u20138 in second compared with first and third trimester gilts. second trimester gilts had significantly increased circulating PEDV specific IgA and IgG antibody secreting cells (ASCs) at post infection day (PID) 12\u201317, PEDV specific IgA antibodies (Abs) at PID 6\u20138 and concentrations of transforming growth factor (TGF)- at PID 0 compared with first and third trimester gilts. second trimester gilts had significantly higher circulating PEDV IgA and IgG ASCs at GD 82\u201395 and 98\u2013102. PEDV IgA ASCs consistently higher than PEDV IgG ASCs in blood in first, second and third trimester gilts at GD 82\u201395, 98\u2013102, and 104\u2013114. second trimester gilts maintained elevated circulating PEDV specific IgA and IgG antibody secreting cells (ASCs) and serum PEDV specific IgA, IgG and virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies (Abs) in late pregnancy. serum PEDV VN Ab responses were determined by ELISA. the mean frequencies of circulating chemokine receptor type 10 (CCR10+) B lymphocytes were also measured post PEDV infection. no statistical differences were observed at PID 0, 6\u20138 or 12\u201317. third trimester gilts had significantly higher frequencies of circulating CCR10+ B lymphocytes at GD 98\u2013102 (PID 6\u20138) compared with second and first trimester and mock gilts. piglets were challenged with PEDV at 3\u20135 days of age. second trimester gilts provided intermediate protection. third trimester gilts provided the least amount of protection. 0.3 log10 copies/ml, 10.1.2 log10 copies/ml for second, first, third, and mock litters. diarrhea scores were significantly lower in second trimester litters. first trimester litters had diarrhea, but it was delayed and significantly lower than third trimester litters at PCD 2\u20135.
