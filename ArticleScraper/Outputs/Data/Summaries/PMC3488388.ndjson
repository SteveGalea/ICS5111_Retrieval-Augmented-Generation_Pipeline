{"summary": "pregnant women are at increased risk when infected with either pandemic or seasonal influenza. women who received delayed treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors more likely to develop severe disease and preterm births. postpartum woman reported cough, shortness of breath, myalgia, and fever until 38.3\u00b0C. initial chest radiograph revealed bilateral alveolar infiltrates and a dense area of consolidation with a small pleural reaction in the left hilar region. a broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage was initiated, with the support of oxygen therapy and bronchodilators. a chest computed tomography confirmed bilateral basilar pulmonary consolidation, consistent with pneumonic infiltrates. the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation on day 15 and transferred to the obstetrical floor the following days. she continued to recover uneventfully and was discharged with her healthy newborn on day 20. the median time from onset of symptoms to hospitalization ranges from 2 to 6 days. RIDT detects influenza viral nucleoprotein antigen and is used as screening tool. a specific diagnosis of influenza A (H1N1) cannot be established. treatment with oseltamivir should commence as soon as possible. antiviral treatment should be provided even if started later than 48 h. new mothers should be considered as high risk and treated as such until 2 weeks postpartum. pregnant women should be referred for ICU assessment if FiO2 of >0.5 or oxygen at a rate of 10 L/min is required to maintain the SpO2 at 92%. RT-PCR or viral culture should be performed as confirmatory testing. um woman illustrates the increased risk of life threatening complications in this group. a higher uptake of prevention strategies may result in improved survival in future epidemics."}
