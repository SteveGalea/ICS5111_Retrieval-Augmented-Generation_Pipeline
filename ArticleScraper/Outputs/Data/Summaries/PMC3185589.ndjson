{"summary": "the ideal animal model for the study of a human disease is one which utilizes a route of infection that mimics the natural transmission of the pathogen. factors which subsequently allow more detailed inferences about disease pathogenesis include the availability of reagents to evaluate host innate and adaptive immune responses to the pathogen. exposure leading to infection is believed to occur via a respiratory route, with subsequent progressive viremias/lymphemia. percutaneous exposure, also leading to generalized rash formation, has also been described for both viral infections. disease pathogenesis has been conjectured and modeled from animal studies. 6, of the 33 deaths among 338 patients, all occurred in unvaccinated children less than eight years of age. the development of small animal models for the study of monkeypox virus (MPXV) has been quite extensive for the relatively short period of time this pathogen has been known. ified skin/intradermal 105 Not provided Localized lesion in addition to disseminated rash for some animals NA 0 NA Oral >109 NA No rash NA 0 NA 10 day old rabbits [2] Outbred High WA Oral 106 4\u20136 Disseminated rash __ 85 4\u201314 days IN 106 Not provided No rash __ 83 4\u20135 days Adult white rats [2] Outbred Medium WA IN 101 to 103 3\u20135 No rash 0.35 pfu CB 0.46 pfu WA 100 6\u201311 days Prairie dogs [13\u201315] Outbred Low WA IP 105.1 4 No rash __ 100 8\u201311 days IN 105.1 4 Lesions on lips/tongue __ 60 11\u201314 days WA, CB IN 104.5 9\u201312 days until rash Disseminated rash __ WA: 1.29 105 pfu CB: 5.9 inbred high CB IN 104 Not provided No rash 680 pfu 100 8\u201310 days IP 103 Not provided No rash 14 pfu 100 6\u20138 days WA IN 104 Not provided No rash __ 92 7\u201310 days IN 2 3 No rash 12 pfu 38 12.3 5 days IN 200\u20132000 3 days No rash 12 pfu 100 7.9 1 and 8.7 1 Guinea pigs and golden hamsters were relatively resistant to two day old rabbits were highly susceptible to infection by intracutaneous inoculation. intracerebral inoculation was 100% fatal and intratesticular inoculation with MPXV was also pathogenic in rabbits. rat species including white rats, cotton rats and multimammate rats have been challenged with MPXV. skin lesions did not develop on any animals; symptoms included fever, inactivity, inappetence, rhinitis, cough and difficulty breathing. infection was 100% lethal by day 7 or 8 p.i. regardless of inoculation route. a follow-up study compared the pathogenesis of the two MPVX clades in the ground squirrel model. the onset of severe respiratory distress was more rapid and uniform for the Congo Basin MPXV challenged animals. a trend of increasing viral titers in oropharyngeal swabs with increasing viral inoculums dose was apparent for both MPXV strains. the duration of MPXV DNA and viral shedding tended to occur earlier, attain higher levels, and persist longer for Congo Basin challenged animals. in early studies, white mice were challenged via intracerebral, IN, IP, FP, oral or intradermal (ID) inoculation with a west African strain of MPXV. intracerebral inoculation was 100% fatal in adult white mice as was IN inoculation of suckling mice. inbred laboratory mouse strains have also been studied by several groups. mice developed rough coats, decreased activity but cleared infection within 10 days p.i. /c mice developed similar symptoms, but resulted in 100% mortality by day 9 p.i. or day 11 p.i. the calculated LD50 for the Congo Basin clade was 680 pfu. mice with 105 or 106 pfu of a west African MPXV strain resulted in rapid weight loss and 100% mortality by day 8 p.i. the calculated LD50 was 7,600 pfu, more than a log higher than for the Congo Basin clade. at day 7, a sampling of placebo-treated animals showed significant leukocytosis, transaminitis, and coagulopathy. at this time, between 107 and 108 pfu /mL of infectious MPXV was observed in 10% organ homogenates of liver, spleen and lung. infected africa dormice with a lethal challenge of Congo Basin clade virus MPXV-ZAI-79 via an IN route of infection to evaluate the efficacy of Cidofovir as post exposure prophylaxis. animals treated with cidofovir had a mortality rate of 19% (7/36), whereas vehicle treated animals all succumbed to disease. over 25% total body weight loss, and mortality was observed on or prior to day 10 p.i. in untreated animals. all C57BL/6 stat-/- mice that were treated with drug survived infection, demonstrated 10% body weight loss between days 10 and 20. the challenge dose was 3.8 105, equal to 65 LD50 for the prairie dog model. animals were divided into three treatment groups; prophylactic (day 0), post exposure (day 3) and therapeutic. the evaluation of an antiviral in the context of an impaired immune system enables better understanding of therapeutic use in a particular immunosuppressed population. pathogen host range, especially if not a simple issue of receptor utilization, can confound the ability to interpret, and extrapolate to the human."}
