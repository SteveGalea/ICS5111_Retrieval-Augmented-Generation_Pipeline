{"summary": "88 study patients with confirmed H1N1 by quantitative RT-PCR were recruited. 68 patients harbored one to three pathogens, mostly from Streptococcus, Haemophilus, Neisseria, and Pseudomonas. influenza A viruses are the main pathogens responsible for the onset of epidemics because of their evolving nature. they are RNA viruses that have a high mutation rate and ability to make \u201cdrift\u201d changes. however, only influenza A viruses are responsible for pandemics. influenza cases with bacterial coinfections are similar to those with severe influenza, but the latter may have a higher risk of death. identification of coinfections should be considered in patients with influenza-like illness (ILI), presenting symptoms suggestive of pneumonia. the most commonly isolated bacterial pathogens are those that colonize the nasopharynx, and this complex of virus\u2013bacteria contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of the disease. the precise identification of infectious pathogens responsible for acute respiratory infections is a critical factor for proper treatment of the disease and control during outbreaks. total of 88 study patients with confirmed H1N1 by quantitative qRT-PCR from six health districts of Oaxaca in Mexico were examined for other microbial infections. the study meets the operational definition criteria for ILI cases recommended by the world health organization. RNA extraction was completed using an automated protocol (Qiagen; Qiagen) and an elution volume of 60 L. the RNA to be used as template was stored at 80\u00b0C until testing.

RT was performed in order to obtain cDNA. the reaction was ended using 24 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds. a final elution volume of 25 L was stored at 4\u00b0C. a new PCR tube was used to perform

labeling. the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was detected and confirmed by qRT-PCR in a total of 88 clinical samples from study patients showing ILI in Oaxaca, Mexico. a total of 71 patients presented copathogens with bacteria and/or viruses other than influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. the most prevalent species of bacteria found (P0.05) were S. pneumonia (39.8%), H. influenzae (32.9%), N. meningitidis (25%), and S. mitis (23.9%). a few patients harbored other species of bacteria. the 18 bacteria found in the 88 H1N1 patients of Oaxaca, Mexico. the most common were fever in 85 patients (96%), impaired general health in 85 (96%), cough in 84 (95%), headache and myalgia in 75 (85%), rhinorrhea in 72 (82%), odynophagia in 72 (65%), cold in 56 (65%), and nasal congestion in 52 (59%). participants 0.4\u201330 years old infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and microbial infection. six of the 88 patients experienced disease severity and were admitted to the intensive care unit. the standard qRT-PCR protocol was used to identify the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in conjunction with a microarray assay. the microarray assay has been shown to be capable of detecting in a single sample up to 30 viruses and bacteria that may produce ILI. there was a significantly high prevalence rate of influenza patients with one and three associated pathogens. there were only three cases where the pandemic virus was found in coinfection with parainfluenza 3 and coxsackie virus. the results are consistent with other studies that have reported lower rates of viral coinfections with respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, influenza B virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus without significant complications. a total of 21 of 88 H1N1 patients harbored S. mitis. an increase in the number of cases could have hampered the efficacy of the viral neuraminidase inhibitor drug. 88 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 patients in xaca, Mexico Age Sex Evolution of patient clinical status Symptoms
