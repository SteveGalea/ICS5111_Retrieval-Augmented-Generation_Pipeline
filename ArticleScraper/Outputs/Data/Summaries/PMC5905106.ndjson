{"summary": "the role of fecal S100A12 in parasite and viral infections is difficult to study in traditional animal models due to the lack of S100A12 expression in rodents. the aim of this study was to evaluate fecal S100A12 concentrations in a cohort of puppies with intestinal parasites. 100A12 concentrations in dogs shedding Cystoisospora spp. (P = 0.0384) and in dogs infected with parvovirus (P = 0.0277) shedding of any single enteropathogen did not affect fecal S100A12 concentrations in multivariate analysis."}
