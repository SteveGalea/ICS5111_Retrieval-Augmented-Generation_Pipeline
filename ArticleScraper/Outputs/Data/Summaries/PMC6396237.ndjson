{"summary": "in the breeding sector, PRRS causes abortions, stillborns, mummified piglets, pre-weaning mortality, and embryonic death. it was estimated that $302 million (45%) out of the annual $663 million in costs associated with problems caused by PRRS are due to losses in the breeding sector. sero et al. (2014) demonstrated that antibody level measured as sample-to-positive (S/P) ratio from a commercial IDEXX ELISA analysis of blood samples taken after a PRRS infection was highly heritable (0.45) and had moderate-to-strong genetic correlations with many reproduction traits during the outbreak. reaction norm models are an application of random regression (longitudinal) models that regress the response variable on a continuous environmental variable. these models yield estimates of breeding values for an intercept term that is highly correlated to estimates of breeding values from routine genetic evaluations. the aim of the current study was to estimate the genetic parameters of reproduction traits prior, during, and after a PRRSV outbreak. three breeding farms from the maschhoffs (Carlyle, IL) broke with a PRRSV strain in the spring of 2015. these farms included pedigreed purebred Yorkshire (YORK) and Landrace (LR) sows. farm 2 contained only the LR breed. serum tubes were centrifuged at the farm and these serum samples were sent to Kansas State University for analysis. antibody level against the PRRSV N-protein was measured using a fluorescent microsphere immunoassay (Luminex). =1,2,3), and BREED is the breed effect (k=1,2) were fitted as fixed effects. fyw is the random FYW effect, assumed to follow N(0, I f y w 2. sow is a random sow effect, assumed to follow N(0, I s o w 2. data from 1 wk prior to and 2 wk between the two outbreaks were removed. for farm 2, data from 1 wk prior to and 7 wk after the outbreak were removed. rolling averages for TNB fluctuated continuously during these weeks. the final multivariate dataset included 2,014, 1,428, and 1,626 records for the prior, during, and after phases respectively. the model used for S/P ratio (only recorded during the outbreak) also was a simple animal model, with parity, breed, date of sample collection (June 16 to 19), and the plate of the assay (96-well plates used) as fixed effects. FYW effect estimates for each individual in the pedigree. matrix X contains coefficients for random additive genetic effects. correlated random intercepts ( (a i) and random slopes ( (a s). estimates of genetic correlations of NBA between FYW classes were obtained from the estimated genetic covariance matrix G R N using G R N. this resulted in a 170 6,451 matrix of EBVs. a nearby farm first broke with this PRRSV strain. farm 1 was confirmed positive on March 5 and was depopulated to try to protect other nearby farms 2 and 3. fluorescent microsphere immunoassay (Luminex) converted into a standardized sample-to-positive (S/P) ratio using positive and negative controls. the assay is conceptually similar to an indirect ELISA. for genetic analyses, mortality traits NSB, NBM, and NBD were all log transformed as ln. s o w 2 is the sow variance, assumed to follow N(0, I s o w 2. estimates of FYW effects for each trait were standardized by their respective overall SDs. preliminary analysis showed only minor changes in variance component estimates. farm 3 data from 1 wk prior to the outbreak phase and 7 wk after the outbreak were removed. the latter were removed because rolling averages for TNB fluctuated continuously during these weeks, possibly from a rebound after the outbreak. the model used for S/P ratio (only recorded during the outbreak) was a simple animal model, with parity, breed, date of sample collection (June 16 to 19) and the plate of the assay (96-well plates used) as fixed effects. the pedigree included at least three generations to calculate the numerator relationship matrix (A) for a total of 6,202 animals. the variance\u2013covariance structure of (a) was as follows: Var [ a ] = Var [ a i a s ] = G R N A = [ A a i 2 A a i, a s, a i 2 and a s 2 ]. vector pe contains random permanent environmental effects for animals with records. estimates of genetic correlations of NBA between FYW classes were obtained from the estimated genetic covariance matrix G R N using G R N. this resulted in a 170 6,451 matrix of EBVs. the average NBA dropped from 10.6 prior to the outbreak to 7.7 during the PRRS phase.

NA3 1 TNB = total number born, NBA = log number stillborn, LNBM = log number born mummified, LNBD = log number born dead, S/P = sample-to-positive ratio of PRRS antibody levels. 2 Phases were split using a mixed linear model, fitting farm year week (FYW) as a random effect and extracting the predicted values. 1 TNB = total number born, NBA = number born alive, LNBM = log number stillborn, LNBD = log number born mummified, LNBD = log number born dead. 2 Phases were split using a mixed linear model, fitting farm year week (FYW) as a random effect. TNB and NBA had high genetic correlations prior to and after the outbreak. correlation dropped to 0.71 0.16 during the outbreak, likely due to greater prenatal mortality during the outbreak. the genetic correlation between LNSB and LNBD dropped to 0.73 0.23 during the outbreak but the estimate of the genetic correlation between LNBM and LNBD increased from 0.68 0.28 prior to the outbreak to 0.80 0.15 during the outbreak. all estimates of genetic correlations among mortality traits after the outbreak were >0.83. 0.23) 0.98 (0.06) LNBM-LNBD 0.68 (0.28) 0.80 (0.15) 0.90 (0.16) 1 TNB = total number born, NBA = number born alive, LNSB = log number stillborn, LNBD = log number born mummified, LNBD = log number born dead. 2 Phases were split using a mixed linear model, fitting farm year week (FYW) as a random effect and extracting the predicted values. the transition from diseased to healthy started for NBA FYW effects around 1 (with a very small overlap of the two phases, see Figure 2). Genetic correlations between the two blocks were moderate, except for the very extreme FYW levels. correlations of EBV for additive genetic intercept and slope terms with EBV for FYW levels equal to 4, 2, 0, and 2 are also shown. the EBV for the intercept terms from the reaction norm model had the highest correlation with EBV for NBAp (0.82), while EBV for NBAp and NBAd were highly correlated with EBV from the reaction norm model at FYW equal to 2 and 0. the average NBA dropped from 10.6 prior to the outbreak to 7.7 during the PRRS phase. the average NSB rose from 0.5 to 1.2 per litter during the outbreak. the average NSB went from 0.3 prior to the outbreak to 2.6 per litter during the outbreak. the severity of the disease during the PRRS outbreak in the spring of 2015 is evident. farm 2 had a spike in NSB immediately after the outbreak. farm 3 was slightly less affected in terms of NBA and NBD. the PRSS outbreak corresponded to spikes in mortality traits and drops in estimates of FYW effects for TNB and NBA. trends in estimates over time were similar for all traits, except for TNB. for farm 2, the NSB returned to baseline quicker than farm 3.

TNB and NBA had high genetic correlations prior to and after the outbreak. correlation dropped to 0.71 0.16 during the outbreak, likely due to greater prenatal mortality during the outbreak. negative estimates during the outbreak (0.14 to 0.22) were all positive (0.23 to 0.98) for all phases. genetic correlation between LNSB and LNBD dropped to 0.73 0.23. estimates of genetic correlation between LNBM and LNBD increased from 0.68 0.28 prior to the outbreak to 0.80 0.15. 0.36) LNSB-LNBD 0.94 (0.07) 0.73 (0.23) 0.98 (0.06) LNBM-LNBD 0.68 (0.28) 0.80 (0.15) 0.90 (0.16) 1 TNB = total number born, NBA = number born alive, LNBM = log number stillborn, LNBD = log number born mummified, LNBD = log number born dead. 2 Phases were split using a mixed linear model, fitting farm year week (FYW) as the transition from diseased to healthy started for NBA FYW effects around 1. genetic correlations between the two blocks were moderate, except for the very extreme FYW levels. the transition from diseased to healthy started for NBA FYW effects around 1. 1 Predicted values of farm-year-week (FYW) effects scaled using leg function in ASReml 4. 3 Predicted FYW effects scaled using the pol function in ASReml 4. correlations of EBV for additive genetic intercept and slope terms with EBV for FYW levels equal to 4, 2, 0, and 2 are also shown. correlations between EBV at different FYW levels were very similar to the estimates of genetic correlations from the reaction norm model. correlations between EBV at different FYW levels were very similar to the estimates of genetic correlations from the reaction norm model. estimates of genetic correlations of S/P ratio with reproductive traits did not agree with previous results. most prenatal mortality (68%) during the PRRS outbreak in this study was due to mummified piglets. the Luminex multiplex system allows for the detection of numerous analytes within a single biological sample, saving time, and labor. the microbead assay is conceptually similar to an indirect ELISA, as both measure antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein (inside the complete PRRS virus) differences in variance components estimated between the present study and Sero et al., (2014, 2016) should be a major consideration in future research, along with the age of the animal being tested. there are several other possible reasons for the difference in estimates of genetic parameters for S/P ratio between the current and previous PRRS outbreak studies. research may not be optimal for production and clearing the virus from a commercial farm. this may provide some insight into the difficulty of conducting this type of research in field conditions and therefore alternatives will be needed. study for estimates of heritability prior to and during the outbreak for NBM, NBD and NSB but their estimates of heritability for NBA was higher during the outbreak. the genetic correlation from Lewis et al., (2009) for NBA was 0.56 between healthy and diseased phases. the strain that caused the outbreak in the current study was a very severe strain of the PRRS virus. reproduction data from PRRS outbreak herds into only healthy and diseased phases. a finding from this research was that estimated genetic correlations may support keeping the time period after the PRRS phase as a separate trait from prior to the outbreak. this is the first study to report estimates of genetic correlations within phase (e.g. NBAp with LNSBp or TNBd with NBAd) not separating data from herds that experience disease outbreaks into three phases could affect estimates of genetic correlations between traits. reaction norm model treats both of these outbreaks as very similar traits. two FYW effects around 1 NBA may be the result of separate environmental changes. any FYW effect would be a combination of any management environments and challenges/stressors. Knap and Su (2008) used estimates for herd-year-season contemporary groups instead of herd-year-week contemporary groups used in the current analysis. the estimate of genetic correlation between the intercepts and slopes from the three parameterizations used in the current study was different (as expected), although all were positive. this indicates that selection for improved NBA of animals with the standard animal model would result in animals with greater reaction to changes in the environment. optimum selection would be for animals with a high EBV for the intercept and an EBV for the slope close to zero, indicating high producing animals that produce uniformly (in ranking) the reaction norm can capture more than just health, which may contribute to the difference in genetic correlations observed between the multivariate and reaction norm models. the reaction norm is only observed on part of the FYW estimates for many animals, especially because many sows are culled early. the use of random regression models for a reaction norm is different from many other situations in which random regression models are used. this possible instability over time in other antibody assays is risky for implementation into the swine breeding industry. it is unclear whether selection on antibody response (possibly to PRRS vaccines) will be highly useful to the swine breeding industry. sero et al. (2014) found that S/P ratio tended to have moderate/strong genetic correlations with reproduction traits, ranging from 0.72 (NSB) to 0.73 (NBA); the lowest estimate in absolute value was 0.27 (NBD). both TNB and NBA were not strongly associated with S/P ratio. sensitivity and specificity between the assays were 91% and 93% for PRRS in young pigs, respectively. in adult pigs, 64% (16/25) of samples were found to be positive by the Luminex assay but negative by the IDEXX HerdChek PRRS X3 assay (Gim\u00e9nez-Lirola et al., 2014) sows in the current study were inoculated 3 wk after the confirmed outbreak, followed by MLV vaccination. Vaccination is not expected to impact antibody levels at 40 d after inoculation, as a secondary type of response in a relatively short time after infection is not expected. however, it still could contribute to differences. heritability for NBA was lower during the outbreak, while estimates of heritability for mortality traits were higher during the outbreak. this makes sense, as sows that farrowed during the outbreak farrowed later during or after the outbreak, which affects the total born observed. Rashidi et al. (2014) estimated genetic correlations for NBA and NBD at 0.87 and 0.57 between healthy and diseased phases. the strain that caused the outbreak in the current study was a very severe strain of the PRRS virus. the virus can persist in tonsils and lymph nodes and has been identified in animals as long as 175 to 251 d postinfection. in the present study, the after phase included 4 mo of data. it is possible that the large farm sizes contributed to the persistent nature of the infection. not separating data from herds that experience disease outbreaks into three phases could affect estimates of genetic correlations between traits. for example, the genetic correlation between TNB and LNBD was 0.28 0.26 prior to infection and 0.56 0.23 during the PRRS outbreak. Knap and Su (2008) stressed the need to have large datasets for reaction norm models to be effective. optimal breeding objective should include general resilience/robustness to any number of stressors, including different diseases, not to single diseases or stressors. correlations between EBV for the intercept term from the reaction norm model and EBV from a typical animal model were not affected by the parameterization of the model. the current analysis expanded this by calculating the correlations of EBV from the multivariate phases (prior, during, and after) model. in commercial data, challenges for pigs can encompass social, environmental, metabolic, immunological, and human interactions. seasonality encompasses effects of heat stress and disease and both affect FYW estimates. the total range in estimates of NBA FYW effects was 6.43 on the original scale. 47%, 70%, and 89% of sows had phenotypes in contemporary groups that ranged 0.5, 2.0, and 3.0 respectively, in NBA FYW effects. this may contribute to the poor accuracy referred to by Knap and Su (2008). the genetic correlation between reproductive performance prior to and during the PRRS outbreak was high for both TNB and NBA. the only negative genetic correlation between performance prior to and during the PRRS outbreak was for LNBM."}
