{"summary": "early identification of fungal pathogens is important for optimal treatment of IFIs. traditional detection methods, including culture, direct exam, and histopathology, have limitations of sensitivity, specificity, and ability to provide rapid identification (2\u20134) PCR coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) offers the possibility for broad-range identification while maintaining the sensitivity of PCR. a 16-primer pair PCR/ESI-MS broad fungal assay was developed by Ibis Biosciences (Carlsbad, CA) to provide universal fungal detection, as well as differentiation to the species level of common fungal pathogens known to cause IFI. the assay was then tested against a set of phenotypically identified clinical isolates. 12 mucorales, 41 Ascomycetes, and 7 Basidiomycetes reference strains were used in this study. clinical isolates recovered from patient specimens submitted for fungal diagnosis were collected between March 1999 and October 2011. nucleic acid was extracted using the PCR/ESI-MS DNA preparation kit (CE Mark) following the standard extraction protocol. the punch samples included either mycelial or yeast colonies and underlying agar. samples were eluted in 35 l of PCR grade water. amplification was carried out over 25 cycles, consisting of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. PCR products were purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit (Qiagen) phenotypic identifications were determined by visual observation of colony appearance and lactophenol cotton blue microscopic slide mount features. growth rate and temperature tolerance were also determined. all samples were run on the PLEX-ID platform at Ibis Biosciences using PCR/ESI-MS assay. rRNA M26190.1 72\u201378 Broad TCAAGGCCTCTAATCATTCGCTTTACCTC 5178 TGCAGGCCTATATGCTCGAATACATTAGCAT SSU rRNA EF397944 99\u2013101 Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes TGTCCCTATTACGGCGGTCCTA 3030 TGTGAAGCGGCAAAAGCTCTCAAATTT LSU rRNA X70659.1 116\u2013130 Ascomyce colored boxes indicate the coverage attained by each primer pair whose name is reported within square brackets. each primer pair whose name is reported within square brackets. species reported within the same box show distinct signatures. the PCR/ESI-MS fungal molecular signature database consisted of the base composition signatures of individual fungi. the database was constructed from an in silico survey of existing fungal entries in the GenBank nr database. the system has the potential to recognize single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants. this feature was turned off for the broad fungal assay. closely related base counts could result from naturally occurring variation in a given species. the 1-mm core panel punches were mixed with 3-mm punches from inhibitory mold agar with gentamicin, brain heart infusion agar with blood, chloramphenicol and gentamicin, potato dextrose agar with tartaric acid, and Sabouraud dextrose agar with chloramphenicol. the tubes were then processed for fungal detection by PCR/ESI-MS. PCR/ESI-MS clinical isolate identifications were compared to phenotypic identification results. samples were classified as having either a species- or genus-level match. mismatched identifications of clinical samples were resolved by sequencing. patient specimens submitted for fungal diagnosis were collected between March 1999 and October 2011. 401 clinical isolates were evaluated using PCR/ESI-MS. 134 isolates collected retrospectively from SJCRH and 267 collected prospectively at JHH. al or yeast colonies and underlying agar were placed in Negative Matrix tubes (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL) that contained 1,100 l of filtered 10% bovine serum albumin (Negative Matrix solution) and zirconium-yttrium beads. before extraction, 25 l proteinase K (600 units/ml) were added. liter reactions were carried out according to manufacturer's specifications. initial activation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 25 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 65\u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 68\u00b0C for 1 min. PCR products were purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit. all samples were run on the PLEX-ID platform at Ibis Biosciences using PCR/ESI-MS assay. a synthetic DNA construct was also included in each reaction (20 copies per reaction) as an internal positive amplification control and quantitative calibrant. 116\u2013130 Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes TTCTCACCCTCTCTGTGACGGCCTGTTTTCC 5185 TGGAGTCTAACATCTATGTGTT LSU rRNA X70659.1 137\u2013153 Ascomycetes and some Basidiomycetes TCCCACAGCTATGCTCTTACTCAAATCC 3766 TTGTGTAGAATAGGTGGGAGCTTCG mtSSU rRNA DQ415 colored boxes indicate the coverage attained by each primer pair whose name is reported within square brackets.

PCR/ESI-MS fungal signatures were typically defined across 6 to 10 loci depending on phylogeny. PCR/ESI-MS broad fungal assay development was carried out. Detection was carried out in the presence and absence of 3 g of human DNA. original fungal DNA stocks were tested over a 2-fold serial dilution range. each of the core panel fungi was spiked into the Negative Matrix tubes. the tubes were then processed for fungal detection by PCR/ESI-MS. PCR/ESI-MS clinical isolate identifications were compared to phenotypic identification results. a 16-primer pair panel was assembled for the characterization of fungal species by PCR/ESI-MS. two primer pairs (5186 and 5187) were designed to amplify the LSU rRNA for broad-range fungal detection. those two primer pairs offer limited resolution but yield amplicons with all fungi tested to date. R. oryzae and R. microsporus gave LODs of 900 copies/ml (45 copies/rxn) and 700 copies/ml (35 copies/rxn), respectively. LOD did not change for any of the fungi when human DNA was present. Detection of A. fumigatus was inhibited when mixed with either Candida albicans or Candida glabrata. in all other mixtures, both fungi were successfully identified. there were no misidentifications due to superimposition of multiple fungal signatures. PCR/ESI-MS identified 97.7% (126/129) of the samples to the correct genus level. of those 126 isolates, PCR/ESI-MS provided species-level identification for 94.4% (119/126), compared to 89.9% (116/129) with phenotype methods. all isolates of Alternaria spp., Bipolaris spp., and Curvularia spp. were identified to the genus level but none were given species designations by either method. PCR/ESI-MS identified 5/6 (83.3%) of the Rhizopus isolates to the genus level; the remaining isolate was not detected by PCR/ESI-MS. ilacinus were Penicillium spp., agreeing with phenotypic identifications. two of five isolates had DNA detected without identification. two isolates were misidentified by PCR/ESI-MS as Fusarium. a total of 130 isolates identified as yeast by culture and phenotypic characterization were analyzed. PCR/ESI-MS identified 96.9% (126/130) of isolates to the species level and 1.5% (2/130) to the genus level. the only two clinical Cryptococcus isolates (C. albidus and C. laurentii) could not be detected. a 16-primer pair panel was assembled for the characterization of fungal species by PCR/ESI-MS. the primer pairs developed and used in this assay were chosen to cover the broad phylogenetic diversity seen in clinically relevant fungi. the primer pairs were designed to amplify the LSU rRNA for broad-range fungal detection. R. oryzae and R. microsporus gave LODs of 900 copies/ml (45 copies/rxn) and 700 copies/ml (35 copies/rxn), respectively. LOD did not change for any of the fungi when human DNA was present. biopsy punches from different fungi were mixed prior to analysis. Detection of A. fumigatus was inhibited when mixed with either Candida albicans or Candida glabrata. in all other mixtures, both fungi were successfully identified. there were no misidentification due to superimposition of multiple fungal signatures. 89.7% concordance with phenotypic identification. of those 18 isolates mismatched at either the species or genus level. PCR/ESI-MS identified 97.7% (126/129) of the samples to the correct genus level. three isolates were detected by PCR/ESI-MS. all isolates of Alternaria spp., Bipolaris spp., and Curvularia spp. were identified to the genus level but none were given species designations by either method. PCR/ESI-MS identified 5/6 (83.3%) of the Rhizopus isolates to the genus level; the remaining isolate was not detected by PCR/ESI-MS. all but one (sequence identified as Paecilomyces lilacinus) were Penicillium spp., agreeing with phenotypic identifications. in the case of Paecilomyces spp., two of five isolates had DNA detected without identification, while two isolates were misidentified by PCR/ESI-MS as Fusarium. in one sample, the PCR/ESI-MS run failed. Penicillium spp. 19 Genus-level identification (1/19) Genus-level misidentification (5/19) Fungi detected but not identified (11/19) Not detected (2/19) Rhizopus and Rhizomucor spp. 7 Genus-level identification (6/7) Scedosporium spp. 9 Genus-level identification (9/9) Other characterized species (18 genera) 26 Genus-level misidentification (7/26) Fungi detected but not identified (15/26) Not the PCR/ESI-MS system effectively combines broad phylogenetic coverage of sequence-based methods with the sensitivity of PCR. the PCR/ESI-MS system identified 98.4% of the total yeast isolates to either the species (96.9%) or genus level. findings were recently reported in a study comparing PCR/ESI-MS with repetitive-sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) and sequencing for the detection of Candida species (6). these results indicate a high level of accuracy for the identification of clinically important yeasts. the PCR/ESI-MS system identified 81.4% of clinical mold isolates to either the species (48.1%) or genus (33.3%) level. identification to the genus level only may be very helpful for clinical decisions. distinction between Cryptococcus spp. and Candida spp. from bloodstream isolates can provide critical information. echinocandins are not active against the former but are active against the latter. the PCR/ESI-MS system has been used for direct detection of bacterial and viral pathogens. similar application to broad-range fungal detection has consistently eluded investigators. earlier detection is a fundamental challenge in improving clinical outcome. PCR/ESI-MS uses proteomic information from intact cells. limitations may include variability in protein expression and integrity of intact cells. potential advantage of PCR/ESI-MS lies in its sensitivity and ability to directly detect pathogens without prior culture. MS in a broad-range system could have a significant impact on the care of immunocompromised patients. future studies will be required to confirm findings related to the identification of culture isolates."}
