{"summary": "the number of publications in each year was recorded to assess temporal trends of research output. 13499 publications regarding UC published in Chinese medical journals between 2001 and 2015. more than half of all papers were published in the most recent 5-year period. severe UC (SUC) is a potentially life-threatening condition which is defined as six or more bloody stools per day plus at least one of the following of Truelove and Witts\u2019 criteria. tachycardia (pulse rate > 90 bpm); anemia (hemoglobin 75% of normal); and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR > 30 mm/h) a long-term follow-up study from Hong Kong reported a sixfold increase in the incidence of UC. a comprehensive search of the Chinese biomedical literature database retrieved 3384 articles relating to inflammatory bowel disease between 1989 and 2013, in which 140114 cases of UC were reported. temporal trends in the number of Chinese publications on UC and SUC between 2001 and 2015. this study aims to provide a review of the data on treatment type and efficacy in SUC patients that has been reported in Chinese medical journals. database searching We conducted searches of the Chinese periodical databases WANFANG, VIP, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) results were limited to those published in the years from 2001 to 2015. about 13499 ulcerative colitis related articles were published in Chinese medical journals from 2001 to 2015. the annual increase is statistically significant (r = 0.94, P 0.01). 510 papers were retrieved from these three databases when the publication year was limited to the most recent 15 years (2001-2015) removal of duplicates resulted in 201 individual papers on severe ulcerative colitis (SUC) during this time. 201 publications in Chinese journals on SUC compromised 96 original research articles (47.8%), 29 case reports and case series (14.4%), 18 reviews (9%), 25 conference papers, 7 graduation thesis and 26 papers that were published in journals of nursing. of the 96 original articles, 65 (67.8%) have reported the adopted diagnostic criteria for SUC. proportion of descriptive studies decreased from 71.8% in 2001-2005 and 64.3% in 2006-2010, to 41.5% in 2011-2015, while the proportion of clinical trials increased 1.5 fold. patients reported in 201 Chinese SUC related publications There were 6222 patients with SUC reported in the total of 201 papers on SUC. only 4 articles recorded the inducement of onset, in which 72 of 201 patients reported mental stress as the trigger for symptoms, 43 physical strains, 28 improper diets, 18 infections. the number of cases with toxic megacolon, intestinal perforation, severe hemorrhage, intestinal obstruction, colorectal cancer was recorded to be 40 (0.64%), 30 (0.48%), 25 (0.40%), 10 (0.16%), and 8 (0.13% respectively. 9 of the 96 original research articles focused on corticosteroid treatment. three of these 9 articles reported both outcome and predictors of therapy failure. previous severe attack and onset with stool frequency 10/d are associated with increased rates of steroids failure. two articles investigated the predictors for the need for colectomy. the Oxford index, also known as the Travis index, was developed in 1996. patients with a stool frequency of more than 8 per day have a 85% chance of colectomy. the Edinburgh index is also known as the Ho score. the most commonly employed operations were total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) (45%), total proctocolectomy with ileostomy (19%), total proctocolectomy with ileoanal anastomosis (IAA) (15%), and total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) (14%). 510 papers were retrieved from these three databases when the publication year was limited to the most recent 15 years (2001-2015) removal of duplicates resulted in 201 individual papers on severe ulcerative colitis (SUC) during this time. the increase in the number of publications in each year is statistically significant (r = 0.86, P 0.01). of the 96 original articles, 65 (67.8%) have reported the adopted diagnostic criteria for SUC. in these consensuses, SUC is diagnosed according to Truelove and Witts\u2019 criteria. the severity of UC was judged according to the criteria applied in western countries. patients reported in 201 Chinese SUC related publications. there were 6222 patients reported in the total of 201 papers on SUC. the overall increase in the annual number of patients was greater than 10-fold. temporary trends in the number of patients are similar to the data for the number of publications. 480 cases of colectomy were reported in 201 papers. mortality rate calculated with our data was 0.8%. treatment types included traditional Chinese Medicine (46.2%), corticosteroid therapy (17.3%), enteral or parenteral nutrition support (11.5%), immunosuppressive drugs (7.7%), biological agents (3.8%), probiotics (5.7%) and others (7.7%) the effective rate of steroid treatment ranged from 58.3% to 90%. previous severe attack and onset with stool frequency 10/d are associated with increased rates of steroids failure. the Swedish index is calculated using the algorithm: \u201cnumber of stools per day + 0.14 x CRP (mg/L)\u201d, with scores > 8 indicating a high risk of requiring colectomy. scores greater than 4 are predictive for failure of corticosteroid therapy and subsequent need for colectomy. only one of these 8 articles reported the rate of colectomy. ectomy with ileoanal anastomosis (15%), and total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (14%) the most common late complication of IPAA was pouchitis. 67% experienced disease recurrence in the rectum, however no cases of rectal dysplasia and/or cancer was reported after a median 3-year follow-up. there was a more than tenfold increase in the number of SUC patients reported in Chinese medical journals over the most recent 15 years. a male predominance in SUC incidence was observed in our data, with a male to female ratio of 1.38, similar to the value of 1.34 reported by a multi-centre study in china. however, male and female patients were reported to be equally affected in 10218 UC patients reported in Chinese medical literature from 1981 to 2000. cyclosporine treatment has improved the outcome of steroids-refractory disease in SUC patients and achieved an immediate response rate of 64%-82%[2]. there is a lack of randomized controlled trials and long-term follow-up studies focused on cyclosporine treatment in China, but publications on infliximab therapy in Chinese SUC patients did not appear until 2013. the colectomy rate in our study was found to be 7.7%, while the colectomy rate in hospitalized SUC patients reported by the West China Hospital is 17.9%. the most commonly employed operation was total proctocolectomy with IPAA since it avoids the requirement for a permanent stoma. almost 20% of patients experienced pouch failure due to pouchitis or pouch dysfunction after IPAA[33]. publications since 2016 were not included since only partial data of these publications were available online when the database search was performed. in these 23 original articles, 21 were focused on the management of SUC, including traditional Chinese medicine (17.4%), corticosteroid therapy (8.7%), immunosuppressive drugs (4.3%), biological agents (26.1%), and probiotics (17.4%). we reported a male predominance in SUC incidence and a lower colectomy rate in Chinese SUC patients compared to western countries based on literature review. data of clinical characteristics obtained from literature review should be verified and extended by further well-designed and detailed population-based studies. a comprehensive study on the SUC-related Chinese publications is desperately needed. the number of publications for each year was recorded after duplicates were removed. the topic of each paper was recorded and only those that were clinical in nature were included in the assessment. the complexity of SUC research was evaluated according to the methods described by Scott et al. more research into efficacy of treatment with cyclosporin or infliximab in Chinese SUC patients is required. more research into the efficacy of treatment with cyclosporin or infliximab in Chinese SUC patients is required. a study can provide information useful for the design of new treatment programs for SUC patients worldwide. the aim of this study is to perform a bibliometric analysis to determine temporal trends in the number of Chinese publications on UC and SUC (2001-2015) 222 SUC patients were reported in 201 relevant papers. the number of patients reported in each 5-year period significantly increased. total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis was the most commonly employed operation."}
