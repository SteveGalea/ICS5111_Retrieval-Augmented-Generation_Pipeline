{"summary": "wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV) is a soil-borne pathogen. it is transmitted by the fungus-like organism polymyxa graminis. the disease area was more than 666,700 hectares in the 1990s. high specificity and sensitivity, rapid execution, performance under isothermal condition, time-saving, easy observation of by-products make RT-LAMP unrivaled among diagnostic techniques. RT-LAMP method was used successfully for detection of WYMV for the first time. four sets of primers were designed by Primer Explorer version 4. oligonucleotide primers recognize six sequences of the CP gene. each inner primer has two distinct adjacent sequences in opposite orientations. is virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 8 U Bacillus stearothermophilus (Bst) DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), 1.0 l RNA extract and 4.0 l deionized distilled water. four sets of primers (I-IV) located in the CP and the 72 kDa gene were used to detect WYMV at 65 twenty-five microliters of PCR mixture contained 2.5 l PCR buffer, 0.5 l dNTP (5 mM each), 0.5 M primers, 1.25 U Taq DNA polymerase and 21.5 l deionized distilled water. the PCR was performed with denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 5 min and 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 40 s, 63\u00b0C for 45 s, and 72\u00b0C for 40 s. a Genome position refers to the nucleotide sequence of WYMV-HC CP and 72 kDa genes. a Genome position refers to the nucleotide sequence of WYMV-HC CP and 72 kDa genes. RNA1 AF067124, RNA2 AF041041), CWMV RNA2 19-kDa gene (accession number AJ012006) and BSMV RNA-gamma segment (accession number M16577) Specificity and sensitivity comparison of RT-LAMP and RT-PCR were shown in Table 1. total RNA from CWMV-infected wheat was diluted serially in 10-fold increments (100-10-8) with healthy the precipitate was collected by centrifugation (12,000 rpm) at 4\u00b0C for 15 min. the resultant pellet was washed twice with 70% ethanol, dried at 37\u00b0C for about 5 min, and dissolved in 60 l deionized distilled water. four sets of primers (I-IV) located in the CP and the 72 kDa gene were used to detect WYMV at 65\u00b0C for 25-80 min. the final products of RT-LAMP were a mixture of stem-loop DNAs with various stem lengths and cauliflower-like structures with multiple loops. twenty-five microliters of PCR mixture contained 2.5 l PCR buffer, 0.5 l dNTP (5 mM each), 0.5 M primers, 1.25 U Taq DNA polymerase (Tiangen, Beijing, China) and 21.5 l deionized distilled water, added to a final volume of 15 l.

RT-LAMP reaction mixtures were used for turbidity observation with primer sets I-IV after reaction at 65\u00b0C for 80 min. turbidity of pyrophosphate ions was observed directly after production of large amounts of DNA fragments during the RT-LAMP reaction. RT-LAMP reaction mixtures were used for turbidity observation. primers CWMV-F and CWMV-R were used for CWMV RT-PCR and primers BSMV-F and BSMV-R were used for BSMV RT-PCR. agarose gel analysis revealed that WYMV primers specifically amplified WYMV but not CWMV and BSMV. sensitivity comparison showed that RT-LAMP could detect WYMV from total RNA diluted up to 10-5. RT-PCR detected total RNA diluted up to 10-3. RT-LAMP was 100-fold more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR. four sets of RT-LAMP primers were designed (I-IV), which targeted the CP (RNA1) gene and 72 kDa (RNA2) gene of WYMV. HC72-157 F and HC72-518R were the conventional RT-PCR primers. each set contains four primers, F3 and B3 were outer primers whereas FIP and BIP were inner primers. the first sequence (nt 813-729) of FIP-3 and sequence (nt 1428-1407) of FIP-4 were in reverse orientation. the second sequence (nt 748-767) and sequence (nt 1355-1372) of the primers were in the forward direction. their relative location in the virus genomes were shown in Table 1. I-IV were four sets of primers; AMV was AMV-mediated RT-LAMP; M-MLV was M-MLV-mediated RT-LAMP. RT-LAMP reaction mixtures were used for turbidity observation with the primer sets I-IV after reaction at 65\u00b0C for 80 min. the healthy controls were relatively clear, whereas the positive samples were cloudy. primers CWMV-F and CWMV-R were used for CWMV RT-PCR and primers BSMV-F and BSMV-R were used for BSMV RT-PCR. agarose gel analysis of RT-LAMP revealed that WYMV primers specifically amplified WYMV but not CWMV and BSMV. control Detection of wheat field samples Twenty-two samples from different provinces were tested by RT-LAMP and RT-PCR. eight of 22 samples were positive by RT-LAMP, whereas only five were positive by RT-PCR. this result confirmed the reliability and sensitivity of this RT-LAMP assay. the RT-LAMP assay was performed at different times and virus was detected after 30-45 min by agarose gel analysis. the reaction condition at 65\u00b0C for 80 min was used according to previous studies and the results obtained here. RT-LAMP method had detection sensitivity about 100 times more than RT-PCR in the present study. XL performed the RT-PCR detection of CWMV and the DL, JY and CH conceived of the study and participated in its design and coordination. all authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
