{"summary": "many of these diseases have significant impacts on human health, domestic animal health, wildlife health and biodiversity. many of these diseases have significant impacts on human health, domestic animal health, wildlife health and biodiversity. national animal health system is supported by a co-ordinated general wildlife health surveillance system. the primary responsibility for collecting animal health data, including wildlife disease data, rests with state and territory government agencies [20]. the zoo based wildlife disease surveillance program was developed to incorporate disease information from free-ranging wildlife presented to Australian zoos into this existing national wildlife health information system. the program aimed to integrate zoo based wildlife hospitals into Australia\u2019s animal health surveillance system. six major Australian zoos were selected to participate in the pilot project. each with a well-established and resourced on-site veterinary hospital treating free-ranging and rehabilitation wildlife. indicative numbers of free-ranging wildlife cases seen by veterinary hospitals at six major zoos over a 12 month period during 2008/2009. native species* Feral species* ZOO Mammals Birds Reptiles Amphibia All taxa TOTAL Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital 2,579 (38%) 2,835 (42%) 1,126 (17%) 49 (0.7%) 197 (3%) 6,786 Healesville Sanctuary 567 (37%) 851 (56%) 95 (6%) 14 (0.9%) the \u2018interesting or unusual\u2019 category was designed to capture unusual events or findings that could indicate an emerging disease, syndrome or trend. examples of disease events that could be reported in this category are significant clusters or patterns of disease, unexpected morbidities or mortalities, toxicity events, marine wildlife strandings, and cases with possible linkages to international events or drivers. zoo based surveillance program was proposed and a collaborative project was developed between the AWHN and the Zoo and Aquarium Association australasia. the pilot project was to trial the integration of free-ranging wildlife disease information from zoo based wildlife hospitals into the national wildlife health information system. a formal survey of these zoos was conducted to gather baseline information and assist in planning for the pilot project. data were collected on the number and taxonomic breakdown of wildlife cases seen by each of the zoos over a 12-month period during 2009 to 2010. report into the national wildlife health information system in the pilot project was limited to selected disease event categories. categories were designed to collect wildlife disease information of potential importance to human health, livestock health, trade and biodiversity. the priority for data collection was positive results, but reporting of negative results was also encouraged. the data entered into eWHIS were reviewed and moderated by the AWHN. participants were encouraged to engage with their state or territory agriculture agency via the wildlife coordinator. this did not replace or bypass the legislated reporting of notifiable animal diseases through appropriate channels. fourteen cases of neoplasia in a variety of species including yellow-bellied glider (Petaurus australis), new Zealand fur seal (Arctocephalus forsteri), koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) joey with neurological signs and septicaemia - caecum, blood and liver \u2018Interesting or unusual\u2019 cases. the 211 disease events reported for the period from November 2010 to October 2011 covered 52 different species from 31 families. the pilot project increased the overall species coverage of the data collected in eWHIS. the majority of bat cases were submitted for exclusion testing for Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) the project captured data on diseases with potential human health implications, including confirmed or highly suspicious cases of salmonellosis, avian chlamydiosis (Chlamydophila psittaci), Australian bat lyssavirus in bats, mycobacteriosis (unspecified) in a koala (Phascolarctos cine cases in threatened species were reported, including the endangered carnaby\u2019s black-cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus latirostris) and loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) also reported was a diabetes syndrome affecting koalas in care that could impact on the rehabilitation success of koalas in Queensland. the project provided a framework for improved data capture for monitoring programs. a strain of avian paramyxovirus 1 (APMV1) not previously reported in Australia was detected in hobby pigeons in the Melbourne area in Victoria. the virus was subsequently detected in feral rock doves and a spotted turtle dove. the pilot project increased the volume of cases and expanded sources of data being entered into the national database. the review found that the pilot project increased the volume of cases and expanded the sources of data being entered into the national database [46]. the pilot project increased the volume of cases and expanded the sources of data being entered into the national database. the pilot project increased the volume of cases and expanded the sources of data being entered into the national database [46]. the review identified limitations of the program, including clustering of cases around major population centres and the collection of only a small proportion of the total caseload of the participating zoo wildlife hospitals. the reviewers concluded that there was value in the project to both the stakeholders and the participants, and that it was sustainable. they recommended the program be continued and expanded to include more zoos in order to increase the coverage and volume of data collected. zoo based hospitals are recognised as one of the chief sources of information on wildlife health. the cost of providing this service is mostly covered by the zoos\u2019 operating budgets. zoos also have strong linkages with a broad network of wildlife rehabilitators, wildlife researchers, conservation organisations and environmental officers. zoo wildlife hospitals at zoos collect only a small proportion of the total caseload of the zoo wildlife hospitals into the eWHIS database (1\u20138%) the majority of cases presenting to zoo wildlife hospitals involve orphaned animals and cases involving dog, cat or vehicular trauma. the need for a systematic approach to communication between the human and animal disease surveillance systems in Australia has been outlined [19]. a \u2018One Health\u2019 approach can result in increased interaction between professionals working in the veterinary, medical, wildlife and environmental spheres. the program has the potential to build the capacity of zoos to play a rapid and effective role in a disease emergency by integrating zoo veterinarians into the national biosecurity surveillance network. the program uses a collaborative approach involving government and the zoo industry. it provides a strong model for a disease surveillance program for free-ranging wildlife that could be adapted and utilised in other contexts."}
