{"summary": "parents measured the temperature of 60 children with a tympanic thermometer. the reference standard was a temperature measured by a nurse with a model of tympanic thermometer commonly used in hospitals. a fever was defined as a temperature 38.5 \u00b0C. readings done by parents with a tympanic thermometer designed for home use differed a clinically significant amount from the reference standard. parents failed to detect fever about one-quarter of the time, and parents failed to detect fever about one-quarter of the time. parents of febrile or afebrile children aged 6 months to 16 years were approached on the days when the study nurse was available. preference was given to patients who were being assessed because of fever. parents were not approached if it would be inconvenient for them to participate in the study. the readings obtained by the nurse and the parent from the home thermometer were compared to those obtained by the nurse using the hospital thermometer (the reference standard for the study) if the readings obtained by the parent differed considerably from those obtained by the nurse, the nurse then obtained very consistent readings with the two different thermometers. one could conclude that either instrument or human error could be the problem. study procedures After informed consent was obtained from the parent. the parent was given the instruction sheet from the tympanic thermometer to read. they then recorded the temperature they measured on a sheet of paper. the nurse then measured the temperature using the same thermometer. the difference between the temperature recorded by the parent and the temperature recorded by the nurse using the home thermometer was 0.44 0.61 \u00b0C. the difference was similar in febrile and afebrile children. the higher reading was from the parent in 20 of the 60 cases. absolute difference 0.5 \u00b0C Parent versus nurse using home tympanic thermometer All children n = 60 0.44 0.61 0.0 \u2013 3.1 33% Parent versus nurse using home tympanic thermometer Afebrile children n = 43 0.44 0.65 0.0\u20133.1 35% Parent versus nurse using home tympanic thermometer Febrile children n = 17 0.45 0.51 0.10 \u2013 1.9 29% Nurse using home thermometer versus nurses detected fever with a sensitivity of 94 % (95 % CI 71\u2013100 %), a specificity of 88 % (95% CI 75\u201396 %), a positive predictive value of 76% (95% CI 53\u201392 %) and a negative predictive value of 97% (95% CI 87\u2013100 %) in 25 of the 60 cases. the difference was similar in febrile and afebrile children. the higher reading was from the parent in 20 of the 60 cases. the difference was similar in febrile and afebrile children. nurses to detect fever using a home tympanic thermometer. a hospital tympanic thermometer is the reference standard Nurse reported fever on hospital thermometer Parent reported fever on home thermometer 13 2 Parent reported no fever on home thermometer 4* 41 Nurse reported no fever on home thermometer 1** 38 *Readings by parents were 37.8 \u00b0C, 37.9 \u00b0C, and 38.4 \u00b0C twice with corresponding hospital thermometer readings being 38.6 the difference between temperature measured by a parent and that measured by a nurse using a thermometer designed for home use Figure 3. Scatter plot of the difference between temperature measured by a parent and that measured by a nurse using a thermometer designed for home use Figure 4. study compares readings taken by a nurse with a home tympanic thermometer to a hospital tympanic thermometer. the difference was 0.24 \u00b0C, with 13 % of the readings differing by a clinically significant amount. the nurse would have identified all but one of the 17 children with fever as being febrile with either thermometer, and that child had a temperature of 38.4 \u00b0C on one thermometer. a tympanic thermometer should only occur if the thermometer is stored above room temperature. in 25 of the 60 cases the parent obtained a higher reading than did the nurse. it is not clear if parents could more accurately use an infrared temporal artery thermometer. a reading of 37.8 \u00b0C was 97% sensitive and 84% specific for detecting a rectal temperature of 38.5 \u00b0C. the limits of agreement for temperatures obtained by parents versus nurses using this thermometer were -0.6 \u00b0C to 0.7 \u00b0C. this is lower than the limits of agreement for the current study. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions JLR wrote the protocol and the manuscript. authors would like to thank Ann Roth, Gwen Alton and Kate Mackintosh."}
