{"summary": "BAG3 protein and bag3 Gene Expression Two BAG3 forms have been described so far. one is the full-lenght product of the bag3 gene having an apparent mass of 74 kDa. the other is a shorter BAG3 protein found in association to neuronal synaptosomes2, 9, 10, 11. bag3 gene expression is constitutive in myocytes, a few other normal cell types and several primary tumors or tumor cell lines. it is instead induced in different normal cell types (leukocytes, epithelial and glial cells, retinal cells) by stressors. some cell types appear to be developmentally regulated by its own product. proteasome inhibitors, ligand, fludarabine, cytosine arabinoside and etoposide increase BAG3 protein levels. this in turn contributes to cell resistance to therapy, and indeed bag3 silencing improves cell apoptotic response to drugs. mice with homozygous disruption of bag3 gene develop post birth an early fulminant myopathy23. a heterozygous p.Pro209Leu mutation in BAG3 protein was recently recognized to be responsible for a severe muscular dystrophy with cardiomyopathy. axonal neuropathy was also present in one of the three studied families carrying this mutation. a decrease in triglyceride and cholesterol levels and growth retardation, and died by 3 weeks after birth. a number of studies have shown that bag3 silencing or hyperexpression results in, respectively, enhancing or inhibiting spontaneous or drug-induced apoptosis. BAG3 may be expected to regulate Hsp70 ability to stabilize mRNAs. it could also bind some client proteins through its WW or PXXP domain, directly influencing their stability, localization or activity. the PPDY motif at the C-terminus of PDZGEF2 was shown to bind to the WW domain of BAG3. PDZGEF2 knockdown reduced BAG3 ability to induce cell adhesion in Cos7 cells. however, the ability of BAG3 to regulate cell adhesion appears to rely on multiple interactions of this protein through different structural domains. macroautophagy is a process in which lysosomes directly engulf cytoplasm. autophagy is upregulated under stress. autophagy is associated with diverse diseases. the mechanism by which the BAG3/HspB8 complex induces eIF2 phosphorylation is not completely understood. 71 BAG3 binding to HspB8 is mediated by two conserved Ile\u2013Pro\u2013Val motifs located between the W- and the Pro-rich domains. deletion of these motifs suppresses HspB8 activity in Htt43Q degradation. authors attribute BAG3 increase to oxidative stress due to enhanced pro-oxidant milieu characteristic of aging. as this milieu enhances the occurrence of protein aggregation, BAG3-stimulated autophagy is interpreted as an adaptive response of the protein quality control system. cleotides increase apoptosis by >100% in cells untreated or incubated with chemotherapeutic drugs. first reported evidence of the apoptosis-regulating activity of BAG3 protein in primary tumors. BAG3 deficiency can result in the loss of hematopoietic stem cells. this finding suggests that BAG3 may also regulate the cancer stem cell-supporting activity of stromal cells in the hematopoietic."}
