{"summary": "viruses, including alpha- and gammaherpesviruses, influenza A virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, induce widespread mRNA decay through the use of virally encoded endonucleases (1\u20135) this process allows viruses to rapidly restrict gene expression in order to dampen immune responses and provide access to the host\u2019s resources for viral replication. a broad-acting RNA element is not characterized by a defined sequence motif (19), rendering it difficult to identify new escaping mRNAs by traditional sequence search. only two SRE-bearing dominant escapees are known: the host interleukin-6 (IL-6) (18, 20, 21) and the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 beta (GADD45B) (19) transcripts. a cluster of 75 host mRNAs escape degradation from four herpesviral endonucleases. these transcripts were spared from a range of viral\u2014but not host\u2014endonucleases. we demonstrate that our top candidate, C19ORF66, is a negative regulator of the KSHV life cycle. RESULTS Comparative RNA-seq identifies a cluster of common escaping transcripts. prior analyses indicated that certain host mRNA transcripts robustly escape viral-induced RNA decay by encoding an RNA element in their 3 UTRs. the RNA element provides protection against KSHV SOX as well as a variety of viral endonucleases. gene expression expressed as log2 fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads. dots represent fold change and P values as determined by CuffDiff. transcripts were clustered by similarity using the complete linkage method. RNA-seq hits identified by hierarchical clustering were ranked by confidence. we first examined whether top 10% of this list were resistant to host shutoff. iSLK.219 cells harbor a doxycycline (dox)-inducible version of the major viral lytic transactivator RTA. nsp1 is not a nuclease but activates mRNA cleavage by an unknown cellular endonuclease. nsp1 thus allows us to induce RNA decay using a viral trigger but carried out by a cellular endonuclease. top escapees identified by RNA-seq behave like SRE-containing transcripts. 293T cells were transfected with an empty vector (mock) or a plasmid expressing nsp1. total RNA was harvested and subjected to RT-qPCR to measure endogenous RNA levels. the mRNA 3 UTR contains an SRE. RNAfold secondary structure prediction of this UTR section revealed a long stem-loop structure with a bulge in the middle. mRNA is protected from herpesviral endonucleases by its 3 UTR and accumulates in the cytoplasm of iSLK.219 cells. after 24 h, total RNA was harvested and subjected to RT-qPCR to measure GFP mRNA levels. expression was increased upon KSHV lytic reactivation. we did not find differential shuttling upon KSHV lytic reactivation. therefore, C19ORF66 escapes SOX degradation by encoding an SRE-like element on its 3 UTR that allows it to escape host shutoff. iSLK.219 cells were either treated with siRNAs targeting C19ORF66 (or control nontarget siRNAs) for 48 h (B) or transfected with a Flag-tagged C19ORF66 (C). iSLK.219 cells were either treated with siRNAs targeting C19ORF66 (or control nontarget siRNAs) for 48 h (B) or transfected with a flag-tagged C19ORF66 (C) iSLK.219 cells treated with the siRNA against the supernatant. we quantified the expression of several KSHV viral genes. we harvested time points from 0 to 72 h after iSLK.219 reactivation. RNA was treated with siRNAs targeting C19ORF66 (or control nontarget siRNAs) for 48 h. RNA was then subjected to RT-qPCR to quantify expression of the indicated viral genes. prior analyses indicated that certain host mRNA transcripts robustly escape viral-induced RNA decay by encoding an RNA element in their 3 UTRs. gene ontology (GO) analysis on the transcripts spared from degradation revealed that they encode proteins that have a wide array of functions, ranging from ion binding to RNA binding.

C19ORF66 expression was increased upon KSHV lytic reactivation and continued to accumulate over time. iSLK.219 cells were reactivated and total protein harvested at various time points over the course of 96 h. iSLK.219 cells were either treated with siRNAs targeting C19ORF66 (or control nontarget siRNAs) for 48 h (B) or transfected with a Flag-tagged C19ORF66 (C). iSLK.219 cells were either treated with siRNAs targeting C19ORF66 (or control nontarget siRNAs) for 48 h (B) or transfected with a Flag-tagged C19ORF66 (C) supernatants were collected and used to spinfect 293T cells. twenty-four hours later, we observed a higher number of GFP-positive cells in the 293T cells infected with the supernatant coming from the iSLK.219 cells treated with the siRNA against C19ORF66. RNA was extracted from iSLK.219 cells treated with siRNAs targeting C19ORF66 (or control nontarget siRNAs) for 48 h and reactivated for the indicated times. RNA was then subjected to RT-qPCR to quantify expression of the indicated viral genes. IL-6 and GADD45B escape elements were shown to adopt a specific secondary structure that we hypothesized to be crucial in recruiting host proteins to the 3 UTR of these escaping transcripts. this RNA-protein protective complex appears to be composed of core proteins as well as accessory proteins that may be transcript dependent. this RNA-protein protective complex appears to be composed of core proteins as well as accessory proteins that may be transcript dependent. C19ORF66 was found to interact with the NS3 protein of hepatitis C virus (53), localize to the replication complex of DENV (33), and occasionally colocalize in the cytoplasmic compartment with HIV-1 Rev and Tat proteins (40). it was hypothesized that it may be mediated through its interaction with PABPC and LARP, two major RNA binding proteins (43). none of the 3 known escapees share significant sequence similarity. this underscores the utility of comparative approaches toward revealing broad regulators of viral infection. this underscores the utility of comparative approaches toward revealing broad regulators of viral infection. siRNAs were obtained from IDT as Dicer-substrate siRNA (DsiRNA; siRNA C19ORF66, hs.Ri.C19orf66.13.1). cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the cell pellet was lysed in 0.1% NP-40 PBS lysis buffer. supernatant transfers were carried in iSLK.219 cells lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (NaCl, 150 mM; Tris, 50 mM; NP-40, 0.5%; dithiothreitol [DTT], 1 mM; and protease inhibitor tablets) and quantified by Bradford assay. cells were transfected with constructs encoding fusion proteins between the herpesviral endonucleases (SOX, muSOX, BGLF5, and vh libraries were subjected to 100-base single-end sequencing on a hiSeq 4000. reads were then aligned to the human genome (hg38) by Bowtie2. read quality was assessed using fastqc. cells were reverse transfected in 6-well plates by inTERFERin (Polyplus Transfection) with 10 M siRNAs. siRNAs were obtained from IDT as Dicer-substrate siRNA (DsiRNA; siRNA C19ORF66, hs.Ri.C19orf66.13.1). cDNAs were synthesized from 1 g of total RNA using TRIzol. signals obtained by qPCR were normalized to those for 18S.
