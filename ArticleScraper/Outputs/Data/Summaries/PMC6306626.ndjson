{"summary": "an anonymous cross-sectional online survey was distributed among HCWs and trainees who worked or volunteered at the Hajj 2015-2017. only 11.6% (16/138) participants reported receiving all three vaccines, 15.2% (21/138) did not receive any vaccine, 76.1% (105/138) received meningococcal, 68.1% (94/138) influenza and 13.8% (19/138) pneumococcal vaccine. two major intercontinental outbreaks of meningococcal disease occurred during Hajj seasons of 1987 and again during 2000-01 seasons. meningococcal outbreaks from Hajj gathering have been a major global public health concern[4-6] in the last few decades. an estimated 70000 emergency room visits and 12000 hospitalisations occur during a typical Hajj season. a physician needs to see over 600 patients and a nurse looks after about 400 patients per day during a typical Hajj season. a quarter of HCW in Hajj medical admission developed acute respiratory infections, contact with pilgrims was a significant risk factor for acquisition of this infection. anonymous cross-sectional online survey was conducted among HCWs and trainees who worked or volunteered during the Hajj 2015-2017. the survey was distributed among HCWs, including trainees and students who worked or volunteered at Hajj, through their line managers or by visiting their hospitals and healthcare centres. 138 respondents participated in the survey. the age ranged from 20 to 59 years with a male to female ratio of 2.5:1. 88 per cent (n = 11) respondents were at increased risk either because of age or having a pre-existing medical condition.

Previously, a much lower vaccination rate (1.5%) was reported among \u201cat increased risk\u201d international pilgrims, but much higher uptake (29%-48%) among \u201cat increased risk\u201d pilgrims from developed countries is reported[50]. survey did not distinguish between polysaccharide and conjugate meningococcal vaccines. the questionnaire did not distinguish those who received the meningococcal vaccine in the previous years versus the current year. there is no data on the uptake of meningococcal, influenza, pneumococcal vaccines. there is no data on facilitators of vaccination among HCWs at Hajj. meningococcal outbreaks from Hajj gathering have been a major global public health concern. it is now compulsory for anyone who is going to attend Hajj congregation or serve the pilgrims to be vaccinated with a quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine. seasonal influenza vaccine is also highly advised for all Hajj attendees. females were more likely to receive a vaccine than males. lack of awareness is a key barrier and authority\u2019s advice is an important motivator."}
