{"summary": "the nomenclature of unexplained portal hypertension without cirrhosis of liver including NCPF, hepatoportal sclerosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, idiopathic portal hypertension and partial nodular transformation of the liver. the incidence of NCIPH has been linked to poor sanitation and hygiene, a reflection of living standards in the strata of society affected. large vWF multimers favour platelets to stick onto activated endothelium. it has been postulated that endothelial activation (vWF is an endothelial protein) leads to platelet plugs in the microcirculation in the liver in NCIPH17,18. review describes some environmental factors which may explain the predilection of NCIPH for India. angiopathy is present in a proportion of these patients. for diagnosis of NCIPH, absence of significant fibrosis, i.e. bridging fibrosis/cirrhosis, is mandatory. liver biopsy also excludes alternative aetiology (e.g. steatosis, steatohepatitis and significant inflammation) and mimickers of NCIPH. hepatic venous pressure measurements (balloon or catheter wedge technique19) can help differentiate cirrhosis from NCIPH. as the disease process (and the gradient) in NCIPH is presinusoidal, hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is expected to be normal in these patients. however, this is true only in one-third of the patients with NCIPH. multiple reports corroborate the fact that NCIPH remains prevalent in India20,21,22,23. prevalence greatly varies depending on the group of patients studied and modalities used for diagnosis. diagnostic of NCIPH is confirmed only with liver biopsy30. only 39 (19%) patients were subjected to liver biopsy evaluation20. pathogenesis of NCIPH remains poorly understood and has limited treatment options available. most patients with NCIPH belonged to low and middle socio-economic status20. limited access to clean drinking water, inadequate sewage facilities and continued close existence with animals contribute to a state of mild gut inflammation (environmental enteropathy) in India. tropical enteropathy may be adaptive response to recurrent intestinal infections. but the sporadic cases of tropical sprue suggest that the environmental causative factors are still present in India. in long-standing cases, cancer (of skin, lungs, liver, kidney and urinary bladder) can develop55,56. in long-standing cases, cancer (of skin, lungs, liver, kidney and urinary bladder) can develop55,56. senic in hair, nail or urine samples, with no overt clinical manifestations, was seen in 10 per cent of adults and six per cent of children residing in the affected localities. Typical skin lesions of arsenicosis (hyperpigmentation and keratosis) were seen in 10 per cent of adults and six per cent of children from these localities. the lack of progression to portal hypertension in mice exposed to arsenic for prolonged periods suggests that arsenic exposure alone is not sufficient to produce NCIPH in mice70. hypovitaminosis B12 Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in general population of India71. 33 per cent had portal hypertension and 41 patients had liver biopsy findings suggesting NCIPH54. most patients with NCIPH belonged to low and middle socio-economic status20. enteropathy Microangiopathy restricted to intrahepatic small portal vein radicles suggests the active involvement of gut in the pathogenesis of NCIPH. sporadic cases of tropical sprue are no longer reported in India. small intestinal bacterial growth occurs in patients with tropical sprue46. low-grade small intestinal bacterial growth is common in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in India47. arsenic contamination of groundwater and water used for drinking continues to be documented on a significant scale in Bihar59, Uttar Pradesh60 and west Bengal61. the population affected by arsenic in India in 2018 was estimated to be 1.48 crores62. individuals consuming arsenic-laden drinking water continue to be diagnosed with NCIPH63. Attempts to treat NCIPH with arsenic chelating agents have shown limited success64. the urgent need is to educate the public about the arsenic contamination of groundwater. low serum vitamin B12 level in patients with unexplained portal hypertension is a marker of NCIPH74. if vitamin B12 deficiency predisposes to NCIPH in areas with endemic arsenicosis in India is unclear at present. 156 patients with skin arsenicosis, 33 per cent had portal hypertension and 41 patients had liver biopsy findings suggesting NCIPH54. 'Poverty-linked thrombophilia' is probably secondary to environmental factors, especially related to gut inflammation. tropical sprue was initially reported in residents of india as a cause of malabsorption38. sporadic cases of tropical sprue suggest that the environmental causative factors are still present in India. systematic studies looking for enteropathy in NCIPH patients unearthed an unexplained enteropathy. it is significantly higher in NCIPH patients compared to patients with hepatitis B or C causing portal hypertension (disease controls) and in healthy controls50. arsenic levels in groundwater, water used for irrigation and food materials continue to be documented on a significant scale in Bihar59, Uttar Pradesh60 and west Bengal61. the population affected by arsenic in India in 2018 was estimated to be 1.48 crores62. the urgent need is to educate the public about the arsenic contamination of groundwater. the water supply needs to be continuously monitored for arsenic contamination. rainwater harvesting (thus avoiding use of contaminated groundwater is another suggested option) low serum vitamin B12 predicts lack of advanced hepatic fibrosis in patients with intrahepatic portal hypertension. if vitamin B12 deficiency predisposes to NCIPH in areas with endemic arsenicosis in India. 33 per cent of patients with skin arsenicosis had portal hypertension. 41 patients had liver biopsy findings suggesting NCIPH54. platelet sequestration onto endothelium is a characteristic feature of NCIPH. ADAMTS13 is a vWF-cleaving protease synthesized almost exclusively by hepatic stellate cells. in advancing cirrhosis, the plasma levels of ADAMTS13 also decrease. ADAMTS13 deficiency was seen in five patients in child's C cirrhosis81. genetic predisposition to microangiopathy NCIPH may be considered as a localized form of thrombotic microangiopathy. there is evidence of low ADAMTS135,17,18, and alternative complement system activation99,100, being involved in its pathogenesis. thrombotic microangiopathy is known to be associated with mutations in alternative complement pathway108. mutations render the alternative complement system hyperactive with loss of natural suppression. isolated reports of NCIPH occurring in childhood and families suggesting a possible role of genetic predisposition. low ADAMTS135,17,18, and alternative complement system activation99,100 involved in pathogenesis. both mutations in ADAMTS13 and the complement regulators are known to predispose to thrombotic microangiopathy102,103,104,105. a rare non-synonymous variant in ADAMTS13 gene was detected in a single patient with NCIPH. 69 CIPH patients reportedly had a family history of liver disease29. none of the 69 patients reportedly had a family history of liver disease90. thrombotic microangiopathy is known to be associated with mutations in alternative complement pathway108. mutations render the alternative complement system hyperactive with loss of natural suppression. no significant association with single nucleotide polymorphism at rs6677604. the gut could promote endothelial-platelet interaction leading to occlusion of intrahepatic portal vein radicles in NCIPH. impact may be more prominent in lower socio-economic categories."}
