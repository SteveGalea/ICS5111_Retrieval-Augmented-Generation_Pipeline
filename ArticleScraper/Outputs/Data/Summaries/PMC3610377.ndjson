{"summary": "tumorigenic activity is mediated through activation of the pro-inflammatory transcriptional factor NF-B which induces the expression of genes linked to cancer progression and development. despite the profound cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of TNF- on primary tumors, its undesirable effect of activating NF-B signaling and pro-metastatic nature limit its use widely for cancer patients [11] saikosaponin-d (Ssd) is one of the major triterpenoid saponins derived from Bupleurum falcatum L. (Umbelliferae), commonly prescribed for inflammatory and infectious diseases. its active component Ssd was reported to have immune-modulatory, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, and anticancer activities. targeted genes expression for cancer cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and survival. abolish TNF--induced cancer cell invasion, blockage of HUVEC angiogenesis, and induce apoptosis via loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from Clonetics. all cell cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% humidified CO2 incubator. for cell cytotoxicity assay, Ssd was dissolved in DMSO at final concentration of 100 mM. 100 L of Opti-MEM was mixed with 1 g of constitutively active IKK- plasmid DNA together with 3 L of PLUS reagent at room temperature for 5 min. the transfected cells were cultured in 37\u00b0C incubator for at least 24 h and then suggested to cell seeding for MTT assay. cells were grown on glass coverslips in six-well plates (35 mm diameter) after exposure to 10 M Ssd and 20 ng/mL TNF-, cells were washed once with PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. cells were then washed with PBS for two times and stained with DAPI (Sigma) for 15 min to visualize cell nucleus. the cells invaded through the ECM layer to the bottom of the polycarbonate membrane were labeled with Cell Stain provided in the kit for 20 min at room temperature. the non-invading cells were gently removed from the interior of the inserts by using a cotton-tipped swab. the number of invaded cells was counted through the microscope. an artificial wound was created by using mechanical scratching of the cell monolayer [20]. cells were incubated for further 16 or 24 h with the presence of 5 or 10 M Ssd. images at 0, 16, and 24 h were analyzed using Java's Image J software. cells were subjected to fluorescence imaging using photometrics CoolSNAP HQ2 camera on the Olympus IX71-Applied Precision DeltaVision restoration microscope. cells with green fluorescence signal represent live cells, while cells with red fluorescence signal represent dead cells. the human liver cancer cell line HepG2, human cervix cancer cell line HeLa, and human normal lung fibroblast CCD19Lu were maintained in MEM. the human lung carcinoma cell line H1299 was maintained in DMEM. 100 L of Opti-MEM/LTX PLUS reagent/constitutive IKK- plasmid mixture was added dropwise onto the cells. transfected cells were cultured in 37\u00b0C incubator for at least 24 h. the total cell extracts were harvested after 15 min for Western blotting analysis. the fractionated cytosolic proteins (50 g) and nuclear extracts (30 g) were resolved by 10% SDS/PAGE. after electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane which was then blocked with 5% dried milk for 60 min. membrane was then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 60 min. images were captured by a photometrics CoolSNAP HQ2 CCD camera on the Olympus IX71-Applied Precision DeltaVision restoration microscope. cell invasion assay was performed in a cell invasion chamber, a 24-well tissue culture plate with cell culture inserts. the cells invaded through the ECM layer to the bottom of the polycarbonate membrane were labeled with Cell Stain provided in the kit. the angiogenic activity of HUVEC under different treatments was determined by counting the branch points of the tubes formed in the well. an artificial wound was created by using mechanical scratching of the cell monolayer [20] the denuded area in each well was captured. cell washed with PBS prior to fluorescence imaging using photometrics CoolSNAP HQ2 camera on the Olympus IX71-Applied Precision DeltaVision restoration microscope. orange-fluorescent signal indicates the cells with hyperpolarized membrane potentials, while green-fluorescent signal indicates the cells with depolarized membrane potentials. human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) and human liver cancer cells (HepG2) were used to demonstrate the general sensitizing effect of Ssd on TNF-mediated cell death in cancer cells. treatment with DMSO control and TNF- (20 ng/mL) alone indicated no significant cell death (red-fluorescent) in both cancer cell types. JC-1 dye exhibits potential-dependent accumulation in mitochondria. a fluorescence emission shift from green (529 nm) to orange (590 nm) treatment with DMSO control and TNF- (20 ng/mL) alone showed no significant damage to mitochondrial health (orange fluorescence) in HeLa cells. however, treatment with Ssd (10 M) showed 40% of cells with the loss of (m) by decreasing in the orange/green fluorescence intensity ratio. the percentage of dead cells was quantified for HeLa and HepG2. orange-fluorescent signal indicates the cells with hyperpolarized membrane potentials, while green-fluorescent signal indicates the cells with depolarized membrane potentials. 2 cells were pretreated with indicated concentrations of Ssd for 1 h prior to 15 min stimulation with TNF-. results showed that Ssd inhibited TNF-induced IB degradation in a dose-dependent manner. cytosolic and nuclear extracts were then prepared for Western blotting analysis using antibody against p65. the nuclear translocation of NF-B p65 was detected by antibody against p65. results showed that there was no expression in the nuclear region of the untreated control cells. however, addition of TNF- strongly stimulated nuclear translocation of p65 in HeLa cells. c.IKK--NF-B signaling abrogates the Additive Effect of TNF- and Ssd in the Ssd-Mediated Cell Cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells. cells were pretreated with 10 M Ssd for 60 min and then treated with TNF- for 30 min. addition of TNF- would further enhance the Ssd-mediated cell cytotoxicity with mean IC50 = 4.5 M. however, constitutively activation of IKK--NF-B signaling in HepG2 cells abrogated the potentiating effect of TNF- in the presence of TNF-. the emerging evidence suggest that TNF- would activate NF-B signaling. expression was markedly upregulated upon TNF- treatment. however, treatment of Ssd could effectively suppress the TNF-mediated expression of these NF-B targeted genes in both cancer cells. Ssd downregulates TNF--induced NF-B-dependent invasive genes expression. cells were pretreated with 20 ng/mL TNF- for 60 min and subjected to 10 M of Ssd treatment. anti-apoptotic proteins like c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 can modulate the activity of caspase 8 through TRAF2 binding. another anti-apoptotic protein FLIP can regulate the cell surface death receptor activation of caspase 8 through resembling to caspase 8 [39] or expression of decoy receptors for TRAIL [40]. Ssd abates TNF--NF-B-mediated anti-apoptotic genes expression in cancer cells. whole cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting. H1299 cells were seeded into the insert of an ECMatrix invasion chamber. however, the addition of Ssd could dose-dependently reduce the number of invaded cells even in the presence of TNF-. invasive cells were counted in the lower layer of ECMatrix chamber membrane. ***P 0.01 and ***P 0.001 compared to medium control and TNF- treatment alone. with VEGF, HUVECs were induced to form EC tube networks in vitro. but 10 M of Ssd markedly inhibited the formation of EC tube networks by around 50%. results indicated that Ssd was able to suppress HUVEC's migration in a dose-dependent manner. the numbers of the tube formed were quantified under light microscope. the HUVECs were incubated onto gelatin-coated plates for 24 h. an artificial wound was created and the denuded area in each well was captured using Motic Image Plus microscope. treatment with DMSO control and TNF- (20 ng/mL) alone showed no significant cell death (red-fluorescent) in both cancer cell types. however, treatment with Ssd (10 M) alone showed a certain effect on cell viability by presenting the increased number of cells with red-fluorescent signal. combination of Ssd with TNF- resulted in more than 80% of cells with green-fluorescent intensity. 80% of cells with green-fluorescent intensity were treated with 10 M of Ssd with or without 20 ng/mL TNF- for 24 h. more than 5000 cells were scored from 5 different views of captured images. the suppressive effect of Ssd on TNF-induced IB degradation was examined from 0 to 60 min. translocation of p65 in a dose-dependent manner is suppressed by Ssd treatment. phosphorylation of p65 is required for transcriptional activity and translocation to the nucleus. we also visualized the suppressive effect of Ssd on p65 nuclear translocation. the IB in cytosolic extracts was detected by Western blotting. the cytosolic and nuclear extracts were harvested for detection of p65. the total cell extracts were harvested for detection of p65. treatment in the presence or absence of TNF- (20 ng/mL) for 72 h. results are mean SD from three independent experiments. NF-B activation induces cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression by regulating the expression of the targeted genes. c-myc and cyclin D1 were treated with TNF- in the presence or absence of 10 M Ssd for the indicated periods of time (0\u201324 h) angiogenesis is the process where endothelial cells build new blood vessels from existing vasculature. inhibiting angiogenesis may be an effective way to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. c-IAP-related genes provide very potent protection against proapoptotic stimuli. antiapoptotic activity of XIAP is attributed by its ability to bind and suppress caspases. c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 being recruited to TNFR-1 and -2 signaling complexes modulate the activity of caspase 8 through TRAF2 binding. NF-induced expression of target genes including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, XIAP, c-IAP2 and survivin was markedly suppressed by Ssd in a time-dependent manner. it is interesting to know whether Ssd alone would activate apoptotic mediators, leading to apoptosis in cancer cells. hepG2 and HeLa cells were treated with indicated concentrations of Ssd (7.5, 10, 12.5 or 15 M) for 24 h. whole cell extracts were then prepared analyzed using antibodies against procaspases 3, 7 and 9. actin was used as loading control. stained and counted invasive cells in lower layer of ECMatrix chamber. effective dose of Ssd in suppression of cell invasion activity is between 1 and 5 M. effective dose of Ssd in suppression of cell invasion activity is between 1 and 5 M. studies show binding of TNF- to distinct receptor, TNFR2/p75, promotes ischemia-induced angiogenesis via modulation of several angiogenic growth factors. aforesaid, VEGF and COX-2 are the angiogenic growth factors to promote angiogenesis during cancer development [31]. d in the suppression of HUVEC's tube formation and cell migration is between 5 and 10 M which showed no significant cell cytotoxicity in HUVECs. d suggests that the antiangiogenic effect of Ssd is specific, but not due to its direct cell cytotoxicity. clinical benefits of TNF-are limited as it induces NF-B-dependent proinflammatory and antiapoptotic genes expression that causes resistance to chemotherapy in many types of tumors. chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel has been shown to induce soluble TNF- production in macrophages. this alterations in tumor necrosis factor signaling pathways are associated with cytotoxicity and resistance to taxanes in tumor cells. cytotoxic effect of Ssd plus TNF- on cancer cells was abated by constitutive activation of IKK-. results suggest that Ssd may target the upstream signaling pathway of IKK-. c-myc promoter is transcriptionally regulated by nuclear factor of the activated T cells. recent studies show that ICAM-1 activation is necessary to induce the tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) and a subsequent decrease in the extent of cancer cell invasiveness. the results clearly demonstrated that Ssd is less toxic to human normal lung fibroblast; it could also markedly inhibit the TNF-induced invasive ability of H1299 human lung cancer cells at nontoxic concentrations. cl-xL, XIAP, c-IAP2, FLIP, and survivin have been correlated with survival, chemoresistance, and radioresistance in numerous tumors. recent studies provide evidence that Ssd could sensitize cervical and ovarian cancers to cisplatin through ROS-mediated apoptosis. Ssd showed low cytotoxic effect on human normal lung fibroblasts. all findings shed light on potential use of Ssd as a candidate adjuvant agent."}
