{"summary": "the human complement receptor type 1 (CR1) is an innate immune recognition glycoprotein that regulates the activation of the complement pathway and removes opsonized immune complexes. five distinct CR1 nucleotide substitutions determine the Knops blood group phenotypes, namely Kna/b, McCa/b, Sl1/Sl2, Sl4/Sl5 and KCAM+/-. the gene encoding human CR1 is located on chromosome 1 (1q32.2; OMIM 120620) the gene encoding human CR1 is located on chromosome 1 (1q32.2; OMIM 120620) CR1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein (single chain type 1). it is predominantly involved in the transport of circulating immune complexes to the reticuloendothelial system. in vitro studies have shown that CR1 has distinct adjuvant properties [13\u201316] probably due to its involvement in uptake of antigen by antigen-presenting cells. CR1 protein levels are associated with disease susceptibility. CR1 is associated with the pathogenesis caused by SARS-CoV [32], adenoviruses [33] and other viral infections such as HIV and HCV [30,31]. CR1 is associated with the pathogenesis caused by SARS-CoV [32], adenoviruses [33] and other viral infections such as HIV and HCV [30]. a fragment of 884 bp in exon 29 of the CR1 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications were carried out in a 25 l volume of reaction mixture containing 10X PCR buffer, 3.0 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.2 M of each primer, 1 unit of Taq polymerase. cycling parameters were initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 5 minutes followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 30 seconds and elongation at 72\u00b0C for 1 minute. PCR fragments were stained with SYBR Safe DNA Gel Stain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) and visualized on 1.5% agarose gels. 198 (100) 170 (99) 154 (100) 154 (100) G 20 (10) 0 2 (1) 0 0 rs41274768G/A GG 98 (96) 99 (100) 85 (99) 77 (100) 77 (100) 77 (100) NA GA 4 (4) 0 1 (1) 0 0 AA 0 0 0 0 0 G 200 (98) 198 (100) 171 (99) normal Chi square and two tailed Fisher\u2019s exact tests were calculated to determine the differences of genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies among the different ethnicities. the significance of deviations from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium was tested using the approach of Guo and Thompson random-permutation procedure implemented in Arlequin v3.5.2.2 software. study population A total of 441 DNA samples from healthy individuals were used. a fragment of 884 bp in exon 29 of the CR1 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) PCR fragments were stained with SYBR Safe DNA Gel Stain.

Distribution of CR1 haplotypes in world populations. CR1 genetic variants in exon 29 are associated with CR1 expression levels, C1q or C3b binding activity and increased susceptibility to various infectious diseases. this study investigated the entire exon 29 of CR1 in five diverse populations in order to assess the distribution of Knops blood group antigens. rs17047660A/G (McCa/b) and rs1704661A/G (Sl1/Sl2) loci are expected in sub-Saharan africa populations exposed to distinct pathogenic challenges. this selective advantage occurs mainly in immune genes involved in pathogen recognition and signaling, and the CR1 is one of such genes involved in innate immunity. the reported frequencies in other studied Asian and Brazilian populations were in accordance with the frequencies described in the 1000 Genomes database. there is growing evidence of ethnic differences in susceptibility to some infectious diseases and of genetic adaptation to diverse pathogens [18,35]. the presence of rs1704661G (McCb) and rs1704661G (Sl2) alleles suggests that rs1704661A (Sl1) may be the ancestral allele [43] also a differential distribution of rs6691117A/G (KCAM+/-) variants was observed in the Vietnamese and Brazilian groups. this study revealed significant differences in allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies of CR1 SNPs in five populations. a limitation of this study might be a small sample size. further studies are warranted with increased sample sizes."}
