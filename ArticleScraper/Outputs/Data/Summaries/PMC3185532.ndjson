{"summary": "PKR is a latent serine/threonine kinase of 551 amino acids with two consecutive N-terminal dsRNA-binding motifs, a linker domain, and a C-terminal kinase domain. this allows back-to-back dimerization with the kinase domain facing outwards, and the concomitant autophosphorylation of the critical threonine residues 446 and 451 in the the increased affinity of phosphorylated eIF2 for eIF2B leads to sequestration of this rate limiting factor. PKR can act as signal transducer in the IB/NFB pathway. PKR can also be activated by the polyanionic molecule heparin [15] or the protein activator PACT [16]. a 5\u2032-triphosphate group (activating RIG-I) to the list of viral PAMPs. PKR is able to recognize viral RNA from a broad range of virus families. the repertoire of PKR activating RNA molecules goes beyond the canonical dsRNA. PKR consists of two dsRNA-binding motifs (dsRBM1 + dsRBM2 in light green) and the N-terminal and C-terminal lobe of the kinase domain (dark green) poly(I:C) is easy to work with; however, the stretches of dsRNA are heterogeneous in length and inosine is a relatively rare ribonucleotide in cells or viruses [24 long duplex RNA, the canonical PKR activator, does not depend on 5\u2032-triphosphates. however, this modification is critical for the activation of PKR by shorter RNAs with a 16 bp stem loop and 10 to 15 nt single-stranded tails. internal nucleoside modifications, which are quite common in cellular RNAs, reduce the ability of RNAs to serve as PKR PAMPs. studies also add another caveat regarding the use of in vitro transcripts. dsRNA possesses a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity that can result in non-templated hairpin RNAs as byproducts of the transcription reaction. this necessitates purification by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to isolate the intended RNA products. fluorescence microscopy using an antibody that detects dsRNA >40bp [39\u201341] also confirmed the presence of dsRNA in cells infected with reovirus which has a dsRNA genome [42] and virus families with a positive-strand RNA genome. conflicting data regarding the IRES element of hepatitis C virus has been suggested to either inhibit [50] or activate PKR. dsRNA has been extracted from influenza A virus infected cells [59]. a dsRNA-specific antibody did not detect significant levels of dsRNA in cells infected with the influenza A wild-type virus or a deletion virus (NS1) that lacks the PKR inhibitor NS1 [28,39,62]. a recent study addressing the role of PACT in viral infection by using PACT knockout mice neither detected an alteration of dsRNA induced phospho studies by Hatada et al. showed that PKR can be activated in vitro by purified influenza A virion RNA and a model vRNA. both RNA species carry a 5\u2032-triphosphate group and engage in base-pairing between partially complementary 5\u2032-terminal and 3\u2032-terminal ends. vRNAs are complexed with nucleoprotein and the viral polymerase proteins forming ribonucleoproteins (vRNP w structure may not be covered in all the vRNP complexes produced during virus infection. phosphatase treatment strongly reduced activation of PKR by synthetic influenza virus model vRNA containing the terminal 5\u2032- and 3\u2032- ends, indicating a contribution of the 5\u2032-triphosphate. most genomic RNAs of single-stranded RNA viruses carry a 5\u2032-triphosphate group. this was shown for Zaire Ebola virus (Filoviridae), Nipah virus and measles virus (Paramyxoviridae), Lassa virus (Arenaviridae), Rift Valley fever virus (Bunyaviridae), rabies virus and vesicular stomatitis virus (Rhabd some members of the Paramyxoviridae actually produce long duplex RNAs under conditions where synthesis of genomic and antigenomic RNA is not tightly regulated. findings indicate that the C protein prevents excessive RNA synthesis, thus preventing the production of dsRNA and activation of PKR. some paramyxoviruses do not require a PKR inhibitor, as they tightly regulate the replication process and thus keep viral RNA at a level that can be complexed by nucleocapsid proteins. poly(I:C) is easy to work with; however, the stretches of dsRNA are heterogeneous in length and inosine is a relatively rare ribonucleotide in cells or viruses. internal nucleoside modifications, which are quite common in cellular RNAs, reduce the ability of RNAs to serve as PKR PAMPs. the requirement for a 5\u2032-triphosphate group to activate PKR seems to depend on the structure of the RNA. dsRNA can be detected by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. most widely used antibody only detects dsRNAs >40bp [35]. dsRNAs extracted from infected cells are not complexed with proteins, as they would have been in the cell. positive-strand RNA genomes include togaviridae (rubella virus, Semliki Forest virus, Sindbis virus [43,44]), Coronaviridae (SARS corona virus [39], Picornaviridae (encephalomyocarditis virus [39]), and Flaviviridae (Kunjin virus, poliovirus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, hepatitis C virus, dengue virus [45\u201348 dsRNA has been extracted from influenza A virus infected cells [59]. a dsRNA-specific antibody did not detect significant levels of dsRNA in cells infected with the influenza A wild-type virus. it is possible that PKR is activated by PACT, which would not require dsRNA. vRNAs carry a 5\u2032-triphosphate group and engage in base-pairing between partially complementary 5\u2032-terminal and 3\u2032-terminal ends. vRNAs are complexed with nucleoprotein and the viral polymerase proteins forming ribonucleoproteins (vRNP) in infected cells vRNAs are complexed with nucleoprotein and the viral polymerase proteins forming ribonucleoproteins. the phosphatase used would hydrolyze the 5\u2032-triphosphate, remove the phosphate groups on activated PKR and ATP. elimination of the phosphatase by phenol extraction would destroy the RNP structure. however, a natural viral RNA/RNP with a 5\u2032-triphosphate group can trigger PKR activation. ah virus and measles virus (Paramyxoviridae), Lassa virus (Arenaviridae), rabies virus and vesicular stomatitis virus (Rhabdoviridae) are potential PKR PAMPs. some viruses such as Hantaan virus carry a 5\u2032-monophosphate, possibly to escape detection by host cell innate immune mechanisms. takeuchi et al. showed significant amounts of dsRNA were detected by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy in cells infected with a mutant virus expressing an inactive C protein. their findings indicate that the C protein prevents excessive RNA synthesis, thus preventing the production of dsRNA and activation of PKR. PKR inhibitory mechanisms are manifold and include sequestration of viral dsRNA by a viral protein, prevention of PKR activation through direct interaction with viral proteins or viral decoy RNA, regulation of eIF2 phosphorylation through a viral pseudosubstrate or recruitment of a cellular phosphatase. this inhibition of PKR is critical for virus production. mutant viruses with loss-of-inhibition mutations in the NS1 gene are severely attenuated in PKR+/+ but not in PKR\u2013/\u2013 mice and embryonic fibroblasts. both NS1 proteins are multifunctional proteins consisting of 202\u2013237 and 281 amino acids (aa) both NS1 proteins downregulate the RIG-I mediated activation of type I IFN genes. vRNA was detected in PKR-NS1 immunoprecipitates from infected cell lysate. the key activity of the B/NS1 dsRNA binding domain is to silence PKR. the key activity of the dsRNA binding domain is to silence PKR. dsRNA-binding by the NS1 protein is not essential for inhibition of PKR. inhibition of PKR was shown to correlate with an interaction of NS1 and PKR abolished by mutation of the NS1 residues 123/124 or 126/127. gene knockout of p58IPK leads to increased lung pathology, immune cell apoptosis, PKR activation and mortality in influenza A virus infected mice. p58IPK may rather be seen as a control mechanism to limit an excessive PKR response and prolong host survival than as a strategy of influenza virus to inhibit PKR. recombinant RVFV expressing mutant NSs protein prevents transcriptional induction of type I interferon genes. degradation of PKR seems to be unique to RVFV as a recombinant RVFV expressing NSs protein of the sandfly fever Sicilian virus (genus Phlebovirus) or the LaCrosse virus (genus Orthobunyavirus) lacked this activity. VP35 contains an N-terminal coiled-coil domain required for its oligomerization. mutation or deletion of the coiled-coil domain destroyed the capacity to inhibit PKR and prevent IRF3 activation. mutation or deletion of the coiled-coil domain destroyed the capacity to inhibit PKR and prevent IRF3 activation [80,135]. cytomegalovirus human cytomegalovirus encodes two related proteins, pTRS1 and pIRS1, which bind dsRNA and block activation of PKR. neither of the proteins by itself is essential for viral replication. deletion of both genes in HCMV[I/T] resulted in a severe replication defect, inhibition of cellular and viral protein synthesis and phosphorylation of eIF2 [41] in HCMV infection PKR is not totally depleted from the cytoplasm. pTRS1 and pIRS1 interact with dsRNA and PKR. both proteins act as PKR inhibitors but are needed for inhibition. relocalization could sequester PKR to compartments where it cannot exert its antiviral action. influenza A and B virus NS1 proteins (A/NS1 and B/NS1 respectively) function as PKR antagonists. this inhibition is critical for virus production, as mutant viruses with defects in the NS1 gene are potent PKR activators. both NS1 proteins carry a similarly structured N-terminal dsRNA binding domain located at positions 1\u201373 (type A) and 1\u201393 (type B) both NS1 proteins bind to the same RNAs in vitro including synthetic dsRNA, U6 RNA, and poly(A)-RNA. NS1 protein was restored to wild-type levels in PKR\u2013/\u2013 mice and fibroblasts. early studies suggested an important role of the dsRNA-binding activity. dsRNA binding-deficient NS1 mutant protein did not inhibit PKR activation and eIF2 phosphorylation by dsRNA. p58IPK is activated at the post-transcriptional level, interacts with PKR and reduces PKR-mediated eIF2 phosphorylation. p58IPK is activated at the post-transcriptional level, interacts with PKR and reduces PKR-mediated eIF2 phosphorylation, thus increasing viral mRNA translation. kinase plays a major role in limiting virus production and pathogenicity of RVFVs lacking the NSs gene. NSs protein also prevents transcriptional induction of the type I interferon genes. degradation of PKR seems to be unique to RVFV as a recombinant RVFV expressing NSs protein of the sandfly fever Sicilian virus lacked this activity. poliovirus RNA and proteins are required, but cellular rather than the viral proteases seem to be involved in the degradation [128]. VP35 abrogates type I IFN induction by inhibiting activation of IRF3 and IRF7 through inhibition of the IRF3 kinases TBK1/IKK and modulation of the sumoylation machinery. pTRS1 and pIRS1 bind dsRNA and block activation of PKR. neither protein by itself is essential for viral replication. deletion of both genes in HCMV[I/T] resulted in a severe replication defect. both pTRS1 and pIRS1 interact with PKR and this requires the C-terminus of either protein [145] hakki et al. further showed that PKR accumulates in the nucleus of HCMV infected cells and in VVE3L infected cells coexpressing pTRS1. m142/m143 deletion virus activated the OAS/RNaseL pathway. neither MCMV nor the m142/m143 deletion virus activated the OAS/RNaseL pathway. PKR accumulated in the nucleus and insoluble fractions in the cytoplasm of infected cells. technical challenge concerns the characterization of structures within natural viral nucleic acids, which trigger PKR activation inside cells. research will provide valuable insights into the ongoing arms race between viral pathogens and their hosts."}
