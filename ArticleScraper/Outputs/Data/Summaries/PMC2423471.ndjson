{"summary": "ISG15 from Old World Monkeys (OWm) is a hyper-efficient protein modifier. Western blot analysis visualized more efficient conjugation of OWmISG15 relative to HuISG15 in human cell-lines. IFN Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15) is an Ubiquitin (Ub)-Like molecule. it is highly induced upon both type I and type II IFN treatment. it is expressed as a 17 kDa protein, containing 2 Ub domains and a C-terminal oligopeptide. around 400 proteins are recognized as Ub-Ligases or E3s. around 400 proteins are recognized as Ub-Ligases or E3s. most UbLs are synthesized as inactive precursors. Ub Specific Protease 2 (USP2), USP5 (also named Isopeptidase T), USP13 (IsoT3) and USP14 have been identified as proteases with a dual specificity for Ub and ISG15 [16], [17]. the protease of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus counteracts ISG15 functioning by removing it from its substrate [20]. ISGylation is believed to counteract Ubiquitination by competing for the same Lys in substrates. studies with UbcH6 and UbcH13 showed that ISGylation of these E2s hampered their ability to form a thiolester intermediate with Ub [27], [28]. ISG15 orthologues show low degree of amino acid conservation. ISG15 from different species were aligned with two molecules of Ubiquitin using Clustalx [61] with a conservation threshold of 7. OWmISG15 readily ISGylates human proteins Total ISGylation patterns were visualized by Western blot analysis on total cell lysates. AgmISG15 and RhmISG15 outperform HOmISG15 and MoISG15 in its ISGylation capacity in human cells. human HekT cells, (B) monkey COS cells and (C) mouse N38 cells were only transfected with expression vectors for the indicated ISG15 orthologues. a tandem proteinA binding domain and FLAG-tag, separated by a Tobacco Etch Virus protease cleavage domain was fused N-terminally to Hu or AgmISG15. ISGylated targets identified by TAP purification and LC-MS/MS identification of AgmISG15 outnumber those of HuISG15. cDNAs of the Ub-Conjugating enzymes were isolated by RT-PCR from 2fTGH cells. western blot analysis on total cell lysates containing -ME confirmed ISGylation of UbcH10, H13 and H17 with AgmISG15. co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed by binding ISGylated proteins through ISG15's FLAG-tag to an anti-FLAG affinity gel. the bound proteins were visualized by an anti-V5 Ab. all the experiments were performed without co-transfection of UbE1L and/or UbcH8 or IFN stimulus. residues that differ between HuISG15 and AgmISG15 are shown as space filing spheres. colored residues are dissimilar residues situated near the interaction site with UbE1L predicted by Narasimhan et al. closed arrow indicates the unconjugated form of UbcH10. open arrow indicates the ISG15-conjugated form of UbcH10. only mutation of residue 89 in wild type HuISG15 to an acidic amino acid is able to enhance its ISGylation activity. arrow indicates the ISG15-conjugated form of UbcH17. lower panel The blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-FLAG Ab showing the global ISGylation pattern. equal loading was controlled by staining with Ponceau S staining. the region 563\u2013569 in HuUbE1L shows two substitutions (S565L and W568R, red coloured) in the corresponding region of RhmUbE1L, which better resembles the corresponding region. this residue is substituted with an Arg residue in OWmUbE1L. we performed an in vitro assay analyzing the loading of either HuISG15 or AgmISG15 with HuUbE1 or HuUbE1L. thiolester formation of both ISG15 orthologues with HuUbE1L was observed. 2.5 M UbcH8 was incubated with 200 nM of either UbE1 or UbE1L, and 7.5 M of either mature Hu- or AgmISG15 under conditions described in Materials and Methods. the proteins were stained with IRDye Blue protein stain and visualized using the Odyssey infrared imaging system. ISG15 from different species were aligned to two Ub molecules. the N- and C-terminal part of ISG15 share respectively 32 and 37% sequence identity with Ub. the variability largely exceeds what can be expected by genetic drift alone. OWmISG15 conjugates more favorably to human proteins compared to OWmISG15. the same blot was stripped and reprobed with an antibody recognizing Hu and OWmISG15. OWmISG15s conjugate more efficiently to target proteins. cells were only transfected with expression vectors for the indicated ISG15 orthologues, without extra stimulation. details of the identified peptides can be found in Table S1. ISGylated targets identified by TAP purification and LC-MS/MS identification of AgmISG15 outnumber those of HuISG15. the cDNAs of the Ub-Conjugating enzymes UbcH6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 16 and 17 were isolated by RT-PCR from 2fTGH cells. these constructs were transfected in HekT cells together with either a mock construct, HuISG15 or AgmISG15. V5-tagged UbcH7, H10, H13, H17 proteins were co-expressed in HekT cells with either FLAG-tagged Hu- or AgmISG15. all the experiments were performed without co-transfection of UbE1L and/or UbcH8 or IFN stimulus. Activating enzyme, UbE1L, predicted by Narasimhan et al. [35]. both conjugation to various UbcHs and total ISGylation patterns of different HuISG15 mutants were tested. HuISG15 N89D mutant significantly increases its ISGylation capacity to UbcH proteins. hekT cells were transiently transfected with a vector encoding V5-tagged UbcH10 together with either empty vector or a vector expressing HuISG15 or variants (indicated with asterisk) or AgmISG15. Western blot analysis on total cell lysates was performed under reducing conditions using anti-V5 Ab. closed arrow indicates the unconjugated form of UbcH17, open arrow indicates the ISG15-conjugated form of UbcH17. lower panel The blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-FLAG Ab. equal loading was controlled by staining with Ponceau S staining. we compared the sequences of Hu and OWmUbE1L in their predicted interfaces with ISG15. this superposition brings the critical residue 89 in ISG15 in the interaction interface with UbE1L. this superposition brings the critical residue 89 in ISG15 in the interaction interface with UbE1L. the region 563\u2013569 in HuUbE1L shows two substitutions (S565L and W568R, red coloured) in the corresponding region of RhmUbE1L, which better resembles the corresponding region in HuUbE1 (K607). this observation prompted us to test whether AgmISG15 could be activated by HuUbE1. ylation level of AgmISG15, overexpression of both UbE1L and UbE1 were able to further markedly enhance its conjugation capacity. in vitro assay revealing the capability of AgmISG15 to form thiolester bonds with UbE1. ISG15 is not well conserved between animals, plants and fungi. this variability in ISG15 sequence may indicate a redundant function of ISG15. it could point towards a role for ISG15 in the immune system. the occurrence of an acidic residue (preferably an Asp in human cells and Glu in mouse cells) greatly enhances its ISGylation capacity. the incidence of the unfavorable Asn residue at position 89 for ISG15 modification in HuISG15 is also found in chimpanzee and dog ISG15. we predicted 7 hot spot residues on ISG15 constituting the interface with UbE1L. three of these residues show a high degree of conservation among the different Ub(L)s (i.e. R92, E132 & R153 in ISG15), 4 other residues are presumed to confine specificity for UbE1L. residues 152-LRL-154, which are part of the C-terminal region of ISG15 juxtapose to N89. this region aligns with 71-LRL-73 in Ub which was described to be of high importance for UbE1 binding affinity and for substrate specificity. the theory of an Activating enzyme harboring unilateral assignment for a specific Ub(L) was overthrown. this is the first report of an OWmISG15 activation by another Activating enzyme than UbE1L. this is also the first report of an UbL -other than Ubiquitin. total protein ISGylation results from the balance between conjugation and de-conjugation, mutation of QIT31-33 to KIA and D133 to N in HuISG15 N89D conceivably could affect recognition or activity by (a) discriminate DUB(s), retaining the targeted protein in the ISGylated state. in line with this hypothesis, a role has been described for the N-terminal Ub fold of ISG15 in the efficiency of DUB recognition/activity OWmISG15 more efficiently ISGylates proteins compared to human ISG15. differences in ISG15 conjugation efficiency may explain human sensitivity to various viruses. FugeneHD (Roche) was used for transfection in COS cells and Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) for transfection in N38 cells. no differences could be seen between this transfection reagent and the calcium phosphate precipitation method. dilution of anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal Ab (Sigma) was 1/5000 dilution of anti-V5-tagged proteins. human ISG15 was also detected with the anti-human ISG15 rabbit polyclonal Ab (Abcam) protease cleavage buffer 1 (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP40, 0.5 mM EDTA) beads were spun down and incubated with anti-FLAG agarose (Sigma) in TEV protease cleavage buffer 2 (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP40) for 2 to 4 hours. the generated peptide fragmentation spectra were searched using the SwissProt database. the following MASCOT parameters were set. the enzyme setting was trypsin with a maximum of 1 missed cleavage allowed. isopropyl -d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.3 mM. cells were resuspended in ice-cold cell Lysis Buffer (20 mMTris pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl) and disrupted mechanically by sonication. in vitro thiolester reactions were performed based on the ISG15 conjugation initiation kit. all samples were prepared in 20 L containing 50 mM HEPES pH 8.0 and 100 mM NaCl. reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 L of 2 SDS loading buffer. lines were cultured in a 8% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. 3,5105 cells were seeded the day before transfection in 6-well plates. a standard calcium phosphate precipitation procedure used 0.75 g of ISG15variant. cells were lysed with 150 L 2 SDS loading buffer (62 mM Tris HCl pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 8% glycerol, 5% -ME, 0.01% brome phenol blue) and homogenized on a Qiashredder mini spin column. blotting efficiency was checked using Ponceau S staining (Sigma) supernatant was incubated with IgG sepharose overnight. beads were washed three times with washing buffer. peptide mixture was precipitated by addition of TCA to a final concentration of 10%. the resulting peptide mix was digested in solution by trypsin. the enzyme setting was trypsin with a maximum of 1 missed cleavage allowed. peptide and fragment ion mass tolerance were 0.3 Da (Q-TOF) or 0.5 Da (ion trap) 2106 Hek293T cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors. clarified lysates were loaded onto a chitin column and disrupted mechanically by sonication. three bed volumes of the cleavage buffer (20 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM DTT, pH 9.0) were loaded onto the column, and incubated overnight. the concentration of the protein was determined by the Bradford assay. 2fTGH cells were stably transfected with the indicated TAP-tagged constructs. one cell-line stably expressing PRMT (Protein Arginine N-Methyltransferase) was used as a control (lane 2). arrow indicates the 15 kDa difference in molecular mass of the ISGylated form of the UbcH protein. a faint band of co-immunoprecipitated UbcH13 and UbcH17 with HuISG15 was observed. open arrows show the position of the UbcH proteins conjugated by an isopeptide bond to the specified ISG15. equal loading was confirmed by Ponceau S staining."}
