{"summary": "a 61-year-old man presented to his local emergency department with a 4-week history of shortness of breath on exertion associated with cough productive of white sputum. he had an extensive medical history that included relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia and secondary hypogammaglobulinemia. he had been treated with monthly azacitidine since June 2009 and was taking a prophylactic dose of co-trimoxazole. the serum aminotransferase level was chronically raised at three times the upper limit of normal. reticulonodular infiltrate was also present in the perihilar regions. fluconazole was given to treat presumed pharyngeal thrush. the patient developed progressive tachypnea (respiratory rate up to 24/min), hypoxia (oxygen saturation of 88% with face mask oxygen delivery at 15 liters/min), and tachycardia. the patient was transferred to intensive care on 29 July 2011 and died the following day. oxiella burnetii In-house PCR N N NT Mycoplasma pneumoniae In-house PCR N N NT Legionella pneumophila In-house PCR N N NT Streptococcus pneumoniae In-house PCR N N NT moraxella catarrhalis In-house PCR N N NT Bordetella pertussis In-house PCR N N NT HBoV1 In-house multiplex qPCR 4.3 HBoV, rhinovirus, and HBoV1 were detected in the samples. nineteen viruses, including 11 respiratory disease-causing pathogens, were investigated. a blood sample was obtained on the day the patient died. the 5,146-nucleotide consensus sequence was established by aligning sequences from four separate clones. we found no viral mutations that would suggest altered cell tropism or viral gene expression. HBoV1 was discovered in 2005 by Allander et al. in respiratory secretions (7). a well-documented case of a fatal HBoV1/adenovirus coinfection in an immunocompetent child with pneumonia and myocarditis has been reported. a correlation between the high HBoV1 copy number and the adverse outcome is unlikely to be connected to the virulence of this particular HBoV1 strain. HBoV1 infection reported in a 14-month child with a known history of a myelosarcoma affecting the bone marrow. HBoV DNA-positive subjects have a high coinfection rate up to 83% in respiratory samples (8)."}
