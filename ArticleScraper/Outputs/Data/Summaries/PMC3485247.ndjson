{"summary": "influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 mortality rate per 100,000 py ranged from 1.5 among persons aged 5\u201344 years to 5.6 among persons aged 65 years. influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 mortality rate per 100,000 py ranged from 1.5 among persons aged 5\u201344 years to 5.6 among persons aged 65 years. a case-series conducted during the first months of the pandemic suggested that influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 mortality rates were at least 0.5\u20131.1/100.000 and concentrated among middle-aged adults with comorbidities. a subsequent review of surveillance data suggested that the apparent influenza-associated disease burden in Argentina was likely an artifact of the way that the initial severe case patients were preferentially sampled. surveillance staff actively searched for a convenience sample of ILI case-patients who sought care among all sentinel city providers. clinicians in these sentinel cities were also mandated to report all ILI case-patients whom they tested for influenza to the national surveillance system. we calculated the number of cases associated with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 each week by adding case-patients which tested positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 to the number of untested cases reported to the obligatory surveillance system. each numerator by the proportion of persons without information about their date of illness onset (i.e. epidemiologic week of illness) and, in the case of ILI case-patients, for the proportion of persons who sought care multiple times per illness compared the probability that decedents with a history of ILI, SARI, and ILI case-patients were more likely to be of a certain age or have a pre-exiting condition using rank-sum tests and Fisher's Exact tests. health authorities strived to maintain case-patient confidentiality by protecting data elements that help third parties identify them. a proportion of cases-patients provided both nasal and throat swabs for influenza testing during the course of their acute illness. they were then tested by indirect immunofluorescence (sensitivity of 95%) [5] and/or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to identify influenza type A and B, universal swine and 2009 H1N1. we calculated the number of ILI associated with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 by adding the number of cases tested positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 to the number of untested ILI cases reported to the obligatory surveillance system multiplied by the proportion of cases tested positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. we adjusted each numerator by the proportion of persons without information about their date of illness onset. the median age of the 74 decedents tested for influenza was 50 years. the median age of the 74 decedents tested for influenza was 50 years. the median age of the 74 decedents tested for influenza was 50 years. population estimates for area under active surveillance 222,681 1,549,706 489,965 250,019 2,512,370. estimates of 2009 H1N1mortality per 100,000 personsb 1.8 (95%CI 1.8\u20131.8) 1.5 (95%CI 1.7\u20131.5) 4.1 (95%CI 4.4\u20133.8) 5.6 (95%CI 5.6 \u20135.6) 2.7 (95%CI 3.0\u20132.4) 600 persons of all ages developed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09-associated SARI rate per 100,000 personsb 26.9 (95%CI 35.4\u201318.4) among persons aged 5 years to 41.8/100,000 (95%CI 66.5\u201318.3) among persons aged 65 years. estimated by multiplying the week-specific number of decedents identified (row 1) by the week-specific proportion testing positive for 2009 H1N1 (row 2) and its 95% confidence interval. b Corrected for the proportion of case-patients missing date of illness onset information.
