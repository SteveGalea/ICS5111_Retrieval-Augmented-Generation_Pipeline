{"summary": "single-organism molecular diagnostic methods are burdensome unless used for large numbers of samples being tested for a single disease. oneHealth approaches for management of food-borne disease and emerging pathogen surveillance are examples of testing needs that include bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. the challenge to combining tests for multiple analytes together is a possible loss of sensitivity and a large burden for optimization and validation of assays. the system draws the master mix and sample across the surface of up to 4 plates (192 samples and controls) at a time. a wide variety of samples were extracted, reverse-transcribed, and pre-amplified in a 96-well format. control was generated by purification of sequence-confirmed amplicons and in vitro transcription for RNA targets. clinical samples were submitted for routine diagnostic testing to the Cornell Animal Health Diagnostic Center. cotton, plastic, wood-handled, and synthetic swabs are all acceptable, but avoid calcium alginate swabs. swabs and tracheal washes are all acceptable, but avoid calcium alginate swabs. 235 l of lysis buffer and 175 l of sample (or PBS for negative control) to each bead tube. follow preamp, keep all reagents on ice at all times. assemble eluted DNA and/or RNA, PCR Reaction Mix, nuclease-free water as a negative control. centrifuge the sealed plate for 20 sec using a PCR plate spinner. check to ensure all reagents are combined in the bottom of the plate wells. turn on the conventional thermocycler, select the preamp cycling program. remove all unnecessary items from a PCR setup area. put on double gloves and sleeve covers. remove the seal from the preamp plate. \"Setup and Load\" is the csv file created from the Sample Tracker software. click \"Setup and Load\" and then \"Browse\" and select the file. if the file is not shown, go to \"Instrument/Edit Preferences\" -well plate inside the liquid handler once everything is in place. close the door to the liquid handler and immediately start the filling process. remove the protective film from the bottom of a case lid. select the amplification machine then click on the \"Open Door\" button. Orient the plate with the barcode facing up and toward the front of the instrument. the empty boxes will be automaticallypopulated with information about the plate. n, click \"Export QC Images\" by checking that there are no dark spots or smudges. check for leaks or agitation to the plate after loading. check that the image looks uniform with no shadows, bubbles, or displaced samples. repeat this for Macro2 by clicking \"Alt-F8\" then clicking \"Macro\" and clicking \"Run\" then repeat this for Macro2 by clicking \"Alt-F8\" then selecting \"Macro2\" and clicking \"Run\" the 18x3 gene expression format was used for this study. provide sequences for all primers and probes (or inventoried assay IDs) for each target. centrifuge the suspension for 10 min at 18,000 x g, then transfer 400 l to a new tube. incubate 15 min at 37 \u00b0C. prepare lysis and wash buffers according to manufacturer's instructions. RT-qPCR mix to half of final volume (7 l here) perform the preamp in a standard 96-well plate using the left side of the plate only. add 8.5 l of preamp master mix and 5.5 l of DNA/RNA sample. unopened plates can remain at room temperature for up to 24 hr. turn on amplification machine and computer and start associated program. remove all unnecessary items from a PCR setup area. check that the waste bin of the plate loading liquid handler is empty. write the expiration date of the tips on the tip box cover. turn on the liquid handler and computer and open the liquid handler software. the purpose of the case is to protect the plate from being touched. remove the foil seal from the 384-well plate inside the liquid handler. remove the protective film from the bottom of a case lid. the plate is immersed vertically by the edges. seal the loading port by inserting the plug into the port and twisting the plug clockwise. if a plate is dropped, discard it. remove the amplification plate, checking that no immersion fluid has leaked out. press the green Analyze button at the top right of the screen. click \"Export\" on the left side of the screen and then \"Start Export\" to export results. if the results Macro option does not appear in the \"to book\" field, simply copy the contents of the exported data file worksheet. Delete the old \"Export\" tab and then rename the newly added tab as \"Export\" repeat this for Macro2 by clicking \"Alt-F8\" then selecting \"Macro2\" and clicking \"Run\" the highest dilution where 95% of the replicates were positive for the representative assays was 50 copies. detection of 5 copies was successful in 50% of replicates. the average efficiencies of the representative RNA and DNA assays were 101.1% and 106.6%. amplification plots are plotted against amplification cycles for the RNA assay (A) and DNA assay (B) Triangles are shown denoting Ct values. standard curves are plotted against log(10) of the number of copies of RNA (A) or DNA (B) standard. a color-coded plate transfer map for using a fixed 8-channel pipette to transfer from the 96-well preamp plate to the 384-well plate is shown. the same procedure is performed each time regardless of how many samples are in the plate. a typical result table generated by the macros is included in the file. the macro spreadsheet would need to be modified or re-created for plates with different configurations. due to the very small amount of sample loaded onto the amplification plate (33 nl), pre-amplification is required. in the optimization of this protocol, we compared a number of preamplification parameters including the master mix, addition of random primers, number of cycles, annealing time, and dilution before amplification. matrix assay described by Shu et al.7 and adapted here for nanoliter scale reactions is a universal influenza A assay that is appropriate for testing samples from humans and companion animals. it was designed for universal detection of the matrix gene of all influenza A viruses using microliter scale reactions. it has been used around the world as part of a CDC human Influenza Virus Panel and a CDC Swine Flu Panel. collection of swab samples early, generally within 3 days of clinical onset provides best chance to identify the presence of respiratory pathogens. future applications of this technology are likely to be in pathotyping, antimicrobial resistance profiling, and further syndrome-based clinical diagnostic panels. nanoscale real-time PCR is most useful for rapid, high-throughput screening of multiple sample and pathogen types."}
