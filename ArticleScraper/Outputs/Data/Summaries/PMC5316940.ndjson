{"summary": "firefly luciferase (fluc) gene was cloned into pcDNA3.1 to generate pcDNA3.1.fluc. three additional fluc expressing plasmids were then constructed by replacing the CMV promoter (cCMV) of the pcDNA3.1.fluc with complete CMV promoter (sCMV), CAG or LTR to generate psCMV.fluc, pCAG.fluc or pLTR fluc genes were replaced with CVS glycoprotein gene in the aforementioned fluc expressing plasmids with different promoters to generate pcDNA3.1.CVS (3.1), psCMV.CVS (C), pCAG.CVS (A) and pLTR.CVS (L respectively. to generate various forms of pseudotyped viruses, pNL4-3.luc (N), pSG3Env.fluc (F) or pSG 7 types of cells were tested, including HEK293, 293T, 293FT, MDCK, BHK21, BSR and Vero. the same lot of rabies pseudoviruses were titrated six times in each cell line. the highest pseudovirus titers were obtained in 293T cells. the titers of the rabies pseudovirus detected at different cell numbers were compared using one-way ANOVA. no significant difference was observed between 40,000/well and 30,000/well. the difference between 40,000/well and 50,000/well was also found to be insignificant. titer of sample A also met acceptable criteria with lower viral inoculum (200 TCID50/well) there is a trend of increasing variability if the viral inocula were less than 400 TCID50/well. we chose the viral inocula at 1600 TCID50/well as the optimal dose. the viability of the cells decreased when DEAE-dextran concentration reached 15 g/ml or higher. the addition of DEAE-dextran could reduce the virus volume to yield similar levels of SNR. a panel of fifty human and thirty mouse serum samples were used to evaluate the PBNA in parallel with RFFIT. the coefficient of variation (CV) ranged from 6.7% to 11.7% for the intra assay and 6.6% to 9.9% for the inter assay. panel 3C: correlation between PBNA and RFFT forcomparison of the PBNA and RFFIT for all the 320 samples. value ranges were assigned for sample A (8.9\u201310.9 IU/ml) and B (2.9\u20133.3 IU/ml) 297 (92.81%) were identified as positive by RFFIT and 300 (93.75%) by PBNA assays. average recovery of PBNA was 106% with RSD 26.0%. differences in antibody concentration between each sample were plotted against the mean values obtained by the two assays. the limits of agreement were \u20130.271 and 0.228 log10 IU/ml (mean 2 SD) KM mice with body weight ranging from 8 to 26 grams were inoculated with 1 106 TCID50 per mouse. the lighter the body weight of the KM mice, the higher signals could be detected in them. KM mice with body weight ranging from 8 to 26 grams were inoculated with same amount of rabies pseudotyped virus. the bioluminescent signals were visualized in the spleen and liver one day post-inoculation. by day 2, the density of the signals increased and reached the highest level in these organs. the signal density began to decline in these two tissues by day 3. spread of the pseudovirus to the brain was detected. rabies-specific immunoglobulin was injected into KM mice intramuscularly three days before challenge with either wt virus or pseudovirus. a clear dose-response was observed for the pseudovirus in vivo assays. two animals were not completely protected, with neutralization titers found to be between 0.55 and 0.65 IU/ml. pSG3Env was introduced into the rabies pseudotyped virus in vivo. pSG3Env was previously used as the backbone plasmid in a validated HIV neutralization assay. however, the pSG3Env could not be directly used to make rabies G-pseudotyped virus as it lacks the reporter gene in the backbone plasmid. therefore, we cloned fluc gene into this pSG3Env at the end of the silenced env gene to generate pSG3En ratios of pCAG.CVS to pSG3Env.sCMV.fluc ranging from 1:6 to 6:1 were investigated. we found the 3:1 ratio is ideal to yield the highest titer of pseudotyped virus, with TCID50 reaching as high as 1 107 TCID50/ml. 40,000/well was found to yield the highest titer when equal concentration of virus preparations were used. 40,000/well was found to yield the highest titer when equal concentration of virus preparations were used. the absolute IC50 values decreased gradually with the increasing amounts of the viral inocula. lower viral inocula resulted in larger variability and less curve fitting (smaller R2 values) the decreased RLU values were found to be due to cellular toxicity induced by DEAE-dextran. the viability of the cells decreased when DEAE-dextran concentration reached 15 g/ml or higher. panel of fifty negative human and thirty mouse serum samples was used to determine the limit of detection (LOD) the reproducibility of the PBNA was determined by testing the two internal control samples in three independent runs. the coefficient of variation (CV) ranged from 6.7% to 11.7% for the intra assay and 6.6% to 9.9% for the inter assay. the total CVs were 6.4% and 10.1% for sample A and B in PBNA respectively. all results tested by PBNA were within the assigned values pre-determined by RFFIT. 320 serum samples from vaccinated subjects were assayed. PBNA = 0.998 RTTIT0.019, with 95% CI for the estimated slope found between 0.971 and 1.025 (p 0.001) and the estimated intercept between-0.060 and 0.022 (p 0.001). the average recovery of PBNA was 106% with RSD 26.0%. KM mice with body weight ranging from 8 to 26 grams were inoculated with 1 106 TCID50 per mouse. KM mice with body weight ranging from 8 to 26 grams were inoculated with 1 106 TCID50 per mouse. intravenous inoculation of KM mice weighing 8\u201310 grams should be chosen to conduct rabies vaccine evaluation using the pseudovirus Experiments. to this end, two KM mice were injected with 1 106 TCID50 pseudovirus. by day 2, the signal density increased and reached the highest level in these organs. panel 5A: selection of the pseudovirus dose used in the in vivo assay. rabies-specific immunoglobulin was injected into KM mice intramuscularly three days before challenge with either wt virus or pseudovirus. the traditional mouse assay using live wt virus was 2.31 IU (95% CI: 1.43-3.75 IU) serum samples from the pseudovirus in vivo assay showed complete protection with neutralizing antibody concentration at 0.65 IU/ml or higher. two animals were not completely protected, with neutralization titers found to be between 0.55 and 0.65 IU/ml or greater. the biodistribution pattern of the rabies pseudovirus administered intravenously is expectedly different from that of the wt virus model in which the virus is given intramuscularly32. in the latter case, the rabies virus reaches the CNS by retrograde transport route, followed by spreading centrifugally along the autonomic and sensory nerves. escent signal was initially found to be localized in the brain. followed by re-distribution into the spleen and liver. this is a biodistribution pattern similar to that of the live wt virus. however, the difference in viral biodistribution is partly due to route of administration. 50 rabies-negative human serum samples were kindly provided by Shanghai RAAS Blood Products Co.
