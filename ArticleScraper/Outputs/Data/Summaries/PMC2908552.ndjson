{"summary": "the comparison of normal versus disease states can identify an overexpression or suppression of critical proteins where illness has directly altered a patient's cellular homeostasis. the analysis of HIV-1 infected serum is an attractive medium with which to identify altered protein expression due to the ease and non-invasive methods of collecting samples. serum is derived from the liquid plasma component of the blood. it is composed of small molecules such as salts, lipids, amino acids, sugars and approximately 60-80 mg of proteins/mL. serum is a complex mixture of \"classical\" and \"non-classical\" proteins. serum proteomics has emerged as an integral biomarker identification tool for infectious diseases and oncology. serum biomarkers have been identified for liver fibrosis in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients. LTNPs are often characterized as being infected with HIV-1. they are disease free and sustain a normal CD4 T-cell count and a low viral load. LTNPs have a higher prevalence of the CCR532 allele [17,23-25]. p16INK4A is found preferentially in LTNP patient serum samples. in vitro viral assays and viability studies confirm the loss of viral replication upon p16INK4A treatment in latently infected cell lines. results Depletion of the 12 highly abundant serum proteins allows for the identification of low abundant proteins. whole serum (lanes 2, 3) contains many proteins and is too complex to allow for confident identification of specific proteins. however, when the high abundant proteins are removed, lower abundant proteins that were originally masked are able to be analyzed. we applied this depletion strategy to pooled patient samples to assist in the identification of HIV-1 infection specific protein identification. the identification of this protein is not necessarily a marker for a LTNP phenotype. it is possible that an HP1 binding protein would be present in the serum of an HIV-1 infected patient as HP1 including its subtypes.

P16INK4A inhibits the phosphorylation of Rb by competitively inhibiting the association of cdk4/Cyclin D therefore inhibiting the release of Rb-bound proteins. this small molecular weight protein is an attractive candidate for a secreted, differentially expressed protein in response to HIV-1 infection. 14% B3 HAART Low Kelch repeat domain containing protein 11 gi 7662260 5.8 65.7 12% B15 HAART Low SNW1 protein/APAF1 interacting protein gi 40850966 9.9 35.97 21% C2 Uninfected Low Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B gi 49256408 5.5 69.15 10% C4 Uninfected Low RRBP1 protein gi 38014595 4.9 PCTAIRE protein kinase 3 is a member of the serine/threonine family of protein kinases. the cdc2/cdkx subfamily plays a role in broad signal transduction pathways. this protein identification again demonstrates the role that HIV-1 infection plays in dysregulation of cellular kinases. p16INK4A is present in both the low and high abundant fractions of the pooled LTNPs (lanes 3, 4) and is also observed in the high abundance fraction of uninfected patients. this protein is not present in HAART patient samples at all. the presence of this protein may be specific to individuals that confer resistance to chronic HIV-1 infection. HP1 was shown to be present in the low abundance fractions of all patients phenotypes. HP1 was shown to be present in both the low and high abundant fractions across all patients types. all serum samples indicate the presence of a post-translational modification (i.e. a doublet band) Western blot confirmation of MALDI-TOF identified serum proteins. antibodies specific to cdk4, p16INK4A, PCTAIRE, HP1 and HP1 were used. p16INK4A and cdk4 were used as controls. p16INK4A was detectable in LTNP patients 1 and 2, as well as in the pooled sample \"D\" for the corresponding high abundance fractions (lanes 2, 3, 4). cdk4 was not detectable in the LTNP high abundant individual samples with variable abundance, correlating with the data in Figure 3A. p16INK4A is differentially present in the serum of HIV-1 infected LTNPs. RT activity of infected cells decreases in vitro in the presence of exogenous p16INK4A. cell culture supernatants were collected at 48 hours post treatment. cell culture supernatants were collected at 48 hours post treatment. cells were measured for viability with MTT reagent. treatment of uninfected cells with p16INK4A does not affect cellular viability. we performed an MTT assay to screen for the percentage of cells viable after p16INK4A treatment. 0.5 ug of GST-p16INK4A showed an almost 40% decrease in cellular viability. INK4A is a critical member of the Rb tumor-suppressor pathway. it acts to arrest the cell-cycle at G1/S by inhibiting binding of cdk4/6 to Cyclin D1 and subsequently inhibiting the phosphorylation of Rb. a recent paper has addressed the literature-wide discrepancies of RB dephosphorylation vs. degradation in response to drug treatment. purified GST-p16 is found intracellularly in Jurkat, J1.1, U937, and U1 cell lines. the cells were harvested, washed extensively, lysed, and incubated with Glutathione-Sepharose beads overnight. the bound proteins were subject to Western blot for presence of p16INK4a. cdk4/Cyclin D inhibits the interaction between cdk4/Cyclin D at an IC50 of approximately 0.35 M, and to a lesser extent cdk6/Cyclin D by binding the ATP pocket of cdk4, resulting in cell cycle arrest at G1/S [52,53]. RT activity of both J1.1 and U1 cells decreased over time with increasing concentration of the drug. p16INK4A in the serum may be able to enter and exit lymphocytes. this suggests that p16INK4A may be able to enter and exit lymphocytes and exhibit its inhibitory effects during an HIV-1 infection. p16INK4A and Fascaplysin treatment results in a loss of cellular viability in Jurkat cells as well as a decrease in viral production in infected J1.1 and U1 cells. cells were treated with three concentrations of FASC (100 nM, 500 nM, 1 M) and were collected after 48 hours. depletion of the 12 highly abundant serum proteins allows for the identification of low abundance proteins. the difficulty associated with analyzing serum is the presence of a high abundance of proteins which mask potential low abundance biomarkers. serum contains many proteins and is too complex to allow for confident identification of specific proteins. but when the high abundant proteins are removed, lower abundant proteins that were originally masked are able to be analyzed. the proteomeLab IgY serum depletion kit is the most appropriate and reproducible way in which to fractionate our serum samples into high and low abundance fractions. heterochromatin protein 1, or HP1 is a member of the chromatin remodeling family of proteins, which can bind histones at methylated lysine residues. it is possible that an HP1 binding protein would be present in the serum of an HIV-1 infected patient as HP1 including its subtypes. depletion of patient serum was performed as indicated by manufacturer's instructions. Whole serum (lanes 2, 3) was incubated with the column containing antibodies against 12 of the high abundant serum proteins. low abundance fractions were collected for each sample and run on a 1D gel. pI MW (kDa) 2 LTNP Low Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer binding protein 1 gi 55662194 8.3 296.68 3 LTNP Low Ribonuclease III (Drosha) gi 20139357 8.5 159.23 4 LTNP Low ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 18 gi 38649249 9.7 135.12 5 LT IPG strips with a pH 3.0-10.0 range followed by SDS-PAGE using 4-20% Tris-Glycine Criterion gels. 2DGE is a more sensitive front-end purification approach to the isolation and identification of individual protein species by mass spectrometry. protein kinase 3 or protein kinase C (PKC) is a member of the family of serine/threonine kinases that are integrally involved in key cellular signaling pathways. kinase 3 is a member of the family of serine/threonine kinases that are integrally involved in key cellular signaling pathways. P16INK4A inhibits the phosphorylation of Rb by competitively inhibiting the association of cdk4/Cyclin D therefore inhibiting the release of Rb-bound proteins. this small molecular weight protein is an attractive candidate for a secreted, differentially expressed protein in response to HIV-1 infection.

HP1 interacts with the histone methyltransferase Suv39H1 to initiate a chromatin-mediated repressive state of the HIV-1 integrated virus. HP1 is observed in lower amounts in both the Negative and HAART high abundance fractions. all serum samples indicate the presence of a post-translational modification (i.e. a doublet band) Western blot confirmation of MALDI-TOF identified serum proteins. antibodies specific to cdk4, p16INK4A, PCTAIRE, HP1 and HP1 were used. p16INK4A and cdk4 were used as controls. p16INK4A is detectable in LTNP patients 1 and 2, as well as in the pooled sample \"D\" for the corresponding high abundance fractions (lanes 2, 3, 4). cdk4 was not detectable in the LTNP high abundant individual samples with variable abundance, correlating with the data in Figure 3A. the patients 2, 3, 4 and 6 have a detectable level of p16INK4A. p16INK4A is differentially present in the serum of LTNPs. this may not directly correlate to viral pathogenesis or functionality of this protein. J1.1 and U1 latently infected HIV-1 cell lines were treated with GST or GST-p16INK4A (0.1 g or 0.5 g) cell culture supernatants were collected at 48 hours post treatment and assayed for reverse transcriptase activity measured in cpm. treatment of uninfected cells with p16INK4A does not affect cellular viability. treatment of uninfected cells with p16INK4A does not affect cellular viability. we performed an MTT assay to screen for the percentage of cells viable. a recent paper has addressed the literature-wide discrepancies of RB dephosphorylation vs. degradation in response to drug treatment. it is possible that the increased amount of p16INK4A present in these cells has induced a proteasomal degradation of Rb that has not otherwise been characterized in T cells. purified GST-p16 is found intracellularly in Jurkat, J1.1, U937, and U1 cell lines. the cells were harvested, washed extensively, lysed, and incubated with Glutathione-Sepharose beads overnight. the bound proteins were subject to Western blot for presence of p16INK4a. cdk4/Cyclin D is a naturally derived molecule isolated from a marine sponge which specifically inhibits the interaction between cdk4/Cyclin D at an IC50 of approximately 0.35 M. cdk6/Cyclin D is binding the ATP pocket of cdk4, resulting in cell cycle arrest at G1/S. p16INK4A in the serum may be able to enter and exit lymphocytes. this suggests that p16INK4A may be able to enter and exit lymphocytes and exhibit its inhibitory effects during an HIV-1 infection. p16INK4A and Fascaplysin treatment results in a loss of cellular viability in Jurkat cells as well as a decrease in viral production in infected J1.1 and U1 cells. cells were treated with three concentrations of FASC (100 nM, 500 nM, 1 M) and were collected after 48 hours. new tab Fascaplysin induces apoptosis in jurkat cells. bars represent the percentage of gated cells present in each of the cell cycle stages. p16INK4A, a cdk4/6 inhibitor, is preferentially present in pooled serum. tumor-suppressive pathway is mutated in close to 100% of human cancers. specific loss-of-function mutations are found within the Rb gene or the CDKN2A gene encoding p16INK4A. the loss of p16INK4A results in the constitutive activation of cdk/Cyclins. the presence of the cdk inhibitor p16INK4A in LTNP serum is suggestive of an existing defense mechanism in these patients that imparts a predisposition to a lack of HIV-1 disease progression. the development of pharmacological cdki's and peptide mimetics is a commonly used approach for both cancer and viral therapeutics. the same dosage of p16 INK4A needed for a decrease in viral replication in infected cells is not toxic to uninfected cells. this indicates that there may be a threshold for which the effect of this cdk inhibitor begins to harm the cell and potentially induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. we also chose to reinforce the p16INK4A-induced cdki effects seen on cellular viability. differences in expression of p16INK4A can be due to either a host cellular response to the infection or from an influence of the infection itself. many complicating factors can contribute to altered state of proteins present in the serum, not the least of which is length of time in which the patient has been infected. LTNPs were defined by WIHS as being HIV Infected, but disease free for at least five years. a CD4 count of greater than 500 at all visits, and no history of anti-retroviral therapy. LTNPs were defined by WIHS as being HIV Infected, but disease free for at least five years. el Electrophoresis (2DGE) and MALDI-TOF MS Five hundred micrograms of pooled LTNP, HAART, and Negative samples were subjected to isoelectric focusing on an IPG strip. gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and protein spots of interest were excised. gel pieces were vortexed, washed, and washed 3X with 50% ACN/25 mM NH4HCO3 to remove positive control calibration peptide solution of Bradykinin, Angiotensin II, P14R, and ACTH was spotted along with negative control empty gel slice. mass peaks obtained were entered into Mascot databases for peptide mass fingerprinting analysis. supernatants were transferred to eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. antibodies against cdk4 (sc-749), p16 (sc-467), PCTAIRE (sc-174), Rb (sc-50), and Actin (sc-1615) were purchased from cell signaling (Danvers, MA) 5 l of the reaction mix was spotted on a deAE Filtermat paper. cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 70% ethanol. cells were stained in PBS containing 25 ug/ml propidium iodide. 293Ts were grown in modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% streptomycin/penicillin. latently infected HIV-1 cell lines J1.1 (T-cells) and U1 (monocytes) were used for RT assays. uninfected cells were grown in RPMI-1640 media. high capacity spin column consists of anti-human serum albumin, anti-IgG, anti-fibrinogen, anti-transferrin, anti-IgA, anti-HDL, anti-haptoglobin, anti-1-antitrypsin, anti-1-acid glycoprotein and anti-2-macroglobulin conjugated to polymeric microbeads. up to 200 ng of trypsin was removed, 20 l of 25 mM NH4HCO3 or enough to cover the gel was added to the gel pieces. peptides were pooled together and a SpeedVac was used to reduce volume to approximately 10 l. beads were washed with indicated salt washes (TNE600 + 0.1% NP-40, TNE300 + 0.1% NP-40, or TNE150 + 0.1% NP-40, or TNE50 + 0.1% NP-40), bound proteins were removed from the beads with Laemmli buffer. whole cell extracts were obtained from cell culture pellets washed twice with 25 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged RT assays J1.1 and U1 cells (2 106) were treated with GST or GST-p16 (0.1 or 0.5 g) or Fascaplysin (100 nM, 500 nM, or 1 M) supernatants collected to test for the presence of virus 48 hours post treatment. cell cycle analysis Cells were stained with PBS containing 25 ug/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), 10 ug/ml RNase A (Sigma) and 0.1% NP-40. authors declare that they have no competing interests. most of the data on the current manuscript was generated using funds from NIH grants AI078859, AI074410 and AI043894. the manuscript was collected by the women's interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Collaborative Study Group with centers (Principal Investigators) at New York City/Bronx Consortium."}
