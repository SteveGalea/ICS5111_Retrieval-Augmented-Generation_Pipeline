{"summary": "all known members of nidovirus family that includes coronaviruses encode an endoribonuclease. a recombinant endoribonuclease of the SARS-CoV (Nsp15) cleaves RNAs immediately 3\u2032 of uridylates. cleavage occurs through the formation of a 2\u2032-3\u2032 cyclic phosphodiester product in a mechanism identical to that of RNase A (4) in viral infection, we identified a sequence diagnostic for proteins that can bind the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) this motif was originally identified in oncoproteins encoded by DNA tumor viruses that can sequester pRb and prevent the repression of genes needed for DNA replication. some RNA viruses are also known to interact with pRb. murine fibroblast cells (L2) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum and maintained at 37\u00b0C under 3% CO2. NIH 3T3 cells were grown at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2 in DMEM with 4 mM l-glutamine, 1.5 g sodium bicarbonate/liter, and 4.5 g of glucose. the protein was purified from cell lysate generated by sonication in 1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10 mM -mercaptoethanol. the lysate was passed through a glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) affinity column. protein was eluted with restriction-grade thrombin (Novagen) plasmids were transfected with plasmids to coexpress pRbABC. the cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 10% glycerol) extracts were prepared as described earlier (28) expression vector or sNsp15 (sNsp15HA, LCHA, or H249AHA)-transfected Huh7 cells were seeded on eight-well glass chamber slides. cells were washed with PBS twice and then with 1 annexin V binding buffer once. cells were stained with 7-AAD for 5 min at room temperature. the slides were washed with FITC to detect pRb for 1 h at room temperature (at 1:200 dilution) the slides were washed with PBS-T three times and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) g of propidium iodide (Invitrogen, Inc.)/ml prepared in PBS containing 0.1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2 mg of DNase-free RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37\u00b0C for 15 min in the dark. a total of 15,000 cells were analyzed using ModFitLT V3.0. the LC mutation was introduced into mNsp15 using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) the sequence of BamHI-HpaI fragment carrying the mutations was determined to confirm that the desired sequences were obtained. the region of the recovered clones between the BamHI and HpaI sites was sequenced again to verify that the desired mutations were recovered. the cells were washed to remove the unattached virus that was remaining in the medium. cultures were fed and further incubated until 0, 10, 12, 16, 24, 28, and 30 h postinfection (hpi), at which time they were frozen at 70\u00b0C. pRb overexpression and analysis of the MHV nucleocapsid (N) protein was quantified by plaque assays. d for pRb using anti-pRb monoclonal antibody 4H1. cells derived from mouse brain tumor maintained at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. MHV A59 and mutant derivatives were propagated in the DBT cell line. purified proteins were stored in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.9)\u2013300 mM NaCl\u20131 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)\u201350% (vol/vol) glycerol at 20\u00b0C. the pRbAB was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. 293T cells were grown to 80% confluence using lipofectamine 2000 reagent. they were transfected with plasmids to coexpress pRbABC. the cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 10% glycerol), and extracts were prepared as described earlier. Western blots were probed using anti-HA antibody or anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody P4D1. cells were washed with PBS twice and then with 1 annexin V binding buffer once. cell viability and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. anti-HA and anti-pRb (4H1) antibodies were used to detect Nsp15 and pRb, respectively, at a 1:200 dilution using antibody dilution buffer (1% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) slides were washed with PBS-T three times and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium. the cells were harvested 36 h posttransfection, washed with PBS, and resuspended at 2 106 cells per ml of cold PBS. the cell suspension was added dropwise to an equal volume of cold absolute ethanol with continuous vortexing to fix the cells. cellular DNA was stained with 500 g of propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) MHV-A59 1000 reverse-genetics system (43) was used to recover viruses with mutations in mNsp15. a 3.4-kb BamHI-HpaI fragment spanning the region of interest in mNsp15 from the F plasmid (43) was amplified and cloned into the pGEM-T vector as described previously (20) growth curves for MHV were determined in L2 cells seeded in 96-well plates. cells were grown in 0.1% serum supplemented growth medium for 48 h. cells were washed to remove the unattached virus that was remaining in the medium. protein was detected with anti-MHV N protein monoclonal antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. the blots were stripped with Tris (pH 7.0) containing 2% SDS and 50 mM DTT for 2 h at 37\u00b0C and probed for pRb using anti-pRb monoclonal antibody 4H1. an LXCXD motif is present in other 1ab proteins. the motif is found in the 1a proteins of TGEV 1a and IBV. functional relevance of these motifs in other coronaviruses will not be addressed. the residue number of the first residue of the motif in the proteolytically processed Nsp15 or Nsp15 ortholog is shown. two examples of the motifs within the ORF1a of TGEV (NC_002306) and IBV (NC_001451) are shown. we also expressed and purified the WT and a mutant sLC named sLC that has alanine substitutions of L331 and C333 of the LXCXD motif. sNsp15 endoribonuclease activity does not require pRb, but there may be interactions between the proteins. pRbAB (pRb-spanning AB domains), sLC (pRb-binding mutant of SARS-CoV Nsp15) and sNsp15 (sARS CoV Nsp15) were used in the study. snsp15HA (HA-tagged sNsp15) Western blot analysis of various fractions collected upon passing sNsp15HA- or LCHA-expressing cellular lysates through a GST-pRbAB-bound glutathione-agarose column. anti-HA antibodies were used for the detection of Nsp15 (molecular mass, 40 kDa) thione-Sepharose resin incubated with cell lysates expressing either sNsp15HA or LCHA. these results show that Nsp15 binds to pRb in cells and that the LXCXD/E motif contributes to the binding. this encouraged us to determine the consequences of pRb-Nsp15 interaction. Western blot analysis of lysates from vector-, sNsp15HA-, or LCHA-transfected 293T cells. blots were probed with anti-HA antibodies. the expected position of Nsp15 migration on the gel (40 kDa) is shown. Huh7 cells were transfected with sNsp15HA, LCHA, or the endoribonuclease mutant, H249AHA. at 36 h posttransfection, the cells were stained with annexin V-FITC and 7-AAD to determine apoptosis and cell death. each microscopic image contains both cells expressing sNsp15 and those that do not. a typical cell that did not express WT or mutant sNsp15 is identified by the symbol \u201c\u201d in all three sets of images. expression of sNsp15 is correlated with a redistribution of pRb in cells. snsp15 affects pRb function. cells expressing sLC did not increase colony formation. the images show the growth of sNsp15- or vector-transfected NIH 3T3 cells. sNsp15 interacted with pRb perturbed the regulation of the cell cycle. the H249A mutant of sNsp15 increased Renilla luciferase levels in a concentration-dependent manner. the same effects were not observed with luciferase expressed from a human cytomegalovirus promoter that is not regulated by pRb. blot showed the amount of ubiquitinated pRb in either vector (V)- or sNsp15HA-transfected cells. anti-pRb monoclonal antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation. pRb abundance has been shown to be regulated by several pathways. MHV is a suitable substitute for SARS-CoV since its Nsp15 protein (mNsp15) has a structure nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV Nsp15. the endoribonuclease activity of the recombinant mNsp15 was also increased in the presence of pRb. pRb is redistributed and downregulated during MHV infection. we wanted to examine whether MHV infection would affect the accumulation and cellular distribution of pRb. pRb was localized primarily in the nucleus of uninfected cells. pRb is stained with anti-MHV N protein monoclonal antibodies and anti-rabbit secondary antibody. western blots show levels of pRb in whole cells lysates. level of GAPDH used as loading control. pRb levels in cells infected with vLC remained apparently unaltered even by 5 hpi. the decrease in pRb levels by WT MHV infection by Western blot analysis was greater than that observed in the microscopy images. pRb appears to be much brighter in the MHV infection. the pRbABC levels were decreased by both WT and vLC MHV after 8 hpi. the Western blot shows the level of viral nucleocapsid (N) and pRbABC protein expressed in DBT cells transfected either with vector (+V) or pRbABC (+pRbABC) the MHV N protein was detected with anti-MHV N protein monoclonal antibodies and horseradish peroxidas the orthologs of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV; an alpha coronavirus), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, a gamma coronavirus), and turkey coronavirus (TCoV, a gamma coronavirus) all lacked this motif. an LXCXD motif is present in other 1ab proteins. nidoviruses lack the Rb-binding motif within the Nsp15 ortholog. the residue number of the first residue of the motif in the proteolytically processed Nsp15 or Nsp15 ortholog is shown. size-exclusion chromatography revealed that both WT sNsp15 and the sLC mutant eluted predominantly as hexamers, a feature necessary for Nsp15 endoribonuclease activity. sLC mutant preferentially cleaved a tetranucleotide fluorophore substrate containing a cognate uridylate, and its activity was dependent on Mn2+ similar to the WT coimmunoprecipitation of sNsp15HA (HA-tagged sNsp15) with coexpressed pRbABC (pRb-spanning ABC domains) from cellular lysates. anti-HA antibodies were used for the detection of Nsp15 (molecular mass, 40 kDa) WT sNsp15HA was found to coimmunoprecipitate with pRb but not the LCHA mutant. pRb-GST was bound to glutathione-Sepharose resin and incubated with cell lysates expressing either sNsp15HA or LCHA. both sNsp15HA and LCHA were positive for ubiquitin. but sNsp15HA migrated in one band indicative of a monoubiquitinated form. western blot analysis of lysates from vector-, sNsp15HA- or LCHA-transfected 293T cells. the four quadrants are based on the intensity of the signal from annexin V and PI. the live cells are negative for both annexin V PI (live), the dead cells are negative for annexin A but negative for PI. the cells that are both apoptotic and dead are positive for both signals. pRb was localized predominantly in the nuclei of cells that were not expressing sNsp15HA. but in cells expressing sNsp15HA, pRb was detected both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. each microscopic image contains both cells expressing sNsp15 and those that do not. pRb redistribution requires interaction with Nsp15 via the LXCXE/D motif. we analyzed pRb localization in LCHA-transfected cells. the gain was adjusted higher than that for WT sNsp15HA or H249AHA. cells expressing sNsp15 had severalfold higher cell number compared to cells transfected with the empty vector. cells expressing sLC did not increase colony formation but due to the pleiotropic effects associated with sLC. sNsp15 increased Renilla luciferase levels in a concentration-dependent manner. the same effects were not observed with luciferase expressed from a human cytomegalovirus promoter that is not regulated by pRb. reduction in pRb levels by Nsp15 could be a combined effect of its endoribonuclease activity and enhanced protein degradation. anti-pRb monoclonal antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation (IP), and anti-ubiquitin antibodies were used for Western blotting. a smear with extra density was found to emanate from a band of the mass corresponding to unmodified pRb. a smear with extra density was found to emanate from a band of the mass corresponding to unmodified pRb, a finding consistent with the increased ubiquitination of pRb in the presence of sNsp15. the loss of interaction between pRb and mNsp15 is detrimental to optimal MHV infection. pRb is redistributed and downregulated during MHV infection. pRb is localized primarily in the nucleus of uninfected cells. pRb (red) and MHV N protein (green) in untreated cells. pRb stained with rabbit anti-mouse antibody. pRb stained with anti-MHV N protein monoclonal antibodies. vLC-infected cells compared to uninfected or vLC-infected cells 1 hpi. redistribution of pRb was observed as early as 1 h after MHV infection. the decrease in pRb levels by WT MHV infection by Western blot analysis was greater than that observed. cells with overexpressed pRbABC exhibited a delayed appearance of N protein by up to 2 h compared to the cells transfected with the empty vector. pRb overexpression apparently did not affect N protein appearance in cells infected with vLC. affected interaction with pRb was reduced by up to 1 log. overexpression of pRb in cells delayed timing for N protein expression. coronaviruses can affect cell cycle-associated gene expression. pRb can coimmunoprecipitate with Nsp15 and increase the endoribonuclease activity. pRb interacts with several cellular proteins and regulates expression of multiple genes, including those associated with the cell cycle (32), and immune response genes. gamma coronavirus genus and related nidoviruses lack an LXCXE/D sequence on their orthologs of Nsp15. however, such motifs can be found in other protein in open reading frame 1ab."}
