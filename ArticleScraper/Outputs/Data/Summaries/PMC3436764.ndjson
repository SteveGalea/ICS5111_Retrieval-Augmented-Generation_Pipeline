{"summary": "more than 80% of URTIs are viral. 164 children were hospitalized due to acute respiratory infection from may 2009 to July 2010 in Shanghai. upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are common in children. they can occur three to eight times per year, or even more in very young children. 80% of cases are viral. there are limited data on the infection profiles of URTI cases in children younger than 3 years of age. this is one important reason for the over-prescription of unnecessary antibiotics to children presenting with fever in pediatric hospitals in Shanghai. nasopharyngeal swab was mixed with 4 mL of viral transport medium. 2% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, 20 mg/mL amphotericin B, 40 mg/mL neomycin. 0.2 mL of each sample was used for analysis. three groups of reactions were performed for each sample. group 1 included reactions for IAV, IBV, and AdV. group 3 included reactions for PIV1-3. plex\u00ae RV15 ACE Detection kit is designed for simultaneously detection of 15 respiratory viruses, including IAV, IBV, RSVA, RSVB, AdV, hMPV, PIV1-4, hRV, hEV, coronavirus 229E/NL63. positive controls included a mixture of all 15 virus clones. negative control contained only ddH2O. multiplex PCR run condition was the same as the condition used by Seeplex\u00ae RV15 ACE multiplex PCR. PCR run condition was the same as the condition used by Seeplex\u00ae RV15 ACE multiplex PCR. only one tube contained one pair of PCR primers targeted to individual genre of virus was used for each reaction.

PCR conditions were the same as used in first round reactions. final PCR products were separated by 30 min electrophoresis (10 V/cm) on agarose gel prestained with ethidium bromide. multiplex master mix and 3 L cDNA template were mixed together to a final 20 L volume. PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gels. single PCRs were run for each genre of virus to reconfirm co-infection status.

Seeplex\u00ae RV15 Multiplex PCR Expected products can be amplified by single round Seeplex\u00ae RV15 multiplex PCR. 129 positive samples (78.7%) were detected from 164 samples tested by the Seeplex\u00ae RV15 method. the infection rate in the 13\u201324 month age group was significantly higher than in the 8\u201312 month or 25\u201336 month groups. Detection rates among three diagnosed diseases showed no statistically significant difference. in winter, RSVA/RSVB infections were seen at 10 of 29 samples. none of the other detected viruses showed significant seasonal fluctuations. 164 patients tested had fever, including 29 cases of low fever (37.3\u201338.0\u00b0C), 103 cases of middle fever (38.1\u201339\u00b0C), and 32 cases of high fever. Co-infections Identified by Seeplex\u00ae Multiplex PCR Co-infection rates grouped by individual respiratory viruses ranged from 83.3% for hBoV (5/6) to as low as 33.3% for hEV (5/15). 129 specimens (79.7%) were detected as positive by Seeplex\u00ae RV15 PCR, while only 84 specimens (51.2%) were detected as positive by VRDAL PCR detection kits. 164 samples were tested by VRDAL multiplex PCR. 84 positive samples (51.2%) and 90 positive results for individual viruses were detected by the VRDAL PCR method. 129 positive samples (78.7%) were detected from the 164 samples tested by the Seeplex\u00ae RV15 method. 26 samples showed double infections, 16 cases were triple infections, 6 cases were quadruple infections and 1 case of quintuple infections was also detected. non-agreed tests were resulted from the non-optimum selection of primers for single PCR due to the hypevariation of PIV-3 and PIV-2 genomes. the infection rate in the 13\u201324 month age group was significantly higher than in the 8\u201312 month or 25\u201336 month groups. the highest rate of hEV infection occurred in summer, with 14 of the 15 total cases reported that year. most infections were detected in either summer (25) or winter (8). in winter, RSVA/RSVB infections were seen at 10 of 29 samples. y nose symptoms were 91.2% (cough), 80.0% (runny nose), 85.1% (cough and runny nose) and 60.4% (no cough or runny nose) the first three predominant viruses identified for these groups were the same as hRV, IAV, and PIV2. the VRDAL method indicated that 5.9% of cases had multiple infections, whereas Seeplex\u00ae RV15 PCR indicted that 29.9% had multiple infections. the overall concordance for these two methods was 58.9%. in the past, difficulties in the design of compatible primers limited the detection range of multiplex PCR assays. the Seeplex\u00ae RV15 assay showed higher sensitivity than the VRDAL multiplex PCR. Shanghai reported only a 0.2% co-infection rate in 11,214 URTI children by direct immunofluorescence assay [20]. this difference in co-infections rate is likely caused by the lack of simultaneous detection capability of direct immunofluorescence assays. an initial pathogenic virus inducing opportunistic infections by other seasonal epidemic viruses may cause this high rate of virus co-infections. the most commonly identified respiratory viruses were hMPV (15.4%), IAV (13.2%), and RSV (8.8%) in Shanghai URTI children during the period from Oct, 2006 to Aug, 2007 [9] Wang had reported that the most frequently identified respiratory viruses were hRV (24.7%), hBoV (24.5%), and hRV (15%) identified in NanXiang children during period from Oct, 2006 to Sep, 2008. the IAV/IBV virus showed two peaks in seasonal distribution. this pattern was different from more northern cities like Beijing. more accurate forecasting of seasonal epidemic viruses could help healthcare professionals better prepare for combating respiratory infections in children."}
