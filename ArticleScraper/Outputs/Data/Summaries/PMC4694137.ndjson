{"summary": "Table S1. Strains and plasmids used in this study. Table S2. DNA primers used in this study. Table S3. AgaR1 binding sites. Western blot analyses for the Nterminal 6x his tagged AgaR1 protein. monomeric protein with expected size of 30 kDa is indicated with an arrow. dimer form (60 kDa) is highlighted with an asterisk. the protein levels of AgaR2 were 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 pmol. the protein samples were incubated with 0.2 pmol of the DIGlabeled probe. a representative result from three independent gel shift assays (7% native PAGE) is given. ESPript 2.2 was applied to conduct multiple alignment of protein sequences. identical residues are in white letters with a red background, similar residues are in red letters with a white background, and dots represent gaps. predicted protein secondary structure is given on the top. the protein samples were incubated with 0.2 pmol of the DIGlabeled probe. the protein levels of AgaR2 were 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 pmol. groups, one of which is PTSV (highlighted in blue) click here for additional data file."}
