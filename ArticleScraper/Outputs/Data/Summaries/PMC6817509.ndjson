{"summary": "traditional strains of PEDV (G1 strains) were first detected in the UK in 1971. the outbreak resulted in the losses of $0.9\u20131.8 billion and the death of 7 million pigs. iPED plus and inactivated vaccines produced by Zoetis and VIDO-Intervac were conditionally licensed. however, their efficacy has also been questioned by independent studies. vaccination of PEDV nave sows did not result in strong protection in neonatal piglets (8, 10, 11) a process whereby the structural integrity of the virus was maintained but viral replication was highly diminished but not abrogated would result in a vaccine with the combined advantages of inactivated and attenuated vaccines. in this study, our vaccine development approach consisted of exposing PEDV virions to 44\u00b0C to unfold the capsid, followed by fragmentation or digestion of the genome with RNAse to diminish viral replication. diluted virus culture was exposed to temperatures ranging from 37 to 60\u00b0C for 10 min for unfolding, followed by incubation at 25\u00b0C for 30 min for refolding. cultures were visualized by electron microscopy to ensure structural integrity. a temperature of 44\u00b0C for 10 min was selected for unfolding. virus and untreated control were serially passaged 3 times in vero cells. culture obtained was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min 4\u00b0C. one ml of the supernatant was used to infect vero cell monolayers. unpackaged RNA and DNA were removed by a RNase and DNase cocktail containing 20 units of RNase One (Promega), 20 units Benzonase (Novagen) and 14 units of turbo DNase (Ambion) incubated in 1X buffer (Ambion) for 37\u00b0C for 1.5 h. cDNA library was prepared using TruSeq library construction kit (Illumina Inc., USA) and raw reads were obtained. treated samples were compared by alignment with Clustal Omega (25) to obtain changes which could be attributed to the treatment. clean reads were mapped to the reference genome using BOWTIE2 to detect differentially expressed genes. 0 (0/2) 0 (0/2) 0 (0/2) 0 (0/2) 0 (0/2) Total number of pigs = 8, No. of pigs sacrificed prior to challenge = 2, No. of pigs sacrificed at day 7 post challenge = 6. % Total atrophic enteritis score for the ileum, jejunum, duodenum where 0, negative; 2, mild; 4, moderate; 6, severe; 2, sections with crypt hypertrophy. small intestine, heart, liver, and spleen were collected 2 piglets from each group (N = 2/group) to assess vaccine safety. the remaining piglets (N = 6/group) were challenged orally with 105 TCID50/ml of PEDV CO2013. a pre-validated fluorescent focus neutralization assay was used as previously described (18), following the standard operating procedures of the ADRDL, SDSU. RT-qPCR for Vaccine and Challenge Virus Shedding Virus shedding through fecal route was assessed by a RT-qPCR performed by the NDSU Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. each sample was assessed in duplicate. scores to measure atrophic enteritis characteristic of PED were assigned as follows: 0 = negative, 2 = mild, 4 = moderate, 6 = severe. sections with crypt hypertrophy were assigned an additional 2 points. diluted virus culture was exposed to temperatures ranging from 37 to 60\u00b0C for 10 min for unfolding, followed by incubation at 25\u00b0C for 30 min for refolding, and then moved to 4\u00b0C for 1 h. a temperature of 44\u00b0C for 10 min was selected for unfolding, followed by incubation for 5, 4, 3, or 2 h. treated virus and untreated control were serially passaged 3 times in vero cells. after each passage, flasks were subject to three freeze-thaw cycles. culture obtained was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min 4\u00b0C. one ml of supernatant was used to infect vero cell monolayers. unpackaged RNA and DNA were removed by a RNase and DNase cocktail containing 20 units of RNase One (Promega), 20 units Benzonase (Novagen) and 14 units of turbo DNase (Ambion) incubated in 1X buffer for 37\u00b0C for 1.5 h. cDNA library was prepared using TruSeq library construction kit (Illumina Inc., USA) and raw reads (100 bp) were obtained. clean reads were mapped to the reference genome using BOWTIE2 to detect differentially expressed genes. differentially expressed genes were identified by the possionDis, EBSeq software for samples without replicates (27). total number of pigs = 8, No. of pigs sacrificed prior to challenge = 2, No. of pigs sacrificed at day 7 post challenge = 6. % Total atrophic enteritis score for the ileum, jejunum, duodenum where 0, negative; 2, mild; 4, moderate; 6, severe; 2, sections with crypt hypertrophy. small intestine, heart, liver, and spleen were collected 2 piglets from each group (N = 2/group) to assess vaccine safety. the remaining piglets were challenged orally with 105 TCID50/ml of PEDV CO2013. RT-qPCR for Vaccine and Challenge Virus Shedding Virus shedding through fecal route was assessed by a RT-qPCR performed by the NDSU Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. each pig was considered a biological replicate (N = 6, as 2 pigs/ group were sacrificed to assess vaccine safety prior to challenge), and each sample was assessed in duplicate. antigen detection in enterocytes by IHC was semi-quantitatively scored based on 0 = negative, 2 = positive, 10%, 4 = positive, 11\u201350%, 6 = positive, >50%. a temperature of 44\u00b0C for 10 min was chosen for reversible unfolding of the viral capsid. untreated control virus culture remained structurally intact as expected. reduction in viral replication was proportional to dose and time of exposure to RNase in the heat-treated virions. a final dose of 24 h (1,084,320 rad) was selected to prepare the inactivated control vaccine. animals vaccinated with the heat and RNAse treated virions mounted strong Ab responses against the protective PEDV spike antigen. however, Ab responses to both viral antigens remained low prior to the challenge. the differences between the groups were statistically significant. the spike protein-specific Ab and virus neutralizing Ab levels were strongly correlated in the heat and RNAse treated PEDV vaccinated pigs, with a correlation coefficient of 95.11%. experimental groups N = 6 pigs/group (2 pigs/group were sacrificed prior to challenge to assess vaccine safety); Y axis, mean of duplicate values of viral RNA copy number per gram of fecal matter; dark bar, Day 3 post-challenge; Light bar, Day 7 post-challenge; a, Significantly different from the unvaccinated group; b, Significantly different from the other vaccine group; p 0.05 by the Student's T the total necropsy scores, a sum of both the fecal and histology scores, were significantly different (p = 0.04) between the two vaccine groups but not between the unvaccinated group and the irradiated vaccine group. green arrows indicate areas of villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia. the experimental Vaccines Are Safe No side effects or clinical signs of PED were observed in vaccinated pigs after either the primary or booster vaccines. the heat and RNase treated PEDV virions were detected by amplification after 3 serial passages in vero cells. a conservative in-frame insertion was detected at position 355 in the S1 region, changing the amino acid sequence from L----AT to LKKKGAT. a conservative in-frame insertion was detected at position 355 in the S1 region, changing the amino acid sequence from L----AT to LKKKGAT. a temperature of 44\u00b0C for 10 min was chosen for reversible unfolding of the viral capsid without completely inactivating the virus. treatment with heat and RNAse Diminishes Viral Replication while maintaining structural integrity. a dose of 10 units of RNase A and 1,000 units of RNase T with an exposure time of 4 h was chosen as optimal for the final vaccine preparation. viral replication was detected only in the 3rd passage in vero cells. pigs vaccinated with the heat and RNAse treated virions mounted strong Ab responses against the protective PEDV spike antigen. but ab responses to non-structural nucleocapsid protein (NP) remained low prior to the challenge. unvaccinated control pigs remained sero-negative for the duration of the study. all experimental animals were RT-qPCR negative on day 0 post-challenge. all 6 pigs in the irradiated vaccine group turned positive by DPC7. the difference between the unvaccinated and irradiated vaccine group was not statistically significant. the total microscopic score was 4.16 for the unvaccinated animals and 7.33 for the pigs immunized with the irradiated vaccine. left panel (A,D,G) Hematoxylin stained sections showing representative microscopic lesions (10X magnification). green arrows indicate areas of villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia. no microscopic lesions or viral antigen were detected in the small intestine sections, heart, spleen, and liver of the 2 animals necropsied prior to challenge. heat and RNAse treated virions from infected vero cells resulted in a total of 59.42 and 24.44 MB of raw reads were obtained by RNA seq for the treated and untreated samples. a conservative in-frame insertion was detected at position 355 in the S1 region. a conservative in-frame insertion was detected at position 355 in the S1 region. changing the amino acid sequence from L----AT to LKKKGAT. gamma irradiation has been traditionally used to inactivate viruses. mechanisms involved include nucleic acid degradation, destruction of covalent bonds, and release of free radicals. a gamma irradiated, Lassa virus vaccine failed to protect vaccinated mice. dendritic cell targeted spike protein-based subunit vaccine against PEDV exacerbated intestinal pathology in vaccinated pigs. heat and RNAse treated virus culture was amplified after 3 passages in cell culture. absence of strong Ab responses to the non-structural NP indicates active vaccine viral replication was absent in the host or was undetectable. replication deficient genomes with deletions or mutations are produced during serial passaging of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) for attenuation. mutations in the genomes can complement each other in trans to produce plaques in vitro. this observation can be explained by vaccine virus replication in the host being limited by the requirement of coinfection of the same cell. testing of two attenuated PEDV strains produced by serial passage in weanling pigs showed that the passaged viruses were attenuated but were not protected against challenge viral shedding or clinical signs. qPCR was not detected in the heat and RNAse treated vaccine group in this study. fecal viral RNA load of 8.35 log copy numbers developed microscopic lesions, but not severe clinical signs. no fecal viral shedding or intestinal pathology was detected in the pigs immunized with the heat and RNase treated vaccine.
