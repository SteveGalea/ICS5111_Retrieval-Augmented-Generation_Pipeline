{"summary": "close cooperation between curative and public health sectors in the Netherlands was necessary for timely identification, referral, and investigation of patients with suspected EVD. timeliness recordings of all referred patients with suspected EVD were collected from first date of illness until arrival in the referral academic hospital. semistructured interviews, 5 focus groups, and 1 modified focus group were conducted with stakeholders involved in the identification, transportation, and investigation of patients with possible EVD. the interviews were conducted with representatives of national associations (ie, 2 GP networks, PHS, ambulance services, academic hospitals, and the working group for hospital infection prevention) analysis All interviews and focus groups were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. an initial coding guide was established by the facilitator (A.V.O.) the interviews were conducted with representatives of national associations (ie, 2 GP networks, PHS, peripheral and academic hospitals), the health inspectorate, and the working group for hospital infection prevention. the focus groups were conducted with regional public health consultants, PHSs, peripheral and academic hospitals, and regional ambulance services. an initial coding guide was established by the facilitator (A.V.O.) to improve reliability and reduce researcher bias, 2 other researchers (L.G.C.S. and A.J.) coded the transcripts independently. a final coding guide was established. the academic center took the lead in regional coordination preparedness, instead of the PHS. GPs GPs perceived risk of seeing an actual patient with EVD as low; therefore, GPs had little involvement in preparedness. the role to advise and support peripheral hospitals, ambulances, and GPs in preparedness was new and not yet standardized. academic hospitals had a prominent role in the Ebola preparedness, except for 4 of 7 individual GPs (57%). medical care for patients with confirmed EVD was centralized in the national preparedness plans. four of 8 academic hospitals were selected for prolonged treatment of patients with confirmed EVD. this measure did not achieve the intended decreased burden for preparedness. joint expert meetings with curative and public health stakeholders at the national level were a new initiative by the CID. more information and standardization of personal protection measures (PPE) were requested, as diversity of PPE was the reason for concern among health care workers. aCase no. 8 directly contacted public health service. the EVD laboratory tests were negative for all patients. alternative confirmed diagnoses were malaria (n = 7), bacterial sepsis (1), norovirus (1), and no diagnosis (4). ambulance sector, peripheral hospitals, or none (individual GPs) preparedness took place first within organizations and then between involved organizations. communication systems did not fulfill the need for information among all stakeholders, for example, for peripheral hospitals. peripheral hospitals needed more support and advice from the regional academic hospital. the coordinating role of the CID was generally accepted and well appreciated especially regarding timeliness and clarity. the coordinating role of the CID was generally accepted and well appreciated especially regarding timeliness and clarity. ID consultation varied between 0 and 4 days (median: 1 day, n = 12) one patient did not consult a physician, instead a caretaker consulted the PHS directly. after decision for referral, it took 5.0 hours until ambulance arrival at the hospital. study showed need for more coherent multisectoral preparedness at regional level, as well as enhanced guidance from the national level. multilevel and multisectoral collaboration structures were most advanced aspects in preparedness, as a result from pandemic preparedness. the decision was made to centralize prolonged care of patients with EVD in 4 of 8 academic hospitals, in line with other countries. participants requested national and interorganizational standardization of type and use of PPE. participants requested national and interorganizational standardization of type and use of PPE. in the WHO JEE-Tool, we assess one's country capacity to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to public health threats. quantitative indicators as timeliness of procedures are essential to evaluate the functioning of the response in reality. the question is which delays are relevant to evaluate preparedness for this infection with low incidence but high impact. a focus group for the CID was performed separately; these results were not included in the earlier described results. the main outcomes, however, were comparable with outcomes of the study. the regional medical emergency preparedness and planning offices (GHOR) in the Netherlands were discussed. focus group sessions and semistructured interviews among public health and curative stakeholders revealed a need for more standardized coordination and operational procedures at regional and national levels. guidelines for institutional preparedness and blueprints for regional and national coordination need to be developed."}
