{"summary": "the 18th annual Rocky Mountain Virology Association meeting (Figure 1) continued its legacy of virology, prion biology, and mentorship at an altitude of 9000 ft (2.7 km) the meeting began with the keynote presentation by Susan R. Weiss (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA) endogenous cellular dsRNA, which accumulates in the absence of ADAR1, can also activate RNase L and lead to apoptotic cell death. MHV-A59 replicates in the CNS causing encephalitis and in the liver causing hepatitis. several gammaherpesviruses encode a viral cyclin. previous work in their lab demonstrated that the viral cyclin is required for pathogenesis and reactivation from latency. TRIMs are a large family of proteins, many of which are inducible by type I interferon and serve to suppress virus infection through direct interactions with viral proteins resulting in disruption of viral replication. primate TRIM5 is a consequential inhibitor that suppresses lentivirus replication (e.g., HIV-1) in a highly host species- and virus species-specific fashion. PKR is well-known to promote translational shut-off via inhibition of canonical translation initiation. however, the mechanisms by which RNase L represses translational have remained unclear. Burke and colleagues investigated the effects of RNase L on SG assembly and translation. increased CDK8 expression increased glycolytic gene expression and infectious particle formation. reduced CDK8 activity did not affect viral genome replication but did reduce infectious particle production. galovirus (HCMV) is known to be the most prevalent cause of neurological birth defects. HCMV downregulates Nidogen-1 (NID1), an important component of the extracellular matrix secreted by endothelial cells, by both protein stability and decreased mRNA transcription. a series of transmigration assays were prepared to determine if the absence of NID1 increases dispersal of HCMV. chikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes large outbreaks of rheumatologic disease. studies in humans and animal models suggest CHIKV infection persists in musculoskeletal tissues. pathogenic CHIKV strains persist in joints of immunocompetent mice. GC formation and CHIKV-specific serum neutralizing antibody responses suggest that the rapid influx of inflammatory monocytes to the dLN impairs the development of adaptive immune responses. all animal studies were performed following guidelines and protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. sfRNAs appear to interact with a \u2018regulon\u2019 of RBPs to disrupt cellular mRNA decay regulation and other RNA processing factors. sfRNAs accumulate as the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 progression of cellular exoribonuclease Xrn1 is blocked by structured RNA elements. xrRNAs exist in a diverse set of flaviviruses, including some specific to insects or with no known arthropod vector. xrRNAs comprise two secondary structural classes that align with previously reported phylogenic analysis. no animal or human studies were performed. despite attempts to connect previously identified substrates of B1 or VRK2 with the VRK2 dependent phenotype, they have been unsuccessful. ongoing studies are aimed at identifying both the substrate and mechanism through which VRK2 promotes vaccinia replication in the absence of B1. depletion of microglia altered cytokine and chemokine responses during viral infection and was associated with increased mortality (up to 100% with WNV), earlier onset of disease and increased viral loads within the CNS. all animal studies were performed following guidelines and protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Colorado Anschutz. the identification of owl monkeys or particular Envs that support HIV-1 infection has tremendous potential in improving our ability to model HIV-1 infection in nonhuman primates. the identification of owl monkeys or particular Envs that support HIV-1 infection has tremendous potential. previous studies have identified non-functional Tetherin alleles in owl monkeys. they are now undertaking a systematic study of Tetherin polymorphism in other captive owl monkey species. they have genotyped Tetherin from 45 owl monkeys (Aotus nancymaae) out of 5,507 STAT1 binding events in IFNG treated cells, 1,165 (21%) were derived from ERVs and other transposons. preliminary results suggest primate and rodent immune responses have undergone evolutionary rewiring, facilitated by lineage-specific ERVs. several host ncRNAs have been shown to be upregulated during gammaherpesvirus infection and play integral roles in pathogenesis. these include the B2 SINEs, which stimulate NF-B signaling that ultimately increases viral gene expression, and vault RNAs that protect B cells from apoptosis. positive-sense RNA viruses have shown PC accumulation at viral replication sites in cells infected with brome mosaic virus, hepatitis C, and poliovirus. the lipid is an amphipathic lipid which makes up about 50% of the total phospholipid content in eukaryotic cellular membranes. arachidonic acid (AA) is a long polyunsaturated fatty acid that can be incorporated into cellular membranes. downstream of AA is 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) catalyzing the production of leukotrienes. her lab hypothesizes AA-mediated membrane biogenesis facilitates the formation of viral replication complexes on the ER membrane. NS5 protein plays multiple functions during infection, enabling viral replication and counteracting host antiviral responses. they identified 53 host proteins that bind or form complexes with NS5 during infection. NS5 binding to U5 snRNP proteins hijacks splicing machinery. DENV manipulates the lipid metabolic pathways of the host to acquire a lipid envelope. the goal is to inhibit metabolic enzymes required for virus replication and choke acute virus infection in the human host. they have shown that the unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis pathway is manipulated by DENV. aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus tested a nootkatone product for insecticide and repellency activity against the two most prominent vectors of Zika virus. they tested pyrethroid-resistant and pyrethroid-susceptible strains of these species to determine whether or not this physiological status affected their susceptibility to nootkatone. all studies using human subjects or tissue samples have been approved or deemed non-human subject research. if introduced, RVFV could cause significant economic losses to the livestock industry. if introduced, RVFV could establish itself as a zoonosis with little hope of eradication. insecticide resistance and its known mechanisms have been extensively studied in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes from southern Mexico. the primary method to control the spread of these vectors is by insecticide application. current results show lower mortality in mosquitoes from Mexico compared to the control. RABV is a highly lethal zoonosis, and RABV circulation is maintained by a diverse number of bat and wild carnivore reservoirs in north America. the south-central skunk RABV lineage is one historic lineage that has expanded its geographic range. genome and phylogenetic studies have revealed that host switching is extremely pervasive in most virus families. the evolutionary and molecular bases of virus host switching remain obscure. Keir proposes applying the extensive molecular toolkits for zebrafish and vaccinia virus research in unique combination of model systems. mutations in the F protein allow the virus to escape antibody neutralization are of high concern. her lab seeks to establish a molecular model to predict antibody escape mutants in the F protein. the predicted antibody escape mutations were engineered into an infectious clone. mutant viruses lacking both K3L and E3L were propagated in complementing cells with K3L chromosomally integrated. each strain independently acquired K3L via HGT from the complementing cells. histology slides were stained with masson\u2019s trichrome stain and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain. immunohistochemistry was used to show localization of virus and immune cells. protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Idaho. the project was funded in part by the National Science Foundation REU Site award no. 1757826. the exact mechanism by which microglia protects the CNS remains unclear. they used in vivo and ex vivo methods to model WNV encephalitis. 80% of Zika virus infections are subclinical. experimental models are urgently needed to recapitulate human disease. many studies have relied on the use of immune deficient mice. guinea pigs, an immune competent laboratory animal, are susceptible to ZIKV infection. se autoprocessing liberates the mature protease from its Gag-Pol polyprotein precursor. recombinant mature PRs carrying these RAMs normally remain responsive to PI suppression, not correlating well with the clinical manifestation of PI resistance. they report optimization and evaluation of a cell-based functional assay. each year influenza hemagglutinin 1 (H1) causes millions of cases. the current vaccination methods only protect against certain strains. the current vaccination methods only protect against certain strains. chronic HCV infection is a major global health problem, with an estimated 70 million individuals infected worldwide. seven distinct HCV genotypes have been identified. if undetected or left untreated, chronic HCV infection can lead to serious liver diseases. all studies using human subjects with AbbVie\u2019s DAAs have been approved by the respective institutional review boards of the study sites. asexual template-dependent RNA replication mechanisms, while efficient, render viruses susceptible to error catastrophe. poliovirus becomes exquisitely sensitive to ribavirin-induced error catastrophe. chimeric polymerases were inserted into infectious clones of poliovirus and coxsackievirus B3. stress granules and P-bodies form during the integrated stress response when translation is globally suppressed. stress granules harbor translation factors and P-bodies contain mRNA decay factors. mRNAs that accumulate in stress granules are non-translating. most mRNAs that accumulate in stress granules are non-translating. mRNAs can interact with stress granules in a transient or highly stable manner. amplification of prion seeds present in tissues and bodily fluids of infected hosts has enhanced our ability to identify prions during the earlier phases of disease. this new generation of amplification assays have reported sensitivity levels rivaling that of bioassay. however, a cross platform comparison of these assays has not been performed. the mathiason lab has extended its previous studies to examine hematogenous prion load in blood collected minutes, days, weeks, and months post exposure. they corroborated their previous findings by detecting amyloid formation in whole blood and blood cell fractions harvested as early as 15 minutes post inoculation. these findings bring the prion field a step closer to characterizing hematogenous prions and their role in the spread of prion disease. transgenic mouse bioassay will further assess strain differences between these strains. the results from these investigations will improve our understanding of prion strain distribution. a vesicle trafficking-related gene (NBEAL1) increased approximately 1.5-fold in S cells compared to R cells. these RNA-seq changes were verified using real-time PCR and protein expression techniques. they hypothesize that these candidate genes are susceptibility factors critical to the propagation of prions. next-generation sequencing is able to produce a large amount of data for multiple target regions in high throughput applications relatively cheaply. but next-generation sequencing does have systematic biases that can result in base miscall and erroneous read alignment in regions of low complexity. they highlight the improved sensitivity that Illumina has for identifying SNP variants that were missed through Sanger sequencing due to allele-specific expression bias. lower levels of LANA expression in the absence of the viral cyclin are associated with impaired reactivation from latency. they hypothesize that the viral cyclin coordinates gene expression to facilitate viral reactivation from latency. they are currently using single cell RNA sequencing to analyze both permissive fibroblasts and resting B cells. ribonuclease L regulates mRNA metabolism, translation, and stress granule assembly in mammalian cells during double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) stress. both protein kinase R (PKR) and RNase L function to promote translational shut-off. but the mechanisms by which RNase L represses translational have remained unclear. the interferon- (IFN-) mRNA escapes RNase L-mediated mRNA turnover. this permits translation of IFN- mRNA at early times post-dsRNA. mRNA turnover is driven by mRNA turnover prior to ribosomal RNA degradation. no animal or human studies were performed. no animal or human studies were performed. the stage is set to address mechanistic questions about HSV-1 and VZV latency/reactivation. HCMV downregulates Nidogen-1 (NID1), an important component of the extracellular matrix. a series of transmigration assays using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) seeded onto a polycarbonate membrane were prepared. a total transmigration of the monocytes was measured after 24 and 48 h. HCMV infection of HUVECS has been shown to increase transmigration. pathogenic CHIKV strains persist in joints of immunocompetent mice. attenuated CHIKV strain 181/25 is cleared by adaptive immunity. dLN of mice infected with pathogenic CHIKV displayed architectural disruption. zika virus (ZIKV), a single-stranded positive sense RNA flavivirus transmitted by Aedes aegypti (mosquito), generates stable subgenomic flavivirus RNAs (sfRNA) sfRNA decay intermediates accumulate to high levels in infected cells and studies have implicated sfRNAs in cytopathology. sfRNAs appear to interact with a \u2018regulon\u2019 of RBPs to disrupt cellular mRNA decay regulation and other RNA processing factors. sfRNAs have been implicated in a variety of interactions with both the host and vector during viral infection. the evolution of exoribonuclease resistance, the use of xrRNAs in synthetic biology, and for the development of targeted therapies to combat flavivirus diseases worldwide. the vaccinia B1 kinase is an essential viral protein that promotes vaccinia infection at multiple junctures by interacting with and subverting host cellular pathways. ongoing studies are aimed at identifying both the substrate and mechanism through which VRK2 promotes vaccinia replication in the absence of B1. the role of microglia during flavivirus-induced encephalitis is poorly understood. all animal studies were performed following guidelines and protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Colorado Anschutz. they presented data describing the interaction between pandemic HIV-1 and its host receptors, CD4 and CCR5 within a population of captive owl monkeys. this presents a major obstacle for modeling HIV-1 in nonhuman primates. all animal studies were performed following guidelines and protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. rhesus macaque Tetherin is highly effective at blocking HIV-1 infection, while the human version is not. this is problematic because HIV-1 vaccine testing has mainly been performed in macaques. cell lines expressing tetherin alleles challenged them with various HIV-1 isolates. they are currently screening HIV-1 and SIV Nef genes for their ability to counteract owl monkey tetherin. no animal or human studies were performed. out of 5,507 STAT1 binding events in IFNG treated cells, 1,165 (21%) of these sites were derived from ERVs and other transposons. they selected 50 candidate enhancers derived from ERVs and other transposons that potentially regulate mouse interferon-stimulated genes. ncRNAs are regulated is integral to understanding their role in pathogenesis. promoters include those of host ncRNAs (5S rRNA, tRNA, U6 snRNA), of the HV68 TMERs, EBV EBERs, and adenovirus VA RNA. PC is synthesized via the Kennedy pathway or the PEMT pathway. the PEMT pathway is only common in liver cells where it produces maximum 30% PC. the PEMT pathway is only common in liver cells where it produces maximum 30% PC. linoleic acid pathway synthesizes AA as a metabolic intermediate. downstream of AA is 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) catalyzing the production of leukotrienes. her lab hypothesizes AA-mediated membrane biogenesis facilitates the formation of viral replication complexes on the ER membrane. NS5 protein plays multiple functions during infection, enabling viral replication and counteracting host antiviral responses. they performed proteomic studies using an NS5 tagged DENV. they identified 53 host proteins that bind or form complexes with NS5 during infection and validated a number of these interactions. the goal is to inhibit metabolic enzymes required for virus replication. fatty acids maintain membrane fluidity and can be incorporated into complex lipids. they have now assessed the significance of enzymes downstream of SCD1 in the DENV life cycle. CDC bottle bioassays showed the pyrethroid-susceptible strains of both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus were more susceptible to nootkatone than the pyrethroid-resistant strains. the repellency and biting inhibition of nootkatone was primary tested on treated human arms using a repellency bioassay. Culex tarsalis Coquillett mosquitoes hypothesized to be locally-important bridge vectors in the event of an introduction of RVFV. mosquitoes were trapped using a paired-site design with traps placed at feedlots and nearby sites to determine whether the presence of livestock affected mosquito abundances. ae. albopictus has developed an observable resistance, requiring increasingly higher concentrations to be killed. it is important to understand if Ae. albopictus is also developing resistance. current results show lower mortality in mosquitoes from Mexico compared to the control. striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) have been a recognized RABV reservoir in north America for much of the past century. several lineages recognized decades ago are still circulating today. the south-central skunk lineage is one historic lineage that has expanded its geographic range. vaccinia virus will identify host and viral determinants of host switching. he will characterize evolution and function of the vertebrate interferon response in zebrafish to identify host determinants of virus replication and host switching. the wild type infectious clone was subjected to selective passages in vitro in the presence of motavizumab or the antibody AM14. samples that required higher antibody concentration for neutralization were sequenced and compared to predicted mutations. the results are promising, but further experiments are needed to test the limits of the model. mic analysis revealed target site duplications, poly(A) tails, and a lack of introns from the integrated construct. results reveal that LINE-1 mobilization of host genes to virus genomes might represent a primary mechanism in virus evolution. no human or animal studies were performed. all animal studies were performed following guidelines and protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Idaho. study observes differences in viral titer from lung epithelial cells infected by a single virus or co-infected by murine coronavirus and rhinovirus. monoclonal antibodies can be used to treat infection by neutralizing the virus. they hypothesize that RSV will mutate under stress of a sub-inhibitory dose of D25 resulting in escape from neutralization. they introduced RSV to rounds of selection in the presence of D25 and allowed time for mutations to arise. mice whose microglia had been depleted using the drug PLX5622 had measurable viral titers in the brain as early as day 4 post infection. microglia limit the amount of caspase-3 apoptosis in BSCs treated with PLX. 80% of Zika virus infections are subclinical. guinea pigs are unreliable to characterize the contribution of the immune response to ZIKV transplacental trafficking, fetal infection and potential life-long effects to offspring. the guinea pig is an appealing model for studies targeting investigation of the maternal-fetal interface because their placental structure and fetal development most closely resemble humans. all 11 known anti-HIV protease inhibitors suppressed precursor autoprocessing with low micromolar EC50s. the other protease inhibitors had no impact on precursor autoprocessing. they also found complex functional interplays between residues inside and outside of the PR coding sequence. each centralized HA gene will be expressed in pcDNA, recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus type 5 virus, and recombinant vaccinia virus. the cellular and humoral immune responses will be assessed and compared to wild-type genes expressed in the same viral vectors. pegylated interferon/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV) has been available since early 2000. this treatment has not been widely used due to its variable efficacy against different HCV genotypes (SVR ranging from 50 to 80%), severe side effects, long treatment durations (24 or 48 weeks) chimeric picornaviral polymerases were built using the poliovirus and coxsackievirus B3 enzymes. they used viral RNA recombination assays, phylogenetic sequence data, and atomic structures of viral polymerases to identify features of the polymerase required for sexual RNA replication mechanisms. poliovirus becomes exquisitely sensitive to ribavirin-induced error catastrophe. chimeric polymerases were inserted into infectious clones of poliovirus and coxsackievirus B3. a subset of them supported virus replication in cells. the work was supported by NIH award R01 AI-059130. mRNAs associated with nascent chains can dynamically interact with stress granules. but they do not observe mRNAs initiating translation while stably associated with stress granules. this results imply that sequestration of mRNAs within stress granules in a stable state is a novel regulatory step dictating mRNA localization. conventional (IHC) and amplification assays (sPMCA and RT-QuIC) perform well in the detection of PrPSc deposition across the dilutional series. they also revealed enhanced detection of prion seeding activity in brain tissue at the lower end of the dilutional series. all animal studies were performed following guidelines and protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Colorado State University. chronic wasting disease is a fatal prion disease affecting free-ranging and captive cervids. transcripts from a vesicle trafficking-related gene decreased approximately two-fold in their S cells. transcripts from a vesicle trafficking-related gene (NBEAL1) increased approximately 1.5-fold in S cells compared to R cells. the only known cellular factor essential for prion propagation is PrPC. ysteines are needed to further synthesize selenoproteins. they are undergoing analysis to determine the role of Sps1 and oxidative stress pathways in propagating infectious prions in their S and R cells. they are utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing techniques to remove functional genes and an expression construct to increase levels in both S and R cells. compared the two strategies by gathering consensus sequences for 5 genes in 23 Ma\u2019s Night Monkey (Aotus nancymaae) with both Sanger and the Illumnia Miseq platforms. they show that this improved sensitivity can be a problem when dealing with repetitive or paralogous gene families."}
