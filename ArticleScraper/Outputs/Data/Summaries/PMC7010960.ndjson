{"summary": "the seven classes are positive-sense, negative-sense and double-stranded RNA viruses, single-stranded and double-stranded DNA viruses, retroviruses, and pararetroviruses. the single-stranded positive-sense or (+)ssRNA viruses comprise the largest and most diverse group of eukaryote-infecting viruses. in 2013, we identified two'mosquito-associated' narna-like viruses. one strand contains a single long ORF that encodes a protein inferred by homology to be the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) rORF covers nearly the entire sequence of 3,000 nt. narnaviral RdRp is highly divergent from those of other eukaryotic RNA viruses. Detailed comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses suggest that the Narnaviridae are descended from a levivirus-like bacteriophage. the escape of a group of these viruses into the cytosol may have given rise to the Narnavirus genus. 98\u201399 per cent of viral RNA in the cell is in a single-stranded positive-sense form, whereas the remainder exists as single-stranded negative-sense replication intermediates. in this work we present comprehensive comparative analysis of narnaviral genomes, in which we assess the prevalence, distribution, and sequence features of rORFs. narnaviral genomic sequences were completed for previously described rORF-containing narnaviruses. they were extended at their 5\u2032 termini by 479 nt, 10 nt, and 364 nt, respectively. the latter two sequences are the same length (3093 nt) and encode RdRps which are 97.95 per cent identical at the amino acid level. the RdRp stop codons end at positions 14 nt, 13 nt, and 13 nt, respectively, from the 3\u2032 termini of the genomes. the length of the 3\u2032 UTR mirrors that of ScNV-20S (12 nt; GenBank: NC_004051.1) the holobiont sources of these TSA sequences were phylogenetically diverse. we also selected a number of mitovirus and ourmiavirus sequences as outgroups. 141 sequences were given in total. ourmiaviruses encode a capsid protein on one of their genome segments. some of the \u2018ourmia-like\u2019 viruses encode a capsid protein in a separate ORF on the RdRp-encoding RNA. narnaviral sequences predominantly fell into one of two major clades. the rORF-containing sequences appear not to form a monophyletic clade, but instead cluster in several regions of the phylogeny. the core RdRp catalytic regions\u2014motifs A to E in the palm domain and motifs F and G in the fingers\u2014are well-conserved. nt and the pairwise RdRp amino acid identities ranged from 15.2% to 99.9%. the genome may be bipartite, with the RdRp being encoded on the longer (L) segment. the functional association of the putative segments has not been shown experimentally. the terminal sequences of alphanarnaviral and betanarnaviral genomes were found to be dissimilar. local RNA secondary structures are predicted to occur at the 5\u2032 ends of the ONLV1 and ONLV2 genomes. local RNA secondary structures are predicted to occur at the 5\u2032 ends of the ONLV1 and ONLV2 genomes. s are not expected to be translated, and the inclusion of spurious long non-5\u2032-proximal ORFs might dilute the signal from translatable 5\u2032-proximal ORFs. we designated the reading frame of the RdRp ORF as frame \u2018F0\u2019 (for forward orientation, 0 frame), followed by frames \u2018F + 1\u2019 and \u2018F + 2\u2019 in the same orientation. the reverse complement of the set of codons in frames F0, F + 1 and a blastx search of the sequence shows that it encodes amino acid sequence that shows close homology to the RdRp of the related Hubei narna-like virus 19 (e-value = 4 1012). Strikingly, other than the RdRp ORF, 5\u2032-proximal stop-codon free regions occupying >25 per cent of the genome were present only in the R0 frames. ling narna-like virus 8 (KX883605.1), beihai narna-like virus 24 (KX883500.1) and the TSA sequence from Caridina multidentata (IABX01132835.1) all contain rORFs occupying >90 per cent of the respective sequences. sequences predicted to encode RdRp proteins with >90 per cent amino acid identity were clustered using CD-HIT (Fu et al. 2012) rorf codons are ordered according to their median frequency in alphanarnaviruses that contain the rORF. codons are ordered according to their median frequency in alphanarnaviruses that contain the rORF. rdRp ORFs of non-rORF alphanarnaviruses, rORF alphanarnaviruses and betanarnaviruses are indicated with orange, green and blue points. the wenling narna-like virus 7 (WNLV7) and Hubei narna-like virus 16 (HNLV16) sequences are indicated. this raises the possibility that the paucity of CUA, UUA, and UCA codons in the r rORF-containing and non-rORF-containing alphanarnaviral sequences have a GC3 content of 90.4 per cent. the mean GC3 contents of rORF-containing and non-rORF-containing alphanarnaviral sequences were considerably lower. codon usage could be used as an indicator of the likely host taxonomic group or groups for narnaviruses. overlapping genes normally evolve via overprinting of an ancestral gene. overlapping genes typically exhibit novel protein folds. overlapping genes typically have to evolve via overprinting of an ancestral gene. the grey dashed line indicates an approximate 5 per cent false positive threshold after correcting for multiple tests. conservation was assessed in a 15 codon/amino acid window. additional consensus motifs indicated with asterisks are as follows. increased synonymous site conservation was independently observed in this region for betanarnaviruses. the most highly conserved region in the putative rORF-encoded amino acid sequence was directly opposite the RdRp motif B. 2.9 EVEs related to rORF-containing narnaviruses are found in insect WGS data sets. in all nine cases, the top virus match was one of KX883548, MH213236, KX883539, or KP642119, all of which are indeed insect-associated rORF-containing narnaviruses. the sequences with GenBank accession numbers KF298275.1, KF298276.1, and KF298284.1 were extended at their 5\u2032 termini by 479 nt, 10 nt, and 364 the RdRp stop codons end at positions 14 nt, 13 nt, and 13 nt, respectively, from the 3\u2032 termini of the genomes. the length of the 3\u2032 UTR mirrors that of ScNV-20S (12 nt; GenBank: NC_004051.1) holobiont sources were phylogenetically diverse and included 21 arthropod, 8 fungal, and 10 plant species. we also selected a number of mitovirus and ourmiavirus sequences as outgroups, besides additional narna-like virus sequences from Shi et al. (2016). botrytis ourmia-like virus clusters unambiguously with ourmiaviruses rather than with the narnaviruses. ourmiaviruses encode a capsid protein on one of their genome segments. some of the \u2018ourmia-like\u2019 viruses encode a capsid protein in a separate ORF on the RdRp-encoding RNA. the rORF-containing sequences appear not to form a monophyletic clade, but instead cluster in several regions of the phylogeny. the core RdRp catalytic regions\u2014motifs A to E in the palm domain and motifs F and G in the fingers\u2014are well-conserved despite the overall high degree of sequence divergence. the pairwise RdRp amino acid sequence identities ranged from 2215 nt to 3610 nt (Supplementary Fig. S1) the genome may be bipartite, with the RdRp being encoded on the longer (L) segment. the functional association of the putative segments has not been shown experimentally. terminal sequences of alphanarnaviral and betanarnaviral genomes were found to be dissimilar. local RNA secondary structures are predicted to occur at the 5\u2032 ends of the ONLV1 and ONLV2 genomes, coincident with a reduction in synonymous site variation in the RdRp ORF. non-5\u2032-proximal ORFs are not expected to be translated. the inclusion of spurious long non-5\u2032-proximal ORFs might dilute the signal from translatable 5\u2032-proximal ORFs. the longest 5\u2032-proximal stop codon-free regions in each of the possible positive-strand and negative-strand reading frames. bei narna-like virus 18 is annotated as containing a 155-nt 5\u2032 UTR. but this UTR contains no stop codons in-frame with the RdRp. a blastx search of the sequence shows that it encodes amino acid sequence that shows close homology to the RdRp of the related Hubei narna-like virus 19. the closely related sequences of wenling narna-like virus 8 (KX883605.1), beihai narna-like virus 24 (KX883500.1) and the TSA sequence from Caridina multidentata (IABX01132835.1) all contain rORFs occupying >90 per cent of the respective sequences. sequences predicted to encode RdRp proteins with >90 per cent amino acid identity were clustered using CD-HIT (Fu in the RdRp ORFs of the betanarnaviruses (mean usage per associated amino acid = 0.1323, 0.1452, and 0.1784, respectively) sequences with long rORFs specifically avoid these codons and use proportionately more of each alternative codon to encode these two amino acids. the upper and lower hinges are located at the first and third quartiles, respectively. the RdRp ORFs of non-rORF alphanarnaviruses, rORF alphanarnaviruses and betanarnaviruses are indicated with orange, green and blue points. the wenling narna-like virus 7 (WNLV7) and Hubei narna-like virus 16 (HNLV16) sequences are indicated. the paucity of codons in the rORF-containing sequences could at least partially reflect an adaptation to particular torula graminis (phylum Basidiomycota) has a GC3 content of 90.4 per cent. the mean GC3 contents of rORF-containing and non-rORF-containing alphanarnaviral sequences were considerably lower. however, selection against host codon usage bias cannot readily be explained by GC bias or host codon usage bias. both the RdRp and rORF amino acid sequences are highly basic. the high isoelectric point of the RdRp is consistent with it binding viral nucleic acid to form ribonucleoprotein complexes. synonymous site conservation was assessed in a 15 codon/amino acid window. additional consensus motifs indicated with asterisks are as follows. increase in synonymous site conservation in the rdRp ORF lies between codons 23 and 37. increased synonymous site conservation was independently observed in this region for betanarnaviruses. the most highly conserved region in the putative rORF-encoded amino acid sequence was directly opposite the RdRp motif B, in a 15-amino acid window of the alignment centred on position 510. narnaviral sequences form two major clades. the proposed genus Betanarnavirus contains viruses associated with diverse unicellular eukaryotes. the proposed genus contains viruses associated with diverse unicellular eukaryotes. narnaviral RNAs are non-polyadenylated and probably non-capped. the viral RdRp binds to the 3\u2032-terminal CCCC and an adjacent RNA stem-loop structure in the positive strand. this is thought to stabilize the genome and protect the 3\u2032 end from host 3\u2032 exonuclease degradation. nucleotide identity to ScNV-20S; and two TSA sequences (GGCO01105932.1 and GGCO01034162.1) from the barley plant Hordeum vulgare cluster. it is likely that the Nephila clavipes sequence derives from fungal contamination. narnaviruses may be true arthropod viruses. 298275.1, KF298276.1, KF298284.1, Zhejiang mosquito virus 3, KP642119.1 and KP642120.1 come from four different studies and five different Culicinae mosquito species. in several samples, viral RNA accounts for >0.1 per cent (in one case, >2%) of total non-ribosomal RNA reads, which may be unlikely if the virus is infecting a contaminant. the rORF occurs exclusively in the R0 frame relative to the RdRp ORF. large sections of the latter exhibit a specific exclusion of the three codons CUA, UUA, and UCA. this indicates that selection against these codons is not due to an inability for these codons to be decoded by the host translational machinery. the presence of the long rORF in highly divergent alphanarnaviruses cannot be explained as an artefact of RdRp ORF codon usage or GC bias. the authors identified statistically significantly long negative-strand stop-codon-free regions overlapping positive-strand ORFs in RNA virus sequences that are statistically significantly longer than expected by chance. 5\u2032-Distal ORFs on positive-sense transcripts are often translated via ribosomal frameshifting or stop codon readthrough. but that still requires 5\u2032-proximal initiation in the pre-frameshift/pre-readthrough ORF. splicing is unknown in (+)ssRNA viruses. the alphanarnavirus rORF is currently the only plausible candidate for a negative-strand coding ORF in (+)ssRNA viruses. the replication of most (+)ssRNA viruses is membrane-associated. the replication of most (+)ssRNA viruses is membrane-associated. narnavirus replication is quite atypical among eukaryote-infecting (+)ssRNA viruses. this may explain why they\u2014possibly uniquely\u2014appear to have evolved negative-strand coding capacity. each newly synthesized RNA is released before a new round of replication commences. the rORF is present in many but not all alphanarnaviruses. the distribution of the rORF does not appear to be monophyletic. it may have evolved multiple times, or it may have been present ancestrally and lost from some lineages. negative strands of most (+)ssRNA viruses are normally expected to be occluded in membranous compartments. it is not inconceivable that some (+)ssRNA viruses might have evolved mechanisms to allow some negative strands access to the translational machinery even at late timepoints. the alphanarnavirus rORFs are exceedingly long compared to most known overlapping genes. the study is not only of interest to the evolution and molecular biology of viruses, but also of broad relevance to understanding the evolution of overlapping genes and the de novo origin of genes. nomy ID was set to 'Arthropoda' and the 'expect' threshold and word size were set to 0.1 and 6 respectively. match regions were downloaded, translated, and reciprocally queried against the NCBI nr/nt database with tblastn. all other parameters were set as defaults. RNA structures in the genomic terminal regions were predicted by scanning full-length narnaviral genomes with RNALfold (version 2.4.9) sequences in which the longest stop codon-free region occupied at least 90 per cent of the genomic sequence were assigned to the former group. a codon-based multiple sequence alignment of RdRp ORFs was produced by aligning the RdRp amino acid sequences with MUSCLE (version 3.8.31) the principal components were calculated using the RefSeq sequences of cellular organisms. narnaviral codon abundances were projected onto the resulting principal component space."}
