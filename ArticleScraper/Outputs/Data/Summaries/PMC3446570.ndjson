{"summary": "gammaherpesvirus is the causative agent of three human malignancies. virions tend to yield titers that are often less than 10E5/ml (1). rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV), which favor lytic rather than latent infection in culture, often serve as a model system. a family of serine-threonine kinases are central to cell signaling pathways. these pathways integrate signals from the extracellular environment into biological responses within the cell. a cascade of sequential phosphorylation events, including those involving the MAP kinase kinases (MAPKK; e.g., MEK), leads to the activation of substrates such as transcription factors. studies have shown that ERK1 cannot compensate for ERK2 (77) both in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that the loss of ERK1 resulted in improved functions or a gain-of-function phenotype. many viruses exploit the MAPK pathways to promote their own survival by activating both the cellular and viral genes necessary for productive infection. supernatants were harvested at 5 days postinfection (p.i.) supernatants were cleared of cellular debris by low-speed centrifugation. pellet was resuspended overnight at 4\u00b0C in a final volume of 1.0 ml of TNE (20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 100 mM EDTA) anti-RRV ORF65 (SCIP) (1:2,500) was raised in mice in the Lymphocyte Culture Center at the University of Virginia. the MEK inhibitor U0126 (1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-aminophenylthio] butadiene was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. on-TARGETplus SMARTpool siERK1, siERK2, and siGENOME nontargeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) 5 (siRNA negative control) were purchased from Thermo-Scientific. proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. membranes bound to primary Abs were incubated with secondary antibodies (45 min, room temperature) for semiquantitative enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) immunoblotting, membranes bound to primary Abs were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) (1:5,000 to 1:10,000) and Western Lightning chemiluminescent reagent (Perkin-Elmer) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. the normalized values for ORF45 and SCIP determined under each set of conditions were then compared to those determined for the control. each band was quantified using the Odyssey infrared imaging system and software. ERK1 and ERK2 siRNA SMARTpools were transfected using lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) at concentrations between 10 and 25 nM per the manufacturer's protocol. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were infected at an MOI of 5 (unless noted otherwise otherwise) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. precleared supernatant from each siRNA condition was serially diluted (5-fold) and applied to cells for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. overlay media containing methylcellulose (0.6%) were added to plates containing the viral inoculum. cells were stained with crystal violet for 10 min at room temperature. pERK2 data in the control samples was set to a value o f1 and expressed all other pERK1 and pERK2 values relative to this control value. the level of expression of each of these viral proteins in the control was set to 1. all values in the experimental samples were compared to those of their respective controls. quantification was based on serial dilution of a plasmid bearing the ORF45 coding sequence, pCMV-Tag2A-R45. nuclei were treated with PK and DNA extracted as described above. the standard curve was based on serial dilution of an ORF45 plasmid. specific viral transcripts for ORF25, ORF37, and ORF50 were detected using previously designed primer sets (14) results were normalized to GAPDH mRNA, using the primers described above, on sister aliquots of the cDNA. the reagent was removed and the gel pieces dehydrated in 100 l of acetonitrile. the pieces were dehydrated in 100 l of acetonitrile, the acetonitrile removed, and the pieces completely dried by vacuum centrifugation. the sample was digested overnight at 37\u00b0C. the nanospray ion source was operated at 2.8 kV. it obtained full-scan mass spectra to determine peptide molecular weights and product ion spectra to determine amino acid sequences in sequential scans. not all CAD spectra are derived from peptides. supernatants were harvested at 5 days postinfection (p.i.) supernatants were cleared of cellular debris by low-speed centrifugation. pellet was resuspended overnight at 4\u00b0C in final volume of 1.0 ml of TNE (20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) anti-RRV ORF65 (SCIP) (1:2,500) was raised in mice in the Lymphocyte Culture Center at the University of Virginia. phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK) (1:10,000) antibody was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. cells were lysed with whole-cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.3], 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 1 mM sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), 40 mM -glycerophosphate, 30 mM sodium fluoride, and 1 protease inhibitor cocktail. quantitative immunoblotting was employed and entailed incubating membranes with Infrared Dye 800-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit and Infrared Dye 680-conjugated anti-mouse diluted 1:10,000 in TBS-Tween (0.05%) images were scanned and analyzed using an Odyssey infrared imaging system and 3.0 software. infected whole-cell lysates were diluted in a 2-fold series. proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were then incubated with primary antibodies. each band was quantified using the Odyssey infrared imaging system. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were infected at an MOI of 5 (unless noted otherwise) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Residual virus was removed by two sequential phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) washes at room temperature, followed by the addition of fresh media. cells were harvested 48 h p.i. for immunoblot analysis. ared supernatant from each siRNA condition was serially diluted (5-fold) and applied to cells for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. overlay media containing methylcellulose (0.6%) were added to plates containing the viral inoculum. plates were incubated for 5 days at 37\u00b0C and cells were stained with crystal violet for 10 min at room temperature. samples were treated with 5 U DNase I (Stratagene) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. samples were then treated with 0.11 mg/ml PK (Sigma-Aldrich) at 55\u00b0C overnight. DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol along with 1 g of glycogen carrier. d bearing the ORF45 coding sequence, pCMV-Tag2A-R45. nuclei were treated with PK and DNA extracted as described above. the standard curve was based on serial dilutions of an ORF45 plasmid. statistically significant differences between conditions were determined using an unpaired Student's t test. all calculations were performed using an unpaired Student's t test. 30 l of 50 mM iodoacetamide in 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate at room temperature for 0.5 h. the pieces were dehydrated in 100 l of acetonitrile, the acetonitrile removed. any excess enzyme solution was removed and 20 l of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate added. peptide molecular weights and product ion spectra produce approximately 6,000 collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) spectra of ions. not all CAD spectra are derived from peptides. previous proteomic analyses of other herpesviruses have not reported the presence of such signaling molecules within mature gammaherpesvirus virions. however, this approach failed to detect evidence of ERK1 within the virions. to confirm the MS data, we separated the virion-associated proteins of gradient-purified RRV by SDS-PAGE and performed immunoblot analyses. we stripped the blot and reprobed with a monospecific antibody to ERK2. the virions contained only a trace amount of the slower-migrating species. the ERK2 bias within virions resulted from preferential incorporation of one isoform over the other. we analyzed the blots for the two ERK isoforms along with MCP, ORF45, and SCIP. uninfected cells had approximately equal levels of ERK2 and ERK1 than ERK1. uninfected cells contained only minimal levels of pERK2. infected cells showed a relative paucity of pERK1. exposure to UV-inactivated RRV led to rapid but transient rise in intracellular pERK2. phosphatase treatment eliminated the ability of the pERK-specific antibody to recognize the ERK2 species in the immunoblots. this treatment failed to reverse the shifts, suggesting that ERK2 species within the infected RhF and virions also underwent one or more additional posttranslational modifications. however, together, these data indicated that RRV infection led to activation of pERK2 and the preferential incorporation of this isoform during viral assembly. virions subjected to different combinations of proteolytic as well as detergent treatments. each viral capsid contains 955 molecules of MCP (20, 49, 51) we then quantified MCP in each sample to normalize for particle number in parallel to determining the relative abundance of pERK2 under each condition. however, untreated RRV particles predominantly contained pERK2. this signal persisted even after treatment with proteinase K (PK) if pERK2 were in the nucleus, the nuclear-derived particles would lack pERK2. another known tegument protein encoded by ORF52 was also absent in the nuclear capsids. ERK activation is important in lytic viral gene expression. previous studies have shown that activation of the MEK pathway is critical for the production of other herpesviruses. lysates from infected cells pretreated with vehicle showed only trace amounts of ERK activation. however, in lysates from RRV-infected cells in the presence of U0126, little to no ERK activation was evident. however, in lysates from RRV-infected cells in the presence of U0126, little to no ERK activation was evident. representative phase-contrast images of RhF that were uninfected (panel i) or infected with RRV (MOI of 5) and either pretreated with vehicle (panel ii) or U0126 (panel iii) the columns represent the means SEM of the results of three independent experiments. qPCR used qPCR to determine viral genome copy numbers in supernatants of infected cells treated with or without U0126. the viral genome copy number was significantly lower (30-fold; P = 0.0001) in cells treated with or without U0126 compared to those treated with the DMSO control. we treated infected cells simultaneously with U0126 and a viral DNA polymerase inhibitor, phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), which blocks viral DNA replication. the decrease in levels of all lytic transcripts was even greater in the presence of PAA. we used a nontargeting siRNA as a control (siCNL) to establish the levels of ERK1 and ERK2 during RRV infection. in nearly all experiments, the steady-state levels of ERK2 were slightly higher than those of ERK1 in infected cells treated with or without siRNA. differential suppression of ERK1 and ERK2 isoforms only minimally affects intracellular viral protein production. the results were consistent with the possibility that ERK1 and ERK2 have functionally distinct roles. data represent means SEM of the results of the same four experiments described for panel B. with siERK1 plus siERK2, the P value for ORF45 was 0.0064. the other levels were not statistically different from control values. in controls, we consistently detected more pERK2 than pERK1. the average amount of remaining pERK1 was only 11% of control levels. residual pools of pERK2 remained at 35% of control levels. ERK1 acts as a negative regulator of viral production. knockdown of expression of ERK1, ERK2, or both during RRV infection led to only minor changes in intracellular viral protein levels. ERK1 acts as a negative regulator of viral production. we harvested viral particles from the media of the siRNA experiments shown in Fig. 5. we loaded particles derived from equivalent volumes of media and then separated the proteins in each sample by SDS-PAGE. we quantified the changes in protein levels from all other conditions relative to these controls. ERK1 knockdown of cellular ERK1 markedly increases levels of virions released into the media. equal volumes of media from the siERK experiments were harvested and cleared of cells and debris. each condition appeared grossly similar to those in control samples. the approximate stoichiometries of the tegument protein ORF45 and the capsid protein SCIP within the particles were similar regardless of the specific siERK condition. however, it was unclear whether the intracellular ERK manipulations would lead to qualitative or quantitative disturbances in the incorporation of ERK in released virions. a new tab Intravirion ERK content reflects intracellular expression of ERK isoforms. with siRNA1, the P value for ERK2 was 0.0262; with siERK2, the P value for ERK2 was 0.0001; and with siERK1 plus siERK2, the P value for ERK2 was 0.0001. columns without asterisks indicate the lack of statistically significance difference compared to their respective controls. virions from siERK1-treated cells contained only trace amounts of pERK1. the complementary knockdown with siERK2 led to released virions with 85% less pERK2 than in controls. however, the amount of pERK1 in these virions was essentially unchanged. we first determined the viral titer of the media from the infected RhF following knockdown of ERK1, ERK2 or both. we compared these conditions to the control (Fig. 9A, columns 1 and 2). titers in the media of RRV-infected RhF treated with the indicated siRNA were determined in duplicate. for each experiment, relative titers were calculated by dividing the titer determined under each condition by the titer in the corresponding siCNL. each column represents the mean SEM of the results of 3 independent experiments. a quantitative immunoblot of virions correlates well with particle number. the titers and corresponding MCP immunoblot signals represent parallel analyses of sister aliquots in each experiment. for each experiment, we divided the absolute titer under each condition by its corresponding MCP value and compared each to the control. virions contained a disproportionate amount of ERK2 and pERK2. the ratios of ERK2 to ERK1 and pERK2 to pERK1 were 1.81 0.26 and 2.61 0.38 respectively. however, the corresponding ratios were consistently and markedly higher in virions. the results are shown graphically on a log10 scale. the brackets and asterisks above each pair indicate the level of statistical significance of the results of comparisons of virion and cellular ratios. the total ERK2 bias, however, was no longer evident following the ERK2 or dual knockdown in the cell. virions continued to display a strong incorporation bias for pERK2 in preference to pERK1 even in the setting of low relative abundance of intracellular pERK2 (siERK2) the ratio of pERK2 to pERK1 was 1.40 0.34 in virions but only 0.36 0.14 in cells. the difference did not reach statistical significance (9.99 4.12 and 4.61 0.88 for virions and cell, respectively) RRV-associated ERK2 may simply arise from elevated intracellular concentrations of this signaling molecule during RRV assembly. MS and MS/MS analyses of sucrose gradient-purified RRV particles identified multiple tryptic peptides (shaded) that mapped to ERK2. to confirm the MS data, we separated the virion-associated proteins of gradient-purified RRV by SDS-PAGE. we performed immunoblot analyses using a quantitative, nonenzymatic infrared detection system. the results showed that all three structural proteins were evident in the particle, along with a relative abundance of the slower-migrating species. ERK1, ERK2, and Ran (the cellular loading control) were all present in both the infected and uninfected cell lysates. uninfected cells had approximately equal levels of ERK2 and ERK1. infected cells had slightly more ERK2 than ERK1. exposure to UV-inactivated RRV led to a rapid but transient rise in the level of intracellular pERK2 that returned to baseline by 2 to 4 h. the levels of pERK1 in infected cells were only minimally higher than in uninfected controls. the ability of the pERK-specific antibody to recognize the ERK2 species in the immunoblots showed that this treatment failed to reverse the shifts. however, together, these data indicated that RRV infection led to activation of ERK2 and the preferential incorporation of this isoform during viral assembly. however, in contrast to our findings with pERK2, we were unable to detect pp38 within the virion. untreated RRV particles predominantly contained pERK2 (Fig. 2, lane 1). this signal persisted even after treatment with proteinase K (PK), which removes proteins that adhere nonspecifically to the virion surface. this signal persisted even after treatment with proteinase K (PK) this paper is the first to report the incorporation of ERK in a herpesvirus particle. previous studies have shown that activation of the MEK/ERK pathway is critical for the production of other herpesviruses. blocking ERK activation with either pharmacological or molecular inhibition of MEK (e.g., siRNA or dominant-negative constructs) completely abrogated virus production. in lysates from infected cells pretreated with vehicle, all three viral proteins were present and ERK was expressed and activated (pERK) however, in lysates from RRV-infected cells in the presence of U0126, little to no ERK activation was evident. these cells showed only a trace amount of MCP and no evidence of the other viral proteins on the immunoblot. representative phase-contrast images of RhF that were uninfected (panel i) or infected with RRV (MOI of 5) and either pretreated with vehicle (panel ii) or U0126 (panel iii) the columns represent the means SEM of the results of three independent experiments. the viral genome copy number was significantly lower (30-fold; P = 0.0001) in infected cells treated with or without U0126 compared to those treated with the DMSO control. we also used qPCR to determine viral genome copy numbers in the supernatants of infected cells treated with or without U0126. the decrease in levels of all lytic transcripts was even greater in the presence of PAA. RRV depends on the activation of ERK activation for immediate early gene expression. expression of lytic RRV genes but not episome delivery to the nucleus is dependent on ERK activation. we used a nontargeting siRNA as a control (siCNL) to establish the levels of ERK1 and ERK2 during RRV infection and virion production. in nearly all experiments, the steady-state levels of ERK2 were slightly higher than those of ERK1 in infected cells treated with or without siRNA. differential suppression of ERK1 and ERK2 isoforms only minimally affects intracellular viral protein production. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were infected with RRV. immunoblots of cell lysates were probed for total ERK (upper panel) as well as Ran to normalize for loading differences (lower panel) results of the same four experiments described for panel B. with siERK1 plus siERK2, the P value for ORF45 was 0.0064. the other levels were not statistically different from control values. we predicted knockdown of one or both of the ERK isoforms would downregulate intracellular levels of structural viral proteins. in controls, we consistently detected more pERK2 than pERK1. the average amount of remaining pERK1 was only 11% of control levels. residual pools of pERK2 remained at 35% of control levels. pERK1 and pERK2 remain following the siRNA knockdown of ERK isoforms. columns lacking asterisks did not reach a statistically significant difference compared to corresponding control values. derived from equivalent volumes of media and then separated the proteins in each sample by SDS-PAGE. we quantified the changes in protein levels from all other conditions relative to these controls. cells treated with siERK1 gave rise to markedly higher levels of viral particles. levels of virions released into the media were compared to control values. lowering intracellular levels of ERK2 as well as ERK1 dampened the overproduction of particles evident with ERK1 knockdown alone. however, lowering intracellular levels of ERK2 as well as ERK1 greatly dampened the overproduction of particles evident with ERK1 knockdown alone. the approximate stoichiometries of the tegument protein ORF45 and the capsid protein SCIP within the particles were similar regardless of the specific siERK condition. it was unclear whether the intracellular ERK manipulations would lead to qualitative or quantitative disturbances in the incorporation of ERK in released virions. RRV-infected cells treated with siRNA and probed with anti-total ERK antibody were normalized to MCP for each siRNA condition. relative values were determined using quantitative immunoblot analysis. with siERK1, the P value for ERK2 was 0.0262; with siERK2, the P value for ERK2 was 0.0001; and with siERK1 plus siERK2, the P value for ERK2 was 0.0001. virions from siERK1-treated cells contained only trace amounts of pERK1 but amounts of pERK2 approximately equivalent to those seen with controls. the complementary knockdown with siERK2 led to released virions with 85% less pERK2 than in controls. the viral titer of the media from the infected ERK1 knockdown condition was significantly greater, with an increase of 12.9-fold 5.0-fold relative to controls. the differences in intravirion ERK content did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 9A, columns 3 and 4). relative titers were calculated by dividing the titer determined under each condition by the titer in the corresponding siCNL. with siERK1, the P value for the difference in titer was 0.01. in separate experiments, we compared titers to viral genome equivalents in the media from each siRNA condition. the titers and corresponding MCP immunoblot signals represented parallel analyses of sister aliquots in each experiment. for each experiment, we divided the absolute titer under each condition by its corresponding MCP value. for each experiment, we divided the absolute titer under each condition by its corresponding MCP value. virions contained a disproportionate amount of ERK2 and pERK2. the ratios of ERK2 to ERK1 and pERK2 to pERK1 were 1.81 0.26 and 2.61 0.38. however, the corresponding ratios were consistently and markedly higher in virions. pERK2 to ERK1 (upper panel) and pERK2 to pERK1 (lower panel) in cells and virions. the results are shown graphically on a log10 scale. the ratios differed by nearly 2 orders of magnitude. the ratio of pERK2 to pERK1 was 1.40 0.34 in virions but only 0.36 0.14 in cells. this trend continued for ratios of pERK2 to pERK1 in the virions from the double knockdown, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. de novo RRV infection activates ERK (and particularly ERK2) and activation of this pathway is necessary for RRV lytic protein and viral production. high levels of pERK2 at times late in lytic infection could drive its incorporation passively into virions. levels of pERK2 in the cell remained at 35% to 50% of control values even with up to 90% knockdown of total ERK2. RRV infection drives MEK to phosphorylate and, thus, activate a greater proportion of the residual ERK2. pERK2 at 40% to 50% of the control levels is limiting in the absence of the normally inhibitory effects of ERK1. the virions contain approximately 3-fold more pERK2 than pERK1. we also detected an ERK2 incorporation bias using the less-specific antibody that detects total (not just activated) ERK2. this suggests that the mechanism of incorporation likely targets pERK2 and not total ERK2. rTA (ORF50) is less abundant than the faster-migrating isoform during lytic induction (5). HCMV particles incorporate only the phosphorylated form of UL69 (73). the mechanism mediating the pERK2 incorporation bias remains unclear. RRV ORF45-RSK-ERK2 triplex may also form in de novo RRV infection. current studies are aimed at verifying direct interaction between RRV ORF45 and RSK in infected cells or the particle. pERK2 could target adjacent viral or cellular proteins. ERK2 phosphorylates p6gag, a viral protein that functions in virion release. a more recent paper by Gupta et al. also showed that ERK2 is present in HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus particles. virions with low absolute amounts of pERK2 may lead to less-robust infections, i.e., lower infectivity per particle. titers of virions harvested under siERK1-plus-siERK2 were statistically indistinguishable from those of control virions. pERK2 equivalent to those seen with control virions but with lower levels of ERK1 were the most infectious on a per-particle basis. ERK1 knockdown may lead to subtler changes in the protein content or structure of the virions that contribute to infectivity. ERK1 knockdown led to marked virion overproduction and release into the media. a growing body of literature suggests that ERK1 may have an inhibitory effect on ERK2 signaling. the downstream targets of pERK2 could also include upregulation of viral and cellular genes involved in egress and release. ERK1 plays a negative regulatory role in RRV production. ERK1 negatively regulates RRV production, whereas activation of ERK promotes and is critical for viral gene expression. the results point to separate and distinct functions for ERK1 and ERK2 in RRV infection. we anticipate that RRV is not unique in this regard and that other viruses, including KSHV, may likewise exploit the functional differences between these two ERK isoforms to optimally modulate infection in host cells. the antibody to total ERK would be unable to reveal any differences in pERK1 and pERK2 content, thereby masking the pERK2 incorporation bias. both the Ganem and Yuan laboratories have demonstrated that KSHV incorporates only a small subset rather than a random sampling of the viral and cellular proteins present in the producer cell lines. cell lines have indicated that the KSHV ORF45 protein interacts with both pRSK and pERK, forming a triplex that protects the two phosphoproteins from host phosphatases. the triplex protects the two phosphoproteins from host phosphatases, such as negative regulators of the ERK pathway PP2A and MKP-1 and -3 (7, 78) pERK2 resides within the tegument, but membrane fusion-mediated viral entry likely results in immediate release of pERK2 into the cell. it could begin to modulate the host cell environment even before the capsid delivers the viral genome to the nucleus. if true, it would predict that lowering the levels of intravirion pERK2 would disrupt the early stages of infection. virions containing pERK2 equivalent to those seen with control virions but with lower levels of ERK1 were the most infectious on a per-particle basis. titers of virions harvested under siERK1-plus-siERK2 were statistically indistinguishable from those of control virions. ERK1 knockdown may lead to subtler changes in the protein content or structure of the virions that contribute to infectivity. ERK1 knockdown by itself led to marked virion overproduction and release into the media, identifying this isoform as a negative regulator. ERK1 knockdown in RRV-infected RhF leads to a modest increase in ERK2 activation. ERK1 knockdown in RRV-infected mice leads to a modest increase in ERK2 activation. this could also contribute to the marked overproduction of a virus. a slow rise in ERK1 levels over the course of productive infection might serve to orchestrate optimal viral production and release. low ERK1 levels in the earliest stages of productive infection would favor robust lytic viral gene transcription. rising ERK1 levels during later stages may dampen this transcription in favor of virion assembly and release."}
