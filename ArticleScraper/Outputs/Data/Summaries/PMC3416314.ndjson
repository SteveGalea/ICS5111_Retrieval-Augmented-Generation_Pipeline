{"summary": "eIF2 prevents recycling of GDP-bound eIF2 into its active GTP-bound form, thereby globally inhibiting protein synthesis. viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is necessary to mediate PKR dimerization and activation. eIF2 shuts down translation and viral protein production. sensorsy neuronal cells originating from rat dorsal root ganglion neurons were a kind gift from A. H\u00f6ke. the cells were grown in neurobasal medium supplemented with 1.1% glucose (20%), 0.27% l-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2% B-27, and 0.1% blasticidin (7). thapsigargin induces eIF2 phosphorylation by activating the pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum PERK protein kinase (26) cells were treated with 1 M thapsigargin (Invitrogen) for 1 h. monolayers of cells pretreated with thapsigargin (1 M for 1 h) were inoculated with PRV strain Becker. subconfluent 50B11 cells were transfected with an IE180-expressing plasmid (21) or an eGFP-expressing plasmid (pTrip) medium was renewed 4 h posttransfection. sensorsy neuronal cells originating from rat dorsal root ganglion neurons were a kind gift from A. H\u00f6ke. the cells were grown in neurobasal medium supplemented with 1.1% glucose (20%), 0.27% l-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2% B-27, and 0.1% blasticidin (7). horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. goat anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Dako Cytomation. cells were treated with 1 M thapsigargin for 1 h. monolayers of cells were inoculated with thapsigargin (1 M for 1 h) for immunoblotting at 4 hpi. subconfluent 50B11 cells were transfected with an IE180-expressing plasmid (21) or an eGFP-expressing plasmid (pTrip), according to the manufacturer's protocol. thapsigargin induces eIF2 phosphorylation by activating the pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum PERK protein kinase (26). differentiated 50B11 cells were pretreated or not with thapsigargin (1 M) for 1 h prior to inoculation with PRV. differentiated 50B11 cells were pretreated or not with thapsigargin (1 M) for 1 h prior to mock inoculation or inoculation with PRV. Western blot detection was performed for total and phosphorylated eIF2 and phosphorylated PERK. an immediate-early or early protein is involved in PRV-mediated suppression of eIF2 phosphorylation. an immediate-early or early protein is involved in PRV-mediated suppression of eIF2 phosphorylation. a time course experiment of PRV infection was performed to determine the time point of suppression of eIF2 phosphorylation. expression of the PRV immediate-early protein IE180 was first detected at 1 hpi. substantial expression of the early viral protein US3 was detected from 2 hpi onwards. expression of IE180 interferes with eIF2 phosphorylation. lysates were collected and Western blot detection was performed for total and phosphorylated eIF2. IE180 and US3 were included as controls for treatment. tubulin detection was included as loading control. course infection experiment showed rapid suppression of eIF2 phosphorylation in ST cells, within 2 hpi, similar to what was observed in 50B11 cells. transfection of IE180 in ST cells resulted in substantial interference with eIF2 phosphorylation that corresponded well with the 30% transfection efficiency. t detection was performed for total and phosphorylated eIF2. GFP and IE180 were included as transfection controls. tubulin detection was used as loading control. protein phosphatase PP1 but not PP2 is involved in PRV-mediated suppression of eIF2 phosphorylation. cells were treated with PP1-specific inhibitor I2 (200 nM), PP2-inhibiting okadaic acid (OA, 20 nM), or a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control. IE180 and tubulin were included as controls. differentiated 50B11 cells were pretreated or not with thapsigargin. thapsigargin induces eIF2 phosphorylation by activating the pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum PERK protein kinase. Lysates were collected at 4 hpi, and Western blotting was performed for total and phosphorylated eIF2. PRV effectively counteracted phosphorylation of eIF2 in thapsigargin-stimulated cells. PRV also reduced basal levels of eIF2 phosphorylation in nonstimulated cells. an immediate-early or early protein is involved in PRV-mediated interference with eIF2 phosphorylation in PRV-infected cells. thapsigargin-stimulated cells either were treated with cycloheximide (CHX), a translation inhibitor, before and during virus inoculation. ximide (10 g/l) (B) or PAA (250 g/ml) (C) prior to inoculation with PRV (MOI, 1). Lysates were collected at different time points postinoculation. Western blot detection was performed for total and phosphorylated eIF2. expression of IE180 causes suppression of eIF2 phosphorylation. phosphorylation of eIF2 is significantly reduced under these circumstances. a time course analysis of PRV-infected cells treated with CHX alone or sequentially with CHX and ActD confirmed these findings. phosphorylation of eIF2 was assessed in 50B11 cells transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector encoding either IE180 or (as a control) eGFP. expression of IE180 protein is sufficient to interfere with phosphorylation of eIF2. ST cells were transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector encoding IE180 (pIE180) or eGFP (pTrip) for 24 h. lysates were collected and Western blot detection was performed for total and phosphorylated eIF2. PRV does not encode a viral phosphatase, suggesting that a cellular phosphatase may be recruited or induced by PRV to induce dephosphorylation of eIF2. both protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) have been reported to dephosphorylate eIF2 (12) IE180 increases expression levels of PP1 or its regulatory complex partner GADD34, thereby promoting dephosphorylation of eIF2. neither PRV infection nor IE180 transfection affected PP1, PP2A or GADD34 protein levels. d-transfected (B) or mock-infected (D) cells represent data from IE180-transfected (B) or PRV-infected (D) cells. we found that an N-terminally His-tagged version of IE180 lost its ability to suppress phosphorylation of eIF2. these findings indicate that IE180 does not alter the protein expression levels of PP1 or GADD34 to initiate dephosphorylation of eIF2. IE63-mediated dephosphorylation of eIF2 is unknown. the only immediate-early protein encoded by PRV, IE180, interferes with phosphorylation of eIF2. IE180 acts as a transcriptional transactivator to control the expression of different genes. IE180 did not affect protein expression levels of either PP1 or its regulatory complex partner GADD34. we found that an N-terminally His-tagged version of IE180 that retains transcriptional transactivating activity lost its ability to suppress phosphorylation of eIF2. this may point toward an interaction of IE180 with components that mediate PP1-dependent dephosphorylation of eIF2."}
