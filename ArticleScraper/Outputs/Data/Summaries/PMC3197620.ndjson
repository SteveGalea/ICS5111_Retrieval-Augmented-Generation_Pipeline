{"summary": "chikungunya virus is a member of the genus Alphavirus, which are enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses transmitted by mosquitoes. it was first isolated in Tanzania in 1952, and reported to cause severe fever as well as myalgia, joint pain and rash within 2\u20135 days of infection. in 2006, an outbreak on the island of La R\u00e9union resulted in the infection of approximately one-third of the inhabitants. neonatal mice succumb to RRV [11], Semliki Forest Virus [12], Sindbis Virus (SINV) as well as CHIKV [13]\u2013[15]. there are likely several factors that contribute to this increased sensitivity in neonates. ISG15 is a 17 kDa protein that contains two ubiquitin-like domains connected by a proline peptide linker [23] similar to ubiquitin, ISG15 can form conjugates with an array of intracellular host and viral proteins. conjugation of ISG15 to target proteins has been suggested to cause a gain or loss of function of the targeted protein. ISG15 is induced during CHIKV infection and plays a critical role in protecting neonatal mice from viral induced lethality. the mechanism of action by which ISG15 limits infection is independent of UbE1L mediated conjugation. lactic measures targeting the induction of IFN and ISG15 may help protect neonates during future CHIKV outbreaks. results CHIKV infected infants produce high levels of IFN and IFN-induced chemokines/cytokines. levels of pyrogenic cytokines IL-1 and TNF were not significantly elevated in patients when compared to their controls. only IL-6 was slightly upregulated in adult patient as compared to the control group. however, there was no clear skewing toward a Th1 response. IFN data from adult patients were previously reported [20] but are shown here for comparison to data from infected neonates. the viral load is higher in infants, possibly accounting for greater immune activation. in adults, there was also an age-dependent trend with elderly harboring higher viral loads. CHIKV infection in neonatal mice results in a robust type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokine response that is critical in controlling infection. infection of 6 day old animals resulted in 100% mortality; 9 day old animals developed paralysis, with approximately 50% of the animals succumbing to. mice were inoculated with 2105 PFU of CHIKV. increased expression of IFN mRNA could be detected as early as 3 hrs post-infection. increased expression of IFN mRNA could also be detected as early as 3 hrs post-infection. sera was harvested and tested for (B) IFN by ELISA and IFN using Luminex. each graph represents 2\u20133 independent experiments with 3 mice per experiment. we then assessed the systemic inflammatory response in this model. neonatal pups lacking subunit 1 of the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR/) were highly susceptible to CHIKV infection. the pups developed a rapid, disseminated infection. within 1 day of infection, the IFNAR/ mice displayed viral loads 100-fold higher than that detected in WT controls. neonates possess a developmental delay in their IFN-response that makes them susceptible to infection as compared to adult animals. it was therefore important to determine whether prophylactic innate immune responses could protect neonatal animals from CHIKV infection. IFNAR/ mice (8 days of age) were injected with 25 g of pIC and 24 hours later mice were infected with CHIKV s.c. survival was monitored daily for four weeks and displayed as Kaplan-Meier survival curves. IFNAR/ pups infected with CHIKV did not induce detectable levels of ISG15. a dramatic increase in lethality was observed in neonatal mice lacking ISG15. more than 70% of the mice succumbing to infection within 3 days. survival was monitored daily for 21 days and displayed as Kaplan-Meier survival curves. it has been previously shown that WT mice become resistant to CHIKV induced lethality between 9 to 12 days of age. by 11 days of age the WT mice had become largely resistant to CHIKV induced lethality with only 15% of the mice succumbing to infection. pretreatment with pIC offered protection to both WT and ISG15/ mice. 14% of the ISG15/ mice still succumbed to infection as compared to 85% protection observed in the WT mice. skin/muscle from the site of infection was used to confirm that UbE1L/ mice generated no ISG15 conjugates during CHIKV infection. additional organs (lung and liver) were also examined and no conjugates were detected in UbE1L/ mice. thus, we demonstrate that the activity of ISG15 during CHIKV infection is UbE1L independent. we examined lymphocyte subsets and viral titers in nave neonatal WT, UbE1L/ and ISG15/ mice. no significant differences in lymphocyte subsets of nave neonatal WT, UbE1L/ and ISG15/ mice. ISG15/ and UbE1L/ mice display similar viral loads to WT mice. despite similar viral loads and type I IFN induction, the ISG15/ mice displayed elevated levels of TNF, IL-1 and IL-6 as compared to the WT. ISG15/ mice showed elevated cytokine levels during CHIKV infection. ISG15/ mice also showed elevated chemokine levels. CHIKV infected infants produce high levels of IFN and IFN-induced chemokines/cytokines. patients were recruited at the time of presentation in the emergency room. all patients were negative for anti-CHIKV IgG and IgM. NF were not significantly elevated in patients when compared to their controls. only IL-6 was slightly upregulated in adult patient as compared to the control group. this suggests infants, while developing more severe manifestations of CHIKV, mount a robust acute response. the viral load is higher in infants, possibly accounting for greater immune activation. in adults, there was also an age-dependent trend with elderly harboring higher viral loads. this is consistent with the report that increased age is a risk factor for severe CHIKV disease [44] CHIKV infection in neonatal mice results in a robust type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokine response that is critical in controlling infection. CHIKV infection in neonatal mice results in a robust type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokine response that is critical in controlling infection. mice were inoculated with 2105 PFU of CHIKV. increased expression of IFN mRNA could be detected as early as 3 hrs post-infection. increased expression of IFN mRNA could be detected as early as 3 hrs post-infection. each graph represents 2\u20133 independent experiments with 3 mice per experiment. we then assessed the systemic inflammatory response in this model. similar to our findings in human infants infected with CHIKV, we observed a strong induction of IFN and IFN. neonatal pups lacking IFNAR1 were highly susceptible to CHIKV infection. the pups developed a rapid, disseminated infection. within 1 day of infection, the IFNAR/ mice displayed viral loads that were 100-fold higher than that detected in WT controls. neonates possess a developmental delay in their IFN-response that makes them susceptible to infection as compared to adult animals. it was therefore important to determine whether prophylactic innate immune responses could protect neonatal animals from CHIKV infection. vant induced type I IFN production protects neonates from CHIKV infection. mice (8 days of age) were injected i.p. with 25 g of pIC and 24 hours later mice were infected with CHIKV s.c. survival was monitored daily for four weeks. infected with CHIKV did not induce detectable levels of ISG15. we infected ISG15/ neonatal mice, comparing them to weight and age-matched control animals. survival was monitored daily for 21 days and displayed as. mice from all three genotypes that were pretreated with 25 g of pIC showed no lethality. it has been previously shown that WT mice become resistant to CHIKV induced lethality between 9 to 12 days of age, while mice lacking IFNAR1 remain susceptible to infection even as adults. by 11 days of age the mice had become largely resistant to CHIKV induced lethality with only 15% of the mice succumbing to infection. pretreatment with 10\u201325 g of pIC offered protection to both WT and ISG15/ mice. 14% of the ISG15/ mice still succumbed to infection as compared to 85% protection observed in the WT mice. UbE1L/ mice generated no ISG15 conjugates during CHIKV infection. recombinant CHIK viruses expressed either WT ISG15 (CHIK- LRLRGG) or a mutant, non-conjugatable form of ISG15 (CHIK- LRLRAA) both CHIK-LRLRGG and CHIK-LRLRAA expressed ISG15 and displayed similar growth kinetics to CHIK-GFP. we detected no significant differences in the lymphocyte subsets of nave neonatal WT, UbE1L/ and ISG15/ mice. similar results have been observed in both nave and pIC stimulated adult mice [39], [45]. nine day old mice were injected with 2105 PFU CHIKV s.c. Tissue and sera were collected on days 1 (A) and 2 (B) post-infection and viral titers were determined by plaque assay. three pyrogenic cytokines in the ISG15/ mice were comparable to what was observed in the IFNAR/ pups. despite the latter having significantly higher viral loads, ISG15/ neonates display an exaggerated proinflammatory cytokine response to CHIKV infection. studies have provided the first documentation of vertical transmission. they provide detailed information about the severity of disease and long term sequelae. a key finding from these studies is the increased susceptibility of neonates and infants to severe forms of CHIKV infection [10], [44], [49] neonates may have a defect in their ability to either produce and/or respond to type I IFN during CHIKV infection. the relative level of IFN produced in infants was higher than the responses observed in adult human patients. this indicates that neonates do not have a defect in their ability to produce type I IFN during CHIKV infection. the role of ISG15 has previously been shown to be important in the control of several viruses, including SINV [34]. we found that ISG15/ mice were more susceptible to CHIKV infection, demonstrating a dramatic increase in lethality as compared to WT mice. the actions of ISG15 during CHIKV infection are likely to be independent of conjugation, and mediated by free ISG15. in both the influenza and SINV models, the increase in lethality was accompanied by a dramatic increase in viral loads. however, during CHIKV infection, ISG15/ mice did not show an increased CHIKV burden. free ISG15 is found within the cell, but interestingly it may also be secreted by a still undefined mechanism. previous work has shown that unanchored ISG15 can associate non-covalently with proteins, thereby inhibiting its interaction with UbE1L and blocking conjugation of target proteins. d ISG15 could function as in immunomodulatory cytokine by signaling through a receptor to regulate the cytokine response or through its ability to function as a chemoattractant. future studies evaluating these possibilities will be required in order to further define the mechanism by which ISG15 is contributing to the host response to CHIKV. CHIKV infection was confirmed by RT-PCR. all patients were negative for anti-CHIKV IgG and IgM. data from adult patients were previously reported. recombinant viruses were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0 and viral titers were measured at various times post-infection. infection of 9 day old pups with 2105 PFU subcutaneously resulted in approximately 50\u201360% lethality in WT mice. bE1L/ and ISG15/ mice were fully backcrossed, with 99.93% and 99.72% identity to C57BL/6 mice. for neonatal experiments mice were infected between 9 and 12 days of age as indicated. serial dilutions of organ homogenates in DMEM with 1% FBS was added to BHK cells and incubated for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. plates were fixed with 1% formaldehyde (>30 min at room temperature), agar plugs were removed and plaques were visualized using a 1% crystal violet solution. mice were monitored daily for the development of symptoms and followed for lethality as described above. the 20 L reaction mix contained 2 L of extracted RNA, 7.5 L of LightCycler RNA Master Hyb-Probe, 3.25 mmol/L Mn2, 450 nmol/L CHIKV-forward primer, 150 nmol/L CHIKV-reverse primer, 150 nmol/L CHIKV Probe (5 6-carboxyfluorescein-3 TAMRA) the thermal cycling consisted of a reverse transcription at 61\u00b0C for 20 Western blot analysis Nine day old mice were infected with 2105 PFU CHIKV. Tissue homogenates as well as serum samples were subjected to protein electrophoresis on a 12% Tris gel. gel was transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and probed for ISG15 expression. false discovery rate (FDR) procedures are a permutation-based method. differences were considered significant if p0.05.
