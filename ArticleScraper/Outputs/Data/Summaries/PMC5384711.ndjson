{"summary": "adaptive and innate immune systems are linked by the interaction between antibodies and Fc receptors (FcR) expressed on a diverse population of immune effector cells. the critical role that FcR play in driving antibody activity in vivo has been identified in diverse disease settings. MM have extensively contributed to studies of the potential role of antibodies in protection from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. a pivotal study using IgG-Fc point mutants with abrogated affinity toward Fc receptors in rhesus revealed that broadly neutralizing antibodies also require the engagement of FcRs for SHIV protection. cosylated antibodies has produced mixed results. a broadly neutralizing antibody with enhanced affinity to FcRIIIa and ADCC activity in vitro did not augment protection from a vaginal SHIV challenge. treatment with a nonfucosylated antibody cocktail resulted a higher survival rate compared with a fucosylated antibody cocktail. aglycosylated hu5C8 treatment did not significantly extend renal and islet allograft acceptance like WT 10 MM possess genes orthologous to human activating receptors FcRI, FcRIIa, and FcRIIIa. aglycosylated hu5C8 treatment did not significantly extend renal and islet allograft acceptance like WT 10 MM. expression patterns of rhesus macaque effector cell FcRs have been evaluated using antibodies against human FcR with presumed cross-reactivity to NHP FcR. granulocytes express FcRIIIb while MM do not possess an FcRIIIb. granulocytes apparently do not express FcRIIIa. we characterized the affinities of human IgG subclass, glycoform and sequence-engineered variants to the major human and rhesus macaque allotypic FcR variants. to accomplish this goal, we leveraged a high-throughput surface plasmon resonance (SPR) array and affinities (KD) between species to characterize inter-species IgG-FcR cross-reactivity. human serum- and myeloma-derived IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 and myeloma-derived IgG4 is shown in Fig. 1. good agreement was generally observed between serum- and myeloma-derived IgG, with differences potentially due to variance in Fc glycosylation or IgG allotypic variation. human IgG subclasses showed weaker affinity for human FcRIIb than either human FcRIIa or rhesus FcRIIb-1. both of these effects may be due in part to rhesus FcRIIb-1 containing H131 while human FcRIIb contains R131. the affinity of each recombinant human IgG1 to both human and rhesus FcRs was measured across human and rhesus FcR allotypes. the affinity of each recombinant human IgG1 was measured across human and rhesus FcR allotypes. an evaluation was performed to compare binding affinity of a subset of previously reported IgG1 Fc variants to both human and rhesus FcRs. a panel of mutants was selected to provide a range of affinity differences (improved and reduced) across all human FcR and C1q. 67E/H268F/S324T SEHFST S267E/H268F/S324T/I332E/G236A SEHFSTIEGA I332E IE Richards et al.2 G236A GA S239D/I332E/G236A IEGA S239D/I332E/G236A SDIEGA S239D/I332E/A330L SDIES rhesus FcRIIa-2 has a polymorphism from serine to alanine at position 126 that is in close proximity to proposed contact residues on the FcR protruding C\u2019 strand ridge. the ridge makes contact with the antibody N297 residue, proximal to the S298A mutation, indicating the FcRIIa-2 S126A polymorphism may induce a conformational change. IgG variants containing the G236A mutation did not increase binding to rhesus FcRIIa as much as toward human FcRIIa. however, the affinity for the GA mutant increased approximately 3-fold for both human allotypes. the relative affinity of human FcRIIb (R131) was 7\u201310-fold greater than the rhesus FcRIIb-1 (H131) allotype for the SE/HF/ST mutant but unchanged for ST and HF/ST. the mutant had a 6-fold greater increase in relative affinity for the human R131 allotype (300-fold) compared to the human H131 allotype (50-fold) the mutation of serine to glutamic acid may have a compound effect in that it disrupts the hydrogen bonding with H131 and creates a salt bridge with human FcRII receptors containing R131.4. rhesus and human FcRIIIa allotypes displayed comparable affinities. both VRC01 and trastuzumab IgG for a subset of Fc variants are displayed as a ratio relative to wildtype to make the differences between wild type and the Fc variants more easily apparent. the change in affinity between FcRIIa/b variants was variable and inconsistent between species. correlative relationships suggest that Fc modifications are likely to have a similar effect on recognition by FcRIII for both species, but a less predictable effect on binding to FcRII. rhesus and human FcRIIa vs. human FcRIIa H131 (A), rhesus FcRIIb-1 vs. human FcRIIb (B), and rhesus FcRIIIa-3 and human FcRIII IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 and myeloma-derived IgG4 shown in Fig. 1. good agreement was generally observed between serum- and myeloma-derived IgG. differences potentially due to variance in Fc glycosylation or IgG allotypic variation. the human IgG subclasses showed weaker affinity for human FcRIIb than either human FcRIIa or rhesus FcRIIb-1. both of these effects may be due in part to rhesus FcRIIb-1 containing H131 while human FcRIIb contains R131. the affinity of each recombinant human IgG1 to both human and rhesus FcRs was measured across human and rhesus FcR allotypes. the affinity of each recombinant human IgG1 was measured across human and rhesus FcR allotypes. an evaluation was performed to compare binding affinity of a subset of these previously reported IgG1 Fc variants to both human and rhesus FcRs. fourteen Fc variants were prepared in the context of the VRC01 Fv. their equilibrium binding constants to both human and rhesus FcRs were subsequently evaluated.

RIIa R131 shows a 7\u201310-fold increase in affinity for the SE/HF/ST variant, but not the ST or HF/ST variants. there was no change in binding for any of these mutants toward the human FcRIIa H131 allotype. the SE/HF/ST/IE/GA mutant had a 6-fold greater increase in relative affinity for the human R131 allotype (300-fold) the mutation of serine to glutamic acid may have a compound effect in that it disrupts the hydrogen bonding with H131. it also creates a salt bridge with human FcRII receptors containing R131.4. rhesus and human FcRIIIa allotypes displayed comparable affinities. gG for a subset of Fc variants are displayed as a ratio relative to wildtype to make the differences between wild type and the Fc variants more easily apparent. the change in affinity between FcRIIa/b variants was variable and inconsistent between species. however, variant-specific differences were observed for several rhesus receptors. rhesus and human FcRIIa vs. human FcRIIa H131 (A), rhesus FcRIIb-1 vs. human FcRIIb (B) and rhesus FcRIIb-1 vs. human FcRIIb (B) compared binding affinities across species and allotypes for each FcR. both mutations have the potential to modulate the A/I ratio. this ratio can modulate cellular effector functions, as well as cytokine release profiles. however, there may be unanticipated changes in affinity. the only sequence difference is serine 24 in rhesus vs. arginine in cynomolgus,68. the expectation that Fc variants with enhanced human FcRIIIa affinity should translate to rhesus or cynomolgus is in accord with in vivo studies. rhesus macaque,6870 is a cRIIIb-expressing cell type in humans. rhesus neutrophils may diverge from human neutrophils in aspects of FcRIIIb-mediated cellular functions such as phagocytosis,58 NETosis,56,57 or the inhibition of FcRIIa-driven ADCC. c-optimized antibodies in human and rhesus macaque FcRs can more confidently anticipate the activity of these variants in humans. understanding of similarities and differences in NHP and human FcR biology will remain vital to designing and translating results from this key preclinical model.
