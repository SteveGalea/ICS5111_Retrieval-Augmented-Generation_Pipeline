{"summary": "the reported cases of MERS infection increased in the Middle East in may 2014. the patient contracted the disease while visiting the Arabian Peninsula. in less than two months, 186 people were infected and 38 people died. the infection of a secondary patient with no close contact with the index patient does not support the claim that MERS is spread only through close contact. a field experiment was performed to determine the infection transmission route, and the results indicated that SARS could possibly be an opportunistic airborne infection [15]. a person who infects more than five people is called a super-spreader. a person who infects more than five people is called a super-spreader. the index patient was also surveyed as a super-spreader. the air conditioner and ventilation system of each ward can be controlled individually. in the corridor, ventilation is not provided and only a ceiling-type air conditioner is installed. most patients did not recognize the ventilation devices, making it difficult to determine whether the air conditioner and ventilation system were in operation. at least one infected patient was confirmed in all east-facing wards. at least one infected case occurred in all east-facing wards. the size of the domain used in the analysis was modelled to be 420 525 180 m (figure 4) there was sufficient space between the building and analysis domain to allow the airflow to fully develop and hence obtain reliable analysis results. the wind speed at the height of 0\u2013180 m was calculated using the exponential law [32] based on the average wind speed at the height of 10 m blowing from each direction. to determine the roughness of the earth's surface, the roughness value should be selected. for indoor conditions, both the maternity and general ward departments were included in the CFD domain. the airborne infectious particles were considered gas-phase substances. the CFD analysis cases are based on the two wind directions (west, west-southwest) case 1T represents non-isothermal simulation. s Hospital is a nine-storey building completely built in february 2015. the medical department is located from the first floor to the third floor. the eighth floor is divided into a maternity ward department, which consists of a one-person ward and a general ward department. the index patient was admitted to the two-person ward (ward 8104) from 15 May to 17 May 2015, due to fever and coughing symptoms. in ward 8104, one patient using the same room and three visiting family members were infected. at least one infected case occurred in all east-facing wards. a housing area is located towards the south, a factory area towards the northeast and rice paddies towards the west and north. no high-rise buildings with over five storeys are present within 500 m. a relatively high four-storey building is located approximately 40 m to the west of the hospital. the average wind speed at the height of 10 m was 2.40 m s1 for the west wind and 2.62 m s1 for the west-southwest wind. the average wind speed at the height of 10 m was 2.40 m s1 for the west wind and the west-southwest wind. the design airflow rate was used for the supply and exhaust air vents and bathroom exhaust. the model was set to exhale 5 l of passive tracer per minute. droplets from a patient evaporate and can rapidly turn into small particles. average outdoor temperature of 17.8\u00b0C and heat generation values for patient and nurse were applied to the floor and ceiling light was applied to the ceiling for one case (caseW-1T) the maximum difference of outdoor air velocity between coarse, medium and fine meshes in range of 0\u2013180 and 0\u201330 m where building is located, were both 0.15 m s1. however, maximum difference of indoor velocity of the three meshes showed a difference. the highest positive pressure (greater than 4 Pa) was formed in the west angular part of the building. in all the cases, in the side part of the building, a negative pressure was formed and a vortex was generated making the airflow separate and reattach to the side of the building. index patient ward (8104) had the highest concentration of the passive tracer in all the cases. it is difficult to directly relate the reported infected cases with the concentration of the passive tracer in wards because the wind does not continuously blow in one direction. ward 8109, where the highest infected cases were reported, showed the highest concentration. in cases W-3 and WSW-3, the concentrations in ward 8104 were 4.90%, 45.4% lower than those of cases W-1 and WSW-1 respectively. this is because the direct airflow from the west-facing window to the corridor was disturbed by the air supplied from the supply vent. the ACH was calculated by using the concentration of the passive tracer in the ward with the passive tracer generation rate. in cases W-1, W-2 and W-3, the ACH was 21.5, 21.1 and 22.6, respectively. awning window and less air volume of air was passing through the window due to window shape and disturbed air flow from the supply vent. the wind speed profile was obtained and analysed based on the average wind speed values of the west, west-southwest and east winds. on the first day of hospitalization of the index patient (15 May 2015), the wind was mainly blowing from the west-southwest as shown in figure 11a. the passive tracer concentration in each room was analysed in terms of the door-to-door distance between wards. the passive tracer concentration in ward 8109 showed the highest concentration when the west-southwest wind was blowing, indicating that MERS would have infected other patients through the airflow. in previous studies on SARS [14,23], indoor and outdoor airflow was analysed using passive contaminant to identify the dispersion of SARS virus. the first infected patient was admitted to a hospital ward that had no supply or exhaust vents, indicating that the testing, adjusting and balancing (TAB) of the ventilation system was not properly carried out after construction. the wind data obtained for the hospitalization period of the index patient showed that the west and west-southwest winds were dominant. therefore, the air dominantly flowed in through the west and west-southwest sides of the hospital. the most reported MERS cases were also in ward 8109. all authors gave final approval for publication.
