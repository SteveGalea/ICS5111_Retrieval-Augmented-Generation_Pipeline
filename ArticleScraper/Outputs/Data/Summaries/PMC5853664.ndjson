{"summary": "pepmixes were generated from PBMCs (5 105 cells/mL) in 24-well plates by using PHA (5 g/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) all pepmixes were synthesized by JPT Peptide Technologies (Berlin, Germany) VST Activation Fifteen million fresh/frozen PBMCs were pelleted in a 15-mL tube. pulsed for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C with pepmixes at a concentration of 200 ng/peptide/15 106 PBMCs. then resuspended in VST medium supplemented with 400 U/mL interleukin 4 and 10 ng/mL interleukin 7. cultures were split when they reached a cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and pelleted. antibodies were added in saturating amounts (2\u20135 L) cells were then washed twice and analyzed. cells were incubated with 20 L of interferon (IFN-) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-) antibodies (BD) for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C in the dark. cells were then washed twice with cold PBS containing fetal bovine serum and saponin. antigen-specific activity was measured after direct stimulation (500 ng/peptide/mL) with each of the individual hMPV pepmixes (N, P, M, F, M2-1, M2-2, SH, G, and L) a total of 2 105 VSTs were stimulated using N, P, M, F, or M2-1 pepmixes (200 ng/pepmix/well) overnight. samples were washed and analyzed on a Luminex 200 (XMAP Technology) using xPonent software. VSTs were used as effectors, and target ratios were autologous PHA blasts. PHA blasts generated from PBMCs (5 105 cells/mL) in 24-well plates by using PHA (5 g/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and maintained in VST medium. pepmixes spanning antigens N, P, M, F, M2-1, M2-2, SH, G, and L. medium and cytokines were replenished on day 7. cultures were split when they reached a density of >3 106 cells/well. VSTs were harvested, counted, and used for phenotypic and functional studies. VST Activation Fifteen million fresh/frozen PBMCs were pelleted in a 15-mL tube. pulsed for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C with pepmixes at a concentration of 200 ng/peptide/15 106 PBMCs. then resuspended in VST medium supplemented with 400 U/mL interleukin 4 and 10 ng/mL interleukin 7. cultures were split when they reached a cells were stained with monoclonal antibodies to CD3, CD56, CD27, CD45RO, and CCR7 (Becton Dickinson [BD], Franklin Lakes, NJ) for staining, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO) after incubation for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C in the dark, cells were washed twice and analyzed. cells were incubated with 20 L of interferon (IFN-) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-) antibodies (BD) for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C in the dark. cells were then washed twice with cold PBS containing fetal bovine serum and saponin. cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and pelleted. antibodies were added in saturating amounts (2\u20135 L) cells were then washed twice with cold PBS containing fetal bovine serum and saponin. at least 20 000 live cells from each population were analyzed with a FACSCalibur. the data were analyzed using Kaluza flow cytometry analysis software (Beckman Coulter) PHA (1 g/mL) and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (1 g/mL) served as positive controls for VSTs and PBMCs. unstimulated cells served as a negative control. each condition was run in duplicate, and results were considered positive. effector to target ratios of 40:1, 20:1, 10:1, and 5:1 were used as effectors. autologous PHA blasts alone were used as specificity controls. percentage of specific lysis was calculated as [(experimental release spontaneous release)/(maximum release spontaneous release)] 100. hMPV-specific T-cell cytokine profile was assessed using the milliplex high Sensitivity human Cytokine Panel (Millipore, Billerica, MA) per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. a total of 2 105 VSTs were stimulated using N, P, M, F, or M2-1 pepmixes (200 ng/pepmix/well) overnight. samples were analyzed by Viracor Eurofins Diagnostics (Lee\u2019s Summit, MO) or Houston Methodist Hospital (Houston, TX) Respiratory Virus Panel Nasopharyngeal wash samples (from patients with upper respiratory tract infection) were tested for hMPV and other pathogens. this magnitude of activity was similar to that for antigens of respiratory syncytial virus, a genetically and clinically closely related family member. this magnitude of activity was similar to that for antigens of respiratory syncytial virus, a genetically and clinically closely related family member. fold-increase (SEM) 4.3 0.2 in total cell numbers (n = 29; Figure 2A) the expanded populations comprised CD3+ T cells (91.7% 1%), with a mix of cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells (29.5% 2.3%) and helper (CD4+) T cells (61.8% 2.3%; Figure 2B) results are reported as spot-forming cells (SFCs)/2 105 VSTs plated. only lines with 30 spot-forming cells (SFCs)/2 105 VSTs for a given antigen were considered positive. the top 5 immunogenic target antigens (F, N, M2-1, M, and P) are polyclonal and polyfunctional. hMPV-specific T cells are polyclonal and polyfunctional. the lines produced granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; Figure 5B; data for 14 donors are summarized in Figure 4D) the lines produced granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF); granzyme B. hMPV-specific T cells produce interferon (IFN; A) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; B) but not interleukin 6 (IL-6; C) and interleukin 10 (IL-10; D) data are for 14 donors screened. the ratio of 40:1, 18% 3% for 20:1, 18% 3.7% for 10:1, and 12% 2% for 5:1; n = 10). hMPV-specific T cells were not killed (mean percentage lysis [SEM], 6.5% 1.5% for the ratio of 20:1). hMPV-specific T cells were detected by respiratory virus panel (RVP) screening performed on a nasal wash sample. we isolated PBMCs from healthy donors, stimulated them with pepmixes spanning all 9 viral antigens. the magnitude of activity in peripheral blood was low. in 18 donors screened, we detected the following mean numbers of antigen-reactive SFCs/5 105 input PBMCs. amplification of hMPV-reactive T cells in vitro. we exposed PBMCs from 29 healthy individuals to a mastermix of the hMPV peptide libraries. the expanded populations comprised CD3+ T cells (91.7% 1%) data suggest that hMPV-specific T cells reside in the memory pool. A, Fold expansion achieved over a 9\u201311-day period, based on cell counting using trypan blue exclusion. n = 25, M2-1 and M (167 21 and 154 24, respectively; n = 23 for both), P (130 24; n = 20), L (125 21.7; n = 13), and G (62 18; n = 9). the majority of donors screened recognized 5 of the expressed antigens. IFN-\u2013 and TNF-\u2013producing CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells. specificity, as determined by production of either cytokine, was detected predominantly in the CD4+ T-cell compartment. hMPV\u2013specific T cells are polyclonal and polyfunctional. hMPV-specific T cells produce interferon (IFN; A) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; B) but not interleukin 6 (IL-6; C) and interleukin 10 (IL-10; D). data are for 14 donors screened. hMPV-specific T cells are cytolytic and kill Virus-Infected Targets. hMPV-specific T cells were specifically recognized and lysed by our expanded hMPV-specific T cells at all effector to target ratios. hMPV-specific T cells were not killed (mean percentage lysis [SEM], 6.5% 1.5% for the ratio of 20:1) hMPV remained detectable by RVP PCR until day 45 after transplantation. this patient exhibited strong T-cell activity as early as 3 weeks after transplantation. this patient exhibited strong T-cell activity as early as 3 weeks after transplantation, which declined coincident with viral clearance. human herpesvirus 6 and adenovirus [9] are antigens against which an effector T-cell response might be generated. hMPV infections can be severe and sometimes fatal [23, 34\u201336], and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin has not proven beneficial [23, 30]. hMPV-reactive T cells with a Th1-polarized effector profile can be successfully expanded to clinically relevant numbers in vitro. hMPV-reactive T cells with a Th1-polarized effector profile can be successfully expanded to clinically relevant numbers in vitro by means of manufacturing approaches compliant with good manufacturing practices. copyedited and copyedited are the sole responsibility of the authors. questions or comments should be addressed to the author."}
