{"summary": "underreporting of influenza cases in early stages poses problems in estimating pandemic severity and transmission intensity. underreporting stems from the short infectious periods of influenza infections. individuals may recover before seeking treatment from their healthcare provider or before being tracked in a surveillance system. routine influenza surveillance identified an unexpected increase in cases of an influenza-like illness in mid-April 2009. an acute respiratory illness was discovered in two children and further confirmed as a new strain of H1N1 virus. a mathematical modelling approach was adopted to help quantify the spread of infectious disease in the population. METHODS Mathematical model We adopted a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model to describe the dynamic system of the infectious disease [15]. a whole population is classified into one of four groups (\u2018compartments\u2019): susceptible [S(t); exposed [E(t); infectious [I(t)]; or recovered [R(t)]. we used ft(.) to represent a functional form of reporting rates. ft(.) is defined as (reported cases/actual cases), ft(.) = U(t)/E. the E is generated from the SEIR model. bootstrap method was implemented using SAS v. 9.2.1 software (SAS Institute Inc., USA) the date of pH1N1 seeding can be calculated as assuming an exponential growth during the early phase of the pandemic. the lengths of the latent and infectious period S were set at 16 days and 14 days, respectively [20\u201324]. the lengths of the latent and infectious period S were set at 16 days and 14 days, respectively [20\u201324]. we used a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to describe the dynamic system of the infectious disease [15]. for each time point t, a whole population is classified into one of four groups (\u2018compartments\u2019): susceptible [S(t); exposed [E(t)]; infectious [I(t)]; or recovered [R(t)]. ft(.) is defined as (reported cases/actual cases), ft(.) = U(t)/E. we then adopted the earliest times of infected cases imported from Mexico (Ti) and the daily rate of travel (mi) to particular country i. we back-calculated the exponential growth rate of the pandemic [17]: where is the exponential growth rate. the date of pH1N1 seeding can be calculated as assuming an exponential growth during the early phase of the pandemic. the lengths of the latent and infectious period S were set at 16 days and 14 days, respectively [20\u201324] in order to consider undetected cases, we tested results with a range of entry-screening sensitivities. the lengths of the latent and infectious period S were set at 16 days and 14 days, respectively. the bootstrapped 95% CI was between 028% and 069% when the estimated value of R0 was 124. the value R0 remained steady when r was >01%. only fitting the surveillance data to the epidemic model would provide unreliable findings for the estimation of the r. the entry-screening sensitivities of countries were found to be moderately sensitive to our results. if the entry-screening sensitivities were distributed uniformly between 30% and 100%, the constant r was estimated as 018% (95% CI 009\u2013031) the value was relatively lower due to a decrease in the average probability of detection. the date of seeding for pH1N1 was exponentially interpolated from the date of the first confirmed case. about 5500 Mexicans were infected by pH1N1 virus before the date of the first confirmed case in the surveillance data. inaccurate estimates overstating the risk can provide misleading information to the public and potentially raise levels of anxiety or panic. a reliable estimate can assist officials at local, national, and global levels in planning and implementing prevention and control strategies for a pandemic. the probability of having imported case from Mexico for at least one listed country was about 021 prior to 14 March 2009. this situation has similar potential issues with entry-screening sensitivities mentioned previously in the Results section. the reliability of our proposed method would depend greatly on the quantity and quality of travel surveillance available at the borders during the early stages of a potential pandemic. our approach could potentially be extended to demographic stratified models. as younger age groups were likely to be affected by pH1N1. however, sufficient data is required to support the extension."}
