{"summary": "a single-stranded positive sense RNA virus is a member of coronavirus. four structural proteins, including spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E) and nucleocapsid protein (N), constitute the virion. hnRNP A1 selectively interacts with different RNA-binding proteins. previous studies have shown that hnRNP A1 could interact with hnRNP A1 during PEDV infection. hnRNP A1 underwent different regulations in jejunum tissues of piglets infected with PEDV virulent strain. -81 cell line and HEK293T cell line were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) the rabbit anti-hnRNP A1, anti-flag polyclonal antibody (PAb) and mouse anti-actin, anti-flag mono-antibody (MAb) were purchased from ABclonal (Shanghai, China) jejunum tissues were separated rapidly, washed with ice-cold PBS buffer, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at 80 \u00b0C for subsequent proteome study. iTRAQ labeling coupled with LC-MS/MS was chose to analyze whole cell changes of jejunum of piglets, infected with PEDV YN13 strain and YN144 strain. at 12 hpi, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. fixed cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin. incubated with anti-hnRNP A1 PAb and MAb. DAPI was selected to stain the cell nucleus. cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR using the PrimescriptTM RT Master mix. PEDV YN144 (GenBank accession no. KT021232), YN13 (GenBank accession no. KT021228), and CV777 (GenBank accession no. AF353511.1) strains were obtained by passaging the YN strain, a variant strain isolated from the intestine of a piglet with diarrhea, for 13 and 144 generations. anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from AntGene Biological (Wuhan, China) the cDNA expression construct encoding YN144 N protein was PCR amplified and cloned into pCAGGS-FlagC, which encode a C-terminal flag. supernatants were incubated with mono-antibody against Flag for 12 h. then protein A/G beads were added and incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 6 h. proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting analysis. the siRNAs targeting hnRNP A1 were synthesized by Gene Pharma (Shanghai, China) at 60 hpt, cells were infected with or without PEDV. at 12 hpi or 24 hpi, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde followed by treating with methanol. membrane was incubated in blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline) for 2 h at room temperature. then the membrane was incubated with the corresponding primary antibodies for 2 h. protein bands were visualized using the ClarityTM Western ECL Blotting Substrate. analysis of hnRNP A1 expression level in the jejunum tissues of the control, YN13-infected and YN144-infected groups. -actin was used as a loading control. the MS-ratio (infection/control) obtained by MS analysis is shown on the right. at 12 hpi, the localization of PEDV N protein and hnRNP A1 in cells was examined. the nucleus is indicated by DAPI (blue) staining. PEDV N protein is indicated in green and the hnRNP A1 in red. co-immunoprecipitation was performed to testify this phenomenon. three siRNAs targeting to hnRNP A1 were synthesized to silence the expression of hnRNP A1. siRNA-1 showed the best performance for silencing hnRNP A1 and was chosen for the following research. knockdown of hnRNP A1 expression inhibits YN144 replication. at 60 hpt, cells were infected with YN144 Strain at a moi of 0.001 or mock infected (d). hnRNP A1 expression inhibits YN13 replication. at 60 hpt, cells were infected with CV777 Strain at a moi of 0.001 or mock infected (d). Virus suspensions were harvested at 24 hpi to calculate the virus titer by real-time RT-PCR. the virus copies per mL suspension was calculated (A) hnRNP A1 was down-regulated in an attenuated PEDV strain (YN144) infected jejunum tissues. no apparent change in a virulent PEDV strain (YN13) infected jejunum tissues. western blot assay was applied to confirm changes of hnRNP A1. -81 cells were infected with different PEDV strains. the localization of hnRNP A1 was observed by confocal microscopy at 12 hpi. hnRNP A1 was localized in the nucleus without PEDV infection. hnRNP A1 protein was only detected in the presence of flag tagged PEDV N by CO-IP. hek293T cells were transfected with a vector expressing PEDV N protein with a flag tag (flag-PEDV-N) or empty vectors. whole-cell lysates obtained at 24 hpt were immunoprecipitated. CCL81 cells were transfected with no siRNA (Mock), negative control siRNA (NC), SiRNA-1, SiRNA-2 or SiRNA-3 at a concentration of 20 nM. cells were collected at 60 hpt to analyze the expression of hnRNP A1 by western blot. data are shown as means the standard errors of the mean (SEM) of at least three independent experiments, with the error bars representing the standard deviations. Knockdown of hnRNP A1 expression inhibits YN13 replication. at 60 hpt, cells were infected with CV777 Strain at a moi of 0.001 or mock infected (d) the virus copies per mL suspension was calculated by real-time RT-PCR. overexpression of hnRNPA1 facilitates MHV replication. inhibition of hnRNP A1 expression results in the reduction of MHV replication. hnRNP A1 may be involved in the process of PEDV infection. YN13 caused diarrhea in piglets while YN144 could not, therefore downregulation of hnRNP A1 was one of the reasons responsible for the lower pathogenicity of YN144 than in vivo."}
