{"summary": "STEM Projects Seasonal Influenza in Israel: Variations in transmission by Strains Some of the most widely studied epidemiologic models are for influenza, both pandemic and seasonal. such models typically use a deterministic compartmental disease model, in which individuals move from susceptible, to infectious, to recovered, and once again become susceptible. in 3 weeks, influenza accounted for 90,000 visits to 220 health units and 20 hospitals in Mexico City. the mayor's response, controversial at the time, was to implement social distancing measures, closing schools on April 24 and restaurants on April 28. all were reopened by May 11. the model was extended to automatically fit a window of variable duration at any start date. the optimizer could amplify, attenuate, or leave unchanged the base transmission rate. in the window, the reduction in reproductive number (and transmission rate) was 22%. the team modeled 2 scenarios based on measles research literature. the first increased vaccination coverage by 10% for all clinics. the second focused only on the bottom 10% of the poorest performing clinics. bird-to-bird transmission coefficient was estimated to be 8 times higher than human-to-human transmission of seasonal influenza. bird-to-bird transmission coefficient was estimated to be about 8 times higher than human-to-human transmission of seasonal influenza. the team ran the model deterministically and stochastically. the accuracy of the estimates depends on the data used to calibrate the model, such as accurate population density data. in response to the outbreak in africa, the STEM community convened a weekly conference call. more than 40 scientists from more than 20 research institutes, universities, government agencies, and private companies participated. researchers used STEM42 to simulate the dynamics of EVD in the presence of the reservoir. the model shows how an asymmetry in human birth and death rates, together with the presence of an active disease reservoir, increase the potential for the disease to become endemic in a relatively small population. the model predicted the historic year-to-year malaria burden with an accuracy of 75%. the model revealed which regions are most susceptible to increase malaria burden based on climate change trends. ellosis in pigs provides an example of how to model the spread of a zoonotic pathogen (in this case Salmonella) from farm to fork. the example illustrates how to model the spread of salmonella among pigs in a barn, the contamination of meat by infected carcasses in the slaughterhouses, and the infection of humans via consumption of pork meat. the scenarios were created with the same parameters to analyze the natural progression of each of the 4 pathogens of interest. the baseline scenarios were created with the same parameters to analyze the natural progression of each of the 4 pathogens of interest. the spread of pneumonic plague is minimal and should not be a major air travel concern if an individual becomes infected. this is because of the rapid progression of pneumonic plague and the high likelihood of death, spread of the disease is highly unlikely to progress. in 3 weeks, influenza accounted for 90,000 visits to 220 health units and 20 hospitals in Mexico City. the mayor's response, controversial at the time, was to implement social distancing measures, closing schools on April 24 and restaurants on April 28. the epidemic peaked in Mexico City in slightly under 60 days from simulation start (with a single patient zero) the screen shot was taken just before 100 days at epidemic peak in Queens County (lower left time series) the project team extended the STEM model20 to include 2 additional compartments, 1 for maternal immunity and 1 for delays in antibody response after immunization. the team modeled 2 scenarios. the first increased vaccination coverage by 10% for all clinics. the second focused only on the bottom 10% of the poorest performing clinics. if human-to-human transmission is established due to virus mutation, what would be the distribution of disease transmission, and what would be appropriate response strategies for the CCDC. the team built simple compartmental SIR (susceptible-infectious-recover) models to capture the dynamics of the disease transmission between human and bird populations. a rough estimated total of infections in china is in the millions. using the same model and altering particular parameter values would allow public health agencies to make quantitative evaluations of other scenarios. the team ran the model deterministically and stochastically. results in all 3 models showed that cross immunity alone did not account for the dynamics observed in the data reported from Thailand;33 significant levels of antibody dependent enhancement were also required. further work is needed to clarify the role of seasonality and other stochastic factors such as demographics and environmental and climate changes. IBM researchers used STEM42 to simulate the dynamics of EVD in the presence of the reservoir. the model shows how an asymmetry in human birth and death rates, together with the presence of an active disease reservoir, increase the potential for the disease to become endemic in a relatively small population. the model predicted the historic year-to-year malaria burden with an accuracy of 75% for 86 countries. it revealed which regions are most susceptible to increase malaria burden based on climate change trends. the proof-of-concept STEM model \u201cSalmonellosis in pigs\u201d provides an example of how to model the spread of a zoonotic pathogen (in this case Salmonella) from farm to fork. the example illustrates how to model the spread of salmonella among pigs in a barn, the contamination of meat by infected carcasses in the slaughterhouses, and the infection of humans via consumption of contaminated pork meat. air travel is modeled in analogy to fluid flow in a hierarchical network of pipes. the project extended STEM to include case fatality and infectious mortality rates based on the data of previous outbreaks. the baseline scenarios of SARS, H1N1, Ebola, and pneumonic plague were compared against each other. the spread of pneumonic plague is minimal and should not be a major air travel concern if an individual becomes infected. infectious disease in domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and wild boars (Sus scrofa domesticus) transmission is driven by direct contact between animals or indirect contact through contaminated food and feed. transmission is driven by direct contact through contaminated food and feed (discarded meat waste), infected animal residues, and humans tracking through infected areas. research findings suggest that STEM can be used to simulate and evaluate intervention scenarios, such as targeted hunting or fencing of wild boars in outbreak areas. the national food chain safety office works with a formally constituted ASF action group made up of stakeholders and experts. ectoparasite-mediated diseases in livestock cause annual losses of millions of pounds to the industry in Great Britain60,61 and worldwide. resistance developing to some of the main parasiticides,63,64 in addition to climate change affecting the survival and seasonal dynamics of parasites. Germany, a country with traditionally high pig production, is at risk of significant economic losses. some measures such as fencing or intense hunting of wild boars are already in place to stop the spread of ASF, but their effectiveness is questionable. vaccines have yet to be developed. in 2018, 14 cases of ASF in wild boars reported in 1 internal region of the country were attributed to contaminated meat or food waste brought in by non-EU workers. the first case was found within 1 kilometer of the Ukrainian common border suggesting natural spread was the most likely source of infection. the STEM community provides web-based forums and tools to ask questions and get pointers. the user can benefit from a practically validated, free, open software framework capable of performing complex spatial analysis with high-resolution data."}
