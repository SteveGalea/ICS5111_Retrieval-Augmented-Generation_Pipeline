{"summary": "the 1918 and 1957 influenza pandemics showed increased mortality in pregnant women [1,2]. the reasons for the increased risk during pregnancy probably derive from a combination of immunological and physiological factors. the identification of a new viral subtype, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, in Mexico and the united states in April 2009. women with a diagnosis of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection had a higher risk of placental problems, antepartum haemorrhage, and antepartum complications. a case-control study was conducted that evaluated pregnant women living in So Paulo with confirmed infection of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. four cases and controls were randomly selected from those who recovered. the controls were matched by epidemiological week of admission date of the case. all pregnant women had a laboratory confirmation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 from a sample of respiratory secretions. risk for influenza infection as low (professional managers and other university and technical professionals without close contact with the population), medium (professionals in the areas of education, trade, service and administration with close contact with the population), or high and very high risk (doctors, nurses, other health professionals and support staff in the health services) 204 controls randomly selected among 525 pregnant women hospitalized with confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection notified in SINAN who recovered. 22 files were missing or did not meet the case or control requirements, resulting in 48 cases and 185 controls reviewed. age, median (IQR)b,d 24.71 (21.04\u201329.35) 24.58 (21.63\u201329.74) 0.836 Previous Pregnancyb 47 184 0.970 0 17 (36.2) 70 (38.0) 1\u20134 28 (59.6) 106 (59.6) 5 2 (4.2) 8 (4.4) Race/Colorc 41 165 White 23 (56.1) 91 (55.7) 1 Black/ Mixed /Yellow 18 (43.9) 92.7% of cases sought medical care for the influenza episode prior to hospitalization. this proportion was higher than that of the controls.
