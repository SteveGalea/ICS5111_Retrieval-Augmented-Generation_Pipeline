{"summary": "the number of probable SARS patients and of hospital staff in three job categories was obtained. the three categories included nurses (group N), nonmedical support staff (group S; healthcare assistants, ward assistants [cleaning staff], general service assistant [clerical staff]) all were full-time staff. the hospital authority and individual hospitals kept lists of infected workers who were hospital staff members. in attack rates among the 16 hospitals were tested by using Fisher-Freeman-Halton test (StatXact-4 version 4.0.1, Cytel Software Corporation, Cambridge, MA) infected staff and attack rates A total of 1,755 SARS patients were reported in Hong Kong; they were hospitalized in 16 of the 27 hospitals governed by the Hospital Authority. 2 of the 16 hospitals (hospital 2 and hospital 4, which admitted 7 and 17 SARS patients, respectively) had a zero attack rate. 3 2.64 Pooled 1,755 181 134 24 339 1.21 2.73 0.29 1.20 p value 0.001c 0.001c 0.001d 0.001c Spearman correlation coefficients 0.883*** 0.928*** 0.525* 0.914* 0.737* 0.865*** 0.390 0.686** aAll hospital workers, including all three groups (group N, nurses; group S, nonmedical support staff; and group O, other technical and medical staff three hospitals (hospitals 12, 15, and 16; Table 1). when these three hospitals were removed from the analysis, the overall attack rate was 0.54% and the mean and median of the 13 hospital attack rates were 0.48% and 0.54%, respectively. the differences in both the mean and median attack rates for the 16 hospitals by job categories were also significant. group N (Spearman r = 0.883, p 0.001), group S (Spearman r = 0.928, p 0.001), and group O (Spearman r = 0.525, p 0.05) similar significant associations between attack rates and number of admitted SARS patients were observed for groups N and S but not for group O (Spearman r = 0.737, 0.865, and 0.39, respectively) 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 5 0.00 0.33 0.43 0.86 0.00 0.00 0.16 0.48 6 0.00 0.95 0.28 0.55 0.23 0.00 0.13 0.13 0.58 7 0.00 0.12 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.07 8 0.26 0.00 0.90 0.91 0.41 0.00 0.40 0.14 9 0.42 0.00 1.11 0.00 0.18 0.00 0.50 0.00 10 0.26 0.26 0.19 0.96 0.00 0.00 0.17 0.31 11 0.47 0.00 hospital no.a No. of hospital staff who contracted SARS Attack rates (%) Group N Group S Group O Overalla Group N Group S Group O Overallb 1 3 0 0 2 2 0.00 0.00 0.73 0.18 2 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 the total number of affected hospital workers in these 16 hospitals was 339. the other 21 (5.8%) affected hospital staff worked in six other hospitals that had not admitted SARS patients. the number of affected staff in 2 hospitals accounted for 54.0% of the 339 cases in the 16 health Authority hospitals. overalla 1.06 1.31 0.59 0.82 0.00-4.38 p value 0.035b 0.015c aOverall: all the hospital workers, including all three groups (group N, nurses; group S, nonmedical support staff; group O, other technical and medical staff). cp values for testing differences among group N, S, and O (Kruskal-Wallis test) similar significant associations between attack rates and number of admitted SARS patients were observed for groups N and S but not for group O (Spearman r = 0.737, 0.865, and 0.39 respectively) overall attack rates for all hospital workers in the first phase of the epidemic were higher than those for the second phrase (on or after April 17, 2003: 0.22%) the overall attack rate for all workers in the 16 hospitals was 1.2%. staff members working in 14 hospitals contracted SARS. attack rate was >2% in three hospitals, which had 219 (60.8%) of the total 360 cases in Hong Kong. the attack rate of nonmedical support staff was higher than those of the other two groups in 10 of the 16 studied hospitals. nonmedical support staff accounted for 134 (39.5%) of the 339 SARS patients among hospital workers. nonmedical support staff were not contacting SARS patients as frequently as nurses did. this finding suggests that the fomite theory and aerosol theory of transmission could not be dismissed. the pooled attack rates (for 16 hospitals) were 0.22, 0.50, and 0.07, respectively, for nurses, nonmedical support, and other medical and technical staff. the respective ratios of the two phases of the epidemic were 4.50:1, 4.48:1, and 3.45:1 for the three types of hospital workers. this may be due to a reduction in the number of patients admitted after April 17. the study documents one of the most important scenarios of nosocomial infection among hospital workers. the results should help us to learn from this very costly lesson."}
