{"summary": "paramyxovirinae encodes multiple proteins from the phosphoprotein (P) gene transcription unit, including P, V, and C. in almost all Paramyxovirinae, the P gene mRNA is edited, resulting in the expression of at least two proteins, P and V, which share an identical N-terminus. the cladograms represent the measles, Nipah and Sendai groups. the two primary functions of the C proteins are their ability to regulate viral transcription/replication and to antagonize the antiviral responses of the host. a decrease in viral transcription/replication often correlates with a decrease in the innate antiviral responses of the host. henipaviruses and morbilliviruses block IFN signaling by decreasing viral RNA synthesis. but they have minimal effects on IFN signaling [15], [34]\u2013[37]. a new role has been reported for the C proteins of respiroviruses. de novo proteins characterised so far have previously unknown 3D structural folds [68], [71], [72] and novel mechanisms of action [71]. this class of proteins may challenge the notion that nature only utilizes a limited number of different protein folds and that this fold space is well mapped [73], [74].

This has no impact on the results presented. Sequence Analyses The secondary structure of individual sequences was predicted using Jpred [91], and was verified in context of multiple alignments using PROMALS [92]. we cloned full-length synthetic cDNAs of the C proteins of all 24 species in the measles, Nipah and Sendai groups. the resulting fusion proteins have an N-terminal hexahistidine tag followed by a 3C cleavage site immediately upstream of the coding sequence of the C proteins. sate was cleared at 50,000 g for 30 minutes before batch incubation. the material was collected in an Econo-Pac column (Biorad) and washed in 100 Column Volumes (CV) of lysis buffer. Fractions containing protein were pooled and loaded onto a preparative Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) size exclusion column pre-equilibrated in 20 mM Tris 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM we made 10-fold serial dilutions in 20 mM Hepes, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgSO4, pH 7.5. protein was concentrated to 0.6 mg/ml by spin concentrators (0.5 ml, 3 MWCO, Millipore) for limited proteolysis, 10 l of protein was mixed with 3 l of protease and incubated on ice for 30 min, 60 min or 2 hrs. all alignments are presented using Jalview [87], [86] with the ClustalX colouring scheme. the aligned sequences of the C proteins in text format are in File S1. salmon paramyxovirus Pacific PMV Unclassified AFF60402.1 Peste des petits ruminants virus PPRV Morbillivirus YP_133824.1 Phocine distemper virus P35940.1 Porcine parainfluenza virus 1 pPIV1 Respirovirus AGR39559.1 Rinderpest virus Rinderpest Morbillivirus ADF32062.1 Salem virus Sendai Respirovirus NP_056872.1 Tail the alignment of the C proteins was created using the MUSCLE program [90] built in TranslatorX. the alignment of the C proteins was created using the MUSCLE program [90] built in TranslatorX, and is thus slightly different from that generated by Psi-coffee. this has no impact on the results presented. we cloned full-length synthetic cDNAs of the C proteins of all 24 species in the measles, Nipah and Sendai groups. the resulting fusion proteins have an N-terminal hexahistidine tag followed by a 3C cleavage site immediately upstream of the coding sequence of the C proteins. the lysate was cleared at 50,000 g for 30 minutes before batch incubation. the material was collected in an Econo-Pac column (Biorad) and washed in 100 Column Volumes (CV) of lysis buffer. 10 l of protein was mixed with 3 l of protease and incubated on ice for 30 min, 60 min or 2 hrs. a subtilisin digest of hPIV1 C and an -chymotrypsin digest of Tupaia PMV C gave rise to stable fragments. the measles, Nipah and Sendai groups can be divided into three groups. the measles group is composed of morbilliviruses, of the unclassified Salem virus and of a subgroup comprising the unclassified Tupaia paramyxovirus, Mossman virus and Nariva virus. the sendai group is composed of respiroviruses and of the recently described genus aquaparamyxovirus. the aligned sequences in text format are in file S1. in these three groups, we observed a similar organization of the C proteins. a variable N-terminus predicted to be disordered, and a C-terminus predicted to be ordered. HHalign reported that the C proteins of the measles and Nipah groups have statistically significant similarity (E = 4106) over a region of about 50aa in their C-terminus. this high similarity could in theory result either from convergent evolution or from homologous descent. the fact that the measles and Nipah groups are phylogenetically related makes homologous descent a much more likely explanation. a 90\u2013120 aa C-terminus comprising a predicted -helix (1), a loop of 10\u201320aa (\u201cloop1\u20132\u201d), and three further -helices (forming helix 5 in some species of the Nipah group) only the region from 2 to 4 is well conserved in sequence; it contains many conserved positions. in the C proteins of the measles group, only the region from 2 to 4 is well conserved in sequence. an alcohol group (Serine/Threonine, S/T4) at the N-terminus of helix 4. a Glutamate (E4) two residues downstream are conserved in both groups. the conserved residues are also boxed in Figures 2 and 3. PNT contains sequences that bind the protein STAT1 in several morbilliviruses (measles virus [55], [56], canine distemper virus [57], Rinderpest virus [58] and henipaviruses (Nipah virus [58] and Hendra virus [59]). the region of PNT that contains these sites is highly variable in sequence (Figure 7), and thus its alignment is not reliable. homology of soyuz1 motifs is suspected but not proven. regions whose homology is proven have the same color, but different patterns. Y/H]DH[S/G]GE motifs common to the STAT1-binding sites of measles virus and Nipah virus PNT are in bold. the STAT1-binding sites of measles virus and Nipah virus PNT are conserved in sequence only in very closely related species. this similarity is unlikely to be due to homologous descent. the tyrosine residues immediately upstream of this motif are not aligned together in the reliable alignment of PNT. we also noticed an 8aa motif (aa 104\u2013111 in Nipah virus) conserved in the PNT. sensitive vaccine virus [114] 127\u2013138 (deletion) Ablated interaction with SHCBP1, reduced ability toinhibit minigenome replication [115] NIPAH GROUP Sendai virus C 10\u201315 (deletion) Inability to interact with and modulate levels ofphosphorylated STAT1 [48] Series of deletions inaa149\u2013157 Loss of nuclear translocation of Y1 by Ran-GTPase pathway [120] K151A/E153 parainfluenzavirus 3 (hPIV3) CN25, CN50 (deletions) Increased inhibition of viral RNA synthesis, suppression of viralreplication, decreased ability to block Type 1 IFN signaling [121], [122] K3A, K6A, K12A,E16A, R24A Increased inhibition of viral RNA synthesis, decreased ability to block Type 1 IFN signaling [122] the role of the disordered N-terminus of measles virus C is poorly known. it contributes to nuclear localization, which correlates with its ability to block IFN induction. in the Nipah group, there are no fine mutational data published. but it is known that both the N-terminus and the C-terminus of Nipah virus C are required to inhibit minigenome replication. we systematically tested the expression and solubility of the C proteins of all species in the measles, Nipah and Sendai groups. we found that the C proteins of tupaia paramyxovirus (Tupaia PMV) and of hPIV1 were by far the best candidates, for the measles/Nipah groups and Sendai group respectively, in terms of yield and solubility. hPIV1 C elutes at an apparent molecular mass of 21.4 kDa. hPIV1 C elutes at a much larger MW (38.7 kDa) than expected. this discrepancy could correspond to an extended shape, or to self-association in a fast equilibrium between a monomeric and dimeric form. whole C-terminus of C (expected size 14.16 kD) corresponds well to our sequence predictions. the presence of a long, disordered region in hPIV1 C is compatible with its high apparent molecular weight observed in SEC. the observed fragments of 14.4 and 13kD correspond exactly to C proteins where aa 1\u201329 and 1\u201343, respectively, have been digested. the size of the smaller fragment (6kD) corresponds to aa 81\u2013135, indicating that the last 18 C-terminal aa are digested upon extended proteolysis. hPIV1 and Tupaia PMV are predominantly -helical and contain a disordered N-terminus. other Paramyxovirinae that do not express a C frame can be classified in two groups based on the phylogeny of their P gene. the mumps group (comprised of the sister genera rubulavirus and avulavirus) and the Fer de lance group (formed by the genus ferlavirus [108]) numbering corresponds to the C protein of Sendai virus. arrows indicate the start of the different isoforms of C. for information, the arrowhead indicates the well-characterized F residue of respiroviruses (F170 in Sendai virus) sequence analysis of the C proteins of the measles and Nipah groups. regions of the measles and Nipah groups are all composed of a 30\u201360 amino acid (aa) N-terminus predicted to be at least partially disordered. yuz1 and soyuz2 motifs of the P frame should not be over-interpreted. an alignment of the C proteins of both groups revealed four remarkable positions conserved in nearly all viruses (boxed in Figure 5) a Tyrosine (Y) upstream of helix 2 (Y2); a Glutamate (E2) at the C-terminus of the same helix; a residue with an alcohol group (Serine/Threonine, S/T4) aa, rich in Prolines (P), Serines (S) and Threonines (T), followed by a conserved C-terminus composed of four -helices (A to D) there are 11 residues strictly conserved in C across the Sendai group, clustered predominantly in the C-terminus of C and in D. d in two steps, we used the amino acid alignment of the C proteins. we translated this nucleotide alignment into an amino acid alignment in the P frame. the alignment of PNT of the measles and Nipah groups is presented in Figure 9. Y110 of measles virus PNT and Y116 of Nipah virus PNT are in bold. the STAT1-binding sites of measles virus and measles Virus overlap Different regions of C. only 2 aa out of 11 correspond to conservative substitutions. the STAT1-binding sites of measles virus and Nipah virus PNT are not aligned together (Figure 9). the tyrosine residues immediately upstream of this motif are not aligned together in the reliable alignment of PNT (Figure 9), indicating that they are not homologous either. the most relevant studies are in Table 2 and a more extensive list of studies is in Table S1. We found that very few conserve positions identified herein have been subjected to targeted mutagenesis. notable substitutions are indicated in bold in Figures 2 and 4. Table 2. dsRNA [39] K151A/E153A/R154A (Cm5) Attenuated virulence in vivo, inability to block IFN signaling,inability to inhibit replication, inability to skew STAT1/2phosphorylation and to bind STAT1 decreased bindingto L protein [39], [46], [118], [127] Human parainfluenzavirus 1 (hPIV1) R84G Increased IFN- production, increased IRF3 nuclear a 12aa peptide (aa 127\u2013138) has been shown to inhibit the viral polymerase by interacting with SHCBP1. this peptide contains two other positions conserved in the measles/Nipah groups. the role of the disordered N-terminus of measles virus C is poorly known, although it contributes to nuclear localization. studies of the N-terminus of C in the Sendai group indicate that it also contributes to antagonizing the innate immune response. they suggest that both the N- and C-terminus of Sendai group C proteins may need to act in coordinated fashion in order to perform their complete suite of antagonistic and regulatory functions. we analyzed the secondary structure of the C proteins by Circular Dichroism (CD) the CD spectrum of both proteins is typical of -helical content. the estimated -helical content was 57% for hPIV1 C and 33% for Tupaia PMV C. we used limited proteolysis combined with N-terminal sequencing to probe the structural organization of the C proteins of hPIV1 and Tupaia PMV. the size of this fragment indicates that it comprises the whole C-terminus of C (expected size 14.16 kD), which corresponds well to our sequence predictions. aa 1\u201356 are devoid of secondary structure and aa 1\u201342 disordered. the observed fragments of 14.4 and 13kD correspond exactly to C proteins. the size of the smaller fragment (6kD) corresponds to aa 81\u2013135, indicating that the last 18 C-terminal aa are digested upon extended proteolysis. the C proteins of the Sendai group have no detectable sequence similarity with those of the measles/Nipah groups. the absence of a C protein in the mumps group is probably due to a loss in the ancestor of that group. the absence of a C protein in the mumps group is probably due to a loss in the ancestor of that group. the codon usages of PNT and C are indistinguishable in Paramyxovirinae (Angelo Pavesi, personal communication) however, functional considerations suggest that the PNT frame originated earlier, since it is indispensable to viral replication in vitro [2], [132], unlike C [20], [133], [134]. ancestry of PNT is supported by a comparison with families related to Paramyxovirinae (Mononegavirales) measles virus and Nipah virus have originated independently. their limited sequence similarity would thus not be result of homologous descent. convergent evolution seems a definite possibility, since mechanisms by which PNT acts are somewhat similar in both viruses. a region of the P/C gene encodes simultaneously, in different frames, two well-conserved regions. a second key to the paradox of overlapping genes is that it may be beneficial for a virus, under certain conditions, to encode functional motifs simultaneously. this arrangement seems to dramatically restrict the capacity of the virus to mutate. overlapping genes provide a regulatory advantage that may offset the increased constraints they impose on the virus. a third key to the paradox of overlapping genes is that they provide a regulatory advantage that may offset the increased constraints they impose on the virus. the expression levels of the C and V proteins of Nipah or measles viruses are co-regulated, since they are transcribed from the same gene transcription unit. the absence of a C protein in the mumps group is probably due to a loss in the ancestor of that group. this common origin would imply that in Sendai virus, it is the Y1 isoform of C that is the equivalent of C of the measles/Nipah groups. this common origin would imply that the basic regions in the N-terminus of C have originated independently in the Sendai and Nipah groups. mononegavirales encode P proteins with a disordered N-terminus [14], [135]. this N-terminus has the same function as Paramyxovirinae PNT, i.e. preventing the nucleoprotein from self-assembling illegitimately [136]\u2013[139]. this strongly suggests that they have originated independently. convergent evolution seems a definite possibility, since the mechanisms by which PNT acts are somewhat similar in both viruses. overlapping genes encode an \u201cancillary\u201d frame that can tolerate a higher substitution rate than the other, \u201cdominant\u201d frame. overlapping genes often encode an \u201cancillary\u201d frame that can tolerate a higher substitution rate than that of C. a region of the P/C gene encodes simultaneously, in different frames, two well-conserved regions. this arrangement seems to dramatically restrict the capacity of the virus to mutate and to escape host defenses. this seems beyond coincidence, and strongly suggests that the loss of fitness of the virus due to its reduced ability to mutate is compensated by an evolutionary advantage. the expression levels of the C and V proteins of Nipah or measles viruses are co-regulated, since they are transcribed from the same gene transcription unit. together they inhibit both viral RNA synthesis and type I IFN induction, enabling an efficient block of the first stage of the host antiviral response. in the same vein, the expression of C and P is also co-regulated and they have complementary effects on viral transcription. doc)."}
