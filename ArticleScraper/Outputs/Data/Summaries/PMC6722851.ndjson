{"summary": "approximately 36.9 million people worldwide were living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 2017. the introduction of highly active antiretroviral drugs (ARDs) mainly includes nucleoside/nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs/NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs) and integrase inhibitors (INIs) fusion peptide (FP) inserts into the target cell membrane and forms an extended prehairpin intermediate (PHI) conformation. three N-terminal heptad repeats (NHRs) form the inner core and then three C-terminal heptad repeats (CHRs) encapsulate the NHR trimer in an anti-parallel manner to form a six-helix bundle (6HB) thereby forming a fusion pore and causing ceptor inhibitors targeting gp120 and gp41 are at the forefront of current research. protein- and peptide-based inhibitors targeting both gp120 and gp41 are also at the forefront of current research. gp41 is colored in light pink with the fusion peptide (FP), N-terminal heptad repeats (NHR), C-terminal heptad repeats (CHR) and membrane-proximal external region (MPER) regions colored in blue, cycan, bright gray and cycan-blue. the images were generated with the software PyMOL according to the PDB ID: 5VJ6. 45-46 m2 and 45-46 m7 are NIH45-46G54W mutants based on the NIH45-46-gp120 complex structure and the NIH45-46G54W resistant strain sequence analysis design. the activity of 45-46 m2 was similar to that of 45-46 m7, and it was greater than that of 45-46 m7. however, the 45-46 m2-neutralizing NIH45-46 3BNC117 has good pharmacokinetic properties and is effective in inhibiting viremia in HIV-1-infected patients for up to 28 days. some patients developed 3BNC117-resistant strains in a short period of time. cellular immunity and humoral immunity to HIV-1 were found in patients treated with 3BNC117. b12 exerts inhibitory activity upon entry of the virus into cells. therefore, b12 exerts a dual role, acting before and after infection. binding of gp120 to CD4 plays a key role in the first step of viral entry. CD4 (D1D2) and an IgG2 scaffold without the VH and VL domains, was designed [51,52] as expected, PRO-542 interrupted CD4 binding with gp120 by mimicking the CD4 receptor and enhancing peptide valence and flexibility. compared to sCD4, PRO-542 bound with more avidity to virions. mD1.22 was linked to a gp120 CoRbs-targeting neutralizing antibody domain (m36.4) and human IgG1 Fc. these fusion proteins target both the CD4bs and CoRbs. they are about 10-, 50-, and 200-fold more potent than the bNAb VRC01, T20, and CD4-Ig. the characteristics of CD4M9 and its binding gp120 have been studied. a 27 amino acid peptide, CD4M33, was designed with a CD4-like affinity to HIV-1 Env. it inhibits the HIV-1 pseudovirus at the pM or nM level. us macaque infection is expected to act as a microbicide to prevent sexual transmission of HIV-1. phage-displayed 12-mer peptide libraries showed a novel peptide, G1, which inhibits the interaction between gp120 and CD4. the IC50 for inhibition of the interaction between gp120 and CD4 is about 50 M. the binding mechanisms of CD4 and 12p1 are different. it is possible that 12p1 interacts with an unliganded gp120, rather than the activated one by CD4, resulting in the inability of gp120 to interact with its receptors. compared to sCD4, further optimization still needs to be done. some CD4i-specific antibodies have shown stronger gp120-binding affinity than those without sulfated tyrosine. pV2-Tys is a Tys-sulfated peptide that targets the binding site on gp120 and effectively inhibits HIV-1 infection of CCR5+ cells. pV2-Tys is not restricted by pCCR5-Tys and has a broad spectrum of anti-HIV-1 activity. pE51 is a sulfated peptide derived from the CDR 3 region of the CD4i antibody E51, which inhibits the binding of HIV-1 to the CCR coreceptor in a CD4-independent manner. however, the inhibitory activity of these peptides is at the M level. 2G12, PG9 and PG16 can efficiently recognize HIV-1-infected CD4 T cells and induce CD4 T cell clearance by antibody-dependent complement-mediated lysis (ADCML) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) bNAbs can be used in combinations to maximize the clearance of HIV-infected cells for HIV cure. 10-1074 is a clonal variant of PGT 121 targeting the gp120 V3 loop isolated from a patient infected with subtype A HIV-1. the combination of 10-1074 and 3BNC117 resulted in long-term effective inhibition of viral load in patients. however, their specific antiviral mechanisms of action are still unclear. gp120 CD4bs-Targeting Antibodies VRC01, VRC02, and VRC03 mimicked the interaction of CD4 receptor with gp120. daniel sturridge: nM level of HIV-1 inhibitory activity was low. sturridge: nm level of HIV-1 inhibitory activity was lower than that of VRC03. sturridge: nm level of HIV-1 inhibitory activity should be investigated. 2 and 45-46 m7 are NIH45-46G54W mutants based on the NIH45-46-gp120 complex structure and the NIH45-46G54W resistant strain sequence analysis design. the activity of 45-46 m2 was similar to that of 45-46 m7. but the 45-46 m2-neutralizing NIH45-46 resistant strain was more effective than NIH45-46G54W [21] patients developed 3BNC117-resistant strains in a short period of time. passive immunization of 3BNC117 accelerates clearance of infected cells. cellular immunity and humoral immunity to HIV-1 were found in patients treated with 3BNC117. b12 is thought to have a dual role, acting before and after infection. binding of gp120 to CD4 plays a key role in the first step of viral entry. first two extracellular domains (D1D2) could also simulate CD4 receptor binding to gp120. compared to sCD4, PRO-542 bound with more avidity to virions. compared to sCD4, it had a long half-life of 3-4 days in vivo. however, intravenous administration and drug cost may be obstacles to clinical use. these fusion proteins target both the CD4bs and CoRbs. they are about 10-, 50-, and 200-fold more potent than the bNAb VRC01, T20, and CD4-Ig. they have shown higher stability and specificity and a lower aggregation propensity than CD4-Ig. CD4M9 binds the Phe-43 pocket of gp120 with nM affinity. binding of CD4M9 to gp120 could block binding of gp120 to coreceptor. binding of CD4M9 to gp120 could block binding of gp120 to coreceptor. a novel peptide, G1, inhibits the interaction between gp120 and CD4. the IC50 for inhibition of the interaction between gp120 and CD4 is about 50 M. the follow-up results showed that six amino acids in the middle of G1 play a crucial role in its activity. a common drawback among CD4M9, G1 and 12p1 is the human body. modified exogenous proteins are likely to induce specific antibodies which would have a negative impact on the inhibitory activity, or half-life, limiting clinical use as therapeutic agents. some CD4i-specific antibodies containing sulfated tyrosine have shown stronger gp120-binding affinity than those without sulfated tyrosine. the Tys177 sulfated peptide pV2-Tys (amino acids 168\u2013185) derived from the V2 loop of gp120 can serve as a structural and functional mimetic of the N-terminus of CCR5 acting directly on the coR pE51 is a sulfated peptide derived from the CDR 3 region of the CD4i antibody E51, which inhibits the binding of HIV-1 to the CCR coreceptor in a CD4-independent manner. however, the inhibitory activity of these peptides is at the M level, and further optimization is needed. the four bNAbs, CH01 to CH04, are derived from the same clonal lineage isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals. they recognize conformational epitopes similar to PG9 and PG16 epitopes on gp120 V2/V3. CH03 has the strongest neutralizing activity with mean and median IC50 of 2.4 and 0.46 g/mL. the bNAb 10-1074 has neutralizing activity in vitro and in vivo. the combination of 10-1074 and 3BNC117 resulted in long-term effective inhibition of viral load in patients. no resistant strains were found in phase I clinical trial. gp120 CD4bs-Targeting Antibodies VRC01, VRC02, and VRC03 mimicked the interaction of CD4 receptor with gp120. gp120 is partially mimicking the interaction of CD4 receptor with gp120. NIH45-46 are more potent VRC01 mutants screened from the HIV-1 antibody library using single-cell cloning technology. n6 is a bNAb isolated from an HIV-infected patient, and it targets the gp120 CD4bs. it has more effective neutralizing activity than VRC01, and inhibits the VRC01-resistant strain. this could be attributed to the dependence of N6 on the conserved region of gp120. 3BNC117 is a gp120 CD4bs-targeting bNAb isolated from an elite controller infected with an HIV-1 clade A1/D recombinant. it exhibits broad-spectrum and neutralizing activity similar to that of VRC01 and 3BNC117, but the latter two were isolated from patients infected with a single subtype of HIV-1. the induction of bNAb targeting CD4bs is not dependent on viral subtype soluble CD4 (sCD4) can compete with the CD4 receptor for ligand. first two extracellular domains (D1D2) could also simulate CD4 receptor binding to gp120. sCD4 had high anti-HIV-1 activity in vitro and in vivo. sCD4 bound with more avidity to virions and had a long half-life of 3-4 days in vivo. some smaller forms of sCD4 that only contain the D1 domain were designed based on the crystal structure of CD4 and gp120. however, they were very unstable in neutral environment and had lower affinity with gp120 than D1D2. bNAb VRC01, T20, and CD4-Ig have shown higher stability and specificity. they also showed a lower aggregation propensity than CD4-Ig. most recently, we have tested the anti-HIV-1 activity of 4Dm2m. binding of CD4M9 to gp120 could block binding of gp120 to coreceptor. a 27 amino acid peptide, CD4M33, was designed with a CD4-like affinity to HIV-1 Env. it inhibits the HIV-1 pseudovirus at the pM or nM level. hexametric linear peptide showed a 10-fold lower IC50 than G1. this hexametric linear peptide exhibited a 10-fold lower IC50 than G1. this hexametric linear peptide showed an even lower IC50 of 1 M. a common drawback among CD4M9, G1 and 12p1 is the human body. modified exogenous proteins are likely to induce specific antibodies which would have a negative impact on the inhibitory activity. the gp120 CD4bs-Targeting Antibodies VRC01, VRC02, and VRC03 mimicking the interaction of CD4 receptor with gp120. 45-46 m2 and 45-46 m7 are NIH45-46G54W mutants based on the NIH45-46-gp120 complex structure and the NIH45-46G54W resistant strain sequence analysis design. the activity of 45-46 m2 was similar to that of 45-46 m7, and it was greater than that of 45-46 m7. however, the 45-46 m2-neutralizing NIH45-46 3BNC117 has good pharmacokinetic properties and is effective in inhibiting viremia in HIV-1-infected patients for up to 28 days. some patients developed 3BNC117-resistant strains in a short period of time. cellular immunity and humoral immunity to HIV-1 were found in patients treated with 3BNC117. b12 exerts inhibitory activity upon entry of the virus into cells. therefore, b12 exerts a dual role, acting before and after infection. binding of gp120 to CD4 plays a key role in the first step of viral entry. PRO-542 interrupted CD4 binding with gp120 by mimicking the CD4 receptor and enhancing peptide valence and flexibility. compared to sCD4, PRO-542 had a long half-life of 3-4 days in vivo. however, intravenous administration and drug cost may be obstacles to clinical use. fusion proteins target both the CD4bs and CoRbs. they exhibited broadly cross-reactive and exceptionally potent neutralizing activity. they have shown higher stability and specificity and a lower aggregation propensity than CD4-Ig. most recently, we have tested the anti-HIV-1 activity of 4Dm2m. CD4M9 can bind to the conserved CD4-binding pocket of gp120 with nM affinity. binding of CD4M9 to gp120 could block binding of gp120 to coreceptor. binding of CD4M9 to gp120 could block binding of gp120 to coreceptor. a novel peptide, G1, inhibits the interaction between gp120 and CD4. the IC50 for inhibition of the interaction between gp120 and CD4 is about 50 M. the follow-up results showed that six amino acids in the middle of G1 play a crucial role in its activity. 12p1 interacts with and stabilizes an unliganded gp120, rather than the activated one by CD4, resulting in the inability of gp120 to interact with its receptors. a common drawback among CD4M9, G1 and 12p1 is the human body. modified exogenous proteins are likely to induce specific antibodies which would have a negative impact on the inhibitory activity. some CD4i-specific antibodies have shown stronger gp120-binding affinity than those without sulfated tyrosine. pV2-Tys is a Tys-sulfated peptide that targets the binding site on gp120 and effectively inhibits HIV-1 infection of CCR5+ cells. pV2-Tys is not restricted by pCCR5-Tys and has a broad spectrum of anti-HIV-1 activity. pE51 is a sulfated peptide derived from the CDR 3 region of the CD4i antibody E51, which inhibits the binding of HIV-1 to the CCR coreceptor. however, the inhibitory activity of these peptides is at the M level. Tys177 sulfated peptide pV2-Tys (amino acids 168\u2013185) derived from the V2 loop of gp120 stabilize the intramolecular interaction of the V2 and V3 loops of gp120. pV2-Tys is a Tys-sulfated peptide that targets the binding site on gp120 and effectively inhibits HIV-1 infection of CCR5+ cells. antibodies or Recombinant Proteins Targeting gp120 Variable Loops and/or Glycan PG9 and PG16 are similarly potent mAbs isolated from HIV-1 patients. compared to the earlier gp120-targeting bNAb 2G12 [88], both have higher neutralizing activity and broad spectrum in 162 different subtypes of HIV-1 pseudovirus neutralization experiments. 16 epitopes on gp120 V2/V3 can neutralize tier 2, rather than tier 1, primary isolates. CH03 has the strongest neutralizing activity with mean and median IC50 of 2.4 and 0.46 g/mL against 91 HIV-1 primary isolates. circulating HIV-1 clade C in patients could escape the neutralization of PGT128 with N332 glycan specificity. some lectins have been found to interact with gp120 resulting in interference with the binding of gp120 to the CD4 receptor. however, their specific antiviral mechanisms of action are still unclear. however, such mechanisms may interact with glycans to exert antiviral effects. the four bNAbs, CH01 to CH04, are derived from the same clonal lineage isolated from HIV-1-infected individuals. they recognize conformational epitopes similar to PG9 and PG16 epitopes on gp120 V2/V3. they can neutralize tier 2, rather than tier 1, primary isolates. 10-1074 is a clonal variant of PGT 121 targeting the gp120 V3 loop isolated from a patient infected with subtype A HIV-1. the bNAb 10-1074 has neutralizing activity in vitro and in vivo. Griffithsin (GRFT) is a 12.7KD protein derived from red algae. it has been shown to inhibit HIV-1 infection and Env-mediated cell-cell fusion at low nM levels. however, CV-N and GRFT can be amply expressed in E. coli with low cytotoxicity. anti-HIV peptides and neutralizing antibodies targeting these domains have been reported. gp41 NHR-Targeting Antibodies D5 is a human-derived scFv. it targets the NHR pocket-binding region of gp41 and blocks infection by different HIV isolates. amino acid recombinant peptide containing entire T20 and C34 sequences showed inhibitory activity similar to that of C34 in vitro. it could be highly expressed in the E. coli system, up to 85mg-145mg per liter of culture. this is still exciting news for future low cost and large-scale production. recombinant protein NCCG-gp41 consists of N35 (residues 546-580)-N34 (residues 546-579)-SGGRGG-C28 (residues 628-655), wherein the 576-578 residues of N35 are replaced by CCG. the trimer exhibits potent anti-HIV activity in vitro, and its IC50 is at low nM for HIV-1 En ccN28Fd is resistant to heat, pepsin and proteinase K. ccN28Fd is approximately 20-fold more active than N28Fd in inhibiting HIV-1 IIIB and Bal infection. antibodies and proteins targeting NHR/CHR complex were found. the fusion did not complete immediately after 6HB formation. a series of previously unknown molecular events very likely takes place. a similar view is currently controversial. 2F5 neutralizes multiple HIV-1 strains and exerts antiviral activity by interacting with linear epitopes formed by the ELDKWA (residues 662-667) sequence in the gp41 MPER region. another human monoclonal antibody, 4E10, was also obtained. it specifically recognizes the relatively conserved tryptophan-rich linear epitope (residues 671-676) located in the MPER. the main reason for the high neutralizing activity of 10E8v2.0/iMab is the ibalizumab (iMab) component which can guide 10E8 v2.0 enrichment at the site where the fusion occurs. the in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity of 10E8.4/iMab was slightly higher than that of 10E8.2/iMab. the researchers used GBV-C proteins, such as E1 and E2, to study their anti-HIV-1 activity. they found that some peptides derived from E1 or E2 may inhibit HIV-1 infection by interacting with HIV-1 FP [148,149,150,151,152,153]. in vitro six-helix complex has been thought to mimic native 6HB. it is therefore used to screen for fusion inhibitors that target NHR or CHR. a modified new model was proposed, in which more CHR residues were found to interact with NHR. first generation CHR-peptides consist of three peptides derived from the HIV-1 gp41 CHR domain, including SJ-2176 (residues 630-659), DP-178 (residues 638-673), and C34 (residues 628-661), respectively. new york blood center filed the patent on SJ-2176 (US Patent 5,444,044) on March 26, 1992. T20 lacks PBD and thus cannot interact with viral gp41 NHR as effectively as C34 to block HIV fusion. we therefore believed that T20 needs the LBD to interact with target cell membrane to enhance its interaction with the viral NHR domain [178,179]. the first designed peptides, SC34 and SC35EK, showed activity similar to that of C34, while they interacted with gp41 NHR more strongly and were more soluble than C34. the same strategy was applied to T20 and resulted in T20EK, with 10-fold potent increase compared with T20. sifuvirtide is a novel peptide inhibitor developed by Fusogen, Inc. [189] its sequence is derived from C34 with some mutations, and the spiral property is enhanced. it also has a more potent anti-HIV activity in vitro than T20 [189], especially to T20-resistant HIV-1 strains. FB006 (albuvirtide) administered intravenously with current ARDs once a week could effectively inhibit HIV-1 infection and reduce viral load. the third generation CHR-peptides are the modified CHR-peptides with anti-HIV-1 activity more than 50-fold more potent than T20 and C34. it inhibits not only T20-resistant strains, but also C34-resistant strains. a 23-residue peptide contains MT-hook and the HIV-2 sequence. the short peptide 2P23 contains the MT-hook and the HIV-2 sequence. compared to HP23, 2P23 has low HIV-1 inhibitory activity. a series of long-chain hydrophobic residues at the C-terminus of CHR-peptide WQ (residues 628-653) to target NTHP. the newly designed peptide WQ-IDL was more active than T20 in inhibiting HIV-1 IIIB and Bal infection. we found that the activity of MT-WQ-IDL was further improved. lipopeptides exhibited prolonged half-life in vivo than unconjugated peptides. LP40 inhibits cell-cell fusion and pseudovirus entry activity complementary to LP-11, thus having a synergistic antiviral effect. LP52 has a high gene barrier and a long half-life. it also inhibits a large number of HIV-1 isolates at low pM levels. most of these lipopeptides are palmitic acid modified with existing CHR-peptides containing or lacking PBD. lipid rafts are thought to be the hallmark of HIV-1 budding and entry into T cells and macrophages. many glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins are localized in lipid rafts. this again proves that the inclusion of substances capable of binding to lipid membranes in HIV inhibitors is an effective way to increase the activity of inhibitors. the peptide N36Mut(e,g) was designed by replacing the hydrophobic residues at the e, g positions of N36 with hydrophilic residues. this peptide may interact with the viral gp41 NHR to form heterologous 6HB, thus blocking fusion between viral and cell membranes. the inhibitory activity of C16 to either N- or C-terminus of N36 is 17-fold stronger than that of C16-N36Mut(e,g) [202,218] suggesting a planar orientation of the peptides and the endogenous NHR region on the cell membrane. the study of NHR-peptide fusion inhibitors is still attractive because they have the advantage of targeting gp41 CHR. scFv is a 55 amino acid recombinant peptide containing the entire T20 and C34 sequences. it targets the NHR pocket-binding region of gp41 and blocks infection by different HIV isolates. the attachment of D5 to cholesterol increases its membrane binding and antiviral activity. our group has also designed a series of recombinant CHR-peptide fusion inhibitors. they were not reported because of their low inhibitory activities. the recombinant peptides were closely related to their anti-HIV activities. idues 546-580)-N34 (residues 546-580)-SGGRGG-C28 (residues 628-655), wherein the 576-578 residues of N35 are replaced by CCG, resulting in the formation of a trimer [122] the NCCG-gp41 trimer exhibits potent anti-HIV activity in vitro, and its IC50 is at low nM for HIV-1 Env ccN28Fd is not affected by semen and vaginal secretions, it also shows promise for the development of microbicides. antibodies targeting NHR/CHR complex were found, such as human monoclonal antibodies Fab-d [125], 50-69 [126], 126-7 [127], murine monoclonal antibodies NC-1 [128], 2G8 and 9F2 [129]. Interestingly, some antibodies inhibit HIV Env-mediated cell-cell membrane fusion at physiological human bone marrow cDNA library was screened by the yeast two-hybrid technique. further analysis revealed that the endocytic protein POB1 binding to rsgp41 is effective in inhibiting HIV-1 infection. a variety of human monoclonal antibodies have been found to target different epitopes in MPER and neutralize different subtypes of HIV-1. 10E8 is a bNAb derived from an HIV-1 patient whose epitope contains the residues of the transmembrane region (TM) and the entire MPER of gp41. unlike 2F5 and 4E10, 10E8 has higher HIV-1 neutralizing activity and has no specific reactivity to self-antigens. in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity of 10E8.4/iMab was slightly higher than that of 10E8.2/iMab. 3.1.1. gp41 NHR-Targeting Antibodies D5 targets the NHR pocket-binding region of gp41 and blocks infection by different HIV isolates. argeting Peptides C52L is a 55 amino acid recombinant peptide containing the entire T20 and C34 sequences with higher helicity and binding ability to NHR. it showed inhibitory activity similar to that of C34 in vitro, which was much better than T20. this is still exciting news for future low cost and large-scale production. MAb HK20 is isolated from HIV-infected individuals whose epitope covers the conserved hydrophobic pocket region in NHR. the combination of HK20 and D5 with NHR epitopes at different angles may allow HK20 to exhibit higher neutralizing activity and broad profile. gp41 CHR-specific antibodies include murine monoclonal antibodies D40, D17, D50 [119] and FC-1, which exhibit different neutralizing activities against various HIV isolates. however, the neutralizing titers of these antibodies have not been reported, likely because of their lower neutralizing activity. the NCCG-gp41 trimer exhibits potent anti-HIV activity in vitro. its IC50 is at low nM for HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion. chimera protein HIV-1 fusion inhibitors include N36Fd, N28Fd, and ccN28Fd. recombinant protein NCCG-gp41 consists of N35 (residues 546-580)-N34 (residues 546-579)-SGGRGG-C28 (residues 628-655), wherein the 576-578 residues of N35 are replaced by CCG. the trimer exhibits potent anti-HIV activity in vitro, and its IC50 is at low nM for HIV-1 En cN28Fd is approximately 20-fold more active than N28Fd in inhibiting HIV-1 IIIB and Bal infection [124]. antibodies and proteins targeting NHR/CHR complex were found, such as human monoclonal antibodies Fab-d [125], 50-69 [126], 126-7 [127], murine monoclonal antibodies NC-1 [128], 2G8 and 9F2 [129]. however, most of them cannot neutralize HIV at physiological temperature. target cell membrane do not start to fuse immediately after gp41 changes conformation. the human bone marrow cDNA library was screened by the yeast two-hybrid technique. further analysis revealed that endocytic protein POB1 binding to rsgp41 is effective in inhibiting HIV-1 infection. 4E10 is a bNAb derived from an HIV-1 patient whose epitope contains the residues of the transmembrane region (TM) and the entire MPER of gp41. it recognizes the relatively conserved tryptophan-rich linear epitope located in the gp41 MPER region. 10E8.4/iMab with higher solubility and stability is obtained by introducing hydrophilic amino acid mutations into 10E8v2.0/iMab [141]. in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity of 10E8.4/iMab was slightly higher than that of 10E8.2/iMab. 10E8 mutant 10E8v4 has no specific reactivity to self-antigens. ibalizumab (iMab) component can guide 10E8 v2.0 enrichment. in vitro and in vivo antiviral activity of 10E8v2.0/iMab was slightly higher than 10E8.2/iMab. VIRIP was used to construct bispecific molecules with higher inhibitory activity. it suggests that other domains on gp41 may also serve might be designed as a drug targets for development of novel HIV entry inhibitors. two representative peptides, C34 (CHR-peptide) and N36 (NHR-peptide) [166], form a six-helix complex in vitro with the N36 trimer as the core and the three C34 peptides in anti-parallel, similar to native 6HB. this complex has been thought to mimic native 6HB and is therefore used to screen for fusion inhibitors that target NHR or CHR [167] the first generation CHR-peptides consist of three peptides derived from the HIV-1 gp41 CHR domain. the first generation CHR-peptides consist of three peptides derived from the HIV-1 gp41 CHR domain, including SJ-2176 (residues 630-659), DP-178 (residues 638-673), and C34 (residues 628-661) T20 (enfuvirtide) was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2003 as the first HIV fusion inhibitor-based anti-HIV drug for clinical use. but its clinical application is limited because of its low potency (about 10-fold less potent than C34) and short half-life (about 2 h), thus requiring subcutaneous injections twice daily at a dose of 90 mg. the second generation CHR-peptides are the mutant peptides of T20 or C34 with anti-HIV-1 activity about 10- to 20-fold more potent than T20, such as SC34 and its analogs. the same strategy was applied to T20 and resulted in T20EK, with 10-fold potent increase compared with T20. T1144 was designed based on the sequence of C38 peptide (residues 626-663) it maintains a stable -helic trimeric structure (up to 97%) in neutral buffer. some studies have proved that certain CHR-peptides with high helicity (100%) show little anti-HIV activity. conventional peptide inhibitors are susceptible to protease degradation. binding to serum albumin prolongs their half-life in vivo. FB006M obtained by chemical modification of the 13th residue of FB006 with MPA is not immunogenic. CP32M inhibits not only T20-resistant strains, but also C34-resistant strains [193,194] providing a novel paradigm for the development of a new generation of entry inhibitors. MT-hook can stabilize the interaction of CHR-peptide and the pocket-forming domain of NHR. AP3 is superior to T20, AP1 and AP2 in antiviral activity, antiviral profile and pharmacological properties. we found a shallow pocket at the N-terminus of the NHR (L544-V549). it consists of Leu544 and Ile548 of one NHR helix and Leu545 and Val549 residues of another NHR helix. lipopeptides exhibited prolonged half-life in vivo than unconjugated peptides. the same team then designed a series of lipopeptides to design LP40 by replacing the T20 C-terminal tryptophan-rich region with C16. LP46 has higher inhibitory activity than LP40, with IC50 values down to pM levels, and exhibits synergy with LP40 [207] LP52 is a 28 amino acid lipopeptide designed based on the analysis of the structure-activity relationship of LP40 and LP46. LP52 has a high gene barrier and a long half-life and inhibits a large number of HIV-1 isolates at low pM levels. -1 isolates in vitro are about 25- to 100-fold that of C34 activity. this strategy can also be applied to enhance the antiviral activity of fusion inhibitory peptides against enveloped viruses, such as influenza virus. gp41 heptad repeats (CHR) with side view and N-terminal heptad repeats (NHR)-derived peptides are underlined. residues of CHR are divided into three groups: major binding sites, assistant binding sites, and nonbinding sites. the interaction, or potential interaction, between CHR and NHR is shown in red or blue dashed lines. palmitic acid (C16) was conjugated to its N terminus (C16-N27), but not C terminus (N27-C16), suggesting that N27 mainly targets the CHR rather than the internal NHR coiled-coil. the inhibitory activity of N36Mut(e,g)-C16 is about 17-fold stronger than that of C16-N36Mut(e,g) [202,218], suggesting a planar orientation of the the study of gp41 FP Kirchhoff\u2019s group used a comprehensive peptide library to make a large-scale screen. they obtained peptide VIRIP derived from a human natural protein 1-antitrypsin. it could inhibit infection of diverse HIV-1 strains, including those resistant to T20 in vitro at low M level. some peptides derived from E1 or E2 may inhibit HIV-1 infection by interacting with HIV-1 FP. the 18-amino acid peptide E1P47 was screened from the E1 protein overlapping peptide library. its inhibitory activity against the original isolate is comparable to that of VIR-576 [151]. a modified new model was proposed, in which more CHR residues were found to interact with NHR. some CHR-peptides based on the new model show various HIV-1 inhibitory activities. most of the amino acids of NHR are very important for viral infection, and it is a popular research target for CHR-peptides. new york blood center filed the patent on SJ-2176 (US Patent 5,444,044) on march 26, 1992 (issued on August 22, 1995), while Duke University filed the patent on T20 (US Patent 5,464,933) on June 7, 1993 (issued on November 7, 1995) the group established a pharmaceutical company named Trimeris, Inc. to develop T20 as a fusion inhibitor-based anti-HIV drug. T20 contains a tryptophan-rich motif (TRM) or lipid-binding region (LBD) we therefore believed that T20 needs the LBD to interact with target cell membrane to enhance its interaction with the viral NHR domain. we have shown that T20 can inhibit the formation of the native 6HB on HIV-1-infected cells. the first designed peptides, SC34 and SC35EK, showed activity similar to that of C34, while they interacted with gp41 NHR more strongly and were more soluble than C34. the same strategy was applied to T20 and resulted in T20EK, with 10-fold potent increase compared with T20. sifuvirtide has successfully passed Phase I and II clinical trials in china. the efficacy of sifuvirtide in monotherapy at 20 mg once daily is equivalent to that of enfuvirtide at 90 mg twice daily. but its further development has been terminated with unknown reasons. the third generation CHR-peptides are the modified CHR-peptides with anti-HIV-1 activity more than 50-fold more potent than T20 and C34. the peptide CP32 (residues 621-652) inhibits not only T20-resistant strains, but also C34-resistant strains. MT-hook is widely used in the design of CHR-peptides. the highly stable helical peptide 2P23 has broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against different subtypes of HIV-1, including T20-resistant strains and HP23-resistant strains. the peptides derived from gp41 CHR contain some natural sequences and may crossreact with pre-existing antibodies in the serum of HIV patients. the newly designed peptide was more active than T20 in inhibiting HIV-1 IIIB and Bal infection. it may be that MT and IDL enhance the binding of WQ peptide to NHR PFD and NTHP, respectively. the same team then designed a series of lipopeptides to design LP40 by replacing the T20 C-terminal tryptophan-rich region (TRM) with C16. LP46 has higher inhibitory activity than LP40, with IC50 values down to pM levels. lipopeptides have better activity, half-life and genetic barrier than precursor peptides. many resistant strains against CHR-peptides have emerged, greatly limiting the use of most CHR-peptides. if resistance to lipopeptides will occur in the future is still the focus of our attention. first generation CHR-peptides consist of three peptides derived from the HIV-1 gp41 CHR domain, including SJ-2176 (residues 630-659), DP-178 (residues 638-673), and C34 (residues 628-661) new york blood center filed the patent on SJ-2176 (US Patent 5,444,044) on March 26, 1992. T20 contains a tryptophan-rich motif (TRM) or lipid-binding region (LBD) the second generation CHR-peptides are the mutant peptides of T20 or C34 with anti-HIV-1 activity about 10- to 20-fold more potent than C34. the first designed peptides, SC34 and SC35EK, showed activity similar to that of C34, while they interacted with gp41 NHR more strongly. the same strategy was applied to T20 and resulted in T20EK, with 10-fold potent increase compared with T20. some studies have proved that certain CHR-peptides with high helicity (100%) and stable binding with NHR (Tm value > 100 \u00b0C) show little anti-HIV activity. sifuvirtide is a novel peptide inhibitor developed by Fusogen, Inc. [189] FB006M obtained by chemical modification of the 13th residue of FB006 with MPA is not immunogenic. the half-life of FB006M in rhesus monkeys is more than 100h, which is about 10-fold longer than that of FB006 [192] a 23-residue peptide contains MT-hook and PBD. it has high binding stability and antiviral activity. the peptide 2P23 has broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against different subtypes of HIV-1. a series of long-chain hydrophobic residues at the C-terminus of CHR-peptide WQ (residues 628-653) to target NTHP. the newly designed peptide WQ-IDL was more active than T20 in inhibiting HIV-1 IIIB and Bal infection. lipopeptides exhibited prolonged half-life in vivo than unconjugated peptides, possibly because they can reversibly bind to proteins in serum. the same team then designed a series of lipopeptides to design LP40 by replacing the T20 C-terminal tryptophan-rich region (TRM) with C16. LP52 is a 28 amino acid lipopeptide designed based on the structure-activity relationship of LP40 and LP46. it does not contain PBD and TRM, but its C-terminus is coupled to C16. lipopeptides have better activity, half-life and genetic barrier than precursor peptides. binding to lipids, palmitic acid can also bind to human serum albumin. many glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins are localized in lipid rafts. this again proves that the inclusion of substances capable of binding to lipid membranes in HIV inhibitors is an effective way to increase the activity of inhibitors. the gp41 NHR can interact with a CHR-peptide derived from the gp41 CHR to form 6HB in vitro. it should have inhibitory activity against HIV-1 infection since it can interact with the viral gp41 NHR to form heterologous 6HB. the peptide is designed by replacing the hydrophobic residues at the e, g positions of N36 with hydrophilic residues so that this peptide cannot interact with the viral gp 16-N27Mut(e,g) showed some inhibitory against HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion, but it is about 63-fold lower than that of C16-N27 [202], suggesting that N27 mainly targets the CHR rather than the internal NHR coiled-coil. Efforts have focused on how to enhance NHR-peptide solubility and maintain its natural trimer structure. gp120 and gp41 have potent antiviral activity. some antibodies targeting both gp120 and gp41 can be exposed in solution and that it is a new target. recombinant proteins with multiple targets have improved antiviral activity. bNAb VRC34.01 was derived from HIV-1 chronically infected individuals. it inhibits conformational changes of HIV-1 gp120 and gp41. it also targets the N-terminus of gp41 FP. bNAb ACS202 was isolated from an elite controller infected with HIV-1. mAb CAP248-2B was recently isolated from HIV-1 patients. it is sensitive to antibody-resistant strains targeting gp120 CD4bs in the same patient. however, the neutralization range of CAP248-2B is limited. some strains of gp120 C-terminal mutation can escape its neutralization. sCD4-FIT45 is a bispecific protein in which sCD4 is covalently linked to a 45 amino acid CHR-peptide. sCD4-FIT45 is a bispecific protein in which sCD4 is covalently linked to a 45 amino acid CHR-peptide T45 [231] targeting gp41 NHR. Griff37 consists of a GRFT (griffithsin) targeting gp120 and a peptide C37 (3 more amino acids at the N-terminus of C34) targeting gp41 NHR. it inhibits cell-cell fusion and HIV-1 infection at mid-nanomolar and mid-picomolar levels. 35O22 is a bNAb produced primarily in natural infections. it targets the conserved interface of gp120-gp41. it recognizes the glycosylation sites N88A, N230A, N241A and N625A on the HIV-1 JRCSF strain Env. bNAb ACS202 was isolated from an elite controller infected with HIV-1. it targets the gp120-gp41 interface and FP of gp41 [3,223] and stabilizes the highly unstable Env trimer structure. mAbs 3BC315 and 3BC176 are sensitive to antibody-resistant strains targeting gp120 CD4bs. 248-2B was recently isolated from HIV-1 patients and targeted to the gp120-gp41 contact surface. it contains the C-terminus of gp120 and partially overlaps with the epitopes of PGT151, VRC34, 35O22 and 3BC315 on gp41. however, the neutralization range of mAb M43 is limited. sCD4-FIT45 is a bispecific protein in which sCD4 is covalently linked to a 45 amino acid. sCD4-FIT45 does not cause HIV-1 Env-mediated CD4CCR5+ cell infection. sCD4-FIT45 inhibits cell-cell fusion and HIV-1 infection at mid-nanomolar and mid-picomolar levels. the first peptide-based HIV entry inhibitor, enfuvirtide, was approved for clinical use by the U.S. FDA in 2003. about nine series of protein- and peptide-based HIV entry inhibitors have been developed in pre-clinical and clinical studies. inhibitor IC50 No. of Isolates Target Cells Animal Trials Clinical Phase Reference g/mL nM Inhibitors targeting gp120 CD4bs Proteins D1D2/mD1.2 35/19 a 13 HOS [57] PRO-542 7 a 28 PBMC mice Terminated [53,54] 6Dm2m 0.32 a 41 TZM-bl [58] VRC01 0.33 b 190 TZM-bl inhibitors targeting gp120 variable loops or glycans Proteins F105 NA NHP I [243] 2G12 2.43 c 162 U87 NHP/mice II [89,244,245,246] PG9/ PG16 0.2/0.15 c 177 TZM-bl NHP/mice [95] 10-1074 0.18 d 306 TZM-bl NHP/mice I [21,100,247 ated [189,257,258] SC29EK 9.6 a 7 HeLa [185] T1249 3.44 a 25 TZM-bl NHP Terminated [259,260] T1144 13.9 a 11 PBMC, MT-2 [118,184] FB006M 2.7 a 8 PBMC NHP, mice Approved [192] CP32M 65 a 10 PBMC [193] HP23 4.7 inhibitors targeting gp41 MPER Proteins 2F5 14.6 c 177 TZM-bl NHP/mice II [138,237] 4E10 1.93 c 181 TZM-bl NHP II [138,236] 10E8 0.35 c 180 TZM-bl NHP I [138,236] 10E8v2.0/iMab 0.002 c 118 TZM-bl mice [140] p120- or gp41-specific neutralizing antibodies with high specificity, efficacy and safety have been reported. some of them are already undergoing clinical trials [22,23,138,141]."}
