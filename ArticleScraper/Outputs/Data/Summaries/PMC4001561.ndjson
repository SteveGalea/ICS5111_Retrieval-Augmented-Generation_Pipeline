{"summary": "the status of RSV as a major public health threat has been a primary motivator in the development of antiviral treatment and prophylactic strategies. the current gold standard for at-risk infants is prophylactic administration of the monoclonal antibody palivizumab. however, progress on this front has been modest. a new take on peptide-based prophylaxis and inhibition of RSV infection (11) has the potential to serve as an effective prophylactic strategy for at-risk populations. the peptide mimics one of the fusion helices (i) and binds to RSV-F in the prefusion state (ii) bird et al. adapted the technique of hydrocarbon \u201cstapling\u201d to their choice of antiviral peptide to generate stabilized -helices of RSV-F. by binding to the prefusogenic 3-HB form of RSV-F, the peptide blocks formation of the fusogenic state and thus inhibits fusion and viral entry. the use of a chemical trick to induce and stabilize the -helical structure of a short peptide has overcome a longstanding obstacle in the development of peptides for biological applications. the question of efficacy for antiviral peptides often comes down to the issues of stability and delivery. the nanoparticle-encased peptides were administered intraracheally, delivering the SAH-RSVF peptides directly to the site of pulmonary RSV infection. this led to a striking improvement in viral prophylaxis over peptide alone (11) antiviral treatments."}
