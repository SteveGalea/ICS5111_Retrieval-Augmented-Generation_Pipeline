{"summary": "fungi share many similarities with host cells, which impairs development of antifungal compounds. diseases caused by protozoa, bacteria, and viruses have been recognized as important public health issues for centuries. invasive mycoses were only widely acknowledged as medically important pathogens in the 1980s. more than 1 million eyes go blind each year due to fungal keratitis. nearly one billion people have skin mycoses, which makes this disease only slightly less common on the planet than headaches and dental caries. more than 1.5 million of these individuals are estimated to die from their fungal disease. up to 75 million people have been infected with HIV since the start of the pandemic, resulting in approximately 32 million AIDS-related deaths. tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death among people living with HIV, accounting for about 1 in 3 AIDS-related deaths. meningitis caused by the genus Cryptococcus is (after tuberculosis) the second leading cause of death in people living with HIV. systemic mycoses are neglected diseases despite their alarming impact on human health. neglected tropical diseases can cause severe pain and disability throughout life. there is no clear recognition of the importance of fungal diseases by international health agencies. research on histoplasmosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, and sporotrichosis receives negligible funding. neglected diseases persist due to failures in science, market, and public health. the deadliest fungal infections affect neglected populations. the main drug historically used for the treatment of severe disseminated mycoses is amphotericin B (AmB), whose discovery dates to 1955 [27], and it remains the standard first-line medication for certain fungal infections. liposomal AmB can generate costs of up to US$100,000 per patient in different parts of the globe, including developing countries. 5-Fluorocytosine, a low-cost antimetabolite, is not available and/or registered in many countries, including those highly affected by systemic mycoses. it is more realistic and impactful to make rational use of the diagnostic and antifungal tests already available to minimize the number of deaths caused by fungal diseases. the fungus is an example of an unexpected, emergent fungal disease. it reinforced the perception of the pathogenic potential inherent in the fungal kingdom. the outbreak killed over 60 people out of 750 infected patients. new threats to human health may still occur through climate adaptation mechanisms of zoonotic fungi. the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, currently faces the largest sporotrichosis epidemic in history from a species that emerged locally. a recent survey involving 129 major laboratory centers in 24 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean revealed that only 9% of these centers appear to potentially meet the minimum European Confederation of Medical Mycology standards for fungal laboratory diagnostics. the impact of this condition on human health is clear; the lack of trained personnel is an additional limitation. funding for research on cryptococcal meningitis, the fifth deadliest infectious disease, receives 4.3-fold less funding than the disease caused by the bacterial pathogen Neisseria meningititis [19,20] of concern, reports submitted between 2008 and 2017 on funding for neglected diseases show that cryptococcal meningitis was the only measurably funded fungal disease. there are ongoing initiatives to develop antifungal vaccines and drugs with the potential to control invasive mycoses [46]. the distance between promising laboratory results and the translation of knowledge into benefits to the general population is unquestionably long. in fungal diseases, this distance is apparently longer, considering the lack of investment in science and technology in association with the science, market, and public health failures discussed here. zoonosis can affect humans due to new and as yet unknown zoonosis. they can affect animal health with an impact in the economy. also, they can affect wild animals with an unpredictable ecological impact on biodiversity."}
