{"summary": "salmonella is one of the leading causes of food-borne disease worldwide. outbreaks and sporadic cases have indicated that food vehicles such as poultry and poultry by-products are among the most common sources of Salmonella infections. salmonella Typhimurium (ST) and Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) are major food-borne Salmonella serovars which can colonize or invade the gastrointestinal tract. the roots and rhizomes of the Glycyrrhiza species (licorice) have been widely used as natural sweeteners and herbal medicines. so far, GA has been reported to have anti-viral, anti-cancer, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory activity. increased productions of IL-12 and IFN- in macrophages exhibits a curative effect on several virus infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CV), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) there is no report on the effect of GA on immune function in chickens. there was no detectable endotoxin (0.10 endotoxin units/ml) in the GA samples. stocks of GA were frozen in aliquots of 100 l at 10 mg/ml. HD11 cells seeded into 24-well plates were preincubated with GA (100 g/ml) for 12 h. cells were then washed and incubated with ST (strain CMCC-50115, 2107 colony forming units (CFU)/well) for 1 h at 41 \u00b0C. quantitative and quantitative analyses of RNA were determined by the ratio of absorbance readings at 260 and 280 nm (A 260/A 280) using a nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA) and agarose gel electrophoresis (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) one microgram of total RNA from each sample was reverse-transcripted into complementary DNA (cDNA) following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. sion number CD40 F: GGCACCTTCTCCAATGTATCTCTTC 96 NM_204665 R: GTTCCCTTTCACCTTCAC CD80 F: CAGCAAGCCGAACATAGAAAGA 270 NM_001079739 R: AGCAAACTGGTGAGA CD83 F: TCACTCCTCGGGATT 272 XM_418929 R: TCACTCCTCTCTCA CD197 F: GACGACTATGA BS, GA (25, 50, and 100 g/ml) or LPS (500 ng/ml) for 48 h. equal volumes of cell-free supernatant and Greiss reagent were mixed for 10 min at room temperature. the absorbency was then read at 550 nm by a SpectraMax M5. Statistical analysis Differences were analyzed by two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows. results were expressed as meanstandard deviation (SD of at least three independent experiments. stocks of GA were frozen in aliquots of 100 l at 10 mg/ml. the stock was diluted to the appropriate concentrations in the media indicated by the experiment. HD11 cells seeded into 24-well plates (Corning, 2105 cells/ml) were preincubated with GA (100 g/ml) for 12 h. cells were then washed and incubated with ST (strain CMCC-50115, 2107 colony forming units (CFU)/well) for 1 h at 41 \u00b0C. one microgram of total RNA from each sample was reverse-transcripted into complementary DNA (cDNA) the cDNA samples were then tested for gene expression by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) performed using a stepOne Plus real-time PCR system. each sample was run in triplicate. HD11 cells were seeded into 12-well plates (1106 cells/ml) and pretreated with PBS, GA (25, 50, and 100 g/ml) or LPS (500 ng/ml) for 48 h. then NO production was estimated by the. sulfanilamide, naphthylenediamide and 5% (v/v) phosphoric acid were mixed for 10 min. the absorbency was read at 550 nm by a SpectraMax M5. the actual NO concentration was calculated using a standard curve. ants and cell lysates from cultured cells were analyzed for the production of NO and IFN- gene expression according to the above methods. differences were analyzed by two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows and results were expressed as meanstandard deviation (SD) of at least three independent experiments. HD11 cells were pretreated with GA (25, 50, 100 g/ml) for 12 h. the cells were then infected with ST (2107 CFU/well) for 1 h. the survival rate of ST in GA-pretreated cells decreased by more than two times at 24 h post infection as compared to uninfected cells. GA significantly up-regulated the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40), CD80, CD83 (6 and 12 h) and CD197 (3 and 6 h) (P0.05). also, the mRNA expression of immune-associated cytokines, such as IFN-, LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor (LITAF), IL-6, and IL-10, was observed to be up-regulated in HD11 cells on GA exposure. results are expressed as fold change relative to untreated cells. data are expressed as meanSD for three independent experiments. effects of glycyrrhizic acid (GA) on the productions of nitrite and hydrogen peroxide in chicken macrophages. effects of glycyrrhizic acid (GA) on signaling pathways of chicken macrophages were analyzed by real-time PCR. results are expressed as meanSD for three independent experiments. e HD11 cells were incubated with GA (12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 g/ml) for 48 h. cell viability was determined by the MTT method. glycyrrhizic acid (GA) on phagocytosis and Salmonella-killing activity of chicken macrophages. HD11 cells were pretreated with GA (100 g/ml) for 12 and 24 h. they were then infected with ST (2107 CFU/well) for 1 h. the cells were washed and incubated in RPMI-1640 medium with gentamicin. GA enhanced the expression of both inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and NADPH oxidase-1 (NOX-1). mRNA expression of immune-associated cytokines, such as IFN-, LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- factor, IL-6, and IL-10, was observed to be up-regulated in HD11 cells on GA exposure. HD11 cells were incubated with PBS, GA (25, 50, and 100 g/ml) or LPS (500 ng/ml) for 48 h (NO) or 12 h (H2O2) culture supernatants and cell lysates were collected. data are expressed as meanSD for three independent experiments. effects of glycyrrhizic acid (GA) on signaling pathways of chicken macrophages HD11 cells were pre-treated with NF-B inhibitor (BAY 11-7082, 20 mol/L), JNK inhibitor (SP600125, 20 mol/L), p38 inhibitor (SB203580, 20 mol/L), or ERK1/2 inhibitor (U0126, 20 mol/L) for 30 min followed by the treatment with GA (100 the results verified that GA up-regulated the gene expression of CD40, CD80, CD83, and CD197. CD83 is expressed on the surface of mature dendritic cells. this induction of CD83 as well as costimulatory molecules (e.g. CD80) on macrophages suggested that GA could enhance the ability of macrophages to favor T lymphocyte activation. similar results were obtained from an in vitro study. 1-4 mannobiose enhanced the productions of NO and H2O2. IFN- is involved in the activation of macrophages and T lymphocytes. NF-B and JNK pathway inhibition potently down-regulated the GA-induced NO production and IFN- expression in stimulated cells. ERK1/2 inhibitor markedly increased NO production in murine bone marrow derived dendritic cells. findings indicated that NF-B and JNK activation are required for GA-activated chicken macrophages."}
