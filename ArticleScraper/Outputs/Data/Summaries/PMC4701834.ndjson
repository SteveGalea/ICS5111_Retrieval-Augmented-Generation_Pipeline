{"summary": "core inhibitor ST-148 was identified in a high-throughput screen. drug-resistant viruses can be readily selected because mutations preexist in the inoculum. these preexisting variants can be selected in the absence of potentially dominant wild-type proteins. total viral RNA was extracted from supernatants and quantified by qRT-PCR. amplicons of 476 bp were generated by bulk RT-PCR from RNA extracted from supernatants of singly or doubly infected BHK-21 cells. wild-type virus had been engineered to contain a silent AflII restriction site. the amount of the C-S34L mutant virus was kept constant at an average of 1 FFU (focus-forming unit) per cell. the number of wild-type viruses per cell ranged from 0 to an average of 3 FFU/cell. after one cycle of infection, 24 h, supernatants were harvested and yields of total and resistant virus were determined. the most likely mechanism for the ability of drug-susceptible core protein to inhibit the function of drug-resistant core protein is the formation of chimeric oligomers. the wild-type core protein was predominately associated with cytoplasmic membranes in the absence of ST-148. the wild-type, drug-susceptible phenotype is dominant over the drug-resistant phenotype in the presence of ST-148. that the drug-resistant protein fractionates differently when in the presence of the drug-susceptible protein. mutants in the NS5 methyltransferase domain confer resistance to the nucleoside inhibitor MK-0608. the nucleoside analog 2\u2032-C-methyl-7-deaza-adenosine (also called MK-0608, or 7-DMA) was originally developed as an inhibitor of hepatitis C virus polymerase (14) but also displays antiviral activity against dengue virus serotype 2 in cultured cells. NS5-Y201H mutations conferred significant resistance to MK-0608 compared to wild-type virus. both mutations mapped to the methyltransferase domain of the NS5 protein. it is likely either that MK-0608 inhibits methyltransferase activity or that allosteric interactions between the methyltransferase and the polymerase domains relieve MK-0608\u2019s inhibition at the polymerase active site. residues A60 and Y201 of serotype 2 aligned with residues A60 and H200 of serotype 3. the methyltransferase domain of NS5 is shown in yellow, and GDD residues at the polymerase active site are shown in blue. the growth of a fixed amount (1 FFU/cell) of drug-resistant virus was monitored either alone or in the presence of various amounts of wild-type, drug-susceptible virus. supernatant titers were then determined in the absence of MK-0608, to measure the amount of total virus, and in the presence of 50 M MK-0608, to measure the amount of resistant virus. drug-resistant viruses replicated in the presence of the drug. yield of total and drug-resistant virus and RNA was determined by restriction digestion of PCR products (Fig. 1). as with virus, more total RNA accumulated with increasing amounts of total input virus. treatment of mice with ST-148 does not lead to selection of drug-resistant viruses. male and female age-matched mice were retro-orbitally infected with 105 FFU/mouse and treated with 40 mg/kg MK-0608 or 50 mg/kg ST-148 twice daily. each point represents the result for an individual mouse. open symbols indicate MK-0608-treated mice with a total virus yield lower than any observed upon ST-148 treatment. spleen homogenates from control and ST-148-treated mice were diluted and used to infect fresh monolayers of BHK-21 cells in the presence of ST-148. the amount of drug resistance observed correlated somewhat with the amount of selection pressure exerted (Fig. 5B to D, open symbols) however, this alone does not explain the large increase in resistance observed in MK-0608-treated mice. anti-dengue virion antibody recognizes all four serotypes of dengue virus was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA) anti-core antibody was a kind gift from Andrea Gamarnik (Instituto Leloir, Argentina) anti-mitofilin antibody was purchased from Proteintech (Chicago, IL) proteins from each fraction were methanol precipitated, resuspended in 8 M urea, 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.8) and quantified using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) immunoblotting. cell lysates were separated by gel electrophoresis on 12.5% or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride (P the resulting amplicon was purified using the NucleoSpin extract II and PCR cleanup kit. the resulting products were run in 1% agarose\u2013Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) gels. titrations were conducted on BHK-21 cells as described by Mateo et al. (30) supernatants were used to infect fresh monolayers of BHK cells. this cycle was repeated for 22 passages, using an MOI of less than 0.1 FFU per cell for each passage. pooled viral RNA from each resulting population was sequenced. mice were housed in individually ventilated cages and provided with irradiated cages, irradiated food, and UV-irradiated water. 107 FFU of virus was injected retro-orbitally into anesthetized mice in a volume of 100 l. viral populations from spleens of mice treated with vehicle or drug were used for ex vivo amplification. infections were allowed to proceed for 48 h, after which supernatants were harvested."}
