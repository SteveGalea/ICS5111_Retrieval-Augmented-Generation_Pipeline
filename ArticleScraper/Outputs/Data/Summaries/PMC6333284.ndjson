{"summary": "interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) is critical to the first line of defense against invading viruses: the host innate immune response. the binding of these secreted IFNs to the IFN- receptor activates transcription pathways leading to the synthesis of IFN-stimulated genes, including ISG15. extracellular ISG15 has several immunomodulatory activities such as the induction of natural killer cell proliferation and the stimulation of IFN- production. the importance of ISG15 can also be observed through the efforts of viruses to directly engage ISG15. in nairoviruses, a viral homologue of an ovarian tumor domain protease is encoded in the viral L protein along with the viral RNA polymerase. a mutated vOTU lacking deISGylase activity led to lower levels of L protein, suggesting that ISG15 conjugation may destabilize it or lead to degradation. both nairovirus vOTUs and coronavirus PLPs have been observed to exhibit significant sensitivity to ISG15 species differences in their binding interfaces. scant structural information has been available outside its human homologue. vesper bat (M. davidii; accession No. ELK23605.1), brandt\u2019s bat (M. brandtii; accession No. XM_005871298.2), little brown bat (M. lucifugus; accession No. XP_014306702.1), large flying fox (Pteropus vampyrus; accession No. XM_011386042.2), Chinese horseshoe bat (Rouse some viral deISGylases, such as vOTUs, have only been observed to bind to the C-terminal domain of ISG15s. other viral proteins have been demonstrated to interact with both domains. species\u2013species differences that have an impact on ISG15\u2013protein interactions may go beyond simple surface replacement. vesper bat originates from the Myotis genus, which has over 120 members spread over six continents. structure highlights presence of conserved hydrophobic patch common to ISG15s in domain\u2013domain interactions. OD600 of 0.6\u20130.8, isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.8 mM. cells expressing PLpro were grown overnight at 25\u00b0C. those expressing the ISG15s were grown overnight at 18\u00b0C. bISG15s were dialyzed overnight at 4\u00b0C in buffer C. they were subsequently purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a superdex 200 column. cells expressing SARS-CoV PLpro were lysed in buffer E. bISG15 was concentrated to 16 mg ml1 in buffer D prior to screening against a series of NeXtal suites from Qiagen. the initial screen yielded crystals in a condition consisting of 100 mM citric acid pH 4.0, 20% polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000) a data set for bISG15 was collected on the SER-CAT beamline ID-22 at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, Illinois, USA) using a wavelength of 1 and an MX300-HS detector. the data set was indexed, integrated and scaled using HKL-2000. 167 Rotation range per image (\u00b0) 1.00 Total rotation range (\u00b0) 250 Exposure time per image (s) 0.5 Space group I212121 a, b, c () 66.5, 68.4, 72.5, (\u00b0) 90.0, 90.0, 90.0, 90.0 Resolution range () 50\u20131.37 (1.39\u20131.37) Total No. of reflections 730455 No. of unique reflections 34845 Completeness (%) 99.1 (96.5) Multiplicity all ISG15s and SARS-CoV PLpro were dialyzed overnight at 4\u00b0C in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 M ZnCl2 was included to maintain the stability of the PLpro. all results and the associated statistics were obtained from at least two independent experiments. isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.8 mM. cells expressing the ISG15s from bat and human were grown overnight at 25\u00b0C. the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000g for 10 min and were frozen at 80\u00b0C until use. bISG15s were eluted with buffer B supplemented with 300 mM imidazole. they were then dialyzed overnight at 4\u00b0C in buffer C. they were then purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a superdex 200 column. SARS-CoV PLpro was eluted from the column using ten column volumes of buffer E supplemented with 300 mM imidazole. the protease was dialyzed overnight against buffer F (100 mM NaCl, 5 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 2 mM DTT) and further purified by size exclusion using a superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in buffer F. a data set for bISG15 was collected using a wavelength of 1 and an MX300-HS detector. initial solution of the bISG15 structure was obtained by molecular replacement with Phaser. resolution range () 24.52\u20131.37 (1.40\u20131.37) Completeness (%) 98.7 (95.85) No. of reflections, working set 32946 No. of reflections, test set 1894 Final R cryst 0.161 Final R free 0.196 No. of non-H atoms Protein 1314 Water 196 Total 1510 R.m.s. deviations Bonds (%) 0 2.3. Site-directed mutagenesis Mutants were generated using site-directed all ISG15s and SARS-CoV PLpro were dialyzed overnight at 4\u00b0C in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 M ZnCl2. results were obtained from at least two independent experiments. -replacement solution for bISG15 was obtained in space group I212121. the search model was derived from the recently elucidated structure of mISG15. the interdomain interactions of ISG15s may more closely reflect those of mISG15. structure of bISG15 shown in cartoon rendering. comparing each domain of bISG15 with its counterpart in mISG15 and hISG15 reveals root-mean-square deviations. bISG15 contains ten -strands, two -helices and four 310-helices. the secondary structure of bISG15 comprises ten -strands, two -helices and four 310-helices. previously an anionic ridge was observed in hISG15 but not in mISG15. most common residue found at position 140 in ISG15s is glycine, followed by negatively charged aspartic acid and glutamic acid. the remainder is composed mostly of polar residues. the surface charge in this area is constantly negative in all three ISG15s. ISG15s from bat, mouse and human were overlaid using a least-squares fit of the residues comprising the C-terminal domain of each structure. a noticeable difference in the twist about the C-terminal and N-terminal domains becomes apparent. mISG15 and hISG15 are not able to replicate the tight turn present in bISG15. other mammalian ISG15s, such as that of the northern tree shrew, do have the biochemical ability to form this turn. hISG15 contains a nonconserved histidine that has been suggested to stabilize its conformation. mISG15 has been observed to have a higher degree of flexibility in its domain\u2013domain arrangements, suggesting that the barriers for mISG15 to adopt the bISG15 confirmation may be lower. however, the lack of the stabilizing reverse-turn motif in mISG15 would suggest that this conformation may not be as energetically stable for mISG15. isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was employed using SARS-CoV PLpro as a probe. this species of bat was not individually investigated as a host for SARS-CoV. he40 site is highly conserved and at the center of what structurally appears to be a hydrophobic interdomain interaction. modification of site would not directly impact the SARS-CoV PLpro interface but only the ability of the ISG15 domains to interact and present the proposed interface to the protease. hISG15 with its predicted binding-interface residues with SARS-CoV PLpro colored red and the sites of Phe41 and His39 colored green. the line shows the best fit to an independent model. lysine mutation in hISG15 equivalent to position 40 in bISG15 led to the most striking decrease in affinity. however, the decrease was more pronounced in hISG15, resulting in the K d being too large to determine. phenylalanine was replaced by alanine within the two ISG15s. only an entropic penalty was observed in relation to the ISG15\u2013SARS-CoV PLpro binding events. the affinity of hISG15 carrying a H39P mutation for SARS-CoV PLpro was obtained. the impact of the H39P mutation may suggest that interdomain interactions could stabilize one orientation of the two ISG15 domains that are sliding across a hydro\u00adphobic interface. the reverse-turn motif found in M. davidii appears to be limited to the Myotis genus within known bat ISG15 sequences. a partial ISG15 sequence from M. lucifugus (accession No. XP_014306702) possesses this motif. other bats may behave differently in relation to their domain\u2013domain orientation flexibility. the variable region in this domain shows more variability between species of bat than the C-terminal domain. within the Myotis genus the N-terminal domain is actually more conserved than its C-terminal counterpart. only four of the 12 residues that are not perfectly conserved are located in the N-terminal domain. initial diamond-shaped crystals were obtained using a mixture of PEG 6000 and citric acid. final crystal conditions were obtained using gradient and additive screening. a molecular-replacement solution for bISG15 was obtained in space group I212121. structure of bISG15 shown in cartoon rendering. comparing each domain of bISG15 with its counterpart in mISG15 and hISG15. root-mean-square deviations (r.m.s.d.s.d.s) of 2.1 and 1.6 respectively, for the N-terminal domain and 1.0 and 1.0, respectively, for the C-terminal domain. bISG15 contains four 310-helices (two per domain) as in hISG15 instead of the two 310-helices found in mISG15. in other animals residue 126 is most commonly a glutamate or a glutamine, and in rarer cases a glycine. the most common residue found at position 140 in ISG15s is glycine, followed by the negatively charged aspartic acid and glutamic acid. the structures of hISG15 (green), mISG15 (purple) and bISG15 (blue) are superimposed using the least-squares fit of residues comprising the C-terminal domain of the respective proteins. close-up views of the hinge region of ISG15s from bat, mouse and human. mISG15 and hISG15 have a type I reverse turn that separates bISG15 from mISG15 and hISG15. hISG15 contains a nonconserved histidine that has been suggested to stabilize its conformation. hISG15 contains a nonconserved histidine that has been suggested to stabilize its conformation. mISG15 would likely be an intermediate that hISG15 would have to pass through in order to attain the bISG15 interdomain arrangement. mISG15 has been observed to have a higher degree of flexibility in its domain\u2013domain arrangements, suggesting that the barriers for mISG15 to adopt the bISG15 confirmation may be lower. other viral proteins have been observed to engage additional regions of ISG15. these include coronavirus proteases, host ISGylation proteins and nonstructural protein 1B from influenza B. isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was employed as a probe. the affinity of SARS-CoV PLpro for bISG15 was compared with the affinity of SARS-CoV PLpro for various bISG15s containing mutations at the Phe40 site. however, modification of this site would not directly impact the SARS-CoV PLpro interface but only the ability of the ISG15 domains to interact.
