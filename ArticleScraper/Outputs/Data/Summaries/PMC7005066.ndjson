{"summary": "the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is crucial for maintaining cellular calcium homeostasis. the rough ER working with membrane-bound ribosomes produces the protein and continues protein assembly. the smooth ER synthesizes lipids, phospholipids, and steroids. the activation of three main molecules of UPR induces autophagy via regulation of ATG genes (8). the spliced XBP-1 directly binds to beclin-1 gene promotor region (10) another clearance mechanism to degrade the accumulation of misfolded proteins is the ERAD pathway. eIF2 dephosphorylation causes cells to die due to ER stress. deregulated CHOP expression promotes apoptosis (17). ER stress is associated with pathogenesis of diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, inflammatory diseases. the UPR regulates immune cell differentiation, activation, and cytokine production. the immunostimulant lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces inflammatory cytokine production. the IRE1-XBP-1 pathway activates production of TNF and IL-6 in macrophages. the increased levels of ROS triggered by ER stress activate proinflammatory signals. the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB regulates the immune response of the host. ER stress exerts immunogenic effects, suggesting that ER stress exerts immunogenic effects. the cytotoxin subtilase, produced by Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli, cleaves BiP. ER-stress-mediated apoptosis by inducing release of Ca2+ from the ER to the cytosol and upregulating PERK-CHOP-mediated DR5. co-translocated calreticulin and ERp57 form a complex with TNFR1 and CXCR1 in the plasma membrane, leading to apoptosis, and suppression of intracellular Mtb. the interaction of Par-4 and BiP leads to apoptosis by inducing Mtb-mediated ER stress and activating the FADD/caspase-8/-3 pathway. mycobacterial Infection and ER Stress Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), does not produce toxins, and grows very slowly. however, Mtb infection induces ER stress in host cells. ER stress and the UPR are reported not to protect against infection by reovirus and hepatitis B virus but to promote their replication. the PERK pathway is important for host antiviral defense (61) regulation of the phosphorylation of eIF2 is important for the survival of enveloped viruses. west Nile virus and coxsackie virus B3 induce ER-stress-mediated apoptosis by promoting the synthesis of CHOP (66, 67). IRE1 is reportedly essential for induction of autophagy during infection with infectious bronchitis virus. further investigation of the ER stress response would enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of viral infection. ER stress is also important for biofilm formation, microcolony aggregation, distribution, and spread of GAS during infection of soft tissues (42). ER stress is also important for biofilm formation, microcolony aggregation, distribution, and spread of GAS during infection of soft tissues (42). enhancement of the UPR by co-stimulation with IFN- promotes the replication of B. abortus in host cells (48). it has been known that different ER stress sensors are activated during bacterial infection (11) mycobacterial infection induces an ER-stress response due to accumulation of misfolded or unfolded TNF- in the ER. activation of the RIDD pathway suppresses the intracellular growth of mycobacteria. ER stress and the UPR are reported not to protect against infection by reovirus and hepatitis B. viral infection induces ER stress and the UPR, which promotes cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis. IRE1 activates RIDD to promote the degradation of ER-localized mRNAs. ire1 activates RIDD to promote the degradation of ER-localized mRNAs. the results of such efforts are likely to lead to the development of novel host-derived therapeutics for infection by multidrug-resistant bacteria or emerging viruses. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
