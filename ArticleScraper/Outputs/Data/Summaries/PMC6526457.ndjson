{"summary": "ex vivo models provide an important bridge between in vitro and in vivo experiments. agarose-inflated lung slices can be kept viable in culture for at least seven days post-necropsy of an experimental animal. the combination of viable lung slices with recombinant viruses expressing fluorescent reporter proteins allows for accurate, sensitive and reproducible assessment of respiratory virus infection. slices can be prepared by hand using microtome blades and cultured in 6- or 24-well plates with culture medium. slices are subsequently inoculated with infectious virus (E) and infection of the slices is followed in time (F). protocols approved by independent animal experimentation ethical review committee in the Netherlands. animal welfare observed on a daily basis. dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM; Lonza Bio-Whittaker, Basel, Switserland; Cat. no.: 12500062); Glutamax (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA; Cat. no.: 35050-061); Fetal bovine serum (FBS; Lonza Bio-Whittaker, Basel, Switserland; Cat. no.: 14-501GM); Penicillin (100 U ED2SS; Paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; Cat. no.: 441244). 2.2. Materials Hydroxyethylagarose, Type VII, low gelling temperature. Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM; Lonza Bio-Whittaker, Basel, Switserland; Cat. no.: 12500062); Glutamax (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA; Cat. no.: 35050-061); Fetal bovine serum (FBS; Lonza Bio-Whittaker, Basel, Switserland; Cat. no.: DE17-602E); Amphotericin CRITICAL STEP Prepare 4% (w/v) low-melting point agarose by dissolving agarose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and boil for several minutes (e.g., using a microwave oven, be careful for boiling over) inflation through the primary bronchus is more efficient. fill a syringe with a 42 \u00b0C pre-warmed 1:1 mixture of 4% (w/v) low-melting point agarose and lung slice medium. final agarose percentage is 2% (w/v) CRITICAL STEP Avoid the formation of air bubbles in the agarose. time for completion: 1 h Transfer lungs to biosafety cabinet, remove the clamp, prepare a surface for cutting (cutting board or Petri dish) and microtome blade. prepare lungs for slicing by finding anatomically interesting locations. we typically use 1\u20135 105 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose-50 (TCID50) per slice. after 1 h, add an appropriate volume of lung slice medium (inoculum can be washed away) slices can be held viable (based on beating cilia in epithelium) and followed in time for a maximum of 7 days. slices should be checked for fluorescence on a daily basis. use an emission filter to visualize fluorescence macroscopically. use an inverted UV microscope or confocal laser scanning microscope. selectively stain for example T-cells, B-cells, natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, granulocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages or epithelial cells. slices can be directly stained for confocal laser scanning microscopy (Section 3.7.1) or fixed for immunohistochemistry (Section 3.7.2) a macaque lung slice infected with a paramyxovirus is shown. the method can also be used to screen the lungs of in vivo virus-infected animals. the method can also be used to screen the lungs of infected animals. slices can be inflated with 1:1 mixture of 4% (w/v) low-melting point agarose and lung slice medium. prepare a 1:1 mixture of 4% (w/v) low-melting point agarose and 4% (w/v) PFA in PBS. inflation through the trachea works best, but for larger animals, inflation through the primary bronchus is more efficient. fill a syringe with a 1:1 mixture of 4% (w/v) low-melting point agarose and lung slice medium (DMEM/Ham\u2019s F12 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, l-glutamine and amphotericin B) the volume used for inflation should be slightly higher than the tidal volume of the animal. remove needle but keep the clamp positioned on the trachea or bronchus. prepare the lungs for slicing by finding anatomically interesting locations. slices can also be infected after 24 h of culture at 37 \u00b0C in 5% (v/v) CO2. we have never observed discrepancies between obtained results after either direct infection or overnight culture. bronchus with cilia under a normal light microscope. movement of cilia is indicative of viable epithelial cells. time for completion: up to 7 days If fluorescent reporter viruses were used, slices should be checked for fluorescence on a daily basis. cells that migrate out of the lung slices are mainly lymphoid, myeloid or epithelial in origin. a fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) staining for specific cell types can be performed at this point. confocal laser scanning microscopy of lung slice infected with a paramyxovirus expressing a fluorescent reporter protein (green) a macaque lung slice infected with a paramyxovirus is shown. time for Completion: 2 h Fix lung slices by transferring slices into new plates pre-filled with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. CRITICAL STEP Not all fluorophores are well-preserved by fixation. slices are transferred into new plates pre-filled with 10% (v/v) formalin or directly boxing slices into cassettes kept in formalin. the method can also be used to screen the lungs of in vivo virus-infected animals for infection. slices can be inflated with 1:1 mixture of 4% (w/v) low-melting point agarose and lung slice medium and kept in culture for a period of time after necropsy. viable lung slices from potentially any species can be obtained for ex vivo experiments. infections with respiratory viruses of lung slices are normally relatively successful. vivo experiments in animal models of disease are of crucial importance for viral tropism and pathogenesis studies. however, these experiments must be complemented with proper in vitro and ex vivo experiments."}
