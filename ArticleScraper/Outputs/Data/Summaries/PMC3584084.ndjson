{"summary": "bioaerosol rated research shows exposure to bioaerosols naturally occurring or intentionally released has been shown to cause various adverse health effects[1]\u2013[6]. a number of biological aerosol sampling devices were invented including an all-glass impinger [11], a device utilizing the electrical force[12], and a critical-orifice liquid Impinger [13]. biostage impactor (SKC), the sixth stage of Andersen six-stage sampler, is widely used. use of bare agar plate for collecting culturable bioaerosols would dry agar surface over a prolonged sampling time. due to the high particle impaction velocity, the particle could be embedded directly into the agar medium, which could inhibit their growth and detection. use of mineral oil could also reduce the desiccation on those bioaerosols already collected and embedded into the mineral oil. this extra step would lead to a loss of mineral oil on the strip in addition to possible contamination. the bioStage impactor is the sixth stage of the Andersen six-stage sampler. it has a cutoff size of 0.65, 1.1, 2.1, 3.3, 4.7 and 7.0 m. the bioStage impactor can continuously vacuum air for 4 h. the use of mineral-oil-spread agar plates and regular ones were alternated. at least three independent experiments were conducted in each of the environments studied. for the environmental sampling, we left the samplers alone when they were started. at least three independent experiments were conducted with each bacterial species. for the aerosolized bacterial species, they were in a small size range (0.6\u20131.0 m) if not in aggregates, thus most of them would be collected by the last stage of the six-stage sampler. bioaerosol concentration levels obtained by mineral-oil-spread agar plates and those regular ones were checked for normality by Shapiro-Wilk test. the equality of variances of the variable was also checked using independent sample t-tests through the SPSS 16.0 software. petri dish plate for bacteria and Malt Extract Agar for fungi. a mineral oil film of 180 m thick was formed on the agar plate. the aerosolized bacterial species were then collected using the BioStage impactor at 28.3 L/min alternately with mineral-oil-spread agar plates and regular ones for 5, 10 and 20 min. the extra airflow for the biostage impactor was compensated by the clean air inside the cabinet. the OPC measures particle number concentration by optical size from 0.3 to 20 m in 15 channels (GRIMM) the biostage impactor was operated with a two-way tubing which connects to the OPC at 1.2 L/min and the vacuum pump at 28.3 L/min. indoor bacterial aerosol sampling for 10 min using the Andersen six-stage sampler in conjunction with mineral-oil-spread and regular agar plates. the protective effect was found more pronounced for the stage 4 of the sampler, about 97% enhancement. this difference is likely due to the differences in impaction stress, particle size, species composition and environments. aerosols 0.243 0.003 0.003 Outdoor bacterial aerosols 0.002 0.000 0.000 Outdoor fungal aerosols 0.007 0.000 0.000 B. subtilis aerosols 0.007 0.000 0.000 E. coli aerosols 0.008 0.003 0.000 Figure 1. different stages of the Andersen sampler impart different impaction stress. different species respond to the sampling stress differently. in natural environments bacterial particles could appear in aggregates or harbor on larger non-biological particles. this possibility could make differentiating aggregates from single cells difficult. different from indoor sampling, all sampling times for outdoors were found to result in a statistical difference between mineral oil and agar plates. this might be due to species compositions and their different sensitivity to the sampling stress in different environments. in different environments, Gram-positive (G+) and Gram-negative (G-) bacteria might account for different percentages. Biological collection efficiencies of BioStage impactor together with agar plate and mineral-oil-spread agar plate in sampling aerosolized E. coli aerosols. similar results were observed when sampling aerosolized B. subtilis and E. coli under different sampling times (5, 10 and 20 min) increasing sampling time also led to the decrease of culturable E. coli and B. subtilis counts given only mineral-oil-spread agar plates used. for environmental bioaerosols, the enhancement was found relatively lower for 5 min sampling time. use of the mineral-oil-spread agar strip resulted in about 4\u201312 times higher culturable bacterial aerosol concentration compared to the use of agar strips with the Andersen type sampler[22]. besides, we also performed similar experiments with fungal aerosols using the Andersen six-stage and the BioStage impactor in the same environments. different sampling times for outdoor fungal aerosols with the BioStage impactor resulted in a statistical difference between mineral oil and agar plates. the difference between indoor and outdoor fungal aerosol samplings was likely due to their different particle size, species compositions and their sensitivity to the further stress. extended sampling time up to 6 h did not affect culturability of certain fungal species by the filtration sampling method at a composting site. spores were also shown desiccation resistant as extended sampling did not reduce the culturability. the observed low recovery for fungal spores with AGI-30 sampler is likely due to the high impaction stress caused by the impingement process. bioaerosol particles being collected by the last stage of the Andersen sampler have stayed in the sampling line for longer time compared to those for the BioStage impactor. as a result of these differences, the bioaerosol particles might have experienced more stress for last stage of the Andersen sampler compared to the BioStage impactor. the recovery enhancement was shown to depend on bioaerosol size, type, sampling time and environment. it appears that more fungal recoveries were attributed to reduced impaction stress, while those for bacteria were likely arising from particle bounce reduction. standard bioaerosol sampler since its invention in 1950s has been extensively applied in various applications. but subsequent improvements for its problems such as particle bounce and desiccation have not been attempted. traditional use of regular plate with the Andersen type impactors significantly underestimates actual bioaerosol loads.
