{"summary": "genome sequencing has had a transformative effect on the field of phylodynamics. despite its utility, whole genome sequencing of pathogens has not been adopted universally. targeted sequencing of loci is common in some pathogen-specific fields. trees were inferred in RAxML [63] with ancestral state reconstruction performed in TreeTime [64]. inferred phylogenies consistent with Bayesian results presented in Fig. 1. the correct location of each tip is outlined in white with the smaller plot to the right showing only the probability of the correct location. bars marked with an open circle indicate cases where the correct location is within the 95% credible set and solid circles indicate cases where the correct location is also the correct location. genomes still perform better in terms of correct guess (0.432 probability that best guess location is true location for genomes versus 0.259 for GP), cross entropy (12012.800 nats for genome each cell shows the difference between genome (red, bottom of cell) and GP (blue, top of cell) data for various statistics reported in this study. descriptions for each statistic are given at the bottom of the cell near the x-axis."}
