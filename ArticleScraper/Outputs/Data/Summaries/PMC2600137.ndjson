{"summary": "opportunistic and targeted field surveys were conducted. archival collections link surveys, informatics, phylogenies, history, biogeography, and ecology to form long-term baselines for exploring biodiversity and the evolutionary and ecological determinants of infectious disease emergence. to identify parasite species in wildlife across extensive geographic ranges in remote northern locations, we developed molecular probes for the identification of larval parasites in feces. to identify parasite species in wildlife across extensive geographic ranges in remote northern locations, we developed molecular probes for the identification of larval parasites in feces. ylus, and Cystocaulus do not naturally occur in North America and have not yet been introduced (20), with exception of Elaphostrongylus rangiferi. diversity and distribution of hosts and pathogens in the North have been structured by dynamic climate change during the past 3 million years through alternating cycles of glaciation/deglaciation and isolation/expansion (10,22) extirpation and reduction to a remnant population in the early 1900s. deeper historical processes account for widespread distribution of the lungworm P. stilesi in wild sheep. the muscleworm P. stilesi has a more heterogeneous distribution in wild sheep. disease associated with macroparasites is often sublethal and difficult to detect. this is especially true in the north where the sheer size and diversity of the geographic areas, low densities and isolation of human communities hamper year-round observation of illness and death in wildlife. infections of Parelaphostrongylus andersoni have been linked to verminous pneumonia in barren-ground caribou in Alaska and canada. the potential for protostrongylids to cause disease in individual hosts is apparent, but unequivocal evidence linking infection to decline in population health, numbers, or both remains to be demonstrated. future work may be limited to modeling the effects of these parasites on host populations. the core region for our studies (the Mackenzie District of the Northwest Territories) had the highest rate of warming in Canada. a model for temperature and rates of larval development in gastropod intermediate hosts was validated for these protostrongylids and applied to climate warming scenarios (6,7) international Polar year is a unique opportunity to address a critical need for baselines and archives needed to detect and explore drivers for infectious disease emergence in northern systems. odocoilei was first detected in wild sheep in the Mackenzie Mountains in 1999, although this may reflect increased vigilance. the Beringian Coevolution Project (9,18; http://nix.msb.unm.edu; http://wildlife1.usask.ca/iwap/abstracts/galb.html) and the Circumarctic Rangifer Monitoring and Assessment Network (rangifer.net/carma/index.html; http://classic.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php\"id=16 climate change will affect northern ecosystems by altering host range (i.e., expansions, shifts, increased or decreased overlap), abundance, and resilience, in addition to availability of environmental contaminants, free-living stages of pathogens, and intermediate hosts/vectors. environmental change is predicted to drive increased dissemination of zoonotic pathogens in water- and foodborne pathways. extreme weather events of temperature and humidity are predicted to result in a mosaic of emergence of disease against this broader background. we seek to emphasize the generalities for processes of emergence for both animal and human pathogens, and offer an approach that may serve as a universal framework to understand, anticipate, and forecast change in these complex systems. archival collections link surveys, informatics, phylogenies, history, biogeography, and ecology to form long-term baselines. such baselines allow tracking of changes in pathogen diversity and genetics, as well as differentiation between new detection and true emergence of diseases. we developed molecular probes for the identification of larval parasites in feces. we detected at least 1 new protostrongylid species in moose, muskoxen, and caribou. these fell within the category of emergence of new recognition of a pathogen. the diversity and distribution of hosts and pathogens in the North have been structured by dynamic climate change during the past 3 million years through alternating cycles of glaciation/deglaciation and isolation/expansion (10,22). Increasingly cold climate during the Pliocene and Pleistocene periods may have further influenced selection of an Arctic-adapted fauna with its own unique developmental constraints and environmental tolerances (10,22) the muscleworm P. odocoilei has a more heterogeneous distribution in wild sheep because these hosts were colonized relatively recently (late Pleistocene) in a host-switching event from deer (Odocoileus hemionus), probably when the 2 species were concentrated in glacial refugia. knowledge of phylogeny of pathogens provides powerful insights about life cycles, host specificity, and site specificity within the host and the potential for emergence local community members and hunters created a network of \u201cwildlife health monitors\u201d. they are trained to collect standardized samples and data to develop baselines for wildlife health over time. infected animals exhibit epistaxis and may be more susceptible to predation. the potential for protostrongylid parasites to cause disease in individual hosts is apparent, but unequivocal evidence linking infection to decline in population health, numbers, or both remains to be demonstrated. future work may be limited to modeling the effects of these parasites on host populations and monitoring causes of illness and death in natural populations. climate change precipitated a switch from a multiyear to single-year cycle of transmission for U. pallikuukensis. fatal pneumonia associated with P. odocoilei was first detected in wild sheep in the Mackenzie Mountains in 1999. international Polar Year is a unique opportunity to address a critical need for baselines and archives needed to detect and explore drivers for infectious disease emergence in northern systems. opportunistic survey has moved from targeted surveillance and hypothesis-driven research to targeted surveillance. a 10-year baseline for wildlife health across a region of northern north America increasingly vulnerable to climate change and other drivers of infectious disease emergence. a 10-year baseline for wildlife health across a region of northern north America increasingly vulnerable to climate change and other drivers of infectious disease emergence. environmental change is predicted to drive increased dissemination of zoonotic pathogens in water- and foodborne pathways. effects of climate change may be cumulative and play out over decades. extreme weather events of temperature and humidity are predicted to result in a mosaic of ephemeral or explosive emergence of disease against this broader background. pathogens, or diseases originating in wildlife, are emerging as a considerable threat to human health worldwide (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome, HIV/AIDS, Ebola, Hendra, Nipah, and avian influenza viruses) the North has emerged as a region of great interest because of the historical interaction between people and wildlife."}
