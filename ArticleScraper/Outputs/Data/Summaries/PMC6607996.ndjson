{"summary": "traditional Tc1 and Tc2 CD8+ T cells play overlapping and different roles in tumor immunity [1], viral infection [2], and some allergic diseases [3]. transferring CD8+CD28 T cells into CD8deficient mice can suppress development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [7]. cMaf [25], stat1 [26] and stat3 [27] have been reported to be involved in IL10 transcription regulation in the LPS signal transduction pathway. cdkn2a locus in mouse encodes two distinct tumorsuppressor proteins: p19ARF and p16INK4a [29]. p19ARF regulates p53 in response to aberrant growth or oncogenic stresses. murine colitis is an experimental model to be used to study the pathogenesis and therapy of human IBD. a combination of TNBS and colonic proteins induces excessive production of IFN by Th1 cells. this activates monocytes/macrophages to produce a series of cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF and IL6. mice were crossed with 10BiT mice to obtain Cdkn2a/.10BiT mice. all animals were maintained under specific pathogenfree conditions at Nankai University.

IL4 induced a significantly higher number of GFP+CD8+ T cells. IL4 promotes CD8+ T cell differentiation into IL10producing cells. tiger and 10BiT mice showed similar results. IL4 promotes CD8+ T cell differentiation into IL10producing cells. GFP+CD8+ T cells and GFPCD8+ T cells from A were sorted for IL10 mRNA quantification by realtime PCR. data are shown as the mean + sem of three replicate measurements from three independent experiments. gene expression analysis comparing GFP+CD8+ and GFPCD8+ T cells from the above cultures. cDNA microarray was performed to compare the broad gene profiles between these two types of CD8+ T cells. IL10producing CD8+ T cells express higher levels of IL4, IL5, CCL3, CCL4 and perforin. IL10producing CD8+ T cells suppress CD4+ T cell proliferation through IL10 and cell contactdependent mechanisms. Nave CD4+ T cells from B6 WT mice were sorted, labeled with CFSE, mixed with APCs (5:1 ratio) cells were stimulated with soluble antiCD3 (2 g/ml) + IL2 (2 ng/ml) after 72 h, cells were harvested and stained for CD4. sorted Thy1.1+CD8+ T cells (2.5105/well) were cultured in lower chambers of transwell plates. the gray dottedline histogram is the control of nave CD4+ T cells without effector cells. the separation indeed reduced the suppression effect. expression of blimp1 or Cdkn2a in opposite siRNAtreated cells was analyzed. no direct effect on expression level of IL10 induced by one factor was caused by the opposite factor. cdkn2a is critical for IL4induced IL10 production. iTregs and Th2differentiated CD4+ T cells expressed significantly less IL10 in the absence of Cdkn2a. IL10 expression from splenic macrophages and CD11c+ DCs triggered by LPS was not affected. iTregs and Th2differentiated CD4+ T cells were also not affected. ve CD8+ T cells were cultured in A at 96 h and 6 h after restimulation. results from three independent experiments were combined and presented. IL10producing CD8+ T cells play a protective role in TNBSinduced murine colitis model. sex and agematched B6 WT mice were intrarectally administrated with TNBS. mice were weighed daily after treatment for 5 days. RNA was extracted from colon tissues, and the cDNA was prepared for analyzing the expression levels of ifn among different groups. the results showed that IFN mRNA levels in the GFP+CD8+ T celltreated group were significantly lower than that of the control group and nave mice. IL4 promotes CD8+ T cell differentiation into IL10producing cells. y1.1 expression is used to indicate IL10 gene expression, we determined that IL4 also induced antigenresponding IL10 production by CD8+ T cells. the expression level of IL10 was analyzed by realtime PCR. both of these reporter mice showed similar results. Splenocytes from 10BiT.OT1 mice were stimulated with Con A or OVA257\u2013264 (1 g/ml) and IL2 in the presence or absence of IL4 for 48 h and then expanded for 2 days. cells were then restimulated for 6 h with PMA and ionomycin and stained for CD8. GFP+CD8+ T cells showed an activated phenotype, with higher expression of CD44, CD25, and CD69. these cells also expressed higher levels of ICOS and PD1. no differences in expression of GITR, CTLA4 and TGF were observed between GFP+CD8+ T and GFPCD8+ T cells. a series of functional genes and transcription factors were found to be differentially expressed between these two types of CD8+ T cells. cDNA samples prepared from these two cell populations were used for realtime PCR analysis. IL10producing CD8+ T cells suppress CD4+ T cell proliferation. cells isolated from CD4dnIL10R mice express a high level of IL10R. IL10producing CD8+ T cells suppress CD4+ T cell proliferation in IL10 and cell contactdependent mechanisms. cells were harvested and stained for CD4 after 72 h. nave CD4+ T cells from B6 WT mice were cocultured with sorted Thy1.1+CD8+ T cells. one representative experiment of three is shown. the efficiency of these siRNAs reached >70%, as confirmed by realtime PCR. only knockdown of cdkn2a and blimp1 significantly reduced IL4induced IL10 expression. no direct effect on expression level of IL10 induced by one factor was caused by the opposite factor. data are representative of at least three independent experiments (mean+sem) no statistical difference was observed. immobilized antiCD3 (10 g/ml) and soluble antiCD28 (1 g/ml) in the presence of IL2 and IL4 for 48 h, expanded 2 days. cells were then restimulated by PMA and ionomycin for 6 h. results from three independent experiments were combined and presented. a TNBSinduced colitis model was adapted with different populations of CD8+ T cells transferred at different timepoints of disease induction. IL10producing CD8+ T cells play a protective role in the TNBSinduced murine colitis model. mice were weighed daily after treatment for 5 days. cells from four groups of mice were fixed for H&E staining to determine disease severity. representative sections were shown in B, and histopathological scores were shown in C (meansem;***P0.001). IL4 is a critical cytokine in the induction of CD4+ T cell Th2 differentiation. these CD4+ T cells produce IL4, IL5, IL13, and IL10 cytokines. it has also been reported that together with IL12, IL4 also induces IL10 production by CD8+ T cells. knockdown of cdkn2a and blimp1 suppressed IL10 expression significantly. knockdown of gata3 failed to affect IL4induced IL10 expression. it is unclear whether Cdkn2a is downstream of phosphorylated Stat6. several subsets of CD8+ Tregs have been identified. it is interesting to define whether this population is a new subset of CD8+ Tregs. further validation would be needed to study the gene expression profiles and functions of these IL4induced, IL10producing CD8+ T cells.
