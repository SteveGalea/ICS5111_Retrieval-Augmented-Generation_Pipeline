{"summary": "CTL cross-reactivity is believed to play a pivotal role in generating immune responses. but the extent and mechanisms of CTL cross-reactivity remain largely unknown. the emerging realization in the field is that T cell receptors recognize multiple distinct ligands. peptide processing and MHC presentation are a primary requirement for a cellular immune response. however, the availability of a suitable TCR further determines if a peptide is immunogenic. the core problem is that T cells seem to combine high specificity with the ability to recognize a surprisingly large number of dissimilar antigens. a large set of experimental settings, heterogeneous pathogens, MHC molecules and T cell clones analyzed cross-reactivity. we test whether the degree of host mimicry is negatively correlated with immunogenicity. the results suggest that amino acid similarity is a predictive measure of cross-reactivity. in position five, only one variant is tolerated (T5S) and is shown as a tall bar. the remaining variants on position 5 were unable to bind the TCR even though the binding to MHC was mostly preserved. in position one, 18 out of 19 variants preserved the TCR recognition. y-axis gives Shannon information [14] which is a measure of how conserved a position is. position 1 was mutated 19 times of which 18 variants preserved TCR binding. only the S1R variant compromised TCR binding while the MHC binding was preserved. in the conserved position five, the Simpson diversity drops to 1.29. the product of the tolerated amino acid diversity at each position can provide an estimate of the number of ligands a T cell clone can recognize. this value is in good agreement with previous estimates [8]. predictions made from this model are tested on several independent data sets. the prediction performance on this data set is similar to the performance on the single clonal data. similar results were obtained using BLOSUM matrices 35\u201390. for the remaining CTL clones (G10, C-3, C-4, C-22 and C-32) tested by Iversen et al. [18] correlations were 0.49, 0.47, 0.55, 0.60 and 0.57 respectively. avorable substitutions (low x) are associated with a low similarity score (low y) conservative substitutions (high x) in general are associated with higher similarity scores (high y) the axis shows the relative IFN and peptide similarity scores. the axis shows the relative IFN and peptide similarity scores. cross-reactive epitopes are significantly more similar than unrelated peptides with the same level of sequence identity. in cross-reacting T cell ligands non-identical positions are significantly more conservative than random. cross-reactivity is observed for non-identical substitutions preserving structural and/or physiochemical properties satisfying the idiosyncratic binding constrains of the responding TCR. cross-reactivity is observed for non-identical, but conservative substitutions preserving structural and/or physiochemical properties.

Fig. 2 shows box plots of the level of IFN response of three CTL clones in response to stimulation with the 171 variant peptides of SLFNTVATL. the Pearson correlation coefficients between their relative SFU and our peptide similarity score were 0.40, 0.39, and 0.35 for G10, T4, and PBMC data, respectively. similar results were obtained using BLOSUM matrices 35\u201390 (data not shown) this model of peptide similarity (or cross-reactivity) was thus able to explain around 2040% of the IFN secretion. a number of SYL9 variants hardly induce an IFN response, e.g., A7S, A7V, T5A mutants given in the upper left corner of Fig. 2. the axis shows the relative IFN and peptide similarity scores. the axis shows the relative IFN and peptide similarity scores. we were able to achieve similar performances while testing the model on other peptide scanning data, e.g. la Rosa et al. [19] cross-reactive epitopes are significantly more similar than unrelated peptides with the same level of sequence identity. in cross-reacting T cell ligands non-identical positions are significantly more conservative than random. cross-reactivity is observed for non-identical substitutions preserving structural and/or physiochemical properties satisfying the idiosyncratic binding constrains of the responding TCR. in such cases, cross-reactivity is observed for non-identical, but conservative substitutions.

IFN production was measured against all 171 single mutant variants of SFL9. purified PBMCs consisted of just two clones where one was dominant. we defined a measure of the \u201crelative frequency of recognition\u201d. the peptide-similarity score for reference peptide x spans the interval: Ix = [Ax min; Ax max] where the length of the interval |I| = A maxA min depends on references peptide x and matrix W. two different intervals (Ix, Iy x) are not comparable per se. reference peptides x which are dominated by amino acids like tryptophan that hardly ever substitute, will have few highly similar peptides (y) which satisfy the condition: S(x,y) 1. In contrast, reference peptides which are enriched in amino acids that are more likely to substitute have a greater number of highly similar peptides. XB2 sequence for Env, Pol, Vpu, Rev, Tat, Vif, Vif, Vpr, p17, p24 and p2p7p1p6 and the HIV-1 clade B consensus sequence for Nef were downloaded from the Los Alamos database. no TAT peptides were predicted to be HLA-A2 epitopes. the removal of proteins containing the words predicted, hypothetic or isoform in the protein description label led to a final core human proteome of 14,034 human protein sequences. the final set consisted of 230,460 predicted human HLA-A2 restricted self-antigens each of length 9. purified PBMCs consisted of just two clones where one was dominant. ELISPOT responses were reported as the percentage of maximum IFN (I) obtained for reference ELISPOT of SFL9. the peptide-similarity score for reference peptide x spans the interval: Ix = [Ax min; Ax max] where the length of the interval |I| = A maxA min depends on references peptide x and matrix W. reference peptides which are more likely to substitute have a greater number of highly similar peptides. expected similarity SO of pairs of experimentally verified cross-reactive epitopes (x,y) is to be compared to unrelated peptides (zi) which retain sequence identity of (x,y) but have an otherwise random amino acid on non-identical positions. out of 3,063 HIV nonamers, 91 were predicted to be HLA-A2 epitopes using NetCTL version 1.2 [25], [26] and default selection threshold (0.75). four out of 91 predicted HIV epitopes were found to be immunogenic for other supertypes than HLA-A2 and were filtered out. non-immunogenic HIV peptides were ranked on maximum self-similarity. peptides with a self-similarity score greater than 0.85 and b) were ranked on maximum self-similarity."}
