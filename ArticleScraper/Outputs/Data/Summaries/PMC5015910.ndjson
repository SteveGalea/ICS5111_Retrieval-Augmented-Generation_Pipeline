{"summary": "influenza epidemiology data are lacking in Egypt. ARI is the fourth leading cause of death [1] and second highest cause of years of life lost. the arab Republic of Egypt is the second most populous country of the EMR. the population is over 86.8 million, and 32% are under 15 years old. nationwide data on influenza morbidity, mortality, and seasonality are limited. the EMARIS Network was formed through collaboration of participating countries\u2019 ministries of health, CDC, NAMRU-3 and WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office. we describe seven years of influenza epidemiology from the EMARIS-Egypt multi site sentinel SARI surveillance system. EMARIS participants reviewed the case definition each year. from 2007\u20132009, the 2006 WHO SARI case definition was used. from 2010\u20132011, the case definition became any hospitalized patient 31 days or older meeting the 2006 WHO definition. from 2012\u20132014, the 2011 revised WHO SARI case definition was used. laboratory results were recorded as influenza negative, A/H1N1, A/H1N1pdm09, A/H3N2, A/H5N1, or B. for analytical purposes, specimens positive for two or more influenza types were coded according to the first specimen listed of: A/H5N1, A/H1N1pdm09, A/H3N2, A/H1N1, A/unsubtyped, or B. influenza season was defined as beginning on the month having the lowest average influenza activity over the entire period and ending one year later. the month having the lowest proportion of a season\u2019s influenza-positive specimens was considered that season\u2019s peak. written informed consent was not required by the IRBs due to the minimal risk faced by patients. the participating hospitals were abbassia Chest Hospital and abbassia Fever Hospital in Cairo, aswan Fever Hospital in Alexandria, aswan Fever Hospital in Aswan, aswan Fever Hospital in Damietta, Mahalla Fever Hospital in Gharbia, and Shibin El-Kom Fever Hospital in monufia. a hospital surveillance team conducted SARI surveillance at each site. all hospitalized patients who met the case definition were eligible for enrollment. aryngeal and nasopharyngeal swab taken with a sterile tip flocked with nylon swab applicator within 24 hours of hospital admission. resulting supernatant was split into two cryovials pre-labeled with the patient\u2019s study ID number and stored in -70\u00b0C freezers. SARI cases and associated laboratory results were dated as the patient\u2019s hospital admission date. teams abstracted data from medical records, such as chronic medical conditions and pregnancy status. each form was entered into Microsoft Access at MOH and sent to a central database at NAMRU-3. a total of 2,013 (12%) were influenza-positive and 923 (5%) were influenza-positive. 115 were subtyped as seasonal A/H1N1, 1,200 (60%) as A/H1N1pdm09, 674 (33%) as A/H3N2, 16 (1%) as A/H5N1, and 8 (1%) as unsubtyped. negative patients were under five years old compared to 16% of influenza-positive patients. median age of influenza-positive patients was higher than that of influenza-negative patients. influenza-positive cases were more likely to be female (and if female, be pregnant), require ventilation, be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and die (all p0.0001) preexisting conditions include asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tuberculosis, and other respiratory, cardiac, endocrine, hepatic, renal, neurologic, hematologic, or unspecified diseases. median duration from hospitalization to end of follow-up among all patients was 5 days. median duration from hospitalization to end of follow-up among all patients was 5 days. 83% were 15\u201364 years old, 53% were male, and 55% had a preexisting chronic condition. 12 percent (3/25) of females who had influenza and died were pregnant. influenza seasonality in Egypt The calendar month with the lowest average number and proportion of influenza-positive cases was July. the month accounted for an average of 27% (range 19\u201341%) of the entire season\u2019s influenza cases. influenza accounted for an average of 37% of all SARI cases that month (range 30\u201350%). influenza seasons were defined as the one-year period from July to June. in each season, the predominant influenza virus was A/H3N2 (2008\u201309 and 2011\u201312), A/H1N1pdm09 (2009\u201310, 2010\u201311, and 2013\u201314), or B (2012\u201313). 30% of influenza-negative patients were under five years old compared to 16% of influenza-positive patients. median age of influenza-positive patients was higher than that of influenza-negative patients: 30 years (range 1 month\u201390 years, IQR 12\u201350 years) compared to 27 years (range 1 month\u201395 years, IQR 3\u201350 years) preexisting conditions include asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tuberculosis, and other respiratory, cardiac, endocrine, hepatic, renal, neurologic, hematologic, or unspecified diseases. median duration from hospitalization to end of follow-up among all patients was 5 days. za Mortality in Egypt Of the 2,936 influenza-positive cases, 53 (2%) died. 83% were 15\u201364 years old, 53% were male, and 55% had a preexisting chronic condition. 12 percent (3/25) of females who had influenza were pregnant. influenza seasonality in Egypt The calendar month with the lowest average number and proportion of influenza-positive cases was July, making December the influenza activity peak. the month accounted for an average of 27% (range 19\u201341%) of the entire season\u2019s influenza cases. influenza accounted for an average of 37% of all SARI cases that month. influenza seasons were defined as the one-year period from July to June. the influenza virus types and subtypes detected over time are shown in Fig 2. In each season, the predominant influenza virus was A/H3N2 (2008\u201309 and 2011\u201312), A/H1N1pdm09 (2009\u201310, 2010\u201311, and 2013\u201314), or B (2012\u201313). from 2007\u20132014, nearly 3,000 influenza hospitalizations were detected by the eight sentinel hospitals. this figure is nearly double those recently found in other EMARIS Network countries. influenza accounted for 19% of SARI deaths in Egypt. influenza subtype with the highest mortality (50%) was A/H5N1 avian influenza. as of march 3, 2015, the worldwide A/H5N1 case fatality rate was 55%. a longer duration from symptom onset to hospitalization increased the odds of death among influenza-positive patients. possible priority groups for vaccination in Egypt include pregnant women, individuals with chronic conditions, and older adults based on aforementioned findings. this suggests an ideal timing for resource allocation and provides a baseline metric on which to compare future activity. these data indicate that Egyptian hospitals should prepare for peak influenza activity from November\u2013May. CPHL and NAMRU-3 enabled sensitive and specific detection of influenza viruses and types via rtRT-PCR for all 17,441 SARI patients. this is the first documented examination of national influenza epidemiology in Egypt.
