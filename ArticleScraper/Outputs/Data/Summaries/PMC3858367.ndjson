{"summary": "neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a rare inflammatory disease primarily affecting the optic nerve and spinal cord, with relatively sparing brain white matter. relapses of NMO are not prevented but rather triggered by disease-modifying agents prescribed for MS. plasmablasts (PBs), bearing a phenotype of CD19intCD27highCD38highCD180-, are B-cells selectively increased in the peripheral blood of NMO. PBs migrate to lymphoid organs, and differentiate into PBs or memory B-cells (mB) within a germinal center. the presence of AQP4-Ab-producing B-cells in the CSF was demonstrated in a patient with NMO [10], although the origin and identity of the cells were not fully characterized. we found that during the relapse, the activated PB cells selectively upregulated CXCR3, a receptor for CXCL10 (interferon gamma-induced protein 10, IP-10) elevated in the CSF of NMO. the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the each participated institute or university. participants provided their written informed consent to participate in the study. each patient met the revised NMO diagnostic criteria [18] or was diagnosed with NMO spectrum disorder (NMOSD) peripheral blood samples with or without CSF samples were obtained from seven seropositive patients during relapse before they received intensive therapy such as i.v. corticosteroids. there were no significant differences among the NMO patients who provided samples during relapse or during remission. anti-CD38 conjugated with peridinin chlorophyll-protein complex (PerCP)-Cy5.5, anti-CD138 conjugated with PerCP-Cy5.5, anti-CD27 conjugated with Pacific Blue, anti-CXCR3 conjugated with PerCP-Cy5.5, anti-CXCR4 conjugated with biotin or with biotin. high-fidelity Taq polymerase (Takara Bio) was used to avoid incorrect amplification. cDNA fragments obtained from the first patient were cloned into pMD20-T vectors using Mighty TA-cloning reagents (Takara Bio) more than two clones derived from each single-cell sorted were sequenced to confirm the uniformity of the single PB sorting. the clinical profiles of patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO)/NMO NMO spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and multiple sclerosis (MS) are summarized in Table 1. FACSCanto II and FACSCalibur flow cytometers (BD Biosciences) were used for cell analysis along with the FACSAria II cell sorter. monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were used for flow cytometry analysis and cell sorting. cDNA fragments of the variable regions of heavy chain (VH) and light chain (VKappa) in each sorted cell were amplified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. more than two clones derived from each single-cell sorted were sequenced using nested primer sets. the proportions of the PB cells were increased in the CSF lymphocytes from NMO compared to those from MS. however, the frequency of PB cells among CD19+ B-cells increased significantly in the peripheral blood and CSF of NMO patients compared to that of MS patients. PB cells were stained with anti-CD19, -CD27, -CD38, and -CD180 monoclonal antibodies. values represent the percentages of PB cells among all mononuclear cells. PB cells infiltrating CNS are CD138+HLA-DR. the CD138+HLA-DR+ PBs comprised the vast majority of PBs in the CSF of NMO patients in relapse. we speculated that antibody-producing PB cells (CD138+HLA-DR+ PB) were activated in the periphery in the patients during relapse. proportions of CD138+ PBs, but not CD138- PBs, among CD19+ B-cells significantly increased one week after influenza vaccination. compared HLA-DR+ and HLA-DR+ PBs from vaccinated individuals for intracellular expression of IgGs. the expression of CXCR4 and CXCR3 on PB cells is important for their homing to the bone marrow, whereas the interaction of CXCR3 with its ligand plays a key role in the migration of PBs toward inflamed tissues. we analyzed the expression levels of CXCR3 on PB cells in the peripheral blood of NMO patients. CXCR3 expression on plasmablasts correlates with the disease state. we compared mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CXCR3 and CXCR4 expressions in peripheral blood PBs during relapse and relapse of NMO. the ratio of replacement to silent mutations (R/S ratio) was analyzed in single-cell sorted PBs derived from a patient with NMO. the variable regions of the PB IgG heavy chain contained an average of 17 mutations. 11 CDR3 sequences were repeatedly detected in 17 PB clones and 21 peripheral blood PB clones of the same patient. a common CDR3 sequence (VKFSATAAAGNWDHFDY) was obtained from the PB clones from both patients. distinct PB clones obtained from peripheral blood and CSF samples are numbered in the order they were collected. the amino acid sequences of 11 CDR3 were repeatedly detected in the PB clones, VH gene (germline) and joint regions. proportions of PB cells increased in the CSF lymphocytes from NMO compared to those from MS. the proportions of mB (CD27+CD38low\u2013midCD180+ cells) decreased reciprocally. the data were obtained from eight patients with MS and five with NMO. PB cells infiltrating CNS are CD138+HLA-DR+. we analyzed the phenotypes of PB subpopulations in the peripheral blood. the plasmablasts (PBs) were subdivided into four subpopulations. the individual data show the percentages of each PB subpopulation among the total PB. PBMC and CSF cells were obtained from NMO during relapse. CD138+HLA-DR+ plasmablasts (PB) cells are recently differentiated IgG-producing PBs. the effects of influenza vaccination on the frequencies of B-cell subpopulations were analyzed. each line connects the values obtained from a single subject. CR3 on PBs or activated PBs were significantly higher during relapse than in remission of NMO. it appeared that the upregulation of CXCR4 on PBs during relapse was less obvious. the values represent the percentages of CXCR3+ or CXCR4+ cells within each B-cell subpopulation. unstained control of PBMC is indicated by Ctrl. representative data of at least five patients in each disease state are shown. the variable regions of the IgG chains of the sorted PB contained an average of 10 mutations. however, there were no significant differences in the number of mutations between the PB clones from peripheral blood and from CSF. the similarity in the numbers of mutations in these PB clones did not differ from those in IgG+ mB [28] HFDY was obtained from the PB clones from both patients. the PBs seem to be inclined toward several representative clones during the relapse of NMO. PB clones from peripheral blood and CSF samples are numbered in order they were collected. the clone numbers were highlighted in bold. it is unclear whether PBs play a pathogenic role within the CNS. the increased frequency of HLA-DR+ PBs in NMO reflects an antigen-driven B-cell activation that plays a key role in NMO pathogenicity. a study on a neurotropic coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis model showed that the activated PBs would migrate from the periphery to the CNS in a CXCR3-dependent manner. clonal expansion and differentiation of mB in the CSF is not a major pathway. this assumption is supported by the rare occurrence of CSF oligoclonal bands and raised IgG index in NMO. in the CNS, PBs from peripheral blood and CSF produce anti-AQP4 IgG antibody in NMO. humanized anti\u2013IL-6 receptor antibody (Tocilizumab) was efficacious in a patient with NMO in reducing the number of PBs in the peripheral blood as well as stabilizing the clinical conditions. this results indicate that PBs, rather than CD20+ mB, play a pivotal role in NMO. the Mann-Whitney test provided the statistical p values. the bars represent the median interquartile range (IQR) Figure S6 Comparison of the somatic hypermutations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)- and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-derived PB clones. the statistic p values were obtained by Mann-Whitney test."}
