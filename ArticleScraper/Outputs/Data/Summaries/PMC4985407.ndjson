{"summary": "ARDS is a major clinical problem that contributes to the death of more than 70,000 people annually in the united states. a variety of clinical disorders are associated with the development of ARDS, including pneumonia, aspiration of gastric contents, sepsis, trauma, and the transfusion of blood products. we conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the national health insurance research database (NHIRD) of Taiwan. the aim of our study was to investigate the incidence, medical costs, in-hospital mortality, and 1-year mortality of ARDS during a 14-year period. first diagnosis was categorized into 7 groups: 18 to 29, 30 to 39, 40 to 49, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, 70 to 79, and over 80 years old. the number of ARDS patients was used as the numerator of the incidence rate. the total population of Taiwan was used as the denominator of the incidence rate per 100,000 person-years. patients whose sex was not identified or who were less than 18 years old were excluded from this study because ARDS in children has different epidemiology and outcomes. demographic characteristics, resource utilization, clinical features, in-hospital mortality, and 1-year mortality were studied. we also reported in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality across each calendar year. the temporal trend was tested by the Cochran\u2013Armitage trend test. a 2-tailed P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. increased from 12.53 to 19.26 per 100,000 person-years in the total population. it also increased from 17.21 to 25.73 per 100,000 person-years in the male population. overall, the incidence rate increased from 13.27 per 100,000 person-years in the group of 50 to 59 years of age to an estimated 154.05 per 100,000 person-years. the pattern of 1-year mortality of ARDS was very similar to that of in-hospital mortality in this study. we observed a trend of decreasing 1-year mortality rates from 75.8% in 1997 to 54.7% in 2011 in patients with ARDS. the age-specific incidence rates increased with advancing age. men had higher incidence of ARDS than women in all age groups. in-hospital mortality rate of ARDS patients during the study period was 57.8%. the overall 1-year mortality rate of ARDS was 72.1%. there were no sex differences in 1-year mortality. this is the first large epidemiological study of ARDS in a predominantly Asian patient population. more than 1000 studies using the Taiwan NHIRD have been published. the specificity of ICD-9 coding is likely improved by the fact that the diagnosis is typically made only by intensivists or pulmonologists. in-hospital mortality in this cohort was considerably higher than mortality reported in other large cohorts. study showed that the incidence of ARDS was 17 to 26 per 100,000 person-years,34 which is very close to our finding. factors related to health care delivery or patient race lead to differences in observed outcomes. this is the first nationwide epidemiological study of ARDS. the follow-up period is the longest available, so we can clearly see the trend of the disease. limitations of the study are inherent to ICD-09 database without any specified definition of ARDS."}
