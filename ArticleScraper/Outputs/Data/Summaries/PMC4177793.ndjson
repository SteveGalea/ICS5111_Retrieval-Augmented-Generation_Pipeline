{"summary": "the two separate national surveillance networks that report on the circulation of influenza are the outpatient influenza-like illness surveillance network (ILI) surveillance network (KISS) and the laboratory virus surveillance system (KINRESS) the HIMM consists of an integrated clinical and laboratory surveillance system, in which seven nationwide tertiary teaching hospitals collect data of patients who visit the emergency room. samples were taken from 413% of 10 872 patients presenting with ILI. the influenza test positivity was defined as the ratio of the number of positive cases divided by the total number of tests. RAT positivity was reported weekly. correlation coefficients were subsequently calculated for regional HIMM and KISS surveillance data to monitor regional influenza trends. data analysis was performed using spss, version 100 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) correlation coefficient matrix of data from regional KISS and HIMM ILI surveillance KISS surveillance HIMM site Correlation coefficient Seoul Korea University Guro Hospital 0894 Hallym University 0850 Incheon Inha University 0853 Gyeonggi Korea University Ansan Hospital 0817. influenza B was predominant during the first epidemic peak, while influenza B was predominant during the second peak. HIMM surveillance showed a higher baseline ILI rate than national ILI surveillance. the rates need to be interpreted with caution because they may not represent true cases of influenza. HIMM RAT surveillance could be useful to detect early signs of an influenza epidemic. compared with KISS surveillance, the baseline ILI rates of HIMM surveillance showed fluctuation during the initial operating period. this fluctuation may be due to the immaturity of data collection."}
