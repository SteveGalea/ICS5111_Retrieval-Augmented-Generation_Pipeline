{"summary": "the negative impact of the use of cordons sanitaires to limit the spread of Ebola in west africa highlight the importance of developing and implementing novel approaches aimed at ameliorating the impact of disease outbreaks in areas of the world that cannot respond in a timely manner to novel disease outbreaks. the identification of a theoretical explanatory framework that disentangles the role of epidemiological and socioeconomic perspectives on disease dynamics becomes not only evident but necessary. the risk of acquiring an infectious disease within a flight can be measured at least in principle as a function of the time that each individual of x-type spends flying, the number of passengers, and the likelihood that an infectious individual is on board. the risk of acquiring an infectious disease within a flight can be measured at least in principle as a function of the time that each individual of x-type spends flying. the lack of preference on the use of contacts is not tied to their proven intellectual value or the use of a lagrangian modeling perspective. each of these patches (or environments) is defined by its associated risk of residency-time infection. each of these patches (or environments) is defined by its associated risk of residency-time infection. the effective population j = 1 n p i j N j in each Patch i, i = 1,..., n includes j = 1 n p i j I j infected individuals. the likelihood of infection in each patch is tied in to the environmental risks, defined by the \u201ctransmission/risk\u201d vector B = ( 1, 2,..., n. I = ( I 1, I 2,..., I n ) t, N = ( b 1 d 1, b 2 d 2,..., b n d n ) t, and = ( 1, 2,..., n ) t allows to rewrite System 1 in the following single vectorial form. if the residence time matrix P is irreducible, patches are strongly connected, then System 2 supports a sharp threshold property. the disease persists in Patch i whenever R 0 i ( P ) > 1, whereas the disease dies out in Patch i if p k j = 0 for all k = 1,. n, and k i, provided p i j > 0 and R 0 i ( P ) 1. 1,2 and i j = p i j ( 0,0 ) are such that j = 1 2 i j = 1. the simulation below shows how a crude, density-dependent modeling mobility approach can alter the expected disease dynamics from those generated under constant P. in the special case, where there is no movement between patches ( p 12 = p 21 = 12 = 21 = 0 ) the two populations support, as expected, the same dynamics. individuals of Patch 1 spend all their time in Patch 2, whereas individuals of Patch 2 spend all their time in Patch 1. the basic reproduction of the \u201cisolated\u201d Patch 1 is R 0 2 = 1 2 + d 2. the disease dies out because R 0 2 = 0.8571. lagrangian approaches have been used to model vector-borne diseases. in refs. 76 and 78, the effects of movement on patch population size at time t are ignored, namely, the population size in each patch j is fixed at N j. the infected hosts are denoted by the vector I h and the host population by N v. the parameters a i, i, and v denote the biting, death rate of control, and natural death rate of mosquitoes in Patch j, for j = 1,..., m. m patches and n groups, is given by R 0 2 ( m, n ) = ( M v h M h v ) 1 diag ( a ) diag ( P t N h ) 1 and M v h = h v diag ( a ) diag ( a ) 1 diag ( a ) diag ( v + ) 1. m v h = h v the lagrangian approach of disease modeling can use contacts (60) or residency times or both as its currency. this is, we choose to handle social heterogeneity by keeping track of individuals\u2019 social or geographical membership. in this context, it is possible to include adaptive responses, for example, via the inclusion of prevalence-dependent dispersal coefficients. literature has been strongly influenced by past and ongoing work on the exploitation of species (85\u201387) the methodology for modeling behavior within an EEM rests on a proper specification of behavioral costs and a description of the payoffs linked to such behaviors. a decision to reduce the volume of activity one engages in has been shown to be phenomenologically identical to reducing one\u2019s chances of coming in contact with infection. modeling assumes that individuals derive benefits from making contacts. the utility function is assumed to be concave, decreasing in illness and increasing in contacts. the optimal choice of contacts is the solution to a dynamic programing problem. the role of recovered individuals in protecting vulnerable individuals has been overlooked in public health interventions. the benefits of acquired immunity include the positive externality associated with acquired immunity but may be nullified by nontargeted social-distancing policies that induce such immune individuals to reduce contacts. the role of behavior and individual decisions in response to a changing epidemic landscape has not been tackled systematically. the use of lagrangian models parametrized in this fashion are likely to increase the give and take necessary for theory and data to modify, expand, or even reinvent the way that we look and think about the dynamics and evolution of infectious diseases. the SARS, influenza, and Ebola epidemics have shown the dramatic role that individual decisions play on the dynamics of infectious diseases. many aspects of culture have the characteristics of being social diseases. it is as important to understand the dynamics of the social systems in which we live as it is to understand the ecological systems themselves. it is a daunting task, both because of the amount we still must learn."}
