{"summary": "the study quantitatively estimated the number of infected travelers who actually passed through the airport. we then compared screening findings with the expected number of infected travelers who passed through the airport. the number of screened passengers was obtained from airport records. 109 (27%) met the case definition and received virologic testing. RT-PCR results were located for 89 (82%), among which 4 were positive. the expected number of infected travelers estimated to have passed through the border was therefore 69. the estimated proportion of overseas-acquired cases would have decreased as the pandemic progressed. the net effect of these factors is unknown, but they would probably have increased the estimated number of undetected infected travelers passing through screening. the communication of health information and advice on how to seek treatment is consistently recommended as a pandemic prevention strategy."}
