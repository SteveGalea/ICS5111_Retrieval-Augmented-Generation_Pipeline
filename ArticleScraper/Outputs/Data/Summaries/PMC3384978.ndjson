{"summary": "human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most important infectious agents causing acute lower respiratory tract illness, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. RNA generated during RSV replication is recognized by host pattern recognition molecules, such as toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), and it induces type I and type III interferon. CAM is a 14-membered ring macrolide antibiotic that acts as a biological reaction modifier with anti-inflammatory properties. in japan, CAM is applied to diffuse panbronchiolitis, chronic bronchiolitis, otitis media, and chronic sinusitis as an immunomodulator. the virus titer of RSV was determined using a plaque-forming assay with HEp-2 cells as the indicator cells. CAM was donated by Abbott Japan (Tokyo, Japan) a PAF receptor antagonist, 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho(N,N,N,-trimethyl)-hexanolamine, was purchased from Calbiochem-Merck (Darmstadt, Germany cells were collected by centrifugation and washed once with PBS. stained cells were assessed with FACSCalibur (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA) FITC isomer-I was added at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. FITC-labeled bacteria was added to the cells 1 h prior to the addition of the FITC-labeled bacteria. the cell monolayer was gently washed three times with PBS. the cells were harvested with cell scraper and then assessed by flow cytometry as previously described. cells were harvested from culture flasks using a cell scraper. then incubated with 2.5 g/mL of mouse anti-PAF receptor monoclonal antibody. cells were collected by centrifugation and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. CAM was added to monolayers of A549 cells 1 h prior to RSV infection. the cells were incubated with FITC-labeled S. pneumoniae cells at 37\u00b0C. the cell monolayer was gently washed three times with PBS. dehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were carried out as a control. after 24 h and 36 h infection, the culture supernatants were corrected. each experiment was performed in quadruplicate. one hour before RSV infection, CAM or PDTC is added to A549 cells. the cells were infected with the RSV at MOI of 1. after 24 h of infection, the cells were collected and then stained. FITC-labeled bacterial cells were added to the cell monolayer at MOI of 1. a PAF receptor antagonist (20 g/mL) was added to the cell monolayer 1 h before the addition of labeled bacterial cells. CAM was shown to suppress IL-6, IL-8, and RANTES, which are induced by RSV infection, at concentrations of 10 and 100 g/mL. IL-8 and RANTES play important roles in pathogenesis. RANTES is secreted from respiratory epithelial cells and promotes migration of eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, and neutrophils. CAM suppressed enhanced S. pneumoniae adhesion by RSV infection in A549 cells. CAM showed more potent suppression of RSV-induced S. pneumoniae adhesion. CAM significantly suppressed IL-6 production, whereas fosfomycin did not significantly. CAM may suppress both secondary bacterial infections and immunological disorders induced by RSV. ococcus pneumoniae adhesion to respiratory epithelial cells. clarithromycin may suppress secondary bacterial infections and immunological disorders."}
