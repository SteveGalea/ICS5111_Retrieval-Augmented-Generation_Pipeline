{"summary": "avian influenza viruses (AIV) are divided into highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) and low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) HPAIV are associated with systemic infections and high mortality rates in poultry. virulence is influenced by the multibasic cleavage site of the hemagglutinin (HA) which is cleaved by ubiquitous endoproteases including furin. human IAV bind preferentially to 2,3 linked sialic acids. both linked sialic acids were previously described in different avian species. different IAV-subtypes play an economically important role in poultry species. in vivo infection studies in chickens with H9N2 indicated that all oviduct sections were susceptible to infection with H9N2 with magnum cells being the most susceptible. no comparable study was performed in turkeys or Pekin ducks, which show different susceptibility for AIV compared to chickens. we used oviduct explants to compare the susceptibility of chicken, turkey, and pekin duck reproductive tract for infection with three selected viruses. the oviduct was aseptically isolated from 35-days-old commercial female pekin ducks (Anas platyrhyncho) at least five different birds from the same species were used per experiment. at least five different birds from the same species were used per experiment. birds were sacrificed according to animal welfare regulations. the magnum part was manually cut into small rings of 1\u20132 mm. each magnum explant was placed in 500 l medium and infected individually. one hour after infection, medium was replaced and magnum organ cultures were infected with 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. cells were covered with 2% DMEM (10x) (Biochrom), 2.5% Avicel\u00ae (Sigma\u2013Aldrich), 10 mM HEPES (Sigma\u2013Aldrich), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Biochrom), 0.01% DEAE Dextran hydrochloride (Sigma\u2013Aldrich), P/S (100 U/ml/100 g/ml) (Biochrom), 0.2% BSA (Carl Virus stocks were stored at -70\u00b0C. experimental design A total of three experiments was conducted. each experiment was repeated between one and four times, depending on the availability of birds. tubulin MOC were mounted on filter papers using tissue freezing medium. they were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70\u00b0C. sections of 7 m were cut with a leica cryostat (Nu\u00dfloch, Germany) 2,3 linked sialic acids were detected with the biotinylated maackia amurensis lectin II (MAL II) both lectins were used at a concentration of 15 g/ml. peroxidase activity was developed with the AEC Peroxidase Substrate (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, Germany), following the instructions of the manufacturer. quantification of AIV was done by the assessment of the M gene and normalization to the 28S rRNA housekeeping gene of the same sample (CT) as previously described (Petersen et al., 2013). quantification of IFN and IFN mRNA expression in chicken and turkey MOC was based on the cycle threshold (CT) values. Statistically significant differences were determined with the two samples T-test for normally distributed data. not normally distributed data were analyzed with a Kruskal\u2013Wallis one-way ANOVA. differences were considered significant at p 0.05. 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Biochrom), 2% chicken serum (Sigma\u2013Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), Penicillin/Streptomycin (P/S; 100 U/ml, 100 mg/ml) and 1% of non-essential amino acids (Biochrom) each magnum explant was placed in 500 l medium and infected individually. pH1N1, a human isolate, was propagated and titrated in MDCK cells. cells were plated in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h with 5 % CO2 at 37\u00b0C. cells were inoculated with 10-fold dilution of different IAV-subtypes. clonal anti-nucleoprotein antibodies were processed afterward for primary and secondary antibody staining. a polyclonal goat-anti-mouse-IgG/HRP were processed at a dilution of 1:1000. each experiment was repeated between one and four times. the infectious dose was chosen based on preliminary H9N2-infection studies performed in MOC-Ch. a similar infection dose was previously used for the infection of tracheal organ cultures in this working group. both inoculated and virus-free control MOC were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C before the supernatant was aspirated. fluorescence microscopy was performed with a Nikon Eclipse Ti Microscope. no non-specific staining was seen if slides were only incubated either with the first or second antibody. Detection of 2,3 and 2,6 Linked Sialic Acids was performed using lectins and glycobiology reagents. RNA Isolation and qRT-PCR Total RNA was isolated with peqGOLD TriFastTM following the instruction guide. quantification of AIV was done by the assessment of the M gene and normalization to the 28S rRNA housekeeping gene of the same sample (CT) statistically significant differences between groups were determined with the two samples T-test for normal distribution of the data. not normally distributed data were analyzed with a Kruskal\u2013Wallis one-way ANOVA. MOC-Du showed the most abundant expression of 2,6 linked sialic acids followed by MOC-Tu and MOC-Ch. MOC-Tu showed faint but reproducible staining of only a few cells, which was different to the staining pattern of 2,3 linked sialic acids. H9N2-infected MOC-Du showed less antigen positive epithelial cells at all investigated time points compared to MOC-Ch and MOC-Tu. no epithelial cell damage was detected in H9N2-infected MOC-Du. pH1N1-infected MOC-Ch showed less AIV-antigen positive cells compared to MOC-Tu. antigen detection pattern of H6N8 in MOC-Tu was comparable to H9N2. only few H6N8 positive cells were found in MOC-Du. Virus-free controls were negative at all investigated time points (n = 5 MOC/group/time point) different letters indicate differences between groups tested at the same time point post infection p 0.05, ANOVA, Tukey honestly significant differences (HSD) IFN-mRNA expression was not investigated in pH1N1-inoculated MOC-Du. MOC-Tu showed the highest upregulation of IFN and IFN at 12, 24, and 48 h post H9N2-infection. no change in IFN mRNA expression was observed in investigated MOC. MOC were collected at 12, 24 and 48 hpi and processed for RNA isolation and quantification of IFN and IFN mRNA expression. pH1N1-infected MOC-Du were not susceptible to infection. no significant changes were observed in IFN mRNA expression in pH1N1-infected MOC-Ch. 2,3 linked sialic acids were evenly distributed on magnum epithelial surface of MOC-Du, MOC-Ch, and MOC-Tu. arrows indicate 2,3 linked sialic acids detected with the biotinylated Maackia amurensis lectin II (MAL II) peroxidase activity was developed with the AEC Peroxidase Substrate. slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. MOC sections were stained for IAV-nucleoprotein (FITC, green), -tubulin (Cy3, red), and cell nuclei. analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. negative virus-negative controls consist of non-infected MOC-Ch. H9N2 (A), pH1N1 (B) and H6N8 (C) in MOC of Pekin duck (Du), chicken (Ch), and turkey (Tu) by FFU. supernatants were collected at 12, 24, and 48 hpi and were subjected to viral titration. significantly higher number of H9N2-genome copies were detected in MOC-Ch compared to MOC-Tu at 12 and 24 hpi (p 0.05) no significant difference was observed between both species at 48 hpi. antiviral gene expression mRNA gene expression of IFN and IFN was investigated in experiment 2 in MOC of all species. mRNA expression was observed in H9N2-infected MOC-Ch compared with virus-free MOC. pH1N1-infection did not lead to any changes in the IFN gene expression in investigated MOC compared to the virus-free controls. H9N2-infected MOC-Du showed significant upregulation of IFN mRNA expression up to more than 1500-fold at 24 hpi. at 48 hpi, the endpoint of the experiment, we detected a 25-fold increase compared to the virus-free controls. age seems to have no significant or only minor influences on the distribution and staining intensity of 2,3 and 2,6 sialic acids. age seems to have no significant or minor influences on the distribution and staining intensity of 2,3 and 2,6 sialic acids. human influenza viruses including pH1N1 bind preferably to 2,6 linked sialic acids. AIV including H9N2 preferentially bind to 2,3 linked sialic acids. this difference in receptor abundance may subsequently influence replication level of different IAV. we observed differences in localization of 2,3 linked sialic acids and 2,6 linked sialic acids staining between species, which was more luminal in MOC-Ch and MOC-Du, but luminal and lateral in MOC-Tu respectively. further investigations are necessary to determine the exact location of 2,6 linked sialic acids in MOC-Tu. pH1N1-inoculation did not lead to major destruction of the magnum epithelium of MOC-Ch and MOC-Tu up to 48 hpi. this suggests that virus replication level may correlate with lesion development. there was no clear correlation between H9N2-replication and IFN-expression levels for both species. the upregulation of IFN mRNA expression in MOC-Tu at 12 hpi was unexpected. this may be due to inflammatory reactions caused by excision. the protective role of IFN against AIV was previously described. in mice, IFN was shown to be highly efficient in preventing respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections. further studies should be conducted to investigate the protein function of IFN and its receptor in the avian reproductive tract. author contributions SR: Planned the study and experiments, evaluated the results, and prepared the manuscript.
