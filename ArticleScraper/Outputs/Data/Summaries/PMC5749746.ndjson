{"summary": "URI has been described as one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality for cats in north american animal shelters. URI can have acute and chronic sequelae for feline health. URI is one of the most significant disease concerns for shelter managers. multiple studies have evaluated the success of various antibiotics for empirical treatment of URI in pet cats and shelter cats. no preventive benefit was found for lysine supplementation, while at best modest benefits have been reported for vaccination [19\u201321]. septica, is significantly linked to URI risk in cats within a shelter[14] but it is unknown to what extent differences in URI frequency between shelters are linked to differences in the frequency of pathogen carriage in newly admitted cats. the study aimed to document variation in risk of URI between shelters; determine whether this reflects variation in pathogen frequency on intake. shelters completed a 47-question online survey (S1 Survey link) to establish shelter baselines for housing, management and environmental factors. specific questions were asked about housing during the first 7 days of shelter care, referred to as \u201cintake housing\u201d. URI rates in this study were reported per 1000 at risk cat days. shelters had access to all their data and could monitor their URI rates throughout the study period. Approximately 20 cats were sampled at each shelter during a one-week sampling period every three months. a five-week continuous period was needed to sample cats at the five shelters. samples were collected onto sterile cotton swabs with plastic sticks. the total number of cats sampled at intake in the five shelters over the one-year period was 329 cats. the total number of cats sampled at intake in the five shelters over the one-year period was 329 cats. a p value 0.05 was considered significant. the study protocol was reviewed and approved by the university of California. shelter cats participated in the study. shelter staff recorded the daily number of adult cats in the shelter population categorized by health status (with or without URI) and each day\u2019s intake of adult felines (new cats entering the shelter population) cats were observed as either not sick with URI (and therefore at risk for URI) or sick with URI. each shelter had a unique ID and login password to access the online database. each shelter had access to all their data and could monitor their URI rates. URI rates were reported per 1000 at risk cat days. a five-week continuous period was needed to sample cats at the five shelters. samples were collected onto sterile cotton swabs with plastic sticks. the total number of cats sampled at intake in the five shelters was 329 cats. all shelters vaccinated cats on intake with a modified live parenteral vaccine for feline calicivirus, herpesvirus and panleukopenia. all shelters vaccinated cats on intake with a modified live parenteral vaccine for feline calicivirus, herpesvirus and panleukopenia. all shelters followed the same practices, preventing comparison. the overall URI rate for the year varied almost 50-fold between shelters, from 0.7 to 33.4 cases/1000 cat days at risk. the overall average annual URI rate for adult cats was 14.8 cases/1000 cat days at risk. the percentage for individual shelters ranged from 3% to > 29%. intake housing floor space >8 ft2 (.74m2) and two or fewer housing moves during the first week of stay. variables associated with significantly increased URI incidence were providing hiding spaces (sometimes or always) and use of an intranasal vaccine. Shelter Cats tested Intake Cat PCR Positives Yearly URI Rate (URI cases/1000 at risk days) Chlamydophila felis FCVa FHV-1b Bordetella bronchiseptica Mycoplasma felis A 60 1.6% (1) 15.0% (9) 35.0% (21) 3.3% (2) 28.3% (17) 32.3 B 80 1.2% (1) 15.0% (12) 23.7% (19) 3.8% (3) 28.7% (23) 31.8 C 68 (0) 22.0% URI summary statistics In total, 18,373 adult cats in these nine shelters were included. one shelter had URI incidence rates consistently below 3 cases/1000 cat days at risk. another shelter was below 11 cases/1000 cat days at risk for the full study period. no changes in vaccination type or use and no changes in disinfectant use. two shelters introduced new larger double-compartment individual cat housing in may 2009. 16 Number of Housing Moves (> 2 in first week of stay) 0.19 0.14\u20130.25 0.0001 Intranasal Vaccine Use (FVRCc) 1.66 1.13\u20132.44 0.010 a0.56\u20130.74m2 b >0.74m2 c Feline viral rhinotracheitis (feline herpesvirus-1) and calicivirus Intake cat pathogen prevalence and shelter URI incidence rates. there was wide variation in URI rate between shelters in association with modifiable environmental risk factors. a lower URI rate may be a marker for improved behavioral well-being for cats as well as better health, lending increased importance to these findings. Fig 2 shows a larger sized double-compartment housing unit. Feline housing 8\u201310 ft2 of floor space and double compartment. movement of cats in and out of the cage or between cages 2 times in the first 7 days in the shelter was also significantly associated with lower risk of URI compared to more frequent movement. the association between provision of hiding places and increased URI rate was surprising, given studies documenting the benefit of hiding places for stress reduction in cats. the addition of a solid hiding structure along with the litter box, food and water may have reduced available floor space to a level that negatively impacted cat health. intranasal vaccination has been associated with mild clinical signs in up to 30% of vaccinates. vaccine reactions appeared clinically identical to URI and were added to shelters reported URI rate. vaccine failed to protect against more severe disease. each shelter used an internally consistent case definition for URI. case definitions ranged from inclusive (any single sign of URI) to strict (more than one sign of URI, mucopurulent nasal or ocular discharge and/or systemic illness) two shelters may have caused short term fluctuations in URI risk. other changes may not have been recognized or reported. shelters spanned a wide range of climatic conditions from canada to southern California. cats were placed in the housing unit with food, water and bed in one compartment, a towel draped over the cage door and a litter box in the other compartment[35]. the cage was spot cleaned only as needed and food and water replaced without handling or removing the cat. the study provided a foundation to identify factors that may contribute to URI risk. significant differences were found despite this suggests the variations were the results of underlying environmental risks versus differences in case definition. participating shelters inevitably experienced some changes in practices and circumstances over the course of the year that could affect URI rates. all shelters vaccinated cats on intake with a modified live parenteral vaccine for feline calicivirus, herpesvirus and panleukopenia. no shelter in the study reported a specific positive handling program such as has been described in association with decreased URI risk. URI is not an inevitable consequence of sheltering homeless cats. housing and care of cats, particularly during their first week of stay, significantly affects the rate of upper respiratory infection."}
