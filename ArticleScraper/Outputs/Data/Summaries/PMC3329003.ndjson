{"summary": "420 serum specimens were collected from 317 patients 1\u201390 days after onset of symptoms. condition of all patients was confirmed by seroconversion or a fourfold increase in antibody titer against SARS-CoV. ELISA measured the N protein\u2013specific IgG (SARS-CoV N-IgG) and SARS-CoV\u2013specific IgG (SARS-CoV IgG) in serum samples. the detection rate decreased from day 10 after the onset of symptoms. but from day 7 to day 18, a high level of N protein was still detectable. a total of 110 acute-phase serum samples from non-SARS patients collected 4 years previously (n = 400) only one was weakly positive for N protein (OD = 0.288) all were negative for the N protein by capture ELISA. this finding resulted in a test specificity of 99.9% (1 of 825)"}
