{"summary": "ARI is a self-limiting viral disease that causes mild symptoms such as fever, shivering, chills, malaise, and dry cough. most influenza-associated deaths occur in persons aged 65 yr or older with associated chronic disease (3). dietary supplements represent the most rapidly growing segment of the market. studies have shown that taking american ginseng extract as a prophylaxis during the influenza season in older adults reduced the incidence of acute respiratory illness in vaccinated (11) and non-vaccinated subjects (12, 13). ginseng has been well known for improving general quality-of-life, for exhibiting immuonmodulating effects, and for antidiabetic effects (14-18). the study products were provided to subjects every 4 weeks. subjects were asked to continue their usual diets and activity. subjects were asked not to take any other functional foods or dietary supplements. study drugs Korean red ginseng was produced by the process of steaming and drying from fresh ginseng cultivated in Jinan-Gun, Korea. fresh ginseng was steamed for 2 to 3 hr at 95\u00b0C and dried under the sun or with hot air. the symptom score was average, and the range was from 0 to 3. all subjects were asked to complete a daily log every morning. the total number of days of symptoms was calculated through telephone interviews every day until the symptoms disappeared. double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial at the onset of the influenza season at the Chonbuk National University Hospital. subjects who responded and met the inclusion criteria during a telephone screening interview were scheduled for a baseline visit. subjects were scheduled for a screening visit (within 3 weeks) where the informed consent was reviewed and signed. random number between 1 and 100 was generated by a computer for each subject. subjects were excluded if they had been vaccinated against influenza within 6 months. subjects were excluded if they had been vaccinated against influenza within 6 months. other exclusion criteria included: HIV infected or cancer patients. the sum of ginsenosides Rg1 and Rb1 used as quality control marker was above 7 mg/g. placebo and red ginseng extract were both prepared at the CheonJiYang Co. Ltd., Seoul, Korea. symptom duration and score were analyzed with the Mann Whitney U test and Fisher's exact test. the safety assessment was also done only with subjects that completed the study (per protocol, PP group) compliance The total number of prescribed capsules was 768.6 30.9 (P = 0.141) compliance reported taking more than 75% of the medication was high in both groups. 26.7% of those taking KRG and 21.3% of those taking placebo thought they had been given the KRG. the symptom duration and score of each symptom were calculated by sum during symptoms. the symptom duration was 5.2 2.3 day in the KRG group and 6.3 5.0 day in the placebo group (P = 0.475) the symptom duration was short, but there was no statistical difference between the two groups. anti-histamine usage was significantly more common in the placebo than in the placebo group. a total of 100 subjects failed to complete the study (KRG 1, placebo 1). compliance The total number of prescribed capsules was 768.6 30.9 (P = 0.141) compliance reported taking more than 75% of the medication was high in both groups; 95.2 4.7% in KRG, 94.0 7.2% in placebo group. symptom duration was 5.2 2.3 day in the KRG group and 6.3 5.0 day in the placebo group (P = 0.475). the symptom duration in the KRG group was short, but there was no statistical difference between the two groups (Table 3). the differences in the incidence of NSAIDs usage between the two groups were not statistically significant. the incidence of antibiotics usage was marginally more common in the placebo than in the placebo group. the effective absorption and digestion of various active compounds are considered to be the strength of red ginseng. it has been shown to have a broad range of biological activities including T-cell mediated immune reaction, as well as antioxidant and anti-tumor actions. the mean age of volunteers was 43, 60% female, and subjects were excluded if they had been vaccinated against influenza in the previous 6 months. the proportion of subjects with 2 or more Jackson-verified colds was significantly lower in the ginseng group than in the placebo group. this suggests that American ginseng is potentially effective for preventing acute respiratory illness. in our study, anti-histamine and antibiotics were used more frequently in the placebo group compared to the KRG group. we need more extensive clinical studies with clear statistical numberings."}
