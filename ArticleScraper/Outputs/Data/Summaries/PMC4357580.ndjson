{"summary": "enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) was first identified in 19621 and has since been associated with several small outbreaks in the united states and internationally. in the summer of 2014, hospitals in Missouri and Illinois began to report increases in severe respiratory illnesses in children. there is no commercially available clinical assay that specifically detects EV-D68 infection, and all US cases have been confirmed by state or CDC laboratories. respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 4, adenovirus, human coronaviruses, human rhinovirus (HRV) and human bocavirus were tested. samples negative for all respiratory viruses in our panel were tested using the same EV-D68 RT-PCR assay. the amplified product bands were purified from an agarose gel using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Toronto, ON) and sequenced using the inner forward and reverse primers (GeneWiz Sequencing Corporation, South Plainfield, NJ) Sequences were compared with reference sequences of EV-D68 species acquired from GenBank. the remaining patients had underlying conditions including asthma (n = 2), HIV (n = 3), heart disease (n = 2), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (n = 1), and alcohol abuse (n = 1). two were admitted for respiratory symptoms, including 1 patient who required brief intensive care unit care and mechanical ventilation.

EV-D68 is the true pathogen in 10% of HRV cases and up to 5% of overall cases during peak circulation of this enterovirus strain. this testing methodology could be useful in the clinical setting for infection-prevention purposes. current respiratory viral testing systems may not be sufficient to detect and therefore prevent nosocomial transmission of EV-D68. future studies may also be important as novel therapies become available."}
