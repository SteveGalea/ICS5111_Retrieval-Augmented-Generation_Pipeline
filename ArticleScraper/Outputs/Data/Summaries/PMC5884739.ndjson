{"summary": "Carbapenemases belong to Ambler classes A, B, or D, with class A and D enzymes possessing a serine-based hydrolytic mechanism. a rare instance of class C -lactamase that is reported to hydrolyze imipenem (CMY-10) class A Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) has been extensively reported in K. pneumoniae and other Enterobacteriaceae. class B -lactamases, or metallo-lactamases, are commonly identified in Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. ten variants of blaOXA-48 -lactamases are acknowledged and increasingly reported worldwide [9], notably among ourocomial K. pneumoniae and community Escherichia coli isolates. other less common carbapenemases belonging to a variety of molecular classes (eg, class A FRI-1 and IMI-like -lactamases, class B SPM-1 and GIM-1, and class D OXA-198) are reported spo the modified Hodge test (MHT) is probably the most extensively described CDT used in Enterobacteriaceae. it shows acceptable sensitivity for most carbapenemases, especially KPC enzymes, but low sensitivity for NDM-producing strains. a modified version of the CIM (mCIM) was evaluated in a multicenter study. it showed 97% sensitivity and 99% specificity for detection of carbapenemase production in Enterobacteriaceae [18]. the mCIM was added to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute M100 document. conventional AST methods such as broth microdilution, disk diffusion, and gradient diffusion can be modified to detect different classes of carbapenemases by performing them in the absence and presence of small molecule inhibitors. these assays have reportedly high sensitivities and specificities. they are inexpensive and generally easy to implement and interpret, but require overnight incubation. a single patient colonized on admission with KPC-producing K. pneumoniae was eventually linked to CP-CRE colonization in 18 additional patients. the epidemiologic data could not discriminate between undetected transmission from the index patient or introduction of a second strain. the epidemiologic data could not discriminate between undetected transmission from the index patient or introduction of a second strain. studies show bias to report trials of successful combination chemotherapy. in most trials targeting CP-CRE, combination therapies have included the use of (i) colistin (polymyxin E) and a carbapenem; (ii) colistin and tigecycline, or colistin and fosfomycin; (iii) double carbapenem therapy. combination therapy with 2 or more agents in vitro was superior to monotherapy. lowest mortality rate (18.8%) was observed in patients treated with carbapenem-containing combinations. authors reported 50% mortality in patients treated with tigecycline and gentamicin. the combination of ceftazidime with avibactam restores in vitro susceptibility against all extended-spectrum -lactamases and most KPCs tested. studies comparing outcomes of infections with gram-negative bacteria treated with ceftazidime-avibactam as monotherapy or in combination with colistin are ongoing. fda recently approved ceftazidime-avibactam based on data obtained in Phase 2/3 trials of complicated urinary tract infections and intra-abdominal infections (ceftazidime-avibactam combined with metronidazole) the concern was that resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam would emerge in KPC-producing strains.

Canada and the European Union have made similar commitments."}
