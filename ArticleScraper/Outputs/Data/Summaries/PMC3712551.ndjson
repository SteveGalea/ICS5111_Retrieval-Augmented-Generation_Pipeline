{"summary": "hepatitis C virus (HCV)5 co-infection occurs in about one-third of subjects infected with HIV in the united states and Europe (1, 2). chronic HCV infection is the most common etiology (3\u20135) the most widely used clinical indicator of vitamin D status is 25(OH)D. efavirenz reduces 25(OH)D concentrations (43), ribavirin reduces serum calcium concentrations (44), ritonavir impairs bioactivation of vitamin D (45), and tenofovir causes elevations in parathyroid hormone. the trial enrolled 330 subjects from august 2004 to April 2007 from 36 ACTG sites within the united states. all subjects were treated with pegylated-interferon- 2a 180 g/wk plus weight-based ribavirin for 12 wk. patients with an EVR received a total of 72 wk of PEG/ribavirin therapy. 25(OH)D was analyzed as a continuous variable by using a cutoff of 30 ng/mL (51). Viral load tests and treatment outcomes HCV RNA was tested by using the Roche Cobas Amplicor assay with a lower detection limit of 600 IU/mL. HOMA-IR was calculated by using the subject's fasting glucose and fasting insulin concentrations: HOMA-IR = (fasting glucose fasting insulin)/405. a logistic regression model was developed to assess factors associated with 25(OH)D. patients with an EVR received 72 wk of PEG/ribavirin therapy. patients without an EVR received a total of 72 wk of PEG/ribavirin therapy. HIV RNA was tested by using Roche Ultrasensitive HIV reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction with a lower limit of quantification of 50 copies/mL. SVR was defined as undetectable HCV RNA at 24 wk after treatment cessation. covariates were of interest to characterize the study population. 144 study subjects were predominantly male and non-Hispanic black. most subjects were receiving HAART, and 38.2% were taking ritonavir. median 25(OH)D concentration was 22.5 ng/mL [quartile 1 = 14.0; quartile 3 = 29.0] concentration, had a lower HCV viral load, and had a higher percentage with the favorable IL28B CC genotype (Table 1).

DISCUSSION We found no significant association between serum 25(OH)D concentration and EVR or SVR in this clinical trial of PEG/ribavirin treatment of HIV/HCV co-infected subjects. 25(OH)D concentrations in the range 16\u201320 ng/mL are expected to have limited ability to predict vitamin D status. the need to use a combination of factors to establish vitamin D status is especially great in patients receiving HAART because antiviral drugs cause complex alterations in vitamin D and calcium metabolism. our results add to the growing literature on 25(OH)D concentrations and virologic responses to HCV therapy (28\u201333, 35\u201337-39). Previously, an investigation in HIV/HCV co-infected patients conducted in Austria reported a positive relation between 25(OH)D concentrations and SVR (39), whereas a study conducted in France found no association (38), in keeping with our results."}
