{"summary": "the interferon (IFN) system is an integral component of innate immunity. it is triggered by sensors that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and induce signaling cascades that trigger the production of IFN (1, 2). Binding of IFN to IFN receptors then induces the expression of IFN-stimulated genes. al factors failed to detect an IFITM-dependent blockade of HIV-1 infection (4, 6), but subsequent studies reported that IFITMs restrict HIV and SIV entry (11, 17, 18) the negative impact on infectivity might be due to IFITM interactions with Env. 293T target cells previously transduced to express IFITMs or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase as a negative control were chosen as targets for transduction. entry of MLV and SIV vectors pseudotyped with FLUAV-HA/NA was only modestly reduced by IFITM proteins. expression of all IFITM proteins reduced entry of VSV vectors bearing MLV-Env, SIV-Env, or FLUAV-HA by at least Western blot analysis of SIV-Env incorporation in MLV, SIV, and VSV particles did not point toward major differences. a comparison of the luciferase values measured in lysates of transduced cells revealed that relative sensitivity to IFITM was not linked to entry efficiency. Alternatively, gene expression from VSV but not MLV or SIV vectors might be inhibited by IFITMs. the sensitivity of intact VSV to blockade by IFITM proteins and tetherin (24) depends on the vector. 293T cells were transduced to express the indicated IFITMs or CAT as a control. transduction of control cells was set as 100%. culture supernatants were collected, concentrated by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion and analyzed for SIV-Env, MLV-Gag, SIV-Gag, and VSV-M proteins by Western blotting. similar results were obtained in a separate experiment. the results of a single experiment performed with triplicate samples are shown. Error bars indicate SD. Similar results were obtained in two separate experiments. a simple, two-component system was carried out for normalized data. IFITM sensitivity of SIV-Env-driven entry depends on the efficiency of Env incorporation into virions. the differences in the amount of Env incorporated into virions had no effect on IFITM sensitivity of MLV-Env-driven entry. transfection of 293T cells with equal amounts of vector plasmid and indicated amounts of Env-encoding plasmids determines IFITM sensitivity. equal volumes of the vector preparations were then inoculated onto 293T cells previously transduced to express IFITMs. luciferase expression in cell lysates was analyzed at 72 h postransduction. several studies employed vector systems to determine if viral entry is blocked by IFITM expression (6, 7, 22, 27) we observed that SIV-Env- and MLV-Env-driven entry is IFITM sensitive when these glycoproteins are presented in the context of VSV, but not MLV or SIV, particles. these findings were not due to a differential impact of IFITMs on retroviral or rhabdoviral gene expression. the amount of MLV-Env (present study) or EBOV-GP (27) inserted into particles does not modulate IFITM sensitivity. these discrepant observations might be accounted for by differential inhibition of these glycoproteins by IFITMs. the recent demonstration that Env and IFITMs interact in transfected cells raises the question of whether such interactions also occur during entry. in this case, increasing the amount of SIV-Env in the particle envelope might allow the En 293T target cells previously transduced to express IFITMs or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase as a negative control were chosen as targets for transduction. entry of MLV and SIV vectors pseudotyped with FLUAV-HA/NA was reduced by 60 to 80% upon expression of IFITM2 and IFITM3. entry of retroviral particles bearing SIV-Env was only modestly reduced by IFITM proteins. a comparison of the luciferase values measured in lysates of transduced cells revealed that relative sensitivity to IFITM was not linked to entry efficiency. Alternatively, gene expression from VSV but not MLV or SIV vectors might be inhibited by IFITMs. transduction of these cells by VSV vectors bearing Machupo virus glycoprotein (MACV-GPC) was only slightly inhibited by IFITMs. sensitivity to IFITM depends on the vector. 293T cells were transduced to express the indicated IFITMs or CAT as a control. transduction of control cells was set as 100%. error bars indicate standard errors of the means. analyzed for SIV-Env, MLV-Gag, SIV-Gag, and VSV-M proteins. similar results were obtained in a separate experiment. VSV-G was chosen for pseudotyping of the Gag and VP40 particles. the target cells were transfected to express the fragment of -galactosidase. v incorporation into virions and in sensitivity to IFITM (17) stimulated us to investigate whether these two processes are linked. we produced MLV particles in cells transfected with increasing amounts of SIV-Env- or MLV-Env-encoding plasmids. differences in the amount of Env incorporated into virions had no effect on IFITM sensitivity of MLV-driven entry. the results of a single representative experiment conducted with triplicate samples are shown. equal volumes of the vector preparations were then inoculated onto 293T cells previously transduced to express IFITMs. the results were confirmed in three separate experiments. these findings were not due to differential transduction efficiency or major differences in particle incorporation of Env. however, these observations were not due to a differential impact of IFITMs on retroviral or rhabdoviral gene expression. notably, virus-like particles (spherical) exhibited a higher sensitivity toward inhibition by IFITM2 and -3 than the corresponding particles based on EBOV VP40 (filamentous) amphotericin B treatment rescues SIV but not EBOV-GP-mediated entry from blockade by IFITMs (17, 27) the recent demonstration that Env and IFITMs interact in transfected cells raises the question of whether such interactions also occur during entry and might contribute to the IFITM-mediated entry blockade. in this case, increasing the amount of SIV-Env in the particle envelope might allow the Env to surpass in titer the IFITM molecules plasmids encoding EBOV VP40 and HIV-1 p55 Gag fused with the fragment of -galactosidase and the plasmid encoding the fragment of -galactosidase have been documented previously. a previously reported FLUAV encoding Gaussia luciferase was used. gene is flanked by identical restriction sites for convenient cloning. only the leader and trailer sequences of the parental VSV genome were left between the T7 promoter (T7Pro) at the 5\u2032 end and a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (HDV-R) and the T7 terminator (T7Ter) at the 3\u2032 end. 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding MLV gag-pol and VSV-G. supernatants were sterile filtered through a 0.45-m filter, aliquoted, and stored at 80\u00b0C. the cells were washed and finally received fresh culture medium supplemented with (MACV-GPC, NiV-F/G, FLUAV-HA/NA, MLV-Env, and SIV-Env pseudotyped vectors) after an additional incubation period of 16 to 20 h, VSV pseudoparticle-containing supernatants were collected, clarified from cell debris by centrifugation. luciferase cell culture lysis reagent (Promega) in PBS was added to each well. the wells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature before the cell lysate was transferred to a white, opaque-walled 96-well plate. fLuc activity was displayed either in counts per second (c.p.s.) or as normalized values. 6,000 cells per well were seeded in 96-well plates and then transfected with siRNAs directed against IFITM3 (Santa Cruz) at 48 h posttransfection, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM and the cells were transduced with the MLV vector encoding luciferase and pseudotyped with SIV-Env. anti-MLV-p30 mouse antibody (Acris) was detected using mouse monoclonal antibody (55-2F12) anti-VSV-M detection was performed using an anti-VSV-M antibody (Kerafast) a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Dianova) was used for detection using a commercially available kit (Amersham) neuraminidase was coexpressed during particle production to ensure efficient particle release. neuraminidase (33), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) (34), vesicular stomatitis virus (NiV-F, NiV-G) (35), Machupo virus (35), and SIVmac239 (SIV-Env) have been described previously. chimeric reporter gene was fused via a linker sequence (GGG CCC GAT CCT CCT GCT ACT) to generate expression plasmids for VSV-N, -P, and -L. the respective ORFs from the pUC18_VSV24* plasmid were amplified by PCR and inserted into the pCAGGS vector by restriction digest. reporter particles, 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding fLuc. supernatants were harvested at 48 h posttransfection. supernatants were sterile filtered through a 0.45-m filter, aliquoted. 293T cells were seeded at a density of 104 cells per well in 96-well plates. then spinoculated (41) at 4,000 g for 30 min with IFITM- or CAT-encoding vectors. after incubating the cells for 48 h at 37\u00b0C, the cells were replaced by 150 l of fresh culture medium. the measurement of the fLuc activity was carried out in a microplate reader, Plate Chameleon V (Hidex) using the microWin2000 software (version 4.44; Mikrotek Laborsysteme GmbH) and fLuc substrates from the commercial luciferase assay system (Promega) or Beetle-Juice (PJK) kits. target cells were prepared as described above and inoculated with VSV pseudotypes for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% 6,000 cells per well were seeded in 96-well plates and then transfected with siRNAs directed against IFITM3 (Santa Cruz) at 48 h posttransfection, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM and the cells were transduced with the MLV vector encoding luciferase. cells were inoculated with a Gaussia luciferase-encoding influenza virus at an MOI of 10. DA6 recognizes an epitope within gp120 (42). a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled goat anti-mouse antibody (Dianova) was used."}
