{"summary": "progression to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis requires an inflammatory component (1, 2). the fibrogenic process is a continuous wound healing response mediated by hepatic stellate cell activation. hepatic macrophages play an important role in all stages of liver disease. macrophages are characterized by their high plasticity in response to their microenvironment. this macrophage differentiation is dependent on regulatory cascades controlled by interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) (11) we have recently documented that the fifth member of the IRFs, IRF5, is expressed in myeloid cells and responsible for M1 macrophage polarization. we quantified mRNA levels of IRF5 in liver biopsies from subjects with normal liver, fatty liver, and hepatic fibrosis. the expression of IRF5 was strongly induced with fibrosis, but not with fatty liver (steatosis) correlative analyses of IRF5 mRNA expression with plasma aspartate and alanine transaminase (AST and ALT, respectively) levels, bilirubin levels, and prothrombin time from the same cohort of patients. fibrogenesis was assessed by red picrosirius staining. structural damage was assessed by H&E staining. expression of IRF5 was not modulated in liver or liver macrophages of mice fed a high-fat diet (16) increased expression was specific to liver macrophages. no modulation of IRF5 was seen in hepatocytes or F4/80\u2013 cells. expression in macrophages correlated with several markers of disease progression. fibrosis, liver collagen type 1 alpha 1 (Col11) mRNA expression, plasma aspartate transferase (AST) and alanine transferase (ALT) and liver F4/80 mRNA expression. differences between diets/treatments determined by 1-way ANOVA. the protected liver phenotype in MKO mice was reflected by decreased plasma transaminase levels in MKO mice relative to MWT mice in both models. these results indicate a lower degree of liver damage and remodeling in MKO mice upon MCD, BDL, or CCl4 treatment. mice with myeloid-specific deletion of interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) were maintained on a methionine and choline\u2013deficient (MCD) diet or underwent liver sections from CTRL mice maintained on a normal chow diet and from mice maintained on MCD, BDL, or CCl4. representative images of SMA IHC of liver sections from CTRL mice maintained on a normal chow diet. myeloid deficiency of IRF5 alters macrophage number and phenotype in liver fibrosis. wild-type mice and mice with myeloid-specific deletion of interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) were maintained on a methionine and choline\u2013deficient (MCD) diet or underwent bile duct ligation (BDL) for induction of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. transcriptomic analyses revealed 1,300 differentially expressed transcripts between MWT and MWT mice. proinflammatory genes (IL1, IL6, MHC II, TNF) were downregulated, while antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive genes (TGF1, IL10, ARG1, CD206) were upregulated. CCl4 knockout alters hepatic macrophage transcriptome response to experimental fibrosis. wild-type (MWT) mice and mice with myeloid-specific deletion of interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) were maintained on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) for induction of experimental fibrosis. apoptosis terms were significantly enriched among downregulated transcripts in the hepatic F4/80+ cells from MWT. TUNEL+ staining, histologically localized to hepatocytes, was observed in liver from MWT but not MKO mice. 4/80+CD11b+ macrophages from IRF5 MKO mice have defective FasL and TNF release compared with MWT mice. IHC analysis had revealed similar localization of FasL- and TUNEL-positive staining, confirming hepatocytes as targets of Fas-induced apoptosis in MWT mice. apoptosis was confirmed to be Fas induced, with increased FasL+ staining in MWT but not MKO liver. we also found a strong induction of TUNEL+ apoptotic/necrotic bodies in MWT but not MKO liver. analysis of IRF5 recruitment to DNA in bone marrow\u2013derived macrophages revealed that IRF5 binds to the upstream region of the FasL gene after stimulation with LPS quantification of IRF5+ staining and IRF5 mRNA expression in hepatic F4/80+ liver mononuclear cells (LMNCs) representative images of CD11c+ or CD206+ macrophages among LMNCs of MWT and MKO mice after acute CCl4 toxicity. expression of type 1 (IFN) and type 17 (IL17) cytokines was decreased among CD4+ T cells in MKO relative to MWT mice. hepatocyte deficiency of IRF5 desensitizes hepatocytes to Fas-induced apoptosis. a TUNEL assay confirmed the appearance of apoptotic bodies only in MWT mice and not in MKO mice. liver damage seen in MWT mice was associated with an induction of IRF5 expression in F4/80+ cells in response to Jo2 treatment. we then measured expression of target pro- and antiinflammatory genes expressed from F4/80+ cells. hepatic F4/80+ liver mononuclear cells (LMNCs) in MWT and MKO mice after Jo2 administration. quantification of inflammatory marker expression in hepatic F4/80+ LMNCs. hepatocyte desensitization to Fas receptor\u2013mediated apoptosis. antiapoptotic response in IRF5 knockout is maintained under metabolic stress. we investigated apoptotic phenotype and inflammatory response in liver of MWT and MKO mice. wild-type (MWT) mice and mice with myeloid-specific deletion of interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) were maintained on a methionine and choline\u2013deficient diet or underwent bile duct ligation (BDL) for the induction of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. mRNA expression in human liver biopsies was significantly induced in hepatic fibrosis and NASH. the expression of both Fas and FasL increased with increasing fibrosis stage. we found significant positive correlation with plasma transaminases and bilirubin. the IRF5/FasL/Fas axis is implicated in pathogenesis of human NASH. mRNA expression in liver biopsies from control patients with normal liver (n = 7) and patients with fatty liver (n = 10), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (n = 8), and hepatitis C virus infection (HCV; n = 11). proinflammatory activation induces inflammatory cytokine and death effector release that induces hepatocyte caspase (Casp)\u2013dependent apoptosis. proinflammatory activation induces type 1 and type 17 responses from CD4+ T cells. IRF5 is expressed in human hepatic macrophages and is induced in human hepatic fibrosis. mRNA expression in liver biopsies from control patients with normal liver (n = 7) and patients with fatty liver (n = 10), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (n = 8), and hepatitis C virus infection (HCV; n = 11). IRF5 expression correlated positively with plasma transaminases and bilirubin levels, and negatively with prothrombin time. these observations in humans strongly suggest that IRF5 is involved in the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis. both IRF5 and F4/80 localized to sinusoidal regions, inflammatory infiltrates, and fibrous septa. increased expression was specific to liver macrophages, while no modulation of IRF5 was seen in hepatocytes or F4/80\u2013 cells. correlations were determined for fibrosis, liver collagen type 1 alpha 1 (Col11) mRNA expression, plasma aspartate transferase (AST) and alanine transferase (ALT) for normal chow\u2013, MCD-, BDL-, and CCl4-treated mice, n = 6 per group. livers from MKO mice underwent significantly less structural change (H&E staining) than those of MWT mice. quantification of fibrosis (RP staining) revealed decreased accumulation of collagen in MKO mice. HSC activation, a major process leading to collagen deposition (20), was also decreased in MKO mice. IRF5 in liver sections from control mice maintained on a normal chow diet and from mice maintained on MCD, BDL, or CCl4. representative images of RP staining on liver sections from CTRL mice maintained on a normal chow diet. macrophage number was strongly reduced in liver from MKO mice compared with MWT mice under all treatments. a phenotypic switch in the macrophage population, with a decrease in CD11c+ macrophages and an increase in CD206+ macrophages in MKO relative to MWT mice. transcriptomic analyses revealed 1,300 differentially expressed transcripts between MWT and MWT mice. proinflammatory genes (IL1, IL6, MHC II, TNF) were downregulated. antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive genes (TGF1, IL10, ARG1, CD206) were upregulated. differential expression of these inflammatory genes was then confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis. we also observed a significant reduction in CCL2 mRNA expression levels in MKO macrophages. enriched GO terms represented normal metabolic functions of liver F4/80+ cells from MKO relative to MWT mice. apoptosis terms were significantly enriched among downregulated transcripts in the hepatic F4/80+ cells from MWT and MKO mice following CCl4 treatment. TUNEL+ staining, histologically localized to hepatocytes, was observed in liver from MWT but not MKO mice, confirming downregulation of cell death. hepatic macrophages from MWT mice have defective FasL and TNF release compared with MWT mice. IRF5 expression was also strongly induced in MWT mice. in MWT mice accumulation of inflammatory CD11c+ macrophages was reduced. in MWT, accumulation of inflammatory CD11c+ macrophages was reduced. in MWT mice accumulation of inflammatory CD11c+ macrophages was reduced. wild-type mice and mice with myeloid-specific deletion of interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) were administered a single dose of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) for induction of acute toxicity. representative images of HE staining of liver sections from MWT and MKO mice after acute CCl4 toxicity. quantification of Fas, B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and BCL-extra large (BCL-XL) mRNA expression in primary hepatocytes from MWT and MKO mice after acute CCl4 toxicity. myeloid deficiency of IRF5 desensitizes hepatocytes to Fas-induced apoptosis. we applied a model to directly stimulate the Fas death receptor by administration of an anti-Fas antibody (Jo2 clone) MWT mice showed complete protection from Jo2 treatment, and liver structure was maintained. IRF5 deficiency desensitizes hepatocytes to Fas receptor stimulation. wild-type (MWT) mice and mice with myeloid-specific deletion of interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) were administered an anti-Fas antibody (Jo2) for induction of apoptosis. CD25+CD4+ T cells, and of IL10, IL17, IFN expression by CD4+ T cells among LMNCs from MWT and MWT mice after Jo2 administration. the lack of IRF5 in liver macrophages increases differentiation of FoxP3+CD4+ T cells and expression of IL10 rather than IL17 and IFN. FasL expression was decreased in MKO compared with MWT mice. expression of immunosuppressive and antiinflammatory genes (IL10, TGF) was increased. expression of proinflammatory and proapoptotic genes (TNF, FasL) was decreased. IL10, IL17, and IFN expression in LMNCs from MWT and MKO mice upon MCD and BDL. quantification of IL10, IL17, and IFN expression by CD4+ T cells. n = 6 per group. the expression of both Fas and FasL increased with increasing fibrosis stage (Figure 9B) the expression of both Fas and FasL increased with increasing fibrosis stage (Figure 9B) and was independent of steatosis (Figure 7A) we found significant positive correlations with plasma transaminases and bilirubin. we have demonstrated an IRF5-dependent regulatory cascade that controls response to hepatocellular stress and development of liver fibrosis. we have demonstrated through the use of murine models of hepatocellular stress arising from metabolic stress, toxic stress, and direct cell death receptor stimulation. progression from benign steatosis to pathological steatohepatitis and fibrosis is largely driven by inflammation. inflammatory activation in NASH is well documented as part of the systemic inflammation that characterizes obesity and type 2 diabetes. decreased fibrosis in IRF5 deficiency is decreased HSC activation. strongest known cytokine inducers of HSC activation are IL1, TNF, and TGF (26). pathological effects of TGF in liver disease have been well documented. the apoptotic process is mediated by death receptor stimulation and the formation of complexes cleaved at initiator then executioner caspases. checkpoints, such as BCL2, can inhibit progression to the terminal caspase or maintain cell structural integrity through other means. three effector groups are involved in apoptosis: extrinsic factors (viruses, xenobiotics, etc.) chlodronate liposome abolition of KCs prevents apoptosis following acute CCl4 toxicity. we demonstrate that altering macrophage inflammatory polarization is sufficient to ameliorate hepatic response to CCl4 toxicity and in turn prevents experimental fibrosis. the protective effect of IRF5 inhibition is rooted in antiinflammatory macrophage activation, IL10 release, and rapid expansion of immunosuppressive CD4+FoxP3+ T cells. early hepatoprotection prevents progression of NAFLD beyond benign steatosis. mice were kept and housed under conventional conditions at the UPMC. up to 5 mice were housed per cage under 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycles temperature controlled at 23\u00b0C. mice carrying mutated alleles were identified by PCR screening of purified genomic DNA. control animals received a normal chow diet with ad libitum access to food and water. a complete ligation of the bile duct was carried as previously described. mice were kept up to 10 days with the ligature in place (initiation and progression of fibrosis) tissues were dropped-fixed in 10 % formalin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 hours. tissue was then put through an automated carousel processor for dehydration, clearing, and paraffin embedding (Leica) sections were prepared at 6 M thick on poly-l\u2013lysinated slides (Sigma-Aldrich, VWR) quantitative expression of immunostainings was performed using positive pixels algorithm (Indica Labs) on digital slides. results are expressed as percentage of positive pixels. each biological replicate represented one slide, representing 3 technical replicates. resuspended in RPMI + 2 % (vol/vol) fetal calf serum + 40 % (vol/vol) Percoll. the gradient was centrifuged for 20 minutes at 800 g. samples were agitated for 3 minutes at room temperature, then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 500 g. staining was carried out at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. cells were then washed, resuspended in flow cytometry staining buffer. staining was carried out at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes in the dark. cells were stimulated either with 1 g/ml LPS (macrophage stimulation) or 500 ng/ml PMA and 500 ng/ml ionomycin (lymphocyte stimulation) in RPMI 1640 + 10% (vol/vol) fetal calf serum. cells were then blocked and washed by centrifugation before staining surface and intracellular epitopes. poly N read tails were trimmed, reads 40 bases were removed and reads with quality mean 30 were discarded. reads were then aligned against the genome using STAR (version 2.4.0k) (44), and Ensembl annotation version 81 Alignments from reads matching more than once on the reference genome were removed using the Java version of SAMtools (45). liver samples were obtained from 36 patients by surgical resection. only patients without a clinical history of cirrhosis were included. mice were crossed with lysozyme 2 (Lyz2) Cre mice (B6.129P2-Lyz2tm1(cre)Ifo/J; stock no. 017311) on a C57BL6/J background and backcrossed for 10 generations before application to studies. both IRF5fl/fl mice and Lyz2 Cre mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. normal chow animals received a normal chow diet with ad libitum access to food and water. blood samples were collected into heparinized or EDTA-coated tubes (Sarstedt) by cardiac puncture or from the retro-orbital sinus, shortly after mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. RP staining was used to visualize collagen fibers following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. sections were quenched with 3% H2O2 for 15 minutes at room temperature. sections were then blocked with TBS + 0.1 % (vol/vol) Tween-20. sections were then incubated with diluted primary antibodies. the liver was perfused with collagenase solution, then cut into small pieces. hepatocyte fraction was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 40 g. supernatant was removed, and pellet was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. samples were agitated for 3 minutes at room temperature, centrifuged for 10 minutes at 500 g. resulting pellet was resuspended in flow cytometry staining buffer. cells were counted and redistributed according to applications. 106 cells and 3 106 cells were taken for surface and intracellular staining. cells were centrifuged at 4\u00b0C at 500 g for 5 minutes and then resuspended in flow cytometry staining buffer containing fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies. libraries were prepared using the strand-specific RNA-Seq library preparation TruSeq Stranded mRNA kit (Illumina) libraries were multiplexed by 6 on a run. a mean of 38 3 million passing Illumina quality filter reads was obtained for each of the 6 samples. all overlapping regions between alignments and referenced exons were counted using HTSeq-count 0.5.3 (46). the sample counts were normalized using DESeq 1.8.3 (47).
