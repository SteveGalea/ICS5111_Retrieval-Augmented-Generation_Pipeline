{"summary": "72 (48.65%) of 148 survivors consented to be registered and underwent assessments at 12 months (T1) and 18 months (T2) after the MERS outbreak, 72 (48.65%) were evaluated for chronic fatigue, depressive symptoms, and PTSSs based on the Impact of Event ScaleRevised (IES-R), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) fatigue and psychiatric co-morbidities were common in SARS survivors. fatigue and psychiatric co-morbidities, including depression, anxiety, and panic disorder, were common in survivors of EVD 1 year after the outbreak. study will examine the longitudinal mediating effects of depressions between chronic fatigue and later PTSSs for the MERS survivors. participants completed several scales, including the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). items are rated on a scale of 1 to 7 according to their level of agreement with a given statement. values for each item were averaged for a composite score. higher scores indicating higher levels of impairment from fatigue and fatigue was largely independent of self-reported depressive symptoms. Pearson\u2019s correlation analyses were used to determine the relationships between chronic fatigue (T1 FSS), depression (T1 PHQ, T2 PHQ), and PTSS (T2 IES). serial multiple-mediated-effects analyses were conducted with 5,000 bootstrapping repetitions. only data from 52 subjects who completed both assessments were analyzed. participants completed several scales, including the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). items are rated on a scale of 1 to 7 according to their level of agreement with a given statement. the IES-R was designed to assess symptoms associated with PTSD following a traumatic life event (MERS infection in our study) Symptoms are measured on 22 self-reported items for a total subjective stress assessment that can be further divided into intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal subscales. a total score 25 is considered clinically significant [15]. nearly one-third (30.77%, n=16) had suffered from other medical illnesses before contracting MERS. 13.46% (n=7) had received previous psychiatric care before contracting MERS. the mean number of days from symptoms to the confirmed diagnosis was 4.50 (SD=4.12) and the mean total days of illness was 23.00 (SD=27.11) about 36.54% (n=19) of participants had suffered from pneumonia, 19.23% (n=10) had been treated with a ventilator, and 3.85% (n=2) had been treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during the acute MERS treatment period.

DISCUSSION Chronic fatigue 12 months post-MERS had indirect effects on prolonged PTSSs 18 months post-MERS via persisting depression. fatigue is a prominent disabling symptom in a variety of medical and neurologic disorders. the Coronavirus itself may have directly caused sleep disorders, fatigue, and behavioral symptoms, which in turn may have resulted in chronic post-inflammatory central nervous system pathologies that adversely affected sleep. mental health and fatigue symptoms were evaluated using self-reported measures that are not diagnostic in nature but result in assessments of symptomatology. however, these measures have demonstrated validity and reliability in Korea and are consistently correlated with more comprehensive diagnostic tools used to assess corresponding symptoms."}
