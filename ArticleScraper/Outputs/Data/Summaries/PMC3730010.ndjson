{"summary": "the southern Nevada health district recruited five pediatric medical practices to serve as sentinel sites for the pediatric early warning sentinel surveillance program. the program was evaluated using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Updated Guidelines for Evaluating public health surveillance systems. sample collection Each week, sentinel site staff collected nasal swab samples from the first 10 children who presented at the facility with acute respiratory illness characterized by a fever (100 F). each extracted nucleic acid sample was analyzed on the Applied Biosystems\u00ae 7500 Fast DX. results reporting Each PEWSS site received a written report for the samples submitted from its site. the results of the weekly molecular testing were also submitted to the CDC National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System using a Web-based reporting system. the CDC Guidelines recommend using the following six tasks to evaluate a public health surveillance system. PEWSS stakeholders were defined as those who receive the weekly information (the general public, which includes medical health professionals; the scientific community; and the lay population) the electronic link to the general public survey was e-mailed or faxed. the guidelines define nine attributes that affect the usefulness and completeness of a public health surveillance system. we rated PEWSS against the following attributes on a scale of high, medium, low, or not applicable. the guidelines also define nine attributes that affect the usefulness and completeness of a public health surveillance system. sample collection Each week, sentinel site staff collected nasal swab samples from the first 10 children who presented at the facility with acute respiratory illness characterized by a fever (100 F) and one or both of two symptoms, cough and/or sore throat. each extracted nucleic acid sample was analyzed on the Applied Biosystems\u00ae 7500 Fast DX Real-Time PCR Instrument (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, California) each extracted nucleic acid sample was analyzed using the CDC11 and APHL real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction protocols for influenza, HMPV, adenovirus, RSV, and parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3. results reporting Each PEWSS site received a written report the CDC Guidelines recommend using the following six tasks to evaluate a public health surveillance system. PEWSS stakeholders were defined as those who receive the weekly information (the general public, which includes medical health professionals; the scientific community; and the lay population) and those who provide the data (sentinel site staff) the Guidelines define nine attributes that affect the usefulness and completeness of a public health surveillance system. PEWSS stakeholders were defined as those who receive the weekly information (the general public, which includes medical health professionals; the scientific community; and the lay population) the sentinel site survey was e-mailed or faxed along with two weekly PEWSS bulletins. participation in the survey was voluntary. data quality\u2014completeness and validity of the data Timeliness\u2014speed between steps in a system Representativeness\u2014the occurrence of a health-related event over time and its distribution in the population Sensitivity\u2014proportion of reported cases that actually have the health-related event under surveillance Tasks E and F: justify and state conclusions and recommendations, and ensure the use of evaluation findings. of the 19 public stakeholder survey respondents, 17 (89.5%) replied that they frequently read the weekly PEWSS report. of these respondents, 12 (70.6%) and five (29.4%) respondents reported reading the reports weekly and frequently, respectively. more than 80% of the public survey respondents rated the information within the PEWSS bulletins as very timely, accurate, relevant, and useful. sentinel sites primarily received their weekly PEWSS bulletins by fax and e-mail, with eight (42.1%) and four (21.1%) respondents indicating they read them every week or frequently but not every week. nearly all sentinel respondents thought the information in the weekly PEWSS bulletins was timely, accurate, relevant, useful, and easy to read and understand. priority system attributes identified by our agency for evaluating the PEWSS system were simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, and stability. a surveillance system may be considered useful if it satisfactorily addresses at least one of six questions. the weekly PEWSS bulletins emphasize the need for public health prevention during peak pathogen circulation. however, the PEWSS program did not provide estimates of the magnitude of morbidity and mortality related to circulating respiratory diseases. six of the nine attributes were rated as high, one was rated medium, and two attributes were not applicable to the program objectives. sentinel-based surveillance does not allow the results to be generalized to the entire population of pediatrics in the community. Sensitivity and predictive value positive attributes were not applicable to the PEWSS program. CDC = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention PEWSS = Pediatric Early Warning Sentinel Surveillance SNHD = Southern Nevada Health District PVP = predictive value positive Although they also cause substantial illnesses, 6,13,14 non-influenza viruses under surveillance by the PEWSS program were not reportable illnesses. future plans include expansion of the PEWSS test menu to survey rhinovirus,16,17 coronavirus,18,19 and pertussis. public stakeholders included physicians, nurses, laboratory staff, educators, administration staff, and day care providers. of the 19 public stakeholder survey respondents, 17 (89.5%) replied that they frequently read the weekly PEWSS report. of these respondents, 12 (70.6%) and five (29.4%) respondents reported reading the reports weekly and frequently, respectively. sentinel sites primarily received their weekly PEWSS bulletins by fax and e-mail, with eight (42.1%) and four (21.1%) respondents indicating they read them every week or frequently but not every week. the majority of sentinel respondents said they use the bulletins for general information, and eight (42.1%) said they use the information to guide their clinical diagnoses. priority system attributes identified by our agency for evaluating the PEWSS system were simplicity, flexibility, acceptability, and stability. a surveillance system may be considered useful if it satisfactorily addresses at least one of six questions. ed weekly to the community to inform health professionals about respiratory pathogens circulating in the community. this information may help clinicians inform their patients of the viral etiology of the diseases. the weekly PEWSS bulletins emphasize the need for public health prevention during peak pathogen circulation. data quality was rated high: Specimens for analysis were collected three times a week. results were analyzed and reports summarizing the surveillance results were distributed to the community once a week. CDC = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention PEWSS = Pediatric Early Warning Sentinel Surveillance SNHD = Southern Nevada Health District PVP = predictive value positive. future plans include expansion of the PEWSS test menu to survey rhinovirus,16,17 coronavirus,18,19 and pertussis. public stakeholders reported that the most useful information provided by the PEWSS bulletins was the weekly update on the current viral pathogens circulating in the community. their suggested changes to the weekly PEWSS bulletin included adding more sentinel sites, changing graph displays, and adding national influenza data or more technical information regarding the surveyed pathogens. staff members who collected the PEWSS specimens were physicians, nurses, or medical assistants. they also used the weekly bulletins to show their patients the viruses circulating in the community and to reinforce the idea of not using antibiotics when viruses were circulating widely. nineteen responses were received among the five sentinel sites. eight of the sentinel respondents (42.1%) were physicians. sentinel sites primarily received their weekly PEWSS bulletins. the laboratory calculated the average cost of sample analysis as $55 per sample. a total of 872 samples were tested during the evaluation period. the total annual operating cost (personnel and supplies) for the program was $113,141. the following results show that PEWSS exceeded this program usefulness criterion by satisfactorily answering three of six program usefulness questions. the program: Detected current circulating respiratory pathogens, which may help to increase awareness of prevention measures to limit the spread of these pathogens. all sentinel sites expressed their eagerness to continue their participation in the program. their enthusiasm and dedication earned each of the sites the 2011 SNHD Public Health Heroes Award. the PEWSS public health surveillance system was simple, flexible, operationally stable, timely, and well accepted by stakeholders. as defined by CDC Guidelines, these attributes indicate that the system will likely be more useful and complete for public health action. the CDC Guidelines provided a standardized format for our evaluation of the PEWSS program. the first limitation was that samples collected from sentinel surveillance were not representative of the general public. the cost of starting and maintaining a surveillance system may serve as a potential hurdle for public health agencies that want to institute such programs. the SNHD also committed funds toward the continuation of the program. PEWSS met three of six program usefulness criteria and seven of nine surveillance system attributes."}
