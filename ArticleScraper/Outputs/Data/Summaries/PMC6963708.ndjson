{"summary": "feline coronavirus (FCoV) is a positive-sense RNA virus in the species Alphacoronavirus 1 genus Alphacoronaivirus, of the subfamily Coronaviridae. it is divided into two serotypes (types I and II) based on the amino acid sequence of the spike (S) protein [2]. FCoV can also be divided into two biotypes, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIP virus, the triazole antifungal agent itraconazole blocks the intracellular trafficking of cholesterol and inhibits type I FCoV infection in a feline cell line. other researchers reported that itraconazole and U18666A blocked cholesterol egress from late endosomes [13,14,15] 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) was a non-specific late endosome trafficking inhibitor. the 25-HC affected cholesterol accumulation in a dose-dependent manner. 25-HC had no inhibitory effects on the type II FCoV (FIPV) KU-2 strain (FCoV-I KU-2) infection. the effects of 25-hydroxycholesterol on feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection. the arrowheads point to the cells with accumulated intracellular cholesterol. cholesterol-accumulating triazoles (itraconazole and posaconazole) and non-cholesterol-accumulating triazoles (voriconazole and fluconazole) caused cholesterol accumulation and inhibited FCoV-I KU2 infection in fcwf-4 cells. similar effects on cholesterol accumulation and anti- viral activity have been observed with posaconazole. the effects of itraconazole and posaconazole on FCoV N protein expression in fcwf-4 cells. no cytopathic effects are observed, and no virus is produced in the culture supernatant. the arrowheads point to the cells with accumulated intracellular cholesterol. the arrows point to the cells with expressing FCoV N protein. the 25-HC exhibited antiviral activity in a dose-dependent manner on the type I FCoV (FIPV) KU-2 strain (FCoV-I KU-2) infection. 25-HC had no inhibitory effects on the type II FCoV (FIPV) WSU 79-1146 strain (FCoV-II 79-1146) infection, except for highly concentrated 25-HC. FCoV nucleocapsid (N) protein expression was evaluated by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. the arrows point to the cells with expressing FCoV N protein. voriconazole and fluconazole did not cause cholesterol accumulation. however, these triazoles did not inhibit FCoV-I 79-1146 infection. cholesterol accumulation has no influence on the efficiency of FCoV-II 79-1146 infection. the effect of late endosome function on FCoV in primary macrophages was confirmed. the concentration of triazole antifungals disrupting late endosome function in feline primary macrophages was confirmed. both voriconazole and posaconazole clearly induced cholesterol accumulation at 20 M. the value indicates the percentage of FCoV N-positive cells (mean SE) from four independent experiments. the arrows point to the cells with expressing FCoV N protein. the inhibition of cathepsin L activity does not influence the multiplication of FCoV-II 79-1146 [35] further investigation is necessary to clarify whether cleavage by cathepsin L or cholesterol transport influences cytosol entry by FCoV. 25-hydroxycholesterol accumulates cholesterol in late endosomes. type II FCoV infection was not inhibited by EGA, demonstrating that type II FCoV enters the cytosol before it reaches late endosomes. however, type I FCoV requires late endosomes to enter the cytosol. a commercial anti-Rab7 antibody reacts with feline Rab7. itraconazole, posaconazole, U18666A, and 25-hydroxycholesterol interfere with the binding of type I FCoV to NPC1. however, in cells treated with SDD-binding cholesterol, type I FCoV infection increased. inhibition of type I FCoV infection by the above drugs is not related to binding of the virus to the SDD of NPC1. type I FCoV cannot enter the cytosol unless it reaches late endosomes. type II FCoV can even though it does not reach late endosomes. our findings warrant further studies to elucidate the mechanism of cell entry by FCoV. 25-HC (cholesterol transport inhibitor), EGA (late endosome trafficking inhibitor), posaconazole, voriconazole, and fluconazole were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Japan (Tokyo, Japan) the 25-HC was dissolved in methanol. all compounds were adjusted to 10 mM with solvent, aliquoted, and stored at-30 \u00b0C until use. cell monolayers were cultured in carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)-MEM. cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h, fixed and stained with 1% crystal violet solution containing 10% buffered formalin. plaque reduction percentage was calculated using the following formula: Plaque reduction percentage (%) = [(plaque number of compound-treated cells)/(plaque number of compound-untreated cells)] 100. fcwf-4 cells were grown on an 8-well Lab-Tek Chamber Slide. semi-confluent fcwf-4 cell monolayers were cultured in medium containing compounds at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. filipin III-binding cells were analyzed using a leica DM4B microscope. the FCoV-I KU-2 was isolated in our laboratory. the fcwf-4 cells were seeded on 96-well plates. the compounds were added to the wells in triplicate. the cells were returned to the incubator for 1 h. fcwf-4 cell monolayers were cultured in 24-well multi-plates at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. cells were washed and the virus (MOI 0.01) was adsorbed into the cells at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. after washing, cells were cultured in carboxymethyl cellulose-MEM. fcwf-4 cells were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) fcwf-4 cells were grown on an 8-well Lab-Tek Chamber Slide."}
