{"summary": "the increased risk of adverse outcomes when these patients need general anaesthesia is well known. no recommendations exist for emergency departments or internal or surgical wards. high virulent viruses such as the rhinovirus4 may cause substantial morbidity in these patients. the patient's pulse rate was 101 bpm, blood pressure was 129/69 mm Hg. the oxygen saturation measured transcutaneously was 99% while breathing room air. the patient had diffuse epigastric pain on palpation. a transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with a near-normal left-ventricular ejection fraction of 50\u201355% (normal 55\u201365%) there were no signs of right-ventricular dysfunction and no pulmonary hypertension. the patient had a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. the patient had a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. the pneumonia severity index was low (52 points), however, corresponding to risk class II and a predicted mortality of 0.6%. the patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated in the intensive care unit. no antibodies to the HIV were found. rhinoviruses were repeatedly found in respiratory secretions of patients with community-acquired and healthcare-associated pneumonias in intensive care units6\u20138. human rhinovirus was detected in 24\u201358% of all virus positive specimens, and was among the most frequently isolated viruses. group C rhinoviruses were reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infections and haemorrhagic pericarditis. patients with pneumonia are about three times more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit than non-smokers. a pathogenetic role was ascribed to their use in the development of severe infections,20 including pneumonias. in vitro, the oxidative capacity of neutrophilic granulocytes was reduced by androgenic steroids."}
