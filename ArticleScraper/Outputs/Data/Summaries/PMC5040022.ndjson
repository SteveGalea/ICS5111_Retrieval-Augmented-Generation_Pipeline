{"summary": "study selection: studies were included and analyzed if they met all of the following criteria: \u201cprobable or confirmed infant microcephaly\u201d and \u201cprobable or confirmed ZIKV infection among mothers or infants\u201d we highlighted the diagnosis of ZIKV infection, including maternal clinical manifestations. microcephaly is a rare condition defined as a smaller head size, compared to other fetuses/babies of the same age/sex/ethnicity, often with prognosis of intellectual disabilities. it is transmitted through sex, blood, direct contact, or mother-to-fetus. a public health emergency of international concern was dispatched to investigate the suspected association between ZIKV and microcephaly. the potential association was reported in Brazil,[8,9,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36] the cases included both resident and nonresident patients. t al., 2016[39] Case study French Polynesia French Polynesia March 2014 to May 2015

ventriculomegaly, delayed myelination. clinical features Negative for toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, rubella, syphilis, and HIV. magnetic resonance imaging 3 Hazin et al., 2016[34] Case study Pernambuco, Brazil September and December, 2015 13 female infants, head CT images performed after birth (mean age: 36 days; range: 3 days to 5 months), CT outcomes: Severe brain anomalies, including calcifications, cortical hypogyration, ventriculomegaly. the areas where women are living were reported laboratory-confirmed zika infections while women were in their first trimester A ZIKV outbreak

and Gostin 2016[42] Case study Hawaii, United States Brazil January 15, 2016 sequence analysis in the brain tissues Negative for dengue virus, yellow fever virus, west Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, chikungunya virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, cytomegalovirus, rubella virus, varicella\u2013zoster virus, parvovirus B19, enteroviruses, and Toxoplasma gondii among fetuses. rash, arthralgia in first trimester Clinical features Negative for toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, syphilis, and HIV NR Negative for toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, syphilis, and HIV NR By CT scans and delivery measurement 3 Ventura et al., 2016[31] Case study Brazil studies were included if they met all criteria: \"probable or confirmed infant microcephaly\" and \"probable or confirmed ZIKV infection among mothers or infants\" the information from selected articles was extracted and entered into Microsoft Excel 2010TM (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, USA) by one reviewer. the clinical manifestations of ZIKV infections are similar to dengue or chikungunya fever. nonisolated patients without symptoms or with mild symptoms may be a potential source of infection. mosquitos with ZIKV are another infection source. clinical trials are absent due to no specific treatment of the ZIKV infection. there are so many \u201cZIKV-like\u201d symptoms which might occur in diverse diseases including Zika,[24] that even latently infected women are potentially relevant to fetal microcephaly. animal experimental models in mice showed that ZIKV had the capability to destroy the central nervous system and had severe pathological changes in mice. more appropriate animal models may be needed to solve the mystery between maternal ZIKV infection and microcephaly. the difference still existed 7 weeks after birth, but catch-up growth at 36 weeks narrowed the gap to borderline significance. the economic condition may contribute to a false diagnosis of microcephaly, and postdiagnosis follow-up is necessary. the interval between the time when the fetus was first diagnosed as microcephaly was on average 13 weeks, with a broad range of 3\u201327 weeks. the interval between the time when the fetus was first diagnosed as microcephaly and the occurrence of maternal clinical manifestations was on average 13 weeks. an ongoing cohort study in Colombia will attempt to confirm a potential association between ZIKV and microcephaly. the available etiological studies and case studies provide incomplete evidence for the confirmation of a potential association between ZIKV and microcephaly. 80% of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic. the disease often presents as mild and nonlethal among symptomatic infections. the characteristics of ZIKV make the infection process unnoticeable due to no obvious symptoms/signs. the clinical manifestations of ZIKV infections are similar to dengue or chikungunya fever. mosquitos with ZIKV are another infection source. there are so many \u201cZIKV-like\u201d symptoms which might occur in diverse diseases including Zika,[24] that even latently infected women are potentially relevant to fetal microcephaly. calcific and focal chorionic villi showed an abnormal placenta. animal experimental models in mice showed that ZIKV had the capability to destroy the central nervous system. more appropriate animal models may be needed to solve the mystery between maternal infection and microcephaly. malnutrition has a negative impact on fetal growth, including head circumference. the study of the Dutch famine in 1944\u20131945 showed that head circumference declined 2.7% during the famine. study had a control group with a rash during pregnancy, but the cause of the rash was not clearly diagnosed or analyzed. there was either no laboratory ZIKV confirmation or laboratory exclusion for other infections relevant to microcephaly. an ongoing cohort study in Colombia will attempt to confirm a potential association between ZIKV and microcephaly. however, ongoing cohort studies in Brazil and Columbia are expected to generate robust evidence for hypothesis verification. chikungunya was the natural host of the virus, rather than palm civets until 2013. this result was consistent with the fact that few coronavirus-like viruses were separated from palm civets. it is too early to come up with any explanation or conclusion of the infection. microcephaly diagnosis relies on ultrasonography during pregnancy, physical birth examination, and/or autopsy of still-birth or miscarriage products. other infections related to microcephaly should be detected. observational studies should follow the above to ensure accurate outcome."}
