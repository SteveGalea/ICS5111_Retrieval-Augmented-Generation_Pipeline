{"summary": "interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) inhibit a broad spectrum of viruses, including influenza viruses, west Nile virus, dengue virus, yellow fever virus, marburg virus, ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. an ifitm3 single nucleotide polymorphism leads to the expression of a truncated version of the IFITM3 protein with impaired antiviral activity. the impairment in viral infectivity is the impaired processing of HIV-1 Env into gp120 and gp41 by IFITM3 (25), which suggests that IFITM3 may undermine viral infectivity through impacting the viral Env protein. the identification of this type of IFITM-resistant viral envelope is expected to help decipher how IFITM proteins impair viral infectivity. we transfected HEK293T cells with plasmid DNAs that express IFITM1, IFITM2, or IFITM3 together with different HIV-1 DNA clones. different doses of IFITM plasmid DNAs were transfected to ensure the levels of IFITM inhibitory activity fall in the linear range. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with different amounts of IFITM1 or -3 DNA together with HIV-1 proviral DNA clones. cell lysates were harvested and examined with antibodies against HIV-1 gp120, viral p24, the FLAG tag, or tubulin. levels of virus RT activity or viral infectivity of each virus in the absence of IFITM proteins are arbitrarily set to a value of 1. Viruses were produced by transfecting HEK293T cells with HIV-1 proviral DNA (500 ng) and IFITM3 DNA (100 ng) levels of virion-associated IFITM3 were measured by Western blotting. two founder viruses, THRO and WITO, were resistant to inhibition by IFITM2 as well as by IFITM3. this conclusion is further supported by the results of HIV-1 infection of MT4 cells that express ectopic IFITM3. HEK293T cells with NL(AD8) DNA and IFITM1, IFITM2, or IFITM3 plasmid DNA showed that the NL(AD8) virus was as resistant to IFITM inhibition of viral infectivity as the AD8-1 virus. in order to determine which domain of AD8-1 Env was responsible for this resistance phenotype, we changed each of the V1, V2 and V3 loop sequences of NL4-3 Env to those of AD8-1 hek293T cells were transfected with proviral DNA of NL4-3, AD8-1, NL(AD8), or NL(AD8V3). hek293K cells were transfected with proviral DNA of NL4-3, AD8-1, NL(AD8), or NL(AD8V3) and then labeled with [35S]methionine. IFITM3-bearing NL4-3 virus contained less gp120 concurrently with the accumulated gp160 precursor than did the IFITM3-free NL4-3 virus. the NL(YU-2V3) and NL(THROV3) viruses had 14.9% and 23% of Env processed into gp120, respectively. Western blotting of virus samples also revealed lower levels of total Env proteins for NL4-3 and NL(YU-2V3) than for the rest of the viruses that are resistant to IFITM3. results showed that all viruses tested had similar PI values but that the IFITM3-sensitive NL4-3 virus had a lower AI value than did the IFITM3-resistant viruses. the effects of IFITM3 on virus entry were determined by calculating the ratio of the entry efficiency of each virus in the absence of IFITM3 to that of the same virus in the presence of IFITM3. we also investigated how the substituted V3 loop causes resistance to IFITM3. aviroc, NL(AD8), NL(YU-2V3), and NL(THROV3) were the most inhibited. sensitivity of these viruses to maraviroc inhibition did not correlate with their susceptibility to IFITM3 inhibition. ability of Env to use the CCR5 coreceptor for entry does not determine virus susceptibility to IFITM3 that is incorporated into virus particles. two antibodies, VRC03 and 17b, that recognize the CD4-binding site and CD4i epitopes (40\u201342) strongly inhibited the NL4-3 virus. the degrees of inhibition by 17b correlate well with the sensitivity of the tested viruses to IFITM3 inhibition. luciferase activity for each virus without treatment is arbitrarily set to a value of 1. data for the inhibition of different HIV-1 strains by the 17b antibody and by IFITM3 were used for the analysis. viruses with the same RT activity were incubated with different doses of sCD4 (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 g/ml) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. levels of luciferase activity for each virus without sCD4 treatment are arbitrary set to a value of 1. the levels of production of NL4-3, 89.6, and YU-2, but not AD8-1, viruses were moderately reduced by IFITM1 and IFITM2. the results showed that IFITM1 did not affect the infectivity of NL4-3, 89.6 and AD8-1 but enhanced the infectivity of YU-2 by 4-fold when 100 ng of IFITM1 plasmid DNA was transfected. levels of virus RT activity or viral infectivity of each virus in the absence of IFITM proteins are arbitrarily set to a value of 1. levels of virus RT activity or viral infectivity of each virus in the absence of IFITM proteins were arbitrarily set to a value of 1. viruses were produced by transfecting HEK293T cells with HIV-1 proviral DNA (500 ng) and IFITM DNA (100 ng) levels of viruses from transfections with the empty vector pQCXIP are arbitrarily set to a value of 1. MT4/R5 cells were transduced to express the ectopic IFITM3 protein. the number of infected cells was determined by scoring HIV-1 p24-positive cells. the inhibition of each HIV-1 strain by IFITM3 calculated from data from three independent experiments. V3-substituted NL(AD8V3) produced viruses that were almost as infectious as wild-type NL4-3 and showed resistance to IFITM3 inhibition. we further tested the V3 loops of HIV-1 strains YU-2, WITO, THRO, and RHPA by inserting these V3 loops into NL4-3. the WITO V3 loop generating as much resistance to IFITM3 as the AD8-1 V3 loop. HEK293T cells were transfected in absence or presence of IFITM3. levels of virus particle-associated Gag, IFITM3-FLAG, and Env (gp160 and gp120) were assessed by Western blotting. the NL4-3 virus contained less gp120 concurrently with the accumulated gp160 precursor than did the IFITM3-free NL4-3 virus. the NL(AD8), NL(AD8V3), and NL(WITOV3) viruses had nearly 50% of the Env protein processed into gp120 when IFITM3 was coexpressed. the entry of IFITM3-bearing NL4-3 was reduced by 5-fold. the entry of the NL(RHPAV3), NL(THROV3), and NL(YU-2V3) viruses was slightly affected by IFITM3. this correlates with their levels of resistance to IFITM3. effects of IFITM3 on virus entry were determined by calculating ratios of the entry efficiency of each virus in the absence of IFITM3 to that of the same virus in the presence of IFITM3. the results are presented as fold inhibition values and are the average of data from four independent assays. TZM-bl cells were preincubated with different doses of the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 or the CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc. at 40 h postinfection, the cells were harvested for luciferase activity measurements. levels of luciferase activity of each virus without any drug treatment are arbitrarily set to a value of 1. the degrees of inhibition by 17b correlate well with the sensitivity of the tested viruses to IFITM3 inhibition by the 17b antibody. at 40 h postinfection, the cells were harvested and luciferase activity was measured. NL4-3 was very sensitive to sCD4 inhibition, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 62 ng/ml. the NL(YU-2V3), NL(THROV3), and NL(RHPAV3) viruses exhibited differential sensitivities to sCD4 neutralization, with IC50 values of 72.4 ng/ml, 226.5 ng/ml, and 387.5 ng/ml. DISCUSSION Viruses have evolved various mechanisms to evade host restrictions. one mechanism is exemplified by the HIV-1 Vif protein that antagonizes the restriction factor APOBEC3G by recruiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that modifies APOBEC3G for proteasomal degradation. the same domain structure and the relatively similar sequences of different HIV-1 Env proteins allow the conduction of mutagenesis studies to identify the V3 loop as one determinant in HIV-1 Env that regulates viral resistance to IFITM3. the V3 loop regulates viral resistance to IFITM3. a recent study reported a high sensitivity of CCR5-tropic HIV-1 strains, compared to CXCR4-tropic strains, to inhibition by IFITM3 that is expressed in target cells. coreceptor usage differentially affects HIV-1 sensitivity to inhibition by IFITM3 that is expressed in target cells or is incorporated into virus particles. however, we observed that the IFITM3-sensitive virus NL4-3 is much more sensitive to inhibition by the 17b antibody and soluble a study by foster and colleagues reported the resistance of transmitted founder HIV-1 strains to IFITM3 (33), suggesting a protective role of IFITM3 in HIV-1 transmission. we observed that IFITM1 increases the infectivity of certain HIV-1 strains, including YU-2, CH058, CH106, RHPA, THRO, and WITO. TZM-bl cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 1 l/ml of puromycin. MT4/R5 cells (64) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml strept pTHRO.c/2626 (catalog number11745), pREJO.c/2864 (catalog number 11746), pZM246F_10 (catalog number 11828) and pZM247Fv2 (catalog number 11829) were obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program. pQCXIP (catalog number 631516) was purchased from Clontech. a total of 5.0 104 TZM-bl cells were seeded into each well of a 24-well plate 20 h prior to infection. TZM-bl cells were washed once with cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 100 l of 1 passive lysis buffer. Virus particles were pelleted at 35,000 rpm for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. resuspended in 100 l of DMEM. five microliters of each virus was used for RT activity quantification. a total of 5 g/ml of Polybrene (catalog number 107689; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the medium. a 45-min spinoculation at 1,800 rpm followed by 2 h of incubation in a humidified environment at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. the cells were loaded with CCF2-AM (catalog number K1032; Invitrogen) and incubated in the dark at room temperature for the viruses were coincubated with each of the antibodies or sCD4 at various concentrations for 1 h in a cell culture incubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. the cells were harvested at 40 h postinfection, and the luciferase activity was measured. membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk dissolved in 1 PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (catalog number TWN510; BioShop) for 1 h, followed by incubation with a 1:10,000 dilution of secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. secondary antibodies included enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked whole antibody from donkey. TZM-bl cells were incubated with 0, 5.14 105, 2.67 104, 1.28 103, 5.14 103, and 0.01 g/ml of the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 or the CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc for 1 h in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. infected cells were harvested at 40 h postinfection and the luciferase activity was measured. the association index measures the relative ability of the gp120 domain to stay on the Env trimer on virus-producing cells. the association index values thus describe the intrinsic stability of Env (i.e., the ability of gp120 to remain associated with gp41) MT4/R5 cells (64) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 1 l/ml of puromycin. DMEM (catalog number 11965-092), RPMI 1640 (catalog number 11875-093), FBS (catalog number 11875-093), and penicillin-streptomycin (catalog number 15140 pAD8-1 and pNL(AD8) were obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program. pQCXIP (catalog number 631516) was purchased from Clontech. TZM-bl cells were washed once with cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 100 l of 1 passive lysis buffer. luciferase activity was measured by using a Glomax 20/20 luminometer. transfection was performed with HEK293T cells seeded into a 10-cm cell culture plate. a total of 1 106 C8166-R5 cells were plated with 400 l of 10% FBS\u2013RPMI 1640 medium into each well of a 24-well plate. the viruses were resuspended in 100 l of DMEM. a 45-min spinoculation at 1,800 rpm (CS-6R; Beckman Coulter) was carried out, followed by 2 h of incubation in a humidified environment at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. the cells were loaded with CCF2-AM (catalog number K1032; Invitrogen) and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 1 h. the viruses were coincubated with each of the antibodies or sCD4 at various concentrations for 1 h in a cell culture incubator at 37\u00b0C. after incubation, the viruses were used to infect TZM-bl cells that were preseeded in a 24-well plate 20 h prior to infection. membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk dissolved in 1 PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (catalog number TWN510; BioShop) (PBST) for 1 h, followed by incubation with a 1:10,000 dilution of secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. primary antibodies included monoclonal mouse antitubulin antibody (B-5-1-2) TZM-bl cells were incubated with 0, 5.14 105, 2.67 104, 1.28 103, 5.14 103, and 0.01 g/ml of the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 or the CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc for 1 h in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. the cells were then infected by the same amount of viruses. a low association index is a good indicator of decreased levels of gp120 in virus particles. the processing index of NL4-3 was arbitrarily set to a value of 1, and the values for other viruses were calculated relative to the value for NL4-3 processing index."}
