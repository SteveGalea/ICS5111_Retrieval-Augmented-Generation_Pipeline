{"summary": "a sulfur-SAD experiment was performed long before the advent of density modification. it took another 20 years for the crystallographic community to embrace the power of sulfur anomalous scattering for the de novo structure determination of proteins. derivatives of anomalous scatterers such as Zn, As, Mn, halide ions, halogenated fragments etc. have been exploited for experimental phasing. there have also been reports of utilization of anomalous signal at short wavelengths (1 ) from serendipitously acquired scatterers for experimental phasing. the current state of the art in native SAD has been discussed by Rose et al. (2015 ). at the wavelengths typically accessible at synchrotron beamlines and home sources, the anomalous signal from sulfur is weak. the sequence identity of the protein to that of known structures is below the 'twilight zone' for molecular replacement. most beamlines are optimized to collect data at a wavelength of around 1.0. the expected anomalous signal from anomalous scatterers such as calcium and manganase is low. HEWL is the first case where just the sulfur anomalous signal at 1.0 wavelength has been shown to be sufficient for de novo structure determination. for PSPTO the data were collected near the selenium edge and for PTO they were collected near the iron edge. however, the anomalous signals from these atoms could nevertheless be used to obtain the structures. HEWL was purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich and used without further purification. all three proteins were dissolved in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10%(v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mM TCEP. all data were collected from crystals maintained at 100 K in a stream of cold nitrogen gas. density-modified phases were input to ARP/wARP for model building. three cycles of iterative chain tracing with 20 cycles of density modification were used. the coordinates from PDB entry 1lz8 were used as a reference structure. results Table 1 presents the diffraction data for each of the three proteins. Table 2 presents the absorption edges, with the corresponding X-ray energies, of the anomalous scatterers encountered in this study. the value in parentheses is the number of anomalous scattering atoms in the asymmetric unit. in lysozyme there are eight cysteines and two methionines. in lysozyme there are eight cysteines and two methionines. f\u2032\u2032 values were obtained from http://skuld.bmsc.washington.edu/scatter/AS_periodic.html. a BLAST search against the PDB did not reveal suitable models. a substructure search in space group P41212 in SHELXD produced two strong peaks followed by four additional peaks. the map obtained with the original coordinates showed better CC, contrast, connectivity and FOM compared with that obtained from inverted coordinates. the model containing residues 4\u2013135 of the 145-amino-acid protein. PTO PTO is a 13 kDa hypothetical protein PTO0218 from P. torridus. a BLAST search did not identify a useful molecular-replacement model. model building with the phases obtained after SHELXC/D/E resulted in a model with 678 of the 726 residues. the asymmetric unit in the crystal of PTO consists of four molecules arranged in a rugby-ball-like shape. the other two adopting a half rugby-ball-like shape positioned parallel to the long side of the ball. PSPTO represents a data set where the anomalous signal from surface-bound Ca atoms at 0.979 wavelength was utilized for phasing. despite not being a routine data set, we included the data set in this study along with that of PSPTO to compare the quality of the phases obtained in the two data sets. attenuated beam, both with a crystal rotation of 1\u00b0. this would lead to a more accurate measurement of low-intensity reflections. the two data sets were merged and used for phasing. HEWLAll refers to the data set obtained from merging all of the high- and low-intensity data. data sets 3 and 4 have similar multiplicity and resolution, but the total wedge covered in data set 1 is 200\u00b0, while it is 100\u00b0 in data set 3.

X was able to build residues 4\u2013111 and 124\u2013136. but when the anomalous scatterers were input as four sulfurs it was able to build only 53 residues. a BLAST search did not identify a useful molecular-replacement model. model building with the phases obtained after SHELXC/D/E resulted in a model with 678 of the 726 residues. asymmetric unit in the crystal of PTO consists of four molecules arranged in a rugby-ball-like shape. the other two adopting a half rugby-ball-like shape positioned parallel to the long side of the ball. PSPTO represents a data set where the anomalous signal from surface-bound Ca atoms at 0.979 wavelength was utilized for phasing. however, anomalous signal from surface-bound Ca atoms at 1.743 wavelength is used. despite not being a routine data set, we included the PTO data set in this study along with that of PSPTO. 200 frames were collected with the detector at 200 mm (corresponding to 1.46) with a sevenfold attenuation followed by another 157 frames with an unattenuated beam, both with a crystal rotation of 1\u00b0. this would lead to a more accurate measurement of low-intensity reflections owing to the higher beam flux. the resulting map was input to ARP/wARP for model building. a single chain of 126 residues was docked into the map. table 3 provides a comparison of the various parameters for these data sets.

AD has been shown to work with crystals diffracting to worse than 3.0 resolution. in most cases it is essential to have highly redundant data (with a multiplicity of 20\u2013100) collected using long-wavelength (1.5\u20132.5 ) X-rays to maximize the accuracy and strength of the anomalous signal.
