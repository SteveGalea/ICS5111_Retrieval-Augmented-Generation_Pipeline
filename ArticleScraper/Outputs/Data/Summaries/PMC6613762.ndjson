{"summary": "cGAS detects cytoplasmic dsDNA and catalyzes the synthesis of GMP-AMP cyclic dinucleotide (cGAMP) (1, 2). cGAMP acts as a second messenger and binds to the stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING), which traffics from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where TANK-binding kina the function of many viral gene products remains unknown. in africa, wild suidae, such as warthogs and bush pigs, are also infected with ASFV. acute ASF in domestic pigs is characterized by hemorrhages in lymph nodes and internal organs. porcine alveolar macrophages infected either with NH/P68 (attenuated) or with Armenia/07 (virulent) ASFV strains showed a higher production of IFN- mRNA compared to those infected with Armenia/07. a time course experiment in macrophages at 0, 4, 8, and 16 h postinfection (hpi) was performed. ulent ASFV shuts down the IFN- synthesis pathway several hours after infection. this effect also translates to IFN- cytokine production, which is abolished at 16 hpi. qPCR analyses of IFN- (A), IFIT-1 (C), and CXCL10 (D) and of ASFV viral protein p32 (E) mRNAs were performed. Fig. 1C and D show that Armenia/07 does not activate either IFIT-1 or CXCL10 mRNA synthesis during the course of the infection. in contrast, IFIT-1 and CXCL10 mRNA levels were equivalent during the infection with both attenuated and virulent strains. results reveal two important aspects regarding IFN- production by attenuated versus virulent ASFV strains. phosphorylation occurs as early as 1 hpi, reaches a peak at 2 to 4 hpi and decreases by 16 hpi during NH/P68 infection. IRF3 phosphorylation, which controls IFN- transcription (2), starts at 4 hpi and increases until 16 hpi. cGAS is a cellular sensor for cytoplasmic dsDNA detection. cGAS inhibits the activation of STING mediated by NH/P68 and Armenia/07 infection. similar results were observed in regard to IFN- synthesis. NH/P68 phosphorylates IRF3 and induces its binding to chromatin. infection with NH/P68 is able to substantially activate the cGAS-STING pathway. cGAS-STING pathway is dependent on the cGAS sensor. cytoplasmic (S2) and nuclear (P1) fractions were obtained from whole-cell extracts. the P1 fraction was further separated into nuclear soluble fraction (S3) and chromatin fraction (P3). cGAS-STING promotes the translocation to the nucleus of p-IRF3. p-IRF3 was also detected in the chromatin fraction (P3) of NH/P68-infected cells. weak or no bands corresponding to p-IRF3 were detected either in the chromatin fraction (P3) or in the nuclear soluble fraction (S3) in uninfected cells or in cells infected with Armenia/07. cGAS-STING pathway is strongly activated during NH/P68 infection. cGAS-STING pathway inhibition by Armenia/07 occurs at a time point prior to the replication of viral DNA. no phosphorylation of STING and IRF3 was observed in the presence of AraC. phosphorylation of both STING and IRF3 is observed in the absence of AraC. cGAS is activated to synthesize cGAMP from ATP/GTP. cGAMP binds STING, inducing its phosphorylation, dimerization, and activation (2). at 5 hpi, a time point by which Armenia/07 fully inhibits STING phosphorylation was added to the cultures. at 14 hpi, cells were untreated or treated with 10 g/ml of cGAMP. treatment of noninfected cells with cGAMP induces phosphorylation of STING and TBK1. cGAMP was added after 14 h of infection with attenuated or the virulent ASFV strains. the inhibition of STING phosphorylation induced by Armenia/07 was reversed by exogenous cGAMP. cells were treated with 40 g/ml of AraC, suggesting that both the blockage by Armenia/07 and the rescue by cGAMP are mechanisms independent of viral replication. cGAMP-treated macrophages were mock infected or infected with Armenia/07 or NH/P68. cells infected with Armenia/07 present a more diffuse STING distribution pattern. the latter results indicate a nonactivation status of STING. both Armenia/07 and NH/P68 infections were confirmed by the presence of viral factories. NH/P68 induces a blockage in the activation and intracellular transport of STING. NH/P68 infection does not, resulting in a typical punctuate pattern surrounding the nucleus characteristic of STING activation. a similar colocalizes with AP1 in both NH/P68- and Armenia/07-infected cells. between STING and AP1 was found in cGAMP-treated macrophages. this indicates that both attenuated and virulent ASFV strains \u201cactivate\u201d STING trafficking very early after infection. AP1 is located mainly around the ASFV viral factories (arrowhead) in both Armenia/07- and NH/P68-infected cells. STING-AP1 colocalization significantly decreased at 6 hpi and more specifically in Armenia/07- versus NH/P68-infected cells. the cells were fixed and stained with DAPI (blue), anti-STING (green) and anti-AP1 (red) antibodies. both virulent and attenuated ASFV strains trigger the cGAS-STING pathway at very early times postinfection. virulent ASFV strains can either cause chronic, subclinical, or fatal, acute ASF disease. the results show a strong decrease of secreted IFN- at 16 hpi. in NH/P68-infected macrophages the amount of IFN- increases over time. this indicates that virulent ASFV shuts down the IFN- synthesis pathway several hours after infection. this effect also translates to IFN- cytokine production. data were statistically analyzed by using a Student t test. we analyzed the expression of IFIT-1 and CXCL10, two IFN-dependent genes (25, 26) at 0, 4, 8, and 16 hpi. Fig. 1C and D show that Armenia/07 does not activate either IFIT-1 or CXCL10 mRNA synthesis during the course of the infection. infection with NH/P68, but not with Armenia/07, induces phosphorylation of STING and IRF3 at 16 hpi. phosphorylation occurs as early as 1 hpi, reaches a peak at 2 to 4 hpi and decreases by 16 hpi during NH/P68 infection. anti-p-STING, anti-STING, anti-p-IRF3, anti-IRF3, anti-ASFV p32. infection of macrophages with Armenia/07 produces only a weak phosphorylation signal of STING after 2 and 4 hpi. similar activation profile was seen for IRF3 (Fig. 2C) the level of STING phosphorylation was not detected in mock-infected cells. NH/P68 phosphorylates IRF3 and induces its binding to chromatin. the activation of cGAS pathway is dependent on the cGAS sensor. we used a specific antibody to detect p-IRF3 in different subcellular locations of the cell. to achieve this, mock-infected, NH/P68-infected, or Armenia/07-infected macrophages were fractionated after 8 hpi. both STING and IRF3 were found to be phosphorylated by NH/P68. p-IRF3 was also detected in the chromatin fraction (P3) of NH/P68-infected cells. only weak or no bands corresponding to p-IRF3 were detected either in the chromatin fraction (P3) or in the nuclear soluble fraction (S3) in uninfected cells. this resulted in weak or no induction of IFN- synthesis. mRNAs are the products of viral genes whose transcription is regulated before or after viral DNA replication (8). in order to determine whether the cGAS-STING inhibition produced by Armenia/07 occurs at early or late times of ASFV replication. in order to determine whether the cGAS-STING pathway inhibition by Armenia/07 occurs at a time point prior to the replication of viral DNA. p12 is only found in infected cells in the absence of AraC. NH/P68 infection induces activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. cGAS is activated to synthesize cGAMP from ATP/GTP. cGAMP binds STING, inducing its phosphorylation, dimerization, and activation. at 5 hpi, the cells were untreated or treated with 10 g/ml of cGAMP. at 2 h after cGAMP treatment, the cells were collected. numbers below the bands indicate the relative levels of p32 viral protein. cGAMP (10 g/ml) was added after 14 h of infection with the attenuated or the virulent ASFV strains. exogenous cGAMP caused the phosphorylation of STING in noninfected cells. the inhibition of STING phosphorylation induced by Armenia/07 was reversed. cGAMP-treated cells and cells infected with NH/P68 show STING localization in punctuate perinuclear structures. cGAMP-treated cells and cells infected with NH/P68 show STING localization in microsomes. cells infected with Armenia/07 present a more diffuse STING distribution pattern throughout the cytoplasm. at 6 hpi or 1 h after cGAMP treatment, the cells were fixed and stained with DAPI and anti-STING antibody. arrows indicate punctuated perinuclear structures. an arrowhead indicates viral factories. cGAMP-treated macrophages were used as a positive control of STING activation. a similar colocalization pattern was found in cGAMP-treated macrophages. this indicates that both attenuated and virulent ASFV strains \u201cactivate\u201d STING trafficking very early after infection. arrows indicate colocalization between STING accumulations and AP1. highest colocalization between STING and AP1 was found in both NH/P68- and Armenia/07-infected cells after 1 h of infection. data were statistically analyzed by using a Student t test. results suggest that both virulent and attenuated ASFV strains trigger the cGAS-STING pathway at very early times postinfection. one strain is NH/P68, a nonfatal, naturally occurring, nonhaemadsorbing virus. the other strain is Armenia/07, a highly virulent virus currently circulating in Europe, Russia, and China (37). inhibition of cGAS by the specific inhibitor Ru521 impairs NH/P68-induced STING phosphorylation. this suggests that cGAS is the main DNA sensor activating the STING cascade by the attenuated ASFV NH/P68 isolate. virulent strain may encode genes functionally homologous to type I IFN receptors. the produced IFN is \u201cneutralized\u201d at this time point of the virulent infection (8 hpi) the cGAS-STING pathway, which leads to the production of IFN-, is critical for the innate immune response. phosphorylation of both TBK1 and IRF3 is impaired by Armenia/07 in the presence of AraC. p-IRF3 is triggered as early as 1 h after NH/P68 infection. a faster transition between activated STING and phosphorylated IRF3 occurs. cGAS-STING is a prototype downstream effector, which can be modulated by several viral products in order to counteract the cGAS-STING pathway and type I IFN production. cGAS was identified as the main sensor of this pathway in both humans and mice (27\u201329), playing an important role in type I IFN response against DNA viruses, including HSV-1, KSHV, and vaccinia virus. the activation of STING involves trafficking from the ER through the Golgi compartment to perinuclear punctuated structures, called microsomes (33, 34, 63). transit of STING through the Golgi, prior to its translocation into microsomes, has been shown to be a key event for STING activation. studies in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells have postulated that the transfected DP96R gene of the Chinese virulent strain 2018/1 could have a role in the control of the cGAS-STING pathway (24). however, these results should be discussed cautiously, since (i) HEK cells are not susceptible to ASFV infection and (ii) these studies have not been performed in context of an active ASFV infection.
