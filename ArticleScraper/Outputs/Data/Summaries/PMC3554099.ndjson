{"summary": "the viral glycoprotein (GP) is present on the surface of virions. it is composed of a heterotrimeric complex consisting of GP1. it interacts with attachment factors and receptors and GP2 that mediates fusion between the host and viral membrane. ing molecules, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Rac1, protein kinase C (PKC), CDC42, PAK1, and Axl, are implicated in macropinocytic uptake of EBOV in various cells (20, 21, 22, 25\u201327) AMP-activated protein kinase regulates metabolism by responding to levels of AMP present in the cell. macrophages from diabetic mice have reduced macropinocytosis. leptin-enhanced AMPK activity increased macropinocytosis. AMPK activity for vaccinia virus uptake via macropinocytosis remains poorly defined. PBMCs were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% HEPES, and 1% l-glutamate. cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 unless otherwise noted. recombinant, replication-competent EBOV GP was cloned into the genome of a recombinant VSV (Indiana) the recombinant genome contained the EGFP gene in place of VSV-G. supernatant was resuspended with phosphate-buffered saline. pellet was resuspended in PBS, aliquoted, and frozen at 80\u00b0C. newly pseudotyped virions were collected for 48 to 72 h. the average percentage of EGFP-expressing cells from three independent assays was used as a seed file for COMPARE analysis performed at http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/compare/. cellular genes that correlated only with EBOV GP-dependent transduction were eliminated from our analysis. cells were incubated for 24 h, lifted with trypsin, and fixed in 2% formaldehyde. infection was analyzed by EGFP expression by either immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy or flow cytometry. vero cells (4.5 104) were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. they were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h in the presence or absence of 10 M compound C before incubation with VSVG-EBOV. the supernatant was aspirated and replaced with prewarmed DMEM with and without compound C. dextran was conjugated to fluorescein (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. extracellular dextran was then removed with a 1 PBS wash. actin polymerization stimulates EBOV GP pseudovirions in an AMPK-dependent manner. FITC-conjugated 70-kDa dextran was incubated with equivalent numbers of WT or AMPK/ MEFs for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were washed thoroughly and assessed for dextran uptake by flow cytometry. EBOV GP pseudovirions were incubated for 1 h before cells were chilled to 4\u00b0C. surface-bound virus was either removed by trypsin treatment prior to shifting the temperature to 37\u00b0C. after 1 h, cells were refreshed with medium not containing inhibitor. in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% HEPES, and 1% l-glutamate. all cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 unless otherwise noted. freshly isolated MDMs were plated in a 48-well format. recombinant, replication-competent VSV expresses mucin domain-deleted Zaire EBOV GP (EBOV GP/rVSV) was cloned into the genome of a recombinant VSV (Indiana) infectious virus was generated as described previously (43) and titers were determined. supernatant was resuspended with phosphate-buffered saline. pellet was resuspended in PBS, aliquoted, and frozen at 80\u00b0C. newly pseudotyped virions were collected for 48 to 72 h. the average percentage of EGFP-expressing cells from three independent assays was used as a seed file for COMPARE analysis performed at http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/compare/. cellular genes that correlated only with EBOV GP-dependent transduction were eliminated from our analysis. cells were incubated for 24 h, lifted with trypsin, and fixed in 2% formaldehyde. infection was analyzed by EGFP expression by either immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy or flow cytometry. vero cells (4.5 104) were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. they were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h in the presence or absence of 10 M compound C before incubation with VSVG-EBOV (MOI of 200) the supernatant was aspirated and replaced with prewarmed DMEM with and without compound C. actin polymerization stimulated by EBOV GP pseudovirions in an AMPK-dependent manner, stimulating macropinocytosis. vero cells were preincubated with and without drug at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. cells were then incubated with EBOV pseudovirions in the presence or absence of drug for 30 m at 4\u00b0C. FITC-conjugated 70-kDa dextran was incubated with equivalent numbers of WT or AMPK/ MEFs for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were washed thoroughly and assessed for dextran uptake by flow cytometry. EBOV GP pseudovirions were incubated for 1 h before cells were chilled to 4\u00b0C. surface-bound virus was either removed by trypsin treatment prior to shifting the temperature to 37\u00b0C (control, 0 min) or allowed to transduce for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the resulting percentage of cells that were EGFP positive was correlated with the gene expression data of each line. genes within the EBOV GP listing that correlated with both EBOV GP- and VSV-G-dependent transduction were subtracted, yielding a subset of genes that were likely to be specifically involved with EBOV GP-dependent entry rather than downstream VSV expression events. mRNA levels were obtained from gene array studies that are available to the public at the NIH NCI DTP website. VSVG-EBOV transduction efficiency of the same NCI-60 cell lines. compound C (also known as dorsomorphin) inhibits EBOV infection. compound C inhibits EBOV transduction of cell lines. the indicated lines were treated with compound C (10 M) or the DMSO control for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. a range of MOIs from 0.1 to 1 was used for these studies. unbound virus was removed, and the cells were shifted to 37\u00b0C. compound C or DMSO control was added at the indicated time following the temperature shift. at 6 h following initiation of transduction, virus and inhibitor were removed. compound C incubated with cells for a total of 6 h before being replaced with fresh medium. compound C became ineffective when added after 4 h following initiation of transduction. compound C was evaluated for inhibition of replication-competent EBOV that expresses EGFP during infection. in vitro matured human monocyte-derived macrophages were infected with EBOV GP/rVSV (MOI of 1) for an additional 4 h. AMPK inhibition significantly reduces EBOV GP-mediated infection of primary human MDMs. cells lacking functional AMPK are less susceptible to EBOV GP-mediated infection. AMPK in these cells cannot become activated and is unable to phosphorylate downstream targets (39, 57, 64, 66) AMPK/ MEFs support lower levels of EBOV infection than WT MEFs. AMPK activity enhances actin polymerization by EBOV GP. incubation of host cells with VV causes large actin protrusions. the addition of EBOV caused significant actin polymerization during entry in cells at 30 min. the addition of EBOV caused significant actin polymerization during entry in cells at 30 min. a cathepsin B inhibitor allows virion internalization but blocks proteolysis. a similar finding was observed in the presence of EBOV GP pseudovirions. a similar finding was observed in the presence of compound C. we performed a large-scale bioinformatics screen to identify cellular genes important in EBOV GP-dependent transduction. we performed a comparative genomic analysis (CGA) screen to identify cellular genes important in EBOV transduction. several signaling molecules previously reported to be important for EBOV transduction/infection were also identified in this screen. intriguingly, the 2 subunit of AMPK correlated strongly with EBOV transduction (PCC of 0.489) a neuroblastoma cell line, the renal cell line 786-O, and the cervical cancer line HeLa were incubated with compound C or vehicle control for an additional 4 h. the drug and virus were removed, medium was refreshed, and viral transduction was analyzed by evaluating transduced cell EGFP expression via flow cytometry at 24 h. EGFP expression in transduced cells divided by EGFP expression in cells treated with compound C. results show effect of compound C on EBOV GP pseudovirion transduction, LFV GPC pseudovirion transduction, and cellular cytotoxicity (viability) in vero cells. compound C inhibited EBOV pseudovirion transduction with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 6 M, regardless of whether the drug was maintained or removed from the culture after 4 h. a time-of-addition study was performed to understand the time frame of compound C-dependent inhibition of EBOV transduction. inhibition was more than 45-fold stronger than that observed in our transduction studies, with an IC50 of 0.13 M. this enhanced sensitivity to compound C of our infectious virus is likely due to the fact that VSV replication is reduced in the presence of AMPK. this work provides strong evidence that AMPK activity is important for EBOV infection. an average of 452 cells were GFP positive in the control populations. no EGFP-expressing cells were detected in the compound C-treated wells. AMPK inhibition significantly reduces EBOV GP-mediated infection of primary human MDMs. AMPK/ MEFs were infected with wild-type VSV, vaccinia virus (VV) or EBOV GP/rVSV. AMPK/ MEFs showed significantly lower permissivity to VV than WT MEFs. AMPK/ MEFs support lower levels of EBOV infection than WT MEFs. merization in the presence of EBOV pseudovirions caused significant actin polymerization during entry in cells at 30 min. the addition of EBOV caused significant actin polymerization during entry in cells at 30 min. a reduction in actin polymerization was caused by compound C. compound C inhibits fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated 70-kDa dextran uptake. neither of these experiments was profoundly inhibited by the absence of AMPK activity as EBOV infection. extracellular virus was removed from the cell surface by two 5-min incubations with trypsin. the treated cells were replated in fresh medium without inhibitors for 24 h. a similar finding was observed in the presence of compound C. morphologically disparate viruses have been reported to enter cells via this mechanism. loss of activity of a key metabolic regulator, AMPK, decreases actin polymerization and reduces both EBOV and dextran uptake. AMPK activity has been shown to be important for macropinocytosis. AMPK is reported to enter cells by stimulating actin polymerization, membrane blebbing, lamellipodium formation, and macropinocytosis (67, 76, 77), and Moser et al. extended these studies by demonstrating the importance of AMPK in VV entry. AMPK activation enhances entry and subsequent levels of infection of some enveloped viruses. AMPK activation is known to phosphorylate the anticapping protein vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) 37, 40, 83. unphosphorylated VASP prevents actin capping and enhances actin filament elongation by binding to the barbed end of actin. actin-capping proteins are critical in the formation of lamellipodia."}
