{"summary": "Cyps possess peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity and have high affinity for the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A. this complex binds to and inhibits the function of the phosphatase calcineurin. this complex binds to and inhibits the function of the phosphatase calcineurin. a recent study showed that CypA stabilized the HIV-1 capsid and antagonized HIV-1 uncoating in vitro. a recent study showed that CypA stabilized the HIV-1 capsid and antagonized HIV-1 uncoating in vitro. however, several lines of evidences revealed that Cyps play crucial roles in HCV life cycle. virions must uncoat and release viral genome into host cytoplasm. mature particles with sediment coefficient of 160S are converted to the uncoating intermediate A particles with sediment coefficient of 135S. the 135S particles retain the full complement of genomic RNA but lack some of their content of VP4. rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells infected with EV71 virus strain AnHui1 were screened. this screen identified compound HL051001P2 as a potent inhibitor of viral proliferation. no significant cytotoxicity was observed from compound HL051001P2 at concentrations below 20 M. cells were then infected with EV71 virus at an MOI of 1. qRT-PCR measured the percentage of EV71 RNA from the untreated control cells. each data point represents the average of three replicates. we first introduced short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) into RD cells to downregulate endogenous CypA and CypB expression. the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was not downregulated. RD cells with negative control shRNA (RD-sh-control) were infected with EV71-GFP virus. at 72 hpi, CypA (top), CypB (middle), and GAPDH, (an internal control) were detected in total cell lysates by immunoblotting analysis. Flow cytometric studies of the RD-sh-control, RD-sh-CypA, and RD-sh-CypB cells infected with wt-EV71 at an MOI of 1 after 24 h. wt-EV71 infected RD-sh-control and RD-sh-CypA cells with EV71. expression levels of CypA, CypB, EV71-VP1 and GADPH were examined by immunoblotting analysis. EV71 RNA level in RD-sh-control cells was reduced to 20%. EV71 infection led a very minor alteration of secreted CypA in the supernatant of RD-sh-control cells. this finding indicated that CypA was present in host cells, but not those that were secreted in the supernatant. this finding indicated that CypA is upregulated following EV71 infection. the EV71 virus was resistant to a CypA inhibitor through multiple cell culture passages in the presence of compound HL051001P2. this mutation translated into a single amino acid substitution of a serine to a proline at residue VP1-243. a single amino acid substitution of a proline at residue VP1-243 was found in the H-I loop of VP1. the VP1-S243P mutant is specifically associated with resistance to the CypA inhibitor. ximately 25% of EV71 VP1 protein recovered to normal levels following infection with the S243P-EV71 virus. wt-EV71 virus cannot bind with CypA, i.e., S243A/P246A-EV71. this interaction was reduced in a dose-dependent manner after treating with CsA. recombinant CypA protein rescued the interaction between CypA and EV71. similar amounts of wt- and S243P-EV71 viruses and GST-tagged CypA were loaded into the GST-pulldown assay. the bands were quantified and each column represents the average of three replicates. a reported catalytic-defective mutant of CypA eliminated the interaction between CypA and EV71 virions. the mutation of the serine at the VP1-243 position to proline can clearly increase the binding affinity of the H-I loop for CypA. HL051001P2 treatments at 6 to 0 hpi showed inhibition of EV71 replication. anti-EV71 effect of the treatments after 2 hpi was significantly attenuated. results indicated that CypA affected the early step, but not genome replication, during EV71 infection. the growth curves of wt-EV71 (C) and S243P-EV71 (D) in RD-sh-control or RD-sh-CypA cells at an MOI of 50. the EV71 infection was quantified by using qRT-PCR. the mRNA level of GAPDH was used as an internal control. amount of EV71 RNA in RD-sh-CypA cells decreased to less than 50% of that in the RD-sh-control cells at 1 hpi. VP1 expression can be clearly and consistently attenuated in EV71-infected RD-sh-CypA cells in comparison with EV71-infected RD-sh-control cells. the RD-sh-control and RD-sh-CypA cells were infected with wt-EV71. endogenous CypA and EV71 VP1 proteins were analyzed by immunofluorescence. the downregulation of CypA in the RD-sh-CypA cells was first confirmed. the entry of EV71 can be divided into two processes: receptor binding and 2) uncoating to release the viral genome [35]. to demonstrate the exact function of CypA in EV71 entry, we first checked the effect of CypA downregulation in the binding of EV71 virions to host cells. the amount of bound virus was measured by using a quantitative real-time qRT-PCR assay. each data point for (C) and (E) represents the average of three replicates. EV71 virions treated at 61\u00b0C exhibited a smaller shift from the native peak (160S) after ultracentrifugation in a 1.1\u20131.5 g/ml discontinuous CsCl gradient. we then incubated 160S virions with 20 g of recombinant CypA. the results revealed that CypA cannot trigger the conversion of 160S particles at pH 5.5 and pH 6.5. mutation in EV71 VP1 decreased viral fitness but conferred CypA inhibitor resistance. we transfected RD cells with RNA transcripts of EV71 recombinants. recombinant viruses were designated as S243P-EV71, S243A-EV71, P246A-EV71, S243P/P246A-EV71 and S243A/P246A-EV71. growth curves of wt-EV71 and S243P-EV71 in RD cells at an MOI of 0.1 without (C) or with (D) inhibitor HL051001P2 treatment. the EV71 infection was quantified by using qRT-PCR. the mRNA level of GAPDH was used as an internal control. no significant cytotoxicity was observed from compound HL051001P2. compound HL051001P2 was previously reported to function as a CypA inhibitor [28]. the results revealed that CsA clearly impaired EV71 proliferation with an EC50 value of 3.5 M. however, CsA had a slightly higher cytotoxicity than HL051001P2. ten subfamilies have been identified in the Cyp family to date. 10.98% of RD cells with negative control shRNA (RD-sh-control) were infected with the EV71-GFP virus. the infection ratio was decreased to 3.31% in the RD-sh-CypA cells. however, the infection rate remained at 7.41% in the RD-sh-CypB cells. -sh-CypA, and RD-sh-CypB cells infected with wt-EV71. the data were expressed as the percentage of EV71 RNA from the untreated control cells. each data point represents the average of three replicates. the EV71 RNA level in the CypA knockdown cells was diminished to 20% of the levels observed in the RD-sh-control cells. the results revealed a similar finding as the one caused by EV71 infection at an MOI of 1. the expression level of EV71 VP1 protein was significantly reduced by the knockdown of CypA. EV71 infection led a very minor alteration of secreted CypA in the supernatant of RD-sh-control cells. very little CypA could be detected in the RD-sh-CypA culture. resistance to compound HL051001P2 maps to VP1 protein CypA. the EC50 value of compound HL051001P2 on wt-EV71 proliferation (3.56 M) was approximately 5-fold higher than the EC50 value for wt-EV71. the EC50 value of CsA was 2-fold higher for the wt-EV71 mutated virus. the EV71 RNA level in the RD-sh-CypA cells was approximately 70% of the levels in the RD-sh-control cells. recombinant CypA protein was clearly bound to wt-EV71. interaction of CypA with EV71 virion was increased by substituting with a proline residue at VP1-S243. mutated virus, i.e., can almost be abolished at a concentration of 4 M CsA. wt-EV71 virion showed weakened binding affinity to CypA than the wt-EV71 virion (strain AnHui1) the bands indicating the interactions between GST-CypA and wt-, S243P-, or S243A/P246A-EV71 virions were quantified. each column represents the average of three replicates. each column represents the average of three replicates. a catalytic-defective mutant of CypA called H126Q significantly attenuated the binding of wt-EV71 virions to CypA. CypA functions in the entry step of EV71 infection S243 is located in the H-I loop of the VP1 protein of the EV71 virus. several loop regions of the VP1 protein are known to play critical roles in the entry step during picornavirus infection [35] therefore, hypothesized that CypA may also act in the entry step of the EV71 life cycle. RD cells were infected by wt-EV71 virus at an MOI of 50. the inhibitor was added at 6, 4, 2, 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hpi. the data for EV71 viral titers in the supernatant were measured as previously described. RD-sh-control and RD-sh-CypA cells were infected with wt- or S243P-EV71. at 2 hpi, the cells were fixed and stained with anti-CypA antibodies. DAPI was used to visualize the nuclei (panels b, f, and j, blue) RD or RD-sh-CypA cells were infected with wt- and S243P-EV71. the growth curves revealed a similar curve, indicating that the VP1-S243P mutant confers resistance to CypA depletion. the results showed that infectious viral production was affected by the inhibitor at -6, -4 and -2 hpi. in RD-sh-CypA cells infected with wt-EV71, the localization of wt-EV71 was restricted to the cytoplasm of the perimembrane region at 2 hpi. we can also observe the colocalization of EV71 VP1 with CypA. the knockdown of CypA inhibited the internalization of EV71 and CypA was accumulated around EV71 virions. EV71 virion is an uncoating regulator of EV71 entry. virions that are binding to RD-sh-CypA and compensation by S243P mutation are likely to result in an interaction change. native 160S virions were treated at 61\u00b0C and 68\u00b0C under neutral conditions and analyzed by ultracentrifugation. we then incubated 160S virions with 20 g of CypA followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 4 h at pH 5.5 and pH 6.5. g of recombinant CypA followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 4 h at pH 5.5 and pH 6.5, respectively, before subjecting them to ultracentrifugation at 41,000 rpm for 10 h at 4\u00b0C. the catalytic-defective mutant of CypA, namely H126Q, was incubated with 160S particles at 37\u00b0C under pH 6.0 for 4 h, the shift in virions was completely eliminated P246A-EV71 and S243A/P243A-EV71 had slightly lower EV71 infectivity titers (P = 0.030 or P = 0.038, respectively) this finding indicated that a proline residue located in the H-I loop acts in the interaction of CypA and EV71. this finding is consistent with the results of the infection by wt-EV71 or S243P-EV71 in RD-sh-CypA cells. together, these results suggested that replacing S243-VP1 with a proline residue decreased viral fitness but conferred resistance to CypA inhibitors or caused a CypA loss of function. VP1-K242 and -K244, VP1-S243, and VP1-P266 are colored green, red and gold respectively. the VP1 loop is a mostly solvent-exposed region at the surface of the virus particle. the VP1 loop of VP1 functions in receptor binding or uncoating. lysine residues at the VP1-242 and 244 positions play essential roles in the binding of the EV71 virus to variable receptors. lysine residues are very close to the CypA action site in the VP1 H-I loop, which is VP1-S243. CypA mediated EV71 uncoating most distinctly at pH 6.0, but not at pH 5.5 and 6.0. endosome acidification increases during maturation, at values ranging from 6.8 to 6.1 in early endosomes to pH 6.0 to 4.8 in late endosomes. a similar observation was also found for the CypA study in HPV entry. RD-sh-CypA cells with wt-EV71 showed no significant difference. the downregulation of CypB did not attenuate but actually increased EV71 RNA replication and VP1 expression. the expression of endogenous CypB was also upregulated by EV71 infection. the cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (GIBCO) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. plasmids containing human EV71 strain SK-EV006 (AB469182.1) and EV71-GFP, which contains a gene that is inserted into the SK-EV006 secondary antibodies used for western blot analysis and immunofluorescence were purchased from Southern Biotech (HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG), CoWin Bioscience (HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG), Santa Cruz (PE-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG), and Life Technologies (donkey anti-rat IgG (H+L) cytopathic effects of RD cells were observed at 24 h post transfection. when 90% of the cells exhibited CPE, the cell supernatants were then collected by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 5 min. the target viruses were stored at -80\u00b0C. viral RNA was extracted from 125 l of the CsCl fraction containing EV71 virions by using TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen) to determine the amount of EV71 virions in the CsCl fractions, viral RNA was extracted from 50 l of the CsCl fraction containing EV71 virions. viability of RD cells was determined after 24 h of compound treatment. each data point represents the average of three replicates.
