{"summary": "human monoclonal antibodies have the ability to neutralize a broad spectrum of influenza viruses (including H1, H2, H5, H6 and H9 subtypes) they have the potential to prevent and treat influenza in humans. survival rates, clinically relevant disease signs such as changes in body weight and temperature, virus replication in lungs and upper respiratory tract were investigated. introduction a novel class of human monoclonal antibodies against influenza has been recently discovered. these antibodies neutralize the influenza virus by blocking its fusion with the host cell. this class of antibodies has shown the ability to neutralize a broad spectrum of influenza subtypes. virulence of this virus is currently moderate, particularly compared to the case fatality rate of over 60% of human H5N1 infections. the threat from highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses persists as they continue to circulate and evolve in bird populations. preventive vaccination has historically been the primary means of influenza control, but this approach has important limitations. the ferret is the most suitable disease model for human influenza infection. the ferret displays very human-like disease [20]\u2013[22]. panel B: Change in body weight at end of study expressed as percentage from baseline body weight. panel D: Viral shedding of infectious virus in the upper respiratory tract. panel C: shedding of infectious virus in the upper respiratory tract. ferrets treated with 30 or 10 mg/kg CR6261 did not shed infectious virus in the upper respiratory tract at any time. treatment with 3 and 1 mg/kg did not prevent shedding, but reduced the proportion of ferrets with infectious virus in nasal and/or throat swabs. levels of virus replication in the lungs were 3.9 and 2.9 log10 TCID50/g lower than that in the control group. animals that received 30 or 10 mg/kg CR6261 showed more regenerative response in the lungs, and more inflammatory changes in the trachea. no significant difference in lung weight was found between the groups receiving 3 or 1 mg/kg CR6261 and the control group (15.0 g; both comparisons p0.001) animals treated 24 hours post challenge showed a mean body weight loss of 8.4%. the group of ferrets treated with CR6261 had a mean maximum temperature of 40.0\u00b0C, compared to 41.8\u00b0C in the control group. ferrets treated with CR6261 at 24 hours post challenge did not shed infectious virus in the upper respiratory tract throughout the study. in the group treated with CR6261 at 24 hours post challenge, one ferret had a low concentration of infectious virus (2.8 log10 TCID50) in the throat on day one, but no virus was detected on subsequent days. in contrast, all animals in the control group shed virus during one or more days. CR6261 at 4 hours post challenge (8.4 g versus 5.7 g), but lower than that of the control group (p0.001) from the study outset, one animal had been added to each of the two treatment groups to be sacrificed for gross-pathology and histology on lungs as soon as 50% of the control animals died. the purpose was to test for possible bias due to differences in the timing of death. group of 6 ferrets received 30, 10, 3, or 1 mg/kg of mAb CR6261 or 30 mg/kg control mAb by intravenous injection. they were challenged 24 hours later with 105 TCID50 of influenza A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) the mean temperature in animals treated with the lower doses of CR6261 did not differ significantly from the control group. the mean temperature in animals observed 3 days before challenge was similar across the 5 groups, ranging from 37.6\u00b0C to 38.4\u00b0C. treatment with 3 and 1 mg/kg CR6261 did not prevent shedding. animals that received 30 and 10 mg/kg CR6261 showed much less pulmonary lesions compared to animals from the other groups. animals that received 10 mg/kg CR6261 showed more regenerative response in the lungs, and more inflammatory changes in the trachea. no significant difference in lung weight was found between the groups receiving 3 or 1 mg/kg CR6261 and the control group (15.0 g. animals treated 24 hours post challenge showed a mean body weight loss of 8.4%. the group of ferrets treated with CR6261 4 hours post challenge had a mean maximum temperature of 40.0\u00b0C, compared to 41.8\u00b0C in the control group. ferrets treated with CR6261 at 4 hours post challenge did not shed infectious virus in the upper respiratory tract throughout the study. the lungs of ferrets treated with CR6261 at 4 and 24 hours post challenge were considerably lower than that in the control group. animals that received CR6261 at 24 hours post challenge showed most regenerative response (bronchioloalveolar hyperplasia) in the lungs, suggesting damage to the lung parenchyma with subsequent regenerative response. from the study outset, one animal had been added to each of the two treatment groups to be sacrificed for gross-pathology and histology on lungs as soon as 50% of the control animals died. monoclonal antibodies against influenza viruses have been studied for decades. lack of monoclonal antibodies with broad neutralizing activity is due to the tolerance of influenza virus for genetic changes in the most immunogenic regions on its surface. this lack is due to the tolerance of influenza virus for genetic changes. CR6261 can be expected to be efficacious against disease caused by other, less virulent viruses it neutralized in vitro. a meta-analysis of experimental influenza infection of placebo-treated and untreated healthy volunteers showed that subjects with symptomatic illness shed virus in amounts 100 to 1000 fold higher than those who were not ill. CR6261 has been shown to recognize H1 viruses that have emerged over a time span of 90 years from the H1N1 virus which caused the 1918 \u2018Spanish flu\u2019 pandemic to the latest Brisbane viruses. this means that CR6261 could be used to protect against all H1 influenza viruses, including the ones resistant to oseltamivir. both antibodies were produced on PER.C6\u00ae cells. animals were housed in study groups of 6 (prophylactic experiment) or 10 (therapeutic experiment) only seronegative animals were used in the study. pharyngeal and nasal swabs were collected from all animals at day 1, day 2, day 4 and day 5. individual swabs were homogenized and resuspended in 3 ml medium. shedding from the upper respiratory tract was analysed by calculating the proportion of ferrets with detectable levels of infectious virus in nasal and/or throat swabs. paraffin embedded tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. the ferrets were anaesthetised with ketamin (25 mg/kg; i.m.) and antisedan (0.5 mg/kg; i.m.) a human monoclonal antibody was isolated from the IgM+, CD27+ B cell repertoire of a healthy individual who was recently vaccinated with the seasonal influenza vaccine. CR6261 was isolated from the IgM+, CD27+ B cell repertoire of a healthy individual who was recently vaccinated with the seasonal influenza vaccine. body temperature was recorded every 15 minutes throughout both experiments. the animal experiments were carried out in the central animal facilities of the Netherlands Vaccine Institute (NVI, Bilthoven) viral titres in tissues of brain, spleen, liver, kidney, and plasma were determined using the same method. pathology A complete macroscopic post-mortem examination was performed on all animals. thoracic, abdominal and pelvic cavities with their associated organs and tissues. body weight expressed as percentage change from baseline was calculated at the end of the study period (or earlier in the event of earlier death). maximum body temperatures were observed during day one."}
