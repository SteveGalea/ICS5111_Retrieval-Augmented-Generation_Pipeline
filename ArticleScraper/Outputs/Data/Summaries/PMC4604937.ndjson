{"summary": "antiviral prescription dispensing mirrored influenza A(H1N1) onset activity at the local level with no appreciable lag time. results suggest pharmacy-based surveillance can provide a mechanism to monitor and detect influenza-like activity. this might be especially important if the pathogen is not routinely tested for. pharmacy-based surveillance remains a cornerstone of influenza surveillance. but the need for more timely surveillance data has never been greater. successful results of most mitigation strategies are best achieved if implemented in the community as early as possible."}
