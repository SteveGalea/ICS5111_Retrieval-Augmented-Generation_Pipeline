{"summary": "porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is a highly contagious pathogen. it causes acute and severe watery diarrhoea, vomiting and dehydration. it shows 50\u2013100 per cent mortality in up to one-week-old piglets and less severe disease in older pigs. PEDV is clinically indistinguishable from other diarrhoea diseases such as transmissible gastritis-enteritis virus infection. a rapid test kit that is specific and sensitive to PEDV is critical to monitoring this disease on pig farms. d was transformed into Escherichia coli DH10Bac containing a baculovirus shuttle vector (Bacmid, Invitrogen) the recombinant Bacmid DNA carrying the PEDV-N protein gene was transfected using Cellfectin Reagent (Invitrogen) into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf-9) cells. expression of the protein gene was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using SDS-PAGE. mAb anti-PED 3B12-1A6 and mAb anti-PED 1H12-1C6 hybridomas were selected. the ascetic fluid was then purified on protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow. biotinylated mAb and non-biotinylated mAb were added to the wells. colour reaction was stopped and read as optical density at 450 nm. monoclonal antibody purified from ascetic fluid using protein. a different monoclonal antibody, anti-PED 1H12-1C6, was mixed with colloidal gold prepared by trisodium citrate reduction method. the assay strips were prepared by assembly with the colloidal gold-conjugated glass fibre, the nitrocellulose membrane and an absorbent paper. the specificity of the ICA kit against PEDV was evaluated for other porcine viruses including TGEV, PRCV and porcine rotavirus. real-time RT-PCR was carried out in a total volume of 20 l containing viral RNA, PEDV forward (5\u2019-CGCAAAGACTGAACCCACTAATTT-3\u2019) primers, probe (6-carboxyfluorescein [FAM]-5\u2019-TGTTGCCATTGCCACGACTCCTGC-3\u2019-BHQ1), 4x TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) piglets were orally inoculated with 3 ml of PEDV-DR13 strain (102.0 LD50/ml) in minimum medium cell culture medium. clinical signs in all piglets were monitored for 10 consecutive days postinoculation (dpi) recombinant baculoviruses expressing PEDV-N protein were propagated in Sf-9 cells. expression of the protein gene was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using SDS-PAGE. membrane was blocked in 5% skimmed milk buffer and incubated with anti-PEDV. the fused cells were seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates. mAb anti-PED 3B12-1A6 and mAb anti-PED 1H12-1C6 hybridomas were selected. the ascetic fluid was then purified on protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow. the mAbs recognise different epitopes of PEDV as in a previously described method. biotinylated mAb and non-biotinylated mAb were added to the wells. the colour reaction was stopped and read as optical density at 450 nm. a different monoclonal antibody, anti-PED 1H12-1C6, was mixed with colloidal gold prepared by trisodium citrate reduction method. the assay strips were prepared by assembly with the colloidal gold-conjugated glass fibre, the nitrocellulose membrane and an absorbent paper using polyvinyl chloride self-adhesive floor. specificity of the ICA kit against PEDV was evaluated for other porcine viruses including TGEV, PRCV and porcine a total of 130 rectal swab samples were collected from pig farms in eight provinces in south Korea between January 2012 and may 2014. a total of eight piglets (three-day-old, seronegative for PEDV) were obtained from sows with no disease history. a total of eight piglets (three-day-old, seronegative for PEDV) were obtained from sows. the rectal cavity of piglets was gently rubbed with a sterile moistened cotton swab. a total of 100 l of the supernatant was added to the test well of the ICA kit using a disposable dropper. expression of the PEDV N protein was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. the specificity of PEDV mAb by indirect immunofluorescence assay (B) cells infected with PEDV and stained with PEDV mAbs (3B12-1A6 or 1H12-1C6) showed typical cytoplasmic fluorescence. the best result for detecting the PEDV detection threshold was obtained. we applied 0.600.12 g mAb anti-PED 3B12-1A6 to a nitrocellulose membrane. the maximum intensity of test line colouring was detected when the mAb anti-PED 1H12-1C6 conjugated with 0.10.02 g colloidal gold of coated on a glass fibre membrane for immobilisation. of the 130 swab samples tested, 58 were positive for PEDV. 72 were negative according to the ICA kit, whereas 60 were positive. the relative sensitivity and specificity of the ICA kit compared with those of real-time RT-PCR were 95.0 per cent. piglets Pigs Test Days postinoculation 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

methods for virus diagnosis such as real-time PCR. however, high relative specificity and sensitivity results for PEDV were observed using field samples. the ICA kit can differentiate PEDV variant strains using a multiplex strip. the kit should be developed in future studies."}
