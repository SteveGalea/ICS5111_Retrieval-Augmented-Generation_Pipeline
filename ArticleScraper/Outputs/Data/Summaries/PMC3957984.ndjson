{"summary": "respiratory problems are a major cause of mortality in swine herds. 53.7% of nursery pig deaths and 60.1% of grower-finisher pig deaths attributed to respiratory problems. Bordetella bronchiseptica is widespread in swine populations. a spectrum of phenotypic phases transition between a virulent (Bvg+) phase and a nonvirulent (Bvg) phase. many known virulence factors are expressed, including the type III secretion system (T3SS) the Bvg+ phase is necessary and sufficient for colonization of the respiratory tract. the mouse has been the primary animal model used to investigate virulence mechanisms of B. bronchiseptica. the T3SS mutants induce higher levels of serum anti-Bordetella antibodies than mice infected with the wild type. KM22, a virulent B. bronchiseptica swine isolate, harbors a ribotype and pertactin type shared with the majority of strains isolated from swine. all strains were grown at 37\u00b0C on Bordet-Gengou (BG) agar. a 1,080-bp DNA fragment covering the region immediately 5\u2032 of bscN was amplified by PCR using primers bscNf1-for and bscNf1-rev. the insert of pTN35, containing the upstream region of bscN, was cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) via EcoRI and XbaI sites to obtain pTN41 the 2,335-bp DNA fragment was amplified from pTN43 by PCR using primers bscNf1-for and bscNf2B-rev. the resulting PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1 (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to create pTN53. pTN53 was introduced into E. coli SM10pir (42) and transconjugated into KM22. B. bronchiseptica strains were grown for 48 h at 37\u00b0C in SS broth. bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4,500 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. secreted proteins were precipitated by addition of sodium deoxycholate to 0.1% and trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 20% (wt/vol) med RPMI medium lacking phenol red with 5% FBS, 1% l-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 1% sodium pyruvate was used to replace the DMEM. Isolated alveolar macrophages were seeded at 105 cells per well. pigs were inoculated intranasally at 1 week of age with 1 ml of a bacterial suspension containing 106 CFU of KM22 or KM22bscN or with 1 ml of sterile PBS. pigs were inoculated intranasally at 1 week of age with 1 ml of a bacterial suspension containing 106 CFU of KM22 or KM22bscN. nasal swabs were placed into tubes containing 500 l PBS and vortexed. nasal washes were performed by instilling 5 ml of PBS into the nasal cavity through one nostril. lavage was performed by filling the lungs with 50 ml of sterile PBS, massaging, and aspirating. the least-squares mean estimates for log10 CFU were used in a priori contrasts after testing for either a significant (P 0.05) effect of the bacterial challenge strains or a significant strain by time interaction. a 5% level of significance (P 0.05) was used to assess statistical differences. sections of lung taken at necropsy for microscopic evaluation were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 h and then placed in 70% ethanol. all sections were routinely processed and embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. RNA was then isolated using MagMAX-96 for Microarrays total RNA isolation kit. B. bronchiseptica-specific antibody was detected using secondary antibodies specific for swine IgG. endpoint antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution giving an OD405 of 0.1 higher than the average OD measured for the negative control. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole blood. tracheal-bronchial lymph node (TBLN) cells were isolated by mechanical homogenization. a control group of 8 pigs was intranasally inoculated with 1 ml sterile PBS. 3 naive pigs, serving as direct contacts, were placed in each of the empty pens. nasal swabs collected 5, 12, 19, and 26 days postcontact. all B. bronchiseptica strains were grown at 37\u00b0C on Bordet-Gengou (BG) agar (Difco, Sparks, MD) supplemented with 10% sheep's blood or, when specified, in Stainer-Scholte (SS) broth (40). pTN35 was cloned into pUC19 via EcoRI and XbaI sites. 1,258-bp DNA fragment extending from codon 436 of bscN into the adjacent downstream region was amplified from KM22 genomic DNA by PCR using primers bscNf2-for and bscNf2-rev. the insert of pTN37, containing the downstream region of bscN, was excised by XbaI and HindIII digestion and cloned into pCR2.1 to create pTN43 a deletion of the bscN gene by DNA sequence analysis of a PCR amplicon. bscNf1-for GAATTCCAGTTGAAGGTCGCTATTGT bscNf1-rev TCTAGAGATGTAGTGGTACTGACGCTATTGT bscNf2-rev. pended in 0.25 ml SDS-PAGE loading buffer (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) proteins in 0.02 ml of each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE with a 4 to 12% bis-Tris acrylamide gel (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) cell cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 4 h. results were analyzed using the Cytotox96 kit (Promega, Madison, WI) pigs from each group were euthanized for sample collection. snouts were transected and removed at the level of the first premolar tooth. trachea was severed just below the larynx and lung were removed. the number of CFU of B. bronchiseptica per ml was determined by plating 100 l of the dilutions on duplicate selective blood agar plates containing 20 g/ml penicillin. the limit of detection was 10 CFU/ml. the atrophic rhinitis score is the sum of the four scroll scores and ranges from 0 to 16. a 5% level of significance was considered significant. pathological evaluation of the lung was performed at necropsy. cDNA was synthesized using high-capacity RNA-to-cDNA master mix. results were log2 transformed and analyzed for significance. serum was collected from the same four pigs from each experimental group. Statistical analyses of the serum antibody response were performed using a mixed linear model (SAS 9.2 for Windows XP; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) for repeated measures and a heterogeneous autoregressive covariance structure. comparisons were made between challenge groups for each challenge group at each time point using a 5% level of significance (P 0.05) to assess statistical differences. transmission experiments in swine were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. twenty-eight naturally farrowed early-weaned piglets were used in the transmission experiments. B. bronchiseptica was not isolated from nasal swabs collected from all piglets prior to the start of the experiment. in-frame deletion of bscN in KM22 leads to decreased secretion of polypeptides and decreased in vitro cytotoxicity. strain KM22bscN exhibited a growth rate and degree of hemolysis on BG blood agar similar to those of wild-type KM22. the bacterial culture supernatant from KM22 are present in greater amounts in the supernatant from KM22bscN, some of which appear to be absent from the supernatant from KM22bscN. these results are similar to the results reported for the corresponding isogenic mutant in RB50 and demonstrate that deletion of the bscN gene in KM22 results in an apparent decrease in a subset of Bvg+ phase-associated proteins. both KM22 and KM22bscN showed a high level of cytotoxicity. in contrast, the cytotoxic activity of RB50bscN and KM22bscN was significantly lower than that of the wild-type strains KM22 and KM22bscN respectively. no clinical signs were observed in piglets from groups inoculated with PBS. B. bronchiseptica CFU were not recovered from any site in the respiratory tracts of piglets inoculated with PBS. however, there were statistically significant differences observed at some time points. scN was quantified 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, and 56 days postinoculation. the y axis indicates the mean log10 CFU standard errors. a P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. a functional Bordetella T3SS is required for persistence in the lower swine respiratory tract. the degree of atrophic rhinitis was evaluated by determining the mean turbinate atrophy score for piglets inoculated with KM22, KM22bscN or PBS on days 7, 14, 28, and 56 postinfection. the KM22bscN-infected pigs (P 0.01) were statistically higher than the mean score for the KM22bscN-infected pigs (P 0.05) the mean score for the KM22bscN-infected pigs was statistically higher than the mean score for the KM22bscN-infected pigs (P 0.05) b Data are reported as the number of pigs with pneumonia out of the total number possible for the respective strain of B. bronchiseptica. d Microscopically only 1 of the 3 pigs with pneumonia had lesions consistent with Bordetella infection. 2 of the 3 pigs had only lesions similar to those seen in PBS control pigs. suppurative bronchopneumonia with areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, or fibroplasia. only 7 pigs out of 16 infected with KM22bscN had areas of consolidation. other 4 pigs infected with KM22bscN had lesions only microscopically similar to those of the control pigs. by day 28 postinfection, mRNA levels overall were lower than at day 7 postinfection for both challenge groups. however, significant differences in mRNA levels for IL-6, RANTES, and IL-10 between challenge groups were observed on day 28. levels of mRNA for the cytokine targets were also evaluated in alveolar macrophages collected from the same pigs. serum levels of anti-Bordetella IgG were quantified in pigs infected with KM22 or KM22bscN. heat-killed KM22 whole cells were used as the antigen. higher serum levels of anti-Bordetella IgG were detected in KM22- and KM22bscN-infected pigs. KM22 (A) or KM22bscN (B) as the antigen. the y axis indicates the log2 mean relative titer standard errors for 4 pigs per treatment group. anti-Bordetella antibodies were measured by ELISA using KM22 (A) or KM22bscN (B) as the antigen. a one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's posttest was used for statistical analysis. PBMCs (A) and TBLN cells (B) were collected on days 28 and 56 postchallenge from pigs infected intranasally with KM22 or KM22bscN or mock challenged with PBS. cells were restimulated with heat-killed B. bronchiseptica KM22. the supernatants were analyzed for IL-10 production by ELISA. the exact experimental procedure was replicated in a second isolation room. the two pigs serving as primary challenged pigs were intranasally inoculated with KM22bscN. transmission by indirect contact occurred for both KM22 and KM22bscN. KM22 KM22bscN Primary Direct Indirect Primary Direct Indirect 5 2/2 0/3 0/5 2/2 0/3 0/5 12 2/2 3/3 0/5 2/2 3/3 2/5 19 2/2 3/3 5/5 2/2 3/3 5/5 26 2/2 3/3 3/3 5/5 a Pigs were euthanized on day 28 of the experiment, 26 days after initial contact with primary challenged pigs. the virulent swine isolate KM22 has been successfully used by our laboratory to develop a reproducible swine respiratory disease model. to examine the contribution of the T3SS to Bordetella pathogenesis in swine, we constructed an in-frame deletion in the bscN gene of KM22. we compared the protein profiles of culture supernatants from KM22 and KM22bscN grown under Bvg+ conditions. a subset of Bvg+ phase-associated proteins were found in the culture supernatant. KM22 and KM22bscN showed a high level of cytotoxicity. the cytotoxic activity of RB50bscN and KM22bscN was significantly lower than that of the wild. -type strains RB50 and KM22 are required for T3SS-mediated cytotoxicity by strain KM22. these data are in agreement with previous findings involving RB50 and RB50bscN in mouse macrophages. there was no significant overall difference in CFU levels recovered from the nasal cavities of pigs infected with either KM22 or KM22bscN. on day 7 postinfection, the CFU levels recovered from KM22bscN-infected pigs were significantly (P 0.035) higher than the CFU levels recovered from KM22bscN-infected pigs. the dashed lines indicate the limit of detection (log10 of 1). KM22bscN compared to KM22 on day 7 postinoculation (P = 0.0001; a), for KM22 compared to KM22bscN on day 21 postinoculation (P 0.003; c), for KM22 compared to KM22bscN on day 28 postinoculation (P 0.04; d); for KM22 compared to the degree of atrophic rhinitis was evaluated by determining the mean turbinate atrophy score for piglets inoculated with KM22, KM22bscN, or PBS. piglets infected with KM22 had mean turbinate atrophy scores of greater than 2 at all time points examined. Mean turbinate atrophy scores and percentages of the lungs affected by pneumonia in pigs inoculated with B. bronchiseptica KM22 or KM22bscN Day of necropsy Group Mean % pneumonia (range) No. of pigs with pneumoniab 7 PBS control 1.5 (0\u20132) 0.875 (0\u20132) 2/4c KM22 3.75 (1\u20138) 3.625 (0\u201310) 3/4 KM22bscN 1.75 (0\u20134) d Microscopically only 1 of the 3 pigs with pneumonia had lesions consistent with Bordetella infection. 2 of the 3 pigs had only lesions similar to those seen in PBS control pigs. degree of pneumonia and microscopic character of the lesions were also determined for piglets inoculated with KM22, KM22bscN, or PBS. pigs out of 16 infected with KM22bscN had areas of consolidation. the other 4 pigs had lesions only microscopically similar to those of control pigs. the Bordetella T3SS modulates the swine immune response. mRNA levels for cytokines IL-6 and RANTES were greater in TECs from KM22bscN-infected pigs than in TECs from KM22bscN-infected pigs. levels of mRNA for cytokine targets were also evaluated in alveolar macrophages collected from the same pigs. however, levels were minimally increased over those detected in noninfected pigs. heat-killed KM22bscN whole cells were used as the antigen. higher serum levels of anti-Bordetella IgG were detected in KM22- and KM22bscN-infected pigs than in KM22bscN-infected pigs. KM22 compared to KM22bscN on day 42 postinoculation (P = 0.0306; b), and KM22 compared to KM22bscN on day 56 postinoculation (P 0.001; c). a P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. a similar trend was observed when heat-killed KM22 whole cells were used as the antigen. production of IL-10 and gamma interferon (IFN-) by PBMCs and TBLN cells was measured. on day 28 postinfection significantly higher IL-10 levels were detected. similar IL-10 levels were detected in restimulated PBMCs from KM22- and KM22bscN-infected pigs. PBMCs (A) and TBLN cells (B) were collected on days 28 and 56 postchallenge from pigs infected intranasally with KM22 or KM22bscN or mock challenged with PBS. cells were restimulated with heat-killed B. bronchiseptica KM22. supernatants were analyzed for IL-10 production by ELISA. pigs were intranasally inoculated with sterile PBS and allowed to comingle. direct and indirect transmission occurred for both KM22 and KM22bscN. all of the direct-contact pigs from each group became colonized. pigs were euthanized on day 28 of the experiment, 26 days after initial contact with primary challenged pigs. on the same day, five naive pigs serving as indirect-contact pigs were added to a separate pen. one isolation room was used per contact strain studied. septica-specific virulence factors involved in pathogenesis and transmission in swine provide data directly relevant and necessary for designing improved vaccines and therapeutic interventions. to examine the contribution of the Bordetella T3SS to pathogenesis of B. bronchiseptica in swine, we compared the T3SS deletion mutant to the wild-type swine isolate KM22. levels of the T3SS mutant recovered from the nasal cavity were significantly lower than wild-type KM22 levels. the decreased colonization levels of the T3SS mutant at the last time point may imply a role for the Bordetella T3SS in persistence in the nasal cavity. disease severity was less in pigs infected with the T3SS mutant than in KM22-infected pigs. disease severity was less extensive in terms of necrosis, hemorrhage, or fibroplasia. the T3SS significantly contributes to B. bronchiseptica-associated pathology. circulating B. bronchiseptica-specific IgG is transferred to piglets in colostrum. the immune status of piglets at challenge is significantly different from that of naive mice routinely used for identifying immune factors involved in B. bronchiseptica persistence and pathogenesis. KM22-infected pigs showed little evidence of an active humoral immune response greater than maternal antibody following KM22 challenge. despite minimal differences in B. bronchiseptica-specific IgG levels, significantly higher IgG levels were detected in the BALF of KM22-infected pigs on days 28 and 56 following challenge. despite the increased levels of B. bronchiseptica-specific IgG in the lungs of KM22-challenged pigs, significantly higher CFU levels were recovered from the lungs of KM22-challenged pigs. this may be a result of the cytotoxicity of KM22 for alveolar macrophages, whose Fc receptors are required for antibody-mediated clearance (47). lymphocytes collected from peripheral blood and TBLNs of KM22-infected pigs on day 28 postinfection produced significantly more IL-10 following restimulation than lymphocytes isolated from pigs infected with the T3SS mutant. on day 56 postinfection, no significant differences were observed for the IL-10 produced by PBMCs following restimulation. the levels produced by PBMCs collected from KM22-infected pigs were less than those produced our data support a role for the T3SS in altering the adaptive immune response. the T3SS mutant could be transmitted directly to naive pigs and indirectly to naive pigs when pigs were physically separated by pens."}
