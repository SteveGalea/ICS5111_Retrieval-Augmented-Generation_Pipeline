{"summary": "influenza viruses are segmented, negative-stranded RNA viruses that have no quality-control mechanisms during replication. all 16 HA subtypes, including H5 and H7, have until recently been considered benign in their natural hosts. this benign equilibrium between the virus and its host may have changed. h5/H7 influenza viruses were known to cause conjunctivitis in humans. the precursor of the H5N1 virus that spread to humans in 1997 was first detected in Guangdong, china, in 1996. a single genotype of the virus was responsible for killing most wild, domestic, and exotic waterfowl. the phylogeny of the recent Z genotype viruses showed that viruses isolated in Vietnam and Thailand formed a cluster that remained distinct from those isolated in Indonesia. phylogeny of the recent Z genotype viruses showed that viruses isolated in Vietnam and Thailand formed a cluster that remained distinct from those isolated in Indonesia. most H5N1 influenza viruses isolated from avian species in Asia since 1997 are highly pathogenic in gallinaceous poultry. pathogenicity of the viruses varies from high to nonpathogenic. in ferrets, most avian isolates replicate and cause respiratory tract infection, while a few strains are highly pathogenic. most avian H5N1 isolates isolated in Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia were highly pathogenic to chickens and domestic ducks. by late 2003 and early 2004, some avian isolates were nonpathogenic to ducks but retained their pathogenicity to chickens. some virus isolates formed small plaques that were pathogenic to ducks. a subdominant population of H5N1 viruses is presumably selected in ducks. the subdominant population appears uniformly nonpathogenic to ducks. the duck has become the Trojan horse of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza in Asia (20) the migration route of shorebirds in the east Asian-Australasian flyway does overlap the areas that have had H5N1 outbreaks. the virus has been absent in Taiwan, Malaysia (except for occasional outbreaks near the Thai border) and western Australia (Figure 2). the role of migratory birds in the transmission and spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses is still unclear. countries shown in red have had outbreaks of HP H5N1 since 2004. culling domestic poultry to contain the spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 virus is considered an acceptable agricultural practice. the idea of culling migratory birds must be strongly discouraged, for it could have unknown ecological consequences. some avian isolates were nonpathogenic to ducks but retained their pathogenicity to chickens. by late 2003 and early 2004, some avian isolates were nonpathogenic to ducks. some virus isolates formed small plaques that were pathogenic to both birds and ferrets. a subdominant population of H5N1 viruses is presumably selected in ducks. the subdominant population appears uniformly nonpathogenic to ducks. the duck has become the Trojan horse of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza in Asia (20) the migration route of shorebirds in the east Asian-Australasian flyway does overlap the areas that have had H5N1 outbreaks. the virus has been absent in Taiwan, Malaysia (except for occasional outbreaks near the Thai border) and western Australia (Figure 2). the role of migratory birds in transmission and spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses is still unclear. countries shown in red have had outbreaks of HP H5N1 since 2004. the geographic range of H5N1 may be extended by bar-headed geese or by ducks less susceptible to lethal infection. culling domestic poultry to contain the spread of highly pathogenic virus is considered an acceptable agricultural practice. the pros and cons of the use of vaccines in poultry have been reviewed. current technologies permit discrimination between vaccinated and naturally infected birds. vaccines are not standardized on the basis of antigen content. bad agricultural vaccines prevent disease signs but do not prevent shedding of transmissible levels of virus. they also promote undetected spread of virus on farms and to live poultry markets and promote antigenic drift. resurgence of H5N1 in Indonesian poultry and pigs and detection of H5N1 in apparently healthy birds in live poultry markets in china. chickens previously infected with highly pathogenic H5N1 were protected from disease signs and death when challenged with highly pathogenic H5N1. the chickens shed H5N1 virus in their feces (28) but the cross-protection was due to cell-mediated immunity. no other subtypes of influenza A viruses have been reported in poultry in Vietnam or Thailand. in southern china in 2005, unobserved infection suggests that highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses continue to circulate unseen among poultry in china. we cannot afford simply to hope that human-to-human spread of the virus will not happen and that, if it does, the pathogenicity of the virus will attenuate. we cannot wait and allow nature to take its course."}
