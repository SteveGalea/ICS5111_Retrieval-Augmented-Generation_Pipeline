{"summary": "in the united states, the disease causes approximately $664 million in losses to american swine producers annually (1). clinical signs of PRRS include reproductive failure in pregnant sows and respiratory diseases in young pigs. PRRSV genome encodes at least 22 different viral proteins (5). a highly pathogenic variant of type 2 PRRSV (HP-PRRS) is endemic in Asia, causing death in pigs of all ages. the genetic variation among PRRSV strains within each genotype is substantial. the average substitution rate for type 2 PRRSV open reading frame 5 is estimated to be 9.6 103 substitutions/site/year (23) the levels of heterologous protection conferred by chimeric viruses remain to be tested. vaccine immunogen sequences should be located at the center of a phylogenetic tree. the use of centralized sequences could reduce genetic distances between vaccine immunogens and the wild-type viruses by half of those between any wild-type virus and another. all animal experiments in this study were conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act of 1966 and its amendments (82) and the Guide for the care and use of Agricultural animals in research and teaching. the animal care and use protocol was approved by the University of Nebraska\u2014Lincoln (UNL) Institutional animal care and use committee. PRRSV strain 16244B (GenBank accession no. AY545985) was isolated in 1997 from a piglet. PRRSV strain MN184C (GenBank accession no. EF488739 [47]) was kindly provided by K. S. Faaberg, National Animal Disease Center. we sequenced the full genomes of 64 type 2 PRRSV strains/isolates. a phylogenetic tree of the 59 naturally occurring PRRSV genomes was constructed. a full-genome cDNA clone of PRRSV-CON was constructed according to a strategy described previously (46) transfected cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for up to 6 days. the culture supernatant containing the rescued virus was collected and passed into naive cells one more time to obtain enough virus stock. a virus neutralization assay was done with MARC-145 cells using a fluorescent-focus neutralization assay described previously (52). Neutralization titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that showed a 90% reduction in fluorescent foci presenting in the control wells. pigs in groups 2 and 3 were inoculated intramuscularly with 105.0 TCID50 of PRRSV-CON and PRRSV strain FL12, respectively. viremia levels were quantitated by the animal disease research and diagnostic laboratory, south Dakota State University, using a commercial quantitative reverse transcription-PCR kit. pigs were humanely sacrificed and necropsied at 15 days p.c. to quantitate levels of viral load in tissues. samples of tonsil, lung, mediastinal lymph node, and inguinal lymph node were snap-frozen. differential qRT-PCR kits developed in-house that selectively detect viral RNA from challenge infection only. five microliters of each RNA sample (equivalent to 1 g RNA) was used for each qRT-PCR. results were reported as log10 copies per microgram of total RNA. the PRRSV-specific hyperimmune antibody used for virus neutralization assays was generated previously (42). PRRSV-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) used for indirect-immunofluorescence assays include anti-GP5 (clone ISU25-C1 [43]), anti-M protein (clone 201 [44]) and anti-N protein (clone SDOW17 [45] were purchased from Invitrogen (Eugene genome sequences of 64 type 2 PRRSV strains/isolates originating in midwestern states of the united states. a consensus genome (PRRSV-CON) was constructed by using the Jalview program (49). a full-genome cDNA clone of PRRSV-CON was constructed according to a strategy described previously (46). restriction enzyme sites used for assembling the full-genome cDNA clone include NotI, SphI, PmeI, and PacI. the restriction enzyme sites were added to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the PRRSV-CON cDNA genome. culture supernatant containing the rescued virus was collected and passed into naive MARC-145 cells one more time to obtain enough virus stock for future studies. cells were mock infected or infected with PRRSV-CON and wild-type FL12. a total of 18 PRRSV-seronegative, 3-week-old pigs were purchased from the UNL research farm. each treatment group was housed in a separate room in the biosecurity level 2 animal research facility at the UNL. pigs were humanely sacrificed and necropsied at day 14 p.i. pigs were humanely sacrificed and necropsied. two sets of immunization/challenge experiments were conducted. each pig was weighed immediately before challenge infection. results were reported as log10 copies per milliliter. samples that had undetectable levels of viral RNA were assigned a value of 0 log RNA copies/ml. pigs were humanely sacrificed and necropsied at 15 days p.c. data were analyzed as a completely randomized design by using the MIXED procedure in SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) all means are presented as least-squares means and standard errors of means (SEM) a vaccine formulated based on PRRSV-CON would confer broader levels of heterologous protection than a conventional vaccine formulated based on a naturally occurring PRRSV strain. we hypothesized that a vaccine formulated based on PRRSV-CON would confer broader levels of heterologous protection than a conventional vaccine formulated based on a naturally occurring PRRSV strain. the resultant PRRSV-CON strain reacted with different PRRSV-specific monoclonal antibodies, including antibodies against the GP5, M, and N proteins. PRRSV-CON replicated efficiently in cell culture compared with the reference wild-type PRRSV strain FL12 (46) the virus replicates mainly in macrophages residing in lung and lymphoid organs (55) in vitro characterization of synthetic PRRSV-CON. at the top is a schematic representation of the PRRSV genome. the horizontal black lines represent the DNA fragments synthesized. the numbers inside the parentheses below the lines indicate the length (in nucleotides [nt] of each corresponding fragment. the PRRSV-CON and FL12 groups displayed significantly higher rectal temperature than did the PBS group. pigs infected with PRRSV-CON had the same kinetics and magnitude of viremia as those of pigs infected with PRRSV strain FL12. in the first immunization/challenge experiment, we evaluated levels of cross-protection against PRRSV strain MN184C. pigs in the PRRSV-CON and FL12 groups had better ADWG than those in the PBS group. viremia levels after challenge infection are presented in Fig. 5B and Table 1. the results for total viral RNA are presented in Fig. 5C. the PRRSV-CON and FL12 groups had significantly lower levels of total viral RNA than did the PBS group. pigs in the PBS group carried the MN184C-specific RNA in their tissues. viremia levels after challenge infection determined by a commercial qRT-PCR kit (Tetracore, Rockville, MD) total viral RNA levels in different tissues collected at 15 days p.c. 0.00 0.00 2.81 2.92 0.00 0.00 381 0.00 0.00 0.00 3.04 2.86 0.00 440 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 4.18 4.34 0.00 0.00 0.00 487 0.00 3.59 5.28 2.40 5.60 2.68 507 0.00 2.32 5.56 3.70 0.00 0.00 Mean for group 0.00 0.99 2.97 2.73 1.41 0.45 SD for group 0.00 1.58 2.50 1.50 2.35 1.09 PRRSV-CON and FL12 groups resolved viremia by day 50 post-primary infection. both groups contained significantly lower levels of total viral RNA than did the PBS group for all of the tissues tested. however, there was no difference between the PRRSV-CON and FL12 groups in regard to levels of total viral RNA in tissues. total viral RNA levels in different tissues collected at day 15 p.c. as determined by a commercial qRT-PCR kit (Tetracore, Rockville, MD). levels of viremia after challenge infection with 16244Ba Group and pig Level of viremia (log10 copies/ml) at postchallenge day. pig 435 (group 2) and pig 543 (group 3) were removed from expt on day 14 after primary infection Mean for group 0.00 3.90 5.35 2.55 1.29 0.00 SD for group 0.00 0.95 1.23 2.39 1.84 0.00 a sample. 59 PRRSV full-genome sequences can be divided into 4 subgroups. the mean nucleotide distances between any 2 subgroups range from 8.0% to 15.7%. the PRRSV-CON genome is located precisely at the center of the phylogenetic tree. the synthetic PRRSV-CON genome is fully infectious. the synthetic PRRSV-CON genome was chemically synthesized and assembled into a bacterial plasmid. PRRSV-CON produced larger plaques than did FL12. in vitro, the virus replicates mainly in macrophages residing in lung and lymphoid organs (55). in vitro, the virus is propagated mainly in primary PAMs (41) and in the monkey kidney cell line MA-104. pigs in group 1 were inoculated intramuscularly with 105.0 TCID50 of PRRSV-CON and FL12, respectively. after infection, the PRRSV-CON and FL12 groups displayed significantly higher rectal temperature than did the PBS group. all pigs in the PRRSV-CON and FL12 groups seroconverted by day 10 postinfection (p.i.) pigs in the PRRSV-CON group displayed a level of lung lesions similar to those in pigs in the FL12 group. the synthetic PRRSV-CON strain displays the same level of virulence as that of PRRSV strain FL12. the PRRSV-CON group had only 3 viremic pigs, of which 1 pig was viremic at 2 time points. the remaining 3 pigs in this group were not viremic after challenge infection. 5 out of 6 pigs in the FL12 group were viremic at two time points. BS group carried the MN184C-specific RNA in their tissues. four pigs in the FL12 group had the MN184C-specific RNA in their tonsil and mediastinal lymph node. none of the pigs in PRRSV-CON group had detectable levels of the MN184C-specific RNA in any of the tissue samples tested. 0 1 4 7 10 15 Group 1 (injected with PBS) 365 0.00 4.94 5.43 5.45 6.79 6.32 389 0.00 6.26 6.08 5.40 7.60 6.93 407 0.00 4.91 6.00 5.86 7.56 6.75 416 0.00 6.20 6.04 5.20 7.18 6.78 417 0.00 5.18 5.59 4.86 5.90 6.45 435 0.00 5.83 5.08 5.94 5.57 5.36 Mean for group 0.00 5.55 5.70 5.45 6.77 6. PRRSV-CON strain 16244B falls within subgroup 2 in the phylogenetic tree. the PRRSV-CON group had a higher ADWG than did the PBS and FL12 groups. viremia levels after challenge infection were presented in Fig. 6B and Table 2. pigs in the PRRSV-CON group carried the 16244B-specific RNA in their tissues. pigs in the PBS and FL12 groups carried the 16244B-specific RNA in their tissues. however, there was no difference between the PRRSV-CON group and the FL12 group in regard to the levels of total viral RNA in tissues. pig 435 (group 2) and pig 543 (group 3) were removed from the experiment due to lameness in their limbs. genetic stability of the PRRSV-CON strain in pigs. a number of synthetic viruses have been generated by de novo synthesis of the viral genomes in the absence of natural viral templates. this leads to the emergence of a new branch in the field of virus research, termed synthetic virology (58). the generation of centralized vaccine immunogens has been proven to be an effective method to reduce genetic distances between the vaccine immunogen and the contemporary virus strains circulating in the field. centralized vaccine immunogens are commonly generated based on the amino acid sequences of selected viral proteins (34\u201337, 69) 59 PRRSV genome sequences can be as large as 17.8%. genetic distances between 2 clades of the group M envelope proteins can be up to 30%. a vaccine based on a single consensus envelope sequence can elicit significantly broader cross-clade cellular immune responses. pigs previously infected with the PRRSV-CON strain carried undetectable levels of challenge PRRSV strains. those infected with FL12 showed only lower levels of challenge viral RNA. PRRSV-CON must be inactivated or attenuated before it can be used as a vaccine in pigs. virulent PRRSV-CON vaccines are far more effective than KV vaccines. it is highly possible that the killed PRRSV-CON vaccine may confer better levels of cross-protection than the KV vaccine made of naturally occurring PRRSV strains. a synthetic PRRSV strain was computationally designed based on a large number of PRRSV full-genome sequences. this synthetic PRRSV strain could be an excellent candidate for the formulation of the next generation of PRRS vaccines with improved levels of heterologous protection.
