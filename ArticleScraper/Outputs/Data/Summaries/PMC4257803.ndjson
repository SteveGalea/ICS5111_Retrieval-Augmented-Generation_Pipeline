{"summary": "226 pairs of cloacal and oropharyngeal swab specimens collected in china. samples were stored in viral medium at 4\u00b0C until they were transported to the laboratory and then stored at 80\u00b0C until analysis. cDNAs were synthesized from the viral RNA by reverse transcription PCR. all 8 genes of JXB15 and JX77 were adjacent to the corresponding genes of JX346 on phylogenetic trees. phylogenetic analysis showed that the HA genes of JXB15 and JX77 belong to the Eurasian avian lineage, whereas the NA genes belong to the North American avian lineage. phylogenetic trees of the internal genes of influenza virus A(H10N8) isolates from Jiangxi Province, china, 2013\u20132014 compared with other closely related influenza viruses. red indicates the novel H10N8 isolates A/chicken/Jiangxi/77/2013 (H10N8) and A/chicken/Jiangxi/B15/2014 (H10N8) that were identified in this study. Isolates were from mixed cloacal and oropharyngeal swab specimens collected in Nachang city, Jiangxi Province. nucleotide identity was calculated by using DNAStar software (http://www.dnastar.com) HA NA PB2 PB1 M1 M2 NS1 Connecting peptide RBS Deletion 119 274 292 89 357 591 627 701 473 598 30 215 31 42 69\u201373 Glu His Arg Val His Gln Glu Asp Val Leu Asn Ser A/Jiangxi-Donghu/346/2013. phylogenetic trees constructed from the 6 internal genes showed that JXB15, JX77, and JX346 clustered closely with H9N2 viruses isolated from Jiangxi in 2010 and 2011. the internal genes of JXB15 and JX77 shared 95.9%\u201398.9% identity with those of 5 H9N2 virus isolates collected from local poultry environments during 2010\u20132013. phylogenetic analysis showed that the PB2 genes of JXB15, JX77, and JX346 belong to the DE113-like lineage; the PB1, polymerase, and nucleoprotein genes belong to the SH/F/98-like lineage; the M genes belong to the G1-like lineage; and the NS genes belong to the BJ94-like lineage. human-infecting H7N9 virus strains are believed to be directly related to those found in live poultry traded in LPMs. closure of LPMs has been shown to partly control the spread of these infections (8)."}
