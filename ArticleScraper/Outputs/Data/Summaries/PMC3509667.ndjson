{"summary": "the single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of IBV is approximately 27 kb. it consists of genes coding RNA polymerase/transcriptase, spike protein (S), nonstructural proteins 3a and 3b, proteins E and M, nonstructural proteins 5a and 5b, and nucleocapsid protein (N) new recombinant viruses of KM91-type and QX-type strains have been used in the field. the protective efficacy of a vaccine depends on its antigenicity and immunogenicity. the absence of hierarchal ovarian follicles after experimental IBV infection has been reported. ated oil-emulsion vaccination raises questions about the protective efficacy of commercial vaccines against K-I type viruses. the animal experiment was applied to a vaccine efficacy test by challenging SPF hens which had been vaccinated at 13-w-o. lengths of 5a, 5b and N were conserved but others were variable. compared to other viruses, SNU8067 showed the highest nucleotide and amino acid identities with KM91 in the entire genome. the 5b gene also showed fewer amino acid identities than nucleotide identities. the nucleotide and amino acid identities of SNU8067 3a and 3b with Connecticut 46 strain were 95% and 93% and 93% and 94%, respectively, and were the highest compared to other strains. phylogenetic analysis of the partial amino acid sequences of the SNU8067 S1 gene clustered with K-I subtype viruses. KM91 clustered with K-I subtype viruses, and KM91 clustered with K-II subtype viruses. 2.3. Computational Recombination Analysis K-I and K-II viruses have co-circulated in Korea for a long time. the KM91 strain contained a small recombination fragment in the S1 gene (20,366\u201321,049) from the LX4 strain. a recombination event was supported by the extremely high P values for multiple recombination detection methods. specific antibody was detected at 5-weeks post-challenge in the control group and increased in the vaccinated group. the levels of antibody titers between the control and vaccinated groups after vaccination and challenge were significantly different. in the ovarian follicles and oviduct of the vaccinated (A) and control (B) chickens at 5 weeks after challenge infection with IBV SNU8067. aplasia of the ovarian follicles and atrophy of oviduct (green-colored arrow) with normal vaccinated chickens. the amino acid lengths of 5a, 5b and N were conserved but others were variable between SNU8067 and KM91. compared to other viruses, SNU8067 showed highest nucleotide and amino acid identities with KM91. the 5b gene also showed fewer amino acid identities than nucleotide identities. the nucleotide and amino acid identities of SNU8067 3a and 3b with Connecticut 46 strain were 95% and 93% and 93% and 94% respectively. 83/85 89/95 79/77 95/96 87/90 73/66 85/88 88/89 84/84 91/88 89/93 Conn46 93/94 93/97 78/76 87/90 95/93 93/94 85/91 91/91 97/97 98/94 93/96 M41 91/92 92/96 79/76 86/87 84/79 87/74 the KM91 strain contained a small recombination fragment in the S1 gene (20,366\u201321,049) from the LX4 strain. a recombination event was supported by the extremely high P values for multiple recombination detection methods. the IBV-specific antibody was detected at 5-weeks post-challenge in the control group and increased in the vaccinated group. the levels of antibody titers between the control and vaccinated groups after vaccination and challenge were significantly different. aplasia of the ovarian follicles and oviduct of the vaccinated (A) and control (B) chickens at 5 weeks after challenge infection with IBV SNU8067. KM91 was isolated from broiler chickens which suffered from nephropathogenic IB in 1991. cDNA was synthesized at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min and then heated at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min to activate Taq polymerase. PCR was performed with 40 repetitions of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 50 \u00b0C for 30 s, extension at 72 \u00b0C for 2 min, and a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 5 min.

Seoul, Korea) and sequenced with PCR primers. the amplicons were purified using a PCR purification kit (Macrogen Co. Seoul, Korea) a phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA software (version 5.0.5) [19]. the determined overlapping sequences of the 19 gene fragments were assembled into a single complete genome sequence using ChromasPro version 1.5 (Technelysium Pty Ltd., Brisbane, Australia) both groups were challenged with SNU8067 (106 EID50/100 L/chick) the infected chickens were observed for clinical signs and mortality for 5 weeks after the challenge. hens were caged in commercial cages, and water and feed were provided ad libitum. KM91 was inoculated into 10-d-o SPF embryonated chicken eggs. the allantoic fluid containing KM91 was harvested. the supernatant was stored at 70 \u00b0C after centrifugation at 1,500 g for 10 min. the primer sets for one-step RT-PCR of 19 overlapping fragments of the IBV genomes were listed in Table 4. the accession numbers of the reference strains used for analyses were as follows: Beaudette (M95169 and NC_001451). 68\u20139387 CCAGTGTGTAATGCATTAGG 7 1458 9244\u20139263 CCCTGTYACTATGCGYTCTA 10682\u201310701 GTTGTRCAYTTTACATCACT 8 1586 10547\u201310567 GATCAATATAGGTATATGT 12113\u201312132 GCTATRTGCTCTCTACAATA 9 1540 11993\u201312012 CAACCTTTAGGTAAYTGTGT 13513\u201313532 A PCR amplicons were purified using a PCR purification kit (Macrogen Co.
