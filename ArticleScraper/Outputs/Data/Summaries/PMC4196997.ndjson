{"summary": "IFITM3 polymorphism rs12252-C encodes an aberrant form of IFITM3 lacking the amino-terminal (N-terminal) 21 amino acids (21 IFITM3) contributes to poor clinical outcomes in patients with H1N1 IAV infections. the rs12252-C polymorphism has also been reported to be a prognostic factor for H7N9 avian influenza. 21 IFITM3 and Y20A IFITM3 restricted IAV entry and replication. tyrosine 20 of IFITM3 was critical for IFITM3 subcellular localization and its anti-viral function [11]\u2013[14]. 21 IFITM3 and Y20A IFITM3 distributed at the plasma and late endosomal/lysosomal membranes. epitope-tagged IFITM3 isoforms had inconsistent inhibitory effects on IAV entry and replication. they also had different subcellular distributions from those of native IFITM3 isoforms. etracycline (tet)-inducible IFITM3 isoforms were selected with 3 g/ml puromycin (Invitrogen) and 400 g/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen) DNA segments encoding native, N-terminal c-myc- or flag-FL IFITM3 and 21 IFITM3 sequences were introduced into the pQCXIP vector (Clontech) using restriction enzymes Bam infected cells were harvested, fixed with 1% formaldehyde (Polysciences) 48 hours after infection, infected cells were harvested, fixed with 1% formaldehyde (Polysciences) to test the effect of type I interferon (IFN) on viral entry and replication. cells were labeled with 0.5 g/ml murine anti-influenza H1 IgG2a (C179; Clontech) or with 1 g/ml anti-influenza viral H3 IgG1 (F49; Clontech), followed by an R-phycoerythin (PE)-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo scientific) IFITM3-expressing A549 cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% formaldehyde at 25\u00b0C for 20 minutes. fixed cells were permealized with 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 20 min. primary antibodies included a murine anti-lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2; H4B4 conjugate with Alexa 488, 1100 A549 cells transduced with a vector or to express tetracycline (tet)-inducible IFITM3 isoforms were selected with 3 g/ml puromycin (Invitrogen) and 400 g/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen) DNA fragments encoding native, N-terminal c-myc- or flag-FL IFITM3 and 21 IFITM3 sequences were also clone cells were incubated with transducing viruses mixed with 10 g/ml of polybrene (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes at 4,000g. the procedure for MLV-GFP pseudovirus infection were similar to that for transduction. infected cells were labeled with 0.5 g/ml murine anti-influenza H1 IgG2a (C179; Clontech) or with 1 g/ml anti-influenza viral H3 IgG1 (F49; Clontech), followed by an R-phycoerythin (PE)-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo scientific) IFITM3-expressing A549 cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% formaldehyde at 25\u00b0C for 20 minutes. fixed cells were permealized with 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 20 min, blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) at 25\u00b0C for 1 hour. tet-inducible plasmids encoding FL IFITM3 or 21 IFITM3 restrict IAVs. cells treated with or without doxycycline were incubated with MLV-GFP pseudotyped with IAV H1, H3, H5, and H7 proteins. a lower concentration of doxycycline was used to induce the expression of flag-tagged 21 IFITM3. infected cells were harvested, fixed with formaldehyde, and analyzed by flow cytometry. the relative infectivity was determined as the percentage of GFP positive cells normalized to that of nave A549 cells. the expression of \u2013tubulin was used as our loading controls. native (non-tagged) FL IFITM3 and 21 IFITM3 restricts IAV and VSV entry. the anti-IFITM1/2/3 antibody used in our studies had different affinities against native FL IFITM3 and 21 IFITM3. replication of influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Virginia/ATCC3/2009 (H1N1) was suppressed efficiently by both IFITM3 isoforms. influenza A/England/42/72 (H3N2) virus replicated more efficiently in 21 IFITM3-expressing cells. aliquots of cells used in (A) or (B) were analyzed by western blotting. expression of IFITM3 isoforms measured using the indicated antibodies. tyrosine 20 of IFITM3 is not a major determinant for IFITM-mediated restriction. the inhibitory effect of 21 IFITM3 on H3 and H7(FPV) infection was weaker than that of FL IFITM3 but still very prominent. both 21 IFITM3 and Y20A IFITM3 restricted IAV entry. tyrosine 20 of IFITM3 is functionally dispensable for IFITM3-mediated IAV restriction. infected cells were harvested, fixed with formaldehyde. native 21 IFITM3 and Y20A IFITM3 had broader subcellular distributions than FL IFITM3. both c-myc-tagged IFITM3 isoforms concentrated in late-endosomal compartments. a minimal amount of flag-tagged FL IFITM3 and 21 IFITM3 colocalized with LAMP2. cells expressing native FL IFITM3, 21 IFITM3, or Y20A IFITM3 were fixed, permeabilized, and labeled with anti-LAMP2 (green) and anti-IFITM2/3 (red) and DAPI (blue) antibodies. cells were then imaged by confocal microscopy. each panel represents at least two sets of experiments with similar results. the inhibitory effects of flag-tagged 21 IFITM3 on IAV and VSV entry were attenuated. a lower concentration of doxycycline was used to induce the expression of flag-tagged 21 IFITM3. a possible explanation is that more copies of the flag-tagged 21 IFITM3 gene might integrate into the chromosomes during initial transduction. the results are the averages of three independent infection replicates. each panel represents at least two sets of experiments with similar results. the expression of epitope-tagged FL IFITM3 and that of 21 IFITM3 recognized by an anti-c-myc or an anti-flag antibody were comparable. native FL IFITM3 and 21 IFITM3 strongly restricted IAV H1-, H5-, and H7(Shan)-mediated entry. both native FL IFITM3 and 21 IFITM3 strongly restricted IAV H1-, H5-, and H7(Shan)-mediated entry. native FL IFITM3 and 21 IFITM3 restrict IAVs. infected cells were harvested, fixed with formaldehyde, and analyzed by flow cytometry 48 hours after infection. the relative infectivity was determined as the percentage of GFP positive cells normalized to that of vector-transduced A549 cells. p0.03 indicates statistical significance (p0.03 by Student's t test) as compared with vector-transduced cells. stronger suppression of viral entry and replication was observed in cells treated with IFN. 21 IFITM3 suppressed IAV entry and replication, indicating that tyrosine 20 may not be a major determinant for IFITM-mediated restriction. tyrosine 20 of IFITM3 is functionally dispensable for IFITM-mediated IAV restriction. infected cells were harvested, fixed with formaldehyde, and analyzed by flow cytometry 48 hours after infection. expression of the indicated IFITM3 variants in A549 cells was detected by western blotting using the indicated antibodies. each panel represents at least two sets of experiments with similar results. flag-tagged 21 IFITM3, which mainly distributed to the plasma membrane, had the weakest effect on viral entry. however, endosome/lysosome-associated native 21 IFITM3 and Y20A IFITM3 might contribute to efficient inhibition of IAV infection. IFITM3 isoforms were fixed, permeabilized, and labeled with anti-LAMP2 (green) and anti-IFITM2/3 (red) and DAPI (blue) antibodies. cells were then imaged by confocal microscopy. native or epitope-tagged IFITM3 isoforms were used in different studies. epitope tags interfered with the function and subcellular distribution of IFITM3 isoforms. expression of FL IFITM3 and 21 IFITM3 was not well controlled in previous research. the association between IFITM3 rs12252-C polymorphism and the severity of influenza is currently controversial. the association between IFITM3 rs12252-C polymorphism and the severity of influenza is currently controversial. if future studies conclude that IFITM3 rs12252-C polymorphism is associated with the severity of influenza, further investigations into immune reactions of subjects expressing different IFITM3 isoforms. the same aliquots of cells used in (B) were analyzed by western blotting. the results are the averages of three independent infection replicates."}
