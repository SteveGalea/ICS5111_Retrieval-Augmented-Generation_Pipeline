{"summary": "severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus was identified as a novel member of the genus phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae family in china. the detailed clinical features of cases with SFTSV infection have not been well described. the risk factors for severity among patients and fatality among severe patients remain to be determined. a new infectious disease characterized by severe fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia and multiorgan dysfunction was identified as being caused by a novel member of the genus phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae family in china. SFTS has an average 12% case fatality rate and even 30% in some areas. previously published works assessed risk factors for death by univariate analysis. a suspected case of SFTSV infection was defined as an acutely ill person with acute onset of fever (38.0\u00b0C) and other symptoms (e.g. gastrointestinal symptoms, bleeding), epidemiological risk factors (being exposed to ticks or SFTS patients or being a farmer) a suspected case of SFTS was defined as those who met the criteria for having a suspected case of SFTS. failure, acute renal failure, encephalitis, shock, septicemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and death are defined using criteria recommended by the American\u2013European Consensus Conference on ARDS. acute renal failure is defined 50% increase in serum creatinine and receipt of inpatient acute dialysis. DIC was scored in accordance with the international Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis scoring system. the scoring system included platelet count (>100109 cells/L, 0; 100109 cells/L but >50109 cells/L, 1; and 50109 cells/L, 2); elevated fibrin-related marker (no increase, 0; moderate increase, 2; and strong increase, 3) (D-dimer was used); prolonged prothrombin time (3 patients were given albumin if serum albumin was less than 25 g/l. intravenous gamma-globulin (IVGG) was prescribed for cases with severe infection and encephalitis. a suspected case of SFTSV infection was defined as an acutely ill person with acute onset of fever (38.0\u00b0C) and other symptoms (e.g. gastrointestinal symptoms, bleeding), epidemiological risk factors (being exposed to ticks or SFTS patients or being a farmer) a suspected case of SFTS was defined as those who met the criteria for having a suspected case of SFTS. ALI and ARDS are defined using criteria recommended by the American\u2013European Consensus Conference on ARDS. acute renal failure is defined 50% increase in serum creatinine and receipt of acute dialysis. septic shock is defined as sepsis induced hypotension persisting despite adequate fluid resuscitation.

Table 9. Laboratory tests and clinical symptoms in fatal and non-fatal cases on admission. APTT was significantly longer among patients with severe disease in the confirmed cases. neutrophil count, platelet count, levels of total calcium, sodium, albumin and albumin globulin ratio were significantly lower among patients with severe disease. multivariate analysis of risk factors associated with disease severity in confirmed cases due to SFTSV infection. a cohort of 115 hospitalized patients with severe SFTS infection examined risk factors for disease severity and fatality among patients with severe SFTS. the mortality is similar to that in various studies. SFTS is mostly seen in endemic areas. incubation period for transmission through tick bite in most SFTS patients ranges from 5 days to 2 weeks. delay between tick bite and onset of symptoms in 3 of these 7 patients ranged from 2 to 3 weeks. there were no family cluster or person-to-person transmission of infections by SFTSV reported in this study. elevated AST/ALT ratio is not only associated with liver damage, but also with damage to other tissues, such as muscle, kidney, and pancreas. encephalitis was probably underestimated due to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, but further workup would be necessary to completely rule out encephalitis. most patients with hemorrhagic signs showed microscopic hematuria, fecal occult blood, occult blood in their vomitus and petechiae. the fatal outcome was associated with age, high serum AST levels, pronounced coagulation disturbances, and high levels of acute phase proteins. DIC score was ascertained among patients with severe disease. DIC was also an independent prognostic factor among patients with severe SFTS. hyponatremia is considered the most prominent change in serum electrolytes in Hantavirus infection. ribavirin is reported to be effective for treating CCHF infections and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. corticosteroids increase the risk of developing critical disease from viral infections. corticosteroids suppress the cytokine storm. the sample size is not large enough to investigate the association between survivors and fatalities among severe patients. this study in northeast china reveals that SFTSV infection may present with more severe symptoms and laboratory abnormalities than hitherto reported. a more helpful conclusion about the possible manifestations of SFTSV infection in hospitalized patients can be achieved."}
