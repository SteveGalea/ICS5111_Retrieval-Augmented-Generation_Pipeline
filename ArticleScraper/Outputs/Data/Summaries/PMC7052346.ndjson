{"summary": "critical care is an important component of health care systems around the world. the burden of critical illness in resource-limited settings is not well described, but the best available estimates suggest that it may be greater than in resource-limited settings. mortality for adults with sepsis is higher than in resource-rich settings. health care professionals from resource-rich and resource-limited settings should take a global perspective on critical care for both ethical and practical reasons. the burden of critical illness and its global variation are not well established, even by the Global Burden of Disease project [4,9,21,38]. population-based estimates of the burden of critical illness in resource-limited settings are lacking [9]. there is also limited data on ICU capacity in resource-limited settings [3,33,42], and only a few assessments are population based [12,43,44], precluding accurate national estimates of ICU capacity. most sub-saharan countries lack resources to implement all components of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, but local modification might allow the implementation of specific life-saving interventions. new trials may also inform appropriate modifications to guidelines; routine measurement of central venous pressure is no longer a recommendation in recent Surviving Sepsis guidelines [52] ICU mortality rates in resource-rich settings appear to be decreasing over the last decades [17,45] but this trend is related to case mix, organizational factors, and clinician practices that may be different or inapplicable in resource-limited settings. some patients in resource-limited settings who die of acute reversible illnesses can be assumed to be critically ill and would be offered treatment in an ICU, if it were available. local characteristics require that bundles and protocols developed in resource-rich countries be developed before implementation in resource-limited settings. ICU Organization The World Federation of Societies of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine (WFSICCM) developed a common framework describing critically ill patients and critical care service. the task force proposed a three-tiered system of categorizing ICUs into: 1) level 1 units, capable of providing oxygen, noninvasive monitoring, and more intensive nursing care than a regular ward. the WFSICCM guidelines also described training needs, roles, and responsibilities of critical care specialists [39] and the need for uniform training pathways to ensure minimal standards and competencies. the report recommends adoption of existing competency-based training frameworks, such as the Competency-Based Training in Intensive Care Medicine program in Europe (CoBaTrICE) NICST is a non-profit, international organization that provides training for critical care nurses [72,73] in Sri Lanka with a train-the-trainers approach. it is designed to respond to outbreaks of severe respiratory infections and has trained over 1000 intensive care unit doctors from 13 countries. CM uniform training recommendations for ICU specialists to ensure minimum standards and competencies necessary to practice effectively in their environment. a two-year fellowship program in pulmonary and critical care medicine hosted by the Tikur Anbessa (Black Lion) Teaching Hospital of Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia. it aims to increase capacity to 500 specialist-trained physicians within the seven years of its funding and includes critical care. interventions for early detection and treatment of critical illness could prevent multi-organ failure and death. early warning systems have been shown to be predictive in some [54] but not all settings. globally, ARDS remains under-recognized and under-treated [81]. a cluster randomized trial in 118 Brazilian ICUs compared routine care to a multi-faceted QI strategy that included a daily checklist, goal setting during multidisciplinary rounds, and clinician prompting for 11 care processes. a cluster randomized trial in 118 Brazilian ICUs compared routine care to a another multi-faceted QI strategy. public health organizations should work with the academic community to guide research priorities by taking into account the public health impact. a severe acute respiratory infection observational study is being conducted globally in collaboration with ISARIC, the International Forum of Acute Care Trialists and the Platform for European Preparedness Against (Re-)emerging Epidemics. clinical guidelines Until sufficient research from resource-limited settings drives locally generated clinical guidelines, adaptation of existing guidelines is essential. pilot study evaluating IMAI protocol for severe sepsis demonstrated increased sepsis recognition, greater volume of fluid resuscitation, and increased frequency of vital signs monitoring [105] decision-makers must accept high-quality, equitable intensive care services are necessary to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and health security [34,106] the global Intensive Care Working Group of the European Society of Critical Care Medicine has developed recommendations for infrastructure and ICU organization in resource-limited settings. the WFSICCM guidelines also described training needs, roles, and responsibilities of critical care specialists [39] and the need for uniform training pathways to ensure minimal standards and competencies. short, intensive course is widely available and free. target audience includes critical care physician trainees, critical care nurses, non-intensivist physicians, and allied health workers. dissemination has relied on a train-the-trainers approach, with cascade trainings within countries by local facilitators. research opportunities for research in epidemiology, diagnosis, therapeutics, and implementation of critical care resources in resource-limited settings are vast. research opportunities for research in epidemiology, diagnosis, therapeutics, and implementation of critical care resources in resource-limited settings are vast. early recognition and treatment of critical illness could prevent multi-organ failure and death. developing tools and interventions for early detection and treatment could ease burden on limited ICU resources. globally, ARDS remains under-recognized and under-treated [81] a cluster randomized trial in 118 Brazilian ICUs compared routine care to a multi-faceted QI strategy that included a daily checklist, goal setting during multidisciplinary rounds, and clinician prompting for 11 care processes. another ongoing project is testing a checklist for early recognition and treatment of acute illness (CERTAIN), a decision support tool for initial and follow-up management of critical illness syndromes. public health organizations should work with the academic community to guide research priorities by taking into account the public health impact. a severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) observational study is being conducted globally in collaboration with ISARIC, the International Forum of Acute Care Trialists and the Platform for European Preparedness Against (Re-)emerging Epidemics. early recognition and treatment of critical illness could prevent multi-organ failure and death and ease burden on limited ICU resources. early warning systems have been shown to be predictive in some [54] but not all settings [60,61]

of vital signs monitoring [105]. Strengthening health systems In resource-limited settings, decision-makers include local health authorities (often supported by the WHO), international donors, and NGOs. critical care education should be expanded in a uniform, sustainable fashion. research in resource-limited settings must take into account public health impact. authors have no competing interests to declare."}
