{"summary": "the matrix protein 2 (M2) is a tetrameric ion channel which is involved in virus uncoating in the endosome and in virus maturation in the trans-Golgi network. the matrix protein 2 (M2) fits the bill and has received considerable attention as a potential target against influenza infection over the past decades. passive immunisation is the treatment option of choice in situations where rapid protection is crucial. a number of M2 ectodomain (M2e)-specific antibodies have been reported to protect mice from a lethal challenge in a prophylactic setting. 334 M2e-specific human monoclonal antibodies were isolated by FACS. they were cloned using the M2e consensus peptide (M2e-cons) conjugated to virus-like particle Q as a bait. no M2e-specific antibodies could be found on the surface of BHK cells infected with the scFv- sublibrary. in total, 201 of the 255 wells showed signs of viral infection and were reanalyzed for M2e binding. the large number of specific antibodies isolated in a single screen illustrates the utility of mammalian cell display. the large number of specific antibodies isolated in a single screen illustrates the utility of mammalian cell display [33], but also makes it an attractive alternative to other methods. cloning of antibodies from single or amplified B cell clones. ELISA confirmed Fv-msFc-2c antibodies to M2e using supernatants from transiently transfected cells. the three antibodies were expressed at high levels, with yields of 20 to 40 mg per liter. these yields are in the same range as those previously reported for Q- and Nicotine-specific human antibodies. adapted H1N1 Influenza A PR/8/34 were stained with the indicated antibodies. a concentration-dependent staining of the cells showed that each of the antibodies is capable of recognizing cellular, native M2 protein. groups of mice were passively immunized i.p. with 500 g scFv-msFc-2c antibodies D005, E040 or F052, while a control group received the same amount of mouse IgG. two days later, animals were infected intranasally with a lethal dose (4 LD50) of mouse adapted (m.a.) influenza A/PR/8/34. lethal dose of m.a. influenza A/PR/8/34 monitored for 21 days. control mice succumbed to infection and all had to be euthanized due to severity of disease within less than two weeks after challenge. all animals that had received at least 20 g of D005 antibody survived challenge. antibody Z3G1 has been reported to show therapeutic activity in mice. but multiple injections of Z3G1 starting as early as 5 h after infection were required for full protection. antibody D005 compares favorably to this, since it was fully protective. mice treated with scFv-msFc-2c, 200 g hIgG1 or 200 g control human IgG (Ctr. Ab) were treated with 144 g scFv-msFc-2c, 200 g hIgG1 or 200 g control human IgG (Ctr. Ab) on day -2. body temperature (A), weight (B) and survival (C) were monitored. the resulting scFv- and scFv- sublibraries consisted of 1.0 106 and 1.1 106 independent transformants. each possible combination of heavy and light chain is covered multiple times by the 2 million clones. screening is likely to yield antibodies containing the natural heavy and light chain pairs. cFv- sublibrary contained a substantial fraction of M2e-reactive cells. three sorts were carried out with the scFv- library, two using Q-M2e-cons and one using RNase-M2e-cons as bait. single cells were sorted into wells containing BHK feeder cells. in total, 201 of the 255 wells showed signs of viral infection. two to three days after sorting, BHK cells in wells showing signs of viral infection were analyzed for binding to RNAse-M2e. nine representative samples are shown, including cells showing strong binding (D005, E040, F052), intermediate binding (D036, E012, F058), or no binding (D021, E016, F080). scFv antibodies were fused to the Fc region of mouse IgG2c (msFc-2c the scFv-msFc-2c antibodies were found to bind M2e-cons peptide with high affinity, with Kd values of 4-5 nM (Figure 2A). the scFv-msFc-2c antibodies were found to bind M2e-cons peptide with high affinity. a clone of L929 cells expressing full-length M2 was generated. the cells were stained with increasing concentrations of D005, E040 or F052. each of the antibodies is capable of recognizing cellular, native M2 protein. mice were treated with 500 g of the indicated antibody on day -2. mice were treated with decreasing amounts of scFv-msFc-2c D005 or 200 g of mouse IgG. two days later, animals were infected with a lethal dose of m.a. influenza A/PR/8/34 and monitored for 21 days. mice were infected with m.a. influenza A/PR/8/34 and treated with 200 g scFv-msFc-2c D005 on day -2. survival was monitored for 21 days. gG1-D005 was expressed at high levels in mammalian cells. mice were treated with equimolar amounts of IgG1-D005, scFv-D005-msFc-2c, or human IgG. mice were treated with a lethal dose of influenza A/PR/8/34. PBMC were isolated from 10 ml of heparinized blood by Ficoll gradient. PBMC were stained with: M2e coupled to Q in combination with a Alexa 647 nm-labeled Q-specific mouse mAb. FITC-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) cells displaying M2-specific scFv antibodies were isolated using Q-M2e. each cell was sorted into a well of a 24-well plate containing 50% confluent BHK feeder cells. each cell was sorted into a well of a 24-well plate containing 50% confluent BHK feeder cells. fully human 1 heavy chain and light chain coding regions were generated by total gene synthesis. expression vector pCB15 was transfected into HEK-293T cells. stable cells were enriched by selection in presence of 1 g/ml puromycin (Sigma) scFv-D005-msFc-2c, scFv-E040-msFc-2c or scFv-F052-msFc-2c were washed with wash buffer. scFv-D005-msFc-2c, scFv-E040-msFc-2c and scFv-F052-msFc-2c were then washed with wash buffer v-Fc2c fusion proteins were detected by a 1 h incubation at room temperature with a goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) the Kd values were determined as the EC50 of the ELISA signal as a function of the M2e-cons peptide concentration present in the solution binding reaction. mice were infected intranasally with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted (m.a PBMC were pre-incubated with Alexa 647 nm-labeled Q and human gamma globulin. stained with: M2e coupled to Q in combination with a Alexa 488 nm-labeled Q-specific mouse mAb, as well as the M2-specific mouse mAb 14C2 (Abcam) after staining, cells were washed and filtered. each cell was sorted into a well of a 24-well plate containing 50% confluent BHK feeder cells. Upon virus spread (2 days post sorting), the infected cells were tested by FACS analysis for M2-binding. scFv coding regions were PCR amplified from Sindbis virus-containing supernatants by RT-PCR. stable protein-expressing cells were enriched by selection in presence of 1 g/ml puromycin (Sigma) pools of resistant cells were maintained in serum-free medium on poly-L-Lysine coated dishes or in roller bottles for up to 3 weeks. both types of antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography over a protein A-Sepharose column. scFv-D005-msFc-2c, scFv-E040-msFc-2c or scFv-F052-msFc-2c were read at 450 nm on an ELISA reader. after 10 min the reaction was stopped with a 5% solution of H2SO4 in H2O2. after 2 h at room temperature, free antibody was detected by a classical ELISA. mice were infected intranasally with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted (m.a.) influenza A virus PR8 (4 LD50), followed by close monitoring of weight-loss and fever (twice daily at peak of infection) mice were bled in order to verify the presence of antibodies in the blood by ELISA."}
