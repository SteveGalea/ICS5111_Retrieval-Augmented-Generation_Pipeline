{"summary": "baculovirus type 2 is associated with post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome. it causes progressive weight loss, dyspnea, tachypnea, anemia, jaundice, and diarrhea in piglets. we used it to develop a novel candidate vaccine for a preventive or therapeutic strategy to control PCV2 infections. the recombinant baculovirus BV-GD-ORF2 is a potential vaccine against PCV2 infections. the baculovirus can enter mammalian cells and mediate expression of transgenes under a promoter that is active in mammalian cells. baculoviral vectors have been exploited as versatile vaccine vehicles to produce candidate vaccines against various pathogens. the baculoviruses has an amino-terminal signal peptide (SP), a mature transmembrane domain (TM) and a cytoplasmic tail domain (CTD) for the surface display of exogenous peptides, a heterologous peptide was inserted between the SP and mature domain of gp64. after its expression with the native gp64, the fusion protein is translocated to the plasma membrane and incorporated into the bac the first study to establish a PCV2 vaccine based on the baculovirus dual expression system. the recombinant baculovirus BV-GD-ORF2 was constructed as described in the Methods (Figure 1). the infection of Sf9 cells caused in extensive cell-cell fusion (Figure 2). the images were captured at 72 h posttransfection. a protein of an approximately 75 kDa protein (of the predicted size) was presented in lanes loaded with BV-GD-ORF2 or with BV-GD-ORF2-infected Sf9 cells. PK-15 cells were transfected with BV-GD-ORF2 and AcMNPV-WT. distinct fluorescent signals were detected in the BV-GD-ORF2-transduced cells but not in the cells transduced with AcMNPV-WT. BV-GD-ORF2 displays the PCV2 Cap protein on the viral envelope. mice were immunized intramuscularly with BV-GD-ORF, pc-ORF2, AcMNPV-WT or PBS. an identical booster immunization was given 3 weeks later. antibody levels were analyzed with a Cap-protein-specific ELISA. mean IFN- levels of 621 pg/ml or 112 pg/ml were detected in mice inoculated with 1 109 PFU of BV-GD-ORF2 or pc-ORF2 respectively. the difference between the two groups was significant (P 0.01). the ORF2 gene cassette consists of the gp64 signal sequence (SP), the ORF2 gene (ORF214\u2013234) fused to the N-terminus of the AcMNPV major envelope protein gp64 gene (gp6425\u2013517) and the poly(A) sequence. the poly(A) sequence was driven by a dual promoter containing the CMV immediate-early enhancer/promoter (pCMV-IE) baculovirus BV-GD-ORF2 or with BV-GD-ORF2-infected Sf9 cells. the presence of both VSV-G and PCV2 Cap protein does not reduce the displaying efficiency of Cap protein on baculovirus membrane. PK-15 cells were transfected with BV-GD-ORF2 (a) or AcMNPV-WT (b) at an MOI of 10, respectively. the bound antibodies were detected with FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG and observed with fluorescence microscopy (green). antibody levels were analyzed with a Cap-protein-specific ELISA (a) and a serum neutralization assay (b). all data are means SD. splenocytes from mice immunized with BV-GD-ORF2 showed a relatively high nonspecific IFN- response. the IFN- response in splenocytes harvested from immunized mice was measured by ELISA. splenocytes were isolated at 6 weeks after the primary immunization and stimulated with or without purified Cap protein. BV-GD-ORF2 possesses two gene cassettes: PP10 promoter-controlled VSV-G expression cassette and CMV immediate-early enhancer (CMV-IE) and PPH promoters-controlled PCV2 ORF2 expression cassette. previous studies have shown that the PCV2-neutralizing antibodies were correlated with the efficacy of protection against PCV2. the cap protein displayed on the envelope of BV-GD-ORF2 allows it to engage antigen-presenting cells and activate the ORF2-specific immune reactions via the major histocompatibility II (MHC-II)-mediated antigen-presentation pathway. unlike the DNA vaccine, the baculovirus can directly transduce the APCs resident in the muscle tissues and thus present antigen more efficiently to dendritic cells. intranasal immunization with baculovirus alone provided sufficient protection from lethal challenge with the H1N1 influenza virus. at present, at least four commercially available PCV2 vaccines, including subunit vaccines that express the Cap protein from baculovirus, inactivated PCV2 and a PCV1/PCV2 chimeric vaccine. the vaccine BV-GD-ORF2 is based on the baculovirus dual expression system. it displays the PCV2 Cap protein with the baculovirus envelope protein gp64 TM and CTD on the viral envelope. it also expresses it on transduced mammalian cells, thereby functioning as both a subunit vaccine and a DNA vaccine. Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9) were used to propagate the WT and recombinant baculoviruses. they were cultured in Grace\u2019s insect media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS at 27\u00b0C. the resultant pBac-GD-ORF2 plasmid thus contained the PCV2 ORF2 gene driven by the CMV-IE + PPH promoters. all procedures for the production of recombinant baculovirus BV-GD-ORF2 were performed according to the manufacturer's manual of Bac-to-Bac\u00ae Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen) mice were vaccinated intramuscularly twice at 3-week intervals with 109 PFU of BV-GD-ORF2, 109 PFU of AcMNPV wild-type (AcMNPV-WT) or 100 g of pc-ORF2. three mice from each group were killed for a cell-mediated immune assay. the presence of mouse IFN- was measured with a commercially available mouse IFN- ELISA kit (Biosourse, USA) the concentrations of mouse IFN- in the samples were determined from a standard curve. t-test was used to compare humoral and cell-mediated immune responses of the different groups. plasmid was amplified from PCV2 genomic DNA by PCR. a 2.1-kb fragment of the surf\u2013ORF2 fusion gene was excised from psurf\u2013ORF2 by digestion with NheI and HindIII. the resultant pBac-GD-ORF2 plasmid thus contained the PCV2 ORF2 gene driven by the CMV-IE + PPH promoters. the viral nucleocapsids, purified recombinant baculovirus and infected cell lysates in PBS (pH 7.4) were then mixed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 6.8], 0.1 M dithiothreitol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS] and 10% glycerol) the cells were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. three groups of mice (eight per group) were vaccinated intramuscularly twice at 3-week intervals with 109 PFU of BV-GD-ORF2, 109 PFU of AcMNPV wild-type (AcMNPV-WT) or 100 g of pc-ORF2. a fourth group was injected with 100 l of PBS and used as the control group.
