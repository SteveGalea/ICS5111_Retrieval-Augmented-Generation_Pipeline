{"summary": "acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in paediatric patients. early detection of the viral aetiologies of ARTIs is essential for patient management and infection control. xTAG RVP RVP Fast v2 assay revealed mixed infection caused by two or three respiratory viruses in 40 specimens. an estimated 1.9-million children died from ARTIs worldwide in 2000. most deaths recorded in africa and Southeast Asia. viral culture is recognised as the \u2018gold standard\u2019 for identification of viral pathogens. respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); influenza virus A, including subtypes H1, H3 and H1N1; influenza virus B; parainfluenza virus type 1\u20134 (PIV-1, -2, -3 and -4); adenovirus (AdV); human enterovirus/human rhinovirus (HEV/HRV); human metapneumovirus (HMPV); and human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E, NL63, ngeal swab samples were collected from 199 outpatients and patients admitted to the paediatric ward and intensive care unit of the University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), Kuala Lumpur, from November 2013 to august 2014. ARTIs included upper or lower respiratory tract infections. patients with longer duration of symptoms were excluded. all respiratory specimens were inoculated into Madin-Darby canine kidney (ATCC number CCL-34), rhesus monkey kidney (LLC-MK2; ATCC number CCL-7), human lung adenocarcinoma (A549; ATCC number CCL-185) cells were harvested, and IF staining was performed. xTAG RVP FAST v2 assay was performed according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. the amplification conditions were as follows: 50 \u00b0C for 20 min, initial denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 36 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 30 sec, annealing at 59 \u00b0C for 30 sec and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 30 sec. the PCR process was ended by a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 2 min. an ARTI was defined as a new illness occurring within the previous three weeks, associated with a runny nose, cough, fever and sore throat. ARTIs included upper or lower respiratory tract infections. patients with a longer duration of symptoms were excluded. xTAG RVP FAST v2 assay performed according to manufacturer's protocol. a total of 18 L of xTAG bacteriophage MS2 was spiked into 182 L of sample. cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification were conducted in a single-tube format. the PCR process was ended by a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 2 min. the mixture was incubated at 45 \u00b0C for 20 min in the Bio-Rad DNA Engine. Virus detection was performed using the xMAP instrument (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA) the majority of the respiratory specimens were positive according to the xTAG RVP FAST v2 assay. none of the specimens were positive for influenza A H1 subtype or HCoV NL63, HKU1 and 229E subtypes. no virus detected Based on the findings of the viral culture and xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay, the results of 57 specimens were incongruent (14 positive specimens and 43 negative specimens) according to the viral culture method, 14 specimens were positive: RSV (n = 7), AdV (n = 2), influenza A (n = 2), influenza B (n = 1) and PIV-2 (n = 1). Direct IF detected 45 positive specimens: RSV (n = 35), HMPV (n = 5), adenovirus, human rhinovirus, HBoV, human bocavirus, HBoV, human enterovirus, HBoV, human enterovirus. the xTAG RVP RVP Fast v2 assay detected respiratory viruses in all 111 direct IF-negative specimens. a total no. of specimens with respiratory viruses detected by xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay (%) Consistent (88, 44.2%) RSV (35) RSV (27) RSV/HRV/HEV (3) RSV/HBoV (2) RSV/AdV (2) RSV/PIV 4 (1) 35 (17.6) AdV (n influenza A (2) Influenza A H3 subtype (1) - 2 (1.0) Influenza A H1N1 subtype (1) HMPV (5) HMPV (4) HMPV/HRV/HEV (1) 5 (2.5) PIV-1 (1) - 1 (0.5) PIV-3 (1) - 1 (0.5) Negative (43) 43 (21.6) Inconsistent (111, 55.8%) Negative (111, 55.8%) Negative (111) HRV/HEV (59) HR xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay, direct IF and viral isolation methods detected 43 (21.6%), 35 (17.6%) and 7 (3.5%) RSV-positive specimens, respectively. diagnostic tests for HEV and HRV are not routinely performed in our laboratory unless requested by a clinician. xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay identified single virus infection in 116 (58.3%) of the 199 specimens. it detected three respiratory viruses (HRV/HEV, RSV and AdV) in one respiratory sample and two respiratory viruses in the other 39 samples. most cases of mixed infection were caused by HEV/HRV. the majority of multiple respiratory viral infections (92.5%, 37/40) were detected in children aged 5 years. the majority of ARTIs in developed countries have been reported to be caused by RSV, influenza viruses, PIV and AdV. the viability and low titre of respiratory viruses in specimens might explain the failure of conventional methods to detect respiratory viruses in xTAG RVP RVP Fast v2 assay-positive specimens. the ability of the xTAG RVP RVP Fast v2 assay to detect these viral pathogens, as well as PIV-4 and the influenza A H1N1 subtype. noh et al. (41) showed that the severity of clinical illness in patients with multiple viral agents was not markedly different from that of patients with a single viral agent. however, in some cases, respiratory viruses in co-infections have been reported to cause more severe illness than the viral pathogens responsible for the primary infection."}
