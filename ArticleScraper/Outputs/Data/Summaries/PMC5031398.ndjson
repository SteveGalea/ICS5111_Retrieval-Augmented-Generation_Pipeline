{"summary": "influenza viruses, Respiratory Syncytial viruses (RSV) and Parainfluenza viruses are identified as major viruses mostly responsible for ILI and pneumonia. however, practitioners cannot diagnose the infection without a biological test confirmation. these infections causes are identified in less than 50%. swabs collected by sentinel GPs from 2011 to 2012 are frozen at -80\u00b0C at the university hospital center (CHU) laboratory. each week, all GPs of the sentinel network were encouraged to collect a nasal swab from the first two patients who presented ILI since less than three days. multiplex analysis allows for rapid production of diagnostic results. it thus allows highlighted the possible presence of eighteen respiratory viruses and four bacteria in one reaction by melt curve analysis. random sampling was performed with Excel\u00ae using the anonymized surveillance database of the Cire OI. the sampling frame contained identification number of swabs assigned by Cire OI, laboratory identification number, sex, age, date of onset of symptoms, date of swab collection and result of influenza RT-PCR. two seasons were defined to identify possible seasonal trends in circulation of the viruses. winter season during weeks 23 to 39 between June and September. swabs result from a surveillance system that received regulatory approvals. identified pathogens in nasal swabs analyzed by multiplex PCR, R\u00e9union Island, 2011 and 2012. nine swabs revealed the presence of two viruses. only three were not found in any analyzed sample. a weekly description of samples was realized to study the distribution of respiratory pathogens in 2011 and 2012. results of biological analyses were compared with data of ILI consultations declared by sentinel GPs in 2011 and 2012. for each virus, bars represent the number of specimen detected. a retrospective study based on a sentinel GPs network showed that not only influenza viruses are responsible for ILI consultations. an important circulation of multiple pathogens was observed throughout the year, with 12 different types of pathogens identified in 2011 and 2012. 148 swabs initially negative for influenza because not previously tested for any other viruses, the study found an etiology for 95 swabs. only 53 swabs, representing 24% of the sample, remained without etiology with negative multiplex PCR results all along the year. this study highlighted an important circulation of multiple pathogens in R\u00e9union Island throughout the year. it shows that ILI is not specific to influenza and therefore it is essential to have biological results in order to establish the differential diagnosis."}
