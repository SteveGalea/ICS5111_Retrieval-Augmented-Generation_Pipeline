{"summary": "Burkholderia pseudomallei is a Gram-negative bacterium found in water and wet soils of endemic areas bordering the equator. the organism infects most mammals and causes the disease melioidosis in humans [1-10] melioidosis commonly affects the lungs. burkholderia mallei is a non-motile, host-adapted clone of B. pseudomallei. it causes the highly contagious zoonotic disease glanders, which affects horses, mules, and donkeys. disease progression and pathology in humans and horses are similar. the most commonly used surrogate to study B. pseudomallei and B. pseudomallei is the mouse. intranasal inoculation mimics the natural route of aerosol infection for human disease. intranasal inoculation results in a significant proportion of the inoculum remaining in the nasal passages. the aim of this study was to develop a non-invasive, rapid, reproducible, practical, and safe aerosol delivery method to study the pulmonary form of glanders and melioidosis in BALB/c mice. this model could then be used to investigate the pathogenesis of B. pseudomallei and B. mallei. mice were anesthetized by injecting 2, 2, 2 Tribromoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich\u00ae) intraperitoneally at a dose of 250 mg/kg. mice were placed on their back in a specially designed workstand inclined at an angle of 45\u00b0. a modified pediatric otoscope was then used to guide the blunt needle portion of a microSprayer\u00ae model I-1C (PennCenturyTM) inside the tracheal opening and between burkholderia pseudomallei and B. mallei bacteria used to inoculate mice were cultured on agar plates and suspended in Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) the bacterial suspensions were serially diluted and 100 L aliquots were immediately spread onto agar plates to determine the number of CFU present. bronchoalveolar lavage cells were collected and inspected by microscopy. the trachea of mice was exposed and an incision was made through the midline. sterile 0.9% saline was infused into the lungs and fluids were recovered by gentle suction. all samples were examined by a board-eligible veterinary clinical pathologist. images were captured using an Olympus DP71 camera and software. plasmid pELHisBoaA was sequenced to verify no mutations were introduced during PCR. -750 of B. pseudomallei 1026b BoaA joined to six N-terminal histidine residues. plasmid pELHisBPSL1631-BMA1027 and pELHisBPSS0908-BMAA1324 were amplified with primers P3 (5\u2019- CCC AAG CTT CAG CTT CAG -3\u2019; HindIII site underlined) and P6 (5\u2019- GGT TAAT TAA AGC plasmids pELHisBoaA, pELHisBPSL1631-BMA1027, and pELHisBPSS0908-BMAA1324 were introduced in the E. coli strain TUNERTM (EMD Millipore) for the purpose of overexpressing and purifying recombinant proteins. ELISA Duplicate wells of ImmulonTM 2HB plates were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 1 g of antigen. excess unbound antigen was removed by washing the wells with PBS+0.05% Tween 20. wells were then filled with PBS+0.05% Tween 20 containing 3% (wt/vol) dry milk and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. burkholderia pseudomallei strain 1026b [53] was grown on tryptic Soy Agar (TSA; BD DifcoTM) for 18 hours at 37\u00b0C prior to infection. blood, bronchoalveolar lavages, and tissue homogenates from mice infected with B. pseudomallei 1026b were plated on TSA containing 100 g/mL polymyxin B. mice were placed on their back in a specially designed workstand inclined at an angle of 45\u00b0. a fiber optic arm was placed over the front of the throat of suspended animals. a modified pediatric otoscope was then used to guide the blunt needle portion of a microSprayer\u00ae model I-1C (PennCenturyTM) inside the tracheal opening and between the vocal cords. animals were aseptically collected, homogenized with disposable tissue grinders (Fisherbrand\u00ae), serially diluted, and plated on agar medium to calculate bacterial loads. survival data was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) were processed within 1-2 hr of collection to insure cell morphology was maintained. aliquots were placed into wells of duplicate disposable sample concentrators. slides were removed from the cell concentrators, air-dried for 10-min. protein was generated with primers P1 (5\u2019- CGC CAC GTG AAT GGG ACC GTC AAC TCG -3\u2019; PmlI site underlined) and P2 (5\u2019- GGT TAA TTA AAG ATT AGT GAT CTT CAC GGG -3\u2019; PacI site underlined) plasmid pELHisBoaA corresponds to residue 25-750 of B. pseudomallei 1026b BoaA joined to lified with primers P3 (5\u2019- CCC AAG CTT CAG CTT TAC ACG CTC CAG -3\u2019; HindIII site underlined) and P4 (5\u2019- GGT TAAT TAA AGC AAC TGG CCG ACG TTG AC -3\u2019; PacI site underlined) and P6 (5\u2019- GGT TAA TTA AAG GGC GAG AAC GCC TAT GCC GGC -3\u2019; PacI site bacteria were pelleted, followed by treatment with the BugBuster\u00ae HT protein extraction reagent (EMD Millipore) supplemented with rLysozymeTM (EMD Millipore) protein concentrations were determined with a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit. d with PBS+0.05% Tween 20, 100 L of the SureBlueTM TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate (KPL) was added to wells. color development, indicative of antibody binding to antigen, was measured by determining the absorbance of well contents at a wavelength of 650 nm. the microSprayer\u00ae produces a mist of particles with a mean mass aerodynamic diameter of 8 M [63] because the aerosol is generated by pushing fluid through an atomizer located at the tip of the needle part of the device. the results of these experiments are shown in Figure 1A and demonstrate that the use of the MicroSprayer\u00ae does not adversely impact viability of the agents. panel A: Bacteria were suspended in PBS to optical density of 1X106 bacteria/mL. the MicroSprayer\u00ae was then used to deliver 50 L of bacterial suspensions into 1 mL of sterile PBS. results are expressed as the mean ( standard error) colony forming units (CFU) no statistically significant differences were noted. we determined the median lethal dose of B. pseudomallei 1026b and B. mallei ATCC23344. the value for strain ATCC23344 is consistent with published reports. LD50 of B. pseudomallei 1026b (Bp) and B. mallei ATCC23344 (Bm) after inoculation with the MicroSprayer\u00ae. the microSprayer\u00ae was used to deliver the indicated number of bacterial CFU into the lungs of mice. animals were then monitored for clinical signs of illness and morbidity. inoculating doses as low as 9 (B. pseudomallei 1026b, Figure 2A) and 22 (B. mallei ATCC23344, Figure 2D) organisms. mice were challenged with 102, 103 and 104 bacteria. bacterial loads in the lungs, spleen and blood were determined. bacterial numbers rose from 2X106 to nearly 108 organisms between 48 and 96-hr post-infection. a 100-fold reduction in CFU was measured during the same time period in mice inoculated with the equivalent of 0.1 LD50 of B. pseudomallei. burkholderia pseudomallei disseminated to the organ in greater numbers than B. mallei. between 24 and 72-hr, the number of viable B. mallei bacteria increased by 4 orders of magnitude for all 3 inocula. twenty-four hours after infection, the spleen of mice inoculated with 10 LD50 of B. pseudomallei were heavily colonized. burkholderia mallei was not recovered from the blood at 24-hr post-infection. the organism was first detected 48-hr post-infection in mice challenged with 10 LD50. bacterial loads peaked at 101 CFU/ml at 48-hr and no bacteria were cultured. bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) were collected from mice 72-hr post-challenge. the animals were infected with 102, 103 and 104 bacteria. control mice were inoculated with 50 L of sterile PBS. bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from control mice appeared normal. no inflammatory infiltrates were observed in these animals. degenerate neutrophils form in the presence of bacterial endotoxins. some lavage samples appeared hemorrhagic, as they possessed low to moderate numbers of erythrocytes and macrophages with intracellular RBCs. animals inoculated with 102 CFU displayed moderate bacterial numbers and degree of inflammation. the BALF from mice infected with 103 organisms demonstrated intermediate inflammation and bacterial burden. panel B shows a representative field of a sample from mouse infected with 104 B. mallei bacteria. large numbers of degenerate neutrophils (block arrows) and foamy macrophages are seen admixed with cellular debris and occasional red blood cells. medium-sized bacilli are seen phagocytosed by neutrophils (asterisk) serum samples were serially diluted and placed in duplicate wells of plates coated with CPS (panel A), OPS (panel B), His-tagged BoaA (panel C), BPSL1631-BMA1027 (panel D), and His-tagged BPSS0908-BMAA1324 (panel E). y-axis represents serial two-fold dilutions of sera starting at 1:100 to 1:12,800. the horse is the natural host and reservoir for B. mallei. sera from horses with experimental glanders were also shown to contain high antibody titers. the latter also elicits a robust antibody response in human melioidosis patients. microSprayer\u00ae produces a mist of particles with a mean mass aerodynamic diameter of 8 M [63] because the aerosol is generated by pushing fluid through an atomizer located at the tip of the needle part of the device. we tested whether this procedure affects the viability of B. pseudomallei and/or B. mallei. panel A: Bacteria were suspended in PBS to optical density of 1X106 bacteria/mL, serially diluted, and plated onto agar medium. results are expressed as the mean ( standard error) colony forming units (CFU) these experiments were performed in triplicate on at least 2 separate occasions. the median lethal dose of B. pseudomallei 1026b and B. mallei ATCC23344 was determined by the method of Reed and Muench. the calculated LD50 for the agents are 5,100 820 (B. pseudomallei 1026b) and 818 173 CFU (B. mallei ATCC23344) the value for strain is consistent with published reports utilizing alternative aerosol delivery methods. LD50 of B. pseudomallei 1026b (Bp) and B. mallei ATCC23344 (Bm) after inoculation with the MicroSprayer\u00ae. the microSprayer\u00ae was used to deliver the indicated number of bacterial CFU into the lungs of BALB/c mice. animals were then monitored for clinical signs of illness and morbidity. ating doses as low as 9 (B. pseudomallei 1026b, Figure 2A) and 22 (B. mallei ATCC23344, Figure 2D) organisms. mice were challenged with 102, 103 and 104 bacteria, which correspond to roughly 0.1, 1 and 10 LD50. animals were sacrificed at four different time points post-challenge. bacterial numbers rose from 2X106 to nearly 108 organisms between 48 and 96-hr post-infection. a 100-fold reduction in CFU was measured during the same time period in mice inoculated with the equivalent of 0.1 LD50 of B. pseudomallei. burkholderia pseudomallei disseminated to the organ in greater numbers than B. mallei. between 24 and 72-hr, the number of viable B. mallei bacteria increased by 4 orders of magnitude for all 3 inocula. twenty-four hours after infection, the spleen of mice inoculated with 10 LD50 were heavily colonized and the agent continued to proliferate. bacteria in blood continue to rise and reach 101 CFU/ml at 48-hr. burkholderia mallei was not recovered from the blood at 24-hr post-infection. the organism was first detected 48-hr post-infection in mice challenged with 10 LD50. bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) were collected from mice 72-hr post-challenge. the animals were infected with 102, 103 and 104 bacteria. control mice were inoculated with 50 L of sterile PBS using the microSprayer\u00ae. bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from control mice appeared normal. no inflammatory infiltrates were observed in these animals. degenerate neutrophils form in the presence of bacterial endotoxins like LPS. some lavage samples appeared hemorrhagic, as they possessed low to moderate numbers of erythrocytes and macrophages with intracellular RBCs. animals inoculated with 102 CFU displayed moderate bacterial numbers and degree of inflammation. the BALF from mice infected with 103 organisms demonstrated intermediate inflammation and bacterial burden. panel B shows a representative field of a sample from a mouse infected with 104 B. mallei bacteria. large numbers of degenerate neutrophils (block arrows) and foamy macrophages (arrows) are seen admixed with cellular debris and occasional red blood cells. serum samples were serially diluted and placed in duplicate wells of plates coated with CPS (panel A), OPS (panel B), His-tagged BoaA (panel C), BPSL1631-BMA1027 (panel D) and BPSS0908-BMAA1324 (panel E) the y-axis represents serial two-fold dilutions of sera starting at 1:100 to 1:12,800. the horse is the natural host and reservoir for B. mallei and arguably the most relevant surrogate to study glanders. sera from horses with experimental glanders were also shown to contain high antibody titers against the predicted autotransporter proteins BPSL1631-BMA1027 and BPSS0908-BMAA1324 [83]. Interestingly, the latter also elicits a robust antibody response in human melioidosis patients [84]. the microSprayer\u00ae delivery platform uses small volumes and accurately delivers a known number of bacteria directly into the lungs. the device uses small volumes and accurately delivers a known number of bacteria directly into the lungs (Figures 1 and 2)."}
