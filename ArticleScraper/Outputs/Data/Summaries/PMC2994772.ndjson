{"summary": "the novel influenza A pandemic virus (H1N1pdm) caused considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide in 2009. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical course, duration of viral shedding, H1N1pdm evolution and emergence of antiviral resistance in hospitalized cancer patients. atypical clinical presentation of influenza infections in cancer patients delays clinical suspicion, antiviral treatment and adequate prevention of viral transmission. atypical clinical presentation of influenza infections in cancer patients is a major challenge for clinical management in this population [12], [13], [14] and prolonged viral shedding, as has been reported for an H3N2 seasonal virus. 44 hospitalized cancer patients with a suspected influenza infection were screened. 24 patients had a confirmed influenza A diagnosis using a rapid indirect immunofluorescence (RT-PCR) test or real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR). the remaining four patients were positive for influenza A using IFI only. the median duration of neutropenia after the onset of viral disease was two days. all patients that presented neutropenia received G-CSF until normalization of neutrophil counts. the overall mortality in our cohort was around 21% (n = 5), and four patients (n = 16.6%) had at least one comorbidity besides cancer. a total of 23 (95.8%) patients were treated with oseltamivir. one patient that died due to severe acute respiratory failure 24 h after clinical suspicion of H1N1pdm infection never received antiviral treatment. hypoxemia was frequent, and median PaO2/FiO2 on first arterial blood gas evaluation was 192 mmHg. Intensive care unit admission Overall, 13 patients (five adults and eight children) were admitted to the ICU. six patients were directly admitted from the emergency department and the other seven were transferred from other hospital wards. the duration of viral shedding was considered to be the time frame from the initial symptoms to the last H1N1pdm-confirmed sample. five (50%) patients in this group showed viral shedding for at least 11 days during oseltamivir treatment. the median duration of H1N1pdm shedding was 23 days, followed by 44 days for another patient. strain 5645s2/09 and 5645s3/09 clustered together and displayed a relatively large branch length from other H1N1pdm viruses. strain 5645s2/09 diverged from CA/04 in amino acid residues L52S, L70P, P100S, C153L, T214A, Q293R and I321V. oseltamivir carboxylate IC50 values were measured for 15 H1N1pdm samples isolated from 13 patients. the isolates with high IC50 values were endowed with a neuraminidase activity that was cross-resistant to oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir. 44 hospitalized cancer patients with a suspected influenza infection were screened. 24 patients had a confirmed influenza A diagnosis using a rapid indirect immunofluorescence test or real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR). the remaining four patients were positive for influenza A using IFI only. a total of 14 patients (58.3%) presented febrile neutropenia (500 neutrophils/mm3) at the time H1N1pdm was diagnosed. the median duration of neutropenia after the onset of viral disease was two days (ranging from one to six days; Table S5) a total of 23 (95.8%) patients were treated with oseltamivir. a total of 11 (47.8%) patients received oseltamivir for more than seven days. six patients received this antiviral within 48 h of clinical suspicion. all patients were treated with broad-spectrum intravenous antimicrobial agents to combat community-acquired pneumonia and/or febrile neutropenia [18], and five (20.8%) had concomitant positive cultures. hypoxemia was frequent, and the median PaO2/FiO2 on the first arterial blood gas evaluation was 192 mmHg. the duration of viral shedding was considered to be the time frame from the initial symptoms to the last H1N1pdm-confirmed sample. five (50%) patients in this group showed viral shedding for at least 11 days during oseltamivir treatment. the median duration of H1N1pdm shedding was 23 days (ranging from 11 to 63 days) no significant divergence was found in the H1N1pdm isolates collected from patients with prolonged shedding. we sequenced two consecutive samples from a single individual (5645s2/09 and 5645s3/09) and compared their HA sequences to other H1N1pdm viruses from mild, severe and fatal cases from different countries. isolates with high IC50 values were endowed with a neuraminidase (NA) activity that was cross-resistant to oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir. the isolates with high IC50 values were endowed with a phenotype resistant to NAIs. a cohort of hospitalized cancer patients with severe H1N1pdm infections presented high mortality, prolonged viral shedding and H1N1pdm evolution without the emergence of oseltamivir resistance. this is the first study to address viral shedding and resistance in cancer patients with severe H1N1pdm infections. 58.3% of patients with febrile neutropenia were identified as H1N1pdm cases. this is a condition that is not usually investigated in this scenario. however, 14 patients (58.3%) with febrile neutropenia were identified as H1N1pdm. we compared the maximum periods of shedding among these different populations and the number of patients that secreted the virus for more than seven days. in households in Hong Kong [31] and Canada [34], the maximum periods of H1N1pdm shedding ranged from 8 to 11 days. these periods were not different from what was observed with military cadets [22] and during the containment phase of the pandemics in Vietnam [23]. in HIV-1-infected individuals, co-infection with the H1N1pdm virus might lead to an outcome not different from the one expected for immunocompetent subjects. a similar conclusion was also drawn for transplant recipient individuals whose longest periods of viral shedding did not exceed 11 days [32].
