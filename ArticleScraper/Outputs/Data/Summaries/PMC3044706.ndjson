{"summary": "the strongest predictor of funding, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), explained only 39% of the variance in funding. the IOM recommended greater consideration of disease burden. a landmark study comparing disease burden to NIH funding levels was published in 1999 [5] for 29 common conditions, the study examined a variety of measures of societal burden. disease incidence and prevalence were unrelated to funding, while mortality and years of life lost (YLLs) weakly correlated with funding. a cross-sectional study compared measures of american and world disease burden and sociopolitical factors from 2004 to NIH funding levels in 2006. the study design was modeled on methods previously established [5], which used 1994 burden data and 1996 NIH funding to reflect an expected lag in availability of data on disease burden. each disease was defined using pre-specified sets of ICD-9) codes. 3) 1875 (11) 53 (10) 488 (8) 684 (12) Dementia 643 (5.4) 714 (10) 3108 (8) 132 (5) 306 (11) 1359 (8) Alcohol abuse 511 (4.3) 2641 (6) 9553 (4) 8 (17) 121 (16) 1837 (4) Dental and oral disorders 413 (3.5) 109774 (1) 41152 (1) 0 2 (27) 267 (18) Cirrhosis 408 (3.4) 43 (22) 303 (21) data denoting disease burden were collected from multiple sources. estimates of incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years lost, and years-of-life-lost are total annual counts, in 1000s, for North America. YLLs for each disease were calculated by totaling the differences between life expectancy and age at death. DALYs were estimated based on YLL and on standardized weighting schemes for disability applied to those surviving with disease [6], [7]. the relationship between 2006 NIH funding levels and 2004 US disease burden metrics was designated the a priori primary analysis. all predictor and outcome variables were log-transformed to reduce positive skew. the actual and expected funding levels for 1996 were inflated to 2006 dollars [29] NIH funding for disease categories was obtained directly from the NIH for the year 2006 (Table 1). these estimates were annually consolidated from figures supplied by individual NIH Institutes and Centers (http://www.nih.gov/news/fundingresearchareas.htm) Ischemic heart disease 398 (3.3) 1336 (7) 2347 (10) 531 (1) 2695 (2) 3048 (3) Schizophrenia 364 (3.1) 42 (23) 1561 (13) 1 (24) 5 (25) 522 (15) Injuries 355 (3.0) 3747 (5) 241 (23) 182 (2) 3448 (1) 4484 (2) Pneumonia 351 (3.0) 4178 (4) 75 (27) 68 (9) 294 (12) 315 (17) Prostate cancer 3 data denoting disease burden were collected from multiple sources. estimates of incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years lost, and years-of-life-lost are total annual counts, in 1000s, for North America. the number of hospital discharges, total length of stay, and mean hospital charges for disease-specific principal diagnoses were derived from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) in both NIS and NHAMCS, community hospitals were defined as non-federal, short-stay hospitals [20], [20]. public interest could influence funding levels through lobbying efforts, additional funding support from private foundations, or directly stimulating the interest of investigators. the actual and expected funding levels for 1996 were inflated to 2006 dollars [29] to account for inflation, the actual and expected funding levels for 1996 were inflated to 2006 dollars [29] to account for inflation, the actual and expected funding levels for 1996 were inflated to 2006 dollars [29]. NIH funding was most strongly associated with burden of disease measured in DALYs. YLLs (p = 0.003), inpatient hospital discharges (p = 0.05) and total hospital days (p = 0.02) were also associated with funding levels. only 33% of NIH funding variance was explained in 2006 compared to 39% in 1996. depression received the least funding compared to expected, and AIDS the most. depression, injuries, and COPD received the least funding. 357(3) 554(5) Pneumonia 52(6) 27 (21) 154 (27) 270 (27) Peptic ulcer disease 46(7) 105 (14) 75 (14) 18 (19) Lung cancer 46(8) 364 (5) 328 (4) 1358 (1) Schizophrenia 37(9) 44 (18) 129 (24) 94 (24) Ischemic heart disease 30(10) 490 (4) 731 (1) 721 (4) Uterine cancer 29(11) 146 (10) 94 (13) 111 (15) dementia 183 (26) 18 (19) 159 (11) 524 (6) Diabetes mellitus 197(27) 390 (28) 160 (28) 382 (28) Breast cancer 346 (28) 258 (26) 92 (21) 39 (20) AIDS 1664 (29) 2474 (29) 2306 (29) 1835 (29) charity revenue for a given disease in 2006 (p = 0.04) was also predictive of funding. a constrained multivariable model required an intercept of zero-zero to impose a requirement that conditions with no burden received no funding. expected funding amounts were generally similar to those found with the unconstrained multivariable model. we performed sensitivity analyses with global measures and future projections. mortality (p = 0.05) and DALYs (p = 0.001) were predictive of funding in univariate analyses. but only DALYs were retained in all the multivariable models. it is unclear why particular conditions remain under- or overfunded relative to disease burden. the difficulty of attributing basic science research to individual diseases complicates implementation of any disease-based allocation process. AIDS funding remained greater than predicted even when worldwide and projected burden were considered. the relative funding increase for perinatal conditions appears primarily due to a 55% reduction in associated DALYs over the last decade. lack of improvement in alignment between funding and disease burden may not indicate neglect of the 1998 IOM recommendations by the NIH. the NIH has recently taken steps to integrate more effectively the IOM priorities. planning, and strategic initiatives (DPCPSI) was established for identifying scientific opportunities, public health challenges, and scientific knowledge gaps. in 2009, a more consistent and transparent system for the tracking of disease-based funding was launched. $400 million will be dedicated to comparative effectiveness research that specifically evaluates the effects of clinical management on comprehensive public health outcomes such as mortality, morbidity, and quality of life. the WHO GBD are uncertain due to incompleteness and bias. but these estimates are the best available and are particularly accurate for the US. a lack of clear alignment with measures of disease burden could encourage special interests to further erode the scientific independence of NIH.
