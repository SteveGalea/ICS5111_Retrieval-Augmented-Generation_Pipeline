{"summary": "the world health organization declared a global influenza pandemic in 2009 when the influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus spread rapidly worldwide [1] in Korea, 740,835 patients were confirmed to have pandemic in 2009 and 225 died [2,3] during the pandemic period, some patients were hospitalized in intensive care units (ICU) because of influenza-associated pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). data were collected from all consecutive patients from November 2009 to February 2010 and from November 2015 to March 2016. 57 critically ill patients of Samsung Medical Center and Asan Medical Center in the database included 34 patients with H1N1 acute respiratory failure. this study included 34 patients with H1N1 acute respiratory failure. data were compared by the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and by the Pearson\u2019s exact test for categorical variables. data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 23.0 (Armonk, NY, USA) 57 critically ill patients of Samsung Medical Center and Asan Medical Center in the database included 34 patients with H1N1 acute respiratory failure. this retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of Samsung Medical Center (IRB application no. 2016-07-137) and Asan Medical Center (IRB application no. 2018\u20130224) patient information was anonymized and de-identified before analysis. data are presented as the median and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables and as frequency (percentage) for categorical variables. data were compared by the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and by the Pearson\u2019s chi-square test. solid organ malignancies were less frequently observed in patients in 2016 than in those in 2009. peramivir was more frequently used in patients diagnosed in 2016 than in those diagnosed in 2009 (93% versus 41%, P = 0.047) six (21%) patients in 2016 and 15 (44%) in 2009 received CRRT. among 15 patients in 2009, four had chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis. four had chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis and two had acute kidney injury without underlying chronic kidney disease. 4 (14) 5 (15) 1.0 Nitric oxide 3 (11) 7 (21) 0.490 CRRT 6 (21)a 15 (44)b 0.060 CRRT in acute kidney injury 2 (7) 9 (27) 0.092 ECMO 6 (21) 5 (15) 0.523 Length of MV, days 7 (4\u201319) 6 (3\u201317) 0.571 Length of hospital stay, days 10 (7\u201328) 8 (5\u201314) 0.210 Length of hospital stay, days 20 ( 0.17; 95% CI, 0.04\u20130.81, P = 0.025) and prone positioning (HR, 7.52; 95% CI, 1.37\u201341.40, P = 0.025) were significantly associated with mortality. univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards model cumulative survival curve for patients with H1N1 acute respiratory failure each year. a Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine whether treatment year was associated with in-hospital mortality. the initial clinical variables entered in the model included age, sex, body mass index, year, diabetes mellitus, current or previous solid organ malignancy, neuromuscular blockers, prone positioning, nitric oxide, and CRRT in acute kidney injury.
