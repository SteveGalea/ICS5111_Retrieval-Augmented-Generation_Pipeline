{"summary": "two members of swine enteric coronaviruses have emerged as major causative agents of lethal watery diarrhea in piglets. PEDV and PDCoV are classified in distinct genera in the family Coronaviridae, as an Alphacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus, respectively (1, 2). TGEV, also an enteropathogenic porcine alphacoronavirus, used to be responsible for severe economic losses around the globe in the 1990s. clinical severity of PDCoV tends to be lower than PEDV, with a mortality rate of around 40% when experimentally inoculated into gnotobiotic suckling piglets. PDCoV is emerging pathogen that warrants further study. innate immunity functions as the first line of defense against invading viruses. soluble antiviral components are made up of type I and III IFNs, chemokines, and proinflammatory cytokines. PEDV and PDCoV need to evolve mechanisms to antagonize and suppress its induction and signaling in order to establish productive infection. innate immune cells such as natural killer cells are also known to respond to porcine coronavirus infections. both PEDV and PDCoV are enveloped viruses with single-stranded positive-sense RNA genomes of 28 and 26 kB in length. so far seven encoded proteins have been shown to implicate in the innate immune modulation. PDCoV genome encodes non-structural (NS)6, NS7, and NS7a accessory protein (30, 31) coronavirus accessory proteins possess diverse functions, including modulating viral pathogenicity (33), inducing cell death (34), or antagonizing the IFN system (35\u201337). porcine coronaviruses bind to surface receptors on susceptible cells, primarily villous epithelial cells of the small intestine brush border. infected villous enterocytes of porcine GI tract are destroyed. a productive infection requires both penetrating the heavily guarded mucosal barriers and circumventing the host\u2019s robust and rapid innate immune response. the lack of suitable cell lines is one of the major obstacles to progress in the field. cell lines such as MARC-145 (African green monkey kidney), LLC-PK1 (porcine kidney) and ST (swine testicle) may be more appropriate for studying PEDV-mediated innate immune modulation. PDCoV-infected LLC-PK1 and ST cells become enlarged and rounded. at 2 days post-inoculation, PDCoV-infected cells become enlarged and rounded. the presence of trypsin in maintenance media helps to improve PDCoV propagation. a new cell line, IPEC-DQ, was thus sub-cloned and characterized for PEDV propagation (74). a number of cellular pathways regulating IFN-stimulated genes and antiviral defense are closely linked to cellular tumor suppression activity, including anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, and pro-inflammatory responses. porcine IEC-derived immortalized cell lines remain the optimal in vitro models for studying the innate immune response to PEDV and PDCoV infection. this first line of defense prevents establishment of successful infection and systemic spread, and in many cases destroys invading viruses even before the adaptive arm of host immunity is mobilized. infected host cells can sense the presence of both viruses and viral products by three main classes of host PRRs (77) these are the endosomal toll-like receptors (TLRs), the cytoplasmic retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and the nucleo-oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (TLRS) are found both in the endosomal and cell surface membranes three types of RLRs have been identified. retinoic acid-induced gene I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP-2) are most associated with recognition of bacterial PAMPs. associated tyrosine kinases, Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) phosphorylate the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 (85) the phosphorylated STAT1/STAT2 heterodimer then translocates into the nucleus, where it interacts with IRF9 to form IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (IS IFN- is known to be critical in controlling infection of epithelial cells by various enteric viruses, including norovirus, reovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, and murine cytomegalovirus. selective expression of IFNLRs on IECs in the GI tract argues for the indispensable contribution of type III IFNs to the initiation of early antiviral responses in this organ. PEDV- and PDCoV-encoded proteins modulate components of the IFN induction pathways. innate immune cells present foreign antigens to T cells and prime adaptive immune responses via cytokine secretion. innate immune cells also present foreign antigens to T cells. immature Mo-DCs up-regulated CD1a, CD80/86, and SLA-II-DR. infection activated transcription of type I IFN and chemokine interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) a recent study implicated porcine bone marrow-derived DCs in the dissemination of PEDV. PEDV could enter porcine nasal epithelial cells (NECs) via their apical side adjacent to the nasal mucosa and establish transient infection within the nasal cavity. despite lack of active viral replication in these DCs, these virus-loaded DCs could subsequently transfer the viruses to T cells which then enter peripheral blood. suckling and weaned pigs have drastically lower NK cell numbers than weaned pigs in both the blood and the ileum. NK cells in the blood were found to be higher than in the ileum, the primary site of PEDV infection. Xu et al. described DV N as a virus-derived intermediate responsible for triggering the NF-B pathway activation. the exact mechanism of MAPK activation following PEDV infection is still not determined. nsp1 Nsp1 is only present in alpha- and betacoronaviruses (2, 137) PEDV nsp1 is a potent IFN antagonist interfering with type I and III IFNs. these effects occur through either enhancing degradation of or inhibiting nuclear translocation of host key signaling molecules involved in IFN gene activation. PEDV nsp1 promotes proteasome-mediated degradation of CBP. IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines argue for the antiviral potential of these cytokines during the early stage of PEDV infection. PEDV nsp1 also modulates type III IFN responses in IECs (74) PLpro domain interferes with RIG-I- and STING-mediated type I IFN activation (148) similar to RIG-I, ubiquitination of STING is critical for expression of downstream antiviral genes (150, 151) PEDV PLP2-mediated de-ubiquitination of RIG-I and STING leads to abrogation of downstream signaling. nsp5 of both PEDV and PDCoV target the glutamine 231 (Q231) of NEMO. nsp5 proteolytic cleavage of NEMO is highly conserved and specific in both coronaviruses. this is in contrast to cleavage of NEMO by 3C or 3C-like proteases of other viruses. PEDV infection-induced STAT1 degradation relies on the ubiquitin-proteasome system. however, it remains to be seen whether any PEDV proteins are the main culprits. emerging studies have begun to shed light on the interplay between these accessory proteins and the host innate immune system. NS6, NS7, and NS7a have been identified for PDCoV. function of these proteins in viral replication, pathogenesis, and immune regulation remain mostly unclear. NS6 acts by blocking recognition or binding of dsRNA by RIG-I or MDA5. Xu et al. demonstrated that PEDV (both live and killed) through direct interaction between the S protein and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), induced EGFR activation which, in turn, augmented PEDV infection. they further demonstrated that, by acting via one of its downstream signaling pathways, the EGFR activation helped to enhance, and facilitate PEDV replication. PEDV M Unlike the E protein, PEDV M is equally distributed throughout the whole cell instead of being localized mainly in the ER (179). compared to overexpression of PEDV structural E protein, PEDV M altered IEC growth and cell cycle arrest in the S-phase. enhanced NF-B signaling is thought to be mediated through the immunodominant central region of N. PEDV N inhibits IFN- production and ISG expression by competing with IRF3 for TBK1 binding. coronavirus nsps have been shown to be involved mainly in viral RNA synthesis. nsp1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 15, and 16 have been observed to play additional roles in host immune modulatory functions (50, 60, 128\u2013136) PEDV nsp1 is also known to impede nuclear translocation of NF-B. this occurs through inhibition of IB phosphorylation and its subsequent ubiquitin-mediated degradation. activity of nsp1 against IB was also found to block nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of NF-B. PEDV interference with the type III IFN pathway should pave the way for future studies elucidating the as-yet underappreciated role for IFN- in the control of porcine enteritis coronavirus infection. this intriguing insight into PEDV interference with the type III IFN pathway should pave the way for future studies. PDCoV nsp5 disrupts type I IFN signaling by cleaving a critical adaptor protein, the NF-B essential modulator. highly conserved histidine 41 (His41) and cysteine 144 (Cys144) of PEDV nsp5 were identified as the catalytic dyad responsible for protease activity of nsp5. PDCoV nsp5 cleaves STAT2, one of the components of ISGF3. it disrupts the function of the ISGF3 complex in initiating the ISG-mediated antiviral state. nsp1 is only present in alpha- and betacoronaviruses (2, 137) PEDV nsp1 promotes proteasome-mediated degradation of CBP. nsp1 is also known to impede nuclear translocation of NF-B. PEDV nsp1-mediated inhibition of type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines argue for the antiviral potential of these cytokines during the early stage of PEDV infection. nsp1 also modulates type III IFN responses in IECs (74) PEDV PLpro domain, PLP2, interferes with type I IFN activation (148) by de-ubiquitinating activity, preventing post-translational modification of RIG-I. ubiquitination of STING is critical for expression of downstream antiviral genes (150, 151) nsp5 of both PEDV and PDCoV target the glutamine 231 (Q231) of NEMO. nsp5 proteolytic cleavage of NEMO is highly conserved and specific in both coronaviruses. this is in contrast to cleavage of NEMO by 3C or 3C-like proteases of other viruses. PEDV infection-induced STAT1 degradation relies on the ubiquitin-proteasome system. however, it remains to be seen whether any PEDV proteins are the main culprits. studies have begun to shed light on the interplay between these accessory proteins and the host innate immune system. PDCoV accessory proteins NS6, NS7, and NS7a have been identified. function of these proteins in viral replication, pathogenesis, and immune regulation remain mostly unclear. NS6 acts by blocking recognition or binding of dsRNA by RIG-I or MDA5. PEDV E PEDV E protein is a small 7-kDa membrane protein encoded by the E gene which is located downstream of PEDV ORF1a and ORF1b. the protein plays an important role during coronavirus budding (29) PEDV M Unlike the E protein, PEDV M is equally distributed throughout the whole cell instead of being localized mainly in the ER (179). compared to overexpression of PEDV structural E protein, PEDV M altered IEC growth and cell cycle arrest in the S-phase. enhanced NF-B signaling is thought to be mediated through the immunodominant central region of N. PEDV N inhibits IFN- production and ISG expression by competing with IRF3 for TBK1 binding. a recent study by Yang et al. revealed the newly discovered role of the PEDV S protein in the impairment of the anti-PEDV activity of type I IFN. the role of the PEDV S protein in the impairment of the anti-PEDV activity of type I IFN (180) t al. demonstrated that the E protein could induce ER stress in transfected cells through up-regulation of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), a marker of ER stress, and activation of NF-B. they also speculated that E protein-mediated activation of NF-B, in turn, would up-regulate expression of the neutrophil chemotactic factor IL-8. PEDV M is equally distributed throughout the whole cell instead of being localized mainly in Xu et al. and cao et al. recently elucidated a possible mechanism for NF-B activation. they demonstrated that over-expressing PEDV N protein in IECs mediated NF-B activation through TLR2, TLR3 and TLR9 pathways dramatically blocked PEDV-induced NF-B activation. this molecular mechanism is distinct from IFN suppression mediated by the N proteins of other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, where N blocks an early step in IFN- production, probably sensor recognition of viral RNA (191) and MHV, where N targets RNase L activity (192). the discrepancies observed with the effects of PEDV N on IFN- and NF-B induction. pDCs were identified as the major source of type I IFN when induced through TLR-7 stimulation. rapid type I IFN production in pDCs was observed following infection with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a betacoronavirus. the presence of functional type I IFN-producing pDCs in swine GI tracts during exposure to PEDV and PDCoV may help to restrict replication of these viruses. several groups of investigators have demonstrated the use of adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vector-mediated ectopic expression of porcine IFNs or a constitutively active fusion protein of porcine IRF3 and IRF7 [poIRF7/3(5D)] for rapid cross protection against foot-and-mouth disease virus. disruption or mutation of the SARS-CoV E gene has been a strategy used to generate promising live attenuated SARS-CoV vaccines. a TGEV strain with a deleted E gene (TGEV-E) was also put forth as a potential vaccine candidate, demonstrating the ability to target mucosal tissue and induce secretory immunity (205). the most common in vitro cell culture systems used to study these viruses are not derived from porcine IECs. more in-depth study of PEDV and PDCoV pathogenesis in vivo will provide less biased data to identify novel host innate immune modulators in the context of viral infection. the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
