{"summary": "134 nasopharyngeal swabs samples of children 15 years of age with ARI hospitalized were selected based on clinical diagnosis of asthma or pneumonia. the virome and bacteriome were characterized using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). acute asthma exacerbations and pneumonia have an overlap of symptoms, and may also coexist, leading to misdiagnosis. over-diagnosis of pneumonia and under-diagnosis of asthma may contribute to significantly untreated respiratory morbidity and mortality in children less than five years old in low-income countries. the virome and bacteriome present in the Upper Respiratory Tract of hospitalized children clinically diagnosed with asthma and pneumonia, during an acute exacerbation and an ARI episode respectively, during 2014 and 2015 winter seasons. for all children, the legal guardians provided written informed consent.

TTMV_INERMex15 showed 68% of homology with TTV 8 genotype 22 from Indonesia. asthma 2014 (A2014), asthma 2015 (A2015), pneumonia 2014 (P2014) and pneumonia 2015 (P2015) each one with qPCR positive (qPCR+) and qPCR negative (qPCR-) results. average amount of sequences obtained from each group after quality filtering was 2,247193 within range of 3,634,710 to 519,470 reads. most represented viruses were in order of number of reads Rhinovirus C (RV-C), Bocavirus 1 (B several reads for viruses with unknown role in respiratory diseases. but there were several reads for viruses with unknown role in respiratory diseases like PVB19, Enterovirus D-68 and Citomegalovirus. complete and partial viral genome and phylogenetic analysis Four representative viruses were used to compare the genome coverage and depth. contigs were assembled to generate partial consensus genomes of RV-C (97% coverage, 6,824 bp) (S1 Fig), BoV-1 (76% coverage, 4055 bp) (S2 Fig), PVB19 (17% coverage, 963 bp) and RSV-B (7.8% coverage, 1184 bp) occus aureus, mycoplasma pneumoniae Veillonella parvula and different Streptococcus spp had more reads in the pneumonia group. other bacteria genus detected of clinical interest with low frequency were: Pseudomonas, Neisseria and Prevotella. 90% of reads were classified as Q30, and only 5% were discarded. the percentage range obtained for bacterial and viral reads was lower than the quantities previously reported by Yang et al. [13] and Nakamura et al. [23]. members of the anelloviridae family were found in both groups of pediatric patients. a potential role of TTMV in pneumonia pathogenesis has been suggested. EV-D68 has been associated with asthma exacerbation and pneumonia in children. in our study, we detected 25 different species of viruses using this same strategy. this is most likely due to a greater ability of analyzing more samples in the same library, thereby increasing the probability to detect more viruses. however, in contrast with a report from Wang et.al. [16] that found a higher prevalence of RSV-B. metagenomic and bioinformatic analyses are very powerful tools to describe the microbiome. identifying the etiologic agents present on each disease may assist in developing better treatments and improving patient care. consensus sequence of Mexican 2014 and Bootstrap values are shown in each node. ML tree from 191 human Bocavirus sequences was calculated using complete VP1 region (2025 bp), cluster with mexINER14 and Brazilian strains are indicated (red rectangle). ML tree from 52 and 74 sequences of RSVA and RSVB respectively was calculated using partial N protein and partial P protein. ML tree from 33 sequences of Torque teno mini virus was calculated using partial ORF1 protein. tree was produced with 1,000 bootstraps replicates."}
