Contagion presents collective patterns of behavior during the epidemic. most fears stem from an absence of information from reputable sources. tension emerges between medical authorities\u2019 advised procedure of forcible isolation and quarantine. most of the violent confrontation stems from hostilities between those subject to quarantines and those managing the confined environments. many scenes capture the frenzied breakdown of social norms. as first details of the disease emerge, the protagonist, Ji-goo, is seen in a mall. several films produced in the immediate aftermath of the 2003 SARS outbreak aimed to present an optimal governmental response. the film follows a British bacteriologist working to prevent the spread of cholera in a small village in rural china in the 1920s. the villagers become incensed for the first time when the foreign doctor tries to move bodies from the cemetery to avoid infecting the water. cinema is not reality, and elements of fear leading to panic and chaos are likely to persist in dramatic representations of disease. the public perception of how epidemic diseases behave is substantially influenced by the media and popular culture (2,4,6,30); parts of this perception are sometimes adopted as scientific facts (31,32) these films also show situations similar to ongoing problems with Ebola in africa today. communal suspicions and distrust of the decisions of outside authorities are rife (37\u201339), violent resistance and outcry occur within communities. localized attempts continue to maintain customary practices in terms of the treatment of the dead."}
