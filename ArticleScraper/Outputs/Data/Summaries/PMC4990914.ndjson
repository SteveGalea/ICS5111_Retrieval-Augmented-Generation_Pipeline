{"summary": "mice treated with mAb m336 were monitored daily for clinical manifestations (weight loss) and mortality. each group (n = 6) of mice was treated via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route with two different doses: 0.1 mg and 1 mg per mouse diluted in 100 l PBS. challenged mice were monitored daily for clinical manifestations (weight loss) mice treated with m336 antibody 12 h before challenge (i.n.) with 104 TCID50 of MERS-CoV. challenged mice monitored daily for the weight loss (A) and accumulated mortality (B), expressed as percent (%) weight loss and survival. all mice treated with a single dose of control m102.4 antibody showed profound weight loss (>15%) and succumbed to MERS-CoV infection with 100% mortality by day 8 p.i. mAbm336 is highly effective as prophylactic or therapeutic modalities in protecting highly permissive transgenic mice against lethal MERS-CoV challenge. mAb m336 most likely confers protection from lethal challenge by restricting viral replication within the lungs. treatment with m336 antibody significantly inhibited infection within the lungs. m336 confers significant protection to mice when administered pre- or post-viral challenge. the epitope targeted by this exceptionally potent m336 antibody has a great potential for further development as a potent preventive and therapeutic agent. treatment with human m336 antibody significantly attenuates lung pathology of mice challenged with MERS-CoV. mice treated with 1 or 0.1 mg of m336 antibody 12 h prior to viral infection. mice treated with 0.1 mg mAb showed a gradual weight loss (15\u201320%) until day 13 just before starting to recover. all surviving mice continued to recover and appeared well up to 21 dpi when the experiment was terminated. treatment with 1 mg of m336 antibodies failed to protect mice fully from the onset of clinical illness (weight loss) challenged mice treated with a low dose of 0.1 mg of m336 antibodies suffered from attenuated and transient weight loss until day 9 p.i. and gradually recovered to day 21 when the experiment was terminated. BD-specific human monoclonal antibody, m336 We also investigated the protective mechanism of m336 against MERS-CoV by determining the lung virus titers in challenged mice at day 2 after treatment. we sacrificed two mice (out of 6) in each group for determining viral titers by using via vero E6 cell-based infectivity assay and quantitative PCR (Q-PCR)-based assay targeting the upstream E gene of MERS-CoV the data shown are representative of at least two independently conducted assays using the same samples. data is presented as Mean standard error (SE) ***P 0.001 as determined by using Student\u2019s t test. the lung pathology scores were graded from 0\u20133 (none, mild, moderate, and severe), based on the extent of mononuclear cell infiltration. mERS-CoV has attracted significant basic research and clinical studies since it was first discovered in early 2012. mAb m336 exhibited the highest potency in neutralizing live MERS-CoV. m336 is highly promising as a potent inhibitor for urgent prophylaxis in adjunctive treatment for patients infected with MERS-CoV. m336 confers a dose-dependent reduction of MERS-CoV infection. it corroborates lower viral RNA levels and live virus isolation determined. m336 administration provided 100% and 75% protection against infection-induced lethality. transgenic mice have LD50 and ID50 of 4.5 and 0.4 TCID50 of MERS-CoV. this m336 antibody is highly conserved among various clinical isolates. a combination treatment with multiple neutralizing mAbs targeting different epitopes or the MERS-CoV-specific HR2P fusion inhibitor targeting the HR1 domain of the MERS-CoV S protein38,44 could be desirable. intraperitoneal administration of m336 to our hDPP4 Tg mice lead to the reduction of viral titer as high as 4 log at 2 dpi. the effect of 4C2h on the weight loss and mortality in these mice is unavailable. combinational use of 4C2h and m336 may exhibit synergistic antiviral effect against both wild-type strains and escape mutants (if any) of MERS-CoV. results suggest that combinational use of m336 mAb may exhibit synergistic antiviral effect against both wild-type strains and escape mutants. groups of 6\u20138-weeks Tg mice were challenged intranasally (in) with 104 TCID50/ml (1,000 LD50) of MERS-CoV-EMC/2012. the titers of individual virus stocks, stored at 80 \u00b0C, were determined by using vero E6-based infectivity assays. TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies) used a one-step RT-PCR kit to assess mERS-CoV-specific genome targeting of virus-specific upstream E gene (upE) and endogenous control gene (mouse -Actin) mRNA expression value was calculated for each replicate and expressed as the equivalent of log10 TCID50 per gram (g) of tissue. mice expressing human DPP4 were housed in on-site animal facilities. animals were housed under a 12:12 light/dark cycle. room temperature and humidity kept between 21\u201325 \u00b0C and 31\u201347%. the suspensions of infected tissues were tittered in the standard vero E6 cell-based infectivity assays to quantify yields of infectious virus expressed as log10 TCID50 per gram (g) of tissue. RNA extraction and viral titers determination were performed by real-time Q-PCR. syndrome Coronavirus Infection: doi: 10.1038/srep31629."}
