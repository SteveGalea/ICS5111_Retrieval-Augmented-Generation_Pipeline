{"summary": "influenza pandemics have originated from AIVs through genetic reassortment between human and avian influenza strains. the unprecedented emergence of H5N1 human infections in 1997 provided the first evidence that AIV could directly transmit from poultry to humans. since February 2013, there have been cases of severe human infection with H7N9 AIV in China. most influenza viruses infect wild and/or domestic birds with limited or no signs of the disease. but highly pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses can cause severe diseases in poultry, with fatality as high as 100%10. human infections with AIV Epidemiology Three different subtypes of AIV have been confirmed as capable of infecting humans. first warning that AIV could directly transmit from avian species to humans occurred in 1997 in Hong Kong. more than 600 cases of human infection have been confirmed in the past 10 years, and the fatality rate is approximately 60%23. all H7 types of AIV are still zoonotic, but may develop into interpersonal pandemics because these viruses preferentially bind to -2,6-linked SA and/or a mammalian adaptation trait on the PB2 protein4,25. symptoms associated with H9N2 infection are generally mild, and there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission30,31,32. patients progressed to severe pneumonia, rapidly developed ARDS 4\u201313 d after disease onset, and finally died from multi-organ failure. primary histopathological findings in fatal H5N1 human infections were extensive infiltration of lungs, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multi-organ failure. a fatal case of AIV (H5N1) infection in a pregnant woman revealed viral infection in the brain, placenta, and fetus55,61. systemic cytokine activation resulted in hemophagocytic syndrome, lymphoid depletion, and skeletal muscle fiber necrosis54,56. viral load of AIV varies in respiratory secretions, tissues, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, and feces. prophylactically or therapeutically in mice significantly increased survival rate. cytokine/chemokine dysregulation also plays a significant role in pathogenesis of AIV infection68. cytokines can further sensitize neighboring cells by up-regulating RIG-I and amplifying the cytokine cascade. viral protein M2 appeared to be the \u201cmain culprit\u201d that correlated with the complete suppression of known viral inflammasome activation75. cytokine response, apoptosis and autophagy, other humoral and cell immune responses are also involved in AIV infection68,76. first warning that AIV could directly transmit from avian species to humans occurred in 1997 in Hong Kong. more than 600 cases of human infection have been confirmed in the past 10 years, and the fatality rate is approximately 60%23. 3, LPAI H7N3 and LPAI H7N2 have had sporadic outbreaks in recent years resulting in only mild illness in humans. the latest LPAI H7N9 outbreak in china caused several deaths due to severe pneumonia and related complications. in chest radiographs 7 to 13 d after the onset of illness, the onset of disease occurred at a median of 3 to 4 d after exposure. initial symptoms of disease were also influenza-like. edemas, degeneration of myocytes in the heart, extensive acute tubular necrosis in the kidney, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and cerebral involvement. a fatal case of AIV (H5N1) infection in a pregnant woman revealed viral infection in the brain, placenta, and fetus55,61. systemic cytokine activation resulted in hemophagocytic syndrome, lymphoid depletion, and autophagic death of alveolar epithelial cells may also be responsible for the high mortality rate of H5N1 infection. autophagy-blocking agents applied prophylactically or therapeutically in mice significantly increased the survival rate and alleviated the lung injury caused by H5N1 infection67. monoclonal antibodies against IL-17 may be helpful to reduce severe lung injury. HPAI (H5N1) was found to attenuate the expression of IRF3 as well as the levels of type I IFNs. the suppression of interferon is also involved in human AIV infection68,76. the adaptation of AIV HA for recognition of -2,6 linked SA located in the human upper respiratory tract would promote interpersonal transmission. several AIV strains with increased binding to human-type receptors isolated from humans prefer binding to avian-type receptors. HPAI viruses contain a motif of multiple basic amino acid residues at the equivalent cleavage site, permitting HA0 to be cleaved by ubiquitously distributed intracellular proteases. circulating virus possesses only a single arginine at the HA cleavage site, yet it has caused severe disease and death in humans4,34. PB1-F2 protein is a non-structural accessory protein in influenza A viruses113. PB1-F2 protein is expressed by almost all avian influenza A strains. the presence of an intact PB1-F2 protein was also found to contribute to viral pathogenicity. NS1 protein A multi-functional nonstructural RNA-binding protein, NS1 is critical for inhibiting both IFN production and the antiviral effects of IFN-induced proteins. a P42S mutation in NS1 dramatically increased the virulence of an H5N1 strain in mice. this substitution contributes to the pathogenicity of AIV H7N9 in humans. LPAI (H7N2) strain has an eight amino acid deletion in the 220-loop of the HA RBD95. two specific mutations in H7-HA, Q226L and G228S, have also been suggested to contribute to increased binding affinity for human receptors96. a flexible loop structure in the cleavage site between HA1 and HA2 may contribute to the low pathogenicity of a H16 subtype AIV105. the natural alpha-helix element might also provide a new opportunity for influenza virus inhibitor design105. mutations within the active sites of either HA or NA can affect the enzymatic activity of both proteins. PB1-F2 protein is expressed by almost all avian influenza A strains. PB1-F2 has been shown to specifically target and sensitize alveolar macrophages to apoptotic stimuli116,117. presence of intact PB1-F2 protein also found to contribute to viral pathogenicity. antiviral agents against AIV Several safe and effective drugs can be used to manage human and avian influenza infection. these agents include M2, neuraminidase, polymerase, attachment and signal-transduction inhibitors as well as ribavirin, arbidol, and herbs. few major adverse effect, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness Few major adverse effect, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and decreased neutrophil count Inhibitory activity on Avian influenza EC50 to AIV: 0.1\u20133.6 nmol/L; EC50 to AIV (N1\u2013N9): 1.4\u201342.0 mol/L (ELISA); 0.1\u20130.9 nmol/L (plaque assay) IC50s of NA activity (N1\u2013N9): 1.8\u201327 151E#, R224K, E276D#, R292K*, N294S*,#, R371K; N2 NA: E119A, E119D, R224K, R292K*,#, R371K, E276D, N9 NA: E119G N1 NA: N295S N1 NA: H275Y*, N295S*, bData from independent research different from other neuraminidas all 24 cases of clade 1 H5N1 isolated between 2008\u20132011 had an S31N substitution. the frequency of this mutation in clade 2 ranged from 0% to 67%. the frequency of this mutation in clade 2 was 0% to 67%. studies in animal models have demonstrated that oseltamivir was active against the H5, H7, and H9 avian influenza strains140,143. the protective efficacy was influenced by the virulence of the strains, the dosage and treatment initiation time140,143. clinical trials also suggested that oseltamivir and zanamivir were useful in reducing the mortality of lethal H5N1 infection. current influenza RNA polymerase inhibitors can be divided into nucleosides and non-nucleosides. fluorodeoxycytidine analogs and favipiravir (T705) have been shown to be active in the treatment of influenza in vitro and in vivo149,150,151. III IFNs, Mx1, inhibit influenza virus infection by interacting with the ribonucleoprotein complex and interfering with viral assembly by disrupting the PB2-NP interaction152. a short peptide derived from PB1 (731\u2013757) was also reported to inhibit virus polymerase153. aerosolized ribavirin effectively eliminated the influenza virus and shortened the duration of illness in clinical observations. orally administered ribavirin did not162,164,165. viramidine effectively protected mice from lethal influenza. attachment inhibitors include sialidase mimics, sialyl glycopolymers and hemagglutinin inhibitors. the sialidase recombinant construct is an inhaled bacterial sialidase that prevents the attachment and subsequent infection of influenza virus. signal-transduction inhibitors Aside from agents that directly target viral proteins, current antiviral strategies also focus on the intracellular cascade needed for viral replication182,183,184. both pathways are critical for cytokine and interferon synthesis during influenza infection182,183,184. a number of clinical trials for these herbs for the treatment of influenza have been conducted. but systematic reviews on the utility of these herbs for the treatment of influenza have revealed that few herbal medicines showed a positive effect on viral shedding. many Chinese herbs exhibit beneficial immunomodulatory effects for rapid recovery of viral infections and might be effective treatments for AIV infection195. hemagglutinins possess multi-arginine/lysine cleavage sites198. several compounds target the NS1 protein and show considerable anti-influenza potential. a C-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor, SP600125, reduced the amplification of influenza virus by indirectly inhibiting the NS1-mediated supportive functions200. frequency of this mutation in clade 2 ranged from 0% to 67%. all 3 cases of H7N9 that have been isolated are S31N variations133. a mutation in the H7 HA protein may also play a role in amantadine resistance134. the protective efficacy was influenced by the virulence of the strains, the dosage and treatment initiation time140,143. clinical trials also suggested that oseltamivir and zanamivir were useful in reducing the mortality of lethal H5N1 infection. resistance to the treatments rarely emerged132. RNA polymerase inhibitors can be divided into nucleosides and non-nucleosides. the most potent inhibitor among fluorodeoxycytidine analogs was 2\u2032-deoxy-2\u2032-fluorocytidine (2\u2032-FdC) which inhibited various strains of HPAI and LPAI. small interfering RNAs targeting the overlapping gene of PB1 and PB1-F2 were found to reduce virus-associated cell apoptosis and virus titers in chicken embryos154. a novel compound, THC19, inhibited influenza viral genome replication and/or transcription in a PA-dependent manner155. ribavirin effectively eliminated the influenza virus and shortened the duration of illness in clinical observations. however, the clinical utility of ribavirin may be limited due to the risk of hemolytic anemia and teratogenicity166. viramidine effectively protected mice from lethal influenza, even when the drug was administered in drinking water157. sialidase mimics, sialyl glycopolymers and hemagglutinin inhibitors have been developed against AIV. the sialidase recombinant construct is an inhaled bacterial sialidase that prevents the attachment and subsequent infection of influenza virus by removing influenza-receptor interactions. the IKK/NF-B module and the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade184 are also critical for cytokine and interferon synthesis during influenza infection182,183,184. however, some inhibitors targeting NF-B, such as aspirin, have been routinely used in influenza-like illness for years185. few herbal medicines showed a positive effect on viral shedding. many Chinese herbs exhibit beneficial immunomodulatory effects for rapid recovery of viral infections. several active proteases of influenza A viruses have been considered potential drugs. avian influenza may be the most likely candidate for the next influenza pandemic. rapid, sensitive, and confirmatory diagnoses for early identification and monitoring are essential for the control of AIV infections."}
