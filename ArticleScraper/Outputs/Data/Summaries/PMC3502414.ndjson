{"summary": "Background Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a Gammacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. it is a causative agent of an economically important disease in poultry. spike glycoprotein of IBV is essential for host cell attachment, neutralization, and is involved in the induction of protective immunity. IBV belongs to the order of Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae and to genus of Gamma-coronavirus group 3. the genome is positive-sense single stranded RNA of about 27.6 kb. it contains 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions. the Massachusetts strain was initially isolated in 1940 in USA. spike glycoprotein contains serotype specific virus neutralizing epitopes. it is responsible for the hemagglutinating activity and for infectivity. changes in nucleotide sequences have been able to alter protection ability of a vaccine. palmitoylation, leucine-rich repeat and N-glycosylation characteristics of IBV Massachusetts and QX-like strains were evaluated using bioinformatics tools. the results revealed that most of the N-glycosylation sites were conserved within genotype in the analyzed strains, except in strain CK/SWE/082066/10. phosphorylation sites at position Ser54, Ser79, Ser312, Ser404, Ser534, Ser618, Ser685, Ser908 and Ser1061 were found to be conserved. two isolates CK/SWE/242/95 and CK/SWE/748/95 that did not contain phosphorylation sites at position Ser542 and Ser563 were found to be conserved. CK/SWE/748/95, CK/SWE/1096/97 and CK/SWE/062545/09 contained 10 palmitoylation sites in the spike glycoprotein of the virus. the isolates CK/SWE/748/95, CK/SWE/1096/97 and CK/SWE/062545/09 contained 10 palmitoylation sites in the spike glycoprotein of the virus. there were 82-87 positively charged residues (Arg + Lys) in the QX-like strains, 2-4 residues more than Massachusetts strains. the computed instability index and aliphatic index (AI) showed variable values (83.79-85.91) in all analyzed strains. the primary structures of the spike glycoprotein were found to be relatively variable in the strains. phylogenetic analysis based on complete spike gene of avian coronaviruses shows the relationship between IBV and avian coronaviruses. the isolates analysed in this study are indicated by square. thirty N-glycosylation sites were found in the Massachusetts strains. 35 N-glycosylation sites were present in the QX-like strains. most of the N-glycosylation sites were conserved within genotype. CK/SWE/242/95 and CK/SWE/748/95 presented cleavage site at amino acid position 537 arginine. two strains CK/SWE/242/95 and CK/SWE/748/95 presented cleavage site at histidine. the isolates CK/SWE/748/95, CK/SWE/1096/97 and CK/SWE/062545/09 contained 10 palmitoylation sites in the spike glycoprotein of the virus. the isolates CK/SWE/082066/2010 contained additional palmitoylation site 1130 (CGGCFGI) phylogenetic analysis of the complete spike gene based on avian coronaviruses revealed the sequences of the analysed strains segregated into three main groups. group I was composed of IBV sequences that clustered together with those of Massachusetts, Arkansas and QX-like genotypes. a set of strictly mammalian coronaviruses branching into the SARS, human coronavirus HKU1, bat coronaviruses and a cluster majorly of animal coronaviruses. the sequence of human coronavirus OC43 was found in this cluster, curiously identical to a coronavirus identified in pigs. a virus belonging to the Coronaviridae, lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDEV) has been reported to determine changes of virulence and cellular tropism. the presence of serine, threonine and tyrosine residues, with the right context for potential phosphorylation, was investigated. an IBV monoclonal antibody neutralization-resistant mutant (NR 18) had shown substitution of amino acid isoluecine for arginine in cleavage site motif. this prevented cleavage and alter the conformation dependent monoclonal antibody binding epitope. the relevance of cleavage site to virulence was not observed in case of IBV spike glycoprotein [26] it has been reported that removal of palmitoylation sites in HIV-1 virus effected in the formation of virus with low levels of glycoproteins incorporation and reduced infectivity. the predicted primary structures of the spike glycoprotein have shown a variable trend in physical properties such as isoelectric point, molecular weights and grand hydropathicity index. phylogenetic analysis based on spike glycoprotein of avian coronaviruses and mammalian coronaviruses had revealed interesting trends. the mammalian beluga whale coronaviruses branched closer to the avian coronaviruses and two avian thrush and munia coronaviruses were related to the mammalian coronaviruses suggesting interspecies transmission. silico predictions confirm previous data on phylogenetic analysis. the spike glycoprotein of the Massachusetts and QX genotypes are molecularly different. the genetic diversity seen in this protein of IBV, avian, human, bat and other animal coronaviruses may bear relation with host specificity. at least three or more turns were taken in account for one helix, strand or coil in the structure of spike glycoprotein. at least three or more turns were taken in account for one helix, strand or coil in the structure of spike glycoprotein. phylogenetic trees were constructed by the Neighbour-joining method with the nucleotide substitution model of Kimura-2 parameter model. the tree reliability/robuststness of the hypothesis were evaluated by bootstrap of 1000 replicates. the secondary structures (alpha helices, beta strands and random coils) of the protein were predicted by using services at http://csspalm.biocuckoo.org/prediction.php. at least three or more turns were taken in account for one helix, strand or coil. phylogenetic trees were constructed by the Neighbour-joining method with the nucleotide substitution model of Kimura-2 parameter model. the tree reliability/robuststness of the hypothesis were evaluated by bootstrap of 1000 replicates. authors have declared that they have no competing interests. strains analyzed in this study indicated by star *. click here for file (17.4KB, docx)"}
