Ltd (Dalian, China) Strains of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 1960 all PCR products were sequenced to confirm in GenScript Corporation (Nanjing, China) the antibiotic susceptibility was determined according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) procedure. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of selected antibiotics were shown in Table 1. human red blood cells were obtained from the third people's hospital of Wuxi. the study was approved by the Ethics Committees of the third people's hospital of Wuxi. the total expression protein samples from cell lysates after induction were mixed with equivalent sample buffer. gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. the same protein sample was separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. the pellet from 200 ml culture was then resuspended in 20 ml binding buffer (20 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, and 10 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0) the supernatant of the cell lysate resulting from centrifugation at 12,000g at 4\u00b0C for 20 min was applied to a nickel\u2013nitrilo eluted and washed proteins appearing in fractions with high-UV values were pooled as the final purified sample. purified Scorpine was filtered through a 0.22 m filter membrane and stored at 80\u00b0C for activity assays. 1% CV solution at 37\u00b0C for 30 min, washed twice with sterile distilled water and then air-dried at 55\u00b0C for 1 h. the stained biofilm cells were destained with 95% ethanol. negative control (CVControl) was used to reduce background staining from the cells. the synchronized parasites were cultured in human erythrocytes type A+ at 5% hematocrit. about 24 h after the synchronized parasites were cultured, the majority trophozoite stage parasites were exposed to recombinant Scorpine (5 and 10 M) for 24, 48 and 72 h. all restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Takara Biotech Co. Ltd (Dalian, China) Strains of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606 were purchased from China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCC, China) all PCR products were sequenced to confirm in GenScript Corporation (Nanjing, China) the antibiotic susceptibility was determined according to the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) procedure. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC, g/ml) of selected antibiotics were shown in Table 1. the pSUMO/Scorpine plasmid was transformed into competent E. coli BL21 (DE3) three colonies were picked and cultured in 4 ml sterilized Luria\u2013Bertani (LB) medium. Isopropyl-b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was then added to induce expression of the recombinant protein at 28\u00b0C for 8 h. gels stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. tricine/SDS-PAGE analysis for resolution of proteins smaller than 30 kDa. lysate resulting from centrifugation at 12,000g at 4\u00b0C for 20 min was applied to a nickel\u2013nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2+\u2013NTA, Novagen) affinity chromatography column. the fusion protein was eluted with five column volumes of elution buffer (20 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) Purified Scorpine was filtered through a 0.22 m filter membrane and stored at 80\u00b0C for activity assays. the bacteria were transferred into 96-well flat-bottomed polystyrene microtiter plates at approximately 105 CFU/ml in tryptic soy broth. after cultivation, the supernatant was serially diluted with 0.1% sterile buffered peptone water (BPW), and the dilutions were pour- the strain was cultured in human erythrocytes type A+ at 5% hematocrit. the strain was cultured in RPMI (Gibco) medium supplemented with HEPES 25 mM, glutamine 2 mM, glucose 2 g/l, hypoxanthine 29.25 mg/l, gentamicin 60 mg/l and albumax 1.6% at pH 7.4. 5,000 cells from several fields were counted for every thin blood film. each recombinant Scorpine concentration was tested at least triplicate. results were expressed as meansS.D. expression analysis using 12% SDS\u2013PAGE (A), Western blotting (B), and 16.5% Tricine-SDS-PAGE (C). lane 1: Protein molecular weight marker; lane 2: Crude cells extracts of induced E. coli BL21 containing pSUMO/His-Sumo-Scorpine; lane 4: Sonicated precipitate of induced E. coli BL21 containing pSUMO/His-Sumo corpine protein was competently cleaved after incubation with SUMO protease at 30\u00b0C for 1 h. after the cleaved sample was re-applied to a Ni2+\u2013NTA column to remove His6-tagged SUMO and SUMO protease, finally purified Scorpine was obtained. 16.5% Tricine/SDS-PAGE gel results indicated that Scorpine had been purified successfully to more than 95% purity we investigated effects of recombinant Scorpine on biofilm formation ability of two standard bacteria including S. aureus ATCC 29213 and A. baumannii ATCC 19606. clinically isolated bacteria including S. aureus S, S. aureus R, A. baumannii S, and A. baumannii R. inant Scorpine reduced Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia over time course of experiment. at 48 h of exposure, no parasites were observed at recombinant Scorpine 5 M or above. no infected erythrocytes were detected after 72 h, at all tested concentrations. the correct construct was transformed into the expression host E. coli BL21 (DE3). there was an obvious protein band after IPTG induction. the apparent molecular weight of the SUMO fusion protein was about 18 kDa. purification of SUMO/Scorpine Fusion Protein. most of the proteins without 6His tags were removed from the Ni2+\u2013NTA resin using washing buffer containing 20 mM imidazole. purity was estimated through SDS-PAGE gels stained using Coomassie Blue. aureus ATCC 29213 and A. baumannii ATCC 19606 from china general microbiological culture collection center. four clinically isolated bacteria including S. aureus S, S. aureus R, A. baumannii S, and A. baumannii R. different letters (A\u2013C) are significantly different within treatments at p0.05. trophozoite stage cultures of Plasmodium falciparum were exposed to recombinant Scorpine. at 48 h of exposure, no parasites were observed at recombinant Scorpine 5 M or above. the number of infected erythrocytes was counted as described in the \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d section. the representative microscopic images of the parasites treated with recombinant Scorpine for 24 h, using the microscopic examination of thin blood films stained with Giemsa (100, oil immersion) Scorpion venoms are rich sources of peptides with a variety of pharmacological functions. human SUMO-1 shares 50% sequence identity with human SUMO-2/SUMO-3. SUMO can fold and protect the protein by its chaperoning properties. SUMO proteases remove SUMO from proteins by cleaving the C-termini of SUMO in yeast to the mature form. the recombinant Scorpine was able to inhibit the formation of bacteria. the biofilm formation as a bacterial survival strategy leads to increased resistance to heat, acid, preservatives, and antibiotics. the ingested bacteria are exposed to acidic stress and bile salt. these stress conditions can influence antibiotic resistance patterns, biofilm-forming abilities, and virulence properties. MO fusion partner and customized expression and purification protocol described here have further improved the efficiency. the SUMO fusion partner could also be widely applied to the industrial production of a variety of enzyme proteins in E. coli."}
