{"summary": "peste des petits ruminants is an acute, highly contagious viral disease of goats and sheep. the disease is characterized by high fever, nasal and ocular discharges, pneumonia, necrotic and ulcerative lesions of the mucus membranes and inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract. the disease is characterized by high fever, nasal and ocular discharges, pneumonia, necrotic and ulcerative lesions of the mucus membranes and inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract ducks were generally resistant to avian influenza virus (AIV) whereas chickens suffer from severe disease with rapid death following infection with highly pathogenic AIV. the reason for this species specificity is unclear at present. host-derived factors could be the differential presence or distribution of specific viral receptors in these species. mastitis is an economically important inflammatory disease of the udder. this has been linked to temporal differences in the onset and duration of immune responses, including cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and IFN. naive PBMC showed significantly higher basal TLR3 (p0.001) and TLR7 (p0.001) transcripts than Barbari goats. the Kanni and Salem Black breeds showed significantly higher basal TLR3 (p0.001) and TLR7 (p0.001) transcripts than Barbari goats. expression levels observed in Kanni and Salem Black breeds do not differ significantly. values represent mean SD of 40-corrected CT of TLR3 and 7 in nine individual animals per breed (n = 9) TCID50 was not determined for poly I:C treated and PPRV infected PBMC. the 40-Ct values of PPRV H mRNA expression levels across these breeds were not significantly different. water buffalo PBMC supported significantly lower (about 4.89 fold) replication of PPRV than goat PBMC. levels of cytokine IL10 were significantly higher in Kanni and Salem black breeds. lower mRNA expression levels of IL10 were also observed on stimulating TLR3 and TLR7 with poly I:C and imiquimod. values represent mean SD of 5 individual animals per goat breed. cytokine ELISA for TNF, IFN and IFN were similar to mRNA expression profiles observed by qRT-PCR. increased mRNA levels of IL1 and IFN in buffalo PBMC and IL10, IL12p40 and IFN in goat PBMCs were observed. increased mRNA levels of IL1 and IFN in buffalo PBMC and IL10, IL12p40 and IFN in goat PBMCs were observed. IFN mRNA levels were significantly reduced by IRS 661 treatment. conditioned medium (CM) from PPRV infected cells were used to pre-treat PBMC. percent inhibition in virus replication was significantly higher (p0.01) in CM pre-treated buffalo PBMC than goat PBMC. the gene was amplified and seven overlapping PCR amplicons were sequenced to obtain the full length TLR7 gene. the sequences obtained for Barbari, Tellicherry and Kanni goat breeds were submitted to GenBank as a template. the Kanni and Salem Black breeds revealed significantly higher basal TLR3 (p0.001) and TLR7 (p0.001) transcripts than Barbari goats. PBMC from each of these four goat breeds (n = 5) were infected with 1103.0 mean tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of PPRV. TCID50 values of PPRV in goat PBMC on treatment with b) poly I:C and c) imiquimod. bars with the same superscript do not differ significantly. significance is indicated when p0.05. buffalo PBMC supported significantly lower (about 4.89 fold) replication of PPRV than goat PBMC (p0.001). Approximately 2 log10 difference in the virus yield was evident between buffalo and goat PBMC upon PPRV infection. differences were not observed between these breeds and Tellicherry. lower mRNA expression levels of IL10 were also observed in Kanni and Salem black breeds. PPRV infected PBMC from Kanni and Salem black breeds showed higher production of TNF, IFN and IFN than Barbari breed. poly I:C and imiquimod treated PBMC showed higher production of TNF, IFN and IFN than Barbari breed. goat and goat PBMCs were treated with a predetermined optimum concentration (10 g/ml) of a TLR7 antagonist IRS 661 [] 24 h prior to imiquimod treatment or PPRV infection. IFN mRNA levels were significantly reduced by IRS 661 treatment. conditioned medium used to pre-treat PBMC before virus infection. percent inhibition in virus replication was significantly higher (p0.01) in CM pre-treated buffalo PBMC than goat PBMC. the gene was amplified and seven overlapping PCR amplicons were sequenced to obtain the full length TLR7 gene using the goat TLR7 sequence from GenBank as a template. the sequences obtained for Barbari, Tellicherry and Kanni goat breeds were submitted to GenBank. three live attenuated vaccines, specific to lineage IV PPRV strains, have so far been tested in India. goats have been reported to be more susceptible to PPRV than sheep, while cattle and buffalo do not contract clinical disease. increased mortality in lambs/kids, and increased susceptibility of west African goats, especially dwarf goats, have also been documented. TLR7 is highly expressed in immune cells like plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) the basal levels of TLR3 and TLR7 were significantly higher in the PBMCs of PPRV resistant goat breeds. this indicates that TLR3 and TLR7 play a role in the recognition of PPRV RNA by goat PBMC. FN pre-treated Vero cells or in PBMC pre-treated with CM from virus infected cells was significantly lower even at very low doses. human IFN has been shown to effectively suppress the replication of bovine viral diarrhea virus and bovine parainfluenza virus [40], [41] in buffalos, approximately 1.5 fold higher levels of IFN at mRNA and protein levels were induced in PBMC compared to goats after infection with PPRV. this effect was more prominent in buffalo PBMC suggesting that TLR7 mediated IFN production determines PPRV replication efficiency in this species. the goat TLR7 gene is 3.4 Kb long, with a 3141 nucleotide open reading frame (ORF), coding for 1046 amino acids. the toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain sequence is highly conserved between species, as it plays a crucial role in TLR downstream signaling. studies are required to correlate the reported SNP\u2019s in buffalo TLR7 with observed differential response of buffalo PBMC to PPRV. variations in downstream intracellular signaling molecules such as MyD88 and MD2 may also play a role. the difference in LRR numbers could be a critical factor in determining the signaling responses of goat and buffalo TLR7. PBMC from nine animals of each breed were used for TLR mRNA expression analysis. PPRV infection and TLR stimulationstudies carried out on PBMC from five animals. PBMC were stimulated with predetermined doses of TLR3 and TLR7 agonists, poly I:C and imiquimod (R837). cells were harvested at 24 h for cytokine transcript analysis. in a separate experiment, TLR ligand stimulated PBMC were infected with 103.0 TCID50 of PPRV. target gene Primer/Probe sequence 5\u2032-3\u2032 (Forward/Reverse) Efficiency Slope Accession number TLR7 GCTCCAAATGCCCATGTGATT 0.953 3.43 HQ263216 AGGAATACCTCCAGGAATTTCTGTCA FAM 5\u2032CTGCACAGACAAACTT 3\u2032 NFQ TLR3 GTCCTTGACCTCGGCCTTAA 0.976 3.38 H263216 CCCCATTCTTGGCCTGTGA FAM ELISA kits for TNF, IFN and IFN were used to determine cytokine concentrations in the culture supernatants of TLR-ligand stimulated and/or PPRV infected PBMCs. values were obtained spectrophotometrically on an ELISA reader (Epoch Micro-Volume Spectrophotometer System) at 492 nm. sequences were assembled into a 3.4 kb contig, which contained a 3141 bp open reading frame. heterozygous nucleotides were scored manually across samples from different breeds. each polymorphic nucleotide was further analyzed for its amino acid position and change. PBMC were stimulated with predetermined doses of TLR3 and TLR7 agonists, poly I:C and imiquimod (R837). a synthetic analog of dsRNA (poly I:C) and polyionosinic-polycytidylic acid was diluted in endotoxin-free water. s were harvested at 24 h for cytokine transcript analysis. s were infected with 103.0 TCID50 of PPRV. qRT-PCR was performed using gene-specific primers.
