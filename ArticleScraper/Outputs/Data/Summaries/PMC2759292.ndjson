{"summary": "hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) there are approximately 170 million infected people worldwide [2] and no therapeutic or prophylactic vaccines currently available. the ORF is flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTR) the precursor polyprotein is processed co- and post-translationally by cellular and viral proteases into 10 proteins. structural proteins (core, E1, and E2), a small membrane-associated protein p7, and six nonstructural (NS) proteins. the MEK/ERK signaling pathway plays an important role in their replication. the signaling cascade enhances replication of viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus [6], influenza virus [7], borna disease virus [8], coronavirus [9], coxsakievirus B3 [10], and herpes simples virus [11]. cell culture and reagents Huh 7-based HCV subgenomic replicon cells were described elsewhere [15] and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin/L-glutamine, 1X non-essential amino-acids. both cells were maintained as Huh 7 HCV replicon cells except for that no G418 was present in the culture medium. pGEM-3Z-5\u2032UTR was previously constructed from pC3.RLuc.Polio IRES.Fluc. in vitro RNA transcription HCV RLuc replicon construct was linearized with Sca I, purified, and transcribed with MEGAscriptTM T7 RNA transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) lysates were prepared at 48 hr post transfection with a standard RIPA buffer. membrane was stripped and re-probed with anti-actin mAb. luciferase reporter gene assay was performed using a Renilla luciferase assay kit. the RPA was performed with a BD RiboQuantTM ribonuclease protection assay kit (BD Biosciences) as described elsewhere. 10 g total RNA was hybridized with 80,000 cpm [-32P] UTP-labeled 5\u2032UTR anti-sense or sense probe for detection of plus- or minus-strand HCV RNA respectively. the absolute HCV RNA level was calculated using in vitro transcribed JFH-1 RNA standards. both cells were maintained as Huh 7 replicon cells except for that no G418 was present in the culture medium. pGEM-3Z-5\u2032UTR was previously constructed from pC3.RLuc.Polio IRES.Fluc. in vitro RNA transcription HCV RLuc replicon construct was linearized with Sca I, purified, and transcribed with MEGAscriptTM T7 RNA transcription kit. cell lysates were prepared at 48 hr post transfection with a standard RIPA buffer. membrane was stripped and re-probed with anti-actin mAb. luciferase assay was performed using a Renilla luciferase assay kit. s were synthesized using pCR2.1--actin and pGEM-3Z-5\u2032UTR as respective templates and a MaxiscriptTM RNA transcription kit (Ambion) according to manufacturer's instructions. 10 g total RNA was hybridized with 80,000 cpm [-32P] UTP-labeled 5\u2032UTR anti-sense probe. the absolute HCV RNA level was calculated using in vitro transcribed JFH-1 RNA standards. results MEK inhibitors enhanced HCV replication. we took advantage of two well-characterized and widely used MEK inhibitors (U0126 and PD98059) treatment of the inhibitors increased plus-strand HCV RNA level by about 3.5 fold over the DMSO control. results provide first evidence that inhibition of the MEK/ERK signaling enhanced HCV gene expression and replication. a. Lysates were subjected to the luciferase reporter gene activity assay. protein kinase, 2\u2032-5\u2032oligoadenylate synthase and 2\u2032-5\u2032oligoadenylate synthase accounts for IFN-mediated anti-viral activity [23] luciferase reporter replicon cells were treated first with IFN-/2b, followed by MEK inhibitors. luciferase reporter gene activity was inhibited by IFN-/2b treatment alone. HCV replicon cells were grown in a 24- or 6-well plate in the presence of IFN-/2b (200 IU/ml) for 24 hr and then treated with either MEK inhibitors or DMSO for 24 hr. total RNA was assayed for plus-strand HCV RNA by RPA. the basal activity of MEK/ERK signaling was sufficient for MEK inhibitors-enhanced HCV replication. HCV replicon cells were cultured in the absence or presence of serum for 24 hr. expression of dominant negative ERK-1 led to a significantly higher luciferase reporter gene activity compared to that of the control. however, expression of dominant negative ERK-1 had little effect on the luciferase gene activity compared to that of the control (p = 0.001) ERK-1 knockdown did not exhibit significant difference in the luciferase gene activity compared to the control siRNA (p = 0.45) both control and ERK-1 siRNA appeared to have non-specific effects on the level of plus-strand HCV RNA synthesis, but there was no difference between these two transfections. treatment of MEK inhibitors resulted in higher HCV core protein expression compared to the DMSO control (p = 0.009) treatment of MEK inhibitors led to a significantly higher level of plus-strand HCV RNA compared to the DMSO control (p = 0.009) Huh 7.5 cells were transfected with full-length RNA and treated with either DMSO or MEK inhibitors for 48 hr. total RNA was extracted and intracellular HCV RNA was quantitated by real-time RT-PCR using the TaqMan technology. no statistically significant difference for the Renilla luciferase reporter gene activity, i.e. the HCV IRES-dependent translation compared to the DMSO control (p = 0.028) these results indicate that the MEK signaling is also involved in regulation of the HCV IRES translational activity. treatment of MEK inhibitors resulted in a significant increase in the luciferase reporter gene activity. compared to the DMSO control, treatment of these inhibitors resulted in a significant increase in the luciferase reporter gene activity. anti-sense RNA probe (B) and minus-strand HCV RNA were detected using the sense RNA probe (C) by RPA. levels of plus- and minus-strand HCV RNA were determined by densitometry relative to that of the DMSO control. luciferase reporter gene activity, IFN-/2b inhibited plus-strand HCV RNA synthesis. effect of both MEK inhibitors on plus-strand HCV RNA synthesis was higher than each inhibitor alone. luciferase reporter gene assay found that enhanced HCV replication by MEK inhibitors is probably independent of the IFN- anti-viral activity. RLuc replicon cells were cultured in a serum-free medium for 24 hr. total RNA was isolated for plus-strand HCV RNA detection by RPA. luciferase reporter gene activity also increased plus-strand HCV RNA level. dominant negative MEK-1 and ERK-2 but not ERK-1 enhanced HCV replication. yed for plus-strand HCV RNA by RPA was quantitated as above. lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis or the luciferase reporter gene activity assay. the data were expressed as meanSEM of triplicates. ERK-1 knockdown had no effects on HCV replication. HCV replicon cells were grown in a 24- or 6-well plate and transfected with siRNAs. total RNA was used for the detection of plus-strand HCV RNA by RPA. -actin RNA was detected as internal equal RNA loading control using a -actin-specific probe. RNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR using the TaqMan technology. supernatants were collected, concentrated, and viral RNA was isolated. RNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. a bicistronic reporter plasmid in which HCV IRES drives the translation of the Firefly luciferase gene while the Renilla luciferase gene is translated by a cap-dependent mechanism. we transfected Huh 7 cells with the bicistronic reporter, treated the cells with MEK inhibitors, and harvested cells for the Renilla luciferase gene activity. gene activity to measure cap-dependent translation (C) was expressed as meansSEM of triplicates. we demonstrated the involvement of MEK-1 and ERK-2 but not ERK-1 in HCV replication in both HCV subgenomic and genomic systems. the MEK/ERK signaling pathway may regulate HCV replication through direct or indirect phosphorylation of viral and/or cellular proteins. selective inhibition of cellular kinases has found an inverse correlation between NS5A phosphorylation level and HCV RNA replication [29]. this led us to evaluate the outcome of MEK inhibitors-enhanced HCV replication on virus production using the recently described HCV JFH-1 cell culture system. findings support the notion that targeting MEK/ERK signaling as therapeutic intervention to treat hepatocellular carcinoma may lead to acceleration of HCV pathogenic process."}
