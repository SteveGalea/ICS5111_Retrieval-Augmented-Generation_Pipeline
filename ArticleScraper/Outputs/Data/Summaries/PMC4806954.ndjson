{"summary": "13 samples were labeled Jordan-1-2015 through Jordan-13-2015. total RNA was isolated from 140 L of each sample by using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) full MERS-CoV genome sequencing was performed on the sample with the highest viral load. a 48-nt (16 aa) deletion in open reading frame (ORF) 4a was not detected in any other MERS-CoV strain. this ORF is present only in lineage 2c betacoronaviruses and encodes protein 4a. this protein encodes protein 4a, which has recently been shown to inhibit type I interferon production. nucleotide changes are indicated in green (A), red (T), blue (C), and black (G) Deleted nucleotides are indicated in orange. no nucleotide substitutions were observed in this region between MERS-CoVs from Jordan. no cell culture adaptive mutations in the genome sequence were observed for the virus isolated from clinical sample Jordan-1-2015. the deletion was located in ORF3, which encodes a protein with an unknown function. the presence of this deletion in the virus from clinical sample Jordan-10-2015 was confirmed by Sanger sequencing, excluding the possibility that it was an adaptation. deletion disrupted the reading frame of the early-stage human isolates. viruses containing this deletion predominated later during the epidemic. the deletion does not result in the removal of an entire gene, suggesting that this mutation is not a loss of function mutation. a more detailed epidemiologic investigation of this outbreak is needed. these data underscore the need for close monitoring of the molecular evolution of MERS-CoV."}
