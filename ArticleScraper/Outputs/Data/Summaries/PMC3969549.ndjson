{"summary": "patients with respiratory symptoms had respiratory secretions analyzed for respiratory viruses according to institutional protocols. patients with RSV URI received high dose intermittently (6 g/day, 60 mg/mL for 2 hours every 8 hours) or low dose continuously (6 g/day, 20 mg/mL for 18 hours/day) ribavirin at the discretion of the attending physician was also analyzed. patients who presented with URI concurrently with URI were excluded. patients who presented with RSV LRD concurrently with URI were defined as progressors. serum neutralizing-antibody titers to RSV were incubated with 75 plaque-forming units (PFU) of RSV A2 strain (group A virus) or RSV B1 strain (group B virus) for 30 minutes at room temperature. after 3 days, the quantity of RSV antigen was determined by monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the RSV F protein. death was treated as a competing risk for progression. patients who received an autologous or syngeneic transplant were categorized separately for analysis of acute GVHD as a risk factor for progression. a variable was retained in the multivariable model if its univariate association with progression resulted in a P value.1. patients with acute graft vs host disease were considered to have RSV infection. only patients who presented with RSV URI within 100 days post HCT were included for the analysis. conventional and shell vial centrifugation viral cultures were performed as a standard practice for all patients throughout the study period. after 2006, upper respiratory tract samples were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instead of conventional methods. BAL samples were tested both by conventional methods and PCR. the quantity of RSV antigen was determined by EIA using monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the RSV F protein. the neutralization titer was defined as the serum dilution that results in a 50% reduction in color development. the statistical significance of differences in absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) between the times of URI onset and LRD onset for progressors was evaluated with the Wilcoxon signed rank test. differences in ALC values and slopes were then compared by progression status via t-test.
