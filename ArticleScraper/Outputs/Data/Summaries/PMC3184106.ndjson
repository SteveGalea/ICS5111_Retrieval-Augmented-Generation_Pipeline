{"summary": "TGEV has a sialic acid binding activity that is believed to be important for enteropathogenicity. but that has so far appeared to be dispensable for infection of cultured cells. the aims of this study were to determine the effect of sialic acid binding for the infection of cultured cells. TGEV is a porcine coronavirus that causes diarrhea in pigs of all ages. the fusion activity of the S protein is induced only after interaction with a specific receptor on the surface of the target cell, porcine aminopeptidase N. a single mutation in the S protein may result in the loss of both the sialic acid binding activity and the enteropathogenicity. mutant viruses can be propagated in cultured cells to the same titer as the parental virus. this finding has been explained by environmental conditions in the intestine that make it more difficult for a microorganism to initiate an intestinal infection compared to an infection of cultured cells [9,10]. neuraminidase concentration of 250 mU/ml gave no increase in virus inhibition. as higher concentrations of the enzyme gave no increase in virus inhibition, we concluded that sialic acids were removed to a satisfactory level. infection at 20 min adsorption time was reduced by 64%. mutants HAD3 and m10 are all deficient in sialic acid binding activity. this increase was significant for mutants with a p-value below 0.05. binding of the S protein to pAPN is even more efficient after neuraminidase treatment. strains and mutants after neuraminidase treatment of the cells Virus adsorption time 5 min 20 min 60 min TGEV PUR46 35.8% (*, 4) 55.0% (*, 4) 74.4% (4) TGEV HAD3 149.1% (*, 4) 144.1% (*, 4) 130.7% (*, 4) not determined 110.0% (4) TGEV m10 119.9% (*, 4) not TGEV were incubated for 60 min with either PBS (grey columns) or PBS containing 50 mU of neuraminidase (white columns) the experiments were performed 3 times. standard deviations are indicated. after neuraminidase treatment the titers decreased significantly for the first two time points (8.13 106 PFU/ml at 5 min, 2.06 107 PFU/ml at 20 min, and 7.33 107 PFU/ml at 60 min) infectious titers for the hemagglutination deficient mutant HAD3 were 5.14 106 PFU/ml at 5 min adsorption time, 2.05 107 PFU/ml ivity (5 min adsorption time) of HAD3 is about 22.6% of the value for TGEV PUR46 at this time point (with p = 0.014) however, the late infectivity (60 min) of HAD3 is about 42.2% of the value for TGEV PUR46. previous studies have shown that binding to these porcine intestinal mucins inhibited hemagglutination by TGEV. prior to infection, TGEV PUR46 was treated with the indicated mucin concentrations for 30 min at room temperature. after a 5 min adsorption time, a plaque assay was performed. pre-treatment of cells with neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens, type V (250 mU/ml; Sigma) for 60 min reduced the infectivity of the parental virus by 26%. when the virus had only 5 min for adsorption, the infectivity on desialylated cells was reduced by 64%. this increase was significant for mutants HAD3 and m10 with a p-value below 0.05 (table 1). binding of the S protein to pAPN is even more efficient after neuraminidase treatment. in the porcine intestine the binding of the mutants to pAPN could be less efficient because of the presence of sialic acids. TGEV HAD3 149.1% (*, 4) 144.1% (*, 4) 130.7% (*, 4) not determined 110.0% (4) TGEV m10 119.9% (*, 4) not determined 109.3% (*, 4) TGEV Miller 67.7% (*, 3) 76.9% (*, 3) 74.0% (*, 3) IBV Beaudette 66.6% (*, 3) not determined 53 avian coronavirus IBV uses sialic acid as a receptor determinant for infection of both cultured cells and tracheal organ cultures. we were interested to know if this virus also shows differences in the dependence on the sialic acid binding activity at short and long adsorption times. infectious titers for the hemagglutination deficient mutant HAD3 were 5.14 106 PFU/ml at 5 min adsorption time, 2.05 107 PFU/ml at 20 min, and 3.64 107 PFU/ml at 60 min. after neuraminidase treatment titers increased (9.30 106 PFU/ml at 5 min, 2.96 107 PFU/ml at 20 min, and 4.74 the late infectivity (60 min) of HAD3 is about 42.2% of the value for TGEV PUR46 (with p = 0.021) this higher difference between TGEV PUR46 and HAD3 in early infectivity could be explained by the addition of sialic acids for adsorption by TGEV PUR46. TGEV PUR46 was treated with the indicated mucin concentrations for 30 min. after a 5 min adsorption time of the virus-mucin-mixture a plaque assay was performed. significant differences are marked with an asterisk. the Miller strain of TGEV resembles IBV in its dependence on the sialic acid binding activity. these two viruses represent the second group of coronaviruses. the presence of such a receptor-destroying enzyme is consistent with a higher affinity for the respective type of sialic acid. coronaviruses are characterized by one of the highest recombination frequencies among RNA viruses. by recombination events this virus could have acquired a sialic acid binding activity. such a virus, like BCoV, resembles influenza viruses. the supernatant was harvested, clarified by centrifugation, and stored at -80\u00b0C after the addition of 1% fetal calf serum. the hemagglutination deficient mutant HAD3 was selected for a deficiency in sialic acid binding. the cells were infected with TGEV PUR46, TGEV mutants HAD3, m10, and m8. the plaque reduction was calculated as a mean value out of 3 independent experiments. a plaque reduction assay was performed on vero cells as described previously. mutants m10 (deletion of 4 amino acids at position 146-149) and m8 (point mutation at amino acid 147 (Cys-Arg) originally derived from the TGEV Purdue-115 strain. neuraminidase treatment Prior to infection, cells were either treated with 200 l neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens. dette Plaque reduction was calculated as a mean value out of 3 independent experiments. the plaque reduction was calculated as a mean value out of 2 independent experiments with quadruplicates."}
