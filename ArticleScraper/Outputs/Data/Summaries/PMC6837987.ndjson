{"summary": "the aim of this pilot study was to test the feasibility of pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) directed oxygen therapy in mainland China. the study enrolled 214 adult patients with an expected intensive care unit stay of more than 72 hours. the primary outcome was 28-day mortality. arterial hyperoxia following resuscitation from cardiac arrest was associated with increased in-hospital mortality. a pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94\u201398% was recommended (4). in general, for critically ill patients without severe acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS), evidence regarding oxygen therapy is scarce. all patients aged 18 years or older admitted to the ICU with an expected length of stay of 72 hours or longer were screened. the exclusion criteria included patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstruction disease, patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, inclusion in another interventional trial. fiO2 and SpO2 were recorded every six hours until 14 days, death or ICU discharge. the time-weighted average pO2 from the arterial blood gas analysis was calculated in the same manner. follow-up phone calls were made every week after discharge until 28 days after inclusion. the effect of oxygen therapy on time to death was assessed using the chi-square test. a P value of 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. all patients aged 18 years or older were screened. fiO2 and SpO2 were recorded every six hours until 14 days. the primary outcome was 28-day mortality. the secondary outcome was ICU mortality. continuous data were expressed as the mean SD or median interquartile range (IQR) for each continuous variable, normality was determined by two-way analysis of variance. an unpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test was used to evaluate differences between groups. median [IQR], year 56 [46\u201369] 60 [46\u201369] 0.595 58 [46\u201372] 60 [46\u201368] 0.952 Gender (female) 31 (31.0) 45 (40.4) 0.205 26 (33.3) 35 (38.9) 0.455 APACHE II, median [IQR] 17 [12\u201321] 17 [12\u201322] 0.302 17 [12\u201321] 18 [13\u201321] 0.298 Type of admission 0.516 the time-weighted SpO2 average during the ICU stay was significantly lower in the low SpO2 group than in the high SpO2 group. the time-weighted FiO2 average was significantly lower in the low SpO2 group than in the high SpO2 group median IQR: 33 [25\u201342] vs. 42 [36\u201350], P0.001 (Table 2).

ITT analysis 72-hour subgroup analysis.
