{"summary": "OP is an inflammatory lung disease characterized by proliferation of granulation tissue in the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar duct, and alveoli with or without obliteration of distal bronchioles. it can develop secondarily for many reasons, such as infections (including mainly bacteria and viruses), connective tissue disease, hematological disorders, malignancies, use of certain drugs. leukocytes, 11,170/mm3 (segmented neutrophils, 84.9%; lymphocytes, 11.2%); hemoglobin 9.5 g/dL; hematocrit, 27.6%; and platelets, 246,000/mm3. chest radiography revealed ill-defined multifocal consolidations with bronchial wall thickening and air-bronchogram in both lungs. intravenous antibiotic therapy was initiated with piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin. an initial sputum culture was negative, as was sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear. on the 7th hospital day, her chest radiography was more aggravated. a drug susceptibility test revealed that the isolate was susceptible to clarithromycin. she was started on intravenous amikacin, cefoxitin, and oral azithromycin. after 8 weeks of the anti-mycobacterial therapy, improvement was detected on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and radiologic images. tatic disease, solitary pulmonary nodules, and hot tub lung (7) have been reported. OP showed dramatic clinical improvement with corticosteroid and anti-mycobacterial treatment. both cases were successfully treated with corticosteroids and corticosteroids. hot tub lung as a hypersensitivity-like disease is similar to hypersensitivity pneumonitis with respect to its clinical and radiological presentation. the typical chest CT findings of hot tub lung are centrilobular nodules and/or ground-glass opacities (7,11,12) pulmonary M. abscessus infection accompanied by OP has not been described in the english language literature. pulmonary M. abscessus infection can present different clinicopathological features according to the various immune responses of the host."}
