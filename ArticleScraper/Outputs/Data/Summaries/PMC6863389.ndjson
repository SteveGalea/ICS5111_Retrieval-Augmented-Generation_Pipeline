{"summary": "immune responses to oral cholera, poliovirus (PV) and rotavirus (RV) vaccines are significantly lower in children from LMICs than those of children from HICs. only 58% of Nicaraguan and 46% of Bangladeshi children respond to oral RV vaccine while the efficacy of the vaccine in Finland is over 98% [3, 4, 5] a combination of gut microbiome alterations associated with negative health effects is known as intestinal or enteric dysbiosis. a combination of gut microbiome alterations associated with negative health effects is known as intestinal or enteric dysbiosis. systemically immunized GF and antibiotic treated conventional mice showed decreased serum Ab and T-cell responses compared to the age-matched conventional animals. the introduction of the normal microbiota to the GF mice improved their immune responsiveness following immunization [29\u2022\u2022] cellular T cell responses in HMA piglets vaccinated with HRV vaccine did not translate into increased Ab levels. findings contrast to previous study from the same group that demonstrated that LGG supplementation enhanced HRV Ab responses in GF piglets [35]. protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) decreased the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroides ratios post-challenge, which coincided with increased abundance of Proteus in the gut. decreased levels of Turicibacter were observed in spleen and ileum [44], which coincided with suppression of multiple innate and adaptive immune responses. vitamin A deficiency (VAD) affects millions of children in LMICs. the gut microbiota, through its effects on bile acids [58], short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and cholesterol metabolism in the gut lumen, can in turn affect intake and metabolism of all fat-soluble vitamins. zinc deficiency is linked with poor vaccine responses and can modify the composition of the microbiota. commensal microbiota regulates the state of hypo-responsiveness against commensals, self-antigens, and food antigens. exposure to commensal microbiota has a greater influence on TLR mRNA expression than age. gastrointestinal microbiota, RV vaccines and histo-blood group antigens are recognized as receptors by numerous pathogens, including, noroviruses, RVs, and coronaviruses. the severity of RV disease is reportedly higher in children with blood group A. the polymorphic HBGAs are found on red blood cells, mucosal epithelia and in biologic fluids of secretor individuals. the nonsecretor homozygous genotype in fucosyltransferase 2 (FUT2; occurring due to natural polymorphisms) is associated with resistance to noV genogroup II and Helicobacter pylori infections that vary with ethnicities. probiotic impacts on vaccine responses have historically underperformed in the LMICs. supplementation with specific strains of probiotics has been shown to have modulatory effects on intestinal and systemic immune responses. probiotics also affect the functions of IECs through modulation of tight junctions, increasing mucin and defensin production. probiotic and commensal bacteria possess immunomodulatory/antiviral [1\u2022\u2022,71,73] and vaccine adjuvant [112,113,120,121,128\u2022] properties. despite extensive research and plentiful novel data, there still is a need for improved understanding of the role of microbiota in the immune responses to vaccines. conflict of interest statement Nothing declared. references and recommended reading Papers of particular interest have been highlighted as: \u2022 of special interest \u2022\u2022 of outstanding interest."}
