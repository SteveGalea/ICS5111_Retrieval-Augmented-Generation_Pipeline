{"summary": "ICU survivors responded to a survey 3 months (n = 118) and 1 year (n = 89) after ICU discharge. social support was positively associated with mental HRQOL at 3 months and 1 year. pain interference was associated with the largest reduction in HRQOL. ICU survivors may experience sleep deprivation [2\u20134], pain [5], discomfort [6], delirium [5], and physical deterioration [7]. all of these experiences, and the critical illness itself, may negatively be associated with HRQOL long after their ICU stay [8\u201316]. research has shown that preexisting disease or comorbidity has a negative impact on HRQOL. ICU survivors from two mixed surgical and medical ICUs were included. ICU survivors aged 18 years or older with an ICU stay longer than 48 hours were invited to participate. the score is based on respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and cognitive failure. a higher SOFA score indicates a higher level of organ failure and a higher risk of death. the score is based on respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and cognitive failure. four common comorbidities (headache, skin diseases, bowel diseases, and muscular diseases) were added to the standard 13. only the total number of comorbidities was used in our analyses, but the most common comorbidities are presented. a reduction of 5.0 in PCS and MCS score was considered clinical relevant in this present study. the revised SPS consists of 16 assertions about social support that may apply to the individual. a high score indicates a high level of social support [43]. pain interference with the seven functional domains was rated on a numerical rating scale from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes) only patients who gave informed consent participated; written consent was administered 3 months after ICU discharge. the ICU survivors who consented to participate got the questionnaire, study information in writing and informed consent by mail. the first author (AKL) used ICU electronic medical records to collect information on diagnosis, length of ICU stay, days on ventilation, and disease severity. the SOFA score is based on respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and cognitive failure. a higher SOFA score indicates a higher level of organ failure and a higher risk of death. a higher SOFA score indicates a higher level of organ failure and a higher risk of death. the SF-12 PCS and MCS are calculated using norm-based data from the 1998 general US population. the mean cutoff score of 50 means that if the study sample scores a mean value for PCS below 50, then they have reduced physical health compared with the general population. higher summary scores indicate better HRQOL. the revised SPS has been shown to be valid and reliable for use with older adults living in Norway [43], and the original SPS has been used in studies of pregnant women, first time mothers and schoolteachers [46]. the primary differences between the original and revised SPS are the decrease from six to four provisions, respectively, and a change in total score from 96 in the original. the SOFA score is based on respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal, and cognitive failure. a higher SOFA score indicates a higher level of organ failure and a higher risk of death. a higher SOFA score indicates a higher level of organ failure and a higher risk of death. the SF-12 consists of 12 questions about eight health concepts. physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, energy/fatigue, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. the SF-12 PCS and MCS are calculated using norm-based data from the 1998 general US population. the total SPS score is calculated by summing the scores of the four provisions (maximum score 64) the revised SPS has been shown to be valid and reliable for use with older adults living in Norway [43] the original SPS has been used in studies of pregnant women, first time mothers, and schoolteachers [46] the study was approved by the Hospital Data Inspectorate and the Regional Committees for Medical Research Ethics in Norway. only patients who gave informed consent participated; written consent was administered 3 months after ICU discharge. the two interference items with the highest mean scores were 'interference with normal work' and 'interference with daily activity' after ICU discharge. both mean scores increased slightly compared with 1 year. the improvement in PCS scores from 3 months to 1 year was statistically significant (p 0.01) but the small improvement in MCS scores did not reach the level of statistical significance (Table 2). Changes in social support and health-related quality of life from 3 months to 1 year after intensive care unit discharge. only attachment was statistically significant negatively associated with PCS at 3 months (p = 0.02) and a positively associated with MCS at 1 year (p = 0.03) there was a statistically significant reduction in total SPS scores from 3 months to 1 year, and in attachment from 3 months to 1 year (p = 0.03) 0.34 [\u20130.14, 0.82] 0.17 Reassurance of worth 0.64 [\u20130.84; 2.13] 0.39 0.48 [\u20130.78; 1.73] 0.45 Attachment \u20130.41 [\u20131.58; 0.76] 0.49 1.09 [\u20130.85; 1.02] 0.85 \u20130.08 [\u20130.87; 0.71] 0.84 Social integration \u20130.33 [\u20132.03; 1.36] 0.01 \u20130.50 [\u20131.92; 0.93] 0.49 Number of the mean age of the sample was 55.1 years (SD 14.4), 63.6% (n = 75) were male, 62.7% (n = 74) were married or had a partner, and 77.1% (n = 91) had children (either young or adult children) the mean SAPS II and SOFA score was 44.9 (SD 16) and 8.8 (SD 3.4), respectively. the median number of days on a ventilator in the ICU was 6.0 (IQR ICU survivors had a clinically relevant reduction in HRQOL PCS scores (mean 39.3, SD 10.9) and a minor reduction in HRQOL MCS scores (mean 47.7, SD 10.9) at 3 months. at 1 year, the mean PCS score increased to 43.4 (SD 12.0), and the mean MCS score normalized at 49.3 (SD 10.3) SF-12 PCS score 39.3 (10.9) 43.4 (12.0) 0.01 MCS score 47.7 (10.9) 49.3 (10.3) 0.43 SD = standard deviation, 95% CI = 95% confidence interval, SF-12 version 1 Physical component summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) relative to 1998 US Population baseline, SPS = revised Social Provision Scale. 0.10 Nurturance -0.19 [\u20130.97; 0.59] 0.64 0.28 [\u20130.53; 1.08] 0.50 Social integration 0.51 [\u20131.02; 2.04] 0.51 0.61 [\u20130.98; 2.19] 0.45 Number of comorbidities \u20132.44 [\u20133.74; \u20131.14] 0.01 \u20131.19 [\u2013\u20132.53; 0.16] 0.08 Pain int.\u2013Daily activity -10.92 [\u201314.61 pain interference with both normal work and daily activity was associated with a clinically relevant and statistically significant reduction in PCS. only one of the provisions, attachment, was statistically significantly associated with PCS at 3 months and 1 year after ICU discharge, but only a minor reduction in MCS. social support decreased from 3 months to 1 years. at 3 months, the survivors were still in a rehabilitation situation. at 1 year, this need for support may have normalized. if we compare our data with those of first time mothers, it appears that our survivors perceived a higher level of total social support. number of comorbidities was statistically significantly associated with PCS at both time points and on MCS at 1 year. orwelius et al. found that preexisting disease had a significant influence on HRQOL after an ICU stay. the theory of response shift may be the reason here [62]. previous research has found that HRQOL improves even from ICU discharge to hospital discharge. early mobilization in the ICU seems to be one way of improving physical HRQOL after an ICU stay. there is still no high-quality intervention to improve HRQOL in ICU survivors. we did not have pre-admission baseline measurements with which to compare HRQOL and social support, number of comorbidities, and pain interference. previous studies have shown that this population has lower HRQOL than the normative population, even before their ICU stay [8, 17]. docx."}
