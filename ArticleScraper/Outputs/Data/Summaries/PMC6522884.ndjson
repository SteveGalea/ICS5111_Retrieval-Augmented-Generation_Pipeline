{"summary": "chemotherapeutic drugs used to treat breast cancer include: anthracyclines, doxorubicin, epirubicin, taxanes, cyclophosphamide, capecitabine, 5-fluorouracil, vinorelbine, gemcitabine, trastuzumab and other anti-hormone drugs. an inappropriate combination of chemotherapy may not be able to treat or reduce the spread of breast cancer, and may continuously destroy other dividing cells. the conventional drug screening process can be divided into two main stages: Discovery and development (7\u201311) the discovery stage can be further divided into early discovery, lead identification and lead optimization before the selected candidates proceed to the preclinical screening stages. a yeast-based assay was transformed with a plasmid expressing DNA topoisomerase I (TOPOI), namely SMD1168H-TOPOI. a cost-effective approach is required to overcome these limitations. the use of a yeast-based assay is more versatile, as it allows for the screening of a larger number of compounds without the need for cell culture facilities. the assay was designed to have the following characteristics: i) Easy to operate with no special skill required; ii) no specific equipment is required; iii) the yeast cell density is the main component of the assay. a short amount of time is required to complete the full assay (1 week) a small volume of the sample was withdrawn from the treated culture every 12 h for cell density measurement. methanol was added every 24 h, and camptothecin was added to the culture instead of glutamate. the yeast culture treated with camptothecin was compared with the performance of the drug in a cell-based MTT assay. the assay was conducted to examine the effect of camptothecin on various human cell lines and compare it with the effect in yeast cells. camptothecin solution was added to each well for 24 h. the reaction was incubated for 4 h. the solution was carefully removed without disturbing the formazan crystals. assay was designed to have the following characteristics: i) Easy to operate with no special skill required; ii) no specific equipment is required; iii) the yeast cell density is the main component of the assay; iii) no additional detection kit, enzyme or reagent is needed other than the chemical, medium and reagent to maintain the yeast cells. a small volume of the sample was withdrawn from the treated yeast culture every 12 h for cell density measurement. methanol was added every 24 h, and camptothecin was added to the culture instead of glutamate. similar to glutamate-treated cells, samples were withdrawn from the culture. camptothecin was compared with the performance of the drug in a cell-based MTT assay. the cell lines used in this assay included highly metastatic breast cancer cells, weakly metastatic CAL-27 oral cancer and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. all cell lines used in the present study were previously purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. in solution, 24 l reagent (5 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) was added to each well. the reaction was carefully removed without disturbing the formazan crystals. the intensity of the colour in the plate was measured at 570 nm. yeast cell density is the main component of the assay. a short amount of time is required to complete the full assay (1 week) no additional detection kit, enzyme or reagent is required. a small volume of the sample was withdrawn from the treated yeast culture every 12 h for cell density measurement. methanol was added every 24 h and camptothecin (97% purity; Sigma-Aldrich; serving as a growth antagonist) was added. a cell-based MTT assay was conducted to examine the effect of camptothecin on various human cell lines. the cell lines used included highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, weakly metastatic CAL-27 oral cancer and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. all cell lines used in the present study were previously purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. at the end of each incubation period, 24 l MTT reagent (5 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) was added to each well and the reaction was incubated for 4 h. the solution was carefully removed without disturbing the formazan crystals that had formed in each well. a similar growth profile was observed when the SMD1168H was transformed with the empty pPICZA plasmid (SMD1168H-pPICZA) the cell density was significantly increased at 24 h (1.502 units; P0.01) and then reduced to 1.717 units at 48 h (P0.01) the cell density reached the lowest level of 0.747 units at 72 h (P0.05), which was lower than the minimal level observed for normal SMD1168H. untreated SMD1168H-TOPOI, glutamate-treated SMD1168H-toPOI, glutamate-treated SMD1168H-pPICZA, glutamate-treated SMD1168H-toPOI, camptothecin-treated SMD1168H-pPICZA and (I) camptothecin-treated SMD1168H-toPOI exhibited a significantly higher cell density of 1.316 units at 24 h compared the growth profile of the glutamate-treated SMD1168H-TOPOI was not as expected. the cell density reached 1.487 units at 60 h of cultivation, similar to the SMD1168H and SMD1168H-pPICZA. the growth of these three yeast types was slightly stunted. the growth of the yeast was reduced to 1.389 units. camptothecin treatment of SMD1168H-TOPOI was expected to reduce the yeast cell density. however, this treatment did not entirely inhibit the yeast growth. camptothecin only produced a typical dose-response in MDA-MB-231 cells treated for 24 h (hillslope=2.42; maximum response, 50%), 48 h (hillslope=0.65; maximum response, 25%) and 72 h (hillslope=1.28; maximum response, 25%; Fig. 3C) the cell density of the yeast strain SMD1168H was gradually increased after 36 h of cultivation (1.306 units; P0.05) following this peak, the cell density was reduced from 60 h of cultivation and onwards, with the yeast growth reaching the lowest level of 0.873 units at 72 h. similar growth profile was observed when SMD1168H was transformed with the empty pPICZA plasmid (SMD1168H-pPICZA) cell density of glutamate-treated SMD1168H reached optimum level of 1.511 units at 36 h (P0.01), 1.520 units (P0.01) and 1.600 units (P0.01) at 48, 60 and 72 h of cultivation. the growth of the yeast reached 1.351 units at 24 h (P0.05) and an optimum level at 1.492 units at 36 h of cultivation. the cell densities were 1.545 units (P0.01), 1.520 units (P0.01) and 1.546 units (P0.01) at 48, 60 and 72 h. camptothecin-treated SMD1168H-pPICZA, a similar growth profile was observed. the growth of the yeast was reduced to 1.389 units. the growth continued at this level until 72 h of cultivation. camptothecin only produced a logistic dose-response in CAL-27 cells. treatment was performed for 72 h (hillslope=2.42; maximum response, 50%), 48 h (hillslope=0.65; maximum response, 25%) and 72 h (hillslope=1.28) cells were subjected to treatment with camptothecin for 24, 48 and 72 h. cell density of untreated SMD1168H was gradually increased after 36 h of cultivation. similar growth profile was observed when SMD1168H was transformed with the empty pPICZA plasmid. cell density at 60 h (1.774 units; P0.001) and 72 h (1.504 units; P0.01) remained significantly higher compared with the 12 h group. cell density of glutamate-treated SMD1168H and its recombinant forms reached an. the cell densities were 1.551 units (P0.01), 1.520 units (P0.01) and 1.600 units (P0.01) at 48, 60 and 72 h of cultivation. the growth of the yeast reached 1.351 units at 24 h (P0.05) and an optimum level at 1.492 units at 36 h of cultivation. camptothecin-treated SMD1168H and its recombinant forms treated with 100 M camptothecin for 72 h showed a similar optimum level of cell density as glutamate-treated SMD1168H. the treated yeast was still capable of maintaining a cell density of 1.340 units at 24 h of cultivation (P0.05) but the cell density was reduced to 1.225 units, and the growth was gradually maintained at this level until 72 h. treatment of MCF-10a cells with camptothecin for 72 h did not produce a typical dose-response curve. no typical dose-response was observed in CAL-27 cells. camptothecin only produced a logistic dose-response in CAL-27 cells. recombinant yeast SMD1168H-TOPOI was treated with camptothecin for 72 h. reduced growth at 48 h of treatment may be due to by-product accumulation in the culture. cell density or growth inhibition can be used as the parameter for measuring the effect of a compound on the yeast. a similar strategy has been used to enable high-throughput screening for novel pharmacological modulators of K+ channels. e Plasmodium falciparum (PfENT1) was detected based on their ability to rescue the growth of Xenopus cyclin A1-expressing fui1 yeast in the presence of a cytotoxic PfENT1 substrate, 5-fluorouridine. the data supported the hypothesis that blocking purine transport through PfENT1 may be a novel and compelling approach for antimalarial drug development (18). yeast-based assay requires 6 days to complete, whereas cell-based tests typically require >7 days. the yeast-based assay was developed when constructing Pichia with multiple copy numbers of TOPOI for the expression and purification of the target enzyme. activators of caspase-3 and caspase-7 (23) were followed by evaluation of the activity of the selected compounds in two human tumour cell lines. this was followed by evaluation of the activity of the selected compounds in two human tumour cells. similar yeast-based assays have been used as platforms for screening and identifying various types of compounds. yeast-based assay for monitoring GAr-dependent inhibition of translation was established and identified doxorubicin as a compound that specifically interferes with the GAr effect on translation in yeast. this approach was validated as an effective high-throughput screening assay for the identification of drugs that interfere with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune evasion and may be candidates for treating EBV-associated diseases. yeast-based screening bioassays have been used to detect selective oestrogen receptor modulators and selective androgen receptor modulators. also used to screen commercial chemical libraries to identify PDE7 inhibitors (32), to robustly identify new lead compounds targeting specific enzymes and to detect the toxicity of human CA isozyme II inhibitors. uents are rich in androgenic chemicals, and this detection system could be applicable as a primary screening method for inhibitors/activators of AR functions (35). a sensitive, fast and user-friendly progesterone receptor transactivation assay was established using recombinant S. cerevisiae that was modified to express green fluorescent protein driven by human PR. a yeast-based system is cost-effective, fast, easy to operate and efficient for compound screening. this system is expected to overcome certain limitations of the cell-based proliferation assays, while maintaining similar screening functions. authors would like to thank the Ministry of Higher Education of Malaysia for the scholarship awarded to the students working on this project. all authors have read and approved the final version of the manuscript. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
