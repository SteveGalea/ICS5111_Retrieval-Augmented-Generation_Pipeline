{"summary": "the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRSV) is caused by a RNA virus. it is caused by weak live-born pigs, severe pneumonia, reduction in growth performances, mortality, and abortions. at least two genotypes of PRRSV can be distinguished: PRRSV type 1 (with different sub-types), which comprises strains from Europe. pre-infection with PRRSV has been shown to induce a higher mortality rate compared to those infected by either PRRSV or S. suis alone. piglets born from PRRSV-infected gestating sows were also shown to be more susceptible to a subsequent S. suis infection. the effect of PRRSV on the phagocytosis and intracellular survival of both cell types was first assessed. a genomic approach was then used to compare the gene expression profiles, mainly those involved in inflammation, of both cell types infected with S. suis. the bacterial pellet was resuspended and adjusted to a concentration of 5 x 108 Colony Forming Units (CFU)/ml. the bacterial pellet was resuspended and adjusted to a concentration of 5 x 108 Colony Forming Units (CFU)/ml. the virus stock was obtained by freezing and thawing MA104-derived monkey kidney (MARC-145) cells infected with the PRRSV. PBMCs were incubated for 20 min with anti-human CD14 microbeads. hematopoietic cells were isolated from the femur bone marrow of four different animals. cells were cultured in complete RPMI-1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. medium was removed and replaced with 300 l of serum-free complete RPMI with PRRSV IAF-Klop (MOI of 0.1) for 2 h. the wells were washed twice with PBS to remove free virus. 1 ml of complete RPMI was added to each well. phagocytosis was added to each well and phagocytosis was left to proceed for 30 min, 60 min or 90 min. for each incubation time, extracellular bacteria were killed by adding penicillin G (5 g/ml) and gentamicin for 1 h. incubation time was chosen based on preliminary data of the kinetics of eight pro-inflammatory genes evaluated by qRT-PCR. shorter incubation times showed low and inconsistent results. each RNA sample was divided into two aliquots that were kept at -80\u00b0C until use. the real-time qPCR experiments were performed on a CFX-96 rapid thermal cycler system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using gene-specific primers (250 nM) and the SsoFast Evagreen supermix kit (Bio-Rad) the cycling conditions were 3 min of polymerase activation at 98\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles at 98\u00b0C for 2 s and 57\u00b0C for 5 s. Gene Genbank accession no. /Reference Amplicon size (bp) forward (F) and Reverse (R) primers Il6 NM_214399 105 F: TGGCATCTCTCCACAAGCGCCTT R: TGGCATCTTCTTCC Cxcl8 NW_003300390 80 F: TGTGAGGCTGCGT Tnf NM_214022 112 F: GCCACCACGCTCTTCTGCCTA R: ACGAGA a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) assay was performed to compare viral replication in monocytes and BMDCs. a Wilcoxon matched-pairs ranked test was performed to compare the groups. ANOVA was used to search for differentially expressed genes between infected and mock-infected groups. differentially expressed genes were defined by fold changes greater than 2-folds or smaller than 0.5 fold with an accompanying P-value 0.05. all experiments were conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines and policies of the Canadian Council of Animal Care. the wild-type virulent S. suis serotype 2 strain P1/7 has been widely used in previous studies. pig blood from four different animals was collected in 10 ml EDTA-coated vacutainers. the buffy coat resuspended in 7.5% PBS-EDTA and layered on a 60% FICOLL-PAQUE\u00ae Plus gradient. monocytes were further isolated as described elsewhere. cells (5 x 105 cells/ml) were cultured in 10 ml of complete medium at 37\u00b0C. half of the medium was removed and replaced with fresh complete medium containing rpGM-CSF. the PRRSV RT-qPCR results were expressed in cycle threshold (Ct) for co-infection experiments, cells were infected with PRRSV. after 2 h of infection, cells were washed with PBS. a lower bacterial MOI was used for microarray assays. toxicity killed more than 75% of cells at 12 h of incubation. for each incubation time, extracellular bacteria were killed by adding penicillin G (5 g/ml) and gentamicin (100 g/ml) for 1 h. cells were then washed three times with PBS and the last wash kept as a control to ensure all extracellular bacteria were killed. one ml of sterile water was then added to each well in order to lyse the cells. Agilent microarray analysis RNA samples were sent to the McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre (Montr\u00e9al, Quebec, Canada) before performing the microarray analysis, RNA sample quality and quantity were assessed using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies) the microarray was performed as per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and the samples were randomly distributed on the chips. were 3 min of polymerase activation at 98\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles at 98\u00b0C for 2 s and 57\u00b0C for 5 s. the sequences of the primers (Integrated DNA technologies, Coralville, IA) used for qPCR are shown in Table 1 and were verified to have reaction efficiencies between 90% and 110%. a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) assay was performed to compare viral replication in monocytes and BMDCs. data are presented as the mean standard error of the mean. 0.05 was considered statistically significant for microarray data analysis. text files containing the signal and detection P-values per probe for each sample were imported into FlexArray software v.1.6.2. data were then processed using a variance-stabilizing normalization filter. for RT-qPCR analysis, fold-changes of gene expression were calculated using the CFX software manager v.3.0 (Bio-Rad) samples from mock-infected cells were used as calibrator. results were analyzed using Sigmaplot 12.5 (Systat, Chicago, IL), and ANOVA was performed to measure statistical differences between groups. the RT-qPCR values corresponded to an increase from 102 at 0 h to almost 105 TCID50/ml in BMDCs after 16 of infection. between 16 h and 24 h of culture, PRRSV replication reached a plateau in BMDCs, whereas for monocytes, a delayed but continuous viral replication was observed after 16 h. viral load was still lower than that of BMDCs. monocytes were able to very weakly phagocyte S. suis. no difference was seen in number of internalized bacteria when cells were pre-infected with PRRSV. the number of internalized bacteria in monocytes was too low to perform intracellular survival studies. the data were normalized and a value of 100% was set for the number of surviving bacteria found after 1 h of internalization. after 3 h, half of the bacteria were killed and no difference was observed between PRRSV-infected and mock-infected BMDCs. monocytes infected by S. suis alone showed more down-regulated (144) than up-regulated (68) genes. most of these genes were also regulated in monocytes infected with S. suis alone. general response to virus infection was higher in BMDCs than in monocytes. unsupervised hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes was performed with BMDCs and monocytes. clustering of the genes showed different patterns of gene regulation in co-infected BMDCs compared to S. suis-infected BMDCs. most genes regulated during co-infection were, in fact, regulated by S. suis. genes associated with transcriptional and translational regulation were found to be down-regulated in co-infected or S. suis-infected BMDCs. down-regulated genes were mostly observed in monocytes activated by S. suis in the presence of PRRSV. bacterial infection induced overexpression of IL-6, TNF-, IL-1, IL-15, IL-12p40, and IL-23p19. PTGS2 (COX-2), another pro-inflammatory gene involved in the prostaglandin pathway, was also induced in BMDCs (and to a lesser extent in monocytes) type I IFNs (genes coding for IFN- and IFN-) were highly up-regulated by PRRSV. similar levels were observed in co-infected BMDCs. IFN- expression was also clearly up-regulated by S. suis. expression of DDX58 and IFIH1, two members of the RLRs family, coding for RIG-I and MDA5, which are cytoplasmic sensors of viral infections. the triggering of these receptors leads to the production of type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines. expression levels of selected genes found to be differentially expressed by Agilent microarray assay were confirmed using real-time qPCR. 3.8 35.9 51.8 qPCR 6.6 2.2 117.8 63.2 150.5 67.2 CXCL8 Microarray 1.5 6.6 7.0 qPCR 1.9 0.4 11.6 4.0 10.1 2.4 IL-12p40 Microarray 1.9 3.3 5.7 qPCR 2.7 0.4 2.9 0.7 7.1 2.4 IL-23p19 Microarray 1.8 26.4 29.2 qPCR 2.6 0.4 2.9 0.7 7.1 2.4 IL BMDCs are more susceptible than monocytes to PRRSV infection. preliminary studies with different bacterial/virus ratios and incubation times were tested. higher virus or bacterial concentration resulted in high toxicity for cells. BMDCs are more permissive to the virus (P 0.05) porcine BMDCs and porcine monocytes were cultured for 2 h in presence of PRRSV virus before washing the cells to remove extracellular virus (t = 0 h) cells were then cultured for an additional 16 h and 24 h and PRRSV genome RNA was determined using RT-qPCR and expressed in cycle threshold (Ct) the number of non-encapsulated S. suis were internalized by porcine monocytes at all incubation times. however, the number of ingested bacteria was not modified by a PRRSV-pre-infection. the results show the percentage of viable bacteria, 100% being the number of viable bacteria recovered after 1 h of culture. a prior infection with PRRSV would weakly but significantly impair the uptake of bacteria by porcine DCs, but it does not have any effect on S. suis killing following phagocytosis. earlier incubation times presented low and inconstant results and longer incubation times revealed high cell toxicity. general response to virus infection was higher in BMDCs than in monocytes (135 and 16 genes modulated, respectively) these results reflect the relatively low response of monocytes, which was probably the consequence of a lower viral infection rate. genes differentially expressed in porcine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (A) or monocytes (B) were subjected to hierarchical clustering using the complete linkage method. each row represents a different gene and columns represent individual samples from mock-, S. suis-, PRRSV- or PRRSV/S. suis-infected cells from 3 different animals. BMDCs showed a clear upregulation of CCL3L1, CCL4/MIP-1 and CCL14/HCC-1 (known to attract and/or activate monocytes, macrophages and/or immature DCs), CCL5/RANTES, and CCL8/MCP-2 (chemotactic for monocytes, macrophages, immature DCs, basophils, and activated T cells) and CCL20/MIP-3 (chemot the bacterial infection induced the overexpression of IL-6, TNF-, IL-1, IL-15, IL-12p40, and IL-23p19 (the two last being the two subunits of IL-23). an additive effect could be observed for inflammatory mediators such as CCL4, CCL14, CCL20, and IL-15. PRRSV pre-infection of cells did not influence activation of such genes by S. suis. some genes implicated in the inflammatory response were downregulated following stimulation by S. suis or both pathogens. genes associated with host defense were up-regulated in BMDCs. expression levels of selected genes found to be differentially expressed by Agilent microarray assay were confirmed using real-time qPCR analysis. the expression of 10 genes upregulated in BMDCs were studied (Table 2). 3 of these genes (IL-12p40, IL-23p19 and CCL20) were also tested in monocytes. 4.7 1.6 2.4 0.6 8.3 3.6 TNF Microarray 8.6 26.5 45.1 qPCR 10.6 3.1 19.7 5.6 42.5 11.8 IFN- Microarray 300.9 10.9 308.7 qPCR 853.1 286.1 17.1 6.3 696.8 240.9 CCL20 Microarray 6.5 37.3 47.5 qPCR 8.2 1.8 40.0 16.2 57.4 18.9 COX-2 Microarray 6.5 5.3 11.0 qPCR 10. inflammatory genes may be affected during a co-infection. in the bloodstream, PRRSV comes in contact with both cell populations. BMDC were clearly more permissive to virus replication than monocytes. a pre-infection of pulmonary alveolar macrophages with PRRSV induced either a decreased activity or had no impact on their ability to ingest and kill haemophilus parasuis. no study had been carried out with PRRSV/S. suis co-infected cells. results from the present study are in vitro, while in vivo, other factors may also influence the phagocytosis of bacteria by professional phagocytic cells the innate immune response is the first line of defense against infection. this is the first report of a clear up-regulation of type I IFN genes by porcine DCs infected with S. suis. BMDCs infected by S. suis induce the up-regulation of potent inflammatory mediators. a clear additional or synergistic effect on the expression of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines could be observed when compared to cells infected by a single pathogen. arachidonic acid is an unsaturated fatty acid that is released from the plasma membrane by phospholipases in response to several activation stimuli. it is then metabolized by cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases to generate prostaglandins (PG) the inducible enzyme COX-2 (PTGS2 gene) is known to contribute to the acute phase of inflammation, especially by catalysing PGE2 production. the results of the present study are the first step in understanding the immunological mechanisms explaining the higher susceptibility of PRRSV-infected animals to S. suis. in vivo studies, currently underway, will help to better understand the mechanisms involved during co-infections with these two important swine pathogens. porcine monocytes infected with PRRSV, S. suis, or co-infected with both pathogens for 12 h compared to mock-infected cells."}
