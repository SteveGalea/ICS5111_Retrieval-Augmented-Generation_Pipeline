{"summary": "protein science published a review entitled \"Natively unfolded proteins: a point where biology waits for physics\" the title of the review was inspired by the observations that many of such \u201cstructure-less\u201d proteins analyzed by that time acted as \u201cbinders\u201d that did undergo at least partial folding after interaction with their binding partners. structure\u2013function paradigm is the \u201cBig Bang\u201d created universe of the modern protein science. some major directions based on the consideration of protein function as lock-and-key mechanism are shown. wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift. a protein and its tertiary fold, are weak and can be broken even at ambient temperatures due to thermal fluctuations. the breaking of these weak interactions releases the groups that were involved in these interactions and gives them the possibility to be involved in the formation of new weak interactions of comparable energy. authors often invented new terms to describe protein of interest. floppy, pliable, rheomorphic, flexible,18 mobile,19 partially folded,20 natively denatured,21 natively unfolded,12,22 natively unfolded,15 intrinsically unstructured,11,14 intrinsically denatured,21 intrinsically unfolded,13 vulnerable,23 chameleon,24 malleable,24 protein clouds. the idea gave a new boost to the development of the protein science, generating a wide array of principally novel research directions. the goals of this review are: (i) to outline some recent advances in the field of IDPs/IDPRs. compact proteins and extended IDPs can be distinguished based only on their net charges and hydropathies. more detailed comparison of amino acid sequences revealed that in comparison with ordered proteins, the IDPs/IDPRs are significantly depleted in order-promoting amino acids. in 2002, the list of experimentally validated natively unfolded proteins with chain length greater than 50 amino acid residues contained more than 100 entries. it was pointed out that this list would probably be doubled if shorter polypeptides 30\u201350 residues long were included. a gap in the plot of fraction of disordered residues on proteome size parallels a morphological gap between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. this sharp jump in the disorder content in proteomes associated with the transition from prokaryotic to eukaryotic cells suggests that the increase in the morphological complexity of the cell paralleled the increased usage of intrinsic disorder. correlation between intrinsic disorder content and proteome size for 3484 species from viruses, archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. each symbol indicates a species; each symbol indicates a species. a foldable protein (or \u201cfoldable\u201d sequence space) is noticeably smaller than the entire sequence space available for a random polypeptide chain. for decades, the actual size of \u201cfoldable\u201d sequence space continues to be unsolved mystery. however, the actual number of different amino acid residues in a given foldable sequence can be dramatically reduced. the sequence space of IDPs is noticeably greater than the \u201cfoldable\u201d sequence space due to the removal of restrictions posed by the need to gain ordered structure spontaneously. a typical IDP/IDPR contains multiple, relatively short functional elements and therefore represents a very complex structural and functional mosaic. structural heterogeneity is determined by the fact that many proteins are hybrids of ordered and disordered domains and regions. many proteins are mostly unstructured or \u201cnatively unfolded\u201d polypeptide chains. a continuous emission spectrum representing the fact that functional proteins can extend from fully ordered to completely structure-less proteins. intrinsic disorder can have multiple faces, can affect different levels of protein structural organization, or various protein regions can be disordered to a different degree. structural space of functional proteins can be visualized to form a continuous spectrum of differently disordered conformations extending from fully ordered to completely structure-less proteins. other functional proteins may contain limited number of disordered regions (a grass-on-the-rock scenario), or have significant amount of disordered regions (a llama/camel hair scenario), or behave as pre-molten globules (a spaghetti-and-meatballs/sausage scenario) extended IDPs/IDPRs have its roots in the usual polymer physics of highly charged and flexible polypeptides. each protein is believed to be a unique entity that has quite unique primary sequence which governs its 3D structure (or lack thereof) and ensures specific biological function(s) the overall polymeric behavior of these proteins and regions can be mimicked reasonably well by the behavior of low-complexity polypeptides (e.g., homopolypeptide and block copolypeptides) water is a poor solvent for polypeptide backbone alone and for the IDPs containing long tracts of polar amino acid residues. IDPs/IDPRs from third class are strong polyampholytes characterized by high fractions of positively and/or negatively charged residues but have low per residue net charge. if such IDPs/IDPRs possess polyampholytic nature, their globular state could be additionally stabilized by electrostatic interactions between the oppositely charged side-chains. a comprehensive analysis of the hydrodynamic dimensions of FG-nucleoporins containing large IDPRs with multiple phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG-domains) revealed that under the physiologic conditions in vitro these domains adopt distinct categories of disordered structures, such as molten globule, pre-molten globule, relaxed-coil, extended-coil (as in urea) the behavior of extended IDPs is characterized by the low cooperativity (or the complete lack thereof) of the denaturant-induced unfolding, lack of the measurable excess heat absorption peak(s) characteristic for the melting of ordered proteins, \u201cturned out\u201d response to heat and changes in pH,96,99\u2013102. native coils and native pre-molten globules partially fold as the temperature is increased. TM protein predictor has limited accuracy and cannot predict disorder status of all protein sequences due to their heterogeneity. the first example is given by transmembrane (TM) proteins, in which disorder is widely observed. disorder is unevenly distributed between the cytoplasmic and the external surfaces of these proteins. integral membrane proteins commonly possess IDPRs defined as regions of missing electron density in their crystal structures. the use of specific amino acid signatures of IDPRs found in TM helical bundles and -barrels can potentially lead to significantly more accurate disorder predictions for these two classes of integral membrane proteins. the proteomes of such \u201csalt-in\u201d organisms are highly acidic,46,51. their proteins are characterized by remarkable instability at conditions of low salt concentrations and by maintaining soluble and active conformations in hypersaline conditions. viral proteomes have the largest variation of disorder content. these analyses were performed using the disorder predictors developed from structured and disordered regions found in water-soluble proteins. however, the major physicochemical properties of water-soluble and integral membrane proteins are very different due to the differences in their environments. archaeal proteins can be grouped into three classes, with ranges of the disordered residue content of 12\u201321%, 21%\u201332%, and 32%\u201338%. the archaeal proteomes with the highest disorder contents are halophiles and methanophiles. the archaeal proteomes with the highest disorder contents are halophiles and methanophiles. high predicted intrinsic disorder content in viruses has multiple functional implications. some IDPRs are used in the functioning of viral proteins and help viruses accommodate to their hostile habitats. others likely have evolved to help viruses manage their economic usage of genetic material via alternative splicing, overlapping genes, and anti-sense transcription. increased speed of interaction due to greater capture radius and the ability to spatially search through interaction space. Strengthened encounter complex allows for less stringent spatial orientation requirements. ability to be involved in many-to-one binding, where many distinct (structured) proteins may bind a single disordered region. IDP/IDPR may possess high specificity for given partners combined with high kon and koff rates that enable rapid association with the partner without an excessive binding strength. this combination of high specificity with low affinity defines the broad utilization of intrinsic disorder in regulatory interactions where turning a signal off is as important as turning it on. s/IDPRs were grouped in at least six broad classes based on the mode of action. 14,136 These broad classes included protein and RNA chaperones, entropic chains, effectors, scavengers, assemblers and display sites. a rich spectrum of biological functions associated with IDPs/IDPRs was found. high specificity coupled with low affinity is a useful pair of properties for a reversible signaling interaction. a disordered protein can readily bind to multiple partners by changing shape to associate with different targets. a new two-pathway protein structure\u2013function paradigm is given by The Protein Trinity Hypothesis. moonlighting proteins Moonlighting is the ability of a protein to fulfill more than one function. 137,166\u2013168 The ability of a protein to be involved in moonlighting or multi-tasking activities represents one of the solutions used by the Nature to increase the organism's complexity without the expansion of the genome size. protein hubs were grouped into two broad categories, \u201cdate hubs\u201d that bind their numerous partners sequentially, and \u201cparty hubs\u201d simultaneously interacting with their partners. hubs commonly use disordered regions to bind to multiple partners or many disordered region bind to one partner. scaffold protein includes a set of short globular domains (80 amino acids on average) connected by long linker regions (150 residues on average) with crucial binding functions. a typical design of a scaffold protein includes a set of short globular domains (80 amino acids on average) connected by long linker regions (150 residues on average) in the reprogramming TFs (the Yamanaka factors, namely Sox2, Oct3/4 (Pou5f1), Klf4, and c-Myc, and the Thomson factors, namely Sox2, Oct3, Lin28, and Nanog) overexpression of which is known to generate induced pluripotent stem cells from terminally differentiated somatic cells. one of the important examples of this regulatory role of intrinsic disorder is the canonical Wnt-pathway that involves five PCD includes several specific modules, such as apoptosis, autophagy, and programmed necrosis (necroptosis) these modules are tightly regulated but also intimately interconnected. these modules are jointly controlled via a complex set of protein\u2013protein interactions. enzymatic catalysis requires a well-organized environment in the active site of the enzyme in order to facilitate the formation of the transition state of the chemical reaction to be catalyzed. despite this crucial role of local flexibility, enzymes are still relatively stable molecules whose dynamic character is restricted to a small set of tightly folded conformations. molten globular mMjCM was shown to exist as a native molten globule. it was described as a dynamic ensemble of -helical conformers rapidly interconverting on the millisecond timescale. interaction with natural ligand induced global conformational changes in the molten globular mMjCM promoting formation of a defined enzyme\u2013ligand complex. IDPs are characterized by a very diverse range of binding modes, creating a multitude of unusual complexes. many of these complexes are not attainable by ordered proteins, many of which are not attainable by ordered proteins. the interface itself remains disordered in the bound state. it is also expected that the similar binding mode can be used by disordered protein while interacting with nucleic acids and other biological macromolecules. functional unfolding-activating factors include light, mechanical force, changes in pH, temperature, or redox potential. exposure to blue light results in activation of the photoactive yellow protein (PYP), an ordered, water-soluble 14 kDa protein that contains a thioester linked p-coumaric acid cofactor. d and short-lived signaling state of the PYP possessed a large degree of disorder. it existed as an ensemble of multiple conformers that exchange on a millisecond time scale. some proteins undergo local unfolding induced by the mechanical force. a portion of the \u201cfolding code\u201d that defines the ability of ordered proteins to spontaneously gain a unique biologically active structure is missing for IDPs/IDPRs. however, a missing portion of the \u201cfolding code\u201d (or a part of it) can be supplemented by binding partner(s) PRs provides them with a wide spectrum of exceptional functional advantages over the functional modes of ordered proteins and domains. increased speed of interaction due to greater capture radius and the ability to spatially search through interaction space. Strengthened encounter complex allows for less stringent spatial orientation requirements. IDP/IDPR may possess high specificity for given partners combined with high kon and koff rates that enable rapid association with the partner without an excessive binding strength. many disorder-related functions (e.g., signaling, control, and recognition) are incompatible with well-defined, stable 3-D structures. functionally, IDPs/IDPRs were grouped in at least six broad classes based on the mode of action. these broad classes included protein and RNA chaperones, entropic chains, effectors, assemblers and display sites. 11,13,15,71,72,78,79,130\u2013132,134,134,154\u2013157 When disordered regions bind to signaling partners, the free energy required to bring about the disorder to order transition takes away from the interfacial, contact free energy. high specificity coupled with low affinity is a useful pair of properties for a reversible signaling interaction. intrinsic disorder concept is a universal skeleton key (or lock-pick) that helps unlock seemingly unresolvable mysteries of protein science. ariadne's thread helps navigate the unusual twists of the sophisticated relationships between protein sequence, structure, and function, they are considered in some detail below. 137 Hub proteins Signaling interactions inside the cell can be described as specific and complex networks that can be considered as \u201cscale-free\u201d or \u201csmall-world\u201d networks. such networks combine the local clustering of connections characteristic of regular networks with occasional long-range connections between clusters. a typical design of a scaffold protein includes a set of short globular domains connected by long linker regions (150 residues on average) with crucial binding functions. a typical design of a scaffold protein includes a set of short globular domains (80 amino acids on average) connected by long linker regions. a number of interesting and important roles were also ascribed to intrinsic disorder in TFs related to the regulation of heat shock response (so called heat shock factors, HSFs)180. a number of important roles were also ascribed to intrinsic disorder in TFs related to the regulation of heat shock response. the process of the programmed cell death (PCD) is one of the most intricate cellular processes where the cell uses specialized cellular machinery and intracellular programs to kill itself. apoptosis, autophagy, and programmed necrosis (necroptosis) are tightly regulated but also intimately interconnected and are jointly controlled via a complex set of protein\u2013protein interactions. IDPs/IDPRs can use the same region or overlapping interaction regions/surfaces to exert distinct effects. such networks combine the local clustering of connections characteristic of regular networks with occasional long-range connections between clusters. the distance between nodes in these scale-free networks follows a power-law distribution. a bioinformatics analysis of several know hub proteins134 found that hubs commonly use disordered regions to bind to multiple partners. there are at least two primary mechanisms by which disorder is utilized in protein\u2013protein interaction networks where one disordered region binds to many partners. from 83 to 94% of TFs might possess long IDPRs, with the degree of disorder in eukaryotic TFs significantly higher than in prokaryotic TFs. eukaryotic TFs were shown to be depleted in order-promoting residues and enriched in disorder-promoting residues. adenomatous polyposis coli, also known as deleted in polyposis 2.5 protein), and -catenin (all shown to contain long IDPRs) this pathway is known to play a number of crucial roles in the development of organism, and the malfunctions of which might lead to various diseases including cancer. proteins involved in regulation and execution of PCD possess substantial amount of intrinsic disorder and IDPRs were implemented in a number of crucial functions. axiom constitutes a cornerstone of the lock-and-key paradigm and it seemed to be able to sustain the furious attack on protein structure\u2013function relationship. the presence of intrinsic disorder is expected to be poorly compatible with enzymatic catalysis. several enzymes were shown to be much more dynamic than the catalytic machines are expected to be, clearly possessing, many characteristic properties of molten globules. molten globules UreG is the only natural molten globular enzyme known to date. the number of known native molten globules with enzymatic activity is small. the number of known native molten globules with enzymatic activity is small. some of these complexes are relatively static, resemble complexes of ordered proteins. some IDPs/IDPRs do not fold even in their bound state, forming so-called disordered, dynamic, or fuzzy complexes. a disorder-to-order transition within the interaction interface cannot be described by the classical binding paradigm. this contradiction can be resolved assuming that the ordered binding partner and/or disordered protein contain multiple low affinity binding sites. the low affinity of each individual contact implies that each of them is not stable and can be readily broken. disordered, dynamic, or fuzzy complexes of IDPs are shown in supporting information Figure 1S. binding is considered as joining objects together and suggests spatial and temporal fixation of bound partners. the low affinity of each individual contact implies that each of them is not stable and can be readily broken. such disordered or fuzzy complex can be envisioned as a highly dynamic ensemble in which a disordered protein does not present a single binding site to its partner but resemble a \u201cbinding cloud\u201d. PYP is a bacterial blue light sensor that undergoes conformational changes upon signal transduction. the absorption of a photon triggers substantial protein unfolding. this leads to the formation of the transient signaling state that interacts with the partner molecules. structure satisfies DEER, SAXS/WAXS, and NMR data simultaneously. it consists of an open, twisted, 6-stranded, antiparallel -sheet, flanked by four -helices. the highly dynamic nature of IDPs and IDPRs is a visual illustration of the chaos. however, the evolutionary persistence of these highly dynamic proteins is a visual illustration of the chaos. IDPs were shown to be substrates of twice as many kinases as were ordered proteins. kinases whose substrates were IDPs were either regulated in a cell-cycle dependent manner, or activated upon exposure to particular stimuli. a subset of 216 E. coli proteins that are known to be essential for the survival and growth of this bacterium were analyzed. the correlation between protein disorder and expression level became even more evident. essential proteins had on average a much higher fraction of disorder (0.36) and had a higher number of proteins classified as completely disordered. structural vulnerability can be related to protein intrinsic disorder. the inability of a particular protein fold to protect intramolecular hydrogen bonds from water attack may result in local or global unfolding. many of the proteins associated with the conformational disorders are also involved in recognition, regulation, and cell signaling. -synuclein has amazing structural plasticity and adopts a series of different monomeric, oligomeric, and insoluble conformations. polyglutamine diseases are a specific group of hereditary neurodegeneration caused by expansion of CAG triplet repeats in an exon of disease genes. nine neurodegenerative disorders, including Kennedy's, Huntington's, spinocerebellar atrophy-1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 17, and dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy are known to belong to this class of diseases. associated proteins include p53,249 p57kip2,250 Bcl-XL and Bcl-2,251 c-Fos. the best characterized example of the important cancer-related IDP is the tumor suppressor protein p53. p53 regulates expression of genes involved in numerous cellular processes. some of these disease-related IDPs/IDPRs are involved in recognition, regulation, and signaling. the rational design of enzyme inhibitors depends on the classical view where 3D-structure is an obligatory prerequisite for function. the rational design of enzyme inhibitors depends on the classical view where 3D-structure is an obligatory prerequisite for function. the unbound N-terminal region of p53 forms an -helical structure that binds into a deep groove on the surface of Mdm2,267 NMR studies showed that the unbound N-terminal region of p53 lacks fixed structure. the structure of Nutlin-2 was shown to mimic the crucial residues of p53. the p53\u2013Mdm2 complex is not a unique exception and many other disorder-based protein\u2013protein interactions are blocked by a small molecule. the drug molecules mimic a critical region of the disordered partner (which folds upon binding) and compete with this region for its binding site on the structured partner. bind to one of the three discrete sites within the 85-residue bHLHZip domain of c-Myc. binding of inhibitors to c-Myc induces only local conformational changes, preserves the overall disorder of c-Myc, and inhibits interaction with Max. this approach is very different from the discussed above direct targeting of short IDPRs. it is based on a small molecule binding to a highly dynamic surface created via the transient interaction of preformed interaction-prone fragments. if the structure of a member(s) of the functionally misfolded ensemble can be guessed, then this structure can be used to find small molecules that can interact with this structure. intrinsic disorder IDPs/IDPRs are more common in eukaryotes than in less complex organisms. this suggests that disorder, with its ability to be implemented in various signaling, recognition, and regulation pathways, is important for the maintenance of life in eukaryotic and especially muticellular eukaryotic organisms. some amino acids from non-organic compounds were believed to represent the major components of the early Earth's atmosphere. the Miller\u2013Urey experiment yielded only about half of the modern amino acids281,282 suggesting that the first proteins on Earth may have contained only a few amino acids. some additional support of the validity of this hypothesis can be found in the standard genetic code (that consists of 4 4 4 = 64 triplets of nucleotides, codons), which is redundant. in 2000, Eduard N. Trifonov combined 40 different single-factor criteria into a consensus scale and proposed the following temporal order of addition for the amino acids. many of the early amino acids (such as G, D, E, P, and S) are disorder-promoting, as they are very abundant in modern IDPs. however, the major order-promoting residues (C, W, Y, and F) were added to the genetic code late. X-axis represents evolutionary time and Y-axis shows disorder content in proteins at given evolutionary time point. primordial proteins are expected to be mostly disordered (left-hand side of the plot), proteins in LUA likely are mostly structured (center of the plot) it is very unlikely these disordered primordial polypeptides possessed catalytic activity. grafting of enzymatic activity to proteins generated strong evolutionary pressure toward the well-folded structures. intrinsic disorder was reinvented at the subsequent evolutionary steps leading to the development of more complex organisms from the last universal ancestor. many other IDPs/IDPRs were shown to be characterized by high evolutionary rates. a significant higher degree of positive Darwinian selection was observed in IDPRs of proteins compared to regions of -helix, -sheet or tertiary structures. a systematic study of several families of proteins with at least one structurally characterized disordered region revealed that their IDPRs are characterized by highly heterogeneous evolutionary rates. disorder is important for the maintenance of life in eukaryotic and especially muticellular eukaryotic organisms. a linkage between alternative splicing and signaling by IDPRs suggests a plausible mechanism that could underlie and support cell differentiation. the chances that the first polypeptides that appeared in the primordial soup of the primitive Earth possessed well-developed 3D structures are minimal. some additional support of the validity of this hypothesis can be found in the standard genetic code (that consists of 4 4 4 = 64 triplets of nucleotides, codons), which is redundant (64 codons encodes for 20 amino acids), which is redundant (64 codons encodes for 20 amino acids) many of the early amino acids (such as G, D, E, P, and F) are disorder-promoting, as they are very abundant in modern IDPs. on the other hand, the major order-promoting residues (C, W, Y, and F) were added to the genetic code late. this observation is further illustrated by Figure 5(A) which represents modern genetic code. protein in eukaryotes likely to be mostly disordered. many proteins in eukaryotes are either totally disordered or hybrids. catalysis was transferred from RNA first to ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and only then to protein. protein intrinsic disorder was reinvented at the subsequent evolutionary steps leading to the development of more complex organisms from the last universal ancestor. in fact, it looks like everything is possible, and intrinsically disordered sequences may evolve faster, slower or similar to ordered sequences. human -synuclein (a canonical IDP of 140 residues140,303) differs from its mouse counterpart by merely six residues (4%) there are just 21 residue differences (12%), which include residue differences at 18 positions and 3 insertions/deletions) in flagellin, the ordered central region has greater sequence diversity than its disordered termini. this mass of data produced so far is just a small tip of a humongous iceberg. new models explaining various functions of IDPs, their evolution, and involvement in diseases are in great demand."}
