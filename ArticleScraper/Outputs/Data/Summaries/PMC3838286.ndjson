{"summary": "HSV-1 infects humans, causing cold sores, fever blisters, and genital sores. it also establishes a lifelong persistent infection in trigeminal ganglion. infection with HSV-1 triggers the host innate immune response. RIG-I uses its RNA-binding domain to interact with PKR kinase. it also binds with OAS, RIG-I, and MDA5 to impede their function in IFN induction and IFN response. dsRNA-binding and IFN-antagonizing protein interacts with PACT to impede the association with and activation of RIG-I. mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were derived from wild-type C57/B6 and PACT/ mice kindly provided to Kuan-Teh Jeang's laboratory. expression plasmids of domain 1- and domain 2-deleted PACT mutants (PACTD1 and PACTD2) were constructed by overlap extension PCR (29) primers for PACTD2 are 5\u2032-ATCGGGATCCATCATGTCCCAGAGCAGGCACGG-3\u2032 (forward), 5\u2032-ATCGAAGCTTTTTTTTTCTGCTAT-3\u2032 (reverse overlap), and 5\u2032-AGCAAATACTTGCATTGGCTTTTTTTTTTCTCCA cell lysates were clarified and fractionated on a Sephadex 200 column. blotting, coimmunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase assays, and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) were performed as described previously. HEK293 and HEK293T cells were maintained and propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium. human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)-immortalized MEFs were maintained and propagated. Expression vectors for Flag-RIG-I, Flag-PACT, Myc-PACT, Us11, and EGFP-Us11 were described previously (13, 23, 27). truncated Us11 mutants Us11N and Us11C containing N- and C-terminal parts of the protein, respectively, were constructed by overlap extension PCR. small interfering RNAs against PACT, siPACT1 and siPACT2 were described elsewhere. hek293T cells were infected with HSV-1-EGFP-Us11 virus. cells were harvested at 14 h postinfection and lysed in fractionation buffer. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Us11 targeting of PACT. us11 is thought to directly bind RIG-I and MDA5 to inhibit their functions. in HEK293 cells, the level of endogenous PACT is relatively low. Us11 did not suppress RIG-I activity on IFN--Luc or IRF3-Luc. if Us11 targets RIG-I directly, it would probably suppress both IRF3 and NF-B. pIFN--Luc reporter and expression plasmids were performed at 33 h posttransfection. results represent means standard deviation of three independent measurements of firefly luciferase activity normalized to Renilla luciferase activity normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. coimmunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments confirmed RNase A-insensitive association of EGFP-Us11 and Flag-PACT in transfected HEK293T cells. both proteins were found in the precipitate prepared with anti-Flag or anti-GFP. in vitro-transcribed and annealed dsRNA derived from influenza A virus genomic segment 7 (S7 dsRNA) HEK293T cells were infected with HSV-1-pAUs11 or HSV-1-pAUs11. cells were harvested at 14 h postinfection. protein extract was incubated with 25 g/ml RNase A for 15 min. proteins were analyzed at 14 h after infection or transfection. the open reading frame of Us11 is disrupted by the upstream poly(A) signal in the HSV-1-pAUs11 virus. expression of HSV-1 immediate-early protein ICP0 was probed with mouse monoclonal anti-ICP0 (-ICP0) us11 was detected in the precipitate that harbors PACT or RIG-I. however, when all three proteins were overexpressed, RIG-I disappeared from the complex that contains PACT. hek293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing indicated proteins. immunoprecipitation (IP) and Western blotting (WB) were performed at 48 h posttransfection. the same domain was also used in the interaction with RIG-I, MDA5, PKR, and OAS (13\u201315). the mechanism by which Us11 inhibits PACT function remains to be elucidated. comparing binding affinities between purified recombinant Us11 and PACT using affinity binding assays, fluorescence anisotropy measurement, and surface plasmon resonance technology. compared us11-proficient HSV-1-EGFP-Us11 and Us11-deficient HSV-1-pAUs11 viruses in suppression of IFN production induced by SeV. HEK293T cells transfected with siPACT1-EGFP-Us11 and HSV-1-pAUs11 were equally competent in the suppression of IFN- production in a PACT-independent manner. the expression of EGFP-Us11 and ICP0, a marker for HSV-1 infection, in infected cells was verified. HEK293T cells were transfected with siPACT1 or scrambled siRNA. levels of IFN- mRNA were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. differences between lanes 4 and 6 are statistically significant. both HSV-1-EGFP-Us11 and HSV-1-pAUs11 viruses were capable of suppressing SeV-induced IFN production in PACT-compromised cells. this suppression might be mediated through other IFN-antagonizing proteins such as ICP0 and ICP34.5. the latter virus would allow us to analyze the effect of Us11 expression in the immediate-early phase on IFN production. the induction was less pronounced in HSV-1-34.5-(IE)Us11-infected cells. expression of IFN- (B) and IL-6 (C) mRNAs relative to GAPDH transcript was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. differences between lanes 2 and 3 in panel B and between lanes 2 and 3 in panel C are statistically insignificant. neither HSV-1-34.5 nor HSV-1-34.5-(IE)Us11 virus induced IFN- in PACT/ MEFs suggested the requirement of PACT for the sensing of HSV-1. it remains to be elucidated as to whether and how PACT cooperate with RIG-I or other sensors to mediate the activation of IFN production by HSV-1. PACT is known to affect NF-B activation through PKR (37). the activation of NF-B in PACT/ MEFs might be independent of RIG-I. us11-mediated enhancement of RIG-I activation was largely ablated by Us11. we analyzed the inhibitory activity of Us11 in the presence of RIG-I and PACT. if Us11 targets RIG-I directly, it would probably suppress both IRF3 and NF-B. if Us11 counteracts PACT, it should not affect NF-B. HEK293 cells were transfected with pIFN--Luc reporter and expression plasmids for Flag-PACT, Flag-RIG-I, and Us11. us11 associates with PACT to impede its interaction with RIG-I. the expression level of endogenous PACT in HEK293T cells is relatively higher than in HEK293 cells. biochemical fractionation in the presence of RNase A indicated the presence of PACT and EGFP-Us11 in the same fractions of the protein extract of infected cells. both proteins were found in the precipitate prepared with anti-Flag or anti-GFP. endogenous PACT protein was found in EGFP-Us11-containing immune complex. hek293T cells were infected with HSV-1-EGFP-Us11 (multiplicity of infection of 1). cells were harvested at 14 h postinfection. RNA was then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. hek293T cells were infected with HSV-1-EGFP-Us11 or HSV-1-pAUs11. hek293T cells were transfected with EGFP-Us11 expression plasmid. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the indicated proteins. Us11 interacts directly with PACT to prevent it from interacting with RIG-I. hek293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the indicated proteins. we demonstrated the importance of the C-terminal dsRNA-binding domain of Us11 in its interaction with PACT. we argued that Us11 suppresses RIG-I function through direct interaction with and inhibition of PACT. we did not exclude the possibility that Us11 might still interact with and inhibit RIG-I and MDA5. HEK293T cells stably expressing EGFP or EGFP-Us11 were infected with SeV. infection with HSV-1-EGFP-Us11 dampened IFN- induction by SeV. this effect was less pronounced when cells were infected with HSV-1-pAUs11. in this setting, both viruses circumvented IFN- production in a PACT-independent manner. HEK293T cells were transfected with siPACT1 or scrambled siRNA. proteins were analyzed at 72 h posttransfection. the induction of IFNs by either Us11-proficient or Us11-deficient HSV-1 would be efficiently suppressed by virus-encoded IFN-antagonizing proteins such as ICP0 and ICP34.5 (3, 4). both HSV-1-EGFP-Us11 and HSV-1-pAUs11 viruses were capable of suppressing SeV-induced IFN production in PACT-compromised cells. us11 was not expressed in the early phase of infection when cells were collected for analysis. another virus, HSV-1-34.5-(IE)Us11, from which Us11 is expressed in the immediate-early phase of infection was also included in our analysis. a spontaneous deletion results in the expression of Us11 from the IE promoter of Us12. wild-type (WT) and PACT/ MEFs were infected with HSV-1-34.5 or HSV-1-34.5-(IE)Us11. the difference between lanes 2 and 3 in panel B is statistically significant. we obtained two lines of evidence concerning the influence of Us11 on NF-B activation. us11 did not induce more IL-6 than HSV-1-34.5-(IE)Us11. us11 was previously found to inhibit NF-B activation induced by SeV (15) more experiments are needed to clarify whether this might be mediated through an RIG-I-independent mechanism. the activation of NF-B in PACT/ MEFs might be independent of RIG-I. between VP35 and PACT lent further support to this emerging new concept (42). it remains to be seen whether NS1 and PACT might also antagonize each other."}
