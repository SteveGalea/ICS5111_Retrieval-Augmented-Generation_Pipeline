{"summary": "cells are grown in complete RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), Penicillin/Streptomycin at 100U/ml and 100 g/ml, respectively, and Amphotericin B at 0.5 g/ml at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2. to induce virus production, stimulate cells with 20ng/ml tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) for 1 diluted blood with 15 ml Ficoll Hypaque lymphocyte separation medium. centrifuge at 225 x g without brake at room temperature for 30 minutes. single-stained with PE conjugated anti-CD23 antibody (1/50 dilution) single-stained with FITC conjugated anti-CD58 antibody (1/50 dilution) single-stained with PE-Cy5 conjugated anti-CD19 antibody (1/50 dilution each) single-stained with PE-Cy5 conjugated anti-CD19 antibody (1/50 dilution each) centrifuge cells at 3000 rpm for 3 minutes, remove supernatant, and add 200 L of FACS buffer. Resuspend cells in 200 L FACS buffer and acquire data. larger clusters of cells in established LCL by light microscopy. double the volume of culture medium in the culture flask on day 12. un-infected PBMC (A) or PBMC exposed to EBV were harvested on day 3. un-infected (A) and EBV-exposed (B) cells were examined for expression of CD19 and CD58. cells are grown in complete RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), Penicillin/Streptomycin at 100U/ml and 100 g/ml, respectively, and Amphotericin B at 0.5 g/ml at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2. to induce virus production, stimulate cells with 20ng/ml tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) for remove buffy coat and transfer into a new 50 ml conical tube. wash cells by resuspending pellet in 50 ml PBS and spinning at 600 x g at room temperature for 10 minutes. Pour off supernatant. single-stained with PE conjugated anti-CD23 antibody (1/50 dilution) single-stained with FITC conjugated isotype control antibody matched to CD23-PE (at the same concentration as anti-CD23 antibody) single-stained with PE-Cy5 conjugated isotype control antibody matched to CD23-PE (at the same concentration as anti-CD23 antibody) single-stained with PE-Cy5 conjugated isotype control antibody matched to CD23 cells at 3000 rpm for 3 minutes, remove supernatant, and add 200 L of FACS buffer. Resuspend cells in 200 L FACS buffer and acquire data using a flow cytometer, acquiring 20,000 events/tube. double the volume of culture medium in the culture flask on day 12. if the culture medium turns yellow, it is generally time to replace the media as above. expand culture to 75-100 ml over the next few weeks. un-infected PBMC (A) or PBMC exposed to EBV were harvested on day 3. un-infected (A) and EBV-exposed (B) cells were examined for expression of CD19 and CD58. growth transformation has been monitored by visualization of clusters of cells by light microscopy about a week after exposure to EBV6. however, clustering of cells is not a specific indicator of EBV-mediated growth transformation."}
