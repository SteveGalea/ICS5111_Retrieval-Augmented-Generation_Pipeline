{"summary": "porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA coronavirus. it mainly gives rise to encephalomyelitis or vomiting and wasting disease in piglets. as a neurotropic virus, it spreads via the peripheral to the central nervous system. emer et al., 2010; emer et al., 2010; emer et al., 2010; emer et al., 2011; emer et al., 2011; emer et al., 2011; emer et al., 2011; emer et al., 2011; emer et al., 2011; emer et al., 2011; emer atypical autophagy leads to the accumulation of autophagosomes while blocking their fusion with lysosomes. cells were infected with PHEV (105.43TCID50/mL) in cell cultures with 2% FBS for 1 h. neuro-2a cells were treated with 100 nM rapamycin in complete medium for 3 h as a positive control. the infected cells were incubated with PHEV (105.43TCID50/mL) for 24 h. the cells were infected with PHEV and harvested at 6\u201348 h post-infection. the cells were then incubated with complete medium with 10% FBS. they were then mock-infected, and those infected with PHEV were treated as required. neuro-2a cells were transfected with ptfLC3 and infected with PHEV at 12, 24 and 48 h. the cells were incubated and examined with rabbit antibody against LAMP1. quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to analyse virus copies of PHEV. the cells were given the appropriate treatment or infection. RNA was extracted following lysis in tripure isolation reagent (Roche, Switzerland) cells were infected with PHEV (105.43TCID50/mL) in cell cultures with 2% FBS for 1 h. infected cells were incubated in the complete DMEM at 37\u00b0C for the relevant times in the conformity with experimental requirements. in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C and then postfixed in 1% OsO4 for 2 h. ultrathin sections were prepared and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. at last, autophagosome-like vesicles were examined under a transmission electron microscopy. autophagic flux measurements p62, also called SQSTM1, undergoes degradation in the course of autophagy. a tandem reporter construct, mRFP-GFP-LC3 (ptfLC3), was used as additional plasmid to monitor the autophagic flux. at 12, 24 and 48 hpi, the cells were fixed and visualized. cells were transfected on cell slips with GFP-LC3 and infected with PHEV at 12, 24, and 48 h. cells were incubated and examined under a confocal fluorescence microscope. to mark the acidic late endosomal and lysosomal structures, LysoTracker Red (50 nM) was added to the treated cells. double membrane vacuoles containing organelle and cytosolic components were visible in the PHEV-infected cells compared with the mock cells. PHEV infection leads to the accumulation of autophagosomes in cells, as observed by GFP-LC3 punctate redistribution. the localization of GFP-LC3 positive autophagosome accumulation (green) was visualized using a confocal microscope. the average number of puncta in each cell was taken from at least 80 cells in each treatment. a time course of PHEV infection showed that autophagy by PHEV-induced is time-dependent. immunofluorescence microscopy was used to detect the GFP-LC3-autophagosomes in PHEV infected cells at different post-infection time points. cells were fixed at 0, 24, and 36 h post-infection, respectively. at 0, 12, 24, and 36 h post-infection, the cells were then lysed for western blotting analysis. PHEV-infected Neuro2a cells were stained with LC3 (green) and PHEV (red) antibodies. the color-merged images are shown in the third panel. the colocalization between PHEV and LC3 and LAMP1 was magnified. cells infected with PHEV suppress autophagic flux, leading to no decrease of p62 but an accumulation when treated with CQ before PHEV infection. results suggest that cells infected with PHEV suppress autophagic flux, leading to no decrease of p62 but an accumulation when treated with CQ. ptfLC3-transfected cells experienced complete autophagic flux. neuro-2a cells were transfected with mRFP-GFP-LC3. at 0, 12, and 24 h post-transfection, the cells were fixed and assessed. in mock-infected cells, a certain number of GFP-LC3 vacuoles merged with LysoTracker staining. it indicated that a portion of autophagosomes had fused with lysosomes and became acidified. however, after PHEV infection, the autophagosomes do not fuse with acidic compartments. neuro-2a cells were infected with PHEV in the presence or absence of rapamycin (100 nM) or 3-MA (2 mM) at 24 h and 48 hpi, the cells were harvested and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-LC3, anti-PHEV and anti-actin antibodies. the pharmacological alteration of autophagy does not affect cell viability. neuro-2a cells were determined by rapamycin, 3-MA, or chloroquine. data on the percentage of cell viability are shown as the mean SD. autophagosomes accumulate in PHEV-infected Neuro-2a cells. a time course of PHEV infection showed autophagy by PHEV-induced is time-dependent. autophagy by PHEV-induced is time-dependent. immunofluorescence microscopy was used to detect the GFP-LC3 puncta. in line with these data, increased LC3-II accumulation was also examined in PHEV-infected cells with the increasing time by infection. PHEV-induced autophagy was time-dependent. PHEV-infected neuro2a cells were stained with LC3 (green) and PHEV (red) antibodies. the colocalization between PHEV and LC3 and LAMP1 was magnified in the merged images. PHEV infection induces an autophagic response, but efficient autophagic protein degradation remains unobserved. the results suggest that cells infected with PHEV suppress autophagic flux, leading to no decrease of p62. the red fluorescence signal produced by ptfLC3 is not sensitive to acidic conditions. ptfLC3-transfected cells experienced complete autophagic flux. PHEV activates autophagosome formation but prevents its fusion with lysosomes. in mock-infected cells, a certain number of GFP-LC3 vacuoles merged with LysoTracker red. it indicated that a portion of autophagosomes had fused with lysosomes and became acidified. however, after PHEV infection, the autophagosomes do not fuse with acidic compartments. autophagy can stimulate complete autophagy, targeting mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways. induction of autophagy with rapamycin (200 M) for 2 h effectively upregulated the alteration of LC3-I to LC3-II but significantly inhibited PHEV replication at 24 and 48 hpi. regulation of autophagy does not affect cell viability. the pharmacological alteration of autophagy does not affect cell viability. neuro-2a cells were determined by WST-8 cell proliferation assay. PHEV infection induces atypical autophagy which is involved in viral replication. LC3 could be recruited to form double-membrane vesicles from the ER. these viral factories provide a suitable platform for the replication and encourage autophagy. coronavirus membrane-associated papain-like protease PLP2 (PLP2-TM) could promote autophagy. PHEV could activate the appearance of autophagosome but influence its fusion with lysosomes. LC3-II turnover, and GFP-LC3 lysosomal delivery and proteolysis remained unchanged upon PHEV infection. the effect of CQ treatment may be related to its inhibition of autophagic proteolysis by suppressing acidification of lysosomes and endosomes. y-associated membrane proteins are related to the PHEV replication. neuro-2a cells were treated with the experimental requirements in pharmacological alterations. the early autophagy inhibitor 3-MA treatment could significantly promote the replication of PHEV, further implied that the formation of early autophagosome contributes to PHEV replication. of interest statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
