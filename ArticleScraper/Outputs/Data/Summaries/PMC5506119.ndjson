{"summary": "CAP should be diagnosed in patients in primary care who present with a combination of well-established clinical features of CAP, including vital sign and examination abnormalities (A II) CAP is excluded if a repeat CXR at 24\u201348 hours is negative (A III) disease severity score should always be interpreted in conjunction with a thorough clinical assessment of the patient (A II). decisions should be based on the clinical condition of the patients, on the disease severity scoring, on the social circumstances of the patients and on available resources. patients with a CRB-65 score of 0 or a CURB-65 score of 0 or 1 are at low risk of death. BCs should be considered in patients with lower CURB-65 scores. BCs should not be performed on patients with CAP who are being treated as outpatients. sputum samples should be submitted for Gram stain and culture. HIV-infected, diabetics, admission to ICU, subacute illness or those not responding to empiric antimicrobial therapy (A II) TB culture should be performed in the following patients with a negative Gene Xpert MTB/RIF: non-resolving pneumonia or an ongoing suspicion of TB. there is limited evidence to support for the use of beta-glucan to diagnose PCP in a south africa setting. initial empiric therapy should be guided by the setting in which the patient is being treated, their age, use of antibiotics within the previous 90 days, the presence of comorbidities and drug intolerance. Empiric therapy for PCP and influenza may be necessary when clinical and epidemiological criteria are met. patients with severe pneumonia should receive amoxicillin-clavulanate or cefuroxime or a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) plus a macrolide antibiotic (A II). antibiotics should be administered early, preferably within the emergency unit, to patients with confirmed CAP (A II). empiric therapy for TB prior to initial testing is rarely required unless there is a miliary pattern on CXR or the patient is severely ill and TB is suspected (A III). oseltamivir should be provided for any patient with severe pneumonia and can be stopped if PCR testing of nasopharyngeal aspirate is negative (B II) there is not enough evidence to recommend the routine use of statins for either prevention or treatment of CAP (A patients can switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics when they are haemodynamically stable, have a respiratory rate 25/min, temperature 37.8 \u00b0C and are able to take oral medication. treatment duration may be extended beyond 14 days for specific clinical scenarios such as Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (A II) aspiration pneumonia The term \u2018aspiration\u2019 refers to the abnormal entry of a large inoculum of exogenous substances or endogenous secretions into the lower airways. this can cause pneumonitis or pneumonia, which has important clinical and microbiological differences from CAP. all adults 65 years who have received PPV23 should receive a single dose of PCV13 at least one year later (A II) younger adults (18 years) who are vaccine nave with severe underlying comorbid or immunocompromising conditions including HIV infection should receive a single dose of PCV13. all patients presenting to hospital with suspected CAP require a CXR to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other potential causes for their illness. otherwise the principles of CAP diagnosis are the same as in primary care. CAP is excluded if a repeat CXR at 24\u201348 hours is negative (A III) the CURB-65 score (CRB-65 for outpatients) is the recommended disease severity score for patients with CAP (A II) severity scoring systems should not be the sole basis for making decisions regarding site of care. decisions should be based on the clinical condition of the patients, on the disease severity scoring, on the social circumstances of the patients and on available resources. microbiological tests Blood cultures should be taken prior to antibiotic therapy in all patients with CAP with a CURB-65 score of 2 (A II) BCs should be considered in patients with lower CURB-65 scores, but who require hospitalisation for other reasons (B II). a sputum sample or tracheal aspirate should be submitted for Gram stain and culture. measure of CRP or PCT in emergency departments may be considered in patients with acute respiratory illness when the diagnosis of CAP is in doubt (B II) microbiological tests Blood cultures should be taken prior to antibiotic therapy in all patients with CAP with a CURB-65 score of 2 (A II) BCs should not be performed on patients with CAP who are being treated as outpatients (A II) TB culture should be performed in the following patients with a negative Gene Xpert MTB/RIF. TB culture should be performed in the following patients with a negative Gene Xpert MTB/RIF. TB culture should be performed in the following patients with a negative Gene Xpert MTB/RIF. the preferred specimen for diagnostic tests for PCP is bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) there is limited evidence to support for the use of beta-glucan to diagnose PCP in a south africa setting. initial empiric therapy should be guided by the setting in which the patient is being treated, their age, use of antibiotics within the previous 90 days, the presence of comorbidities and drug intolerance. patients with severe pneumonia should receive amoxicillin-clavulanate or cefuroxime or a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) (A II) antibiotics should be administered early, preferably within the emergency unit, to patients with confirmed CAP (A II). Ceftaroline is recommended as directed therapy based on the results of microbiological testing in cases of resistant Enterobacteriaceae such as ESBL-producing pathogens (A I). when to add therapy for PCP and TB Empiric therapy for PCP should be added when patients fulfill the WHO case definition and it should not be withheld based on negative immunohistochemical staining on sputum specimens. patients treated at home who are 65 years old should receive oral amoxicillin-clavulanate or an oral second generation cephalosporin (A II) patients requiring admission to hospital who are 65 years old, without antibiotic exposure in the past 90 days, or comorbidities, should receive intravenous ampicillin or penicillin (if IVI ampicillin not available) definitive therapy When microbiological testing detects a causative organism, it may be possible to change from empiric to definitive therapy based on the drug susceptibility testing. ceftaroline is recommended as directed therapy based on the results of microbiological testing in cases of resistant Enterobacteriaceae such as ESBL-producing pathogens (A I). use of systemic corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisone 0.5 mg/kg/12 h or equivalent) should be considered in patients with severe CAP requiring ICU admission unless influenza or tuberculosis is likely. intravenous to oral switching (IVPOS) is a cornerstone of antibiotic stewardship. fluid drainage by means of an intercostal drain is necessary in all cases of complicated para-pneumonic effusion or empyema (A II) patients with CAP with well-recognised risk factors for a cardiovascular event should be investigated for the possibility of a cardiovascular event (A III). aspiration pneumonia The term \u2018aspiration\u2019 refers to the abnormal entry of a large inoculum of exogenous substances or endogenous secretions into the lower airways. this can cause pneumonitis or pneumonia, which has important clinical and microbiological differences from CAP. all adults 65 years who have received PPV23 should receive a single dose of PCV13 at least one year later (A II) younger adults (18 years) who have previously received PPV23 should receive a single dose of PCV13 followed at least 2 months later (A II) guideline is an update of the SATS CAP Guideline published in 2007 (7). it seeks to provide practical advice on the approach to all adult patients with CAP. guidelines do not apply to the much larger group of adults with non-pneumonic lower respiratory tract infections. the committee recognises that most patients with CAP are cared for by primary care, internal medicine, and emergency medicine physicians. this guideline is aimed at both public and private sectors and therefore differs in some respects. underlying HIV infection is the most important risk condition for LRTI hospitalisation in south africa. HIV-infected individuals have substantially greater risk of being hospitalised with LRTI than HIV-uninfected individuals. other important risk factors for hospitalised LRTI in adults include increasing age and underlying lung disease. in 2014, pertussis was identified in 5% of all patients with LRTI. rates of pertussis in all ages may be expected to increase following the change from whole-cell to acellular pertussis vaccine. influenza is the most common viral cause of CAP in adults, identified in 9% of patients. the risk of CAP in HIV-infected individuals increases with decreasing CD4+T cell count. clusters of two or more individuals hospitalised with severe respiratory illness or respiratory deaths with no identified aetiology should be investigated. this guideline seeks practical advice on the approach to all adult patients with acute community-acquired infection of the lung parenchyma. the committee agreed to the final draft of the guideline. it recognises that most patients with CAP are cared for by primary care, internal medicine, and emergency medicine physicians. this guideline is therefore directed primarily at them. the incidence of LRTI amongst individuals aged 15 years in south africa is approximately 400 per 100,000 populations with the peak incidence in individuals aged 25\u201364 years. underlying HIV infection is the most important risk condition for LRTI hospitalisation in South Africa. atypical bacterial causes of pneumonia are uncommon in south africa (2% of all adult CAP) but they have cyclical circulation with periodic increases in incidence. Bordetella pertussis may present as CAP more atypically in older children and adults. influenza is the most common viral cause of CAP in adults. infected adults admitted with CAP in sub-saharan africa (17,18) risk of CAP increases with decreasing CD4+T cell count. clusters of two or more individuals hospitalised with severe respiratory illness or respiratory deaths with no identified aetiology should be investigated.'suspected CAP' will be defined as having supportive clinical features without CXR confirmation. a suggested way of diagnosing CAP in primary care when CXR is unavailable using clinical features and CRP has recently been presented. a systematic review has shown that even combinations of symptoms and signs rarely increase the probability of the diagnosis by more than 50%. a study found that patients presenting with LRTI and normal vital signs and clinical examination have a low risk of pneumonia. CAP is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly (39-41) atypical presentations are more common (43), leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment (44). CAP may manifest as new or worsening confusion, deterioration in functional status or decompensation of an underlying illness (44-47) a repeat CXR at 24\u201348 hours remains clear of new infiltrates. 7% of patients admitted with suspected CAP developed changes consistent with CAP on a repeat CXR (48) a normal CXR should be performed in all patients presenting to hospital with suspected CAP (A II) similar findings have been observed in other clinical trials (29-31) the need to correctly identify those with CAP to limit overuse of antibiotics and to appropriately treat and refer those with more serious infections. a suggested way of diagnosing CAP in primary care when CXR is unavailable using clinical features and CRP has recently been presented. pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. atypical presentations are more common (43), leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment. CAP may manifest as new or worsening confusion, deterioration in functional status or decompensation of an underlying illness (44-47) empiric antibiotic therapy (48) may be stopped if appropriate cultures are negative and a repeat CXR at 24\u201348 hours remains clear of new infiltrates. in most circumstances, however, the administration of antibiotics for suspected CAP without CXR confirmation has been associated with inaccurate diagnosis (49) and overuse of antibiotics (50). the CURB-65 score was derived from the BTS rules. the original international derivation and validation study of the CURB-65 was published in 2003. it has not been formally validated in the south africa setting. CURB-65 score (CRB-65 for outpatients) is recommended disease severity score for patients with CAP (A II) disease severity score should always be interpreted in conjunction with a thorough clinical assessment of the patient (A II) patients with scores of 3 or more are thought to be severely ill. patients with a CRB-65 score of 0 or a CURB-65 score of 0 or 1 are at high risk of death. patients with a CRB-65 score of 0 or 2 or a CURB-65 score of 2 are at increased risk of death. CAP is a sensitive marker of response to therapy with a failure to fall by 50% at day 3 or 4 being associated with increased 30-day mortality. clinical evaluation, including serial measurement of temperature, is likely to be sufficient to identify patients requiring further investigation and/or a change in antibiotic therapy. microbiological investigations are performed in order to identify the aetiological agent, and are not intended to confirm the diagnosis of CAP. the common microbiological investigations that would be performed in the setting of CAP are BC, sputum culture, and detection of Legionella and pneumococcal antigens in urine. different studies have identified different parameters associated with bacteraemia. these include neutrophilia (62), low WCC, raised creatinine, hypoglycaemia, temperature >38 \u00b0C (63), elevated PSI score (64), tachycardia, tachypnoea and hypotension (65), and low oxygen saturation (66). the use of sputum to identify aetiological agents is bedevilled by the need for an adequate sputum sample the two commercially available urine antigen tests are for Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 and Streptococcus pneumoniae. the pneumococcal antigen test has a high specificity (99%), but sensitivity is not well defined. the major issue with both of these tests is whether positive results will significantly alter therapy. the diagnostic armamentarium has significantly increased the proportion of patients in whom an aetiological agent can be found. the majority of these additional agents have been viral, although molecular tests do offer the ability to detect some of the so-called \u2018atypical\u2019 pathogens. the challenge remains in determining whether the presence of a positive molecular result proves causality. the use of the pneumococcal UAT is not routinely recommended for patients with severe CAP (B III) nasopharyngeal samples may be considered for detection of influenza (B II) blood markers CRP can be useful when the diagnosis of CAP is in doubt. onin to guide initiation and discontinuation of antibiotics in patients with a range of respiratory tract infections has shown a significant reduction in the use of antibiotics. but sub-group analysis of patients with CAP shows little difference in the proportion of patients initially prescribed antibiotics. it is therefore not recommended that procalcitonin be measured when the diagnosis of CAP is confirmed. microbiological investigations are performed in order to identify the aetiological agent, and are not intended to confirm the diagnosis of CAP. the common microbiological investigations that would be performed in the setting of CAP are BC, sputum culture, and detection of Legionella and pneumococcal antigens in urine. different studies have identified different parameters associated with bacteraemia. these include neutrophilia (62), low WCC, raised creatinine, hypoglycaemia, temperature >38 \u00b0C (63), elevated PSI score (64), tachycardia, tachypnoea and hypotension (65), and low oxygen saturation (66). the use of sputum to identify aetiological agents is bedevilled by the need for an adequate sputum sample the pneumococcal antigen test has a high specificity (99%), but sensitivity is not well defined. the major issue with both of these tests is whether positive results will significantly alter therapy. the major issue with both of these tests is whether positive results will significantly alter therapy. the majority of these additional agents have been viral. molecular tests do offer the ability to detect some of the so-called \u2018atypical\u2019 pathogens. the challenge remains in determining whether the presence of a positive molecular result proves causality. the use of the pneumococcal UAT is not routinely recommended for patients with severe CAP (B III) the Legionella UAT should be considered, where available, for patients with severe CAP (B III) the use of rapid antigen tests for influenza is not recommended (B II). nasopharyngeal samples may be considered for detection of influenza (B II) serology for \u2018atypical\u2019 pathogens should not be routinely performed (A II). TB is a cause of CAP and the clinical features are not reliable in distinguishing TB from other aetiologies. sputum induction provides an adequate sample and a bacteriological diagnosis more frequently than instruction by a health-care worker. a major advantage of the test is that it is able to rapidly detect patients with rifampicin resistance as well as susceptibility to second line TB drugs. specimen is preferred first line diagnostic test for pulmonary TB. rapid molecular tests, such as line probe assays, are recommended. TB culture should be performed in the following patients with a negative GeneXpert MTB/RIF: non-resolving pneumonia or an ongoing suspicion of TB (A III). the gold standard diagnostic test for PCP is immunofluorescent staining (IFA) of P. jirovecii organisms on bronchoalveolar lavage samples. the sensitivity of these tests is poor (60%) and are inadequate to rule out the diagnosis of PCP.

of tests. preferred specimen for diagnostic tests for PCP is BAL although induced or expectorated sputum may be used when bronchoscopy is unavailable (B II). there is limited evidence to support for the use of beta-glucan to diagnose PCP in a south African setting. comorbid pulmonary disease, hepatic and nervous system illnesses were associated with distinct patterns of aetiology for each of those conditions. comorbidities were defined as treatment for asthma or COPD or presence of interstitial lung disorders, hepatic comorbidities were defined as pre-existing viral or toxic hepatopathy. multiple medical comorbidities have been documented to be a risk factor for penicillin-resistant and other drug-resistant pneumococcal infections. patients treated at home who are 65 years old, without antibiotic exposure in the past 90 days or comorbidities should receive oral amoxicillin-clavulanate or an oral second generation cephalosporin. studies of survival among intubated patients with CAP (114) and among CAP patients with severe sepsis. a combination of amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime or a third generation (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) cephalosporin and a macrolide/azalide antibiotic was also supported. macrolide/azalide/tetracycline may be used alone or in combination with another agent in cases suspected or known to be infected with so-called \u2018atypical\u2019 pathogens. patients treated at home who are 65 years old, without antibiotic exposure in the past 90 days, or comorbidities, could receive an oral macrolide/azalide in the presence of severe beta-lactam allergy (A II) patients with severe pneumonia should receive amoxicillin-clavulanate or cefuroxime or a third generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) plus a macrolide antibiotic (A II) Respiratory fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin) are an alternative therapy. trial versus ceftriaxone showed clinical cure rates for the ceftaroline group that were numerically higher than those for the ceftriaxone group. ertapenem should be reserved for use in patients with microbiologically-confirmed CAP due to resistant Enterobacteriaceae. ceftaroline is recommended as directed therapy based on the results of microbiological testing in cases of resistant Enterobacteriaceae such as ESBL-producing pathogens (A I). patients with HIV infection who fulfill these criteria or with a positive specific test for PCP should be initiated on therapy with co-trimoxazole (20 mg/kg TMP and 100 mg/kg SMX/day in divided doses) patients should be initiated on oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily) and a nasopharyngeal aspirate tested for influenza by polymerase chain reaction. specific risk factors for severe influenza are pregnancy, immune compromise (including diabetes mellitus and HIV infection), obesity and chronic lung, cardiac, neurological disease and age >65 years (122,123). comorbid pulmonary disease, hepatic and nervous system illnesses and current smoking and alcohol abuse were associated with distinct patterns of aetiology for each of those conditions. comorbidities were defined as treatment for asthma or COPD, or presence of interstitial lung disorders, hepatic comorbidities were defined as pre-existing viral or toxic hepatopathy and nervous system illnesses were defined as pre-existing. multiple medical comorbidities have been documented to be a risk factor for penicillin-resistant and other drug-resistant pneumococcal infections. patients treated at home who are 65 years old, without antibiotic exposure in the past 90 days or comorbidities should receive oral amoxicillin-clavulanate or oral second generation cephalosporin. patients with severe CAP should be treated with a combination of amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime or a third generation (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) cephalosporin. alternative regimen for severe CAP is a respiratory fluoroquinolone, which should be combined with another agent, most commonly a beta-lactam. macrolide/azalide/tetracycline may also be used alone or in combination with another agent in cases suspected or known to be infected with so-called \u2018atypical\u2019 pathogens. patients treated at home who are 65 years old, without antibiotic exposure in the past 90 days, or comorbidities, could receive an oral macrolide/azalide in the presence of severe beta-lactam allergy (A II) a third generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) plus a macrolide antibiotic (A II) may be used in patients with severe beta-lactam allergy or as an alternative to beta-lactam/macrolide therapy. antibiotics should be administered early, preferably within the emergency unit, to patients with confirmed CAP (A II) patients with severe pneumonia should receive amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime or a third generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) plus a macrolide antibiotic (A II) clinical cure rates for ceftaroline group were numerically higher than those for ceftriaxone. ertapenem should be reserved for use in patients with microbiologically-confirmed CAP due to penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (penicillin MIC 8 mg/L) or MRSA. Ceftaroline is recommended as directed therapy based on the results of microbiological testing in cases of resistant Enterobacteriaceae. patients with HIV infection who fulfill these criteria or with a positive specific test for PCP should be initiated on therapy with co-trimoxazole (20 mg/kg TMP and 100 mg/kg SMX/day in divided doses) empiric therapy for TB prior to initial testing is rarely required unless there is a miliary pattern on CXR or the patient is severely ill and TB is suspected (A III). oseltamivir should be provided for any patient with severe pneumonia. oseltamivir should be provided for any patient with severe pneumonia. can be stopped if PCR testing of nasopharyngeal aspirate is negative (A II) corticosteroid use was associated with a lower mortality (significant only in the severe CAP group), reduction in need for mechanical ventilation, occurrence of ARDS, time to clinical stability and length of hospital stay. there are still unanswered questions regarding corticosteroid use, including which patients with CAP are most likely to benefit. methylprednisone 0.5mg/kg/12 h or equivalent should be considered in patients with severe CAP requiring ICU admission unless influenza or tuberculosis is likely. there is not enough evidence from randomised controlled trials to recommend their routine use to either prevent CAP or improve its mortality. the recommended regimen is methylprednisone 0.5 mg/kg/12 h or equivalent for 5 days (135) the recommended regimen is methylprednisone 0.5 mg/kg/12 h or equivalent for 5 days (135) there is limited data in patients with HIV infection. severe CAP Mortality is in the region of 12% for hospitalised CAP but >30% among those admitted to the ICU (142) influenza pneumonia is itself a form of primary ARDS. spreading infiltrates may represent secondary ARDS due to capillary leak. biomarkers may also help to identify antibiotic failure. treatment duration may be extended beyond 5\u20137 days for specific clinical scenarios such as Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (A II). patients with confirmed Legionella pneumonia should be treated with azithromycin for 7 days (A II). para-pneumonic effusion and empyema occur in at least 40% of bacterial CAP. most effusions resolve with treatment of pneumonia. if bacteria invade the pleural space, a complicated para-pneumonic effusion or empyema results. pleural fluid cholesterol greater than 55 mg/dL and pleural LDH greater than 200 U/L each had better positive and negative likelihood ratios for distinguishing exudates from transudates than did Light\u2019s criteria. a low pleural fluid pH level is more predictive of complicated effusions (that require drainage) than is a low pleural fluid glucose level. a lung abscess is typically diagnosed when a chest radiograph reveals a pulmonary infiltrate with a cavity; an air-fluid level is frequently present. risk factors include immunosuppression, inappropriate antibiotic selection, and infection with S. aureus and K. pneumoniae. patients diagnosed with lung abscess as a complication of CAP should receive prolonged course of antibiotics, usually 4\u20136 weeks, along with physiotherapy to effect postural drainage (B II). cardiovascular events There is an emerging awareness of the possible occurrence of cardiovascular events in patients with CAP, with one of the earliest studies of cardiac changes in CAP having been undertaken in south Africa (157). patients with CAP with well-recognised risk factors for a cardiovascular event should be investigated for the possibility of a cardiovascular event (A III) long-term sequelae of lung damage CAP occasionally leads to bronchiectasis, particularly if recurrent or associated with anatomic or immune defect. pleural fluid acidosis increases the LDH concentration in the pleural fluid to values often more than 1,000 IU/L. a positive culture is not required for diagnosis, since there are several reasons why bacteria may not be cultured from an empyema. the characteristic putrid odour of the pleural fluid is classically considered diagnostic of anaerobic infection. fluid drainage by means of an intercostal drain is necessary in all cases of complicated para-pneumonic effusion or empyema. current international guidelines strongly recommend the routine use of ultrasonography for all pleural fluid drainage procedures. infection with anaerobic bacteria, S. aureus, gram-negative enteric bacilli or S. anginosus group should be considered. a lung abscess is typically diagnosed when a chest radiograph reveals a pulmonary infiltrate with a cavity; an air-fluid level is frequently present. patients diagnosed with lung abscess as a complication of CAP should receive a prolonged course of antibiotics, usually 4\u20136 weeks, along with physiotherapy to effect postural drainage (B II). cardiovascular events There is an emerging awareness of the possible occurrence of cardiovascular events in patients with CAP. such events, when they occur in patients with CAP, are associated with a poorer prognosis acutely. such events are associated with a poorer prognosis acutely, as well as a poorer prognosis and associated increased risk of cardiovascular events on long-term follow-up. major syndromes related to aspiration include (173) airway obstruction from inhalation of particulate matter (174), aspiration pneumonitis, a chemical injury caused by aspiration of sterile liquid gastric contents (or other noxious fluids) and (175) aspiration pneumonia, an infectious process caused by the inhalation of oropharyngeal secretions colonised by microorganisms (173-176) patients who aspirate have a 7-fold higher risk of developing pneumonia (187), which complicates 10% of acute strokes. patients with CAAP are more likely to be admitted to intensive care units (189,190) and require mechanical ventilation than those with non-aspiration CAP. primary predisposing mechanisms include dysphagia and altered mental status (192), resulting in compromised glottic closure and cough reflexes (175,176) the relevance of these early studies assessing the bacteriology of aspiration pneumonia has been questioned. concerns about the sterility of sampling techniques employed (201) and the inclusion of patients with established complications such as lung abscess and empyema (173) there are no clinical or biochemical findings that reliably distinguish anaerobic pneumonia from CAP (176,205), but the following may suggest an anaerobic cause of pneumonia. the production of foul-smelling sputum suggests infection with anaerobic organisms. hypoxia is a prominent feature, and patients may progress to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome. erobic pneumonia showed much better cure rates with the use of clindamycin (208,209) antimicrobials should be considered for patients with aspiration pneumonitis and persistent or progressive signs and symptoms 48 hours after aspirating (B III) patients with defective lower airway clearance mechanisms aspirate large inoculum of normally nonvirulent pathogens. 'bland' aspiration may lead to CXR infiltrates but does not result in an inflammatory response in the lung. there is often a failure by clinicians to distinguish aspiration pneumonitis or bland aspiration from aspiration pneumonia. alcohol abuse and seizures are strongly associated with anaerobic aspiration pneumonia because of reduced levels of consciousness, poor oral hygiene, immune dysfunction and delayed presentations. conditions such as dental caries, periodontal disease and gingivitis increase the risk of colonisation with pathogenic organisms and a higher overall bacterial load. the elderly therefore represent a higher risk group (186) because of the more frequent neglect of oral hygiene (196) and higher rates of neurological disease (173) gram-negative enteric bacilli were the predominant organisms isolated (49%), followed by anaerobic bacteria (16%), and S. aureus (12%). this shift in microbiological profiles may reflect a true decline in anaerobic infection due to improved social conditions and access to health care. the overlap with organisms found in health-care associated pneumonia suggests an increased occurrence of aspiration in these settings. hypoxia is a prominent feature, and patients may progress to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome. this may be accompanied by a systemic inflammatory response with fever, leukocytosis and tachycardia, despite the absence of infection (175,207) recommended empiric antibiotic therapy is amoxicillin-clavulanate. a cephalosporin plus clindamycin or metronidazole may be an acceptable alternative (B II) antimicrobials should be considered for patients with aspiration pneumonitis and persistent or progressive signs and symptoms. in 2014, the PCV13 was registered for use in adults in south africa. the initial indication in south africa was the use of a single dose of PCV13 in adults 50 years, as had been registered elsewhere. at the end of 2015, PCV13 received registration in south africa. two recent clinical studies attest to the clinical efficacy of the PCVs in adults in different settings. the first study was that of the older 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in predominantly HIV-infected adults and adolescents (aged >15 years of age) in Malawi, who had recently recovered from an episode of invasive pneumococcal disease (215) influenza vaccine usually becomes available in south africa from March. it should be given sufficiently early to provide protection for the winter season. influenza vaccines work best among children 2 years and healthy adults. all adults 65 years who have received PPV23 should receive a single dose of PCV13 at least one year later (A II) all adults 65 years who have received PPV23 should receive a single dose of PCV13 followed a year later by PPV23 (A II). all adults 65 years who have received PPV23 should receive a single dose of PCV13 followed a year later (A II). younger adults (18 years) who are vaccine nave with severe comorbid or immunocompromising conditions including HIV infection should receive a single dose of PCV13 at least one year later (A II) all women who are pregnant in the period of influenza vaccine availability (approximately March to June) should be offered influenza vaccination with IIV3 (A ll) patients with CAP can be safely switched from intravenous to oral antibiotics. the patient is able to swallow No vomiting No diarrhoea CAP, community-acquired pneumonia."}
