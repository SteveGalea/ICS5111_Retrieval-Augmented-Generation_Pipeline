{"summary": "hybridoma technology was first invented by two scientists, Georges Kohler and Cesar Milstein. from 1975, the fusion of mouse spleen cells has been carried out for many years with a variety of different aims. monoclonal antibodies have been widely applied in various fields such as diagnosis applications, purification, disease monitoring, identifying prognostic markers and therapy. incomplete Freund's adjuvant was used for the 2nd, 3rd and 4thimmunization. 50 g of purified human IgG was mixed with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant. three days before the second injection, 50 g of antigen (without any adjuvant) was injected intravenously. cloning of Hybridoma Cells by Limiting Dilution (L.D) method. cells were diluted so that contained only one cell in each 10 l. Suitable monoclones possessing high absorbance were selected for further characterization. monoclonal antibodies were purified from ascitic fluid by Ion exchange chromatography based on its isotype. ascitic fluids were filtered through 45 m filter and were diluted 1 to 2 with PBS and fractionated with 40% saturated ammonium sulfate. the precipitated fraction was dialyzed against 0.05 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4. the final dialyze was exchanged against the column washing buffer (Tris 40 mM, pH 8.1) the final dialyze was exchanged against the column washing buffer (Tris 40 mM, pH 8.1) the nitrocellulose membrane and several thicknesses of Whatman chromatography papers were soaked in the transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% V/V methanol, pH 8.3) the wet nitrocellulose membrane was overlaid on the wet Whatman sheets by taking precaution to avoid bubbles. transfer of proteins from gel to nitrocellulose membrane was done in 100V for 3 hours. 0.1 ml of the freshly prepared sodium brohydrate was added and shaked for 2 hours at room temperature. the final solution was precipitated with ammonium sulfate and then was dialyzed against PBS buffer. selective HAT medium (Gibco) was added to the fused cells. cells were seeded into five 96-well microtitre plates (Nunc) containing feeder layer. cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 2-3 days. 100 l of 1:4000 dilution of rabbit anti-mouse IgG was added to the wells. after 15 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 l of stopping solution (0.16 M H2SO4) to each well. cross reactivity of monoclonal antibodies with IgM & IgA was determined. monoclonal antibodies were purified from ascitic fluid by Ion exchange chromatography based on its isotype. ascitic fluids were filtered through 45 m filter and were diluted 1 to 2 with PBS. the precipitated fraction was dialyzed against 0.05 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 containing 0.05 M Nacl. electrophoresis was done in a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel with a mini- PROTEAN electrophoresis instrument (Bio- Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Sigma) Western blotting technique was used to confirm the result of ELISA. the solution was dialyzed against acetate buffer (pH 4.4), overnight at 4 \u00b0c. 8 mg of the purified monoclonal antibody was dissolved in 1 ml sodium carbonate (10 mM, pH 9.5) the final solution was precipitated with ammonium sulfate and then incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. super monoclone related hybridoma cells were injected into the peritoneum of the balb/c mice, which have previously been primed with 0.5ml pristane. after 7-10 days, approximately 5 ml ascitic fluid was harvested from the peritoneum. the titer of mAb in ascitic fluid was examined by ELISA method. results showed that 1/100,000 dilution of conjugate had high absorbance with IgG (above 1) and didn\u2019t show any cross reactivity with IgM & IgA. monoclonal anti- human IgG is very important, significant and as a key reagent for its recognition. production of monoclonal antibody without any cross reactivity with homologous molecules can be used in diagnostic kits of infectious diseases. the best clone designated as supermonoclone was injected intraperitoneally to pristane-injected mice. the production of monoclonal antibody in the ascitic fluid is commercially cost effective. conflict of interest The authors report no conflicts of interest."}
