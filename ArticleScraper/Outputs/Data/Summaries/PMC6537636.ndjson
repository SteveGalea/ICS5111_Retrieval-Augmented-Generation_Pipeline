{"summary": "study aimed to determine the most common bacterial agents causing UTI in different seasons among patients admitted to the inpatient department at BCH, Saudi Arabia. most bacterial strains were gram-negative. it is one of the most frequently occurring infections reported in both inpatients and outpatients. it may not occur if bacteria are introduced into the bladder due to body\u2019s immune defense that helps protect the urinary tract. resistance to an antibiotic may be acquired by a bacterium by horizontal gene transfer mechanism. this resistance may also apply simultaneously to different classes of antibiotics. this resistance may also apply simultaneously to different classes of antibiotics. a total of 44 antibiotic drugs were used among these 379 inpatients. the most commonly used drugs were ciprofloxacin (25.9%), gentamicin (25.3%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (23.3%), cefoxitin (20.6%), and chloramphenicol (1.6%). positive isolates of GNB were mostly in the months of November (3.2%) and December (2.4%); K. pneumoniae was mostly in January (3.4%) and December (1.1%); S. aureus was mostly in August (1.6%), September (0.8%) and October (0.8%); E. coli was mostly in August (1.6%) and January (1.1%); E. faecium was mostly in January (1.6%) and January (1.4%); Acinetobacter spp. were mostly in September ( 15.0 11.3 17.4 18.7 17.9 Positive 1.3 0.6 0.0 0.0 0.6 1.1 Enterococcus faecium Negative 17.4 15.6 11.3 16.9 17.9 17.4 Positive 0.0 0.0 0.5 1.4 1.6 Acinetobacter species Negative 16.6 15.0 11.3 17.2 19.0 18.2 Positive 0.8 0.6 0.0 0.2 0.3 0.8 Providencia stuartii Negative 17.2 15.0 10.8 17.4 18.7 19.0 Positive the less commonly used antibiotics were neomycin (0.3%), polymyxin B (0.3%), bacitracin (0.5%) and methicillin (1.1%). the less commonly used antibiotics were neomycin (0.3%), polymyxin B (0.3%), bacitracin (0.5%) and methicillin (1.1%) resistance and sensitivity pattern of significant most bacteria among antibiotics used (n = 44) Antibiotic Gram-negative bacilli Pseudomonas aeruginosa S (%) R (%) S (%) R (%) Ceftazidime Negative 10 (22.2) 18 (40.0) Positive 1 (2.2) 16 (35.6) Cefoxitin Negative 16 (21.1) 37 (48.7) Positive 1 (1.3) 22 (28.9) Ampicillin Negative 16 (20.5) resistance and sensitivity pattern of significant most bacteria among antibiotics used (n = 44) Antibiotic Enterococcus faecium Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus epidermidis S (%) R (%) S (%) R (%) S (%) R (%) R (%) S (%) R (%) R (%) R (%) R (%) Ciprofloxacin Negative 38 (38.8) 52 (53.1) Positive 0 (0.0) 8 (8.2) the age-wise seasonal intensity of infection among males and females is undocumented. the age-wise seasonal intensity of infection among males and females is undocumented. these triggers vary with respect to gender. the most resistant bacteria found in our study were E. coli (gram-negative) = 54 (71.1%) against cefoxitin, and E. coli (gram-negative) and S. aureus (gram-positive) = 47 (60.3%) and 46 (47.9%) against gentamicin. most gram-negative bacteria were negatively resistant to ampicillin alone. antimicrobial usage has emphasized a close coordination between microbiology department and infection control committee. it entails that multihospital study may not identify the relationship between antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial usage. studies have reported an increase in antibiotic resistance of these bacteria in invasive infections such as UTIs. the relationship between antimicrobial prescribing and antimicrobial resistance was significant, and negatively resistant. the results encourage further evaluation of relationship between antimicrobial usage and resistance."}
