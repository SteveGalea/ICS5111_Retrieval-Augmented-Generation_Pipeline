{"summary": "HSV-1 is a double-stranded DNA virus of the herpesviridae family. it can infect the oral mucosa, eyes, nasal mucosa, oropharynx and nervous system. it may cause severe complications including blindness, atypical pneumonia, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and even death. ICP0, ICP4, ICP22, ICP27, and ICP47 are first transcribed and responsible for early (E) and late (L) viral gene expressions after viral entry. NF-B is recruited onto viral ICP0 promoter to accelerate viral replication in HSV-1 lytic cycle. this could shed light on development of therapeutic strategies for HSV infections. the major components of H. cordata include phenolic compounds, flavones, and alkaloids. flavonoid components such as quercetin, isoquercitrin, rutin, hyperin, and quercitrin exhibit antioxidant, antimutagenic and free radical scavenging capacity. fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin. all cell lines were cultured at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. HCWEs preparation 1,000 g dried H. cordata was boiled in 2 L water for 3 hours. 1X106 cells were pretreated with various concentrations of HCWEs at 37\u00b0C for 3 hours. after incubation, HCWEs-pretreated cells were washed with PBS and then infected with 100 pfu HSV. the inhibitory activities were analyzed by plaque assay. time-of-addition assay 1X106 Vero cells were infected with 1 m.o.i. of HSV for 1 hour. after absorption, HCWEs were added to medium at indicated hours-post infection. RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and real-time PCR RNAs were extracted from virus-infected or mock-infected cells by Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) luciferase assay All transfections were carried out in triplicate in 96-well plates. transfectants were infected with HSV at 1 m.o.i. after 24 hours, transfectants were infected. the activity of Renilla luciferase was used as an internal control to normalize transfection efficiency. pure compounds, quercetin, isoquercitrin, quercitrin, hyperin, rutin and acyclovir (ACV) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or absolute ethanol. infected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stained with crystal violet. the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet. after 3 days, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. 1X106 Vero cells were infected with 1 m.o.i. of HSV for 1 hour. after absorption, HCWEs were added to medium at indicated hours-post infection. RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and real-time PCR RNAs were extracted from virus-infected or mock-infected cells. Western blot assay Cells were harvested in RIPA lysis buffer. protein concentration was measured by the BCA protein assay (BioRad) -actin acts as an internal control. both PCR fragments were cloned into pGL3.0 basic vector (Promega) 2X103 cells were seeded 24 hours prior to transfection. the activity of Renilla luciferase was used as an internal control to normalize transfection efficiency. HCWEs showed low cytotoxicity on vero cells (CC50 was greater than 100 mg/ml) EC50 of HCWEs against HSV-1, Acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 (HSV-AR) and HSV-2 were 0.692 mg/ml, 1.11 mg/ml and 0.3 mg/ml, respectively. s and the plaque reduction assay was performed to determine which stage HCWEs act on HSV-1 infection. the pretreated Vero cells showed no obviously inhibitory effect on HSV-1 infection at a concentration of 10 mg/ml (S1 Fig.) however, in the cases of HSV-1, HSV-2, and even HSV-AR pretreated with 0.01 mg/ml HCWEs, the plaque formation was largely inhibited. 1X106 Vero cells were incubated with HSV at 1 m.o.i. at 4\u00b0C. the unbound virus was washed with ice-cold PBS. the gD of cell-bound HSV-1 was detected by Western blot assays. the percentages of inhibition on HSV-1, HSV-2, and HSV-AR penetration at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml HCWEs were 93.62%, 97.76%, and 97.99%, respectively. the translocation of viral tegument protein VP16 into the nucleus and expression of viral immediate-early protein ICP4 have been used as the indicators to examine HSV entry. HCWEs block recombinant gD binding onto host cells, cell-to-cell spreading, and viral entry into host cells. recombinant gD proteins were expressed by baculovirus expression system and incubated with Vero cells at 37\u00b0C or 4\u00b0C for 1 hour. 1X106 Vero cells were incubated with recombinant gD (r-gD) proteins at 37\u00b0C (A) or 4\u00b0C (B) in the presence or absence of indicated concentrations of HCWEs. cell lysates were analyzed by western blot assays with anti-gD and anti-actin antibodies. expression levels of viral late genes such as gB, gC, gD, gE, gH, and UL13 were downregulated in presence of HCWEs. 1X106 Vero cells were infected with 1 m.o.i. HSV-1 at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. HCWEs (1 mg/ml) were added at different time points. HCWEs suppress the gene expression of HSV-1. 1X106 Vero cells were infected with HSV-1 at 1 m.o.i. in the presence or absence of HCWEs. RNAs were extracted from the virus-infected cells at 2 h.p.i. HCWEs inhibited NF-B translocation in a dose-dependent manner. the luciferase activity of pGL-ICP0 Wt transfected cells increased up to 3,000-fold compared with the vector control, pGL, in HSV-1 infection. the luciferase activity of ICP0-Mut was significantly decreased compared with ICP0-Wt in HSV infection. there was no obvious suppression between HCWEs treatment and not. the results implied that HSV-1 ICP0 promoter activity was at least partly regulated by NF-B. p value0.05 presented comparison of pGL-ICP0 Wt and pGL-ICP0 Mut without HCWEs. two additional human epithelial carcinoma cells HEp-2 and A549 cells were tested for cytotoxicity and anti-HSV activity by the plaque reduction assay. quercetin, but not rutin or isoquercitrin, targeted virus particles directly and inhibited viral entry. rutin, quercetin, and isoquercitrin also inhibited NF-B activation. HCWEs target to virus particles and block viral binding and penetration in HSV infection. HCWEs also inhibited ICP0 promoter expression through suppressing HSV-induced NF-B activation. selective index scores of HCWEs to HSV-1, HSV-AR, and HSV-2 were 144.51, 90.09, and 333.33 respectively. the inhibitory effects of ACV on HSV were also analyzed. HCWEs inhibit HSV infections by targeting virus particles directly. HCWEs-pretreated HSV-1 and HSV-2 were incubated with vero cells at 4\u00b0C. unbound viruses were washed out with ice-cold PBS. gD of cell-bound virus was detected by Western blot assays. HCWEs inhibited HSV-1, HSV-2, and HSV-AR binding ability in a dose-dependent manner. 0.1 mg/ml HCWEs inhibited 93.27%, 78.65%, and 92.44% of HSV-1, HSV-2, and HSV-AR plaque formation respectively. ment protein VP16 into the nucleus and viral ICP4 expression were used as indicators to examine HSV entry. HCWEs were added to the host cells at the viral binding or penetration stage as described in Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B. nuclear fraction and total proteins were extracted to examine the viral VP16 translocation and viral ICP4 expression. HCWEs block recombinant gD binding to host cells. 1X106 Vero cells were incubated with recombinant gD (r-gD) proteins at 37\u00b0C. recombinant gD proteins were washed out with PBS. cell lysates were frozen and thawed three times and then titrated by plaque assay. HCWEs suppress virus replication through regulating viral late genes. HCWEs suppress viral IE gene expression via inhibiting NF-B activation. vero cells were first infected with HSV-1 followed by treatment of HCWEs for 24 hours. HCWEs inhibited HSV-1 protein expression at 24 h.p.i. HCWEs suppress the gene expression of HSV-1. 1X106 Vero cells were infected with HSV-1 at 1 m.o.i. in the presence or absence of HCWEs. RNAs were extracted from the virus-infected cells at 2 h.p.i. luciferase activity of pGL-ICP0 Wt transfected cells increased up to 3,000-fold. but the exact NF-B binding site on ICP0 promoter is not identified yet. only one NF-B binding site was predicted within the HSV-1 ICP0 promoter. HCWEs suppressed ICP0 transcription in NF-B-dependent manner by promoter assays. 1X106 cells were infected with HSV-1 at 1 m.o.i. in presence of HCWEs. plaque reduction assays showed that HCWEs inhibited HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication in both HEp-2 and A549 cells. major compounds of HCWEs possess anti-HSV activity. rutin, isoquercitrin, and quercetin demonstrated anti-HSV activity. 1X106 Vero cells were infected with 100 pfu HSV-1 pretreated with rutin (filled triangle), quercetin (filled square), and isoquercitrin (filled circle) and plaque assays were used to determine the inhibitory effects. -actin was used as an internal control for protein loading. HCWEs affected multiple stages of HSV infection, such as viral entry and viral gene expression. quercetin possesses anti-HSV activities, particularly on inhibition of viral binding, viral penetration, and host NF-B activation. HCWEs suppressed NF-B activation and attenuated NF-B mediated ICP0 transcription. VP16-HCF complex then binds to the cellular protein, OCT-1. NF-B is a host transcriptional regulator and can be activated in almost all types of cells by many types of stimulations. the compounds with inhibition of NF-B activation have been reported to exhibit anti-HSV activity. Resveratrol and Lornixicam could downregulate NF-B and impair viral IE genes expressions and prevent recurrent herpetic stromal keratitis. the anti-HSV mechanisms of rutin are still unclear. quercetin and isoquercitrin blocked HSV replication by inhibiting NF-B activation in virus infection. HCWEs-pretreated Vero cells were seeded onto 6-well plates, treated with HCWEs and then infected with 100 pfu/well HSV-1. the inhibitory activities were analyzed by plaque assays. 1X106 Vero cells were infected with HSV-1 at 1 m.o.i. in the presence or absence of HCWEs. RNAs were extracted from the virus-infected cells at 16 h.p.i. and analyzed for viral ICP0, ICP4, ICP22, ICP27 and ICP47 expressions."}
