{"summary": "acute respiratory viral infections are common causes of substantial morbidity and mortality in pediatric and adult patients. an early detection of respiratory virus (RV) infections enables clinicians to initiate immediate therapeutic interventions that can reduce complications, antibiotic use, and unnecessary laboratory testing (1\u20134) aims of this study were to evaluate the analytical performance of the Allplex assay and to compare the performance with those of the AdvanSure RV real-time PCR kit (AdvanSure; LG Life Sciences, Republic of Korea) and the PowerChek pandemic H1N1/H3N2/H5N1 real-time PCR kit (PowerChek; Kogene Biotech, Republic of Korea) for RV detection and INF A virus subtyping. \u20130.95 BoV 100 3/3 31.0\u2013100 99.8 411/412 98.4\u201399.9 0.86 0.58\u20131.00 CoV 229E 100 12/12 69.9\u2013100 95.5 401/403 98.0\u201399.9 0.92 0.81\u20131.00 CoV OC43 92.3 12/13 62.1\u201399.6 99.7 401/402 98.4\u201399.9 0.92 0.81\u20131.00 CoV NL63 100 9 discordant results were observed in 32 specimens. a total of 22 results were allplex positive and AdvanSure negative. a majority (76.5%) of the results were concordant with those from the Allplex assay. the AdvanSure assay gave false-positive HRV results for two samples. one sample showed cross-reactivity between HRV and HEV. the Allplex assay correctly detected HEV in the sample. were 50 copies/reaction, except for PIV type 1 (10 copies/reaction), PIV type 4 and MPV (103 copies/reaction) all 21 different microorganisms gave negative results, and nonspecific positive reactions were not observed. two of the 417 specimens included in this study generated invalid results in the Allplex assay. at least one RV was detected in 302 specimens (247 with a single virus, 48 with two viruses, 5 with three viruses, and 2 with four viruses) the results of the remaining 415 specimens were analyzed. 88/92 88.6\u201398.6 97.2 314/323 94.6\u201398.6 0.91 0.86\u20130.96 INF A 98.0 48/49 87.8\u201399.9 100 366/366 98.7\u2013100 0.99 0.97\u20131.00 INF B 90.0 9/10 54.1\u201399.5 100 405/405 98.8\u2013100 0.95 0.84\u20131.00 MPV 100 14/14 73.2\u2013100 100 401/401 98. total of 22 results were Allplex positive and AdvanSure negative. 90.9% (20/22) were confirmed positive by uniplex PCR and sequencing. majority (76.5% [26/34] of the results were concordant with those from the Allplex assay. a total of 48 specimens with INF A virus were included in the analysis. discordant results were observed in four specimens, of which three were subtyped H1N1-pdm09 by only the Allplex assay. the remaining specimen was subtyped H1N1-pdm09 by only the PowerChek assay. there is a wide array of molecular technologies emerging for the detection of RVs from clinical specimens. some of these technologies have potential for high-throughput batch testing. others will allow for rapid near-patient testing (6, 7). the Allplex assay is best suited for batch testing, which is capable of handling a maximum of 96 rRT-PCRs per batch. the application of the Microlab Nimbus IVD reduces the HOT to 15 min to test 24 samples. the majority of the discrepant results were concordant with the results from the Allplex assay after discrepancy resolution. six specimens that were HEV positive were confirmed by uniplex PCR and sequencing. except for the result from one sample with a low viral load, all results were confirmed positive. this prevented a robust evaluation of diagnostic performance. further studies are needed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy. nucleic acids were extracted from 450-l specimens with 10 l bacteriophage MS2 added as an exogenous internal control using the StarMag 96 virus kit (Seegene) the final elution volume was 100 l for each sample. the powerChek assay is MFDS approved and is a CE-IVD-certified one-step rRT-PCR assay for IFN A virus subtyping. the assay detects INF A subtypes H1N1-pdm09, H3N2 and H5N1. serial dilutions of the prepared plasmid DNA were made from 105 to 1 copies per reaction to determine the analytical sensitivity of the assay. all other standard strains were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) totals of 21 or 24 replicates of each dilution step were performed. all specimens were stored at 70\u00b0C until testing with or without the PowerChek assay. all specimens were stored at 70\u00b0C until testing with or without the PowerChek assay. rRT-PCR was performed in a total volume of 20 l (15 l PCR mixture and 5 l template RNA) using the 7500 fast real-time PCR system. nucleic acids were extracted from 140-l stored specimens and eluted in 50 l using the QIAamp DSP viral RNA minikit. serially diluted plasmids containing the target gene were used to determine the analytical sensitivity. the pUC19 vector was used for plasmid DNA preparation. serial dilutions of the prepared plasmid DNA were made from 105 to 1 copies per reaction."}
