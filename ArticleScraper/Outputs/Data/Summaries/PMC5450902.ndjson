{"summary": "96 (3%) of 3693 pregnant women had HRV-positive febrile respiratory illnesses. infants born to pregnant women with HRV febrile illness had a 1.6-fold increased risk of being LBW compared with those with non-HRV febrile illness. a community-based, prospective placebo-controlled, randomized trial of maternal influenza immunization of 3693 pregnant women and their infants conducted in rural southern Nepal from 2011 to 2014. in brief, illness episodes were identified through longitudinal household-based active weekly surveillance of women from the second trimester of pregnancy until 6 months postpartum. a composite adverse birth outcome was defined as an infant being preterm, LBW, and/or SGA. real-time PCR for HRV was performed as described, with the modification of a degenerate base at the 3\u2019 end of the forward primer. maximum likelihood method with 100 bootstrap replicates using PhyML 3.0 within DIVEIN [26]. Neighbor joining trees were drawn and edited using FigTree v1.4.1. Sequence data were not of sufficient length to be submitted to GenBank but are available upon request. febrile HRV respiratory illness incidence was 58.3/1000 p-y. incidence after delivery was 95 of 1497 p-y, or 64.1/1000 p-y. no difference in maternal body mass index was observed. flu vaccination during pregnancy 50 (52%) 1808 (50%) 1.06 (0.37\u20133.10).91 Maternal body mass index at enrollment 20.5 (18.8\u201322.4) 20.7 (19.0\u201322.6) 0.97 (0.81\u20131.17).77 Maternal education, years 3 (0\u20139) 5 (0\u201310) 0.97 (0.86\u20131.09).86 Gestational age at enrollment, weeks 18 (12\u201321) 17 (13\u201323) 0.98 (0.91\u20131.07).69 First 15 in household 1 (1\u20133) 2 (1\u20133) 0.96 (0.68\u20131.35).81 Number household members 7 (4\u201310) 7 (5\u201310) 0.99 (0.85\u20131.14).82 Male sex of infant 56 (58.3%) 1881 (52.3%) 1.26 (0.43\u20133.71)68 Infant alive at birth 95 (99%) 3526 (98.3%) 1.57 (0.01\u2013295.74).87 Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; HRV, human rhinovirus; pregnant women with non-HRV febrile viral respiratory illness compared to those with no febrile respiratory illness during pregnancy. compared with 2.80 kg (2.50\u20133.08) among infants not exposed to respiratory illness during pregnancy. compared with 2.80 kg (2.50\u20133.08) among infants not exposed to respiratory illness during pregnancy. low birth weight (n = 2752)b 28 (37.8%) 109 (23.8%) 552 (24.9%) 1.0 (0.8\u20131.2) bInfants weighed within 72 hours were included in the low birth weight analysis. dRelative risk for HRV is the increased risk of having the adverse outcome if the febrile illness additionally involved HRV versus no HRV. the lack of HRV infection in the first trimester is due to enrollment of women into the study beginning at 17 weeks gestation or later. there was a trend toward a higher rate of PTBs among mothers with non-HRV respiratory illness compared with those without respiratory illness (91 of 588 [15.5%] vs 382 of 2961 [12.9%]; RR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0\u20131.5; P =.075) aWilcoxon-rank sum was used to compare symptom duration between pregnant and postpartum women with febrile HRV. 41 (21.5%) of the 191 HRV-positive samples had computed tomography values of 30. a majority of the samples sequenced, whereas Species B and C accounted for 2 of 27 (7.4%) and 1 of 27 (3.7%) respectively. the proportion of samples sequenced compared with the total was small. eleven (11%) pregnant women with HRV had an additional respiratory virus detected. birth weight was measured within 72 hours of birth in the majority of infants. previous studies showed that febrile HRV respiratory infection occurred year-round with a peak in October and a nadir in June. low birth weight is the result of either preterm delivery or poor growth of the fetus. IUGR was the primary mechanism leading to LBW associated with HRV. only 41 (1%) of infants are affected by all 3 adverse birth outcomes. febrile illness during pregnancy alone was not associated with an increased risk of LBW in our study. of mothers with febrile non-HRV respiratory illness, only 24% of the infants were LBW. the birth weight effect does not appear to be due to increased duration or severity of illness in pregnant women with LBW infants. use of subjective fever as criteria for respiratory illness may have also decreased our ability to detect respiratory illnesses. we also did not conduct surveillance before 17 weeks gestation. some women had infections earlier in pregnancy that we were not able to identify in our study. HRV is the most common cause of febrile respiratory illness in pregnant women in rural southern Nepal during our study period. this may represent a potential modifiable risk factor to reduce risk of LBW infants, particularly in developing countries."}
