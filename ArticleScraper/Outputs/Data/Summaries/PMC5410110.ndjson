{"summary": "EBOV is the most virulent species, with a case mortality of up to 90 %, while the Reston strain is virtually non-pathogenic in humans. EBOV is the most virulent species, with a case mortality of up to 90 %, while the Reston strain is virtually non-pathogenic in humans. dengue virus (Farias et al., 2014), chikungunya virus (Delogu & de Lamballerie, 2011; Khan et al., 2010), arenaviruses (Pichinde, Mopeia and Lassa), henipaviruses (Hendra and Nipah), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (Ferraris et al., 2015), rabies virus (T chloroquine is known to limit the acidification process of endosomes. other effects of chloroquine have also been suggested. in vitro assay was conducted using a human cell line. at 1 h post-infection with 500 TCID50 per well, medium was replaced with fresh medium containing chloroquine. after 3 days, viral RNA levels in the supernatants were quantified. results showed that the CT values increased, indicative of a reduction in viral replication.

EBOV antigen staining in the spleen and liver of EBOV-challenged guinea pigs treated with chloroquine or untreated. scattered cells positive for viral antigen in both red and white pulp, predominantly in the former. results showed that the CT values increased, indicative of a reduction in viral replication. when tested at 4.7 and 0.47 M, the results were statistically significant. however, at the lower concentration of 0.094 M, results were not statistically different (P = 0.1050, Mann\u2013Whitney statistical test) Chloroquine concentration (M) 10 3.33 1.11 0.37 0.53 0.26 0.45 0.27 0.24 0.08 0.17 Chloroquine did not protect against Ebola disease in guinea pigs Twelve guinea pigs were challenged with EBOV, and 6 h afterwards a group of six were administered 33.75 mg kg 1 chloroquine orally. the dose used was based on 90 mg kg 1 being shown to be efficacious against EB guinea pigs were scheduled to be treated with chloroquine at 33.75 mg kg 1. the first two animals that received intravenous chloroquine died within 30 s of administration, so the study was aborted. new tab Viral RNA levels in blood in EBOV-challenged guinea pigs treated with chloroquine compared with untreated controls. similar severity of histological changes was present in chloroquine-treated guinea pigs. guinea pigs treated with chloroquine or untreated. EBOV antigen staining in the spleen and liver of guinea pigs treated with chloroquine. tered cells positive for viral antigen in both red and white pulp, predominantly in the former. inset, higher magnification image ( 227). inset, higher magnification image (227). inset, higher magnification ( 227) of a focal lesion. time-of-addition experiments with human and avian influenza viruses showed that the inhibitory effect of chloroquine was maximal when the drug had been added at the time of infection. the maximum reduction in viral RNA levels observed was approximately 3CT, which is estimated to be equivalent to 1-log. EC50 was shown to be 1.77 g ml 1 using a live Ebola virus. these concentrations fall within the clinically achievable ranges in plasma during malaria therapy. six animals treated with chloroquine and five untreated control animals had generally minimal to marked changes in the liver and spleen. two of three mock-challenged mice survived twice daily repeat dosing at 90 mg kg 1 for a period of 8 days. the same mouse strain and a similar age range were used in the two studies. a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial failed to demonstrate any positive effects for treatment of acute chikungunya infections. a similar observation was shown with influenza A virus, with in vitro activity reported yet minimal effects on influenza infection using in vivo models with mice and ferrets. chloroquine phosphate (Selleckchem) was diluted to 5 mM with sterile water before further dilution to the required concentration with Eagle's minimum essential medium (Sigma) concentrations were made at double the final dilution to take into account an equal volume of virus suspension to be added. MRC-5 cells were seeded into 96-well plates. RNA extraction and PCR assays were repeated for effects against EBOV using MRC-5 cells. changes to previous method included a 10-fold higher viral inoculum being used (approx. 5000 TCID50 per well) samples were harvested after 2 days. guinea pigs were anaesthetized with 1.5 to 2 % isofluorane in oxygen in an induction chamber until full sedation was achieved. all procedures were undertaken according to the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. animals were humanely euthanized by intraperitoneal or intravenous injection of 200 mg ml 1 sodium pentobarbital. blood solution was transferred to 600 l RLT buffer (Qiagen) for RNA extraction and PCR. clonal, anti-EBOV VP40 antibody (IBT Bioservices) was incubated with the slides for 60 min. 3,3\u2032-Diaminobenzidine chromogen and haematoxylin counterstains were used to visualize the slides. MRC-5 cells were seeded into 96-well plates. RNA extraction and PCR assay Samples were prepared in Qiagen Buffer RLT. vessel was transferred into 96-well sample plates at CL-3 for thermal inactivation at 60 \u00b0C for 30 min prior to removal to CL-2 for RNA purification. RNA was eluted in 60 l nuclease-free water. animals infected with EBOV were housed in an isolator under climate-control conditions in a CL-4 room. food and sterile water were available ad libitum. all procedures were undertaken according to the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. animals were humanely euthanized by intraperitoneal or intravenous injection of 200 mg ml 1 sodium pentobarbital. samples were stored in RNAprotect animal blood tubes (Qiagen) samples were mixed and stored at 80 \u00b0C until processing and to lyse red blood cells. Diaminobenzidine chromogen and haematoxylin counterstains were used to visualize slides."}
