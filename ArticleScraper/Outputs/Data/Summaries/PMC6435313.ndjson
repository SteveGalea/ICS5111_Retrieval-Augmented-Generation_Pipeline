{"summary": "adaptive memory was proposed to describe the differential performance of the human mind in a survival situation. in the first scenario\u2014survival\u2014participants had to imagine themselves in a foreign land without basic subsistence supplies such as water and food and with the need to avoid predators. participants were shown a list of words and asked to assess which of them would be relevant or irrelevant in dealing with the survival condition. studies have also revealed that people better remember animate stimuli than inanimate stimuli (e.g., table and mountain) these findings reinforce the adaptive role of memory, as better recall of animated stimuli may have enabled our ancestors to avoid predators and potential enemies. the idea of a human memory apt to remember any type of adaptive information well must be relativized. a human memory capable of recalling adaptive information in a hierarchical way is an interesting approach to understanding the functioning of the naturalistic human mind when confronted with situations of risk. we evaluated the possible adaptation of the human memory to favor information that is relevant to the treatment of serious diseases. in this study, we evaluated the possible adaptation of the human memory to favor information that is relevant to the treatment of serious diseases. to this end, we used medical practices involving the use of medicinal plants as a medical research model. study aimed to provide important insights into how the human mind may have evolved to remember and retain in memory adaptive information of human medical systems based on the use of medicinal plants. participants were recruited through an online form available on the survey monkey digital platform. plants and diseases were considered units of information available in a medical system. for each category, different adaptive values were assigned according to disease severity. communicable chronic and infectious diseases account for 36 and 14.2 million deaths. common conditions such as diarrhea are among the leading causes of death among children under five years of age. the plant-disease pairs associated with diseases currently disseminated in a social context, such as dengue and Zika fever, may be more memorable since they were frequently commented on by the media. the recall test consisted of retrieving the plant-disease pairs of words. participants were instructed to complete a form with lines numbered one through fifteen. the form contained instructions: \"Be exact as possible, do not worry if you cannot remember all of the information\" participants were instructed to write down the recalled information on a form. the form had the same structure as the one used in phase I. the data were initially assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. the cognitive salience index was calculated by the ratio between the citation frequency of each pair (F) and the product of its average position in the lists (mP) and the total number of participants (N), as proposed by Sutrop [35]. to determine whether prior knowledge of the medicinal plants influenced the recall, we removed all\u2014plant-disease\u2014pairs associated with medicinal plants that were declared as previously known by the participants. the recall error rate in our study was 71.4%, which was higher than that observed in other studies [13]. the study was conducted with 200 undergraduate and graduate students from the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, northeast Brazil, including 107 women and 93 men aged between 18 and 51 years. plants and diseases were considered units of information available in a medical system. for each category, different adaptive values were assigned according to disease severity. plant-disease pairs included in the categories chronic and transmissible infectious diseases were considered to have greater adaptive value due to their high severity. the plant-disease pairs were included in the category of emerging and reemerging diseases to identify a possible conformity bias. the plant-disease pairs associated with diseases currently disseminated in a social context, such as dengue and Zika fever, may be more memorable since they were frequently commented on by the media when data collection occurred. isease pairs of words by students of the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, brazil. participants were instructed to complete a form with lines numbered one through fifteen. the form contained the following instructions: \"Be exact as possible, do not worry if you cannot remember all of the information\" the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to verify differences in recalling the plant-disease pairs between the categories of major and minor diseases. the pairs for participant x were ordered as the first pair recalled, the second pair recalled, and so on. for each plant-disease pair, a score was assigned according to its recalled position. the cognitive salience index was calculated by the ratio between the citation frequency of each pair (F) and the product of its average position in the lists (mP) and the total number of participants (N), according to the following formula: S = F/(N*mP), as proposed by Sutrop [35]. a null distribution was created by using Monte Carlo simulations with 5,000 randomizations. study was conducted with 200 undergraduate and graduate students from the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, northeast Brazil. the students were recruited through an online form available on the survey monkey digital platform. the forms\u2019 access links were made available on the official website of the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco and on social networks linked to the institution. disease category Plant-disease Chronic diseases Moror\u00f3-Stroke Cumaru-Cancer Angico-Diabetes Infectious diseases Mint-AIDS Cumaru-Tuberculosis Boldo-Measles. plants and diseases were considered units of information available in a medical system. the plant-disease pairs associated with an experimental control were considered to be of little adaptive relevance. in this study, we considered esthetic uses as a counterpoint to medical conditions; that is, these conditions would not lead to changes in the health status of the individual. the memorization time for the plant-disease pairs was adapted from the protocol proposed by Nairne, Thompson and Pandeirada. phase II of the experiment was conducted 30 days after phase I and began with an additional memory test. only 37 volunteers attended, and 24 volunteers were women. the plant-disease pairs were ordered for each participant based on the individual recall lists. for each plant-disease pair, a score was assigned according to its recalled position. a recalled pair in the first position received a score of 15, one in the second position received a score of 14. the cognitive salience index was calculated by the ratio between the citation frequency of each pair (F) and the product of its average position in the lists (mP) and the total number of participants (N), according to the following formula: S = F/(N*mP), as proposed by Sutrop [35]. a null distribution was created by using Monte Carlo simulations with 5,000 randomizations. the pairs of words in the category of common conditions were the ones that differed most in recall (Table 2). the mean recall for pairs of words in the category of common conditions was higher than that for pairs in the other disease categories (Table 3). the retention test of pairs of words was performed after a period of 30 days. the mean retention observed for pairs of words in the category of common conditions was higher than that for pairs in the other disease categories.
