{"summary": "the author postulated that the patient most likely experienced routine acute episodes of Picornaviridae infection. the overarching diagnosis was presumptive, as biopsy and/or serologies were not obtained on the reservist. ULTE may be linked to EBV, parvovirus B19, Adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, or HHV 6 and 7.4. the likelihood of all of the patient\u2019s subsequent URTIs being caused exclusively by Adenovirus would be exceedingly low. reservists present a unique health maintenance challenge as they may complete a duty tour and drop out of military health system visibility for weeks to months. the inherent design of some reserve component programs makes even the discovery of a case such as this difficult at best."}
