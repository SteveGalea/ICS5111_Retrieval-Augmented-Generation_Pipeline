{"summary": "TGEV is an enveloped virus with a positive-stranded RNA genome approximately 28.5-kb in size. it consists of four structural proteins: the spike (S), the integral membrane (M) glycoprotein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. about two-thirds of the entire RNA from the 5\u2032 end comprise open reading frames 1a and 1ab. lithium salts have been used to treat diseases such as 'gout and rheumatic gout', 'Bright's disease', epilepsy, syphilis, acute mania and depressive episodes [15]. lithium chloride (LiCl) inhibits cell infection by TGEV. the effect of the drug on cell infection by TGEV was assessed by time-dependent drug addition. cells were cultured in respective medium supplemented with 10% newborn bovine serum (NBS, Excell Bio. China) at 37\u00b0C in the CO2 incubator. TGEV strain PUR46-MAD was propagated in ST or PK-15 cells. the cells were incubated with dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO (150 l/well) and the tray was shaken gently for 10 min, after washing with PBS. cell survival rate was determined as drug average OD value/control average OD value. the 50% cytostatic concentration (CC50) was defined as the concentration that inhibits proliferation of exponentially growing cells by 50%. pfu/ml was incubated with serially diluted LiCl in medium at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. after washing three times with PBS, the cells were overlaid with 1% methylcellulose in medium. cells were infected with TGEV at an MOI of 0.3, 3, or 30 at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. infected and mock-treated cells were incubated with MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS, 10 l/well) at 37\u00b0C for 4 h. after washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with DMSO. RT-PCR was used to amplify a partial S gene designated as S-AD. beta-actin was performed as described for the S-AD gene except that the annealing temperature were 47.6\u00b0C, 53\u00b0C and 58.8\u00b0C respectively. the PCR products were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel. cDNA 5 l, oligo dT primer 1 l, dNTP (10 mM) 1 l, RNAse inhibitor 0.5 l, sterile water 7.5 l, MLV 1 l, 5RT-PCR buffer 4 l. the reaction was performed at 30\u00b0C for 10 min, 42\u00b0C for 60 min, and 95\u00b0C for 5 min. a-actin fragment mean Ct value was used as a measure of the relative fragment. for each experimental condition, real-time PCR was conducted in quadruplicates. difference in the Ct of untreated versus each treated condition was calculated by the 2Ct method. the cells on 24-well plates were infected with TGEV for 1 h. the cells were incubated with 25 mM LiCl after three times washing with PBS. flow cytometry was used to further analyze cell apoptosis. 5 l FITC-conjugated AnnexinV and 5 l PI were added to the cells and incubated at room temperature for 15 min in the dark. the samples were analyzed within 1 h post-staining. the viability rates of the two cell lines analyzed, ST and PK cells, were above 95%. no morphological differences were observed between drug-treated and mock-treated cells at these concentrations. proliferation of ST and PK cells was not affected by LiCl at concentrations below 25 mM. assays showed some inhibition was observed at 5 mM LiCl. inhibition rates of 80% were observed when the drug was added within the first 12 h p.i. even at 48 h.p.i, the inhibitory effect was still observed. cells were infected with TGEV at an MOI of 30 followed by addition of 25 mM LiCl at the indicated time (hpi) the reduced virus titer was calculated using MTT assays by measuring OD492 value at 24 h post-infection. the supernatant of the infected cells were collected at the different time points indicated and subjected to separate plaque assays. RNA was extracted from cell lysates with or without LiCl treatment. the delta Ct value was measured at least in triplicate. the relative amplification of 3CLpro and TGEV-S-X was normalized to that of beta-actin and calculated using 2Ct method. at 30 hpi, the early apoptosis of TGEV-infected cells were significantly decreased after treatment with 25 mM LiCl. at 40 hpi, most cells were at a stage of late apoptosis, which was also inhibited by drug treatment. PDTC was a potent apoptosis inhibitor in terms of the inhibitory effect on cell apoptosis induced by H2O2. both agents also decreased the number of apoptotic cells induced by TGEV effectively. well plate were mock infected (Cell control) or infected with TGEV alone (TGEV infected cells), TGEV+PDTC (5 M) (PDTC treated cells), TGEV+LiCl (25 mM) (LiCl treated cells) at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. titer of TGEV applied was at an MOI of 0.3 followed by Annexin V and PI staining. the effect of LiCl on cell proliferation was determined by 3\u2013 (4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo (-z-y1) 3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assays. the cells were incubated with medium (80 l/well) and 0.5% MTT solution (20 l/well) at 37\u00b0C for 4 h. methylcellulose in EMEM (1 ml/well), after virus absorption at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. cells were fixed with 3% formalin in PBS (200 l/well) for 30 min at room temperature. then staining with 1% crystal violet (w/v) diluted in 5% ethanol. the cells were incubated with TGEV at an MOI of 0.3, 3, or 30 at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. after washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with LiCl at different concentrations at 37\u00b0C. the cells were incubated with DMSO at 37\u00b0C for 4 h. ural gene encoding the 3CLprotease was used as an internal reference. the housekeeping gene, beta-actin was used as an internal reference. RT-PCR was performed using a commercial kit (Qiagen, Germany) real-time RT-PCR was performed using a commercial kit (Fastgene, China) the reverse transcription was performed in total of 20 l volume consisting of cDNA 5 l, oligo dT primer 1 l, dNTP (10 mM) 1 l, RNAse inhibitor 0.5 l, sterile water 7.5 l, MLV 1 l, 5RT-PCR buffer 4 l. PCR parameters included 95\u00b0C for 10 s; 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 5 s and 60\u00b0C for 34 s. expression level of TGEV S-X and TGEV 3CLpro in TGEV-infected ST cells was normalized to that of beta-actin. s in 96-well plates were infected with TGEV at a concentration of 25 mM. the cells were infected with TGEV at an MOI of 30 for 1 h. the cells were incubated with 25 mM LiCl after three times. the cells were incubated with specific rabbit anti-caspase-3 antibody (Beijing Biosynthesis, China) for 1 h followed incubation with fluoresceine isothiocyanate conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zhongshan, China) both antibodies were 1:100 diluted in 1% BSA. flow cytometry was used to further analyze cell apoptosis. mock treated cells were used as control. to analyze the inhibitory effect of PDTC and LiCl on TGEV induced cell apoptosis, ST cells in 24-well plate were infected with TGEV alone, TGEV+PDTC, or TGEV+LiCl at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. concentrations 1 to 5 are 100, 50, 25, 20 and 10 mM for PK-15 cells. concentrations 1 to 5 are 100, 50, 25, 20 and 10 mM for PK-15 cells respectively. cells or the TGEV inoculum were treated with concentrations up to 25 mM of LiCl prior to infection. time-of-addition effect of LiCl on TGEV replication was analyzed. inhibition rates of 80% were observed when the drug was added within the first 12 h p.i. the extent of inhibition by different concentrations of LiCl was the same whether virus production was assayed at 32 or 40 h.p.i. even at 48 h.p.i, the inhibitory effect of the drug to TGEV-infected cells was still observed. 3CLpro and TGEV-S-X gene were treated at a concentration of 5 to 25 mM of LiCl. the relative amplification of 3CLpro and TGEV-S-X gene was normalized to that of beta-actin. the delta Ct value was measured at least in triplicate. sis Apoptosis is a characteristic feature of TGEV-infected cells. apoptosis was quantified by flow cytometry at either 30 or 40 h.p.i. e-3 is an enzyme involved in the apoptosis of cells. expression of caspase-3 was induced in TGEV-infected cells. but drastically reduced in cells treated with LiCl. the inhibitory effect of both agents on TGEV induced cell apoptosis was evaluated. titer of TGEV applied was at an MOI of 0.3 followed by Annexin V and PI staining. the titer of TGEV applied was at an MOI of 0.3. more recently, LiCl was found to be effective in preventing infection by IBV, an avian coronavirus, in vitro [17], [18]. the findings regarding the inhibitory effect of LiCl on IBV are novel, because an inhibitory effect had been reported previously only on several DNA viruses. we performed an evaluation of the antiviral effect of LiCl on TGEV in two cell lines. sensitivity of coronavirus to LiCl is a general feature of this virus family. it has been suggested that LiCl may act as an inhibitor of the DNA virus herpes simplex virus [15]. it has been suggested that LiCl may act as an inhibitor of the DNA virus herpes simplex virus. coronaviruses TGEV and PEDV are equally sensitive to LiCl treatment. BRV showed a similar sensitivity to the inhibitor. TGEV is the first coronavirus documented to trigger apoptosis in infected cells. apoptosis-associated caspase activation of TGEV and SARS-CoV has been reported. we therefore anticipate that LiCl may have protective effects on apoptosis."}
