{"summary": "in the case of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection, multiple cellular proteins called restriction factors constitute a first line of antiviral defense by blocking specific steps of the virus cycle. restriction factors are proteins that directly inhibit the replication of a variety of viral families by targeting conserved mechanisms shared by viruses. PRRs recognize conserved motifs expressed on pathogens called pathogen-associated-molecular patterns (PAMPs) there are hundreds of ISGs encoding antiviral proteins such as the protein kinase R (PKR) or the 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) a description of restriction factors antiviral mechanisms and their induction by IFN, we will discuss how they can modulate immunity, in particular, innate immunity. this review will allow a better understanding of the intricate interplay between restriction factors-mediated intrinsic immunity and innate immunity. adaptors used by human TLRs to initiate signal transduction cascade are the myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), the TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN- (TRIF), the MyD88-adaptor-like (MAL, known also as TIRAP) and the TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM; known also as TICAM2). myD88 recruits and activates the serine-threonine protein kinases IRAK (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase), which then recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 (TNF receptor associated factor 6) TAK1 activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) leading to activation. NF-B is a nuclear factor that is sequestered into the cytoplasm by the inhibitory factor IB. in return, IKK phosphorylates the inhibitory factor IB driving its proteasomal degradation. in return, IKK phosphorylates the inhibitory factor IB driving its proteasomal degradation and inducing the release of NF-B. ducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) interact with the adaptor mitochondrial antiviral-signaling (MAVS) protein localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane. MAVS then activates the IKK-related kinases, TBK1/IKKi, leading to activation of IRF3/IRF7 and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. ISGF3 binds to a conserved sequence named IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) after its translocation into the nucleus, ISGF3 binds to a conserved sequence named ISRE and activates the transcription of ISGs. IFN-I can also induce a set of genes expression independent on STATs. d dendritic cells (pDCs), a subset of DCs specialized in IFN-I secretion, and macrophages. genomic viral RNAs are delivered onto endosomal TLR7/8 and lead to the secretion of IFN- and inflammatory cytokines. Activation of TLR7/8 does not require HIV replication showing that it is an incoming viral genome which is detected. LR10 can sense HIV-1 proteins leading to induction of IL-8 and NF-B. but sensing of HIV-1 does not lead to antiviral functions. but rather enhances HIV infection. cGAS-synthesized cGAMP activates TBK1 and downstream IRF3 and IRF7, driving the production of IFN-I. cGAS is an important sensor of retroviral DNA allowing cytokines production in response to HIV, murine leukemia virus (MLV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) [40] the viral capsid which remains associated with viral dsDNA up to the nucleus interior of infected cells modulates the recognition of dsDNA by cGAS. cellular protein NONO binds more efficiently to HIV-2 capsid compared to HIV-1 capsid, contributing to better recognition of viral dsDNA and activation of immune responses. in monocytes, IL-1 production requires both the activation of TLR8 and NLRP3. TLRs recognize extracellular pathogens and nucleic acids derived from viruses. adaptors used by human TLRs to initiate signal transduction cascade. TLR4 can recruit MyD88 or TRIF and is able to induce IFN-I. signal transduction cascades leading to the production of type I interferon (IFN-I) and pro-inflammatory cytokines after toll-like-receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors activation are described. myD88 recruits and activates the serine-threonine protein kinases IRAK (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase) which then recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 (TNF receptor associated factor 6) TAK1 then acts in two signaling pathways. NF-B is a nuclear factor that is sequestered into the cytoplasm by the inhibitory factor IB. the most important IRFs involved in TLR signaling are IRF3 and IRF7. the adaptor protein TRIF, TRIF binds and activates the kinases IKK and TBK1 (tank-binding kinase 1) which in turn phosphorylate IRF3 to induce the production of IFN-I. IFN-I are secreted and induce paracrine or autocrine signaling by binding to the membrane IFN-/ receptor (IFNAR) composed of two subunits: IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. IFNAR activates the Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and the non-receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) which mediate the phosphorylation and the dimerization of the transcription factors STAT1 pressed TLR2 and TLR4 are involved in the sensing of HIV-1 glycoprotein gp120, in particular in mucosal epithelial cells. they can sense extracellular HIV viruses through gp120 binding to TLR2 or TLR4 and secrete proinflammatory cytokines. endosomal TLR7/8 play an important role in HIV sensing in particular in phagocytic immune cells. some studies describe HIV-1 as a poor inducer of the IFN responses [28] suggesting that HIV-1 is able to escape from TLR signaling. despite the ability of TLRs to sense HIV PAMPs, innate immune response in the early events of HIV-1 infection is limited. retroviral replication produces nucleic acid intermediates during reverse transcription. presence of dsDNA in the cytoplasm is a danger signal. cGAS produces cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) in response to binding to dsDNA. containing protein 1) has been abolished by a pre-treatment with the SIV protein Vpx. DCs are naturally infected and activated by HIV-2 because the HIV-2 protein Vpx leads to SAMHD1 degradation. thus, the permissiveness of DCs toward HIV-2 versus HIV-1 allows a better recognition of HIV-2 PAMPs produced during infection. the inflammasome is a multicomponent protein complex composed of a sensor (NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family), an adaptor called ASC or PYCARD, and the caspase 1. IL-1 initiates inflammatory cascades leading to cytokines production and recruitment of immune cells. endosomal TLR7/8 recognizing guanosine- and uridine-rich single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) play an important role in HIV sensing in particular in phagocytic immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), a subset of DCs specialized in IFN-I secretion, and macrophages. incoming HIV particles are engulfed into immunoamphisomes where TLRs can be activated but HIV-1 prevents the formation of these immunoamphisomes. gp41 is recognized as a TLR10 ligand leading to the induction of IL-8 and NF-B. however, sensing of HIV-1 does not lead to antiviral functions but rather enhances HIV infection [31] cGAS produces cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) in response to binding to dsDNA. cGAMP functions as a secondary messenger, activates TBK1 and downstream IRF3 and IRF7. cGAS-synthesized cGAMP can be transferred from producing cells to neighboring cells through gap junctions where it promotes STING activation and antiviral immunity. viral capsid is permissive to cGAS-mediated sensing during early steps of infection. the HIV-1 capsid evades sensing of the dsDNA before integration even if Vpx is provided. cellular protein NONO binds more efficiently to HIV-2 capsid compared to HIV-1 capsid. caspase 1 cleaves pro-IL-1 and pro-IL-18 into active proinflammatory IL-1 and IL-18 cytokines. then IL-1 initiates inflammatory cascades leading to cytokines production. in monocytes, IL-1 production requires both the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. IFITM interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITMs) proteins are a family of small proteins that are involved in immunity and in the restriction of many viral infections. the human IFITM family comprises of five members, including immune-related IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3. IFITMs restrict a great number of enveloped RNA viruses including influenza A virus [51], flaviviruses (Dengue virus, West Nile virus [51,52] and Zika virus [53], hepatitis C virus (54), filoviruses (Marburg and Ebola viruses) [55,56], viruses from the bunyavirales order (Rift Valley fever virus [57], Hantaan virus [58]), coronaviruses ( the first antiviral action of IFITMs is to protect target cells from incoming viruses. a second antiviral mechanism of IFITMs (particularly IFITM2 and 3) leads to the production of virions that package IFITMs. virions are incorporated into nascent HIV particles leading to a decrease in the virions infectivity. s, IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3 genes each have an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) in its promoter region. IFITMs are upregulated by innate immunity which enhances antiviral functions. TRIM proteins share a conserved N-terminal RBCC structure. hTRIM5 proteins from Old World monkeys restrict a broad range of retroviruses. the human orthologue (hTRIM5) strongly inhibits N-MLV and EIAV. but internalization via DC-SIGN (Dendritic Cell-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule-3-Grabbing Non-integrin) does not. TRIM5 is constitutively expressed, but its expression is upregulated by IFN-I. treatment of HeLa and HepG2 cells with IFN-I increases TRIM5 promoter activity and mRNA levels. TRIM5 has no homologue in a mouse model. APOBEC3G APOBEC3G (A3G) proteins or apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic subunit-like 3G belong to the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminase enzymes. a3G was the first restriction factor identified for HIV-1. antiviral activity of APOBEC3 proteins is not restricted to HIV-1. antiviral activity of APOBEC3 proteins is not restricted to HIV-1. IFN- was the first cytokine identified as strong inducer of A3G expression. the silencing of A3G by siRNA partially prevented the inhibition of HIV. in macrophages, IFN- can also increase A3G expression but to a lesser extent than IFN-. primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (MVECS) is the major component of the blood\u2013brain barrier. as an ISG, A3G expression is induced by PRRs after the detection of PAMPs. treatment of immature DCs or monocyte-derived macrophages leads to A3G induction and antiviral activity against HIV. the low efficiency of SAMHD1 restriction in dividing cells can be explained by the regulation of SAMHD1 activity at the post-transcriptional level. cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK), CDK1, CDK2 and CDK6 are only active in dividing cells. the antiviral activity of SAMHD1 is not restricted to HIV-1. other retroviruses including bovine, feline and simian immunodeficiency viruses are targets of SAMHD1. Mx2 is a protein belonging to the dynamin superfamily of large guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases). both IFN- and IFN- induce Mx2 expression in human fibroblasts with an accumulation of Mx2 proteins in the cytoplasm. some studies also suggest that Mx2 could impair HIV uncoating by binding to the capsid. interaction between Mx2 and the viral capsid is either direct [185] or mediated via the interaction with CypA [186]. tetherin/BST-2 (bone marrow stromal antigen 2) is a restriction factor that impairs HIV-1 particles budding. it is known that in human cells proteins-based tethers retain the fully formed virions on infected cell surfaces, preventing the release of HIV-1 particles. two-isoforms of BST-2 co-exist in cells: a long isoform and a shorter isoform lacking the first 12\u201317 amino acids. both isoforms can form homo- and heterodimers and have antiviral activity. the shorter isoform is more resistant to Vpu counteraction. studies show that BST-2 is a gene induced by innate immunity after the sensing of infection by TLRs. this is confirmed by in vivo studies showing that HIV infection upregulates BST-2 expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. IRFs (in particular IRF-1, IRF-3 and IRF-7) are the IFN-induced gene products required for activation of the promoter following IFN signaling. the upregulation of BST-2 expression in virus-infected cells in response to virus-induced IRF-7 activation would ensure that host cells maintain BST-2-mediated virus restriction. the antiviral function of CH25H has also been described for HCV and the Zika virus infection [213,214] the mechanism by which CH25H inhibits viral entry was recently described in more detail [215]. ZAP selectively recruits cellular poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) which removes the poly(A) tail of target viral mRNA and recruits the RNA exosome to degrade the RNA body from the 3\u2032 end. a third antiviral mechanism of ZAP is inhibition of translation. ubiquitin E3 ligase TRIM25 is required for the antiviral activity of ZAP. the longer ZAP isoforms better inhibit alphaviruses and HBV. all isoforms equally inhibit Ebola virus. HIV could limit ZAP antiviral functions by using matrin 3. the role of SLFN11 in counteracting retroviruses is leant by the fact that equine SLFN11 restricts EIAV via a mechanism targeting translation. the function of SLFN11 is conserved among primates since chimpanzee, orangutan, gibbon and marmoset encode a SLFN11 protein with a higher activity compared to human SLFN11 [236]. HERC5-mediated ISGylation inhibits Gag and Tsg101 ubiquitination disrupting the interaction between these two proteins. a study on HIV-positive patients has shown that ISG15 is one of the highest ISG expressed [245]. this antiviral activity does not involve the GTPase function of GBP5. it requires the C-terminal isoprenylation domain of GBP5, mediating the anchoring to Golgi membranes, where env processing occurs. vpu and env are expressed from the same bicistronic RNA. a very recent study by Smith and colleagues has enlarged the number of viruses affected by IFITMs [61]. IFITMs block viral entry by impairing the hemifusion process most likely by reducing membrane fluidity. a second antiviral mechanism of IFITMs (particularly IFITM2 and 3) leads to the production of virions that package IFITMs and display reduced entry into target cells [66,69]. During viral assembly into infected cells, IFITMs are incorporated into nascent HIV particles leading to a decrease in the virions infectivity. IFITM3 promoter has binding sites for several transcription factors activated by innate immunity. despite their name, IFITM5 and IFITM10 are not induced by IFNs. TRIM proteins share a conserved N-terminal RBCC structure. TRIM5 proteins from Old World monkeys restrict a broad range of retroviruses. the human orthologue (hTRIM5) strongly inhibits N-MLV and EIAV. but this antiviral function depends on route of HIV-1 internalization. hTRIM5 is crucial for the antiviral activity of TRIM5. TRIM5 is constitutively expressed, but several studies have shown that its expression is upregulated by IFN-I. treatment of HeLa and HepG2 cells with IFN-I increases TRIM5 promoter activity and mRNA levels. APOBEC3G APOBEC3G belongs to the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminase enzymes. apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic subunit-like 3G belongs to the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminase enzymes. the degradation of deaminated viral DNA by the uracil base excision repair pathway could take part in the antiviral activity of A3G. the exact contribution of this pathway in HIV restriction is controversial. the exact contribution of this pathway in HIV restriction is controversial. regulation of A3G expression by IFN- is cell-type dependent. in liver and macrophages, IFN- can also increase A3G expression but to a lesser extent than IFN-. the stimulation of human moDCs with Gag virus-like particles leads to the production of IFN-, along with an increase in mRNA and protein expression of A3G. the stimulation of innate immunity and restriction factor A3G by Gag-VLPs drag an antiviral state that inhibits a later HIV-1 infection. the low efficiency of SAMHD1 restriction in dividing cells can be explained by the regulation of SAMHD1 activity at the post-transcriptional level. cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK), CDK1, CDK2 and CDK6 are only active in dividing cells. the mechanism of SAMHD1 regulation by CDK is not fully understood. the antiviral activity of SAMHD1 is not restricted to HIV-1. other retroviruses including bovine, feline and simian immunodeficiency viruses are targets of SAMHD1. innate immune response mediators could induce SAMHD1 to promote its antiviral activity. both IFN- and IFN- induce Mx2 expression in human fibroblasts with an accumulation of Mx2 proteins in the cytoplasm. interaction between Mx2 and the viral capsid is either direct [185] or mediated via the interaction with CypA [186]. the GTPase activity of Mx2 is required for oligomer assembly [189] even if this activity has been dispensable for its restriction activity. gen 2) is a restriction factor that impairs HIV-1 particles budding. in human cells proteins-based tethers retain the fully formed virions on infected cell surfaces, preventing release of HIV-1 particles. gen 2 is a transmembrane protein with both a N-terminal transmembrane domain and a GPI anchor. two-isoforms of BST-2 co-exist in cells: a long isoform and a shorter isoform lacking the first 12\u201317 amino acids. both isoforms can form homo- and heterodimers and have antiviral activity. the shorter isoform is more resistant to Vpu counteraction. BST-2 is a gene induced by innate immunity after the sensing of infection by TLRs. this is confirmed by in vivo studies showing that HIV infection upregulates BST-2 expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. IRFs are induced following TLR activation by viral infections. the upregulation of BST-2 expression in virus-infected cells would ensure that host cells maintain BST-2-mediated virus restriction. this could be an integral part of innate immune responses. the antiviral function of CH25H has also been described for HCV and the Zika virus infection [213,214]. the mechanism by which CH25H inhibits viral entry was recently described in more detail [215]. ZAP selectively recruits cellular poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) which removes the poly(A) tail of target viral mRNA and recruits the RNA exosome to degrade the RNA body from the 3\u2032 end. a third antiviral mechanism of ZAP is inhibition of translation. HIV could limit ZAP antiviral functions by using matrin 3. SLFN11 impairs HIV translation by preventing change in the tRNA pool induced by HIV infection. the role of SLFN11 in counteracting retroviruses is leant by the fact that equine SLFN11 restricts EIAV via a mechanism targeting translation similar to the one used by human SLFN11 [235]. chimpanzee, orangutan, gibbon and marmoset encode a SLFN11 protein with a higher activity compared to human SLFN11 [236]. ISGylation inhibits Gag and Tsg101 ubiquitination disrupting the interaction between these two proteins. a study on HIV-positive patients has shown that ISG15 is one of the highest ISG expressed [245]. a defect in env glycosylation impairs the processing of gp160 precursor. vpu and env are expressed from the same bicistronic RNA. mutations in the vpu gene disrupting vpu reading frame increase env expression. IFN- also induced Ch25h expression showing that this enzyme is regulated by several types of IFN. the antiviral function of CH25H has also been described for HCV and the Zika virus infection. ZAP is able to directly bind to mRNAs through its CCCH zinc finger motifs [222] and recruits the decapping complex Dcp1a/Dcp2 to initiate degradation of the target viral mRNA from the 5\u2019 end [225]. a third antiviral mechanism of ZAP is inhibition of translation. splice variants of human ZAP, ZAP-XL (extra-long) and ZAP-M (medium) have been identified. the longer ZAP isoforms better inhibit alphaviruses and HBV. all isoforms equally inhibit Ebola virus. translation shut-off is a general antiviral mechanism that is mediated by other ISGs such as the protein kinase R that phosphorylates the eIF2 factor. however, both cellular and viral translation are impaired. equine SLFN11 restricts EIAV via a mechanism targeting translation similar to the one used by human SLFN11 [235] ISGylation inhibits Gag and Tsg101 ubiquitination disrupting the interaction between these two proteins. a study on HIV-positive patients has shown that ISG15 is one of the highest ISG expressed [245]. GBP5 is expressed in macrophages and CD4+ T cells in which it plays an antiviral function by impairing the incorporation of HIV-gp120 in newly produced virions decreasing viral progeny infectivity. this antiviral activity does not involve the GTPase function of GBP5 but requires the C-terminal isoprenylation domain of GBP5, mediating the anchoring to Golgi membranes. this study suggests that IFITM genes could be involved in the regulation of inflammation. in the case of viral infections such as HIV, it would be interesting to study if IFITMs promote innate immunity. endogenous TRIM5 accumulates in nuclear bodies in a SUMOylation-dependent manner. this leads to potent induction of IFN-I mediated by the sensing of viral reverse-transcribed DNA by cGAS. rhesus TRIM5 has been described to promote adaptive immunity by enhancing the recognition and killing of HIV-1-infected cells by CD8 T cells. infected cells are recognized and killed by NK cells. editing activity of A3G favors generation of HIV-1 antigenic peptides by infected cells enhancing activation of HIV-1-specific CTL responses. editing activity of A3G is reduced in vivo mainly due to Vif counteraction. two isoforms of BST-2 co-exist in cells. the longer isoform, but not the shorter, is an activator of the NF-B pathway. signaling requires the cytoplasmic tail of the longer isoform. mutations in Vpu or upregulation of BST-2 by IFN- or IL-27 lead to an increase of HIV-env expression at the surface of infected cells favoring ADCC. this action of BST-2 is indirect and relies on Vpu. this action of BST-2 is indirect and relies on Vpu. siRNA against ZAP impairs induction of IFN- and IFN- after viral infection. deficiency of ZAP in mouse embryonic fibroblasts does not affect IFN-I production in response to Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and IAV. phalopathic autoimmune disease characterized by overexpression of IFN-I and IFN-associated genes. in these patients, homozygous mutation of SAMHD1 gene leads to accumulation of intracellular dNTPs that are sensed by PRRs, triggering IFN-I production [280,281]. this highlights that SAMHD1 acts as a negative regulator of innate immunity. HIV-1 may evade innate sensing through SAMHD1 [41]. however, DCs can internalize HIV-1 in immunoamphisomes where TLRs can be activated. in this context, SAMHD1 negative regulation of innate immunity could be used as a mechanism to bypass host innate immunity. recent studies have shown that BST-2 can also directly inhibit IFN-I signaling by targeting the mitochondrial protein MAVS for autophagic degradation. this type of ubiquitination is a signal for selective degradation by autophagy since the autophagic receptor NDP52 binds to ubiquitinated MAVS proteins and targets them into autophagosomes. 25-HC increases the frequency of IFN- secreting cells activated in response to the SIV vaccine. but selectively decreases the frequency of CD4+ T cells secreting IL-2, TNF- and dual IL- 2/TNF- cytokines. this suggests a negative regulation of the proinflammatory responses mediated by Th1 cells. interaction with the viral capsid lattice greatly enhances the E3 activity of TRIM5 and induces the transcription of AP-1 and NF-B-dependent factors. the synthesis of free K63-linked ubiquitin chains that is necessary for activation of both NF-B and AP-1 is dependent on a conserved sumoylation consensus site present between the RING motif and the N-terminal extremity of TRIM5. rhesus TRIM5 has been described to promote adaptive immunity by enhancing the recognition and killing of HIV-1-infected cells by CD8 T cells. cytidine deamination of HIV viral DNA by A3G enhances the recognition of HIV-infected cells by natural killer cells (NK) editing activity of A3G favors the generation of HIV-1 antigenic peptides by infected cells enhancing activation of HIV-1-specific CTL responses. a study made in a cohort of HIV-infected individuals showed that A3G-mediated mutations are more abundant in sequences encoding immunodominant CD8+ T cells epitopes and make these epitopes less immunogenic. in line with this hypothesis, BST-2-mediated endocytosis of virions could be another mechanism to detect the presence of viruses. in line with this hypothesis, BST-2-mediated endocytosis of Friend retrovirus in mice, activates DCs and leads to stronger NK cells and CD8+ T cell responses. the action of BST-2 is indirect and relies on Vpu. the occupation of Vpu by BST-2 competes with the ability of Vpu to downregulate NTB-A and PVR leading to recognition of infected cells by NK cells. GBP5 and GBP2 activate the AIM2 inflammasome in response to bacterial infection. inflammasome activation has been observed in HIV infected cells in particular NLRP3 activation. in this context, it would be interesting to analyze if GBP5 may contribute to its activation. interaction with the viral capsid lattice greatly enhances the E3 activity of TRIM5 and induces the transcription of AP-1 and NF-B-dependent factors. the synthesis of free K63-linked ubiquitin chains that is necessary for activation of both NF-B and AP-1 is dependent on a conserved sumoylation consensus site present between the RING motif and the N-terminal extremity of TRIM5. rhesus TRIM5 has been described to promote adaptive immunity by enhancing the recognition and killing of HIV-1-infected cells by CD8 T cells. cytidine deamination of HIV viral DNA by A3G enhances the recognition of HIV-infected cells by natural killer cells (NK) the editing activity of A3G favors the generation of HIV-1 antigenic peptides by infected cells enhancing activation of HIV-1-specific CTL responses. a study made in a cohort of HIV-infected individuals showed that A3G-mediated mutations are more abundant in sequences encoding immunodominant CD8+ T cells epitopes and make these epitopes less immunogenic. in line with this hypothesis, BST-2-mediated endocytosis of virions could feed endosomal TLRs with viral PAMPs. thus, BST-2-mediated virus internalization could feed endosomal TLRs with viral PAMPs. in line with this hypothesis, Friend retrovirus (FV) activates DCs and leads to stronger NK cells and CD8+ T cell responses. the action of BST-2 is indirect and relies on Vpu. the occupation of Vpu by BST-2 competes with the ability of Vpu to downregulate NTB-A and PVR leading to recognition of infected cells. GBP5 and GBP2 activate the AIM2 inflammasome in response to bacterial infection. inflammasome activation has been observed in HIV infected cells. inflammasome activation has been observed in NLRP3 infected cells. generation of cGAMP, in response to HIV-1 infection and their sensing by the adaptor protein STING to induce IFN-I, can only occur in primary human DCs or macrophages under permissive conditions. cGAMP inhibits NF-B activation by reducing phosphorylation of the NF-B inhibitory protein IB. innate immunity could be used as a mechanism to bypass host innate immunity. BST-2 has been identified as a ligand for the immunoglobulin-like transcript 7 (ILT7) that regulates the production of IFN-I by these cells. in the context of HIV-1 infection, Vpu suppresses TLR7-mediated IFN-I production by pDCs through a mechanism that relies on the interaction of BST-2 on HIV-producing cells with ILT7 on pDCs. BST-2 plays a dual role in antiviral immune responses by promoting them on one hand, but also by acting as a negative regulator of IFN-I production on the other hand. the role of SAMHD1 as a regulator of the dNTPs pool was identified in patients affected by Aicardi\u2013Gouti\u00e8res syndrome. a homozygous mutation of SAMHD1 gene leads to the accumulation of intracellular dNTPs that are sensed by PRRs, triggering IFN-I production. this highlights that SAMHD1 impairs cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1 in moDCs limiting innate immune responses. innate immunity could be used as a mechanism to bypass host innate immunity. despite many roles in promoting innate and adaptive immunity, BST-2 also has the ability to negatively regulate immune responses. mediated type I IFN signaling by targeting mitochondrial protein MAVS. ubiquitin ligase MARCH8 recruits the ubiquitin ligase MARCH8. MARCH8 catalyzes the K27-linked ubiquitination of MAVS. this type of ubiquitination is a signal for selective degradation by autophagy. IFN- secreting cells activated in response to the SIV vaccine. but selectively decreases the frequency of CD4+ T cells secreting IL-2, TNF- and dual IL- 2/TNF- cytokines. this suggests a negative regulation of the proinflammatory responses mediated by Th1 cells. cytidines to uracils during RT creating hypermutated proviral DNA. generation of antigenic peptides presented on MHC-I allowing recognition of infected cells by CD8 T cells HIV-1 Vif SAMHD1 TLR3, RIG-I and MDA5 activation. some restriction factors, either through their antiviral functions or by additional mechanisms, modulate both innate and adaptive immune responses in positive or negative feedback loops. this review highlights the complex interplay between restriction factors and immunity that should be taken into account."}
