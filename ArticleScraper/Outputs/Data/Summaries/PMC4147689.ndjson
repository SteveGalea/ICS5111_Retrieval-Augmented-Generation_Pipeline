Schreiber\u2019s bats are distributed in distinct lineages throughout Oceania, Africa, Southern Europe, and South-East Asia. they are thought to transmit and maintain LLOV across different lineages throughout their habitats. no studies are available to prove this hypothesis. none of the novel paramyxoviruses are closely related to viruses of the highly pathogenic genus Henipavirus or other human-pathogenic paramyxoviruses [34,35]. there is no evidence to suggest that any of these novel paramyxoviruses are capable of infecting humans. a novel coronavirus (CoV) inducing the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in humans (SARS) has been detected in various bat species around the world via molecular-biological techniques. the pandemic spread from its origin through 33 countries on five continents resulted in more than 8000 infected humans of whom more than 700 eventually died. it took ten years from the emergence of SARS-CoV for the first bat CoV to be isolated from Rhinolophus bats in China, which displayed the human ACE-2 receptor. the case of MERS-CoV is slightly different, as a sequence of 190 base pairs with 100% identity to MERS-CoV was detected in a bat. a prevalence study might provide insights into the distribution of MERS-CoV in bat populations. recently, a quasi-species of MERS CoVs was recovered from nasal swabs of dromedaries of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [64]. the consensus genome variants from dromedaries and humans are indistinguishable, supporting the plausibility of dromedaries in the role of transmission. the occurrence of LLOV should be carefully monitored by prevalence studies in the highly abundant Miniopterus schreibersii. LLOV should be isolated and further characterized to draw conclusions on the evolution of filoviruses. there is no evidence that any of these novel paramyxoviruses are capable of infecting humans. there is no evidence that any of these novel paramyxoviruses are closely related to viruses of the highly pathogenic genus Henipavirus or other human-pathogenic paramyxoviruses. european bat adenovirus Isolate Bat adenovirus 2 (Bat AdV-2) was isolated from a bat\u2019s intestine in 2009 [13], and the whole genome was obtained and circumstantially analyzed [14,78] there is a reasonable chance that this TOSV isolation may have been a cross-contamination. a group in Italy detected further 19 orthoreoviruses in myotis kuhlii, Rhinolophus hyposideros, Tadarida teniotis, and Vespertilio murinus. a close relationship was revealed to the genus Mammalian Orthoreovirus (MRV), in particular to an orthoreovirus obtained from a dog with hemorrhagic enteritis in Italy [36,37,81 european bat lyssaviruses (EBLV-1 and EBLV-2) are synanthropic, hence sharing their habitats with humans. EBLV-1 has been predominantly detected in Eptesicus serotinus and E. isabellinus in Europe. male bats are reported to co-roost with multiple bat species. two human cases were confirmed as infected with EBLV-2. none of the co-roosting bats have been reported to carry EBLV-2. lyssaviruses prevalent in european bats pose a risk to public health. only few of the european bat species are known to be reservoirs of EBLV-1 and EBLV-2. only education can channel public fear to avoid further threats to the bats and the general public. three novel orthoreoviruses were isolated from Plecotus auritus and Myotis mystacinus in 2012. a group in Italy detected further 19 orthoreoviruses in myotis kuhlii, Rhinolophus hyposideros, Tadarida teniotis, and Nyctalus noctula. a close relationship was revealed to the genus Mammalian Orthoreovirus (MRV the causative agent was determined to be an MRV with the highest similarity of 98.4%\u201399.0% in the respective segments to a bat MRV. this might indicate a human-pathogenic potential of strain T3/Bat/Germany/342/08. the isolated viruses will allow for a seroprevalence study (cross-reactivity and cross-neutralization with other strains) in humans. EBLV-1 has been predominantly detected in Eptesicus serotinus and E. isabellinus in Europe. male bats are reported to co-roost with multiple bat species. male bats are reported to co-roost with multiple bat species. lyssavirus prevalence in european bats is very difficult to determine. but changes of behavior as a result of a lyssavirus infection may be more likely to bring bats into contact with humans. the risk is relatively low and would probably fall to zero if people were educated appropriately. lyssaviruses have been the only proven zoonotic viruses in european bats. lyssaviruses have been the only proven zoonotic viruses in bats. only few bat species are known to transmit lyssaviruses in Europe. lyssaviruses are prevalent in European bats, and some viruses might have a zoonotic potential. lyssaviruses are prevalent in European bats, and some may have a zoonotic potential."}
