{"summary": "adherent human and simian cell lines cells were cultivated in a humidified atmosphere at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. all cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. pcDNA3.1zeo was synthesized and inserted into pcDNA3.1zeo. plasmids for the GPs of EBOV strain Mayinga from 1976 (EBOV-GP 1976), Lassa fever virus, influenza A virus (strain A/WSN/33) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) have been described elsewhere. monoclonal antibodies KZ52 and 3B11 directed against EBOV-GP were obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program. VLPs were produced by expression of HIV-1 Gag in combination with the GP of interest in 293T cells. the presence of Gag and GP in VLP preparations was analyzed by Western blot. target cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 3 104 cells/well. target cells were preincubated with inhibitor for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C. the culture medium was replaced by fresh culture medium without inhibitor after 8 hours. transduction efficiency was quantified by a luciferase assay. all cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. nucleotide sequence encoding the GP of the currently circulating EBOV strain Mayinga was synthesized. monoclonal antibody 183-H12-5C recognizing HIV-1 Gag was obtained from the NIH AIDS Reagent Program. the generation of retroviral vectors pseudotyped with heterologous viral GPs (pseudotypes) was carried out as described before. cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 3 104 cells/well. cells were then incubated for 8 hours with 50 L of medium containing pseudoparticles bearing the GP of interest. luciferase activity was determined by quantification of luciferase activity in cell lysates at 30 hours (rhabdoviral pseudotypes) or 72 hours after transduction (retroviral pseudotypes) transduction efficiency was quantified by a luciferase assay. antibody-Mediated Neutralization Pseudotypes carried the GPs of the respective EBOV isolate or VSV-G as a control were normalized for comparable infectivity. the cells were incubated for 72 hours, and luciferase activities in cell lysates were determined. transduction of macrophages obtained upon PMA treatment of THP-1 cells was comparable. both GPs were unable to facilitate transduction of a human B-cell line (Raji), a human T-cell line (Jurkat and a human T/B hybrid cell line (CEMx174; Figure 1B) transduction of the LLC-MK2 and sMAGI cell lines was comparable to EBOV-GP 2014 at transducing COS7 cells. EBOV-GP 1976 and EBOV-GP 2014 used TIM-1 and Axl for entry into certain target cells. however, no appreciable differences were observed. expression of NPC-1 was universally required for entry. entry driven by both GPs was comparably inhibited by U18666A. this induces an NPC-1 knockout phenotype in cells [39] and related compounds. EBOV-GP 1976 and EBOV-GP 2014 both depend on catB activity for efficient transduction of 293T cells. enzymatic activity of the endosomal/lysosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and cathepsin L is required for cellular entry of pseudotypes bearing EBOV-GP 1976 and authentic EBOV 1976 [14]. luciferase activities were determined 72 hours after transduction. transduction in the absence of inhibitor was set as 100%. the average of 3 independent experiments is shown. Pseudoparticles bearing glycoprotein (GP) from EBOV strain mayinga from 1976 (EBOV-GP 1976) and EBOV variant Makona from 2014 (EBOV-GP 2014) exhibit comparable stability. the virus circulating in 2014 is likely to be fully susceptible to blockade by IFITM proteins. 293T cells engineered to express IFITM proteins 1, 2, or 3 or no IFITM protein (control) were transduced with pseudoparticles bearing the indicated GPs. transduction efficiency in cells expressing no IFITM protein was set as 100%. transduction in the absence of antibody was set as 100%. the results of a single experiment performed with triplicate samples are representative of 3 independent experiments. a single experiment performed with triplicate samples is shown. both GPs were unable to facilitate transduction of a human B-cell line (Raji), a human T-cell line (Jurkat and a human T/B hybrid cell line (CEMx174; Figure 1B) the indicated cell lines of human (A and B), monkey (C), and bat (D) origin were transduced with equal volumes of pseudotypes carrying the indicated GPs or no GP (pcDNA) EBOV variants circulating in 1976 and 2014 exhibit a comparable cell tropism. the lectins DC-SIGN, DC-SIGNR, ASGPR1 and LSECtin are known to augment GP-driven entry [12, 13, 37] and promoted transduction driven by EBOV-GP 1974 and EBOV-GP 2014 to similar extents. 293T cells transfected to express the indicated lectins or transfected with empty plasmid (pcDNA3) were transduced with infectivity-normalized pseudotypes bearing the indicated viral GPs. luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured 72 hours after transduction. thepsin B (catB) and cathepsin L (catL) are required for cellular entry of pseudotypes bearing EBOV-GP 1976 and authentic EBOV 1976 [14]. we used a panel of inhibitors previously employed to study EBOV-GP protease use [40] to determine whether EBOV-GP 1976 and EBOV-GP 2014 exhibit differences in their protease requirements. transduction in the absence of inhibitor was set as 100%. the average of 3 independent experiments is shown. Error bars indicate standard error of the mean (SEM) udotypes normalized for comparable infectivity were incubated at the indicated temperatures for different periods, frozen at 80\u00b0C, and used for transduction of 293T target cells. the results are representative of 3 independent experiments performed with triplicate samples. Error bars indicate standard deviations. 293T cells engineered to express IFITM proteins 1, 2, or 3 or no IFITM protein (control) were transduced with pseudoparticles bearing the indicated GPs. transduction efficiency in cells expressing no IFITM protein was set as 100%. EBOV-GP 1976 and EBOV-GP 2014 contain a unique amino acid substitution in the RBD [5, 8], which may alter the requirement for host cell receptors. entry driven by both EBOV-GP 1976 and EBOV-GP 2014 was dependent on expression of the cholesterol transporter NPC-1 and was inhibited by compounds that induce accumulation of endosomal cholesterol. a single experiment performed with triplicate samples is shown and are representative of 3 independent experiments. the only consistent difference observed was a reduction of EBOV-GP 2014\u2013mediated transduction of COS7 cells, relative to that mediated by EBOV-GP 1976. this effect might point toward subtle differences in entry factor use. the removal of the MLD by endosomal cysteine proteases, catB and L, is required for subsequent binding of GP to NPC-1 [14, 19] a comparable time- and temperature-dependent loss of infectivity of retroviral particles bearing these GPs was observed. however, it cannot be disregarded that GP stability might differ in the context of retroviral and filoviral particles. the present study suggests that EBOV variants from 1976 and 2014 are susceptible to both defense mechanisms."}
