{"summary": "some strains of LCMV exploit high affinity interactions with -dystroglycan (-DG) to bind to cell surfaces and fuse in low pH endosomes. LCMV strains with low affinity to -DG utilize an unknown receptor and display unique tissue tropisms. LCMV glycoprotein precursor (GP-C) is post-translationally cleaved to yield GP1 and GP2. GP1 is believed to be responsible for receptor binding followed by a pH-dependent fusion step mediated by a pH-dependent fusion step. LCMV is the prototypic old world arenavirus, with different strains displaying either high or low affinity for -DG. expression rises during embryonic stages, peaks in the newborn, and diminishes in adult tissues. -DG is a ubiquitously expressed, evolutionarily conserved cell surface receptor. LCMV arm53b and clone13 are nearly genetically identical with the exception of two amino acid changes. LCMV WE54 and WE2.2 are also genetically similar with only one amino acid difference at position 153 of GP1. LCMV isolates can transduce -DG-/- mouse ES cells with reduced efficacy. LCMV glycoproteins yield MLV and HIV vector titers similar to the widely used amphotropic and VSV-G envelopes. LCMV envelopes efficiently pseudotype a non-primate FIV lentiviral vector and maintain the entry properties seen in wild-type arenaviruses. pooled livers (200 mg tissue per sample) were homogenized in Tris buffered saline, pH 7.5 + 0.1% TX-100. the protein was quantified by DC assay (BioRad) mutagenesis was used to generate a leucine to phenylalanine mutation at residue 260 of LCMV GP1. the mutation was confirmed by sequencing. the second-generation FIV vector used in this study was reported previously. pretreatments were applied 1 hour prior to vector transduction at 4\u00b0C. the media were changed and FIV vectors pseudotyped with LCMV WE54, VSV-G, or MuLV amphotropic envelopes were applied at an MOI of 10. mAb 83.6 anti-GP2 [5], purified IgG, 20 g/ml in 1% BSA/PBS. primary antibody was incubated for 2 hours at 6\u00b0C followed by 3 washes of PBST. steptavidin coupled to peroxidase (1:500) was added for 1 hour at 25\u00b0C. cells were washed twice with medium and placed back at 37\u00b0C/5% CO2. 24 hours later, cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde/0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes at 37\u00b0C. cells were permeablized with PBS/1% (v/v) FCS/0.1% (w/v) saponin for 15 minutes at 25\u00b0C. the approximate transducing units delivered were 5.0 106 for FIV-WE54-ntLacZ, 4.0 106 for FIV-L260F-ntLacZ, and 2.0 107 for FIV-GP64-ntLacZ. the vectors administered in vivo are presented in Table 1. mice were placed in the Xenogen IVIS-200 imaging cabinet and imaged using a Xenogen IVIS charge-coupled device (CCD) camera while anesthetized. animals were euthanized and the heart, lung, liver, spleen, and kidneys harvested following vascular perfusion with PBS. three images per slide were quantified and results averaged from at least 3 slides per tissue. glycoprotein enrichment and immunoblotting Cell surface glycoproteins were isolated for quantification of dystroglycan expression as previously described. western blots were developed with peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies. LCMV envelope mutagenesis Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis was used to create a point mutation in the LCMV WE54 glycoprotein plasmid. the mutation was confirmed by sequencing. seudotyped viruses expressing -gal were visually titered on HT1080 cells. titered by quantitative PCR following limiting dilutions of 250-fold centrifuge concentrated supernatants. vectors were resuspended in 4% (w/v) -lactose buffer. non-specific binding was blocked by adding 200 l/well 1% (w/v) BSA/PBS and incubating for 1 hour at 25\u00b0C. wild-type LCMV isolates WE54 and WE2.2 were produced in BHK21 cells (ATCC, CCL-10), precipitated with PEG, purified on a renografin gradient by ultracentrifugation. inoculum was added to 90% confluent cultures of HEK293H cells. cells were washed twice with medium and placed back at 37\u00b0C/5% CO2. LCMV infection was detected using mAb 113 anti-LCMVNP [30] (1:200) in PBS/1% (v/v) FCS/0.1% (w/v) saponin for 1 hour at 25\u00b0C. in vivo vector administration Adult BALB/c mice received the following doses via tail vein: FIV-L260F, 4 107 TU; FIV-WE54, 8 107 TU; FIV-GP64, 4 107 TU. vector was not delivered hydrodynamically. 107 TU FIV-WE54, 5.0 106 TU FIV-L260F, 1.2 107 TU FIV-L260F, 4.0 106 TU *Presented as total number of transducing units (TU) delivered to each animal via the facial vein. most concentrated preparations were used for each vector. 8 m sections were made using a microm Cryostat I (HM 505E) Slides were fixed for 10 minutes at 25\u00b0C in 0.5% glutaraldehyde/PBS then washed twice in 1 mM MgCl2/PBS for 10 minutes. postfixation occurred in 0.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde, 10% (v/v) formalin/PBS for 10 minutes at 25\u00b0C. the glycosylated form of -DG binds with high affinity to LCMV and laminin. in adult liver, IIH6 reactive -DG was barely detected. -DG levels were also high in late embryonic/neonatal livers. a recombinant LCMV envelope (LCMV WE-HPI) allows for efficient processing and cell surface expression. entry of LCMV pseudotyped FIV depends on fusion in a low pH endosome. previously demonstrated the pH dependence of the LCMV entry process. LCMV pseudotyped FIV requires low pH endosomes for efficient transduction. cells were pretreated with 8 m monensin or 10 mM NH4Cl. efficiencies were measured by -gal assay and normalized to cells that received no pretreatment. LCMV WE54 double mutant containing the S153F and L260F mutations significantly reduces its affinity for -DG. GP1 of LCMV WE54 was mutated at amino acid position 260 to produce a low affinity -DG binding envelope (LCMV L260F) similar to the wild-type envelope of LCMV Arm53b. wild-type WE54 showed strong affinity while WE2.2 displayed little to no affinity (Figure 3B). soluble -DG inhibited transduction by preventing receptor binding. soluble -DG required to produce a 50% reduction in binding (C50) for FIV-WE54 was 20 nM. the lack of transduction in adult murine tissues may be due to the developmental regulation of -DG. -DG expression is reported to be most abundant in fetal and neonatal tissues. 6-8 week old mice were injected with FIV pseudotypes (LCMV L260F, LCMV WE54, or GP64). similar observations were made 3 weeks post injection. at the 3 week time point, the heart, lung, liver, spleen, and kidneys were harvested. luciferase assays revealed that FIV-L260F yielded 10-fold higher expression in the liver compared to FIV-WE54. expression was detected exclusively from liver tissue (black bars) for all pseudoviruses tested and from hearts (gray bars) for the GP64 and L260F pseudoviruses. standard errors are plotted and * denotes statistical significance (P 0.05) compared to FIV-WE54 livers. similar images are displayed for FIV-L260F transduced hearts (C-D) and livers (I-J) and FIV-WE54 transduced hearts (E-F) and livers (K-L) expression from control FIV-GP64 was stable at 107 photons/sec/cm2. at early time points it was not uncommon to detect signal near the site of injection; this signal disappeared at later time points. LCMV pseudotyped FIV transduction persists in vivo. -DG levels were also high in late embryonic/neonatal livers compared to adult animals. this could either reflect a loss in the -DG protein or decrease in glycosylation efficiency with an overall effect of loss of functional -DG on the cell surface. LCMV pseudotyped FIV requires low pH endosomes for efficient transduction. a549 cells were pretreated with 8 m monensin or 10 m monensin. the ionophore prevents endosomal acidification. a single point mutation to LCMV GP1 alters its -DG affinity. we mutated residues previously identified as responsible for -DG binding. LCMV pseudotyped with WE54 S153F yielded low titers. GP1 of LCMV WE54 was mutated at amino acid position 260 to produce a low affinity -DG binding envelope (LCMV L260F) similar to the wild-type envelope of LCMV Arm53b. LCMV pseudotypes and wild type virus were compared for their affinity to immobilized -DG. LCMV WE54 and wild-type LCMV WE54 envelopes differ in their -DG affinity. soluble -DG inhibited transduction by preventing receptor binding. soluble -DG required to produce a 50% reduction in binding (C50) for FIV-WE54 was 20 nM. wild-type LCMV WE54 C50 was 2-3 nM. the lack of transduction in adult murine tissues may be due to the developmental regulation of -DG (the receptor for the WE54 strain of LCMV), a consequence of post-translational modifications of -DG. we next tested LCMV tropism in neonatal mice. 6-8 week old mice were injected with FIV pseudotypes. luciferase assays were performed to assess tissue tropism and expression. transgene expression was highest in the livers of all animals and no expression was detected in the spleen, lungs, or kidneys. LCMV WE54 displayed no heart transduction. n = 5 for FIV-GP64 and FIV-WE54, 8 for FIV-L260F. three weeks post-injection, animals were sacrificed and tissues fixed. transduced livers from all animals displayed uniform staining throughout the tissue. animals were imaged 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 16 weeks post-injection. expression stabilized and remained relatively constant throughout the duration of the 16 week experiment. LCMV pseudotyped FIV transduction persists in vivo. signal intensities were quantified using Living Image 2.50 software. 100 l of FIV-GP64, FIV-WE54, or FIV-L260F were injected. LCMV envelope glycoproteins normally form homotetramers on the virion surface. however, the HIV-1 and SIV lentiviruses have been demonstrated to possess as few as 8-10 trimers per virion. this could reduce -DG binding and decrease recognition by the monoclonal antibody used against GP2. the -DG receptor, which the WE54 envelope binds with high affinity, exhibits higher expression in late embryonic and neonatal stages and declines thereafter. more studies are needed to identify the potential alternative receptor for the -DG low affinity arenaviruses. park et al. demonstrated improved lentiviral transduction of hepatocytes in vivo. the rates of hepatocyte proliferation are higher in newborn than adult animals. a requirement for cell proliferation may also help explain the relatively low efficiency of LCMV pseudotyped vector tropism. a practical advantage of neonatal gene transfer is that an increased delivered vector/body mass can be achieved experimentally. LCMV L260F pseudotyped FIV has a reduced affinity for -DG receptor. authors declare that they have no competing interests. PO1 HL-51670 (P.B.M.), R01 HL-080388 (D.M.)"}
