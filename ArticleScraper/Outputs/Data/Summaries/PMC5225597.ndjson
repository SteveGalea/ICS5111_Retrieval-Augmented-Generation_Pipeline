{"summary": "multiple viruses are detected during a single ARI episode in approximately a quarter of all cases. the clinical relevance of these multiple detections is unclear. RT-PCR testing for 15 viruses was performed in 560 ARI episodes. RT-PCR assays should be restricted to pathogens for which therapy is available or otherwise may have clinical consequences. supplementary material is available to authorized users."}
