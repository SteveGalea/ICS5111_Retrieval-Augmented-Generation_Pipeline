{"summary": "intracranial haemorrhage is an uncommon presentation of ITP. intracranial haemorrhage is triggered by many, mostly viral, infectious agents. most cases of ITP are benign with only minor mucosal bleeding. acute ITP is common in children (10 years) in contrast to the chronic form which is more common in adults. the chronic form is defined as thrombocytopenia of more than 6 months\u2019 duration since initial clinical presentation. in 1992, Wright reported a case of severe thrombocytopenia secondary to asymptomatic CMV infection. in 2004, Zea-Vera and Parra reported a case of ITP exacerbation that was secondary to Zika virus infection. a connection between ITP and infection with coronavirus has not previously been reported in the literature. Coronavirus is not a well-known cause of immune thrombocytopenia. a respiratory viral panel test should be used in the initial assessment."}
