{"summary": "reticulovesicular network is contiguous with endoplasmic reticulum membranes. coV genomes encode two replicase/transcriptase open reading frames. replicase polyproteins are cleaved by virus-encoded proteases within nsp3 (PLP1/2) and nsp5 (3CLpro) the region of nsp4 that interacts with nsp3 and nsp6 remains unknown. nsp4 contains four transmembrane domains and three loop regions. nsp4 is likely required for replication, as demonstrated by the inability to recover a virus with an nsp4 deletion. all coronavirus nsp4 proteins tested to date contain at least one predicted glycosylation site. however, the location and number of the glycosylation sites vary. this suggests a direct link between the capacity of the virus to induce stable DMVs and virus fitness. however, recently, the relationship of DMV size and number to virus fitness has been questioned. GM; N176A/N237A), VUJS11 (K44A/D47A), VUJS17 (E226A/E227A), and baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were grown in modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% HEPES, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 0.1% amphotericin B (complete DMEM) all B and C fragment plasmids containing mutations in nsp4 were sequenced to ensure that PCR amplification did not introduce additional changes in the coding region. all B and C fragment plasmids were sequenced to ensure that PCR amplification did not introduce additional changes in the coding region. cytopathic effect sees in MHV-infected cells is formation of multinucleated giant cells (syncytium formation) the virus produced from electroporated cells (passage 0 [P0] was passed onto uninfected DBT cells to generate a P1 stock virus that was used for all experiments. nsp3 through nsp6 were amplified by PCR to generate four amplicons covering nucleotides 2389 to 13219. the coding sequences of nsp3 through nsp6 were amplified by PCR. DBT cells on glass coverslips were mock infected with WT or nsp4 mutant viruses. at 7 h p.i., medium was aspirated, and cells were fixed in 100% methanol at 20\u00b0C. cells were then rehydrated in PBS for 10 min and blocked in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin. quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using an Applied Biosciences 7500 real-time PCR system. values were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cells were transferred to a 1:1 polyEmbed 812-propylene oxide mixture for 1 h. pure resin specimens were then transferred into capsules containing fresh resin and then placed into an oven overnight to polymerize. ultrathin serial sections from polymerized blocks were obtained using a leica UCT ultracut microtome. nsp4 amplicon electropherograms were performed using MacVector, version 13, to measure the area under the curve for each mutation. the percentage of virus A nucleotides compared to virus B nucleotides was calculated. at least three nucleotide positions per pair of viruses were analyzed. nucleotides 8721 to 9555 of the MHV A59 clone were located in fragment B. substitutions were introduced into the B or C fragment by PCR mutagenesis using the QuickChange method (Stratagene) cDNA fragments were digested using appropriate restriction enzymes. they were then ligated at 16\u00b0C overnight before the DNA was purified, in vitro transcribed, and electroporated into B. cytopathic effect sees in MHV-infected cells is formation of multinucleated giant cells (syncytium formation) the virus produced from electroporated cells (passage 0 [P0]) was passaged onto uninfected DBT cells to generate a P1 stock virus that was used for all experiments. if the in vitro-transcribed genome did not produce virus on the first attempt, virus assembly was attempted at least two additional times. radiolabeling of viral proteins and protein immunoprecipitation. DBT cells were mock infected or infected with WT or nsp4 mutant viruses. p8 washed three times in wash solution for 5 min each before a final wash in PBS for 30 min. cells were then fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for 10 min, scraped off the dishes, and pelleted. fresh glutaraldehyde was added to the fixed cells for 1 h. cells were washed three times in PBS, transferred to 1% osmium tetroxide. cells were stained en bloc in 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 h. dehydration of cells was carried out gradually using a graded series of ethanol. the area of cytoplasm was calculated using ImageJ software (26) the number of DMVs per area of cytoplasm was determined. a Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine statistical significance of DMVs per area among the viruses. sequon of SARS-CoV, and N479S introduced the sequon present in both human CoV (HCoV) OC43 and bovine CoV (BCoV) all other mutations were inserted near highly conserved asparagine, serine, or threonine residues. both strategies have successfully been used to introduce glycosylation sites into proteins (27\u201330) Viruses are identified with the introduced NX(S/T) site shown below the designation. mutations that introduce alternate glycosylation sequons restored proper DMV morphology. GM-K85S- and DGM-V129N/Q130I-infected cells produced increased numbers of aberrant DMVs (88% and 78% respectively) compared to DGM (67%). fewer aberrant DMVs (54% and 53% respectively) than DGM, but more aberrant DMVs than the WT (37%). s indicate aberrant DMVs, CM, convoluted membranes; N, nucleus; M, mitochondrion; E, endosome; VV, virions in vesicles; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. DBT cells were mock infected or infected with viruses indicated in Fig. 3 at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. at indicated times, supernatants were sampled, and titers were determined by plaque assay. mutant nsp4 proteins migrated at 44 kDa in the absence of endo-H. nsp4 protein shifted to 39 kDa regardless of endo-H treatment. mutant nsp4 proteins were not glycosylated at native glycosylation sites. nsp4 mutants have WT-like RNA synthesis. nsp4 mutants were infected with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell for 10 h. qRT-PCR was performed to amplify nsp10 and GAPDH. DBT cells were infected with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 5 PFU/cell for 6.5 h. cells were then fixed in 100% methanol and stained with antibodies specific to nsp4 and nsp8. there is no apparent correlation between aberrant DMV formation and level of replication complex formation or protein expression within these infected cells. nsp4 loop 1 mutants previously reported from our lab were tested. these consist of mutants K44A/D47A (VUJS11), E226A/E227A (VUJS17) and N258T (5, 21) all three mutant viruses exhibited a range of replication defects. nsp4 loop 1 mutants are glycosylated at both native asparagine residues. DBT cells were infected with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 10 PFU/cell for 24 h. cells were starved with DMEM lacking Cys and Met in the presence of ActD for 1 h prior to being radiolabeled with [35S]Cys-Met for 2 h before lysates were harvested. arrowheads indicate normal and aberrant DMVs. black arrowheads indicate normal and aberrant DMVs. white arrowheads indicate aberrant DMVs. 79S competed equally with DGM, and each remained at approximately 50% of the population. loss of nsp4 glycosylation is associated with a substantial decrease in virus fitness that can be further decreased by introduction of additional mutations into nsp4 loop 1. is the glycosylation sequon of SARS-CoV. all other mutations were inserted near highly conserved asparagine, serine, or threonine residues. both strategies have successfully been used to introduce glycosylation sites into proteins (27\u201330) /T) sequons are identified with the introduced NX(S/T) site shown below the designation. mutations that introduce alternate glycosylation sequons restored proper DMV morphology. DGM-K85S- and DGM-V129N/Q130I-infected cells produced increased numbers of aberrant DMVs compared to DGM (67%) cells infected with DGM-N479S and N479S viruses produced fewer aberrant DMVs (54% and 53%, respectively) than DGM but more aberrant DMVs than the WT (37%). arrowheads indicate aberrant DMVs.

DBT cells were mock infected or infected with viruses indicated in Fig. 3 at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. at indicated times, supernatants were sampled, and titers were determined by plaque assay. mutant nsp4 proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (n 2). proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (n 2). proteins were resolved by DGM-VQ/NI, DGM-V129N/Q130I. cells were radiolabeled, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for nsp4. nsp4 NX(S/T) mutants have WT-like RNA synthesis. differences in total DMV numbers demonstrated by EM may reflect overall differences in viral replication. qRT-PCR was performed to amplify nsp10 and GAPDH. DBT cells were infected with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 5 PFU/cell for 6.5 h. cells were then fixed in 100% methanol and stained with antibodies specific to nsp4 and nsp8. there is no apparent correlation between aberrant DMV formation and level of replication complex formation or protein expression within these infected cells. nsp4 loop 1 mutants previously reported from our lab were tested. these consist of mutants K44A/D47A (VUJS11), E226A/E227A (VUJS17) and N258T (5, 21) nsp4 loop 1 mutants were glycosylated at both native asparagine residues. infection with K44A/D47A and E226A/E227A resulted in significantly less DMVs than infection with the WT virus. in addition to mutations that affect glycosylation of nsp4, substitutions at other locations in nsp4 loop 1 result in altered DMV morphology. black arrowheads indicate normal DMVs, white arrowheads indicate aberrant DMVs. white arrowheads indicate aberrant DMVs. the decrease in fitness of DGM-N479S compared to the WT is likely due to the DGM phenotype and that the N479S mutation does not alter virus fitness. these data demonstrate that loss of nsp4 glycosylation is associated with a substantial decrease in virus fitness that can then be further decreased by introduction of additional mutations into DGM nsp4 loop 1. mutations at nsp4 glycosylation sites result in aberrant DMVs (1, 3) mutations in nsp4 loop 1 cause ou exacerbate defects in DMV formation. mutations in nsp4 loop 1 exacerbate changes in membrane structures of the virus. nsp4 C terminus is also involved in DMV formation or stability after formation. crystal structures of the nsp4s for MHV-A59 and feline CoV are structurally conserved. mutations that do not affect viral replication can alter DMV morphology and numbers. mutations across nsp4 that do not alter virus fitness cause aberrant DMVs and decreased numbers. a small-molecule inhibitor was identified that prevents coronavirus DMV formation, likely by targeting nsp6 (31). et al. demonstrated that when coexpressed, nsp3 and nsp4 have the capacity to pair membranes. it is likely that nsp3 and nsp4 interact across the DMV lipid bilayer to hold both membranes in close proximity. nsp3-nsp4 interaction could result in separation of the inner and outer membranes. a study by al-Mulla et al. used temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants in multiple replicase proteins to study the relationship of DMV size and number to virus fitness. the results support the conclusions of al-Mulla et al. by demonstrating that mutations within nsp4 are not associated with a fitness cost compared to WT virus. proper formation of DMVs identifies nsp4 glycosylation as putative target for antiviral therapy."}
