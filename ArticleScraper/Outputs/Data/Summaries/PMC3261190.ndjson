{"summary": "the symptoms and signs generally include fever, sneezing, nasal rattles, and respiratory distress in pigs. pigs recover within a few days, but severe signs can develop. mortality can reach up to 10% when highly virulent strains are involved [1] or pigs are infected at young ages. studies have been conducted to identify proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-, IL-6, IL-12, and IFN- or IFN-. they are upregulated in lung or bronchoalveolar secretions in pigs. a higher frequency of cytotoxic T, T, and Treg cells were also detected. induced proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are also the cause of pathogenicity for the host. roles of macrophages are critical to pathogenicity as well as host protection in pigs or their macrophages. but little is known about how host responses are regulated in pigs or their macrophages. swine macrophages purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) mouse anti-ERK and anti-JNK antibodies as well as rabbit anti-phospho ERK and anti-phospho JNK antibodies (Cell Signaling), anti-cytochrome c, anti-influenza NS1 and alkaline phosphatase (AP)- virus allantoic fluid (VAF) was harvested 48 hrs after inoculation, then titrated with standard haemagglutination tests (HA) and plaque assays in MDCK cells for HA and infectious viral titers. the cells were infected with H1N1pdm inocula in VAF at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. after 1 hr of adsorption, the virus inocula the RT reaction was carried out with the RNA after treatment with DNase I at 42\u00b0C for 2 min. real-time PCR was conducted with 1 l of cDNA in a total volume of 25 l with the iQ SYBR Green Supermix. sL CCCATACCCCCAAATCTTCT CTGGACAGGGGAAGACTGAG TRAIL AAAGCTCTCCTCTCAAG TNF- CCACCACCACCCTCTCTCAAG RIG-1 ACGAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGTT RIG-1 ACGAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGTT RIG-1 ACGAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG a two-tailed Student's t-test was used to evaluate realtime RT-PCR data. the 0.05 level of probability (p0.05) was considered statistically significant. mouse anti-ERK and anti-JNK antibodies as well as rabbit anti-phospho ERK and anti-phospho JNK antibodies. the eight genomic segments of this virus have been fully sequenced. the raw data are deposited at Genbank under accession numbers JQ173100 through JQ173107. the virus was grown in 9-day-old embryonating eggs. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) genes were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. 1 g of total RNA, prepared from the cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), was reverse transcribed with the QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. lysates were prepared by lysing uninfected and infected 3D/4 cells in 1% NP-40 lysis buffer containing 1 M PMSF, 1% aprotinin, 20 g leupeptin ul1 and 1 M sodium vanadate (Sigma) western blot analysis was performed following standard protocols using rabbit or mouse anti-MAP kinase or phosphor-MAP kinase antibodies. TBST containing 5% fat-free milk powder for 90 mins incubation at RT. after thorough washes, incubation with AP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody followed. membrane was also blotted with a monoclonal anti-actin antibody. cytochrome c activated mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptosis as early as 3 hrs post infection. Bak, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, was upregulated as detected in the infected cells. proinflammatory cytokine and TNF family responses in swine macrophages to pH1N1pdm infection. levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 upregulated up to 51-fold at 16 hrs. level of IL-8 continued to rise up to 142-fold at 36 hrs p.i. we observed a robust induction of antiviral IFN-, and INF-inducible Mx and 2\u20325\u2032-OAS. IFN-inducible antiviral proteins Mx and 2\u20325\u2032-OAS were induced accordingly up to 910- and 12,510-fold, respectively, at 36 hrs p.i. 3D/4 cells were infected with H1N1pdm, and cell lysates were prepared at various time points for SDS-PAGE and western blot analyses with specific anti-ERK1/2 and anti-JNK1/2 antibodies. phospho-ERK1/2 and phosphor-JNK1/2 were detected by anti-phospho-ERK1/2 and anti-phospho-JNK1/2 antibodies. ERK1/2 was basally phosphorylated at a low level before infection, but further new tab Swine macrophages were infected with H1N1pdm virus. cell lysates were prepared at various time points after infection. phosphorylation of 3D/4 cells was also measured over the time without infection. the cells were pre-treated with the inhibitors 1 hr prior to infection. the final concentrations for the NFB and IKK inhibitors were 10 nM and 10 M, respectively. the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was not suppressed at all by the inhibitors of ERK1/2 and p38. however, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was not suppressed at all by the inhibitors of ERK1/2 and p38. cytokines by MAP kinases are regulated by individual MAP kinases. we pre-treated the cells with ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 inhibitors. IL-1 was barely detected and not induced during H1N1pdm infection. ERK1/2 may play different roles in the induction of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. it is interesting to note that JNK1/2 may have moderate effects in the induction of IL-6. but may not be relevant at all to the induction of either IL-8 or IL-10. 2\u20325\u2032-OAS and Mx were suppressed significantly by the ERK inhibitor. but only the inhibition of Mx was observed in the presence of the JNK inhibitor. 3D/4 cells were pre-treated with U0126 and InSolution JNK inhibitor, respectively, 1 hr before H1N1pdm infection. cDNA was used for realtime PCR with specific primers to measure fold changes of cytokine transcripts at different time points. each assay was repeated at least twice; mean fold change plus standard deviation of two or three independent assays. cross-talk between MAP kinases and NFB pathways in swine macrophages. cells were pretreated with U0126, SB230058, and InSolution JNK Inhibitor 1 hr before H1N1pdm infection. total RNA was prepared from infected cells for reverse transcription. cDNA was used for realtime PCR with RIG-1 and MDA-5 primers. the induction of RIG-1 was completely abolished by the inhibition of ERK1/2 or JNK1/2 inhibitors, and to a lesser extent, by the p38 inhibitor. the differentially regulated pattern of RIG-1 induction by ERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2 was similar to suppression of NFB phosphorylation/activation by MAP kinases. cytochrome c was released into the cytosol (Fig. 1E) which activated mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptosis as early as 3 hrs post infection. 3D/4 cells were infected with H1N1pdm at an MOI of 1 and incubated at 37\u00b0C. western blot analysis with anti-cleaved caspase antibodies. cleaved caspase 3, 6, 7, and 9 were shown by western blot analyses. cleaved caspase 3, 6, 7, and 9 were shown by western blot analyses. cDNA was used for realtime PCR to measure the amount of gene transcripts. each assay was repeated at least twice. A. Fold changes of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 transcripts. phospho-ERK1/2 and phosphor-JNK1/2 were detected by anti-phospho-ERK1/2 and anti-phospho-JNK1/2 antibodies. ERK1/2 was basally phosphorylated at a low level before infection, but further phosphorylated between 9 and 18 hrs and thereafter p.i. both ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 were activated at basal level even before infection. phosphorylation and activation of p38 MAP kinase in H1N1pdm-infected 3D/4 cells. swine macrophages were infected with H1N1pdm virus and cell lysates were prepared at various time points after infection. phosphorylation of swine ERK1/2 was also measured over the time without infection. the cells were infected with H1N1pdm at an MOI of 1, and the cells were prepared at 18 and 30 hrs post infection. the cells were pre-treated with the inhibitors 1 hr prior to infection. the final concentrations for the NFB and IKK inhibitors were 10 nM and 10 M. phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was abolished at both 18 and 30 hrs p.i. (lines 4\u20135) by the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126. phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was not suppressed at all by the inhibitors of ERK1/2 and p38. MAP kinases and NFB pathways were activated in infected pig macrophages. they could be reversed or inhibited by their specific inhibitors. we used these inhibitors to study the regulation of host responses. the induction of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 was completely suppressed in the presence of the ERK1/2 inhibitor. it is interesting to note that JNK1/2 may play different roles in the induction of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 based on their responses in the presence of the JNK inhibitor. both Mx and 2\u20325\u2032-OAS were suppressed significantly by the ERK inhibitor. but only the inhibition of Mx was observed in the presence of the ERK inhibitor. mRNA levels of FasL and TNF- were barely detectable by realtime RT-PCR in swine macrophages. 3D/4 cells were pretreated with U0126 and InSolution JNK inhibitor. total RNA was prepared at 24 and 36 hrs post infection for reverse transcription. cDNA was used for realtime PCR with specific primers to measure fold changes. cross-talk between MAP kinases and NFB pathways in swine macrophages. cells were pretreated with U0126, SB230058, and InSolution JNK Inhibitor. cDNA was used for realtime PCR with RIG-1 and MDA-5 primers. we examined the induction of RIG-1 and MDA-5 and their relevance to MAP kinases. to do this, we pre-treated the cells with inhibitors of MAP kinases. the induction of RIG-1 was abolished by the inhibition of ERK1/2 or JNK1/2 inhibitors, and to a lesser extent, by the p38 inhibitor. IL-6, IL-8, TNF-, as well as IFN-, were observed in pig macrophages. this pattern differs from that in bronchoalveolar secretions of pigs in which IL-1 was induced but IL-8 was not [19], [20], [21], [22], [25]. it has previously been reported that in human immune cells and patients a weak innate immune response. the induction of IFN-, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 was regulated by ERK1/2. this may be the first time that JNK1/2 inhibitory effects have been demonstrated. previous studies found that IFN induction was dependent on the JNK1/2 signaling pathway in epithelial cells infected with influenza virus infection. ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 were involved in the induction of FasL, TNF-, and TRAIL. both toll-like receptors and RNA helicases are critical to antiviral innate immunity. the induction of RIG-1 and MDA-5 depends on the activation of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 in pig macrophages. this indicates that the induction of RIG-1 or MDA-5 depends on the activation of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2."}
