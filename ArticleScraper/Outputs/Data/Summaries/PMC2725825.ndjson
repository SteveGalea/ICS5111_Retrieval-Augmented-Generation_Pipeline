{"summary": "the greenePmdB comprises the 228,638 viral sequences of the GreeneVrdB that represent complete and partial viral genomes. these sequences represent all recognized 1,710 vertebrate virus species and 135 bacterial, 73 fungal, and 63 parasite genera. most viral protein coding sequences in the NCBI database were represented in the Pfam database. RNAs that encode structural proteins may be present at higher levels than those that encode proteins needed only in catalytic amounts. using probes representing noncontiguous sites along the genome might allow detection of naturally occurring or intentionally created chimeric viruses. the 60-mer oligonucleotide arrays were synthesized on 70-mm 20-mm glass slides. a slide can accept up to 244,000 different 60-mer probes or 8 arrays. a total of 300 host immune response probes were added to arrays as a potential index to pathogenesis. poxvirus Human herpesvirus 1 Iltovirus Human adenovirus E (HAdV-4) Mastadenovirus Human adenovirus C (HAdV-5) Mastadenovirus *University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.

S-type rRNA is expressed primarily in the mosquito vector, but A-type rRNA is expressed primarily in the human host (17). only A-type sequences were recovered from the array. differential diagnosis of hemorrhagic fever poses challenges for clinical medicine and public health. in some instances, >1 agent may be endemic in the region with an outbreak. symptoms may overlap in time and geography. PCR methods have advantages with respect to sensitivity, throughput, and simplicity, but are limited in potential for multiplexing. microarrays have potential to allow highly multiplexed, unbiased surveillance, but their use has been limited because of low sensitivity."}
