NH superfamily of esterases and acetylhydrolases characterized by a domain organization with a central five-stranded parallel -sheet. the ser and his residues, together with Asp form a catalytic triad, arranged in a linear array. flanking the catalytic triad is a hydrophobic specificity pocket (P1) to accommodate\u2014in O-acetylesterases\u2014the methyl group of the target catalytic activity of MHV-DVIM HE toward glycosidically bound 9-O-Ac-Sia is abrogated by substitution of Arg305 by Ala. a strategically positioned Arg (Arg305 in DVIM HE) is of overriding importance for substrate binding. torovirus type I HEs (20), substitution in DVIM HE of Arg305 by Ala abrogates enzymatic activity toward natural substrates. a shift in esterase specificity from 9- to 4-O-acetylated Sias could only have been effectuated by changing the binding topology of the substrate. 4-N-acetyl moiety can be inserted into the P1 pocket while 5-N-acyl remains in pocket P2. the substrate molecule is tilted by 20\u00b0 to allow sufficient space for the remaining sugar residues of the glycan chain. RCoV-NJ HE Arg307 is not essential for sialate-4-O-acetylesterase activity. RCoV-NJ HE Arg307 is not essential for sialate-4-O-acetylesterase activity. pNPA is a catalytically inactive mutant. in segment 23, there is a single type-specific amino acid difference: Ala in type I and Ser in all type II HEs. in segment 12, there is a single type-specific amino acid difference: Ala in type I and Ser in all type II HEs. the other type II-specific differences are in segment 166. two acidic residues and two imidazole rings, and (iii) X-ray absorption data. loss of this metal ion may have caused the disorder of the catalytic domain in the published structure of MHV-S HE (21). an RCoV HE-based chimera with all three type I/II distinctive elements replaced by those of MHV-DVIM displays strict sialate-9-O-acetylesterase activity. the enzyme activity of the recombinant protein (\u201cType I chimera\u201d) was compared with that of the parental proteins (MHV-DVIM and RCoV-NJ HE) on BSM (Left) and HSG (Right) 4-O- and 9-O-Ac-Sias are abundantly expressed in the mouse colon. the observed absorption edge at 9.665 keV is close to the theoretical K-edge absorption energy of 9.6607 keV. the recombinant protein lost all enzymatic activity toward 4-O-Ac-Sias. the recombinant protein even displayed a 12-fold higher sialate-9-O-acetylesterase activity. we systematically placed back the type II elements into the type I chimera either individually or in combination. type I chimera produced a hybrid enzyme that retained most of its sialate-9-O-acetylesterase activity, but that now accepted 4-O-Ac-Sia as a substrate. the combination of the ala78Ser substitution with either the type II segment or the 12 Cys-loop did not have an additive effect on the cleavage of 4-O-Ac-Sias. type II-specific amino acid substitutions all affected the P2 pocket. in reality, the original P2 pocket was lost and a new one created. in reality, the original P2 pocket was lost. the structure of the esterase\u2013ligand complex provides an attractive explanation for the importance of the type II-specific changes in segment 166 and the 23 Ala-to-Ser substitution. it is possible that the initial change occurred in the lectin domain through mutations that allowed chance low-affinity virion binding to 4-O-Ac-Sia. mutant viruses would have been fully dependent on the kinetics of the lectin\u2013ligand binding equilibrium for reversibility of attachment. a single mutation in the esterase domain might have set the stage for the changes in the lectin domain to occur, leading to a shift in ligand specificity. the type II HE receptor switch explained from the stereochemistry of protein\u2013carbohydrate interactions. sias possess a large number of accessible functional groups (carboxylate, 5-N-acyl, the hydroxyls or substitution thereof at ring atom C4 and at glycerol side chain atoms C7, C8, and C9). the shift in esterase substrate from 9- to 4-O-Ac-Sias was accomplished not through radical changes in protein architecture, but by altering ligand binding topology. the adaptations in the type II HE esterase are in fact analogous to those that took place in the corresponding type II lectin domain (21). in either case, the ancestral type I CBS was modified as to reduce the distance between O- and N-Ac docking sites to accommodate for the shorter distance between the sialate-4-O- and -5-N-acyl groups. both 9- and 4-O-Ac-Sias are abundant in the murine gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the colon. there may be differences in expression levels and/or in tissue and cell distribution between 9- and 4-O-Ac-Sias\u2014subtle or less subtle\u2014that so far have gone unnoticed. either intact or rendered catalytically inactive through active-site Ser-to-Ala substitutions (HE0), were expressed as thrombin-cleavable Fc fusion proteins. expression products retained full biological activity as was demonstrated by solid-phase lectin-binding assays and receptor destruction assays with bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) and horse serum glycoproteins. 88.82, 122.16 60.71, 184.37, 76.90 57.09, 184.59, 78.08,, \u00b0 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90 Resolution range, * 44.41\u20132.00 (2.03\u20132.00) 61.2\u20132.2 (2.27\u20132.20) 54.54\u20131.85 (1.89\u20131.85) No. unique reflections 65,139 (287 the lectin domain of RCoV-NJ HE is virtually identical to that of (type II) MHV-S HE (21) (rmsd on main chain C atoms: 0.31;

Arg305 in DVIM HE extends into the catalytic center. its side chain engages in a bidentate hydrogen bond interaction with the Sia-carboxylate (18, 39), thus fixing the Sia pyranose ring in a proper orientation. a shift in esterase specificity from 9- to 4-O-acetylated Sias could only have been effectuated by changing binding topology of the substrate. the 4-N-Ac-Sia-substrate analog in the RCoV-NJ type II enzyme is rotated by 180\u00b0 about the central Sia C2-C5 axis. the substrate molecule is tilted by 20\u00b0 such as to allow sufficient space for the remaining sugar residues of the glycan chain to which the natural substrate, 4-O-Ac-Sia, would be attached. RCoV-NJ HE Arg307 is not essential for sialate-4-O-acetylesterase activity. RCoV-NJ HE Arg307 does not affect activity toward the synthetic substrate pNPA. HEs, the catalytic center Arg, has become functionally redundant. it was not immediately evident how the shift in substrate specificity was achieved. only a select number of such dissimilarities were noted involving three distinct elements. the side chains of 12 residues Glu48, His52, Asp56, and 166 residue His336 indicate that the site is occupied by a bivalent metal ion. loss of this metal ion may well have caused the disorder of the catalytic domain in the published structure of MHV-S HE (21). side chains depicted as sticks, the Zn2+ ion as a gray sphere. a type II HE converted into a type I enzyme. an RCoV HE-based chimera with all three type I/II distinctive elements replaced by those of MHV-DVIM displays strict sialate-9-O-acetylesterase activity. the error bars represent the SD over six measurements. the type II esterase metal-binding site is required for full 4-O-AE activity. the error bars represent the SD over six measurements. the observed absorption edge at 9.665 keV is close to the theoretical K-edge absorption energy of 9.6607 keV. the introduction of the three type I elements of DVIM HE into the RCoV-NJ HE background resulted in an esterase with strict type I substrate specificity. the recombinant protein lost all enzymatic activity toward 4-O-Ac-Sias. sialate-9-O-acetylesterase activity was reduced significantly by 92% (166) or even more, to below detection levels (12). a single ala74Ser mutation in the type I chimera produced a hybrid enzyme that retained most of its sialate-9-O-acetylesterase activity, but that now accepted 4-O-Ac-Sia as a substrate. however, as the type II activity is only 25% of that of RCoV-NJ conversion of a type I HE into an enzyme with dual (type I and type II) specificity would have required a single Ala-to-Ser mutation; and (ii) that, for this enzyme to gain full 4-O-AE activity, the type II-specific changes in all three elements were necessary; and (iii) that the definitive shift in substrate specificity, i.e., the exclusion of the original type I substrate 9-O-Ac-Sia, must be the type II-specific mutations all affected the P2 pocket, virtually causing the pocket to shift by 2.8 along the ridge, formed by the catalytic triad. in reality, the original P2 pocket was lost and a new one created. polar and hydrophobic interactions compensate for the loss of the Arg/sialate-carboxylate double-hydrogen bond interaction crucial to sialate-9-O-acetylesterases. the shift in ligand/substrate preference in the MuCoV HE proteins required coevolution of two distinct domains. the odds of this happening would seem remote. a single mutation in the esterase domain may have set the stage for the changes in the lectin domain to occur, leading to a shift in ligand specificity. an inconspicuous point mutation would have allowed further evolution toward optimal activity and substrate specificity of the enzyme. the type II HE receptor switch explained from the stereochemistry of protein\u2013protein interactions. the shift in esterase substrate from 9- to 4-O-Ac-Sias was accomplished not through radical changes in protein architecture, but by altering ligand binding topology in a largely conserved CBS. the adaptations in the type II HE esterase are in fact analogous to those that took place in the corresponding type II lectin domain (21). close-ups of the CBSs of mammalian lectins complexed with their receptors. in each case, monosaccharide binding relies on a strictly conserved 3-aa assembly. but that unique specificity is attained by binding of the dedicated ligands. only three of 27 strains in the species Murine coronavirus identified so far possess a type I HE. we have little to no understanding of the complexity and interspecies diversity of the sialomes in naturally occurring murids or in other mammals. HEs are either enzymatically active (HE-Fc) or rendered inactive through catalytic ser-to-Ala substitution (HE0-Fc) for receptor destruction esterase assays, HEs were produced by transient expression in HEK293 GnTI() cells. ectodomains were purified by protein A-affinity chromatography and on-the-beads thrombin cleavage. RCoV-NJ HE without ligand obtained from first condition. crystals were cryoprotected in well solution containing 20% (RCoV-NJ) or 12.5% (MHV-DVIM) (vol/vol) glycerol before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. diffraction data of RCoV-NJ was integrated with Mosflm (51) for MHV-DVIM HE, these values were 19.9% and 22.6%. statistics of data processing and refinement are listed in Table 1. binding of substrate analogs in the crystal structures of HEF and RCoV-NJ HE does not induce conformational changes, except that in HEF, a rotation of the active-site Ser side chain was observed. a rotation of the active-site Ser side chain with active rotamer was observed. crystal structure of RCoV-NJ HE0 in complex with 4-N-Ac-Sia compared with model of 4-O-Ac-Sia bound in RCoV-NJ HE as determined with autodock4. enzymatic activity of MHV-DVIM and RCoV-NJ HE toward O-acetylated Sias was measured as described (21) unbound lectin was detected using an HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG antiserum. the staining reaction was terminated by addition of 12.5% (vol/vol) H2SO4 and the optical density was measured at 450 nm. 4- and 9-O-Ac-Sias were detected by incubating with MHV-S and PToV-P4 HE0-mFc virolectins. subsequently incubated with biotinylated goat--mouse IgG antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich; 1:250), avidin\u2013biotin HRPO complex (ABC-PO staining kit; Thermo Scientific), and with 3,30-dia HEs were transiently expressed in HEK293 GnTI() cells (49) ectodomains were purified by protein A-affinity chromatography and on-the-beads thrombin cleavage. the ectodomains were purified by protein A-affinity chromatography and on-the-beads thrombin cleavage as described (19). crystals were cryoprotected in well solution containing 20% (RCoV-NJ) or 12.5% (MHV-DVIM) (vol/vol) glycerol before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. diffraction data of MHV-DVIM was integrated with Eval15 (50) and diffraction data of RCoV-NJ was further processed using the CCP4 package (52). X-ray absorption spectra were recorded using a Rontec Xflash X-ray fluorescence detector. the X-ray energy was scanned around the Zn K-edge ( = 1.28 ; energy = 9,668 eV) a ser side chain with active rotamer was introduced using COOT. we used an inverted Gaussian function (50- half-width; 15-kJ energy at infinity) to restrain the O-acetyl carbonyl oxygen in the oxyanion hole at a position occupied by a water molecule in the respective crystal structures. crystal structure of RCoV-NJ HE0 in complex with 4-N-Ac-Sia compared with model of 4-O-Ac-Sia bound in RCoV-NJ HE. lowest energy solution from 10 independent runs is shown. both structures show binding of the 4-Ac group in the P1 pocket and binding of the 5-N-Ac group in the P2 pocket. the staining reaction was terminated by addition of 12.5% (vol/vol) H2SO4 and the optical density was measured at 450 nm. all experiments were repeated as biological replicates at least two times and each time in technical triplicate. tin HRPO complex (ABC-PO staining kit; Thermo Scientific), and with 3,30-diaminobenzidine (DAB). tissue sections were embedded in Eukitt mounting medium (Fluka) crude product was concentrated in vacuo using flash silica gel (EtOAc:hexanes = 3:14:1) to afford 8.5 g of pure oxazoline glycal 3 in 61% yield over two steps. 1H-NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): = 6.38. to a 250-mL flask, crude product from azidobromination (3 g, 6.6 mmol) was added and dissolved in 120 mL of t-butyl alcohol, followed by addition of azidotrimethylsilane (4 eq. 7.6 mL, 58 mmol) the reaction was heated up to 85 \u00b0C and stirred under argon for 8 h. 12.6 Hz, H-9a), = 4.09 (dd, 1H, J = 5.8 Hz, 12.4 Hz, H-9b), = 3.86 (s, 3H, COOCH3), = 3.84\u20133.79 (s, 3H, 2-OCH3), = 2.07\u20132.02 (s, 12H, OAc, NHAc) the crude product from debromination was dissolved in THF. the reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 1 h. the solvent was removed in vacuo. sia 2 (10 g, 32 mmol) was added and dissolved in 250 mL of anhydrous methanol. the mixture was vigorously stirred at room temperature for 24 h. the solution was added slowly to 1 L of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution.
