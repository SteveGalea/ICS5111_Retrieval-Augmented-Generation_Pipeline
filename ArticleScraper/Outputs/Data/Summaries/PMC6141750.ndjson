{"summary": "human adenovirus (HAdV) infections represent a significant source of morbidity and mortality. HAdV causes fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome in healthy adults. no FDA-approved therapy for acute HAdV is available. a collaboration funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 came to fruition with the complete whole genome sequencing and analysis of all previously unsequenced HAdV-D serotypes. species and type designations for the 51 human adenovirus (HAdV) serotypes.

HAdV contains a double stranded DNA genome of 36,000 base pairs (bp) with 1 open reading frame (ORF) for every 1000 nucleotides. the outer protein coat (capsid) of the virus consists of 240 hexon capsomers and 12 penton capsomers. minor capsid structural protein VI (pVI) plays a critical role in at least three distinct aspects of the viral \u201clife\u201d cycle. these findings suggest that, as with pVI, other HAdV structural proteins may have multiple functions yet to be elucidated. genomes of HAdV-D are highly conserved (>90%). those regions of the genome shown to be hypervariable and relatively low in GC content are the very same also shown to undergo homologous recombination. however, those regions of the genome shown to be hypervariable and relatively low in GC content are the very same. dV-D63 P30H30F29/1959/USA JN935766 35168 2012 HAdV-D64 P22H19F37/1993/USA EF121005 35231 2012 HAdV-D65 P58H10F9/2004/BGD AP012285 35172 2012 HAdV-B66 P66H7F3/1987/ARG JN860676 35080 2012 HAdV-D67 P67H9 unpublished HAdV-D81 P65H48F60/2012/JPN AB765926.1 35198 Unpublished HAdV-D82 P56H15F37/2011/JPN LC066535.1 35122 Unpublished # Name indicates molecular type (P, penton base; H, hexon; F, fiber)/year of isolation/country of isolation. adenoviruses recombine specifically during viral replication. recombination occurs in the two penton base hypervariable regions. fiber (fiber gene and protein are entirely hypervariable) recombination between two HAdVs has been well documented. at least two virus types with high nucleotide sequence homology must co-infect the same cell, and viral DNA replication should be ongoing. \"Proteotyping\" is a novel approach to genome evolution. the 14.7K protein was conserved, while CR1 showed 6 unique proteotypes. maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees are shown to the left for each putative protein, and amino acid signatures to the right. each amino acid was assigned a unique color, consensus amino acids at each position were assigned white, and gaps in the alignment were colored black. homologous recombination within HAdV-D is common, and confirm previously recognized patterns of homologous recombination among HAdV-D. numbers and colors are arbitrary, and distinguish distinct proteotypes. the recA enzyme of E. coli is loaded onto unwound ssDNA by RecBCD. it promotes ssDNA exchange/recombination with homologous dsDNA. ssDNA can invade homologous dsDNA during recombination. local bacterial flora might enhance natural recombination. ssDNA could form hairpin loops during HAdV replication. polymerase jumping has been shown to occur during HAdV DNA replication. dV-D whole genome sequences identified instances of 15 nucleotide-long GC-rich sequence adjacent to 15 nucleotide-long AT-rich sequence. they were located just 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 to frequently recombined gene segments. these data suggest covariant effects of nucleotide sequence and ssDNA secondary structures on homologous recombination between two HAdV-Ds. silico ORF prediction in HAdV can be difficult due to splice variants. but in a prior annotation of HAdV-D37, 60 new additional ORFs were predicted. work is in progress to identify putative new genomic elements in HAdV. clinical strains of HAdV-E4 isolated contain a NF-I binding site in the inverted terminal repeat. this suggests that NF-I binding may be important to viral fitness in humans. we are exploring novel TF binding sites on HAdV-D DNA. highly conserved genes, such as DNA binding protein, DNA polymerase, and E3 14.7K, show no such variability. hypervariablity in major capsid and E3 proteins is driven by evolutionary selection by the extracellular interactome. amino acid differences in a hypervariable protein can also lead to differences in that protein's intracellular interactome. penton base HVL2, with its RGD motif, is critical to viral internalization through the interaction with host cell integrins. function of penton base HVL1 is unknown, and might be revealed though knowledge of its protein interactome. the closely adjacent hexon HVL1 and 2 form the epsilon epitope that determines serum neutralization. CR1, RID, and RID proteins cooperate to evade TNF-related apoptosis through TRAIL. CR1 (Wold et al., 1984), also called the adenovirus death protein (Tollefson et al., 1992), is required for cell lysis and viral spread. analysis of 38 fully sequenced HAdV-D whole genomes identified homologous recombination of specific regions within the hexon, penton base, fiber, and E3 CR1 genes as the major mechanism behind HAdV-D evolution, a new finding. HAdV is also a significant agent of disease for which there is no approved treatment. inants within HAdV-B and 15 within HAdV-D were identified. only two of the 15 HAdV-Ds were found to contain novel genes. these were subsequently typed as HAdV-D71 and 72."}
