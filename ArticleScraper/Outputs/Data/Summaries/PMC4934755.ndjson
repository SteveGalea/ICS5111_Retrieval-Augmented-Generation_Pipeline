{"summary": "coVs are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to the Coronaviridae family within the Nidovirales order (1). coVs are frequently associated with respiratory and enteric diseases in humans, livestock, and companion animals (2, 3) coV nsp14 is a bifunctional enzyme that harbors both ExoN and N7-MTase activities (17\u201319). the amino-terminal part of nsp14 includes the ExoN active core, which is divided into three motifs: I (DE), II (E), and III (D) nsp14 hydrolyzes single- and double-stranded RNA (ssRNA and dsRNA) to final products of 8 to 12 nucleotides (nt) and 5 to 7 nt respectively. its nucleolytic activity is enhanced up to 35-fold by interaction with nsp10 (17, 22) nsp14 activity was proposed to be part of the RNA proofreading machinery during CoV replication (20, 23) the bifunctional nsp14 is part of the large multisubunit polymerase complex. it integrates RNA polymerization, proofreading, and cap-modifying activities into a multifunctional protein assembly (16, 31) a zinc finger (ZF) is a small, independently folded domain that is structured around a zinc ion. overexpression studies have revealed that nsp14 acts as an IFN antagonist (40), although it has not been determined whether this activity is linked to its ExoN or N7-MTase domains. the possibility that CoV ribonucleases could degrade dsRNA PAMPs has been suggested as an additional mechanism preventing IFN induction during CoV infection (42). cDNAs of TGEV-derived replicons and infectious viruses were generated by PCR-directed mutagenesis. overlapping PCR fragments were obtained by using as a template the plasmid pBAC-TGEV (47), containing the full-length TGEV genome (GenBank accession number AJ271965) the 3\u2032 fragment was obtained by using the specific forward primer shown in Table 1. full-length amplicons were generated by overlap extension of 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 PCR products using primers nsp13-finVS and nsp15prin-RS. insertions were cloned into the same sites of pBAC-REP2 (46) pBAC-TGEV-S7.1-nsp14-ExoI, pBAC-TGEV-S7.1-nsp14-ExoIII, pBAC-TGEV-S7.1-nsp14-ZF-H, pBAC-TGEV-S7.1-nsp14\u2013ZF-C, and pBAC-TGEV-S7.1-nsp14-N7MTase. all cloning steps were checked by sequencing of an nsp14 protein with a 6-His tag fused at its N terminus was expressed in the baculovirus-insect cell system. nsp14 was purified to near-homogeneity using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose. RNA presence at passages 0 and 1 was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) total cellular RNA was extracted using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) RNA was removed by treatment of 7 g of each purified RNA with 20 U of DNase I (Roche) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C.

RNA was purified with an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's specifications. 7 g of each RNA was treated with 20 U of DNase I (Roche) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. the -glucuronidase (GUSB) gene (TaqMan code Ss03387751_u1) was used as a reference housekeeping gene. its expression remains constant in both infected and noninfected cells. transfected BHK-N cells and infected ST cells were collected at the indicated times. cell lysates were resolved by denaturing electrophoresis. blots were then incubated with monoclonal antibodies (pAb) specific for TGEV N protein (MAb-3DC10) (58) or -actin (Abcam) (1:10,000 dilution) protein amounts were estimated by densitometric analysis using imageLab 4.1 software (Bio-Rad) at least three different experiments and appropriate gel exposures were used in all cases with similar results. cell nuclei stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) (1:500) cell nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma) (1:200) both cell lines were transfected with the Sindbis virus replicon pSINrep1 (44) expressing TGEV nucleocapsid (N) protein. cDNAs of TGEV-derived replicons and infectious viruses were generated by PCR-directed mutagenesis. full-length amplicons were generated by overlap extension of 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 PCR products using primers nsp13-finVS and nsp15prin-RS. all intermediate plasmids were digested with NheI and PacI restriction enzymes. insertions were cloned into the same sites of pBAC-REP2 (46), generating the mutant replicons pBAC-TGEV-S7.1. pBAC-TGEV-S7.1-nsp14\u2013ZF-H, pBAC-TGEV-S7.1-nsp14\u2013ZF-C, and pBAC-TGEV-S7.1-nsp14-N7MTase. cloning steps were checked by sequencing of the PCR fragments and cloning junctions. baculovirus purified to near-homogeneity by metal chelate affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose. specific polyclonal antisera were generated by Biogenes GmbH (Germany) after immunization of rabbits with purified recombinant nsp14. BHK-pAPN-N or BHK-N cells grown to 90% confluence in 35- g of each purified RNA with 20 U of DNase I (Roche) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. RNAs were repurified using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) PCRs were performed to analyze genomic RNA (gRNA) by amplifying nsp14 sequences. each rTGEV was cloned by three plaque purification steps. 7 g of each RNA was treated with 20 U of DNase I (Roche) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. 100 ng of total RNA was used as the template for synthesis of cDNA with random hexamers using a high Capacity cDNA transcription kit. real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) was analyzed with 7500 software v2.0.6. the relative quantifications were performed using the threshold cycle (2-CT) method (55) transfected BHK-N cells and infected ST cells were collected at the indicated times. cell lysates were resolved by denaturing electrophoresis in 1 SDS gel-loading sample buffer (57) blots were then incubated with monoclonal antibodies (pAb) specific for TGEV N protein (MAb-3DC10) (58) or -actin (Abcam) (59) at least three different experiments and appropriate gel exposures were used in all cases with similar results. different exposures of the same experiment were analyzed to ensure that data were obtained within the linear range. the intensity of the fluorescence was measured by measuring the mean gray fluorescence of individual cells from gray-scale projections of microscopy images. the variance of the intensity was also determined, and the normalized optical density variance was calculated as an indicator of signal dispersion. data represent average of 30 individual cell measurements. nsp14 is highly conserved among different CoV genera. all previously described motifs were identified in TGEV nsp14. two mutants were designed to affect the catalytic residues DE and D within the conserved exonuclease motifs ExoI and Exo III. mutant ZF-H showed a modest reduction in replication in comparison to WT levels. the level of mRNA-7 was comparable to that of the nonreplicative replicon. in contrast, the ZF-C mutant completely abolished transcription. mutant cDNAs were transfected into BHK-pAPN cells expressing TGEV N protein that were plated over ST cells. at 48 hpt, cell supernatants were harvested (passage 0) and used to infect ST cells. RT-qPCR analysis of viral RNA from passage 0 and passage 1 of the rTGEV-ExoI and rTGEV-ExoIII mutants compared with the rTGEV-WT. both negative and positive strands were measured by RT-qPCR using specific TaqMan assays 24 h posttransfection. a similar reduction in viral RNA synthesis was observed for HCoV-229E, MHV, and SARS-CoV (17, 21) this reduction in viral RNA synthesis did not prevent virus recovery. experiments performed using previous rTGEV mutants that had a higher reduction in RNA synthesis led to the recovery of viable viruses. the rTGEV-ZF-C virus was successfully recovered with a titer of 4.3 107 PFU/ml, similar to the WT virus (8.7 107 PFU/ml) the introduced mutations were present in the recovered mutant virus, even after 10 passages in cell cultures of plaque-purified viruses. the infectious titer of rTGEV-ZF-C was up to 10-fold higher than that of rTGEV-WT at early times postinfection. the maximum titer observed from 24 hpi was identical to that of the rTGEV-WT. rTGEV-ZF-C and rTGEV-WT showed the same gRNA accumulation kinetics at early times postinfection. however, at late times postinfection, rTGEV-ZF-C accumulated lower levels of gRNA than rTGEV-WT. this data could be attributed to the dissemination of rTGEV-ZF-C being less efficient than that of rTGEV-WT. decreased cleavage of N protein by caspases was observed during rTGEV-ZF-C infection in comparison to rTGEV-WT results. rTGEV-ZF-C virus triggered reduced apoptosis. rTGEV-ZF-C infection led to significantly reduced levels of IFN- (up to 25-fold) and TNF (up to 17-fold) in comparison to rTGEV-WT infection. levels of accumulation of IRF-1, OAS, RIG-I, and MDA-5 mRNAs were similar in the two cases. asterisks indicate the fold change in induction by rTGEV-WT relative to that of mutant rTGEV-ZF-C. results indicated that rTGEV-ZF-C triggered an antiviral response that was reduced in comparison to that of rTGEV-WT. dsRNA accumulation in rTGEV-ZF-C-infected cells. nsp14 was detected using a specific polyclonal antisera and a secondary antibody staining green. dsRNA was detected using monoclonal antibody MAb-J2 and a secondary antibody staining green. dsRNA was detected using monoclonal antibody MAb-J2 and a secondary antibody staining green. in order to quantify the cytoplasmic dsRNA accumulation and distribution, the mean intensity of fluorescence and the normalized variance of the intensity of fluorescence were measured in 30 individual cells. unbiased analysis showed that, at early times postinfection, no significant differences were observed in either mean intensity or variance of intensity between rTGEV-ZF-C- and rTGEV-WT-infected cells. ST cells were infected with rTGEV-ZF-C or rTGEV-WT at an MOI of 1. at 4 hpt, viral RNA accumulation and the induction of the innate immune response were analyzed by measuring gRNA, IFN-, and TNF mRNA accumulation by RT-qPCR. in the absence of poly(IC), gRNA production levels were significantly reduced in rTGEV-ZF-C-infected cells NF mRNAs were performed by RT-qPCR using specific TaqMan assays. RNA was extracted from mock-infected (M) or rTGEV-WT (WT)- and rTGEV-ZF-C (ZF)-infected ST cells. the RNA was then analyzed using a bioanalyzer. coinfections with rTGEV-ZF-C and rTGEV-WT were performed to evaluate if the antiviral response elicited by rTGEV-ZF-C infection was modulated by rTGEV-ZF-C. a slight difference in gRNA levels between rTGEV-ZF-C and rTGEV-WT was also observed during independent infections. rTGEV-ZF-C mutants were mock infected with rTGEV-ZF-C or rTGEV-WT or coinfected with each virus at two different ratios. at 16 h postinfection, total intracellular RNA was collected, and quantification of viral genomic RNA (gRNA), IFN-, and TNF mRNAs was performed. nsp14 is highly conserved among different CoV genera. all previously described motifs were identified in TGEV nsp14. two mutants were designed to affect the catalytic residues DE and D within the conserved exonuclease motifs ExoI and Exo III. mutant ZF-H showed a modest reduction in replication in comparison to WT levels. the level of mRNA-7 was comparable to that of the nonreplicative replicon. in contrast, the ZF-C mutant completely abolished transcription. mutant cDNAs were transfected into BHK-pAPN cells expressing TGEV N protein that were plated over ST cells. at 48 hpt, cell supernatants were harvested (passage 0) and used to infect ST cells (passage 1). RT-qPCR analysis of viral RNA from passage 0 and passage 1 of the rTGEV-ExoI and rTGEV-ExoIII mutants. Lanes A and B indicate duplicate infectious cDNAs, tested individually for each mutant. both negative and positive strands were measured by RT-qPCR. a similar reduction in viral RNA synthesis was observed for HCoV-229E, MHV, and SARS-CoV (17, 21) this reduction in viral RNA synthesis did not prevent virus recovery. experiments performed using previous rTGEV mutants that had a higher reduction in RNA synthesis led to the recovery of viable viruses. rTGEV-ZF-C virus was successfully recovered with a titer of 4.3 107 PFU/ml. rTGEV-ZF-C virus was successfully recovered with a titer of 4.3 107 PFU/ml. mutations were present in the recovered mutant virus, even after 10 passages. the infectious titer of rTGEV-ZF-C was up to 10-fold higher than that of rTGEV-WT at early times postinfection. the maximum titer observed from 24 hpi was identical to that of the rTGEV-WT. rTGEV-ZF-C and rTGEV-WT showed the same gRNA accumulation kinetics at early times postinfection. however, at late times postinfection, rTGEV-ZF-C accumulated lower levels of gRNA than rTGEV-WT. this data could be attributed to the dissemination of rTGEV-ZF-C being less efficient than that of rTGEV-WT. decreased cleavage of N protein by caspases was observed during rTGEV-ZF-C infection in comparison to rTGEV-WT results. rTGEV-ZF-C virus triggered reduced apoptosis. rTGEV-ZF-C infection led to significantly reduced levels of IFN- (up to 25-fold) and TNF (up to 17-fold) in comparison to rTGEV-WT infection. levels of accumulation of IRF-1, OAS, RIG-I, and MDA-5 mRNAs were similar in the two cases. asterisks indicate the fold change in induction by rTGEV-WT relative to that of mutant rTGEV-ZF-C. results indicated that rTGEV-ZF-C triggered an antiviral response that was reduced in comparison to that of rTGEV-WT. dsRNA accumulation in rTGEV-ZF-C-infected cells was analyzed by immunofluorescence. nsp14 was detected using a specific polyclonal antisera and a secondary antibody staining green. dsRNA was detected using monoclonal antibody MAb-J2 and a secondary antibody staining green. DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) was used to stain nuclear DNA. in order to quantify the cytoplasmic dsRNA accumulation and distribution, the mean intensity of fluorescence and the normalized variance of the intensity of fluorescence were measured in 30 individual cells. unbiased analysis showed that, at early times postinfection, no significant differences were observed in either mean intensity or variance of intensity between rTGEV-ZF-C- and rTGEV-WT-infected cells. ST cells were infected with rTGEV-ZF-C or rTGEV-WT at an MOI of 1. at 4 hpt, viral RNA accumulation and the induction of the innate immune response were analyzed by measuring gRNA, IFN-, and TNF mRNA accumulation. rTGEV-WT virus, together with poly(IC), triggered an exacerbated immune response. TNF mRNAs were performed by RT-qPCR using specific TaqMan assays. RNA was extracted from mock-infected (M) or rTGEV-WT (WT)- and rTGEV-ZF-C (ZF)-infected ST cells. the RNA was then analyzed using a bioanalyzer. coinfections with rTGEV-ZF-C and rTGEV-WT were performed to evaluate if the antiviral response elicited by rTGEV-ZF-C infection was modulated. a slight difference in gRNA levels between rTGEV-ZF-C and rTGEV-WT was also observed during independent infections. a decreased innate immune response was observed in cells coinfected with rTGEV-ZF-C and the reduction was dependent on the MOI used for the rTGEV-ZF-C virus. rTGEV-ZF-C mutants were mock infected or coinfected with each virus at two different ratios. at 16 h postinfection, total intracellular RNA was collected and quantification of viral genomic RNA (gRNA), IFN-, and TNF mRNAs was performed by RT-qPCR. mutants with abrogated ExoN activity were lethal, despite being competent in viral RNA and protein synthesis. the reduction in RNA synthesis is most likely not itself the causative factor for the lethality of the ExoN mutations. in vitro studies have revealed that CoV nsp14 binds to both ssRNA and dsRNA with no sequence specificity. nsp14 mutant protein exonuclease or N7-MTase activity is complex. this complexity makes it difficult to predict how mutations might impact the properties of binding of a ZF-containing protein to its substrate. this would require in vitro analysis with purified nsp14 proteins (17, 28) cells infected with mutant rTGEV-ZF-C accumulated lower levels of dsRNA than the rTGEV-WT-infected cells. two alternative explanations are compatible with this fact: the ZF-C mutant degrades dsRNA more efficiently than the WT virus. however, the biochemical activity of nsp14 as an RNase, which has been clearly reported in vitro (17, 22), is hardly compatible with a role in generating rTGEV-WT infection of ST cells produces around 35 pg/ml of IFN- (54) this concentration is much lower than that required to affect TGEV replication. a concentration of 9,000 pg/ml of IFN- is required to cause a 20-fold decrease in viral titer. mutants lacking 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease activity do not inhibit IFN induction. arenavirus NP directly interacts with cytosolic RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA-5 (73) nsp14 is known to interact with the cellular helicase DDX1 which activates type I IFN responses. proteins may counteract the innate immune response by degrading dsRNA and limiting activation of antiviral pathways by cytosolic sensors. they may serve as targets for the design of novel antiviral strategies."}
