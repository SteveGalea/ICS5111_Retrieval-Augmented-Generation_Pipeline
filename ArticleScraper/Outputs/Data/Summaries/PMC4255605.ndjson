{"summary": "in the past decade, maternal vaccination has emerged as a promising public health strategy to prevent and combat maternal, fetal and neonatal infections. the development and evaluation of safe and effective maternal vaccines are hampered by the lack of thorough understanding of the efficacy and safety in the pregnant women and the offspring. maternal vaccination is a form of immunization for women of childbearing age before, during or after pregnancy. it aims to protect the mother against infections that may threaten healthy reproduction. the protection function of maternal vaccination in neonates was initially suggested by a correlation between a maternal deficiency of Group B streptococcus anti-capsular antibodies and neonatal susceptibility to invasive GBS infection. this review aims to bridge the gaps in the literature and offer a mechanistic direction for maternal vaccine research. a systematic literature search was performed in PUBMED using the key words in each section title of the outline. heightened neonatal susceptibility was attributed to a less intact mucosal barrier. lack of existing immunological memory and immaturity of the neonatal immune system. many quantitative and qualitative differences in both the innate and adaptive components of fetal and neonatal immune systems from their adult counterparts were documented. recent studies have argued against the fetal immune system being immature versions of the adult immune system. a series of studies have argued against the fetal immune system being immature versions of the adult immune system. the intrinsic differences in neonatal immune cells from their adult counterparts can be overcome by appropriate manipulation of the neonatal immune environment. pregnant women have an increased incidence of and/or severity to a variety of infections, such as influenza, varicella, measles, severe acute respiratory syndrome, tuberculosis, listeriosis, pneumocystis, toxoplasmosis and malaria. epidemiological data have shown that pregnant women have an increased incidence of and/or severity to a variety of infections. indsay et al., 2006, Neuzil et al., 1998; Schanzer et al., 2007; Siston et al., 2010) and a higher incidence of Listeria monocytogenes. differences are likely to result from the distinct types of protective immunity required to control the various pathogens during acute or chronic infection and the unique immunological alterations occurring at different stages of pregnancy. neonates do not mount effective protective immunity to many viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens. the increased neonatal susceptibility to infections is more pronounced in infants born prematurely. the heightened neonatal susceptibility was believed to be due to the immaturity of the fetal immune system. the antibody responses to many encapsulated bacteria (such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis) are weak in early infancy. this is perhaps due to delayed formation of the splenic marginal zone (MZ) neonatal vaccination should be pursued but with caution. many agents designed to break neonatal tolerance may trigger side effects. the deviation toward an anti-inflammatory TH2 or Treg response during mid-to-late gestation may protect the fetus from preterm delivery. women in the second and third trimesters were shown to have higher maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity from influenza A infection. women in the second and third trimesters were shown to have higher maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity from influenza A infection. a careful examination of epidemiological data suggests that the severity of infections varies at different stages of pregnancy. maternal vaccination generates active innate, humoral and cell-mediated immune protection in the mother to increase resistance against infections and reduce the chance of vertical transmission of infections to the fetus. maternal vaccination generates active innate, humoral and cell-mediated immune protection in the mother to increase resistance against infections. maternal antibodies can be transferred via both routes. maternal vaccination induces innate, humoral and cell-mediated immunity. Vaccine-induced maternal IgG is also transferred to the fetus. maternal IgA facilitates antigen sampling in the neonatal intestinal mucosa. ingested maternal IgG can also cross epithelial cells via FcRn (m) through a mechanism similar to that in syncytiotrophoblasts. this pathway delivers antigens to, and regulates, DCs via activating or inhibitory FcRs (n) maternal IgG binds to neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) after endocytosis by placental syncytiotrophoblasts. maternal IgG passes through villous stroma and fetal capillary endothelium and enters fetal circulation. a sharp increase of maternal IgG in cord blood occurs after 36 weeks of gestation. this has prompted the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to recommend that the optimal timing of Tdap vaccination is the third trimester. first trimester vaccination could also improve fetal and neonatal outcomes. ingested maternal IgG can also undergo retrograde transport by FcRn expressed on the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells. these mechanisms can promote the induction of immunity against luminal pathogens and tolerance to commensal microbes. cord blood rubella-specific IgD levels reach levels comparable to those in maternal blood. secreted IgD exhibits extensive V(D)J gene somatic hypermutation. secreted IgD exhibits extensive V(D)J gene somatic hypermutation. there has been no study on the function of IgD in maternal, fetal or neonatal protection at the time of this review. the argument for vaccination in pregnancy is not solely based on altruistic behavior on the part of the mother. this is perhaps due to a general unwillingness to study pregnant patients. preferential transport was found for IgG1 and IgG4 over IgG3 and IgG2. a sharp increase of maternal IgG in cord blood occurs after 36 weeks of gestation. a study on influenza vaccination found that first trimester vaccination could improve fetal and neonatal outcomes by reducing the rate of stillbirth. secretory IgA is the predominant antibody class in human colostrum and milk. in the gut, ingested maternal IgG can undergo retrograde transport by FcRn expressed on the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells. these mechanisms can promote the induction of immunity against luminal pathogens. on maternal vaccination has been focused on vaccine-induced maternal antepartum IgG response and post-partum IgG, IgA and IgM responses in breast milk. IgD is enriched in the upper respiratory mucosa, markedly increased in patients with selective IgA deficiency. the production of IgD is positively regulated by TH2 cytokines. IgD inhibits IgE-induced histamine release but not cytokine production by basophils. there has been no study on the function of IgD in maternal, fetal or neonatal protection. the ACIP to be administered to all women of reproductive age before, during or after pregnancy. several other vaccines, including Hepatitis A and B and meningococcal, are recommended for women before, during or after pregnancy when risk factors exist.

(2008) Inhibition of infant B cells and follicular DCs and macrophages by ing maternal administration of Tdap correlated with a higher level of pertussis-specific antibodies between birth and the first vaccine dose. the long-standing observation of its heightened severity on the mother and the fetus has underscored the importance of maternal vaccination and promoted the ACIP recommendation. studies on inadvertent pneumococcal polysaccharide, rubella or yellow fever vaccination cases found no significant maternal or fetal risk. there remains a significant gap in our knowledge of their short- and long-term safety. long-term childhood neurodevelopmental conditions (i.e. autism) and venues to seek relief in the event of an identifiable vaccine-related injury. the responsibility lies with the scientific community to continue a vigilant watch through basic research efforts and post-marketing surveillance systems. studies on how maternal antibodies may actually interfere with vaccine-induced humoral immunity in infants are needed. maternal antibodies differ from IVIGs in quantity, structure, composition and function, such as half-life, glycosylation pattern, isotype and affinity for antigens and Fc receptors. maternal IgG Albrecht et al.
