{"summary": "lycorine, a natural alkaloid extracted from Amaryllidaceae, exhibited anti-leukemia effects in vitro and in vivo. survival rate of HL-60 cells exposed to lycorine was decreased, cell growth was slowed down, and cell regeneration potential was inhibited. apoptotic events are regulated by interplay of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins. apoptotic events are regulated by interplay of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins. the death receptor pathway and mitochondria-apoptosome-mediated pathway may represent potential targets for rational tumor therapy. p21-dependent cell cycle arrest occurs at the G2/M phase. the key regulator of the cell division cycle 2 is the cell division cycle 2 (Cdc2)/Cyclin B, the activity of which can be regulated by p21. alkaloids exhibit effective anti-cancer activities with multiple mechanisms. lycorine induced apoptosis in human leukemia cells via the mitochondria pathway and increased the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio through the down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression. lycorine exerted its in vitro antitumor activity through cytostatic rather than cytotoxic effects. lycorine significantly up-regulate p21 mRNA and protein in a concentration-dependent manner after treatment with lycorine. results showed that these proteins were significantly down-regulated in a concentration-dependent manner after treatment with p21. expression level of truncated Bid (tBid) decreased when lycorine concentration reached 5.0 M. expression level of truncated Bid (tBid) was significantly increased in a concentration-dependent manner. cytochrome c appeared red when stained with cyanine 3 (Cy3) fluorochrome. staining patterns of cytochrome c became diffuse and blurred. some red dye entered the nucleus and mixed with the blue stain to yield a purple-stained nucleus. the expression of NF-B protein in the nucleus decreased significantly in HL-60 cells treated with different concentrations of lycorine. immunocytochemistry results showed that lycorine significantly blocked the nuclear import of NF-B protein. lycorine was distributed in the cytoplasm (D4, D6) in HL-60 cells treated with lycorine. NF-B was mainly distributed in the nucleus in untreated cells (D1, D3) results were presented as mean S.D. (n = 3, three independent experiments) Asterisk symbol (*) indicates significant difference (p 0.05) compared with the control group. up-regulation of TNF- and increase of truncated Bid. tBid may promote release of cytochrome c and subsequent activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3. immunofluorescence of cytochrome c was visualized with a confocal laser microscope. cytochrome c appeared red when stained with cyanine 3 (Cy3) fluorochrome. cytochrome c displayed a dotted pattern in untreated cells. inhibition of IB phosphorylation and blockade of NF-B nuclear import. expression levels of IB and NF-B were not obviously changed in HL-60 cells treated with lycorine. HL-60 cells treated with 0, 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0 M lycorine. p21 is tightly controlled by the tumour suppressor protein p53. p53 mediates the p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest at G1 phase. lycorine regulated the expression of p21 and then influenced the expression of down-stream genes Cyclin B-Cdc2 and Cyclin E-Cdk2. p21 also functions as a proapoptotic molecule in the HL-60 cell line, a p53-indeficient leukemia cell line. this implies that the up-regulation of p21 go through p53-independent pathways, and it is possible that p21 acts as p21 mediated crosstalk between lycorine-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. p21 may also play an important role in apoptosis induced by activation of members of the TNF death receptor family. NF-B regulates the transcription of many genes related to immune and inflammatory responses. RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR analyses Total cellular RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) from cells treated with various concentrations of lycorine (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0 M) the PCR mixture was denatured at 95\u00b0C for 10 s, 56\u00b0C for 20 s, and 68\u00b0C for 20 s for 40 cycles in the Mastercycler Realplex2 (Eppendorf) the primer sequences and their lengths Primers Sequences Product length p21 p21 p21 Reverse 5'-GAAGATCAGCCGGCGTTTG-3' 155 bp for p21 p21 Reverse 5'-GAAGATCAG membranes were blocked in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) containing 5% nonfat dried milk power for 1 h, then incubated 2 h with desired primary antibodies. after 3 times washes, blots were developed with a chemiluninescene detection kit (ECL; Pierce) cells were incubated for 2 h with mouse anti-NF-B antibody and washed 3 times with PBS buffer. cells were stained with 1 g/ml of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. DNA was stained with 1 g/ml of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. the primer sequences were designed using Primer 5 software in accordance with the GenBank sequence. the primer sequences are listed in Table 1. 1.0 g of total RNA of each group and 0.5 g of oligo (dT)16 were added to an eppendorf tube and incubated at 65\u00b0C for 5 min. the reaction system volume was adjusted to 20 l by adding 4.0 l of 5 MMLV RT buffer, 20 units of RNasin, 1.0 -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin -actin immunofluorescence staining was used to analyze subcellular distribution of cytochrome c and NF-B in HL-60 cells induced by lycorine. cell pellets were smeared on a slide and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min. non-specific antigens were blocked with normal serum diluted 1:20 in PBS. groups were determined by AVOVA and Tukey's Studentized Range test. differences were considered statistically different at P 0.05. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
