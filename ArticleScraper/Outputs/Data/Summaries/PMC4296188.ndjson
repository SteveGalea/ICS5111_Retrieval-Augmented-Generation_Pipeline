{"summary": "households with at least 4 members, at least 2 of whom were children aged 18 years, were enrolled and followed through annual respiratory illness surveillance periods. each annual cohort was derived from persons who had selected a primary healthcare provider from within the University of Michigan Health System in Ann Arbor. Illnesses followed for collection of data on illness characteristics. documentation of healthcare contact for treatment of ARI was also noted. high-risk health conditions, including cardiac and pulmonary disorders, were documented on the basis of medical record review. for each surveillance period, the mean number of reported ARIs with specimen collection per individual was examined and compared by household and subject characteristics. seasonality of virus-specific circulation was examined and compared by age category, likelihood of medical attention, and presence of coinfecting viruses. enrollment was delayed until the fall months, and surveillance was initiated in December. households were instructed at enrollment and via weekly e-mail reminders to report all ARIs defined by 2 of the following symptoms. this case definition facilitated inclusion of even mild symptomatic illnesses. RNA was extracted from specimens for influenza virus testing by means of the Qiagen QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. DNA/RNA was extracted for additional respiratory virus testing using the accompanying vacuum manifold protocols. households were characterized by size (number of members) and composition (presence of members 5 years of age), and subjects were characterized by sex, age category, and high-risk health status. in all 3 study years, mean household size was approximately 4.5 persons. 58% of subjects were children 18 years of age, and 4% were older adults. each study year, approximately 11% of subjects had medical record documentation of 1 or more high-risk health conditions. participants Overall 1441/1441 (100) 0.7 (1.0) 943/943 (100) 0.4 (0.8) 1426/1426 (100) 0.8 (1.2) Age categoryc 5 y (reference) 233/1441 (16.2) 1.1 (1.2) 112/943 (11.9) 0.7 (1.1) 217/1426 (15.2) 1.4 (1.6) 5\u201311 y 392/1441 (27.2) 0.7 (1.0)b 289/943 (30 a comparison was made using the 2-sample t test. b P.001. the pairwise t test was used to assess differences in mean number of ARI cases. the average number of ARIs per household was 3.0 and 3.5 in study years 1 and 3, respectively, and 1.9 in year 2. each season, the number of ARI events experienced by individual subjects ranged from 0 to 6. Table 2. The distribution of cases of acute respiratory Illness (ARI) per Household Member over 3 Surveillance Seasons. the ARI outbreaks were similarly intense in the approximately 30-week surveillance periods in study years 1 and 3 and considerably milder in the shorter (23 week) period in year 2. influenza A(H3N2) virus, 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus, and influenza B virus cocirculated in year 1. adenovirus infections were primarily identified from October through December. the timing of peak HMPV circulation was consistent with the timing of influenza virus circulation. in all 3 study years, the timing of peak HMPV circulation was consistent with the timing of influenza virus circulation. ARIs caused by adenoviruses, 41% involving HMPVs and 32% involving RSVs were the viruses most frequently identified. ARIs with at least 1 virus identified, 16% had 1 or more coinfecting viruses identified; coinfection was most likely to occur in young children (23%). 127/258 (49) 6/131 (5) 18\u201349 y 879/2515 (35) 119/879 (14) 152/879 (17) 33/879 (4) 20/879 (2) 30/879 (3) 11/879 (1) 58/879 (7) 18/879 (2) 479/879 (54) 45/400 (11) 50 y 55/2515 (2) 8/55 (15) 12/55 (22) 3/55 (5) 2/55 (4) 1/55 (2) 0/55 (0) 6/ a Among 120 ARIs with 1 HPIV identified, 10 involved HPIV-1, 51 involved HPIV-2, and 61 involved HPIV-3. b Among 412 ARIs with 1 CoVs identified, 35 involved CoV-229E, 182 involved CoV-OC43, 152 involved CoV-NL63, and 64 involved CoV-HKU1.

ARIs caused by these viruses and ARIs with no agent identified were least likely to be medically attended. ARIs caused by influenza B virus and adenoviruses were the most frequently identified. 102/627 (16) 70/627 (11) 58/627 (9) 54/627 (9) 51/627 (8) 23/627 (4) 147/627 (23) 109/480 (23) 5\u201311 y 696/2515 (28) 127/696 (18) 46/696 (7) 35/696 (5) 32/696 (5) 29/696 (4) 59/696 (8) 48/696 (7) 279/696 (40) 78/417 (19) 12\u201317 y 258 study pooled across seasonal surveillance activities conducted during 2010-2011, 2011-2012, and 2012-2013. 10 ARIs with 1 HPIV identified, 35 involved CoV-229E, 182 involved CoV-OC43, 152 involved CoV-NL63 and 64 involved CoV-HKU1. RT-PCR is more easily and reliably performed than isolation of virus in cell culture or serology. this technique has increased the sensitivity of virus detection and expanded the ability to detect viruses now known to cause ARIs. the current results confirm observations of the original and current studies. NL63 is a commonly identified coronavirus, with HKU1 similar in frequency to 229E. despite vaccination coverage of approximately 60%, detection of >1 virus has become common. PCR technique has detected a new issue, virus coinfection. the etiological role of each virus identified will need to be examined. the PCR technique has detected a new issue, virus coinfection."}
