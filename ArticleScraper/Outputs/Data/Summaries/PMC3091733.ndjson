{"summary": "pathogenID v2.0 microarray was based on consensus sequences specific for one gene generated from global alignment of a large number of influenza virus sequences available in databanks. results For each HA (H1, H2, H3, H5, H7 and H9) and NA (N1, N2 and N7) molecular type chosen to be tested, 1 to 3 consensus sequences were computed and tiled on the microarray. sixteen hemagglutinin molecular types (designated H1 to H16) and nine neuraminidase molecular types (designated N1 to N9) have been identified, although only a few of them occur in viruses causing human diseases. identification and selection of sequences to be used on a microarray are particularly challenging. a resequencing microarray was designed in order to allow identification of genetically diverse human RNA rhinoviruses and enteroviruses. one respiratory pathogen resequencing microarray allowed the detection of geographically distant human H1N1, H3N2 and avian H5N1 influenza virus strains covering the period between 1999 and 2005. sequences characterised by a minimum size of 200 bp reduce the number of probes required for tiling yet still covering the wide diversity of influenza virus strains. four genes including PB2, M, HA and NA were chosen in order to type and subtype influenza viruses. the HA and NA subtypes chosen to be tiled on the microarray are shared by all the human viruses and highly pathogenic avian viruses. for each major HA and NA gene, sequences of influenza A virus were selected from different hosts including horses, pigs, humans and birds. a consensus sequence was automatically obtained from this common region, characterised by a minimum size of 200 bases and a divergence between the consensus sequence and any given sequence belonging to the cluster of less than 15%. the microarray based on the resequencing approach included 27 influenza viral sequences which correspond to 7594 bases. the eight probes represented perfect matches, while the others corresponded to possible mismatches at the central (13th) position of the 25 mers. all together, 60752 probes were then tiled on the microarray, allowing subtyping of influenza viruses from different host species. all samples were viral isolates, propagated either in embryonated chicken eggs or in MDCK cell cultures. time range indicated the oldest isolate with high homology provided by the BLASTN algorithm and the most recent one. time range indicated the oldest isolate with high homology provided by the BLASTN algorithm. the median obtained for the NA gene from the A/Johannesburg/33/94 (H3N2) virus was relatively recent compared to the year of isolation of the strain. the median obtained for the NA gene from the A/Johannesburg/33/94 (H3N2) virus was relatively recent compared to the year 2000. three major influenza A virus subtypes are currently circulating in swine worldwide, but the origins and the antigenic and genetic characteristics of these swine influenza viruses differ with continents or regions of the world. between 1983 and 1985, swine H3N2 viruses appeared in Italy. they contained avian-influenza-like internal segments and human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses isolated in 1994. the pathogenID v2.0 DNA microarray is able to provide correct full subtyping of different strains from different host origins. in all cases, the strains output by BLASTN belonged to the same time period thus giving a strong insight into the variant to which it is genetically, and very probably antigenically, related. the majority of the \"classical\" sequences were identical to those found after the DNA microarray. the level of sequence information generated by the DNA resequencing microarray is sufficient and equivalent to that obtained by classical sequencing. four genes including PB2, M, HA and NA were chosen in order to type and subtype influenza viruses. a partially conserved sequence of 218 bp covering the majority of influenza M segments was used for genus identification. sequences of influenza A virus were selected from different hosts including horses, pigs, humans and birds. for each major HA and NA gene, sequences of influenza A virus were selected from different hosts including horses, pigs, humans and birds. jor_group_1 750..940 190 H9_Group_1 698..868 170 H9_Group_2 1226.1423 197 NA N1_Major_group_1 408..689 281 N1_Minor_group_2 471..722 251

strains. all samples were viral isolates, propagated either in embryonated chicken eggs or in MDCK cell cultures. they were chosen from sufficiently distant points in time to cover a large diversity of influenza viruses. based on the sequences showing the highest alignment scores (see Methods section). based on the sequences showing the highest alignment scores (see Methods section) the median obtained for the NA gene from the A/Johannesburg/33/94 (H3N2) virus was relatively recent compared to the year 2000. the median obtained for the NA gene from the A/Johannesburg/33/94 (H3N2) virus was relatively recent compared to the year of isolation of the strain. t/7625/99 (H1N2) virus is the result of a multiple reassortment involving a swine influenza virus with avian-influenza-like internal segments. between 1983 and 1985, swine H3N2 viruses appeared in Italy. they contained avian-like internal genes and HA and NA genes from human H3N2 viruses only. in BLASTN analysis, the vast majority of the sequences sorted by the algorithm for the strains output by BLASTN belonged to the same time period. amplification of viral RNA followed by hybridisation to the DNA microarray confirmed the identification of influenza viruses. two samples were identified as H1N1 viruses and one sample as H3N2 virus. the level of sequence information generated by the DNA resequencing microarray is sufficient and equivalent to that obtained by classical sequencing. asterisks indicate sequences that were identical to those given by the re. pathogenID v2.0 microarray demonstrated its ability to type and subtype influenza viruses with a minimum number of tiled sequences. this level of discrimination is limited by the number of sequences available in databases and their level of divergence as illustrated by results obtained with equine viruses. pathogenID v2.0 microarray was based on probe sequence selection. consensus sequences allowed to significantly limit the number of probes tiled on the non-specialised microarray. this would allow the determination of differential diagnosis with other respiratory viruses such as RSV, SARS-CoV, and co-infections. influenza virus samples were all viral isolates propagated either in embryonated chicken eggs or in MDCK cell cultures. the virus type was determined by hemagglutination inhibition assay. eggs were inoculated via the allantoic route on 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. all sequences generated by the microarray were characterised by the call rate, which is the percentage of bases determined by the resequencing algorithm. the sequence generated by the microarray showing the highest call rate was blasted against sequences available in Genbank using the 2.2.24+ program. RT and PCR were carried out with following steps: RT at 45\u00b0C for 30 min; 55\u00b0C for 15 min, 94\u00b0C for 5 min, then PCR cycle 1-30, 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 45\u00b0C for 30 sec, 72\u00b0C for 30 sec; final extension, 72\u00b0C for 5 min. Sequences of influenza virus genes were obtained from 3 individual clones for each gene. qRT-PCR specific for the M gene was confirmed. RNA isolation and amplification Viral RNA from influenza samples and allantoic fluids were extracted using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) median analysis was performed on the 100 first sequences only. first sequence(s) showing the highest scores were also detailed in Table 3.
