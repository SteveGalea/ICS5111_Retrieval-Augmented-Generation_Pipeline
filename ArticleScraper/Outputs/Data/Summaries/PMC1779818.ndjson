{"summary": "at least 30 new cases of XDR-TB are reportedly detected each month in KZN alone [12]. the number of persons harbouring latent infections is unknown (and likely unknowable at present) officials likely underestimate the true prevalence of XDR-TB. emergence of MDR-TB and XDR-TB in south africa is evidence of failure of global community to tackle curable disease. poverty and global inequity contribute to worsening of global TB situation. about half of adults in south africa with active TB are cured each year. DR-TB and XDR-TB is an indicator of the poor implementation of South Africa's TB Control Programme. a neglected but significant factor fuelling the MDR-TB and XDR-TB outbreaks in South Africa [22] is the lack of infection control in institutions. in the modern era, tuberculosis is recognised as a disease that preys upon social disadvantage [23,24] the government should rethink its policy of suspending welfare benefits to patients with MDR-TB or XDR-TB for the duration of their hospitalisation. it should consider extending welfare benefits to those infected patients who are gainfully employed as an incentive to draw such patients into the health system so that their adherence to anti-TB medication can be monitored. the containment of infectious patients with XDR-TB may take precedence over any other patients not infected with highly infectious and deadly airborne diseases, including those with full-blown AIDS. the successful containment of TB, MDR-TB, and XDR-TB in south africa and elsewhere carries human rights [29] and ethical implications. the use of involuntary detention may legitimately be countenanced as a means to assure isolation and prevent infected individuals possibly spreading infection to others. human rights advocates in south africa and elsewhere must be reminded that although a country's Bill of Rights may bestow a range of human rights on individuals, these rights can usually be restricted if doing so is reasonable and justifiable. the man complained to the ECHR that the compulsory isolation orders and his involuntary detention had been in breach of Article 5(1) of the european Convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. the applicant argued that the substantive provisions of Article 5 were not made out in his case, given that the detention did not constitute a proportionate response to the need to prevent the spread of infectious disease. patients with XDR-TB and selected MDR-TB should be quarantined separately from those with MDR-TB, as the latter is potentially curable. some degree of success in the us [37], where it helped bring down TB infection rates in states such as new york in the 1990s [38]. human rights doctrine recognises the limitation of many rights in a public health emergency. the use of legally sanctioned restrictive measures for the control of XDR-TB should not obscure the fact that being infected is not a crime. the task of global health is to help create these communities. the successful containment of TB, MDR-TB, and XDR-TB in south africa and elsewhere carries human rights [29] and ethical implications. the use of involuntary detention may legitimately be countenanced as a means to assure isolation and prevent infected individuals possibly spreading infection to others. human rights advocates in south africa and elsewhere must be reminded that although a country's Bill of Rights may bestow a range of human rights on individuals, these rights can usually be restricted if doing so is reasonable and justifiable. the applicant complained to the ECHR that the compulsory isolation orders and his involuntary detention had been in breach of Article 5(1) of the European Convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. the court held that any such detention must be in compliance with the principle of proportionality and the requirement that there be an absence of arbitrariness. less severe measures may be insufficient to safeguard public interest. patients with XDR-TB should also be quarantined separately from those with XDR-TB. isolf mccarthy: if a patient is diagnosed with XDR-TB, he may be able to spread HIV. mccarthy: if a patient is diagnosed with XDR-TB, he may be able to spread HIV. human rights doctrine recognises the limitation of many rights in a public health emergency. the use of legally sanctioned restrictive measures for the control of XDR-TB should not obscure the fact that being infected is not a crime. XDR-TB is a serious global health threat. it has the potential to derail the global efforts to contain HIV/AIDS. emergence of XDR-TB is an uncomfortable reminder of the failure of health systems to control problems at a tractable scale. the international community must be vigilant in monitoring the government's response to the XDR-TB outbreak. the government invited the WHO to an October 2006 meeting on the emerging crisis. if the government is sincere in calling for the outbreak to be treated in the same light as SARS and bird flu, then global efforts to develop rapid diagnostic tests and novel treatment regimens must be stepped up. south africa must urgently reduce crowding in hospitals where patients with TB are being treated to reduce the risk of the infection spreading. it must also devise appropriate infection-prevention strategies for health workers treating such patients."}
