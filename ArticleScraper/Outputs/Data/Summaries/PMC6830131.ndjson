HPW had a very weak effect on IBV and SEE had no effect on IBV. therefore, it was determined that the antiviral part of H. perforatum extract was ethyl acetate layer. the effect of Hypericum perforatum ethyl acetate was ethyl acetate. HPE directly treated the IBV-infected cells at the concentration of 78.13 g/ml (A), 39.06 g/ml (B) and 19.53 g/ml (C) for 30 h. the CEK cells infected with IBV produced a strong fluorescence signal at 30 h after infection. the fluorescent signal of virus was detected by IFA. hypericum perforatum ethyl acetate was incubated with 100 TCID50 IBV as positive control. mRNA expression levels of related genes were determined, including MDA5, MAVS, IFN-, IFN-, NF-B, IL-6, and TNF-. total RNA was extracted from CEK cell samples at 24, 30, and 36 h. differences between means were considered significant at *p 0.05 and highly significant at **p 0.01 when compared with the IBV-infected cell. trachea section from each experimental group was processed for histological evaluation at 6 day after infection. trachea section from the IBV-infected group was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H.E.) hypericum perforatum ethyl acetate (HPE) on IBV-induced kidney injury. the pathological scores of trachea and kidney in the IBV group were highly significantly higher than those in NC group (p 0.01) compared with the NC group, the pathological scores of trachea and kidney decreased significantly. most of the tracheal cilia in the IBV infected group fell off, the mucosal epithelial cells exfoliated and disappeared. the submucosal structure was loosely arranged, and there was a certain amount of serous exudation, inflammatory cells, and red blood cells. trachea and kidneys of different groups of SPF chickens were conducted for histopathology assay. renal tubular epithelial cells were degenerated and necrotic, the nucleus were concentrated, fragmented and dissolved, the renal tubular epithelial cells fell off into the lumen, dissolved or disappeared. there were a certain number of inflammatory cells and red blood cells in the interstitium. there was little infiltration of inflammatory cells in the renal vesicle cavity. the effect of hypericum perforatum ethyl acetate on the mRNA expression levels of trachea and kidney decreased significantly (p 0.01) with the increase of HPE dose, the score decreased in a dose-dependent manner. this indicated that HPE had better anti-IBV effect. IBV was determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. the differences between means were considered significant at *p 0.05 and highly significant at **p 0.01. Effect of hypericum perforatum ethyl acetate on the messenger ribonucleic acid expression level of gene in the trachea and kidney. the differences between means were considered significant at *p 0.05 and highly significant at **p 0.01. the differences between means were considered significant at *p 0.05 and highly significant at **p 0.01. mRNA expression levels of IL-6 and TNF- in the trachea and kidney were down-regulated. the changes were consistent to NF-B mRNA expression levels. HPE may exert an anti-IBV effect by increasing the mRNA expression levels of type I interferon and reducing mRNA expression levels. mass spectra of five representative compounds in hypericum perforatum ethyl acetate. hyperoside, quercitrin, quercetin, pseudohypericin, and hypericin were as followed. the LOQ (S/N = 3) of hyperoside, quercitrin, quercetin, pseudohypericin, and hypericin was in the range of 0.64 to 0.78 g/ml. the HPE contained 0.92% hyperoside, 1.37% quercitrin, 10.16% quercetin, 2.55% pseudohypericin, and 3.46% hypericin. TCID50 is the amount of infection in which 50% of the cells are infected by the virus. the anti-virus effect of drugs is often detected by qRT-PCR. the results of antiviral studies in vitro are also credible. the HPE was the bioactive fraction of H. perforatum extracts. ribavirin was used as control drugs. the inhibitory effect was comparable to that of ribavirin in vitro. um extract had significantly antiviral effect on IBV in vitro and in vivo. NF-B signaling pathway was disrupted by cleavage of adaptor protein MAVS in the JS/2010/12 strain of IBV. mRNA expression levels of MDA5, MAVS, IFN-, IFN-, NF-B, TNF-, and IL-6 were significantly up-regulated after IBV infection in vitro and in vivo. HPE may be up-regulate mRNA levels of IFN- and IFN- by MDA5 signaling pathway, and down-regulate mRNA expression levels of IL-6 and TNF- through NF-B signaling pathway. 301.72 m/z confirms the presence of the quercetin. the mass spectrum of hypericin shows a positive quasi-molecular ion. the HPE is the main active fraction, containing abundant levels of hyperoside, quercitrin, quercetin, pseudohypericin, and hypericin.
