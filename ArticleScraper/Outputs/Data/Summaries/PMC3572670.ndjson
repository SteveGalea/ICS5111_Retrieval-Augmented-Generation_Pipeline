{"summary": "hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an aggressive inflammatory syndrome with high mortality that results from inappropriate activation of the immune system. the incidence of HLH in Sweden has been estimated to 1.2 children per 1 million children per year, or 1 in 50,000 live births with equal sex distribution. patients with X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome can develop HLH after infection by the Epstein\u2013Barr virus (10) case report describes clinical course and treatment in a patient with HLH caused by a reactivated EBV infection. patient was a 60-year-old woman with tablet-treated diabetes mellitus who presented with fever and pain in the throat. procalcitonin was 35 g/L, which is 700 times higher than normal. initial antibiotic treatment was changed to meropenem, gensumycin, and fluconazole. no significant improvement was seen. the uptake correlates with bilaterally distributed lymph nodes in the axillary fossa and mediastinum. the activated spleen is markedly increased as compared with the background FDG uptake in the liver. no pre-existing clinical features of a background of chronic, active EBV infection. the patient had an extreme elevation of procalcitonin without signs of bacterial infection. it could be related to the cytokine storm secondary to the patient's disease. the patient had a very good response to steroids, and no treatment was necessary. infections can be viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic (4). polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive for EBV during the acute phase of the disease. this indicates that our patient reactivated a previous EBV infection."}
