{"summary": "influenza viruses are enveloped viruses with segmented, singlestranded, negativesense RNA packaged in virions as ribonucleoproteins. further classification is based on the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins protruding from the viral envelope of influenza A and B viruses. adenovirus type 37 (Ad37, family Adenoviridae), enterovirus type 70 (EV70, family Picornaviridae) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV, family Paramyxoviridae) share receptor preference with avian influenza A viruses for glycans terminating with 2,3linked sialic acid (SA2,3), 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 which is distinct from the SA2,6terminated receptor preferred by humans. expression of sialic acid via 2,8glycosidic bonds makes sialic acids easily accessible as attachment molecules for a wide variety of microbial pathogens. 1 corresponds to the site of Nlinked acylation (glycolyl or acetyl), and 2 corresponds to the site of 2,3, 2,6 and 2,8glycosidic bonds between sialic acid and galactose. some avian influenza A viruses replicate only or mainly in cells that express Neu5Gc. interest in sialic acid biology and its tissue distribution has intensified. recent research has more carefully documented the distribution of SA2,3 and SA2,6 in human tissues. epithelial tracheobronchial cells 25, 26 and epithelial cells in the larynx, 23 trachea 11, 12, 13, 23 and bronchial 13 epithelium also contain SA2,3. both trisaccharides, however, are abundantly expressed on alveolar pneumocytes. 1,4GlcNAc 28 SA2,3Gal 1,3GalNAc 28 Bronchiolar cells junctioning bronchiole and alveoli SA2,3 22 Bronchi SA2,3 27 Bronchi SA2,3Gal 1,4GlcNAc 28 Trachea/bronchi** SA2,3 25, 26 Trachea SA2,3 24 Nasopharynx SA2,3Gal 1,4GlcNAc 28 Nasal mucosa** SA2,3 22, 23, 23 ciliated nasopharyngeal, 28 ciliated tracheal, 24 ciliated tracheobronchial cells 25, 26 and ciliated bronchial cells 24, 28. the distribution of SA2,3 and SA2,6 in human cells and tissues (Table 1) generally parallels the cell and tissue tropism of influenza A viruses, 22, 25, 26, 28, 29. EV70 was also responsible for a second pandemic of AHC in the early 1980s. the third virus that binds to SA2,3 is NDV, 9 a virus of domestic fowl that has been associated with several zoonotic outbreaks of conjunctivitis among poultry and kitchen workers. it should also be noted that the human eye is an organ in which many other viruses replicate. for other SA2,3binding viruses with respiratory tropism, it will also be of interest to identify the cells in which these viruses replicate. gal1,4(Fuc1,3)GlcNAc) and Sialyl Lewis A (sLea; SA2,3Gal1,3(Fuc1,3)GlcNAc) have both been identified on conjunctival epithelial cells using antibodies. 38, 39 and both SA2,3 and SA2,6 have been detected on transformed, normal human conjunctival epithelial cells using antibodies. this suggests that human conjunctival cells are susceptible to both replicate in the human eye (including EV70 and NDV) have also been associated with CNS complications. multiple reports describe the eye as an intial site of replication in humans for measles virus, 46 respiratory syncytial virus, 47 and CVA24v, 48 and in experimentally infected animals for ebola virus, 49 human influenza A virus, 50. the eye may be an initial site of replication for H5N1 virus in humans. a veterinarian who investigated two H5N1positive Thai eagles developed conjunctivitis 2 days after examination. this raises the question whether H5N1 may use the human eye as a portal of entry preceeding transmission to the respiratory tract. avain influenza viruses showed reduced binding to glycans containing SA2,3 and increased binding to glycans containing SA2,6. glycan array analysis will be an important tool for unravelling the complex interrelationship between sialic acidbinding specificity and influenza virus tropism and pathogenicity. influenza infection in the human eye represents a potential source for transmission between humans, but not necessarily a signal of an imminent pandemic. zoonotic H5N1 cases with mild or inapparent respiratory infection may explain the prolonged incubation time before respiratory symptoms appear. adenovirus type 37 uses sialic acid as a cellular receptor. enterovirus 70 binds to different glycoconjugates containing 2,3linked sialic acid on different cell lines. virology 1983; 127:361\u2013373.
