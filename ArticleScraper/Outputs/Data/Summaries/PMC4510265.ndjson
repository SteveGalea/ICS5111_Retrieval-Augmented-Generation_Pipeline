{"summary": "studies have evaluated the antiviral activity of hundreds of ISGs acting against RNA and DNA viruses. some ISG products display direct antiviral activity and sometimes act on a narrow virus range. others act by regulating signal transduction pathways controlling IFN production and IFN responses and thus act on a broad range of viruses. ApoL1 and other human ApoL members (ApoL1, L2, L3 and L6) have emerged in high-throughput screenings of ISG activity, as proteins with antiviral activity against various classes of RNA viruses. ApoL1 restricted infection of cells by the AR86 strain of Sindbis virus and more modestly by equine encephalitis virus. it is unclear which human protein is orthologous to human ApoL2. the weak expression of Apol9 in IFN-treated mouse primary neurons contributes to the surprising susceptibility of these cells to virus infection. the study and protocol used in this study were approved by the ethics committee of the university of Louvain under the agreement # 2010/UCL/MD/031. RNA from organs of nave C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Hermant et al. 293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method. the TM973 replicon cDNA was linearized with restriction enzyme ClaI. 293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method. interferon IFN- was produced and quantified from 293T cells transfected with pcDNA3-IFN- [25] and diluted in culture medium at 5 units of IFN per ml for cell treatment. the TMEV replicon expressing the firefly luciferase (called TM973) was constructed by replacing the L-capsid-part of 2A region. the muHV-4 derivative used in this study contains the eGFP gene in a bacterial artificial chromosome cassette [33] and was generated and purified as described previously [34]. Viruses used in the study were produced and titrated on BHK-21 cells. pTM944 is a derivative of this vector, which carries the eGFP coding sequence translated from the TMEV IRES. pTM944 is a derivative of this vector, which carries the eGFP coding sequence translated from the TMEV IRES. pTM942 PGK-> ApoL9b-IRES-mCherry (p)MK65 pTM943 CMV-> FLAG-ApoL9b3 (p)MK66 pTM943 CMV-> ApoL9b-FLAG4 (p)MK82 pTM945 CMV-> ApoL9b-FLAG-IRES-mCherry (p)MK85 pTM942 PGK 117 pLKO.1 shRNA empty vector with E2-Crimson-coding region replacing PuroR (p)MK118 pMK117 shRNA targeting Phb1 coding region and co-expression E2-Crimson (p)MK120 pMK117 shRNA targeting Phb2 coding region and co-expression E2-Crimson (p)MK120 pMK117 shRNA targeting Phb2 coding region and co-expression E2-Crimson ( pTM943 contains the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter and a multi-cloning site. pTM945 is similar to pTM942 but contains the CMV promoter instead of the PGK promoter. to construct these vectors, the coding sequences of Apol9b and Apol9a were PCR-amplified from c57BL/6 mouse spleen cDNA. pMK117 was amplified by PCR from pEF1alpha-E2-Crimson vector (Clontech, 63181) with primers introducing BamHI and KpnI restrictions site and cloned into pLKO.1. shRNA sequences targeting the mouse Phb1 and Phb2 transcripts were selected from the RNA mission collection (Sigma) and cloned in pMK117 using AgeI and EcoRI restriction in 96 well plates were left untreated, infected with 1 PFU per cell of KJ26 for 10 hours or treated with 1uM staurosporine (Sigma, S-4400) for 7 hours to induce cell apoptosis. the plate was placed on a plate shaker, in the dark, for one hour at room temperature and luminescence was measured with a plate-reading GloMax luminometer (Promega, E1501) in samples from L929 cells trans protein identification by mass spectrometry after co-immunoprecipitation. samples were resolved using a 10% Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE. proteins were digested with trypsin (50ng/l in 50 mM NH4HCO3 buffer, PH 8.0) quantified plasmids are derivatives of pCR4-ToPo (Invitrogen) in which the corresponding PCR fragments were cloned. plasmid 2 TMEV (s) TM348 GAA CGT CAG CAT TTT CCG GC pTM410 TMEV (as) TM349 GGT GTG AAG AGC GGC AAG TG pTM410 (as) TM421 CA cells were fixed for 15 min with PBS containing 4% of paraformaldehyde. cells were then permeabilized for 5 min with PBS containing 0.1% of Triton X-100. blocking occurred for 1 h at room temperature in TNB blocking reagent. the endoplasmic reticulum was identified by co-transfection of pDsRed-ER. cells were incubated for 45 min before fixation with 200 nM mitotracker red FM. normalization was done by dividing the infection efficiency of each population by the average infection efficiency of cells transduced with the empty vector. NS is indicative of p-values higher than 0.05; * p-value 0.05; ** p-value 0.01; ** p-value 0.001 Animal experiments Ethics statement: Handling of mice (agreement LA1230472) tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80\u00b0C until RNA extraction. TMbase was used to predict transmembrane domains [16], SignalP 4.1 to predict signal peptide [17] and SecretomeP to predict non-canonical secretory pathway [18]. the pTM973 plasmid carrying the replicon cDNA was linearized with restriction enzyme ClaI. 0.5 g of replicon RNA was then transfected in L929 cells. the TMEV replicon expressing the firefly luciferas was diluted 1000-fold. e was constructed by replacing the L-capsid-part of 2A region (nucleotides 1064 to 3925 of pTMDA1-accession JX443418) by a DNA segment assembled by PCR and carrying in frame: i) the 2A coding sequence of FMDV which enables co-translational dissociation of the protein segment translated downstream of this sequence [30], iii) the CRE replication signal of pTMDA1 [ virus DA1 is produced by reverse genetics from plasmid pTMDA1. pTM944 is a derivative of this vector, which carries the eGFP coding sequence translated from pTM944. the TMEV IRES-eGFP region is driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. table 2 shows the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. the names of plasmids used to produce the listed lentiviral vectors contain an extra p (e.g. pMK44 for lentivirus MK44). the names of plasmids used to produce the listed lentiviral vectors contain an extra p. pTM942 is bicistronic vector carrying a phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter, a multi-cloning site, the IRES of TMEV and the mCherry coding sequence. to construct these vectors, the coding sequences of Apol9b and Apol9a were cloned in pTM942 using PCR primers. the amino acid sequence of BH3 was mutated from LHALADHAE to GHAGAAHGE for ApoL9a and GHAGAAHAE for ApoL9b. in all the constructs, the fragments obtained by PCR and their boundaries with the vectors were sequenced to rule out unexpected mutations. MK121 that express shRNA TRCN0000088454 and TRCN0000054428 were thus used for subsequent knock down experiments. pMK118 and pMK120 were thus used for subsequent knock down experiments. apoptosis and luciferase assay Caspase 3/7 activity was measured using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay (Promega, G811A) western blots were probed with anti-FLAG polyclonal (Covance, PRB-132P) and anti-actin monoclonal (Sigma, A5441) antibodies. proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG polyclonal (Covance, PRB-132P), anti-Phb1 (SantaCruz, sc-28259) or anti-Phb2 (SantaCruz, eomeDiscoverer software and the proteins were identified with SequestHT against a target-decoy nonredundant human or mouse proteins database obtained from Uniprot. q-value and Posterior Error Probability calculated by the Percolator algorithm ensuring an estimated false positive rate below 5%. qPCR standards consisted of 10-fold dilutions of quantified plasmids carrying the sequence to be amplified. cells were fixed for 15 min with PBS containing 4% of paraformaldehyde (PFA) cells were then permeabilized for 5 min with PBS containing 0.1% of Triton X-100. blocking occurred for 1 h at room temperature in TNB blocking reagent (Perkin Elmer) 88 conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) was incubated for 1 h at a 1/800 dilution in TNB. cells were mounted with Mowiol for fluorescence microscopy. data were equilibrated using Zen (Zeiss) and Adobe Photoshop. cells were suspended in PBS buffer containing 5% of FCS and 0.5% of paraformaldehyde. ApoL6 was reported to exert a pro-apoptotic activity through a Bcl-2 homology (BH3) domain, designated BH3 [10]. Sequence alignments predict the presence of BH3 domains in several mouse ApoL proteins, including ApoL9. ApoL9 does not contain any predicted signal sequence. it is predicted to be secreted by a non-canonical secretory pathway by the Secretome P server. absence of ApoL9 secretion by the classical secretion pathway was confirmed. cells were mock-transfected, transfected with the empty pTM943 plasmid (vector) or with pTM943 derivatives coding for the indicated FLAG-tagged mouse IFN-A [12] 20 hours post-transfection, cells were mock-treated (-) or treated for 4 hours with 10ug/ml of Brefeldin A (+) before total protein extraction. Circulating IFN- triggered Apol9 upregulation in many tissues. in the liver, upregulation of Apol9 expression by IFN- was less clear. circulating IFN- did not cross the blood brain barrier. the column indicated \u201c+ IFN-\u201d gives the mean upregulation (x-fold) of Apol9 expression observed in the presence of systemic IFN-. this corresponds to the ratio between the number of Apol9 cDNA copies detected in tissues of FVB/N mice electro-injected in the tibialis muscle with plasmid pcDNA3-IFN-6T. L929 cells were first transduced with lentiviral vectors pMK85 and pMK44 co-expressing Apol9a or Apol9b and mCherry. three days after transduction, cells were infected with the various GFP-expressing viruses. mCherry-positive cells were transduced with the same lentiviral vectors. mCherry-positive cells were sorted and cultured for 2 days before infection. mCherry-positive cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Titer of the TM944 GFP-expression lentiviral vector was adjusted to transduce about 30% of cells. values were pooled from three independent experiments performed each with triplicate infection samples. infection of cells with TMEV induced apoptosis. however, cells expressing Apol9 were slightly but significantly less sensitive to virus-induced apoptosis than control cells. this result excludes that ApoL9 may act by sensitizing infected cells to apoptosis. mCherry-positive cells were FACS sorted and subdivided in population of high (> 104) and low (4.103 to 104) mCherry fluorescence. luciferase activity was assayed at the indicated times post-transfection. results are representative of a typical experiment out of 3 performed in triplicate. TMEV replication To test whether ApoL9 acts on entry or on replication of TMEV, we used a TMEV replicon (TM973) expressing the firefly luciferase. luciferase activity was measured in L929 cells transduced with the empty pTM942 vector or with the pTM942 derivatives expressing ApoL9. bands 1 and 2 were identified as prohibitin 1 and -2 (Phb1 and Phb2) for both mouse and human cells. interaction between ApoL9b and PHBs was confirmed by detection of FL AG-ApoL9b and ApoL9b-FLAG. the experiment could, however, not be confirmed with endogenous ApoL9 proteins, given the lack of anti-ApoL9 antibodies. cell lysates were prepared from 293T cells transfected with the empty pTM943 vector. pTM943 derivatives expressing ApoL9b-FLAG or FLAG-ApoL9b. mCherry cells transduced to co-express mCherry and Apol9b or Apol9a. knocking down either Phb1 or Phb2 triggered a strong reduction in the amount of both Phb proteins. it is worth noting that PHBs knock down triggered a cell growth inhibition from about 5 days post-transduction. three days after the transduction of ApoL9-expressing cells with vectors expressing shRNA directed against PHBs or control vectors, cells were infected with the GFP-expressing KJ7 virus. viral replication (GFP) was examined in cells that were gated for expression of the indicated constructs (ApoL9-mCherry or shRNA-E2-Crimson) the infection efficiency in ApoL9-expressing cells was normalized to that measured in cells carrying the empty shRNA vector. histograms show mean and SD of the virus titers produced by PHB knocked down cells normalized to those produced by cells carrying the empty vector (n = 4 for MuHV-4; n = 8 for other viruses) stars denote significant differences as compared to the empty vector and NS non-significant differences. TMEV and virus yield were measured by plaque assay. this experiment failed to show the anti-viral effect of PHBs toward TMEV. the discrepancy between the highly reproducible negative effect exerted by PHBs against TMEV. N-terminally and C-terminally FLAG-tagged ApoL9b conserved the ability to exert an antiviral activity against TMEV in L929 cells. next, FLAG-tagged ApoL9b was detected by immunofluorescence in cells transduced with lentiviral constructs. we observed a diffuse cytoplasmic labeling and accumulation of ApoL9b as granule-like structures in part of the cells. ApoL9 proteins are not-secreted, cytoplasmic proteins. antiviral activity of N-terminally (FLAG-ApoL9b) and C-terminally (ApoL9b-FLAG) was taken as a secreted protein control. cells were mock-transfected, transfected with the empty pTM943 plasmid (vector) or with pTM943 derivatives coding for the indicated FLAG-tagged ApoL9 proteins. plasmid pcDNA3-IFNA-FLAG expresses the secreted FLAG-tagged mouse IFN-A. Apol9 expression increased with viral infection, in vivo, in many mouse tissues. time course of Apol9a and Apol9b gene induction was almost maximal from 6 hours post-treatment. this suggests that Apol9 expression is directly induced by type I IFN. mock-infected mice were mock-infected (n = 3) or infected intracerebrally with 106 PFU of the DA1 strain of TMEV. time course of Oasl2, Apol9a and Apol9b expression in L929 cells treated with 5 units/ml of IFN- (n = 3) Apol9a and Apol9b expression significantly inhibited infection by both persistent and neurovirulent TMEV strains but had little impact, if any, on the other tested viruses. mCherry-positive cells were sorted and cultured for 2 days before infection with the same lentiviral vectors. ApoL9 expression significantly reduced TMEV but not muHV-4 or VSV production. these data confirm the restricted virus range of ApoL9 antiviral activity against a restricted virus range. three days after transduction, cells were infected with the indicated GFP-expressing viruses. human ApoL6 was reported to induce apoptosis when overexpressed in cells. this domain is well conserved in other ApoL proteins including ApoL9. we tested whether ApoL9a and ApoL9b proteins could exert antiviral activity by sensitizing cells to apoptosis. luciferase activity produced by a TMEV-luciferase replicon (TM973) transfected in cells expressing mCherry fluorescence. luciferase activity normalized, for each construct, to the activity measured at two hours post-transfection. #BH3 refers to point mutations introduced in the putative BH3 domain. 50N and 50C refer to the deletion of the 50 N- and C-terminal amino acids respectively. oL9 restricts the replication of TMEV. we then generated L929 cells that overexpress ApoL9 mutants. mutations may have affected the ApoL9 conformation required for antiviral activity. TMEV L* protein used as negative control was not (Phb1) or weakly (Phb2) co-immunoprecipitated with prohibitins. the experiment could, however, not be confirmed with endogenous ApoL9 proteins. pTM943 derivatives expressing ApoL9b-FLAG or FLAG-ApoL9b. plasmid pMK86 expressing a N-terminally FLAG-tagged L* protein of TMEV. central and lower panels show FLAG detection after immunoprecipitation. L929 cells were transduced with the empty vector MK117 (vector) or with TM942 derivatives, MK85 and MK44, co-expressing mCherry and ApoL9a (light gray) or ApoL9b (dark gray) three days after transduction with the shRNA vectors, cells were infected for 8.5 hours with 0.25 PFU per cell of the GFP-expressing virus KJ7. 117 derivatives expressing E2-Crimson alone (vector) or co-expressing E2-Crimson and a shRNA targeting Phb1 (MK118) or Phb2 (MK120) were infected with GFP-expressing viruses: muHV-4, TMEV (KJ7 or KJ26), and VSV. knocking down of Phb2 also increased infection by TMEV in cells that did not overexpress Apol9. this suggests that this prohibitin has antiviral activity against TMEV. SGs are constitutively expressed in mouse tissues such as liver, pancreas, adipose tissue and intestine. expression of these genes can be further upregulated by type I IFN. other members of the Apol gene family are upregulated by type I and type II IFN. ApoL9 proteins may be secreted in a cell type-specific fashion. this protein inhibits the replication of a TMEV replicon that was transfected into cells. in part of the cells, ApoL9 formed granule-like structures. HBs association with apoL9 is not strictly required for ApoL9 antiviral activity. it is tempting to speculate that PHBs may act as chaperones to stimulate the antiviral activity of ApoL9. this is contrasting with the strong proviral effect observed for VSV."}
