{"summary": "rice rats were kept in a biocontainment facility for 1 y before being transferred to a conventional rodent housing room. sentinels (CD1 mice and CD rats), as well as randomly chosen rice rats, were euthanized and necropsied every 4 wk to monitor for the presence of pathogens. at least once every quarter, we surveyed for Mycoplasma pulmonis by serology and for fur mites and pinworms. superficial skin scrapes, perianal tape tests, and zinc sulfate fecal flotation preparations were examined microscopically for the presence of ecto and endoparasites in breeders and experimental animals. experimental groups were fed a standard rat chow diet (8604 Teklad Rodent Diet, Harlan, Tampa, FL) to accelerate the clinical occurrence of periodontitis or the standard rat chow. water bottles were replaced by an automatic watering system without incident. the housing room was maintained at 68 to 79 \u00b0F (20.0 to 26.1 \u00b0C) each rat was exposed gradually to CO2 at a flow rate of approximately 20%/min until death was verified by cessation of movement, absence of hind paw withdrawal reflex, and complete cessation of respiration. blood samples were collected by cardiocentesis using a 25-gauge needle attached to a 1-mL syringe. samples for serum biochemical analysis were tested inhouse in a serum chemistry analyzer. the following 10 parameters were measured: glucose, BUN, creatinine, total protein, total bilirubin, cholesterol, AST, ALT, ALP, and creatine kinase. rodents were kept in a biocontainment facility for 1 y before being transferred to a conventional rodent housing room. sentinels (CD1 mice and CD rats) were euthanized and necropsied every 4 wk to monitor for the presence of clinical disease, pathogens, or antibodies to infectious agents. euthanized rice rats were housed in static filter-top cages (area, 143 in2) with pine shavings as bedding. experimental groups were fed a standard rat chow diet (8604 Teklad Rodent Diet, Harlan, FL) and received water (in bottles) ad libitum. the housing room was maintained at 68 to 79 \u00b0F (20.0 to 26.1 \u00b0C) and under a 14:10-h light:dark cycle. experimental animals were weighed weekly by using a calibrated portable electronic scale. the needle was inserted caudal to the xiphoid cartilage and directed cranially toward the heart. percutaneous exsanguination was used to collect approximately 1 mL blood from each rat. samples were run inhouse on an automated hematology analyzer. rice rats eat a powdered H-SC diet from weaning,6,21,24,25,32,51. they develop periodontitis without intraoral mechanical manipulation. 4-wk-old rats were fed standard and H-SC diets for 0, 6, 12, and 18 wk. males and females engage in fights and physical interactions that can result in severe traumatic injuries and death. females are particularly aggressive during the peripartum period. females are particularly aggressive during the peripartum period. we used 5 to 54 breeder-pairs between 9 and 35 wk of age. to maintain breeders within the optimal age for breeding (2 to 8 mo), we bred 6 to 10 new pairs every 4 mo. dams gave birth to a total of 508 pups, representing an average of 5.24 pups/dam. 90% referent interval Hematology RBC (106/L) 7.32 5.00\u20139.31 5.92\u20138.96 Hgb (g/dL) 13.10 9.10\u201316.00 10.50 15.90 Hct (%) 52.30 38.20\u201365.10 42.00\u201362.40 MicroHct (%) 43.00 36.00\u201353.00 36.00\u201350.10 MCV (fL) 70.30 62.30\u201377.60 63.80\u201376.70 M rice rats were restrained for 1 to 2 min in a rat restrainer (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) rats were injected intravenously in the tail vein. the area of the tail to be used for IV injection was swabbed with cotton soaked in isopropyl alcohol. the needle then was moved slowly in a cranial direction. the rat was removed from the restraint and returned to its home cage. methylene-blue\u2013stained palatal surfaces of standard or high-sucrose and -casein (H-SC) diet rats for (A and B) 12 wk and (C and D) 18 wk show that rice rats present increased horizontal alveolar bone loss both over time and with H-SC diet feeding. rice rats fed standard or high-sucrose and -casein diets for 18 wk. Bacterial plaques (*) were present in both (A) the rats fed the standard diet and (B) those fed the H-SC diet. mild migration of the junctional epithelium (black arrow) and hyperplasia of the gingival epithelium (EH) also are present in this sample. rice rats can display very aggressive behavior during the peripartum period. males and females engage in fights and physical interactions. females are particularly aggressive during the peripartum period. dams gave birth to a total of 508 pups, representing an average of 5.24 pups/dam. dams gave birth to a total of 508 pups, corresponding to 4.24 pups/dam.

Bacterial plaques (*) were present in both (A) the rats fed the standard diet and (B) those fed the H-SC diet. mild migration of the junctional epithelium (black arrow), hyperplasia of the rice rats are one of several relevant rat models for human periodontitis that is suboptimal. rice rats develop signs of gingivitis, followed by periodontitis and alveolar bone loss. the onset of periodontitis can be accelerated to occur between ages 4 to 22 wk. rice rats fed diets high in sucrose can develop insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia,27,35 or hypertriglyceridemia and hypertension without obesity or changes in fasting plasma glucose and leptin levels. rice rats are genetically adapted to tightly control glucose metabolism under extreme conditions. this species requires investigator-directed collection, breeding, and rearing. rats would request healthy and clean rice rats for not-for-profit animal experimentation."}
