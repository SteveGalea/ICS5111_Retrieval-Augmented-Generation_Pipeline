{"summary": "chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and acute respiratory damage syndrome (ARDS) together represent the third largest killer after heart disease and cancer. COPD itself seems to be an enhanced inflammatory response to particles in pollutants and tobacco smoke. an array of exposures have been linking to pulmonary fibrosis, including asbestos, silica, certain chemotherapeutics, such as bleomycin, and radiation therapy for lung tumors. most cases of pulmonary fibrosis have no obvious causal link and are bundled together as IPF. approximately 50% of ARDS survivors show near-normal ranges of spirometry and oxymeter readings by 6\u201312 mo following resolution of the infectious triggering event. mice receiving intrastitial, murine-adapted influenza A virus show widespread infection of bronchiolar and alveolar cells within a few days followed by a broad inflammatory response and hemorrhagic edema. stem cells have the capacity to generate all airway cell types (ciliated, goblet, Clara, type I and type II pneumocytes\"17. the other extreme would hold that the local adult stem cells in histologically distinct regions of the airways would be committed to yielding cells consistent with the particular region. basal cells from murine trachea have been shown to repopulate denuded trachea or to proliferate as \u201ctracheospheres\u201d in vitro. the in vitro growth of immature epithelia, their differentiation to mature airway epithelium in long-term ALI cultures and subsequent lineage tracing in vivo of the progeny of keratin 5-expressing cells made it clear that the p63-expressing basal cells in the a population of tumor cells co-stained for CC-10 and SP-C, markers of Clara cells found in bronchioles and type II alveoli cells. similar CC-10/SP-C double-positive cells were found in the terminal bronchioles in normal tissue, where stem cells responsible for regenerating lung and bronchioles might be expected. c-Kit+ cells engraft in the damaged lung and assemble epithelial components of the bronchioles and alveoli, but also the vascular endothelium of the lung. these c-Kit+ cells displayed expression of the so-called Yamanaka factors, a set of transcription factors to wit Sox2, Klf4 and Oct3/4 typically found in embryonic stem cells. this work challenges the notion of adult stem cells and posits ARDS segregates 1:1 into those who succumb to the severe lung damage marked by diffuse alveolar damage and those who recover to pre-ARDS levels of pulmonary function. the influenza-induced ARDS was thus a model of lung regeneration that demanded the presence of a robust set of stem cells. p63 labels the basal cells of the upper airways implicated in the regeneration of ciliated cells and goblet cells in the upper airways. despite their abundance along the upper airway basement membrane, p63+ cells were rarely found in the bronchioles and never in the interstitial lung. however, there had never been reports of keratin 5 cells in any lung repair process. the p63+/Krt5+ pods were always found in proximity to bronchioles and always appeared in regions of lung parenchyma having immune cell infiltrates. the p63+/Krt5+ pods were always found in proximity to bronchioles and always appeared in regions of lung parenchyma having immune cell infiltrates. histochemistry reveals Krt5 pods in interstitial regions marked by less dense infiltrates. expression of antigen recognized by 1H8 monoclonal antibody in lung at 15 d post-influenza infection. this massive expansion of p63 cells in the bronchioles and their precipitous migration to sites of influenza-mediated lung damage. clones from infected mice showed a differential upregulation of genes linked to tissue repair. keratin 6 was one of these upregulated genes in the clones from infected mice. the expression of keratin 6 alone was enough to distinguish control clones from those isolated from infected lung. p63+/krt5+ cells migrated out of the bronchioles to sites of interstitial lung damage. initial results have highlighted several pathways, including those involving Hedgehog and the PPAR. it will require patience and new strategies to tease out which are the most significant and deliverable. significant efforts will also need to be devoted to identifying human stem cells for lung regeneration and how to marshal them. cloning rings were used to isolate single clones of respiratory stem cells. stem cells of the nasal, trachiobronchiolar and distal airways appeared identical. all showed strong expression of p63 in their nuclei and keratin 5 in their cytoplasm. ALI cultures, 3D Matrigel cultures or self-assembly assays were required to tease out the respective multipotency of these pedigrees. they showed that both the NESC and TASC pedigrees formed dense spheres of squamous cells akin to squamous cell metaplasia. the DASCs formed spheres of unilaminar arrays of cells not unlike alveoli. regiospecific stem cells are intrinsically committed to distinct fates even after multiple passaging in vitro. a separate issue is whether NESCs and TASCs are different or represent a single stem cell for the whole of the upper airways from the nasal epithelium to the bronchi. TASCs and DASCs colonies stained with anti-p63 appear indistinguishable and show gene expression differences in only 100\u2013300 genes of 17,000 hybridizing transcripts. TASCs and DASCs colonies stained with anti-p63 appear indistinguishable and show gene expression differences. the only viable direction here with acute lung damage is to identify secreted factors that normally alert these endogenous stem cells to proliferate, migrate to sites of damage or assemble alveoli and associated capillary networks. chronic conditions such as COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis present with defective but intact terminal bronchioles and alveoli further marred by scar tissue."}
