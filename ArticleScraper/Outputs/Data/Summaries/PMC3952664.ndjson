{"summary": "genetyping of rs12252 was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism using primers CAGGAAAAGGAAACTGTTGAGAGAACC(F) and CTCCTGGAGCCTCTCA(R) in standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions. all minor homozygotes and heterozygotes were sequenced in the reverse direction to confirm their genotype. none of the patients in the GAinS study was pregnant. only 2 of them had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 5 asthma. study recruited adult patients admitted to ICUs in the uk with community-acquired pneumonia or fecal peritonitis. none of the patients in the GAinS study was pregnant. none of the patients in the study was pregnant. us and 1 each with Staphylococcus hominis, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and respiratory syncytial virus were mechanically ventilated except for 1. GRACE [9] is a european-wide study of LRTI in primary care. rare homozygotes show an odds ratio of 23.38, with no association for heterozygotes compared with major homozygotes (odds ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval,.48\u20132.30). no association for heterozygotes compared with major homozygotes. b 0.049b 0.025b 0.150 Recessive model OR... 39.29 (8.567\u2013180.137) NA 23.38 (5.152\u2013106.132) 3.59 (1.008\u201312.79) 7.126 (1.283\u201339.58) 2.778 (1.283\u201339.58) 2.778 (1.283\u201339.58) no association was seen in rhinovirus or coronavirus specific analyses either. we found no association between rs12252 and bacterial LRTI. DISCUSSION Without directly genotyped controls and large sample sizes, it is not possible to fully define genetic associations. we found no evidence that this SNP is associated with mild bacterial infection. the association seemed to be specific for influenza susceptibility. population stratification analysis has not been performed for our samples."}
