{"summary": "the family Coronaviridae contains six human coronaviruses (HCoVs) 229E, NL63, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), OC43, HKU1 and EMC. both viruses cause severe disease in infected patients (1\u20136). the 229E-S-protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor in infected cells. it is activated by cathepsin L, a pH-dependent endosomal/lysosomal cysteine protease, upon viral uptake into target cells. but recent studies indicate that the type II transmembrane serine proteases HAT and TMPRSS2 can also activate SARS-S (30\u201332) TMPRSS2 and HAT cleave and activate 229E-S for cathepsin L-independent host cell entry. TMPRSS2 is expressed in viral target cells in the human respiratory epithelium and may thus promote viral spread in humans. expression plasmids encoding human proteases TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and HAT were published earlier (40, 41) previously described expression plasmids for IFITM-1, -2, and -3 (35) were used as templates for amplification of the respective coding regions. TMPRSS2 and HAT cotransfected 293T cells with expression plasmid for 229E-S (37) cells were either plasmids encoding the specified proteases or empty plasmid. at 48 h posttransfection, the cells were harvested in 1 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), treated with PBS or 250 g/ml tosylsulfonyl phenylalany the average cycle threshold value (CT) for each individual assay was calculated by means of the instrument's software in \u201cauto-CT\u201d mode. the average CT values calculated for TMPRSS2 or HAT were normalized through subtraction from the CT values obtained for GUSB (a housekeeping reference). cultivation, medium containing TPCK-trypsin (Sigma; final concentration, 100 ng/ml) was added and then replaced with fresh DMEM. at 72 h posttransfection, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured by employing a commercially available kit (Promega) a recombinant HCoV-229E strain expressing luciferase upon genome replication (HCoV-REN) was described previously. the cells were infected with HCoV-229E at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, incubated for 8 h at 33\u00b0C. after 48 h, fully differentiated HAE cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; FormaFix) for 30 min mice monoclonal anti-229E N (1E7) (49), sheep polyclonal anti-CD13 (R&D Systems) and rabbit polyclonal anti-TMPRSS2 (Abcam) were applied as primary antibodies. the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated mouse anti-tubulin (Cell Signaling) for staining of ciliated cells. fluorescence images were acquired using an EC Plan-Neofluor 40/1.30 oil differential interference contrast (DIC) M27 or Plan-Apochromat 63/1.40 oil DIC M27 objective on a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope. image capture, analysis, and processing were performed using ZEN 2010 software (Zeiss). expression plasmids for plasmid pcDNA-CD13 (39) were subcloned into pcDNA4.TO. previously described expression plasmids for IFITM-1, -2, and -3 (35) were used as templates for amplification. 293T cells were cotransfected with expression plasmid for 229E-S. cells were harvested in 1 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 48 h posttransfection. expression of -actin was detected by using an anti-actin antibody (Sigma) DNA samples (25 ng total RNA equivalents) were used for real-time PCR in an ABI 7500 Fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) the average cycle threshold value (CT) for each individual assay was calculated by means of the instrument's software in \u201cauto-CT\u201d mode. at 24 h posttransfection, effector cells were resuspended in fresh medium. medium containing TPCK-trypsin (Sigma; final concentration, 100 ng/ml) was added and replaced with fresh DMEM. at 72 h posttransfection, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured by employing a commercially available kit. target cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 30,000 cells/well. one day prior to infection, the cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 37\u00b0C. luciferase activities in cell lysates were determined at 72 h postinfection. fixed HAE cultures were immunostained using a previously described procedure (48) mice monoclonal anti-229E N (1E7) (49), sheep polyclonal anti-CD13 (R&D Systems) and rabbit polyclonal anti-TMPRSS2 (Abcam) were applied as primary antibodies. the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated mouse anti-tubulin (Cell Signaling) for staining of ciliated cells and then counterstained with DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Invitrogen) fluorescence images were acquired using an EC Plan-Neofluor 40/1.30 oil differential interference contrast (DIC) M27 or Plan-Apochromat 63/1.40 229E-S was expressed in the absence of cotransfected protease (pcDNA) a single band of approximately 160 kDa was detected upon expression of 229E-S in the absence of protease. a similar cleavage pattern was detected upon coexpression of 229E-S with TMPRSS2 and HAT. transfection of 293T target cells with a plasmid encoding either a protease or CD13 was sufficient to allow fusion with 293T effector cells transfected to express 229E-S. target and effector cells transfected with empty plasmid (pcDNA) served as negative controls. TMPRSS2 and HAT increase cell-cell fusion driven by the S-protein of HCoV-229E. effector 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with plasmids encoding either human CD13 or the indicated proteases or with empty plasmid. the endosomal/lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L can activate HCoV-229E for virus-cell fusion. expression of TMPRSS2 and HAT on target cells allows for 229E-S-driven entry in the absence of cathepsin L activity. TMPRSS2 and HAT allow for cathepsin L-independent host cell entry. the cells were seeded into 96-well plates, preincubated with PBS or the cathepsin L inhibitor MDL-28170 (10 M) and transduced with firefly luciferase-encoding lentiviral vectors bearing VSV-G or 229E-S. a representative experiment performed in triplicate is shown; error bars indicate SD. 293T-CD13 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding TMPRSS2, HAT, or no protease (pcDNA) the transfected cells were then incubated with MDL-28170, increasing amounts of camostat, or the indicated inhibitor combinations. leupeptin blocks the activity of several serine, threonine, and cysteine proteases, including cathepsin L (51). 293T cells stably expressing CD13 were transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated proteases or with empty plasmid (pcDNA) prior to infection, target cells were incubated with PBS, DMSO, or the indicated protease inhibitors. the results of a representative experiment performed in triplicate are shown; error bars indicate SD. treatment of Caco-2 cells with camostat or MDL-28170 had no impact on VSV-G-driven transduction. 229E-S-dependent transduction was dose-dependently blocked by camostat. TMPRSS2 expression partially rescues entry driven by the S-protein of HCoV-229E from inhibition by IFITM proteins. transduction mediated by 229E-S was inhibited by expression of all IFITM proteins tested. western blot analysis of transfected target cells showed dose-dependent expression of IFITM proteins. TMPRSS2 activates 229E-S for membrane fusion before IFITM proteins can exert their full antiviral activity. 293T-CD13 cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of expression plasmids encoding IFITM proteins. cell lysates were prepared after 48 h and analyzed by Western blotting. the infection efficiency was calculated as % infection based on the infectivity for pCAGGS-transfected target cells, which was set as 100%. TMPRSS2 expression on differentiated HAE cells colocalizes with CD13-expressing cells. in vitro distribution of TMPRSS2 expression (green) was analyzed in mock (A)- and HCoV-229E (B)-infected HAE cultures. cells were stained with antibodies directed against -tubulin IV (cilia; blue) TMPRSS4 can activate HCoV-229E for cell-cell but not virus-cell fusion. trypsin treatment of 229E-S-expressing cells served as a positive control. cleavage was analyzed by Western blotting. TMPRSS2 and HAT cleave the S-protein of HCoV-229E. an expression plasmid for 229E-S was transiently cotransfected into 293T cells. the cells were harvested and treated with PBS or TPCK-trypsin. detection of -actin served as a loading control. fusion with target cells produced TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 or HAT was within the background range measured upon transfection of empty plasmid. effector and target cells were mixed, and luciferase expression cassette. fusion cannot be rescued by expression of TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, or HAT. the results of a representative experiment performed in triplicate are shown; error bars indicate SD. the results were confirmed in two independent experiments. TMPRSS2 and HAT activate authentic HCoV-229E. fully rescued 229E-S-dependent transduction from inhibition by MDL-28170. no rescue was observed upon expression of TMPRSS4. TMPRSS2 and HAT allow for cathepsin L-independent host cell entry of HCoV-229E. an inhibitor of TMPRSS2 blocks 229E-S-driven entry into caco-2 cells. the observation that engineered expression of TMPRSS2 and HAT activates 229E-S for cathepsin L-independent host cell entry triggered the question of which proteolytic pathway is dominant in cells naturally susceptible to HCoV-229E infection. TMPRSS2-expressing cells were modestly reduced by camostat alone. leupeptin treatment alone reduced transduction, suggesting that leupeptin is active against HAT but not TMPRSS2. similar results were obtained in an independent experiment. luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured at 72 h postinfection. the results of a representative experiment performed in triplicate are shown. the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 robustly expresses endogenous TMPRSS2 but not HAT. IFITM proteins inhibit viral entry (34, 35, 54, 55), potentially by interfering with clathrin-mediated uptake or vacuolar ATPase activity (56). we transiently expressed IFITM-1, -2, and -3 in 293T-CD13 cells and transduced these cells with pseudotypes bearing 229E-S. TMPRSS2 partially rescues entry driven by the S-protein of HCoV-229E from inhibition by IFITM proteins. 293T-CD13 target cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of expression plasmids or empty plasmid (pCAGGS) and subsequently transduced with infectivity-normalized pseudotypes carrying the glycoproteins of HCoV-229E. nucleocapsid antigen was detected mainly in cells coexpressing TMPRSS2 and CD13 but not tubulin IV. expression of tubulin IV was reduced and largely confined to intracellular vesicles. TMPRSS2 expression on differentiated HAE cells colocalizes with CD13-expressing cells. TMPRSS2 expression was analyzed in conjunction with CD13 (red), -tubulin IV/cilia (cyan), and nuclei acids (blue) for the in vivo distribution in primary bronchial tissue, TMPRSS2 (green) expression was analyzed in conjunction with CD13 (red), -tubulin IV/cilia (cyan), and nuclei acids (blue) the sensitivity of 229E-S to cleavage by trypsin is in accord with published results. the sensitivity of 229E-S to cleavage by trypsin is in agreement with published results. 293T cells express a protease which can activate 229E-S for cell-cell fusion. it depends on the activity of a leupeptin-sensitive protease that is different from cathepsin L (60) the failure of HAT to cleave 229E-S into a 120-kDa fragment is thus compatible with 229E-S activation. only a few cell lines express robust amounts of endogenous TMPRSS2. activity of cathepsin L was dispensable for 229E-S-driven entry into Caco-2 cells. inhibition of cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 was required to fully suppress 229E-S-dependent transduction of Caco-2 cells. antiviral activity of IFITM proteins extends to HCoV-229E infection. coexpression of TMPRSS2 partially rescued 229E-S-driven transduction from inhibition by IFITM-1 to -3. protease activates 229E-S for membrane fusion before virions reach the late endosome. TMPRSS2 can activate HCoV-229E for pulmonary spread in humans. of the Tmprss2 gene in mice shows no phenotype in the absence of infection (61), the TMPRSS2 protease might constitute an attractive target for therapeutic intervention."}
