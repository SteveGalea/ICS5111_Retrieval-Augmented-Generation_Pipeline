{"summary": "EBV is classified as a -herpes virus and contains a linear DNA molecule about 172 kilo bases in length. it affects more than 90% of adult population worldwide. first exposure occurs via exchange of saliva or contact with the airborne virus. clinical symptoms of this condition include sore throat, fever, fatigue, malaise, vomiting and loss of appetite with common pathological lesions. BL is a tumor of the lymphatic system (specially B lymphocytes) the name was coined after denis Parsons Burkitt, who first described the disease in 1956 in equatorial africa. nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is the most common malignant tumor of the nasopharynx, worldwide, also known to be caused by EBV. it is more common in males than females and in the east Asians and Africans than other racial groups of people. the effectiveness of EBV-mediated CTL proliferation increased with the use of mitogens like phytohemagglutinin and lipopoly-saccharide [27], pokeweed mitogen [28] and some immunosuppressive drugs like the cyclosporine A. the cyclosporine A prevents the T cell-mediated cytotoxicity of EBV-infected B cells [29-31] EBNA2 was known to serve as a powerful LMP1 transactivator [40]. many previous studies have led to the well-established fact that EBV is responsible for tumorgenesis in both lymphoid and epithelial cells. in this review, we attempt to summarize the clinical outcomes and some epidemiological features associated with the different tumors induced by EBV in both lymphoid and epithelial cells. many research outputs have indicated that EBV is responsible for different human tumors of B cells origin such as Hodgkin's disease (HD) and lymphoproliferative disorders observed in immunosuppressed individuals. several copies of the circular EBV genome were detected in the tumor cells of all these malignancies. a series of repeated DNA sequence accounts for 0.5 kb as terminal repeats at the end of the linear genome observed in the nucleus of cells during latency of the virus in infected cells. a series of repeated DNA sequence accounts for 0.5 kb as terminal repeats at the end of the linear genome observed in the nucleus of cells during latency of the virus. two subtypes of the virus have been recognized. the first expressed proteins are the immediate early proteins which serve as transactivators that enhance the synthesis of the early and late proteins required for DNA replication and production of the progeny infectious virus. both lymphoid and epithelial cells can be infected by EBV through different attachment and entry mechanisms. the lytic replication of EBV in B cells is usually observed following reactivation of latent virus. in epithelial cells it has been observed to happen directly in primary infection after viral entry to the cell [60], 76. in vivo and in vitro infection of EBV leads to transformation and immortalization of B cells. in vivo transformation of B cells can be diagnostically confirmed through the immunofluorescence assay. in vivo transformation of B cells can be confirmed through the immunofluorescence assay. the latency programs adopted by the virus in B cells are different from those in epithelial cells and for each type of latency, a distinct set of viral proteins and transcripts will be produced. the latency III program starts with a considerable number of proteins expressed to cause cell transformation. the replication of EBV in epithelial cells is necessary for the release of infectious virus into saliva. latency program gene expressed occurrence EBERs EBNA1 LMP1 LMP2A EBNA3 0 + ND - + - - Memory B cells in peripheral blood I + + - - - - BL, PEL II + + + + - - PTLD IV ND - ND - PTLD BL, Burkitt lymphoma; PTLD, primary effusion lymphoma; PTLD, post-trans the issue of understanding EBV latency in infected cells and reactivation from latency is important for developing and establishing methods to prevent and pave the way for improved clinical management of these EBV-associated neoplasms. EBNA2 is reported as the central transcription factor for both viral and cellular genes expression and is responsible for B cell proliferation. EBNA-2 Activates viral and cellular gene transcription for transformation. it is critical for EBV-mediated B-cell transformation. EBNA-3C ates with EBNA-2 host CXCR4 and CXCL12 genes. BHRF1 miRNA and BART miRNAs interfere with apoptosis. some EBV strains possess more distinct biological properties compared to others. gene analysis for EBV-associated malignancies indicated the HIV co-infection is another potential factor regulating the incidence of the lymphomas. endmic cases were also found associated with chronic malaria and EBV infectivity. parotid gland tumors and the T-cell lymphomas have been found to develop with increased frequency among Greenland Eskimos and Taiwanese and Japanese respectively. the prevalence rates of NPC were particularly high in populations of Southeast Asia natives, the Arctic region, North African Arabs and some parts of the Middle East. risk factors for NPC development like cigarette smoking, exposure to formaldehyde and wood dust have been also recorded. environmental and immune components due to immune impairment are likely factors. sporadic BL has been reported to occur with an incidence rate of about 5- 10 cases per 100,000 children annually in equatorial and central Africa. higher incidences of this endemic form of BL were also for north africa, south America and the Middle East regions. endemic BL mostly includes obvious tumors in the mandible and maxilla. patients of BL are presented to the Gastroenterology clinics with abdominal pain, ascites, abdominal distension and signs of intestinal obstruction. BL has also been observed to occur as a consequence of immunodeficiency. endemic BL was known to be highly sensitive to chemotherapy. sporadic and immunodeficiency-associated BL are less sensitive. chemotherapeutic regimens were used in combination with rituximab (monoclonal antibody) the cause of HD was claimed to be EBV [136]. despite the fact that EBV was detected over the course of HD, cases of EBV-negative HD as a relapse of the previously EBV-positive HD lymphoma have been observed and reported. in the uk, EBV-related HD was more commonly observed among Hispanics and Asians than whites or African Americans populations. the most salient symptomatology of HD is the painless swelling in one or more lymph nodes especially those of the neck, underarm and the groin. the most salient symptomatology of HD is the painless swelling in one or more lymph nodes especially those of the neck, underarm and the groin. a combination of Brentuximab vedotin and Rituximab was also implemented to help the immune system kill lymphoma cells with some side effects encountered. radiation therapy to kill lymphoma cells had also been tried to shrink tumors and help control pain with better results obtained when combined with chemotherapy. the frequent occurrence of these PTLDs in the organ transplanted was explained by the fact that continuous and chronic antigenic stimulation in the graft tissues stimulates the development and pathogenesis of these lesions. chromosomal imbalances and genomic alterations in EBV positive PTLDs were detected in some studies and were proposed to play an important role in the development and progression of EBV induced-lymphoproliferations. the association of the EBV infectivity with the T-cells lymphomas was confirmed following the advent of more sensitive molecular biological techniques. that was confirmed following the advent of more sensitive molecular biological techniques which investigated the role of the EBV in the development of these T cell lymphomas. PTCL are the most frequently occurring among all types of T cell lymphomas. PTCL accounts for 10\u201315% of all non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in and known to involve mature T cells or NK cells. systemic lymphomas are usually present in lymph nodes, namely the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive and ALK negative lymphoma, based on the presence of the ALK protein on the surface of the malignant cell. as compared to the skin type, the systemic lymphomas are mostly fast growing. this lymphoma was the first malignancy known to be attributed to EBV. it was firstly observed in central africa and due to its strict correlation with malaria endemicity, it was suggested that an infectious organism might be involved. despite the fact that the EBV was detected in biopsies of some BL, some studies suggested that EBV is the major cause of BL. chromosomal translocations within B cells are the consistent genetic feature of all BL tumors. at the cellular level, chromosomal translocations within B cells are the consistent genetic feature of all BL tumors. at the cellular level, chromosomal translocations within B cells are the consistent genetic feature of all BL tumors. patients of BL are presented to the Gastroenterology clinics with abdominal pain, ascites, abdominal distension and signs of intestinal obstruction. BL has also been observed to occur as a consequence of immunodeficiency, mostly in people with HIV/AIDS infections. endemic BL was known to be highly sensitive to chemotherapy, but sporadic and immunodeficiency-associated BL are less sensitive. sporadic or immunodeficiency-related BL, low-intensity infused doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide with vincristine, prednisone and rituximab treatment was seen highly effective. the mainstay action for prevention of BL is the vaccine development for EBV and malaria, particularly where malaria is endemic. EBV-positives cases of HD were more commonly seen in older patients (above 55 years) and younger children (below 10 years) whereas in young adults it is mostly EBV-negative. this fact has led scientists to categorize HD into three disease forms based on the age group of patients. the most salient symptomatology of HD is the painless swelling in one or more lymph nodes especially those of the neck, underarm and the groin. some other patients have symptoms like fever, night sweats, fatigue, total body itching, weight loss, bone pain and increased susceptibility to infections. radiographic imaging such as CT scanning, MRI, or PET scanning may also be employed to determine the stage of HD. the majority of these PTLDs were confirmed as associated with EBV infectivity. however, they are more seen as T cell lymphomas than B cell tumors. common clinical presentations are often observed as diversified extranodal lesions such as those seen in the gastrointestinal tract. s were detected in some studies and proposed to play an important role in the development and progression of EBV induced-lymphoproliferations. there is an intimate association of EBV LMP1 deletion mutants with the PTLDs morphology, PTLDs clonality and EBV strain subtype. antiviral chemotherapy, cytokine therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, anti- B cells antibodies and local treatments have all been observed to successfully cure these conditions. most of the EBV-positive T cell lymphomas are extranodal and have a cytotoxic phenotypic features. this suggests that such types of lymphomas may occur as a result of EBV infection of CTLs during the killing action of EBV-infected cells. PTCL accounts for 10\u201315% of all non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in and known to involve mature T cells or NK cells. a particular subtype of PTCL known as the peripheral T-cell lymphomas non-otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) is the most commonly recognized subtype. PTCL-NOS usually shows extranodal lesions in the liver, spleen and bone marrow. etic tumors, 2008 edition, stated that ALCL is consistently negative for EBV, some studies have reported that a correlation between EBV and ALCL does exist. a case of ALCL in immunocompetent 35-year-old male using an in situ hybridization was also proved positive for EBER in the large neoplastic cells. it was also reported that the secretory component-mediated IgA transport was also proposed as a potential means for EBV infection of endothelial cells. the mechanism of cell to cell contact between virus releasing cells and non-infected epithelial cells for EBV entering and infection was also reported. gene alleles have reduced potential to present EBV antigen to immune cells. individuals with HLA alleles that present EBV efficiently may have a lower risk for NPC. EBNA2, EBNA3 and EBNA-LP were not expressed in NPC tumor cells. some malignancies with similar clinical features to NPC in sites like tonsils, lungs, skin, thymus, salivary glands, stomach, breast and uterine cervix were also observed. some studies' findings revealed more EBV-positive tumors in older people compared to children or young adults. EBV-positive GCs appear as tumors in the non antrum part of the stomach. it is unlike chronic gastritis and carcinoma attributed to Helicobacter pylori (Hp), which locates predominantly in the antrum of the stomach. this condition was confirmed to be due to EBV infectivity when the virus reactivated from latency because of immunosuppression. this tumor was reported as the most commonly HIV/AIDS associated condition and was known to occur in adults rather than children. this tumor was reported as the most commonly HIV/AIDS associated condition. infected cells have a farrago of mechanisms to escape the host immune responses. this includes shut down of the most immune responsive proteins via the lytic proteins which interfere with antigen processing and with expression of the MHC molecules in the infected cells. the development of the previously mentioned tumors has been attributed to some imbalances in the equilibrium between the inherent virus transforming properties and the host immune system. reactivation of the latent EBV comes as a consequence of immunosuppression and the reactivated virus may transform the infected cells. the genetic basis of tumorigenicity, including both EBV and cellular gene expression underlying cancer formation was also reviewed. EBNA1 is the protein required to bind the EBV genome to host chromosomes and thus allow the transfer of the viral DNA to the progeny cells. these malignancies develop despite strong immune responses to the virus but the virus adopt several strategies for immune evasion."}
