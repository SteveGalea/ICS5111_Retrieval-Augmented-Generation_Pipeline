{"summary": "phylogenetic analysis indicates that these three nematode viruses form a distinct clade of viruses that are distantly, but most closely related to viruses in the family Nodaviridae. the ability of these viruses to infect the genetically tractable model organisms Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae has been established. the most widely studied nodavirus is Flock house virus (FHV) the virus can infect host cells, including mammalian, insect, plant, and yeast cells. there is currently no experimental evidence that any of these three viruses generates a subgenomic transcript from the RNA1 genome segment. eukaryotic 1 ribosomal frameshift site typically consists of a \u2018slippery\u2019 heptanucleotide sequence fitting the consensus motif X_XXY_YYZ. the consensus motif is generally followed by a stimulatory element comprising a stable RNA secondary structure such as a pseudo-knot or stem-loop. the complete RNA1 segment was 3421 nt while the RNA2 segment was 2574 nt. standard gene prediction using AUG as a start codon suggested that the RNA2 encodes a putative capsid protein (nt 500 to 1261; 28 kDa) the largest possible ORF that could be generated by a non-AUG start in RNA2 is shown. green and red bars indicate where the peptide sequences were used to generate alpha and delta peptide derived antibodies. a single band migrating between 75 kDa and 100 kDa was detected in the infected C. elegans lysates. a single band migrating between 75 kDa and 100 kDa was clearly detected in the infected C. elegans lysates. de viruses demonstrated conservation of the slippery sequence and stem loop structure. le Blanc virus has the same slippery sequence as that of Orsay virus. Santeuil virus has a different shift-prone sequence G_GAA_AAC. alpha ORF codons upstream of shift site (orange) and delta ORF codons downstream of shift site (orange) the predicted RNA stemloop structure is highlighted with yellow. asterisks indicate conserve positions. peak fractions of Orsay virus protein (fractions 8\u201311) were found in a density range of 1.311 g/ml to 1.387 g/ml. for comparison, FHV virions have an average density of 1.351 g/ml. the predicted size of the alpha-ORF-encoded protein beginning with this Asn is 42.9 kDa, consistent with its migration in SDS-PAGE. we were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of the alpha\u2013delta fusion from the CsCl gradient purification to perform N-terminal sequencing. the MS/MS peptide sequencing spectrum definitively identified the peptide SNLGWGNVVR. the peptide sequence spanning the frameshift site is indicated in red. each charged peptide fragment m/z is shown on the peak. alpha\u2013delta fusion protein is present in highly purified virions. three serial iodixanol gradients were used to purify the Orsay virions to >95% purity based on SDS-PAGE coomassie blue staining. the fusion protein is likely assembled into the Orsay virions. electron microscopy of iodixanol gradient purified Orsay virus. the structure of purified Orsay virus is shown by negative staining electron microscopy. the complete RNA1 segment was 3421 nt while the RNA2 segment was 2574 nt. standard gene prediction using AUG as a start codon suggested that the RNA2 encodes a putative capsid protein (nt 500 to 1261; 28 kDa) the largest possible ORF that could be generated by a non-AUG start in RNA2 is shown. green and red bars indicate where the peptide sequences were used to generate alpha and delta peptide derived antibodies. a single band migrating between 75 kDa and 100 kDa was detected in the infected C. elegans lysates with capsid peptide derived antibodies. a single band migrating between 75 kDa and 100 kDa was clearly detected in the infected C. elegans lysates. three nematode viruses demonstrated conservation of the slippery sequence and stem loop structure. le Blanc virus has the same slippery sequence as that of Orsay virus. Santeuil virus has a different shift-prone sequence G_GAA_AAC. delta junction regions showed conservation of slippery sequence and stem loop sequence. spaces separate alpha ORF codons upstream of shift site (orange) and delta ORF codons downstream of the shift site. the peak fractions of Orsay virus protein (fractions 8\u201311) were found in a density range of 1.311 g/ml to 1.387 g/ml. for comparison, FHV virions have an average density of 1.351 g/ml. the predicted size of the alpha-ORF-encoded protein beginning with this Asn is 42.9 kDa, consistent with its migration in SDS-PAGE. we were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of the alpha\u2013delta fusion from the CsCl gradient purification to perform N-terminal sequencing. the MS/MS peptide sequencing spectrum definitively identified the peptide SNLGWGNVVR. the peptide sequence spanning the frameshift site is indicated in red. each charged peptide fragment m/z is shown on the peak. the alpha\u2013delta fusion protein is present in highly purified virions. three serial iodixanol gradients were used to purify the virions to >95% purity based on SDS-PAGE coomassie blue staining. this observation together with the CsCl density gradient results showed that the alpha\u2013delta fusion protein is likely assembled into the virions. electron microscopy of iodixanol gradient purified Orsay virus. the structure of purified Orsay virus is shown by negative staining electron microscopy. the scale bar represents 100 nm. nematode viruses range from 2.5 kb to 3.0 kb while nodaviruses have only 1.4 kb RNA2 segments. in the 3' half, we identified an ORF of unknown function, the delta ORF. this fusion protein co-sedimented with the peak virion fractions. delta domain may also have non-structural roles, as have been described for many viral capsid proteins. this protein may also play a role in antagonizing antiviral pathways in nematodes. a recent study found that the delta ORF alone can act as a suppressor of RNA silencing. NKNNT were defined as the N-terminal amino acids for both proteins. it appears likely that this region is translated as part of the capsid protein in all three nematode viruses. such a protein cannot be derived from an AUG translation initiation site. the exact mechanism and site of capsid protein initiation will be investigated in future work. we have demonstrated that the delta protein is translated as a fusion protein with alpha and that the fusion protein is most likely incorporated into virions. RNA secondary structure was predicted with Mfold (Zuker, 2003). antibodies Polyclonal antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with synthetic peptides. peptide sequence used for generating the Orsay virus delta derived antibody was QLGAFPREVSEDGY. the 20 ml of resuspended rde-1 C. elegans were added to the liquid culture. the flask was maintained at 160 rpm in a 20 \u00b0C shaking incubator for seven days. the growth of the infected C. elegans was monitored by checking a drop of the culture mixture under a stereomicroscope. pellet from each fraction was resuspended in 100 l of CsCl gradient buffer. 15 l of purified virus were mixed with 3 l of 6X protein loading buffer. protein lysates were loaded onto a 4\u201315% SDS-PAGE gel. the protein on the gel was electro-transferred to a PVDF membrane (Invitrogen cat. No.LC2007) at 65 V for 90 min. the PVDF membrane was stained by coomassie blue R250 staining. high salt buffer (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH7.8, 0.1% 2-Mercaptoethanol, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) in which high salt concentration can disrupt protein\u2013protein and/or protein\u2013vesicle charge interactions. 3 ml each of 25%, 32.5% and 40% of iodixanol in low salt buffer (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH7.8, 0.1% 2-Mercaptoethanol, 100 mM Na the 0.5 ml fractions were collected by dripping from the bottom of the gradient. iodixanol was removed by ultrafiltration. the virus was finally resuspended in buffer containing 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH7.8, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol. each sample was mixed with 6X SDS buffer and then boiled for 5 min. the PVDF membrane was then blocked with 5% skim milk in PBST (PBS with 0.3% Tween 20) for 1 h shaking at room temperature. orsay virus genome sequencing 5' RACE was performed by reverse transcription to synthesize viral cDNA. viral cDNA was purified by a Zymo column to remove primers and free nucleotides. PCR was then performed by an abridged anchored primer (AAP) and a viral gene specific primer (GSP) the peptide sequence used for generating the Orsay virus delta derived antibody was QLGAFPREVSEDGY. a 1.5 l overnight culture of Escherichia coli OP50 was pelleted and resuspended in 280 ml S-medium. culture supernatant was collected and cleared by centrifugation. pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of CsCl gradient buffer (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH7.8, 0.1% 2-Mercaptoethanol) protein lysates were loaded onto a 4\u201315% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-rad) the gel was stained by fresh coomassie blue R250 for 5 min and then destained for 40 min with buffer containing 40% acetic acid and 10% methanol. the protein band corresponded to the suspected viral fusion protein as detected by Western blot. 1.2 l of Orsay virus liquid culture supernatant was cleared and collected. the culture supernatant was then treated with 1% triton X-100. the virus pellet was then resuspended in iodixanol gradient buffer overnight. iodixanol was centrifuged at 34,900 rpm for 3 h (SW41Ti rotor, Beckman coulter) the 1 ml fractions were collected and spun through a 30 kDa ultrafiltration column to remove iodixanol. the ultrafiltered virus was then treated again with 1% detergent Triton X-100 for 1 h. l droplet of 1.67 mg/ml virus was allowed to absorb onto formvar/carbon-coated copper grids (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA) for 10 min. grids were then washed in distilled H2O and stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate. excess liquid was gently wicked off and grids were allowed to air dry. horseradish perioxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Thermo Scientific) was used at a dilution of 1:10,000 (0.04 g/ml) protein bands were developed by using a chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific)"}
