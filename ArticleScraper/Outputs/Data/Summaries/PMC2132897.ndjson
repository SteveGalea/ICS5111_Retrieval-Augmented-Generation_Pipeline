{"summary": "cells, Viruses, Antibodies, and Plasmids HeLa and BSC40 cells were grown as previously described. the WR strain of vaccinia virus was propagated as described (11) the vv recombinant expressing the MHV-M protein, as well as the COOH and NH2 terminus-specific antibodies to the M protein were described before (51). the cells were infected with a MOI of 10 for 60 min at 37\u00b0C. they were then incubated overnight in the presence or absence of 100 g/ml rifampicin (Sigma; from a 100 mg/ml stock in DMSO kept at 20\u00b0C) the cells were put on ice, washed twice with ice-cold PBS and once with PBS containing 20 mM N-ethyl maleimide. [3H]NEM Labeling To 10 l of a purified virus preparation (with a protein concentration of 2 mg/ml or 30 OD260/ml; 26) diluted in 165 l of 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 9, 10 Ci of [3H]NEM (Amersham) was added and the mixture incubated on ice for 20 min. pelleted virus was resuspended in 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 9, without NEM. 3 and 8 g of total protein were labeled with 5 Ci of [3H]NEM as above. equal amounts of virus as used for the [3H]NEM labeling were analyzed in 15% SDS-PAGE. supernatant and pellet were analyzed in 10% SDS-PAGE. aprotinin was added to a final concentration of 0.4 g/ml. the cells were broken by 10 strokes in a dounce homogenizer in 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 9. the virus pelleted by centrifugation of 30 min at 24 krpm in a SW40 rotor. the pellet was resuspended in 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 9. the percentage of infected cells was calculated as follows: of each fixed coverslip 50 cells were counted. they were considered positive by immunofluorescence if anti-core antibody labeled perinuclear structures typical of viral factories. the cells were gently squirted off the dishes and collected by centrifugation for 30 s at 6,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge. the cells were resuspended in 300 l 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 9, containing aprotinin. the nuclei were removed and the proteins concentrated by acetone precipitation overnight at 20\u00b0C. 10 l of glutathione-reductase (Boehringer) was diluted 1:10 just before use in phosphate buffer/EDTA. as a standard, a known concentration of GSSG was used. to determine the GSSG concentration only, PNS of infected or uninfected cells was prepared after pretreating the cells with 10 mM NEM. dimers of p16 and p16 appeared to form disulfide-bonded dimers. they occurred in monomer and dimer forms under nonreducing conditions. p32 no more than 30% of the protein was in the dimer form. vv core proteins 4a (A10L), p39 (A4L), and p25 (L4R) were analyzed as described in A. only their precursor form can be detected that is cleaved to the 65- and 25-kD mature forms, respectively, in the IMV. some of the uncleaved form can however, still be detected in the isolated virions. three vv membrane proteins form disulfide bonded dimers in the mature IMV. the core proteins 4a, p25, and p39 occurred only in their reduced form when the IMV formation was blocked. the faster migration of the unreduced versus the reduced protein is typical for intramolecular disulfide bonding. 4a migrated predominantly in its (reduced) mature form of 65 kD. the 130 kD band was clearly absent. the upper one represents the uncleaved precursor, p4a. isolated and purified IMVs were labeled with [3H]NEM for 20 min on ice and the labeled protein pattern compared with [35S]methionine-labeled virions. the [3H]NEM labeling showed a discrete pattern of bands, the most abundant of which comigrated with the core proteins 4a, p11, and p25. infected cells were labeled for 3 d with [35S]methionine and the labeled virions isolated and purified (35S) 35S-labeled virions were disrupted by incubation for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with 1% SDS. from these lysed particles the protein 4a (4a), p25 (p25) and p11 (p11) were immunoprecipitated. analysis was on 15% SDS-PAGE infected cells were incubated with or without 20 mM NEM on ice before lysis. virions were concentrated from it by pelleting through a sucrose cushion. the pelleted viruses were then resuspended in NEM-free buffer. infected cells were pulse-labeled at 6 h after infection and chased for 4 h. small amounts of the dimer of p16 were first detected after 60 min. at 4 h of chase 50% of p16 was in the dimer form. the dimer is a N-glycosylated form of p16 that will be described elsewhere. this protein spans the membrane twice and appears to adopt two different orientations in the membrane. p16 may adopt two different topologies in infected cells. a fraction of p16 exposes the COOH terminus towards the cytoplasm. second, since p16 is also partially N-glycosylated, its COOH terminus must also be exposed towards the lumen. a recently developed assay to quantitate the two different topologies of p16 in infected cells. the digested virion was completely devoid of immunoreactive p32 protein. p14 was digested even at the lowest protease concentration tested. the unglycosylated (M0) and glycosylated forms (M3 and M4) of the MHV-M protein are indicated. in a second set of experiments, post-nuclear supernatants of infected cells that were treated with rifampicin were digested with trypsin. the membranes were pelleted and the digestion of p32 followed by Western blots. 5 mM DTT IMVs Are Formed That Are Less Stable To address the possible function of disulfide bonds in the IMV, it was necessary to reversibly inhibit their formation in infected cells. the addition of 5 mM DTT to living cells keeps newly synthesized membrane proteins reduced but also reduces already oxidized proteins residing in the ER (2). compared with the control cells, IVs and intermediates (53) appeared totally normal. none of these aberrant particles with detaching membranes or naked cores could be detected in the untreated control cells. in the presence of DTT apparently normal looking IMVs are formed but in some of them the viral membranes detach from the underlying core. in some cases the viral membranes detach from the underlying core. infected cells were left untreated or treated with DTT from 4 h after infection onwards with 5 mM DTT. p4a of 110 kD was efficiently cleaved into its 65-kD mature form (4a) during the chase. however, the overall synthesis of 4a was reduced by 40% in the presence of DTT. at 5 h after infection the cells were starved in methionine-free DMEM. at 5.5 h after infection the cells were starved in the same medium containing 50 Ci of [35S]methionine with or without DTT. at the end of the pulse or chase cell lysates were prepared. infected cells were left untreated or were treated with DTT from 4 until 9 h after infection. after virus isolation the disulfide bonding of selected membrane and core proteins was analysed. the core proteins 4a, p25 as well as the membrane proteins p21 and p16 migrated in their reduced form only in particles isolated from DTT-treated cells. in intact IMVs this protein is located on the inner of the two cisternal membranes. antibody labels fragments that are still attached to the particles isolated from untreated cells. the particles were absorbed to 300 mesh formvar and carbon-coated grids. the average of three independent experiments showed clearly that the IMV isolated from DTT-treated cells had a title that was 10-fold reduced relative to virus isolated from control cells. we have shown before in several studies that purified IMV is treated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with 20 mM DTT, the membranes separate in part from the core (see 8, 50, 54). Structurally, this in vitro treatment is very similar to what we observed with the virions isolated from DTT-treated cells. the extent of infection was assayed by double indirect immunofluorescence. the cytoplasm of all cells were labeled for both DNA as well as the anti-core antibody when using virus from untreated cells. however, when similar amounts of infectious units were used of virus from DTT-treated cells, even at the highest MOI the amount of cells showing DNA replication was significantly reduced. fixed cells were labeled with a rabbit antibody to the viral core proteins. with donkey anti-rabbit coupled to FITC, indirect immunofluorescence.
