{"summary": "isolation facilities in 16 countries were recruited by the european network for Highly Infectious Diseases. the study presented was set up to compare the operational management, resources, and technical equipment among European isolation facilities. the study was set up to compare the operational management, resources, and technical equipment among European isolation facilities. bacterial infections that (i) are easily transmissible from person to person; (ii) pose a life-threatening clinical illness with no or few treatment options; and (iii) pose a threat for both health care workers and the public. despite such efforts, no pooled data on isolation facilities resources, such as infrastructure design, technical equipment, capacity and access to intensive care, do exist. the objective of this article is to present data about infrastructure design and resources, technical equipment, available personnel, and access to intensive care. the checklists underwent a pilot application to identify structural gaps and sources of misinterpretation, but no external validation process was conducted. participants Until November 2009, the Coordination Team collected data on eligible isolation facilities to be included into the survey. participants were asked to identify clinical facilities responsible for the admission, assessment, and care of HID patients in their country. role of the funding source EuroNHID was co-funded by the European Commission/Director General for Consumers and Health. the checklists underwent a pilot application to identify structural gaps. the facilities of the Steering Committee members and one external facility applied the checklists and cross-checked all itmes for their applicability. the checklists were disseminated to all eligible facilities until December 2009. the median feedback rate for checklist 1 was 97.9% (n = 47/48), with a range from n = 7/48 (14.6%) to n = 48/48 (100%) of centres providing valid answers to specific questions. the number of isolation beds per facility ranges from 0.05 to 17.9 per one million inhabitants. the majority of all facilities uses their beds on a daily basis for routine patients (n = 37/48; 77,1%), while the rest provide bed capacities reserved for HID cases, only (n = 11/48, 22.9%). only eight (16.7%) of all facilities evaluated lacked any experience in the management of suspected or proven HID cases. at least 3 additional technical requirements are found in the majority of facilities (n = 34/48; 70.8%) most often an internal communication system (n = 43/48; 89.6%) and negative pressure indicators (n = 40/48; 83.3%) were present, while an exclusive evacuation pathway was missing. out of forty-five facilities reporting intensive care provision, one lacks a mechanical ventilator. one (2.2%) lacks a mechanical ventilator and three (6.7%) have no ability to monitor their ventilation therapy. personnel Almost all facilities report permanent access to specifically trained infectious diseases doctors. recruitment closed by the end of 2009 with the exception of Norway. data collected from all existing facilities in participating countries except for Spain. median feedback rate for checklist 1 was 97.9% (n = 47/48) most facilities have designated rooms (n = 23/48; 85.4%) or wards (n = 18/48; 37.5%) located within other hospital structures. most facilities have experience with infections due to SARS (n = 13/48; 27.8%), and viral haemorrhagic fevers (n = 9/48; 18.8%). all but five facilities enrolled (n = 43/48; 89.6%) provide negative pressure in the isolation area. majority (n = 34/48; 70.8%) is also equipped with all other essential equipment investigated. most of enrolled facilities provide negative pressure in isolation area. mechanical ventilators are available either permanently in twelve (25%) or on call in thirty-two facilities (66.7%), but not accessible at all in four (8.3%). forty-two facilities (87.5%) have either permanent or on-call access to blood gas analyzers, whereas six have not (12.5%). isolation facilities were evaluated for their adherence to published recommendations. a shift plan exists in 70.8% of facilities (n = 34/48) permanent access to technicians was lacking in eleven facilities (n = 11/48; 22.9%) five are located in france, Greece, and Spain; two in germany; and one in Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland and Slovenia. the remaining facilities (n = 5/48; 10.4%) are considered to function as \u2018Referral Centers\u2019 where suspected HID cases can be assessed within daily routine. half of all countries assessed have at least one HLIU according to the recommendations [1]. the high rate of incompliance with the recommendations can be explained by the absence of legally binding documents by the time most facilities were constructed. only few countries (e.g. the UK) had specific guidelines at hand, but the vast majority were constructed using laboratory- or operational theatre guidelines adapted to local needs and infrastructure prerequisites. a balance between infection control excellence and operational feasibility should be sought. the overall investment for an isolation facility, and HLIUs in particular, is high in terms of costs for construction and maintenance, medical and infection control equipment. specialized isolation facilities, and HLIUs in particular, represent a critical infrastructure to which each EU Member state should have access. financial constraints within hospitals and the host country may benefit from a routine-use concept, although such facilities demand more frequent maintenence due to damage on technical equipment."}
