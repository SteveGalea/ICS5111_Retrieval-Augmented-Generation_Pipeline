{"summary": "influenza epidemics and pandemics caused by influenza A virus (IAV) occur frequently. the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century emerged in 2009, with novel swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) H1N1 as the causative agent. it rapidly spread to North America and then globally [1]\u2013[4] the cross-protective immunity of these vaccines is fundamentally restricted, highly limiting their potential use against divergent H5N1 viruses. this may be achieved by upgrading vaccine formulas with effective adjuvants for either inactivated or live-attenuated IAV vaccines [15], designing novel vaccine components that rely on conserved sequences or universal epitopes of viral proteins [18], or updating vaccine delivery systems [18], or combining viral proteins with other components [19]. two recombinant influenza vaccines based on the recombinant proteins encoding HA1 of a H5N1 virus fused to either Fc of pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc2 (human IgG Fc), or Fd plus Fc. the developed vaccine candidates were shown to induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies that protected vaccinated mice against lethal challenge of all tested strains of H5N1 virus. a clear band was observed in samples of HA1-Fc and HA1-Fdc proteins analyzed by SDS-PAGE. the purified recombinant proteins of HA1 could be recognized by the HA-specific mAb. the recombinant proteins of HA1 could be recognized by the HA-specific mAb. expression of HA1-Fc and HA1-Fdc proteins was performed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining (A) and Western blot (B) using a HA-specific mAb. both proteins induced strong antibody responses to the Homogenous HA1 Proteins and an inactivated Heterologous virus. no IgG antibody response was detected in the sera of control mice injected with PBS. no IgG1 or IgG2a antibody response was detected in the sera of control mice. ability of IgG1 (A) and IgG2a (B) antibodies binds to the HA1 protein was detected using sera from 10 days post-last vaccination. the data are presented as mean A450SD of five mice per group at various dilution points. Z/406H reached the highest titer of 18.51023.7102 against SZ/406H H5N1 virus. neutralizing antibodies induced by HA1-Fdc protein were greater than those induced by HA1-Fc protein. contrast, PBS control group only elicited a background level of neutralizing and HI antibody titers in the tested H5N1 pseudoviruses. HA1-Fc- and HA1-Fdc-vaccinated mice were challenged with 10 50% lethal dose (10 LD50) of the above three. the data are presented as mean 50% neutralizing antibody titer (NT50) SD from five mice per group. all vaccinated mice survived challenge with HK/156 and SZ/406H. recombinant protein-based vaccines may completely protect mice against challenges with clade 0 and 2.3.4 strains of H5N1 virus. about 10% of HA1-Fc-vaccinated mice did not survive from challenge with this virus. viral RNA was undetectable in the HA1-Fc- and HA1-Fdc-vaccinated mice challenged with VN/1194 virus. a high level of viral RNA was detected in the control mice injected with PBS. a high level of viral RNA (8.61087.4108 copies/lung tissues) was detected. mice receiving HA1-Fc and HA1-Fdc vaccines only presented slightly broadened interstitial spaces with little lymphocyte infiltration after challenge with all H5N1 viruses covering three different clades. oli collapse, predominant lymphocyte infiltration, epithelial cell degeneration, pulmonary vascular dilatation and congestion, and focal hemorrhage and exudation. HA1-Fc and HA1-Fdc will be expressed in transfected 293T cells. both proteins maintained a high level of expression, with approximately 10 mg obtained in 250 ml culture medium. reactivity was determined using a HA-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) HA1-Fc (B) and HA1-Fdc proteins (C) were constructed by fusing Fd sequence to the C-terminus of HA1 followed by insertion into the Fc vector. the expression of HA1-Fc and HA1-Fdc proteins were performed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining (A), and Western blot (B) using a HA-specific mAb. sera of mice vaccinated with fusion proteins, particularly HA1-Fdc, reacted strongly with this HA1 protein, reaching an end-point titer of 11.3107. no IgG antibody response was detectable in the sera of control mice injected with PBS. both HA1-Fc and HA1-Fdc elicited similar levels of IgG1 (Th2-associated, Fig. 4A) and IgG2a (Th1-associated, Fig. 4B) antibody responses specific to the HA1 proteins. no IgG1 or IgG2a antibody response was found in the sera of PBS control mice. HA1-Fc and HA1-Fdc were able to induce highly potent neutralizing antibody responses in the vaccinated mice. neutralizing antibodies induced by HA1-Fdc protein were greater than those induced by HA1-Fc protein, showing a significantly higher level of inhibition to infections of 1194-HA, QH-HA, and AH-HA H5N1 pseudoviruses. Qinghai/59/05 Pseudovirus Heterologous 2.2 No XJ-HA A/Xinjiang/1/2005 Pseudovirus Homologous 2.3 No HK/156 A/Hong Kong/156/97 Live virus Heterologous 0 High VN/1194 A/VietNam/1194/2004 Live virus Heterologous. the HI titers were determined as the highest serum dilution. the HI titers are expressed as mean SD of five mice per group. vaccinated mice were challenged with 10 50% lethal dose (10 LD50) of the above three live viruses 10\u201312 days post-last vaccination. groups of 10 mice were observed for survival for 21 days post-virus challenge. survival rate (%) of mice challenged with HK/156 (A), VN/1194 (B) and SZ/406H (C) H5N1 virus was shown. a high level of viral RNA was detected in the control mice injected with PBS. mice vaccinated with HA1-Fc and HA1-Fdc were used as the negative control. the data are expressed as mean SD of RNA copies per lung tissues from five mice per group. all of the control mice injected with PBS developed a high degree of histopathological damage. HA of H5N1 virus serves as an important target for induction of specific antibodies with neutralizing activity. HA-based vaccines have been shown to elicit higher titers of neutralizing antibodies to prevent influenza virus infection in tested animals [14], [18], [34]. current influenza vaccines have failed to provide sufficient protection against rapidly mutated influenza viruses. immunized mice against challenges of at least three heterogeneous strains of H5N1 viruses. in addition to Fc, another component, Fd, could also be considered as a fusion partner to help increasing immunogenicity of recombinant vaccines. this is because that Fd, a trimeric motif, can maintain the native trimeric conformation of viral envelope proteins. the study of animals was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. all experimental protocols followed the standard operating procedures of the approved biosafety level-3 animal facilities and were approved by the Committee on the use of live animals in teaching and research. the recombinant HA1-Fc and HA1-Fdc proteins in the supernatant were purified by protein A affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) the purified proteins (10 g) were separated by 10\u201320% Tricine gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. control mice were s.c. injected with the same volume of PBS-SAS. sera were collected before immunization and 10 days post-each vaccination. infected mice were observed daily for 21 days or until death. at 450 nm (A450) was measured by ELISA plate reader (Tecan, San Jose, CA) the titer of neutralizing antibodies was detected in mouse sera by H5N1 pseudovirus neutralization assay. 293T cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 genome (pNL4-3.luc.RE) HI antibody titers were expressed as the highest serum dilution that completely inhibited hemagglutinating activity. dilutions of mouse sera were incubated with equal volumes of HK/156, VN/1194 and SZ/406H H5N1 virus, respectively, for 1 h at room temperature. the pcDNA3.1 plasmid, which contains the cloned H1 gene of the virus, was applied as the standard. histopathological analysis The lung tissues of challenged mice were immediately fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. sections 4\u20136 m in thickness were made and mounted on slides. the recombinant HA1-Fc and HA1-Fdc proteins were transfected into 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) seeded 24 h prior to transfection. the recombinant plasmids were transfected into 293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) mice were subcutaneously (s.c.) primed-vaccinated with 20 g/mouse of purified HA1-Fc and HA1-Fdc proteins re-suspended in PBS. mice were boosted twice with 10 g/mouse of immunogen containing SAS at 3-week intervals. serially diluted mouse sera were added to the plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. bound antibodies were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, IgG1 (Invitrogen) and IgG2a (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the reaction was visualized by substrate 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TM fresh medium was added 24 h later, followed by lysing cells 72 h later. luciferase substrate (Promega) was added to the plates and relative luciferase activity was determined in an Ultra 384 luminometer (Tecan) the neutralization of HA pseudovirus was calculated [43] and presented as NT50. viral RNA copies in lysed lung tissues were quantified by Q-RT-PCR as previously described. total RNA in lysed lung tissues was extracted by using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and reverse-transcribed to cDNA by using applied Superscript RT II (invitrogen) P values less than 0.05 were considered significant."}
