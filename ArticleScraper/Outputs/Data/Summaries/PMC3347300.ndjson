{"summary": "the reoviridae are a family of nonenveloped double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses that include reoviruses of clinical importance, such as rotaviruses in humans and orbiviruses in animals. the diseases induced by the reoviruses are acute, showing high prevalence with variable degrees of severity and mortality. hematopoietic cells, including both cDCs and plasmacytoid DCs, play a key role in type I IFN production during orthoreovirus infection (34). cytosolic DexD/H-box helicases linked to MyD88 can also be involved in viral DNA recognition in pDCs (36). the role of pDCs in innate cytokine production in response to dsRNA virus infection is not known. in sheep, pDCs are rare cells found in blood (0.5%), and circulate in skin lymph (52). pDCs are rare cells found in blood (0.5%), and they circulate in skin lymph (52). ml streptomycin was used for baby hamster kidney-21 (BHK21) culture. ml streptomycin was supplemented with 5% FCS, 1.5 mM l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin. strain RSArrrr/01 was produced by Onderstepoort Biological Products in the Republic of South Africa. for purified BTV1, virus particles were purified on sucrose gradients. low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin [Lovenox], Sanofi-Aventis) was injected intradermally into the shoulder skin every 12 h.

LD lymph cells, LD PBMCs, cDCs, and pDCs were incubated. in supernatants, cells were cultured overnight with BTV. for detection of intracellular NS2 and surface CD80/86 expression, cells were incubated for 48 h with BTV. pDCs were incubated with 0.06 TCID50 BTV8/cell for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. pDCs were selected from LD lymph cells using immunomagnetic cell selection as described before (52) for pDC staining and/or sorting by flow cytometry, LD PBMCs were saturated for 20 min on ice in FACS medium. cells were washed in FACS medium and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution. LD PBMCs were first labeled at 4\u00b0C with the anti-CD45RB IgG1 MAb (2 g/ml), followed by a saturating concentration (50 g/ml) of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-donkey Fab anti-mouse IgG. cells were incubated with the second IgG1 primary MAb. cell viability was determined by staining nonviable cells with 7-amino actinomycin D (7-AAD; 2 g/ml) flow cytometry analysis was performed to measure the percentage of surviving (7-AAD-negative) cells. total RNA was extracted using the Arcturus PicoPure RNA isolation kit (Arcturus) to exclude DNA contamination, RNA samples were treated with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) cDNA was prepared using SuperScript III RT (Invitrogen) RNA detection was done using a commercial pan-BTV real-time RT-PCR (Adiavet BTV real-time A352; Adiagene, France) targeting segment 10 of BTV, which is highly conserved among BTV serotypes. replicates and statistics could not be done within an experiment. Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% FCS, 1.5 mM l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were used for poly(IC) transfection. 2-Aminopurine (2-AP), chloroquine, and bafilomycin A1 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich the south African reference strain of BTV1 was purified on sucrose gradients as previously described by Mertens et al. (46). the strain is held in the Institute for animal health (IAH, United Kingdom) reference collection. it is identified by strain number RSArrrr/01. weight heparin (enoxaparin [Lovenox], Sanofi-Aventis) was injected intradermally into the shoulder skin every 12 h. heparin was collected twice a day in flasks containing 500 IU heparin, 10,000 IU penicillin, and 10 mg streptomycin. the sheep were terminated at the end of the experiment. LD lymph cells, LD PBMCs, cDCs, and pDCs were incubated at 37\u00b0C. pDCs were incubated with 0.06 TCID50 BTV8/cell for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were lysed either right away or after 48 h of culture for RNA extraction. formol-inactivated influenzavirus was used at a 4-g/ml dose. LD PBMCs were saturated for 20 min on ice in FACS medium. surface staining was performed using primary antibodies (2 g/ml) against B cells (DU2-104 clone, IgM), CD8 cells (7C2 clone, IgG2a), TCR/ (T cell receptor gamma/delta) cells (CC15 clone, IgG2a), CD11b cells (ILA-130 clone, \u00b0C with the anti-CD45RB IgG1 MAb (2 g/ml), followed by a saturating concentration (50 g/ml) of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-donkey Fab anti-mouse IgG. cells were incubated with the second IgG1 primary MAb (i.e., anti-CD11c [OM1 clone] or anti-CD80 [ILA- cell viability was determined by staining nonviable cells with 7-amino actinomycin D (7-AAD; 2 g/ml) flow cytometry analysis was performed to measure the percentage of surviving (7-AAD-negative) cells. total RNA was extracted using the Arcturus PicoPure RNA isolation kit (Arcturus) to exclude DNA contamination, RNA samples were treated with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) cDNA was prepared using SuperScript III RT (Invitrogen) statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software. RESULTS Administration of BTV in sheep induces IFN-/ in afferent skin lymph and in blood. we also found circulating IFN-/ in the blood of sheep inoculated with BTV8 at days 2 and 6 postinjection. the viral load in blood peaked at day 6 (around 106 viral RNA copies/ml) the viral load in blood peaked at day 6 (around 106 viral RNA copies/ml) and was decreased by 10-fold at day 10. the amount of IFN-/ in the cell supernatant varied among animals. wild-type BTV2, BTV8, BTV1 and a-BTV2 each triggered IFN-/ production by LD PBMCs, with no significant differences between strains. in sheep lymph, cDCs are CD11c+ cells and pDCs are characterized as B CD11c CD45RB+ cells. no IFN-/ could be detected in response to a-BTV2 in the lymph CD11c+ cell fraction. substantial amounts were found in the CD11c cell fraction (500 IU/ml) we separated the CD45R RBhigh B CD11b TCR/ CD8 CD11c cells into small-, intermediate-, and large-sized cells based on the forward scatter (FSC) profile. only fraction 1 (FSChigh cells) produced IFN-/ in response to CpG. pDCs from lymph (A to C) and blood (D and E) are the main hematopoetic cell type producing IFN-/ in response to BTV in vitro. CD11c+ and CD11c cells were sorted from LD lymph cells with magnetic-activated cell sorting. RB+ and CD45RB cells from LD PBMCs (1.5 106 cells/ml) were cultured overnight with BTV8 (0.06 TCID50/cell) or CpG-A (10 g/ml) IFN-/ was determined in supernatants using a bioassay. each experiment was repeated at least one or two times. accumulation of viral RNA was detected after 48 h of culture. after 20 min of UV irradiation of the viral inoculum (UV-BTV) viral replication could not be detected in LD lymph cells. however, IFN-/ was still found to be produced in the supernatant of LD lymph cells. the B+ CD8+ TCR/+ CD11b+ CD11c+ cells were gate excluded. the CD45RB+ FSChigh cells were analyzed for NS2 expression. NS2-specific expression was controlled with nonimmune rabbit serum (control) the experiment was reproduced 3 times with similar results. expression of NS3-BTV RNA relative to that of GAPDH was determined. we successfully purified BTV1 by sucrose gradient centrifugation (46) and found purified BTV1 and UV-BTV1 both induced IFN-/ in highly purified sheep blood pDCs. however, as found with LD PBMCs, heat-inactivated BTV and binary ethyleneimine-inactivated BTV were not capable of IFN-/ induction in pDCs. purified BTV1, UV-BTV1, and crude UV-BTV8 were all found to induce IFN-, TNF-, IL-6, and IL-12 gene expression in purified sheep blood pDCs. UV-BTV8 was also found to increase the expression of the costimulatory CD80/86 molecules on the cell surface of the pDCs. LD PBMCs were cultured alone (mock) or with UV-BTV8 (0.06 TCID induction by UV-BTV in purified pDCs involves endo-/lysosomal maturation. we used UV-BTV stimulation to avoid interference between IFN-/ synthesis and viral replication. we found that bafilomycin A1 abrogated the IFN-/ production by LD PBMCs. LD PBMCs (1.5 106 cells/ml) and pDCs (2.5 105 cells/ml) were treated with bafilomycin A1 (2.5 and 10 g/ml) for 30 min prior to UV-BTV8 (0.06 TCID50/ml) (A) and CpG-A (10 g/ml) exposure. data are expressed as percentage of the IFN-/ level obtained without drug. oligonucleotide described as a TLR antagonist inhibits TLR7 and, to a lesser extent, TLR9. but even at a 50-g/ml concentration, A151 did not inhibit the IFN-/ induction by UV-BTV in LD PBMCs. the IFN-/ amounts induced by influenza virus, CpG-A, and UBTV8 were 110, 190, and 64 IU/ml. the experiment was reproduced twice and gave the same results. we could not use the MyD88 inhibitory peptide and its control on purified pDCs for subsequent stimulation by UV-BTV. the viability of fresh LD PBMCs was not significantly affected by the peptides. cytosolic serine-threonine kinase PKR has been implicated in the IFN-/ production induced by viruses in many cell types. PKR activation can occur by direct binding of dsRNA or can be induced downstream of other nucleic acid sensors, such as TLR (30) or, possibly, MDA-5 (56, 60) PKR inhibition reduces IFN-/ release and cytokine gene activation by blood pDCs in response to UV-BTV8. drugs were added to cells at indicated concentrations for 30 min before infection. cells were stimulated overnight with UV-BTV8. oxindole-imidazole C16 treatment decreased the proportion of polyadenylated versus total IFN- mRNA induced by UV-BTV. blockade of PKR enzymatic activity by C16 does not specifically affect the amounts of polyadenylated IFN-/ mRNA in UV-BTV-treated pDCs. we found that UV-BTV IFN-/ induction was inhibited by the SAPK/JNK LD PBMCs (1.5 106 cells/ml) and pDCs (2.5 104 cells/ml) were treated with indicated doses of PD184352 (MEK1/ERK1/2 inhibitor) for 30 min before overnight culture with UV-BTV8 (0.06 TCID50/ml) data are expressed as percentages of the IFN-/ level obtained without drug treatment. we also found circulating IFN-/ in the blood of sheep inoculated with BTV8 at days 2 and 6 postinjection. the viral load in blood peaked at day 6 (around 106 viral RNA copies/ml) and was decreased by 10-fold at day 10. the amount of IFN-/ in the cell supernatant varied among animals. wild-type BTV2, BTV8, BTV1 and a-BTV2 each triggered IFN-/ production by LD PBMCs. pDCs are the main producers of IFN-/ in lymph and blood cells. cDCs are CD11c+ cells and pDCs are characterized as B CD11c CD45RB+ cells. no IFN-/ could be detected in response to a-BTV2. BTV was confined to the CD45RB+ blood cell fraction (Fig. 3D) we then set up our goal to sort sheep blood pDCs to a high purity level using flow cytometry sorting. only fraction 1 (FSChigh cells) produced IFN-/ in response to CpG. pDCs from lymph (A to C) and blood (D and E) are the main hematopoetic cell type producing IFN-/ in response to BTV in vitro. pDCs were sorted from LD lymph cells with magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS)-immunomagnetic beads. cells (105 cells/ml) were cultured overnight with a-BTV2 (0.01 TCID50/cell), and IFN- was measured in cultured supernatant using a ruminant-specific IFN- ELISA. each experiment was repeated at least one or two times, and similar results were obtained. pDCs from LD PBMC cultures (27%) were expressing nonstructural NS2 protein. accumulation of viral RNA was detected after 48 h of culture. after 20 min of UV irradiation of the viral inoculum (UV-BTV) viral replication could not be detected in LD lymph cells that included over 30% cDCs. BTV replicates in pDCs but replication is dispensable for IFN-/ induction. LD PBMCs were infected with BTV8 or UV-BTV8. the B+ CD8+ TCR/+ CD11b+ cells were gate excluded. the CD45RB+ FSChigh cells were analyzed for NS2 expression. NS2-specific expression was controlled with nonimmune rabbit serum. the experiment was reproduced 3 times with similar results. pDCs were selected from LD lymph cells using MACS beads. they were cultured overnight (1.5 106 cells/ml) alone (mock) or with a-BTV2. UV-inactivated a-BTV2 or heat-inactivated a-BTV2 (H-BTV2) were detected (U/ml) in the culture supernatant using a bioassay. live purified BTV1, UV-BTV1, and crude UV-BTV8 were all found to induce IFN-, TNF-, IL-6, and IL-12 gene expression in sheep pDCs. UV-BTV8 was also found to increase the expression of the costimulatory CD80/86 molecules on the cell surface of the pDCs from LD PBMC cultures. DC preparations from 3 different sheep were stimulated overnight by UV-BTV8. cytokine gene expression was evaluated as described for panel B. we used UV-BTV stimulation to avoid interference between IFN-/ synthesis and viral replication. UV-BTV8-induced type I IFN in blood pDCs is sensitive to bafilomycin A1 (A, B) and chloroquine (C, D) after overnight culture, IFN-/ was measured (U/ml) in supernatants by bioassay. data are expressed as the percentage of the IFN-/ level obtained without drug. IFN-/ induction by UV-BTV involves TLR7-independent and MyD88-dependent signaling. the inhibition of IFN-/ induction by UV-BTV suggests a TLR-mediated signaling may be involved in the IFN-/ induction by UV-BTV. IFN-/ was detected in supernatants by a bioassay. the IFN-/ amounts induced by influenza virus, CpG-A, and UBTV8 were 110, 190, and 64 IU/ml. the MyD88 inhibitory peptide at the 100 M dose significantly reduced the IFN-/ production induced both by CpG and BTV. the cells did not survive the subsequent preincubation with both the control and the inhibitory peptides. the viability of fresh LD PBMCs was not significantly affected by the peptides. the IFN-/ levels induced by CpG-A were 62.5, 125, 250, and 1,000 IU/ml. the cytosolic serine-threonine kinase PKR has been implicated in the IFN-/ production induced by viruses in many cell types. both drugs also strongly reduced the IFN-a, TNF-a, and IL-12 mRNA expression induced by UV-BTV in purified pDCs. PKR inhibition reduces IFN-/ release and cytokine gene activation by blood pDCs in response to UV-BTV8. PKR was shown to modulate IFN-/ mRNA poly(A) integrity in rotavirus-infected mouse embryonic fibroblasts. we tested whether the oxindole-imidazole C16 treatment would decrease the proportion of polyadenylated versus total IFN- mRNA induced by UV-BTV. blockade of PKR enzymatic activity by C16 does not specifically affect the amounts of polyadenylated I d by the SAPK/JNK inhibitor by over 60%, whereas the ERK1/2 inhibitor had no effect (Fig. 10A) no toxicity was found for the SAPK/JNK inhibitor. BTV displays specific interactions with primary pDCs and cDCs. but it induces IFN-/ only in pDCs without requiring viral replication. a mechanism involving endocytosis and signaling through the MyD88 adaptor. the lack of IFN-/ synthesis by cDCs that permit replication of BTV may also involve the expression of nonstructural proteins that block IFN-/ synthesis. however, we could not test whether viral expression and IFN-/ were exclusive phenomena in BTV-infected pDCs cultures. only enveloped viruses were found capable of activating pDCs for IFN-/ production via non-nucleic acid structures. however, the integrity of the capsid proteins and/or of the dsRNA structures appeared to be very important for leading to optimal IFN-/ production. however, the integrity of the capsid proteins and/or of the dsRNA structures appeared to be very important for leading to optimal IFN-/ production. this finding excludes the possibility of both TLR7 and TLR8 involvement in UV-BTV signaling in pDCs. the lack of TLR7 involvement in IFN-/ induction in pDCs by an RNA virus is a very rare event. PKR inhibitor 2-AP was found to prevent the IFN-/ secretion induced by CpG-A (30), indicating that PKR can integrate signal transduction from TLR in this cell type. PKR was recently found to induce IFN-/ production in coordination with MDA-5 activation by some viruses via the stabilization of IFN-/ mRNA poly(A) (56). adenovirus that triggered IFN-/ production via TLR and MAVS-independent mechanisms in cDCs also used JNK-dependent and ERK1/2-independent signaling related to sensors that were not identified (15). dsRNA virus triggers IFN-/ in primary host pDCs via a novel mechanism that is independent of TLR7/8 but dependent on the MyD88 adaptor."}
