{"summary": "public health officials confirm measles diagnosis, identify close contacts of infectious cases, deliver public health interventions. a stochastic network simulation of measles contact tracing was conducted using existing agent-based modeling software. synthetic population was created to simulate California population in terms of population demographics, household, workplace, school, and neighborhood characteristics. contact tracing is a method of eliciting close contacts of cases. each identified case requires extensive follow-up to confirm the infection. for measles, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) can reduce an exposed person\u2019s likelihood of infection. using an agent-based model, we estimated the effects of contact tracing and public health interventions on the number of persons infected by an index case. the use of an agent-based model enabled us to model complex processes involving infectious disease transmission and a public health response in a synthetic population of individuals. synthetic population mimicked a medium-sized county population living in California based on 2010 census data. each individual in the synthetic population had demographic information (e.g., age and gender) and locations of social activity (i.e., household, school, daycare, neighborhood, and workplace) each individual in the synthetic population had demographic information (e.g., age and gender) the age of the index case was sampled from the observed age distribution of measles cases in California from 2000\u20132012. a susceptible individual of this age was chosen from the synthetic population to represent the index case, the source of the imported measles virus into the synthetic population. daycare contact rate 3\u201320 http://www.daycare.com/california Household transmission probability per contact 0.9\u20131.0 [37] School transmission probability per contact 0.9\u20131.0 [37] Daycare transmission probability per contact 0.9\u20131.0 [37] Trace probability 0.9\u20131.0 Assumed Intervention delay 1 1.0\u20133.0 days. exposed, susceptible individuals who did not receive MMR PEP vaccine or IG PEP were asked to refrain from contact with non-household members until the end of their incubation period. if an identified case refused all interventions, that person could still transmit measles to others if infected. measles epidemics were simulated over 90 simulated days to evaluate effectiveness of contact tracing and public health interventions. the scenario without MMR PEP, IG PEP, and voluntary isolation and home quarantine served as the reference scenario to which the other seven scenarios were compared. each replication corresponds to an introduction of a measles case and following the subsequent chain of transmission. synthetic population mimicked a medium-sized county population living in California based on 2010 census data (http://www.dof.ca.gov). each individual in the synthetic population had demographic information (e.g., age and gender) and locations of social activity (i.e., household, school, daycare, neighborhood, and workplace) population Immunity of the Synthetic Population Children less than one year of age were assumed to have a 67% level of protection due to maternal antibodies. age-specific immunity levels were estimated based on measles vaccine coverage and vaccine efficacy. tion period, infectious cases were able to transmit measles to different contacts in household, daycare, school, workplace, and neighborhood settings. we simulated transmission for 90 days after the introduction of measles into the synthetic population. key parameters of our model are given in Table 1. if the identified case cooperated with a health department\u2019s investigation, every contact exposed to that case in the previous seven days had a chance to be found. if the identified case cooperated with a health department\u2019s investigation, every contact exposed to that case in the previous seven days had a chance to be found. the health department would be notified and initiate a contact investigation based on the newly-identified individual. a graphical representation of the public health intervention decisions for susceptible and exposed contacts is given in Fig 1.. ninety days was chosen as the end of simulation time because large measles outbreaks in the era of elimination have not exceeded 11 weeks in duration [45] the simulation was repeated 256 times for each of the 1024 parameter sets under the eight scenarios. the median value of R primary, the average number of secondary cases caused by the index cases, among the simulations for each of the eight scenarios. the median probability of escape is defined as the proportion of 256 iterations in which there was at least 1 measles case at the end of 90 days of simulation. measles vaccination coverage in the synthetic population was lowered to 85% to 95% among individuals 1 to 18 years of age. the probability of escape is defined as the proportion of 256 iterations in which there was at least 1. the probability of escape is defined as the proportion of 256 iterations. measles vaccination coverage in the synthetic population was lowered to 85% to 95% among individuals 1 to 18 years of age. scenarios with voluntary home quarantine coupled with one or two other interventions had the largest decrease in the median number of secondary cases in comparison with the other scenarios. the probability of escape is defined as the proportion of 256 iterations in which there was at least 1 measles case at the end of 90 days of simulation. the most effective component in reducing measles transmission in this population is voluntary isolation and home quarantine. the degree of clustering of susceptibility may affect the likelihood of disease outbreaks [46] and infectious disease transmission dynamics [48]. we did not explicitly consider measles transmission among healthcare settings. we limited our investigations to the household, workplace, school, and daycare settings. if a person does not receive MMR PEP within 72 hours of exposure, IG PEP may prevent or modify measles in a susceptible person if given within six days. isolation and quarantine are particularly important in reducing the number of secondary cases infected by the index case."}
