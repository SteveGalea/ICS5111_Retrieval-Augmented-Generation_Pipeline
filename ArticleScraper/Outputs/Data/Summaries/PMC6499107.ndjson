{"summary": "the viral order Mononegavirales currently includes 11 families for negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. with 18 included genera, the family Rhabdoviridae is the largest and most diverse of the mononegaviral families. however, viruses of most genera are undercharacterized, and their potential as human pathogens remains unknown. CPV was isolated in 1981 at Coastal Plains Research Station, northern Territory, Australia. anti-CPV antibodies were detected in healthy Australian buffalo, cattle, dogs, and a horse, but not in deer, humans, pigs, or wallabies. two novel genes of unknown function (U1, U2) located between the matrix protein (M) gene and the glycoprotein (G) gene and one gene of unknown function (U3) between the G gene and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) gene. each of these genes is defined as an independent transcriptional unit bounded by consensus transcription initiation and transcription termination/polyadenylation sequences. two tibroviruses, Ekpoma virus 1 (EKV-1, 12,659 nt) and Ekpoma virus 2 (EKV-2, 12,674 nt) were discovered by NGS in blood samples from apparently healthy humans in Nigeria. an EKV-2-like genome detected in a human from angola was recently deposited in GenBank (accession #MF079256; 12,638 nt) tibrovirus U3 encodes a small viroporin-like transmembrane protein. it is suspected that BASV G encodes a class III fusion glycoprotein. it is the only rhabdovirus genome-encoded protein determining rhabdovirion cell entry. reverse genetics to create recombinant VSIV (rVSIV), VSIV G can easily be replaced with other mononegaviral glycoproteins. rVSIVs expressing heterotypic Gs can be used to perform well-controlled, initial cell susceptibility evaluations of G from heterotypic viruses without including authentic heterotypic viruses in the experiment. rVSIV infections rates reflect tibrovirus particle cell entry (host cell susceptibility) tibrovirus particle cell entry is likely dynamin-dependent and cholesterol-independent. tibrovirus particle cell entry is likely dynamin-dependent and cholesterol-independent. open-reading frames encoding BAV, BHV, CPV, and TIBV Gs were amplified by RT-PCR from infected cells (BAV, CPV, TIBV) or from infected laboratory mouse brain samples (BHV) cloned into the rVSIV control backbone in place of native VSIV G. sequences of the G-encoding regions of all created rVSIV antigenomes were confirmed to be identical to all experiments were performed in triplicate; error bars show standard deviations. BHV, Beatrice Hill virus; BASV, Bas-Congo virus; BAV, Bivens Arm virus; CNS, central nervous system, CPV; Coastal Plains virus; EKV-1, Ekpoma virus 1; MOI, multiplicity of infection; NCI-60 cell lines are listed by their abbreviations. Coastal Plains virus (CPV) strain DPP 53 Isolated in 1981 at Coastal Plains Research Station, Northern Territory, Australia, from an apparently healthy steer. cytopathic effects (CPE) affected approximately 60% of cells compared to non-infected control cells. SWBV strain UF-11 Isolated in 1981 from biting midges (C. insignis) in Florida, United States. genomes of the expanded four authentic tibroviruses were sequenced by Macrogen to ensure that the deduced G sequences are identical to the respective deduced G sequences from tibrovirus genomes deposited to GenBank. all four viruses were received as lyophilized powders in individual tubes. cell supernatants were harvested when cytopathic effects affected 60% of cells. one milliliter of P1 was used to infect a T175 flask of vero or Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) larva C6/36 (ATCC, #CRL-1660) cells. attempts to grow BHV in any culture failed, and authentic BHV had to be omitted. bat Eastern pipistrelle (Pipistrellus subflavus) adult lung PESU-B5L cells were provided by Eric F.

Coastal Plains virus (CPV) strain DPP 53 Isolated in 1981 at Coastal Plains Research Station, Northern Territory, Australia, from an apparently healthy steer. expanded for this study in C6/36 cells at 30\u00b0C until CPE affected approximately 60% of cells compared to non-infected control cells. genomes of the expanded four authentic tibroviruses were sequenced by Macrogen to ensure that the deduced G amino acid sequences are identical to the respective deduced G sequences from tibrovirus genomes deposited to GenBank. all four tibroviruses were received as lyophilized powder. each powder was resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffer saline (PBS) a given suspension of 100 l was added to a T75 flask containing vero or Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) larva C6/36 (ATCC, #CRL-1660) cells. supernatants were harvested when CPE affected approximately 60% of cells (designated P1; 15 ml/flas all NCI-60 panel cell lines were grown at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium (RPMI-1640), thermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States. bat Eastern pipistrelle (Pipistrellus subflavus) adult lung PESU-B5L cells were provided by Eric F.

Asian tiger mosquito (C6/36) and grivet (Vero) cells were exposed to medium-only control (\u2013), BAV, CPV, SWBV, or TIBV particle preparations. tibovirion entry was detected via western blotting using an anti-TIBV N antibody (here shown to be strongly cross-reactive with BAV in C6/36 cells and weakly cross-reactive with SWBV) the results of this experiment suggest that authentic tibrovirus replication does not occur in most cell types after particle entry. rVSIV\u2013BAV infected 50 human cell lines and all other cell lines. TIBV caused CPE in almost all human cell lines but N could be detected in two cell lines. we used a wild-type rVSIV expressing its native VSIV G and eGFP (rVSIV\u2013VSIV G control) and created rVSIVs based on this control expressing the Gs of all eight known tibroviruses. we then exposed 53 well-characterized human adherent cancer cell lines of the \u201cNCI-60 panel\u201d (Weinstein, 2006) to rVSIV\u2013VSIV G control. the percentage of eGFP-expressing NCI-60 cell lines was measured by high-content imaging at 24 h post-exposure. all experiments were performed in triplicates; error bars show standard deviations. rVSIV\u2013BAV expressing a tibrovirus G would replicate at similar efficiencies in cells that permit entry of both viruses. rVSIV\u2013BASV (4 negative cell lines, 11 cell lines with 100% infection efficiency), rVSIV\u2013SWBV (6 negative cell lines, 21 cell lines with 100% infection efficiency) rVSIV\u2013EKV-1 and rVSIV\u2013EKV-2 entered and replicated in all tested cell lines. only two cell lines were infected with approximately 50% efficiency. rVSIV\u2013BAV, rVSIV\u2013BHV, rVSIV\u2013EKV-1, rVSIV\u2013EKV-2, and rVSIV\u2013TIBV were inefficiently infected with rVSIV\u2013BASV and rVSIV\u2013CPV. tibroviruses may be able to broadly enter human cell types and that individual tibrovirus Gs bestow different cell tropism patterns. all nine rVSIVs infected hispid cotton rat CRL, boa constrictor JK, and nonhuman primate MA104 and Vero cells with high efficiency. however, gorilla (RPGor53) cells could not be infected by rVSIV\u2013VSIV G control or rVSIV\u2013SWBV, and common chimpanzee (S008397 and RP00226) cells were highly susceptible to rVSIV\u2013CPV. rVSIV\u2013VSIV G control infected cells least efficiently compared to all other viruses. tibroviruses may be able to broadly enter non-human cell lines. but some cell lines may not be permissive to VSIV replication. rVSIV particles devoid of VSIV G and pseudotyped with BASV G were also confirmed to enter target cells in a pH-dependent manner. previously, rVSIV particles devoid of VSIV G and pseudotyped with BASV G were also confirmed to enter target cells in a pH-dependent manner. rVSIVs expressing diverse tibrovirus glycoproteins (G) are thought to enter cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) rhabdovirions are thought to generally enter cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) infectivity of all rVSIVs was inhibited by all three compounds in a dose-dependent manner in the absence of compound-induced cytotoxicity. however, most other rVSIVs were only moderately affected, and rVSIV\u2013BAV was barely affected. we obtained samples containing the five tibroviruses that were previously isolated in culture (BAV, BHV, CPV, SWBV, and TIBV) we succeeded in cultivating all of these viruses except BHV and therefore continued all experiments with the remaining four viruses. tibovirion entry was detected via western blotting using an anti-TIBV N antibody (here shown to be strongly cross-reactive with BAV in C6/36 cells and weakly cross-reactive with SWBV) cell lysates were harvested after the appearance of CPE or otherwise at day 10 post-inoculation. the exception to these observations was TIBV, the tibrovirus with the broadest tropism. TIBV caused CPE in almost all human cell lines but N could be detected in two cell lines. in nonhuman cell lines, N was undetectable in cell lines that did not develop CPE. the discovery of BASV, EKV-1, and EKV-2 genomes in human sera suggests some tibroviruses could infect humans. tibroviruses should be considered potential human pathogens for surveillance purposes until this hypothesis is ruled out. previous studies on this topic have been extremely limited. in 2013, Steffen et al. (2013) reported the evaluation of BASV cell entry using an eGFP-expressing VSIV pseudotyped with BASV G. the same pseudotype system was used to demonstrate that BASV G-mediated VSIV entry into adult grivet kidney (Vero), Asian tiger mosquito larva (C6/36, C7/10), aurochs (Bos taurus) kidney (MDBK), BHK-21, Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tb1 the most surprising result was that EKV-1 and EKV-2 appeared more efficient in entering human cells than BASV, the only other tibrovirus found in humans thus far. however, we cannot state which of these tibrovirion-susceptible cells are also permissive to tibrovirus replication and particle egress. unpassaged or low-passaged tibroviruses or tibrovirus sequences (or original samples) are not available anymore. we can only claim that those viruses enter animal cells efficiently. but we cannot extrapolate these results to wild-type tibroviruses. tibrovirus tropism evaluations using tibrovirus surrogate systems should not be interpreted as indicative of the actual ability of a tibrovirus to infect, for instance, humans. tibrovirus tropism evaluations using tibrovirus surrogate systems should not be interpreted as indicative of the actual ability of a tibrovirus to infect, for instance, humans. ary Material The Supplementary Material for this article can be found online at: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00856/full#supplementary-material FIGURE S2 Tibrovirus glycoproteins mediate virion entry into a broad range of animal cell types. the percentage of eGFP-expressing cell lines was measured by high-content imaging at 24 h post-exposure. error bars show standard deviations."}
