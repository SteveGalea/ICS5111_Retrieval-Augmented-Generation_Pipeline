{"summary": "several canine caliciviruses (CaCV) isolates have been reported. they are phylogenetically related to the vesiviruses. the genomes encode the non-structural polyprotein (1810 amino acids), major capsid protein (691 amino acids) and minor structural protein (134 amino acids) CaCV isolates have restricted cell tropism, antigenic diversity and genetic variation. further investigation will shed light on antigenic relation to other vesiviruses. supplementary material is available to authorized users.
