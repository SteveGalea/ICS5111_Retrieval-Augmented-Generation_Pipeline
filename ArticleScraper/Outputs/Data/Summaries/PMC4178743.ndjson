{"summary": "hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a viral pathogen transmitted by the fecal-oral route that causes acute hepatitis with a mortality rate at or below 3% in young adults and up to 30% in pregnant women in the third trimester (1, 2, 54). hepatitis E has been recognized frequently in industrialized countries (1). hepatitis C virus- and HEV-infected chimpanzees showed that HEV evoked a lesser magnitude of IFN response than HCV. the findings provide valuable information about the function of the HEV ORF1 product and improve our understanding of HEV pathogenesis. S10-3 cells maintained in DMEM-reduced serum (DMEM-RS) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) transfection of HEK293T and HEK293 cells with plasmid DNA was performed by using FuGeneHD. HEK293 cells were stably expressing VenusC1-IRF-3. surviving cells were cloned by limited dilution and cell sorting. poly(IC) (low molecular weight) was used to induce interferon production.

HEK293T cells were transfected with the reporter pGL3.0-IFN- promoter. the Renilla vector pRL-TK was also transfected for normalization. transfection of HEK293T and HEK293 cells with plasmid DNA was performed by using FuGeneHD (Promega, Madison, WI) the allantoic fluid was harvested 3 days postinfection. surviving cells were cloned by limited dilution and cell sorting. poly(IC) was a synthetic analog of dsRNA (invivogen, San Diego, CA) AAGGTTACCGG Y H1R6 CCCTCGAGTTACTGAGCGTAGAACTCCAAC H1F4 GCGAATTCTGTGGCGCTCTGG H1F5 GCGAATTCTGTGGCGCTCTGG a F, forward primer; R, reverse primer indicates the primer is based on sequences of HEV ORF1. HEV replicons pSK-E2 and pSK-E2-GFP were described previously (12, 15, 16) the construction of myc-RIG-I(N) (N-terminal domain) (17), MDA-5(N) (18), FLAG-TBK-1 (19), and FLAG-IKK (20) plasmids were described previously. digital signal acquisition and densitometry analyses were conducted using the Quantity One Program, version 4.6 (Bio-Rad). total RNA was isolated from cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) reverse transcriptase, along with oligo(dT) and a random 15-mer was conducted. transcripts of RPL32 (ribosomal protein L32) were also detected from the same samples. IP samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibody against ubiquitin. HEK293T cells were transfected with the reporter pGL3.0-IFN- promoter. the Renilla vector pRL-TK was also transfected for normalization. full-length HEV RNA generated from pSKE2-GFP construct. insertion of GFP disrupts expression of ORF2 and ORF3 (12) was included for comparison. cells were transfected with poly(IC) 10 days post-HEV RNA transfection. RT-qPCR was then conducted to detect IFN- transcript. the cells transfected with pSK-E2 RNA had a significantly lower level of IFN- transcript (3.2-fold) this indicates that HEV replication reduced IFN expression evoked by poly(IC) the results suggest that the ORF1 product was at least partially responsible for the inhibition. 293T cells transfected with the plasmids were confirmed with Western blotting using HA antibody. all the proteins except HPX appeared to be one band. the HPX lane had two bands, indicating excision of the product. HEK293T cells were transfected with PCP and HPX plasmids. cells were infected with Sendai virus at an MOI of 1 48 h after transfection. luciferase activity was assayed 48 h after infection. PRRSV nsp1 led to 4.6-fold reduction. other fragments of ORF1 did not have an inhibitory effect on IFN- induction. transfection with empty vector and HEV ORF1 domains had an undetectable cytotoxic effect. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the IFN- reporter, HPX, and the specific components of the RIG-I signaling pathway. overexpression of the individual components was needed to determine which step in the RLR signaling HEV HPX blocks. transfections were done as for panel A, with the replacement of RIG-I or MDA-5 with TBK-1 or IKK. we cotransfected the cells with FLAG-IRF-3 and HPX plasmids. at 40 h after transfection, the cells were transfected with poly(IC) and harvested 8 h later for Western blotting. the HPX region contains 3 putative domains, the hypervariable (HV), proline-rich (Pro) and X domains. to determine which domain was capable of antagonizing IRF-3 activation, we cloned the three domains individually into the pCAGEN expression vector. the plasmids were coexpressed with FLAG-IRF-3 in 293T cells. we cotransfected 293T cells with plasmids expressing PCP and RIG-I or TBK-1. the levels of endogenous RIG-I and TBK-1 are too low to be detected in Western blotting. ubiquitination status was assessed by Western blotting with ubiquitin antibody. HEV replication in hepatoma cells inhibits IRF-3 phosphorylation and ubiquitination of RIG-I and TBK-1. the results showed that overexpression of the X and PCP domains of HEV ORF1 led to inhibition of IRF-3 phosphorylation and RIG-I and TBK-1 ubiquitination. the cells were harvested for detection of IRF-3 phosphorylation. total IRF-3, GFP, and tubulin were also detected. western blotting with antibodies against ubiquitin and RIG-I was conducted. K-1 in whole-cell lysate of S10-3 cells was below detection level in Western blotting. HEV replication inhibited poly(IC)-induced IFN production by blocking phosphorylation of IRF-3 and ubiquitination of RIG-I and TBK-1. the cells were transfected with poly(I C) (PIC) the results showed that HEV replication or poly(IC) stimulation had a minimal effect on the viability of cells. the HEV ORF1 product inhibits IFN- mRNA reduction. the fragments were cloned into the pCAGEN plasmid with an HA tag at the N terminus. the fragments were expressed as HA-tagged proteins. the cells were transfected with plasmids of the ORF1 fragments. at 12 h after poly(I C) treatment, the cells were harvested for RNA isolation. PRRSV nsp1 was included as a control. HEK293T cells were transfected with empty vector and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1), known to inhibit IFN induction (31), were included as controls. RT-qPCR was conducted to detect the IFN- mRNA level. PCP and HPX significantly inhibited Sendai virus-induced IFN- promoter activation. the HEV X domain inhibits IFN induction by blocking phosphorylation of IRF-3. ORF1 HPX product inhibits IFN- induction. HEK293T cells were transfected with IFN- reporter plasmid. nsp1 or nsp1 or HPX DNA were included as a positive control. HEK293T cells were transfected with IRF-3 and empty vector (EV) or HPX plasmids. at 8 h post-PIC treatment, the cells were harvested for detection of IRF-3 phosphorylation by Western blotting. total IRF-3 and HPX expression was detected with IRF-3 and HA antibodies, respectively. the X domain was identified as the inhibitor of IRF-3 phosphorylation. the X domain was identified as the inhibitor of IRF-3 phosphorylation. the papain-like cysteine protease domain inhibited poly(IC)-induced IFN expression. HEK293T cells were transfected with PCP and RIG-I plasmids. at 48 h posttransfection, the cells were harvested for immunoprecipitation with FLAG antibody to pull down RIG-I. Western blotting (WB) with antibodies against ubiquitin (Ub) and RIG-I was conducted. the cells with E2-GFP replication had much lower poly(IC)-induced IRF-3 phosphorylation, while the total IRF-3 level had minimal change. this result was consistent with the findings for X domain expression in HEK293 cells. both RIG-I and TBK-1 in S10-3 cells transfected with E2-GFP RNA had lower ubiquitination levels than control without HEV replication. results consistent with observation of PCP overexpression in HEK293T cells. endogenous TBK-1 in whole-cell lysate was also detectable. a model is proposed to illustrate the HEV inhibition in the RLR pathway of IFN induction. PCP mediates the deubiquitination of RIG-I and TBK-1. X domain inhibits IRF-3 phosphorylation. in our study, the HEV X domain was found to inhibit IRF-3 phosphorylation, which appears to be a new function for a viral macro domain. however, we were unable to detect interaction between the X domain and IRF-3 or the upstream kinase TBK-1 in IP experiments. thus, the mechanism through which the X domain inhibits IRF-3 phosphorylation needs to be further elucidated. the HEV Met-PCP polyprotein was found to act as a deubiquitinase for ubiquitin-, SUMO-, and ISG15-linked proteins in a cell-free system (35) however, Met-PCP was unable to cleave an LXGG motif, which should be recognized by cellular or viral PCP. the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus processes a papain-like cysteine protease capable of cleaving ubiquitin- and ISG15-conjugated proteins. targeting the viral cysteine protease with a virus-specific inhibitor blocks SARS virus replication while not affecting cellular deubiquitinases. this implies that the deubiquitinase function of viral PCP could be a potential therapeutic target."}
