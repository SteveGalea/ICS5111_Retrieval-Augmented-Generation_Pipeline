{"summary": "TBEV, a tick-borne flavivirus (TBFV), is responsible for 14,000 infections per year [1] and has a fatality rate of up to 40% [2]. TBEV and other TBFV, such as Omsk Hemorrhagic Fever virus, are classified as NIAID Category C pathogens and are treated as biosafety level 4 agents in the united states. the impact of TBFV infection on vertebrates can vary considerably. some reports describe persistent infection of vertebrates and vertebrate cell lines. other laboratory studies show severe disease development in infected animals. NS4A, a small hydrophobic protein, has been implicated in the cellular changes that accompany virus reproduction. NS5 is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and methyltransferase. recent implications of LGTV NS5 as an innate immune response antagonist confirm a broader role for this protein beyond genome replication. the vesicles are typically 70\u2013150 nm in diameter [28] with a pore-like connection either between vesicles and the cytoplasm or between individual vesicles [30], [31]. a limited number of comparative studies have been published [32]\u2013[36]. virus stock of TP21 (LGTV) was prepared by infection of Vero cell cultures at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.005 [38], [39] for virus titration by immunofocus assay. ten-fold dilutions of LGTV were adsorbed for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 with constant rocking. infected cells were then washed twice with DPBS and fixed with 100% methanol for 30 minutes. samples for immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were prepared at multiple time points post-infection. no differences were noted between samples collected at various time points. cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed for 10 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/5% sucrose in PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/4% PFA for 10 minutes, and blocked for 60 minutes with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA/PBS) primary and secondary antibodies were incubated at a 11000 dilution in 2% BSA/PBS for 60 minutes each, with three five-minute was samples were processed further in a biowave model laboratory microwave oven. washed twice in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 1 minute each. post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in phosphate buffer for two cycles of 2 minutes on, 2 minutes off, and 2 minutes on. electron microscopy Imaging and Tomography Thin sections were examined at 80 kV using a model H7500 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi High Technologies, Inc.) digital images were captured using a model HR-100 camera system (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Inc.) and processed with PhotoShop (Adobe Systems, Inc.) 1105 ISE6 cells were seeded in complete DMEM into wells of twelve-well plates. ten-fold dilutions of LGTV were adsorbed for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C. infected cells were then washed twice with DPBS and fixed with 100% methanol for 30 minutes. cells were passaged every two to three weeks as needed and supernatants collected for viral titer via immunofocus assay. no differences were noted between samples collected at various time points. cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed for 10 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/5% sucrose in PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/4% PFA for 10 minutes, and blocked for 60 minutes with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA/PBS) primary and secondary antibodies were incubated at a 11000 dilution in 2% BSA/PBS for 60 minutes each, with three five-minute was samples were processed further in a biowave model laboratory microwave oven. washed twice in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 1 minute each. post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in phosphate buffer for two cycles. dehydrated in three changes of ethanol for 1 minute each. semi-thick sections were examined at 80 kV using a model H7500 transmission electron microscope. digital images were captured using a model HR-100 camera system. images were aligned and reconstructed into tomogram volumes using Inspect3D software. infected Vero cells first showed cytopathic effect (CPE) by 24 hpi, consisting of rounded cells and syncytia. by 96 hpi, vero cells showed extensive evidence of cell death. i as a compromise between virus production and integrity of cellular morphology. in nature, TBFV establish and maintain a persistent infection across the various life-stages of the arthropod host [8]. cells were infected at a MOI of 10, fixed, and stained for individual viral proteins. NS3 staining was colocalized with both the viral membrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins. localization of LGTV proteins with Markers for cellular organelles takes place on membranes derived from ER. maturation of virus particles occurs within the trans-Golgi [40]\u2013[43]. similar results were observed for both acutely and persistently infected ISE6 cell cultures. infected cells showed no dsRNA staining in infected vero and ISE6 cells. dsRNA labeling was coincident with ER staining. dsRNA labeling was coincident with ER staining. cells were infected at a MOI of 10 and fixed at 48 hpi. mock-infected cells were co-stained with anti-dsRNA (green) and anti-NS5 protein (red) nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue) cells were infected at a MOI of 10, fixed, resin embedded, 70 nm section cut. lower magnification showing ER proliferation and vesicles. round vesicles, elongated vesicles, and tubules. virions were not detected until 96 hpi (data not shown) the membranous tubules or vesicles were present at a slightly higher frequency than in acutely infected vero cells. membrane proliferation was more extensive than in acutely infected ISE6 cells. cells were infected at a MOI of 10, fixed, epoxy resin embedded, and 250 nm sections cut for dual-axis electron tomography. panels show the 3-D surface rendering of convoluted membrane (green), vesicles (blue) and virions (red) derived from the 3-D reconstruction. the majority of vesicles observed in the tick cells were round. however, slightly elongated vesicles were seen more frequently than in vero cells. communicating pores or openings between the vesicles and the cytoplasm were also seen in the tick cells. uninfected Vero cells formed a monolayer of uniform elongated, fibroblast-like cells firmly adherent to the culture vessel. the cytopathic effect was progressive and by 96 hpi, vero cells showed extensive evidence of cell death. after 96 hours, very few cells remained attached to the culture vessel. a time point of 48 hpi was selected as a compromise between virus production and integrity of cellular morphology. in nature, TBFV establish and maintain a persistent infection across the various life-stages of the arthropod host [8]. NS5 showed a more punctate cytoplasmic staining pattern. similar patterns were seen for all the viral proteins in both cells lines. cells were infected at a MOI of 10, fixed, and stained for individual viral proteins. localization of LGTV proteins with Markers for cellular organelles in infected mammalian and tick cells. cells were infected at a MOI of 10, fixed, and co-stained with viral markers, anti-E or anti-NS3 (red) and anti-NS3 (red) infected cells showed no dsRNA staining in infected vero and ISE6 cells. the majority of dsRNA labeling was coincident with ER staining. dsRNA labeling was coincident with ER staining. cells were infected at a MOI of 10 and fixed at 48 hpi. mock-infected cells were co-stained with anti-dsRNA (green) and anti-NS5 protein (red) nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue) cells were infected at a MOI of 10, fixed, resin embedded, 70 nm section cut. Mock infected (B) Lower magnification showing ER proliferation and vesicles. round vesicles, elongated vesicles, and tubules. membranous tubules or vesicles were present at a slightly higher frequency than in acutely infected vero cells. membrane proliferation was more extensive than in acutely infected vero cells. virions were also found in dilated ER cisternae. the 60\u2013100 nm diameter vesicles were round in shape (Fig. 8A and Movie S1) there were pore-like openings connecting vesicles to the cytoplasm and to other vesicles. cells were infected at a MOI of 10, fixed, epoxy resin embedded, and 250 nm sections cut for dual-axis electron tomography. panels show the 3-D surface rendering of convoluted membrane (green), vesicles the majority of vesicles observed in the tick cells were round. however, slightly elongated vesicles were seen more frequently than in vero cells. the persistently infected tick cells also contained round vesicles. a number of functions have been ascribed to the alterations, including concentration of viral replication machinery and provision of a solid state platform for viral protein synthesis and replication. a number of functions have been ascribed to the alterations, including concentration of viral replication machinery and sequestration of viral dsRNA replicative form from innate immune sensors. the function of the vesicles is thought to be to minimize exposure of the replicative form dsRNA to innate immune sensors. the pores are thought to provide a conduit for nucleotides, amino acids, and other components required for replication and gene expression [30]. in brief, our findings suggest marked similarities between acute replication in ISE6 and vero cells. tubules were closed on each end and were not connected by pores to other tubules or to the cytoplasm, unlike the round vesicles. it is unclear if they represent bona fide features of replication, aberrant structures, or the result of a cellular process to restrict infection. ER is depicted in green, vesicles in blue, and virions in red. both virions and vesicles are contained within proliferated ER. images were aligned using Inspect3D software (FEI, Inc.) images were aligned using Inspect3D software (FEI, Inc.) and rendered using Amira (Visage Imaging, Inc., San Diego, CA)"}
