{"summary": "the entry of enveloped viruses comprises three steps: (i) receptor binding by the envelope protein, (ii) triggering of large conformational changes in the envelope protein to expose a hydrophobic region termed the fusion peptide. before attachment, the viral envelope proteins exist in a metastable prefusion conformation that transitions to a more stable fusion conformation upon a triggering event. fusion peptide is inserted into the endosome to expose its fusion peptide. a loop of HA2 becomes helical at low pH and promotes the projection of the fusion peptide toward the target membrane (1, 4, 5). a library of peptides from H7 HA was screened for inhibition of H7 HA-mediated entry using a pseudovirus entry assay. 111 peptides are prepared with the influenza proteins HA and neuraminidase in the viral membrane and the HIV core. from the library of 111 peptides assayed at 100 m, we found six peptides that exhibited >60% inhibition of virus entry and 20% inhibition of VSVG-mediated entry. the most straightforward explanation for peptide inhibition is that the inhibitory peptides bind to their regions in the HA sequence, thereby disrupting inhibition of H5 and H7 HA entry by PEP87 Based on amino acid sequences and antigenic properties, HA types are divided into groups 1 and 2 with H7 HA classified in Group 2 and H5 HA classified in Group 1 (6). however, inhibitors of HA-mediated entry are generally group-specific. mutants HA1-I28A, HA1-M31A, HA2-T41A, HA2-Q45A, HA2-V52A, HA2-N53A, and HA2-L99A exhibit significantly less sensitivity to inhibition by PEP87. mutants HA2-Q42A, HA2-T49A, and HA2-L99A exhibit significantly less sensitivity to inhibition by PEP87. mutations that affect PEP87 inhibition are all located in close proximity to the PEP87 sequence. mutations are consistent with the notion that PEP87 disrupts HA function by binding to its corresponding region in the HA trimer. we observed the formation of helix under aqueous conditions at high peptide concentrations, suggesting an equilibrium between unstructured monomer and a helical trimer (10). in the case of the SARS peptide, we observed the formation of helix under aqueous conditions, suggesting an equilibrium between unstructured monomer and a helical trimer. in summary, PEP87 is relatively unstructured in isolation but exhibits a propensity to form helix the resulting structure consists of a continuous helix from residue Asn-4 to His-15. further examination of the PEP87 structure reveals a negatively charged surface comprising residues Glu-6 and Glu-12. backbone atoms (residues 4\u201315) 0.55 0.15 All heavy atoms (residues 1\u201317) 1.47 0.45 All heavy atoms (residues 1\u201317) 2.40 0.44 Ramachandran plot for the minimized mean structure Most favored region (%) 99.6 Additionally allowed region (%) 0.4 Characterization of PEP87 binding by NMR We then characterized the interaction of PEP87 with recombinant the STD experiment to show that the addition of PEP87 does not affect the reporter signals of 2,3-sialyllactose, an HA receptor analog, suggesting that PEP87 binding does not bind to or perturb the receptor-binding site located in HA1. all of the NMR binding experiments were performed at neutral pH, and thus they present clear evidence of PEP87 binding to the prefusion, neutral pH form of HA. fluorescence spectra of H5 HA (nine tryptophans) and PEP87 (one tryptophan) in isolation are shown in Fig. 7a. the fluorescence spectrum of PEP87 is consistent with the crystal structure in which the tryptophans are relatively unexposed to solvent. fluorescence plots of HA, 50 m PEP87, and HA + 50 m PEP87 are corrected. a library of peptides was screened for inhibition of H7 HA-mediated entry using a pseudovirus entry assay in which virus-like particles (VLPs) are prepared. peptide inhibition is plotted as a function of the ratio of VSVG VLP entry to H7 HA-mediated VLP entry. the six most potent peptides are denoted in red; inhibitory peptides discarded due to cytotoxicity are denoted by asterisks. PEP87 inhibits H5 and H7 HA entry. a dose-dependent inhibition of H5 and H7 HA-mediated entry by PEP87. the data represented in a and b are the averages of experiments performed. mutants HA1-I28A, HA1-M31A, HA2-T41A, HA2-Q45A, HA2-V52A, HA2-N53A, and HA2-M102A exhibit significantly less sensitivity to inhibition by PEP87. mutants HA2-Q42A, HA2-T49A, and HA2-M102A exhibit significantly less sensitivity to inhibition by PEP87. mutations in HA-mediated entry by PEP87 are highlighted in yellow. mutation sites in red and blue are more sensitive to PEP87 inhibition, whereas those in blue are less sensitive to PEP87 inhibition. CD spectra recorded from 190 to 260 nm at 100 m (0.2 mg/ml) PEP87 in 20 mm phosphate, pH 8.0, 40% TFE at 25 \u00b0C. ellipticity of PEP87 as a function of peptide concentration in 20 mm phosphate, pH 8.0, at 25 \u00b0C. NMR characterization of PEP87 in the presence of cosolvent. a, secondary chemical shift of 13C. random coil chemical shifts are taken from merutka et al. e and C-terminal regions have been removed and a C-terminal foldon sequence has been added for stabilization (15). Previously, we have shown that STD NMR is a useful technique to characterize the binding of small molecules and peptides to large-molecular-weight viral proteins, including those embedded in viral membranes. experimental conditions were 10 m HA and 3 mm 2,3-sialyllactose 200 m PEP87 in 50 mm phosphate, pH 8.2, 50 mm NaCl in 100% 2H2O at 25 \u00b0C. c, STD NMR competition assay between 2,3-sialyllactose and PEP87. the loss in fluorescence occurs in the spectral region of solvent-shielded tryptophans of HA. the decreased fluorescence of HA suggests that one or more regions containing a tryptophan are undergoing significant changes in conformation. a peptide corresponding to a conserved region of HA1 of H5 HA has recently been shown to inhibit H5 and H7 HA entry by disrupting receptor binding (23) a relatively modest inhibition of influenza entry by PEP87 (IC50 > 50 m) suggests that it is more appropriate as a probe of HA structure and function than a therapeutic lead candidate. peptides corresponding to helical regions of viral envelope proteins exhibit much higher propensities to form helix in the presence of cosolvent. in future studies, it will be of interest to attempt stabilization of the PEP87 helical structure to assay whether the preformed helix exhibits better inhibitory properties. binding of PEP87 to the native site in HA would seem to imply a relatively large displacement of one or more HA2 subunits. the low propensity of the PEP87 sequence to become helical may be functionally relevant in that the HA conformational change requires large-scale motions. HEK 293T cells were cotransfected by plasmids pVSVG (bearing VSVG), pH7HA (bearing wild-type or mutant H5 HA); pN1NA (bearing N1 influenza neuraminidase); and pNL4\u20133.Luc.R-E- using PEI. the medium was harvested and filtered through a 0.45-m filter to make the VLP stocks. at 222 nm divided by the theoretical molar ellipticity (t) where (t) = 40,000 (1 4.6/n) and n = 17 (the total number of residues) STD NMR was performed as described previously (17, 29) on a Bruker 800-MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance room temperature probe. high-temperature torsion angle molecular dynamics starting from an extended conformation, slow-cooling torsion angle molecular dynamics, and (d) conjugate gradient minimization were set to the values derived from 1H and 13C chemical shifts. NOEs were classified as strong (2.7 ), medium (3.3 or 3.5 for amide protons), weak (5.0 ), and very weak (6.0 ). the reaction was quenched by adding 9 l of 2 m glycine, pH 7.4, for 10 min at room temperature and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. the library of 111 17-mer peptides corresponding to the H7 HA sequence was obtained from BEI Resources. VLP stocks normalized to p24 content were added to HEK 293T cells for 6 h. the cells were incubated for 24 h, and subsequent viral entry was quantified by luciferase activity. experimental conditions were 400 m PEP87 in 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 40% TFE-d in 10 or 60% 2H2O at 25 \u00b0C in 3-mm NMR tubes. spectrometer was equipped with a triple-resonance room temperature probe. a correction of 0.5 was added to proton distances involving methyl groups. the assigned chemical shifts, experimental restraints, final group of 15 low-energy structures were deposited as BMRB entry SMS21079. the authors reviewed the results and approved the final version of the manuscript."}
