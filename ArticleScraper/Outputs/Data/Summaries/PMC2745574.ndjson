{"summary": "anti-viral responses are initiated in infected cells, but act in an autocrine and paracrine fashion. the anti-viral state is distinguished by the expression of numerous IFN stimulated genes (ISG) which directly or indirectly interfere with both viral and host RNA transcription and translation. a novel aspect of the OAS/RNase L pathway is the cleavage of host RNA releasing free 3\u2032-monophosphates. recognition by these pattern recognition receptors initiates IFN- transcription, similar to the activation mediated by recognition of specific viral RNA structures. the anti-viral activity of the OAS/RNase L system has been studied in several virus infections in vitro and in vivo. coxsackievirus B4 was evident by significantly increased mortality rates of infected RL/ compared to wt mice. however, virus titers were only slightly elevated within pancreatic islet cells in vivo. a modest effect was observed in bone marrow derived macrophages. infections in vitro and in vivo induce upregulation of IFN-/ and anti-viral mediators, including PKR and OAS. however, the participation in the anti-viral response to CNS infection has not been elucidated. reduced viral replication via RNase L function in vivo was insufficient to prevent liver necrosis and death. RL/ mice did not reveal any impairment in IFN-/ induction, alterations in proinflammatory cytokines or inflammation compared to wt mice. this suggests a novel role of RNase L in specifically counteracting focal microglia/macrophage infection. levels of viral mRNA encoding the viral nucleocapsid protein were increased less than 2.4-fold in spinal cords of RL/ compared to wt mice at any time point. levels of viral mRNA encoding the viral nucleocapsid protein were increased less than 2.4-fold in spinal cords of RL/. MHV-JHM infection is not significantly altered by RNase L deficiency (n = 6/group) n = 6 levels of viral nucleocapsid protein encoding mRNA in the brains of infected mice. RNase L does not alter IFN responses to MHV-JHM infection. expression of IFN-4, IFN-1, OAS2, IFIT-1, IFIT-2 and IRF-7 mRNA relative to the housekeeping gene GAPDH in brains of MHV-JHM infected wt and RL/ mice. extent of inflammatory cells were observed by histochemical analysis. these data confirm that priming and trafficking of virus specific T cells was unaffected by the loss of RNase L activity. numbers and composition of CD45hi inflammatory cells derived from brains of infected wt and RL/ mice analyzed by flow cytometry at the indicated times p.i. limited infection of neurons within the brain with a predominance in the brain stem at day 5 p.i. in both RL/ and wt mice at day 7 p.i. by day 10 p.i. virus infected cells declined in cortex and brain stem of both wt and RL/ mice. however, in contrast to wt mice which had cleared virus from brain stem, virus infected cells were sustained in the brain stem of RL/ mice. al cells in brain stem at day 5 p.i. infection is controlled in wt mice. but foci of infected non neuronal cells with glia morphology are sustained in RL/ mice. oligodendrocyte apoptosis is linked to demyelinating process. brain stem infection and apoptosis in RL/ mice coincided with increased morbidity and mortality. demyelination is associated with a variable degree of axonal damage. primary immune mediated demyelination in the spinal cord during MHV-JHM infection coincides with early axonal degeneration. in spinal cords of wt mice, demyelination was also minimal at day 7 p.i. and increased by day 10 p.i. large focal areas of severe demyelination were already apparent in RL/ mice at day 7 p.i. spinal cords from RL/ mice showed small areas of apoptotic cells at 7 days p.i. by day 10 p.i. numerous apoptotic cells were evident in both white matter and grey matter of spinal cords from infected RL/ mice. however, by day 10 p.i. there was no evidence for neuronal apoptosis. a decrease in neurofilament and an increase in dystrophic axons within demyelinated lesions showed axonal integrity was already compromised in white matter of RL/ mice by day 7 p.i. spinal cords of RL/ mice showed marked axonal loss located in areas of myelin loss. a prominent difference in viral antigen positive cells was noted in spinal cord grey matter. a large number of infected cells in the grey matter of RL/ mice were identified as microglia and/or infiltrating monocytes based on co-localization with Iba-1 positive cells. virus infected cells detected using virus nucleocapsid protein specific mAb J.3.3 (Antigen - green) and macrophage/microglia cell marker Iba-1 (Iba-1 \u2013 red) in spinal cords from infected wt and RL/ mice at day 7 p.i. RNA levels for TNF were elevated in RNase L deficient microglia and monocytes by 2-fold and 1.4 fold. iNOS levels remained similar relative to wt derived cells. IFN relative to GAPDH mRNA levels in spinal cord were also modestly increased from 4.60.5 in wt mice to 8.10.3 in RL/ mice at the peak. infected RL/ mice, fewer microglia were activated based on their Iba-1 staining and morphology. inflammatory insults disrupt neuroprotective functions by microglia. inflammatory insults disrupt neuroprotective functions by microglia. mortality rates were significantly higher in RL/ mice, with over 90% succumbing to infection by 12 days p.i.. a minor role of RNase L in viral control in vivo was reminiscent of picornavirus models [8],[9],[11]. wt and RL/ mice infected with gliotropic MHV-JHM. data are representative of two independent experiments. bottom panel: Virus replication in the brains of infected mice is not significantly altered by RNase L deficiency (n = 6/group) Slightly enhanced IFN-/ and ISG expression was also observed in spinal cords from infected RL/ relative to wt mice. neither IFN-/ nor the expression of downstream ISGs were impaired at the tissue level. these data suggest that a positive RNase L-dependent feedback loop in propagating IFN-/ signalling is not activated during MHV-JHM infection in the CNS. no significant differences in the extent of inflammatory cells were observed by histochemical analysis. this data confirm that priming and trafficking of virus specific T cells was unaffected by the loss of RNase L activity. RNase L does not alter CNS inflammation, consistent with effective clearance of infectious virus. the distribution of virus infected cells was analysed by immunohistochemistry. a limited infection of neurons within the brain with a predominance in the brain stem at day 5 p.i. in both RL/ and wt mice. by day 10 p.i. virus infected cells declined in cortex and brain stem of both wt and RL/ mice. infected wt and RL/ mice at days 5 and 10 p.i. by day 10 p.i. infection is controlled in wt mice. foci of infected non neuronal cells with glia morphology are sustained in RL/ mice. totic cells, apoptotic cells were prominent in brain stems of RL/ mice. increased focal virus infection associated with substantially increased apoptotic cells presumably dysregulates neuronal function. however, there was no evidence that apoptotic cells are preferentially located adjacent to neurons. infected wt and RL/ mice at day 10 p.i. stained with Luxol Fast Blue (top panels) Scale bar = 100 m. note more abundant loss of myelin and axonal degeneration. in wt mice, apoptotic cells were undetectable in spinal cord at day 7 p.i. in white matter by day 10 p.i. numerous apoptotic cells were evident in both white matter and grey matter of spinal cords from infected RL/ mice. however, there was no evidence for neuronal apoptosis. axonal integrity was compromised in spinal cords of wt mice at day 7 p.i. a decrease in neurofilament and an increase in dystrophic axons within demyelinated lesions showed axonal integrity was already compromised. poptosis in grey matter in RL/ mice thus prompted a more detailed investigation of viral antigen distribution in spinal cords. neuronal infection was not observed in spinal cords of either RL/ or wt mice. however, a prominent difference in viral antigen positive cells was noted in spinal cord grey matter at day 7 p.i. the focal nature of infection in grey matter suggests microglia localization is associated with enhanced susceptibility to infection in the absence of RNase L. RNase L prevents spread of MHV-JHM to spinal cord grey matter. higher levels of viral RNA at day 7 p.i., while the relative levels in monocytes was only increased 1.6-fold relative to infected wt mice. however, viral mRNA levels decreased in both cell types reaching comparable levels by day 10 p.i. microglia in wt mice were activated based on their Iba-1 staining and morphology. fewer microglia were activated based on their Iba-1 staining and morphology. inflammatory insults disrupt neuroprotective functions by microglia. IFN-/-mediated anti-viral responses are critical for controlling MHV-JHM virus replication in the CNS. MHV-JHM infection of the CNS does not, or only sparsely. gliotropic MHV-JHM activates cellular RNA sensors in vivo. this is supported by Mda-5 triggered activation of the IFN-/ pathway in microglia and macrophages infected with MHV-A59 in vitro. neuronal infection by gliotropic MHV-JHM is sparse and only evident early p.i. in wt mice. no evidence for enhanced neuronal infection in RL/ mice thus suggested that the IFN-/ mediated anti-viral mechanisms in neurons are RNase L independent. microglia in wt mice exhibited a more ramified phenotype surrounding neurons compared to microglia in RL/ infected mice. it remains unclear whether abrogation of the proximal localization of microglia to neurons in RL/ spinal cords reflects an unknown function of an RNase L enhanced neuroprotective effect. both prolonged brain stem infection and enhanced spinal cord grey matter infection was associated with more severe demyelination and axonal damage infection in absence of RNase L may impair neuroprotective effects exerted by microglia under inflammatory conditions [34]\u2013[36]. enhanced infection of microglia may increase proinflammatory responses. however, only modest increases in IFN mRNA in spinal cord suggest these effects may only be apparent at a focal level. mice were infected at 6 weeks of age by intracranial injection with 250 PFU of the gliotropic MHV-JHM variant V2.2-1 [48] in 30 L endotoxin-free saline (DPBS) mice were perfused intracardially with 10 mL DPBS. the severity of clinical disease was graded as previously described. each mouse were homogenized in ice cold Tenbroeck glass grinders. supernatants were clarified by centrifugation for 7 min at 400g.
