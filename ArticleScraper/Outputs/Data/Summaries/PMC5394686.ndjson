{"summary": "people are assigned to three compartments based on their disease status at time t. the overall population in the model stays constant. Susceptibles (S) are those that are at risk of infection. the reproductive number, R0, is the number of secondary infections per primary infection. each method makes slightly different assumptions, and can result in different reproductive values. control measure effectiveness describes what fraction of individuals are removed from the susceptible population. 10% of the susceptible population is removed every day on and after the 5th day. the control measure is continuously applied at each time point after initiation. this assumes that the control is implemented with the same effectiveness throughout each time interval. the disease\u2019s incubation period is relatively short. the disease is an acute illness (i.e., infected individuals recover or die) this excludes chronic diseases like hepatitis. controlled or uncontrolled outcome 0.05\u20131.0 (days1) Both 0.05\u20135.0 (unitless) Controlled only Application to three diseases We applied this model to measles, norovirus, and influenza. outbreaks described here are solely person-to-person transmitted outbreaks. we selected a minimum control start of 3 days. we then selected upper bounds based on typical outbreak progression for each disease. we then selected one month (30 days) as the upper bound of. people are assigned to three compartments based on their disease status at time t. infected (I) are individuals experiencing the illness, and recovered persons (R) are now immune to the disease, or died as a result of the infection. 0 can be estimated a number of ways, including exponential growth, maximum likelihood, sequential bayesian and a time-dependent method. each method makes slightly different assumptions, and can result in different reproductive values. the control measure is continuously applied at each time point after initiation. 10% of the susceptible population are vaccinated each day for the remainder of the outbreak. this assumes that the control is implemented with the same effectiveness throughout each time interval. a majority of infections do not meet this assumption. the disease is an acute illness (i.e., infected individuals recover or die) this excludes chronic diseases like hepatitis. a controlled outbreak is compared to its counterfactual outbreak. controlled or uncontrolled outcome 0.05\u20131.0 (days1) Both 0.05\u20135.0 (unitless) Controlled only Application to three diseases We applied this model to measles, norovirus, and influenza. these diseases were selected because they are of public health interest. two small modifications were made to and such that they could be expressed as the infectious period (see equation (11)) and R0 (see equation (12) sensitivity analysis shows each parameter with respect to the cumulative number infected. values (shorter infectious periods) result in smaller outbreaks. large R0 values correspond to situations where the host can infect many other people, thus resulting in much larger outbreaks. individual scatterplots provide a cross section of possible outbreaks. rows hold ranges constant while columns hold ranges constant. each point denotes a counterfactual (i.e., a controlled outbreak within the given and ranges compared to an identical uncontrolled outbreak) there is a strong distinction between outbreaks with large values (upper 50th percentile) compared to outbreaks with small values. dividing the outbreaks into upper and lower 50th percentiles indicates this is actually only possible if both the and parameters fall into the lower 50th percentile and the control is at least 19% effective. for 0.01 (associated) All 7% (24) 5% (6) 5% (12) Smallest for 0.01 (associated) Lower 50% 7% (24) 6% (5) 6% (9) Smallest for 0.01 (associated) Upper 50% None 6% (5) 13% (5) These examples illustrate the possible use of models like this for decision support. a user interface was developed to facilitate widespread use of the model. a strong negative correlation with the cumulative number infected. large R0 values correspond to situations where the host can infect fewer people. large R0 values correspond to situations where the host can infect other people. individual scatterplots provide a cross section of possible outbreaks. each point denotes a counterfactual (i.e., a controlled outbreak within the given and ranges compared to an identical uncontrolled outbreak) the color indicated the score associated with the counterfactual trial. s that are large enough (minimum 5%) can consistently produce dramatic reductions in outbreak load. in table 3, we consider (1) the entire range, (2) the lower 50th percentile of both and values or (3) the upper 50th percentile of both and values. there is a strong distinction between outbreaks with large values compared to outbreaks with small values. a user interface was developed to facilitate widespread use of the model. output includes the smallest and largest SIR curves possible. output includes the effect of user control measures on those curves. the results suggest that it is reasonable to simultaneously explore the impact of a variety of control measures on outbreak progression in a number of scenarios using simple SIR models. we do so while using a range of outbreak parameters to understand the effects of both outbreak parameters and control efforts on outbreak progression. many variations of these models continue to maintain comparatively low computational requirements, while allowing for a better representation of reality. a related focus should be continued research on the impact of parameter selection on model outputs. the results indicate that variations in reproductive ratio produce exceedingly different outbreaks. validate counterfactual approach, provide additional data to describe when compartmental models are appropriate approximations of real world outbreaks. provide data to describe situations where compartmental models do not match real world outbreaks."}
