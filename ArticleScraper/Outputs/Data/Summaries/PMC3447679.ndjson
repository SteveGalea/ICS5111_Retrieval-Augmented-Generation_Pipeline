{"summary": "the predominant field isolates of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) have been classified as QX-like strains since 1996. there is an urgent need to develop novel vaccines that prevent QX-like IBV infection. despite intensive vaccination efforts, outbreaks of IBV frequently occur due to the persistence of different IBV serotypes. these serotypes arise from point mutations, insertions, deletions, and RNA recombination. despite the intensive vaccination efforts, both live and inactivated vaccines are commercially available. a recombinant rMDV (rMDV) expressing the S1 protein from QX-like IBV (rMDV-S1) was constructed. the protective efficacy of the virus as a vaccine against both IBV and MDV in SPF chickens was investigated. the recombinant viruses, rMDV-EGFP-S1 and rMDV-S1, were verified by a series of PCR reactions. the recombinant viruses, rMDV-EGFP-S1 and rMDV-S1, were verified by a series of PCR reactions. the results indicated that recombination occurred at the expected locus in the CVI988/Rispens genome. an expected 1.7-kb PCR product could be amplified from mRNA isolated from the rMDV-S1-infected CEFs but not from CVI988/Rispens-infected CEFs. rMDV-S1 was genetically stable after 30 sequential passages in CEFs. chickens with rMDV-S1, CVI988/Rispens, or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were challenged with IBV. no specific, anti-IBV antibodies were detected in vaccinated chickens. the rMDV-S1 virus could induce an IBV-specific immune response. the criteria for morbidity were as follows: (1) wheezing or dyspnea, (2) swinging of the head, and (3) feathers erected and dullness. from days 2 to 12 after challenge, tracheal swabs were collected for virus isolation from 10 randomly selected chickens from each group. the results indicated that the virus could be recovered from the rMDV-S1-vaccinated group from days 4 to 8.

RT-PCR verification of S1 gene expression in rMDV-S1-infected CEFs was also used. plaques of rMDV-S1 were immunologically stained with an IBV-specific antibody, whereas plaques of CVI988/Rispens were not. the rMDV-S1 virus was genetically stable after 30 sequential passages in CEFs. all deaths occurred within 3 to 5 days after challenge. chi-squared (2) test indicated there was a significant difference (p 0.05) between the rMDV-S1-vaccinated group and the PBS mock-vaccinated group. in the rMDV-S1-immunized group, the virus-shedding period was shorter than that of the control groups. rMDV-S1 0/10 a 10/10 a 4/10 a 1/10 a 0/10 a 0/10 a 2/19 a CVI988/Rispens 0/10 a 10/10 a 10/10 b 6/10 b 3/10 b 0/10 a 14/14 b PBS 0/10 DV-S1 49.5 0.8 a (n = 20) 259.6 10.9 a (n = 20) 433.0 29.8 a (n = 19) CVI988/Rispens 49.4 0.7 a (n = 20) 256.6 11.4 a (n = 20) 395.7 48.7 b (n = 14) PBS 49.5 1.1 a (n = 20) 258.8 10.9 a (n = 20) 391.6 5 chickens vaccinated with rMDV-S1 and those vaccinated with CVI988/Rispens did not show any clinical signs of MD and had no gross or histopathological tumors. rMDV-S1 vaccination could confer protection against MDV. 90% (18/20) of the chickens in the unvaccinated control group died of MD, and the remaining 2 chickens had histopathological lesions present at the time of necropsy. most of the recently described IBV isolates were from 9 distinct genetic groups. most of the recently described IBV isolates were from 9 distinct genetic groups. in china, the commonly used IBV vaccine strains are all Mass-type vaccines. the rMDV-S1 vaccinated group induced a low level antibody response until 4 weeks post-vaccination, but the level of antibody increased more rapidly compared to the control groups following IBV challenge. results suggest that rMDV-S1 immunization could induce an efficient primary immune response that was specific to the expressed S1 protein. the challenge dose was determined in a previous experiment in SPF chickens. this dose (2 103.5 EID50 per chicken) could induce clinical signs, including death. artificial Avr II and not I restriction sites allowed the direct cloning of a 1641-bp fragment of the resulting amplicon into the pUP/DOWN vector. this resulted in the plasmid pUP-LTR-EGFP-S1-DOWN plasmid in the same orientation as the S1 gene. the correct orientation of the insertion was confirmed by Hind III (New England BioLabs) digestion. ral plaques that expressed EGFP were identified by fluorescence microscopy (Leica DM RIB) these plaques were scraped from the monolayer using a micropipette containing a small amount of trypsin. cells were aspirated, trypsinized into a single cell suspension, and passaged repeatedly. the resulting intermediate recombinant virus rMDV-EGFP-S1 was then amplified in CEFs the binding site for Geno-F was located upstream of the left homologous arm. PLTR-R and S1-F2 were located in the LTR promoter and the S1 gene respectively. total cellular RNA was prepared using oligo (dT15) primers. rMDV-S1 or the CVI988/Rispens (100 PFU/well) vector was incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were fixed for 15 min with methanol-acetone (1:1) and incubated for 30 min. cells were washed three times for 5 min with PBS. chickens from each group were challenged by the ocular-nasal administration of 2 103.5 EID50 of the IBV CK/CH/JS/06II strain in 200 l PBS per chicken. any clinical disease symptoms, including death, beginning on day 2 post-challenge were recorded. allantoic fluid from the chicken embryos was collected and analyzed using RT-PCR as described above. the tissues were processed by standard histological procedures, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5-mm sections. all of the sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) differences in morbidity, mortality and virus-shedding period from the tracheal swaps and kidneys between each group were compared using the 2 test. the difference in body weight (means SE) between each group was analyzed by Student\u2019s t tests. plasmid pLTR-GFP contained the homologous sequence to the IRS-US junction region of the CVI988/Rispens genome. the plasmid pLTR-GFP contained a loxP-flanked EGFP expression cassette and a LTR promoter from REV. artificial Avr II and not I restriction sites allowed the direct cloning of a 1641-bp fragment of the resulting amplicon into the p the recombinant virus was produced by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection of secondary CEFs that were cultured in a 60-mm dish with 100 ng of the pUP-LTR-EGFP-S1-DOWN transfer vector. the transfected CEFs were cultured at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 5\u20137 days until viral plaques were visible. this process was repeated until all of the visible plaques were fluorescent. the resulting non-fluorescent rMDV, called rMDV-S1, was screened and purified as described above. PCR Identification of rMDV-S1 Primers S1-F and S1-R were used to amplify the inserted S1 gene from rMDV-S1. primer PLTR-F (5\u2032-ATCGGCATCAAGCAGG-3\u2032) was designed according the sequence of the LTR promoter in combination with the primer total cellular RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) after 48 hours of infection with either the rMDV-S1 or the CVI988/Rispens (100 PFU/well) vector. a positive control reaction using the transfer vector pUP-LTR-EGFP-S1-DOWN as the amplification template was performed. azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma-Aldrich) was analyzed by fluorescent microscopy (Leica DM RIB) genetic stability of rMDV The rMDV-S1 was sequentially passaged in CEFs to determine the genetic stability of the virus. IFAs were also applied to confirm the expression of the S1 gene in each passage. tracheal swabs were collected and used for virus isolation from 10 randomly selected chickens from each group. each chicken was weighed at 1-day-old, pre-challenge and at two weeks post-challenge. each chicken was weighed at 1-day-old, pre-challenge and at two weeks post-challenge. ted SPF chickens were examined for clinical signs of disease and mortality. the chickens that died after challenge were subjected to gross and histopathological observations for MD lesions in the liver, kidneys, spleen, nerves, and skin. authors\u2019 contributions XZ performed the laboratory experiments and drafted the manuscript.
