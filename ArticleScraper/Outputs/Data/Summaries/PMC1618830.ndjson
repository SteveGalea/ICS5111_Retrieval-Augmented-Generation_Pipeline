{"summary": "microbial movement in the united states has altered dramatically. microbial adaptation and change have contributed to disease emergence and re-emergence. avian flu is now on everyone's mind, but it is worth recalling the grim images. the first in-flight transmission of SARS occurred in a female flight attendant who caught it from a family of three Singaporeans incubating it on a flight between new york and Frankfurt on 14 March 2003. there was the pandemonium which broke when a certain 48-year-old man with symptoms of SARS was discovered to have flown on airhansa from Hong Kong to Munich, Barcelona, Frankfurt, London, Munich again, Frankfurt again, and back to Hong Kong. thermal scanners were first deployed in Singapore's Changi airport. it was an innovative application of military technology to address an urgent need. no one knows for sure what preventive measures all airlines and airports should adopt in order to mitigate spread of infectious diseases. a global battle plan against pandemic flu should entertain the notion of stopping the enemy. if only a few countries are affected, travel-related measures, such as exit screening for persons departing from affected areas, might delay international spread. if large numbers of cases occur, entry screening is unlikely to be effective in preventing or delaying an epidemic resulting from the importation of influenza. lz granderson: the aviation lessons of SARS have not led to an acceleration of scientific research and health policy evaluation. he says we are engaged in a millennia-old, interspecies struggle between man and microbes. granderson: we are engaged in a millennia-old, interspecies struggle between man and microbes. granderson: we are engaged in a millennia-old, interspecies struggle. in the coming epic battle against pandemic flu, the stakes have never been higher. if our strategies are to work, they must be reliably informed by accurate intelligence. the call is for more scientific research devoted to this critical front."}
