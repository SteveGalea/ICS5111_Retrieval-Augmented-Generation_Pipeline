{"summary": "44 children aged 0 to 24 months with febrile UTI and 35 age- and sex-matched controls with fever from other causes were enrolled in the study. ELISA was performed to determine the level of YKL-40 in urine collected from each child. eight of nine children in the control group with pyuria had urinary YKL-40/Cr levels lower than 125.23 pg/mg. YKL-40 is derived from the one-letter code for the first three N-terminal amino acids, tyrosine (Y), lysine (K), and leucine (L), and its molecular weight (40 kDa). it is expressed in a variety of cells, including primary immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils, chondrocytes, fibroblasts, and some cancer cells. urinalysis results are needed to determine the association between urinary YKL-40 and UTI in febrile young children. 79 children (age range, 2\u201324 months; 47 male and 32 female infants) who had a fever higher than 38\u00b0C were admitted to the department of pediatrics at the Catholic University of Korea. hematuria was defined when 5 red blood cells were detected in urinalysis. proteinuria was defined when a protein score +1 (+1 to +4) was obtained in urinalysis. all febrile patients with UTI underwent renal sonography and technetium 99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) imaging at the time of diagnosis. the standard curve range for the assay was 62.5\u20134,000 pg/mL. the detection limit for YKL-40 was 3.55 pg/mL. YKL-40 values below the detection limit were approximated to 1.775 pg/mL. the associations between urinary YKL-40 levels and clinical parameters were analyzed using Spearman's correlation coefficient r. 79 children (age range, 2\u201324 months; 47 male and 32 female infants) who had a fever higher than 38\u00b0C were admitted to the department of pediatrics at the Catholic University of Korea, Bucheon St. Mary's Hospital. hematuria was defined when a protein score +1 (+1 to +4) was obtained in urinalysis. all febrile patients with UTIs underwent renal sonography and technetium 99m-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) imaging at the time of diagnosis. YKL-40 values below the detection limit were approximated to 1.775 pg/mL. urinary concentrations of biomarkers, including urinary YKL-40, are proportional to the urinary flow rate for a given amount of an excreted biomarker. sex distribution, age, fever duration, body mass index (eGFR) and eGFR did not differ between the control and UTI groups. sex distribution, age, fever duration, body mass index (m/kg2) and eGFR did not differ between the control and UTI groups. eGFR was calculated using a revision of the Schwartz equation: 0.413 height (cm)/serum creatinine (mg/dL). eGFR was calculated using a revision of the Schwartz equation. urinary YKL-40/Cr values were significantly higher in the UTI group than in the control group. llP value for uYKL-40/Cr levels between children in the control group with pyuria. urinary YKL-40/Cr in the UTI and control groups were 783.83 pg/mg (132.62\u201318,015.0 pg/mg) and 15.30 pg/mg (7.01\u201325.28 pg/mg), respectively (P0.001) the levels of urinary YKL-40/Cr were significantly higher in children in the UTI group than in those in the control group who had pyuria. UC for both positive pyuria and positive nitrite was 0.693. no association was found with any other clinical parameters, including sex, BMI, eGFR, hematuria, proteinuria. uria 0.04 0.8 Proteinuria 0.12 0.44 Hydronephrosis 0.02 0.90 Photon defects in DMSA imaging 0.27 0.07 Vesicoureteral reflux 0.19 0.20 *eGFR was calculated using a revision of the Schwartz equation: 0.413 height (cm)/serum Cr; 5 red blood cells on urine microscopy; +1 to +4 protein in urinalysis. eight children (18% of UTI group and 33% of children undergoing VCUG) showed a photon defect in DMSA imaging. eight (18%) showed hydronephrosis in renal sonography. control UTI P N uYKL-40/Cr (pg/mg) Pyuria (+)* 9 21.36 (9.17\u2013120.69) 43 783.83 (132.62\u201318,015.0) 0.002 () 26 11.31 (7\u201321) 1 0.242ll Nitrite (+) 18 608.89 (164.17\u20136,831.89) 0.364 () 26 5147.75 (94.53\u20132,8040.25) Hematuri urinary YKL-40/Cr levels were significantly higher in children in the control group with pyuria than in those without pyuria. the median values of urinary YKL-40/Cr were 783.83 pg/mg (132.62\u201318,015.0 pg/mg) and 15.30 pg/mg (P0.001) the best cut-off value of 125.23 pg/mg for urinary YKL-40/Cr had a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 91.43%. the best cut-off value of 125.23 pg/mg for urinary YKL-40/Cr had a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 91.43%. hematuria, proteinuria, or abnormalities detected on imaging. urinary YKL-40/Cr levels were elevated in febrile young children with UTI compared with sex- and age-matched children with fever without UTI. urine culture is the standard test for detecting UTI [19]. it takes several days to obtain the results of urine culture for confirming an infection. treatment delayed by more than 48 hr may cause deleterious effects such as renal scarring. yKL-40 is involved in local inflammation by being produced and activated in the injured tissue. yKL-40 helps the bacteria to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells and invade the lamina propria, where it synergistically cooperates with IL-6. elevated tissue levels of YKL-40 have been observed in patients with osteoarthritis and with central nervous system and pulmonary infections. recently, urinary YKL-40 has been suggested as a marker for reflecting renal injury. this suggests that YKL-40 may be locally produced in injured tissues. urinary YKL-40 has a particular advantage for young children, because urine can be collected in a non-invasive manner. further studies are warranted to investigate the pathophysiological role of YKL-40 in the development of UTI."}
