{"summary": "the world health organization announced the occurrence of an outbreak of EVD in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) from April 4 through May 7, 21 suspected EVD cases were reported in Iboko and Bikoro, \u00c9quateur Province. on may 7, blood samples from five hospitalized patients had been sent to Kinshasa for Ebola-PCR testing, and two were confirmed PCR-positive. we used reported case counts during EVD outbreak in DRC and/or time series from 18 prior outbreaks to estimate the total outbreak size and duration with and without the use of vaccines. on may 27, 54 EVD cases (6 suspected, 13 probable and 35 confirmed) were reported in three locations. the final outbreak case count was 54 probable and confirmed cases (no suspected cases). we added suspected cases to create an additional projection using stochastic branching process model. wallinga-Teunis estimation works by defining a relative likelihood pij for each possible source j of a given case i: p i j = w ( t i \u2013 t j ) / k w ( t i \u2013 t k ) and then deriving from that an estimated reproduction number Rj for each case: R o e d, to each outbreak's R and d values. the filtration accepts epidemics within a range of 3 cases more or less than each recorded value. this one-step particle filtering technique produced an ensemble of model outbreaks, filtered on agreement with the recorded trajectory of the outbreak. we estimated that the percentage of reported cases in DRC would rise over time from a low of 68% to a high of 96%. the course of the outbreak with and without the vaccination program was modeled based on approximate dates available from situation reports. a simple regression model was conducted based solely on outbreaks of size 10 or greater. in the April-July 2018 outbreak, we observed cases over the period from April 4 to May 27 (day 0 to day 53) for the prior 18 outbreaks, linear interpolation was used to obtain the number of cases on day 34 (after reaching 10 cases) the final outbreak size was 54 probable and confirmed cases, so we identified the probability of this equivalent number (53) from each model, as of May 27. a stochastic branching process model, regression models, and Gott\u2019s law were used to generate projections. the wallinga-Teunis technique was used to estimate R for each case. the serial interval was defined as the interval between disease onset in an index case and disease onset in a person infected by that index case. the serial interval of EVD cases ranges from 3 to 36 days. transmission was modeled using a stochastic branching process model in which the number of secondary cases Si caused by any given primary case was drawn from a negative binomial distribution. the pair of parameters R0 and estimated for the different past outbreaks used, and dispersion parameter k, were used in all possible combinations to simulate outbreaks. the filtration accepts epidemics within a range of 3 cases more or less than each recorded value. this one-step particle filtering technique produced an ensemble of model outbreaks, filtered on agreement with the recorded trajectory of the outbreak to date. from 122,683,392 simulated outbreaks, 21,036 were retained after filtering. the simulated outbreaks that were retained after filtering were continued until they generated no further cases. a simple regression model was conducted based solely on outbreaks of size 10 or greater. we calculated the pseudologarithm transform f(x) = arcsinh(x/2), asymptotically logarithmic but well-behaved at 0. We used non-parametric Theil-Sen regression (R-package mblm) followed by calculation of the resulting prediction interval for a new observation. the median and 95% central coverage intervals for the prediction distribution conditional on the value being no smaller than the observed value on day 34. with the stochastic model, we projected outbreak size and duration of probable and confirmed cases. median outbreak size was 104.0 cases (mean 118.8; 95% prediction interval: 58.0, 271.0) and median duration was 121.0 days (mean 124.6; 95% prediction interval: 74.0, 187.0) distribution of outbreak projections from stochastic branching process model. Mean, median and 95% prediction interval of outbreak duration, by proportion of vaccine coverage, using probable and confirmed cases with and without suspected cases. the median estimate of outbreak size was 96.0 cases (95% CI: 49.0, 1920.0) of the probable and confirmed cases as of may 11, the median estimate of outbreak size was 68.0 cases (95% CI: 49.0, 1360.0). this outbreak still had the potential to become the largest outbreak in DRC since 2007. Vaccine use, regardless of coverage levels, was projected to prevent more than half of the total outbreak size. multiple models were used to estimate total outbreak size. there have been 22 observed EVD outbreaks with a case count greater than ten cases, but we were unable to include all prior outbreaks in our estimates due to data availability. the simple regression projection is based entirely on past outbreaks of EVD. the model that performed the best predicted total outbreak sizes close to the true outcome. in our stochastic model projections, vaccine use reduced mean total outbreak size by more than half, regardless of coverage levels. time-series of 18 prior Ebola outbreaks from 1976 to 2016 was depicted. click here for additional data file."}
