{"summary": "the main purpose of the present study was to investigate the anticancer effects of glycyrrhizinic acid in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. a clonogenic assay was used to study its effects on colony formation tendency. cancer accounts for around 7.5 million deaths and 12.6 million cases of the disease annually. the development of cancer takes place over years and encompasses multiple genetic and phenotypic modifications. breast cancer is responsible for 25% of all cancers found in women. glycyrrhiza glabra is an important medicinal plant with tremendous pharmacological activities which include neuroprotection, antimicrobial and anticancer activities. one of the active constituents, glycyrrhizinic acid, has not been evaluated against breast cancer [12]. the cytotoxic efficacy of glycyrrhizinic acid was evaluated by MTT assay [13], which is a colorimetric assay based on the reduction of yellow coloured MTT by succinate dehydrogenase. when MTT moves into the living cells, it gets reduced to insoluble formazan complex. the cells were seeded at 200 cells/well, then incubated for 24 h and then incubated for 50 min. cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a cell density of 2 106 cells per ml. the cells were harvested via trypsinization and then washed with PBS twice, resuspended and 250 l of binding buffer was added to the cells. the cells were then incubated for 30 min in the dark and finally the samples were observed by flow cytometry. glycyrrhizinic acid-treated cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS. lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 15 min and protein concentrations were estimated using a bio-Rad protein analyser. glycyrrhizinic acid (98% purity as certified by HPLC), Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide were procured from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA. an MTT kit was purchased from Roche (USA) the cells were seeded at 200 cells/well, then incubated for 24 h. the cells were then incubated for 72 h, then washed with PBS. apoptosis quantification was determined by Annexin V-FITC assay. the treated and untreated cells were triedpsinized, washed with cold PBS twice and then fixed using 70% methanol for 30 min. the cells were again washed with ice-cold PBS and then stained with 20 g/ml propidium iodide. the cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 15 min. the proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the membranes were then probed with specific antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight, then washed with buffered saline and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody. glycyrrhizinic acid has a dual effect \u2013 one on cell viability and another on colony formation. glycyrrhizinic acid induced significant apoptotic effects in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7). glycyrrhizinic acid-treated cells showed a high percentage of apoptotic cells. the percentage of apoptotic cells increased to 24.8%, 58.3% and 74.1% respectively. cells were treated with 0 (A), 10 (B), 50 (C) and 100 (D) doses of glycyrrhizinic acid for 48 h. cells were treated with 0 (a), 10 (b), 50 (c) and 100 (D) doses of glycyrrhizinic acid for 48 h. the cells were stained with PI and then examined by flow cytometry. glycyrrhizinic acid inhibited MCF-7 cell invasion. glycyrrhizinic acid targets m-TOR, PI3K/Akt pathways in human breast cancer cells. the cells were treated with 0, 10, 50 and 100 M doses of glycyrrhizinic acid. the results showed that glycyrrhizinic acid led to concentration-dependent as well as time-dependent. glycyrrhizinic acid has a dual effect \u2013 one on cell viability and another on colony formation. glycyrrhizinic acid led to reduction in the fraction of cancer cell colonies after the MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were treated with: a) 0 M, (b) 10 M, (c) 50 M and (d) 100 M of the drug for 48 h. glycyrrhizinic acid leads to apoptosis induction in human breast cancer cells. the cells were treated with 0 (A), 10 (B), 50 (C) and 100 (D) M doses of glycyrrhizinic acid for 48 h. glycyrrhizinic acid-treated cells with a 10, 50 and 100 M dose led to a 24.3%, 41.5% and 82.1% increase in the sub-G1 phase (apoptotic cells) cells. the percentage of G2/M cells also increased as the dosage of glycyrrhizinic acid increased. the cells were treated with 0 (a), 10 (b), 50 (c) and 100 M (d) doses of glycyrrhizinic acid for 48 h. glycyrrhizinic acid could modulate the protein expression of the m-TOR/PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. chemotherapies are severe side effects and chemo-resistance. glycyrrhizinic acid, also known as glycyrrhizin, is a triterpene saponin. it has been shown to inhibit liver cell injury and is given to patients suffering from chronic or viral hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. glycyrrhizinic acid induced both early and late apoptosis in these cells. this compound induced sub-G1 cell cycle arrest and led to a significant increase of sub-G1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. glycyrrhizinic acid-treated cells showed downregulation of m-TOR and pm-TOR proteins. it also showed downregulation of PI3K/Akt protein expression. authors declare no conflict of interest."}
