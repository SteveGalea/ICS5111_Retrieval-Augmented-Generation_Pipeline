{"summary": "a few broad neutralization epitopes identified so far are present on the surface of native HIV-1 envelope spikes. however, HIV-1 envelope spikes also contain transiently-exposed neutralization epitopes, which are more difficult to identify. scFvs are targeted to lipid rafts of plasma membranes. hiv-1 envelope spike is a trimeric complex consisting of three non-covalently linked heterodimers of gp120 and gp41. gp120 mediates cell attachment, receptor and co-receptor binding. gp41 mediates viral and cell membrane fusion, which is critical for viral core to enter target cells. co-receptor binding results in further conformational changes. epitopes that are hidden from or not totally exposed on the surface of native spike are transiently exposed and become accessible to antibodies specific for these transiently-exposed epitopes. some of these epitopes are also neutralization epitopes. gp41 mediated fusion is triggered by interaction between the second and the first heptad repeats. it is reported that expressing a peptide derived from the HR2 domain exhibits greater inhibitory effect on HIV-1. however, it is not clear whether transiently-exposed epitopes on HIV-1 envelope spikes other than that resides in the HR2 domain can also be captured by cell-surface expressed scFvs. scFvs derived from seven different human monoclonal antibodies AB31, AB32, TG15, 4E10, 48d, X5 and AB65. AB65 recognizes the influenza hemagglutinin used here as negative control. AB31 recognizes cluster III determinant of gp41 and AB32 interacts with gp120. scFv (X5) exhibits extremely potent and broad neutralization activity against multiple clades of HIV-1 strains tested. expression of scFv in lipid raft of plasma membrane confers long-term resistance to HIV-1 infection, HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion and the infection of HIV-1 captured and transferred by human DCs. lentiviral vectors pRRL-scFv/hinge/his-tag/DAF and pRRL-scFv/hinge/his-tag/DAF were derived from seven human monoclonal antibodies AB31, AB32, TG15, 48d, X5 and AB65. scFvs/hinge/his-tag/DAF and scFvs/hinge/his-tag/DAF were detected in cell lysates and culture supernatants using anti-his-tag and anti-tubulin antibodies. scFvs were only detected in cell lysates, but not in culture supernatants. m-scFv-transduced cells are co-localized with GM1 on cell surface. scFv/hinge/his-tag/DAF is similar to those of scFvs. the expression of transgenes does not alter the expression of the receptor and the coreceptors for HIV-1 in transduced TZM.bl cells. a retroviral envelope 10A1 pseudotype was used to infect transduced TZM.bl cells in a single-round infection experiment. compared to mock-transduced cells, cells transduced with secretory scFv showed low degree of neutralization activity against 3 of 11 HIV-1 pseudotypes. cells transduced with secretory scFv showed low degree of neutralization activity against all 11 HIV-1 pseudotypes tested. cells transduced with GPI-scFv (48d) neutralized all 11 HIV-1 pseudotypes with great degree of potency compared to cells transduced with secretory scFv (4E10). cells transduced with clades A, B, B' and E neutralized all 11 HIV-1 pseudotypes with great degree of potency. scFvs on wild type HIV-1 infection in secretory scFv-transduced TZM.bl. compared to mock-transduced cells, cells transduced with all secretory scFvs did not show significant neutralization activity against any of these HIV-1 strains tested. potent inhibition of HIV-1 by GPI-scFv (X5) does not require additional sCD4. binding and neutralizing capability of scFv (X5) can be greatly enhanced by adding soluble extracellular domains of human CD4 (sCD4) sCD4 enhances inhibition by secretory scFv (X5); scFv (X5) exhibits the greatest potency of inhibition, which is totally independent of addition of sCD4. sCD4: soluble, extracellular domains of human CD4; w/o or w/sCD4: with or without pre-incubation with sCD4. the expression of secretory and GPI-scFvs as well as CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 in transduced CEMss-CCR5 cells was tested by western blot and immune staining followed by FACS analysis. transduced CEMss-CCR5 cells were then infected with HIV-1 strains Bru-3 and Bru-Yu2 at multiple of infection of 0.01. secretory scFv (X5) confers long-term resistance to HIV-1 Bru-Yu2 in human CD4+ T cells. sec-AB65: CEMss-CCR5 cells transduced with secretory scFv. cell morphology 20 hours after coculturing tetracycline-treated 69TiRevEnv cells with CEMss-CCR5-GPI-scFv (AB65). cell morphology 20 hours after coculturing tetracycline-treated 69TiRevEnv cells with CEMss-CCR5-GPI-scFv (X5). 69TiRevEnv cells contain a pLAI3 gene under a Tet-off promoter. binding of tetracycline to tTA causes conformational change of tTA. tTA blocks tTA binding to the Tet-off promoter and prevents HIV-1 envelope protein expression. monocyte-derived human DCs were incubated with HIV-1 NL4-3. cells were then washed extensively to remove free viruses. infected DCs were then co-cultured with GPI-scFv (X5 and AB65) transduced CEMss cells. transducing parental CEMss-CCR5 cells and CEMss-CCR5 with VSV-G pseudotypes results in similar vector dose-dependent transduction efficiency and transgene expression. the GPI-scFv (X5) does not inhibit the VSV G envelope-mediated viral entry, reverse transcription, integration, or postintegration protein expression of HIV-1 vector. fusion genes scFv/IgG3 hinge/his-tag/DAF and scFv/IgG3 hinge/his-tag were inserted into a third generation lentiviral vector pRRL. the recombinant viruses were then generated as described before [38] and used to transduce TZM.bl cells and human CD4+ T cells CEMss and CEMss-CCR5. scFvs/hinge/histag/DAF were detected in cells with or without PI-PLC treatment. cells transduced with m-scFv(TG15)-transduced TZM.bl cells were treated with or without phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. all scFv/hinge/his-tag/DAFs express highly on cell surface. expression was substantially reduced with PI-PLC treatment. no reduction in cell surface expression of scFv was observed in m-scFv-transduced cells. cells were seeded into wells of cover slip chambers and cultured overnight. cholera toxin subunit B (CtxB); and 3) DAPI. both GPI-scFvs (AB65 and X5) are co-localized with GM1 on cell surface. they are located in the lipid raft of the plasma membrane. retroviral envelope 10A1 recognizes either Ram-1 or Glvr-1 as a receptor for cell entry. the eleven HIV-1 pseudotypes consist of HIV-1 envelopes derived from clade A (Q168), clade B (HxBc2, JF-RL, ADA, AD8, Yu2 and consensus B), clade B' (CNE11), clade C (Mj4 and CNE17) and clade E (CNE8). cells transduced with GPI-scFv (AB32) neutralized 2 of 11 HIV-1 pseudotypes. cells transduced with TG15 neutralized 8 of 11 HIV-1 pseudotypes. clades A, B, B' and E, but not clades C and E. scFvs on transduction efficiency of HIV-1 and 10A1 pseudotypes into secretory scFv-transduced TZM.bl. compared to mock-transduced cells, cells transduced with all secretory scFvs did not show significant neutralization activity against any of these HIV-1 strains tested. cells transduced with GPI-scFv (AB32 and TG15) neutralized 2 HIV-1 strains (Bru-3, and Bru-Yu2) with a low degree of potency; cells transduced with GPI-scFv (48d) neutralized 4 viruses including one clinical quasispecies (Bru-3, Bru-Yu2, AD8 and JS-JCD) with various degree of potency. pre-incubation of 400 and 4,000 TCID50 of these two HIV-1 strains with sCD4 greatly enhances inhibition in cells transduced with secretory scFv (X5). sCD4 enhances inhibition by secretory scFv (X5); scFv (X5) exhibits the greatest potency of inhibition, which is totally independent of addition of sCD4. human CD4+ cell line CEMss was first transfected with a retroviral vector expressing human CCR5. after stable CEMss-CCR5 cells were established, they were further transduced with secretory and GPI-scFv (X5 and AB65) the expression of secretory and GPI-scFvs as well as CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 in transduced CEMss-CCR5 cells was tested -1 replication was as robust as secretory scFv (AB65) and GPI-scFv (AB65) controls. by contrast, for cells transduced with secretory scFv (X5) and infected with HIV-1 Bru-Yu2, robust HIV-1 replication was observed in the first 6 days and slowly dropped to the undetectable level on day 51 and thereafter. gp120 and gp41 antibodies in 69 T1RevEnv cells without treatment of tetracycline stained with anti-HIV-1 gp41 antibody. cell morphology 20 hours after coculturing tetracycline-treated 69TiRevEnv cells with CEMss-CCR5-GPI-scFv (X5). GPI-scFv (X5) blocks HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion. co-culturing cells with 69TiRevEnv cells results in cell-cell fusion. fusion begins after 6 hours and peaks at 20 hours. 69TiRevEnv cells were incubated with etracycline-untreated 69TiRevEnv cells. the experiment was repeated twice with similar results. thus, these data demonstrated that GPI-scFv (X5) completely inhibits HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion. eGFP expression in parental CEMss-CCR5 cells and CEMss-CCR5 transduced with VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 vector. eGFP expression in parental CEMss-CCR5 cells and CEMss-CCR5 expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) as described before [23]. ally linking scFvs with GPI-attachment signal scFvs is expressed in the lipid raft of plasma membrane through a GPI anchor (Figure 1 and 2). ally linking scFvs with scFvs is expressed in the lipid raft of plasma membrane through a GPI anchor (Figure 1 and 2). ally linking scFvs with scFvs neutralizes HIV-1 with various degrees of breadth and pot 6 anti-HIV-1 gp120 or gp41 GPI-scFvs tested showed wide spectrum of breadth and potency against 11 HIV-1 pseudotypes and 6 wild type HIV-1 strains tested. at one end of the spectrum, GPI-scFv (AB31) does not show significant neutralization activity against any of these HIV-1 viruses. amino acid residues 417 to 434 reside in 19, 20 and 21 of the gp120 core. without adding sCD4, 19 and 20/21 are away from each other, the 19 is covered by V3 loop and the 20/21 is partially covered by V1/V2 loop. the underlying mechanism of great potency of GPI-scFv (X5) remains to be elucidated. it is plausible to develop GPI-scFvs into a standard approach for identifying antibodies that recognize transiently-exposed epitopes on HIV-1 envelope spike. the entry of many enveloped viruses requires cholesterol in the target cell membrane. development of GPI-scFvs that recognize transiently-exposed epitopes on HIV-1 envelope spike exhibit various degrees of breadth and potency. titers were determined by end-point titration on TZM.bl cells.
