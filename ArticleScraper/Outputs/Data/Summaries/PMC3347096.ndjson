{"summary": "pathogens carrying the plasmid blaNDM-1 are known for their high rates of resistance to carbapenems. blaNDM-1 was reported worldwide within 6 months. blaNDM-1 was mostly found among Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (6, 18) the recently developed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method requires only a temperature-controlled water bath. it is based on autocycling strand displacement DNA synthesis in presence of Bst DNA polymerase within 1 h (19, 29) the LAMP method was evaluated and optimized for blaNDM-1 detection. four or six specific primers that recognize six or eight different sequences on the DNA target are used. the bacterial pellet was mixed with an equal volume of Chelex DNA extraction buffer. the mixture was incubated at 100\u00b0C for 10 min and then immediately placed on ice. the supernatant was used as the template in both the LAMP assay and PCRs (17). e 5732 Our microorganism center V. parahaemolyticus 5474 Our microorganism center Enteroinvasive E. coli 44825 Our microorganism center Enterotoxigenic E. coli 44824 Our microorganism center Preparation of pure culture. a 200-l sample from an overnight culture of bacteria was subjected to centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. the sequence of blaNDM-1 with accession number FN396876 was downloaded from the NCBI GenBank database. the outer forward primer (F3), outer backward primer (B3), forward inner primer (FIP) and backward inner primer (19) were designed to accelerate the amplification reaction. PCRs were carried out with 25-l reaction mixtures containing 12.5 l PCR master mix reagents. the reaction was initially carried out at 94\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. blaNDM-1 was located on the chromosome by analysis of the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profile and Southern blot hybridization. these bacteria were cultured at 37\u00b0C in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth according to a standard protocol. the Chelex method was used to extract the bacterial whole genomic DNA (including plasmid) from 1,070 ng/l to 0.107 pg/l.

PCRs were carried out with 25-l reaction mixtures containing 12.5 l PCR master mix reagents. the reaction was carried out at 65\u00b0C for 50 min and inactivated at 80\u00b0C for 5 min in dry bath incubators. the reaction was initially carried out at 94\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. PCR-amplified products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel (Amresco) electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. amplification of blaNDM-1 Primer Type Sequence (5\u2032\u20133\u2032) CJXJ1F3 Forward outer GCATAAGTCGCAATCCCCG CJXJ1FIP Forward inner CTGGCGGTGGTGACTCACGTTTTGCATGCCTGGAC CJXJ1BIP. to test the specificity of LAMP for blaNDM-1, we used A. baumannii XM with blaNDM-1 as the positive strain and distilled the template and not with the negative control (double-distilled water) and other bacterial species, including A. baumannii H949, A. baumannii F398, A. baumannii B260, A. baumannii H18, S. sonnei 2531, S. flexneri 4536, S. enterica serotype Enteritidis 50326-1, enterotoxigenic E. coli 44824, enteropathogenic E. primers in LAMP detection of blaNDM-1, pure genomic DNA was extracted from A. baumannii XM using a Wizard genomic DNA purification kit. the genomic DNA was subject to serial 10-fold dilutions to give concentrations ranging from 1,070 ng/l to 0.107 pg/l. blaNDM-1 was monitored by a loopamp real-time turbidimeter at 400 nm every 6 s. 1 l of fluorescent detection reagent was added to 25 l of LAMP reaction mixture. the PCR products were analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. s of the blaNDM-1 genes showed 100% identity with those of previously reported genes. blaNDM-1 is on the chromosome in A. lwoffii SJH, S. maltophilia JKYJ-01, and E. faecalis PIJ. further experiments are in progress to investigate molecular nature of these strains. Turbidity was monitored by a Loopamp real-time turbidimeter at 400 nm every 6 s. assays with the CJXJ1 and CJXJ2 primer sets were performed with Loop primers. assays with the other sets were performed without Loop primers. the increased turbidity curve appeared only when A. baumannii XM with blaNDM-1 was used as the template and not with the negative control. a loopamp real-time turbidimeter was performed at 65\u00b0C for 65 min. pure genomic DNA was extracted from A. baumannii XM using a wizard genomic DNA purification kit. the genomic DNA was subject to serial 10-fold dilutions to give concentrations ranging from 1,070 ng/l to 0.107 pg/l. the blaNDM-1 analysis with the LAMP assay was then further evaluated with sputum, urine, and fecal samples. the sensitivity for the simulated samples was unchanged (10.70 pg/l) blaNDM-1 is on the chromosome in A. lwoffii SJH, S. maltophilia JKYJ-01, and Enterococcus faecalis PIJ. these three strains were resistant to carbapenems, cephalosporins, and the -lactam inhibitor combinations tested and susceptible to colistin. blaNDM-1 is a new mobile class B enzyme or metallo-lactamase. it has added to the antibiotic resistance problem. the majority of cases have been reported in India (14) and Pakistan (23) PCR primers recognize target sequences of two independent regions. the sensitivity of the PCR can be greatly reduced in the presence of exogenous DNA and inhibitors. the sensitivity of the PCR can be greatly reduced in the presence of exogenous DNA."}
