{"summary": "ARTIs are the leading cause of childhood mortality, contributing to approximately 1.7 million and 1.5 million deaths in 1998 (1) and 2008 (2). more than 10 years ago, van den Hoogen and coworkers identified and characterized a novel virus classified within the Paramyxoviridae family that was accountable for an important fraction of ARTIs affecting children globally. HMPV is the second most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children 5 years of age. retrospective surveillance studies further confirmed that HMPV infections caused a significant fraction (5 to 20%) of ARTIs that were previously considered to have an unknown cause. about 35% of transplanted patients infected with HMPV can develop accelerated cellular rejection characterized by bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and chronic allograft dysfunction (23), suggesting that HMPV can potentiate cellular immunity to unrelated antigens. at least two independent studies have shown that in various proportions of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases, coinfection by SARS coronavirus and HMPV was confirmed (24, 25) in healthy adults, experimental infection with HMPV produces symptoms including headaches, nasal congestion, pharyngitis, cough, hoarseness, cervical lymphadenopathy, and recurrence of herpes labialis. most other cases have been reported for children ranging from 4 months to 5 years of age (37\u201346). a case of refractory status epilepticus and encephalitis in a 4-month-old infant was recently reported (44). a case of refractory status epilepticus and encephalitis in a 4-month-old infant also presented an ARTI positive for HMPV but not for other common respiratory pathogens was recently reported (44). severe respiratory infections requiring ICU admission have also been reported for healthy adults with no comorbidities or underlying diseases. disease severity, which is measured as the degree of respiratory involvement, is strongly correlated with HMPV loads in young children (56\u201358) there is no conclusive evidence to support any association of viral genetics with HMPV virulence and disease severity. the high degree of genetic variability in HMPV surface glycoproteins may shape herd immunity and favor reinfections with distinct HMPV genotypes over time. globally, HMPV is recognized as the second most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children 5 years of age. retrospective surveillance studies further confirmed that HMPV infections caused a significant fraction (5 to 20%) of ARTIs that were previously considered to have an unknown cause. 35% of transplanted patients infected with HMPV can develop accelerated cellular rejection characterized by bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. at least two independent studies have shown that in various proportions of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases, ranging from 22 to 50%, coinfection by SARS coronavirus and HMPV was confirmed. HMPV can produce asymmetric, acute interstitial pneumonia and bronchitis in immunocompromised adults. in healthy adults, experimental infection with HMPV produces symptoms including headaches, nasal congestion, pharyngitis, cough, hoarseness, cervical lymphadenopathy, and recurrence of herpes labialis. a case of refractory status epilepticus and encephalitis in a 4-month-old infant was recently reported. a case of refractory status epilepticus and encephalitis in a 4-month-old infant who also presented an ARTI positive for HMPV but not for other common respiratory pathogens was recently reported. severe respiratory infections requiring ICU admission have also been reported for healthy adults with no comorbidities or underlying diseases. disease severity, which is measured as the degree of respiratory involvement, is strongly correlated with HMPV loads in young children. there is no conclusive evidence to support any association of viral genetics with HMPV virulence and disease severity. however, due to several factors, such as herd immunity, the association of viral genetics with disease incidence and severity must be carefully analyzed. the virion has a highly electron-dense envelope in which the viral glycoproteins relevant for target cell recognition and infection are embedded. the viral nucleocapsid encapsulates a 13.3-kb, nonsegmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome (viral RNA [vRNA]) containing eight genes, each of which is delimitated by gene start (GS) and gene end (GE) sequences that define the transcription of HMPV genes develops in a linear, sequential, stop-restart process (83, 84) because of this stop-restart process and the chances of the transcriptase-replicase polymerase disassociating during transcription restart. mRNA synthesis from genes closer to the 3\u2032 promoter is more efficient than that from distal genes (84). each gene is flanked by two conserved sequences, which are referred to as the gene start (GS) and gene end (GE) sequences. the TR complex stops at each GE to restart transcription in the following GS sequence (84). the HMPV phosphoprotein (P) is expected to be pivotal for the assembly of the HMPV TR complex in a manner similar to that of its HRSV counterpart. the HMPV P and N proteins interact and form cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in infected cells. the viral matrix (blue) encapsulates the nucleoprotein-associated genome (yellow-green) or nucleocapsid of HMPV. the ribonucleoprotein complex is associated with the L protein (yellow), along with its cofactors. the HMPV M2-1 protein is an additional cofactor for the TR complex. the M2-2 protein is recognized as a key negative modulator of viral transcription and replication, as indicated by the accumulation of mRNAs in M2-2 mutants. the M2-2 protein maintains polymerase fidelity, as evidenced by the increased mutation frequencies in M2-2 mutants (85, 98, 102) the production of avian metapneumovirus-like particles is a process that is dependent on the coexpression of and interaction among M, N, and fusion (F) proteins. a conserved arginine-glycine-aspartate motif on the F protein favors binding to multiple RGD binding integrins that participate in both attachment and fusion to target cells. a recent report showed that HMPV is internalized by using the endocytic pathway through a mechanism dependent on clathrin and dynamin and fuses with endosomal membranes without requiring acidification of the endosomal compartment. the role of G in adhesion has been majorly inferred from its comparison to its HRSV orthologue. experimental evidence further supports the role of F as the dominant neutralizing antigen and the conversely poor protective role of G and SH 127. some negative modulatory proteins have endowed HMPV with mechanisms to efficiently replicate in target cells in face of activated IFN responses. multiple focal lesions in which inflammation of the lung parenchyma is associated with the presence of HMPV proteins have been reported (133), suggesting that (i) the activation of host immunity is delimited to regions of virus replication and (ii) the degree of respiratory involvement is strongly correlated with viral spread in the respiratory tract. HMPV replicates in different types of AECs, including those from the bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. at a lower frequency, HMPV infects alveolar macrophages (AMs) (133), which are an important myeloid cell population that controls inflammation and immune homeostasis in the lungs. two major pathways for the secretion of type I IFNs in cultured cells have been described. each pathway involves different pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) the first pathway involves two helicases from the RIG-I-like receptor family, RIG-I and MDA5. MAVS then activates downstream IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). products of viral replication, including cytosolic dsRNAs and uncapped 5\u2032-triphosphates present in the genomic RNA, activate RLRs. the second pathway involves TLR3 (in most cells) and TLR7 (more important in pDCs) in plasmacytoid DCs, IRF7 is constitutively expressed and contributes to the generation of stronger TLR7-triggered type I IFN responses (157). TLR7 is the major PRR mediating HMPV sensing in pDCs, whereas MDA5-MAVS is the major pathway sensing. this suggests that type I IFN signaling contributes minimally to HMPV clearance in mice (159) ifnar/ mice lead to preferential expansion of PD-L1-expressing AMs and impaired function of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. results obtained from studies using either IFNAR or MAVS/IRF3/IRF7 knockout mice may be related to the elimination of IFNAR. the elimination of MAVS/IRFs has broader deleterious effects, including an impaired production of proinflammatory cytokines and a different class of IFNs. gene modified mouse models have yielded strong evidence supporting the notion that the activation of RLR surveillance systems and their coupled transcription factors, IRF3 and IRF7, is a crucial mechanism that modulates paramyxoviral infection-elicited pathogenesis and T cell responses. authors: viral mechanisms also interfere with signal transduction downstream of IFNRs. the HMPV proteins impair the sensing of viral RNAs and other virus-associated molecular patterns via various synergizing strategies. Specifically, M2-2 promotes the global evasion of TLR surveillance in monocyte-derived DCs. phosphoprotein of HMPV B1 impairs recognition of viral 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA. these proteins endow HMPV with synergizing mechanisms that favor early viral dissemination in the face of IFN and proinflammatory cytokine secretion. TSLP and IL-33 are key activators of type 2 innate cells (nuocytes) (172), respectively. CCL2 is a chemoattractant for TH17 cells, monocytes, and plasmacytoid DCs. CCL3 and CCL4 both recruit and activate neutrophils under acute inflammatory conditions. s are key pulmonary sentinels that orchestrate the rapid influx of immune cells to restrain HMPV dissemination in the respiratory tract. DCs secrete IL-6, which negatively modulates regulatory T (Treg) cell responses and promotes immune responses that are dependent on effector helper T cells and CTLs. th1 cells (during the first 7 dpi) and TH2 cells (after 10 dpi) form perivascular infiltrates. most cytokines that either impair viral clearance (IL-10) or promote and prolong airway inflammation are secreted. pDCs contribute to viral clearance by secreting type I IFNs. most chemokines found in HMPV-infected mice are chemoattractants for neutrophils, monocytes, and T cells. TSLP is strongly upregulated in mouse lungs during the acute phase of infection (24 h postinfection), thus implicating a possible role of this molecule in the pathogenesis of lung hyperresponsiveness (138). the diminished pathology in mice is accompanied by reduced neutrophil infiltration and reduced viral replication in the lungs. a similar reduction in HMPV replication was found in neutrophil-depleted wild-type mice, suggesting that neutrophils are potential targets for infection. Maturation is a physiological mechanism by which activated DCs upregulate a number of membrane-bound molecules participating in the assembly of the IS and the activation of T cells (200) mature DCs secrete cytokines with the capacity to skew the commitment of T cells toward phenotypes contingent on the threat sensed. s to prime T cells has unraveled potential viral mechanisms leading to suboptimal adaptive immunity against HMPV. different groups agree that this maturation response is rather modest to poor (144\u2013147) HRSV induces stronger cytokine response in human and mouse DCs. also, HRSV induces a more marked expression of maturation markers. compared to HMPV, human parainfluenza virus type 3-infected DCs show strong upregulation of CD80 and strong secretion of chemokines. impairment of naive T cell priming is dependent on infection of DCs by HMPV. inhibition of CD4+ T cell priming occurs even at lower multiplicities of infection of DCs (145) soluble factors secreted by HMPV-infected DCs in absence of interference with immunological synapse formation (T cell Golgi apparatus polarization) memory CD4+ T cells by interfering with the assembly of the immunological synapse (123) the impairment of synapse assembly is related to the impediment of TCR complex (TCRc) recruitment to the DC-T cell interface either via the effects of binding of G and SH to key molecules of the synapse or by reducing the density of new antigenic pMHCs. infection of monocyte-derived DCs with HMPV impairs activation of autologous memory CD4+ TH cells. infection of monocyte-derived DCs with HMPV impairs activation of autologous memory CD4+ TH cells, suggesting that G and SH are key virulence factors. HRSV nucleoprotein (210), corroboration of immunological synapse inhibition, and molecular mechanisms causing reduced accumulation of CD3 would require functional assays using supported lipid bilayers loaded with antigenic pMHCs. impairment of DC function by HMPV may explain the development of suboptimal immunological memory and susceptibility to reinfection in humans. only 35% of experimentally infected adults mount a detectable antibody response. inefficient B cell immunity to infection may originate from alteration of immunological processes. an HMPV-specific memory CD8+ T cell repertoire is reactive to most viral proteins. TH cells and CTLs cooperate to clear the virus from the airways and also promote lung pathology during the primary immune response of naive animals to HMPV. TH cells, more than CD8+ CTLs, are key components in the pathogenic response to HMPV in mice (220). this suggests helper T cells generate an immunological milieu that is deleterious for proper cytotoxic activity. tslpr/ mice showed an increased infiltration of TH cells and CTLs in the lungs and a significant reduction in viral replication. the immunological milieu elicited by infection with HMPV significantly influences the effector response of virus-specific CTLs and the development of pulmonary pathology. the aberrant adaptive antiviral immunity that is elicited by primary infection of BALB/c mice is depicted by the generation of suboptimal humoral immunity that fails mice, cotton rats, ferrets, hamsters, and nonhuman primates support HMPV replication in the lungs and develop ARTIs, with various degrees of susceptibility (97, 98, 103, 127, 138, 225\u2013231) the mouse model of infection has yielded the majority of evidence regarding potential pathophysiological mechanisms related to HMPV lung disease. mice replicate the pulmonary pathology of humans in several aspects, including histopathology, the secretion of inflammatory mediators, and the recruitment of immune cells. human disease severity is associated with age and viral load in lungs, mice replicate human disease in the face of modest viral replication and also replicate age-related immunological deficiencies. inducer of protecting TH2-type antibodies 236 Deletion of M2-1 and M2-2 genes Hamster Immunogenic inducer of protecting TH2-type antibodies 85 Deletion of SH, G, and M2-2 genes Primates Immunogenic inducer of protecting TH2-type antibodies 103 Removal of carbohydrate moiety of F protein BALB/c mice Immunogenic inducer of protecting TH2-type antibodies 242 Chimeric constructions Replacement of N and P genes for heterologous genes from an avian strain Primates H2-Kb TCD8, CTLs, IFN- secretion Experimental infection 160 N164\u2013172 VGALIFTKL Mouse; H-2Kd CTLs, IL-12 and IFN- secretion Peptide immunization 245 N198\u2013206 YPRMDIPKI Mouse; B7tg (restricted to HLA-B*0702) Splenocytes, IFN- secretion Experimental infection 160 M12\u201320 IPYTAAVQ several histopathological changes occur in the lungs of infected humans and mice. alterations include damage of the respiratory epithelial architecture, sloughing of epithelial cells, hyaline membrane formation, loss of ciliation, and exacerbated mucus production. infection of airway epithelial cells (AECs) is the first important process that occurs in the course of the acute phase of infection. infection of airway epithelial cells (AECs) is the first important process that occurs in the course of the acute phase of infection. studies show infection of cultured human and mouse conventional DCs with a restrictive/abortive replication cycle and limited viral shedding. AMs, AMs, and DCs are thought to be the major populations that sense HMPV in the acute course of infection and therefore are critical components mediating airway inflammation. downstream IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activates type I IFN secretion, IRF7 upregulation, and NF-B, inducing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and type III IFNs. the second pathway for sensing HMPV involves endosomal toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and TLR7 (155, 156) HMPV proteins impair sensing of viral RNA species through inhibition of RIG-I- and MAVS-dependent signaling (154, 155). the G protein of HMPV has been proposed to interact with and abrogate signaling through TLR4 (158, 168) pDCs use a redundant mechanism to sense HMPV. this involves the engagement of TLR4 on the surface of DCs. this mechanism does not require viral replication as does sensing of HMPV. a more significant role in HMPV clearance and pathogenesis has been described in mouse neonates. MAVS/IPS-1 and IRF3/7 are factors upstream of IFNAR signaling. infected human AECs upregulate IFN-1 to -4. banos-Lara and coworkers used blocking antibodies against the IFN- receptor. this suggests that IFN-s may be applicable as localized therapy. protective effect of IFN-s may also be due to the negative modulation of T cell function. ion of type I IFNs may have active mechanisms that interfere with TLR- and RLR-dependent surveillance pathways. the observation that IFNAR-driven responses contribute poorly to viral clearance further supports this notion. recent reports have indicated that infection of AECs with HMPV induces the downregulation of the IFNR. expression of attachment glycoprotein G in AECs severely impairs signaling through RIG-I. this is due to the interaction of the cytoplasmic domain of G with the N terminus of this RNA helicase (154, 168) this protein-protein interaction leads to the uncoupling of RIG-I and MAVS, thus blunting downstream signaling. human AECs upregulate thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and interleukins 1, 6, and 33 (138). CC-bearing chemokines include CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL8/IL-8, CXCL10, and CXCL11 (124, 156, 169) CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL3 are important mediators of neutrophil transepithelial migration and activation. these CXC chemokines are likely synergizing with CXCL8, which is a major chemoattractant of human neutrophils (180), to mediate neutrophilic inflammation within the airways of HMPV-infected humans and mice. both infected AECs and DCs secret a vast repertoire of cytokines (148, 169, 186) while DCs sense viral replication through PRRs, they develop only a poor to modest maturation response characterized by a mild upregulation of MHC-II, B7 receptors, and CD38. the BALB/c model of infection has contributed enormously to the understanding of HMPV molecular pathogenesis. the mouse model has provided a strong proof of concept for the relevance of TSLP and IFNs in immunity against HMPV. binding of TSLP to its receptor (TSLPR) on the membrane of myeloid DCs triggers their activation. this process involves the upregulation of the T cell-activating ligand OX40L. binding of OX40L to OX40 skews T cell differentiation toward a TH2 phenotype, which is deleterious for proper HRSV clearance. cytokines promote the recruitment of neutrophils; professional APCs; and a mixed TH1, TH2 and TH17 repertoire. cDCs are pivotal professional APCs located in virtually all organs of the body as sentinels for pathogens. mature DCs secrete cytokines with the capacity to skew the commitment of T cells toward phenotypes contingent on the threat sensed. the intensities of these signals determine the outcome of T cell stimulation toward anergy (unresponsive phenotype), tolerance (regulatory phenotype), or immunity (effector phenotype) the poor DC maturation induced by HMPV provides a theoretical explanation for the suboptimal T cell memory observed in humans and mice. compared to other paramyxoviruses, that of HMPV is low in terms of both cytokine secretion and expression of maturation markers. cDCs from mouse lungs infected with HMPV fail to stimulate naive T cell proliferation in vitro. cDCs from mouse lungs infected with HMPV fail to stimulate naive T cell proliferation in vitro. inhibition of CD4+ T cell priming occurs even at lower multiplicities of infection of DCs. infection of DCs by HMPV ends in suboptimal stimulation of helper CD4+ T cells (TH cells), which may subsequently mediate poor viral clearance. inhibition of T cell priming is partially dependent on the secretion of soluble factors by HMPV-infected DCs. these factors impair the upregulation of the TCR-driven activation marker CD69 and the proliferation of stimulated T cells. some groups found no differences in proliferation of CD45RO+ CD4+ T cells stimulated with HMPV-infected MDDCs. others found that HMPV impairs signaling at the immunological synapse. disparities in susceptibilities of naive and antigen-experienced T lymphocytes have also been documented in the case of DCs infected with HRSV. autologous memory CD4+ TH cells are key virulence factors. reduced CD3 accumulation is a hallmark of TCR triggering and immunological synapse formation. inhibition of G and SH proteins is observed early in DC-T cell cocultures. the limited help provided by TH cells may have strong negative repercussions for the quality of antibody responses mounted against relevant antigens, such as the F protein. to date, there has been no study demonstrating deleterious effects of HMPV on the humoral immune response of humans and model animals. HMPV is associated with pathological, chronic, and degenerative alterations in the lower respiratory epithelium and chronic inflammation with participation of lymphocytes and other mononuclear cells. TH cells and CTLs cooperate to clear the virus from the airways and also promote lung pathology during the primary immune response of naive animals to HMPV. infected mice, HMPV induces an initial TH1-biased T cell response. this skews toward a mixed TH1/TH2 response at 10 days postinfection. this skews toward a mixed TH1/TH2 response at 10 days postinfection. cytokines include reduced proportion of CD4+ TH cells secreting TNF- and interleukins 4, 10, and 13 as well as an overall reduction in lung IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 mRNA levels (TH2 cytokines) these results lead to the notion that the immunological milieu elicited by infection with HMPV significantly influences the effector response of virus-specific CTLs. the aberrant adaptive antiviral immunity that is elicited by mice, cotton rats, ferrets, hamsters, and nonhuman primates support HMPV replication in the lungs and develop ARTIs, with various degrees of susceptibility. animal studies have contributed enormously to the preclinical evaluation of vaccine candidates and helped in the identification of immunological mechanisms that confer immunity against experimental infections. however, a debate has been raised regarding the usefulness of the mouse model in understanding the response of humans against HMPV. conservation in the transcriptional landscape of >64% of orthologous genes controlling the activation and regulation of human and mouse T cells has been demonstrated. one drawback is translating to humans the pathogenic roles and the diversity of immunodominant epitopes found within the T cell repertoire elicited in HMPV-infected mice. enza virus expressing the G protein of HMPV Hamster Immunogenic inducer of protecting TH2-type antibodies 229 Equine encephalitis virus expressing the F protein of HMPV Primates Immunogenic inducer of protecting TH2-type antibodies 234 Virus-like particles Retroviral core particles that express the G and F proteins of HMPV BALB/c mice Immunogenic inducer of protecting TH2-type antibodies 233 Human embryonic kidney epithelial (293-F) cells cytotoxicity Natural viral infection 218 M195\u2013203 APYAGLIM Mouse; B7tg (restricted to HLA-B*0702) Splenocytes, IFN- secretion Experimental infection, VLP vaccination 160, 246 F528\u2013536 SGVTNNGFI Mouse; H2-Db TCD8, CTLs, IFN- secretion Experimental infection, VLP vaccination 160, 246 M2.181\u201389 GYIDDNQSI Mouse; the characterization of viral proteins that impair helper T cell activation may open new and exciting opportunities for the development of rational vaccines for preventing lower ARTIs in children and the elderly. the characterization of viral proteins that impair helper T cell activation may open new and exciting opportunities for the development of rational vaccines. the NS1 and NS2 proteins target STAT-2 for degradation (254, 255) these findings exemplify how distinct paramyxoviruses have evolved synergistic or redundant mechanisms to blunt the host interferon response affecting pivotal signaling molecules. the human immune system may have participated in the selection of structural proteins with secondary roles to compensate for such a genetic deficiency. studies in mice, cotton rats, and macaques using a number of HMPV strains have shown no dissemination of HMPV to the brain, other organs, or the blood. the selective pressure of the host immune system may have had a role selecting HMPV proteins that promote the modulation of the IFN response."}
