{"summary": "between 1999\u20132006, a total of 290762 LRIs were included by date of hospitalization and patients place of residence (>80% coverage, 16 million population) two large outbreaks of Legionnaires disease in the Netherlands were used as positive controls to test whether these outbreaks could have been detected as local LRI elevations. syndromic surveillance can detect local LRI-outbreaks in a timely manner, independent of laboratory-based outbreak detection. comparatively few new clusters per year were observed that would prompt investigation. syndromic hospital-surveillance could be a valuable tool for detection of local LRI-outbreaks. the two largest outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease in the Netherlands in the last decade were used as \u201cpositive controls\u201d to test whether these known outbreaks would have been detected by space-time signals in LRI data. we examined regional increases in the reported incidence of influenza-like-illness (ILI), hospital discharge diagnoses for respiratory illnesses and age group distributions for LRI cases. regional ILI-surveillance data ILI-data were collected from a sentinel network of general practitioners (GPs, Continuous Morbidity Registration Centres, CMR sentinel stations, 1% population coverage) the underlying GP-practice populations were aggregated by region and week. we used SaTScan software [16] and the SaTScan Macro Accessory for Cartography (SMAC [17], applied in SAS version 9.1, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) to run the scan-statistic and visualize the results. we simulated a prospective surveillance by running the scan-statistic on data from the year preceding each time unit (day or week) in the analysis period. two-step criteria to define (likely) causes for LRI hospitalization clusters detected in 1999\u20132006. the proportion of hospitalizations with a specific characteristic can be significantly higher among hospitalizations within the cluster-signal than the proportion outside of the cluster-signal. the annual influenza season was defined as all weeks with a national weekly ILI-incidence 3 per 10.000 pop. sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the impact of time and spatial window settings on the number of clusters and signals detected. sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the impact of time and spatial window settings on the number of clusters and signals detected. bt.cdc.gov/surveillance/syndromedef. data were aggregated by hospitalization date, postal-code and age group. GP-practice populations were aggregated by region and week. 30 Legionnaires' disease cases were identified in Amsterdam, 2 of which were fatal. a cooling tower in the town centre was later identified as the outbreak-source. a space-time permutation scan statistic compared the observed number of cases in circular areas with variable radii in flexible time periods. if the recurrence interval of a signal is say 1 year, 1 signal of the observed significance is expected in 1 year. two thresholds levels were used: signals with recurrence interval 1 and 5 years. we assessed whether successive signals overlapped in space and time. overlap in time between LRI and ILI-cluster-signals was defined as occurrence of weekly ILI-cluster-signals within 2 weeks (+/) around LRI-cluster-signals. annual influenza season was defined as all weeks with a national weekly ILI-incidence 3 per 10.000 pop. in 1999 and 2006 a total of 194 cluster-signals were detected. by daily analysis, in 1999 and 2006 a total of 194 cluster-signals were detected. the number of clusters was lower (10 clusters by daily analysis vs 12 by weekly analysis in 1999 and 2006) the total number of detected clusters and signals is presented, for the non-restrictive parameter settings on space and time (A), for the settings with a maximum time window of 7 weeks (B), and for the settings with a maximum radius of 25 km (C) the distribution of (likely) causes according to the criteria in Figure 1 is also presented in the Table. a recurrence interval reflects how often a signal of the observed significance level would be observed by chance [18]. if the recurrence interval of a signal is say 1 year, 1 signal of the observed significance is expected in 1 year. the known Legionnaires' disease outbreaks in 1999 and 2006 were detected by LRI-clusters. many of the other clusters and signals seemed to be related to local RSV and/or influenza activity (70% of cluster-signals and 60% of clusters, Table 1). some of the influenza and RSV related clusters tended to persist over longer periods. with a maximum 25 km radius, 165 of the 221 initial cluster-signals and 33 of the 35 clusters were still detected. one of the 2 undetected clusters had been scored as likely due to RSV, for the other no likely cause had been scored. with the restrictive time window 2 borderline significant cluster-signals were detected, that had been non-significant in the initial analysis. the number of clusters was lower (10 clusters by daily analysis vs 12 by weekly analysis in 1999 and 2006) however, the number of clusters was lower (10 clusters by daily analysis vs 12 by weekly analysis in 1999 and 2006. s and signals are presented, for the non-restrictive parameter settings on space and time (A), for the settings with a maximum time window of 7 weeks (B), and for the settings with a maximum radius of 25 km (C). the distribution of (likely) causes according to the criteria in Figure 1 is also presented in the Table. if the recurrence interval of a signal is say 1 year, 1 signal of the observed significance is expected in 1 year. the known Legionnaires' disease outbreaks in 1999 and 2006 were detected by LRI-clusters. cluster-signals were generated with an increased proportion of patient discharge diagnoses for Legionnaires' disease in both outbreak areas and periods. in 2000, a cluster was detected with an unusually high number of patients diagnosed with aspergillosis. for 46 cluster-signals we did not find a \u201clikely cause\u201d according to the criteria in Figure 1. 129 of the 221 initial cluster-signals and 30 of the initial 35 clusters were still detected. some of the cluster-signals detected with restrictive time/spatial windows had not been detected with the initially detected signals. with the restrictive time window 2 borderline significant cluster-signals were detected, that had been non-significant in the initial analysis. this was due to the fact that initial cluster-signals that geographically overlapped with them had dropped out. syndromic surveillance will pick up similar outbreaks of severe respiratory disease in a timely manner. the 3 clusters with \u201cunknown cause\u201d could represent very early local influenza activity or local activity of another respiratory pathogen. some of these clusters possibly represent unreported and/or undetected local LRI-outbreaks. to illustrate the impact of changing the threshold we repeated the analyses for recurrence intervals 5 years. nationwide high coverage data (80\u201399% of hospitalizations) over a longer period (8 years) with all detected clusters analyzed and (if possible) explained in a systematic way. sensitivity for local outbreaks is reduced by using data with relatively low coverage levels. fewer clusters than weekly analyses because threshold for recurrence intervals (1 year) is more strict. daily analyses would therefore probably not detect more epidemiological events. syndromic surveillance might be most valuable for outbreaks due to uncommon or novel pathogens. outbreaks due to more common pathogens could also be missed. internet-based ILI-monitoring [27] combined with virological self -sampling [28] could increase the microbiological base for interpreting syndromic surveillance data. the frequency of cluster detection, when interpreted in the light of available epidemiological and microbiological data, does not give rise to excessive levels of further investigations. public health responses can be based on a combination of syndromic surveillance data, reports by astute clinicians and early diagnostic test results. future research should focus on practical methods for integrating syndromic surveillance alarms with clinical reports and laboratory information for effective public-health responses."}
