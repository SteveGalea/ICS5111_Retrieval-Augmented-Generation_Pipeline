{"summary": "results were compared with those of the best-performing countries in the world and the best-performing countries with similar income levels. Brazil demonstrated fairly even improvement in relative health performance across the different age and sex subgroups that we assessed. the world\u2019s population, 217 million individuals were estimated to be undernourished in 2012. in 2012, south africa had more people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus \u2013 6.1 million \u2013 than any other country. in this paper, we focus on the changes seen in mortality among males and females of different age groups. s are identifiers of the country, age group and sex involved, respectively, is the number of deaths among a fixed number of people. the remaining life expectancy could be set as the shortfall from a fixed age, such as 69 years, or as the highest observed age- and sex-specific life expectancy among all countries. voidable premature deaths is a long-established practice. it avoids the burden of having to decide which causes of death are preventable. identification of the cause of death can be particularly problematic in developing areas. income is the best single proxy for these factors. in northern china, such pollution may have reduced mean life expectancy at birth by 5.5 years. as N* and LE* are income-specific, rising standards could result from increases in the reference standards or move of the study country to a higher income group with higher reference standards. income data \u2013 purchasing power parities expressed as international dollars for the year 2005 \u2013 were drawn from World Development Indicators. countries with populations of less than a million were excluded because they may show particularly large variability in their observed mortality. unavoidable deaths are based on the lowest observed mortality rate for the given age\u2013sex group among all countries in the sample. the estimates of AYLL are comparable across different age\u2013sex groups. health inequality represents the differences in health \u2013 or health losses \u2013 which are not only unnecessary and avoidable but, in addition, are considered unfair and unjust. income is strongly correlated with many non-income factors that impact health, such as access to education, food, shelter and medicine. income is, arguably, the best single proxy for these factors. a country\u2019s geography and climate are unlikely to have changed dramatically within the 20-year time frame of our analysis. decomposing the change in relative health performance For any age\u2013sex group in a country, we can decompose the change in its IAYLL between period r and the later period t into two components. average female born in 1990 was expected to lose an additional 3.26 years of life expectancy due to excess mortality in this Brazilian birth cohort between birth and an age of 1 year. in 2011, this average female\u2019s AYLL and IAYLL had dropped to 0.93 and 0.65 years, respectively, indicating substantial post-1990 improvement in one age\u2013sex group\u2019s relative health performance. adult females in india \u2013 except those who were more than 70 years of age \u2013 also experienced steady improvements in relative health performance over time. only children younger than 5 years and some of the subgroups older than 70 years experienced improved relative health performance over this period. lower-income countries generally have better health performance than low-income countries. changes in IAYLL between 1990 and 2011 can be partially attributed to improvement in mortality rates and partially to changes in income group used as a benchmark. the BRICS countries are far from homogenous. the Russian Federation has the highest mean income but among the worst relative health performance. India has the lowest mean income but managed to outshine South Africa in terms of relative health performance. IAYLL is not limited to emerging economies. it could be useful for monitoring the relative performance of any country\u2019s health system at different stages of that country\u2019s development. improvements in national income and global health technology could mask a lack of progress or even regression in the efficiency of a country\u2019s health-care system."}
