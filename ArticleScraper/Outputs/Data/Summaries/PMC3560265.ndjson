{"summary": "anti-viral drugs have been developed for some viruses that can infect the brain, such as Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and 2, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) many patients succumb to disease, and survivors often suffer permanent neurological sequelae. neurovirulent Sindbis virus encephalitis [15] IL-1/ mice exhibit increased mortality and virus loads in HSV-1 encephalitis [16] leukocyte chemoattractants IL-6 adhesion molecules IL-6/ mice exhibit reduced seizures in TMEV encephalitis [17] NO/reactive oxygen species production neuronal misfiring/ seizures neuronal breakdown of BBB MMP Reviewed in [18-22] IL-12 IL-12/ mice show decreased clinical inflammatory cytokines Reviewed in [33,34] Neurotransmitters Glutamate neuronal misfiring/seizures Competitive and non-competitive glutamate receptor antagonists promote survival during neurovirulent Sindbis virus encephalitis. the spleen has also been identified as an important reservoir of undifferentiated monocytes that are rapidly deployed to sites of inflammation. a recent study has shown that cardiac infarction triggers a significant increase in numbers of MDPs in the spleen. it is likely that both the BM and spleen are critical for supplying monocytes to the infected CNS. large quantities of the chemokine CCL2 is produced by infected astrocytes, macrophages/microglia and/or neurons (g) these cells can give rise to CD45hi Ly6Chi macrophages (j) and/or CD45int Ly6Cint immigrant microglia (k) if/when virus is cleared from the CNS, it is unclear whether recruited macrophages and immigrant microglia give rise to CD45l recent studies have shown that these cells are recruited to the virus-infected brain in animal models of HSV, HIV, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and flaviviral encephalitides. these cells are also recruited to the virus-infected brain in animal models of HSV, HIV, murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and a number of flaviviral monocytes migrate from the periphery into the brain. the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and one of its ligands CXCL12 (SDF-1) directly enhance VLA-4-dependent adhesion. Deficiency in either molecule results in impaired myelopoiesis. in animal models of CNS inflammation, there is significant upregulation of CXCL12. in EAE and WNV, CXCL12 plays an important role in retaining leukocytes in the perivascular space, thereby inhibiting infiltration into the parenchyma. soluble mediators represent potential targets for future therapies aimed at blocking monocyte migration. very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) and leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) are expressed by Ly6Chi monocytes. their respective binding partner\u2019s vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and inter-cellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) are usually upregulated on endothelium and other cell types in the inflamed brain. monocytes differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells in the infected brain. in models of viral encephalitis, Ly6Chi monocytes have been shown to give rise to M1 pro-inflammatory CD45hi macrophages and CD11c+ DC populations. microglia originate from a myeloid lineage distinct to that of infiltrating monocytes Microglia are the resident macrophage population of the brain. in acute TMEV infection, resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages express similar levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. in chronic stages of disease, macrophages are more efficient at stimulating T cell responses. irradiation can disrupt the blood\u2013brain barrier and promote CCL2 production, resulting in the recruitment of monocytes to the CNS. parabiosis models have also been employed to show that there is no significant engraftment of monocyte-derived microglia in facial nerve axonomy or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. another recent study has compared the recruitment of monocyte-derived microglia into brain during AD, using chimeric mice generated with or without head protection during irradiation. monocyte-derived microglia engraft the brain parenchyma during WNV encephalitis. monocytes contribute to viral clearance or viral burden in different models of infection. higher mortality rates and increased pathogen loads are seen in toxoplasma [139,140], Listeria [83,141], Cryptococcus [142,143], Yersinia infections [144], HSV-2, [145] and coronavirus [146]. a recent study has shown that Ly6Chi monocyte recruitment to the CNS is detrimental in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [68]. the precise pathways through which inflammatory monovcytes contribute to pathology are still under intense investigation. the earliest defined precursor is the common myeloid precursor (CMP), distinguished from HSC by the expression of CD34 but not SCA-1 [39-42]. this subset includes the recently defined macrophage/DC precursor (MDP), which expresses high levels of the PU.1-controlled chemokine receptor CD115 (CSF-1R/M-CSFR), chemokine receptor CX3CR1 (fractalkine receptor), and Flt-3 (CD135/F hematopoietic precursors in the bone marrow (BM) give rise to CD34+, Sca-1- CMP (b) these cells in turn give rise to a pool of precursors known as granulocyte/macrophage precursors (GMPs) a fraction of these progenitors also express CD115 and CX3CR1 and are known as macrophage/dendritic cell precursor (MDP) monocytes are classified into two phenotypically and functionally distinct subsets. the MDPs give rise to two phenotypically and functionally distinct subsets of monocytes. these cells have been termed \u2018inflammatory\u2019 because they are selectively recruited to sites of inflammation and infection in many models of disease. monocyte egress from the bone marrow is controlled by chemokine/chemokine receptor interactions. monocyte egress from the bone marrow is controlled by chemokine/chemokine receptor interactions. Deficiency in either molecule results in impaired myelopoiesis [75-80]. fected brain is dependent on chemokine/chemokine receptor interactions. ligand CCL5 (RANTES) is highly upregulated during infection/inflammation. chemokine of interest controls trafficking of monocytes into the brain parenchyma. the major producers of CCL2 appear to be different depending on the infectious agent. microglia serves as important sources during HSV infection [16,102], neurons in case of WNV infection [11] and astrocytes in HIV encephalitis [103]. cellular adhesion molecules and their integrin ligands are obviously also important. monocytes differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells in the infected brain. monocytes differentiate into macrophages and DC populations exhibiting a M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype, which in-vitro effectively stimulates Th1 and Th17 responses in T cells. microglia can be distinguished from infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages and DC by their low to intermediate expression of CD45 and lack of Ly6C expression. in most infections, resident microglia play functionally distinct roles from that of monocyte-derived cells. in acute TMEV infection, resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages express similar levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. there are currently no immunophenotypic markers that can definitively separate these two populations. however, irradiation can disrupt the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and promote CCL2 production, resulting in the recruitment of monocytes to the CNS. monocyte-derived microglia engraft the brain parenchyma during encephalitis. monocytes contribute to viral clearance or viral burden in different disease models. monocytes are direct targets for pathogens such as HIV, TMEV, Listeria and Toxoplasma. monocytes contribute to immune-mediated pathology during brain infection. in several models of CNS disease, inflammatory monocytes cause significant damage and destruction in the brain. inflammatory monocytes contribute significantly to pathogenesis of disease during stroke. monocyte infiltration is a hallmark of viral encephalitis. the role of these cells in viral clearance and immunopathology is not well defined. future studies will identify new targets for intervention during viral encephalitis. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors\u2019 contributions RLT drafted the manuscript."}
