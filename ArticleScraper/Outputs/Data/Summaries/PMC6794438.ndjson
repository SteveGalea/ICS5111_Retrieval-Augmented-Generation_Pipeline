{"summary": "IBV affects chickens of all ages with severe signs in younger birds and high mortality rates especially when a co-infection with a secondary bacterial or viral pathogen(s) (1\u20134). IBV is a Gammacoronavirus belonging to the family Coronaviridae (6). cross-protection between IBV strains can range from very poor to moderate protection according to the results of IBV cross-protection studies (21). under the field conditions, chickens are exposed to different IBV variant strains at the same time. IBV vaccines, ME VAC IB-VAR2\u00ae (IB-VAR2) and ME VAC IB-M41\u00ae (IB-M41) (ME VAC, Egypt) produced from two IBV strains isolated from Egypt compared to another 2 commercial IBV vaccines, nobilis\u00ae 4/91 (IB-793B) and Nobilis\u00ae IB Ma5 (IB-Ma5). the last two groups were non-vaccinated challenged (G7) and non-challenged control (G8) (Table 1). Ciliary activity was evaluated at 5 days post vaccination (both prime and booster vaccination) at 14 days after the prime and booster vaccination, blood samples were collected and the seroconversion against IBV was evaluated. tracheal ciliary activity was assessed as previously described (35) three sections of upper, middle and lower parts of the trachea were analyzed. the IB-M41 and IBV-4/91 refrence strains sera and antigens were purchased from Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie (IZSVe, Italy) the IB-VAR2 antiserum and antigen were prepared from the IBV challenge strain. serum samples were kaolin-treated before testing. ready mix, 1.25 l RT enhancer, 0.25 l Verso enzyme mix, 1 l (20 pmol) of forward primer IBV5 GU391 (5\u2032-GCT TTT GAG CCT AGC GTT-3\u2032), 0.25 l of virus-specific probe (5\u2032-FAM-CAC CAG AAC CTG TCA CCT C-BHQ1-3\u2032) and 3.75 l nuclease-free water. ciliostasis scores, HI antibody titers, and virus shedding titers were estimated using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-test through GraphPad Prism version 5.00 for Windows. two commercially available live attenuated IBV vaccines, ME VAC IB-VAR2\u00ae (IB-VAR2) and ME VAC IB-M41\u00ae (IB-M41) (ME VAC, Egypt) produced from two IBV IB-M41, IB-Ma5: IB-793B, IB-793B: IB-793B, and IB-793B: IB-Ma5 on day-1: day-14. last two groups were non-vaccinated challenged (G7) and non-challenged control (G8). ciliary activity was evaluated at 5 days post vaccination (both prime and booster vaccination) 15.5 56.3 80 4 IB-Ma5 IB-793B 17.5 50.7 60 5 IB-793B IB-793B 21.0 40.8 50 6 IB-793B IB-Ma5 26.5 25.4 50 7 No vaccine challenge 35.5 0.0 0.0 8 No vaccine No challenge 4.0 NA a Mean ciliostasis score/bird for the 5 tracheas examined in each group. asis score for each group was calculated using the following formula. p r o t e c t i o n s c o r e = ( 1 mean ciliostsis score for challenged group) Verso 1-Step qRT-PCR kit was used for detection and quantification of S1 gene of IBV. the qRT-PCR reaction volume was 25 l containing 5 l of extracted RNA, 12.5 l 2X One-step RT-PCR ready mix, 1.25 l RT enhancer, 0.25 l Verso enzyme mix, 1 l (20 pmol) of forward primer IBV5 GU391 (5\u2032-GCT TTT GAG CCT A ular epithelium hyperplasia and hemorrhage were also scored. ciliostasis scores, HI antibody titers, and virus shedding titers were estimated using one-way ANOVA. vaccinated groups primed with IB-793B vaccine had slightly higher ciliostasis score (1.9 0.3 compared to all other vaccinated groups) the groups primed with IBV-VAR2 vaccine induced higher ciliostasis scores compared to those primed with classical IB-M41 vaccine. lesions include punctuating hemorrhages and catarrhal exudates in throat and trachea. the kidneys were swollen with frequent urate deposits. no prominent gross lesions were observed in vaccinated and negative control groups. 3DPC 5DPC 7DPC IB-M41: IB-Var2 2.05 0.79*** (5/5)b 1.61 0.39** (4/5) 0.81 0.31* (2/5) IB-Var2: IB-Var2 1.47 0.20*** (4/5) 1.19 0.26*** (4/5) 0.64 0.54* (2/5) IB-Ma5: IB-793B 1.91 0.68*** (5/5) 1.52 0.67** (5/5) 1.73 tracheas from birds primed or boosted with IB-793B showed highest lesion score. in kidneys, variable lesions scores were observed after challenge especially renal nephrosis. lesion scoring was done according to Lee et al. (23), kidney lesions were scored as 0 for normal, 1 for focal lesions, 2 for multifocal lesions, and 3 for diffuse lesions. the predominant IBV strains circulating in Egypt are variant 2 strains belonging to the GI-23 lineage confined to and widely spread in the region since its emergence in 2011. the groups primed with IBV-VAR2 vaccine induced higher ciliostasis scores compared to those primed with classical IB-M41 vaccine (1.4 0.14 and 0.9 0.31 respectively) at 5 DPV. the groups primed with IBV-VAR2 vaccine induced higher ciliostasis scores compared to those primed with classical IB-M41 vaccine (1.4 0.14 and 0.9 0.31, respectively) average ciliostasis score in vaccinated groups primed or boosted with IBV-793B ranged between 1.2 0.2 and 1.7 0.2. vaccinated groups primed or boosted with IBV-793B showed higher ciliostasis scores. groups 4, 5, and 6 primed or boosted with IBV-793B vaccine showed 60, 50, and 50% protection, respectively.
