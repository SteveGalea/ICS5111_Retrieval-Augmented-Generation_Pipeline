{"summary": "in the swine industry, diarrhea caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) has caused serious economic losses worldwide (3\u20138). the virus must fuse its envelope with the cellular membrane so that the envelope chamber is connected to the cytoplasm. fusion inhibitors that target membrane lipids may offer an alternative. they require a wedge-shaped amphiphilic structure with a relatively large hydrophilic head and a relatively small hydrophobic tail. the insertion of wedge lipids into the outer leaflet of the envelope stabilizes the positive curvature and reduces the possibility of membrane fusion. surfactin (SF) standard (98% purity) and surfactin purified from B. subtilis OKB105. hemolytic curves generated by surfactin, LPC, and DEPE. CC50, 50% cytotoxic concentration. surfactin was purified from a medium of a B. subtilis OKB105 culture. it was identified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) almost all of the peaks correspond to the various homologues of surfactin. purified surfactin sample and surfactin standard have almost identical concentration curves. half-hemolysis occurs at 10 g/ml in 10 min, but no further hemolysis occurs during the next 96 h. surfactin at levels higher than 20 g/ml decreases viability of IPEC-J2 cells and Vero cells. izing antibodies were added to the virus or cells at different times before or during infection. the infection process was divided into preinfection, virus adsorption (at 4\u00b0C), virus invasion (the first hour after infection at 37\u00b0C) and replication (1 to 12 h postinfection [hpi] phases. the negative control DEPE had no significant effect at any stage. infectious particles in the culture medium were detected by plaque formation. the histogram summarizes the plaque assay results. each experiment was repeated three times. TGEV was incubated with different concentrations of surfactin, LPC, or an antibody (Ab), at 37\u00b0C or 4\u00b0C, for 10 min. samples were diluted 50-fold, and residual infectious particles were then detected by a plaque assay. each histogram represents results from three independent experiments. synthetic lipopeptides (SysLP1 and SysLP2) based on the structure of surfactin were designed and synthesized. the synthetic lipopeptides exhibit nearly identical antiviral activities and are similar to surfactin. antiviral activities (using TGEV) of synthetic lipopeptides (sLP) and surfactin, measured in a plaque assay. a solvent (PBS) and SysLP1 showed no fluorescence at UV and visible wavelengths. intact TGEV was found in fractions containing 34% sucrose. the virus capsid was found in the fraction containing 46% sucrose. only triton X-100 treatment affected viral integrity. one hundred percent is defined as the total amount of RNA detected in the corresponding experiment. infectious virus was detected only in fraction 16 and adjacent fractions for the untreated TGEV sample. Virus debris was found only in the untreated control. octadecyl rhodamine label attached to TGEV is dequenched after the virus fuses with the cellular membrane. fluorescence was observed before and after incubation for 1 h at 37\u00b0C using a fluorescence microscope. the virus in the control sample fused to target cells. fluorescence intensity was continuously monitored every 30 s, for 1 h. the slope of the curve decreased with time and was predicted to reach a maximum value of 38.77%. molecules in the HII phase are in a planar or negatively curved lipid membrane. the area occupied by the hydrophilic groups is equal to or less than the area of the hydrophobic groups. the incorporation of inverted-cone-shaped lipids is not conducive to the formation of negative curvature and therefore increases the phase transition temperature. oral bioavailability of cyclic peptides with >4 residues is extremely low (30) surfactin in the intestinal lumen may have an antiviral effect similar to that in in vitro experiments. daily oral doses in excess of 20 mg/kg bw will significantly increase the anti-PEDV property of jejunal contents in mice. daily oral doses in excess of 20 mg/kg bw will increase the anti-PEDV property of jejunal contents. newborn pigs were challenged with PEDV at the age of 2 days. piglets were orally administered surfactin every 6 h starting at the age of 2 days. all pigs died within 48 h. the concentration of surfactin in the purified product was obtained by comparing the integrated peak area with the surfactin standard. the concentration of surfactin in the purified product was obtained by comparing the integrated peak area with the surfactin standard. surfactin concentrations above 15 g/ml almost completely inhibited replication of either virus. a potent antiviral effect can be obtained at 15 to 20 g/ml without harming cells. surfactin has similar mechanisms of action on PEDV and TGEV. surfactin and neutralizing antibodies completely inhibited TGEV production. both reagents also eliminated infectious TGEV in the culture medium. both reagents also eliminated infectious TGEV in the culture medium. surfactin acts on viral lipids. the lipid bilayer of the viral envelope is obtained from the host cell. a rigid membrane is less likely to accept membrane-intercalating agents. TGEV treated with surfactin at 37\u00b0C or 4\u00b0C. eluate was collected at a retention of 0.35 column volume (CV) surfactin can be detected at low levels in virus incubated at 37\u00b0C. wavelength fluorescence scanning was conducted to evaluate their fluorescence. SysLP1 had no fluorescence activity in the UV and visible ranges. n-hexane was used as a solvent to simulate a hydrophobic environment. nm and an emission wavelength of 370 nm in PBS. surfactin inactivates TGEV without envelope disruption. some direct-acting antivirals disturb the envelope structure. envelope debris remained in the sample layer for samples treated with either surfactin or LPC. the results obtained using quantitative real-time PCR were similar. only Triton X-100 treatment affected viral integrity. microscopy provides more support for the effect of surfactin on envelope structure. it is difficult to find a complete virus particle in samples treated with Triton X-100. instead, polygonal particles with a diameter of about 70 nm can be observed. TGEV was exposed to surfactin, DEPE, LPC, or a solvent (Ctl) for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. the virus-cell complexes were washed and then adjusted to pH 5 with HCl. fluorescence intensity was continuously monitored at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the slope of the curve decreased with time and was predicted to reach a maximum value of 38.77%. defactin insertion increases the positive curvature of the lipid monolayer. insertion of surfactin into the virus envelope may make viral membrane fusion energetically unfavorable. a 1% increment in the cholesterol concentration will decrease the phase transition temperature by 0.76 0.02\u00b0C. the phase transition temperature increased by 0.48 0.01\u00b0C or 0.38 0.03\u00b0C per 1% increment in the surfactin or LPC concentration. mice were orally administered surfactin in a single dose of 0, 4, 20, 100, or 500 mg/kg of body weight (bw) death was observed only in the highest-dose group in the first 48 h. daily dose was 0, 4, 20, or 100 mg/kg bw for each group. the daily oral doses of surfactin for the 4 groups of mice were 0, 4, 20, and 100 mg/kg bw. mice were sacrificed at day 28, and red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), platelets (PLT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were detected. the calculated half-effective dilution was plotted. jejunal hyperemia and colonic tympanites could be seen in the PEDV group piglets. however, there were no obvious pathological changes in the intestines. the level of the PEDV genome in jejunal tissue was quantified by qRT-PCR. surfactin is a covalent ring composed of a heptapeptide and a -hydroxy lipid acid. the carboxyl groups of the two amino acid side chains form a hydrophilic head. the remaining hydrophobic amino acids form a hydrophobic tail with the aliphatic chain. surfactin insertion increases or stabilizes the positive curvature of the outer leaflet. formation of the negatively curved membrane fusion intermediate is energetically less favorable. surfactin targets the lipid component of the virus. RAFIs, represented by dUY11, were identified as wedge lipid membrane fusion inhibitors in earlier studies. dUY11 is best described as a type II membrane-targeting photosensitizer (18) nontoxic oral doses can be as high as 20 mg/kg bw. the lipopeptide family, represented by surfactin, offers a vast array of possibilities for finding optimal membrane fusion inhibitors and developing novel antiviral drugs. Alternatively, the structure of surfactin may be modified chemically or by genetic engineering (39) to reduce toxicity and enhance the membrane fusion inhibition property. 105/ml in plastic tissue culture flasks were passaged every 3 to 4 days. a 2-l sample was injected into the ultraperformance LC (UPLC) column. the gradient was 5% buffer B for 2 min, 5 to 95% buffer B for 15 min, and 95% buffer B for 2 min. a 100-l volume of the supernatant was transferred to a well in a 96-well plate. the microplate reader (Infinite 200 PRO; Tecan Group Ltd., Switzerland) was used to measure the optical density at 540 nm. the positive control included 1% Triton X-100. nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences were measured using qRT-PCR with the TaKaRa green qPCR kit. the sequences were as follows: PEDV-N-F (sense), 5\u2032-AAGGCGCAAAGACTGAACCC-3\u2032; PEDV-N-R (antisense), 5\u2032-TGTTGCCATTACCACGACTCC-3\u2032; TGEV-N-F (sense), 5\u2032-CAATTCCCGTGGTC TGEV (100 PFU) was mixed with an equal volume of surfactin in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or DMSO alone was mixed with surfactin. the samples were incubated for 10 min at 4\u00b0C for to allow for virus adsorption. cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, the agar overlays removed, and the cells stained with 0.1% crystal violet. fluorescence scans were obtained using a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. samples were labeled with 20 g/ml synthetic lipopeptides. final concentration of TGEV was 500 g/ml for viral protein. fusion can be detected by fluorescence due to R18 dequenching (45) the fluorescent probe was inserted into the viral bilayer by the addition of 15 l of a 1.4 mM R18 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) solution in ethanol. tial is the initial fluorescence of the sample, and Fmax is the fluorescence resulting from the addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.1% after the kinetic experiment. samples were dried under nitrogen gas and were placed in a vacuum desiccator for 3 h. a of the mice were centrifuged (12,000 g, 5 min), heated (98\u00b0C, 10 min), and centrifuged again (12,000 g, 5 min), and the supernatant was collected. for the PEDV protection experiment, 9 newborn piglets were divided into three groups, kept in incubators, and manually fed 10 ml milk every 3 h. all cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM) with high glucose. all cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C under a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. a 2-l sample was injected into the ultraperformance LC (UPLC) column. the lock mass option was enabled using leucine-enkephalin (m/z 556.2771) for recalibration. the ionization parameters were as follows: capillary voltage, 2.5 kV; collision energy, 40 eV; source temperature, 120\u00b0C. total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. nucleic acids of PEDV or TGEV were assayed by amplifying viral nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences using qRT-PCR with the TaKaRa green qPCR kit. the inoculum was removed; 1 ml of DMEM was added to each well. samples were placed in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C. ve fitting and medium effective concentrations (EC50) were calculated with GraphPad Prism, version 6, using the log(inhibitor)-versus-response equation. lipids were extracted by the addition of chloroform-methanol (2:1, vol/vol), followed by 5% freshly prepared saturated (28%, wt/wt) ammonia. gradient was sampled as 26 fractions, collected using a capillary siphon. pct = 142.842 + 534.52 390.71, where pct is the percentage of sucrose. a sample from each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE. fusion buffer at pH 5 was added to each well at 4\u00b0C. fluorescence intensity was continuously monitored at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the results were analyzed using STARe.
