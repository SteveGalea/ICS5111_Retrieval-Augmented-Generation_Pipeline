{"summary": "the prevalence of respiratory viruses in adults is underestimated. nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected and analyzed through time-series analysis. the prevalence of respiratory viral infection (RVI) in adults admitted to the ER is largely unexplored, as most relevant data concern infants and children. the etiology of respiratory infections in adults remains undetermined in more than 50% of cases. the study was conducted at HCPA, in the city of porto Alegre, southern Brazil. the HCPA is a general, tertiary care, university-affiliated hospital with 750 beds and approximately 30 000 hospitalizations/year. adults 18 years with respiratory symptoms 5 days were included. nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected in the second part of study. OC43/HKU1, PIV 1, 2, and 3, influenza A and B, RSV A and B and rhinovirus A/B were obtained from the Climate Laboratory at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. the methodology used by this laboratory informs automatically the pollutant that reached the highest concentration in the last 24 hours. an ARIMA was developed for ILI and SARI. it allows to make predictions from their parties AR (autoregressive) and MA (moving average) for both SG and SARS. study was conducted at HCPA, in the city of porto Alegre, southern Brazil. the HCPA is a general, tertiary care, university-affiliated hospital with 750 beds and approximately 30 000 hospitalizations/year. the patients were interviewed by a member of the research team. the following data were registered in a standardized questionnaire. the total cases of ILI (fever >38\u00b0C and cough or sore throat) were registered. the pollutant that reached the highest concentration in the last 24 hours is ozone. in the city of porto Alegre, it is probable that the pollutant responsible for more than 90% of the days is ozone, and in the rest of days, particulate matter of 10 m dynamic diameter (PM10) the ARIMA (p, d, q) allow to make predictions from their parties AR (autoregressive) and MA (moving average) we identified the need for differentiation, for ILI and SARI, the graphical analysis of time-series and autocorrelation functions. ILI and SARI were diagnosed in 3698 (309%) and 2063 (177%) patients. overall mortality rate among all study participants was 280 of 11 953 (23%) 410 adults were enrolled for virological investigation, 255 in the first year and 155 in the second one. the median duration of symptoms was lower in the selected sample as compared to all adults admitted to the ER in the same period. samples from 180 patients were sent for RT-PCR analysis. sixty-five (361%) samples were positive, with 70 viruses being identified. adenovirus was identified on IFI and influenza A was found in PCR. in one patient, adenovirus was identified on IFI and adenovirus was found in PCR. in another case, PCR detected PIV type 2 and PCR identified PIV types 1 and 3. data are presented as mean SD, n/N (%): number of cases with characteristic/total number of cases (percentage), or median (interquartile range). figures3 and 4 show the daily number of patients with ILI and SARI and meteorological parameters. 0 240 156 47 Absolute humidity (g/kg) 38 193 118 35 Relative humidity (%) 470 983 758 96 Rainfall (mm)* 0 790 43 109 Sunshine duration (number of sunshine hours per day) 0 130 60 39 Mean concentration of pollutants (m/m3) 1 720 274 109 * Median = 0 mm (interquartile range: 0\u201320 mm) the absolute humidity (AH; 78 21 g/kg) and mean concentration of pollutants (200 70 m/m3) were lower in this period. we included 255 patients in logistic regression for IFI and 180 patients in logistic regression for PCR. the -coefficient for this parameter was negative, indicating increasing ILI frequency with decreasing sunshine duration. the -coefficient for this parameter was negative, indicating increasing ILI frequency with decreasing sunshine duration. 176 0059 0003 MA3 0111 0049 0026 A0 1551 0269 0001 A1 0131 0087 0067 A2 0395 0103 0001 A3 0241 0078 0001 A4 0158 0078 0021 Mean temperature 0399 0209 0025 Sunshine duration 0392 0160 0007 Relative humidity 0098 0059 005 Mean concentration of pollutants. lower temperatures and sunshine duration, conditions usually encountered in winter, were associated with admissions for RVI.12,19 Temperature was found to be highly inversely correlated with RSV, influenza A, and adenovirus frequency. evidence is emerging that increasing temperature is associated with increases in air pollution, especially ground-level ozone. the stability of aerosolized influenza virions is maximal at lower RH (20\u201340%), moderate at higher RH (60\u201380%), and minimum at a mid-range RH (50%). AH measures the actual water vapor content of air irrespective of temperature. studies have suggested acute effects causing respiratory symptoms, cardiovascular events, hospital admissions, and mortality. the prevalence of cough and wheezing was higher in patients with mold in home and IFI positive. air conditioning was also positively related to IFI test in this study. majority of virus transmission occurs within indoor, air-conditioned environments. this is the first study to analyze the relationship between RV, meteorological parameters, and air pollution in an adult population. in adult patients admitted to ER with respiratory complaints, at least 22% of infections were caused by RV."}
