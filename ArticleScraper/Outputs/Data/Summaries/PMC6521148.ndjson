{"summary": "alpha, beta, gamma, and deltacoronaviruses (CoVs) mainly infect mammals and cause human and animal diseases. HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 commonly cause mild respiratory illness. at least 4 CoV species with high genetic diversity have been found in members of this family [11]. a new porcine disease was confirmed to be caused by batCoV HKU2-related virus in Guangdong Province, China. ted reverse-transcription (RT-) PCR (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA) was employed to detect coronavirus. we PCR amplified the cytochrome b (Cytob) and/or NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1) gene. the gene sequences were assembled excluding the primer sequences. genomes were preliminarily assembled using DNAStar lasergene V7. putative open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted using NCBI\u2019s ORF finder. sequences of the 5\u2019 untranslated region (5\u2019-UTR) and 3\u2019-UTR were defined. the leader sequence, the leader and body transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS) were identified as previously described. the protein homology detection was analyzed using HHpred. forward primers were designed targeting the leader sequence at the 5\u2019-end of the complete genome. reverse primers were designed within the ORFs. specific and suspected amplicons of expected sizes were purified and then cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector. transfections were performed with lipofectamine 3000 Reagent. expression of these accessory genes were analyzed by Western blotting. fecal supernatant was acquired via gradient centrifugation. then added to vero E6 cells, 1:10 diluted in DMEM. dual luciferase reporter assays HEK 293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates and then co-transfected with reporter plasmids. at 24 h post transfection, cells were treated with Sendai virus (SeV) for 6 h to activate IFN or NF-B. coV/Rh/YN2012 strains RsYN1, RsYN2, RsYN3, and RaGD obtained in this study have been submitted to the GenBank under MG916901 to MG916904. the study was conducted in accordance with the Guide for the care and use of wild mammals in research of the People\u2019s Republic of China. amplification with degenerate primers designed on basis of multiple alignments of available alpha-CoV sequences deposited in GenBank or amplified with SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) with specific primers. PCR products over 5kb were subjected to deep sequencing using Hiseq2500 system. avage of the 16 nonstructural proteins coded by ORF1ab was determined by alignment of aa sequences of other coVs. alignment of aa sequences of other coVs was determined by the recognition pattern of the 3C-like proteinase and papain-like proteinase. potential recombination events as suggested by strong p-values (10\u201320) were confirmed using similarity plot and bootscan analyses. fecal supernatant was acquired via gradient centrifugation. then added to Vero E6 cells, 1:10 diluted in DMEM. fecal supernatant was acquired via gradient centrifugation. 293T cells in 12-well plates were transfected with 3 g of expression plasmid or empty vector. cells were collected 24 h post transfection. cells were treated with Sendai virus (100 hemagglutinin units) luciferase activity was measured using the dual-luciferase assay kit. luciferase activity was measured using the dual-luciferase assay kit. luciferase activity was measured using the dual-luciferase assay kit. the other three CoV sequences showed less than 83% nt identity to known CoV species. a total of 19 provinces (indicated in gray) in China were involved.
