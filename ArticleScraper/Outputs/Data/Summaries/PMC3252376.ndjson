{"summary": "human enveloped viruses include hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 use cholesterol-rich lipid rafts for entry [1], [2], assembly [3], and/or replication [4]. LDs are now appreciated as dynamic organelles [5] that are also used in the lifecycle of pathogenic human viruses including rotavirus (RV) [6], dengue virus (DV) [7], and HCV [8]. host metabolic pathways tightly control cellular lipid synthesis. there is a correlation between degree of steatosis and severity of chronic HCV infection [13], [24] and response to treatment with pegylated-interferon- and ribavirin [25], [26]. human site-1 protease (S1P, MEROPS S08.8063) is a membrane-bound subtilisin-related serine endoprotease that belongs to a group of nine mammalian proprotein convertases (PCs) in family S08 [44]\u2013[46] SKI-1/S1P displays unique substrate specificity among the PC members by showing preferred cleavage after non-basic amino acids [47] we hypothesized that inhibiting SKI-1/S1P endoproteolytic activity in the secretory pathway would prevent HCV hijacking of host lipid metabolic pathways. we hypothesized that engineering a naturally occurring serpin scaffold could also provide a powerful approach for developing selective SKI-1/S1P inhibitors. engineering of the RCL of Spn4A to mimic consensus sequence Arg/LysP4-Xaa3-Xaa2-Leu/Ser/ThrP1 resulted in the development of Spn4A-RRLL. we demonstrated the anti-proteolytic and anti-HCV activities of our new recombinant adenovirus-expressing Spn4A-RRLL. we cloned our pre-His/FLAG-tagged Spn4A construct into an adenoviral shuttle vector to generate Spn4A.RRKR(r) we hypothesized that only an Spn4A variant would encounter active SKI-1/S1P molecules in the early Golgi compartment. Residues at positions P2 and P1 of the Spn4A RCL \u201cbait\u201d region ArgP4-ArgP3-Lys P2-Arg P1 were substituted to generate ArgP4-ArgP3-Leu P2-Leu P1. thereby mimicking the predicted SKI-1/S1P target cleavage site [50] recombinant adenoviruses (Ad) expressing the Spn4A constructs Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(r) and Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(s) were produced as described previously. recombinant adenoviruses (Ad) expressing the Spn4A constructs Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(r) and Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(s) were produced the high-content analysis of cell death was confirmed using an MTS-based cell viability assay. the lack of detectable toxicity induced by Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(r) and Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(s) up to a moi of 50 showed that these variants can be tested over a very wide dynamic range in hepatoma cells. the 45-kDa band of Spn4A.RRLL(s) was detected in both whole cell extracts and in cell media. the results confirmed the robust intracellular expression of intact FLAG-tagged recombinant serpins. the differential secretion of Spn4A.RRLL(r) and Spn4A.RRLL(s) in Huh-7.5.1 cells. a stable, acyl-enzyme complex is formed between a protease and a functional inhibitory serpin following RCL cleavage. this allows for detection of the high molecular weight, heat-stable, and SDS-stable enzyme-inhibitor (EI) complex by standard SDS-PAGE and Western blot [54], [55], [58], [62] to determine if Spn4A.RRLL(s) is a the results of our biochemical analysis confirmed the serpin-like properties of recombinant Spn4A.RRLL(r) and (s) biosynthesized in human hepatoma cells and the selectivity of Spn4A.RRLL(s) against SKI-1/S1P. Spn4A.RRLL(s) inhibits SKI-1/S1P by a suicide substrate mechanism. n inhibitor alpha-N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO (ALLN) was employed to facilitate the detection and accumulation of the N-terminal fragment of SREBP-1 in the nucleus. western blotting of nuclear extracts from cells treated with 10 M of PF-429242 (PF-429242 + ALLN) revealed a complete block of SREBP-1 accumulation in the nucleus. anti-PCSK9, LDLR, SREBP-2, and GM130 antibodies were used to detect protein expression levels. cell extracts were harvested and subjected to Western blot analysis. a representative Western blot of 3 independent experiments is shown. s was associated with a concomitant decrease in protein levels in SREBP-target genes. a time course analysis of cells expressing Spn4A.RRLL(s) in complete media showed the most significant block in SREBP-regulated LDLR expression after 72 hours. expression of -tubulin and of the Golgi marker GM130 not affected by Spn4A.RRLL(r) or Spn4A.RRLL(s) expression in cells specifically inhibits the SREBP pathway including target genes identified as cellular cofactors affecting HCV infection. a critical function of the SREBP pathway and the genes that it regulate is to control lipid homeostasis [36] expression of secretory pathway Spn4A.RRLL(s) in Huh-7.5.1 cells dramatically reduces the abundance of cellular lipid storage droplets. LDs are dynamic intracellular lipid storage compartments made up of triglyceride and cholesterol esters, surrounded by a phospholipid membrane. on cytosolic LD abundance was confirmed by visualizing the LD marker ADRP/perilipin 2 using confocal microscopy. there was no reduction in ADRP/perilipin 2 expression following treatment. reduced cellular LD levels were due to inhibition of SKI-1/S1P. the LD marker ADRP was detected in cells treated with Spn4A.RRLL(r), Spn4A.RRLL(s) and Ad-Empty (control) using rabbit anti-ADRP antibody. images were obtained using an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope. Huh-7.5.1 cells were treated with increasing moi (1\u201350) of Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(r), Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(s), or Ad-Empty (control) for 48 hours in complete media with or without exogenously added sterols followed by 72 hours of infection with HCV. the number of HCV-infected cells, as evidenced by positive core protein expression, was measured using Cellomics HCS. Huh-7.5.1 cells were infected with moi (1 \u2013 50) of Ad-Empty (control), Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(r) or Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(s) for 48 hours in regular media or media supplemented with sterols. replicon-harbouring cells were treated with serpin-expressing and control adenovirus moi 50. denoviruses for 5 days before total RNA was harvested. all values are expressed as relative HCV levels in serpin-treated cells. results from at least 3 independent experiments are shown. the impact of Spn4A.RRLL(s) treatment on HCV replication was further investigated using HCV subgenomic replicons [75]. no significant differences were observed between HCV replicon levels treated with Spn4A.RRLL(s), Spn4A.RRLL(r) and the control (Ad-Empty) the anti-HCV properties of PF-429242 Next, we wanted to test whether extracellularly applied PF-429242 would effectively inhibit the endoproteolytic activity of secretory pathway SKI-1/S1P and reduce HCV infection in Huh-7.5.1 cells. the number of HCV-infected cells, indicated by positive core protein expression, was measured using Cellomics HCS. sample images of cells treated with DMSO or 50 M PF-429242 acquired with Cellomics HCS using the 10 X objective are shown to the left of the graph. results (mean SEM) from 3 independent experiments are shown. a single prophylactic pre-treatment of Huh-7.5.1 cells with 40 M PF-429242 was sufficient to maintain a 10-fold decrease of intracellular HCV core production 72 hours post-infection. a single prophylactic pre-treatment of host cells with PF-429242 was sufficient to robustly block HCV infection by preventing HCV entry and/or downstream production of infectious progeny virions. PF-429242 and Spn4A.RRLL(s) decrease the abundance of LD components. to support this hypothesis, Huh.8 and Huh.2 cells were treated with 10 M PF-429242 for 72 hours. no significant changes in HCV subgenomic RNA levels were observed. Spn4A.RRKR(r) encodes for the naturally occurring serpin Spn4A. cleavage of SREBP substrates occurs in the Golgi apparatus [35] only an Spn4A variant would encounter active SKI-1/S1P molecules in the early golgi compartment. Spn4A.RRKR(r) contains the alpha-1 antitrypsin signal peptide (SP) at the N-terminus followed by a tandem His-tag (HHHHHH) and FLAG-tag (HF) sequence. the secreted serpin, Spn4A.RRKR(r) contains a stop codon before HDEL. recombinant adenoviruses (Ad) expressing the Spn4A constructs Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(r) and Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(s) were produced as described previously [55] as adenoviruses display strong tropism for the liver [60], the major site of HCV infection [13], these recombinant adenoviruses are especially useful molecular tools for HCV research able toxicity induced by Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(r) and Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(s) up to a moi of 50 showed that these variants can be tested over a very wide dynamic range in hepatoma cells. the serpin-secretion profile in Huh-7.5.1 cells was examined by Western blotting of cell lysates and extracellular media. Huh-7.5.1 cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing the His- and FLAG-tagged Spn4A variants indicated or the Ad-Empty control for 72 hours. media alone (upper panels) or cell extracts (lower panels) were combined with recombinant His-tagged SKI-1/S1P or his-tagged furin for 30 minutes at 30\u00b0C. serpins were harvested and incubated with purified recombinant his-tagged human SKI-1/S1P or furin. results showed EI complex formation between recombinant SKI-1/S1P and Spn4A.RRLL(s) in cell media and in cell extracts. recombinant Spn4A.RRLL(s) formed an EI complex with furin. blotting of nuclear extracts from cells treated with 10 M of PF-429242 (PF-429242 + ALLN) revealed a complete block of SREBP-1 accumulation in the nucleus. nuclear extracts from cells treated with 10 M of PF-429242 (PF-429242 + ALLN) also showed a dramatic decrease in nuclear SREBP-1 accumulation compared to Ad-Empty. expression of recombinant Spn4A.RRLL(s) inhibits SREBP-1 processing by SKI-1/S1P. PF-429242 and Spn4A.RRLL(s) inhibit SREBP activation and reduce neutral lipid abundance in Huh-7.5.1 cells. Huh-7.5.1 cells were infected with Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(r), Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(r), or Ad-Empty (control) for 72 hours. cells were then harvested and the relative levels of intracellular lipids were determined in treated cells relative to the control. the levels of LDLR, PCSK9, and SREBP-2 (all regulated by nuclear SREBPs [70]-[73]) were then measured using Western blot analysis of lysed cell extracts. after 72 hours of Spn4A.RRLL(s) expression, mature LDLR (160 kDa) levels were reduced by 74% compared to Ad-Empty-treated cells. an 85% block in mature PCSK9 (60 kD PF-429242 reduced cholesterol-ester levels by 63% compared to control cells treated with DMSO. a 14% reduction in triglycerides was also induced by Spn4A.RRLL(s), although this reduction did not reach significance. relative abundance of LDs stained with BODIPY 493/503 in Huh-7.5.1 cells. after 72 hours, level of BODIPY-stained LDs in Spn4A.RRLL(s)-expressing cells was dramatically reduced compared to empty vector-treated cells. on average, LD abundance was reduced by 80% in Spn4A.RRLL(s)-expressing cells compared to control-treated cells. Huh-7.5.1 cells were infected with Ad-Empty (control), Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(r) or Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(s) for 72 hours. fixed cells were stained for cell nuclei using Hoechst dye (blue) and probed for expression of Spn4A variants using mouse anti-FLAG antibody (red) Huh-7.5.1 cells were treated with DMSO (control) or 10 M PF-429242 for 24 hours, the compound was removed, and the cell lysates were harvested after an additional 48 hours. expression of secretory pathway Spn4A.RRLL(s) in Huh-7.5.1 cells results in a dose-dependent inhibition of HCV infection. adenovirus moi 50 caused a 75% reduction in the number of HCV-infected cells compared to controls. a 2-fold increase in HCV infection compared to non-supplemented cells was observed. relative HCV-core expression (normalized to -tubulin) was quantified by examining total cell lysates using Western blot analysis. infectious HCV titer in the extracellular media was also determined and relatively quantified. a 65% reduction in intracellular HCV RNA levels was also observed. expression of secretory pathway Spn4A.RRLL(r) does not compromise HCV replication in human hepatoma cells. encoding wild-type NS5A or NS5A with adaptive mutation were treated with recombinant adenoviruses for 5 days. total RNA levels were then harvested and the level of HCV RNA was quantified using QPCR analysis. no significant differences were observed between HCV replicon levels treated with Spn4A.RRLL(s), Spn4A.RRLL(r) and the control (Ad-Empty) infected cells were treated with different concentrations (0.01 to 50 M) of PF-429242 for 24 hours. the inhibitor was removed and the cells were then infected with HCV (moi 0.1) in complete media for 48 hours. a single prophylactic pre-treatment of Huh-7.5.1 cells with 40 M PF-429242 was sufficient to maintain a 10-fold decrease of intracellular HCV core production 72 hours post-infection. a single prophylactic pre-treatment of Huh-7.5.1 cells with 40 M PF-429242 was sufficient to robustly block HCV infection by preventing HCV entry. cells were first infected with HCV for 24 hours, allowing uninterrupted HCV entry and establishment of infection. addition of PF-429242 24 hours post-HCV infection should have no impact on the progression of HCV infection. roteolytic activity by PF-429242 impacts late assembly stages of the HCV lifecycle. the next frontier is identifying common, critical, host-cell pathways hijacked by pathogenic human viruses. targeting cellular enzymes acting as master regulators of lipid homeostasis could represent a powerful approach to developing novel class of antiviral agents against infection associated with human enveloped viruses. SKI-1/S1P is a novel potential target for indirect-acting antiviral agents against HCV infection. the inactive SKI-1/S1P zymogen is biosynthesized in the ER and traffics to the golgi apparatus following intramolecular autocatalytic maturation of the proenzyme [35], [46], [99], [100]. SKI-1/S1P inhibition blocks expression of the putative HCV receptor, LDLR (Figure 3B and S4) and reduces HCV entry. expression of other SREBP-regulated genes, such as PCSK9 and SREBP-2, are also blocked. PCSK9 has been implicated in HCV infection through its regulation of two HCV entry factors: CD81 and LDLR [68]. LDLR promotes attachment and uptake of lipoprotein-associated HCV particles into hepatocytes [29], [69], [79], [80]. inhibiting SKI-1/S1P-mediated SREBP endoproteolytic cleavage events resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in HCV infection. western blotting also confirmed that HCV core protein post-translational processing was unaltered by serpin expression because the size of the protein was unaltered. PF-429242 can be added extracellularly to rapidly inhibit SKI-1/S1P. this allows us to study the biological impact of blocking SKI-1/S1P-dependent pathways during both early and late stages of HCV infection. a single 24-hour pre-treatment with the compound was sufficient to block HCV infection. pharmacologic inhibition of SKI-1/S1P offers promising avenue for development of novel anti-HCV therapeutics. targeting host cell master molecular switch such as SKI-1/S1P with novel class of drugs compromising multiple stages of the virus lifecycle would have the main advantage of making it more difficult for the virus to develop escape mutations. recombinant adenovirus expressing an effective and specific secretory pathway, SKI-1/S1P-directed serpin, Spn4A.RRLL(s) formed a kinetically trapped heat- and SDS-stable complex with SKI-1/S1P molecules characteristic of other physiological serpin-protease pairs. we then demonstrated that it blocks the SKI-1/S1P-mediated cleavage of endogenous SREBP-1 and the expression of lipid content and cytoplasmic LD abundance in Spn4A.RRLL(s)-expressing cells confirmed our hypothesis. a decrease in ADRP/perilipin 2 abundance in Spn4A.RRLL(s)-expressing cells compared to control-treated cells. reduced LDLR levels may compromise HCV entry into hepatocytes. LDLR, a well-established SREBP-regulated gene, has been repeatedly shown to support HCV entry into hepatocytes. -1/S1P using PF-429242 blocks HCV infection and extracellular infectious virus production in a dose-dependent manner. a single 24-hour pre-treatment with the compound was sufficient to block HCV infection, and the antiviral effect of PF-429242 was still apparent 72 hours post-treatment. targeting host cell master molecular switch such as SKI-1/S1P would have the main advantage of making it more difficult for the virus to develop escape mutations [86], [88] targeting host LD biogenesis by inhibiting SKI-1/S1P endoproteolytic activity may have far-reaching applications in the therapeutic treatment of other important human Flaviviridae viruses. fetal bovine serum albumin (BSA), saponin, cholesterol, -mevalonic acid, lactone, and oleaic acid were also maintained under selection with 750 M Geneticin. antibodies and dyes used to detect cellular proteins included rabbit anti-human proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) (1500, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) Tagged proteins were detected using mouse anti-FLAG M2 (1500 for Western blot and 150 for immunofluorescence, Sigma-Aldrich Corp.), rabbit anti-FLAG (1500 for Western blot and 150 for immunofluorescence, Thermo Scientific, Nepean, ON, Canada. secondary antibodies used for immunofluorescence were Alexa Fluor-488-conjugated or Alexa Fluor-568-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or don purified RNA was incubated with 10 l of lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 30 minutes. RNA-lipid complexes were added to cells in MEM for 16 hours. cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) Spn4A was modified to encode the alpha-1-antitrypsin signal peptide (residues 1\u201324, pre-1-AT) followed by a 6-His tag (HHHHHH) and FLAG-tag (DYKDDDDDDK) sequence (HF). the ER \u201cretained\u201d variant of the furin-directed serpin, designated Spn4A.RRKR(r) presents the His-Asp-Glu-Leu (HD adenovirus titers were determined in human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells using an Adeno-X Rapid Titer kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) Viraquest Inc. amplified adenovirus (Ad-Empty) in silico homology model of Spn4A.RRLL variant. the resulting precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 10000 x g for 30 minutes. the cleared supernatant was then applied to a small (0.9 ml column volume) column. the column had previously been equilibrated in 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl (buffer A) and bound recombinant SKI-1/S1P was eluted. ice-cold PBS and re-suspended in cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. whole cell extracts were vortexed and clarified by centrifugation. membranes were blocked in Odyssey blocking buffer for one hour. cells were plated at 5105 cells per well in a 6-well plate. they were infected after 24 hours with Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(s), Ad-Spn4A.RRLL(r), Ad-Spn4A.RRKR(s), or Ad-Empty at moi 50. after 72 hours, media and cell extracts were mixed 11 with enzyme reaction buffer. cells were first probed with HCV anti-core antibody (1500) in PBS containing 3% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 (Binding Buffer) then incubated with Alexa Fluor-568-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (11000) and 10 g/ml Hoechst dye. cells were plated into 100 mm plates. cells were harvested in 400 l buffer C (10 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 250 mM sucrose) to shear DNA, the cells were passed 20 times through a 23-gauge needle. the lysate was centrifuged at 1100 x g for 7 minutes and the resulting supernatant cells stained with 0.05% saponin (wash buffer) and 1% BSA (binding buffer) blocking of cells stained with BODIPY 493/503 was done in the presence of 0.2 M glycine to reduce background fluorescence. cells were probed with primary antibodies in binding buffer, then incubated with a secondary antibody, Hoechst dye (10.0 g/ml), and BODIPY 493/503 (1.0 g/ml;
