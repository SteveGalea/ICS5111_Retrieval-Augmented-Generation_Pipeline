{"summary": "the threat from swine flu was portrayed as greatest in the spring and summer of 2009 when scientific uncertainties about the impact on the UK and global population were at their height. thereafter the number of news articles waned, failing to mirror the October peak in flu cases as the virus failed to be as virulent as first feared. by may there were increased outbreaks across the UK and around the world. on 11 June 2009 the WHO revised the alert to phase 6 thus declaring a global influenza pandemic, the first in over four decades. this is the first in-depth examination of the UK newspapers' framing of the threat from the 2009\u201310 swine flu pandemic. this is the first in-depth examination of the framing of the threat from the 2009\u201310 swine flu pandemic. our search period was from 1 March 2009 to 28 February 2010. a total of 5647 articles were identified using the electronic database LexisNexis. each article was printed and scrutinised by one researcher out of six. the coding framework recorded the publication, date, page, word count, newspaper section, and whether there was any reference to 44 thematic categories. the tone of the headline was also rated, because headlines are used to anchor and encapsulate what the journalist/editor defines as the most newsworthy aspect of the story and its main trajectory. the 1st quarter (pre-pandemic: 1 March to 31 May 2009) covered the advent of the outbreak; the 2nd quarter (1 June to 31 August) covered the period in which the global pandemic status was announced. the 3rd quarter (1 September to 30 Nov) covered the period in which the autumn wave in swine flu cases occurred; and the 4th quarter (1 December to 28 February 2010) covered the time when this outbreak of swine flu cases diminished in the UK. 3273 articles were classed as ineligible, leaving 2374 eligible articles for detailed coding and analysis. coding of the articles was carried out over a five-week period by five coders who worked together in close collaboration with the first author. just over 10% (n=250) of the 2374 articles were double coded by SH independently of the coders. this corresponds to a substantial level of agreement. analysis Newspaper articles were analysed for manifest content. interest in swine flu declined in the 3rd quarter (21.4%, n=509), despite a second peak in cases in the UK as the \u2018normal\u2019 flu season came around. by the 4th quarter the story had effectively died; only 150 articles appeared across the eight newspapers over these 3 months. n % n % n % N articles (row %)

21st century. newsprint reporting was at its highest (45.6%, n=1082) during the 2nd quarter, when swine flu was declared a pandemic. there was a lesser focus on the number of cases of swine flu elsewhere. there was a greater focus on UK cases (38.1%) and deaths (26.3%) in the last quarter the number of deaths was mentioned in 39.3% of articles. the fact that swine flu had not been as bad as first predicted was mentioned in almost a fifth of articles. however, the issue of blame towards the government or public health academics for exaggerating the risk to the public of the pandemic was seldom mentioned in articles. most of the articles (45.6%, n=1082) were published in the 2nd quarter. more than one in four articles (27.0%, n=633) appeared in the 1st quarter. interest in swine flu declined in the 3rd quarter (21.4%, n=509) by the 4th quarter the story had effectively died. more articles appeared in the tabloids (1159, 48.8% of sample) than in the \u2018serious\u2019 (n=646,

percentages are column % except in first row of table. the headlines of the large majority of articles were rated as neither alarmist nor reassuring. twenty-eight per cent of articles reported the number of deaths and a quarter (25.6%) reported the number of cases worldwide. one in five articles reported on modes of transmission (21%) and measures to contain the spread of swine flu. key issues reported during this quarter were UK deaths (reported in 35.4% of articles in this quarter), number of UK cases (30.5%) and identification of factors which increased risk of contracting the disease or suffering from a more severe form of the disease. 4th quarter By the 4th quarter the number of UK swine flu cases had diminished. surprisingly few articles included alarming personal stories about people who had contracted swine flu. one in five newsprint articles compared the outbreak with past pandemics. one in five articles reported the number of deaths and a quarter (25.6%) reported the number of cases worldwide. there was a lesser focus on the number of cases of swine flu elsewhere (see figure 1). there was a greater focus on UK cases (38.1%) and deaths (26.3%) surprisingly few articles included alarming personal stories about people who had contracted swine flu. surprisingly few articles included alarming personal stories about people who had contracted swine flu. only 24 articles included reassuring personal stories. in late April the first cases in the UK were confirmed. uncertainty about the threat of the new virus began to feature in this early reporting. newspaper reporting peaked during the summer of 2009, mirroring the first peak in cases. despite predictions, the second peak in cases in the 'normal' flu season failed to exceed the first peak, and as many cases proved mild, swine flu was no longer front page news. despite predictions, the second peak in cases in the UK failed to exceed the first peak. the overall tone of the vast majority of newspaper articles was neutral (86.2%), a finding consistent with Duncan's media analysis conducted in the first few days of the pandemic. in the past two decades there has been a succession of health scares which have raised public anxieties about who to trust to offer unbiased, accurate advice. in seeking to offer \u2018balance\u2019 in reporting, inappropriately presented two apparently equally well evidenced \u2018sides\u2019 to the issues. the disparity between public perception that the UK media over-hyped the risks associated with the swine flu pandemic. this analysis of UK newspapers suggests that the public may have sensed it was over-hyped due to the level of media coverage."}
