{"summary": "methods We measured generational transmissibility by the basic reproductive number R0 and the serial interval by its mean Tg. first, we constructed a simulation algorithm for case data arising from a small population of known size with R0 and Tg also known. serial interval in each infector-infectee pair is the time between disease onset in the infector and the onset in the infectee. in this study, we present a temporal likelihood model that allows real-time simultaneous estimation of R0 and the average of serial interval Tg in a small well-observed population. arbitrary infector of onset time i simulated the number of secondary cases it had infected from the offspring distribution of mean R0, fO(R0), without considering the depletion of the susceptible population. the onsets fall between i + 1,..., i + k with mean i + Tg. the effects are two-fold [6, 7]: first, through susceptible depletion, the number of secondary cases per primary case is reduced until there are no longer any susceptible people in the homogeneous population. second, when there are many infectious cases, competition to infect the remaining susceptible shortens the serial interval. j that could be expressed as, Y j = i = j - k j - 1 Y i R 0 f S ( j - i, T g ). the probability of a whole times series of observations could then be expressed in terms of the expected numbers of secondary cases in each time unit. unless stated otherwise, we seeded day 1 with fifty individuals to avoid the epidemic prematurely died out. each scenario, 1,000 people were assumed to be living in this community, where all but fifty were assumed to be susceptible initially. arbitrary infector of onset time i simulated the number of secondary cases it had infected from the offspring distribution of mean R0, fO(R0), without considering the depletion of the susceptible population. the onsets fall between i + 1,..., i + k with mean i + Tg. the effects are two-fold [6, 7]: first, through susceptible depletion, the number of secondary cases per primary case is reduced until there are no longer any susceptible people in the homogeneous population. second, competition to infect the remaining susceptible shortens the serial interval. the mean Tg was the average over of this distribution in the absence of competing sources of infection. j 1 with onsets at time j that could be expressed as, Y j = i = j - k j - 1 Y i R 0 f S ( j - i, T g ). the probability of a whole times series of observations could then be expressed in terms of the expected numbers of secondary cases in each time unit. distributed serial interval distribution covers the range of SARS in hospitals (R0 = 2.7 [9]), pandemic A/H1N1 influenza in the community (R0 = 1.5 [10, 11]) and pandemic A/H1N1 in schools (R0 = 2.4 [12]. each scenario, 1,000 people were assumed to be living in this community, where all but fifty were assumed to be susceptible initially. in Scenario 1, incidence appears to be occurring sub-exponentially as early as 10 days after the initial seed. part a shows Scenario 1 with R0 = 1.8, Tg = 2.5 and part b shows Scenario 2 with R0 = 3.0, Tg = 6.25. the results of jointly estimating R0 and Tg are shown in parts c (R0) and d (Tg) the results of jointly estimating R0 and Tg are shown in parts c (R0) and d (Tg) Scenario 1 is as per Fig 1A with R0 = 1.8, Tg = 2.5. we repeated the process by c) varying R0 from 1.0 to 3.0 and d) varying Tg from 1.1 to 10.0 in the simulated epidemics. then computed the residuals of c) R 0 and d) T g from the likelihood function respectively. the estimates of different values of k were tabulated on Table 1 for the model using Poisson distributed serial interval, different k values, and number of simulation iterations. the following parameters were used: (a) R0 = 1.8, Tg = 2.5, k = 10; (b) R0 = 1.8, Tg = 2.5, k = 25; (c) R0 = 3.0, Tg = 6.25, k = 10; (d) R0 = 3.0, T 6.31 6.31 (5.95, 6.68) d 10 2.93 2.94 (2.75, 3.06) 6.33 6.38 (6.01, 6.57) 20 2.92 2.91 (2.80, 3.07) 6.40 6.45 (6.02, 6.68) 100 2.99 2.99 (2.77, 3.22) 6.28 6.24 (5.91, 6.72) Bivariate estimations Mean Median (5%, 95%) Mean Median (5%, 95%) Mean Median (5%, 95%) a 10 1. this approach is able to tease apart the two parameters from case data. it extracts key information from transmission dynamics of different phases of a respiratory epidemic. previous similar work has incorporated either the initial stochastic phase or one or more of the deterministic phases, but not all phases together. we have assumed that offspring distribution and serial interval distribution follow a Poisson density. this is convenient assumptions that allow very rapid likelihood calculations for it is a single-parameter defining function. however, the ability of these methods to independently estimate both means and variances remains to be described."}
