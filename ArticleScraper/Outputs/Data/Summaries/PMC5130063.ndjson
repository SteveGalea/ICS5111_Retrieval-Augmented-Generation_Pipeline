{"summary": "HFMD is a widespread pediatric disease caused primarily by human enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16). HFMD is found to be seasonal in temperate Asia with a summer peak and in subtropical Asia with spring and fall peaks. two independent readers examined each of the 407 abstracts to determine if specific research questions were answered. a third independent reader arbitrated when there was a disparity between the original readers. the first author compiled all answers to the specific questions. in total, information from 242 papers was compiled and 108 papers were used in data synthesis. hourly weather data were downloaded from the Weather Underground and aggregated at a weekly scale. nontabular data were extracted from figures using Plot Digitizer. an article was retained as long as both readers indicated it answered at least 1 specific research question. a third independent reader arbitrated when there was a disparity between the original readers. the first author compiled all answers to the specific questions. HFMD cases have been found to increase with average temperature and humidity, especially among younger children. results show that may through July are the months with highest incidence in temperate regions of Asia. however, this relationship is less clear for tropical and subtropical Asia. the effect of meteorologic factors was weak: a small positive increase in transmissibility with rising absolute humidity/temperature during the current week. there was no evidence for temperature and humidity in having the same effect in Hong Kong or Taiwan, although rising relative humidity seems to decrease transmissibility in Singapore. the earliest recorded cases of HFMD in Asia are from Japan (1967),30 Singapore (1970),31 Taiwan (1980)32 and Shanghai, China (1981). since then, outbreaks have been reported in many parts of Asia, including mainland China. cases with right arrow indicate endemicity of HFMD. arrows indicate seroepidemiologic evidence that the pathogen is already in existence. the length of the left arrows are arbitrary as there is no way to know how long has HFMD been circulating before the tests. women are more likely to have seroconverted to EV-A71. women are more likely to have seroconverted to EV-A71. breastfeeding may lower the risk of developing severe HFMD. a matched case-control study of preschoolers in Beijing showed that sunshine could be protective against HFMD. this is agreed by a matched case-control study of preschoolers in Beijing,41. this showed that UV radiation in classrooms is associated with lower HFMD attack rate (P value of 0.027), and recommended installing UV lamps to sterilize unoccupied classrooms. the symptomatic HFMD incidence rate varies widely even within the narrow 0- to 6-year age-band. the greatest proportion of cases occur at ages 1 and 2. by the age of formal schooling, from 6 years in most Asian countries, the proportion is substantially lower. about half of symptomatic cases in Nanchang, china, are among children under 3 years, the age at which preschooling starts in china. a seroepidemiologic study in 1996 to 1997 in Singapore showed that seropositivity to EV-A71 increases rapidly from age 2 to 5,91 when attendance at childcare or preschool is the norm. 3\u20137 days116 or 3\u20135 days,49 ranges from 5 to 7 days42,98 or 3 to 7 days113 and the \u201cusual period\u201d is 3\u20135 days \u201cwith longest period of 7 days\u201d117. early study119 states that the incubation period is \u201csaid to be\u201d 3\u20135 days, but notes that this is inconsistent with the serial interval observed in the study. a second study121 prospectively followed a cohort of neonates over 3 years. 71% of serologically confirmed infections were symptomatic, though the sample size is only 28. an overall estimate is 36% (33%\u201339%), but this estimate does not appear reliable. the third paper124 attempted to estimate the reproduction number using a SEIQRS (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Quarantined, Recovered) simulation model. the model used 10% of China population as the initial susceptible population, but did not conduct a sensitivity analysis on this vital parameter. the regions are arranged by latitude. South China, Hong Kong and Taiwan have subtropical climates. areas further north are temperate, while the Southeast Asian regions are tropical. earliest recorded cases of HFMD in Asia are from Japan (1967),30 Singapore (1970),31 Taiwan (1980)32 and Shanghai, China (1981). earliest recorded cases of HFMD in Asia are from china (1967),30 Singapore (1970),31 Taiwan (1980)32 and Shanghai, China (1981). 3%\u201311% EV-A71 incidence per year, and up to 68% of children92 had serologic evidence of EV-A71 infection before the large HFMD outbreak of 1997. evidence from anhui47 shows high seroprevalence of up to 74.6% in older children before the 2008 outbreaks. n = 116) and nonenteroviral disease controls (n = 170) both studies gather data via questionnaires. white points indicate nonadjusted ORs, black points indicate adjusted OR. white points indicate nonadjusted ORs, black points indicate adjusted OR. study from Singapore104 shows marginal evidence that females are more likely to have seroconverted to EV-A71 [OR: 0.79 (0.61\u20131.01)], while a Taiwanese96 study shows no statistically significant differences. breastfeeding may lower the risk of developing severe HFMD [adjusted OR: 0.57 (0.33\u20130.98)], even though breastfeeding does not apparently lower the chance of being infected. women are more likely to have seroconverted to EV-A71 [OR: 0.79 (0.61\u20131.01)], while girls are more likely to develop symptoms. breastfeeding may lower the risk of developing severe HFMD [adjusted OR: 0.57 (0.33\u20130.98)] a matched case-control study of preschoolers in Beijing showed that sunshine could be protective against HFMD. this is agreed by a matched case-control study of preschoolers in Beijing,41. the findings are inconsistent with the seasonal nature of HFMD. the symptomatic HFMD incidence rate varies widely even within the narrow 0- to 6-year age-band. the greatest proportion of cases occur at ages 1 and 2. by the age of formal schooling, from 6 years in most Asian countries, the proportion is substantially lower [8.7% (7.9%\u20139.5%)] a case-control study in china showed that preschool attendance increased rapidly from age 2 to 5,91 when attendance at childcare or preschool is the norm. in china,103 there was a marked shift from 2007 to 2008 in the proportion of cases among children in preschools (from 59% to 37%) the incubation period is usually 3\u20137 days, citing a CDC factsheet on aseptic meningitis. another early study119 states that the incubation period is \u201csaid to be\u201d 3\u20135 days, but notes that this is inconsistent with the serial interval observed in the study. 1% of serologically confirmed infections were symptomatic, though the sample size is only 28. an overall estimate is 36% (33%\u201339%), but this estimate does not appear reliable. one paper101 estimates what they call the \u201clocal effective reproduction number\u201d in china. simulation model used 10% of china population as the initial susceptible population. but did not conduct a sensitivity analysis on this vital parameter. both viruses occur year round in tropical Asia, but are epidemic in the summer in northeast Asia. literature is unclear on the relative importance of school versus community transmission. but knowledge of where HFMD most often is transmitted is important. the effectiveness of school closure to prevent large-scale HFMD outbreaks is questionable, as the interruption to social networks cannot be enforced while children are out of school. the asymptomatic rate and relative infectiousness of asymptomatic cases are both poorly known. estimates of the basic reproduction number range widely from 1.1 to 5.5. this uncertainty prohibits utilitarian estimation of the necessary vaccine coverage to prevent epidemics of EV-A71. virologic characteristics or molecular epidemiology have been well reviewed elsewhere,116,138\u2013141 and clinical manifestations of EV-A71 and CV-A16.28,116,138,141,142. a recent review of the case-fatality rate has recently been published,143.
