{"summary": "the human genome encodes over 320 PDZ domain-containing proteins. the domain itself is an evolutionarily conserved domain of approximately 90 amino acids folded into six -sheets (A\u2013F) and two -helices (A\u2013B), named for its presence in PSD95, DLG, and ZO-1 proteins. PDZ domains are grouped into specificity classes based on the consensus sequence of the PBM recognized. early studies defined three main classes of specificity; class I S/T-X--COOH, class II - X--COOH and class III D/E-X--COOH. the E protein PBM binds to the tight junction associated PDZ protein PALS1. it can also induce proinflammatory cytokine expression, possibly through PBM binding of the PDZ protein syntenin-1. survival of rabies infected neuronal cells is associated with the ability of the viral envelope G protein to interact with the PDZ domain-containing serine threonine kinase MAST2. removal of the PBM decreases efficacy of influenza relocalization of SCRIB to cytoplasmic puncta in infected cells is associated with abrogation of the polarity protein\u2019s pro-apoptotic function. targeting PDZ protein function is also a common function amongst viruses classified as human carcinogens by the world health organization [24]. Virus Mediated Effect upon PDZ Target (if Known) References HCV Core protein DLG1, SCRIB No Decreased expression (DLG1); mislocalization (SCRIB) [25] HBV Core protein GIPC1 (also known as TIP-2), PTPN3 Yes (non-typical, SQC) Disruption of GIPC1 interaction with LPA signalling molecule (\") [26,27] KSHV PDLIM2 No Suppresse beta-HPV8 E6 SDCBP2 (Syntenin-2) No Repression of SDCBP2 transcription [43] RhPV1 (MmPV1) E7 PARD3 (PAR3) Yes (class I, SRV) Degradation via the proteasome, transcriptional downregulation, altered subcellular localization, complex formation to alter function. hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a common risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. the virus primarily infects the highly polarized epithelium in the liver. depolarization of this tissue by the virus is critical for virus entry. NS4B encodes a class I PBM-like sequence (X-T-X-C) however, there is no experimental evidence that supports interaction between NS4B and PDZ proteins. propagation of other RNA viruses within Flaviviridae is dependent upon PBMs within the non-structural NS5 proteins. the association between the core and GIPC1 is linked to the virus\u2019s role in carcinogenesis via disruption of interactions of cellular substrates with the PDZ domain of GIPC1. PTPN3 has been shown to have a suppressive role on HBV gene expression, but this control is independent of the PBM activity of the HBVc. a critical mechanism is the constitutive activation of the nuclear factor B (NF-B) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signalling pathways. in normal signalling, the tumour suppressor PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein regulates turnover of RelA (p65) and STAT3 by ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome. PDZD8 is a poorly understood protein that has been shown to regulate microtubule stability through an interaction with moesin and microtubule stability at the viral synapse is likely to be important for HIV-1 infection. the other known PDZ target of Gag is DLG1 [30]. HIV-1 infection causes a displacement of the PDZ protein ZO-1 from the tight junctions in the apical region of the membrane, followed by a marked reduction in the transcription of ZO-1 and other tight junction proteins. the disruption of tight junction integrity is mediated by the HIV-1 glycoprotein 120, which induces upregulation of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-. a possible function for this interaction may be to aid efficient clustering of GLUT-1 at the polarised synapse. the HTLV-1 tax transcription factor also contains a canonical class I PBM at its C\u2013terminus. studies of the contribution of the HTLV-1 motif to the transformation functions of Tax have shown that deletion of the motif reduces the transformation potential of Tax in rat fibroblasts. kinase casein kinase 2 phosphorylates the threonine residue within the Tax PBM and negatively regulates binding to PDZ proteins. both polarity proteins have been shown to have critical roles in T cell signalling. relocalization of both proteins is a likely mechanism of inactivation of normal function. HTLV-1 transformation does not depend solely on tax binding and inactivating DLG1 [81]. correct localization of DLG1 and SCRIB is important for the formation of signalling complexes at specific sites in the cell. tax-mediated mislocalization of these phosphatases from the plasma membrane may involve Tax disruption of DLG1 and SCRIB scaffolding functions. tax attenuates binding between PTEN and DLG1 in T cells. this requires the activity of the PBM [78]. the HTLV-1 tax protein has been shown to bind to many other PDZ proteins besides DLG1 and SCRIB. a second intriguing function of the E4ORF1 PBM is the activation of PI3K pathway at the plasma membrane. this function is dependent on the E4ORF1 PBM localizing the viral protein to sites in the membrane and triggering activation of downstream targets, including AKT/PKB. complex formation leads to increased stabilization of PI3K and increasing PI3K catalytic activity and activation of AKT. formation of the complex of E4ORF1 and DLG1 was necessary for anchorage independent cell growth. the ability of E4ORF1 to activate PI3K in a DLG1 dependent fashion was found to be a conserved function. high-risk types infect the mucosal surfaces of the anogenital and oropharyngeal tracts. they are associated with cancers at these sites (cervix, vulva, vagina, vagina, penile, anal, tonsil and base of tongue) the most common high-risk types, present in 70% of cervical cancers. keratinocytes transfected with whole HPV genomes in which the E6 PBM has been deleted have shown that PBM function is critical for the vegetative phase of the life cycle. the mutant genome unable to support viral genome amplification or expression of the viral late proteins. a role for the E6 PBM in viral episome maintenance was also identified in the life cycle models. the rhesus papillomavirus type 1 virus encodes a functional C-terminal PBM whose integrity is required for transformation of rodent cell lines. seventeen PDZ proteins that interact with the E6 proteins have been identified to date. the PDZ substrates are involved in defining cell polarity, cell-cell attachment, and organizing cell signalling pathways associated with these functions. cell polarity, proliferation and motility Degradation [113] MAGI-3 Cell polarity, cell motility, cell survival Degradation [122] TAX1BP3 TIP-1 Cell polarity, cell motility, cell survival Degradation [115] INADL PATJ Tight junction formation, cell polarity Degradation [41,46] DLG4 PSD95, SAP90, TIP15 Receptor clustering in neuronal cells Degradation [116] PTPN nuclear phospho-DLG1 forms are preferentially targets for proteasomal degradation by HPV16 E6 [124,125], suggesting that nuclear DLG1 may encode tumour suppressor activity. in HPV16-positive cervical cancer cells, RhoG activity is upregulated and E6 contributes to this upregulation by forming a complex with DLG1 and a RhoG guanine exchange factor (SGEF) E6 targets several other PDZ proteins associated with tight junctions. this interaction disturbs SCRIB localization at the periphery of epithelial cells. this interaction disturbs SCRIB localization at the periphery of epithelial cells. levels of both proteins are rescued upon silencing E6 expression in HPV-positive cervical cancer cell lines. the most marked change was noted for MAGI-1, with membrane bound and nuclear pools of the protein restored and re-localization of MAGI-1 to tight junctions. there are no changes in expression and localization of endogenous DLG1 and SCRIB proteins when the E6 PBM is deleted. bind 14-3-3 proteins, but can bind PDZ substrates enhanced the E6 mediated morphological transformation of human keratinocytes. the mechanism of HPV targeting of PDZ substrates is complicated further by finding that E6* is able to target DLG1, PATJ, MAGI-1, and to a lesser extent SCRIB for proteasomal degradation. the specificity for DLG1 and SCRIB can be switched within the context of the whole E6 protein by switching the last residue [139]. differential targeting of PDZ proteins may also have relevance to the pathogenesis of the virus at different anatomical sites. the interaction has been confirmed as a degradation target of the HPV16 and HPV18 E6 in a PBM dependent mechanism. the E6 PBM targeting of PDZRN3 may function synergistically with E7 to activate STAT5 and support viral amplification. hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a common risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. the virus primarily infects the highly polarized epithelium in the liver. depolarization of this tissue by the virus is critical for virus entry. the effects of virus mediated targeting of PDZ proteins often converge on the PI3K/AKT signal transduction pathway. PDZ proteins are identified by black outline; PIP2 and PIP3 are phosphoinositides. association between the core and GIPC1 may have an important role in facilitating movement of the HBV capsids to the nucleus. it is possible that the association between the core and GIPC1 is linked to the virus\u2019s role in carcinogenesis via disruption of interactions of cellular substrates with the PDZ domain of GIPC1. PTPN3 has been shown to have a suppressive role on HBV gene expression. the tumour suppressor PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein regulates turnover of RelA (p65) and STAT3 by ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome. this normal mechanism of turnover of STAT3 and NF-B is deregulated in KSHV pathogenesis by the virus repressing PDLIM2 transcription by increased DNA methylation of the promoter region. PDZD8 expression has been eliminated by the CRISPR-CAS system. the other known PDZ target of Gag is DLG1 [30]. the gag\u2014DLG1 association regulates HIV-infectivity. the disruption of tight junction integrity is mediated by the HIV-1 glycoprotein 120. it induces upregulation of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-, a known disruptor of tight junctions. HTLV-1 is a retrovirus that is the aetiological agent of the highly aggressive adult leukaemia. HTLV-1 is the major oncogenic determinant of HTLV-1. it induces the transformation of rat fibroblasts in culture and is capable of promoting leukaemia in transgenic mice. deletion of the motif reduces the transformation potential of Tax in rat fibroblasts in culture. polarity complex components DLG1 and SCRIB have been identified as robust binding partners of the Tax PBM. phosphorylates the threonine residue within the tax PBM and negatively regulates binding to PDZ proteins. both polarity proteins have been shown to have critical roles in T cell signalling. correct localization of DLG1 and SCRIB is important for signalling complexes at specific sites in the cell. tax-mediated mislocalization of these phosphatases from the plasma membrane may involve tax disruption of DLG1 and SCRIB scaffolding functions. the HTLV-1 tax protein has been shown to bind to many other PDZ proteins besides DLG1 and SCRIB. however, the physiological relevance of these interactions to HTLV-1 infection and transformation is unknown. the presence of an intact PBM enables tax-expressing cells to overcome pro-IL-16 driven cell cycle arrest. the disruption of tight junction function and associated polarity defects are entirely dependent on an intact viral PBM. a second intriguing function of the E4ORF1 PBM is the activation of PI3K pathway at the plasma membrane. this function is dependent on the E4ORF1 PBM localizing the viral protein to sites in the membrane and triggering activation of downstream targets. complex formation leads to increased stabilization of PI3K and increased PI3K catalytic activity and activation of AKT. formation of the complex of E4ORF1 and DLG1 also deregulates epidermal growth factor receptor signalling leading to activation of nuclear MYC. high-risk viruses infect the mucosal surfaces of the anogenital and oropharyngeal tracts. they are associated with cancers at these sites (cervix, vulva, vagina, penile, anal, tonsil and base of tongue) they are present in 70% of cervical cancers which has a nearly 100% association with high-risk HPV infection. a role for the E6 PBM in viral episome maintenance was also identified in the life cycle models [95,96,97] the various life cycle defects correlated with a marked reduction in proliferation of the mutant genome-containing cells. expression of E6 in mammalian keratinocytes showed that the E6 PBM promotes cell proliferation, but also the acquisition of phenotypes linked to invasive and metastatic growth of tumours. virus type 1 (RhPV1, also known as Macaca mulatta PV1 [MmPV1]) encodes a functional C-terminal PBM whose integrity is required for transformation of rodent cell lines. PDZ proteins associated with high-risk alpha HPV E6 proteins are largely involved in defining cell polarity, cell-cell attachment, and organizing cell signalling pathways associated with these functions. cell survival Degradation [113] TAX1BP3 TIP-1 Cell polarity, cell motility, ion transport Complex formation [114] GIPC1 Synectin, TIP-2 Cell surface receptor expression and trafficking, TGF signalling, Degradation [115] INADL PATJ Tight junction formation, cell polarity Degradation [11,46] DLG4 PSD95, SAP90, TIP15 Receptor clustering in neuronal cells Degradation [116] nuclear phospho-DLG1 forms are preferentially targets for proteasomal degradation by HPV16 E6 [124,125], suggesting that nuclear DLG1 may encode tumour suppressor activity. the other Scribble component targeted by E6 is SCRIB and this interaction disturbs SCRIB localization at the same time. y of epithelial cells and induces loss of tight junction integrity. PDZ proteins include MAGI-1, MUPP1, PAR3 and PATJ. studies also identified roles for MAGI-1 in the negative control of cell proliferation and as a regulator of apoptosis. phosphorylation confers ability to interact with a number of 14-3-3 isoforms. expression of a mutant form of HPV18 E6 that cannot be phosphorylated within the PBM. phosphorylation confers ability to interact with a number of 14-3-3 isoforms. keratinocytes were transfected in intact HPV18 genomes. a marked increase in hyperproliferation of the epidermal keratinocytes. the mechanism of HPV targeting of PDZ substrates is complicated further by finding that E6* is able to target DLG1, PATJ, MAGI-1, and to a lesser extent SCRIB for proteasomal degradation. the ability to target at least one protein of the polarity Scribble complex is a key function. differential targeting of PDZ proteins may also have relevance to the pathogenesis of the virus at different anatomical sites. PTPN13 is associated with over 90% of the HPV positive oropharnygeal tumours. the E6 PBM targeting of PDZRN3 may function synergistically with E7 to activate STAT5 and support viral amplification. papillomaviruses may also target PDZ proteins by blocking their transcription. many of the components of the polarity complexes behave as tumour suppressors in different systems. the deregulation of the PDZ protein controlled pathways is involved in virus infection, transmission, replication, survival and persistence in the host, and formation of new progeny. interactions occur during the life cycle and what interactions are involved in oncogenesis. interactions can be targeted using disrupting molecules."}
