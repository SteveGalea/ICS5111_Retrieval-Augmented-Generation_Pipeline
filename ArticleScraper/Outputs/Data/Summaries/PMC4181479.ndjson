{"summary": "literature exists on mathematical and computational models for studying the spatio-temporal dynamics of influenza outbreaks. a main purpose of these models is to inform public policy regarding the selection and allocation of public health interventions and resources during an outbreak. method of analogs is a nonparametric forecasting approach in meteorology. forecasting is based on matching current influenza patterns to patterns of historical outbreaks. limits exist on the sensitivity to forecasts and difficulty in finding similar patterns from historical outbreaks. the detailed mobility networks used in some of these models can enable reliable description of the diffusion pattern of an ongoing epidemic. this review included studies designed to predict influenza dynamics at the local, regional, national, or global level. we were unable to find published descriptions of the methodology used in forecasting of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. in Table 2, we present a summary of study characteristics. nce intervals Soebiyanto et al.12 2010 LCI cases Weekly 2005\u20132008 Hong Kong & Maricopa county, AZ, USA ARIMA model Weekly case counts RMSE Ong et al.4 2010 CDC influenza case estimates and estimates of vaccine availability and distribution None 2009\u20132010 USA & LA County, USA Epidemic simulation model based on a synthetic population Peak timing and magnitude Predicted range Nishiura14 2011 Influenza cases Weekly 2009\u20132010 Japan Magnitude Eleven of the sixteen studies forecasted the expected magnitude, daily or weekly influenza activity based on data on confirmed laboratory cases, and/or influenza-like illness. the correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed values ranged from 58% to 95% depending on the length of the forecasts. predictions for the 1968\u20131969 pandemic, also known as the Hong Kong flu, were presented graphically and assessed to have overlapped with the observed data in 42 of 44 cities. most of the previous methods were evaluated retrospectively or published after the 2009 pandemic in the US as it unfolded. longini et al.,15 Aguirre and Gonzalez9 predicted the 1988 influenza epidemic in Havana, Cuba to peak on march 15th. but the true peak was observed on March 1st, implying a deviation of approximately 2 weeks. compared with other metrics, the peak time appears to be the easiest to forecast. the articles in Table 2 aimed to either forecast a single measure or multiple measures. Typical measures predicted included epidemic trend, duration, peak timing, peak height, and magnitude. differences in measures of accuracy appeared to depend on the modeling approach. the prediction markets yielded correct predictions 71%, 50%, and 43% of the time by the end of the target week, 1 week in advance, and 2 weeks in advance. the true incidences were included in the 95% prediction intervals for epidemic forecasts made at the peak. simulated 2009 H1N1 epidemic for LA county peaked at about the same time (mid-November) as reported by the department of public health. however, web-based estimates do not always capture trends in influenza activity and could therefore distort accuracy of predicted outcomes. fewer papers have focused on predicting outbreak duration. aguirre and Gonzalez9 correctly predicted the end of the 1988 epidemic in Havana, Cuba. the prediction markets yielded correct predictions 71%, 50%, and 43% of the time by the end of the target week, 1 week in advance, and 2 weeks in advance respectively. the true incidences were included in the 95% prediction intervals for epidemic forecasts made at the peak and after the peak for the 2009 pandemic in Japan. the 2009 pandemic in Singapore would peak at the start of august. however, peak height was overestimated. simulated 2009 H1N1 epidemic for LA county peaked at about the same time. fewer papers have focused on predicting outbreak duration. aguirre and Gonzalez9 correctly predicted the end of the 1988 epidemic in Havana, Cuba. studies conducted during the 2009 pandemic suggested that estimates of severity and transmissibility improved as the pandemic progressed. the exact number of influenza cases is unobtainable due to unreported cases and asymptomatic infections. a meager understanding of the natural history of the virus hinders the estimation of transmission and severity parameters in real time. a meager understanding of the natural history of the virus hinders the estimation of transmission and severity parameters. limitations include reduced application in low-resource countries and deviation from influenza patterns presented by traditional surveillance systems. the outbreak peaked in august 2009; however, search query data suggested an earlier peak. views and conclusions contained herein are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing the official policies or endorsements, either expressed or implied, of IARPA, doI/NBC or the US Government."}
