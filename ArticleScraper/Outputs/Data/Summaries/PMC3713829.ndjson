{"summary": "methods Farm Selection Veterinarians agreed to enroll growing-pig farms in the midwestern united states. participating farms were visited every month for 12\u201324 consecutive months. if pigs were all in 1 age group, samples would be collected from the age group closest to 10 weeks, the group most likely to yield the most influenza-positive pigs. swab samples were initially screened for influenza A virus by real-time reverse transcription (RRT-PCR) selective for the matrix gene. samples that were positive by RRT-PCR underwent further diagnostics for determination of subtype. sample collection From June 2009 through December 2011, participating farms were visited every month for 12\u201324 consecutive months. if pigs were all in 1 age group, samples would be collected from the age group closest to 10 weeks, the group most likely to yield the most influenza A virus\u2013positive pigs. nasal swabs were labeled with a specific code containing the farm identification number, month, 2-letter state abbreviation, and nasal swab sample number. the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and swine H1 and H3 viruses (21\u201323) Statistical analyses A farm was considered positive for a given month if any of the 30 individually collected swab samples tested positive. a total of 16,170 nasal swab samples were analyzed by repeated measures logistic regression. 540 groups of growing pigs from the remaining 32 farms were collected. 746 (4.6%) were positive for influenza A virus by RRT-PCR. at least 1 positive sample was detected in 117 groups of pigs. of the positive groups, the mean and median numbers of samples positive for influenza A virus by RRT-PCR were 6.4 and 2, respectively. the numbers of positive samples ranged from 1 to 30; most groups (n = 48) had 1 positive sample. pigs in only 7 of these groups showed clinical signs of influenza-like illness. clinical signs were observed in 187 (34.6%) of 540 groups. from these 187 groups that reportedly exhibited clinical signs, 43 (22.9%) were positive for influenza A virus. clinical signs of respiratory disease were noted in only 7 of those 13 groups. there was no association between the winter season and influenza virus detection. age was not significantly (p = 0.09) associated with influenza A virus group status. however, the variable was left in the model because of confounding. 0.95 H1N2v \u20132.105 0.2 (0.03\u20132.0) 0.93 H3N2v 9.541 NA 0.95 H1N1pdm09 \u20131.582 0.4 (0.1\u20131.7) 0.95 Mixed infection \u20132.210 0.2 (0.04\u20131.3) 0.93 *Logistic regression univariate analysis; NA, not applicable. in 18 groups, a subtype could not be defined through either RRT-PCR or sequencing. pigs were isolated from 178 swab samples that originated from 62 pig groups. each horizontal line represents a farm, each dot represents a sampling event. the average age of the pigs in the 540 groups was 13.7 5.7 weeks. influenza virus was detected in pigs as young as 4 weeks and as old as 30\u201332 weeks of age. age was not a statistically significant predictor of influenza A virus test status. seasonal influenza virus status, no. groups Total, no. groups Positive Negative Winter 19 105 124 Spring 37 100 137 Summer 40 110 150 Fall 21 108 129 Total 117 423 540 Logistic Regression In the first model, univariate analysis of all variables (age, season, and year) except clinical signs yielded p0.25. influenza A virus detection rates through either virus isolation or RRT-PCR on individual nasal swab samples were 5%, presenting a challenge for surveillance programs. new sample collection techniques in swine, such as the collection of pen-based oral fluids (e.g., saliva) for antibody and antigen detection are becoming more common. influenza A virus persistence in pig populations is not fully understood. in our study, 41% of positive groups had only 1 positive nasal swab sample. underlying passive or active immunity enabled transmission to occur at a rather low rate. experimental infection with swine influenza A virus has resulted in great variability (29) when swine influenza A virus is part of a co-infection (i.e., with other viruses and/or bacteria), clinical signs are evident (35,36); such co-infections might reflect the health status situation of the groups of pigs used in this study because the likelihood of co-infections in the field was high. ive piglets would often be the group studied in the spring and summer seasons (38), providing a source of susceptible individuals in which viruses circulate during these seasons. weather conditions and seasons in the midwestern United States might not accurately reflect conditions in other swine-producing areas of the united states."}
