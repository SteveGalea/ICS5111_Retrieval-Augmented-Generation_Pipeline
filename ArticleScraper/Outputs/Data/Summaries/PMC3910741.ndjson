{"summary": "antiviral compounds that target envelope glycoproteins are classified as \u201ccarbohydrate binding agents\u201d (CBA) and generally encompass lectins and nonpeptidic antibiotics such as pradimicin A and S and benanomicin A. many natural product lectins have significant in vitro and in vivo toxicity. not all antiviral lectins are toxins and not all antiviral lectins have cell-agglutinating activity. GRFT displays no human T-cell mitogenic activity. topical application of GRFT prevents HIV-1 infection of human cervical explants (15); intranasal treatments with GRFT prevents disease in mice challenged with SARS-CoV (19); intraperitoneal (i.p.) treatment with GRFT prevents Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection in mice (21); and subcutaneous (s.c.) treatment with GRFT shows some efficacy against HCV challenge in a mouse-human chimeric liver models (17, mice (Jackson Laboratory) and Hartley guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room with an alternating light/dark cycle of 12 h. mice were injected subcutaneously with 50 mg/kg GRFT (n = 30) or PBS (n = 15) at 1, 7, and 14 days posttreatment, 10 mice treated with GRFT and 5 control animals were sacrificed. blood was collected by cardiac puncture pooled organ tissues (100 to 500 mg) were homogenized in 1 ml of PBS supplemented with complete, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) the samples were cleared by a series of centrifugation steps performed at 10,000 and 15,000 g for 10 min each time. antiviral activity measured as a function of luciferase reporter gene activity. the 50% infective dose (ID50) values were defined as the sample dilution required to reduce luminescence by 50%. a complete blood count (CBC) was run for guinea pig samples. blood urea nitrogen (BUN), calcium (Ca), cholesterol (Chol), creatinine (Creat), globulin (Glob), glucose (Glu), phosphorus (Phos), total bilirubin (TBil) and total protein (TP) were washed and resuspended at a final concentration of 1% to 2% (vol/vol) in a 96-well round-bottom plate. mice were injected subcutaneously with 50 mg/kg GRFT (n = 30) or PBS (n = 15) at 1, 7 and 14 days posttreatment, 10 mice treated with GRFT and 5 control animals were sacrificed. blood was collected from the submandibular vein every other day, alternating between subgroups. two experiments were conducted at different times for chronic administration in guinea pigs. in the first experiment, 10 mg/kg GRFT (n = 12) or 1 ml/kg PBS (n = 6) was subcutaneously administered daily for 10 days. the second experiment was similar to the first. dilutions of purified GRFT were run in parallel to generate a standard curve. the gp120-bound GRFT was detected by rabbit anti-GRFT antiserum (1:25,000) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000) serum albumin, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), calcium (Ca), cholesterol (Chol), creatinine (Creat), globulin (Glob), glucose (Glu), phosphorus (Phos), total bilirubin (TP) were washed and resuspended at a final concentration of 1% to 2% (vol/vol/vol statistical analysis was conducted using Graph Pad Prism 5 and SAS software version 9.3. it was decided to increase statistical power by using all the data from both studies. three-way ANOVA (23) was used to test for differences between studies, days of sacrifice and treatments. GRFT concentrations in sera from chronically treated guinea pigs were similar to those in sera from chronically treated mice. plasma samples collected from mice treated with a single dose of 50 mg/kg GRFT neutralized HIV-1 pseudoviruses. this neutralization activity decreased in samples obtained at days 8 (ID50 of 300) and 15 (ID50 of 200) guinea pigs and mice chronically treated with 10 mg/kg GRFT were treated with PBS bars indicate mean group concentrations. a 2-way ANOVA was used to measure the impact of treatment and time on body weight gains. GRFT treatment resulted in significantly less body weight gain in comparison with that seen with PBS-treated controls. body weights were measured on experimental day 1 and on the termination day (day 11 or day 15) asterisks indicated a statistically significant increase of the normalized weights of guinea pig livers and spleens. no distinct pathologies were observed as a result of GRFT treatment. 35 1.28 2.90 1.36 NE k/l 2.30 1.46 0.96 0.13 1.67 0.45 1.01 0.42 LY k/l 2.49 1.11 1.14 0.28 2.60 0.89 1.82 0.99 MO k/l 0.09 0.10 0.03 0.03 0.07 0.03 0.06 0.04 EO k/l 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.02 BA k/l 0.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 the mean values standard deviations for white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils (NE), lymphocytes (LY), monocytes (MO), eosinophils (EO), basophils (BA), red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), red cell distribution width (RDW), platelets (PLT) a wide range of GRFT concentrations (5 g/ml equals 391 nM) was used to examine GRFT's potential hemagglutination activity on erythrocytes from multiple species, including sheep (A), guinea pig (B), human (C), and mouse (D) plasma samples collected from mice showed up to 4 nM GRFT (4 nM equals 51.08 ng/ml) in animals sacrificed 1 day post GRFT concentrations in sera from chronically treated guinea pigs were similar to those in sera from chronically treated mice. plasma samples collected from mice treated with a single dose of 50 mg/kg GRFT neutralized HIV-1 pseudoviruses. this neutralization activity decreased in samples obtained at days 8 (ID50 of 300) and 15 (ID50 of 200) guinea pigs and mice chronically treated with 10 mg/kg GRFT were treated with PBS bars indicate mean group concentrations. a 2-way ANOVA was used to measure the impact of treatment and time on body weight gains.

GRFT persists in serum and plasma of laboratory rodents at concentrations well above the EC50 described for several known enveloped viruses. guinea pigs treated with GRFT gained weight significantly more slowly than those injected with PBS. organ toxicity was assessed both by measuring weights and by histopathology. a key concern is a possible immune response to GRFT. lectins are well known for their mitogenic and agglutinating properties (28, 29, 33\u201336) which prevent their use as therapeutics. GRFT does not agglutinate red blood cells from several species, including human, mouse, and sheep. however, guinea pig erythrocytes were agglutinated by GRFT. administrations of GRFT at levels under the 10-mg/kg dose are sufficient to maintain drug concentrations at potentially therapeutic levels. there is substantial precedent for patient self-administration of drugs via the subcutaneous route; indeed, the peptide HIV fusion inhibitor Enfurtide (T-20) is administered in this fashion."}
