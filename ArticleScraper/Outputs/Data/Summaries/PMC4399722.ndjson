{"summary": "RNA viruses rapidly accumulate genetic variation, which can give rise to synthetic lethal (SL) and deleterious (SD) mutations. this principle can also be used against fast-evolving RNA-viruses. targeting protein sites involved in SD + SL interactions would render any mutation of such sites, lethal. edward et al."}
