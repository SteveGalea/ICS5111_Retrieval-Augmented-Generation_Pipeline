{"summary": "HBoV was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates. no other intestinal pathogens were identified. HBoV was detected in both samples. ovirus was investigated by enzyme immunoassay and norovirus by reverse transcriptase PCR. positive samples were retested and confirmed as positive by using a second PCR assay with primers derived from another location in the HBoV genome (7). adenoviruses have been associated with infection of the colon and the gut. HBoV and parvovirus B19 are the only 2 species of the Parvoviridae family that have been associated with disease in humans. in the feces of children with gastroenteritis and the absence of any other intestinal pathogen suggest that this new virus species is an enteric, as well as a respiratory pathogen. further investigations are required to confirm this preliminary hypothesis and gain greater knowledge of the association between HBoV and enteric disease."}
