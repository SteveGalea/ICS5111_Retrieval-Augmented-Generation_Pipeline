{"summary": "clinical specimens used for viral RNA detection included nasopharyngeal aspirates, throat and nose swabs, saliva, sputum, endotracheal aspirates, feces, and urine. nasopharyngeal aspirates, throat and nose swabs, saliva, sputum, endotracheal aspirates, feces, and urine were collected into a mucus trap by aspirating specimens were collected after informed consent from patients attending primary care facilities for nonrespiratory diseases. blood donor sera left over from screening for bloodborne viruses were tested anonymously for antibodies to SARS-CoV. the cultures were examined for cytopathic effect (CPE) each day for 14 days. the cells were spotted on Teflon-coated slides, fixed with ice-cold acetone, and stained for SARS-CoV antigen by using a convalescent-phase human serum. the identification of the isolate was confirmed by RT-PCR. clinical specimens used for viral RNA detection included nasopharyngeal aspirates, throat and nose swabs, saliva, sputum, endotracheal aspirates, feces, and urine. patients were categorized on a clinical basis as \u201cclinical SARS,\u201d \u201csuspected SARS\u201d and \u201cnot SARS\u201d by the attending clinicians. fecal, throat swab, and serum specimens from controls were anonymously tested for SARS-CoV RNA. blood donor sera left over from screening for bloodborne viruses were tested anonymously for antibodies to SARS-CoV. the cells were fed with 1 mL of minimum essential medium with 1% fetal calf serum (GibcoBRL, Grand Island, NY) the cultures were examined for cytopathic effect (CPE) each day for 14 days. at the end of the incubation period, the cells were spotted on Teflon-coated slides, fixed with ice-cold acetone. a total of 3,611 respiratory, fecal, and urine specimens were tested for SARS-CoV RNA and antibody, respectively, from 1,048 patients for whom an initial clinical suspicion of SARS was considered. the results were retrospectively correlated with the clinical diagnosis of these patients. Category Patients tested Patients positive (%) Clinical Clinical SARS (n = 590) 537 322 (60.0) Suspected SARS (n = 79) 70 1 (1.4) Non-SARS febrile respiratory illnesses (n = 379) 341 2 (0.6) Community controls Cohort 2: throat swabs from non-SARS patients with nonrespiratory illness visiting community physicians. two (8%) of 25 patients clinically diagnosed as the \u201cnot SARS\u201d category seroconverted. a further 47 convalescent-phase sera from patients in this group failed to show any more seropositive patients. one had a left mid-zone consolidation confirmed by high-resolution computed tomography scan and had a discharge diagnosis of pneumonia of unknown cause. the other had a mild febrile illness of unknown cause without radiologic evidence of consolidation. swabs were the most productive specimens in the first 4 days of disease. stool samples were more useful after the 5th day of illness. smaller numbers of saliva, endotracheal aspirate, and sputum specimens were available for testing. RT-PCR for diagnosis of SARS-CoV in the first 5 days of illness in patients with serologically confirmed SARS-CoV infectiona. in patients whose first specimen tested negative, 25 had a second specimen (of any type) collected within the first 5 days of illness. three of these 25 were positive; the additional diagnostic yield from a second specimen was approximately 12%. first-generation diagnostic tests for the SARS-CoV became available to clinicians caring for patients in whom SARS was considered in the differential diagnosis. results provided to clinicians on understanding that the tests had not been validated and had to be interpreted with caution. culture of SARS-CoV for preparing the virus-infected cell smears and for virus isolation was carried out under BSL3 conditions. up to 250 specimens per day were being processed for RT-PCR detection and serologic testing during peak periods. the association of SARS-CoV with the clinical syndrome of SARS is illustrated by the detection rates of viral RNA in clinical specimens. a clinical diagnosis of SARS is closely correlated with detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR and seroconversion. none of 2,400 blood donor sera collected in the height of the outbreak has any evidence of antibody to the virus. the spread of SARS-CoV infection in the general community was minimal, with most of the infection associated with clusters and hospital outbreaks. innate immune mechanisms are the earliest host defenses that control viral replication. this response does not appear to occur with SARS, and viral load in the respiratory tract (4) begins to fall only when the antibody response appears. peak viral load in the 2nd week of illness would predict that virus is more likely to be transmitted later in the course of the illness. detecting virus in the fecal and urine samples suggests that SARS is not restricted to the respiratory tract. a number of animal coronaviruses (e.g., mouse hepatitis virus and feline coronavirus) have tropism for multiple organs (17)"}
