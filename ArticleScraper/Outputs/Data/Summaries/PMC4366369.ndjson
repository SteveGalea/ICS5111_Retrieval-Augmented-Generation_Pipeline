{"summary": "an ideal vaccine against an infectious pathogen should prime the host for induction of pathogen-specific memory immune responses at the appropriate mucosal compartment. non-parenteral, needle-free mucosal vaccination has several advantages, including reduced pain stresses, costs, and viral transmission associated with the injection. AcHERV-triHPV was produced using a Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system. the recombinant baculovirus encoded a codon-optimized envelope gene of human endogenous retrovirus (HERV; GenBank accession number NM014590; GenScript Corp., Piscataway, NJ, USA) mice were purchased from Orient-Bio (Seungnam, Kyonggi-do, Republic of Korea) and housed in filter-top cages, with water and food provided ad libitum. the use of animals in these experiments was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Konkuk University. the levels of the HPV16\u201358\u201318L1 gene in mouse samples were determined by qPCR amplification of a genomic DNA template (gDNA) template. the amplification conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 5 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 30 seconds at 94\u00b0C, 20 seconds at 62\u00b0C, and 20 seconds at 72\u00b0C. mice were immunized with AcHERV-triHPV vaccines via the SL or mice were immunized three times with Cervarix (GlaxoSmithKline, Middlesex, UK) at 1/20th of a human dose. all mice were given a single dose (1109 copies) of AcHERV-triHPV. blood and tissue samples were collected 15 minutes, 1 day, and 30 days after immunization. plasmid pCLucf (a firefly luciferase expression plasmid) was encapsidated for in vitro and in vivo imaging. all plasmids used for in vitro and in vivo assays were prepared. OptiPrep-purified HPV16, -18, and -58 PVs were diluted 3,000-fold. 293TT cells were infected by incubating with each PV\u2013antibody mixture for 72 hours. 58 PVs were added and plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37\u00b0C. after 2 hours, streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase was added. color was developed using an aminoethylcarbazole substrate reagent. Statistical analysis All data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Student-Newman-Keuls tests using SigmaStat software (Systat Software, San Jose, CA, USA) P-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. generation of AcHERV-triHPV was produced using a Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system. mice were re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Invitrogen) the pellet was re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Invitrogen) and used for immunization. the use of animals in these experiments was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Konkuk University. total blood and tissue DNA was extracted using a DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) for qRT-PCR, 10-fold serially diluted plasmids encoding HPV16L1, -18L1 and -58L1 (pFB-HERV-HPV16\u201358\u201318L1) were used to construct a standard curve. the levels of the HPV16\u201358\u201318L1 gene in mouse samples were determined by qPCR mice were immunized three times with Cervarix (GlaxoSmithKline, Middlesex, UK) at 1/20th of a human dose. all mice were given a single dose (1109 copies) of AcHERV-triHPV via the SL route. pYSEAP (a secreted alkaline phosphatase; SEAP expression plasmid) was encapsidated for in vitro and in vivo imaging. all plasmids used for in vitro and in vivo assays were prepared as described on the national cancer institute website. endpoint titers were defined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilutions that resulted in an absorbance for non-immunized serum that reached a cutoff value. in vitro neutralization of HPV16 PVs Neutralization assays were performed using SEAP-expressing HPV16 PVs. 1108 copies of HPV16, -18, or -58 PVs were incubated for 24 hours. plates were seeded with splenocytes at 1106 cells per well. mice were genitally challenged with 5108 copies of HPV16, -18, or -58 PVs. anesthetized mice were instilled intraperitoneally with 0.3 mg (in 30 l PBS) of luciferin. luciferase expression was visualized as light emission measured in molecular images acquired for 10 minutes using an IVIS 200 bioluminescence imaging system. SL immunization with AcHERV-triHPV induced a dose-dependent increase in serum IgG antibodies over a range of 1108 to 11010 copies. the levels of serum IgG were not significantly different between SL and IM immunization. Mice were sublingually immunized with three different doses of AcHERV-triHPV (1108, 1109, and 11010 copies per mouse) samples were collected 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the first immunization. serum IgG antibody titers against HPV16L1 (A), HPV18L1 (B) and HPV58L1 (C) were determined by ELISA. vaginal secretion was sampled 2, 4 and 6 weeks after first immunization. antigen-specific vaginal IgA antibody titers against HPV16L1 (A), HPV18L1 (B) and HPV58L1 (C) were determined by ELISA. antigen-specific neutralizing antibody titers against HPV16L1 (A), HPV18L1 (B) and HPV58L1 (C) were determined by SEAP assay. SL immunization with AcHERV-triHPV increased production of IFN- and IL-4. SL immunization with 11010 copies of AcHERV-triHPV induced Th1 and Th2 cytokine induction. ELISPOT assays were used to determine the number of (A) IFN--producing HPV16-, HPV18-, or HPV58-specific CD4+ T cells. mice immunized by SL administration of 1108 copies of AcHERV-triHPV showed dim luminescence in smaller spot areas after challenge with HPV16 PVs. however, mice immunized by SL administration of 1109 copies of AcHERV-triHPV showed no luminescence after challenge with HPV16 PVs (Fig. 7G, 7J), HPV18 PVs (Fig. 7H, 7K) or HPV58 PVs (Fig. 7O) mice were anesthetized and injected with luciferin. levels of luminescence were detected with an IVIS 200 bioluminescence imaging system. mice were anesthetized and injected with luciferin. serum IgG antibody production disappeared by 6 weeks after first immunization. levels of serum IgG were not significantly different between SL and IM immunization. all mice were given three immunizations at 2-week intervals. serum IgG induction after SL immunization showed little dose dependence. vaginal IgA levels increased in a dose-dependent manner. highest IgA antibody titers were observed after SL immunization. lingually administered AcHERV-triHPV SL administration induced type-specific neutralizing antibodies against HPV16L1 PVs. serum-neutralizing antibodies were induced in a dose-dependent manner by sublingually administered AcHERV-triHPV 2 and 4 weeks after the first administration. neutralizing antibody titers were not significantly different among the three doses 6 weeks after the first immunization to a degree comparable to that of IM immunization with 1109 copies SL immunization with three doses of AcHERV-triHPV induced both Th1 and Th2 cell responses in an HPV type-specific and dose-dependent manner. splenic T cells increased production of IFN- and IL-4 by splenic T cells after stimulation with HPV16L1, -18L1, or -58L1 PVs. values represent the number of spots per 106 splenocytes following stimulation with HPV16, -18 or -58 PVs. immunized mice challenged with HPV16, -18, or -58 PVs via the vaginal route. IM administration of 1109 copies of AcHERV-triHPV showed no luminescence after challenge with HPV16 PVs. Mice were administered AcHERV-triHPV or PBS (control) three times over a 2-week interval by the SL or IM route. mice were anesthetized and injected with luciferin. the higher levels of AcHERV-triHPV in the lung at early time points supports the interpretation that sublingually administered AcHERV-triHPV is directly absorbed into the lung. it is likely that the systemic absorption of AcHERV-triHPV involves both paracellular and transcellular pathways across sublingual epithelial cells. previous studies reported that sublingually administered viral vaccines did not migrate to the brain. previously, we showed that SL administration of HPV16L1 protein induced humoral and cellular immune responses. however, in this latter study, HPV16L1 alone was not effective in inducing immunogenicity and required co-administration of adjuvants to induce prolonged and cellular immunogenicity. SL immunization of female volunteers with Gardasil induced 38-fold lower serum IgG levels and 2-fold lower cervical/vaginal IgG levels than IM immunization. SL or IM immunization of mice with AcHERV-triHPV induced both Th1 and Th2 immune responses. SL immunization with AcHERV-triHPV protected mice challenged via the vaginal route. SL immunization is capable of inducing levels of HPV type-specific vaginal IgA sufficient to neutralize mucosa-infecting HPV. this study demonstrated the feasibility of using AcHERV systems for SL delivery of multivalent HPV, AcHERV systems could be used in the future to induce immunogenicity against other viruses."}
