{"summary": "influenza A virus (IAV) is a major cause of respiratory infection in humans. it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide every year. the segmented nature of the genome imparts the ability for reassortment between human, avian, and/or swine strains, which can lead to new pandemic strains of influenza virus. we use this virus to establish a noninvasive method for whole-body imaging of virus infection and spread in real time. we use this virus to evaluate novel therapeutic monoclonal antibodies which neutralize both H1 and H5 subtype viruses. the GLuc ORF was amplified from a humanized GLuc plasmid (NEB) with the KDEL motif encoded in the reverse primer. the complete construct was generated by Infusion HD (Clontech) recombination of the pDZ vector, the PB2 ORF, and the GLuc ORF. the mutant 5\u2032 end was replaced with the wild type. l chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin was infected and incubated with TPCK-trypsin. at times indicated in Fig. 1, cells were lysed, and luciferase assays were performed to assay viral replication. MDCK cells were mock or virus infected at an MOI of 0.001. cells were incubated without TPCK-trypsin for the indicated times. cellular lysates were collected, and luciferase activity was determined. secondary antibody (donkey anti-mouse Alexa-Fluor 488; Invitrogen) was incubated with cells for 1 h at room temperature. cells were washed and mounted with ProLong Gold with 4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen) reactivity of GG3 or KB2 via ELISA was determined via a plaque reduction assay. reactivity of GG3 or KB2 was determined via a baculovirus expression system. 20 l of cell lysate was added to 50 l of luciferase substrate. samples were serially diluted in PBS and used to infect confluent monolayers of MDCK cells. plaques were visualized by immunostaining with polyclonal serum from influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) virus. mice were put under anesthesia using a mix of ketamine-xylazine. the appropriate dose of the virus in a volume of 40 l was administered intranasally. a weight loss of more than 25% of the original (day 0) body weight was considered the humane endpoint. the PB2 open reading frame (ORF) was amplified from a construct in which the packaging signals in the ORF were silently mutated and duplicated between the ORF and the untranslated region (UTR) the complete construct was generated by Infusion HD (Clontech) recombination of the pDZ vector, the PB2 ORF, and the GLuc ORF. PB2 and PB2-GLuc constructs were digested with SacI and BsrGI. mutant 5\u2032 end was replaced with the wild type. all constructs were fully sequenced. the recombinant PB2 was introduced into 293T cells via Lipofectamine 2000. PB2 cellular localization was probed with an anti-PB2 antibody. RNA was stained via silver stain. 18S represents rRNA contamination of the virion preparation. two micrograms of RNA was resolved on a 2.8% polyacrylamide gel. vRNA was visualized by silver stain according to manufacturer's instructions. for immunofluorescence of monoclonal antibodies, MDCK cells were infected at an MOI of 5. secondary antibody (donkey anti-mouse Alexa-Fluor 488 Invitrogen) was incubated with cells for 1 h at RT. novel monoclonal antibodies against the HA stalk region restrict a panel of H1 and H5 viruses. cells were lysed via Luciferase Cell Lysis Buffer (NEB) 20 l of cell lysate was assayed with 50 l of luciferase substrate. for animal samples, 20 l of cell lysate was added to 50 l of luciferase substrate. infected animals were anesthetized via 2.5% isoflurane inhalation. stocks of coelenterazine (5 mg/ml in 2% 3 M HCl in ethanol. 100 g of coelenterazine was injected in a total volume of 150 l intravenously in the retro-orbital plexus. tamivir group received 5 mg/kg twice a day (b.i.d.) for 3 days starting 12 h before virus infection. all animal protocols were approved by the IACUC of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. we infected cells with either the parental PR8 strain or the luciferase virus. at 4 and 8 hpi, we observed no major differences in the signal or localization of the viral PB2 protein. however, we observed eight bands and a loss of intensity from the PB1-PB2 band. the stability of a transgene in an RNA virus is notoriously difficult to obtain. we infected two strains of mice, BALB/c and DBA/2, to represent relatively resistant and susceptible mouse genetic backgrounds. the LD50 for WT PR8 in BALB/c mice is between 50 and 100 PFU. the LD50 for the PR8-GLuc virus is increased by 50 to 100 times. this is comparable to another published infectious reporter IAV. PR8-GLuc monitored the luciferase signal over time via an IVIS Spectrum imager. the virus replicates until the signal peaks around day 4 to 5. with the higher dose (105 PFU), infection peaks earlier and starts declining after day 2. luciferase levels and viral titers from individual animals were plotted against each other from time courses of doses of 103 PFU(G) and 105 PFU (H) luciferase levels and viral titers from individual animals were plotted against each other from time courses of doses of 103 PFU(G) and 105 PFU (H) luciferase levels and viral titers from individual animals were plotted against each other from time courses we infected mice with PR8-GLuc and treated them with either the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir or PBS as a control. we then imaged the animals daily over a 3-day time course. we observed a major difference in the luciferase signals from the lungs between PBS-treated mice and other treatment groups. this experiment provided proof of principle that PR8-GLuc is capable of acting as a metric for therapeutic eff despite strong HA binding and inhibition of viral plaque formation, these antibodies are negative in a hemagglutination inhibition assay. this is characteristic of antibodies which bind the HA stalk domain. we performed ELISAs with a chimeric HA protein consisting of an H6 head and an H1 stalk. GG3 and KB2 restrict PR8-GLuc replication in vivo. mice were treated with 5 mg/kg of the indicated antibodies. mice were then challenged with 5 LD50s of PR8-GLuc. studies of luciferase-expressing viruses in vivo are powerful tools that have already been used to interrogate pathogenesis strategies in both DNA and RNA viral systems. studies of luciferase-expressing viruses in vivo are powerful tools that have already been used to interrogate pathogenesis strategies in both DNA and RNA viral systems. PR8-GLuc has allowed for the development of a method for dynamic, whole-body imaging in which IAV infection and spread can be monitored in a noninvasive manner. we have used PR8-GLuc to characterize novel monoclonal antibodies that bind and neutralize virus of both the H5 and H1 subtypes."}
