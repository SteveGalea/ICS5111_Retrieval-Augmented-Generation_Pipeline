{"summary": "a second emerging coronavirus named Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in humans in 2002 and 2003. atypical pneumonia was fatal in 10% of all patients and 50% of elderly patients. atypical pneumonia was fatal in 10% of all patients and 50% of elderly patients. complex disease phenotypes are regulated by the interactions of oligogenic traits with reduced penetrance, making them extremely difficult to identify and validate in human populations during outbreaks. a new approach designed to dissect the identity and contributions of monogenic and oligogenic variants on multiple traits in complex disease outcomes following acute virus infection in a mouse model of human populations. phenotypically diverse and capture single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion/deletions (In/Dels) at approximately twice the frequency of common variants in human populations. the CC supports precise genetic mapping and serves as a robust validation platform and reference resource for integrative systems genetics applications. mice infected with 105 plaque forming units (PFU) of mouse adapted SARS-CoV. at day four post infection mice were euthanized and tissue collected. a wide range of susceptibilities to SARS-CoV infection was found among the founder strains. weight loss is shown as percent of starting weight at day four post infection. all CAST/EiJ mice died or were humanely euthanized before day four post infection. individual preCC mice are shown in open diamonds, mean values for founders are color coded by strain. AST/EiJ mice are extremely susceptible to SARS-CoV infection. no correlation between viral load in the lung at day four post infection and weight loss (r = -0.014, p = 0.8938). a significant main effect QTL for vascular cuffing explained 26% of the variation in vascular cuffing. we identified a significant main effect QTL for vascular cuffing (Chr 3: 18286790\u201326668414) eosinophil infiltration (Chr 15: 72103120\u201375803414) explained 22% and 26% of the variation in these traits respectively. a significant QTL further influencing vascular cuffing (Chr 13: 52822984\u201354946286), explaining an additional 21% of the variance. the four SARS-CoV susceptibility QTLs with genome region, LOD score, significance and percent of phenotypic variation. the genetic architecture of the preCC provides unique opportunity for narrowing QTL regions to candidate genes or SNPs. to narrow QTL regions we estimated the additive allele effects associated with each haplotype and correlated these to the allelic states. we identified a single founder haplotype altering the phenotype relative to the seven other founder haplotypes. we then used high coverage whole genome sequence from the eight founder strains [37] to identify either private SNPs or small In/Dels in the case of a single causative haplotype. the HrS3 QTL on chromosome 15 was a 3.7 Mb region containing six ncRNAs and 63 genes. there were a total of 71,208 SNPs or small In/Dels in the region. no ncRNAs and only 25 genes contained a private A/J SNP or In/Del. Knockout mice on a C57BL/6J background have previously been reported. groups of age matched Trim55 -/- and C57BL/6J mice were infected with 105 PFU of MA15 for four days. no differences were observed in lung titer at day four post infection. trim55 -/- and C57BL/6J biological replicates were used. experiments were repeated at least three times. transcriptional analysis indicates decreased expression of tight junction genes and increased chemokine expression in C57BL/6J mice compared to that observed in Trim55 -/- mice. a heat map showing a comparison of functionally enriched biological pathways between Trim55 -/- and C57BL/6J mice at days two and four post infection based on RNA expression levels. a/J, C57BL/6J,129S1/SvImJ and NZO/HILtJ mice experienced moderate and transient weight loss. preCC mice infected with SARS-CoV ranged from over 30% weight loss by day four post infection to over 10% weight gain. individual preCC mice are indicated in open diamonds, mean values for the founder strains are shown in color. the dashed line indicates the limit of detection at 100 PFU per lung. viral load in the lung at day four post infection was determined for each surviving preCC mouse. a wide variety of lung pathologies were found across the preCC mice. hyaline membrane formation and pulmonary edema with accompanying inflammation in the alveoli was a hallmark of SARS-CoV infection in human cases. hyaline membrane formation was observed in 13% of preCC mice at day four post-infection. multiple genetic loci contribute to aspects of SARS-CoV pathogenesis. we genotyped 140 preCC animals at high density, including several that succumbed to infection prior to the scheduled day four harvest. we identified four QTLs shown in Fig 4, HrS1-4 (Host response to SARS) that contributed to disease associated phenotypes at day four post infection. Table 1 details each of the SARS-CoV susceptibility QTLs including LOD and p-values. analysis of other phenotypes did not lead to discovery of QTLs passing the p0.01 significance threshold. the genetic architecture of the preCC provides unique opportunity for narrowing QTL regions to candidate genes or SNPs. to narrow QTL regions we estimated the additive allele effects associated with each haplotype and correlated these to the allelic states at candidate causative polymorphisms. the HrS2 QTL on chromosome 16 was a 5.4 Mb region containing 92 genes and 30 ncRNAs. seven ncRNAs and 74 genes had private PWK/PhJ SNPs or In/Dels. no ncRNAs and only 25 genes contained a private A/J SNP. we further prioritized based on major functional changes. we reduced the region to only one ncRNA and nine genes. a total of 461,46 SNPs were private to CAST/EiJ. eosin stained lung sections showed significantly reduced vascular cuffing in the lungs of Trim55 -/- (mean score of 0.69) compared to control animals (mean score of 1.15) no differences were observed in lung titer at day four post infection. mice (n = 6) have lower percentages of monocytes (p0.01, t-test), specifically Ly6C low staining monocytes (p = 0.001, t-test), in their lungs than do C57BL/6J controls (n = 6) as measured by flow cytometry. RNA was isolated from the lungs of mock and infected control. enriched biological pathways between trim55 -/- and C57BL/6J mice at days two and four post infection based on RNA expression levels in the lung. three mice used per condition, per timepoint. Experiment performed once. granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis involved in granulocyte adhesion. in vivo models of perivascular cuffing have shown that vascular cuffing increases in cases of severe disease [21,22,35] and vascular congestion was observed in human SARS-CoV patients [7]. a recent study of pneumococcal infection [51] identified several QTL governing disease susceptibility including one on chromosome 13. there was no overlap between their genetic analysis to that phenotype. the collaborative cross provides a significant advantage in comparison to two-way crosses and other bi-allelic RI strain panels. the inclusion of a diverse set of founder strains increases the likelihood of variants existing at loci that can influence any given trait. trim55 and trim63 mediate muscle cell protein turnover through their E3 ubiquitin-ligase activities and function in muscle wasting phenotypes [40,43,55] trim55 specifically functions in myosin and myofibril maintenance and knockdown studies correlate Trim55 levels with modified post-translational microtubule modifications and defects in myofibril assembly. inflammatory cell transmigration requires the formation of actin-myosin II contractile structures attached to tight junction membranes by VE-cadherins. inflammatory cell transmigration requires the formation of actin-myosin II contractile structures which are attached to tight junction membranes by VE-cadherins. studies of Trim55 and Cdhr2 function within the CC population will allow further insight into the role that these two genes play during SARS-CoV pathogenesis and recovery. the collaborative cross was conceived of as a resource to drive insight into a variety of biomedically important diseases via the reassortment of genetic variants and expansion of phenotypic ranges. alleles from all three wild-derived founders impacted perivascular cuffing or viral titer levels independent of their effects on clinical disease or SARS-CoV mortality. these data support the hypothesis that the CC population represents a robust platform for developing improved animal models that more readily replicate disease phenotypes seen in humans. 8\u201320 week old female pre-CC mice were bred at UNC Chapel Hill under specific pathogen free conditions. one preCC mouse per line was infected, for the founder strains at day four. all experiments were approved by the UNC Chapel Hill Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. in 50 L of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Gibco), mock infected animals received only 50 L of PBS. animals were weighed daily and at four days post infection, animals were euthanized via Isoflurane overdose.
