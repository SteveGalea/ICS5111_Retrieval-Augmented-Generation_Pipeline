{"summary": "three amino acid residues differ between the L1 sequences of the HPV16 crystal and PsV. two positons in the EF loop (Q177N and Q181N) and one position in the FG loop (A266T) these sequence differences did not appear to adversely impact on the quality of the HPV16 L1 homology model which had a global model quality estimation score of 1.00. the estimated loop distance between homology models was considered significant if the distance measured between HPV16 and a non-vaccine genotype was greater than the RMS value generated by the pairwise comparison of the homology models. all the non-vaccine Alpha-9 genotypes were predicted to have structural changes in the EF loop compared to the HPV16 model. the FG amino acid sequence of HPV31, HPV33 and HPV58 contained no residue deletions or deletions in comparison with HPV16. the three L1 homology models representing these non-vaccine genotypes were predicted to have structural changes compared to HPV16 homology model within the HI loop of HPV16. the predicted structural differences between the L1 loops of the non-vaccine Alpha-9 PsV compared to the HPV16 PsV were used to inform the design of chimeric PsV. cross-neutralising antibodies demonstrate minimal recognition of this genotype. the number of amino acid residues substituted between HPV31 and HPV35 differed between the three loops. the HI, which is the shortest L1 loop, varied at nine of its sixteen amino acid positions. the cross-neutralising titres generated against the chimeric L1L2 PsV with a HPV31 backbone were compared against the HPV31 PsV. the titres generated against the chimeric L1L2 PsV with a HPV35 backbone were compared against the HPV35 PsV. the largest impact of any single or combination loop swap was observed with the HPV35 FG loop alone which resulted in a median decrease in cross-neutralising antibody recognition of the HPV35 PsV. however, the introduction of the HPV31 FG loop into the HPV35 L1 backbone significantly increased cross-neutralising antibody recognition of the HPV35 PsV. the replacement of the DE and FG loops within the HPV35 L1 backbone with those of HPV31 significantly increased recognition of the HPV35 PsV. the residues were selected to undergo site-directed mutagenesis to determine their contribution to the epitope footprint recognised by cross-neutralising antibodies. a panel of seven chimeric L1L2 PsV with a HPV35 backbone and HPV31 DE and FG loops were generated. the chimeric PsV particles generated were of a similar size and had similar PI ratios. the dual amino switches of G139N and P140S reduced cross-neutralising antibody recognition by a median 1.6-fold (IQR, 1.2 to 2.0-fold; Wilcoxon paired signed-rank test, p 0.001). p values obtained using the Wilcoxon paired signed-rank test represent differences in neutralisation titre between the chimeric PsV with a. the amino acid switches within the FG were separated into the early region (HPV16 numbering: Ala264 to Lys278) and the late region (Gly279 to Ser288) of the loop. the most dramatic impact was observed by the dual amino acid deletion at positions S281Del and G282Del which produced a cross-neutralising titre. the EF loop (Q177N and Q181N) and one position in the FG loop (A266T) these sequence differences did not appear to adversely impact upon the quality of the HPV16 L1 homology model. the homology models representing the remaining Alpha-9 genotypes produced GMQE scores of 0.99 (HPV31 and HPV35) and 0.98 (HPV33, HPV52 and HPV58). a top view of HPV16 L1 surface-filled model with the BC, DE, EF, FG and HI loops highlighted. key indicates distance from HPV16 with (-) indicating that it was not possible to resolve any potential differences between loops. genomes of HPV33, HPV52 and HPV58 had single amino acid residue deletions within the EF loop of HPV16. the predicted structural changes in the EF loops of HPV31, HPV35 and HPV52 were not underpinned by amino acid residue insertions or deletions. chimeric L1L2 PsV with inter-genotype loop swaps were used to inform design of chimeric PsV with inter-genotype loop swaps. the loops of the non-vaccine Alpha-9 genotypes were more likely to be recognised by vaccine-induced cross-neutralising antibodies. both the FG and HI loops were chosen for further investigation based on their predicted structural similarity between HPV16 and HPV16. chimeric L1L2 PsV with either a HPV31 or HPV35 backbone varied at nine of its sixteen amino acid positions. single (DE, FG & HI), double (DEFG, DEHI & FGHI) or triple (DEFGHI) loop swaps generated similarly-sized particles and particle-to-infectivity ratios. chimeric L1L2 PsV constructs: HPV31 (white), HPV35 (grey), HPV31 L1 backbone with HPV35 loop switches (blue) and HPV35 L1 backbone with HPV31 loop switches (red) p values obtained using the Wilcoxon paired signed-rank test represent differences in neutralisation titre between either the HPV31 PsV and the chimeric PsV with a HPV35 backbone. cross-neutralising antibody recognition of the HPV35 PsV was not supported by either the introduction of the HPV31 DE or HI loop into the HPV35 backbone. this effect was most dramatic when the FG loop was in combination with the DE loop of HPV31, resulting in a median increase in cross-neutralising antibody recognition of the HPV35 PsV. 95% CI, 16 to 26 by both Cervarix\u00ae and Gardasil\u00ae sera (GMT 2,024; 95% CI, 3,349 to 6,325; p 0.001) the de and FG loop amino acid sequences of HPV16, HPV31 and HPV35 were aligned. these residues were selected to undergo site-directed mutagenesis. a panel of seven chimeric L1L2 PsV with a HPV35 backbone and HPV31 DE and FG loops were generated. these chimeric PsV harboured single or double amino acid residue switches. the amino acids present in HPV31 were swapped for the amino acids present at those positions in HPV35. colour indicates L1L2 PsV constructs: HPV35 (grey), HPV35 backbone and HPV31 DE and FG loops (red), HPV35 L1 backbone with HPV31 DE and FG loops with DE or FG amino acids switches (green). p values obtained using the Wilcoxon paired signed-rank test represent differences in neutralisation titre between the chimeric PsV with a HPV35 backbone and HPV31 DE and FG loops a significant reduction in cross-neutralising antibody recognition was observed by the dual amino acid deletion at positions S281Del and G282Del which produced a cross-neutralising titre. however, the most dramatic impact was observed by the dual amino acid switch at positions S271T and T274A within the early region of the FG which did not result in a reduction in cross-neutralising antibody recognition. predicted structural differences between HPV16 and non-vaccine Alpha-9 genotypes were common in the BC and EF loops located on the outer rim of the L1 capsomer. the surface-exposed L1 loop regions of the HPV capsid demonstrate a higher degree of sequence heterogeneity than the core regions. the pairwise comparison between the HPV35 L1 homology model and the HPV35 L1 capsomer crystal structure41 demonstrated a close structural relationship. these data imply that in the absence of available L1 crystal structures, homology models have utility as surrogate structures for the prediction of structural differences between L1 proteins. the chimeric L1L2 PsV demonstrated that the FG loop is necessary and sufficient for the epitope footprints of a significant proportion of cross-neutralising antibody specificities. two or more L1 loops appear to contribute towards the majority of identified L1 MAb epitopes. the early region of the FG loop is known to harbour residues involved in the epitope footprints of type-specific, neutralising HPV31 MAbs16. the late region contains the majority of residues involved in the epitope footprints of type-specific, neutralising HPV16 MAbs14. cross-neutralising antibodies appear to recognise a single non-vaccine Alpha-9 genotype. tralise non-vaccine Alpha-9 genotypes may further our understanding of the L1 domains recognised by cross-neutralising antibodies elicited by the HPV vaccines. we propose that the L1 domain recognised by inter-genotype cross-neutralising antibodies elicited by the HPV vaccines comprise residues within the late region of the FG loop possibly stabilised by one or more residues within the DE loop. L1 genes with HPV31 or HPV35 backbones and reciprocal inter-genotype loop swaps were synthesised by GeneArt\u00ae. chimeric L1L2 PsV carrying a luciferase reporter were expressed and purified as previously described33. study samples were available from 12\u201315 year old girls randomised to receive three doses of Cervarix\u00ae or Gardasil\u00ae. a subset of samples (Cervarix\u00ae n = 19; Gardasil\u00ae n = 17) taken 1 month after receiving the final dose, were selected for analysis based on HPV31 cross-neutralisation antibody titres23. the test was performed using the statistical package, Stata 12.1 (StataCorp LP) L1 homology models were created from the L1 amino acid sequences of L1L2 PsV representing HPV16, HPV31, HPV33, HPV35, HPV52 and HPV58. L1 genes were subcloned into the p31sheLL or p35sheLL plasmids in conjunction with the Rapid DNA Dephos & Ligation kit (Roche) chimeric L1L2 PsV carrying a luciferase reporter were expressed and purified as previously described. ervarix\u00ae n = 19; Gardasil\u00ae n = 17) taken 1 month after receiving the final dose, were selected for analysis based on HPV31 cross-neutralisation antibody titres23. the antibody titre resulting in an 80% reduction in the luciferase signal produced by control wells containing PsV.
