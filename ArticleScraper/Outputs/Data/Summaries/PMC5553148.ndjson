{"summary": "the aim of this study was to determine the alterations in the lipid profile, plasma alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, total and direct bilirubin levels of neonatal calves with diarrhea. a total of 25 calves with diarrhea as experimental group and 10 healthy calves as control group were enrolled in the study. bovine placenta does not permit the passive transfer of antibody to the fetus. failure of passive transfer predisposes neonates to infection and septicemia. lipids play an important role on synthesis of organic substances together with carbohydrates and proteins. low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) carries cholesterol to peripheral tissues. high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) that transfers cholesterol to the liver is produced from degradation of LDL-C. infections and inflammations impair lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, like lipid oxidation and cholesterol transport to stimulate anti-inflammatory response. plasma levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C, ALP, direct and total bilirubin were determined colorimetrically. VLDL-C was calculated as [VLDL-C = Triglyceride (mg/dL)/5] in case triglyceride was 400 mg/dL. n-25 p ALP (U/L) 73.563.52 82.722.20 0.05 Total bilirubin (mg/dL) 0.130.02 0.240.01 0.01 Direct bilirubin (mg/dL) 0.0410.003 0.1190.010 0.01 Triglyceride (mg/dL) 23.760.99 33.681.13 0.01 Total cholesterol (mg/dL) 87.242.88 55.611.49 0. plasma levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C, ALP, direct and total bilirubin were determined colorimetrically (Epoch, BioTek, USA) using commercial kits (DDS-Turkey) VLDL-C and LDL-C levels were calculated according to the Friedewald formula. newborn calves are susceptible to neonatal calf diarrhea especially during their first 28 days of life. calf becomes dehydrated and suffers from electrolyte loss and acidosis. plasma lipids and lipoproteins are synthesized by the liver and released into the bloodstream. plasma triglyceride concentrations are reported to variable in acute cases. but hepatic triglyceride production is always elevated due to an increase in free fatty acids release from lipid deposits. plasma triglyceride levels are associated with enzymes that are effective in hepatic triglyceride production and with VLDL secretion. cholesterol levels are known to increase in nephrotic syndrome or protein-losing nephropathy, hypothyroidism, acute pancreatitis and cholestasis, while decreasing in protein-losing enteropathy, hypoadrenocorticism and in acute inflammatory responses. the lipolysis of fat tissue along with increase in concentration of de novo synthesized fatty acids increase triglyceride production in the liver and consequently increases VLDL secretion total bilirubin increases in hemolysis, primary liver injury and bile duct inflammation. direct bilirubin increases in hepatic diseases and bile duct inflammation."}
