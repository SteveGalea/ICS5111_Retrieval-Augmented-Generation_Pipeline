{"summary": "over sixty percent of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, and over seventy percent of those zoonoses have a wildlife origin [20], including highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), sylvatic plague, Lyme disease, anthrax, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) these diseases increase burdens on public health systems and negatively impact the world economy. emerging infectious diseases of wildlife origin are increasing globally at alarming rates, in both incidence and by geographic location. globalization, including the rising amounts of international human travel and trade in animal- and plant-based products and other goods, potentiates the spread of pathogens [21,23,24,35,49,51] emerging infectious diseases are also driven by socio-economic, environmental, and ecological factors, including ecological disruption. a new fingerprinting capability has extended the capacity to determine which mercury sources contribute to fish, wildlife, and human exposures. one health acknowledges that human, domestic animal, and wildlife health are interconnected within the context of ecosystem health. bush-meat hunting is a complex issue with environmental and food security consequences if bush-meat hunting is a complex issue. opportunities for a one health approach Emerging infectious diseases have non-random global patterns of emergence [20], and development of the ability to appropriately predict, detect, and respond to emerging infectious diseases is crucial. advances in molecular biology have opened new avenues for the identification and detection of pathogens and to define disease risks. a recent outbreak of peste de Petits Ruminants in saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica mongolica) went unrecognized for several months, resulting in loss of approximately 50% of the population. surveillance in wildlife populations can provide an early detection, rapid response system for the agriculture and public health sectors. epidemiological studies to determine disease causation allow the development of interventions based on temporal and spatial separation of humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. the HPAI H5N8 virus quickly spread along the Pacific Flyway of the us. the virus was responsible for the costliest animal disease emergency event ever documented in the us. by march and April of 2015, new infection foci were established in the US Midwest. the interagency Steering Committee led the implementation of the US National Surveillance Plan for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenzas in wild birds [19] through that plan, over 77,000 wild birds were successfully tested for HPAI by January 2017. the program has effectively provided early warnings to the poultry industry, agricultural officials, wildlife agencies, conservation programs, wildlife rehabilitators, zoos, and public health officials. the one health approach toward detecting and managing avian influenzas in the us has been successful because of several factors, the primary one being effective collaboration. the interagency Steering Committee was able to rapidly develop national surveillance strategies and plans. this could not have been possible without policy-level support, which facilitated the commitment of participating agencies to work together. growth, agricultural and urban development pose substantial risks to global health, food security, and ecological sustainability. occurrences of emerging infectious diseases persist, but rate at which emerging infectious diseases are observed will also increase [6]"}
