{"summary": "guinea pigs can be infected with, and transmit human influenza viruses. sensitivity of the immune response supports the utility of the guinea pig as a useful animal model. ferrets have been used to derive serotyping reagents for assessing antigenic distance between isolates and potential vaccine strains. recent reports suggest ferrets may not faithfully mimic human immune responses. serological tests using ferret sera may not accurately assess vaccine strain efficacy. guinea pigs have many attractive features for use as an animal model for influenza. guinea pigs appear to be centered largely in the upper naso-respiratory tract. a recent study showed acute viral replication and moderate virulence of the highly pathogenic 1918 pandemic and H5N1 viruses in addition to low-pathogenicity avian and human H1N1 viruses in guinea pigs. guinea pigs were in the range of 5 104 and 2 105 pfu/mL of nasal wash fluid. the guinea pigs received a second inoculation of virus on week 5. titers rose from 1:100 to 1:10,000 after the second infection with live virus. by week 9, a significant increase in titer, 64-fold over pre-infected sera, was detectable. by week 9, this peak titer decreased slightly. antiviral HI titers for both groups of HA-immunized animals increased after the second, third, and fourth inoculation. the inflections of the HI titer graphs roughly paralleled the anti-HA ELISA titers throughout the study. after the final boost at week 10, HI titers continued to rise (91- to 128-fold increase over the negative control) serum pools from sequential bleeds of infected guinea pigs were tested for binding to a library of overlapping Wyoming HA peptides. prior to inoculation with virus, sera showed potential reactivity to Peptides 141, 285, and 327 (Panel A) sera from HA-immunized guinea pigs reacted with Peptides 141 and 327. as the mock-immunized guinea pigs aged, they developed measurable reactivity to Peptide 81, which overlaps the E epitope. ELISA of serum pools from guinea pigs immunized with recombinant HA protein was analyzed. animals initially increased overall reactivity against most of the representative peptides in the panel with enhanced reactivity against Peptides 81, 141, 165, and 327 (Panel B2). Immediately prior to the second boost, reactivity against many of the peptides decreased and reactivity primarily against 81, 141 and 327 was seen (Panel C2). after boosting, weak reactivity against Peptide 45, in the C epitope ACKRRSNKSFFSRLNWLTHLK 165 Immunized No B NVTMPNNEKFDKLYIWGV 285 Pre-Immune Yes C NGSIPNDKPFQNVNRITY 327 All Yes none QTRGIFGAIAGFIENGWE 453 Infected No none KQLRENAEDMGNGCFKIY 483 Immunized No none NGTYDHDVYRDEALNNRF Mapping reactive peptides to 3-D structure. panel A shows the monomer structure file of the related H3N2 HA glycoprotein of A/X-31 (H3N2) colorized to identify the locations of the major epitopes A (green), B (red), C (pink), D (yellow), and E (orange) the structure was drawn from 1HGG.pbd using PyMOL [30]. guinea pigs were in the range of 5 104 and 2 105 pfu/mL of nasal wash fluid. serum pools were tested for total HA-binding antibodies by reactivity to full-length HA protein. group 2 HI titers were not detectable 5 weeks after initial infection. by week 9, a significant increase in titer, 64-fold over pre-infected sera, was detectable. in the following three weeks, this peak titer decreased slightly. antiviral HI titers for both groups of HA-immunized animals increased after the second, third, and fourth inoculation. the inflections of the HI titer graphs roughly paralleled the anti-HA ELISA titers throughout the study. sera from group 1 (negative control) remained negative throughout the study. lane 2: Group 2 (influenza infected) sera 1:1500, Lane 3: is Group 3 (immunized with lower concentration of HA protein) sera 1:3000, Lane 4: is Group 4 (immunized with higher concentration of HA protein) sera 1:3000. serum pools from sequential bleeds of infected guinea pigs were tested for binding to a library of overlapping Wyoming HA peptides. serum pools from guinea pigs immunized with recombinant HA protein were analyzed for recognition of linear epitopes by reactivity to overlapping peptides bound to microtiter plates. reactivity to the peptides from sera was compared to the results from the pre-infected sera. activity against most of the peptides in the panel with enhanced reactivity against Peptides 81, 141, 165, and 327 (Panel B2) decreased and reactivity primarily against 81, 141 and 327 (Panel C2) persisted through the study. after boosting, weak reactivity against Peptide 45, in the C epitope, and strong activity against Peptide 483, outside defined epitopes, were observed (Pane RLN 141 All Yes A RRSNKSFFSRLNWLTHLK 165 Immunized No B NVTMPNNEKFDKLYIWGV 285 Pre-Immune Yes C NGSIPNDKPFQNVNRITY 327 All Yes none QTRGIFGAIAGFIENGWE 453 Infected No none KQLRENAEDMGNGCFKIY 483 Immunized No none NGTYDHDVYRDEALNNRF Mapping reactive peptides to 3- panel A shows the monomer structure file of the related H3N2 HA glycoprotein of A/X-31 (H3N2) colorized to identify the locations of the major epitopes A (green), B (red), C (pink), D (yellow), and E (orange). panel C shows peptides recognized by infected Guinea pig sera: peptides 9, 141, 327 and 453 (peptides colorized in shades of cyan). guinea pigs readily seroconvert in response to both intranasal inoculations of virus and immunizations with the same recombinant HA glycoprotein. ELISA titers rose to approximately 1:100 titers after single inoculations with either infectious virus or purified HA antigen. a pepScan analysis was conducted to map the linear B cell epitopes. it was intended to correlate immunological reactivity with previous data. previous studies with this type of analysis failed to detect linear epitopes within the HA glycoprotein. serum from the high dose immunization group showed increased reactivity to peptides 141 and 135 which both represent a highly variable and immunogenic loop of Epitope A [23] reactivities to additional peptides (9, 327, 453, and 483) derived from regions outside of previously defined epitopes were observed after multiple immunizations and two infectious innocula. future studies have been planned to characterize the PepScan reactivities of sera from humans infected or immunized with influenza A/Wyoming/03/2003. the current study has provided valuable immunogenicity data to further characterize immune responses in a relatively new animal model for human influenza infection and vaccination. the change in pepScan profiles over the course of the immunization and infection regimens appeared to reflect maturation of the humoral immune responses to linear epitopes. it may be possible to refocus the immune response towards more highly conserved epitopes to derive a more broadly cross-protective influenza vaccine. hemagglutinin (HA) was produced in stably transformed S2 drosophila cells. the gene was subcloned from a parental plasmid vector into pMT-BiP-V5-His. sequences encoding a hexahistadine tract were inserted. eluted samples were concentrated and buffers exchanged after each chromatography step using filtration spin-cartridges with 30,000 molecular weight cut-off membranes. protein yield and purity were determined using the Pierce Coomassie Protein assay reagent with a bovine serum albumin standard. a mock preparation of the HA ectodomain protein was produced using the above expression and purification methods. ly immunized with recombinant HA protein in Complete Freund's Adjuvant. boosted at weeks 3, 5, and 10 with HA protein in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant. initial experimental design also included a comparison of increasing antigen load.
