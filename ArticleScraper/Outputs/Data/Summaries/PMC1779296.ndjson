{"summary": "passive transfer of relatively high concentrations of neutralizing antibodies can protect against challenge with a range of viruses in animal models and in humans. protection in some cases is in the form of sterilizing immunity, i.e., no viral replication is observed following challenge. guinea pig and mouse models use EBOVs that have been serially passaged to adapt to replication in the respective animals. antibody neutralizes ZEBOV with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.05\u20130.3 g/ml and an IC90 of 0.5\u20132.6 g/ml in vero cells [11,14] and an IC50 of approximately 0.05\u20131 g/ml and a IC90 of 0.5\u20132 g/ neutralizing equine neutralizing IgG protected baboons from 30 LD50 (50% lethal dose) equine neutralizing IgG protected baboons from 0.6 LD50 ZEBOV challenge. antibody was passively transferred to rhesus macaques followed by challenge with the 1995 isolate 24 h later. the results for the four antibody-treated animals show a steady increase in plasma viremia up to 105\u2013107 pfu/ml on day 7. the second bolus of antibody given on day 4 did not appear to have any impact on the rate of increase of plasma virus. the serum KZ52 antibody levels on day 4 were in the approximate range 200\u2013400 g/ml (Table 1). the two control monkeys, EHD (untreated and challenged), and a negative monkey (neither treated nor challenged) had very similar background levels of reactivity to the glycoprotein and anti-human antibody as each of the treated monkeys before treatment. all of these viruses were sensitive to KZ52 so that essentially 100% neutralization was observed in vitro at 40 and 400 g/ml KZ52 in a plaque assay using vero E6 target cells. the levels of virus in different organs and immunohistochemistry were surveyed postmortem. a large immunoreactive monocyte is observed in a blood Vessel in the Kidney of Monkey CH57 Postmortem. a large immunoreactive monocyte is observed in a blood vessel in the Kidney of Monkey CH57. three of the treated animals were euthanized when moribund at day 9 or 10 post infection. the fourth animal showed a decrease in plasma viral load after the peak. it survived to day 28 before becoming moribund when it too was euthanized. a 50-mg/kg dose typically produces serum mAb concentrations in animals on the order of 500 g/ml after injection. the neutralization titer of KZ52 (IC90) for ZEBOV is on the order of 0.5\u20132.5 g/ml. these concentrations typically provide sterilizing immunity against challenge by a number of viruses. al lymph nodes were high (104\u2013106 pfu/g) in the control and three of the four treated animals (to day 28) however, monkey CH46 showed some major histopathological differences from the other infected monkeys and from the norm for ZEBOV infection. eactive monocytes are observed in a blood Vessel in the Kidney of Monkey CH57 Postmortem. similar cells were observed in analysis of monkeys CH83 and CH56. a plausible hypothesis would still allow for an important contribution of antibody to vaccine protection. mAb KZ52 was able to provide protection from disease following ZEBOV challenge in the guinea pig model. immunity was not sterilizing and some viral replication was noted. previous in vitro studies using isolated human monocytes/macrophages did not find evidence of infectivity-enhancing antibodies. rhesus macaques (weight, 3.9\u20134.4 kg) 1 d before challenge (day 0) with 1,000 pfu intramuscularly of the 1995 ZEBOV (Kikwit) isolate. one monkey was not given any antibody treatment. viremia was determined by counting pfu on vero E6 cell monolayers. cells grown to confluence were given 0.2 ml of plasma with and without additional KZ52. after absorption, cells were overlaid with 2 ml of EMEM containing 5% FBS, 25 mM HEPES buffer, 50-g gentamicin per ml, and 1% agarose. 293 cells were transfected with a mammalian expression plasmid coding for transmembrane domain-deleted Ebola glycoprotein. supernatant (100 l) from these cells, which contains 0.8\u20131.3 mg/ml total protein, was used to coat each well for 1 h. plates were then washed six times with wash buffer. ing was performed with Dako's Serum-Free Protein Block for 20 min pre-antibody exposure. the tissue sections were then incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C in primary antibody. negative controls included replicate sections exposed to anti-Marburg virus antibodies and uninfected cynomolgus macaque tissue. plasma viremia and viral loads in organs was determined by plaque assay. plasma were titrated from 101 to 106 dilutions. cells grown to confluence in 6-well plates were given 0.2 ml of plasma. the cells were removed from the humidified 37 \u00b0C incubator to visualize plaques with an inverted phase microscope. 2 ml of neutral red (1:6,000 final concentration; Sigma-Aldrich, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com) was added to each well. after an additional 24-h incubation, the plaques were counted [11,30]. phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human immunoglobulin G (IgG) against the F(ab\u2032)2 portion of the antibody (Pierce, http://www.piercenet.com) diluted 1:500 was added, and this was incubated for 1 h. the plates were read at an optical density of 405 nm on a microplate reader. positive controls included archived EBOV-infected cynomolgus tissue. negative controls included replicate sections exposed to anti-Marburg virus antibodies."}
