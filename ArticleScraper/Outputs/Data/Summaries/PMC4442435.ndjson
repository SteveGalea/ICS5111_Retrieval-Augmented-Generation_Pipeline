{"summary": "fusion glycoproteins project from virion membranes and operate by bringing virion and host cell membranes into proximity. proteases cleave fusion protein precursors to form domains that catalyze membrane melding. this proteolytic step is termed \u201cpriming\u201d and depending on the virus type, it may take place in virus-producing cells. TMPRSS2 and the TTSP human airway trypsin-like protease are also sufficient to prime LP IAV, both in vitro (13) and in vivo (14). cell surface proteases may be strictly required to prime LP IAV (15) target cell virus receptors would coreside with priming proteases to make virus priming feasible (7). TEMs contain a variety of integral membrane proteases (22) and reduced by CD81 depletion (24). we used both coVs and IAVs to address the importance of TEMs in cell entry. TEMs contain a variety of integral membrane proteases (22). pcDNA3.1-229E-S-C9 and pcDNA3.1-hAPN plasmids were provided by university of Minnesota. pcDNA3.1-HA5-QH-trypsin site was provided by Lijun Rong, University of Illinois\u2014Chicago and was previously described. pcDNA3.1-murine carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (mCEACAM) was described previously. pNL4.3-HIVluc (luc stands for luciferase) plasmid was provided by the NIH AIDS Research and Reference library. pEGFP-S15-mCherry (EGFP stands for enhanced green fluorescent protein) (28) was provided by Edward Campbell, Loyola University Chicago. monoclonal mouse antibodies against transferrin receptor (clone H68.4) were obtained from BD Pharmingen. za A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8) containing a Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) reporter gene (29) was provided by Peter Palese, Mount Sinai School of Medicine. recombinant mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV), MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM were produced. 293T cells were cotransfected with pNL4.3-HIV-luc and pcDNA plasmids. supernatants were collected, centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 min. pEGFP-S15-mCherry was also cotransfected. cell fluorescence detected using a BD C6 Accuri flow cytometer. cell fluorescence was detected using a BD C6 Accuri flow cytometer. all flow cytometric data were analyzed using FlowJo software. DBT cells were transfected with 0.5 g of pEGFP and 4 g of a pCAGGS empty vector or TMPRSS2 plasmid per 106 cells. cells were lifted with trypsin, washed three times with cold PBS. the cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS, incubated for 30 min at 4\u00b0C with 1 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) in PBS, rinsed, and then incubated for 20 min at 4\u00b0C with 100 mM glycine in PBS. lysates were mixed with equal volumes of 80% (wt/vol) sucrose in MES buffer. proteins in gradient fractions were bound to streptavidin agarose beads (Pierce) nonreducing dot blotting and Western blotting procedures were used to identify the distribution of proteins in gradient fractions. DBT cells were maintained in a humidified environment at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. codon-optimized MERS S-containing sequences for a C-terminal C9 epitope tag were purchased from Genscript and subsequently cloned into pcDNA3.1+ between the EcoRI and NotI restriction sites. pCMVSport6-human CD9 was purchased from Open Biosystems. CD9 and scramble control short hairpin RNA constructs flanked by the U6 promoter and a RNA polymerase III stop sequence were engineered into the pUC57 vector by Genscript. or 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse, and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Thermo Scientific. influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8) containing a Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) reporter gene (29) was provided by Peter Palese, Mount Sinai School of Medicine. supernatants were collected, centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min to remove cell debris, and stored in aliquots at 80\u00b0C. 293T cells were cotransfected with pNL4.3-HIV-luc and pcDNA plasmids encoding appropriate glycoproteins. the viruses indicated in the figures were then added for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. for PR8, cells were not lysed, and media were analyzed for secreted Gluc. for other viruses, cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega) mCherry fluorescence was detected using a BD C6 flow cytometer or a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer as indicated. the cells were rinsed three times by pelleting and resuspension. mCherry fluorescence was detected using a fluorescence-activated cell sorting software. images were deconvolved with SoftWoRx deconvolution software. images were deconvolved using a 1.4-numerical-aperture lens objective. samples were centrifuged with a Beckman SW60 rotor at 370,000 g for 18 h at 4\u00b0C. proteins in gradient fractions were bound to streptavidin agarose beads (Pierce) murine DBT cells were incubated for 30 min with mouse monoclonal antibodies against the CD9, CD63, and CD81 tetraspanins or with an equimolar mixture of the three (anti-Tspan) the cells were inoculated with luciferase-expressing recombinant MHV-A59 or MHV-JHM for 2 h, and then unadsorbed viruses were rinsed away. cells were infected with recombinant MHV-A59 or MHV-JHM viruses. after a 2-h entry period, unadsorbed antibody and virus were removed. at 8 hpi, infection levels were measured by quantifying Fluc reporter gene products. transfected 2935 cells with plasmids encoding HAT or TMPRSS2. tetraspanin antibodies did not inhibit VSV pp transductions. tetraspanin antibodies inhibit coronaviruses at the cell entry stage. tetraspanin antibodies impaired transduction by all three CoV pp preparations. tetraspanin antibodies were inhibitory only at the pp entry stage. inhibition by the tetraspanin antibodies was not related to the viral particle core, as HIV-based MERS pp were blocked equally to VSV-based MERS pp. SV pp bearing the spike proteins from 229E, MERS, or SARS virus were inoculated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. unadsorbed virus and antibody were then removed from cells. transduction levels were measured by quantifying fluc reporter gene products. tetraspanin antibodies did slightly reduce the fluorescence intensities of the MERS pp-bound cells. tetraspanin antibodies only modestly interfered with virus binding to cells. 2935 cells were incubated without antibodies (No Abs) or with indicated antibodies. flow cytometry was performed to detect bound HIV-based pp. mCherry pp without protruding glycoproteins (Bald) or with VSV G, IAV HA, or MERS-CoV S were mixed with anti-CD81 antibodies. after a 10-min, 37\u00b0C patching period, cells were fixed and analyzed. TEMs are known to contain a variety of cell surface proteases (22), among which may be one or several coV- and IAV-priming proteases (7, 8, 13, 14) this led us to hypothesize that tetraspanin antibodies interfere with TEM-associated proteolytic priming, possibly by preventing TEM proteases from accessing receptor-bound viruses. fected with 0.004 g of TMPRSS2 plasmid contained TMPRSS2 protein levels that were far below our Western blot and immunofluorescence assay detection limits. even small amounts of priming proteases nullify the antiviral effects of tetraspanin antibodies. cells were transfected with increasing amounts of TMPRSS2 plasmid and a small amount of GFP reporter. the results indicated that HAT bypassed the antibody blockades in a dose-dependent manner. however, trypsin-pretreated viruses also bypassed the antibody blockades. TMPRSS2, HAT, and trypsin proteases apply to tetraspanin antibodies. the results showed that CD9 supports MERS at the level of S-protein-mediated virus entry. these cells were transfected with an empty vector (CD9 cDNA) or a vector containing CD9 cDNA. transduction levels were measured by fluc reporter gene expression. TEMs contain coronavirus receptors and priming proteases. the findings fit with the hypothesis that infecting viruses encounter cell receptors and priming proteases. we designated the CHAPS LD subcellular fractions as \u201cTEMs\u201d and the TX-100 LD fractions as \u201clipid rafts\u201d. the surfaces of 2935 cells were biotinylated before lysis with CHAPS or TX-100. each fraction was analyzed for cell surface CD9, CD63, and CD81. cells overexpressing the virus-priming proteases TMPRSS2 and HAT were similarly fractionated. roughly 50% of these proteases were found in the TEM fractions. some of the TMPRSS2 and HAT that was not found in TEM (LD) fractions may come from shedding of the flag-tagged TMPR ectodomain fragments into soluble (HD material) a catalytically inactive mutant TMPRSS2S441A was also observed. enzymatic activity has no effect on subcellular localization. TEMs prime coronaviruses and influenza A viruses for entry. bypass of leupeptin was pronounced when MERS pp were exposed to trypsin or to TEMs containing overexpressed TMPRSS2 but did not reach the levels observed in the absence of leupeptin. the HD fractions included all soluble proteins as well as 80% of the plasma membrane proteins. these findings indicated that MERS entry-priming activities were greatly concentrated in the TEMs. 2935 cells were infected with PR8 that was treated with trypsin, TEMs isolated from untransfected cells, or TEMs from HAT-overexpressing cells. TEM fractions activated PR8 infectivities, nearly as much as TEMs with overexpressed HAT. tetraspanins facilitate the entry of many viruses, including hepatitis C virus (34), human papillomavirus (35), and IAV (23). to determine whether entering CoVs also utilize tetraspanins, we evaluated the effects of tetraspanin antibodies on infection by mouse hepatitis virus strains A59 and JHM. 81 or an equimolar mixture of the three tetraspanin antibodies (Tspan) cells were infected with recombinant MHV-A59 or MHV-JHM viruses containing a firefly luciferase (Fluc) reporter gene. after a 2-h entry period, unadsorbed antibody and virus were removed. tetraspanin antibodies inhibit influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1), also known as PR8 IAV. for ease of analysis, we used PR8 containing a Gaussia luciferase reporter gene (29) many host cells are resistant to PR8 infection because they do not express proteases that prime viral HA proteins (13) transfection-susceptible target cells were established by transfecting 2935 cells with genes encoding virus receptors. target cells were then inoculated with the pp preparations in the absence or presence of tetraspanin antibodies. the tetraspanin antibodies impaired transduction by all three CoV pp preparations, with MERS pp and SARS pp mostnotably inhibited. the indicated VSV pp bearing the spike proteins from 229E, MERS, or SARS virus were inoculated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. unadsorbed virus and antibody were then removed from cells. transduction levels were measured by quantifying Fluc reporter gene products. mCherry MERS pp were adsorbed at 4\u00b0C to 2935 cells overexpressing hDPP4 receptors. tetraspanin antibodies did slightly reduce the fluorescence intensities of the MERS pp-bound cells. tetraspanin antibodies only modestly interfered with virus binding to cells. flow cytometry was performed to detect bound HIV-based pp. mCherry-MERS-CoV pp were inoculated for 120 min at 4\u00b0C. cells were fixed and analyzed by confocal microscopy. absence of viral glycoprotein-free fluorescent pp binding confirmed viral glycoprotein-dependent interactions with cells. similar, but less compelling copatching of IAV pp and CD81 were also observed in these experiments. TEMs are known to contain a variety of cell surface proteases (22), among which may be one or several coV- and IAV-priming proteases. 106 cells transfected with 0.004 g of TMPRSS2 plasmid contained TMPRSS2 protein levels that were far below our Western blot and immunofluorescence assay detection limits. even small amounts of priming proteases nullify the antiviral effects of tetraspanin antibodies. cells were transfected with graded doses of HAT-encoding plasmids. the results indicated that HAT bypassed the antibody blockades in a dose-dependent manner. TMPRSS2, HAT, and trypsin proteases and to MHV and PR8 viruses also bypassed the antibody blockades. VSV G-mediated transductions showed that CD9 supports MERS at the level of S-protein-mediated virus entry. all of these results demonstrated that CD9 supports MERS at the level of S-protein-mediated virus entry. TEMs contain coronavirus receptors and priming proteases. omission of particular tetraspanins interferes with these encounters, reducing infection. tetraspanin-enriched microdomain fractions were devoid of any cell surface tetraspanins. the surfaces of 2935 cells were biotinylated before lysis with CHAPS or TX-100. each fraction was analyzed for cell surface CD9, CD63, and CD81. ACE2, APN, and CEACAM were fractionated into TEM fractions. about 50% of these proteases were found in the TEM fractions. some of the TMPRSS2 and HAT that was not found in TEM (LD) fractions may come from shedding of the Flag-tagged TMPR ectodomain fragments into soluble (HD material) DPP4 and TMPRSS2 were found near or within CD81-enriched cell surface puncta. similar partitioning of CD81 with catalytically inactive mutant TMPRSS2S441A was also observed. there are proportions of coV receptors and priming proteases residing within TEMs. TEM fractions transduced the leupeptin-treated cells. bypass of leupeptin was pronounced when MERS pp were exposed to trypsin or to TEMs containing overexpressed TMPRSS2. however, substantial bypass of leupeptin was not achieved by CHAPS HD fractions. transduction levels were measured by luciferase reporter gene expression. 2935 cells were infected with PR8 that was treated with trypsin. TEMs were isolated from TMPRSS2-overexpressing cells. 93 cells have proteases that cleave and prime both MERS-CoV S and PR8 IAV HA proteins. we evaluated TEMs for host cell entry factors and determined that they contain both coV receptors and transmembrane serine proteases (TMPRs) the findings suggest that in natural infections, the coVs and LP IAVs encounter TEMs during their cell entry. transmembrane protease activities depend on precise embedment into TEMs. tetraspanin antibodies interfering with this hypothetical positioning. TMPRSS2 stands out as a key coV-priming protease. there is no evidence that cathepsins are localized to TEMs. the requirements for TEM-associated cleavage events may depend on the coV strain and on the particular combinations of virus-priming proteases in target cells. the human CoVs use the transmembrane ectopeptidases ACE2 (38), APN (36), and DPP4 (37) as host cell receptors. TEM environment is preferred location for receptor-induced conformational changes of S proteins, rapid proteolytic cleavage of the intermediate S conformations, and possibly subsequent refolding to postfusion forms. TEMs are operationally distinguished from classical lipid rafts by their insolubility in zwitterionic detergents, such as CHAPS and Brij 98 (56), and by their complete disruption by nonionic detergents. broad-spectrum protease inhibitors can be used to prevent viral infection and spread in vitro (64) and in vivo (65), but these treatments are not approved for human use. to achieve this targeting, inhibitors might be conjugated to TEM-binding motifs."}
