{"summary": "the non-coding portion of the genome plays a more significant role in human biology than previously thought. the rest of the genome plays an important role in controlling the expression of the coding deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) non-coding RNA (ncRNA) is an RNA molecule that is transcribed from DNA but not translated to a protein. the last decade has witnessed a sharp rise of interest in non-coding RNA research. the best characterized lncRNAs come from cancer studies. for example, MALAT-1 was associated with poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer [17,18] and oral squamous cell carcinoma [19]. lncRNA HOTAIR has been shown to promote metastasis in multiple cancers including breast, gastric, colorectal, cervical and liver cancer [20,21,22,23,24]. the current version of lncRNAdb is released in Jan 2015. it provides information of sequence, genomic context, expression profile, structure, subcellular localization, conservation, and function for 287 eukaryotic lncRNAs. lncRNADisease also collected lncRNA interactions in various levels, including protein, RNA, miRNA, and DNA. cn/chipbase/ transcriptional regulatory networks of ncRNAs and protein-coding genes 10 species 27924033 DIANA-LncBase v2 http://www.microrna.gr/LncBase/ miRNA-lncRNA interactions human and mouse 26612864 LNCipedia.org/ functional lncRNAs 68 species 25332394 LncRNADisease http://www.cuilab.cn/ln traditional RNAseq libraries were built based on the presence of a poly(A) tail, which is present in all mRNA except for histone encoded mRNAs. the preferred RNA library preparation method for this is total RNA library construction, which depletes ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and washes out small RNAs by size selection. the total length of coding RNA is 97,662,789 nucleotides compared to 9,699,539 nucleotides for lincRNA. eQTL-linked lncRNA-mRNA pairs were more co-expressed than random lncRNA-mRNA pairs. getorf is a tool implemented by the European Molecular biology Open Software Suite [52] which identifies ORFs by identifying start and stop codons. CPAT used two additional features, the Fickett score and the hexamer score. slncky assesses the coding potential by identifying conserved ORFs in syntenic regions across multiple species. circRNA can be detected in non-tissue samples, such as saliva [58], blood plasma [59] and seminal plasma [60]. circRNAs are much easier to bind with miRNA than with mRNA [61], allowing circRNA to repress miRNA regulation on mRNA. circRNA identification tools include find_circ [71], mapSplice2 [72], Segemehl [73], circExplorer [74], circRNA_finder [75], CIRI [76], ACFS [76], KNIFE [77], NCLscan [78], DCC [79] and UROBORUS [80]. tfToGenePred bedToBigWig (optional) STAR (2.4.0j) mapSplice (2.1.9) BWA (0.6.2-r126) segemehl (0.2.0) reads in fasta 25544350 CIRI Perl Perl alignment in SAM 2558336528334140 ACFS Perl BWA-0.7.3a Perl BLAT (optional) reads in fasta 26076956 NCLscan Python disease-circRNA association Human 24339831 CircNet http://circnet.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/ tissue-specific circRNA expression profiles and circRNA\u2013miRNA-gene regulatory networks Human 26450965 circRNABase http://202.116.90.187/mirCircRNA.php miRNA-circRNA interactions. a common approach is to determine the homologous sequences to protein coding genes using tools such as FASTA or BLAST. however, their utilization has been low, probably partly due to the lack of interest in pseudogenes. miRNA, transfer RNA (tRNA), piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), small nuclear RNA (snRNA), Y RNA (yRNA), single-recognition particle RNA (7SL RNA), and 7SK RNA. most studied smallest RNAs are miRNAs with more than 10,000 published manuscripts on PubMed (Figure 2). miRNAs have exhibited potential as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for human diseases including cancer. overexpression of miR-185 was shown to inhibit autophagy and apoptosis of dopaminergic cells in Parkinson\u2019s disease. mouse, rat, dog and chicken 25378301 miRmap http://mirmap.ezlab.org/ human, mouse, cow, opossum, chicken, chimpanzee, zebrafish and other 23716633 mirPath v.3 http://www.microrna.gr/miRPathv3 human, mouse, rat, worm, fly, chicken and zebrafish 25977294 miRNA_Targets http://mir human, mouse, rat, fly and zebrafish 26267216 Tools4miRs https://tools4mirs.org/ any 27153626 Table 5. miRNA databases.
