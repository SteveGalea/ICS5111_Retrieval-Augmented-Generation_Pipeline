{"summary": "the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (NIAID) has embarked on a series of initiatives aimed at developing a comprehensive understanding of the organisms identified as NIAID category A, B and C priority pathogens. the project seeks to integrate genomics with comparative genomics and pathway analysis and ultimately proteomics. the genus Rickettsia prowazekii contains the organisms responsible for numerous types of typhus and arthropod-borne spotted fevers (9,10). it was developed as a bioweapon by the usSR in the 1930s and was used by the Japanese in manchuria during World War II (11) PATRIC has created an interdisciplinary team of bioinformaticians, software engineers, computational biologists and organism experts to build a publicly accessible resource. to address these problems, PATRIC has created an interdisciplinary team of bioinformaticians, software engineers, computational biologists and organism experts. DATABASE DESCRIPTION PATRIC is implemented on Oracle 9i RDBMS using the Genomics Unified Schema (GUS) version 3.5. the database is populated with all known full-length or nearly full-length genomic sequences for the eight organism categories listed in Table 1. genome curation Due to the large number of closely related genomes in each organism category, we have adopted an annotation strategy. automated methods are applied to all genomes while detailed manual curation is applied to a limited number of reference genomes. each viral category has (or will have) multiple reference genomes representing phylogenetically diverse strains. multiple methods are automatically \u2018finalized\u2019, creating new \u2018gene\u2019, \u2018CDS\u2019 and/or \u2018[t/r]RNA\u2019 features. the remaining genes are marked for manual curation. each protein is associated with GO terms (30), TIGRroles, Enzyme Commission numbers (31) based on Pfam (32) and TIGRfam alignments. each protein in the database will either be manually curated or be linked to an ortholog group member that has been manually curated. the ortholog groups are further processed to create multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) using MUSCLE (34) with default parameters. phylogenetic estimations using the neighbor-joining method were created based on trimmed alignments using PHYLIP (35) the website's home page contains news, a navigation bar and the list of PATRIC organisms. users can select their organism of interest from the list to access the corresponding organism category page. database search page allows user-supplied sequences to be BLASTed against reference and curated sequences from PATRIC organisms. database search page also supports MUMMER (41) comparisons between genomes in the database or with a user-supplied sequence. RNA genes are identified by tRNAscan-SE (26) and BLASTN searching against a ribosomal RNA database (27,28). results of the genome analysis pipeline are merged with original GenBank or RefSeq features for automated interpretation. genes that are unambiguously predicted by multiple methods are automatically \u2018finalized\u2019. a reference protein list is created for each bacterial category. a gene occurring in only a single genome constitutes a \u2018group\u2019 of one. the ortholog groups will be manually curated or linked to an ortholog group member that has been manually curated. the PATRIC website is hosted on a Sun Microsystems server running SuSE Linux using the Apache web server. applications are written in PHP and Perl, accessing data from an Oracle 9i server running Sun OS. the organism category page contains links to a pathogen summary, ortholog group table and a phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNAs for bacteria or a selected protein family for viruses. the ortholog group table shows the presence or absence of reference gene list proteins for each organism in the organism category. FUTURE DIRECTIONS This paper presents the first detailed description of the PATRIC website. the website's user interface is being enhanced to integrate organism-, tool/task- and data-centric approaches to data access."}
