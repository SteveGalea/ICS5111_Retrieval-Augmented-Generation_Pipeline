{"summary": "the world health organization estimates that respiratory tract infections are the leading cause of death in low-income countries. even in the u.s., respiratory tract infections cause more disease and death than any other type of infection. over the past 50 years there has been little decrease in mortality associated with lung infections. V-NL63 strain (NL63/AMS/2004/1) was identified in 2004, and NL63 viruses have been shown to have a worldwide distribution. NL63 viruses are associated with asymptomatic infections and mild upper respiratory tract infections, as well as pneumonia, bronchiolitis and croup. 92 of 9380 respiratory specimens were found to be positive for NL63 viral RNA by multiplex PCR. the most common co-infections were human rhinoviruses (13 %), respiratory syncytial virus (8 %), adenoviruses (5 %) and hCoV-229. of the children positive for NL63 viruses, 42 % were under 12 months of age and 56 % were under 2 years of age. most common diagnosis were viral syndrome or upper respiratory tract infection (n = 27), fever and neutropenia (n = 9), croup (n = 9), bronchiolitis (n = 8), rule out sepsis/fever in the neonate (n = 6) and pneumonia (n = 5).

NL63/DEN/2009/6 and NL63/DEN/2009/31 remained in two contigs. the CSs of the membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) genes were found in duplicate. the terminal C of the first sequence served as the starting C of the second sequence (5\u2032-CUAAACUAAAC-3\u2032). phylogenetic tree comparing genome sequences of the 16 Colorado NL63 strains combined with the four full-length NL63 genomes found in the Netherlands is shown in Fig. 2. the peak near the beginning of the S gene of NL63/DEN/2009/6 represent areas of poor sequence coverage due to the presence of two contigs for these sequences. this provides another way of visualizing recombination along the length of the genomes. it shows a pairwise comparison of the shapes of the phylogenetic trees constructed separately for each coding sequence. gene tree topologies were compared in a pairwise fashion using the Robinson\u2013Foulds topological distance DRF(a,b) calculation. the distance matrix DRF was visualized and converted into a colour representation using the r statistical package. dark blue indicates identical phylogenetic trees. from nt 920 to 1710, genotypes B and C had relatively divergent sequences. this segregation of nucleotide sequences was maintained at the amino acid level in nsp3 but only in the first part of the S gene. phylogenetic trees were produced for overlapping window segments of 200 bp. the mean bootstrap value across all members of the query group segment versus the remaining three groups was plotted against window position. comparisons are shown by colour, as represented in Fig. 2. nsp14 22 0.001 0.016 0.063 nsp15 22 0.001 0.013 0.077 nsp16 24 0.001 0.028 0.036 S 19 0.041 0.151 0.272 ORF3 22 0.001 0.021 0.048 E 24 0.000 0.019 0.000 M 23 0.001 0.012 0.083 N 24 0.002 0.016 0.125 Comparative sequence analysis of the S gene among NL63 viruses. 92 of 9380 respiratory specimens were found to be positive for NL63 virus. from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011, 92 of 9380 respiratory specimens were found to be positive for NL63 viral RNA by multiplex PCR. the most common co-infections were human rhinoviruses (13 %), respiratory syncytial virus (8 %), adenoviruses (5 %) and hCoV-229E (5 %) y-one per cent of the NL63-positive patients were admitted to the hospital and 51 % had an underlying medical condition. the most common diagnosis were viral syndrome or upper respiratory tract infection (n = 27), fever and neutropenia (n = 9), croup (n = 9), bronchiolitis (n = 8), rule out sepsis/fever in the neonate (n = 6) and pneumonia (n = 5).

NL63/DEN/2009/6 and NL63/DEN/2009/31 remained in two contigs. a phylogenetic tree comparing the genome sequences of the 16 Colorado NL63 strains combined with the four full-length NL63 genomes found in the Netherlands is shown in Fig. 2. these 20 NL63 strains fell into three genotypes, designated genotypes A (seven strains), B (six strains) and C (four strains) phylogenetic analysis of all known full genomes of NL63 viruses isolated in different years from Denver (DEN), Amsterdam (AMS) and Rotterdam (ROT) the viral sequences fell into three clusters (genotypes A, B and C) the viruses shown in purple (R) probably represent recombinants. the distance matrix DRF was converted into a colour representation using the r statistical package. the scale on the right indicates the relative degree of phylogenetic dissimilarity, increasing from blue to yellow. from nt 920 to 1710, genotypes B and C had relatively similar sequences. this segregation of nucleotide sequences was maintained at the amino acid level in nsp3 but only in the first part of the S gene. the highest Ka : Ks ratio in the NL63 genomes was observed in the S gene (0.272), followed by the nsp3 (0.250) and nsp2 (0.94) genes. the highest Ka : Ks ratio in the NL63 genomes was observed in the S gene (0.272). the greatest variability in the S gene was found in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S gene (nt 1\u2013600, aa 1\u2013200) we found ten different amino acid sequences in the NTD of our NL63 sequences and the 75 NL63 NTD S sequences in GenBank (Fig. S1). among these ten different NTD sequences, there were 29 amino acid differences (15 %) within the NTD, there were eight potential N-linked glycosylation sites the first study to describe 16 complete NL63 genome sequences from clinical respiratory specimens in north America. at least three distinct genotypes of NL63 viruses (A, B and C) circulating in Colorado, USA. 4 % of all samples positive for NL63 viruses during the months of January\u2013March. serological studies have shown yearly variations in the prevalence of hCoV-299E and hCoV-OC43 infection (Monto & Lim, 1974). persistent infection of immunocompromised patients may provide reservoir for adaptation and/or further spread of NL63. the TRS contains a CS within a hairpin structure essential for efficient production of subgenomic mRNAs. the CSs are conserved among all unique sequences of NL63 genomes. study of NL63 genomes in the Netherlands provided the first evidence of recombination for NL63. the most variable region in the NL63 genome is the S gene, particularly the NTD (nt 1\u2013600) the presence of multiple potential glycosylation sites in the NL63 NTD supports this possibility. the NL63 NTD may also play a role in virus infection in several ways: it may aid in virus attachment by recognizing cell-surface sugars, it may facilitate binding of the C-domain to the protein receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). the clinical virology laboratory of the children\u2019s hospital Colorado began using a multiplex PCR [xTag Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP); Luminex Molecular Diagnostics] in combination with direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) assays. clinicians had the option of testing specimens by DFA or RVP only, followed by RVP if the DFA testing was negative. subsets of NL63-positive clinical specimens collected from 2009 to 2011 were selected for genome sequencing as follows. first, specimens identified initially as positive for NL63 RNA by RVP were confirmed using a modified quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. PCR products were treated with a mixture of exonuclease and shrimp alkaline phosphatase to remove primers and dNTPs. PCR products were then subjected to Sanger sequencing using the common M13 primers at the 5\u2032 end of each primer. initial assemblies were inspected using an in-house application, Cloe. the hits with the highest scoring edges were used to cover the polyprotein. a final step resolved gaps and overlaps by using known cleavage motifs in the polyprotein. sequences of each viral gene were multiply aligned with muscle version 3.7 (Edgar, 2004), using the sum-of-pairs profile score (VTML240) option over the course of five iterations. a distance-based neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Kimura two-parameter distance (Kimura, 1980), with gamma-distributed rates across sites ( = 0.04) the missing genes were temporarily pruned from the tree topology b to achieve the same coding sequence in both topologies. the distance matrix DRF was visualized as a heat map using the r statistical package. the clinical specimens positive for NL63 viruses were named according to the nomenclature: virus/location/year of collection/specimen number. all clinical respiratory specimens positive for any hCoV were archived at 70 \u00b0C for further analysis. subsets of NL63-positive clinical specimens collected from 2009 to 2011 were selected for genome sequencing as follows. PCR primer design pipeline developed at the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) this produced tiled amplicons with an optimal length of 550 bp, with a 100 bp overlap and at least twofold amplicon coverage at every base. RNA extracted from the clinical samples was subjected to RT-PCR using a Qiagen One-step kit. annotated polyproteins and ORFs were searched by blast against a reference set of known CoV mature peptides. the edges of each blast hit were scored by proximity to other blast hits and the quality of the hits. the resulting reads were assembled de novo using the clc_novo_assemble program (CLC Bio) the assembled amplicons were annotated using vigor as described above. the viral genome sequences were multiply aligned with muscle version 3.7. the resulting gene tree topologies were compared using the Robinson\u2013Foulds topological distance, DRF(a,b), with phylip dnadist. the missing genes were temporarily pruned from the tree topology b to achieve the same coding sequence in both topologies. clinical specimens positive for NL63 viruses were named according to the nomenclature: virus/location/year of collection/specimen number. RVP is not cleared for routine reporting of hCoV results. the ability of this test to identify hCoVs has been reported. all clinical respiratory specimens positive for any hCoV were archived at 70 \u00b0C. a 96-well plate of degenerate NL63-specific primers was designed from a consensus sequence of the four NL63 reference genomes from GenBank (accession nos DQ445912, DQ445911, NC_005831 and AY567487) RNA extracted from the clinical samples was subjected to RT-PCR using a Qiagen One-step kit. vigor was developed at JCVI to decode sequences from viruses. vigor was used to validate the newly assembled NL63 genomes. the gene predictions were subjected to manual inspection and quality control. the viral genome sequences were multiply aligned with muscle version 3.7 (Edgar, 2004), using the sum-of-pairs profile score (VTML240) option over the course of five iterations. bootscan analysis of the genome alignments was performed using seqboot and consense. maximum-parsimony trees for each coding sequence were constructed with the phylip utility dnapars. the resulting gene tree topologies were compared in a pairwise fashion using the Robinson\u2013Foulds topological distance, DRF(a,b) with phylip dnadist."}
