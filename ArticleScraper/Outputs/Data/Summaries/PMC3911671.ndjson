{"summary": "viruses with RNA genomes evolve rapidly, evading selective pressure from the host immune response and adapting to changing environments. many such outbreaks in recent history have been attributed to viral species jumps. human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is believed to have switched hosts from primates. the recent availability of rapid and inexpensive deep-sequencing techniques has the potential to significantly improve our understanding of how key factors affect virus evolutionary dynamics. a major obstacle in leveraging the growing sequence data is the lack of quantitative connections between such genotype data and experimentally measurable viral phenotypes. the model was successfully used to describe HIV-1 within-host dynamics in both short (immune escape dynamics) and long (disease progression) time scales. the approach allows one to quantitatively probe the effects of key factors of evolutionary dynamics on adaptation, including the fitness distribution in sequence space. Ferguson et al. have recently used a similar approach in their study of HIV fitness landscapes. we used a reduced description of a two-letter alphabet and Monte Carlo simulations for inference (34) rather than the mean field approximation developed by Morcos et al. cell of genotype n sheds a virion with genotype m with replication rate rn and mutation probability (29, 30), Q m n = ( 1) L d m n is the total length of the genomic nucleotide segment. dmn is the Hamming distance (total number of nucleotides that differ) between genotypes m and n. corresponding amino acid sequences encountered as the viral population became more diverse (28) instead of enumerating all possible sequences, which become exponentially numerous even for small La. we also considered an extended model for adaptation in animal hosts with immune response for which equation 3 is replaced by I n s I n + T n. the fitness function r was modeled as a Gaussian random variable with mean r = r0 exp(d/) and standard deviation. we used = 1 amino acid (aa) and = 0.1 unless otherwise specified. the choice of reference sequence (d = 0) distinguishes the two scenarios without and with adaptations. the inverse of this time was defined as the \u201cjumping rate\u201d (J), a stochastic quantity with a wide distribution including J = 0, which corresponds to cases where the trajectory never reached the MF sequence. the maximum simulation time was set so that it was much longer than the typical jumping times for trajectories that did reach MF. a prior distribution p0() with a count n0 was used in frequency calculations. for the prior distribution p0(), we used the frequency values from the Jones-Taylor-Thornton matrix (36), augmented by p0 = 0.01 for the gap. the prior count n0 values used were 3,000 and 4,000 for H5 and H3, respectively. astic model. Simulation of influenza virus adaptation. each simulation was started with the WT genotype CATACACAAGGA (HTQG) of H5N1 with a different random number seed. each mutant generated in the simulations was dynamically assigned the fitness. d m n (5) where is the mutation rate (probability for substitution per nucleotide site per replication), L is the total length of the genomic nucleotide segment, and dmn is the Hamming distance (total number of nucleotides that differ) between genotypes m and n. equation 5 gives the joint probability of mutating dmn sites with probability /3. I n + T n c T n ( s t i m u l a t i o n ) (7) T n b 0 ( c l e a r a n c e ) (8) where Tn denotes a cytotoxic T lymphocyte specific to genotype n, stimulated with rate s by the presence of infected cells and capable of killing them with rate c we used = 1 amino acid (aa) and = 0.1 unless otherwise specified. the choice of reference sequence (d = 0) distinguishes the two scenarios without and with adaptations. in the latter, the reference sequence coincides with the founder WT sequence. the inverse of this time was defined as the \u201cjumping rate\u201d (J), a stochastic quantity with a wide distribution including J = 0, which corresponds to cases where the trajectory never reached the MF sequence. realizations that became stuck with a nonzero distance to MF exhibited stationary MF frequencies of 50% beyond the time maximum. the prior distribution n0 values used were 3,000 and 4,000 for H5 and H3, respectively. the set of empirical distributions, fi() and fij(,) were then matched to the maximum-entropy expression of the probability of a sequence q = (1,..., La), p(q) exp(rq/rs), where r q = i h i (i ) + i j C i j (i, j) (9) the reference fitness value was set as rs = 1 day1. the setup mimics the adaptation of H5 under selective environments native to H3 strains. adaptation because it assigned nonzero frequencies to all genotypes via equation 5 at all times t of >0. only for a simplified model with L = 3 nt and an artificially high mutation rate of 0.1 was the difference between the two methods relatively small. stochastic simulations of the full discrete model predicted long waiting times for the discovery of MF genotype. value of a affected the shape of the initial rise in virus count. larger values led to a flatter curve up to 2 days (initial virions rapidly consumed by infection) followed by a sharper increase (infected cells start producing copied virions) s increased with the viral titer growth, reaching a peak together with the virus count. the cell death/clearance phase led to a restoration of the monoclonal population. the maximum number of genotypes shown in Fig. 1B, 25 nt sequences (and 17 aa sequences) are close to the number of possible single mutants plus the WT, 1 + 3L = 28 nt sequences. we first examined the simpler case in which the viral population was already well adapted to the target cell environment. no systematic evolutionary drift in sequence space was expected. this situation was modeled by using a fitness function centered around the WT. each passage round was statistically independent of the previous round. if the initial population is already well adapted to the host environment, the selection events did not affect the quasispecies structure appreciably. evolutionary dynamics then exhibit an adaptation process where systematic drifts toward more fit genotypes occur within a characteristic timescale. in our modeling, the adaptation process was defined as the exploration of sequences near the initial WT during passages. the adaptation at the early stage primarily arose from mutants other than the MF. the approach to the MF and the increase in MF frequency occurred in graduated \u201csteps\u201d with most changes concentrated in the early phase of each passage round. the rightmost cluster of peaks in Fig. 4A corresponds to cases in which the MF frequency exceeded 50% during the first passage cycle, the cluster to its left the second cycle, and so on. the gap between these clusters appeared because large-scale changes to frequency distribution occur mostly during the early growth stage within each round. the jumping rate correlates with the general likelihood of observing a given adaptation during passages. jumping rate is a measure of the relative probability of observing a certain adaptation from a WT to a MF genotype during passages. the large variance in jumping rate showed little sample-size dependence and reflected the contribution of pathways inaccessible to the MF genotype in sequence space. for a given distance d between the WT and MF, the jumping rate monotonically increased with increasing. jumping rate values became statistically similar for different distances near of 103. we may infer estimates for the typical number of passages required under a typical mutation rate of 105 to arrive at and jump to an MF sequence. the host cell number U0 determines the viral population size reached within each passage round. we found the jumping rate J to be insensitive to variations in infection rate a (Fig. 6D) the dependence on death/clearance rate b was similar (Fig. 6E), except when b increased beyond 1 day1. the action of innate and adaptive host responses may affect the dynamics of adaptation. for serial passages in animal hosts, the action of innate and adaptive host responses may affect the dynamics of adaptation. a similar implementation is possible with the inclusion of antibodies interacting with viruses rather than infected cells. two additional mutations were found among strains exhibiting the capability of spreading via airborne routes. we used an HA protein MSA of H5N1 sequences to infer fitness landscape of the model segment. most of the high-fitness mutants involve a single substitution at position 156. we modeled the adaptation of the first two HA positions by taking the sequence HTQG as the WT and SAQG as the MF sequence. in these serial-passage simulations, the WT nucleotide sequence at time zero was fixed (CATACACAAGGA) the fitness values of the appearing mutants were obtained from the computationally inferred landscape parameters. the time-dependent progression of the most frequent genotypes (master sequences; HTQG HAQG RAQG LAQG SAQG) covers the fitness landscape (Fig. 8B) with a sequential increase in rank (251 18 14 5 1) and fitness (4.9 12.3 12.7 13.4 21.7), while reflecting the accessibility of the required mutations. if it occurs, the genotype eventually dominates the population (Fig. 9). the parameters were as follows: V0 = 1 104, U0 = 1 106, a = 1.0 103 day1, b = 1.0 day1, = 1 105, and = 3 days. nodes represent the genotypes (first two amino acids) and edges connect pairs for which there exists at least one single-nucleotide mutation separating the two nodes. the continuum approximation to equations 1 to 4 becomes equivalent to the target cell-limited model used by Baccam et al. (20) and Pawelek et al. (37) to study the kinetics of influenza A virus infection. we compared the full discrete stochastic simulation with the outcomes of the continuum differential equation representation and found that the latter severely overestimated the speed of adaptation. the experimentally measured viral titers. the initial clonal founder virus group (V0 virions) underwent a short period of clearance before the target cells became infected appreciably. the growth stopped when the target cells became depleted and was followed by gradual cell death and virus clearance processes. a discrete stochastic model provided previously unavailable and realistic views of the genomic diversification process accompanying this growth. the results were obtained by averaging over many explicit representations of La = 3 aa (L = 9 nt) genomic segments with random sequences. the number of distinct nucleotide and amino acid sequences increased with the viral titer growth, reaching a peak together with the virus count. the quasispecies population was sampled with equal probability for all virions present to produce a founder group of virions to infect fresh new target cells. the \u201cbottleneck factor\u201d f 1, defined as the ratio of the initial viral population size of a round to the final viral population size of the previous round (and controlled by varying the founder group size V0) mutant frequency decreased again after 1.5 days. we examined the trend in the total number of genotypes present after the end of each passage round. if the initial population is already well adapted to the host environment, the selection events did not affect the quasispecies structure appreciably. d = 2 aa and other parameters were chosen to best illustrate the typical behavior in simulations under these settings. mutants with higher fitness values appeared and displaced the WT. the adaptation at the early stage primarily arose from mutants other than the MF. the distribution is multimodal, with broad peaks at larger, finite rates and a nonzero probability of zero rate. the latter, more pronounced for d = 2 aa, can be attributed to the topological structure of the genetic code. a population can become dominated by a genotype close to the MF in distance but not directly accessible. the model allowed for quantitative characterizations of the speed of adaptation in terms of the time required for a highly fit genotype to appear and dominate the quasispecies population under passages. the cluster of peaks in panel A centered at a J of 0.3 day1, 0.16 day1, 0.11 day1, and 0.07 day1 correspond to jumping events (MF frequency exceeding 50%) during the first, second, third, and fourth passage rounds. for an L of 6 nt, the site heterogeneity did not affect the jumping rate appreciably. its effect, however, may become stronger for longer genomic segments. deep-sequencing data of viral genomes (42) could be used to assign site and nucleotide-dependent substitution rates. neck size V0 for a given U0 represents the strength of the selection pressure, determining the bottleneck factor f. the increase of J with increasing V0 for small V0 is a gradual attenuation of the finite-size effect. for small V0, more fit mutants often were lost because of their low frequencies. the dependence on death/clearance rate b was similar (Fig. 6E) except when b increased beyond 1 day1, where cell death and clearance began to annihilate the growth phase. we varied the characteristic width parameter of the fitness peak (Fig. 6F), where increasing corresponded to the fitness peak at the MF sequence becoming broader. inferred fitness parameters allow one to score fitness values of arbitrary genotypes that might be encountered during evolutionary adaptation. we used an HA protein MSA of H5N1 sequences to form the model protein segment of La = 4 aa. we used an MSA of HA in mammalian hosts. we modeled the adaptation of the first two positions by taking the sequence HTQG as the WT and SAQG as the MF sequence. we also simulated the adaptation of the WT under the H3 fitness landscape. the majority of the trajectories did not reach the MF sequence within 103 days (300 cycles), getting trapped in some of the genotypes listed in Fig. 8B. the simulation starts with a monoclonal WT (HTQG) population at time zero. the T156A mutation already appears at 3 days, reflecting the large jump in fitness. the basic stochastic model of adaptation can be combined with sequence-based empirical data to yield detailed and experimentally relevant predictions of virus adaptation dynamics. panels A to I show the sequential snapshots at each time instance (immediately after a passage cycle), listing five genotypes with the highest frequencies. viral evolutionary dynamics during serial passages allows for quantitative characterizations of the probability of observing systematic drifts in population structure and adaptations to a new host environment. the ability to model passages quantitatively would provide insights into analogous events occurring in natural settings, including species jumps and outbreaks (5). if we perform passages in host environments to which the viruses have already been well adapted, no significant new drift in population structure occurs. the speed of this adaptation process is characterized by the time (or the number of passage rounds) required for the population to discover the MF sequence and then become dominated by it. the species jump from bats to humans via palm civets as host species. they engineered a strain in which the S protein receptor-binding domain was replaced by its counterpart in the civet strain (the WT) serial passages up to 22 days produced strains with significantly enhanced growth and replication in human cells. the large number of sequences currently available for influenza allowed us to determine fitness landscapes using a computational fitness inference procedure. the four amino acid sites within HA chosen for investigation are those previously shown to exhibit adaptive mutations enabling respiratory-route infection in experiments. the last event occurred only in 10% of the simulation runs within 300 days. if it did occur, the MF invariably became dominant. the experimental MF genotypes for positions 103 and 156 are Tyr and Ala. we may infer insights into a better understanding of evolutionary dynamics of viral pathogens in natural settings from the study of serial passages. the longitudinal patterns of population size and quasispecies structure shown in Fig. 3 can be regarded as idealizations of what typically happens in natural infectious cycles. correlated evolution of multiple amino acid sites. reassortment events play important roles in influenza virus adaptation."}
