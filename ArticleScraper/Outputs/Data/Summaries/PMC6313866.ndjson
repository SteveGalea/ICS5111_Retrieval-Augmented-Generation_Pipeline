{"summary": "one health concept has attracted interest across veterinary, medical, conservation, and socioeconomic domains. it has been estimated that 61% of all known human pathogens are zoonotic [9], and that 60\u201375% of emerging pathogens are zoonotic [9,10] a pathogen\u2019s ability to infect multiple species has also been associated with an increased risk of emergence in humans and livestock. a broad targeted surveillance to include nonhuman populations may be most effective and useful for monitoring infectious-disease trends. a sentinel may be defined as an indicator of the presence of disease. despite promising research into the use of animal sentinels, it has been argued that they remain underutilized. this has been attributed to a need for greater data sharing, integration and cooperation between the human and animal medical professions. examples of animal sentinel-surveillance programs include the monitoring of wild birds for the west Nile virus and avian influenza. dogs may act as sentinels in certain situations, but also as sources of infection. most research into dog sentinel-surveillance has been related to environmental health risks. a lack of case-control and cohort studies, appropriate sample sizes, and relevance to human health in terms of shared exposures. the one health concept has attracted interest across veterinary, medical, conservation, and socioeconomic domains. concerns have been raised over the lack of governance in global health issues and the difficulties of breaking down the siloed approach to health. a sentinel may be defined as an indicator of the presence of disease. animal sentinels may be used to detect pathogens or disease outbreaks in a new area. animals may also serve as sentinels for food-related hazards. a conceptual framework to evaluate animal populations as sentinels for infectious-disease surveillance has been described [16], and the Yale Canary Database compiles peer-reviewed research related to animal sentinel surveillance of human health hazards [19]. in many countries they are ubiquitous, with free-roaming and scavenging lifestyles, thus exposing them to multiple pathogens and making them an ideal \u201csampling tool\u201d [20]. research into dog sentinel-surveillance has been related to environmental health risks. lack of case-control and cohort studies, appropriate sample sizes, and relevance to human health in terms of shared exposures, outcomes, and susceptibilities between sentinel animals and humans. scan for additional publications not found in the other databases using the same search terms. the limits applied to the search were that they be available in English. grey literature, such as government documents, reports, and working papers, was excluded. the most common method was serosurvey of dogs, in which dogs were used to estimate seroprevalences, employed in 108 (76.1%) of the studies. a wide variety of canine populations were used in the identified publications. five out of 142 (4%) from lower-middle-income economies. bias against low-income countries supports lack of adequate systematic infrastructures and funding for surveillance and disease control in low-income countries. seroprevalence was evaluated in healthy dogs, cats, and horses in new york city after the 1999 WNV outbreak in humans. a cross-sectional analysis during an epidemic in Slidell, Louisiana, United States screened 442 dogs for seropositivity to WNV. stray dogs had almost 19 times as great odds for seropositivity compared to indoor-only family dogs. a 2017 study conducted in southern Quebec, Canada was performed to assess public-health risk by estimating regional prevalence to WNV and other arboviruses in humans, horses, and dogs. bacteria Of all the pathogens, eighteen (34%) were bacterial. of these, one was flea-borne (Yersinia pestis), four were tick-borne (Coxiella), one was rarely tick-borne (Coxiella), three were transmitted by various arthropods north Carolina concluded that R. rhiphicephali was prevalent in the eastern coastal region, R. montana throughout the state, and R. rickettsii in the central Piedmont region but less so in the western mountains. in 2001, a higher seroprevalence to R. akari in older New York dogs suggested that conditions in New York might have been favorable to the maintenance of R. akari ten or more years ago. a serosurvey of dogs and cats in Caratinga was performed ten years after a previous serosurvey had been conducted to evaluate the success of vector control measures. a risk assessment utilizing serosurveys of dogs led to the construction of risk-probability maps using seropositivity rates and known environmental aspects of the municipalities. spora, Giardia, Isospora, Sarcocystis, and Toxoplasma gondii published 17 papers between 2004 and 2017. toxoplasma gondii was the most described protozoal pathogen, with 17 papers published between 2004 and 2017. both papers from Canada were studying Indigenous communities. ten (19%) were helminths of all the pathogens. one was mosquito-borne (Dirofilaria immitis), and nine were not vector-borne. all results were seroprevalence studies in dogs alone. no positive samples were found from regions in Australia and Brazil. seroprevalences of 11.2% and 34% were found across Albania and the Galapagos. of the 142 results, 49 (35%) collected data from Latin America and the Caribbean, 36 (25%) from North America, 24 (17%) from Europe and Central Asia, 16 (11%) from East Asia and the Pacific, eight (6%) from the Middle East and North Africa, and eight (6%) from Sub-Saharan Africa. this bias against low-income countries supports concern for lack of adequate systematic infrastructures and funding for surveillance and disease control in low-income countries. thirteen (25%) were viral. of these, eight were mosquito-borne (CSGV), Chikungunya virus, equine encephalitis virus (EEV), japan encephalitis virus (JEV), toscana virus, usutu virus, sandfly-borne (TBEV) and two were not vector-borne (Ebola and rabies) outdoor-only family dogs had almost 19 times as great odds for seropositivity compared to indoor-only family dogs. family dogs that did not receive medication for heartworm were 2.5 times more likely to have a positive result compared to those who did. seroprevalence to WNV has been compared between military dogs and horses across ten sites in Morocco. a serosurvey in dogs from north Carolina concluded that R. rhiphicephali was prevalent in the eastern coastal region, R. montana throughout the state, and R. rickettsii in the central Piedmont region. in 2001, a higher seroprevalence to R. akari in older dogs suggested that conditions in new york might have been favorable to the maintenance of R. akari ten or more years ago [37]. studies in so Paulo, brazil have suggested the use of dogs as sentinels by demonstrating higher seroprevalence of dogs in endemic regions as compared to nonendemic regions [40] results from an endemic region of Rio de Janeiro State showed a 2.8-fold higher probability of dogs exposed to forested areas producing rickettsial-group spotted-fever antibodies [43] protozoa Of all the pathogens, ten (19%) were protozoal. one was sandfly-borne (Leishmania), one was tick-borne (Babesia) and one was transmitted by the triatomine bug (Trypanosoma brucei) toxoplasma gondii was the most described protozoal pathogen. human and canine seroprevalence rates in londrina, brazil were compared. results showed that seroprevalence of dogs was directly linked to increased numbers of dogs and dirty backyards. other studies have concluded that dogs may be used as environmental sentinels. ten (19%) were helminths of all the pathogens. one was mosquito-borne (Dirofilaria immitis), and nine were not vector-borne. the remaining pathogens were included in three or fewer studies. ia serogroup viruses (CSGV), Chikungunya virus, equine encephalitis virus (EEV), japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), toscana virus, usutu virus, west Nile virus (WNV) two were sandfly-borne (Punique virus and sandfly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV) and one was tick-borne (TBEV) seroprevalence to WNV has been compared between military dogs and horses across ten sites in Morocco. findings suggest that dogs offer an alternative sentinel species to horses, particularly in areas where equine vaccination is used. a serosurvey in dogs from north Carolina concluded that R. rhiphicephali was prevalent in the eastern coastal region, R. montana throughout the state, and R. rickettsii in the central Piedmont region. a case report of presumed fatal Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) in two dogs and their owner in Mississippi described how two dogs from the same household died from a suspected tick-borne disease eight days apart. studies in so Paulo, brazil have suggested the use of dogs as sentinels by demonstrating higher seroprevalence of dogs in endemic regions as compared to nonendemic regions [40] results from an endemic region of Rio de Janeiro State showed a 2.8-fold higher probability of dogs exposed to forested areas producing rickettsial-group spotted-fever antibodies [43] protozoa Of all the pathogens, ten (19%) were protozoal. one was sandfly-borne (Leishmania), one was tick-borne (Babesia) and one was transmitted by the triatomine bug (Trypanosoma cruzi) six were not vector-borne (Cryptosporidia, Cystoisospora, Giardia, Isospora, Sarcocystis, and Toxo results from a study in Ubatuba, so Paulo State used dogs as sentinels to demonstrate that toxoplasmosis was linked to sanitary problems (largely cooking of food), rather than the presence of rodents or untreated water. results showed that areas with a high rate of coccidioidomycosis in dogs in Texas overlapped with those identified as potential risk areas based on human surveys. ten (19%) were helminths. one was mosquito-borne (Dirofilaria immitis), and nine were not vector-borne. the remaining pathogens included in three or fewer studies. remote First Nations communities represent a distinct population of Canada. veterinary services are often absent or restricted, and preventative healthcare very limited. dogs in remote communities are often free-roaming, with access to garbage, human food, and carcasses of fish and wildlife. they may also act as a source of infection (e.g., ingestion of Toxocara spp. eggs from fecal contamination), recipient of human infection (e.g., Giardia spp. from human sewage) or amplifiers (e.g., Diphyllobothrium spp. cestodes from raw zoonotic viral pathogens considered to be of high risk of emergence in Canada include the Powassan virus, WNV, EEV, WEE, CSGV, and the Cache Valley virus. CSGV may be under-recognized in Canada, and noted that arboviral encephalitis usually indicates the 'tip of the iceberg' an estimated fatality rate of 35\u201375% makes it the deadliest mosquito-borne pathogen in North America. the lack of confirmed human and equine cases may be due to the lack of diagnostic testing for the pathogen. the presence of seropositive dogs does not necessarily suggest an increased risk for human infection, and dogs might even provide zooprophylaxis by diverting the bites of potentially infectious mosquitoes away from people. it has been concluded that the presence of seropositive dogs does not necessarily suggest an increased risk for human infection. the risk period for WNV infection in humans begins in mid-April and ends at the first hard frost in September/October. the risk period for WNV infection in humans begins in mid-April and ends at the first hard frost in September/October, with the highest risk between mid-july and September. dogs are more likely to have antibodies to SFG rickettsia than relinquished dogs. granulocytic anaplasmosis may be of growing concern due to the establishment and expansion of Ixodes scapularis. this pathogen has been isolated in three dogs from Saskatchewan with no history of travel. climate change will speed the expansion of Lyme borreliosis, increase the intensity of transmission, and potentially alter the speed of bird migration. chemoprophylaxis, commonly used by dog owners, reduces serosurvey sensitivity. human cases reported widely across regions of the united states. veys in Canada (southeastern Saskatchewan and coastal British Columbia) in surveys for Ehrlichia, both did not find a positive result. results from the present review include symptomatic dogs from a veterinary referral hospital in Brazil [61], urban domestic dogs in Brazil [97], owned domestic dogs in the capverde archipelago [98], and asymptomatic dogs presented to veterinary clinics in the united states [99]. utilizing owned domestic dogs, and testing convenient samples from laboratories or referral hospitals human babesiosis is largely caused by B. duncani and B. microti. there is a risk of infection via blood transfusions, and such infection has been detected in U.S. blood donors close to Canadian borders. veterinary literature has informed current medical knowledge of human cases. despite a lack of reports of Canadian-acquired human infection, the known prevalence in dogs in southern Ontario and Quebec alongside the presence of human cases in the bordering states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and New York State could imply increased risk for human infection. asymptomatic dogs may serve as sources and sentinels for parasites in people and wildlife, and as parasite bridges between wildlife and humans. multiple; protozoa, helminths Alberta and Saskatchewan Dogs owned by First Nations communities Emphasize the use of dogs as sentinels for emerging pathogens. communities are often free-roaming, with access to garbage, human food, and carcasses of fish and wildlife. they may also act as a source of infection (e.g., ingestion of Toxocara spp. eggs from fecal contamination), recipient of human infection (e.g., Giardia spp. from human sewage) or amplifiers (e.g., Diphyllobothrium spp. cestodes from raw or undercooked clinical signs are similar to those of WNV and contribute to a significant burden of disease in Canada. it has been suggested that CSGV may be under-recognized in Canada, and noted that arboviral encephalitis usually indicates the 'tip of the iceberg' the first human case of ya virus was reported in the summer of 2016. an estimated fatality rate of 35\u201375% makes it the deadliest mosquito-borne pathogen in north America. the lack of confirmed human and equine cases may be due to the lack of diagnostic testing for the pathogen. dogs may provide zooprophylaxis by diverting bites of potentially infectious mosquitoes away from people. it has been concluded that the presence of seropositive dogs does not necessarily suggest an increased risk for human infection. public-health departments could test a sample of captured stray dogs at animal control facilities weekly. the risk period for WNV infection in humans begins in mid-April and ends at the first hard frost in September/October, with the highest risk between mid-july and September. l surveillance would be useful addition to this strategy, not only to detect new areas of geographic expansion, but also to predict peaks in human-infection cases. human cases confirmed in 2016 and 20 types of mosquito able to transmit the viruses have been found across Canada. clinical signs are similar to those of WNV and contribute to a significant burden of disease in Canada. it has been suggested that CSGV may be under-recognized in Canada. an estimated fatality rate of 35\u201375% makes it the deadliest mosquito-borne pathogen in north America. lack of confirmed human and equine cases may be due to lack of diagnostic testing for the pathogen. 0% of juvenile and 0% of adult dogs were seropositive to EEV, but they note that selecting dogs that have increased outdoor exposure might improve sensitivity of a surveillance system. the data from the former reference have previously been compared to a human serosurvey carried out in queens, new york. 3% of humans surveyed were seropositive, while 11% of dogs were seropositive. it has been suggested that public-health departments could test a sample of captured stray dogs at animal control facilities weekly. for WNV infection in humans begins in mid-April and ends at the first hard frost in September/October, with the highest risk between mid-july and September [82]. Currently, many dogs across Canada are tested annually for four vector-borne parasites between March and June. this presents an ideal opportunity to add on testing for WNV in suitable dogs within or near endemic regions. two out of 13 publications identified in this review were from canada. neither found evidence of Anaplasma [21,57]. human granulocytic anaplasmosis may be of growing concern due to the establishment and expansion of Ixodes scapularis. plasmosis, human babesiosis, Powassan encephalitis, and Borrelia miyamotoi are also transmitted by Ixodes ticks. current surveillance for Lyme disease in Canada incorporates reporting of human cases, active environmental tick surveillance, and passive surveillance of ticks voluntarily submitted by doctors and veterinarians. owned domestic dogs in the capverde archipelago [98], samples submitted to diagnostic laboratories across the united states [59], and asymptomatic dogs presented to veterinary clinics in the united states [99]. utilizing owned domestic dogs, and testing convenient samples from laboratories or referral hospitals is likely to be an efficient method of undertaking sentinel surveillance. Ixodes scapularis has been isolated in three dogs from Saskatchewan. this pathogen has been isolated in three dogs with no history of travel. results from the present review have highlighted that the movement and travel of dogs may affect the movement and travel of dogs. current surveillance for Lyme disease in Canada incorporates reporting of human cases, active environmental tick surveillance, and passive surveillance of ticks voluntarily submitted by doctors and veterinarians [94]. despite the large number of dogs that are routinely tested each year for B. burgdorferi, veterinary laboratory data are not included in current surveillance mechanisms. toxoplasma gondii Globally, T. gondii is one of the most common foodborne parasites, causing an estimated 10.3 million cases and 825,000 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2010. it is not reportedable or immediately notifiable in Canada, although it is one of several pathogens for which reports must be annually submitted to the World Health Organization (WHO) toxoplasma gondii Globally, T. gondii is one of the most common foodborne parasites, causing an estimated 10.3 million cases and 825,000 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs in 2010. serosurveys have revealed seroprevalences ranging from 6.2% to 61.2% [101] it is not reportedable or immediately notifiable in Canada, although it is one of several pathogens. the surveillance of Babesia spp. is expected to provide information on expanding tick habitats, as well as potentially identifying new species. in 2017, Idexx veterinary laboratories reported 285 positive cases in Ontario, 39 in Manitoba, 30 in Quebec, and much fewer cases in new Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. clinical signs and radiographic thoracic lesions are not specific for the pathogen, which often leads to invasive diagnostic procedures to rule out other diagnoses such as cancer. there were 81 cases reported in the united states between 1941 and 2005 [110] despite a lack of reports of Canadian-acquired human infection, the known prevalence in dogs in southern Ontario and Quebec alongside the presence of human cases in the bordering states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and New York State could imply increased risk for human infection. limits of review Outcome-reporting bias and publication bias are recognized potential flaws of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. positive outcomes are more likely to be reported, and studies with significant or interesting conclusions are more likely to be accepted for publication. this review only included papers published in their entirety in English, which may have significantly limited the results. dog populations used would depend on the specific pathogen of concern. if the objective is to detect a new wave of viral transmission, repeatedly testing naive juvenile dogs would provide an ideal sample. if measuring prevalence of a rare disease, dogs at high risk for exposure should be selected. animal-sentinel surveillance is an indirect method of measuring risk to human disease. it is difficult to translate data obtained from such surveillance into a measured risk to humans. however, it is not immediately obvious whether a sentinel-surveillance study of companion animals would fall under the mandate of the CFIA or the Public Health Agency of Canada. the evaluation would need to consider the availability of an adequate sample population, efficient diagnostic testing tools, resources, and personnel to collect and process the data. the evaluation would need to consider the availability of an adequate sample population, efficient diagnostic testing tools, resources, and personnel. notifiable disease in people since 2009, with new pathogenic species detected in Minnesota and Wisconsin. not notifiable. southern Manitoba and southern Ontario Emergence of pathogen, increased risk of human infection. 60% of all data originated from the Latin American, North American, and Caribbean regions. 89% of data originated from high-income and upper-middle-income countries. majority of research conducted in Canada has been within First Nations (Indigenous) communities."}
