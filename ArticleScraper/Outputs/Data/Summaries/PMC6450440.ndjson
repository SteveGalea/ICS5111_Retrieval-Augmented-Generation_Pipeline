{"summary": "hRSV is a single-stranded RNA enveloped virus belonging to the Pneumoviridae family. the viral particle has a filamentous structure, which consists in a nucleocapsid surrounded by a lipid bilayer envelope obtained from the host cell. infection by hRSV is the most frequent cause of severe acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs) in children younger than 5 years old. hRSV can efficiently pass on from one individual to another, but also because of the capacity of this virus to negatively modulate both, T cell and B cell responses upon infection allowing frequent re-infections. infants show reduced capacity to produce neutralizing antibodies against hRSV, as compared to adults making the former more susceptible to recurrent infections. a single low dose of this recombinant-based vaccine conferred protection against hRSV infection in the mouse model. this recombinant-based vaccine arises as a promising candidate to prevent lung damage caused by this virus. if the hRSV N protein becomes neutralized by antibodies during infection it cannot contribute to viral replication. if the hRSV N protein becomes neutralized by antibodies during infection it cannot contribute to viral replication. immunization with rBCG-N-hRSV can induce the production of antibodies against other hRSV proteins, such as F and G which can serve to neutralize infection. adenovirus based vector vaccines are based in attenuated hRSV that lack some particular proteins such as M2-2, NS2 or both. c gamma receptors (FcRs) could be a process contributing to both, re-infection episodes, and enhancement of hRSV-disease elicited by vaccination with formalin-inactivated hRSV (FI-hRSV) and later hRSV natural infection. this hypothesis is supported by the fact that high amounts of antibodies with low neutralizing activity can be induced by immunization with FI-hRSV. the IgG promotes receptor clustering on the cell surface and the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues present on signaling motifs within the intracellular region of these receptors. these types of receptors are expressed on the surface of immune cells, such as neutrophils, dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. a study performed during 2002 indicates that the expression of FcRIIIa is increased in natural Killer cells from patients with severe hRSV associated pathology. however, there are two more non-classic human Fc-gamma receptors: neonatal Fc-receptor (FcRn) and cytosolic tripartite motif (TRIM) 21. phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is activated, which generates phosphatidylinositol trisphosphates (PIP3s), leading to the recruitment of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and the activation of phospholipase C (PLC), which promotes the release of calcium (Ca2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that mAb-blockade of DC-SIGN increases human DC maturation markers (CD80, CD86) after hRSV infection. hRSV-DC interaction through DC-SIGN might impair DC maturation. FcRIIb Kruijsen et al., 2010 FcRIII Activating In vivo: FcRIII/ mice-derived BMDCs loaded with hRSV-ICs showed restored capacity to induce the production of IL-2 by CD4+ T cells. different recruited kinases phosphorylate a conserved tyrosine within an Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Inhibitory Motif (ITIM) located in the cytoplasmic tail of FcRIIb. this phosphorylation step leads to the recruitment of tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2, as well as the inositol phosphatases SHIP-1 and SHIP-2 that suppress activating signals derived mice lacking activating FcRs (FcR/ mice) can be protected from ALI triggered by administration of IgG mAbs that recognize self-antigens. ALI was observed when FcR/ mice were adoptively transferred with wild-type neutrophils followed by the administration anti-MHC-I mAbs (Looney et al., 2006). hRSV induces the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (2) and chemokines that promote neutrophil recruitment to the lungs and the airways (3). hRSV is phagocyted by DCs and impair its maturation (4). cytokine is relevant, as it has been described that secreted IL-8 works as a chemotactic signal for neutrophils that induces their activation leading to pro-inflammatory responses. this in vitro evidence suggests that the engagement of FcRs can activate neutrophils and therefore contribute to lung inflammation and the progression of hRSV disease. DC-mediated T cell activation and IFN- production by these cells is modulated by the presence of activating FcRs on the DC surface. however, this observed increase in the IFN- response by CD4+ T cells was reduced when the DCs were derived from FcRIIb/ mice. new studies have shown that another IgG Fc receptor does not contribute to the activation of CD4+ T cells when DCs are loaded with hRSV-ICs. BMDCs from FcRn/ mice exhibit unaltered capacity to induce the production of IFN- by CD4+ T-cells. kine is required for the generation of memory regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs), which perform anti-inflammatory functions during hRSV infection. both, FcRIII and FcRIIb contribute to hRSV pathogenesis and re-infection. ADE during hRSV infection is an effect that has been reported in in vitro studies. however, a role of ADE during hRSV pathogenesis in vivo has been proposed. non-neutralizing mAbs can enhance the infection of phagocytic cell lines expressing these receptors. neutralizing antibodies were applied at sub-neutralizing concentrations (i.e., diluted), they induced ADE in phagocytic cells bearing FcRs. this was also observed using human sera and purified human immunoglobulin (IVIg) the role of complement fixing ICs in ERD was supported by experiments in C3/ mice. a sub-optimal, non-protective antibody response in mice was observed after immunization with FI-hRSV, but not infectious hRSV. a deficient TLR stimulation in B cells is likely responsible for the lack of Ab affinity maturation. specific antibodies displayed low neutralizing titers in vero cells. these antibodies were also able to cause ADE in in vitro assays. sub-optimal antibody production and the generation of ICs play a role in ERD development. low neutralizing antibodies induced by the FI-hRSV vaccine can form immune-complexes. low secretion of IL-2 by CD4+ cells activated by hRSV-IC-loaded DCs can lead to poor memory response that contributes to hRSV re-infection. classic members of this family of proteins were classified according to their immune-modulatory properties, which either promote or inhibit inflammatory responses. type-I or type-II FcRs include the classic FcRs and can only be engaged by the IgG Fc domain in the open conformation state (Banegas Banegas et al., 1987). in humans, the so-called classic FcRs are known as: FcRI (CD64), FcRIIa (CD32 there are two more non-classic human Fc-gamma receptors: neonatal Fc-receptor (FcRn) and cytosolic tripartite motif (TRIM) 21 that bind IgG once internalized into the cells. however, there is no study about it contribution to hRSV induced pathology in hRSV positive patients.

FcRn/ mice-derived BMDCs loaded with hRSV-IC display unaltered capacity to induce IFN- production by CD4+ T cells. FcRIIb which is able to terminate activation cascades associated with activating FcRs is also known as the inhibitory FcR. a pro-inflammatory role for the FcRIII receptor has been reported during hRSV infection in the mouse model. the inhibitory FcRIIb has been shown to hamper inflammatory reactions during allergic-like rhinitis, allergic asthma and hRSV infection. ALI was observed when FcR/ mice were adoptively transferred with wild-type neutrophils followed by the administration anti-MHC-I mAbs (Looney et al., 2006). ALI was observed when FcR/ mice were adoptively transferred with wild-type neutrophils followed by the administration anti-MHC-I mAbs. hRSV-ICs, established with hRSV and anti-hRSV autologous serum, but not free hRSV or antibodies alone, could promote the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by neutrophils. this cytokine is relevant, as it has been described that secreted IL-8 works as a chemotactic signal for neutrophils. hRSV-ICs containing either, neutralizing or non-neutralizing antibodies can modulate DC function and subsequent T cell responses elicited by the antigen presentation of these cells. DCs derived from WT adult mice were able to induce the production of IFN- by CD4+ T cells in the presence of anti-hRSV immune serum. unaltered secretion of IFN- by CD4+ T cells was observed in DCs derived from FcRIIb/ mice. this indicates that DC-mediated stimulation of IFN- secretion by CD4+ T cells does not depend on the presence of the inhibitory FcRIIb. this is required to prevent re-infection and disease severity in adult mice. mice exhibit unaltered capacity to induce production of IFN- by CD4+ T-cells. these results were validated in vivo. BMDCs display reduced capacity to induce IL-2 production by CD4+ T cells. type-I FcRs are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. they are either activating or inhibitory. the IgE receptor and the surface protein DC-SIGN are different. a pool of low-neutralizing antibodies during infancy can facilitate infection of immune cells that express FcRs. ADE during infection is an effect that has been reported in in vitro studies. however, a role of ADE during hRSV pathogenesis in vivo has been proposed. hRSV-ICs generated with low neutralizing antibodies can promote hRSV pathogenesis in vitro. hRSV vaccine was unable to produce protective immunity against hRSV. a formalin-inactivated hRSV vaccine was administered to children nearly 50 years ago. a sub-optimal, non-protective antibody response in mice was observed after immunization with FI-hRSV, but not infectious hRSV. the lack of affinity maturation in Abs elicited by FI-hRSV was associated with enhanced lung histopathology and AHR. hRSV inactivation produces a non-infectious virus with a high proportion of post-fusion conformation epitopes in the F protein (Post-F) (1). the inactivated virus is then phagocyted by B cells (2) that can present hRSV antigens to T cells in the context of MHC molecules (3). low secretion of IL-2 by CD4+ cells activated by hRSV-IC-loaded DCs can lead to a poor memory response that contributes to hRSV re-infection (9). hRSV is a leading cause of respiratory illness in infants and a major health burden worldwide. conflict of interest Statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
