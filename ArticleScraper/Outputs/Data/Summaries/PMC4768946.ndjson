{"summary": "classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is the etiological agent of a highly contagious viral disease of swine affecting domestic pigs and wild boars. it is composed of a lipid envelope, a capsid and a single plus-strand RNA genome. the ORF encodes a polyprotein of approximately 3900 amino acids. six-week-old, persistently infected pigs were unable to elicit specific immune responses following vaccination with a CSFV lapinised C-strain vaccine. the RNA of the vaccinal C-strain was undetectable by specific RT-PCR [8] in any of the samples analysed after vaccination. this suggests a phenomenon of homologous interference between the high viral load generated by the primary persistent infection and the CSFV vaccine strain. cells infected with BVDV were protected from a second infection by a homologous BVDV strain. the few surviving cells of the cytopathic effect (CPE) were also protected from the CPE after superinfection. the catalonia 01 strain used in this study was isolated from the spanish CSF epizootic in 2000\u20132001. the course of infection by this strain was mild [29, 31], and the virulent Margarita strain, which belongs to the CSFV 1.4 genogroup [29, 32, 33] was used. all of the animals were experimentally infected by i.m. injection in the neck. this viral dose caused acute CSF and often induced death at 10\u201315 days post-infection (dpi) surviving wild boars were euthanised at 13 dpi. urine and tissues were obtained at necropsy. a pentobarbital overdose of 60\u2013100 mg/kg was administered. otide positions were based on the genome sequence of the Margarita strain. the probe was labelled with 6-FAM at the 5 end and with BHQ1 at the 3 end. the primers and probe were purified by reverse phase HPLC. the one-step RT-PCR protocol was undertaken using a total volume of 25 l. RNA was extracted from an initial sample volume of 150 L to obtain a final volume of 50 L of RNA, which was stored at -80\u00b0C. the presence of CSFV RNA in the serum and in nasal and rectal swabs was analysed by a generic CSFV qRT-PCR [39]. samples in which fluorescence was undetectable were considered negative. qRT-PCR specific for the Margarita strain was used to distinguish samples infected with the strain. a total of 5x105 PBMCs/well were plated in triplicate at 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) of the Cat01 and Margarita CSFV strains. a total of 4x105 PBMCs/well from each animal were plated in triplicate at 37\u00b0C in 96-well plates. the presence of virus RNA in PBMC samples was analysed by qRT-PCR. for virus isolation, an established cell line sensitive for specific CSFV proliferation, ST cells, were cultured at 37\u00b0C in 96-well plates in triplicate. after 72 h, the supernatants were removed, and the collected ST cells were washed twice and resuspended in 200 l of sterile PBS. gene fragment was amplified by end point RT-PCR [45] in sera, tonsil, lung and spleen from animals 1, 3 (Group A), 4 and 5 (Group B), collected at necropsy. viral inoculums used in the experimental infections (Cat01 and Margarita strains) were evaluated. strain used in this study was isolated from the spanish CSF epizootic in 2000\u20132001. the course of infection by this strain was mild [29, 31], and the virulent Margarita strain, which belongs to the CSFV 2.3 genogroup [29, 32, 33], was found to be mild [29, 31]. clinical signs compatible with CSFV infection were anorexia, fever, conjunctivitis, diarrhoea, constipation, cyanosis of the skin, abdominal petechiae, dyspnoea, tremors, locomotive disturbances, swaying movement of the hindquarters, posterior paresis, convulsions from mild to severe. pleen, liver, intestine, mesenteric lymph node, prescapular lymph node, bone marrow, medulla oblongata, lung, kidney, thymus and tonsil were obtained at necropsy. the animal care and procedures were in accordance with the guidelines of the good experimental practices. the biosafety level of the viruses used in this study was stated as biosecurity level 3. real-time qRT-PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems\u00ae 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. the temperature profile was 30 min at 50\u00b0C (reverse transcription), 15 min at 95\u00b0C (inactivation reverse transcriptase/activation Taq polymerase), followed by 42 cycles of 15 s at 94\u00b0C (denaturation), 30 s at 57\u00b0C (annealing) and 30 s at 68\u00b0C (elongation).

PBMCs are targets for CSFV replication [47,48] to examine whether the PBMCs collected from the CSFV-superinfected animals (group B) and the acutely infected animals (group A) were permissive (or not) to CSFV superinfection. the previously analysed PBMC extracts were inoculated into a ST cell line. an 11.6 Ct value was found in the ST cells with Margarita inoculated PBMCs from group B. the whole protocol was repeated twice for animals 1 (group A), 4 and 5 (group B) in both SK6 and ST cells, supporting the results with similar Ct values. the cells\u2019 positive infection was confirmed by PLA testing. bCt value detected with the specific CSFV RNA Margarita strain q RT-PCR assay (37). bCt value detected with the specific CSFV RNA Margarita strain q RT-PCR assay. cula in the animal infection experiments were considered as references. differences in nucleotide sequences between the CSFV Margarita and Catalonia 01 strains are shown in grey and dark grey, respectively. virulent Margarita strain (Group B) showed no clinical signs of disease or fever. animal 2 showed a clinical score value of 4; however, it was found dead at 8 dpi. animal 1 and 3 progressed to dyspnoea, weight loss, swaying movement of hindquarters, posterior paresis and high fever until 10 dpi, when euthanasia was performed. a high and constant CSFV RNA load in serum, swabs and organs was maintained during the whole trial. the Ct values from group A (CSFV acutely infected wild boars; 1\u20133) and group B (CSFV-superinfected wild boars; 4\u20136) are represented in black and grey colours. rita RNA CSFV RNA Margarita RNA Spleen 18,57 17,70 17,2 17,90 17,09 16,23 21,4 32,91 20,35 36,15 20,85 Undet. liver 22,3 21,36 21,05 21,94 19,35 19,50 23,96 32,24 24,01 Undet. both qRT-PCRs were positive in organs and samples collected from animals in group A (Table 2). the Ct values were positive by the CSFV generic qRT-PCR [39], in both serum and swab samples, from 3 dpi onwards. the absence of humoral response in terms of E2-specific antibodies was found in both CSFV-superinfected groups during the entire experiment. progression of disease in group A was correlated with an increase in the levels of endogenous IFN- after infection, as measured by ELISA. in contrast, IFN- was undetectable in all of the serum samples analysed both before (day 0) and after Margarita inoculation of CSFV Catalonia persistently infected pigs (Group B) PBMCs from group B in vitro mock-infected were negative for CSFV-specific Margarita RNA detection. PBMCs from group B in vitro mock-infected were also positive for CSFV-specific Margarita RNA detection. the whole protocol was repeated twice for animals 1 (group A), 4 and 5 (group B) in both SK6 and ST cells. the cells\u2019 positive infection was confirmed by PLA testing. this test cannot differentiate between Cat01 and Margarita CSFV strains. ve animals 2.12c 11.6c a Ct value detected with the generic CSFV qRT-PCR assay. bCt value detected with the specific CSFV RNA Margarita strain q RT-PCR assay. strains shown in grey and dark grey respectively. despite its significance, the mechanisms of mutual exclusion by viral variants are far from being completely understood. despite its significance, the actual knowledge is basically derived from studies at the cellular level in established cell lines. the qRT-PCR assay developed allowed for clear discernment of whether there was actually a blockage that prevented susceptibility to infection by the second virus. despite the high infection rate of the Cat01 strain in persistently infected animals from group B (primary virus infection), good health status was maintained after inoculation with the Margarita CSFV virulent strain (secondary infection) in the absence of viral detection in sera throughout the study. strain generated the acute form of the disease in animals from group A. the failure of the humoral response in the pigs that developed acute CSF was previously described. the availability of mammalian models for SIE in vivo is hampered by the interferon response generated against the infecting virus in these species [11, 24] it is noteworthy that CSFV postnatally persistently infected swine have shown an immunosuppression state comprising a reduction in interferon responses (Types I and II) at 13 dpi, low levels of Margarita RNA were detected only in some collected tissues from persistently and superinf PBMCs from persistently infected animals were substantially protected from superinfection after in vitro inoculation with the Margarita virus strain. these results suggest that RNA still occurs at the tissue level. however, next-generation sequence analyses would be of great interest to analyse these samples in detail. our results suggest efficient suppression of viral superinfection in a mammalian host. this indicates a lack of innate immune mechanisms. the potential outcome for the generation of new CSFV strains circulating in an endemic situation and the impact on disease control."}
