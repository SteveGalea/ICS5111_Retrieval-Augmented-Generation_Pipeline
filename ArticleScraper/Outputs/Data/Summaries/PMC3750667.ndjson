{"summary": "the MDCK vial 1 and vial 2 cells were obtained from ATCC. working cell banks of these 2 lots were established at passages 57 and p58. the third subline of MDCK-DVP is a line of MDCK-DVP cells. heterozygous (NCrnu/+) female mice bred with homozygous (NCrnu/+) male mice were bred with homozygous (NCrnu/+) male mice. the pregnant mice were housed singly in microisolation and individually ventilated caging with sterilized bedding. 19 of the 145 newborn mice were asymptomatic mice and their sex was not determined. the health status of these animals was monitored daily. the animal facility is SPF and AAALAC-accredited. inoculated newborns were marked by tattooing as soon as the homozygous nude (nu/nu) pups could be distinguished from their haired (heterozygous nu/+) littermates (about 4 d of age) the nude newborns were followed by clinical observation, and body weight measurements were recorded every 2 to 3 d, from age 4 to 40 d. injected mice included the weights of 36 pups from 7 litters in 3 replicate experiments. weight curves and statistical comparisons were generated by using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) a working cell bank of MDCK-DVP cells was prepared at passage 25. the relationship between the passage level of the cells and that of the MDCK cells obtained from the ATCC is unknown. additional human cell lines were obtained from the ATCC. ine adenovirus, mouse coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus, mouse norovirus, mouse parvovirus, mouse thymic virus, minute virus of mice, polyoma virus, reovirus 3, rat minute virus, rat parvovirus, sendai virus, Seoul virus, theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus-like virus, theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus strain GDVII. pregnant female 107 cells in PBS (pH 7.0) were inoculated subcutaneously in the dorsal region of the thorax over the scapulae in 0.1 mL by using 1-mL syringes with 27-gauge, 0.5-in. needles. inoculated pups were evaluated initially by clinical observation. weights of uninoculated, nude pups from a cohort of 5 litters containing 26 nude pups were obtained from age 4 to 84 d. weights of newborn mice injected with PBS were compared with those of normal mice and those of mice injected with MDCK cells. weight curves and statistical comparisons were generated by using GraphPad Prism 5. mice were weighed and observed every other day for 30 to 40 d for symptoms suggestive of illness or abnormal growth and development. symptomatic mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation, necropsied and evaluated for signs of disease, tumor formation, and metastasis. a time-course of inoculation showed an age-related correlation with the development of FTT. female pup (age, 17 d) with moderate FTT (weight, 4.4 g) inoculated with 107 MDCK vial 1 cells at age 24 to 48 h. all 65 newborn mice inoculated with these human cell lines developed rapidly growing tumors. no tumors were apparent according to clinical observation or necropsy in 1 pup with moderate FTT and 2 pups with severe FTT. clinical observation of growth-retardation, as well as lethargy, weakness, dehydration, and, in some cases, scoliosis of the thoracic spine were the criteria used during the initial portion of the study that involved MDCK vial 1 cells. failure to grow and gain weight, rather than signs of systemic illness, were the most reliable symptoms of the FTT syndrome. curve generated for each disease category differed significantly (P 0.05) from the weight curve of control mice. weights of these maturing pups obtained either at euthanasia or at 2- to 3-d intervals illustrated the development of severe, moderate, and mild FTT. weight curves generated according to each disease category differed significantly (tailed assays) from the weight curve of control mice. culated pups were heterozygous (nu/+) haired mice. over the 180-d observation period, the haired mice failed to develop tumors. thereafter, the haired pups were routinely euthanized when the mice were weaned. 26.5 or more 46/67 (69) 5\u201320 0/67 (0.0) Mild FTT 21 14\u201343 5.3\u201318.5 (7.7\u201324.3) 20/21 (95)b 2\u201310 7/21 (33) Moderate FTT 41 14\u201331 3.2\u201311.6 (7.7\u201320.3) 40/41 (98)b 5\u201310 23/41 (56) Severe FTT 16 14\u201330 3.0\u20136.7 (7.7\u201319.7) 14/16 ( 43 d of their life; their weights were between 5.3 g on day 14 and 18.5 g on day 43 (average weight for control mice: age 14 d, 7.7 g; age 43 d, 24.3 g) only 1 of the 41 (98%) mice with moderate FTT lacked tumor development. of the 35 newborn mice inoculated with the MDCK vial 2 cells, 34 (97%) developed tumors and 26 (74%) developed FTT. of the 34 mice that developed tumors, 8 (24%) developed mild FTT, moderate FTT was observed in 15 (44%), and severe FTT occurred in 3 (9%). tumors that developed in newborn mice inoculated with MDCK vial 1 and vial 2 cells were adenocarcinomas that showed similar characteristics. tumors formed by MDCK vial 1 and vial 2 cells were aggressive, with mitotic figures in both epithelial and spindle cells. small areas of inflammation were present within the parenchyma of some tumors. mice inoculated with MDCK vial 1 or vial 2 cells developed scoliosis. there is invasion into paravertebral muscles (yellow arrow) and vertebral column. there is invasion into paravertebral muscles (yellow arrow) and between a vertebral body (tailed arrow) and adjacent rib (arrowhead). 107 cells/mouse exhibited severe retardation of growth. a time-course of inoculation showed an age-related correlation with the development of FTT. a time-course of inoculation showed an age-related correlation with the development of FTT. all 65 newborn mice inoculated with these human cell lines developed rapidly growing tumors. none of the tumor-bearing mice developed clinically observable signs of FTT. no tumors were apparent according to clinical observation or necropsy in 1 pup with moderate FTT and 2 pups with severe FTT and inoculated with MDCK vial 1 cells. the marked growth retardation exhibited by critically ill pups provided the basis for the diagnosis of the FTT syndrome in these animals. average weight of age-matched control mice were classified as having no disease. mice with mild FTT weighed between 60.1% to 80.0% of the control weight. mice with moderate FTT weighed between 40.1% to 60% of the control weight. in the first 4 experiments with MDCK vial 1 cells, 67% of the inoculated pups were heterozygous (nu/+) haired mice. over the 180-d observation period, the haired mice failed to develop tumors, and their general health and development appeared normal. weight range (average normal weight;
