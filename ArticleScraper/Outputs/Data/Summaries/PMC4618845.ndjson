{"summary": "the 2014\u20132015 outbreak in west africa is already the largest on record. the outbreak extended to liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, and Senegal. the precise time when control of an epidemic has been achieved is difficult to determine during the course of the epidemic. the model consists of SEIR-type state spaces with two sequential exposure classes with progression rates chosen to provide a gamma-distributed incubation period of 10 days with a shape parameter of 2. the model distinguishes diagnosed from undiagnosed (and unknown) infectious cases with undiagnosed cases becoming diagnosed at a given rate. a Monte Carlo likelihood of the observed data given parameter values is calculated according to a Poisson distribution with C t as the rate parameter. an alternate likelihood was derived by directly estimating the probability that the simulated number of confirmed cases exactly matched the observed number. this procedure is repeated for each of P particles, consisting of state and parameter values. previous authors have observed the non-identifiability of specific parameters for the Ebola process [16, 17], and our model is not identifiable either. we assign values for all parameters except for the transmission coefficient. of particular importance is the fraction of unconfirmed cases since an arbitrarily changing pattern of incomplete reporting is indistinguishable. the number of confirmed cases using standard surveillance definitions was obtained from the WHO Global Health Observatory's patient database. the number of confirmed cases was given by week for liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea from January 5, 2014 to July 29, 2015. the model is simulated as a continuous-time Markov chain. based on the state of the system at the beginning of any given week (X (t) the model is projected forward with the SEIR model, yielding the state at the end of the week X (t+1) to prevent depletion of particle diversity over time due to successive resampling, the resample/move method [15] is used. after resampling, the parameter values for each particle are perturbed using a symmetric transition kernel. the original values of X (t) for that particle are used and the projection recomputed with new particles, leading to a new value for the Monte Carlo likelihood, L' the cumulative incidence is small compared to the total population of each country, and we assume the susceptible fraction is essentially 1. we used weekly country- and subcountry-specific confirmed case count data obtained from the WHO Global Health Observatory's patient database available on the internet. results There were 3,897 confirmed cases in liberia as of July 26, 2015. the black line in the figure inset shows the cumulative number of cases over time for each of the 14 districts. the cumulative number of cases over time for each of the 25 prefectures that reported data are shown using different colors. in liberia, the median R ranged from 0.9 to 4.6 between March 23, 2014 and October 5, 2014. the quantiles of the reproduction number are displayed on the last day of each week. from bottom to top, the quantiles are 0.025, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50 (black line), 0.75, 0.90, and 0.975. the black horizontal line shows the threshold for subcriticality. three-month ensemble forecast produced estimates of the basic reproduction number between 1.5 and 2.0 using data from July 6, 2014 to august 9, 2014. basic reproduction numbers were estimated to be 1.6 for liberia, 2.5 for Sierra Leone, and 1.5 for Guinea using data as of august 20, 2014 [24]. with control measures, the effective reproductive number dropped to around 1.0 in Guinea and Sierra Leone by the end of May and July 2014, respectively. a combined approach involving different control strategies (i.e., case isolation, contact-tracing with quarantine, and safe funeral and burial practices) must be implemented. the wide credible limits on the reproduction number seen near the end of the time series may reflect, in part, low power resulting from small case counts.
