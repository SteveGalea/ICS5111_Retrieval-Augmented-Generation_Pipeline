{"summary": "an uncritical acceptance of empiricism, or even of evidence-based medicine, can also be problematic. a reliance on empirical evidence and rigor should not be confounded with a dogmatic faith in empiricism itself, which can also be problematic7\u20139. dissident examples of AIDS10,11 and vaccine denialism12\u201318 are employed as an interpretive schema, or lens, through which to view events that link dissident perspectives in scientific publication to harmful outcomes. such an approach offers a useful heuristic in order to highlight a certain type of harmful use of science, which has previously been categorised as 'pseudoscience' a textured discussion of the dangers of medical pseudoscience is provided here. the problems of dogmatic empiricism are also highlighted to demonstrate the pervasiveness of medical pseudoscience as a problem that cannot be simplistically argued away with reference to notions of scientific evidence. medical denialism and academic pseudoscience round off the paper. empiricism can amount to little more than dogma. empiricism can amount to little more than dogma. a cautionary perspective on empiricism. social empiricism is often epistemologically undesirable, says ilism26. consensus is typically epistemologically undesirable, says ilism26. ilism is a new paradigm associated with methods such as randomised controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. literature suggests that publication bias, time to publication bias and pharmaceutical funding bias are responsible for the worse-than-expected track record of random controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. translational medicine seeks to develop interdisciplinary synergies between researchers and to create interactive linkages between research in clinical medicine. the current efforts to address the medicolegal system and remuneration may not be enough to change the \u201cart\u201d of medicine through the \u201cscience\u201d of randomized trials. the seminal work of Kuhn20 predicts that paradigmatic change can occur in scientific research, but that researchers typically reject novel facts that do not conform to the assumptions and values associated with a particular paradigm. melweiss24 illustrates how professionals can reject innovative ideas even in the face of evidence of the catastrophic human costs associated with this rejection. it was only two decades later that his work was revisited by the medical profession24, and the \u2018new paradigm\u2019 of sterile hand washing was embraced. AIDS policy in post-apartheid south africa has been shaped by persistent antipathy towards antiretroviral drugs. this hostility was framed initially by the president's questioning of AIDS science and subsequently by direct resistance to implementing prevention and treatment programmes using ARVs. if the national government had used ARVs for prevention and treatment at the same rate as the Western Cape, about 171,000 HIV infections and 343,000 deaths could have been prevented between 1999 and 2007. this particular form of pseudoscience is taken here to relate to the power relationships of political actors and the prioritisation of ideology. this large scale loss of human life was found to be due to scientific denialism on the part of certain respected academics. anti-vaccine movement is seen as a cautionary tale about the pervasiveness of pseudoscientific beliefs in developed nations. a link between dissident academic publication and the rise of the pseudoscientific anti-vaccine movement is seen in the emergence of the populist anti-vaccine movement. the use of science to justify the objectives of the AIDS denialist state is considered to warrant the term \u2018pseudoscience\u2019 as they seem to meet these criteria. more than this, these examples offer examples of moral failure that seem to require differentiation from other instances of conflict with empiricism. it is therefore important to provide an informed discussion that embrace these broader debates. the work of historians of science, sociologists of science, anthropologists of science, feminist critics, social psychologists and decision analysts has sought to offer scientists a heuristic based on decision vectors. these decision vectors can be based on empirical data or conceptual rationales. the wellspring for most pseudoscientific ideas has been academia. dissident theory predicted that HIV was caused by ARVs is an example falling into the low validity portion of the continuum shown in Figure 1. however, so should all health theory that has not been empirically tested, in some way. a Type II error is evident, in that there was a failure to reject theory that was patently at odds with the accumulated evidence to date. medical pseudoscience is a relatively unique form of pseudoscience that takes the form of extreme denialism. it is vulnerable to those with political agendas or other motives associated with moral failure. a cautionary perspective on empiricism can amount to little more than dogma. the problem of medical nihilism highlights seemingly insoluble problems. the McKeown Thesis derives from McKeown's argument that in certain contexts the fall in the crude mortality rate over time was largely \"due not to life-saving advancements in the field of medicine or public health,\" and instead to improvements in overall standards of living. some have considered the contributions of economics and nutrition to overshadow the role of public health interventions (p.1014)27. piricism may open scientific endeavour up to the shortcomings of problematic forms of consensus. piricism suggests an instrumental, or pragmatic approach, whereby evidence should be ranked with reference to actual (and not theoretically expected) reliability of results. translational medicine seeks to develop interdisciplinary synergies between researchers. it might ultimately hold the key to reducing problems associated with discrepancies between published recommendations and clinical practices. medical science is acknowledged to lead the way in evidence-based research, despite the problems associated with dogmatic approaches to empiricism. a powerful example of Kuhn's theory in the medical context is the work of semmelweiss24. the case of semmelweiss24 illustrates how professionals can reject innovative ideas even in the face of evidence of the catastrophic human costs associated with this rejection. a core argument presented in this paper is that professional medical work, including policymaking, requires constant vigilance. the examples of AIDS and vaccine denialism might be a useful interpretive schema, or lens, through which to view events that link dissident perspectives in scientific publication to harmful outcomes. this example is illustrative, offering useful insights into a paradoxical situation of power misuse that led to the deaths of many who were the most vulnerable and powerless. this paradox seems to mirror the anti-science discourse driven by politicians in current political discourse, whether relating to the denial of climate change or the selective use of science in support of political agendas. AZT itself caused AIDS rather than treating or preventing it. denialists of the presidential AIDS Advisory panel asserted that AIDS would disappear instantaneously if all HIV testing was outlawed and the use of antiretroviral drugs was terminated. the anti-vaccine movement serves as a cautionary tale about the pervasiveness of pseudoscientific beliefs in developed nations. the anti-vaccine movement serves as a cautionary tale about the pervasiveness of pseudoscientific beliefs in developed nations. the harm associated with pseudoscience is well illustrated in light of the examples considered above. the tensions between unlimited thought in academic contexts (which are good) and opportunistic use of ideas for political or ideological reasons are not independent of real life contexts informed by medical science. theorists must navigate between modes in different roles to theorise innovatively. to theorise innovatively, one would need to sacrifice validity temporarily. to develop models that can then be tested for validity. the sokal hoax34 highlights the potential for theory to be published by respected journals, but specifically formulated on the basis of confounding logics. a contribution of this paper is arguably in the way it identifies and highlights dangers associated with the way that both Type I and Type II errors can actually be committed. empiricism seems to be driven by political forces, making such discourse vulnerable to moral failure. however, epistemic caution may be an important watchword in a world in which political forces may increasingly have the power to harness scientific and medical denialism in pursuit of ideological agendas."}
