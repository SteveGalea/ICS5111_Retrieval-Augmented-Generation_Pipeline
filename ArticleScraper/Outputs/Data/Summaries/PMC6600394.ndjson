{"summary": "hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a DNA virus belonging to the Hepadnaviridae family. the virus consists of an external lipoprotein envelope and an internal protein nucleocapsid with icosahedral symmetry. the viral genome is a partially double-stranded circular DNA molecule with four partially overlapping open reading frames. chronic HBV infection can result in a wide range of clinical conditions. from viremic patients carrying huge quantities of antigen in their blood and liver to immune subjects with occult persistence of trace amounts of virus within the liver and without detectable antigenemia. five phases have been identified in its natural history. virus reactivation at therapy discontinuation is due to the persistence of cccDNA in the nucleus of infected hepatocytes. the alternative therapeutic option is based on interferon-alpha (IFN) but an HBV cure is achieved in only 10\u201320% of IFN-treated patients and therapy is frequently associated with severe side effects. the overall exhausted CD8 T cell population is heterogeneous in terms of phenotypic, functional and transcriptional profiles. correction of anti-viral T cell defects and boosting virus-specific T-cell responses represents a rational strategy to cure chronically infected patients. new immunotherapeutic approaches for chronic hepatitis B are currently in clinical development. infected patients can be modified to express antitumor/antiviral T cell receptors (TCRs) or chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) patient-derived CD8 T cells can be modified to express antitumor/antiviral T cell receptors. gene expression profiling and functional T cell analysis of exhausted CD8 T cells led to the characterization of the role played by PD-1 and other highly co-expressed inhibitory molecules. PD-1 blockade is believed to facilitate virus latency reversal in CD4+ T cells. clinical trials are still very limited in the field of chronic viral infections. investigations documenting the up-regulation of multiple checkpoints on both circulating and intrahepatic virus-specific CD8 T cells. overexpression of several checkpoint ligands, such as PD-1 and 2B4 on circulating monocytes and B cells, can likely contribute to T cell exhaustion maintenance. exhausted HBV-specific T cells also appear more prone to apoptosis, as shown by the up-regulation of the death receptor TRAIL-2 and the pro-apop PD-1/PD-L1 blockade can induce some improvement in both the T and B cell arms of the cellular immunity, with a more efficient effect on the intrahepatic than on the peripheral compartment. a synergistic effect of a PD-L1 blockade has been reported to significantly augment IFN-gamma and IL-21 producing HBV-specific CD4 T cells in vitro. no severe adverse events were reported but no further effects were observed on HBsAg decline. potentiation of antiviral T cell responses by the addition of a therapeutic vaccine containing core envelope and x antigens was not able to stimulate cell-mediated HBV-specific responses. genetic and epigenetic factors can contribute to the variable individual checkpoint expression and to the development of the T cell exhaustion state. recurrent immune-mediated liver damage can contribute to the development of cirrhosis and HCC [58]. recurrent immune-mediated liver damage can contribute to the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a CD8 T cell-dependent manner [57] the same approach has been applied to rescue exhausted tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. the same approach has also been applied to rescue exhausted tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, with a positive effect of PGC1 over-expression on glucose uptake, glycolysis and mitochondrial dysregulation. nutrient competition and restriction in the tumor microenvironment represent factors responsible for T cell dysfunction also in the infected liver. a genome-wide transcriptome study of virus-specific CD8 cells showed an extensive downregulation of genes coding for different mitochondrial components of the electron transport chain (ETC), fatty acid and amino acid metabolism and heme biosynthesis. those coding for the mitochondrial membrane fusion protein OPA1, the mitochondrial enzyme CPT-1, and the costimulatory receptor CD28 could represent factors affecting the correct T cell differentiation. mitochondrial modulation should be considered in the perspective of immune-modulatory strategies targeting people have been developed, including protein- or peptide-based, DNA- and viral vector-based vaccines. many different vaccine therapies for chronically HBV infected patients have already been evaluated in clinical trials. YIC versus alum alone Combined with Adefovir 44 Pilot clinical study Recruitment completed; anti-viral response observed in YIC group. results not reported ePA-44 Multi-Peptides (HBV + tetanus toxoid) TG1050 consists of a non-replicative adenovirus 5 vector encoding a unique fusion protein composed of modified core, polymerase and selected domains of the envelope proteins. it is currently under evaluation in a Phase Ib study in chronic patients with inhibition of HBV replication induced by antiviral therapy. GS-4774 has been tested in a phase 2 trial in virally suppressed CHB patients. it could effectively promote virus-specific CD8 T-cell responses breaking T-cell tolerance in viremic HBeAg-negative patients. the absence of clinical benefits is probably due to the weaker CD4 T cell stimulation. the role of adjuvant has emerged as a further critical component to overcome different mechanisms of T cell dysfunction. ePA-44 consists of immunodominant epitopes derived from preS2 18-24 region, core-18-27 and tetanus toxoid. an ideal approach should aim at achieving a functional restoration of CD4, CD8 T and B cell responses, likely needed for long-term control of HBV infection. lowering antigen load before T cell boosting to minimize the risk related to hepatic flares and favor functional T cell restoration. a better characterization of T cell exhaustion heterogeneity should help identify the patient populations with a prevalence of exhausted T cell subsets that are better responsive to T cell revitalizing strategies. in the last few years researchers have also considered extending T cell engineering to therapies for virus infections such as HIV-1, CMV, HBV, HCV and SARS [100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107]. circulating T lymphocytes isolated from CHB patients have been expanded and activated in vitro and then engineered using viral vectors encoding HBV-specific TCR to redirect their specificity towards HBV. T cells capable of causing drop of HBsAg produced by HCC cells with integrated HBV-DNA in an HBsAg positive patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). short HBV-DNA fragments were sequenced and used to select the HBV-specific TCRs for individualized engineered T cell immunotherapy. infected targets independently of the patient HLA haplotype have been engineered using a chimeric antigen receptor (CARs) this technology combines an HBV-specific antibody fragment with the co-stimulatory CD28 molecule and the CD3 zeta intracellular domain. this technology allows primary human T cells to recognize and kill HBV infected hepatocytes expressing HBsAg on their surface and to eliminate viral cccDNA in vitro. a recent study describes the shRNA knockdown of PD-1 in TCR-redirected T cells. PD-1 knock-down led to a compensatory increase of alternative co-inhibitory receptors. recent reports have highlighted the importance of modulating in vitro CAR-T cell metabolism before transfer in vivo. restoration of functionally efficient adaptive responses is believed to be a possible strategy to control HBV infection in chronically infected patients. despite this, inhibition of antigen production may actually represent the first possible strategy to reconstitute adaptive responses, in consideration of the high antigenemia constantly present in chronically infected patients. a possible solution may be silencing of key intracellular co-inhibitory pathways to relieve intrahepatic suppression and the amplification of the non-cytolytic potential of engineered CD8 T cells. additional work is needed to find suitable solutions to limit the risk, improve the efficacy and simplify the clinical application of adoptive transfer interventions on the one hand."}
