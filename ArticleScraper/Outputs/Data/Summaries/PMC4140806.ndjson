{"summary": "passive immunity is the primary protection against infections in early life for several species, including humans [1]\u2013[4]. however, this protection is only temporary due to maternal antibodies waning and, in the absence of vaccination, individuals become fully susceptible to infection. timely vaccination in regards to passive immunity waning appears crucial to optimize vaccine efficacy. zoonotic agent can cause enterically-transmitted hepatitis in humans. domestic pigs are considered as the main reservoir. studies have focused on quantifying the protection conferred by passive immunity. the antibody titers A in piglets which received maternally-derived antibodies (MDAs) were assumed to decrease exponentially with age according to the equation. as the initial antibody titer would likely be related to the dam's serological status, dam antibody titers were consequently considered as a covariate. metric bootstrap procedure was used to determine the 95% confidence intervals for the parameters estimates and thus measure their accuracy. the 95% confidence interval was constructed from the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of distribution parameters. in this sub-model, we compared this model structure to a simplified version assuming that passive immunity played no role in the transmission process. the proportion of individuals with passive immunity and susceptible individuals is governed by: (5) (6) Whatever the assumption concerning the impact of passive immunity, the proportion of infected individuals is given by: (7) Model (3-4-7), in contrast to model (5-6-7) which considers a single force of infection. gamma proposal distributions were updated using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. three chains were run with random initial conditions, 50000 steps per chain, a burn-in of 1000 steps and a thinning parameter of 10. ELISA allows the detection of all classes of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA and IgM) regardless of the animal species. samples were considered positive when the OD450 value was above the cut-off value (Co = mean of the negative control + 0.300) the antibody titers would therefore depend on the initial level of antibodies delivered at birth and the antibody decay rate. dam antibody titers were consequently considered as a covariate related with the initial level of antibodies A0 in offspring. bootstrap replicates were generated by resampling individual profiles for each dataset. the 95% confidence interval was constructed from the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of distribution parameters. in this sub-model, the proportion of individuals with passive immunity is governed by: (5) (6) Whatever the assumption concerning the impact of passive immunity, the proportion of infected individuals is given by: (7) Model (3-4-7), in contrast to model (5-6-7) which considers a single force of infection. three chains were run with random initial conditions, 50000 steps per chain, a burn-in of 1000 steps and a thinning parameter of 10. the following epidemiological model was developed to account for passive immunity duration and differential forces of infection according to the serological status of individuals at birth. model (3-4-7), which considers two forces of infection, is called the \u201cfull model\u201d in contrast to model (5-6-7) which considers a single force of infection. the true number of infected individuals is not directly observed so the true number of infected individuals of age in herd. a commercial test was used to detect anti-HEV antibodies in pigs. the test uses a proprietary recombinant antigen, which is highly conserved between different HEV strains. six farrow-to-finish spanish swine herds of similar size were included in the study. in each farm, 20 piglets from 6 previously selected sows were randomly selected and ear-tagged. serial blood samples were collected at 3, 7, 13, and 18 weeks. a double sandwich ELISA was used to detect anti-HEV antibodies in pigs. the test is based on a double sandwich ELISA that allows the detection of all classes of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA and IgM) regardless of the animal species. serological investigations in sows revealed a mean HEV seroprevalence of 77% at farrowing with variations (from 70 to 90%) between batches. piglets were positive for anti-HEV antibodies at one week of age. we assumed gamma distributions for the duration of PI. we used the bootstrapping method to estimate shape and scale parameters. all but one herd (herd 2) exhibited similar profiles with a huge increase in prevalence between 7 and 13 weeks of age, leading to asymptotic behavior close to 1. the forces of infection exerted on fully susceptible individuals were estimated on average 1.8 times higher than with the SFOI model (range: 1.3 \u2013 2.0; Table 2). transmission in piglets with PI was found, on average, 13 times lower than in fully susceptible animals. the impact of PI on time to infection was assessed by modeling the infection-free survival functions in piglets with MDAs (Figure 3; full line) and fully susceptible animals (Figure 3; dashed lines) for each herd. in the herds with high prevalence, fully susceptible individuals escaped infection according to exponential distributions with median infection-free survival ages ranging between 2.7 and 7.6 weeks. piglets were correlated with the titer of their dam (Sow = 0.66, SE = 0.04, p0.001; Table 1). the estimated antibody decay rate was 0.4 per week (SE: 0.02, Table 1) which corresponded to a half life of 12.1 days. all but one herd (herd 2) exhibited similar profiles with a huge increase in prevalence between 7 and 13 weeks of age, leading to asymptotic behavior close to 1. observed prevalence data, derived from longitudinal data in six pig herds in Spain [23], are represented by red dots. with PI was found, on average, 13 times lower than in fully susceptible animals. the impact of PI on time to infection was assessed by modeling the infection-free survival functions in piglets. fully susceptible animals escaped infection according to exponential distributions. median infection-free survival ages ranging between 2.7 and 7.6 weeks. infection-free survival age in piglets was much higher than in fully susceptible animals. we present an original approach to investigate and model the impact of PI on the transmission of an infectious agent in pigs based on batch-level prevalence data. the model only provides a simplified representation of the actual process of hepatitis E virus transmission with a main shortcut relying on the assumption of constant forces of infection. data from a longitudinal survey in france were used to characterize the kinetics of maternally-derived antibodies in 120 piglets. the duration of PI was modeled by a gamma distribution with a mean duration of 45.6 days [41.4; 50.4] the probability of remaining passively immune fell below 0.1 by 60 days of age. two models were tested assuming an equal force of infection in the presence and absence of MDAs (SFOI) or two different forces of infection. neither model fitted the null prevalence observed at 3 weeks of age for two main reasons. peak HEV prevalence occurs after the nursery stage, at about 13 weeks of age. the predicted average age-at-infection in herd 2 was considerably higher. this difference could only be explained by differences in herd structures and husbandry practices. the methodology developed in this study could be extended to quantify the level of protection conferred by maternally-derived antibodies for different pathogens and species. colostrum intake or transplacental passage play an important role in several mammalian species [47]\u2013[49]."}
