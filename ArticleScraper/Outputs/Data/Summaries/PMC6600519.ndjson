{"summary": "MS is an inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) it is the most common neurological cause of debilitation in adults, with an incidence of 0.1%. cross-reactivity between nonself proteins, such as those from bacteria or viruses, has been proposed to be a possible mechanism for the onset of autoreactive T-cell responses. mDCs obtained from MS patients produce higher levels of IL-12 and IL-6 in response to a TLR-7/8 agonist [15] Conversely, pDCs in MS patients produce lower levels of interferon (IFN)- compared to healthy subjects [15]. impaired expression of CD40 in pDCs from MS patients could impair responsiveness to a CD40L stimulus. mDCs are discriminated as singlets, singlets, live dead, Lineage, CD4+, live dead, Lineage, CD4+, CD14, CD16, and CD11c+ (a) Flow cytometry analysis of a representative experiment is shown in (b) Graphs represent the results of independent experiments (c) (* p 0.05; ** p 0.01; *** p 0.001) OX40L regulates IL-9 production by human CD4 T lymphocytes. pDCs can be differentiated in three subpopulations, recently identified on the basis of the expression of the immune-checkpoint molecules. we measured the frequency of PDL-1+ CD80 (P1), PDL-1+ CD80+ (P2), and PDL-1 CD80+ (P3) in both healthy donors and MS patients. in healthy donors the frequencies of P1 and P3 are significantly higher compared to the P2 subpopulation, while in MS patients the frequency of P3 is significantly higher. Flow cytometry analysis of a representative experiment is shown in (a) Graphs represent the frequency of P1, P2, and P3 populations (b), or median fluorescence intensity of PDL-1 and CD80 (c) of independent experiments. we performed ex vivo cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from blood of MS patients and healthy donors. viable plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are discriminated as singlets, CD45+, live dead, Lineage, CD4+, CD14, CD16, and CD123+. further staining with antibodies against HLA-DR, CD86, and OX40-L enabled evaluation of mDC activation. Flow cytometry analysis of a representative experiment is shown in (b) Graphs represent the results of independent experiments (c) pDC subpopulations can be differentiated in three subpopulations compared to healthy donors. pDC subpopulation expresses high amount of costimulatory molecules, including CD80, CD86 and OX40-L. we measured frequency of PDL-1+ CD80 (P1), PDL-1+ CD80+ (P2) and PDL-1 CD80+ (P3) in both healthy donors and MS patients. clear cells from healthy donors or MS patients were stimulated with Resiquimod (R848) or medium alone for 6 hours, then stained with antibodies against CD3, CD19, CD56 (Lineage), CD45, CD14, CD16, CD4 and Fixable Aqua Dead Cell stain. pDCs from healthy donors are differentially activated compared to pDCs from healthy donors in response to single strand RNA mimicked by Resiquimod. recombinant OX40-L induce and amplify IL-9 production by human T cells. other costimulatory molecules upregulated in pDCs from MS patients are considered as the predominant molecules delivering \u201dfirst and second signals\u201d during T-cell activation. axis can indirectly promote CD8 T cell priming through augmenting CD4 T cell help [35], and directly enhances the expansion of memory CD8 T cell populations specific for viruses [36], including EBV. in active and inactive MS patients, the frequency of CD8+ T cells specific for EBV lytic and latent antigens is higher in active and inactive MS patients, respectively, compared to healthy donors. patients with a relapsing\u2013remitting (RR)-MS inactive state were enrolled in the study. all patients included in this study did not take immunomodulant or immunosuppressive compounds at least 2 months before recruitment. all patients included did not take immunomodulant or immunosuppressive compounds at least 2 months before recruitment. the cells were stained with anti-FITC (Miltenyi; 1/100), anti-CD45RA BV421 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA; 1/60), anti-CD45RO PE (BD Biosciences; 1/30), anti-CD27 APC (Miltenyi; 1/60), and CD4+ naive T-cells were sorted by a MoFlo high speed cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, Atlanta, anti-human CD45-FITC (Coulter; 1/200), OX40-L-PE (BD; 1/50), CD4-ECD (Coulter; 1/100), CD16-BB700 (Pharmigen; 1/100), CD86-APC (Miltenyi; 1/80), CD11c-APC-AlexaFluor700 (Coulter; 1/100), CD14-APC-Vio770 (Miltenyi PBMCs were cultured at a density of 1 106 cells/mL in 24well plates. cells were stained with antibodies discriminating viable pDCs and pDCs. cells were stained with anti-CD4-FITC (Miltenyi; 1/100) and CD4+ T Lymphocytes were purified by immunomagnetic selection. anti-CD45RO PE (BD Biosciences; 1/30), anti-CD27 APC (Miltenyi; 1/60), and CD4+ naive T-cells were sorted by a MoFlo high speed cell sorter. cells had a purity of over 97%, measured by flow cytometry. samples were washed in EDTA-containing medium, acquired using a Cytoflex cytometer (Coulter) and analyzed using FlowJo-10 software. p values (p) of 0.05 or less were considered statistically significant."}
