{"summary": "each family member mediates important anti-viral activity via engagement with their respective IFN receptor. IFNs are divided into three types: type-I mainly represented by IFN-3,4,5 and -,6,7 type-II by IFN-,8 and type III consulting the recently discovered IFN-lambda family. IFN- is the sole representative of type-II IFNs. IFN- is not induced via direct sensing of virus fragments but rather through stimulation of epitope-specific T cells. IFNL3 demonstrates the highest anti-viral activity as measured by encephalomyocarditis virus. IFNL3 had a 16-fold lower half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) compared to IFNL2 and IFNL2.29. d on chromosome 92 and almost all cell types can elicit a type-I IFN response. the receptor subunits are associated with Janus-activated kinases (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2. the interaction induces phosphorylation of STAT-1. IFNL1 (interleukin (IL)-29), IFNL2 (IL-28A), IFNL3 (IL-28B)9,10 and the very recently described IFNL4.20,21 All are encoded on chromosome 19. IFNLs belong to the IL-10 family of cytokines containing IL-10, IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24 and IL-26. an amino-acid sequence alignment of human IFNL1\u20134 is shown. red letters indicate significant differences. green letters indicate common cysteines. a rapid downregulation of IFNL4 mRNA expression at 8 h was observed. however, IFNL3 mRNA was still expressed 24 h after stimulation. this may suggest either a lack of an amplifying positive feedback loop, or rapid induction of a specific negative feedback mechanism. IFNLs are directly induced through sensing of viral infection via pattern recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 or melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5.17,51. the synergistic effect of Med23 and IRF7 on IFNL induction suggests that this may be a particularly important transcription factor. single nucleotide polymorphisms A series of SNPs near the IFNL3 and IFNL4 genes have been discovered and importantly are noted to be in high linkage disequilibrium. IFNL4a rs10853727 major: A/A\" - Higher post-vaccine measles titers 76 (IFNL3) Minor: A/G, G/G IFNL4 ss469415590 Major: T/T CDR Frameshift, causing IFNL4 expression HCV: reduced IFN- treatment response, lower rates of spontaneous clearance. no study has shown a significant increase in IFNL3 expression due to a SNP. there is a high likelihood that SNPs may also affect the function of other genes in the locus. expression in brain tissue was low.9,10,45,82,83,84,85 IL-28RA also exists as a membrane bound form and a secreted form lacking exon VI. secreted receptor may bind and inhibit IFNLs. multiple SNPs in IL-28RA have been described (rs10903032, rs10903034, rs10903035, rs11249002 and rs11249006). rs10903035 IL-28RA SNP has been associated with insulin resistance in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. ligand\u2013receptor complex The ligand interface includes helix A, loop AB and helix F. IL-28RA interface arises from the N-terminal domain and interdomain hinge region. the extracellular region of IL-28RA has two -sandwich domains D1 and D2. CpG-DNA induces expression of IFN-, - and IFNL1\u20133, but not IFN- in myeloid DCs. poly(I:C) can also induce IFNL4 expression in the appropriate genetic background. NP in the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the IFNL3 gene has been associated with mRNA stability. some of these SNPs are possibly just in linkage with other functional SNPs (e.g., rs12979860 with ss469415590). the rs129 79860 and the rs10853727 have their 'true' location in IFNL4. the impact of the SNPs on IFNL expression is debated. almost 40% of Caucasians express IFNL4. IFNL binds to the IL-28RA (-subunit; encoded on chromosome 1), followed by the corecruitment of the IL-10RB (-subunit; encoded on chromosome 21). a significant upregulation of IL-28RA surface expression could be observed. primary hepatocytes show an initial low responsiveness to IFNL due to a low baseline mRNA expression of IL-28RA. this upregulation was significantly enhanced in patients with a minor allele SNP genotype in IFNL3. rs10903035 IL-28RA SNP has been associated with insulin resistance in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. rs4649203 has been linked to a risk to develop systemic lupus erythematosus. IFNL4 is important via the helix D amino acids: Gly95 in IFNL3 and Val95 in IFNL2. differences in inducible responses to IFNs may arise due to differences in IFNL subtype expression, different ligand binding affinities and competition among IFNs for the same receptor. the antiviral activity of IFNLs has been demonstrated in cell cultures infected with murine CMV,83 HIV,40 influenza virus,108,109 hepatitis B virus91 and HCV. the role in direct antiviral effects in vivo has also been demonstrated in IL-28RA and STAT1 knockout animals. IFNL4 showed an almost 10-fold lower EC50 in a human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell luciferase reporter system. the efficacy of his-tagged IFNL4 secretion seems to be significantly lower compared to IFNL3, which may account for the lower EC50. RNA sequencing of HepG2 cells transfected with IFNL4 and treated with IFN- and IFNL3 suggests some genes known as markers of HCV-induced liver damage were specifically induced by IFNL4. this suggests specific functional roles for IFNL4, distinct from IFN- and IFNL3.21. treated hepatocytes (USP18: 16.5- to 4.2-fold; SOCS1: 2.3- to 0.5-fold) IFNL3 upregulated USP18 and SOCS1 over 24 h (USP 18: 13.6- to 19.6-fold; SOCS1: 3.3- to 6.8-fold) 123,124,125,126 Elevated basal ISG expression and treatment failure have both been linked to SNPs in the IFNL3/4 and IL-28RA genes. the role of SNPs in the IFNL signaling may also be highly important for existing \u2018old\u2019 and \u2018emerging\u2019 pathogens. increased expression of these immunoregulatory ISGs may lead to a cumulative reduction of anti-viral ISG expression. the paradoxical situation of higher ISG expression in IFNL3 SNPs despite lower IFNL3 gene expression could be explained by disruption in temporal regulatory aspects of type-I and -III IFN-signaling cascades. a major allele genotype with a presumed fully functional IFNL3 expression during virus replication. the genotype results in a significantly different ISG background expression. this can foster breakthrough replication of viruses and subsequent selection of quasi-species resistant to ISGs. at present, we would propose that the higher baseline expression of ISGs in patients with a minor allele genotype arises due to a combination of persistent activation of the IFN- signaling cascade and a general reduction of inhibitory signals such as USP18. the newly discovered SNP in IL-28RA stands to affect all IFNL signaling, further disrupting the IFN- and IFNL cross-talk. the impact of the minor allele genotype for IFNL3 (rs12979860) is unresolved following conflicting reports in terms of disease progression. it could be proposed that DNA viruses with accurate proof reading such as cytomegalovirus would be at a disadvantage in a high ISG environment. treatment and expression in hepatocytes is associated with potent induction of 'immunoregulatory' ISGs. these ISGs act in an inhibitory capacity to dampen pro-inflammatory cascades. in liver biopsies from HCV-infected patients with a major allele genotype, A20 and ZC3H12A were upregulated. ISG expression comprises both anti-viral and immunoregulatory profiles. IFNL3 is highly expressed and may better inhibit the initial replication of a virus due to a longer lasting anti-viral effect of induced ISGs. this may culminate in virological control and ultimately affect spontaneous clearance of virus. properties of ISGs are similar to those of antiviral therapy where the threshold of replication is determined by a minimal inhibitory concentration. if the exposure of the virus towards ISGs is on occasion, as a consequence \u2018subtherapeutic' mutation can occur with selection of quasi-species. it remains to be seen if indeed the activity of this new gene product can directly account for the differing phenotypes observed. graft has a minor allele genotype, and the recipient has a major allele genotype. a relatively ISG-susceptible virus (from the major allele recipient) has to replicate in a high ISG expression background (minor allele donor graft) the adaptive immune response is impaired meaning viral replication control is achieved preferentially by the innate immune response. macrophages can regulate host defence, wound healing and immune regulation. the differentiation cascade of monocytes to macrophages is influenced by IFNL.88 IFNL1 increases TLR-induced IL-12p40 production in human macrophages. IFNL1 upregulated, whereas IFN- downregulated, the surface expression of the IFN- receptor -subunit on macrophages. the influence of IFNL3/4 SNPs and IL-28RA genotypic background on macrophage polarization and function remains to be studied. IL-12 and IFN- are the critical cytokines in the differentiation of T-cell subsets into a Th1 or Th2 phenotype. antigen-presenting cells such as DCs and macrophages play a decisive role in the differentiation of Th1 cells. 1 treatment,157 and super-antigen stimulated cells pre-treated with IFNL1 showed significantly lower levels of IL-13. naive T cells exposed to allogeneic myeloid DC showed a similar reduction in IL-13 production compared to IFN- secretion being unaffected. a study has examined the effects of IFNL1 and IFNL2 on the activation of B cells by anti-CD40 with/without cytokines. one study has examined the effects of IFNL1 and IFNL2 on the activation of B cells by anti-CD40 with/without cytokines. one study has examined the effects of IFNL1 and IFNL2 on the activation of B cells by IFNLs. IFNL1 increases TLR-induced IL-12p40 production in human macrophages. IFNL1 enhanced IFN-induced IL-12p40 and tumor necrosis factor production by macrophages following R848 stimulation. IFNL3/4 SNPs and IL-28RA genotypic background on macrophage polarization and function remains to be studied. major allele genotype shows a predominant polarization to a macrophage M1 phenotype. minor allele genotype may show a relative increase of M2 phenotype. these macrophage phenotypes are associated with downstream regulation and polarization of Th1 and Th2 cells. IL-4 and IL-2 are critical for Th2 differentiation. the major transcription factor involved in Th2 lineage differentiation includes the IL-4-induced STAT6, which upregulates the expression of the master regulator GATA3.152,153,154,155. reduced Th2 cytokine expression may be of particular importance for immune-mediated lung diseases such as asthma. Keeping to the respiratory microenvironment blockade of the IL-28R markedly reduced the suppression of CD4 T-cell proliferation. a large cohort of healthy children vaccinated against measles had significantly higher post-vaccine antibody titers (median 807 mIU/mL versus 1727 mIU/mL) this actually suggests that the SNP potentially affecting IFNL4 expression may have a significant impact on antibody production in general; against pathogens, in response to vaccination, or in autoimmune diseases. this signaling cascade appears optimally positioned to orchestrate or be manipulated to effect robust and durable responses to an ever-increasing array."}
