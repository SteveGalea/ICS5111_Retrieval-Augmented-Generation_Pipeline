{"summary": "middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging threat to global health security. this infection is caused by a zoonotic single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of the -coronavirus family that causes epidemics or even pandemics with substantial morbidity and mortality. the majority of infected patients (85%) are from Saudi Arabia. the health ministry of Saudi Arabia recommends pilgrims over 65 years. the disease has high intensity and lethality with unknown epidemiological factor and pattern. every year, millions of Muslims travel to the epicenter of this infection to attend Hajj. long-standing traditions of sharing and hospitality increase the likelihood of MERS-CoV transmission to others. all data of MERS-CoV cases retrieved on the WHO website were anonymous or de-identified. logistic regression was used to assess potential relationship between probable risk factors and the final outcome (dead/survived) of the laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases. P-values 0.05 were considered statistically significant, and for the model, a value of 0.1 was considered significant. onset of symptoms 11.0 18.3 12.4 68.7 23.3 0.000 Need for admission to negative pressure isolation room or ICU 66.9 83.2 64.9 18.5 60.1 0.000 Comorbidity 6.8 18.8 53.2 39.0 39.7 0.000 Morbid case is native 98.3 85.9 81.7 79.5 83.8 0.000 Mean age, years (SD) 52.0 (19.5) 49.4 (18.2) 53.6 (17.9) 54.5 (16.8) 52.9 (18.0 hospital 1\u201314 days prior to the onset of symptoms 24.9 22.3 0.313 Need for admission to negative pressure isolation room or ICU 58.4 61.1 0.386 Comorbidity 36.1 41.9 0.057 Morbid case is native 87.4 81.6 0.011 Mean age, years (SD 54.0 (18.8) 52.2 (17.4) 0.113 Travel history 8.6 5.3 0.038 Secondary case 32.3 33.1 0.776 Note: Data presented as percentage, unless otherwise stated. 0.053 0.984 0.969 1.000 2015 Background of contact with morbid case at home or hospital 1\u201314 days prior to the onset of symptoms 0.018 2.861 1.194 6.860 Need for admission to negative pressure isolation room or ICU 0.004 0.577 0.399 0.835 Age 0.001 1.018 1.007 1.028 Travel history 0.077 1.956 0.929 4.116 Secondary case 0.039 0.396 0.164 0.954 2016 Admission to hospital the global distribution status of MERS-CoV in the world suggests that outbreaks emanate primarily from Saudi Arabia. the tradition of consuming raw camel milk is observed in arab countries with high occurrence rates of MERS-CoV infection. in all years, the proportion of males was higher than in females. the comparison of characteristics of the cases and the effect of various potential risk factors on the final outcome (dead/survived) of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases in the world reveals that two factors, namely, morbid case being native and travel history, are considered significant in a unifactorial analysis. however, some interesting factors such as nativity and travel history that are significant in predicting mortality varied in different years. this might introduce a negligible selection bias in the results. findings point to interesting and potential dimensions of the dynamic evolution of this disease. effective national and international preparedness plans are essential to prevent, control, and predict such viral outbreaks."}
