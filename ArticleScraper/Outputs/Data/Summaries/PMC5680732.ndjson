{"summary": "calf diarrhea is the most important cause of disease in calves 30 d of age. the financial losses arise not only from mortality, but also from the cost of medication (especially antimicrobials), labor needed to treat sick calves, and delayed growth of calves. animal viruses are among the most important etiologic agents of acute NCD. this review focuses on animal viruses and their role in NCD. in 1970, 2 viruses were isolated from cases of NCD on Nebraska ranches. the role of some of these viruses in NCD still remains undetermined. the first one was a reo-like virus that induced disease generally within the first 96 h of life, causing diarrhea. the second virus isolated was a coronavirus-like agent that was reported to infect calves between 5 d and 6 wk of age (15) the reo-like (now known as rotavirus) and coronavirus-like viruses, as well as an adenovirus, were identified in dairy calves from Quebec and Ontario (16). subsequently, other viruses were identified in feces of calves with gastroenteritis, such as calicivirus (17,18), to bovine rotavirus (BRoV) typically causes diarrhea in calves 3 wk of age (22) clinical signs are non-specific as is characteristic of NCD. two case-control studies from Brazil and the USA detected BRoV in feces of 11% and 30% of diarrheic calves, respectively, compared to 0% in healthy calves. one study from france also reported BRoV in 49% of diarrheic and 45% of healthy beef calves (28). differences among studies include age of the calves sampled, geographic location, management practices, experimental design, and assays to detect BRoV. most of these studies were cross-sectional in design. bovine coronavirus has been associated with gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in cattle including diarrhea in neonatal calves (33), winter dysentery (34), and respiratory tract illness (35). in dairy and beef calves, BCoV can cause enteritis with naturally infected calves showing clinical signs of disease between 5 and 30 d of life. the diagnosis of BCoV enteritis can be achieved using viral culture, antigen-capture ELISA, hemagglutination assay using mouse erythrocytes, and PCR (45). the utility of panCoV to detect BCoV in samples of humans with clinical diseases has not been described. the success of the passive immunity against enteric viral infection depends on the continuous presence of a protective level of specific antibody in the gut lumen (50,51). BRoV and BCoV normally cause diarrhea between 5 and 14 d of age, a time that has been associated with a major decline in specific antibody concentration. the efficacy of parenteral vaccines for prevention of diarrhea caused by BRoV and BCoV is unclear. inactivated BRoV (serotype G6-P5), inactivated BCoV (originally isolated from a calf with diarrhea) and purified cell-free E. coli F5 showed a 4-fold increase, for at least 28 days, in antibodies against BRoV and BCoV in colostrum and milk of vaccinated cows compared to the control group (53). however, this study failed to demonstrate vaccine efficacy through an animal challenge model limited studies have reported prevalence rates of 7% to 80% for shedding of BRoV by diarrheic calves. two case-control studies from Brazil and the USA detected BRoV in feces of 11% and 30% of diarrheic calves, respectively, compared to 0% in healthy calves. bovine coronavirus (BCoV) has been associated with gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in cattle including diarrhea in neonatal calves (33), winter dysentery (34), and respiratory tract illness (35). in dairy calves, BCoV can cause enteritis with naturally infected calves showing clinical signs of disease between 5 and 30 d of life. the prevalence of BCoV in healthy and diarrheic calves was investigated in dairy farms from Ontario at 3 periods: 1982, 1990 to 1991, and 1995 to 1997 (39\u201341). the overall prevalence ranged from 5% to 17%. the remaining 2 studies failed to differentiate the prevalence of BCoV in both groups. infection control practices dealing with reducing exposure are beyond the scope of this review. the importance of good colostrum management is without debate. most cows are seropositive to BRoV due to field exposure. but antibody titers of milk decline to non-protective levels after parturition. colostral antibodies to BRoV and BCoV were similar in both groups, suggesting that the vaccine resulted in limited impact on passive transfer of immunity. several other studies have reported that pregnant cows vaccinated against BRoV and BCoV had increased antibodies in colostrum and milk. bovine torovirus (BToV) has been identified in feces of diarrheic and healthy calves. one study identified BToV in 43/118 (36%) diarrheic and 5/43 (12%) healthy calves. another failed to detect any association of BToV with calf diarrhea. natural infection usually occurs in calves between 2 and 5 d of age. calves up to 4 mo appear to be the major source of the virus (60,61) results from limited studies have reported ranges of 1.6% and 72% in Canadian dairy calves and USA veal calves, respectively (64,65), and up to 10% in healthy calves in Europe (66,67). one study identified BNoV as the sole detected pathogen in 4% of samples from diarrheic calves and along with other pathogens in 20% (68); however, conclusions regarding the true role of BNoV as a primary pathogen or co-infection were limited. BNebV was detected in fecal samples of diarrheic calves but not in healthy animals (67) in france, the united kingdom and Korea, the prevalence of BNebV in diarrheic calves ranged from 7% to 9% (67,70,71) BNebV was commonly detected in feces also positive for BCoV, Cryptosporidium parvum or BToV (26) experimental infection of gnotobiotic calves with the BAstV-USA strain caused infection and cytopathology of M-cells of the dome epithelium. gnotobiotic calves developed severe diarrhea and more extensive BAstV infection (62) study of BAstV in field situations has been limited. bovine enterovirus (BEnV) belongs to the genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae. the enterovirus genus consists of 12 species; 9 enteroviruses (A to J) and 3 rhinoviruses (81). the pathogenesis and virulence of BEnV in cattle are largely unknown. one study described the pathogenesis associated with acute infection of BEnV in calves experimentally inoculated with the inoculated BEnV. however, the control group used in this study was inadvertently infected with the inoculated BEnV. bovine torovirus has been identified in feces of diarrheic and healthy calves. one study identified BToV in 43/118 (36%) diarrheic and 5/43 (12%) healthy calves. another study failed to detect any association of BToV with calf diarrhea. lesions in the intestine caused by torovirus infection are expected to result in malabsorptive and hypersecretory diarrhea (48). clinical signs observed in naturally occurring outbreaks include a yellow to white semisolid or profuse watery diarrhea (19). if the calf survives, it can be fully protected but can intermittently shed BoTV (58,63). strain exhibited anorexia and diarrhea associated with necrosis of the intestinal epithelium and villous atrophy (69). but evidence that BNoV is a significant (or even rare) cause of diarrhea in calves in the field is limited. nebovirus is a non-enveloped member of the family Caliciviridae. bovine astrovirus The family Astroviridae includes 2 genera, Mamastroviruses and Avastroviruses that infect mammals and birds worldwide. the role of BNebV in diarrhea in the field remains unclear. gnotobiotic calves developed severe diarrhea and extensive BAstV infection. one study identified BAstV as the sole detected pathogen in 8% of the fecal samples and along with other viral agents in 24% (68). the lack of comparative data with a healthy control group limits what can be concluded from that study. the lack of comparative data with a healthy control group limits what can be concluded from that study. two recent studies compared the prevalence of BKV in healthy and diarrheic calves from Italy (80) and Korea (75) in the italian study, the prevalence of BKV was similar in diarrheic (5.3%; n = 38) and non-diarrheic (4.8%; n = 104) calves. in the Korean study, BKV was found in 37% (32/86) of diarrheic and 24% (5/21) of non- benV was detected in 25% of healthy and diarrheic calves. the authors failed to report the prevalence in healthy and diarrheic calves separately. conclusions regarding a potential association with disease cannot be made. piglets that shed 6 or more distinct viruses were more likely to suffer from diarrhea (88). rotavirus was identified as the single etiological agent in 18 cases. dogs with diarrhea can simultaneously excrete several enteric viruses. dairy calves reported a rate of co-infection of 14% (17/118) in diarrheic calves. co-infection was not detected in clinically normal calves (41). similar results were reported in calves suffering from diarrhea in Australia.
