{"summary": "the innate immune system is the first line of defense that protects the host against viral infection. the initiation of IFN expression is triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) through host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) TGEV PL1 processes the nsp2/nsp3 site and is capable of hydrolyzing isopeptide bonds in both Lys48- and Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. TGEV PL1 encoded by the replicase gene could suppress the IFN- expression and inhibit the nuclear translocation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) flag-TBK-1) were generated with the following primers. pMyc-PL1, pFlag-PL1, and pPL1-Myc, encoding TGEV PL1. pDsRed2-Mito was purchased from Clontech (Tokyo, Japan) cell supernatants of transfected PK-15 cells were centrifuged at 3,000g for 5 min to remove cell debris and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. expression of p-IRF3, IRF3 and GAPDH was detected with the rabbit-anti p-IRF3 (ab76493), IRF3 (ab68481) and a mouse anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody (Sigma, St Louis, USA) HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pcDNA3.1-HA-Ub plus the indicated amounts of TGEV PL1 and p-Flag-RIG-1. the effect of TGEV PL1 on ubiquitinated proteins in cultured cells was assessed by immunoblot analysis. cells were treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse. samples were washed with PBS and fluorescent images were acquired. hek293T cells were transfected with Flag-STING (500 ng per well) and the lysates were subjected to Western blot. HEK-293T cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected with 1 g plasmid encoding Myc-TGEV PL1 or empty vector. after 10 h infection, cells were lysed, and activities of IFN--Luc and pRL-TK reporters were determined according to the manufacturer's protocol. luciferase assay identified the precise transcription factor involved. TGEV PL1 inhibited IFN- production in PK-15 cells at protein level. flag-PL1 also inhibited IFN- production in PK-15 cells. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with flag-PL1, IFN--Luc, pRL-TK, and 500 ng flag-STING or 500 ng empty vector. expression of TGEV PL1 inhibits STING-mediated activation of the IFN- promoter in a dose-dependent manner. hek293T cells were cotransfected with alanine mutants of three conserved catalytic residues of TGEV PL1. the intact catalytic triad of TGEV PL1 is required to inhibit activation of the IFN- promoter driven by STING and TBK-1. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the 500 ng catalytic mutants C32A, H183A, and D196A, together with reporters of IFN--Luc and pRL-TK. TGEV PL1 has been shown to possess DUB activity. HEK293T cells were transfected with TGEV PL1 together with Flag-RIG-1 and Flag-STING for 24 h. lysates were subjected to coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot to determine the ubiquitination status of the immunoprecipitated protein. TGEV PL1 antagonizes the IFN signaling pathway via deubiquitination of RIG-1 and STING. HEK293T cells were transfected with Flag-RIG-1 (d) or Flag-STING (e), together with HA-Ub in the presence or absence of Myc-TGEVPL1. lysates were immunoprecipitated with Flag, HA, and Myc antibodies. TGEV PL1 is an IFN antagonist. myc-TGEV PL1 inhibits the activities of IRF3 (b), NF-B (c) and AP-1 (d) luciferase activities were assayed as described for (a) results represent the means and standard deviation of data from three independent experiments. TGEV PL1 inhibited IFN- production in PK-15 cells at protein level. hek293T cells were transfected with TGEV PL1 and/or IRF3-EGFP. the result was analyzed using Western blot and confocal microscopy. expression of TGEV PL1 inhibits STING-mediated activation of IFN--Luc in a dose-dependent manner. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with certain Flag-PL1, IFN--Luc, pRL-TK, and 500 ng flag-STING or 500 ng empty vector. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with alanine mutants of three conserved catalytic residues of TGEV PL1 (C32A, H183A, and D196A) with or without RIG-1, MAVS, STING, or TBK-1, and IFN--Luc and pRL-TK plasmids. the intact catalytic triad of TGEV PL1 is required to inhibit activation of the IFN- HEK293T cells were transfected separately with RIG-1 (500 ng), MAVS (500 ng), STING (500 ng), or TBK-1 (500 ng), together with IFN--Luc and pRL-TK. TGEV PL1 has been shown to possess DUB activity. HEK293T cells were transfected with TGEV PL1 together with Flag-RIG-1 and Flag-STING for 24 h. lysates were subjected to coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot to determine the ubiquitination status of immunoprecipitated proteins. TGEV PL1 displays DUB activity that is dependent on its catalytic activity. lysates were immunoprecipitated with Flag, HA, and Myc antibodies. TGEV is known to induce robust expression of IFN- at the late step of the replication. a delayed activation of the IFN response in intestinal epithelial cells has never been reported. catalytic activity of TGEV PL1 is essential for inhibiting IFN- transcription. also, STING dimerization is reduced in presence of HCoV-NL63 PL2-TM. TGEV PL1 acted as an IFN antagonist to negatively regulate host antiviral innate immunity. the membrane protein M and envelope protein E of TGEV were translated at the late step of the replication as the major inducing component of IFNs. further studies are required to establish precise functions of PL1 protease/DUB activity in coronavirus interactions with the host innate immune response."}
