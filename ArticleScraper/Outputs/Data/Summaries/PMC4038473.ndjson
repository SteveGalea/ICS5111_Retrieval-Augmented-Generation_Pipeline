{"summary": "human enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a causative agent of hand, foot and mouth disease. infection with EV71 is more often associated with neurological complications in children under 3 years of age. a major concern has been the emergence of a syndrome of rapidly fatal pulmonary edema associated with brainstem encephalitis in the Asian epidemics. EV71 is a small non-enveloped single positive-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Picornaviridae family, genus Enterovirus, species Enterovirus A. a solution would be to exploit future passive immunotherapy based on monoclonal antibodies produced in cell culture. a linear epitope on VP1 encompasses amino acids 215-KQEKD-219. this region is conserved among all EV71 subtypes. a monoclonal antibody against this epitope is able to protect mouse pups from lethal EV71 infection. representative strains of EV71 subgenotypes listed in Table 1. subgenogroups B1 (GenBank AF135901), B3 (GenBank AF376093) and C3 (GenBank AY125973) were constructed using the human RNA polymerase I reverse genetics system.

TCID50 was measured by end point dilution and IFA as well as microneutralization against mAb 10D3. PCR products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel and purified by QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany) a direct sequencing reaction was performed using gene- and strain-specific primers and BigDye terminator cycling. pJET-B4-wt plasmids were transfected into RD cells to generate RG/B4-wt virus. mutations were introduced into pJET-B4-wt plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis. pJET-B4-p59L was further mutated by primers B4-E67D-f. pJET-B4-A62D B4-VP3-A62D-f CAATGTACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACC the slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and observed under light microscopy. the experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines for animal experiments. EV71-B4 was inactivated with binary ethylenimine (BEI) for 48 h at 37\u00b0C. for animal immunization EV71-B4 was concentrated 10-fold by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g for 3 h. free BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously on days 0, 14 and 28 with inactivated EV71-B4 strain in 0.1 ml PBS, emulsified with an equal volume of adjuvant. an intraperitoneal booster of the same virus dose without adjuvant was administered 3 days before the mice were euthanized. resulting hybridomas were grown in DMEM with 20% FBS containing HAT or HT for 10 days. dot blot assay Reverse-genetically (RG) constructed viruses were propagated in RD cell cultures. cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 8,000 g for 40 mins. resulting pellet was centrifuged in a 20\u201360% discontinuous sucrose gradient. the mixtures were mixed with an equal amount of serial dilutions of mAb 10D3 or mAb 51 as a positive control. the mixtures were incubated for 1 h at room temperature before adding them in triplicates to the wells of microtiter plates containing 80% confluent RD cells. assays were carried out independently three times. viral RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Germany) was used to extract viral RNA from filtered RD cell culture supernatants containing wild-type and escape mutant virus. Typical yields were 80\u2013100 ng/L as measured by nanodrop.

BLAST analysis of amino acids 59\u201367 of VP3 revealed 388 EV71 hits which were 100% identical in the region analyzed. the amino acid identity was 97% for the full VP3 protein. VP3 is thus more highly conserved between subgenogroups than VP1 (93% identity), making it an ideal target for a diagnostic or therapeutic mAb. VP1 is visible to the right, while VP2 is in the foreground and VP2 in the back. indicated in yellow are the epitopes of some previously identified mAbs of EV71 as well as the conformational neutralizing epitope of mAb 10D3 in the knob region of VP3. the 3D crystal structure of EV71 C4 virus was downloaded from NCBI. the EV71 VP3 protein is shown in a side on view with the outside of the virion located at the top of the image and the inside on the bottom. stereographic images of 10D3 escape mutations. amino acids 59P, 62A, and 67E are shown in yellow. images generated by Swiss Model. mAb 10D3 is a universal EV71 neutralizing antibody directed against a conformational epitope. mAb 10D3 is a universal EV71 neutralizing antibody directed against a conformational epitope. three BALB/c mice were immunized with 100 L of inactivated EV71-B4 strain virus. mAb 10D3 neutralized all EV71 subgenogroups with a neutralization titer of 26 (genogroups A, B) to 28 (genogroup C) against 100 TCID50 of wild-type virus. mAb 10D3 reacted with reverse genetically engineered wild-type B4 virus (RG/B4-wt) blotted in its native form (RG/B4-wt) mAb 10D3 recognizes all 11 EV71 subgenogroups and does not cross-react to coxsackievirus A16. FITC conjugated anti-mouse mAb was used to detect signals. RD cells were infected with RG/B4-wt and mutated RG viruses for 2 days. mAb 10D3 staining was abolished in all escape mutants carrying either the mutation P59L, A62D, A62P or E67D (B) wild-type EV71 viruses from different subgenogroups incubated with excess of mAb 10D3 on RD cells. if no CPE was visible after 4 days, supernatants were filtered and added to fresh RD cells. 1 to 3 cycles were necessary to isolate escape mutants for all subgenogroups.

VP3 mutations were introduced by human RNA polymerase I driven reverse genetics system. mAb 10D3 was unable to neutralize the mutated RG viruses by an in vitro microneutralization assay. mAb 51 against the linear neutralizing epitope KQEKD on VP1 was incubated with the mutated RG viruses. the mutated RG viruses were then rescued in RD cells and used in subsequent experiments. mAb 51 was still able to efficiently neutralize all RG viruses. the escape mutations are sufficient for the abolishment of mAb 10D3 binding to the VP3 protein. the loss of neutralization of mutated RG viruses was established in a microneutralization assay. the epitope of mAb 10D3 could be located by stereographic imaging. in Fig. 4 the epitopes of mAb 51, 7C7 and 10D3 are shown on the virus surface. both sites lie on the major protrusion of VP3 on the capsid surface termed \"knob\" the epitopes of some previously identified mAbs of EV71 are indicated. the three escape mutation sites at amino acid positions 59, 62 and 67 on VP3 are indicated. the 3D crystal structure of EV71 C4 virus (MMDB ID: 97658) was downloaded from NCBI. the EV71 VP3 protein is shown in a side on view with the outside of the virion located at the top of the image. the \u201cknob\u201d structure is indicated with the bracket. it consists of a helical protrusion on the capsid surface encompassing amino acids 55 to 69 of VP3. the escape mutations P59L, A62D, A62P, and E67D are illustrated in yellow. the images have been generated by Swiss Model and were analysed by Vector NTI v11.5.1 (Life Technologies) brain histopathology of EV71 infected AG129 mice and of mice prophylactically protected with mAb 10D3. cross-section of brain stem from isotype control mice with arrows pointing to regions with neuropil vacuolation and neuronal loss without inflammation in the brain stem. the epitope of 10D3 was found to be conformational, making it a highly specific antibody with a potential application in differential diagnosis of HFMD. mutants are integral to the \u201cknob\u201d structure of EV71 VP3 protein that protrudes out of the capsid surface, and is completely conserved among all EV71 sequences deposited in GenBank. stereographic imaging revealed that the two mutations lie in close proximity to one another, forming a conformational epitope with VP3 in EV71. the mAb 7C7 against EV71 VP2 has a linear epitope quite close to CVB3 VP2 158, i.e. residues 142\u2013146 [37]. mAb979 (Merck Millipore, Germany) recognizes a peptide of VP2 spanning residues 136\u2013150 which encompasses the 7C7 epitope [48] neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are specific antiviral agents that can be used for the passive immunization of patients with acute viral infections. they offer a selective advantage over pooled human sera that are more commonly used in IVIG treatment by reducing the risk of transmitting pathogens"}
