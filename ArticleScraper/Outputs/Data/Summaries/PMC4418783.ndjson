{"summary": "acute respiratory infection (ARI) episodes were identified through clinic-based illness surveillance, hospital admissions and self-reports. self-reported ARI episodes were 1.5-fold higher in urban and semi-rural cohorts. southern Vietnam birth cohort study includes highly urban district in central Ho Chi Minh City. mixed urban/rural district in Dong Thap province, 150 km south-west of HCMC. a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) was collected from infants presenting with respiratory symptoms. a new ARI episode was defined by 7 days between symptom onset dates. a new ARI episode was defined by 7 days between symptom onset dates. PCR was performed as a 4-tube assay on a Roche Lightcycler 480 II using primers and probes. PCR was performed as a 4-tube assay on a Roche Lightcycler 480 II. NPS samples were not available from ARI episodes identified retrospectively from self-reports or from hospital admission records. incidence of ARI was calculated separately based on clinical presentations to a study clinic or self-reported episodes, with IYO as the denominator. a weighted ARI incidence estimate for all-cause ARI was calculated by combining the stratum-specific estimates. the total number of infections for most viruses was too small to stratify by study site as well as age-group and season. it was not informative to combine 2 sites with such different ARI incidences. infants were enrolled within 72 hours of birth, before discharge from hospital. in HCMC, infants had 2 additional follow-up visits at 1 and 3 months of age. at each visit, data was collected on any illness episodes since the last routine visit. ARI was classified on the basis of a self-reported diagnosis. the second was data on admissions to 3 hospitals in HCMC and the provincial hospital in Dong Thap. the second was data on admissions to all infants under 1 year of age in our catchment districts. the PCR was performed on a Roche Lightcycler 480 II using primers and probes as described previously. the PCR was performed as a 4-tube assay on a Roche Lightcycler 480 II using primers and probes as described previously,15 except for the rhinovirus primers and probes which were: AgSCTgCgTggCKgCC. only a random sample of specimens collected from outpatient ARI visits were tested. we examined the distribution of infant observation time, and the age-structure, by calendar month. the age-structure of the infants under observation did vary considerably across calendar months. RESULTS Study Population Between July 1, 2009 and August 31, 2010, 2459 infants born to 2445 women were enrolled in the cohort. 63 (16%) moved, 197 (51%) were lost to follow-up or failed to attend the final study visit. 113 (29%) withdrew from the study, and 14 (3.6%) died. s for ARI; 115 in HCMC (in 102 infants) and 121 in DT (in 90 infants) corresponding to admission rates of 81 and 138 per 1000 IYO. ARI incidence was significantly lower in infants whose mothers were educated to higher secondary level or above. in the semi-rural cohort, ARI incidence was significantly lower in infants whose mothers were more highly educated. risk factor analysis considered ARI episodes detected through clinical surveillance and hospital admission records, not self-reported episodes. infants hospitalized with ARI were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit and to be treated with antibiotics compared with the group of infants admitted with other infectious diagnoses. hospitalized ARI NPS samples were collected from only 64/236 infants hospitalized with ARI. one or more viruses were detected in 45 samples (70%); 18/23 (78%) in HCMC. most common viruses were rhinovirus (33% and 41% of total positive samples in HCMC and Dong Thap, respectively) the most common viral clusters were Rhi and ENT, Rhi and Boca, and RSV and Boca. the most common viral clusters were Rhi and ENT, Rhi and Boca, and RSV and Boca. infants generally experienced more ARI episodes than younger infants. the highly clustered influenza A infections occurred almost exclusively in infants >6 months old. incidence of ARI in the 2 study sites was calculated within strata of infant age and season. in HCMC, 767 ARI episodes were diagnosed (incidence 542/1000 IYO) compared with 2354 ARI episodes (2691/1000 IYO) in DT. incidence of ARI based on episodes self-reported at follow-up visits was more similar. the risk factor analysis considered ARI episodes detected through clinical surveillance and hospital admission records. infants hospitalized with ARI were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit and to be treated with antibiotics compared with the group of infants admitted with other infectious diagnoses. a random sample of 566 NPS collected from infants with ARI were managed as outpatients. at least one respiratory virus was detected in 347 samples (61%) in HCMC, 63/119 samples (53%) were positive; in Dong Thap, 284/447 samples (64%) were positive. hospitalized ARI NPS samples were collected from only 64/236 infants hospitalized with ARI. one or more viruses were detected in 45 samples (70%); 18/23 (78%) in HCMC and 27/41 (66%) in Dong Thap. most common viruses were rhinovirus (33% and 41% of total positive samples in HCMC and Dong Thap, respectively), RSV (11% and 33%), Boca (22% and 26%), PIV3 (11% and 11%) and Flu A co-detections (2 or 3 viruses) were found in 11% and 17% of positive samples. most common viral co-infections were Rhi and ENT, followed by Rhi and Boca, and Rhi and AdV. codetections (2 or 3 viruses) were found in 17% and 22% of positive samples. most common viral clusters were Rhi and ENT, Rhi and Boca, and RSV and Boca. ARI incidence stratified by calendar quarter and age-group 6 or >6 months. older infants generally experienced more ARI episodes than younger infants. this differed between viral etiologies, but this differed between viral etiologies. the incidence of RSV infection is higher in older infants than in those 6 months,9,23. infants 6 months are at increased risk of severe disease and hospitalization. only 7/30 (23%) of outpatient ARI occurred in the first 6 months of life. this extrapolation assumes a similar pathogen distribution among the ARI episodes from which no specimen was available [293/2885 (10%) of outpatient ARI and 172/236 (73%) of inpatient ARI episodes] as among those tested. this extrapolation assumes a similar pathogen distribution among the ARI episodes from which no specimen was available. study population was drawn from women delivering at one large hospital in each study site, who may not constitute a representative cross-section of the catchment population. a range of known viral respiratory pathogens contribute to this burden, including viruses for which vaccines are available (influenza) or in development (RSV) the authors are grateful to all the cohort participants and their families, the physicians, nurses and study staff at Hung Vuong Hospital, district 8 Hospital, Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Children\u2019s Hospital No. 1 and the laboratory and support staff at OUCRU."}
