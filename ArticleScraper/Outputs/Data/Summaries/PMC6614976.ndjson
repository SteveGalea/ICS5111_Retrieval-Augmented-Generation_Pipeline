{"summary": "musk deer is essential component of Woohwangcheongsimwon as one of the representative medicinal materials for stroke treatment. there has been a growing need for an alternative of musk deer due to the restriction of its trade by convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and fauna (CITES) since 1973. musk of muskrat consists of similar ingredients with musk of musk deer. it is known that musk of muskrat contains l-muscone, a key component, and macrocyclic musk compounds like civetone, cycloheptadecanone, cyclopentadecanone, cyclododecanone, and 22 kinds of C19-C26 fatty acids, sterol compounds. rats were housed under consistent temperature (23 1\u00b0C) and humidity (55 10%) on a 12-h light/dark cycle. rats were anesthetized under 2% isoflurane in a mixture of N2O/O2. the rectal temperature was maintained at 37 0.5\u00b0C until 6 hours after ischemia with a heating lamp and blanket system. occlusion of the MCA was confirmed by the presence of characteristic behavioural deficits. rats that failed to meet these criteria were excluded from the study. the time from when the rats fell of the rotarod was measured. for each rat, latency times were recorded in five separate trials. the highest and lowest values were excluded and the mean of the remaining three trial results was used. the sections were visualised with 0.05% 3,3-diaminobenzidine solution. the sections were incubated with avidin-biotin complex reagent (Vector Laboratories, USA) for 1 h. rats were anesthetized under 2% isoflurane during the surgery. the external carotid artery (CCA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) were temporarily blocked by vascular clips. a 4-0 nylon monofilament with a round silicone head was inserted into the ECA. rats were placed on an accelerating rotarod (from 0 to 40 rpm; Ugo Basile, Milan, Italy) the time from when the rats fell of the rotarod was measured. for each rat, latency times were recorded in five separate trials. correlated infarct volume was calculated from the total volume of the contralateral hemisphere minus the unimpaired volume of the ipsilateral hemisphere. the infarct volume was calculated by dividing the correlated infarct volume with the total volume of the opposite hemisphere. musk of muskrat extended from the caudoputamen, parietal cortex, and temporal cortex to the penumbral region after MCAo. musk-treated group showed 36.691.42% of infarct volume, while musk-treated group showed 33.372.93% and 25.181.64% at 100 and 300 mg/kg. rotarod test, vehicle-treated group significantly decreased compared with sham-operated group (11.0 2.9 s vs. 78.5 4.7 s); however, rats received 300 mg/kg of musk of muskrat significantly prolonged the latency time to 25.2 3.9 s. musk of muskrat rat administered group (300 mg/kg, p.o.; C, c) boxed regions in A, B, and c (x40) shown in a, b, and c (x400), respectively. coronal sections obtained after 24 h of induction. rats that received 300 mg/kg of musk of muskrat scored higher than those in the vehicle-treated group. however, rats received 300 mg/kg of musk of muskrat significantly prolonged the latency time to 25.2 3.9 s. musk of muskrat restrained COX-2 expressions (A, B, C) in the peri-infarct cortex 24 hours after 90 minutes of MCAo. apoptosis arising in penumbra region neurons can be inhibited by neuroprotective substances. the brain infarct volume is the most important index to confirm the medicinal effects on injury of necrosis or apoptosis from focal ischemic stroke induced by MCAo model [19] musk of muskrat can inhibit neuronal damage at penumbra region, which means it could be neuroprotective substance at focal cerebral ischemia. balance beam and rotarod tests are commonly used to assess motor coordination and balance alterations following MCAo. muskrat inhibits COX-2 upregulation induced by MCAo in ipsilateral neocortex. inflammatory reaction is known as the main factor to accelerate brain damage. musk of muskrat protects neurons against focal cerebral ischemia."}
