{"summary": "2.4% of the human population, corresponding to about 160 million individuals, is infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) the vast majority are chronically infected, with sequelae that often lead to serious liver diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (42). PI4KIII associates with NS5A in infected cells (11, 44, 50, 61) by using a yeast two-hybrid approach, PI4KIII was found to interact with NS5A in a proteome-wide mapping of interactions between HCV and human proteins. two potent compounds from one of the chemotypes were used for HCV replicon resistance studies to identify regions of the HCV nonstructural proteins. extensive mouse genetic studies were performed to determine the likely effect of efficient PI4KIII inhibition in vivo. compound A and compound B were synthesized as previously described. expression, production, and purification of PI4KIII, PI4KIII, and SidC proteins. each protein was produced by infecting exponentially growing Sf21 cells. the resuspended cells were processed in a cOmplete, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablet (Roche), 1 mM Pefabloc, and 2 mM EDTA. nuclei were removed by centrifugation, and the cytosolic fraction (33 to 37 ml) was incubated on ice for 1 h with glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose 4B resin. this cycle a codon-optimized gene encoding an N-terminally truncated 39-kDa SidC protein (aa 582 to 917) was obtained from DNA2.0. two-liter cultures were inoculated with 20 ml of an overnight culture grown at 37\u00b0C. cells were resuspended in PBS and disrupted by two successive passages through a french press operated at 12,500 lb/in2 and 4\u00b0C.

Resistant ES cell colonies with distinct morphology were isolated on day 7 after transfection. chimeric mice and conditional KI mice were bred to the phiC31 recombinase gene. this allowed detection of germ line transmission by the presence of black, strain C57BL/6 offspring (G1) and creation of selection marker-deleted conditional mice. one subsequent round of breeding was required to obtain the desired homozygous Pi4ka (Cre het) animals.
