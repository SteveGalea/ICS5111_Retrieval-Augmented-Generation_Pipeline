{"summary": "environmental pollutants are increasingly documented as a driver of wildlife endangerment due to their roles in organ damage, hormonal disruption and alteration of the immune system. there is increasing concern about the impact of veterinary drugs and livestock pathogens as factors damaging wildlife health [4]\u2013[6], and even causing declines approaching extinction [7]. veterinary drugs and livestock pathogens are increasingly associated with elimination of livestock residues containing veterinary pharmaceuticals. the proximate causes of breeding failure are poorly known despite the long-term interests in the conservation of this species. the examination of failed eggs and dead nestling bearded vultures collected during recent years in the Pyrenees. this temporal decline could be related to illegal poisoning and recent changes in the abundance, distribution and quality of carrion available to avian scavengers. if the temporal decline in productivity was primarily associated with breeding failure due to the effects of habitat saturation processes [13], [17], we should expect egg and nestling mortality to be directly related to developmental and nutritional problems. three of the specimens (two nestlings and one egg) were collected from bearded vulture nests located in the Spanish Pyrenees between 2005 and 2008. the limits of quantification, percentage recoveries, and inter- and intra-assay reproducibility were adequate. other contaminants potentially affecting eggs and embryos were determined in liver, including heavy metals (Cd, Zn, Pb and Hg) for confirmation of the identification of the alpha hemolytic Streptococcus pneumoniae we used a specific identification test (Accuprobe, Salem, MA) based on the detection of specific ribosomal RNA sequences. samples of lesions found in internal organs and tissues during necropsies were taken with sterile swabs and cultured using the same standard microbiology protocols. all immunohistochemistry analyses were conducted at the Department of Veterinary Anatomy, Veterinary Faculty, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain. the presence of these viruses was also determined by PCR-based methods [43], [46]\u2013[48]. results All dead nestlings and three of five unhatched embryos showed two to six different veterinary drugs in liver (nestlings) and egg yolk (embryos) ected CA, EC, SA* (septicaemia) CH, WN Nestling* (10d) Liver EN (0.11), CI (0.06), AS (47.9) nondetected 16.24 UD, LE, BH, PK, GN, GO, MI, WP, IDb,t,p, JD IBD CA, EC IBD Embryo (prehatch) Liver egg yolk EN (0.08), CI (0.03) EN ( liver egg yolk EN (0.05), CI (0.07) EN (0.07), CI (0.04) nondetected 16.22 BH, FN, PK, GN, MI, WP, IDb,t, JD IBD SA** IBD Embryo (mid incub). Salmonella typing determined the presence of Salmonella enterica enteritidis 4, 5, 12. one individual showed infection by Salmonella enterica enteritidis and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli O86 in all examined organs (septicaemia except brain) one of the failed embryos without veterinary drugs showed suppurative myocarditis, multiple microabscesses in head muscles, suppurative leptomeningitis, and lower jaw gangrenous inflammation. both immunocytochemistry for the detection of poultry viruses and PCR pathogen survey were positive to IBDV in six individuals with fluoroquinolones. recordd drug concentrations were among the highest reported in avian scavengers [6], [ these pathogens may be acquired at the same time that drugs used to treat diseased livestock are ingested. the presence of west Nile virus is not likely to be associated with nestling disease or mortality because lack of lesions in target tissues and viral antigen particles. the presence of IBD virus on the bursa of Fabricius represents, to our knowledge, the first evidence of clinical disease compatible with death caused by this poultry virus. the presence of IBD has been not previously recorded in embryos of wild birds, probably because vertical transmission has been ruled out in poultry. this striking and concerning result could be related to the longer egg development and incubation periods of bearded vultures compared with poultry. bearded vultures primarily feed upon livestock bones, which are one of the major target tissues of fluoroquinolones in medicated animals. presence of veterinary drugs in eggs implies previous presence at least in breeding females, but also probably in breeding males and non-breeders frequently using artificial feeding sites. link between veterinary drugs and livestock disease should be further investigated in scavenger species. these processes may facilitate conspecific contact and interactions also likely to increase intra- and inter-specific pathogen transmission rates. this could be further enhanced by the artificially high numbers of bearded vultures and other scavengers attracted to feeding points and carcass refuse dumps."}
