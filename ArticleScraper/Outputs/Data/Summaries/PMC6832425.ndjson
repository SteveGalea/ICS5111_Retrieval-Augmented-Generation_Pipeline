{"summary": "positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) comprise many pathogens that are a serious threat to human health. these viruses affect millions of people worldwide and for many of them, no treatment is available. innate immune system is first line of defence against invading pathogens. active viral innate immune evasion strategies have been shown to target PRRs, downstream signalling molecules and its effector ISG products. one of the reasons why +ssRNA viruses are causing pathology in humans is probably the ability to actively evade the innate immune system. type I and type III IFNs are rapidly induced to initiate the antiviral state. the trigger for type I and III IFN production and downstream signalling molecules are actually similar for the two types [18,19]. the activation of the IFN response through TLR3, TLR7, RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) is well studied. TLR3 is activated by double-strand RNA (dsRNA) and upon activation, it will signal through TRIF (TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-) myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) pathway forms complex with interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases 1 and 4 (IRAK-4 and IRAK-1) and TRAF6. this complex activates the transcription factor IRF7 [3,23,24]. TRAF3 triggers TBK1 and IKK to phosphorylate IRF3 and IRF7. after which the transcription factors translocate to the nucleus. MDA5 is thought to trigger the same signalling cascade as RIG-I. AT2 heterodimerization is initiated after they have been phosphorylated by Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). ISGF3 is capable of binding to the IFN-stimulated response elements in the ISG promoter. NF-B regulates genes that are involved in the recruitment of innate immune cells, in the activation of the pro-inflammatory state in these cells, as well as in the activation the coronaviruses have the largest known positive-stranded RNA genome of around 30 kb with a 5\u2019-terminal cap and a poly(A) tail at the 3\u2019 end. the 5\u2019-terminal two-thirds of the genome encode two large open reading frames (ORFs), 1a and 1b. the expression of the viral genome results in the production of two polypeptides (pp1a and pp1ab) the role of interferons in coronavirus pathogenesis The IFN response is considered important for the control of coronavirus infection. IFN treatments improved the outcomes of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection in mice and in non-human primates. STAT1-/- 129 mice deficient for type I, II and III IFN signalling were more susceptible to a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rMA15) and the SARS-CoV Urbani strain. the replication of SARS-CoV in the lungs was enhanced, and in double-knockout mice, the viral titres in the lungs were even further increased. transduced myD88-/- and MAVS-/- mice were infected with MERS-CoV. this resulted in considerable weight loss in the myD88-/- group. innate immune response and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been considered as possible contributors to the pathology of SARS. a dysregulated and/or delayed IFN response is at least partly responsible for the pathology of SARS and MERS. a dysregulated and/or delayed IFN response seems to be contributing simultaneously to protection against viruses and to the pathology induced by the same virus infections. in vitro, MERS-CoV is more sensitive to IFN and IFN treatment than SARS-CoV. this suggests that SARS-CoV is more effective in evading the innate immune response. chimeric mouse hepatitis virus was able to replicate to titres equivalent to those of the wild-type virus in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. chimeric virus was able to replicate to titres equivalent to those of the wild-type virus in RNase L/ BMM and RNase L/ mice. nsp3 of coronaviruses encodes a macrodomain which functions as aDP-ribose-1\u2032-phosphatase. nsp3 of coronaviruses encodes a macrodomain which functions as aDP-ribose-1\u2032-phosphatase. many of the coronavirus nsps have been implicated in the evasion of innate immunity. ubiquitination is a posttranslational modification that is very important in the regulation of innate immune pathways. transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 showed significantly increased survival compared to wt virus-infected mice. the levels of IFN, IFN and several ISGs and pro-inflammatory cytokines were found to be upregulated at an earlier time point. a nsp16 mutant lacking 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity showed attenuated replication in primary human epithelial cells and in 288\u2013330+/+ mice. this could be attributed to increased recognition by innate immunity, which is supported by an increased sensitivity of the nsp16 mutant to type I IFNs in vitro. the lungs of mice infected with MA15 showed increased expression of ISGs (ISG15, MX1) and decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and CCL2. this study supports a view in which a dysregulated IFN response and increased inflammation (partly) due to immune evasive activities of the virus are responsible for the lung pathology observed during coronavirus infection. proteases into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) the nsps are involved in the replication of the viral genome. the remaining one-third of the genome encodes the viral structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) and accessory proteins. the accessory genes have also been implicated in antagonizing the IFN response. a trial to study the efficacy of IFN1b in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir in MERS patients is still ongoing. the expression levels of IFN during the disease course do suggest that IFN is important. in two studies with SARS patients, no expression of IFN was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from the patients. IFNAR1-/-, IFNLR1-/-/IFNLR1-/- (double-knockout) mice [57] showed no difference in clinical outcome compared to wild-type (wt) SARS-CoV-infected mice. STAT1-/- mice showed signs of disease and decreased survival. this would suggest that the increased replication of SARS-CoV is not directly related to pathology and disease outcome. high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and IFN were detected in the sera of SARS patients. high expression levels of ISGs such as CD58, IFNAR1 and IFNGR1 (interferon gamma receptor 1) and of the chemokines CXCL10 and IL-8 were correlated with disease severity. deDiego et al. showed that the inhibition of NF-B resulted in reduced inflammation and lung pathology in mice that were infected with MA15. a dysregulated and/or delayed IFN response is at least partly responsible for the pathology of SARS and MERS. the pathogenesis caused by the SARS-CoV E protein is connected to its ion channel (IC) activity. the accessory genes 3b and 6 of SARS-CoV have been implicated in antagonizing the IFN pathway. other accessory genes still have unknown functions. chimeric virus was able to replicate to titres equivalent to those of the wild-type virus in RNase L/ BMM and RNase L/ mice. this indicates that MERS-CoV counteracts the RNaseL pathway, an interferon-induced antiviral pathway, and thereby enhances viral replication. this difference between the viruses might not be completely surprising, since there is no sequence homology between the accessory genes. ase. fehr et al. created mutants lacking macrodomain activity. mice did not develop lung pathology after infection with viruses lacking macrodomain activity. nsp3 also contains a papain-like protease (PLpro). the late induction of the innate immune response in wt virus-infected mice reached an out-of-control high level. this suggests that the resulting early and balanced immune response is important for controlling the infection. this indicates that the DUB activity of nsp3 is a major contributor to the pathology of coronavirus infections. uated replication in primary human airway epithelial cells and in 288\u2013330+/+ mice. this could be attributed to increased recognition by innate immunity. nsp16 mutation in a highly lethal mouse-adapted MERS-CoV rescued the mice. alphaviruses have a genome of around 12kb containing a 5\u2019-terminal cap and a 3\u2019-terminal poly(A) tail. the genome consists of two ORFs; the 5\u2019-terminal ORF encodes the nonstructural proteins, and the 3\u2019-terminal ORF encodes the structural proteins. the structural proteins are expressed from a subgenomic promoter (SGP) a common expression profile of IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines was found during the acute phase of CHIKV infection. treatment with IFN before infecting mice with CHIKV decreased viremia and disease signs. however, treating the mice on day 3 during the infection did not result in a therapeutic effect. the role of innate immunity in CHIKV infection has been extensively studied in experimental animal models. high levels of type I IFN were expressed in wt and TLR3-/- fibroblasts. this suggests other PRRs activate the IFN response. wt mice did not produce detectable protein levels of type I IFN during infection. wt mice infected with CHIKV survived, and only small increases in viral load were observed. CHIKV is thought to evade innate immune responses by causing a transcriptional and translational shut-off in the host cells [109]. adaptive immunity has also been shown to contribute to the control of CHIKV infection. wt and EV CHIKV showed a delayed induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared to wt CHIKV. this also correlated with locally increased IFN/ and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines levels 15 h post infection. chikungunya virus is an alphavirus, member of the togaviridae family. kb contains a 5\u2019-terminal cap and a 3\u2019-terminal poly(A) tail. two polyproteins are produced which are cleaved by viral proteases into four nonstructural proteins (nsP) and five structural proteins (C, E3, E2, 6K, E1) the structural proteins are expressed from a subgenomic RNA. a common expression profile of IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines was found during the acute phase of CHIKV infection. treatment with IFN before infecting mice with CHIKV decreased viremia and disease signs. this suggests that during the acute phase, the antiviral response is activated by CHIKV and is involved in controlling CHIKV infection. the role of innate immunity in CHIKV infection has been extensively studied in experimental animal models. primary fibroblasts isolated from wt and TLR3-/- mice showed that the replication of CHIKV was increased in the TLR3-/- cells. this suggests that other PRRs activate the IFN response, although this was not sufficient to control replication. 88-/- mice infected with CHIKV survived, and only small increases in viral load in their sera or tissues were observed. the results together probably indicate several PRRs are involved in sensing CHIKV and that missing one of the receptors is not sufficient to induce a lethal phenotype. chikungunya infection triggers IFN and ISG mRNA production. no protein is expressed during infection, illustrating that CHIKV blocks host cell translation. nsP2 of CHIKV is thought to be involved in mediating host shut-off. wt and EV CHIKV showed increased viremia and joint inflammation compared to wt. wt and EV CHIKV showed a delayed induction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines compared to the RH and RHEV virus. a dysregulated innate immune response, inflicted by viral immune evasion activities, might contribute to pathology. both ZIKV and DENV are transmitted by the Aedes mosquito. flaviviruses have a genome of around 11 kb containing a 5\u2019-terminal cap. the genome encodes one large polyprotein processed by viral and host proteases into the three structural proteins. patients with moderate symptoms and viremia had higher levels of IL-1RA, CCL2, CXCL10 and IL-8 than patients with mild symptoms or no viremia. severe cases of dengue with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF, anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and chemokines including IL-8 and CXCL10 have been reported. three-week-old AG129 mice are deficient in type I and II IFN signalling. no significant differences in mortality rate, weight loss and organ viral titres were found. this indicates that especially the type I IFN response is important in controlling ZIKV infection. mice lacking IFNAR1, MAVS, IRF3 or IRF3/5/7 were infected with ZIKV. the viral load was positively correlated with the induction of IRF7. mice lacking the MAVS adapter showed no signs of disease or mortality. a trans-placental transmission mouse model of ZIKV has been developed by knocking out IFNAR1. the results on the role of type I IFNs in ZIKV pathogenesis during pregnancy are conflicting. the results on the role of type I IFNs in ZIKV pathogenesis during pregnancy are conflicting. blocking antibody also resulted in growth retardation, although to a lesser extent than in the IFNAR1+/- foetuses. the authors also examined the effect of a treatment with recombinant IFN and IFN3 on human villous isolated from mid-gestation placentas. 3D-cultured cells became less susceptible to ZIKV, while expressing high basal levels of IFN1/2 and ISGs. human placental villi isolated from second-trimester placentas were also capable of producing IFN1. IFNAR-/- pregnant mice with type III IFNs at E10.5 prevented foetal demise and improved foetal growth. both studies found no beneficial effect of IFN treatment early during pregnancy. NS1 of DENV has been shown to increase pathogenesis in mice. the flavivirus NS2B3 complex serves as a protease and can cleave human STING in vitro. it is thought to inhibit the antiviral immune response and to support viral replication. however, NS2B3 might still target other signalling molecules. Xia et al. infected mice with two strains of ZIKV and with two mutant viruses. NS1 showed significantly higher levels of IFN in the sera of infected animals. but the survival of neonatal CD-1 mice infected with a mutant virus was not significantly different compared to the survival of wt-infected mice. flaviviruses have a genome of around 11 kb containing a 5\u2019-terminal cap. the genome encodes one large polyprotein that is processed by viral and host proteases into the three structural proteins (E, C and prM) and the seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5) severe cases of dengue with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF, anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and chemokines including IL-8 and CXCL10 have been reported. cytokine storm in dengue patients can lead to plasma leakage and haemorrhage seen in severe Dengue cases. no significant differences in mortality rate, weight loss and organ viral titres were found between the A129 and the AG129 mice [126]. this indicates that especially the type I IFN response is important in controlling ZIKV infection in adults and could possibly explain age-dependent mortality in A129 mice. mice lacking IFNAR1, MAVS, IRF3 or IRF3/5/7 were inoculated with ZIKV. wt mice showed no morbidity or mortality, though the virus was detected in the blood and tissues. a trans-placental transmission mouse model of ZIKV has been developed by knocking out IFNAR1. the study suggests the presence of IFN signalling in the foetuses and placenta had a protective effect. the rest of the IFNAR1+/- foetuses exhibited intrauterine growth retardation. IFNAR1-/- foetuses showed reduced intrauterine growth retardation compared to the IFNAR1+/- foetuses. recombinant IFN treatment resulted in abnormal villous structures, while IFN treatment did not influence the villi. human placental villi, foetal membranes and decidua basalis all responded to IFN1 and IFN3 treatment by inducing ISGs such as OAS1 and reduced ZIKV titres. a second study also showed the beneficial effects of IFN2 treatment. both studies found no beneficial effect of IFN treatment early during pregnancy. NS1 of DENV has been shown to increase pathogenesis in mice. sublethal doses of DENV2 in combination with recombinant NS1 resulted in lethality. mice deficient in STING (Tmem173Gt) did not respond any differently to ZIKV infection. NS2B3 may still target other signalling molecules to interfere with the innate immune response. the inflammasome can decrease the IFN response and support viral replication. infected mice with the two strains of ZIKV and with two mutant viruses showed significantly higher levels of IFN in the sera of infected animals. however, the survival of neonatal CD-1 mice infected with a mutant virus was not significantly different compared to the survival of wt-infected mice. authors demonstrated that NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, NS4B and NS5 were able to suppress IFN in vitro. the role of type III IFN in other viral infections is therefore of great interest. as we gain more knowledge on the interaction between innate immunity and viral infection, possibilities for the development of novel treatments and prevention strategies might appear on the horizon."}
