{"summary": "MSS is not constrained by priori knowledge of which pathogens might be present. it is tolerant to sequence variation that could cause targeted molecular tests to fail. in addition to pathogen detection, MSS provides information about clinically relevant genomic features. samples were selected to represent a broad range of viruses detected in a diagnostic laboratory based in an academic referral hospital. the samples were selected to represent a broad range of viruses detected in a diagnostic laboratory based in an academic referral hospital. SV-1 Eragen ASR 30.8 Enterovirus, Toxoplasma gondii, EBV 3 NP Influenza B virus RVP NA None 4 Urine BKPyV LDT 16.9 None 5 Plasma HHV-6 LDT NA Adenovirus, CMV, HSV, EBV HPV 128 6 CSF JCPyV LDT NA VZV, HSV, CMV, EBV, Toxoplasma gondii HIV-1 7 NP known TTMV 13 26 Skin scraping VZV vaccine strain LDT 30.2 Unknown TTMV a Abbreviations: NP, nasopharyngeal; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; TA, tracheal aspirate; LDT, laboratory-developed test; ASR, analyte-specific reagent; RVP, respiratory virus panel; HSV, herpes simplex virus; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; total nucleic acid was eluted in 70 l of elution buffer. for whole blood, 200 l of blood was combined with 2 ml of lysis buffer. 100 l of silica from the easyMAG instrument was then added to the sample. dual-indexed sequencing libraries were constructed with the Swift Biosciences Accel NGS-2S library kit. the first portion was sequenced directly on one lane on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument. the second portion was subjected to targeted sequence capture with ViroCap (19) prior to sequencing on a second lane on the Illumina instrument. the threshold number of reads for the virus was subtracted from the raw observed number of reads to establish the reported number of sequence reads. single-nucleotide variants in the HIV-1, influenza A virus, and herpesvirus genomes were identified using VarScan2 (25, 26) the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine strain was distinguished based on genomic features described by Loparev et al. (35). Sequencing results were confirmed using virus-specific PCR assays (8, 35). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA was measured using the PCR assay described by Wandinger et al. (36). coverage is the per-position redundancy in sequence reads that align to the genome, and the mean is the average depth calculated across each base of the reference genome. analysis of the difference in percentage of viral reads, breadth of coverage (percent) and mean depth of coverage between MSS without and with targeted sequence capture was analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. the most common virus group detected only by sequencing was anelloviruses (n = 10), followed by human papillomavirus (n = 8) the anelloviruses included 5 alphatorqueviruses (torque teno virus [TTV]), 3 betatorqueviruses (torque teno minivirus [TTMV]), and 2 gammatorqueviruses (tTMDV) a negative sample from the diagnostic virology laboratory (sample 14) had been submitted for molecular testing for Ehrlichia and Anaplasma. the other negative sample had been negative for those agents but had not been tested for viruses. sequencing results revealed no viral sequences with standard MSS and 9 sequence reads corresponding to EBV with ViroCap enrichment. the sequence of the influenza A virus neuraminidase gene indicated that the virus was susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. the sequence of the gene encoding the matrix 2 protein indicated that the virus was susceptible to adamantanes. the HSV-1 genome was typed as subtype 4g but was divergent from the HCV references in the NCBI nucleotide database. the two largest assembled contigs matching at 85 to 87% nucleotide identity over their lengths compared with the most similar virus. the virus had sufficient sequence coverage of the reverse transcriptase-, integrase-, and protease-coding sequences to assess resistance to each of these classes. we did not have sequence coverage of the cytomegalovirus UL54 or UL97 genes. we could not assess drug resistance in those genomes. we detected 10 enterovirus D68 sequence reads without capture and approximately 2,000 reads with capture in 4 samples (5, 6, 9, and 10 sequences) and a single rotavirus read in 1 sample with capture (11 sequences) the presence of the viruses was not confirmed on the newly extracted nucleic acid. ViroCap contains approximately 2 million capture probes that span the genomes of all vertebrate viruses known at the time the reagent was synthesized in 2014. standard MSS increased the yield of viruses detected by 75% over that obtained by standard clinical testing due to the ability of sequencing to broadly detect viruses not specifically included in requested clinical tests. the addition of ViroCap increased the yield of viruses detected by an additional 50% over standard clinical testing. the HRV-C was detected both without and with ViroCap. it is possible that HRV-C was not detected by the multiplex panel. HHV-7 is commonly detected in human samples, usually in the absence of disease manifestations. ViroCap can enrich anelloviruses with as little as 58% nucleotide sequence identity to the included capture probes. the second most common family of viruses detected by MSS was papillomaviruses. each sample contained a different type of papillomavirus. in the cases of enterovirus D68 and rotavirus, the suspicion of contamination was heightened because work with these viruses had been done previously in our laboratory. in the case of VZV, we suspect contamination because VZV was found in 3 different samples and not confirmed by virus-specific PCR. in the 2 samples in which VZV was detected, the confirmatory virus-specific PCR assay was positive. the cost of capture probes could be prohibitive if only a few samples were assayed. metagenomic sequencing has the capability to bring about a paradigm shift in diagnostic virology. challenges include the significance of viruses that are not known to be pathogenic."}
