{"summary": "NVAC review considers findings of a parallel, separate mid-course review of the status of the National Vaccine Plan commissioned by the National Vaccine Program Office (NVPO) in august 2015 that included a broad stakeholder engagement process. NVAC supports the NVPO mid-course Review report findings and its focus on the following 5 priority opportunity areas for advancing US vaccine and immunization efforts. the NVAC recommends the development of new indicators to improve tracking and analysis. the ASH should charge the NVPO to develop and validate new indicators within each of the 5 opportunity areas to ensure improved tracking of goals. the new indicators should include one that will track and report on US government annual investments in vaccine innovation. national Vaccine Advisory Committee chair Kimberly M.

Yvonne Maldonado, MD, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA Nathaniel Smith, MD, MPH, Arkansas Department of Health, Little Rock a 2013 study estimated that routine childhood immunizations prevented 322 million illnesses and averted 732 000 premature deaths from vaccine-preventable illnesses in children born between 1994 and 2013. a 2016 study reported investments in immunization in low- and middle-income countries for 2011-2020 will yield an estimated return of approximately 16 times the cost. the 2010 national Vaccine plan provides strategic direction for all US vaccine- and immunization-related activities. the national Vaccine plan defines the 5 goals by providing additional supporting objectives and strategies. however, the national Vaccine Implementation Plan recognizes the need to incorporate flexibility that allows the plan to adapt to changes in vaccination technologies and health care delivery models. the NVPO report does not replace the National Vaccine Plan. NVPO report identifies 9 consensus opportunity areas that 3 focus groups ranked according to priority (Table 1). these opportunity areas included: (1) strengthen health information and surveillance systems to track, analyze, and visualize disease, immunization coverage, and safety data. Vaccine Program (adapted from the NVPO Mid-course Review of the 2010 National Vaccine Plan) 2015a Opportunity Area Rank Strengthen health information and surveillance systems to track, analyze, and visualize disease, immunization coverage, and safety data, both domestically and globally. the NVAC agrees with the identification and prioritization of opportunity areas in the NVPO report. the NVAC also agrees that the top 5 most highly ranked opportunity areas correctly represent activities likely to yield the greatest impact during the next 5 years. the NVAC recognizes that individual participants in focus groups may introduce bias and the results may not be representative. the NVAC also acknowledges that individual participants in focus groups may introduce bias and the results may not be representative. NVPO report1 recognizes that the use of health information systems represents the greatest opportunity to significantly advance the goals of the National Vaccine Plan over the coming years. a number of efforts at both the federal and nonfederal levels include addressing barriers to interoperability and use of IISs. the lack of standards for data submission across EHRs and electronic laboratory reporting systems remains a significant barrier to collecting automated data for nationwide surveillance. the lack of standards for data submission across EHRs and electronic laboratory reporting systems remains a significant barrier to collecting automated data. the NVAC summarized characteristics for near-term success and challenges to achieve this success for opportunity area 1. the 2015 Opportunity Area Characteristics of near-term success in this Opportunity Area Challenges in Achieving That Success 1.

NVAC notes lack of standardized indicators and challenges faced by the GVAP in the development of appropriate indicators. this report includes the GVAP indicators on vaccine hesitancy, while emphasizing the need to create a framework for better understanding of vaccine confidence globally. the impact of home-schooled children remains unknown, but unvaccinated- and undervaccinated individuals may cluster and contribute to outbreaks. nonmedical exemptions may also reduce coverage without requiring caregiver education on the risks of children remaining unvaccinated. the Affordable Care Act expands health insurance coverage and access to preventive services, including immunization. it provides insurance to more than 16.4 million previously uninsured people in the united states as of August 2016. as of early 2017, its future remains uncertain. the NVAC agrees with the indicators for this opportunity area in the NVPO report1. the NVAC also includes a GVAP indicator that tracks vaccination coverage targets. the NVAC proposes the development of 2 additional indicators for this opportunity area. the NVAC recognizes the need to monitor how changing models of compensation affect the immunization neighborhood. some communities, especially rural ones, continue to experience missed opportunities for immunization. state-to-state variability in immunization policies and practices further increases complexity in the current system. the NVAC defines success as making scientific breakthroughs that result in vaccine candidates for pathogens with historically unsuccessful development pathways, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and several priority antibiotic-resistant pathogens. the NVAC recognizes the importance of improving knowledge about the correlates of protection for vaccine development. the NVAC recognizes the need to better understand the drivers of vaccine innovation and development and how to best support them. barriers to vaccine development may include the lack of mechanisms to incentivize or support higher-risk vaccine research and investments by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. the NVAC suggests retrospective case studies or prospective studies to follow new product launches and the uptake of incremental products. the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak and the 2016 Zika outbreak underscore the importance of the robustness of the vaccine development pipeline in the united states. the NVPO report1 combines the indicators for opportunity areas 4 and 5 because \"they speak to different challenges for the same issue: vaccine development\" the NVAC recognizes that tracking the total amount of funding toward specific scientific questions may not always translate into a direct path for the development of new vaccine candidates. NVPO report1 provides 3 indicators for opportunity areas 4 and 5 that focus on later-stage vaccine development. the NVAC proposes the development of a domestic indicator for opportunity area 4 to improve tracking of vaccine R&D funding, vaccine delivery and administration, vaccine thermostability, and US technical readiness to respond to emerging infectious disease threats. the NVPO indicator is limited to clinical-stage vaccines aimed at protecting against HIV, malaria, TB, RSV, and enteric pathogens (eg, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Shigella, and norovirus) the WHO intends to update the pipeline tracker every 6 months and expand beyond these vaccine targets. the NVAC recognizes that innovation in these areas is critically important to facilitate access and efficient delivery of safe and effective vaccines. the NVPO report1 supports the development of the strategic multi-attribute ranking tool for Vaccines66 (SMART-Vaccines) but a formal list of priority targets does not exist. the NVAC proposes using existing prioritization lists to inform the selection of vaccine targets and to measure the robustness and diversity of the vaccine development pipeline. the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases provides a list of emerging infectious disease pathogens considered priority pathogens. their categorization depends on their threat to public health and their ability to disseminate widely to the public. the overlap of pathogens from each of the different prioritization lists was constructed based on following inclusion criteria. h virus X X X Non-typhoidal salmonella disease X X Norovirus X X Respiratory syncytial virus X X Shigella X X X Streptococcus pneumoniae X X X Tuberculosis X X X X Universal influenza vaccine X X Ebola virus X Zika virus. the NVPO report1 recognizes that the use of health information systems represents the greatest opportunity to significantly advance the goals of the National Vaccine Plan over the coming years. a number of efforts at both the federal and nonfederal levels include addressing barriers to interoperability and use of IISs. a 2014 NVAC report encourages federal partners to identify ways to optimize the use of EHR and IIS data for monitoring and surveillance of vaccination coverage and vaccine safety for mother-infant pairs. the lack of standards for data submission across EHRs and electronic laboratory reporting systems remains a significant barrier to collecting automated data for nationwide surveillance. national Vaccine Advisory Committee characteristics of near-term success and potential challenges in opportunity areas for advancing vaccine and immunization efforts in the united states. interoperable IISs across all states and territories Bidirectional, real-time exchange of data between all IISs and all EHRs. tric age groups Continued undervaccination of adults and adult skepticism about the need for immunizations across the lifespan Need for consistent and reliable methods to communicate with the public about the importance of vaccines.

Strengthen the science base for the development and licensure of vaccines. the NVAC continues to strongly encourage efforts to integrate health information technologies that facilitate quality data collection domestically and globally. the success of implementing routine vaccine schedules and the result of significant reductions in incidence continues to reduce the visibility of vaccine-preventable diseases. even small increases in concerns about vaccination may result in decreasing vaccination rates, delays in receipt of immunizations, and the accumulation of populations of susceptible individuals within US communities. measles outbreaks in the united states continue to cause significant morbidity and lead to substantial costs for control. pathway to leadership for adult immunization,34 highlights lack of a \"coordinated public health infrastructure\" NVAC emphasizes the need to further improve adult immunization. some studies document misperceptions about vaccine safety and the effectiveness and benefits of vaccination. the NVPO report includes this objective as its only indicator for this opportunity area. this indicator does not reflect geographic variations or factors that lead to unvaccinated children. the NVAC recognizes that this indicator may provide indirect evidence about nationwide trends in vaccine confidence. 2015 exemption rates among kindergarteners in California motivate the NVAC to suggest the potential use of personal belief exemption rates as an indicator for measuring vaccine confidence. however, states may not collect information about exemptions in a standardized way, which limits generalizability. the NVPO report includes this objective as its only indicator for this opportunity area. this indicator does not reflect geographic variations or factors that lead to unvaccinated children. the NVAC notes the lack of standardized indicators and challenges faced by the GVAP in the development of appropriate indicators. the 2014-2015 measles outbreak in California included a relatively high fraction of intentionally unvaccinated individuals. the NVAC suggests the potential use of personal belief exemption rates as an indicator for measuring vaccine confidence. the NVAC recognizes that keeping apprised of this information could inform the development and testing of strategies to improve vaccine confidence. the NVAC appreciates the need to improve vaccination coverage across the lifespan by addressing access and financing issues that prevent patients from receiving recommended vaccines. multiple studies show patients are much more likely to receive vaccinations if their providers offer them at the time of their health care visit. offering immunization services in the office requires upfront investments by providers, including the cost to purchase vaccine products and equipment for proper storage and handling. these potentially significant costs factor into the decision by providers to offer certain vaccines. additional considerations for opportunity area 3 The NVAC suggests federal and state payers should increase their efforts to better align payment policies with public health priorities. Vaccination provides a well-recognized, cost-effective, and often cost-saving prevention strategy that yields significant benefits for pediatric and adolescent populations domestically4 and globally5. NVAC proposes the development of 2 additional indicators for this opportunity area. additional considerations for opportunity area 3 The NVAC suggests federal and state payers should increase their efforts to better align payment policies with public health priorities. Vaccination provides a well-recognized, cost-effective prevention strategy that yields significant benefits for pediatric and adolescent populations domestically4 and globally5. en the Science Base for the development and Licensure of Vaccines The world lacks vaccines against many infectious diseases that impact public health. this opportunity area aims at the development and licensure of new and improved vaccines to meet ongoing, emerging, and/or unmet public health needs. the NVAC emphasizes the need to identify appropriate mechanisms that will encourage data sharing among investigators. NVAC defines success as making scientific breakthroughs that result in vaccine candidates for pathogens with historically unsuccessful development pathways, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and several priority antibiotic-resistant pathogens. additional considerations for opportunity area 4 New technologies continue to increase our knowledge and understanding of immune responses. the NVAC recognizes the need to better understand the drivers of vaccine innovation and development and how to best support them. obstacles may include the lack of mechanisms to incentivize or support higher-risk vaccine research and investments by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. the NVAC suggests retrospective case studies or prospective studies to follow new product launches and the uptake of incremental products. the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak and the 2016 Zika outbreak underscore the importance of the robustness of the vaccine development pipeline in the united states. manufacturers often choose between continuing vaccine development or focusing on products with a more certain return on investment. lower vaccine prices impact investments in vaccine manufacturing and result in higher probability of vaccine shortages due to manufacturing problems. the NVAC notes the general unpredictability of steps forward in scientific knowledge and how they translate into returns on investment. the NVAC does not expect indicators based on the number of peer-reviewed journal articles on vaccine science would necessarily provide an accurate indicator of scientific advances that could lead to new vaccine development. the NVAC also proposes to expand tracking of clinical-stage vaccines included in the NVPO report1 (indicator 2) to clinical phases beyond phase 1 and to include a broader range of priority pathogens than the 4 cited in the NVPO indicator. the NVAC intends to update the pipeline tracker every 6 months and expand beyond these vaccine targets. the NVAC recognizes innovation in these areas as critically important to facilitate access and efficient delivery of safe and effective vaccines. tracking the clinical-stage pipeline of vaccine candidates can occur with limited ongoing efforts due to the relatively slow pace of vaccine development. establishing a consensus on a limited list of priority vaccine targets to track remains challenging. the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases provides a list of emerging infectious disease pathogens considered priority pathogens. pathogens on this list include emerging infectious disease threats as well as pathogens potentially used as bioweapons. their categorization depends on their threat to public health (and to national health security) ichia coli X X X Enterovirus 71 X X Group B streptococcus X X Malaria X X MERS-CoV X X Neisseria gonorrhoeae Urgent Nipah virus X X Non-typhoidal salmonella disease X X Norovirus X Respiratory syncytial virus X X Shigella X X X Sta NVPO report1 combines the indicators for opportunity areas 4 and 5. the NVAC recognizes that indicators to benchmark scientific progress remain very difficult to define. the NVAC notes the general unpredictability of steps forward in scientific knowledge. the NVAC proposes 4 global indicators developed by the GVAP. the NVAC proposes the development of a domestic indicator for opportunity area 4. the NVAC recommends that the NVPO begin a process to define and develop a validated indicator for estimating vaccine R&D funding across all US government agencies. the NVPO may benefit from review of inclusion and exclusion criteria used for the WHO pipeline tracker or by commercial services that track product development. pipeline tracking should provide valuable information about the number of candidates entering clinical development and pressure points in the pipeline. investments in innovation should include new platforms for the efficient presentation of antigens (eg, new vectors, nanoparticle technologies) the WHO Product Development for Vaccines Advisory Committee recently published recommendations focusing on a list of 24 pathogens of high public health importance. the pathogens included in this analysis represent targets with candidates previously identified as priority development targets by the GVAP9 and others. future activities by this committee will include focusing on targets that represent a significant unmet public health need. pathogens in the CDC 2013 report include pathogens in the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases list. list includes priority pathogens in the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases list. pathogens already included in the WHO Pipeline tracking tool. potential target vaccine candidates represent just one example of how US government agencies may approach developing a list of target pathogens. the NVAC believes further efforts should seek to prioritize investments in innovation for vaccines for established pathogens with no vaccines. the NVAC recommends that the ASH continue to support and integrate global immunization efforts into the 5 opportunity areas highlighted in this review. the NVAC believes that strengthening immunization systems throughout the world will improve access to safe and effective vaccines and, ultimately, protect the US population from travel-related exposure. the NVAC hopes this report will serve as a useful tool in refining our collective strategies for shaping the future of the US immunization enterprise. the NVPO should continue to implement the recommendations from previous NVAC reports, such as the 2015 NVAC report Assessing the state of vaccination in the united states. the ASH should charge the NVPO to develop the 2020 national Vaccine plan. it should incorporate the findings in this report and consider the impact of health care disparities on implementation and achievement of the objectives of the 2020 plan."}
