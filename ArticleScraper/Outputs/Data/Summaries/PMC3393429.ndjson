{"summary": "inTRODUCTION RNA interference (RNAi) is a sequence-specific gene silencing process. RNAi is mediated by a small interfering RNA (siRNA) comprised of a 19- to 26-nucleotide (nt) RNA duplex. recognition of target RNA by an siRNA conjugated with an RNA-induced silencing complex triggers the catalytic degradation of complementary target RNA (8). CVB3 infection can be life threatening due to the risk of heart failure. no vaccines or antiviral agents are currently available. no vaccines or antiviral agents are currently available. we developed 3p-siRNAs specific to CVB3 in a viral myocarditis model. to analyze their potentials as antiviral agents, we generated 3p-siRNAs with (3p-siRNAs) and without (OH-siRNAs) a 5\u2032-triphosphate and compared their antiviral potencies in vitro and in vivo. three siRNAs targeting the CVB3 region were designed using the CAPSID software program (26) OH-siRNAs with a hydroxyl group at the 5\u2032 end were manufactured by Bioneer using the \u201cready-to-use\u201d option. 3p-siRNAs with a triphosphate group at the 5\u2032 end were purchased from Genolution using the \u201cready-to-use\u201d option. the RT products were amplified using a GeneRacer-specific sense primer (5\u2032RACE-S1; 5\u2032-CGA CTG GAG CAC GAC ACT G-3\u2032) a second round of nested PCR was conducted using a GeneRacer-specific nested sense primer (#5-AS1; 5\u2032-ATG AGC CCA CCA CAC TGG-3\u2032) viral doses of 8 105 PFU/200 l were injected intraperitoneally. mice were sacrificed on days 7 and 14 after siRNA administration. the heart, pancreas, liver, and spleen were harvested.

PCR products are indicated by an arrow (b) and were further analyzed by sequencing (c). the antiviral activities of CVB3-specific siRNAs were investigated in vitro. infected cells began to exhibit irreversible cytopathic effects as early as 6 h postinfection. progeny virus production reached its maximum level within 8 h p.i. antiviral activities following these siRNA treatments lasted up to 48 h. results demonstrate that antiviral potency can be significantly enhanced by modifying CVB3-specific siRNA to a form containing 5\u2032-triphosphate. effective attenuation of CVB3 infection following CVB3-specific 3p-siRNA treatment in vivo. the viral genome was quantified on day 7 (c) (n = 12) and day 14 (d) (n = 6) using RT-PCR. Means SD are shown (***, P 0.001). Progeny virus production was greatly decreased, up to a two-log reduction, in the hearts of the CVB3-specific 3p-siRNA group on day 7 (3.9 0.5 in log10 TCID/g) iRNA (3p-#5, 0.6 0.5) treatment attenuated inflammation, and it was statistically superior to nonspecific 3p-siRNA, particularly at day 7 (3p-C, 1.5 1.3) a dense deposit of VP1 was readily observed in sporadic patterns on day 7 p.i. siRNA treatment by examining the influence of siRNA on body weight and liver toxicity. all the mice survived the experimental procedure very well. body weight increased continuously at similar rates in the siRNA-treated groups. PCR products were amplified from the cleaved CVB3 genome. cleavage occurred between positions 10 and 11 of the antisense strand of siRNA. IFN- and 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) cells were transfected with 3p-siRNAs (3p-C and 3p-#5) regardless of viral specificity. we detected no induction of IFN- or OAS expression with OH-siRNAs. these data suggest that CVB3-specific 3p-siRNA induces a target-specific gene silencing activity and it also elicits the most improved antiviral effects were observed in the presence of the CVB3-specific 3p-siRNA by increasing IFN- mRNA expression in human MRC5 cells. the 3p-siRNAs retained some degree of protective effect even after CIP treatment. the control 3p-siRNA lost most of its antiviral effect. OH-siRNA groups lost body weight with kinetics in initial weight loss. body weight was monitored every 2 days (a) (n 6 for each group) the viral genome was quantified on day 7 (c) (n = 12) and day 14 (d) (n = 6). 3p-siRNA treatments rapidly induced type I IFN-related gene expressions in hearts. these results suggest that CVB3-specific 3p-siRNA has dual effects and effectively attenuates pathological effects in vivo. Enhanced protective effects on heart inflammation and fibrosis by CVB3-specific 3p-siRNA treatment. mice were sacrificed on day 7 or 14 following virus and siRNA treatment. sections were stained with H&E, treated with Sirius red, and immunohistochemically stained using virus-specific VP1 antibody (a) no obvious toxicity with 3p-siRNA treatment. DISCUSSION This study demonstrated that CVB3-specific 3p-siRNA was highly effective in inhibiting viral replication. enhanced protective potency was due to the combined effects of 2 distinct mechanisms. clinical trials validating the usefulness of siRNA-based therapeutics have been applied to diverse human diseases. a major concern with most siRNA treatments is the possibility of oversaturation of the RISC by exogenous siRNA. a major concern with most siRNA treatments is the possibility of oversaturation of the RISC by exogenous siRNA. the high-level expression of short-hairpin RNAs overwhelmed the hepatic RNAi processing machinery. such side effects become more severe as the siRNA concentration increases. therefore, the CVB3-specific 3p-RNA strategy provides additional benefits because of the lower effective dosage of siRNA. a 1/10 concentration of 3p-siRNA activated a much higher level of IFN pathway activity in vitro than was seen with synthetic IFN. thus, a small amount of 3p-siRNA elicited a large amount of IFN synthesis, thereby producing effective antiviral effects with fewer side effects. toxicity studies indicated no obvious changes in morbidity or liver toxicity following 3p-siRNA treatment.
