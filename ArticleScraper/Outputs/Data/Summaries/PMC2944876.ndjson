{"summary": "standard epidemiological theory claims that in structured populations competition between multiple pathogen strains is a deterministic process which is mediated by the basic reproduction number () of the individual strains. a new theory based on analysis, simulation and empirical study challenges this predictor of success. antigenically-variable pathogens are responsible for much of the burden of communicable disease in the world today. emergence of a swine \u2018flu (H1N1 2009) with human-to-human transmission capability has re-focussed attention on this issue. in structured populations, is defined as (1) where the function is the infectious net-reproductive function. it is an \u201cinfectious age\u201d-dependent function that defines the rate at which an infected host generates secondary infections in the time interval following its initial infection. the measure of selective advantage given by equation 2 implicitly assumes that the population is infinite \u2013 a mathematical idealisation. evolutionary entropy describes the rate at which the population returns to its steady state condition after a random perturbation in age-specific fecundity and mortality variables. the statistical measure evolutionary entropy describes the rate at which the population returns to its steady state condition after a random perturbation in age-specific fecundity and mortality variables. selective advantage in the case of competing strains involves S and two additional macroscopic variables. selective advantage is now [20] given by (4) Here N denotes the population size of infectives and is the relative evolutionary entropy of the incumbent and the invader. we exploit this new theory of entropic epidemiology to explain detailed empirical observations regarding the emergence of less pathogenic strains of human influenza A virus. we discuss the current on-going swine \u2018flu (H1N1 2009) outbreak from the perspective of directionality theory. selective Advantage Classical epidemiological theory associates increased competitive advantage with increasing basic reproduction number, [27], [28]. the argument is that a larger results in a faster rate of infection of susceptibles (as determined by the growth rate, r) thereby driving competitor pathogen strains with lower to extinction. fecundity function is constant independent of infectious age. generation time T will be inversely related to the rate at which individuals leave the infected class. generation time T can be expressed in terms of entropy function S. antigenic shift and antigenic drift can be characterised in terms of the demographic parameter. this variable is analytically related to the population growth rate, r, and the entropy rate S/T by the identity. from this equation it follows that when corresponds to a relatively small growth rate of incumbents. competition is taking place between a new strain and a rapidly growing incumbent pathogen population. it is plausible to assume that the rate at which secondary infections are produced is broadly correlated with pathogen burden. this results in a net-reproductive function for influenza that is slightly skewed towards the early stages of host infection. the evolutionary entropy determines success so there may be dominant variants which produce fewer secondary infectives (i.e. have a lower growth rate and ) than co-circulating competitors. this pattern is seen in Table 1 where successful emergent epidemics have variable but short infectious durations. this pattern is also seen in Table 1 where successful emergent epidemics have variable but short infectious durations. infectious duration, D Swine flu 2009 1.2 to 1.6 3 days Seasonal flu 1.2 3\u20136 days 1918 flu 2 (up to 20) 4 days SARS 3 9 days Measles >10 >8 days Chickenpox >7 >7 days Mumps >10 >12 days Swine 'flu from Earn et al. [37], seasonal 'flu from Earn et al. [37], SARS from Lipsitch et al. [6], measles directionality theory suggests higher entropy relative to existing circulating sub-types. the larger entropy of the variant corresponds to longer infectious duration than the circulating incumbents. directionality theory suggests high pathogenicity immediately following establishment of a new sub-type followed by decreasing pathogenicity in subsequent years. a decline in the CFR is observed when comparing a pandemic attack year and the next subsequent epidemic [39] but there does not appear to be any detailed epidemiological analysis of long-term CFR trends during the drift phase. SARS had a higher and longer infectious duration than swine flu. but it did not have the same global impact, which reinforces the generic suggestion from entropic considerations that it is emergent diseases with shorter infectious durations that appear to have the greater pandemic potential. evolutionary entropy increases over time for three realisations of the simulation. this corresponds to the scenario of, i.e. variants are competing against incumbents at equilibrium in the host population. a plot of H versus time would yield the same pattern. evolutionary entropy describes the uncertainty in the state of the ancestor of randomly chosen infective. in finite populations with heterogeneity in age of infection the outcome of strain competition is a stochastic event determined by evolutionary entropy. this parameter is related to T, the generation time. heterogeneity the duration of infection will now be regulated by the pathogen entropy, S. this important fact underscores the fact that demographic heterogeneity dictated by will induce significant changes in the epidemiological dynamics. strain is responsible for generating the next global seasonal 'flu strain. once out of the seeding region there appears to be little subsequent viral evolution. subsequent changes tend to be deleterious and so die out. in the entropic model there is a probability of a downward drift in the evolutionary entropy, S, of the dominant strain. by contrast, in a finite population (and contingent on the values of, and to a lesser extent) the outcome has an intrinsic stochastic component: it is the evolutionary entropy that determines success so there may be dominant variants which produce more secondary infectives. Figure 1 shows the change in entropy over time for a simulation of the invasion process by variants. this corresponds to the scenario of, i.e. variants are competing against incumbents with positive growth rates in the host population. a plot of H versus time would yield the same pattern. the last major antigenic shift event was in 1968 and it generated the H3N2 strain that has been in circulation since. following antigenic shift the new influenza variant is in competition with an incumbent strain that is already at equilibrium in the population which suggests that the growth rate r is small, so. directionality theory implies high pathogenicity immediately following establishment of a new sub-type followed by decreasing pathogenicity in subsequent years. decrease in 'flu mortality in the era following the antigenic shift. if a new influenza sub-type is generated due to antigenic shift the cycle is repeated again. however, the model suggests that the case fatality rate (CFR - number of fatalities per infected individuals) will decline during the drift phase due to declining pathogenicity. directionality theory suggests that this might be the consequence of a long evolutionary adaptation to humans by occasional mutations resulting in ever higher evolutionary entropy S. this may be the consequence of a long evolutionary adaptation to humans by occasional mutations resulting in ever higher evolutionary entropy. simulations show evolutionary entropy increasing over time for three realisations. this corresponds to the scenario of, i.e. variants are competing against incumbents at equilibrium in the host population. the epidemiological picture in this densely populated SE-Asia seeding region is one of strong fluctuations of multiple circulating strains. competition is taking place between a new variant and a rapidly growing incumbent pathogen population that has a large positive growth rate r. it is plausible to assume that the rate at which secondary infections are produced is broadly correlated with pathogen burden. the evolutionary entropy determines success so there may be dominant variants which produce fewer secondary infectives (i.e. have a lower growth rate and ) than their co-circulating competitors. we expect new annual 'flu strains to have variable and short infectious duration relative to strains circulating in the SE-Asia seed network because of their smaller evolutionary entropy, S. in future new vaccination criteria will be required for emergent epidemics which take into account finite population size, variability in infection profile and stochasticity effects. a plot of H versus time would yield the same pattern. this corresponds to the scenario of, i.e. variants are competing against incumbents with positive growth rates in the host population. favourable condition for establishment of the new type is higher entropy relative to existing circulating sub-types. the larger entropy of the variant corresponds to longer infectious duration than the circulating incumbents. directionality theory implies high pathogenicity immediately following establishment of a new sub-type followed by decreasing pathogenicity in subsequent years. the model suggests that the case fatality rate (CFR - number of fatalities per infected individuals) will decline during the drift phase due to declining pathogenicity. there does not appear to be any detailed epidemiological analysis of long-term CFR trends during the drift phase. the extent of pre-existing immunity to H1N1 (swine flu) is currently unknown, but our results suggest that in humans there may be some pre-existing protection from previous exposure to influenza virus. Alternatively it may simply be a novel pandemic strain with short infectious duration. the concept of a basic reproduction number retains its conventional role as a measure of selective advantage. it is apparent that within the approach presented here the epidemiological context (emergent pathogen versus established equilibrium) in which the competition takes place does matter to the outcome and the properties of strains that will dominate. new pandemic variants generated by antigenic shift will be more pathogenic than the subsequent seasonal strains generated by evolutionary antigenic drift. results suggest monitoring of emergent strains with a shorter infectious duration is a better indicator of pandemic risk than focussing on just, as they present an elevated threat of triggering pandemics. the concept of evolutionary entropy provides a framework that is stochastic in its foundation for resolving these limitations. the population of infectives is divided into discrete \u201cage\u201d classes. each day every individual either moves up to the next age class or moves to the Recovered class with probability. the supply of susceptibles is then re-instated and the boom-bust cycle repeats itself. new strain variants are generated through the cycle. the purpose of this is to mimic the conditions for emergence of new variants when there is competition and growth. an extrinsic mortality is applied to all individuals to reduce the population of infectives back down to its starting value. in both scenarios, at each time step, the dominant (most frequent) genotype is determined and its entropy calculated from equation S4. new infectives start with infectious age = 0. If mutation rate then this new strain will be a variant strain. each day the number of each strain is calculated so that the dominant (highest frequency) strain can be identified. the entropy, S, of this strain is then calculated using the demographic parameters. mutants are defined by where is monotonic in x. mutants arise from translation on the function (corresponding to a change in the age of infector) or from a re-scaling of (corresponding to an increase or decrease in the net fecundity function) the criteria noted in Table S1 have been tested against simulation where they have been shown to be replicated. the criteria noted in Table S1 have been tested against simulation where they have been shown to be replicated."}
