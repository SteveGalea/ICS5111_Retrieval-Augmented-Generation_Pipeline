{"summary": "HBoV is associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections and gastroenteritis in children. the seroepidemiological profile suggests that most children are exposed to HBoV during the first two years of life in Jamaica. human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [9]; human coronaviruses: NL63 [10] and HKU1 [11]; human coronaviruses: NL63 [10], KI and WU polyomaviruses [13], [14]; and human bocavirus (HBoV) [15]. in the united states, HBoV viral DNA was detected by PCR in 5.2% of nasophary study examined hospitalized and non-hospitalized children ages 0\u201318 years presenting for care at the university hospital of the west indies, in Kingston, Jamaica between June 23 and August 10, 2009. the study was to generate estimates of exposure to HBoV in the Caribbean and to compare hospitalized and non-hospitalized children. both blood samples were centrifuged at 10,000 RPM for 10 minutes. blood serum was collected and stored at the university hospital of the west indies at 20 degrees Celsius. the ELISA uses virus like particles (VLPs) composed of the VP2 gene of HBoV. the cut-off point to classify samples as seropositive or seronegative was calculated. a serum specimen negative for HBoV was defined as having an OD4500.234 (at dilution of 140) for this calculation, negative OD450 values were set to zero. a dilution of 140 was chosen for its optimal reactivity with HBoV VLPs in the given ELISA. positive and negative controls were identified and compared to samples with known HBoV infection. the identified positive and negative controls were used in each assay. 287 blood samples were collected from pediatric patients aged 0\u201318 years. 134 (46.7%) of the children were male and 153 (53.3%) were female. 80% of newborns at birth were seropositive for HBoV, but this proportion decreased to 50% by six months of age. 71/84 (84.5%) hospitalized children versus 79/118 (66.9%) of non-hospitalized children testing seropositive to HBoV (P=0.005). hospitalized children were significantly older with an average age of 53.240.7 months versus 26.216.9 months for non-hospitalized children. HBoV seroepidemiology in hospitalized patients may not be representative of an overall seropositivity rate of the population. more hospitalized children were exposed to HBoV than healthy children. this was found to be directly related to the age of the populations. our study was performed prior to the discovery that HBoV has specific subtypes. the ELISA used is not specific to individual HBoV subtypes. this is the first study of HBoV seroepidemiology in a Caribbean population."}
