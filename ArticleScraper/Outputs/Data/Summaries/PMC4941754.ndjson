{"summary": "canine influenza virus (CIV) H3N2 is a virus of avian origin and was first reported in 2007. all gene segments of CIV H3N2 were shown to be homologous to avian influenza viruses. therefore, interspecies transmission of influenza virus from birds to dogs was suggested to be possible. the influenza virus demonstrates high infectivity via aerosol and respiratory droplet transmission. ferrets can predict the possibility for inter and intraspecies transmission of CIV H3N2 among dogs, cats, and ferrets under controlled conditions. blood samples were collected from each animal and the titer of antibodies against CIV was determined using a commercial ELISA kit. intraspecies transmission Two cats and three ferrets were infected with CIV on day 0. six hours after infection, the two infected cats were comingled with two nave cats in the same cage. animals dogs (beagle, 9weekold), cats (domestic short hair, 10weekold) and ferrets (12weekold) were housed in each cage of the isolation facility at Green Cross Veterinary Products (Yongin, South Korea) all animal experiments complied with the current laws of south Korea. two cats and three ferrets were infected with CIV on day 0. Six hours after infection, the two infected cats were comingled with two nave cats in the same cage. the three infected ferrets were comingled with three nave ferrets. infected cats and dogs showed sneezing, coughing, abdominal breathing, and nasal discharges. infected ferrets exposed to either infected dogs (via direct contact) or infected dogs (via direct contact) did not present with respiratory signs. the respiratory dropletexposed cats were shedding detectable quantities of virus (>5 logEID50/ml) by day 9. however, no viral shedding was detected by nasal swab at any point during the study. sally infected cats and ferrets and from nave cats and ferrets exposed to infected animals via direct contact. Virus shed from infected cats and exposed nave cats. only animals with a PI value of 50 were considered seropositive. transmission route no. of positive animals/no. tested Clinical signs* Seroconversion Infected Contacted Infected Contacted Dog** to cat AE 4/4 2/2 4/4 2/2 Cat** to cat DC 2/2 2/2 2/2 Ferret*** to ferret DC 3/3 0/3 3/3 2/3 AE, airborne exposure; DC, direct contact. the number of virus shed was higher from the infected cats than from the infected ferrets. the nave ferrets in direct contact with intranasally infected ferrets only shed detectable virus on days 10 and 11 postinfection. two of the three ferrets exposed to the intranasally infected ferrets were seropositive. but those exposed (via respiratory droplet) to infected cats were not. human influenza H3N2 virus showed preferential binding to 2,3linked sialic acid receptors. the virus was not transmissible to ferrets expressing 2,6linked sialic acid receptors. the virus could be shed from inoculated ferrets. interspecies transmission of CIV H3N2 to ferrets is not fully established. such additional adaptation may occur when ferrets are intranasally inoculated with the virus. adapted viruses could be transmitted from infected ferrets to ferrets. the molecularbased mechanism study should be followed to reveal the factors of inter and intraspecies transmission of CIV H3N2. authors Hyekwon Kim and daesub Song have carried out clinical and laboratory works. song DS, An DJ, Moon HJ et al.
