{"summary": "NK cells prevent excessive production of IFN-/ and promote more efficient antiviral CD8 T cell responses. it will be important to examine whether NK cells control innate cytokine production to prevent immunopathology and to promote adaptive immunity against herpesviruses. the importance of an efficient NK cell response for the promotion of a favorable outcome to viral infections has been demonstrated in both mice and humans. the rapid activation of NK cells after infection is a hallmark of their potency as innate immune system effectors. several reports have documented the importance of NK/DC \u201ccross-talk\u201d for the reciprocal activation of these cells and in the promotion of antitumor immunity. different viruses have recently been suggested to induce a profound immunosuppression in the host by inducing overwhelming levels of IFN-/ [19]. the importance of the host genotypes in the efficiency of IFN-/ antiviral functions in the context of the infection with specific viruses is well documented. NK cells from BALB/c and other strains of mice lacking the Ly49H gene are strongly activated for the acquisition of the cytotoxic machinery. they fail to recognize and kill infected cells and can therefore be considered inefficient. rigorous evaluation of the impact of NK cell responses on pDC and adaptive responses requires comparison between mice of same genetic background. pDC IFN-/ production is limited to levels not immunosuppressive to the host. early control of cytokines is required for the proliferation and accumulation of NK cells between days 3 and 7 after MCMV infection. we first used NK cell expansion as an indicator to show that Klra8 and BALB/c mice generate an NK cell response. similar results were observed when comparing serum cytokine levels between control-treated and NK cell\u2013depleted Klra8 mice. the systemic production of IFN-/ and other innate cytokines in response to MCMV infection is very high in susceptible animals. most of the systemic production of IFN-/ and IL-12p70 comes from pDCs. pDCs infected with MCMV in vitro have been reported to produce high levels of IFN-/ [33,34] cDCs infected with MCMV in vitro have been reported to produce high levels of IFN-/ or IL-12p70. both pDCs and cDCs contributed to the production of IL-12 in a8 mice. however, the high IL-12p70 serum levels observed in a8 mice could solely be attributed to pDCs. this was drastically reduced in congenic animals endowed with efficient antiviral NK cell functions. pDCs of mice infected with low virus inoculums are able to produce high levels of IFN-/ under conditions of stimulation with high viral inoculums. NK cell depletion in mice infected with low virus inoculums also shown to lead to a dramatic increase in pDC IFN-/ production. the cause for this ablation of cDCs in BL/6 animals has not been identified. the effect of this ablation on the development of antiviral CD8 T cells has not been evaluated. pDC numbers remained at homeostatic levels in both the CD11b and CD8 subsets. c mice on days 0, 1.5, 2, and 3 post\u2013MCMV infection. results are expressed as mean SD of three mice per group. we compared the kinetics of CD8 T cell expansion between Klra8 and BALB/c mice. c57BL/6 mice were depleted of NK cells by antibody treatment. we observed accumulation of effector CD8 T cells in BALB/c mice. c57BL/6 mice were isolated from Klra8 and BALB/c mice. the CD8 T cell populations were analyzed for their ability to produce IFN- after antigen-specific re-stimulation with IE-1 peptide-pulsed P815.B7 cells. the CD8 T cells were analyzed for their ability to kill IE-1 and m164 peptide-pulsed target cells in vivo. Graphs represent the percentage of target cells killed for one representative animal from groups of three mice. results in graphs are expressed as mean SD of three mice per group for (A\u2013C) one experiment representative of three (A, B) and two for (C) are shown. effective NK cell responses to a viral infection accelerate the development of effector antiviral CD8 T cell responses. the results are expressed as mean SD of two (A) or three (B, C) mice per group. the ability of NK cell activity to Optimally promote antiviral cDC and CD8 T cell responses can be overridden by type I interferons. MCMV-infected mice were treated with recombinant mouse IFN-. their DC or CD8 T cell compartments were compared to those of control-treated Klra8 and BALB/c mice. IFN- treatment induced a delay in the expansion of total, CD43hi, and IE-1 Tet+ CD8 T cell numbers. pDCs, CD11b cDCs, and CD8 cDCs were isolated on days 0 and 4 post\u2013MCMV infection from Klra8, Klra8 treated with IFN- at 30 and 48 h post-infection. total numbers (in millions) of CD8 cells, CD43hi CD8 T cells, and IE-1 tetramer+ CD8 T cells were determined and are presented as in Figure 3. the effects of the NK cell activity of Klra8 animals on DC and CD8 T cells. doxycycline treatment protocol mimics the extent and kinetics of efficient NK cell\u2013mediated control of viral replication observed in Klra8. doxycycline-treated DN-SCP-MCMV-infected BALB/c mice were comparable at different time points. accelerated activation of antiviral CD8 T cells in doxycycline-treated DN-SCP-MCMV-infected BALB/c mice. the treatment of DN-SCP-MCMV-infected mice with doxycycline had no effect on any of the parameters tested. the total numbers (in millions) of pDCs, CD11b cDCs, and CD8 cDCs were determined. the total numbers (in millions) of pDCs, CD11b cDCs, and CD8 cDCs were determined. NK cell depletion in Klra8 mice increased viral replication to levels similar to those observed in congenic Klra8 animals. the serum levels of IFN-/ were dramatically lower (100-fold) at the peak of the response (day 1.5) and decreased at all other times points examined, in Klra8 mice. results expressed as mean SD of three mice per group and in 10 thousands of cells. cDCs infected with MCMV in vitro have been reported to produce high levels of IFN-/. the increase in the systemic levels of IFN-/ observed in BALB/c animals could result from a high activation of pDCs or from a more significant contribution to this function from other cell types. pDCs were the sole producers of IFN-/ or IL-12p70 in Klra8 as compared to 10%\u201312% in. titers in these animals were measured by ELISA on serum samples. the number of pDCs producing IFN-/ by flow cytometry increases dramatically at high viral dose inoculums in Klra8 mice. a 5-fold difference in the virus inoculums from 5 103 to 2.5 104 pfu/mouse is sufficient to switch on IFN-/ production. early control of MCMV Replication by NK Cells Prevents the Ablation of cDCs and Accelerates the development of effector antiviral CD8 T cell responses. high systemic levels of IFN-/ production have been shown to lead to the ablation of cDCs in the context of inefficient NK cell activity. however, the cause for this ablation of cDCs in BALB/c mice has not been identified. pDCs, CD11b cDCs, and CD8 cDCs present in the spleens of Klra8 and BALB/c mice for days 0 and 2 post\u2013MCMV infection. Graphs represent the total number (in millions) of pDCs, CD11b cDCs, and CD8 cDCs within the total spleen population for one representative animal. isoform of CD43 on CD8 T lymphocytes identifies the subset of effector cells capable of IFN- production and potent cytolytic activity ex vivo. we then used MHC class I tetramers loaded with a peptide derived from the IE-1 protein of MCMV. similar results were obtained when analyzing the CD8 T cell response against another viral peptide, derived from protein m164. numbers in dot plots represent percent CD43hi or percent IE-1 tetramer+ CD8 T cells within the total CD8 T cell population. results are expressed as mean SD of three mice per group. numbers in dot plots represent percent IFN-+ CD8 T cells within the total CD8 T cell population. Graphs represent the total numbers (in millions) of IFN-+ CD8 T cells. no accelerated expansion of CD8 T cells occurs in Klra8 animals. the effects of efficient NK cell activity on the development of antiviral CD8 T cell responses were confirmed in mice of another genetic background. the impact of efficient NK cell activity on the development of antiviral CD8 T cell responses was confirmed in mice of another genetic background. total CD8 T cell numbers, CD43 expression on CD8 T cells, and IE-1-loaded MHC class I tetramer binding to CD8 T cells were analyzed for (A\u2013C) Graphs represent total numbers (in millions) of cells for each parameter. results are expressed as mean SD of two (A) or three (B, C) mice per group. low but detectable levels of infectious viral particles were observed in both control-treated and IFN--injected mice. exogenous injection of IFN- in Klra8 mice is sufficient to decrease the numbers of cDCs and to ablate early antiviral CD8 T cell responses. the possibility remains that other innate cytokines, such as IL-12 and TNF-, may also bear some contribution to this function. pDCs, CD11b cDCs, and CD8 cDCs were isolated on days 0 and 4 post\u2013MCMV infection from Klra8, Klra8 treated with IFN- at 30 and 48 h post-infection. total numbers (in millions) of CD8 T cells, CD43hi CD8 T cells, and IE-1 tetramer+ CD8 T cells were determined. doxycycline treatment protocol mimics the extent and the kinetics of efficient NK cell\u2013mediated control of viral replication observed in Klra8 mice. the reduction in viral burden in doxycycline-treated DN-SCP-MCMV-infected BALB/c animals led to a significant, strong decrease in the serum levels of the pDC-derived cytokines IFN- and IL-12p70. cytokine levels of IFN- and IL-12p70 were determined. total numbers (in millions) of pDCs, CD11b cDCs, and CD8 cDCs were determined. NK cells promote the accelerated generation of effector antiviral CD8 T cells during infection in vivo, in part by preventing the generation of very high, immunosuppressive levels of antiviral cytokines. our results demonstrate that NK cells can dramatically decrease the intensity and duration of pDC activation by controlling viral burden. measles virus and LCMV can exploit the host's IFN-/ response. MCMV also can induce high production of IFN-/ to promote its own survival by ablating cDCs and delaying activation of antiviral effector CD8 T cells. efficient NK cell activity contributes to the adaptive arm of the immune response to MCMV by promoting the accelerated expansion of antigen-specific CD8 T cells. our data support a role for NK cell control of pDC IFN-/ production for the promotion of antigen-specific CD8 T cell expansion. this extended activation of the T cell compartment is required for MCMV control. this could lead to chronic inflammation and long-term detrimental effects for the host. this could also be the case for infections with highly pathogenic strains of influenza, as excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines has been suggested. NK cells can confer resistance through recognition of infected cells by the NKp46 receptor. NK cells can confer resistance through recognition of infected cells by the NKp46 receptor. a correlation between unregulated IFN-/ responses and a malfunction of the switch from innate to adaptive immunity has been reported during fatal SARS. NK cells can produce IFN- in a Ly49H environment. these cognate interactions could also enable NK cells to act as direct regulators of antiviral immunity. the importance of these cognate interactions for the promotion of efficient NK cell functions may differ depending on the tissues and on the target cell types. lra8, (Jackson Laboratory, http://www.jax.org/), B10.D2, and B10.D2-DAP12-deficient (DAP12\u00b0) animals were bred in pathogen-free breeding facilities at the Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy (Marseille, France) protocols have been approved by the French Provence ethical committee (number 04/2005) and the US Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (assurance A5665\u201301).
