{"summary": "in eukaryotic viruses, the slippery site has the heptameric motif N NNW WWH (3). the nature of the slippery sequence enables re-pairing of the non-wobble bases of both the aminoacyl- and peptidyl-tRNAs. a growing number of examples now exist of PRF signals in expressed eukaryotic genes (11\u201316) there have been several published reports aimed at the in silico identification of \u2018recoding signals\u2019 using a wide variety of computational approaches (4,17\u201321) the first computational search for eukaryotic 1 PRF signals (19) did not focus solely on identifying two overlapping out-of-frame ORFs. this early study found some 260 putative 1 PRF signals in the annotated portion of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. shortcomings of the study were its limitation by incomplete annotation of the yeast genome. data mining and analysis was carried out using scripts written in PERL. unless otherwise noted, data is stored in a relational database. the complete coding sequence (CDS) of S.cerevisiae was randomized using seven different methods for sequence randomization. each genome had the same number of open reading frames (ORFs) and identical ORF lengths of the natural S.cerevisiae genome. a total of 100 random genomes were generated for each of the seven methods. secondary structure prediction Pknots (24) was used to predict the minimum free energy (MFE) \u2018fold\u2019 of each motif hit identified by RNAMotif. each motif hit was folded by pknots and assigned a predicted MFE value (MFE in kcal/mol) and a predicted secondary structure. randomization and statistical analysis Each folded motif hit was randomly shuffled and refolded 100 times using pknots. all yeast cells were transformed using the alkali cation method (35) dual luciferase plasmids pJD375 and pJD376 have been described previously (36). Luminescence readings were obtained using a Turner Designs TD20/20TM Luminometer (Sunnyvale, CA) a minimum of 12 replicate assays were carried out for each candidate 1 PRF signal. the RNAMotif motif was created from analysis of 56 known viral 1 PRF signals from the RECODE (23) database. the RNAMotif descriptor had seven different methods for randomization. each genome had the same number of open reading frames (ORFs) and identical ORF lengths. randomized ORFs using the CDS single-nucleotide frequency. cdnShuffle, codons from each natural ORF are shuffled by triplicate monocodon permutation. diNuc, randomized ORFs generated using the observed CDS dinucleotide frequency. a total of 100 replicate genomes were generated for each of the seven methods. x is the estimate of the mean for the distribution of MFE values obtained from 100 randomizations. the normalized value of zR (z-random) obtained provides an estimate of the statistical significance and uniqueness of the predicted structure. pJD375, the \u2018zero-frame\u2019 control dual-luciferase frameshift reporter (DLR) plasmid, was used as a vector backbone. each putative PRF signal was cloned into unique SalI and BamHI restriction sites located in the multiple cloning site. the results of this pattern matching approach identified 10 340 slippery sites in the 6353 annotated coding sequences (CDS) of the yeast genome. 6016 of which are followed by at least one pseudoknot motif. RNAMotif identified 173 452 sequence windows that matched the specified parameters. noBias 3044 64.07 0.01 nShuffle 4567 70.84 0.01 nBias 4660 65.89 0.01 cShuffle 6551 85.13 0.02 sBias 6580 82.13 0.02 dnBias 6639 86.52 0.02 dnBias 6774 88.16 0.01 RNAMotif, the number of motif hits using our descriptor of randomization strategies produce random genomes with significantly fewer 1 PRF signals than are actually observed. this is consistent with the notion that 1 PRF signals can lead to aberrant translation and (most likely) dysfunctional proteins. randomization strategies that mimic the overall genome-wide or individual CDS nucleotide bias produce random genomes with significantly fewer 1 PRF signals than are actually observed. pknots (24), an algorithmic extension of mfold (39) is capable of predicting H-type pseudoknots of the type that are generally found associated with functional 1 PRF signals. pknots folds every sequence window identified as a potential motif hit by RNAMotif (173 452 sequence windows) in 5000 CPU h. (5 months) the randomization approach disrupts the nucleotide base order and any potential secondary structure for each input sequence but preserves the exact mononucleotide count of each base within the shuffling window. a superior method of randomization lies in preserving both mono- and dinucleotide ratios (32,45\u201347) a total of 3228 candidate signals (out of 66 842 non-redundant structures) include putative structures that meet or exceed the criteria for significance, having zR scores in the range of zR = [7.10,1.65] these significant motif hits are distributed among 2025 ORFs. a total of 1203 individual slippery sites in 751 ORFs are found to have more than one significant structure immediately downstream. nine candidate 1 PRF signals were selected for empirical analyses. eight of the nine candidate signals chosen are predicted to fold into a pseudoknot, the exception being the signal chosen from FKS1. candidates from EST2, EST2, NUP82 and TBF1 were chosen because they specifically do not meet any of the criteria above. the ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase expression promoted by 1 PRF signal containing reporters is normalized to a \u2018zero-frame\u2019 control reporter (pJD375) the results demonstrate that every signal containing a predicted mRNA pseudoknot promoted 1 PRF at levels that significantly exceeded non-programmed frameshifting. mRNA pseudoknots were all located in the mRNA pseudoknots. mutating them to sense codons would cause unknown changes to pseudoknot structures. such changes should not completely abrogate frameshifting, nor should they create functional 1 PRF signals de novo. the results of this pattern matching approach identified 10 340 slippery sites in the 6353 annotated coding sequences (CDS) of the yeast genome. RNAMotif identified 173 452 sequence windows that matched the specified parameters. the frequency of finding the motif in randomized sequences can provide some insight into the likelihood that a match occurs by chance. noBias 3044 64.07 0.01 nShuffle 4567 70.84 0.01 nBias 4660 65.89 0.01 cShuffle 6551 85.13 0.02 sBias 6580 82.13 0.02 cBias 6639 86.52 0.02 dnBias 6774 88.16 0.01 RNAMotif, the number of motif hits using our descriptor of functional randomization strategies generated genomes that harbored more 1 PRF signals than are actually found in the natural genome. this suggests a selective pressure against the random acquisition of functional 1 PRF signals in yeast. this is consistent with the notion that 1 PRF signals can lead to aberrant translation and (most likely) dysfunctional proteins. the first step was to assign a MFE value to each motif hit identified by RNAMotif. pknots (24), an algorithmic extension of mfold (39) is capable of predicting H-type pseudoknots of the type that are generally associated with functional 1 PRF signals. the randomization approach disrupts the nucleotide base order and any potential secondary structure for each input sequence. the randomization approach preserves the exact mononucleotide count of each base within the shuffling window. it is expected that this measure of significance is sufficient since functional secondary structures in mRNA sequences are considered more stable than random sequence. the distribution of zR scores for all candidate PRF signals fits a normal distribution. a total of 3228 candidate signals (out of 66 842 non-redundant structures) include putative structures that meet or exceed the criteria for significance. a total of 1203 individual slippery sites in 751 ORFs are found to have more than one significant structure immediately downstream. the red diamonds and associated labels indicate the location and parental gene of nine sequences empirically tested for frameshifting. the hypothetical distributions were created using summary statistics from Supplementary Table 2B. nine candidate 1 PRF signals were selected for empirical testing. the ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase expression promoted by 1 PRF signal containing reporters is normalized to a \u2018zero-frame\u2019 control reporter (pJD375) the results demonstrate that every signal containing a predicted mRNA pseudoknot promoted 1 PRF at levels that significantly exceeded non-programmed frameshifting. frameshift signals were re-engineered to bypass 1 frame encoded termination codons present downstream of slippery sites. this would cause unknown changes to pseudoknot structures, which would uncontrollably affect frameshifting. however, such changes should not completely abrogate frameshifting, nor should they create functional 1 PRF signals de novo. the need to identify PRF signals in higher organisms has grown in importance. there have been numerous computational studies aimed at identifying PRF signals (17\u201321,55\u201357) each study has met with different degrees of success. the presence of a pseudoknot as the \u2018most stable\u2019 structure is critical. this is further evidenced by the fact that the very energetically favorable and highly significant structure derived from FKS1 failed to promote detectable 1 PRF in vivo. the PRFdb was constructed to serve as a repository for all the predicted structures, slippery sites and statistical data in this study. only 10 1 PRF signals out of 10 340 potential slippery sites are predicted to bypass the normal zero-frame termination codon and encode an alternative C-terminal extension. however, BLAST analyses revealed that none of these extensions are predicted to encode functional alternative protein domains. this suggests that although potential 1 PRF signals are widespread in the yeast genome, they are almost uniformly predicted to direct ribosomes to a premature termination signals. the CDS of S.cerevisiae is not prone to lengthy out-of-frame translation. the relative positions of candidate 1 PRF signals from the start codon of each ORF compared to the expected overall change in peptide length if a frameshifting event was to occur. mRNAs containing high probability 1 PRF signals should be inherently less stable than those that do not contain this motif. a general function of PRF signals in the coding regions of eukaryotic mRNAs is to act as post-transcriptional capacitors of gene expression.
