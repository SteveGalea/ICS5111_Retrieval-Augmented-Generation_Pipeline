{"summary": "we have previously estimated that 27% of the human genes codes for alpha-helical membrane proteins and provided a comprehensive classification based on their function and evolutionary origin. however, there is still large work to be done to clarify the identity, annotation and the evolutionary history of several families of membrane bound proteins. the IFITM family is also involved in other processes such as oncogenesis, bone mineralization (IFITM5) and germ cell development (IFITM1 and 3) and IFITM5 has not been identified as interferon-inducible [11], [12], [13], [14]. no IFITM genes could be detected in any of the remaining 24 analyzed proteomes. the search of the nr database with HMMER did not get any hits outside metazoa except bacteria, choanoflagellates and the brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus (2 genes). the phylogeny of the vertebrate Dispanins shows the propsed hierarchy of the eukaryotic Dispanin family. the four subfamilies (A\u2013D) are marked with colors. node support values are given as posterior probabilities. the phylogenetic tree indicates that the DSPA2 genes have undergone an independent duplication in H. Sapiens and M. musculus. these genes were given a species specific nomenclature, e.g. DSPA2a\u2013d in human. the DSPB subfamily is only found in tetrapoda and contains three human genes called DSPB1 (TUSC5), DSPB2 (TMEM233) and DSPB3 (PRRT2) the invertebrate Dispanins share more similarity towards the DSPC and D subfamilies than DSPA and B (Figure 2). Figure 2. The evolutionary history of the Dispanins. the numbers at the branch ends represents the number of genes within each subfamily. most conserved pattern is the G-D motif and the A-X(6)-A motif. the first helix is the most conserved with an alanine (A) residue and double cysteine C- C (C-F-C in the DSPB family) whereas a glycine (G) residue is the most conserved in the second helix. the DSPD2 proteins that only are found in mammals seem to have lost their N-termini exon. all the classified B. floridae and S. purpuratus sequences has the corresponding splice site in the N-terminus. the N. vectensis and M. brevicollis proteins has 3\u20136 and 7 exons respectively. 46 bacterial sequences from 32 species were included for further analysis. no viral or archaean genes were annotated as IFITM homologues in UniProt. phylogeny of the vertebrate Dispanins allows division of the Dispanins into four subfamilies A\u2013D. the eukaryotic Dispanins first emerged in a common ancestor of M. brevicollis and the metazoan lineage. the vertebrate Dispanins sort into subfamilies A\u2013D. the phylogenetic tree indicates that the DSPA2 genes have undergone an independent duplication in H. Sapiens and M. musculus. the PPRT1 gene is found in all the vertebrate species except the basal organism P. marinus. DSPD2 (AL160276) is mammalian specific. five vertebrate genes and all invertebrate were excluded from the phylogenetic analysis. the Dispanins are rich in glycosylation- and phosphorylation sites that predominantly are found on the N-terminus. the N-terminus is often long (>100 amino acids) compared to the C-terminal (10 amino acids) and both are always oriented towards the outside of the cell. brate subfamily together with invertebrates, M. brevicollis (Mb) and a bacterial consensus sequences are included Conserved residues are coloured according to the Zappo scheme in Jalview. the conserved splice site between the two transmembrane helices is marked with a square. the family is found in metazoan, the choanoflagellate M. brevicollis and the brown alga E. siliculosus, but not in other eukaryotes. the highest number of bacterial Dispanins is detected in Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, which diverged around three billion years ago. the family in E. siliculosus has undergone two horizontal gene transfer events. the DSPC and D subfamilies form a separate cluster from DSPA\u2013B. the DSPC family is found in two to three copies in all vertebrates. DSPC1 (TMEM90A) has been proposed to have a role in striatial functioning and the pathophysiology of Huntington's disease. the mouse Dspd1 (Prrt1) gene is ubiquitously expressed with the highest expression in B-cells according to BioGPS. no previous studies have been performed on the DSPD subfamily. the phylogeny suggests that M. musculus and H. sapiens have undergone independent expansions of the group. however, the phylogeny is not strong enough to prove that the Dspa4a-f genes are orthologous to the mammalian DSPA2 genes. the dispanin family has several conserved motifs across subfamilies. one of the most prominent is the double cysteine motif (C-C) in the first transmembrane helix. this motif has recently been shown to undergo post-translational modification through S-palmitoylation in DSPA2C (IFITM3). the whole proteome dataset for the following eukaryotic species was included in the analysis. Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Gallus gallus, Xenopus tropicalis, Danio rerio, Petromyzon marinus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerviciae, Schistosoma mansoni, Apis mellifera, Apis all proteomes were searched against a local installation of the Pfam database (v.23) [24] using HMMER3 [25] and the script pfam_scan.pl. in Pfam, the IFITM family is represented by a specific hidden Markov model [Pfam: P04505] the dataset was searched against the PF04505 Pfam model using HMMER3 with default settings. sequences with a score above the Pfam gathering threshold (20.6) were deemed homologous to IFITM. ML tree option (-fa) was used to create 1000 bootstraps (-# 1000) using a gamma model of evolutionary rates and the JTT substitution model (-m PROTGAMMAJTT) the consensus phylogenetic tree found with MrBayes was drawn in Dendroscope 3.0. bootstrap support values from RAxML were annotated on the corresponding nodes. the resulting MSA was viewed and trimmed in Jalview. the conserved region around the TM helices was kept. the whole proteome dataset for the following eukaryotic species was included. all proteomes were searched against a local installation of the Pfam database. the script pfam_scan.pl uses the homology criterion set by the Pfam database. the gathering threshold for PF04505 is a score of 20.6. the nr protein dataset from NCBI was downloaded by browsing by taxonomy and restricting it to species with a full proteome set. the dataset contained 15,322,545 (20-09-11) protein sequences from a wide range of organisms. the dataset was searched against the PF04505 Pfam model using HMMER3 with default settings. phylogenetic tree was used to determine subfamilies by identifying clusters with a high posterior probability and bootstrap support. a sequence was assigned to the subfamily if four out of the five top hits are from the same subfamily. netPhos 2.0 identified potential phosphorylation sites. consensus sequences were aligned together with the M. brevicollis and the invertebrate sequences. the resulting MSA was viewed and trimmed in Jalview and the conserved region around the TM helices was kept."}
