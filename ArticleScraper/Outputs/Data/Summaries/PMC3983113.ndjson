{"summary": "the models predicted high or low incidence of dengue in a province four weeks in advance of an outbreak. the threshold between high and low was determined relative to historical incidence data. the method builds prediction models for future dengue incidence in the Philippines. dengue fever is a common human viral disease transmitted via the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes, typically Aedes aegypti. a severe presentation, known as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DF), occurs primarily in patients who are re-infected with a different serotype. mortality in DHF has been reported as high as 10\u201320% and over 40% if shock occurs. public health agencies see potential benefit if a means could be found to predict dengue outbreaks with enough advance time to allow for the planning and implementation of mitigation strategies. many published studies have described the association of different parameters with dengue outbreaks. a study by Hii et al. described a time series Poisson multivariate regression model to predict weekly dengue cases in Singapore using temperature, rainfall, and previous dengue incidence. they then used observed weather data and the previously predicted dengue incidences for prediction of dengue incidence during weeks 7\u201316 of 2011. medical records of dengue patients from the selangor area in Malaysia served as the data source for this approach. their classifiers did not predict area outbreaks for dengue but instead predicted whether or not a patient was a repeat dengue case. Buczak et al. developed data mining techniques for the prediction of multi-week dengue incidence in specific Philippines provinces four to seven weeks in advance. aac.usgs.gov/get_data Southern Oscillation Index US National Center for Atmospheric Research http://mirador.gsfc.nasa.gov Sea Surf.

NESSS and other disease surveillance systems in the RP were merged into PIDSR (Philippines Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response system), which became operational in 2008 and 2009. available health data thus represented suspected dengue hospital visits from NESSS and PIDSR from the beginning of 1993 to the end of 2011. geographic divisions of the Philippines consist of 17 regions divided into 80 provinces and the Manila Metropolitan Area. the provinces consist of roughly 1,650 cities and municipalities, which in turn comprise about 42,000 barangays. some of the missing province information was imputed from the available municipality geographic information. about 4000 of the municipality values also differed from those in the GIS municipality table after pre-processing. each mismatch was examined separately. 40 out of 81 provinces had relatively robust reporting. Table 3 shows the resulting provinces selected for further analysis. threshold between Low and High was determined based on historical data and feedback from local public health professionals. the threshold between Low and High was set at the mean plus 1.5 standard deviations, which corresponds to a weekly incidence of 4.554 per 100,000 population. the overall adjacent dengue incidence was computed as the sum of dengue case counts in all the neighboring provinces combined. the overall adjacent dengue incidence was computed as the sum of dengue cases in the neighboring provinces divided by the sum of populations of those provinces. the typhoon status variable was assigned a value according to the typhoon status variable. otherwise, the typhoon status and maximum sustained wind variables were set to null values. vegetation index data include the normalized difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) the sign of the SOI determines whether conditions are neutral, El Nio, or La Nia. the magnitude of the SOI indicates the strength of the El Nio and La Nia. higher sea surface temperatures (e.g., warm SSTA) result in more convection and the creation of rain-forming clouds. these clouds will be blown by the winds either away from or toward land. a literature review is performed to identify the environmental and socio-economic variables that are correlated with the given disease incidence. the data are pre-processed and used to find fuzzy association rules. a subset of these rules is then selected to create a classifier that becomes the Prediction Model. fuzzy association rules are of the form: where X and Y are variables, and A and B are membership functions that characterize X and Y respectively. X is called an antecedent and Y is called a consequent of the fuzzy association rule. an example of a fuzzy association rule (not used in dengue prediction) is: this rule uses the linguistic term (fuzzy set) HOT for temperature. confidence, lift, and support can be considered to be the conditional probability that, if the antecedents are true, then the consequent is true. a support of 0.01 means that a given rule describes 1% of a particular data set. lift represents the extent to which the antecedents and the consequents are not independent. the final classifier selected based on the criteria described above constitutes the Prediction Model. the prediction generator is a straightforward process that periodically computes predictions using the Prediction Model built in Step 2. this model only uses data that would actually be available on the date the prediction was generated. the weighted Voting Classifier is built in a similar fashion to but applied differently from the original classifier described in Buczak et al. [20]. all rules in the classifier that match the data point are found, and each rule casts a vote for its consequent that is weighted by the product of the rule's confidence and the rule's fuzzy support on that data point. a high incidence prediction could lead to a public health department using its limited resources to deploy costly measures. a high PPV indicates that, when the model predicts high incidence rate, high incidence is very likely to actually occur. a high Sensitivity indicates that the model predicts a high percentage of the outbreaks that actually occur. a value less than one or greater gives more importance to PPV and Sensitivity, respectively. the performance of the models with the best F0.5 and F3 values will be presented in this paper. the data were divided into three sets: training, fine-tuning, and testing. the presence of the virus may also be assessed by the determining number of infected mosquitoes. this data is time-consuming and expensive to obtain for a large geographic area such as Philippines. the NESSS data were provided in an Epi Info [24] format. all data since 2003 were packaged in Microsoft (MS) Access tables. the data from 1993 through 2002 were deemed to be too dissimilar from the later years. geographic information from dengue data was matched to freely available data from the Philippines Geographic Information System (GIS) data Clearinghouse [26]. some mismatches were due to abbreviations, typos, lower case letters, and outdated information. daily dengue incidence data were pre-processed into weekly data to mitigate issues, such as missing data and day-of-week effects. weekly dengue incidence rates were determined and plotted as a time series in order to assess whether the data were stable enough to be used for modeling. threshold between Low and High incidence needs to be determined before the rules are extracted from the data and the classifiers performing predictions are built. the threshold between Low and High incidence needs to be meaningful to the user and linked to the action to be taken when the predicted value exceeds the threshold. the historical mean and standard deviation of the incidence data were computed for the period January 2003 through December 2011. based on user feedback, the threshold between Low and High was set at the mean plus 1.5 standard deviations. each province was defined by its shape in the Philippines GIS database and adjacent provinces were identified. NESSS and other disease surveillance systems in the RP were merged into PIDSR (Philippines Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response system), which became operational in 2008 and 2009. available health data thus represented suspected dengue hospital visits from NESSS and PIDSR from the beginning of 1993 to the end of 2011. data from 2003 through 2011 were excluded, with the additional weeks allowing for a buffer period to absorb the effect of bad reporting. the geographic divisions of the Philippines consist of 17 regions divided into 80 provinces and the Manila Metropolitan Area. some of the missing province information was imputed from the available municipality geographic information. about 4000 municipality values also differed from those in the GIS municipality table after pre-processing. the match rate with GIS data improved to 96%. 40 out of 81 provinces had relatively robust reporting. Table 3 shows the resulting provinces selected for further analysis. threshold should be set high enough to reduce the chances of statistical and non-outbreak fluctuations in incidence data causing outbreak alarms. a low false alarm rate helps to conserve resources for situations in which the accurate prediction of an outbreak is more likely. threshold between Low and High was determined based on historical data and on feedback from local public health professionals. incidence rates were defined as the mean, highest, and median values of dengue incidence of all the neighboring provinces combined. the overall adjacent dengue incidence was computed as the sum of dengue cases in the neighboring provinces divided by the sum of populations of those provinces. typhoon intensity and associated wind data were obtained from the US Naval Oceanographic Command Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JWTC best track data) the typhoon status variable was assigned a value according to typhoon categorization. typhoon status and maximum sustained wind variables were set to null values. vegetation index data include the normalized difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) the sign of the SOI determines whether conditions are neutral, El Nio, or La Nia, while the magnitude of the SOI indicates the strength of the El Nio and La Nia. higher sea surface temperatures (e.g., warm SSTA) result in more convection and the creation of rain-forming clouds. these clouds will be blown by the winds either away from or toward land, resulting in changes in rainfall patterns that may not always be seasonal. a literature review is performed to identify the environmental and socio-economic variables that are correlated with the given disease incidence. the data are pre-processed and used to find fuzzy association rules. a subset of these rules is then selected to create a classifier that becomes the Prediction Model. fuzzy association rules are of the form: where X and Y are variables, and A and B are membership functions that characterize X and Y respectively. X is called an antecedent and Y is called a consequent of the fuzzy association rule. an important advantage of the fuzzy association rules is that they are easily understood by humans because of the linguistic terms. confidence, lift, and support can be considered to be the conditional probability that, if the antecedents are true, then the consequent is true. a support of 0.01 means that a given rule describes 1% of a particular data set. lift represents the extent to which the antecedents and the consequents are not independent. the prediction is LOW; if the default class is HIGH, then the prediction is HIGH. the final classifier selected based on the criteria described above constitutes the Prediction Model. a new prediction can be computed weekly when new input data are available. the enhancement automates the process of accepting user-specified ranges for the weights on each class. all possible models were built and tested on the fine-tuning data set. the second enhancement was to implement an additional classifier, named the Weighted Voting Classifier. TP, TN, FP, and FN represent, respectively, True Positive, True Negative, False Positive, and False Negative. a high incidence prediction could lead to a public health department using its limited resources to deploy costly measures (e.g., mosquito spraying) a high incidence prediction indicates that, when the model predicts high incidence rate, high incidence is very likely to actually occur. the performance of the models with the best F0.5 and F3 values will be presented in this paper. training, fine-tuning, and testing data sets were divided into three sets: training, fine-tuning, and testing. the testing data spanned March 2011\u2013December 2011 for 40 provinces. the results for all 81 provinces are also provided in order to determine how well the model can generalize to provinces that were never used in model development. results obtained from the model optimized for Sensitivity on the test data from the 40 provinces in 2011 show a PPV and Sensitivity of 0.778 and 0.627, respectively. the PPV and Sensitivity for the 2011 data for all 81 provinces were 0.748 and 0.555, respectively. the model optimized for Sensitivity (Table 5) shows more variation from 2011 to 2012 than the model optimized for PPV: Specificity and PPV stay at about the same level, whereas NPV and Sensitivity are decreased. this variation is also shown as a drop in F3 values from 0.639 to 0.484. overall, the models are relatively robust: their performance decreases gracefully when testing on data two years after the model training data. seasonal moving average prediction (SMAP) is the average of the week k-5 dengue data from the current year and the week k dengue data from the four previous years. the results of the seasonal moving average prediction are shown in Table 6. four data sets for simple autoregression (SP) and the FARM method used in this paper. the method builds a large number of models (i.e., classifiers) that differ because of different rule selection parameters (i.e., criteria for selecting and excluding rules based on support, confidence, etc.) the metrics (PPV, NPV, Sensitivity, Specificity, F0.5 and F3) are first computed on the fine-tuning data set. data set PPV NPV Sensitivity Specificity F3 fine-tuning set 0.656 0.990 0.952 0.904 0.911 Test set (2011 \u2013 all provinces) results obtained from the model optimized for Sensitivity on the test data from the 40 provinces in 2011 (Table 5) show a PPV and Sensitivity of 0.778 and 0.555, respectively. Figure 5 shows the actual and predicted weekly incidence (4 week ahead prediction) for the province of Abra using the prediction model from Table 4. There are two missed weekly HIGH incidences near 27 May 2011 and 27 September 2011 but most of the predictions are correct. for 12 provinces, the predictions are HIGH incidence (shown in red) and for the remaining provinces the predictions are LOW incidence (shown in green) seasonal moving average prediction (SMAP) is the average of the week k-5 dengue data from the current year and the week k dengue data from the four previous years. this seasonal moving average prediction (SMAP) is the average of the week k-5 dengue data from the current year and the week k dengue data from the four previous years. the method uses novel data mining techniques to sift through large quantities of disparate data in order to find associations among these data. the method automatically selects those associations that meet certain pre-defined criteria, and uses these selections as rules for a prediction model. models developed are robust and able to predict with reasonable accuracy even for those provinces that were never used in model development. model input data were those that would actually be available on the date the prediction was made. this was done to make the metrics representative of actual use."}
