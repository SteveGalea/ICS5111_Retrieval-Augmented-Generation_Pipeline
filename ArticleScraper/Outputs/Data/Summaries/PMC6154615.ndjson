{"summary": "gold nanoparticles have small (nano) size and corresponding large surface/volume ratio. it has been argued that Au nanoparticles could be used in almost all medical applications. a general scheme is shown in Figure 2. Vaccines have been a significant advancement in public health. the introduction of an antigen of a pathogen in blood stream stimulates the production of antibodies against the pathogen. intracellular bacteria triggers specific cellular immunity, eliciting CD4 and CD8+T cells that recognize processed bacterial antigens. gold nanoparticles vaccines can be further functionalized with the desired molecules according to their specific needs. gold nanoparticles, in general, have remarkably high surface-to-volume ratio. they are biocompatible and inert, and can be easily functionalized with several molecules. they can also be packaged inside virus-like particles generated by heterologous expression of viral structural genes. immunostimulatory nanocomposite (CpG-Au@HBc VLP) showed an increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers, inducing important cellular and humoral immune response. usGO-Au@OVA can promote robust OVA specific antibody response, CD8+ T cells proliferation, and secretion of different cytokines. pDNA-coated gold nanoparticles were successfully delivered into ex vivo murine and porcine skin at low inlet pressure using parallel arrays of microchannels. a solid-in-oil dispersion of gold nanorods can also enhance transdermal protein delivery and skin vaccination. cancer Vaccines Cancer is one of the main causes of death worldwide. cancer vaccines have high specificity for tumor cells and long-lasting immunological memory that may safeguard against recurrence. therapeutic cancer vaccines work to enable the immune system of a patient to eradicate cancer cells. gold nanoparticle immunotherapies are well suited for synergistic combination therapy with existing cancer therapies such as photothermal ablation [59,87], all these features suggest that gold nanoparticle-based antigen delivery systems may be a useful vaccine technology. gold nanoparticles are promising vehicles for immune therapies, especially for combinatorial treatment approaches that target multiple immune pathways. a glycopeptide sequence derived from MUC-1 glycoprotein and the T-cell epitope P30 sequence were immobilized gold nanoparticles attached to polyethylene glycol chains. mice showed significant MHC-II mediated immune responses, and their antisera were able to recognize human breast cancer cells. gold nanoparticles designed this way have the potential to be used in the development of anticancer vaccines. gold nanoparticles can bind 2G12 with high affinity and interfere with 2G12/gp120 binding. oligomannosides are present in gp120 and have been used in attempts to develop an HIV vaccine. gold nanorods modified with poly(diallydimethylammonium chloride) the vaccine was prepared by conjugating colloid gold with a soluble TBE antigen. in animals immunized with the experimental vaccine, the protection coefficient and mean survival time were 1.3\u20131.5 times and 10\u201330% higher than in mice immunized with the commercial vaccine. phalitis on a gold electrode modified by [nano-Au/Co(bipyridine)33+]2/nano-Au/l-cysteine has also been reported. it exhibited fast potentiometric high sensitivity and long-term stability. these works are promising test methods for biological products. a new method of preparation of a vaccine for hepatitis E (HEVA) was recently reported. gold nanoparticles were conjugated to a synthetic peptide of the foot-and-mouth disease virus. the resulting conjugate was compared to a commercial vaccine and to the native peptide. gold nanoparticles were evaluated as vaccine carriers for enhancing antibody response against a resembling foot-and-mouth disease virus peptide. chitosan functionalized gold nanoparticles (CsAuNPs) were used as a carrier for the tetanus toxoid (TT) antigen along with the immunostimulant Quillaja saponaria extract (QS). mice immunized with a transmissible gastroenteritis virus, conjugated with colloidal gold nanoparticles, produced antibodies with a higher titer than those produced in response to the native virus. this antigen delivery approach against listeriosis, using gold nanoparticles and bacterial peptides, elicits protective cellular immunity, independent of the adjuvant used. amphiphilic surface ligand-coated Au nanoparticles able to target myeloid dendritic cells in lymph nodes were used as a peptide antigen carrier. gold nanoparticles were coated with the F1-antigen of Yersinia pestis (bacterium responsible for the plague), using N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N\u2032-ethylcarbodiimi gold nanoparticles were conjugated to N-terminal domains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa flagellin recombinant protein through direct interaction of thiol molecules with gold and formation of Au\u2013S bond. sVLPs were prepared by incubating 100 nm gold nanoparticles in a solution containing an avian coronavirus spike protein. iC was evaluated for the first time as a candidate vaccine for glanders on rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) it has recently been shown that the Pichia pastoris yeast expression system was adequate for the production of recombinant-truncated proteins. tORF25, tORF25C, and tORF25D are potential candidate vaccines against Cyprinid herpes virus 2 infection. gold nanoparticles blocked viral replication, virus-induced cytopathogenic effects, and virus spread in cell culture without inducing cytotoxicity. gB-gold nanoparticles blocked viral replication, virus-induced cytopathogenic effects, and virus spread in cell culture without inducing cytotoxicity. potential of gold for stimulating research in vaccines is considerable."}
