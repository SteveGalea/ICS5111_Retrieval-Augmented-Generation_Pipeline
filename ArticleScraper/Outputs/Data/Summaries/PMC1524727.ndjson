{"summary": "Lassa virus is an enveloped virus with a bi-segmented RNA genome. it encodes four viral proteins in an ambisense coding strategy. GP-C is cleaved at the C-terminus of a non-basic amino acid residue of the cleavage motif R-R-L-L. glycoproteins of arenaviruses vary considerably in number and position of potential N-glycosylation sites. the Lassa virus glycoprotein GP-C contains eleven potential N-glycosylation consensus sites (N-X-S/T), where seven are located in the GP1- and four in the GP2-subunit (Table 1). 4 N-glycosylation sites are dispensable for cleavage of GP-C. both uncleaved precursor and cleavage-defective N-glycan mutants are transported to the cell surface and remain mannose-rich. - - - - - 166 - 178 - - - - - 4 - 357 365 382 387 4 8 483 Sabia - 71 - - 90 101 - 127 - - 173 180 - - 224 7 - 362 370 387 392 4 11 488 Guanarito - - - - - - - 127 - - - - agent N- [-maleimidoacetoxy] succinimide ester (AMAS) was tested by peptide standard ELISA [18] and used for immunoblot analyses. mutants were generated by recombinant PCR using overlapping oligonucleotides. 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM iodacetamide, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 units/ml aprotinin, and 20 mM Tris-HCl. the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with anti-GP-C at a final dilution of 1:1000. samples were treated with either endo--N-acetylglucosamini recombinant glycoprotein of Lassa virus (strain Josiah) was expressed using beta-actin promotor-driven pCAGGS vector. mutants were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated twice for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. cells were lysed in 0.5 ml RIPA (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM iodacetamide, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 mM Tris-HCl) the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with anti-GP-C at a -C contains 11 potential N-glycosylation sites, 7 in the GP-1- and 4 in the GP-2-subunit. corresponding serine or threonine residues of potential N-glycosylation motifs were individually changed to alanine. GP-1 mutants were designated T81A, S91A, T101A, S111A, S121A, S169A and T226A and GP-2 mutants S367A, S375 only GP-C of the mutants S392A and S397A are further cleaved into GP-1 and GP-2 similar to fully glycosylated wild-type GP-C. no cleavage of the glycoprotein was observed within the mutants S367A and S375A. a Vero cells expressing wild-type GP-C or GP-1 N-glycosylation mutants. expressed proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide gels. non-cleaved GP-C and its cleaved form GP-2 are detected by immunostaining. GP-2 mutants are transported to the cell surface in a similar manner compared to wild-type GP. both cleavage and cell surface expression of LCMV GP-C are impaired in parallel. both cleavage and cell surface expression of LCMV GP-C are impaired in parallel. LCMV GP-C has been shown that transition of mannose-rich carbohydrates to complex carbohydrates occurred before maturation cleavage [22]. cell surface biotinylation was combined with a subsequent detachment of mannose-rich N-glycans by digestion with endo H or removal of complex N-glycans using PNGase F. cleavage of Lassa virus GP-C occurs prior to trimming of the mannose-rich N-glycans to complex sugar types. it can not be ruled out that the use of glycosylation sites and the N-glycan trimming differ between recombinant expressed glycoproteins and GP in LASV-infected cells. GP-1 mutants were designated T81A, S91A, T101A, S111A, S121A, S169A and T226A and GP-2 mutants S367A, S375A, S392A and S397A. all cDNA constructs were expressed transiently in vero cells using the beta-actin promoter-driven mammalian expression vector pCAGGS. western blotting was performed using antiserum directed against the GP-2 subunit of mutants S392A and S397A revealed faster electrophoretic mobility than wild type GP-2. no cleavage of the glycoprotein was observed within the mutants. non-cleaved GP-C and its cleaved form GP-2 are detected by immunostaining using the antiserum rb--GP-2. transfected Vero cells were labelled with non-membrane-permeating biotin. cleavage and cell surface expression of LCMV GP-C are impaired in parallel. both cleavage and cell surface expression of LCMV GP-C are impaired in parallel. GP-2 subunit is detectable at the cell surface and displays partial endo H-resistance confirming a modification of its carbohydrate decoration during glycoprotein transport to the cell surface (lane 2). Interestingly, the glycoprotein precursor GP-C which is transported to the cell surface remains completely endo H-sensitive suggesting that cleavage might be a prerequisite for further complex glycosylation. cleavage of Lassa virus GP-C occurs prior to trimming of the mannose-rich N-glycans to complex sugar types. it can not be ruled out that the use of glycosylation sites and the N-glycan trimming differ between recombinant expressed glycoproteins and GP in LASV-infected cells. authors' contributions RE and TS carried out experiments, participated in the analysis of the results and drafted the manuscript.
