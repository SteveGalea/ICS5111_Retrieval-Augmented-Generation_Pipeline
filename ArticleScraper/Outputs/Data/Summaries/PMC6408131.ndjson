{"summary": "human immunodeficiency virus infection, malignancy, solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplantation, and primary immune deficiency compose the risk factors for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in children. 5-month-old male infant presented with cyanosis and interstitial pneumonia. he received hematopoietic cell transplantation for the underlying HIGM syndrome. his mother was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis 16 months before his birth. 134 beats/min; respiratory rate, 49 breaths/min; body temperature, 37.1\u00b0C. ejection fraction of 78.7% without anatomical and functional abnormalities. blood tests revealed white blood cell count of 22,250/mm3, hemoglobin levels of 16.5 g/dL, platelet count of 536,000/mm3, and C-reactive protein levels 0.02 mg/dL without any abnormal findings in blood chemistry. multiplex PCR test for respiratory viruses revealed negative results for influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, and human bocavirus. however, any findings of definite airway inflammation and increased pulmonary secretion were not observed. the diffuse haziness began to fade after 2 weeks of treatment (C), and (D) much improved 3 weeks later. a lymphocyte subset test was performed on HD #3. a lymphocyte subset test was performed on HD #3. HIGM syndrome is caused by a defect in the CD40-CD40L signaling pathway. most cases are caused by a mutation of the CD40L gene located at the X chromosome which encodes CD40L on the T cell surface. otype switching can cause HIGM syndrome. CD40, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AICDA), uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic delta (PIK3CD), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 alpha (PIK3R1), nuclear factor-kappa-B essential modul 80% of children acquire antibodies against P. jirovecii before 2 years of age. 80% of children acquire antibodies against P. jirovecii before 2 years of age, and about 20% of them seem to experience asymptomatic infection. underlying PID should be evaluated in infants diagnosed with PCP using recently developed molecular genetic techniques. underlying PID should be considered in infants presenting with severe interstitial pneumonia."}
