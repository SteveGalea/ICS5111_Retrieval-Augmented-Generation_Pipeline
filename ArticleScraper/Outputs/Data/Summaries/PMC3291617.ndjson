{"summary": "vaccine-induced T cell immunity is believed to be key to achieving successful immunization against AIDS, or enabling cross-protective capacities in next generation influenza vaccines [1]\u2013[3]. vaccine-induced T cell immunity is believed to be key to achieving successful immunization against AIDS, or enabling cross-protective capacities in next generation influenza vaccines. MVA has also been developed as a non-replicating viral vector to construct experimental recombinant vaccines against various infectious diseases [17]\u2013[22]. mass immunization with VACV during the smallpox eradication program indicated a critical role for cellular immune responses. our aim was to analyze the immunological mechanism(s) of the early protective capacity conferred by MVA immunization. rapid protection against lethal systemic poxvirus disease is solely dependent on the cellular adaptive immune response with an important role of CD4 and CD8 T cells. however, the humoral response seems fully dispensable in providing early protection. we characterized the infiltrated leukocytes by bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) at different time-points after i.n. administration of MVA. the infiltrates consisted of monocytes, dendritic cells (DC), neutrophils, and NK cells. this suggests that the lung environment is highly favorable for antigen presentation and induction of adaptive responses. similar expression levels of this specific B8R product were found for MVA and conventional VACV strain Elstree. proportionally high numbers of activated VACV (B8R20\u201327 epitope)-specific CD8+ T cells in BAL liquids by day 5 p. i., but relatively lower numbers of VACV-specific CD8+ T cells in the spleen. to 5 mice (mean SD from three independent experiments) stimulated with VACV specific B8R20\u201327 or control peptides (LacZ876) at 3, 5 and 7 days post MVA immunization. results indicate early local immune responses induced after in vivo MVA inoculation arecharacterized by powerful innate responses. unvaccinated control mice showed signs of morbidity (body weight loss) at about 6 days after challenge infection, and all died within 11 days. analysis of the viral loads in liver and lungs showed full viral clearance at day 21 post infection. the absence of either TLR or RLR signaling had no influence on the protective capacity of immunization with MVA. NK cells are known to play a major role in mediating resistance to ECTV infections in mice [50]\u2013[52] and indeed, NK cells infiltrating the lungs of mice early after i.n. MVA inoculation. passive immunization with vaccinia immune globulin around the day of infection fully protects mice against lethal mousepox. antibodies are found in the respiratory tract early after intranasal inoculation with MVA. vaccinated RAG-1/ mice all succumbed to the ECTV challenge infection. analysis of VACV specific CD8+ T cell responses elicited by MVA immunization in JHT mice showed levels of VACV specific CD8+ CD62low T cells comparable to those induced in C57BL/6 wt mice. thus, we depleted C57BL/6 mice of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells or both T cell subsets by i.p. injection of specific antibodies. both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are required to rapidly protect mice by MVA vaccination. lack of CD4+ T cells resulted only in a minor reduction of IgG antibody responses. the CD4 cell depleted mice were clearly able to mount levels of VACV-specific antibodies that were just about two fold lower than responses obtained in control mice. weight loss of individual mice was monitored daily (n = 2 to 6 per group) weight loss of individual mice was monitored daily (n = 2 to 6 per group) in all experiments weight loss of individual mice was monitored daily (n = 2 to 6 per group) transfer of nave CD3+ spleen cells into RAG-1/ mice restores rapid protection by MVA vaccination. groups of RAG-1/ mice that received nave CD3+ spleen cells served as mock-challenged () or mock-vaccinated () controls. cytotoxic effector molecule perforin plays a dominant role in rapid protection mediated by MVA. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells exert different effector functions to control infections. study showed cell-mediated cytotoxicity and especially perforin is important for recovery from ECTV infection. histopathologic examination revealed multiple randomly located foci of necrosis and inflammation in the liver of vaccinated and ECTV challenged Prf/ mice. these lesions were characterized by hepatocytic necrosis and infiltration by macrophages and lymphocytes. however, MVA immunized wt mice had no necrotic and inflammatory lesions in liver tissues. thus, the availability of the cytotoxic effector protein perforin was essential to maintain ECTV challenged prf/ (upper panel) or wt mice at day 12 p.i. tissues were stained with hematoxilin and eosin (HE) micrographs show representative areas of liver tissue. the rapid protective capacity of i.n. MVA immunization was compared with i.m. MVA immunization using 108 PFU (Figure 8A,B), as well as with i.d. vaccination with 106 PFU of VACV strain Elstree. control C57BL/6 wt mice were fully protected by vaccination two days before the lethal respiratory challenge infection with ECTV. C57BL/6 mice depleted of CD4 and CD8 T cells were vaccinated with 108 PFU MVA intranasally (i.n.) or intramuscularly (i.m.) with 106 PFU VACV Elstree (i.d.) at two days before the 3LD50 ECTV challenge infection. ukocytes in the infected lung sections compared to lung sections of mock inoculations with PBS. bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) at different time-points after i.n. administration of MVA. we characterized the infiltrated leukocytes by bronchoalveolar lavages at different time-points. MVA is expected to produce a fully conserved N-terminal part of the B8 protein containing the peptide epitope B8R20\u201327. proportionally high numbers of activated VACV (B8R20\u201327 epitope)-specific CD8+ T cells in BAL liquids by day 5 p. i., but relatively lower numbers of VACV-specific CD8+ T cells in the spleen. interferon in CD8+ CD62Llow spleen cells from individual mice (n = 6), or BAL cells pooled from 3 to 5 mice (mean SD from three independent experiments) stimulated with VACV specific B8R20\u201327 or control peptides (LacZ876) at 3, 5 and 7 days post MVA immunization. results indicate early local immune responses induced after in vivo MVA inoculation arecharacterized by powerful innate responses. unvaccinated control mice started to show signs of morbidity (body weight loss) at about 6 days after challenge infection, and all died within 11 days. analysis of the viral loads in liver and lungs showed full viral clearance at day 21 post infection. this sensing is achieved via toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) [44]. NK cells are known to play a major role in mediating resistance to ECTV infections in mice [50]\u2013[52] passive immunization with vaccinia immune globulin around the day of infection fully protects mice against lethal mousepox [53], indicating antibodies are the important players in adaptive immunity. vaccinated RAG-1/ mice all succumbed to the ECTV challenge infection, confirming the importance of adaptive responses in rapid protection. analysis of VACV specific CD8+ T cell responses elicited by MVA immunization in JHT mice showed levels of VACV specific CD8+ CD62low T cells comparable to those induced in C57BL/6 wt mice. we confirmed successful depletion by FACS analysis at the time point of MVA immunization (day 0) and at day 7 after vaccination. CD4+ T cell depletion in immunized animals also resulted in 100% mortality within 21 days post challenge. this data clearly suggested that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are required to rapidly protect mice by MVA vaccination. mice depleted of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were challenged with 3LD50 ECTV. weight loss of individual mice was monitored daily (n = 2 to 6 per group) weight loss of individual mice was monitored daily (n = 2 to 6 per group) the transfer of nave CD3+ spleen cells into RAG-1/ mice restores rapid protection by MVA vaccination. the transfer of T cells prior to vaccination was fully sufficient to protect RAG-1/ mice against lethal infection. control RAG-1/ mice all died despite MVA immunization. weight loss of individual mice was monitored daily (n = 3 to 6 per group) error bars indicate SEMs, and the numbers of surviving/total animals are given in parentheses. livers of vaccinated and ECTV challenged Prf/ mice contained reduced virus loads in comparison to mock vaccinated Prf/ mice. this observation appeared to correlate with the somewhat prolonged course of disease in vaccinated animals (not statistically significant) ECTV challenged prf/ mice at day 12 p.i.. lung and liver were removed, homogenized, and the amount of virus was determined by plaque assay. Error bars indicate SEMs and data are representative of at least two independent experiments. the rapid protective capacity of i.n. MVA immunization was compared with i.m. MVA immunization using 108 PFU (Figure 8A,B), as well as with i.d. vaccination with 106 PFU of VACV strain Elstree. the morbidity profiles of vaccinated, vaccinated animals were comparable to mock-vaccinated controls. C57BL/6 mice or C57BL/6 mice depleted of CD4 and CD8 T cells were vaccinated with 108 PFU MVA intranasally (i.n.) or intramuscularly (i.m.), or (C) by scarification (i.d.) with 106 PFU VACV Elstree (i.d.) at two days before the 3LD50 ECTV challenge infection. post-exposure immunizations can not prevent the onset of severe mousepox disease. this feature clearly hampers the definition of immune correlates for MVA vaccine mediated rapid protection. we chose the pre-exposure immunization model for this study. antigen-specific immune responses can be detected in the respiratory tract at early times after immunization. this supports the hypothesis that early local priming of antigen-specific T cells may occur. this is possibly associated with MVA-induced formation of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue. concomitant type I interferon receptor triggering on T cells and DC has been shown to allow for optimal expansion of MVA induced CD8 T cell responses. this observation already indicated differences in the modes of immune defense when comparing rapidly protective primary immunization, protection against secondary infection, and overcoming a primary ECTV infection. this latter scenario is wellcharacterized in C57BL/6 mice that resist foot-pad infections known to be lethal in more susceptible mouse strains. vaccinia immune globulin is effective in post-exposure treatment of lethal orthopoxvirus infections. vaccinia immune globulin is effective in post-exposure treatment of lethal orthopoxvirus infections. depletion of CD4+ or/and CD8+ T cells completely abrogated protective capacity of immunization against the respiratory ECTV challenge. CD8+ T cells have been found essential for maintaining a robust or protective cytotoxic T cell memory response upon vaccination with recombinant VACV expressing lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein. the possibility that clearance of ECTV cannot be accomplished because of the absence of T helper cell dependent antibody responses appears unlikely in the view of the fact that CD4-depleted animals still mounted substantial levels of VACV-specific antibodies. new vaccines elicit more effective T cell mediated immunity. all experiments were approved by the government of the state of Hesse. all experiments were approved by the government of upper Bavaria.
