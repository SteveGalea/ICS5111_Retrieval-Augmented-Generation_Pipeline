{"summary": "the cost of developing a new pharmaceutical has increased by 145% since 2003[1]. failure may be due to adverse events or an inability to detect beneficial effects on the target disease. failure is often due to the choice of inadequate endpoints, or poor trial design. the most suitable endpoints that best reflect the effect of a treatment on acute viral infections should be related to viral load. the models are most useful for the planning of phase I studies, but more general conclusions can also be drawn for phase II and III studies. infection-related quantities can be derived from a simple viral dynamics model that can improve the assessment of therapy against acute viral diseases. Fig 1. Schematic illustration of key infection-related quantities that define the course of acute viral infections. all volunteers were screened for HI titre to exclude pre-existing immunity against the challenge strain. we used the parameters to determine the infection-related quantities for each patient. compared to the 95% credible intervals of individual parameter estimates, the variation among patients in the infection-related quantities shown in Table 2 is relatively small. the greatest variation occurs in peak viral load (CV = 1.26) and viral load area under the curve (CV = 1.19). patient number #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 #6 #7 #8 #9 Basic reproductive ratio (R0) 2.33[1.279, 4.026] 4.00[2.497, 15.29] 5.52[2.451, 43.76] 9.60[5.309, 21.85] 6.00[4.170, 8.987] 2.10[1.079, 6.483] 2.78[1.840, 4.092] 1.63[1.240, 2.428] 4.36[2.717, 7.321] Area 438369] 74352[17677, 339935] 4592[1112, 22092] 2535[816, 9361] 14175[3817, 54851] 1507[489, 7210] 49530[11883, 206486] 250118[54944, 1154068] 70852[69555, 71654] Time to peak viral load (days) 2.18[1.907, 2.488] 2.02[0.778, 2.337] three additional correlations were significant: R0 and total symptom score AUC. fraction of dead cells at the end of infection and duration of infection. generation time and initial viral growth rate depend on each other via viral dynamics model. 0.497 0.227 0.0170 AUCT 0.5782 0.143 0.0747 0.251 0.957 0.0739 0.734 0.0993 0.0903 R0 0.8613 0.5287 0.121 0.0145 0.0627 0.119 0.0282 0.238 0.0725 1.07E-4 * AUCV -0.5203 -0.6204 -0.5544 0.0312 0.973 1.28E-11 * 0.524 0.536 8.21E-5 * 0.0333 FDC our analysis is limited by the small sample size which, however, is not unusual in studies fitting viral dynamics models. our estimates of the basic reproductive number tend to be lower than previously reported results [11,15] we found that R0 has a significant positive correlation with the duration of infection and the total symptom score AUC. peak viral load correlates positively with the late viral decay rate. this suggests that infections with a high peak viral load tend to decline rapidly after the peak (intense, but short infection) treatments acting on virus clearance have a weaker effect on the course of infection, if given before the time of peak viral load (a, b) they reduce peak viral load, duration of infection and viral load area under the curve (AUC) our model suggests it will be difficult to detect the impact of a treatment that acts on the infection rate or viral production rate. when treatments that act on the virus clearance rate are given before the time of peak viral load, they slow down viral growth and reduce the viral load peak and AUC. the viral load AUC is the infection-related quantity that varies most among individuals. the same consideration holds for the peak viral load which is also highly variable. the duration of infection should be considered as an endpoint. the lower the measurement error and the higher the sensitivity of an assay, the more accurate the data. this can be achieved by running replicate measurements at each step of the assay on the same sample and from different samples taken from the same patient at one time point. the half-life of cells infected by different strains can also be measured using common apoptosis and cytotoxicity markers. these experiments may not be cheap, and may be rather complex. in order to supplement and validate data obtained from tissue culture systems, animal models may prove useful."}
