{"summary": "NSDV belongs to genus Nairovirus of the family Bunyaviridae. it causes severe disease characterised by fever and haemorrhagic gastroenteritis in sheep and goats with a mortality rate up to 90% in a susceptible population [1], [2]. NSDV is closely related to a human pathogen, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), which causes viral haemorrhagic gastroenteritis CCHFV is the second most widespread of the arboviruses pathogenic to humans. the disease is similar to that caused in sheep and goats by NSDV infection [2], [29]. NSDV may act as a suitable model to study haemorrhagic nairoviruses. newly synthesised virions bud into the Golgi and are transported to the plasma membrane. the virions exit the infected cell after fusion of the carrier vesicle with the plasma membrane. nairoviruses would be expected to affect the secretory pathway. cells were cultured in Glasgow Modified Eagle's Medium (GMEM) containing 10% foetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin sulphate (100 mg/ml), 2 mM L-glutamine and 5% tryptose phosphate broth. NSDVi (IG619, TVPII 236) is a pathogenic GV isolate. plasmids were grown in Escherichia coli DH5 and DNA was purified using CsCl gradients. the pCAGGs_MCSII_V5 construct was generated by insertion of V5 tag sequence into the multiple cloning site (MCS) of pCAGGS-MCSII. pcDNA-GV-M fragments were then inserted upstream of, and in frame with, the V5-tag of pCAGGs_MCSII_V5. bacterially expressed proteins consisting of the first 167 amino acids of the viral N protein were used by a commercial company to immunise four rabbits. gG (H+L), Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L), Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rat IgG (H+L) and Zenon Rabbit IgG Labelling Kit were purchased from Life Technologies. rats anti-p102 antibody (clone 23C) was prepared by the Institute of Cancer Research. antibody to ERp57 has been described previously. vero cells were fixed with 3% PFA, blocked for 30 min with 0.2% porcine gelatine and incubated with primary antibody against PDI or ERp57. such permeabilised cells were incubated with anti-NSDV antibodies and then proteins were visualised with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies. initial confocal images were obtained using sequential scanning and DMIRE2 Leica CLSM TCS-SP2 confocal laser scanning microscope. immunoprecipitated proteins were analysed by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting using specific antibodies. cells were harvested and lysed with 100 l of 1x SDS sample buffer. cell culture was carried out as previously described. cell line CJE102 was the kind gift of Dr Nathalie Vachi\u00e9ry, D\u00e9partement EMVT du CIRAD, Domaine de Duclos, Prise d'Eau, 97170 Petit Bourg, Guadeloupe. the cells were cultured in Glasgow Modified Eagle's Medium (GMEM) containing 10% foetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin sulphate (100 mg/ml), pCAGGs_MCSII_V5 was generated by amplification of appropriate fragments of the GV (i.e. NSDVi) M ORF via PCR, preGn (nucleotides 1-2310 of GV M ORF), NSM (nucleotides 2248-2781) or PreGc (nucleotides 2719-4872), using specific primers. bacterially expressed proteins consisting of the first 167 amino acids of the viral N protein or the first 169 amino acids of the viral L protein were used by a commercial company to immunise four rabbits. mouse monoclonal recognising the denatured form of the preGn glycoprotein from NSDVi, but not from NSDVu, was obtained from AbMart. JE cells were plated at an initial seeding density of 4 x104 cells/well. the virus inoculum was removed after one hour, cells were washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fresh medium was added. all transfections were carried out with TransIT-LT1 (Mirus) according to manufacturer's instructions. immunoprecipitated proteins were analysed by sodium dodecyl sulphate gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting using specific antibodies. cells were cultured in 12-well plates containing 0.5 ml of growth medium per well. NSDV-infected cells show reduced levels of PDI and ERp57. the structure of the ER, ERGIC and Golgi remains unchanged. two isolates of NSDV have been previously described by us. infected cells were detected using rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the viral N protein (which recognises both NSDVi and NSDVu isolates) the distribution of the cellular proteins was compared in infected and uninfected cells by confocal microscopy. similar results were observed for cis and transGolgi compartments. NSDV replication has no obvious effect on the ERGIC and Golgi. cells were infected with the NSDVi isolate at a MOI of 0.3 TCID50. after 16 h, cells were fixed using 3% PFA followed by ice-cold methanol. NSDV-infected cells show reduced level of PDI and ERp57 in the ER. the distribution of ERp57, another soluble chaperone of the PDI-like family, was also studied. many infected cells even appear to lose PDI entirely. rabbit anti-ERp57 IgGs were labelled with Zenon Alexa Fluor 488 rabbit IgG labelling reagent (green) and rabbit anti-N IgGs were labelled with Zenon Alexa Fluor 594 rabbit IgG labelling reagent (red) bars correspond to 40 m. the overall structure of the ER remains unchanged in NSDV-infected cells. PDI and ERp57 appear not to be degraded in NSDV-infected cells. PDI and ERp57 appear at the surface of many NSDV-infected cells. vero cells infected with NSDVi at a low MOI were fixed and then incubated with anti-PDI or anti-ERp57 antibody without permeabilization. cells were then permeabilised with ice-cold methanol and incubated with rabbit anti-NSDVi preGn serum or with mouse anti-NSDVi PreGn. cells were labelled with mouse anti-PDI (clone 1D3; a\u2013c), mouse anti-PDI (d\u2013f) or rabbit anti-ERp57 (g\u2013i) after fixing with 3% PFA, cells were again fixed with 3% PFA. proteins were visualised by co-staining with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (green) and Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (red) NSDV replication and/or assembly induces movement of proteins from the ER to the cell surface in infected cells. similar changes to the distribution of PDI upon infection with NSDV were also observed in a549 cells and in a bovine foetal endothelial cell line (BFA) this confirmed that redistribution of PDI during NSDV infection is not Vero cell-specific. NSDVi-infected cells were studied at different times post infection to determine when during infection changes to the distribution of PDI appear. first changes to PDI distribution could be observed at 8 hpi, when a few cells showed a reduced amount of PDI in the ER or at the surface. vero cells were infected with the NSDVi isolate at a MOI of 6 TCID50. for internal staining (a\u2013i) cells were fixed with 3% PFA followed by ice cold methanol. cells were again fixed with 3% PFA, opened with ice-cold methanol. infected cells may reflect the apparent non-equimolar amount of the three viral RNA segments found previously in number of bunyaviruses [40], [71]\u2013[73]. PDI is a soluble protein which is thought to be retained at the cell surface through non-covalent interactions [70], [74], and the secretion of PDI has been observed from a number of cell types. proteins were separated on acrylamide SDS-PAGE gels. cellular and viral proteins were detected by Western blotting using antibodies to PDI (clone RL90), ERp57, the viral N protein, calnexin (CNX) or -tubulin. it is therefore possible that the viral glycoproteins may be involved in the redistribution of PDI/ERp57 in infected cells. cells were co-stained with rabbit anti-ERp57 and mouse anti-PreGn antibodies followed by co-staining with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (green) after 48 h, cells were harvested and proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using mouse anti-PDI (clone RL90) antibody and protein G-agarose beads. plasmids encoding preGn, NSM and preGc were constructed. each protein was in frame with a carboxy-terminal V5 epitope tag. plasmid-expressed PreGn-V5 was found in ER and cisGolgi. in some cells over-accumulation of PreGn-V5 appeared to change the morphology of the ER. the cells in which PreGn-V5 was found only in the Golgi (i.e. cells which expressed PreGn at a very low level) no change to PDI was observed. NSDV-infected cells show reduced levels of PDI and ERp57. the structure of the ER, ERGIC and Golgi remains unchanged. two isolates of NSDV have been previously described by us. infected cells were fixed and stained with antibodies specific for ERGIC (ERGIC53), cisGolgi (GM130) or transGolgi (p102) markers. infected cells were detected using rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the viral N protein. the distribution of the cellular proteins was compared in infected and uninfected cells by confocal microscopy. NSDV-infected cells were infected with the NSDVi isolate at a MOI of 0.3 TCID50. after 16 h, cells were fixed using 3% PFA followed by ice-cold methanol. NSDV replication has no obvious effect on the ERGIC and Golgi. NSDV-infected cells show reduced level of PDI and ERp57 in the ER. many infected cells even appear to lose PDI entirely. the distribution of ERp57 was also studied in NSDV-infected cells. proteins were visualised by co-staining with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (green) and Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (red) except for g\u2013i, where rabbit anti-ERp57 IgGs were labelled with Zenon Alexa Fluor 488 rabbit IgG labelling reagent (green) bars correspond to 40 m. PDI and ERp57 appear not to be degraded in NSDV-infected cells. PDI and ERp57 appear at the surface of many NSDV-infected cells. this is not a reflection of overall loss from the cell. surface labelling of lightly fixed cells and confocal microscopy. to detect PDI and ERp57 at the surface, vero cells infected with NSDVi at a low MOI were fixed and then incubated with anti-PDI or anti-ERp57 antibody without permeabilization. after washing away unbound antibodies, cells were again fixed with 3% PFA to ensure that any PDI/ERp57 and bound antibodies remained attached to the cell surface. PDI and ERp57 appear at the surface of NSDV-infected cells. cells were labelled with mouse anti-PDI (clone 1D3; a\u2013c), mouse anti-PDI (clone RL90; d\u2013f) or rabbit anti-ERp57 (g\u2013i) after fixing with 3% PFA, cells were again fixed with 3% PFA, opened with ice-cold methanol. surface PDI detected in NSDV-infected cells is not an artefact of the staining procedure. disappearance of PDI/ERp57 from the ER suggests NSDV replication and/or assembly induces movement of these proteins from the ER to the cell surface. similar changes to the distribution of PDI upon infection with NSDV (either NSDVi or NSDVu) were also observed in a bovine foetal endothelial cell line proteins were visualised by Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (green) and Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (red) bars correspond to 40 m; arrows in \u201ca\u201d and \u201cd\u201d indicate infected cells. NSDVi-infected cells were studied at different times post infection to determine when during infection changes to the distribution of PDI appear. at 8 hpi, only a few cells showed detectable viral N protein. at 12 hpi, at which time progeny virus can be detected [29], cells with very different amounts of N were observed. this apparent variation in the extent of virus replication may be due to variation in the virions themselves. differential expression of the N and PreGn proteins in NSDV-infected cells may reflect the apparent non-equimolar amount of the three viral RNA segments found previously in number of bunyaviruses [40], [71]\u2013[73]. PDI is a soluble protein which is thought to be retained at the cell surface through non-covalent interactions [70], [74]. vero cells were infected with the NSDVi isolate at a MOI of 0.1 TCID50. proteins were separated on acrylamide SDS-PAGE gels and cellular and viral proteins were detected by Western blotting using specific antibodies to PDI (clone RL90), ERp57, the viral N protein, calnexin (CNX) or -tubulin. transmembrane regions and signalase cleavage sites were predicted using TMHMM Server v. 2.0 and Signal. cells were co-stained with rabbit anti-ERp57 and mouse anti-PreGn antibodies. six hydrophobic regions TM0 (N-terminal), TM1 (631-653 aa), TM2 (751-773 aa), TM3 (786-803 aa), TM4 (907-928 aa) and TM5 (1524-1546 aa) were predicted with signalase cleavage sites just after the hydrophobic sequences of TM0 (1920 aa), TM2 (770771 aa) and cells which expressed PreGn-V5 lost PDI from the ER. expression of preGn-V5 or NSM-V5 had no apparent effect on PDI distribution. after 24 h, cells were fixed with 3% PFA followed by ice-cold methanol. cells were stained using mouse anti-PDI (a\u2013i) or anti-calnexin (j\u2013l) antibodies. mouse anti-V5 antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (red) olisation of the cytoplasm has been observed by electron microscopy in NSDV-infected cells [35] it is possible that changes to the Golgi observed by electron microscopy are not extensive enough to be detected by confocal microscopy. the findings agree with the absence of changes to the Golgi observed in cells infected with CCHFV or Hantaan virus (HTNV; a hantavirus) [77]. it is currently unknown whether KUNV selectively redistributes PDI or also affects other ER proteins. despite changes to the ER, no major effect on the Golgi structure was found by immunofluorescence in KUNV-infected cells. cells, PDI, ERp57, and colligin were redistributed from the ER to the ERGIC. redistribution of these ER soluble proteins was also observed in cells containing plasmid-expressed viral protein pXP124L. this suggests that these ER proteins are not physically redistributed due to wrapping of the ASFV progeny virions in the ER. virus-induced PDI appears to diminish PDI secretion. it is unlikely that virus-induced UPR is the cause of the PDI redistribution observed. it is possible that bound preGn makes PDI not available for KDEL receptor. a system which prevented fusion of newly synthesised virions with intracellular membranes prior to virus egress would be of benefit. extracellular PDI, with its potential for rearranging disulphide bonds within viral glycoproteins, is thought to aid during virus entry. the virus benefits by inducing PDI release from cells because the PDI is required for virus entry. integrins are known to take part in cell-cell interactions promoting cell migration and vasodilation. secreted PDI could also activate integrins at the surface of various uninfected cells, including endothelial cells and platelets. extracellular PDI has been shown to activate tissue factor (TF) [112], inducing intravascular coagulation. redistribution of PDI from the ER of NSDV-infected cells may play a crucial role in the pathogenicity of NSDV. PDI may enhance virus infection or contribute to the observed haemorrhagic outcome of the infection. PDI has become a popular potential drug target for treatment of thrombosis, neurodegenerative diseases and HIV infection. boxes in a\u2013c and g\u2013i indicate the source of the enlarged areas shown in d\u2013f and j\u2013l respectively.
