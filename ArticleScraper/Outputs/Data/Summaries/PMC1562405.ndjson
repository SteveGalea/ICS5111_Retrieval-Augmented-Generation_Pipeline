{"summary": "a nested case-control analysis was performed to assess risk factors for acquiring SARS-CoV infection. the highest attack rates occurred among nurses who worked in the outpatient and inpatient general wards (57.1, 47.4%, respectively) staff at a small private health care facility, Hospital A, in Hanoi began to fall ill after caring for a business traveler recently arrived from Hong Kong. he received care for 4 days in the general medical ward and 4 days in the intensive care unit. on march 5th, he was transferred to a facility in Hong Kong where he died one week later. case-control study designed to identify risk-factors for acquiring SARS-CoV infection after admission of the index patient. the primary objectives were to ascertain the extent of SARS-CoV transmission among the clinical and non-clinical staff at the hospital. participants were asked to complete a short, self-administered questionnaire. questionnaires were translated into Vietnamese and responses were back-translated into English. questions were simplified to minimize translation errors and to facilitate self-administration. study cases were defined as persons having: (i) the presence of SARS-CoV antibody in at least one serum specimen collected prior to March 24th; (ii) for SARS cases confirmed by means of serologic testing. the estimated 6 day incubation period plus a 12 day interval to seroconversion is based on the observed median number of days from exposure to illness onset among persons in Vietnam. the date of seroconversion is known within 48 hours (n = 17) this time frame is expected to exclude individuals who contracted infection from someone other than the index. the timing of illness onset alone was insufficient as a case selection criterion for the case-control study. controls were defined as individuals within the study cohort who were never identified as SARS cases. was hospitalized included as study cases. non-cases demonstrated to be negative for SARS-CoV antibody at least 18 days after last exposure to the index patient. participants were asked about whether they had engaged in a series of activities relating to exposure to the index patient. questions were simplified in order to minimize translation errors and ensure that the activities would apply for multiple different staff job categories. subjects were asked whether they ever came within 1 meter of the index patient, and whether they ever did so without a mask (respirator) a case-control study was performed to determine which work-related activities may have been associated with contracting SARS-CoV infection after admission of the index case. study cases were defined as persons having: (i) the presence of SARS-CoV antibody in at least one serum specimen collected prior to March 24th, the last day the index patient received care at Hospital A. non-parametric tests (Fisher's exact, Cochran's Chi-square) or odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess differences between groups using negative responses as the referent. underlying medical conditions were not significant correlates of case status in this outbreak. staff position Hospital A employees SARS cases* Attack rate Deaths Completed survey Serologic specimen Enrolled workers with positive serologic result Direct patient care Physician 29 8 27.6 4 17 (58.6) 19 (65.5) 7 (36.8) Midwife 10 4 40.0 0 9 (90.0) 8 (80.0) 4 (50.0) Nurse (gen.ward) 19 9 47.4 2 16 (84.2) 19 (100) 10 (52.6) 2 new Nurse (Op.Rm./ICU) 14 1 7.1 4 of the 36 initially identified SARS cases during the outbreak did not have serological confirmation. positive serologic results are listed as 'new' if the individual was not recognized as a symptomatic case during the outbreak, but was found to be seropositive during the course of this study. index patient was ill during the first apparent wave of the outbreak. attack rates were highest among personnel with direct patient care responsibilities. nursing staff at Hospital A who were assigned to the operating Room had significantly lower attack rates. staff position Completed Survey n (%) No. surveyed who reported working No. scheduled to work* Agreement (%) Midwife (n = 10) 9 (90) 9 8 88.9 Nurse (Op.Rm./ICU) (n = 14) 7 (50) 6 6 100 Housekeeper (n = 16) 16 (100) 15 16 93.8 Receptionist (n = 10) 9 (90) 9 7 77.8 Security (n = 8) 7 (87.5) 7 7 100 Total ia, chills, anorexia, headache, headache, cough were the most frequently reported symptoms experienced by SARS infected staff at Hospital A. symptoms occurred in over half of SARS cases, and all occurred at levels significantly above those reported by uninfected staff. only diarrhea, sore throat, and rash were not reported at higher frequencies than uninfected staff. neither the laundry worker nor the receptionist reported having experienced symptoms significantly associated with SARS illness in Vietnam. the second also reported headache along with myalgia, chills, dizziness, anorexia, and vomiting. diarrhea was common among all Hospital A workers. 0.9\u20138.5 0.085 9 (41) 9 (20) Talked to or touched index patient without mask (ever) 0.6\u20135.9 0.363 7 (32) 9 (20) Came within 1 meter of index patient 9.3 2.8\u201330.9 0.001 17 (77) 12 (27) Came within 1 meter of index patient, without mask (ever) 5.4 1.8\u201316.3 0.003 14 (64) 11 (24) Spoke with index patient 3.5 1.2\u201310.4 0.028 11 193 individuals were employed at Hospital A at the time of the SARS outbreak. 81% of cases occurred among clinical personnel with direct patient care or ancillary clinical roles. 19% of cases occurred among housekeepers and other cleaning staff.
