{"summary": "pathogen detection capabilities hosted on Pathosphere were tested by analyzing pathogen-containing samples sequenced by NGS with both spiked human samples as well as human and zoonotic host backgrounds. pathogen detection capabilities were limited in detection of sequences with limited homology to previous annotations within NCBI databases, such as parvovirus. electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12859-015-0840-5) contains supplementary material."}
