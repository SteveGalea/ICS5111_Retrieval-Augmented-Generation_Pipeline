{"summary": "human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a paramyxovirus known to cause acute respiratory tract infections in children and young adults. there is no study from the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia determining the proportion and severity of hMPV infection among pediatric hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections. hMPV is a single-stranded RNA-enveloped virus classified in the order Mononegavirales, family Pneumoviridae, genus Metapneumovirus and species hMPV. hMPV infections have been reported in australia,[3] canada,[4] the united states,[5] the United Kingdom,[6] Hong Kong,[7] South Africa,[8] Mexico,[9] Spain and Peru. hMPV has been associated with bronchitis, pneumonia and exacerbations of both bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. in adults, hMPV has been associated with bronchitis, pneumonia and flu-like illness. aseer central hospital is the largest tertiary care referral hospital in the region. data such as age, gender, clinical presentation and current medications were collected using an objectively prepared questionnaire. the cell suspension was washed several times with PBS and the final cell deposit was resuspended in 2 mL PBS (pH 7.5) the cells were then gently agitated by pipetting up and down until the cellular material was released from the mucus. additional PBS was added until a smooth suspension was obtained and any visible flecks of mucus were removed. stained slides were immediately examined under epifluorescence microscope at 400 and then 1000. images of these cells were captured using a microscopic camera. samples were transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing 1 mL of phosphate\u2013buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.5) the specimens were gently vortexed for 30 s to reduce the viscosity and dilute the mucus. the supernatant was removed, and the cells in the pellets were used for DFA staining. l of IMAGENTM hMPV reagent (Oxoid Ltd., Cambridge, UK) contains monoclonal antibodies against hMPV conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate. the slides were then incubated with the reagent in a moist chamber for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. the slide was gently washed in an agitating bath containing PBS. positive cases for human metapneumovirus as detected by direct fluorescent antibody test in hospitalized children. hMPV-positive patients Specimen ID Age (years + months) Gender Underlying illness Temperature (\u00b0C) Respiratory rate (BPM) Pulse rate (beats/ min) BP (mmHg) O2 saturation (room air) (%) CBC Duration of stay (days) Diagnosis 3 1 + 4 Female None 39 76/min ( hMPV antigens were detected not only in patients from Abha, but among those from its bordering areas. three of the nine positive cases were found from abha (33.3%). one positive case from each of the previously mentioned six cities was reported (11.1%) in the aseer region of Saudi Arabia, about 10% of hospitalization among pediatrics with respiratory tract infections was due to hMPV infections. hMPV infections were associated with presentation of acute respiratory symptoms, thereby highlighting the role of the infection in complicating the course of the disease. the current study did not find any gender predilection in terms of the infections. all nine hMPV-positive children were from abha or its surrounding areas. almost 78% of the hMPV-positive cases were in children who had been admitted during the autumn and winter seasons. financial support and sponsorship This study was funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research, King Khalid University, Saudi Arabia, Research Grant no. 3."}
