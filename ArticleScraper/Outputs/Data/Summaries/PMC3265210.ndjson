{"summary": "FCoV contains a positive polarity RNA genome approximately 29 kb in length. four ORFs encode the structural proteins S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid), and five ORFs encode the nonstructural proteins 3a, 3b, 3c, 7a, and 7b. FECV cannot be distinguished by their antigenicity, or even by genome sequence analysis. a second hypothesis for the development of FIP proposes that any FCoV strain can cause FIP disease. instead, host factors, such as immune response variations, and viral factors, determine whether or not FIP develops. FECV was shown to contain a 238-nucleotide deletion in ORF7b. it is possible that both FECV and avirulent FIPV strains are derived from FIP inducing strains but have been attenuated by the loss of virulence factors. recombination of two attenuated viruses during a rare mixed infection event could result in the resurgence of a virulent strain. b seems to provide a distinct selective advantage during natural infection [21]. nonsense mutations within ORF3c and specific mutations in OFR7b are present in FIPVs but not in FECVs. virulence-associated ORF7b may be suppressed in FECVs not adapted to tissue culture. the authors concluded that there must be a causal relationship between the occurrence of these mutations and the increased incidence of FIP in this population [24]. authors have proposed that mutations in other genomic regions might be responsible for the variation in virulence observed in FCoV strains. FECV, Dye and Siddell compared complete sequences of viral RNA samples from a cat with classical FIP. fecal samples of FIPV may be present as a result of extensive intestinal lesions, which could explain the presence of the FIPV in the jejunum. IPV-UCD10 were found to have high sequence identity with each other and with FECV-RM and induced FIP when inoculated intraperitoneally in specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats persistently infected by FECV rarely develop FIP. failure to control FCoV replication could lead to an increase in viral load, thus increasing the chances that a pathogenic mutation will be generated. quasispecies formation has been well documented for murine hepatitis virus (MHV) in the coronaviruses. the emergence of highly virulent FIPV biotypes from FECV is accompanied by a dramatic change in cell tropism that allows FIPV to infect monocytes and then be disseminated systemically. these cells are the most predominant inflammatory cells in FIP lesions [40] and viral antigens can be detected in macrophages isolated from pyogranulomatous lesions. the decrease of CD4 T cells and, especially, CD8 T cells, as a result of apoptosis is probably related to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) released by macrophages infected with FCoV. a study in vivo showed that a small percentage of cats in FCoV endemic households had no shedding and remained seronegative or had a low antibody titer over a time period of 5 years [46] an ineffective immune response against FCoV infection seems to be an important factor in FIP pathogenesis. a strong humoral immune system plays an adverse role in the development of FIP. cats infected with FCoV, but without clinical signs of FIP, generally exhibit B and T cells hyperplasia with high lymphocyte proliferation [53\u201355] and exhibit higher expression levels of feline interleukin- (IL-) 10 in the spleen. IL-6 is involved in the development of immune-complex-mediated vasculitis and, therefore, in FIP pathogenesis. lymphoid depletion is likely due to apoptosis, probably mediated by TNF-alpha release, infected macrophages, and significantly decreased IL-12 p40 expression. IL-12 and interferon-gamma coordinate link between pathogen recognition by innate immune cells and induction of specific immunity. asymptomatic cats of same study failed to upregulate TNF-alpha mRNA. TNF-alpha mRNA response tends to favor Th2 immunity (humoral), while the IFN-gamma mRNA response favors Th1 immunity [62] in FCoV-endemic cattery without a case of FIP the percentage of clinically healthy FCoV-positive cats expressing IFN-gamma is significantly high. catteries with endemic FCoV have strong CMI as measured by serum IFN gamma production. APP is plasma proteins produced by hepatocytes during systemic inflammation. the major feline APP is 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) [66]. virulent and avirulent strains circulating among feline populations. phylogenetic analysis of partial sequences from ORFs M, S, 3c, and 7b. authors infer that FIPV and FECV form monophyletic groups. more studies are needed using sequences from different geographic regions. new viral strains present in these subpopulations can alter cell tropism and pathogenicity. it remains unclear if the association between genetic diversity and pathogenicity can be attributed to quasispecies dynamics. it is necessary to prove that natural selection acts on the viral population as a unit. FECV-like cell tropism by macrophages is also observed for FECV. cats that do not present with any clinical or pathological evidence of FIP can maintain viremia in their monocytes for a period of 3 to 12 months. a strong humoral immune system plays an adverse role in the development of FIP. the antibody titer, in FIPV infection, is not effective for elimination of the virus. the phenomenon antibody-dependent enhancement could explain this accelerated development of FIP in the presence of antibodies. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from FIP cats showed higher IL-6 expression compared to the same cells from SPF cats. this suggests that IL-6 is involved in the development of immune-complex-mediated vasculitis and, therefore, in FIP pathogenesis. IL-6 is negatively regulated by IL-10 [58]. IL-12 and IFN-gamma coordinate link between pathogen recognition by innate immune cells and induction of specific immunity. disease, regardless of form, is associated with a strong TNF-alpha mRNA response in PBMC and a failure to induce IFN-gamma mRNA. in FCoV-endemic cattery without a case of FIP the percentage of clinically healthy FCoV-positive cats expressing IFN-gamma is significantly high cytokine profiles that run on samples from tissues with relevant inflammatory lesions could reflect local cytokine response more adequately than in PBMC. cats naturally infected with FCoV, with clinical effusive FIP, had IFN-gamma concentrations in the effusions 40-fold higher than the serum concentrations of this cytokine in the same animals. the major feline APP is 1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) [66]. in humans AGP is overexpressed during systemic inflammatory responses and its function appears to be related to an immunomodulatory activity [65]. in cats with endemic FCoV all cats respond to increased viral burden by increasing the production of AGP. only cats with hyposialylated AGP have persistently increased AGP levels and develop FIP. despite efforts by the scientific community to understand FIP pathogenesis, this disease still remains an enigma. the causes underlying FIP pathogenesis are probably multifactorial, with both viral and host factors as well as viral genetic determinants playing important roles."}
