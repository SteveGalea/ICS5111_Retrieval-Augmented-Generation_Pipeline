{"summary": "adults were eligible if they were admitted to a study hospital, resided in the study catchment area, had clinical evidence of an acute respiratory infection, and had radiographic evidence of pneumonia. tracheostomy, gastrostomy, cystic fibrosis, cancer with neutropenia, solid organ or hematopoietic stem-cell transplant within the previous 90 days. occus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila (BinaxNow, Alere) were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of naso/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs. sputum was also tested for Legionella with a RT-PCR assay regardless of sputum quality. pleural fluid samples obtained as part of clinical care also underwent bacterial culturing. both MRSA and MSSA CAP were included in the S. aureus CAP group. this group included patients with other bacteria, viruses, fungi, mycobacteria, and unknown etiology. pneumococcal CAP was the most common bacterial CAP detected in adults. ted the number of S. aureus CAP cases by month during the study. clinical characteristics, antibiotics administered, and clinical outcomes were ascertained via patient interviews and medical chart abstractions. population Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria for the EPIC study cohort have been previously described. adults were eligible if they were admitted to a study hospital, resided in the study catchment area, had clinical evidence of an acute respiratory infection. patients with any of the following criteria were excluded. adenovirus, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus were also tested. both MRSA and MSSA CAP were included in the S. aureus CAP group. the comparison aimed to determine if MRSA CAP had clinical features distinctive enough to identify MRSA cases among a heterogeneous group of CAP patients. pneumococcal CAP was a subgroup of all-cause non-S. aureus CAP. clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared among the CAP etiology groups. compared with the pneumococcal and all-cause non-S. aureus groups. 37 (1.6%; 95% CI, 1.2, 2.3) patients identified as having S. aureus CAP. these cases included 21 with S. aureus cultured from blood, 13 from high-quality sputum, 6 from BAL, and 2 from pleural fluid. 4 patients had S. aureus cultured from multiple sample types. Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified in 115 (5.1%; 95% CI, 4.2, 6.1) patients. these detections included 26 by blood culture, 8 from high-quality sputum, 3 from BAL, 1 from pleural fluid, 56 by urine antigen. none of the 12 independently functioning nursing home residents were found to have MRSA, MSSA, or pneumococcal CAP. virus was the most common copathogen in S. aureus CAP, codetected in 3 (8.1%) cases. none of the codetections occurred in patients on chronic hemodialysis. among the 22 patients with MSSA CAP there were 11 codetections in 10 patients. among the 115 patients with pneumococcal CAP, there were 39 codetections in 35 patients. patients with S. aureus CAP, especially MRSA, tended to have higher severity scores than patients with non-S. aureus and pneumococcal CAP. 73.3% of MRSA and 45.2% of pneumococcal CAP patients had a PSI risk class 4 (P =.04) 1 (4.6) 4 (10.8) 14 (12.2) 234 (10.5) Other 1 (6.7) 0 1 (2.7) 3 (2.6) 92 (4.1) Medical conditions, n (%) Asthma 4 (26.7) 3 (13.6) 7 (18.9) 24 (20.9) 577 (26.0) Chronic heart failure 4 (26.7) 6 (27.3) 10 (27.0) 21 (18.3) 420 (18.9) Diabetes mellitus 7 (46.7) 8 (36.4) 15 (40.5) 23 (20.0 1523 (68.5) Cough with sputum production 8 (53.3) 8 (36.4) 16 (43.2) 69 (60.0) 1235 (55.6) Hemoptysis 2 (13.3) 3 (13.6) 5 (13.5) 13 (11.3) 192 (8.6) Shortness of breath 11 (73.3) 16 (72.7) 27 (73.0) 86 (74.8) 1733 (78.0) Chest pain 5 (33.3) 8 (36.4) 13 (35.1) 60 (52.2) 1100 (49.5 8.0 (34.6, 39.6) 37.0 (33.1, 41.0) 38.0 (34.1, 41.5) Median platelet count (IQR), 103 cells/L 168 (130, 305) 225 (194, 295) 219 (161, 295) 216 (165, 276) 237 (179, 306) Median blood urea nitrate concentration (IQR), mg/dL 34 (17, 62) 17 (11, 43) 29 (15, 43) 20 (13, 32) CURB-65IQR, confusion, blood urea nitrogen 20 mg/dL, respiratory rate 30, systolic blood pressure 90 mmHg, age 65 years;

S. aureus infection was uncommon among adults hospitalized with CAP. initial presentation of MRSA and MSSA CAP overlapped substantially with one another. overuse of antibiotics has been linked to several negative outcomes, including antibiotic resistance, medication-related toxicities, Clostridium difficile infections, and increased cost. the difficulty of identifying MRSA CAP based on epidemiologic and clinical features highlights the need for rapid diagnostic tests to help guide antibiotic selection. influenza was codetected in only 3 (8.1%) patients with S. aureus CAP. this pattern suggests that while S. aureus CAP may be more common during influenza peaks, the disease is not limited to patients with active influenza infection. nonenrolled patients were older, more likely to require invasive mechanical ventilation, and more likely to die in the hospital. detection of S. aureus was based on cultures of blood and respiratory secretions, which may have missed the presence of S. aureus at the site of disease pathology in the lung. low prevalence of MRSA combined with a lack of highly distinctive clinical features make accurate targeting of anti-MRSA antibiotics very difficult. development of diagnostic tests capable of rapidly and accurately identifying S. aureus could greatly improve the current approach to CAP management and reduce overuse of anti-MRSA antibiotics."}
