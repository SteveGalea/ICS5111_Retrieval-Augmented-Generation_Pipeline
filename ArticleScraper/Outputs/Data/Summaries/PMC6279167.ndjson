we were able to get our city council member to support our urban farms or urban ag(riculture type policies. participants from Australia and Brazil facilitated political support for EBNCDP. focusing resources on convincing a smaller number of individuals deemed likely to be sympathetic to NCD prevention was a more efficient use of limited resources. most participants were female (84%) and between 30 and 50 years old (70%). some college 0% (0) 0% (0) 6% (1) 0% (0) College degree 23% (3) 33% (3) 25% (5) 8% (1) Master\u2019s or more 69% (9) 67% (6) 30% (6) 92% (11) Missing 8% (1) 0% (0) 12% (2) 0% (0) Role Physician 0% (0) 0% (0) 30% (6) 0% (0) Department head 0% (0) 11% (1) 0% (0) 0% (0) 0% (0) 0% (0) 0% political ideologies X X X Lack of government support for evidence-based NCDb prevention X X Short-term funding opportunities vs. long-term health outcomes X X Unrealistic policy goals between national and local levels of government X Facilitators Strategic communications X X Cultivating champions in government and funding bodies X a Evidence-based non-communicable disease prevention. some pointed to changing political representation as a partial explanation for this volatility. 'we have a community that\u2019s big on the \u2018nanny\u2019 government thing, we still have Tea Party elected officials here and taxpayer associations that complain about pretty much everything, so they are really not interested in doing any kind of the policy work. we adhere to social norms that blame the victims for their poverty and poor health. politicians and policymakers tended to defer to doctors, a primary agent in the public health system in china. the long-term nature of NCD prevention made it a less attractive cause for political leaders who were looking for quicker wins that demonstrated their success in office. if there is a strong funding stream for non-communicable disease, the immediate issues such as heart attacks or meth use get the attention. it's going to cost the federal government around half a billion dollars per year to manage [new drugs for treating skin cancer] this is on top of skin cancer already being the most expensive burden to the health system of all cancers. short-term funding means organizations are jumping from one funding source to the next, which can impede continuity of programs and approaches. interviewees from china perceived that politicians set ambitious goals at the higher levels of government that could not be delivered on at the lower levels. some of the goals that the government at a higher level wants us to achieve cannot be achieved. one challenge is that some of the goals that the government at a higher level wants us to achieve cannot be achieved. some of the goals that the government at a higher level wants us to achieve cannot be achieved. participants from all four countries facilitated political support for EBNCDP. focusing resources on convincing a smaller number of individuals deemed likely to be

right for that sort of climate. we have a community that\u2019s big on the \u2018nanny\u2019 government thing. we adhere to social norms that blame the victims for their poverty and poor health. if a

investment. short-term funding means organizations are jumping from one funding source to the next, which can impede continuity of programs and approaches. the biggest barrier is being able to get investment that is over the longer-term, says interviewees. a top-down approach often created significant challenges for district, or local-level officials who implemented the policies. it led to the perceived misallocation of resources and frustration among frontline public health practitioners who felt like they were wasting their time and efforts on meeting goals that they felt were not appropriate or attainable. some of the goals that the government at a higher level wants us to achieve cannot be achieved. participants facilitated political support for EBNCDP through the identification and cultivation of champions or advocates in the policymaking space. focusing resources on convincing a smaller number of individuals deemed likely to be sympathetic to NCD prevention was a more efficient use of limited resources. interviewees from all countries except Brazil said funding was often short-term, which conflicts with the long-term nature of NCD prevention goals. this reality can be leveraged to make the case for additional support for NCD prevention and evidence-based practice through the construction of evidence-based stories. interviewees from china describe top-down system wherein national offices set health goals that may be unrealistic but that must be pursued by local public health offices. both australia and china suggest pressures and expectations from the top levels of public health and government can inhibit EBNCDP. practitioners who brought up policymakers perceptions that evidence was not always well suited to the particular nuances of a given context seemed to find this an insufficient reason. the shortcoming black identified among researchers may also apply to practitioners helping facilitate evidence-based policymaking. studies have found that public health practitioners self-assess skills in the areas of communication and impacting policy. these are critical skills gaps among public health practitioners that must be closed to facilitate evidence-based policymaking. the more top-down, centralized approach to policymaking in China, for example, will likely require different tactical approaches to implementing the storytelling-data hybrid strategy. in-person interviews allow for enhanced rapport building, probing and collection of and response to nonverbal data. telephone conversations may allow participants to feel more comfortable disclosing sensitive information. more systematic interviews or surveys are necessary to more comprehensively assess universal and country-specific barriers and facilitators.

insufficient reason. in other ways, these criticisms may be valid. the shortcoming black identified among researchers may also apply to practitioners. studies will be needed to examine the nuances of advocating for evidence-based policymaking in the unique political structures, climates and cultures present in each country studied. the more top-down, centralized approach to policymaking in China, for example, will likely require different tactical approaches to implementing the storytelling-data hybrid strategy than the de-centralized health system in Brazil. public health practitioners from Australia, Brazil, China and the united states were interviewed about perceived political factors that influence the implementation of EBNCDP. findings from this study can aid public health practitioners and policymakers in advocating for conditions and policies that encourage evidence-based practice and more proactively respond to barriers."}
