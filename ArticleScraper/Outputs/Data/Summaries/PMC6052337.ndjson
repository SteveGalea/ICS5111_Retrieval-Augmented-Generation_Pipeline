{"summary": "unlicensed replication in B-cells can manifest clinically as infectious mononucleosis. productive replication in epithelial cells can be associated with immune suppression in AIDS patients. latent infection is linked to all forms of EBV-associated cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) a robust in vitro method to mimic differentiation-induced lytic reactivation in polarized epithelia, in primary or immortalized airway epithelial cell lines, could significantly advance our interrogation of EBV pathogenesis in preneoplastic mechanisms. the conventional method to reactivate EBV is by chemical induction with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and protein kinase C inhibitors. the air-liquid interface (ALI) culture method establishes apical and basolateral surfaces by seeding cells on a collagen-coated transwell membrane. once an intact epithelium is established, the apical medium is removed and cells are fed through a porous membrane from the basolateral surface. the method can also be applied to immortalized cell lines (26, 27). epithelial cells are seeded on a collagen-coated transwell membrane. there are a limited number of authenticated NPC cell lines that continue to harbor latent EBV in culture. the HK1 cell line originated from a differentiated NPC tumor biopsy specimen and infected with a recombinant (Akata) EBV strain. the HK1-EBV cell line was established by in vitro infection of a recombinant EBV originating from the EBV Akata strain (38). in proliferating monolayer cultures, the HK1 cell line does not show induction of the lytic cascade and expresses a type II latency profile characterized by the expression of EBNA1, EBER1/2, LMP1, LMP2A, LMP2B, and BART transcripts (38). in this immunoblotting for expression of early protein zebra, early protein EaD, and the late viral capsid antigen (VCA) p18 protein. involucrin was not evident in monolayer culture but robustly induced in ALI culture. induction of involucrin was strongest in HK1 cells compared to uninfected cells. cells that stain positively for gp350 represent cells that have completed induction of the lytic cascade. only sporadic cells stained positively for gp350 in monolayer culture when reactivated with TPA and sodium butyrate. gp350-positive cells were much more frequently detected in ALI-cultured cells. HK1-EBV ALI cultures were treated with TPA (200 nM) and sodium butyrate (5 mM) for 3 days to induce reactivation. monolayer cultures were treated with DAPI (blue) for 3 days to induce reactivation. host genes that were differentially regulated by at least 2-fold did not show an overall increase but a decrease in transcript levels which likely represented host shutoff. FPKM values of differentially regulated EBV and host transcripts with 2-fold change in HK1-EBV cells between week 3 and week 0 of ALI culture. the majority of EBV transcripts are expressed at up to 104 fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mappable reads (FPKM), but the abundant expression of EBERs at 106 to 107 FPKM is intriguing. the abundant expression of EBERs is exploited for the diagnosis of EBV-associated cancers and diseases by EBER in situ hybridization (44). the majority of genomes were encapsidated with less than 1 log10 difference. the majority of genomes were encapsidated with less than 1 log10 difference. the averaged value was calculated from three biological triplicates. eled Xho1.9 fragment DNA probe located on the BamHI-digested fragment leftward of the EBV terminal repeats. data are displayed from the same blot and exposure time. intervening lanes were cropped for labeling purposes and are demarcated by a vertical dotted line. by week 3, there was a total value of 1,675,933 GRUs per ALI. this increase was 30-fold higher than the values measured at week 0, when production of progeny virus began. at week 2 to 3 of ALI culture there were 3.0 106 to 4.3 106 encapsidated EBV genomes per ALI culture (1.12 cm2) HK1-EBV ALI cultures harvested at week 2 were imaged for evidence of EBV virions by TEM and assessed by an independent microscopist. extracellular virions are mostly washed away during TEM processing, but intracellular virions can be captured. the TEM images show an encapsidated virion of 200 to 250 nm and two immature virions in the cytoplasm. infection as defined by presence of latent or lytic markers is not detected in nasal biopsy specimens of healthy tissue. the creation of an EBV infection model and analytical methods to study (widespread or focal) infection in ALI-cultured primary nasal epithelial cells would be the most relevant system to evaluate EBV de novo infection in mucociliated epithelia. organotypic rafts provide single-cell resolution by formalin-fixed paraffin-embedding (FFPE) sectioning and staining. but the keratinocyte-enriching media used to establish organotypic rafts may not culture all NPC cell types. the ALI culture method ultimately extends the application of polarization to other epithelial cell types. 1-EBV cell line was established by in vitro infection of a recombinant EBV originating from the EBV Akata strain (38) in proliferating monolayer cultures, the HK1 cell line does not show induction of the lytic cascade and expresses a type II latency profile characterized by the expression of EBNA1, EBER1/2, LMP1, LMP2A, LMP2B, and BART transcripts (38). in this cell line, expression early protein zebra, early protein EaD, and the late viral capsid antigen (VCA) p18 protein, as well as the cellular differentiation markers involucrin, keratin 10 and filaggrin. involucrin was not evident in monolayer culture but robustly induced in ALI culture. the induction of involucrin was strongest in HK1 cells compared to uninfected cells. cells that stain positively for gp350 represent cells that have completed induction of the lytic cascade. only sporadic cells stained positively for gp350 in monolayer culture when reactivated with TPA and sodium butyrate. but gp350-positive cells were much more frequently detected in ALI-cultured cells. monolayer cultures were treated with TPA (200 nM) and sodium butyrate (5 mM) for 3 days to induce reactivation. nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). images were acquired on an Olympus Provis epifluorescence microscope.
