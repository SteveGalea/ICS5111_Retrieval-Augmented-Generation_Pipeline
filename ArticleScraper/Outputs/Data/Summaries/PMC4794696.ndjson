{"summary": "TEXT type I interferons are crucial inducers of the antiviral response. they act by binding to their universally expressed receptor (IFNAR) and regulating the expression of a large set of genes known as interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (1). adenoviral vectors expressing type I IFN have been generated and shown to be efficient in the prevention of a number of viral diseases in vertebrate hosts. we first tested the ability of Ad5-IFN- to drive the expression and secretion of active IFN-. we assayed increasing amounts of medium from vero cells infected with Ad5-IFN- or the parental control Ad5-DsRed virus. control medium did not prevent VSV infection and showed no toxicity to the cell monolayer. conditioned media from Ad5-IFN--infected Vero cells induced a specific response. preincubation of supernatants inhibited ISRE-dependent luciferase expression 10-fold. one of the first events in the type I IFN-induced signaling is the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) the supernatants had been previously preincubated (+B18) or not (B18) for 45 min with 20 ng of purified B18 protein at 37\u00b0C. twenty-four hours later, the cells were washed, and 10-fold serial dilutions of VSV (starting with 103 PFU/cell) were added. using the Dual-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega) normalized mean luciferase stimulation values (n-fold) are shown for each condition. the assays were done in triplicate. at 24 h postinoculation, we challenged the mice with increasing doses of the highly virulent influenza variant hv-PR8 (26\u201329) infection of PBS-treated or Ad5-DsRed-treated mice resulted in mortality rates of 100% at 20 times the 50% lethal dose (LD50) no animals from the Ad5-IFN-treated group succumbed to infection, while control groups showed 50% mortality. ISG15 is one of the most abundantly induced transcripts upon IFN treatment (30) in case of influenza A virus infection, the IFN antagonist NS1 is a known target of ISGylation (31, 32), which inhibits viral replication. these results support the notion that an IFN-induced antiviral response mediates the protective effect of Ad5-IFN- treatment in vivo. x1 mice were inoculated with hv-PR8 after inoculation. each value is the average percentage change in weight and the standard error of the mean for all the mice per group. animals with a weight loss of a 25% relative to the initial weight were euthanized, following ethics protocols. viral RNA was readily detected by RT-PCR of the influenza NP gene in lung samples from 11 out of 16 of these animals by their time of death. surviving animals that had been exposed to Ad5-IFN- showed a marked reduction of histopathological effects in the lung. representative lung section from an Ad5-DsRed inoculated mouse was euthanized at 7 days after inoculation with 20 LD50 hv-PR8 virus. a single intranasal dose treatment with a nonreplicative human adenovirus expressing ovine IFN- can prevent the development of fatal influenza in a murine infection model. this might represent a safer option for first line antiviral treatments and a vector with broader host applicability and easy administration. this might be especially useful for the treatment of zoonotic diseases."}
