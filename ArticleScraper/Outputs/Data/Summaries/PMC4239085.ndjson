{"summary": "in children, 156 million episodes of pneumonia are recorded annually worldwide. in 2008, 1.6 million children younger than 5 years died from pneumonia. introduction of PCR-based diagnostic methods has increased the ability to detect respiratory viruses responsible for most ARIs in young children. nasopharyngeal samples from children with LRTI and URTI were found negative for a panel of 21 respiratory pathogens. this study contributes to the description of the viral and bacterial populations present in nasopharyngeal samples from children with lower and upper ARIs using a metagenomic approach. this study suggests that the current diagnostic methods likely miss known respiratory pathogens. all children were previously healthy, not diagnosed with tuberculosis or signs of malnutrition. administration of antibiotics before hospital admission was not registered. in outpatients no antibiotics were administered before sample collection. nucleic acids were eluted in nuclease-free water, aliquoted, quantified in nanoDrop ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies, Waltham, MA) and stored at 70\u00b0C until further use. reverse transcription was done using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and primer-A (5'-GTTTCCCAGTCTCN9-3') deep sequencing and sequence analysis were performed with the Illumina GAPipeline program (version 1.3.0) using standard parameters. for each read, the adapter and 5' and 3' bases with no-call sites (N residues) and low-quality (Phred-like scores 20) were trimmed. all unidentified sequences unaligned using SMALT nucleotide alignment were assembled de novo with Metavelvet modified by us to improve the assembly efficiency. each assembly contig was aligned against BLASTn database. ml of saline solution were collected from 250 children (male:female ratio, 1.27; age range, 0\u2013191 months) from September 2011 to April 2012. the second population was composed of patients with symptomatic URTI. all samples were placed in vials containing viral transport medium. samples from both groups of patients were screened by a multiplex PCR (Seeplex Pneumobacter ACE detection kit, Seegene, Seoul, Korea) for the presence of six bacteria commonly associated to respiratory infections: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae. DNA was digested with the GsuI restriction enzyme (Fermentas Waltham, MA) for 2 h at 30\u00b0C to remove sequences corresponding to PCR primers. samples were purified again and used as starting material to prepare 300 bp-sized libraries using Illumina's Genomic DNA sample Prep Kit with multiplex primers. valid reads were aligned to bacteria, fungi and viruses nt NCBI databases, using SMALT with 70% coverage and identity. reads that mapped were aligned with standalone BLASTn against the databases described above, using an E-value of 1e\u201303. metagenomics sequences are fragmentary and not completely overlapping. a database of complete genomes was first created using all sequences available in GenBank until January 2014. a reference alignment was done with sequences of this database by using the software MAFFT.
