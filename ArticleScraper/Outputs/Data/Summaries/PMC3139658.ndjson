{"summary": "bats are considered one of the more ancient mammals, but little is known about their immune system and how they manage infections. the ability of bats to harbour highly pathogenic viruses is driving research into further understanding bat biology, immunology and ecology. serological evidence for henipavirus infection in bats has been reported in the geographic range spanning Australia [29], Malaysia [30], Thailand [31], [32], Cambodia [33], Indonesia [34], Bangladesh [27], india [35], people's Republic of China [36], papua new Guinea [37], Madagascar [38] and Ghana [39]. henipaviruses have been isolated from flying foxes in Australia [40], Malaysia [30], [32], [32], the interferon alpha (IFN-) and beta (IFN-) genes have been identified in two species of fruit bat, the Egyptian Rousette, Rousettus aegyptiacus [49], [50] and the Malaysian flying fox, Pteropus vampyrus [51]. the IFN- gene has also been described in the greenish-backed fruit bat, Dobsonia viridis [52]. IFN-1, IFN-2 and IFN-3 are also known as IL-29, IL-28A and IL-28B respectively. henipavirus infection antagonises both interferon induction and signaling in bat cells. cell culture and viruses Bat cells used for this study were previously generated from P. alecto. all bat cells were maintained in modified Eagle's Medium Nutrient Mixture F-12 HAM (Sigma) all work with live Hendra and Nipah viruses was carried under BSL-4 conditions at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL), Geelong, Australia. primer design Oligonucleotide primers were designed from the sequence data of P. vampyrus (available in the Ensembl database and the GenBank trace file archive using BLAST on NCBI) the cells were treated with 1000 U of Universal Type I interferon (PBL) cDNA was reverse transcribed using superscript\u00ae III Reverse Transcriptase. quantitative real time PCR was performed using SYBR Green qPCR. paFe (primary P. alecto foetus cells), PaFeT (SV40 T immortalized P. alecto foetus cells) and PaKi (primary P. alecto kidney cells) all bat cells were maintained in modified Eagle's Medium Nutrient Mixture F-12 HAM (Sigma) all cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. BLAST searches and analysis tools were used to identify and analyse each gene. oligonucleotide primers were used to direct the cloning and sequencing of the P. alecto genes of interest. quantitative real time PCR was performed using superscript\u00ae III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) in an ABI 7900 or 7500. mRNA transcripts were assayed in duplicate, and CT values were used to calculate relative fold changes in each gene. bat lung cells (PaLuT02) were infected at an MOI of 10 with individual henipaviruses, HeV, NiV-M and NiV-B. total RNA was extracted from cells and used for real-time PCR assays to measure transcriptional regulation of interferon genes. IL28B and IL29 mRNA levels were detected and relative fold changes were calculated. transfection of 10 g poly IC was used as a positive control. IFN- genes (type III interferons), IL-29 and IL-28B were investigated following henipavirus infection. paLuT02 cells were infected with individual henipaviruses HeV, NiV-M and NiV-B at an MOI of 10. at 24 h pi the cells were treated with 1000 U of Universal Interferon. the cells were harvested for RNA extraction and levels of ISG54 and ISG56 mRNA transcripts were determined. real-time PCR was then performed for ISG54, ISG56. error bars indicate standard deviation of three independent experiments. cell type-independent antagonism of the interferon signaling pathway. henipavirus proteins are expressed in human cells compared with transfection with NiV P, V and W gene products. we hypothesize that the amount of viral protein expressed may dictate the level of antagonism observed on interferon production and signaling pathways. levels of protein were semi-quantified using ImageJ software [70] and relative protein levels normalized to N protein were calculated for each sample. henipavirus infection induces many responses in cells. the levels of both ISG54 and ISG56 mRNA transcripts were equivalent to mock-infected cells. the levels of both mRNA transcripts were also investigated to confirm that there is a block in interferon production. henipavirus infection on the interferon signaling pathway in paLuT02 cells was investigated by stimulation with exogenous interferon. cells from a variety of mammalian species have been demonstrated to respond to Universal Interferon, including human, monkey, mouse, bovine, rat, cat, pig, rabbit, guinea pig and hamster [59] there is no significant increase in ISG54 and ISG56 transcripts. the cells were at least 90% infected with HeV, NiV-M and NiV-B. henipavirus infection and antagonism of interferon signaling pathway. mock-infected cells were treated with universal interferon (1000 U) for 3 h. a percentage block in ISG54 and ISG56 induction was calculated. in all cell types there was at least a 75\u201380% reduction in ISG54/56 transcription compared to mock-infected cells. the lysates prepared from human (HEp-2) and P. alecto (PaLuT02) cells showed a decreased level of P, V and W expression in P. alecto cell lines compared with human cells. the results suggest that the block in interferon signaling in P-gene products is not a result of differential expression of P-gene products. in henipavirus infected bat cells, the interferon production pathway was antagonized. this contrasts with the up-regulation of type III interferons in bat cells. this result contrasts with the up-regulation of type III interferons in bat cells. exogenous interferon failed to induce an ISG response in henipavirus infected bat cells. this was consistent with a block in both interferon induction and signaling pathways in bat cells. this difference was not due to different ratios of henipavirus P-gene products expressed in bats cells compared to human cells. the ability of henipavirus to block interferon induction and signaling is surprising given the asymptomatic nature of henipavirus infection in bats compared with humans. this would suggest that bats control henipavirus infection by an as yet unidentified mechanism, not via the interferon response."}
