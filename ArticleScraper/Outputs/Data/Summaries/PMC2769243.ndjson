{"summary": "the drugs most often used fall into three categories. the interleukin-2 anti-CD25 selective blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAb) such as basiliximab and daclizumab. mAb alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) which targets T and B cells. T10B9.1A-31 (T10B9) is a nonmitogenic IgM isotype murine mAb. it was produced by fusing spleen cells from mice immunized with human peripheral blood T-lymphocytes with SP2-0/Ag-14 mutant myeloma cells. initial production, purification, and lyophilization of stable clinical material was achieved and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. the most successful are those specific for the CD3/TCR antigen recognition complex. the mechanism of OKT3 action (a murine IgG2a mAb) includes interaction of its Fc portion with the high affinity Fc gamma receptor I that is present on monocytes. this produces immune activation followed by immunosuppression. short-term lymphocyte depletion T10B9 administration results in rapid decline in lymphoid cell counts with respective epitope modulation and recovery by day 14. this is marked contrast to thymoglobulin and Campath-1H and may be one reason why infections may occur over many months when either of these agents are administered. the most successful are those specific for the CD3/TCR antigen recognition complex. the mechanism of OKT3 action (a murine IgG2a mAb) includes interaction of its Fc portion with the high affinity Fc gamma receptor I that is present on monocytes. this produces immune activation followed by immunosuppression. T10B9 does not induce proliferation OKT3 is an established potent T cell mitogen in vivo and in vitro. studies suggest that T10B9 reduces proliferation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. T10B9 at doses of 80, 800, and 8000 ng/mL failed to induce TNF release at 24 hours after exposure. only six of 30 patients treated with T10B9 exhibited a TNF response compared to 19 of 23 OKT3-treated patients (P = 0.001) in vivo plasma samples from kidney transplantation patients were tested for cytokine levels. only six of 30 patients treated with T10B9 exhibited a TNF response compared to 19 of 23 OKT3-treated patients (P = 0.001) both T10B9 and OKT3 induced the DNA fragmentation definitive for apoptosis. the media control exhibited 18% apoptotic MC540 positive cells. this was increased to 38% following T10B9 incubation and 43% with OKT3. T10B9 has been successfully used as an immunosuppression induction agent in heart transplantation19 and in simultaneous kidney\u2013pancreas transplantation. Unlike other monoclonal and polyclonal antibody preparations, there is no experience in treating acute leukemia or aplastic anemia. both T10B9 and OKT3 induced the DNA fragmentation definitive for apoptosis. the media control exhibited 18% apoptotic MC540 positive cells. T10B9 proved to be a weaker stimulus for IL-2 than did OKT3. T10B9 reverses rejection without the cytokine-induced rise in the serum creatinine seen with OKT3. it is also used for T-lymphocyte depletion in harvested bone marrow prior to haploidentical bone marrow transplantation to control graft versus host disease. T10B9 is a novel mAb with a short duration of activity allowing phenotypically altered T lymphocytes to repopulate after therapy. it has no effect on B lymphocytes, is not mitogenic and therefore produces less cytokine induced side effects. a population of T lymphocytes called dendritic epidermal T cells responds quickly to injury and attach to keratinocytes (the primary cells of the skin) this phenomenon has been demonstrated in murine lung and is presumed to occur when injury occurs to any epithelial tissue. exposure to mild immune response allows T lymphocytes to control a variety of infectious agents. studies have not been performed to demonstrate that sparing T lymphocytes makes a difference in solid organ transplantation outcome. increased T cells 100days post-bone marrow transplantation predict a long-term favorable outcome. however, the direct evidence that sparing T lymphocytes is beneficial to transplant outcome is mostly derived from the reported experience using T10B9. cell monoclonal antibody with reduced immune activation potential in vitro and in vivo. in vitro it does not induce DNA synthesis, the expression of activation antigens or cytokine release, which is in contrast to OKT3. it spares T lymphocytes which have a unique and important role in the immune response."}
