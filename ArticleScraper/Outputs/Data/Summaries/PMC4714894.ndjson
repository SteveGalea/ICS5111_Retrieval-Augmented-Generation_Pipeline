{"summary": "CCoV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. it belongs to the family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae, genus Alphacoronavirus, species Alphacoronavirus-1. CCoV-II viruses are divided into two subtypes CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb. 201 fecal samples were collected in the form of rectal swabs of dogs with diarrhea from animal hospitals in the Harbin, Daqing, and Mudanjiang districts of Heilongjiang province, northeast China. 141 samples were collected in Harbin, 20 were collected in Daqing, and 40 were collected in Mudanjiang. cDNA was synthesized using random primers (six nucleotides) according to manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using random primers (six nucleotides) all nucleotide sequences generated in our study were submitted to GenBank under accession numbers KT192642\u2013KT192698 for the M gene of the 57 CCoV strains, KT222969\u2013KT222994 for the S gene of the 26 CCoV-IIa strains, and KT222996 for the S gene of the CCoV-IIb strains. 201 fecal samples were collected in the form of rectal swabs of dogs with diarrhea from animal hospitals in the Harbin, Daqing, and Mudanjiang districts. 141 samples were collected in Harbin, 20 were collected in Daqing, and 40 were collected in Mudanjiang. the S gene fragments used for CCoV genotyping/subtyping were amplified using the primers EL1F/EL1R, S5F/S6R, and CEPol-1/TGSP-2. cDNA was synthesized using random primers (six nucleotides) using Moloney murine leukemia virus (RNase H-) reverse transcriptase. partial sequences of the M and S genes of CCoV strains, including CCoV-I, CCoV-IIa, and CCoV-IIb strains, were retrieved from GenBank. phylogenetic analysis For the phylogenetic analysis, partial sequences of the M and S genes of CCoV strains were retrieved from GenBank. protein of 57 CCoV strains shown in S1 Table. of the 201 samples, 57 samples (28.36%) were positive for CCoV following RT-PCR amplification of the partial M gene.

CCoV-positive rate was found between October and December, which may be associated with seasonal variations in northeast China. the 48 CCoV-II strains identified in our study formed six clusters (C1\u2013C6). the nine CCoV-I strains identified in our study formed two clusters (C1 and C2) these data demonstrated that the CCoV-I and CCoV-II strains identified in our study exhibited genetic diversity. the CCoV-IIb strain HRB-BB9 was closely related to CCoV-IIb reference strains from Europe, North America and South America. it was rarely reported that one co-infection between CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb was found in the 28 CCoV-positive samples. characteristics of the CCoV positive dogs, genotyping of CCoV strains, and amino acid substitution of the partial M protein in northeast china."}
