{"summary": "the national health insurance system covers more than 99% of Taiwan's inhabitants for most medical expenses related to inpatient, outpatient, and emergency care, Chinese medicine, and dental services. the Bureau of the NHI audited patients\u2019 diagnosis, procedure, and medication data to ensure correct coding and appropriateness. this dataset includes all available medical registry data for 120,000 patients with incident T2D per year during the period 1999\u20132012. each subject was followed until the outcome of hospitalization for sepsis, death, loss to follow up, or the end of the study period (31 December 2012). case definition and control selection Because OAD exposure may be a time-dependent property associated with sepsis occurrence, we conducted a nested case-control analysis to estimate the odds ratios for sepsis. the baseline demographic characteristics of the cohort were analyzed using descriptive statistics. we conducted conditional logistic regression with adjustment for potential confounding factors, including OAD use, insulin use, and all other predefined comorbidities associated with the risk of sepsis. 0.769 Adapted Diabetes

cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, peripheral vascular disease. each complication produced a numeric score ranging from 0 to 2 (0 = no abnormality, 1 = some abnormality, 2 = severe abnormality) the date of cohort entry was the first day on which a patient fulfilled the diabetes diagnostic criteria. all individuals were required to be at least 20 years old and have baseline medical history for at least 5 years. each subject was followed until the outcome of hospitalization for sepsis, death, loss to follow up, or the end of the study period (31 December 2012). sulfonylureas were stratified into glibenclamide and non-glibenclamide sulfonylureas. the pattern of OAD use was categorized as current (on index date), recent (30 days before index date), or past (31\u2013365 days before index date). the baseline demographic characteristics of the cohort were analyzed using descriptive statistics. 862 (64.8) Level 3 1,557 (3.6) 1,557 (3.6) Level 4 157 (0.4) 157 (0.4) Charlson comorbidity

20% reduced risk of sepsis compared with nonuse. lycemic control compared with those receiving other OADs. no proven evidence supports increased risk of sepsis among metformin users. a meta-analysis of 13 trials showed that TZD use was associated with greater risks of upper and lower respiratory-tract infections. but low event rates of sepsis and differences in follow-up periods (1\u20135 years) among trials may have affected the accuracy of estimates of incident sepsis events. sis based on ICD-9 CM codes may have introduced misclassification bias. however, this bias could be non-differential and robust agreement has been demonstrated elsewhere11,13. if the impact of OADs on sepsis outcome were the result of the glucose-lowering effect, the tendency of ORs for different OADs should tend toward coherence."}
