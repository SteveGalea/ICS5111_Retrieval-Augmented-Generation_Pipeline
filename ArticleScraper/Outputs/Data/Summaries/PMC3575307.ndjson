{"summary": "iota-carrageenan, a polymer derived from red seaweed, has reduced viral load in nasal secretions and alleviated symptoms in adults with common cold. the treatment was safe and well tolerated, with less side effects observed in the verum group compared to placebo. viral infections lead to more than 400.000 hospitalizations per year in children under 18 years of age in the united states. the morbidity caused by viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) and the ensuing complications are more pronounced in individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions such as asthma. no interventions were conclusively demonstrated to display antiviral activity, and effectively decrease the duration or severity of manifestations. nasal spray containing iota-carrageenan three times per day alleviated symptoms of common cold and reduced the viral load in the nasal mucosa. results of a recent pilot study in 35 adult patients showed that application of a nasal spray containing iota-carrageenan reduced the viral load in the nasal mucosa. URTI was defined by the presence of appropriate symptoms according to a scale described above. bacterial infections, recent use of antimicrobial drugs, and intranasal treatment at first presentation were exclusion criteria. additional medication could be prescribed in case of fever, bacterial otitis, wheezing, persistent coughing or pneumonia upon decision of the physician. the patients and parents were requested to record symptoms permitting assessment of the TSS during the first week of treatment. follow-up examination of the patients and collection of nasal secretion samples for molecular virus testing were performed three to five days into treatment. final examination and collection of symptom diaries for the evaluation were carried out on the third visit after day 21. data from 70 individuals would be sufficient to obtain significant results on the primary endpoint, the mean of TSS on days 2 to 7 at the 5% significance level and 80 percent power. it was decided to recruit at least 200 patients in order to be able to analyze an ITT (intention to treat) population of at least 150 patients. written informed consent was obtained from children above 14 years of age and their legal guardians in all instances. patients were assigned to receive a nasal spray containing either iota-carrageenan or placebo. a single puff (0.14 ml) of the spray per nostril was to be administered three times per day for a total of seven days. respiratory viruses including rhinovirus (RV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (MPV), influenza A (InfA) virus, influenza B (InfB) virus, parainfluenzavirus (PIV1, PIV2, PIV3) and coronaviruses (CoV) by methods described previously [17,18]. 153 children (88.8%) tested positive for at least one virus (mean 1.5; range 1\u20135) at visits 1 or 2. the most frequently detected viral pathogen was human rhinovirus (46%) followed by coronavirus (46%) followed by coronavirus (46%), influenza A virus (19%), influenza B virus (11%), human metapneumavirus (5%), parainfluenzavirus (5%) and respiratory syncytial virus (1%). the mean of total symptom scores (TSS) between days 2\u20137 was 3.8 (SD 2.8) in the iota-carrageenan group and 4.0 (SD 2.6) in the placebo group. pre-defined secondary endpoints including TSS on different study days also showed no significant differences between the iota-carrageenan and the placebo group. ITT population with complete persistent alleviation of symptoms (p 0.038) p-values were determined by the Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. the overall frequency of drug-related adverse events tended to be lower in the iota-carrageenan group compared to placebo. 52.2% of verum patients and 32.4% placebo patients cleared their viruses by the second visit (p = 0.030) the incidence of newly acquired infections with viruses that had not been detected at visit 1 was significantly lower in the verum group (13% versus 27%; p = 0.046). the most frequently detected viral pathogen was human rhinovirus (46%) followed by coronavirus (46%) followed by coronavirus (13%), influenza A virus (19%), influenza B virus (11%), human metapneumavirus (5%), parainfluenzavirus (5%) and respiratory syncytial virus (1%). pre-defined secondary endpoints including TSS on different study days, total systemic and total local symptom scores also showed no significant differences between the iota-carrageenan and the placebo group. between days 8\u201321, only the presence or absence of common cold symptoms had to be recorded. adverse events related to the upper respiratory tract were most common. treatment-unrelated severe adverse events were observed in four patients. incidence of viruses observed was typical for common cold (Figure 2). the log10 difference in viral load between visits 1 and 2 is shown (p 0.026) use of co-medication Most patients received at least one additional drug compatible with the study protocol as concomitant medication. patients receiving verum showed a trend towards lower TSS compared to placebo-treated patients. 90% of children in both study groups received one or more co-medications. in the verum group, predominantly antiinflammatory agents (58%) or antitussives (62%), and less frequently antibiotics (27%) or \u00df2-sympathomimetics (26%) were prescribed. significantly more children in the verum group tested virus-negative at visit 2. fewer children showed multiple viruses or revealed a new viral infection at this time. major limitations of this study include restricted performance of no more than two nasal aspirations. the funder has supported a part of the logistics. the sponsors had no influence on study design, collection, analysis, and interpretation of data."}
