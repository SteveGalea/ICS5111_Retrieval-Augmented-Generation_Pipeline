{"summary": "Cryptosporidium parvum has been identified as the most common zoonotic species infecting humans and most animals. sporozoites within Cryptosporidium oocysts were released and colonized into epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract. sporozoites damaged intestinal barriers to affect host nutrition absorption, impaired immune response, and persistently retarded growth. at least 15 subtypes (IIa\u2013IIi, IIk\u2013IIp) were identified. the subtype IId was widely detected in sheep, goats, and calves. the whole genome of two subtypes was different in sizes and contents. ncRNAs may modulate epithelial immune responses and anti-microbial defense against Cryptosporidium infection. a new RNA molecule, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), was discovered and studied recently. a new RNA molecule, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), was discovered and studied recently. C. parvum oocysts were purified by using the sheather\u2019s sugar flotation technique and cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. stored in PBS with penicillin-streptomycin (100 U/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin) the concentration and purity of total RNA samples were measured by the smart Spec Plus spectrophotometer. the complementary DNA (cDNA) was generated using the PrimeScript TM RT reagent Kit with the gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa Shuzo Co., Ltd., Liaoning, China) the samples were taken and sent to the company (CapitalBio Technology Corporation, Beijing, China) for microarray analysis. qRT-PCR was carried out using the SYBR assay in a 10 l reaction volume, containing 0.2 l Forward Primer, 0.2 l Reverse Primer, 1 l cDNA, 3.6 l nuclease-free H2O, and 5 l Master Mix. the reaction program was initiated at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, then at 95\u00b0C for 10 s, 60\u00b0C for a total 40 cycles. 2 105 HCT-8 cells were seeded in each well of a fresh 24-well plate and cultured for 24 h (or with 80% confluence) at RMPI 1640 medium and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) under 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. the infection burden was measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) targeting the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) previously described the Agilent Feature Extraction v10.7 was used to analyze and extract data. these data were then normalized and analysed by using Agilent GeneSpring GX software (13.1 revisions, 20151) GO and KEGG Enrichment Analysis. mRNA and lncRNA differentially expressed in human cells after C. parvum infection. expression patterns of mRNA and lncRNA between experimental and control groups were significantly different by hierarchical clustering plot. bioinformatics analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs in HCT-8 cells infected with Cryptosporidium parvum IId subtype. the significantly up- and down-regulated RNAs are presented as red or green dots, respectively, and the expression of RNAs not significantly differentially expressed is presented as black dots. GO and KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs. mRNAs were significantly enriched in chromosome organization, chromatin organization, organelle organization, and chromatin modification in BP. mRNAs were significantly enriched in chromosome organization, chromatin organization, organelle organization, and chromatin modification in BP. co-expression network was constructed by using Cytoscape v3.6.0 (20154). one mRNA could be correlated with one or more lncRNAs. one lncRNA could also be associated with one or more mRNAs. lncRNAs were also identified to indirectly regulate the expression of 109 distant genes through binding miRNAs (trans-regulation) these target genes were significantly associated with BP in membrane raft organization, membrane organization, membrane assembly and regulation of signal transduction, CC in intracellular organelle, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase complex, MF in binding, cytoskeletal protein binding, and histone threonine kinase activity. the fold change 1.2 and P 0.05 were used as the standard to map differentially expressed genes. the expression patterns of mRNA (Supplementary Figure S1A) and lncRNA (Supplementary Figure S1B) between experimental and control groups were found to be significantly different by hierarchical clustering plot. 10 differentially expressed mRNAs and 10 lncRNAs were randomly selected for qRT-PCR. the consistent results were found between qRT-PCR and microarray data for 10 mRNAs and 9 lncRNAs. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs. top 20 pathways were depicted in Figure 4. mRNAs enriched into hedgehog signaling pathway, tight junction, and Wnt signaling pathway. the network was based on the mathematical relevance (Correlation > 0.99, Correlation \u20130.99, and P-value 0.05) to search similar expression profiles of lncRNAs and mRNAs using cytoscape software. the yellow triangle represents lncRNAs while the gradual color of red to green circular represents mRNAs. gene ontology (GO) analysis of differentially expressed lncRNAs. GO terms with corrected P-value less than 0.05 were considered significantly enriched by differentially expressed genes. KEGG pathway analysis of the differentially expressed lncRNAs with top 20 enrichment scores. significantly differentially expressed, e.g., up-regulated genes of thymidylate kinase, Cyclin A2, TM4SF1, IL1RN, Bcl2, and DUSP4 and down-regulated genes of Cyclin D1, Cyclin G2, BTG1, LAMB1, and LGALS1. previous studies indicated that these genes would be involved in processes of inflammation, anti-apoptosis effect, and initiation and regulation of mucosal response during C the integrity of tight junction Zonula-Occludens-1 (ZO-1) was disrupted by Cryptosporidium infection. a particular hypothesis was undergoing investigated that Wnt signaling pathway was attenuated in intestinal epithelium infected with C. parvum. 1,349 mRNAs and 821 lncRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in the HCT-8 cells infected with C. parvum IId subtype. co-expression analysis revealed that these differentially expressed lncRNAs would potentially cis- and trans-regulate the expression of mRNAs during C. parvum infection. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential dA19G1 (O1\u20133) or without parasites (C1\u20133) were cultured for 24 h at RMPI 1640 medium and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) under 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. the scatter plot showed the distributions of mRNAs. the values of x and y axes in the scatter plot were the normalized signal values of the samples (log2 scaled), and the R represents the correlation coefficient TABLE S6 Go enrichment analysis of mRNAs and lncRNAs. click here for additional data file."}
