{"summary": "MRVs are ubiquitous mammalian pathogens, infecting nearly all species (1). MRVs possess a 10-segment double-stranded RNA genome that enables reassortment and viral evolution. clinically, MRV infection ranges from asymptomatic to upper respiratory tract illness. the M1 segment contained a 2,211-nt open reading frame with only 74% identity to MRV. the remaining four segments encoded 1,416-, 1,257-, 1,101-, and 1,098-nt open reading frames (ORFs) with 95, 99, 99, and 96% identities to MRV."}
