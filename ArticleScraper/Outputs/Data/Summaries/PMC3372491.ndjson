{"summary": "113,228 chemical compounds (Sigma-Aldrich\u00ae corporate chemical directory) were docked by Surflex, then ranked by the same three ranking methods motioned above to select the potential active compounds for experimental test. the top 20 compounds according to conventional consensus scoring were experimentally tested, no inhibitor was found. the scoring function is able to evaluate the fitness between the ligand and receptor guiding the conformational and orientational search of ligand-binding poses. current docking and scoring functions can be roughly classified as force-field-based methods [5], [14], [15], empirical scoring functions [16], [17], and knowledge-based statistical potentials [18]. in 1999, Charifson et al. introduced a consensus scoring method [20]. many studies have suggested that employing consensus-scoring approaches can improve the performance by compensating for the deficiencies of the scoring functions with each other [19], [20], [21], [22]. principal component analysis (PCA) is a powerful tool for pattern recognition, classification, modeling, and other aspects of data evaluation. the principal component (PCs) are linear combinations of the original variables. in the present study, the first principal component (PC1) accounts for the maximum variance (eigenvalue) in the original dataset. in the present study, the training set is composed of 50 confirmed BACE-1 inhibitors and 9950 inactive compounds [46], [47], [48] three rank-based virtual screening methods, individual scoring, conventional consensus scoring and PCA scoring were examined to identify BACE-1 inhibitors. a total of 113,228 compounds were used as the test set. the training set and test set compounds were stored as a SYBYL SLN list and converted to SYBYL mol2 format. we used the \u201crank-by-number\u201d strategy in the consensus scoring. the \u201crank-by-number\u201d strategy was previously found to outperform the \u201crank-by-rank\u201d and \u201crank-by-vote\u201d strategy because it can summarize most of the information [32]. consensus score in a certain pose group is the average of ZScore by 4 individual scoring functions mentioned above. the consensus score in a certain pose group is the average of ZScore by 4 individual scoring functions mentioned above in the given consensus-scoring scheme. in the present study, there were five extracted pose groups. we used only eight scoring functions, which included LigScore1, PLP1, jain, Ludi_1, D_Score, G_Score, and Surflex_Score, to perform the PCA for each group. SPSS version 16.0 statistical analysis package (SPSS Inc.) was used to normalize and calculate the principal components for all of the scoring data. 40 chemical compounds (Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC) were purchased for experimental test through fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. 113,228 compounds (Sigma-Aldrich\u00ae corporate chemical directory, Z272000, 1997) were used as the test set. both the training set and test set compounds were stored as a SYBYL SLN list and converted to SYBYL mol2 format using Concord [51] a post-dock minimization procedure was applied using the BFGS quasi-Newton method. five scoring functions in SYBYL, including D_Score, G_Score, ChemScore, Surflex_Score, and PMF_Score, were applied to extract the stored poses. five pose groups were produced, with each pose group containing 10,000 compounds. consensus score in a certain pose group is the average of ZScore by 4 individual scoring functions mentioned above. the consensus score in a certain pose group is the average of ZScore by 4 individual scoring functions mentioned above in the given consensus-scoring scheme. if the weight of the last PCs occupied a highly trivial part of the population variance, then the last PCs can be neglected. we used only eight scoring functions, which included LigScore1, PLP1, jain, Ludi_1, D_Score, and ChemScore, to perform the PCA for each group. SPSS version 16.0 statistical analysis package (SPSS Inc.) was used to normalize and calculate the principal components for all of the scoring data. 40 chemical compounds were purchased for experimental test through fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. Pose extracted Pose ranked Surflex_Score G_Score G_Score G_Score G_Score D_Score ChemScore G_Score G_Score D_Score ChemScore G_Score G_Score G_Score G_Score G_Score G_Score G_Score G_Score G_Score G_Score G_Score G_Score G_Score G_Score G_Score G D_Score retrieved 20 inhibitors with Surflex_Score and 19 inhibitors with PMF_Score pose extraction. a distance-dependent dielectric attenuates the charge-charge, and other polar interactions were considered. it failed to rank any sensible docking poses regardless of what poses were extracted by itself or by the other scoring functions. the original data of each scoring function were scaled to unit variance and centered. the correlations between the binding scores computed by the 12 scoring functions are summarized in Table 2. The correlation Matrix of each scoring function is summarized in Table 2. correlation coefficients >0.6 are marked in boldface type. for the four scoring functions, Table 2 exhibited a high correlation. the correlation was higher for LigScore and PLP (R = 0.970.98) the best individual scoring function produces only 20 hits in the top 1% of the screening set. the best individual scoring function, jainScore, produces only 20 hits in the top 1% of the screening set. double-scoring schemes (e.g., Surflex_Score&D_Score) could also obtain 24 hits in the top 1% of the screening set. however, double-scoring schemes do not outperform the best individual scoring function in all cases. largely unpredictable which combinations of scoring functions would produce the optimal results. verdonk et al. performed a computational experiment on the simulated effect of consensus ranking with an increasing number of scoring functions. they noted that adding additional scoring functions to consensus ranking can reduce the enrichment rates compared to the most accurate single scoring function. if all of the scoring functions have a standard deviation of 2.0, then adding extra scoring functions to consensus ranking can reduce the enrichment rates. the first three principal components (PC1, PC2, PC3) account for >80% of the total variance for each pose group. the PC4, PC5, PC6, PC7, and PC8 could be omitted in further studies due to their trivial contribution to the total variance. the physical meaning of each PC could be attributed to van der Waals interactions. the physical meaning of PC2 could be attributed to electrostatic interactions. the physical meaning of PC3 could be attributed to the hydrophobic interactions between the protein and ligands. PC2 accounts for approximately 15% of the total variance. Ludi_1 exhibits the maximum value (0.64, 0.74, 0.72, 0.73, 0.78) for each of the five pose groups. PC3 negatively correlates with Surflex_Score, D_Score, G_Score, and ChemScore (SYBYL software) but positively correlates with PLP1, LigScore1, jain, and Ludi_1 (Discovery Studio software) PC1score yields 26 active compounds in the Surflex_Score and PMF_Score pose group. application of PC1score results in more active compounds than the application of PC2score and PC3score for each of the five pose groups. the results showed that most of the data were scattered along the PC1 axis. Known inhibitors are depicted as red circles, non-inhibitors as black squares. most active compounds, which are farther from the origin, have values significantly different from the mean and can be considered outliers. ligand for each docking experiment, only those compounds with interactions to the catalytic residues (Asp32 and Asp228) are extracted. the so-called Lipinski \u201cRule-of-five\u201d [72] was used to evaluate the drug likeness of a candidate structure. 20 drug-like compounds were selected to purchase from Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC. compound 1 docks into 1W51 structure. benzyl ring (P1) fills the S1 pocket shaped by the Tyr71, Phe108, and Trp115 residues. carbobenzyloxy moiety (P2\u2032) fills the S2\u2032 pocket shaped by the Tyr71, R128, and Y198 residues. each compound yields 30 poses in the active pocket of the target (1W51) no solution was found on the outside of the active pocket. the top 1% of the ranked database was set as the threshold value. Ludi_1 retrieved 20 inhibitors with D_Score and ChemScore pose extraction. 18 inhibitors with Surflex_Score and G_Score pose extraction. D_Score also performed well for ranking the docking poses. score1 & Ligscore and PLP1 & PLP2 use the same scoring functions. only the weight factors employed by Ludi_2 are derived by fitting to experimentally determined binding affinities. all three versions were tested for enrichment rates of virtual screening against BACE-1. correlation coefficients >0.6 are marked in boldface type for the four scoring functions (i.e., Ligscore1, Ligscore2, PLP1 and PLP2). the correlation was higher for LigScore and PLP (R = 0.970.98) there was a higher correlation between G_Score and D_Score (R = 0.771) both of their algorithms adopted force-field-based methods that estimate the enthalpic contribution upon binding. both of their algorithms adopted force-field-based methods that estimate the enthalpic contribution upon binding, and both use very similar treatment of the energy terms. the top 1% of the Ranked list, Surflex_Score pose extracted group) the results are in agreement with the previous study. combining multiple scoring functions should always provide improved performance over individual scoring functions in simulated virtual screening experiments. the three scoring functions that we chose performed the best in single scoring. the performance was not as good as the four functions that we chose. blindly choosing scoring functions to perform consensus scoring will decrease the enrichment rates. ligscore1&ligscore2 and Ludi_1&Ludi_2 failed to rank any sensible docking poses. we constructed five 100008 matrices using the remaining eight scoring functions as the matrix column and the 10000 compounds as the raws. the physical meaning of each PC could be attributed to van der Waals interactions. the physical meaning of PC2 could be attributed to electrostatic interactions, and the physical meaning of PC3 could be attributed to the hydrophobic interactions between the protein and ligands. value PC1 PC2 PC3 PC1 PC2 PC3 PC1 PC2 PC3 PC1 PC2 PC3 PC1 PC2 PC3 PC1 PC2 PC3 Surflex_Score 0.356 0.322 0.182 0.276 0.484 0.224 0.278 0.457 0.239 0.272 0.46 0.197 0.311 0.379 0.233 G_Score 0.38 0.14 0.314 0.42 0.001 0.17 0.413 0.01 0.197 0.418 0.0 PC2 accounts for approximately 15% of the total variance. it negatively correlates with Ludi_1, ChemScore, LigScore, and PLP1. ludi_1 plays a dominant role in the explanation of PC2. the PC is a linear combination of multiple original variables. we can formulate the first three PCscore scoring functions for each pose group from the data in Table 5. we did not obtain any active compounds in the top 1% of the ranked database using PC3score because the values of the eigenvalue of PC3 were 1. the results showed that most of the data were scattered along the PC1 axis. the scattering variation along the PC1 axis is larger than that along the PC2 axis, which corresponds to the values of eigenvalue. we used conventional consensus scoring protocol to select the potential inhibitors. we selected the top 300 compounds according to the ranking results of the conventional consensus scoring protocol. a further 20 drug-like compounds were selected to purchase from Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC. two compounds (S450588 and 276065) showed IC50 values of 51.6 and 85.3 M. the compounds are rendered in green stick models and the residues are rendered in orange sticks. two sides of compound 2 are benzyl groups, one of the benzyl group occupy the S2\u2032 pocket shaped by the Asn233, Arg235 and Ser325 residues. the other benzyl group establish a cation- interaction with the guanidine group of Arg128. matic assay and four of them were cell penetrant (EC5020 M) [75] based on the virtual screening of 10,000 compounds of training set, the PCA approach yielded consistently superior rankings compared to conventional consensus scoring and single scoring. the application of PCA approach provides a more robust strategy for ranking compounds. the difference between our work and their\u2019s is that we do not need a training set because PCA is a form of unsupervised learning. the difference between our work and their\u2019s is that we do not need a training set because we do not need a training set because we do not need a training set. re-rank the score list and experimental test through BACE-1 FRET assay. a remarkable 10% hit rate was achieved when we applied the PCA scoring method and experimental test through BACE-1 FRET assay. the researchers could use PCA scoring protocol to re-rank the results from the virtual screening. 5.5KB, doc)."}
