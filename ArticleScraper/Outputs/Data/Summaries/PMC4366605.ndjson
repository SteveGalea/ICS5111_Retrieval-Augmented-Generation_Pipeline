{"summary": "nasopharyngeal swab was tested by the eSensor Respiratory Viral Panel. a blood sample was collected at the time of enrollment. healthy volunteers aged 18\u201330 years participated in 2 influenza vaccine studies at Stanford University during the 2010\u20132011 (n = 14) or 2011\u20132012 (n = 39) influenza seasons were included in this study. a blood sample was collected at day 6\u20138 after each vaccination. all studies were approved by the Stanford Institutional Review Board. written informed consent was obtained from all participants. hypothesis tests were declared statistically significant for P.05. Participants, Vaccines, and Blood Sample Collection Patients with acute influenza-like illness (ILI) were enrolled at Stanford Hospital and Clinics during the 2013\u20132014 influenza season. the 2012 IIV contained A/California/7/2009(H1N1)-like virus (A[H1N1]pdm09), A/Perth/16/2009(H3N2)-like virus, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus. a blood sample was collected at day 6\u20138 after each vaccination. wells incubated with complete medium without human immunoglobulin were used to determine background. wells were washed and incubated with goat anti\u2013immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody or goat anti\u2013immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody (KPL) the binding activity of IgG was significantly higher than that of IgA (P =.01, by the paired t test) in patients infected with A(H1N1)pdm09, virus-specific plasmablast responses are detectable in the blood 4 days after symptom onset and that the IgG response is dominant. 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus (A[H1N1]pdm09) binding activity of plasmablast-derived polyclonal antibodies (PPAbs) was prepared from blood samples collected 2\u20138 days after disease onset. PPAbs from patients with acute influenza-like illness (ILI) were prepared from blood samples collected 2\u20138 days after disease onset. PPAb from the influenza B virus\u2013infected patient did not bind any of the influenza A virus proteins. PPAb from the influenza B virus\u2013infected patient did not bind any of the influenza virus proteins. PPAbs with detectable binding to HA (n = 5) and PPAbs from a group of 15 randomly selected 2010/2011 IIV recipients were used for this analysis. the selection of this group was not based on any biological parameters. fected with A(H1N1)pdm09 developed B-cell responses to conserved NP that were significantly higher than those mounted by IIV recipients. cross-reactive PPAb response to heterovariant and heterosubtypic HAs was induced in patients with acute A(H1N1)pdm09 infection. infected patient PPAb samples with detectable binding to the homologous HA of A(H1N1)pdm09 (pH1; n = 5) were tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding to the HA of the heterovariant H1N1 strain A/Brisbane/59/2007 (sH1), the heterosubtypic avian H5N1 strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5) and the 43 individuals aged 18\u201330 years did not receive a monovalent A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine in 2009. at the time of enrollment, 26 of 43 individuals had detectable serum neutralizing antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09 with a geometric mean titer of 84 (range 16\u20131995) at the time of enrollment, 26 of 43 individuals had detectable serum neutralizing antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09 with a geometric mean titer of the mean PPAb binding to the homotypic pH1 was higher in the seropositive individuals than the seronegative individuals. the difference was no longer significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons. PPAbs collected after each immunization were analyzed by ELISA. PPAb reactivities to pH1, sH1 and H5 were significantly lower after the second IIV immunization than after the first immunization. the levels of A(H1N1)pdm09-specific serum neutralizing antibodies increased significantly after the first and second IIV immunization. however, the fold-increase of titers after the second immunization was significantly lower than that after the first (Supplementary 1). PPAb reactivity between the seronegative and seropositive subjects was significantly different for PPAb reactivity to pH1 and sH1 but not to H5. the binding activity of IgG was significantly higher than that of IgA (P =.01, by the paired t test) in patients infected with A(H1N1)pdm09, virus-specific plasmablast responses are detectable in the blood 4 days after symptom onset and that the IgG response is dominant. PPAbs from patients with acute influenza-like illness (ILI) were prepared from blood samples collected 2\u20138 days after disease onset. a pool of PPAbs from a subset of 2010/2011 inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) recipients (IIV pool) was also tested. PPAb from the influenza B virus\u2013infected patient did not bind any of the influenza A virus proteins. PPAb from the influenza B virus\u2013infected patient did not bind any of the influenza A virus proteins. PPAbs with detectable binding to HA (n = 5) and PPAbs from a group of 15 randomly selected 2010/2011 IIV recipients were used for this analysis. the asterisk indicates a statistically significant difference after the adjustment. patients infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 developed B-cell responses to the conserved NP that were significantly higher than those mounted by IIV recipients. PPAb samples from patients with acute A(H1N1)pdm09 infection were tested for their ability to bind full-length HA proteins of 3 influenza A virus strains. the 2009 pandemic influenza virus (A[H1N1]pdm09)\u2013infected patient PPAb samples with detectable binding to the homologous HA of A(H1N1)pdm09 (pH1; n = 5) were tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding to the HA of the heterovariant H1N1 strain A/Brisbane/59/2007 (sH1), the heterosubtypic avian a subset of 43 individuals aged 18\u201330 years did not receive a monovalent A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine in 2009. at the time of enrollment, 26 of 43 individuals had detectable serum neutralizing antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09 with a geometric mean titer of 84. at the time of enrollment, 26 of 43 individuals had detectable serum neutralizing antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09 with a geometric mean titer the mean PPAb binding to the homotypic pH1 was higher in the seropositive individuals than the seronegative individuals. the difference was no longer significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons. forty-three healthy individuals who did not receive a monovalent A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine were included for this analysis. the priming effect of natural A[H1N1]pdm09 infection was defined as the ratio of the mean area under the curve (AUC) for baseline seropositive individuals to the mean AUC for baseline seronegative individuals. hypotheses were tested with unpaired (A) or paired (B) t tests. the levels of A(H1N1)pdm09-specific serum neutralizing antibodies increased significantly after the first and second IIV immunization. however, the fold-increase of titers after the second immunization was significantly lower than that after the first (Supplementary 1). priming with inactivated A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine reduced the plasmablast response to a subsequent immunization with the same vaccine. wild-type A(H1N1)pdm09 infection did not affect the antigen recall response to a subsequent immunization with an IIV containing the same strain-specific HA. IIV immunization resulted in significantly reduced homotypic and cross-reactive PPAb responses after a subsequent vaccination with the same strain-specific HA. we previously reported a weaker plasmablast response in elderly subjects than in younger individuals after immunization with IIV. it is not clear whether the lack of a detectable HA-specific PPAb reactivity in this elderly patient was due to off-peak sample collection. we suggest that the kinetics of the plasmablast response should be addressed in future studies of defined subjects experimentally challenged with wild-type virus. studies include analyses of immunoglobulin gene sequences and antibody functions of the activated B-cell repertoire at the clonal level. a recent influenza cohort study revealed high rates of asymptomatic natural influenza virus infection in the community. infection was only detected by strain-specific seroconversion [35] a recent study found that immunization with a live, attenuated avian H5N1 influenza vaccine effectively primed the immune system. a second immunization with an epitope-matched T-cell independent antigen results in induction of tolerant memory B cells. deficiencies in the magnitude or functional properties of the CD4+ T-cell repertoire specific for IIV are likely a contributing factor to the reduced B-cell response in repeated IIV immunization. supplementary materials consist of data provided by the author. the posted materials are not copyedited."}
