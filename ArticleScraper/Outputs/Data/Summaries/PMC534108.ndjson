{"summary": "a systematic review was conducted to examine the effectiveness of antimicrobial rinse-free hand sanitizer interventions in the elementary school setting. Absenteeism due to communicable illness was the primary outcome variable. the quality of reporting was low. obstetrician Ignaz Semmelweis implemented routine handwashing with chlorinated lime as a mechanism to reduce the incidence of puerperal fever. this simple routine elicited dramatic results, reducing the mortality rate from 13\u201318 percent to 2 percent. this simple routine elicited dramatic results, reducing the mortality rate from 13\u201318 percent to 2 percent. the aim of this systematic review was to determine whether antimicrobial rinse-free hand sanitizer interventions are effective in reducing absenteeism in elementary school children. a detailed written protocol was prepared and reviewed in advance (complete protocol can be obtained from the corresponding author). the target population consisted of elementary school children between 4 and 12 years of age. interventions of interest were those that administered antimicrobial rinse-free hand hygiene programs compared with no intervention or placebo treatment arm in a school setting. outcome of interest was the comparison of the number of absences due to communicable illnesses in children who received the antimicrobial rinse-free hand hygiene intervention. data abstraction Two reviewers (EM, NLS) independently abstracted data from all studies meeting the eligibility criteria, excluding one abstract where EM independently abstracted pertinent information [15], using pre-printed data collection forms presented in appendix 3. if trials were randomized, allocation concealment was assessed and qualitatively evaluated as adequate, inadequate or unclear. data was qualitatively synthesized to examine the overall pattern of studies with respect to study design, population, intervention, and outcome characteristics. the primary outcome, frequency of absences due to communicable illness was analyzed. percent relative differences were presented along with 95 percent confidence intervals as the estimate of intervention effectiveness. the reference lists of all relevant articles were reviewed for additional studies. a letter was sent to all corresponding authors of the articles identified by hand-search. contact experts and the industrial companies that manufactured the antimicrobial hand gels used in the included trials were contacted. a pilot test assessing the eligibility criteria on a sample of articles was not performed. a pilot test assessing the eligibility criteria on a sample of articles was not performed. a pilot test assessing the eligibility criteria on a sample of articles was not performed. two reviewers (EM, NLS) independently assessed the quality of each of the included studies, excluding the abstract by Thompson (2004) previously mentioned [15], using the previously validated 3-item Jadad scale. studies were not given a quantitative score; rather this was used as a qualitative tool. if trials were randomized, allocation concealment was assessed as adequate, inadequate or unclear. a total of 211 citations were identified, of which 70 were duplicates. 18 potentially relevant trials were retrieved from the searches of the electronic databases. no trials meeting the inclusion criteria in LOE were found during the study selection phase. our overall agreement was 89 percent. when examining items relating to blinding and assessment of withdrawals and dropouts, observer agreement was 100 and 80 percent. parents reported events Grouped by classroom 10 weeks (4 weeks first arm, 2 week washout period, 4 weeks second arm) each child received 1-oz bottle of SAB (CleanHands\u00ae) instant hand sanitizer. each child received 1-oz bottle of sAB (cleanHands\u00ae) (alcohol-free) instant hand sanitizer. reinforcement was given to students after 1st week. each classroom visited twice by school nurse during two arms. instructed to wash hands as usual. children grades K-3 \u2022 4 schools with 2 classrooms, 1 school with 1 classroom \u2022 n = 145 students \u2022 Infectious process such as cold, flu, and gastroenteritis \u2022 Had to be 5 days between episodes to count Grouped by classroom 3 months \u2022 Education: presentation and video describing germs and proper handwashing techniques. no exclusions from the population were necessary Not Relevant Sample size calculation not defined; statistical methods unclear; no parental consent form; study not approved by a formal university institutional review board (approved by school board of education); limited SES diversity; soap and handwashing not monitored. trials varied in size (range = 138 to 6080 students; range = 1 to 18 schools), and geographic locations (Pennsylvania [10], California [27,37], Ohio [27,37], Ohio/Tennessee/Delaware/California [31], new England [16]. one study assessed both private and public schools [41], while one's type of school assessed was not available. four of the five studies, as previously mentioned, discussed withdrawals and dropouts. the description was quite basic and detailed flow-diagrams outlining the passage of participants through the trial were not supplied [16,27,31,41]. four studies received industrial sponsorship either by GOJO industries or Woodward Laboratories. the experimental group in the trial completed by Guinan et al. (2002) had a 49% (95% CI = 42\u201356%) reduction in absences due to communicable illness. Dyer et al. (2000) had a 34 % (95% CI = 10\u201350%) reduction in absences due to communicable illness in the experimental group.
