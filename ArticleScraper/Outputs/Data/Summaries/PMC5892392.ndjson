{"summary": "cheetahs retain only 0.1\u20134% of overall genetic variation seen in most living species, much lower than other well-known examples of genetic impoverishment including Tasmanian devils, Virunga gorillas, Amur tigers, and even highly inbred domestic cats and dogs. all cheetahs have actually disarmed 4 MHC genes entirely. the rate of single nucleotide variation (x axis) for each individual was estimated using all variant positions. the first 7 chromosome homologues of the genomes of Boris, Cinnamon and Chewbacca are displayed for direct comparison. cheetah genome analyses revealed AKAP4, a testis-expressed gene known to regulate sperm development in humans and mice. AKAP4 showed a remarkable signatures of selection due to 10 fixed substitutions in coding regions. this evolutionary gene alteration becomes a strong candidate to explain the spermatazoal abnormalities discovered in all cheetahs studied decades ago. cheetah populations then grew to hundreds of thousands by the 19th century AD. this misunderstanding led to a few deliberate assaults on the importance of genetic diversity compared to traditional ecological, demographic, or even stochastic threats to small endangered populations. this argument has been addressed thoroughly in our view by counter opinions and a more balanced interpretation of demographic and genetic risks. cheetahs rescued from traps have been offered for reintroduction in Namibian habitats as well as in several other african countries as a source for species restoration. the Asian cheetah was eliminated by sport hunting and exploitation in India before the 1940s, the only large mammal to go extinct in India in the past 1000 years. the Iranian cheetahs are the single living Asian cheetah population. they are not ideal candidates due to their endangered status, their precarious health, their present isolation into multiple small subpopulations and their political sensitive locale. cheetahs are a continental subspecies of appreciable divergence from African cheetahs. cheetahs are a relict population of less than 50 animals clinging diagnostic, shared derived substitutions for each population were few. 3 sites for Tanzania, 5 for Somalia, 3 for Namibia, and 3 for Iran. such divergence times are quite recent, less than 1/20th of comparable divergence times between Asian versus African lions or leopards. the time of separation for Asian and African cheetahs, with additional relevant examples of separation dates of other species and subspecies. mtDNA Sequences were calibrated to the date of divergence of Acinonyx jubatus jubatus and Acinonyx jubatus raineyi at 4253\u20134514 years ago. et al.

(2004) Asia vs. Africa cheetahs 4500\u20136500 YBP Table 1 MYA, million years ago; YBP, years before present. if affirmed these results would suggest that the Asia-Iranian cheetah is as close to modern African cheetah populations as the latter are to each other. mtDNA analyses showed monophyly of cheetahs from Asia, South Africa, and Somalia. cheetah populations showed modest molecular genetic distances in comparison with Iranian cheetahs. results confirm distinction of Asian to African cheetah populations. the phylogenetic analyses of both mtDNA and microsatellite affirm the Asian monophyly and the relative similarity of Iranian, Indian and African cheetah specimens. this is consistent with a post bottleneck history for all living cheetahs. since 2010 there have been legal assaults on the restoration program. cheetah restoration was based on flawed interpretations of the data available at the time. the Asian cheetah was eliminated by sport hunting and exploitation in India before the 1940s. the only large mammal to go extinct in India in the past 1000 years. the lict population of less than 50 animals has been clinging to survival in Iran since the overthrow of the Shah in 1960s. the cheetahs are not ideal candidates due to their endangered status, their precarious health, their present isolation into multiple small subpopulations and their political sensitive locale. the Asian cheetahs (modern or museum specimens) had not been examined. substitutions for each population were few: 3 sites for Tanzania, 5 for Somalia, 3 for Namibia, and 3 for Iran. such divergence times are quite recent, less than 1/20th of the comparable divergence times between Asian versus African lions or leopards or even human ethnic groups. typesa and estimated years of separation among geographically isolated populations of cheetahs Cheetah populations No. bp steps Time of separation (years) Variance (years) Tanzania vs. Namibia 8\u201310 4383 131 Tanzania vs. Somalia 9\u201310 4657 274 Namibia vs. Somalia 9\u201311 4877 145 Iran vs. Somalia 9\u201310 4657 274 Iran vs. Namibia 12\u201313 6137 439 if affirmed these results would suggest that the Asia-Iranian cheetah is as close to modern African cheetah populations as the latter are to each other. cheetahs in Iran did descend from the same historic bottleneck event which homogenized the African cheetah population 10\u201312000 years ago. tDNA were in effect remarkably similar to ours. they showed monophyly of cheetahs from Asia, South Africa, and Somalia. their results affirm the distinction of Asian to African cheetah populations but also their shallow divergence. atellite affirm the Asian monophyly and the relative similarity of Iranian, Indian and African cheetah specimens, consistent with a post bottleneck history for all living cheetahs. since 2010 there have been legal assaults on the restoration program for numerous reasons. ill-conceived attempt to suspend cheetah restoration into Indian habitat. new data from conservation genetics are weighing in on a wide range of management plans. if history is a lesson some, perhaps many, will benefit from a robust genetic assessment and informed interpretation."}
