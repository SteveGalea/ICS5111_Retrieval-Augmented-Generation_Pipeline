{"summary": "mammalian cells encode incompletely characterized factors that impede virus replication at various stages of the virus replication cycle. these inhibitory, or \u201crestriction\u201d, factors are either expressed constitutively or are induced by type-I interferon (IFN) tetherin inhibits the release of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) the TM and GPI anchor provide two membrane anchors that enable tetherin to tether virions with one domain in the viral envelope and the other in the plasma membrane (PM) of the host cell. the specific sequence of the TM domain is implicated in the interaction between tetherin and its antagonists such as Vpu. the ectodomain contains three Cys residues that are required for the formation of homodimers. HIV-1 Vpu counteracts tetherins from human, chimpanzee, and gorilla. but it is relatively inactive against tetherin from other non-human primates. the requirement for tetherin glycosylation in the inhibition of HIV-1 release remains controversial. asn-linked (N-linked) glycosylation is a highly regulated post-translational modification that is important for the structure and function of eukaryotic proteins. tetherin glycosylation is a highly regulated, post-translational modification that is important for the structure and function of eukaryotic proteins. oligosaccharide modification of one of the sites of tetherin N-linked glycosylation is necessary and sufficient for tetherin-mediated restriction of HIV-1 release. complex-type glycosylation is dispensable for tetherin antiviral function. pNL4-3 and the Vpu-defective counterparts pNL4-3delVpu and pNL4-3Udel have been described previously. cell culture and transfection HeLa and 293T cell lines were maintained in DMEM containing 5% or 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) one day after plating, cells were transfected with appropriate plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000. cells and virus were harvested 24 h post transfection and used for further analysis. chemiluminescence signal was detected by using west Pico or west Femto Chemiluminescence Reagent. protein bands were quantified by using Imagelab-Chemidoc. one day after plating, 293T cells were transfected with wild-type pNL4-3 molecular clones. the cells were washed twice in 1% BSA-PBS for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. the cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse (293T cells) or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit (HeLa cells) IgG secondary antibody in 1% BSA-PBS for 1 h. pNL4-3delVpu and pNL4-3Udel have been described previously. vectors expressing tetherin derivatives bearing an HA tag or an HA tag inserted at residue 154 in the extracellular CC domain of tetherin have been described previously. one day after plating, cells were transfected with appropriate plasmid DNA. cells were either untreated or treated overnight with tunicamycin or kifunensine. cells and virus were harvested 24 h post transfection. 293T cells were transfected with wild-type (WT) or Vpu-defective pNL4-3 molecular clones. one-day post transfection, virions were pelleted in an ultracentrifuge. cell and virus lysates were immunoblotted with HIV-Ig. anti-rabbit (HeLa cells) IgG secondary antibody in 1% BSA-PBS for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde. 5000 gated events were collected using a becton Dickinson fluorescence-activated cell sorting. pNL4-3Udel [61] and pNL4-3delVpu [62] lack a functional Vpu. we transfected 293T cells, which do not express endogenous tetherin. we analyzed virus release in the presence of WT and glycosylation-defective single (N65A or N92A) or double (N65,92A) mutants of human tetherin. 293T cells were transfected with wild-type (WT) or Vpu-defective (delVpu or Udel) pNL4-3 HIV-1 molecular clones and vectors expressing hemagglutininin (HA)-tagged tetherin mutants. one day post transfection, cell and viral lysates were prepared and subjected to western blot analysis with HIV-Ig. tunicamycin treatment significantly disrupted the ability of WT tetherin to inhibit the release of Vpu-defective HIV-1. tunicamycin treatment significantly disrupted the ability of WT tetherin to inhibit the release of HIV-1. tetherin is necessary for its ability to inhibit HIV-1 release. lack of Virus Release Inhibition by N65,92A Tetherin is Linked to Impaired Cell Surface Expression. lack of Virus Release Inhibition by N65,92A Tetherin is Linked to HIV-1 release. lack of antiviral activity of N65,92A tetherin is associated with impaired cell-surface expression. one day post transfection cells were washed, harvested, untreated (control), or treated with anti-HA primary antibody and the Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibody. tetherin is expressed in several forms: a 23-kDa, non-glycosylated species, and species containing a single high-mannose side chain at either Asn 65 or 92 (24.5 kDa), high-mannose side chains at both Asn residues (26 kDa) kifunensine treatment had little or no effect on the ability of tetherin to inhibit the release of Vpu-defective HIV-1. kifunensine treatment shifted the endogenous tetherin from complex-type to high-mannose-modified species. complex-type glycosylation is dispensable for tetherin inhibition of HIV-1 release. 293T cells were transfected with WT, delVpu or Udel pNL4-3 HIV-1 molecular clones. ensine treatment was set to 100%; (B,D) data shown are SD from three independent experiments. complex-type glycosylation of tetherin is not required for its inhibitory function. this suggests complex-type oligosaccharide modifications are not required for cell-surface tetherin expression. cells were fixed, stained with anti-tetherin primary antibodies followed by the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody. tetherin staining is shown in green and 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in blue. cells were harvested and stained with anti-tetherin antisera followed by +1\u00b0+2\u00b0. 293T cells were transfected with tetherin expression vectors that carry an HA-tag in the extracellular CC domain. the median fluorescence intensity of cell-surface tetherin for WT and the single glycosylation mutants was slightly reduced by kifunensine treatment. however, when tetherin-expressing 293T cells were treated with tunicamycin there was a marked reduction in the cell-surface expression of tetherin. 8 hours post transfection, cells were untreated or treated with 10 M kifunensine. cell and viral lysates were collected and subjected to western blot analysis with HIV-Ig, or anti-HA antisera as in Figure 1A. the requirement for N-linked glycosylation in tetherin antiviral function remains to be clearly established. we transfected 293T cells, which do not express endogenous tetherin, with WT and Vpu-defective HIV-1. the double mutant, N65,92A, was unable to inhibit HIV-1 release. the single and double mutants inhibited the release of both delVpu and Udel particles to a similar extent as WT tetherin. the single mutants, N65A and N92A, inhibited the release of both delVpu and Udel particles to a similar extent as WT tetherin. tunicamycin treatment significantly disrupted the ability of WT tetherin to inhibit the release of V. tunicamycin treatment significantly disrupted the ability of WT tetherin to inhibit release of V. tunicamycin treatment had no effect on virus release in the presence of the non-glycosylated tetherin mutant N65,92A. these results support the conclusion that glycosylation of tetherin is necessary for its ability to inhibit HIV-1 release. lack of antiviral activity of tetherin is associated with impaired cell-surface expression. lack of antiviral activity of tetherin is associated with impaired cell-surface expression. lack of antiviral activity of tetherin is associated with impaired cell-surface expression. cytometry histograms are representative of three experiments. cells were co-transfected with the pNL4-3delVpu HIV-1 molecular clone and tetherin expression vector as in Figure 2A. one day post transfection, cells and virus were harvested and subjected to western blot analysis. kifunensine treatment shifted endogenous tetherin from complex-type to high-mannose-modified species. complex-type glycosylation is dispensable for tetherin restriction. 293T cells were transfected with WT, delVpu or Udel pNL4-3 tetherin. transfection cells were untreated or treated with 10 M kifunensine. one day post treatment cell and viral lysates were subjected to western blot analysis with HIV-Ig. VRE was calculated as in Figure 1B; VRE for WT HIV-1 in the absence of kifunensine treatment was set to 100%. complex-type glycosylation of tetherin dispensable for tetherin-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 release. 293T cells were transfected with pNL4-3delVpu and WT and tetherin. kifunensine treatment resulted in the expression of 23-kDa and 24.5-kDa tetherin species. kifunensine treatment resulted in the expression of 23-kDa and 24.5-kDa tetherin species, but not the complex-type tetherins (26 to 32 kDa) in is dispensable for cell-surface expression and inhibition of HIV-1 release. 293T cells were transfected with vectors expressing HA-tagged tetherin mutants (N65A, N92A, and N65,92A) 8 hours post transfection, cells were untreated or treated with 10 M kifunensine as in Figure 3A. cells were transfected with 0.8 g HA-tagged tetherin expression vector and 0.1 g of GFP expression vector. cells were untreated or treated with 1 g/mL tunicamycin. one day later, cells were processed and cell-surface expression was monitored. this loss of cell-surface expression and antiviral activity could not be rescued by increasing the total expression of the N65,92A mutant. other labs have also reported that N-linked glycosylation is essential for inhibition of HIV-1 release [49,50,51,52,53,54] tetherin from an owl monkey kidney cell line was shown to not restrict HIV-1 due to the presence of a Thr at residue 181 that prevented efficient glycosylation. mutation of Thr 181 to Ile rescued its glycosylation and antiviral function [69]. these studies are consistent with the importance of N-linked glycosylation in tetherin activity. this study provides new insights into the number of oligosaccharide side chains required for tetherin transport and activity. this study provides new insights into the role of oligosaccharide modifications in these functions."}
