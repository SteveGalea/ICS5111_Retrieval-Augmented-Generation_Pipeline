{"summary": "in 2000\u20132005, five dog and one human rabies cases were imported into a rabies-free country since 2001. the summer 2004 event led to unprecedented media warnings by the French Public Health Director. we investigated medical practice evolution following the official elimination of rabies in 2001. media-communicated health alerts are being used more frequently by public health decision-makers to prevent consequences of a sudden event. the medical community must consider these communications to be preventive intervention tools for public health officials [1]\u2013[3]. rabies is a viral encephalitis that is considered to be a reemerging zoonosis throughout much of the world. the french network for rabies prophylaxis provides exhaustive national data collected by ARMC [10], and laboratory diagnoses of humans suspected of having rabies. from 1968 to 1998, a period during which rabies was endemic in French foxes, more than 45,600 animals were diagnosed as rabid. the analysis of data collected by the NRCR from the AMRC was done anonymously and approved by the Commission Nationale Informatique et Libert\u00e9. this specific project was submitted to the Institut Pasteur Biomedical Research Committee and was approved on 19 December 2006. 93% of the 36,539 districts are 75 km from an ARMC. area 1 corresponds to the former zone harboring rabies-infected foxes. area 2, has no history of rabies events; and area 3, where rabies event #6 occurred (1,981,313 inhabitants). an event was considered to have an impact when the number of consultations during 2 consecutive weeks exceeded the upper 95% CI. observed values were then replaced by forecasts, to obtain analyses of the subsequent weeks. the national reference center for rabies collected by the AMRC was done anonymously and approved by the Commission Nationale Informatique et Libert\u00e9. this specific project was submitted to the Institut Pasteur Biomedical Research Committee (RBM/2006.025) and was approved on 19 December 2006. 93% of the 36,539 districts are 75 km from an ARMC. area 1 corresponds to the former zone harboring rabies-infected foxes. area 2, has no history of rabies events (37,423,439 inhabitants); and area 3, where rabies event #6 occurred (1,981,313 inhabitants). an event was considered to have an impact when the number of consultations during 2 consecutive weeks exceeded the upper 95% CI. observed values were then replaced by forecasts, to obtain analyses of the subsequent weeks. the number of cases attributed to the event was estimated by subtracting the prediction from the observed data during the impact period. in 2001, france was declared free of rabies in non-flying terrestrial mammals. in 2001, the number of patients consulting at ARMC and given RPEP began to decline progressively to respective minima of 7,788 and 3,378 in 2003. however, the numbers of patients consulting at ARMC and given RPEP suddenly rose in 2004. between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2005, 56,924 rabies-exposed individuals consulted in an ARMC. among them, 50,930 had valid consultation dates and 56,406 had valid treatment information. events #1, #2, #4 and #5 correspond to illegal importations of rabid dogs from Morocco. the dashed red lines for event #3 and #6 represent the upper 95% CI. the weekly number of patients consulting an ARMC declined significantly (slope = 0.34; p0.0001). in October 2003, the weekly number of ARMC patients was significantly higher than the predicted number during the 6 weeks surrounding event #3. 2.5 [59.0\u201366.0] 0.0001 58.6 [55.6\u201361.5] 0.0001 ARIG 1.5 [1.4\u20131.7] 3.3 [2.7\u20133.8] 0.0001 3.53 [3.10\u20133.97] 0.0001 *Reference period. slopes of the ARMC-consultation decline after week 263 and before week 238 were estimated at 0.12 and 0.23. elimination of rabies in foxes reduced the number of rabid pets and other domestic animals, and thus exposure to rabies, pet bites continue. however, the number of RPEP prescriptions and the associated costs will not decline significantly until there is adequate assurance that the probability of a pet being rabid is sufficiently low that such therapy is not warranted. rabies-control policies in rabies-free countries are expected to continue in the future. a specific communication strategy was established for the ARMC network to provide information concerning the evolution of the epidemiological situation. the information was disseminated via the websites of the NRCR, the Ministry of Health, the National Institute for Health Surveillance and the Ministry of Agriculture. to complete this plan, temporary licensing of a multidose vaccine was accorded and ARIG injections were postponed, as necessary, in accordance with WHO guidelines. eric liu: event #6 heightened public awareness of rabies risk. liu: public health authorities decided to eradicate free-roaming dogs. liu: public health crises showed how conflicting messages can create confusion. liu: rabies event could have raised public awareness about importing animals from endemic countries. event #6 and its associated national newspaper coverage profoundly perturbed health services, with excessive consulting at ARMC and durably increased antirabies drug rates for several months. this crisis highlighted a lack of experienced manpower and insufficient vaccine stocks. this crisis highlighted a lack of experienced manpower and insufficient vaccine stocks. public health decision-makers have to anticipate the depth and scope of potential consequences of emerging or reemerging infectious diseases and their related press communications. it also illustrated that long-term modifications of ARMC activities and prescriptions were observed, further emphasizing that a post-crisis communication strategy is essential."}
