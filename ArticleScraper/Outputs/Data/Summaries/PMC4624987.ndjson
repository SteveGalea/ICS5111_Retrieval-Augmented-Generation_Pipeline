{"summary": "in humans, 90% of intestinal and 50% of vaginal IgA is produced locally. induction of mucosal immunity best achieved via mucosal infection or vaccination. studies using broadly neutralizing antibodies (BnAb) have shown protection against mucosal transmission. in 2003, Xin and colleagues employed recombinant Lactococcus lactis to induce HIV-specific immune responses. cholera toxin was used as an adjuvant and is not acceptable for use in humans. cholera toxin was used as an adjuvant and is unlikely to induce a broadly protective immune response. mohamadzadeh et al. constructed recombinant L. acidophilus producing the protective antigen and succeeded in inducing protective immunity in a murine model [21]. we inserted a linear epitope from the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of HIV-1 into the highly expressed bacterial surface layer protein (SlpA) of L. acidophilus as a prototype oral mucosal vaccine platform. a modified slpA gene including in-frame MPER peptide-encoding sequence was generated by overlap PCR. 1 kb DNA fragments of upstream and downstream regions were amplified using primer pairs AK_63 and AK_55. each DNA fragment was amplified using either PCK_1 & AK_80. the established plasmid, pGAD17, was introduced into L. acidophilus NCK2208, the strain displaying MPER. the nucleotide sequences of the primers are described in S2 Table. female Balb/c mice (8\u201310 weeks old) were immunized intragastrically (i.g.) with genetically modified L. acidophilus strains. three daily doses of the bacterial suspensions (2109 CFU in 200 l) were administered to mice on weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6. mucus and epithelium were removed in PBS supplemented with 1 mM dithiothreitol and 5 mM EDTA. the tissues were then cut into small pieces, suspended in digestion medium, and applied to GentleMACS dissociator. ELISA Ready-Set-Go! (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) was used to determine class and subclass of anti-MPER Abs. IL-1 secreted by L. acidophilus GAD19 and IL-6 released from stimulated murine splenocytes and Peyer\u2019s patch cells were quantified. protocol #11-3041A was approved by the Colorado State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. animal welfare and health was monitored daily and in instances where medical intervention was not effective, animals were humanely euthanized. pTRK1053 was introduced into L. acidophilus NCK1910 by electroporation. mutation in slpA was validated by PCR. each DNA fragment was amplified using either PCK_1 & AK_80. horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-human IgG was used. signal was detected using ECL Plus (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) and visualized by Molecular Imager VersaDoc. vaginal lavage prepared by suspending vaginal fluid with PBS using pipet. insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation. samples were stored at -80\u00b0C. anti-mouse IgG or IgA were used as the detection antibodies. color development with 3,3\u2019,5,5\u2019-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was terminated with sulfuric acid and absorbance at 450 nm was measured. slpA modified strain derived from L. acidophilus NCK1909 was constructed by gene replacement. similar sizes of DNA fragments were amplified in both wild type and mutant strains when the outer primers were applied. the exposed MPER epitope was detected using 2F5 mAb. total cell proteins and purified S-layer proteins of NCK1909 and NCK2208 were separated by SDS-PAGE. western blot analysis using 2F5 (anti-MPER monoclonal human IgG) plasmid coding for the mature form of murine IL-1 in a secretory expression cassette, termed GAD19. supernatants from the IL-1-secreting strain, GAD19 were added to mouse lymphocytes from Peyer\u2019s patch and spleen and IL-6 levels were measured. another derivative strain, GAD31, was constructed with pTRK882 as a reference strain. cytokines were rarely detected in MPER-stimulated or non-stimulated splenocyte cultures. moderate amounts of multiple cytokines were released from spleen cells stimulated with S-layer protein. antigen specific serum IgG and mucosal IgA were titrated by ELISA. endpoint titers of MPER-specific serum IgG were much higher than those at the first study. mucosal IgA specific to MPER was also detected in most immunized mice. additional boosts with GAD19 evoked readily detectable levels of systemic and mucosal MPER-specific Ab responses. modified strain derived from L. acidophilus NCK1909 was constructed by gene replacement. resulting strain includes the 16-mer MPER-encoding sequence integrated into SlpA. similar sizes of DNA fragments were amplified in both wild type and mutant strains when the outer primers were applied. the exposed MPER epitope was detected by flow cytometry. the L. acidophilus strains labeled with 2F5 and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-human IgG were analyzed. gene modified strains of L. acidophilus, GAD19, GAD31, and NCK1895 were administered to mice via intragastric route. freshly isolated lymphocytes were analyzed to determine relative population of CD19+ CD38+ cells among CD45+ cells. relative B cell population were variable in GAD19-immunized group. values under detection limit (2 for IgG and 1 for IgA) are not shown in the chart. each symbol represents an individual mouse. Isotype analysis of the MPER-specific serum antibody induced by GAD19 revealed that IgG2b was dominant. only small part of anti-MPER could be detected due to low sensitivity. ous 16-mer peptide reproduced the corresponding structure of HIV-1. work is ongoing to successfully engineer the insertion of longer and/or multiple peptides. in previous studies, S-layer proteins of different strains were engineered to include a c-Myc epitope. the specific IgA-producing cells were detected exclusively in the group receiving the IL-1-secreting strain. both L. acidophilus strains eventually elicited MPER-specific Ab responses regardless of IL-1 co-expression. this suggests that IL-1 was not essential for, but possibly expedited the specific immune responses. o restimulation of splenocytes with MPER peptide induced little or no cytokine production. this suggests the MPER peptide embedded in the S-layer protein did not stimulate a T cell response and that the MPER-specific antibody response was T cell independent. this suggests the major subclass of MPER-specific antibody was IgG2b. recombinant L. acidophilus can induce a protective mucosal and systemic antibody response against HIV-1 without activating mucosal T cell targets. it remains to be confirmed, in an appropriate animal model, whether recombinant IL-1 secreted by GAD19 was secreted by western blot. culture supernatants of GAD19 including 1 ng/ml of IL-1 (black bar) were added to peyer\u2019s patch or spleen cells of Balb/c mice and incubated for 72 hours. the same volume of the culture supernatant of GAD31 (gray bar) and 1 ng/ml of purified IL-1 (open bar) were also tested. Diluted serum (1/100) from each time point was analyzed by ELISA. Arrows represent timing of the gavage."}
