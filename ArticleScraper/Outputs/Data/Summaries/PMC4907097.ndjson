{"summary": "lncRNAs are regulated by epigenetic mechanisms that coordinate gene expression changes required to transition from totipotency to more-differentiated states. the placenta is formed about 1 week postconception and is a transient organ derived from the embryo. the placenta originates in the preimplantation blastocyst, from the outer trophectoderm (TE) cells. the placenta is a physical barrier between the mother and fetus. emerging data indicate that the placenta is also an immunological barrier that prevents transmission of pathogens to the fetus. the placenta directly contact the maternal blood supply. lncRNA regulates the innate immune response in the early human placenta. human embryonic stem cells (hESCs; HUES-7 and HUES-9 cell lines) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) under 4% oxygen and passaged manually as described previously. lncRHOXF1 RNA was detected using a Cy3-labeled probe of lncRHOXF1 cDNA (800 nucleotides [nt]) lncRHOXF1 RNA was detected using a Cy3-labeled probe of lncRHOXF1 cDNA (800 nucleotides [nt]) lncRHOXF1 RNA isoforms are present in the nucleus and cytoplasm. qRT-PCR analysis of lncRHOXF1 expression for in vitro-differentiated hESCS to mesoderm, endoderm, and trophectoderm line. qRT-PCR analysis of lncRHOXF1 expression in human placental samples from 8-, 9-, and 10-week conceptuses. lncRHOXF1 expression in transformed epithelial fetal kidney cells (293T), placental choriocarcinoma cells (JEG3), transformed trophoblast cells (HTR-8), fibroblast foreskin cells (BJ) and BMP4/A/P-different lncRHOXF1 RNA transcripts are present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. lncRHOXF1 RNA transcripts are present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. hESCs lack detectable lncRHOXF1 transcripts. clone 23 and clone 28 tested five replicates for each condition. we followed the cells for over five passages. Statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed paired Student's t test. overexpression of lncRHOXF1 increases the number of embryoid bodies during differentiation. the P value was determined using a two-tailed t test to compare untreated versus induced samples. microarray analyses were performed using male HUES7 cells. undifferentiated HUES9 cells containing the lncRHOXF1 and rtTA3 cDNAs were used in overexpression experiments. RNA was processed using the NuGEN Ovation Pico system (for knockdown) and the TargetAmp Nano labeling kit (for overexpression experiments) the medium lacked -FGF and contained 50 ng/ml BMP4, 1 M A83-01 (Tocris) and 0.1 M PD173074 (Tocris) was added the next day and refreshed every 48 h for the course of the differentiation. three small interfering RNA target sequences for lncRHOXF1, a control scramble siRNA, and siRNA for hnRNP U were designed and manufactured by Dharmacon. images were captured and positions recorded. slides were refixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, treated with RNase A. cells were either cytospun (hESCs and hiPSCs) or grown on chamber slides. each chamber was washed, then hybridization buffer containing denatured lncRHOXF1 probe was added. qRT-PCR analysis of lncRHOXF1 expression in human placental samples from 8-, 9-, and 10-week conceptuses. lncRHOXF1 expression in transformed epithelial fetal kidney cells (293T), placental choriocarcinoma cells (JEG3), transformed trophoblast cells (HTR-8), fibroblast foreskin cells (BJ) and BMP4/A/P-different lncRHOXF1 cDNA was amplified by PCR with NcoI and KpnI restriction sites. lncRHOXF1 cDNA was amplified by PCR with NcoI and KpnI restriction sites. cells were disrupted to preserve the nucleus, then fixed prior to probe hybridization. quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) experiments. total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and 500 ng was reverse transcribed with random primers using qScript cDNA master mix. control reaction mixtures without reverse transcriptase were also prepared. clones 23 and 28 were performed and yielded similar results. overexpression of lncRHOXF1 promotes cellular differentiation by changing gene expression. the reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA3) was constitutively expressed. a heat map indicates clustering of upregulated and downregulated genes for the 162 differentially expressed genes in HUES9-lncRHOXF1 cells (clone 28) treated or not with doxycycline. bMP4/A/P-differentiated hESCs were used for siRNA-mediated knockdown of lncRHOXF1 cells. lncRHOXF1 encodes a lncRNA expressed in the human trophectoderm lineage. we hypothesized that lncRNAs important for early placental development would be robustly expressed in extraembryonic cells and missing in the early epiblast. using this criterion, we identified a gene (ENSG00000234493; RHOXF1P1; LNCRHOXF2B), which we named qRT-PCR analysis of decreased NANOG expression during BMP4/A/P differentiation. qRT-PCR analysis of increased placentation markers CDX2 and hCG- expression during BMP4/A/P differentiation. lncRHOXF1 gene is 4.8 kb in size and located within the reproductive homeobox gene locus on the X chromosome. phyloCSF analysis of the lncRHOXF1 gene yielded negative values. rhesus monkeys, dogs, and elephants have significant matches across the human lncRHOXF1 gene. lncRHOXF1 encodes a recently evolved lncRNA from the X chromosome. DNA methylation profiles for the CpG island of lncRHOXF1 across these different cell lines varied from being unmethylated (for the primary cell H1 hESCs and the B lymphocyte line GM12878) to hypermethylated for the three carcinoma cell lines (A549, HepG2, and HeLa), consistent with the frequently observed hypermethylation of cancer cells. we validated the presence of lncRHOXF1 RNA during early human preimplantation development lncRHOXF1 expression was highest during days 2 to 4 of BMP4/A/P differentiation. female hESCs and hiPSCs express very little lncRHOXF1 RNA. lncRHOXF1 expression was highest during days 2 to 4 of BMP4/A/P differentiation. lncRHOXF1 is expressed in early progenitor cells that have recently exited the pluripotent state. lncRHOXF1 RNA is a spliced and polyadenylated cytoplasmic transcript in human placental progenitor cells. lncRHOXF1 RNA was expressed at very low (but detectable) levels in placenta-derived transformed cell lines. lncRHOXF1 is 961 nucleotides in length and is spliced and polyadenylated. this transcript is abundant and easily detectible in nuclei from hESCs, hiPSCs, JEG-3 cells, and primary EVTs. the presence of lncRHOXF1 transcripts in hESCs suggests that this transcript has the potential to regulate gene expression in trans, acting at the RNA level and not through transcriptional interference. to determine the functional relevance of the lncRHOXF1 RNA during early human development, we used a gain-of-function approach to induce expression in undifferentiated hESCs. HUES9-lncRHOXF1 clones 23 and 28 treated with DOX expressed more lncRHOXF1 than did BMP4/A/P-differentiated trophoblast progenitors. we observed that DOX-treated HUES9-lncRHOXF1 cells required less frequent passaging than wild-type hESCs. altered genes clustered into two groups depending on direction of expression change (upregulated or downregulated) gene ontology analysis showed they belonged to categories pertaining to DNA replication, cell adhesion, cell migration, and development of bone and blood. gene set enrichment analysis showed that HUES9-lncRHOXF1 cells were significantly enriched for genes involved in DNA synthesis and elongation, DNA replication, and oxidative phosphorylation. lncRHOXF1 disruption increased the expression of the three viral sensing genes IFIT1, MX1, and IFIH1. lncRHOXF1 disruption increased the expression of the three viral sensing genes IFIT1, MX1, and IFIH1. lncRHOXF1 RNA disruption increases viral response gene expression in human trophoblast progenitors. qRT-PCR analysis verifying lncRHOXF1 expression and knockdown for three independent siRNA transfections. Statistical significance was calculated using a two-tailed Student's t test. representative results from one experiment are shown. lncRHOXF1 expression increased with lncRHOXF1 disruption. lncRHOXF1 RNA increases following viral infection, and knockdown affects virus infectivity. infected cells treated with siRNAs against lncRHOXF1 expressed less Sendai viral protein mRNA (SEV-NP) than scrambled siRNA-treated or untreated cells. these results confirmed our hypothesized enhanced antiviral state of cells with reduced lncRHOXF1 expression. qRT-PCR analysis of lncRHOXF1 RNA levels in infected and uninfected cells. results normalized to those for untreated controls. lncRHOXF1 encodes a lncRNA expressed in the human trophectoderm. lncRHOXF1 RNA is one of the most abundant lncRNAs expressed in human trophectoderm cells. reads were also detected at the 4-cell to morula stage of embryos. lncRHOXF1 RNA is robustly expressed during early human development. qRT-PCR analysis of lncRHOXF1 expression in male hESCs (blue) and hiPSCs (green) during BMP4/A/P differentiation of human female pluripotent stem cells. lncRHOXF1 gene is 4.8 kb in size and located within the reproductive homeobox gene locus on the X chromosome. the human RHOX genes are not well characterized, but they are expressed in o the lncRHOXF1 gene is also located near another long noncoding RNA, RHOXF1-AS1 (NR_131238; ENST0000553843; RP4-755D9.1). according to the NONCODE database, RHOXF1-AS1 is predominantly expressed in breast and thyroid tissues, and its expression is quite low in placenta and ovary. hESCs and hiPSCs express very little lncRHOXF1 RNA, in vitro. lncRHOXF1 is expressed in human trophoblast development. hESCs express very little lncRHOXF1 RNA, in vitro. lncRHOXF1 expression was highest during days 2 to 4 of trophoblast differentiation. female trophoblast progenitors expressed greater levels of lncRHOXF1 transcript than differentiated male cells. lncRHOXF1 was expressed at low levels in first-trimester human placentas (8-, 9-, and 10-week gestational age) and at higher levels in primary EVTs. lncRHOXF1 RNA is a spliced and polyadenylated cytoplasmic transcript in human placental progenitor cells. using RNA isolated from BMP4/A/P-differentiated hESCs, we performed rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) to determine the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the lncRHOXF1 transcript. lncRHOXF1 RNA is abundant in the nucleus of human trophoblast progenitor cells. the brightest pinpoint observed in all nuclei corresponded to the nascent lncRHOXF1 transcript that overlapped with one X chromosome. lncRHOXF1 RNA is abundant in the nucleus of human trophoblast progenitor cells. overexpression of lncRHOXF1 RNA in hESCs induces differentiation. we cloned exons 1 to 4 of lncRHOXF1 into a targeting construct for DOX-inducible expression from the AAVS.1 \u201csafe harbor\u201d locus on chromosome 19. HUES9-lncRHOXF1 clones 23 and 28 treated with DOX had greater numbers of EBs than untreated cells. lncRHOXF1 expression in hESCs reduced cellular growth rates. disruption of lncRHOXF1 RNA in human placental progenitors increases viral response gene expression. we used siRNAs to disrupt lncRHOXF1 expression during in vitro BMP4/A/P differentiation of hESCs. we optimized transfection and differentiation conditions and achieved a maximum of 60 to 70% knockdown efficiency via BMP4/A/P differentiation on day 3. lncRHOXF1 disruption increased the expression of the three viral sensing genes IFIT1, MX1, and IFIH1 in day 3 BMP4/A/P-differentiated human cells. lncRHOXF1 disruption increased viral response gene expression in human trophoblast progenitors by using qRT-PCR. genes in red are viral signature response genes; green denotes immune response genes. qRT-PCR analysis for expression of viral response genes normalized to results with GAPDH. representative results from one experiment are shown. lncRHOXF1 RNA functions in trans to suppress expression of genes involved in the immune response to virus infection in human placental progenitor cells. lncRHOXF1 RNA increases following viral infection, and knockdown affects virus infectivity. the levels of lncRHOXF1 and lncRHOXF1 were significantly reduced. we did not observe changes with IFN- and IL-29 induction. we conclude that reducing lncRHOXF1 levels protected early human trophectoderm progenitor cells from Sendai virus infection. lncRHOXF1 is one of the most abundantly expressed lncRNAs in human placental progenitor cells. lncRHOXF1 transcripts were most abundant in TE and primitive endoderm cells, yet absent in epiblast cells of human blastocyst-stage embryos. lncRHOXF1 RNA was almost undetectable in 8- to 10-week placentas and fetal somatic cell lines. it is possible that lncRHOXF1 is expressed in just one of the many cell types present in 8- to 10-week placentas. lncRHOXF1 RNA is abundant in mesoderm and endoderm progenitor cells. hESCs with elevated lncRHOXF1 RNA had more morphological evidence of differentiated cells despite the presence of -FGF in the medium. lncRHOXF1 RNA expression altered expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport/ATP synthesis, respiratory electron transport, and mitochondrial protein import. lncRHOXF1 RNA was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. we did not detect lncRHOXF1 RNA transcripts in undifferentiated hESCs. lncRHOXF1 RNA levels could be reduced using siRNAs. the secondary structure of lncRHOXF1 RNA recruits repressive histone modifier complexes to certain viral sensor genes to regulate their expression. the innate immune system responds to viral infection via PRRs that sense cytoplasmic virus-derived RNAs. both IFIH1 (MDA5) and DDX58 (RIG-I) are PRRs that are induced when lncRHOXF1 expression is reduced. lncRNAs regulate expression of IFN-, tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-8, and interferon-stimulated genes. lncRNAs NeST, THRIL, NEAT1, and NRAV regulate expression of IFN-, tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-8, and interferon-stimulated genes. lncRNAs can regulate innate immune response during pathogen infection. human trophoblasts continue to sense and respond to the presence of Sendai virus following lncRHOXF1 RNA disruption. work is necessary to examine whether other viruses increase lncRHOXF1 expression in human trophectoderm progenitors."}
