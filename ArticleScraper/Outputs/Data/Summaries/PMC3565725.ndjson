{"summary": "individuals with the potential to be highly infectious can be referred to as a \u2018super-shedders\u2019. a major challenge in disease biology is to identify some of the mechanisms that may generate super-shedders. a broad antagonism in immune mechanisms in response to the two different types of parasite may be expected to generate differential infection dynamics [20] helminths typically induce cytokines associated with a T-helper cell type 2 (Th2) immune response, which simultaneously downregulates T-helper cell type 1 (Th1) cytokines. as such, this antagonism may alter co-infection dynamics. quantitative counts of self-bioluminescent bacteria were made in vivo (the bacterial load), whereas the number of eggs shed by helminths and their development to infective stages (L3 larvae) were used as a proxy measure of helminth infectiousness. the lux operon is driven by the fha promoter. it is constitutively expressed such that bacteria are self-bioluminescent. the light emitted was quantified in vivo using BLI. the light output (RLUs) from self-bioluminescent bacteria correlate positively with viable counts of bacteria in vivo. previous studies have shown the light output (RLUs) from self-bioluminescent bacteria to correlate positively with viable counts of bacteria in vivo. spline terms are included in the random model where only 1 d.f. is used. we also included host identification as a random term to control for pseudo-replication (i.e. autocorrelation errors) a unique identification number for each animal was included in the model as a random term to remove the variation caused by individuals in order to gain insights into any underlying relationships in the fixed model. to quantify whether co-infection generated super-shedders, we defined super-shedders as individuals (from the co-infected treatment group) that were 2 s.d.s above the mean of single-infected individuals. an additional 72 female mice were infected and kept under the same conditions as the in vivo treatment groups. three animals per treatment group were euthanized at days 0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 post-inoculation. the lungs, trachea, nasal cavity and gastrointestinal tract were removed. quantitative counts of self-bioluminescent bacteria were made in vivo. the number of eggs shed by helminths and their development to infective stages were used as proxy measure of helminth infectiousness. a persistent nasal infection was observed for more than 5 days in a row. the lux operon is driven by the fha promoter. it is constitutively expressed such that bacteria are self-bioluminescent. the light emitted was quantified in vivo using BLI. image was acquired over a 5 minute period and the software Living Image (v. 2.6.1, Xenogen Corporation, Almeda, TX, USA) was used to quantify the light emission in vivo from B. bronchiseptica lux+. previous studies have shown the light output (RLUs) from self-bioluminescent bacteria to correlate positively with viable counts of bacteria in vivo. spline terms are included in the random model where only 1 d.f. is used. we also included host identification as a random term to control for pseudo-replication (i.e. autocorrelation errors) a unique identification number for each animal was included in the model as a random term to remove the variation caused by individuals. to quantify whether co-infection generated super-shedders, we used the distribution of eggs shed from the helminth-only infected animals as a baseline distribution. to determine whether the number of helminth, eggs shed were a good proxy for transmission potential of the helminth, we cultured helminth eggs from faecal samples to their infectious an additional 72 female mice (four treatments six time points three replicates) were infected. three animals per treatment group were euthanized at days 0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 post-inoculation. the lungs, trachea, nasal cavity and gastrointestinal tract were removed. correlation between light output (measured in relative light units) and colony-forming units in hosts infected with self-bioluminescent Bordetella bronchiseptica lux+. results 3.1. How does co-infection alter bacterial establishment, growth and load\" bacterial load measured by photons per unit area (photons s1 cm2) emitted by self-bioluminescent Bordetella bronchiseptica (B. bronchiseptica lux+) from a subsample (n = 3) of a larger treatment group of BALB/c mice (n = 10) over a 22-day period. the bacterial load is represented by the colours displayed on a rainbow scale, where violet is assigned to the infected animals over the course of the experiment (2 = 34.2, d.f. = 19, p = 0.017; figure 4). Survivorship curves over 300 days of three different treatment groups (n = 10 per group); infection with the respiratory bacterium Bordetella bronchiseptica (dotted line) and co-infection with both B. bronchiseptica and H. polygyrus (solid line) the mean total number of eggs shed over the duration of the experiment was 1072 498 s.d. to quantify how many super-shedders co-infection generated, we quantified how many individuals from the co-infected group were shedding helminth eggs at a rate 2 s.d. above single-infected. the number of helminths in single infections decreased significantly between days 12 and 48, but not in co-infected mice. the number of eggs shed by each helminth decreased significantly between days 12 and 48, but not in co-infected mice. on day 21 post-inoculation, the numbers of eggs shed were 12.7 2.6 s.e. EPG faeces in single infected and 14.2 3.5 s.e. EPG of faeces in co-infected hosts. no significant difference was found in viability of the larvae between single and co-infected animals. significantly higher bacterial loads were found in the lungs of co-infected animals compared with single-infected animals. there was no significant difference between mean whole body bacterial load of single and co-infected animals (GLMM: F2,28 = 2.50; p = 0.11) and in mean bacterial load in the nose and trachea between co-infected and single-infected animals (GLMM: F2,28 = 1.14; p = 0.35) the bacterial load is represented by the colours displayed on a rainbow scale. the lux measurement of the animal in position 3 was 2 s.d.s higher than average. a significantly higher mortality of co-infected animals over the course of the experiment (2 = 34.2, d.f. = 19, p = 0.017; figure 4). one single-infected individual shed helminth eggs for 320 days. all other single-infected individuals shed eggs on average for 79 9 days. super-shedding was not due to presence of secondary infection. animals in the co-infected groups were super-shedders according to our definition. adult helminths were found on days 12, 24 and 48 in both single and co-infected treatment groups. groups of mice were euthanized and dissected 12, 24 or 48 days after infection. groups of mice were euthanized and dissected 12, 24 or 48 days after infection. number of eggs per adult helminth in single and co-infected mice. co-infection could be a factor contributing to the commonly observed variation in individual infection load and host infectiousness. co-infection is not without a cost to the host. co-infection is not without a cost to the host. one helminth-only infected host shed parasite eggs for 320 days. all other single-infected individuals cleared helminth infection on average by day 799 days post-infection. bacterial load in some, but not all co-infected hosts reached higher than average loads by 2 s.d.s. co-infection is not the case that all super-shedders are co-infected. the difference in helminth infection intensity in co-infection versus single infection was likely to be mediated by the host's immune system. helminth establishment was initially the same in single and co-infected groups. ecology and the investigation of co-infection used here was novel. using real-time, whole animal, in vivo monitoring of B. bronchiseptica infection allowed us to determine spatial location, real-time infection load, observe high bacterial loads early in the infection (day 2) and significantly reduce the number of animals used in the experiment, thereby contributing to the 3Rs for animal use in research. fp-reporters and traditional techniques such as counting CFUs on growth media."}
