{"summary": "Background Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are frequent in children and complications can occur in patients with chronic diseases. we evaluated the frequency and impact of ARI and influenza-like illness episodes on disease activity. there have been no published studies on the prevalence of viral respiratory infections in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients. there have been no published studies on the prevalence of viral respiratory infections in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients. influenza vaccine was offered between April and July 2008, during the surveillance 2 period. patients with at least one of the following criteria were excluded from vaccination. patients with ARI and/or ILI had nasopharyngeal swabs collected for viral detection within the first 72 hours of symptoms. the attack rate was expressed as ARI episodes per 1,000 child-days at risk. a child-day was considered as 1 day of study for each child in the cohort. respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) A and B, metapneumovirus (HMPV), parainfluenza virus (HPIV) 1 and 3, bocavirus (HBov), adenovirus (HAdv), rhinovirus (HRV) and coronavirus OC43 e 229E (HCov) nucleic acids extracted from 200 L of sample using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit. HI titers were determined by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) prior to and 30-40 days post vaccination. the working dilution of each antigen contained four HI units in 25 l. the titer of a serum not showing any inhibition was assigned a value of 5. the vaccinated group, a seroconversion rate exceeding 40%, and a seroconversion factor exceeding 2.5 are considered cut-off levels of vaccine immunogenicity. the data were fitted in a zero-inflated Poisson model. the surveillance occurred during the months of peak occurrence of ARI in two consecutive years. of the ninety eligible JIA patients, 61 participated of SV1 (15 patients lost follow up during SV1 and 14 patients were not able to attend regular visits due to home distance from the hospital. JIA flares were defined as worsening by at least 40% in two or more of the six criteria in the ACRPed index. disease activity was defined as presence of at least one joint with active arthritis or any systemic sign or symptom (fever, rash, vasculitis, hepatosplenomegaly, serositis) patients with ARI and/or ILI had nasopharyngeal swabs collected for viral detection within the first 72 hours of symptoms. the attack rate was expressed as ARI episodes per 1,000 child-days at risk. a child-day was considered as 1 day of study for each child in the cohort. qPCR for HRSVA and B; HCoV OC43 and 229E; and two sets of HRV serotypes; and HAdv and HBoV were done in duplex format. single qPCR with only one pair of primers per reaction was done for HMPVA, HMPVB, influenza A, influenza B, HPIV1, HPIV3 and -actin. the working dilution of each antigen contained four HI units in 25 l. the HI titer was determined as the reciprocal of the last serum dilution that completely inhibited red blood cell agglutination. a 4-fold rise in titers or a rise in titer from 20 to 40 was considered a significant response to vaccination. the student t test was used to compare geometric means of HI titers. a logistic regression model adjusted to these covariates was used. a significance level of 5% was adopted for all tests. 105 ARI episodes were reported during the two surveillance periods. 68 in 44 of 61 (72%) patients during the SV1. 37 in 26 of 63 (41%) patients during the SV2. episodes between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients were significantly more common in unvaccinated patients (p = 0.02) of 33 naso-pharyngeal samples collected during the study, 20 (60.6%) were positive for at least one respiratory virus and viral co-infections were detected in 20% of the positive samples. positive influenza samples were obtained in 5/14 ILI episodes of SV1 (35%) and in 1/7 ILI episodes during SV2 (14%), in a patient included prior to influenza vaccination. all patients with ARI and ILI had favorable outcomes except for one who developed acute otitis media and pneumonia after an ILI episode caused by HPIV infection. rexate NC NILI P 200% increase in number of active joints and 50% increase in ESR 7 days Start nonsteroidal antiinflammatory RSVA/HMPV NILI P Flare Concomitant Increase prednisone dose Flu A ILI P Worsening of morning stiffness and joint effusion. in the total number of flares related to gender, age ( 9 years old and 9 years old), JIA type of onset (oligoarticular, polyarticular or systemic), use of immunosuppressive therapy, period of surveillance (SV1 or SV2) or administration of influenza vaccine. each of the vaccine antigens must meet the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) guidelines. each of the vaccine antigens must meet at least one of the following criteria: seroprotection rate exceeding 70%, seroconversion rate exceeding 40%, and seroconversion factor exceeding 2.5. six patients developed cough and rinorrhea, without fever, during the first ten days after receiving the vaccine. no significant differences were found in JIA activity index (ACRPed30) or doses of prednisone used by patients before and after 30, 90 and 180 days of vaccination. 61 63 44 Age, mean (years) 10.7 10.9 11.0 ILAR categories n (%) Oligoarthritis extended 8 (13.1) 12 (19.6) 11 (17.4) 11 (25) Polyarticular RF - 20 (32.7) 19 (30.1) 12 (27.3) Polyarticular RF+ 4 (6.5) 5 (7.9) 4 (9) Systemic 13 (21.3) 13 (20.6) 7 (16) Undifferentiated arthritis 4 (6.5) 3 (4.8) 1 (2.3) Use twenty-eight of the 105 episodes (26.6%) were characterized as ILI: 23 during SV1 and 5 during SV2 respectively. ARI and ILI episodes were significantly more frequent in SV1 than in SV2 (p 0,01) a total of 28 ILI episodes were reported. positive influenza samples were obtained in 5/14 episodes of SV1 (35%) and in 1/7 episodes during SV2 (14%), in a patient included prior to influenza vaccination. infections and reactivation or worsening of JIA activity parameters in 10 of 70 patients who participated in the epidemiological surveillance 1 and/or 2 for respiratory virus Vrus detected ARI Onset type Signs of disease worsening or flare Temporal relationship Therapeutic decision RSVA NILI** S 10% increase in the number of active joints, 50% worsening of the patient\u2019s subjective evaluation 3 weeks Intra-articular infection HPIV1 ILI S Flare 5 days Increase the dose of methotrexate oligoarticular, polyarticular, S: systemic *NC: not collected. **NILI: ARI not Flu-like. **ILI: worsening by 40% in two or more of the six ACRPed criteria with simultaneous improvement of up to one criterion above 30%. hemagglutination inhibition titers, seroconversion factor, seroconversion rate, and seroprotection rate. each of the vaccine antigens must meet at least one of the following criteria: seroprotection rate exceeding 70%, seroconversion rate exceeding 40%, and seroprotection rate exceeding 2.5. six patients were using corticosteroids at mean daily dose of 0.3 (0.1-0.6) mg/kg/day. one patient was on cyclosporine, and five were receiving anti-TNF drugs at the time of vaccination. response to influenza vaccine was not influenced by age, JIA type of onset, therapeutic regimens or disease activity. no patient reported ILI symptoms during the 6-month post-vaccine follow-up period. the observed attack rate of 7.6 and 3.9 ARI per 1000 child-days in 2007 and 2008 was similar to ARI rates previously reported in healthy children in same age [37] a study showed that 57% of ARI episodes were classified as ILI. HRV was detected in 19.6% of ILI episodes. the frequency and clinical pattern of ARI in patients with chronic disease have been poorly studied. the majority of flares associated with viral infections occurred in patients with systemic onset JIA. we have also assessed the safe, immunogenicity and effectiveness of influenza vaccine. the immunogenicity of influenza vaccine has been previously looked at. influenza vaccine was recently investigated in 27 patients with systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis receiving tocilizumab, an anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody. the authors observed that high-dose prednisolone, but not tocilizumab, impaired the production of influenza antibodies in these patients. in our study the immunogenicity of influenza vaccine was found to be satisfactory. episodes classified as ILI were more common in unvaccinated patients. this difference was not maintained after adjusting for other covariates such as surveillance period, age, immunosuppressant use and active disease. it is not possible to prove that the vaccine was really effective against influenza infections. the work was supported by grants from conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico (CNPQ 308101/2003 to Dr. Ferriani), coordena\u00e7o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de Nvel Superior and Funda\u00e7o de Apoio ao Ensino."}
