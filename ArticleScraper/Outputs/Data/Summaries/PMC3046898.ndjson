{"summary": "a, c, g and t denote corresponding base frequencies. the Z-curve represents a DNA sequence in the manner that each can be uniquely reconstructed given the other. Elhaik et al. made 4 major claims. Elhaik et al. confuse S (a single number) with Z-curve (a series of 3D coordinates), which are distinct. to use S as a case study of Z-curve, by itself, is invalid. in a more recent comment published in Biology Direct, Elhaik et al. dropped the first claim, but still insisted on the equivalence of S and H. they made additional criticisms, which are once again incorrect, and the reasons are summarized in this rebuttal. X, Y, and Z are coordinates of the mapping point P in this coordinate system. x, y, z are the coordinates of the mapping point P in this coordinate system. x, y, z are the coordinates of the mapping point P in this coordinate system. the mistake of Elhaik et al. is the confusion of the original and reduced coordinate systems. 45% of genomes have mapping points outside the inscribed sphere. none has the mapping point outside the inscribed sphere and none has an S value larger than 1/3. Elhaik et al. first found that the distribution of S values follows an exponential distribution. this is a restatement of our previous conclusion [2]. in the former more than 800 genomes of multiple species were studied. in the latter, only 235 bacterial genomes were used. both having 4 variables, a, c, g and t, were reduced into functions of one single variable, a only (eq. A3) this demonstration is invalid. for whole genome sequences, their demonstration is still incorrect. the \"=\" signs in their equations A1 and A2 are still invalid. for genomes that obey a more stringent PR2 rule, the compositions a + g and t + c are only equal approximately, but can never be assumed as exactly exactly the same. in 2004, we first indicated that S and H are negatively correlated for genomes [2], hence the name genome order index. lim 1 H ( X ) = H ( X ) = H ( X ) = p ( x ) log p ( x ) (7) where H (X) is the Shannon entropy. the relation between S and H is complex. in genome segmentation studies, S outperforms H by having a faster computation time. this conclusion is based on the analysis of 235 bacterial genomes. they confuse numeral smallness with biological insignificance. replication origins have been located in more than 1000 bacterial genomes [12,13], and also in archaeal genomes [14], respectively. based on x and y components, replication origins have been located in more than 1000 bacterial genomes [12,13], and also in archaeal genomes [14], respectively. a large number of replication origins have been located in both bacterial and archaeal genomes. the x and y components play an absolutely indispensable role in gene finding algorithms. they have been successfully applied in recognizing protein coding genes in the genomes of L. interrogans Lai [25], B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 [26], B. thuringiensis BMB171 [27], A. mediterranei U32 [27 mapping points of 45% of these genomes were outside the inscribed sphere [5]. their calculation is incorrect, due to the neglect of a parameter. a reduced coordinate system (x, y, z) can be set up. the mistake of Elhaik et al. is due to the confusion of the original and reduced coordinate systems. 45% of genomes have mapping points outside the inscribed sphere. none has the mapping point outside the inscribed sphere. 45% of genomes have mapping points outside the inscribed sphere. none has the mapping point outside the inscribed sphere and none has an S value larger than 1/3. the mistake of Elhaik et al. is the confusion of the original and reduced coordinate systems. et al. extrapolated this conclusion, without any proof, claiming \"S is strictly equivalent to H\" they claimed to have demonstrated \"S is equivalent to H\" and \"S is completely determined from the [Shannon] entropy\" a and t (or c and g) are equal approximately. a and t (or c and g) are equal approximately. for whole genome sequences, their demonstration is invalid. lim 1 H ( X ) = H ( X ) = p ( x ) log p ( x ) (7) where H (X) is the Shannon entropy. lim 1 H ( X ) = H ( X ) = H ( X ) = p ( x ) log p ( x ) (7) where H (X) is the Shannon entropy. S is a linear transformation of a special case (4 alphabetic symbols) of H2 (X) the Gini-Simpson index is a general information index used in many areas. S is proportional to the square of the distance between a point and the RT origin in the mapping system that we proposed. a biological process with a readout that is numerically small does not necessarily mean it is biologically unimportant. a biological process with a readout that is numerically small does not necessarily mean it is biologically unimportant. for genomes, a t and g c confuse numeral smallness with biological insignificance. x and y components are absolutely needed to achieve high gene recognition accuracy. aea [21], viruses and phages [22], especially coronaviruses [23] and new phages Rtp in E. coli [34] and in a pandemic V. parahaemolyticus O3:K6 strain [35]. the genome order index was selected as a case study to the usefulness of the Z-curve method. \"we must conclude that both the Z-curve and S are over complicated measures to GC content and Shannon H index,\" he says. \"the dimension stands for GC content alone suffices to represent any given genome,\" he says. iii) the exponential distribution of S is a restatement of our previous conclusion. iii) Elhaik et al. incorrectly disregard deviations from PR2 by treating the deviations as 0 altogether. they confuse numeral smallness with biological insignificance. the calculated GC content for C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 (NC_003030) was 37.00% [5], while the correct number is 43.27%. the author declares that they have no competing interests. a second point of contention is whether the S statistic and the entropy H = -sum_x f_x log(f_x) are 'equivalent' the dispute here seems to mostly be of a semantic nature. the question is whether there is biological meaning in the deviations from f_c = f_g and f_a = f_t. the current author makes the valid point, in my opinion, that numerically small deviations may still be meaningful biologically. author cites papers that use the Z-curve statistic to find genes and replication origins. he says this seems to confound the question of local compositional biases and their functional implications versus global patterns of base composition. the first 2 claims made by Elhaik et al. are rebutted. the reviewer, however, does disagree with my rebuttal but agree with Elhaik et al. on some issues, to which I will respond point by point. the reviewer, however, does disagree with my rebuttal but agree with Elhaik et al. on some issues. author agrees that some issues are basic. first claim is due to mistakenly neglecting a parameter in coordinate transformation. but first, here the issue is not about whether a topic is basic or not, surprising or not, useful or not; it is about right or wrong. f_a+f_c+f_g+f_t = 1 f_a = f_t f_c = f_g. so we effectively have only 1 degree of freedom left (which is essentially GC-content) both S and H are invertible functions of the remaining degree of freedom, it immediately follows that S can be calculated from H and H from S. the reviewer's discussion is based on the phenomenon in 2 DNA strands. the debate is about PR2, a phenomenon of base compositions in the DNA single strand. the reviewer's discussion is based on the phenomenon in 2 DNA strands. reviewer agrees with Elhaik et al. that the variation of S and H across different genomes is dominated by the variation in GC-content. Elhaik et al. studied the variations of Z-curve's 3 components (x,y,z) using 235 bacterial genomes. found that the z component contributed to most of the variance, comparing to x and y components. author's response Deviations from PR2 result from both mutation and selection pressures. reviewer comments This seems to confound the question of local compositional biases. author's response no. Elhaik et al. concluded that Z-curve suffers from \"over-dimensionality\" reviewer comments Finally, the remark that S can be calculated faster than H does not make a lot of sense to me. if one really worries about computational costs in calculating H one could calculate f*log(f) for all values of before-hand and store them in a table. author's response The reviewer finally suggests that one could calculate f*log(f) for all values beforehand and store them in a table."}
