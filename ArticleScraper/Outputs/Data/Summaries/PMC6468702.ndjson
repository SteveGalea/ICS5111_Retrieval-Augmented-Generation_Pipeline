{"summary": "RNA Viruses are classified into two main groups depending on their genetic material. RNA viruses have double-stranded (dsDNA; e.g., Parvoviridae) genomes. RNA viruses have double-stranded (dsRNA; e.g., Parvoviridae) or single-stranded positive sense ([+]ssRNA; e.g., Flaviviridae) or negative sense ([+] RNA viruses have particular high mutation rates due to lack of proof-reading activity. this allows RNA viruses to rapidly adapt to new environments. they also have potential to rapidly select for advantageous interactions with host factors, including cellular RNA, or avoid those that are non-advantageous. more than 80% of the genome is pervasively transcribed, with only 1\u20132% of transcripts possessing protein-coding potential. ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) regulating protein synthesis and ribosome architecture; transfer-RNAs (tRNAs) acting as adaptor molecules during protein synthesis; small nucleolar RNAs (snRNAs) being the central core of the spliceosome machinery; small nucleolar RNAs (snRNA RNA virus derived ncRNA, including sub-genomic flavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs), can regulate the host cell upon infection. RNA viruses have double-stranded (dsDNA; e.g., Parvoviridae) genomes; RNA viruses have double-stranded (dsRNA; e.g., Reoviridae) or single-stranded positive sense. RNA viruses have particular high mutation rates due to lack of proof-reading activity. retroviridae are (+)RNA viruses with DNA intermediates. this allows RNA viruses to rapidly adapt to new environments and undergo intra-host evolution to avoid cellular immune responses or antiviral therapies. more than 80% of the genome is pervasively transcribed, with only 1\u20132% of transcripts possessing protein-coding potential. ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) regulating protein synthesis and ribosome architecture; transfer-RNAs (tRNAs) acting as adaptor molecules during protein synthesis; small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) being the central core of the spliceosome machinery; small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs regulatory RNAs, such as miRNAs and lncRNAs, are important regulators of the cellular antiviral response. viruses have found ways of utilizing cellular ncRNA. examples include the use of canonical post-transcriptional miRNA repression. miRNA hairpin, a 5\u2032 and a 3\u2032 mature miRNA, given the name extensions -5p and -3p, can be produced. the miRNA guides the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) onto complementary sequences of the target RNA. nucleotides 2\u20137 of the miRNA constitute the core seed region, perfect base pairing. mutation of the seed region of human miR-96 has been associated with progressive hearing loss. miR-208 deletion leads to cardiac function decline due to onset of severe structural abnormalities in mice. de-regulation of the miRNA biogenic pathway affects cell proliferation and viability. RNA viruses have a rapid course of infection and do not require complex gene regulation employed by some DNA viruses. compared to negative-strand RNA viruses, positive-strand viruses may have a further advantage through extensive use of RNA recombination. viral proteins such as PFV-1 Tas and HIV-1 Tat may counteract the miRNA machinery. a defined pool of miRNAs targets the mRNA pool (light blue) in non-infected cells, a defined pool of miRNAs targets the mRNA pool for inhibition of translation or degradation. in infected cells, vRNA (black) can sponge a significant proportion of specific miRNA species resulting in a reduced available pool of that particular miRNA. enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a (+)ssRNA virus belonging to the Picornaviridae. it can cause hand, foot, and mouth disease, encephalitis, and neurological complications. two miR-296-5p binding sites were identified in the coding region of the EV71 genome. none of the miR-296-5p seed sites are conserved across EV71 isolates. studies also suggested that human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) can be directly repressed by the miRNA machinery, with miR-29 binding to the viral 3\u2032 UTR in human T lymphocytes. the miR-29 site is relatively conserved but not for all HIV-1 isolates. the miR-29 site is relatively conserved but not for all HIV-1 isolates. two cellular miRNAs, miR-24 and miR-93, would recognize binding sites on the viral genome and their expression decreased VSV titers. equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a highly virulent mosquito-borne (+)ssRNA virus of the togaviridae family causing systemic disease or encephalitis with high mortality. mutants elicited type I IFN responses and were attenuated in wild-type mice. the EEEV wild-type and miR-142-3p seed site mutants had similar infection kinetics in wild-type mice. the mechanism appears to be EEEV specific and is not conserved for the related VEEV. miR-122 binds two sites located in the HCV 5\u2032 UTR. this was surprising for two reasons, given that miRNAs normally exert their action at the 3\u2032 UTR. it was suggested that miR-122 acts as a switch between translation and replication. studies of the equine non-primate hepacivirus showed that miR-122 binds the viral genome in vivo and that the interaction with the 5\u2032 end of the viral genome also promotes translation. unlike in wild-type mice this virus fails to replicate in miR-122 knock-out mice [78], thus, miR-122 dependency appears to be a general phenomenon among hepaciviruses. agents such as miRNA inhibitors are believed not to lead to the same rapid emergence of resistance variants compared to directing acting antivirals (DAAs) the virus can evolve to acquire mutations that re-direct its tropism by selecting other cellular miRNAs. the BVDV genome contains highly structured, non-capped, non-polyadenylated UTRs and a 5\u2032 UTR IRES. an RNA structure without 5\u2032 cap and 3\u2032 poly-A tail may indeed be necessary to avoid canonical miRNA repression. miR-17 also stimulated viral translation and played a role in protecting the viral genome from RNA decay. miR-21 binding to HCV is absolutely critical, but the reported impact of miR-21 binding was only 2-fold on viral RNA accumulation. an interesting question is therefore whether viral occupancy of specific miRNAs could affect the available pool of these cellular miRNAs and by extension the regulation of their natural mRNA targets. miR-122 is a tumor-suppressor and knockout mice spontaneously develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) it is tempting to speculate that the partial virus induced miR-122 sequestration over years of chronic infection provides an environment fertile for liver cancer. recently developed rat and mouse models for HCV could enable such studies. hVS HSUR2 can bridge miR-16 and miR-142-3p to specific mRNAs by interacting simultaneously with both, resulting in the repression of the mRNA. only few examples of RNA viruses engaging in direct base-pairing interactions with host RNAs other than miRNAs have been described so far. viral nucleocapsid protein (NC) is crucial in facilitating tRNA-PBS interactions. additional sequences embedded in the HIV genome complementary to tRNALys3 have been described to promote the reverse transcription process. a 5\u2032 and a 3\u2032 mature miRNA, given the name extensions -5p and -3p, can be produced from each pre-miRNA hairpin. the relative abundance between the two forms varies greatly between miRNAs, tissues and conditions. regulation in somatic cells has been associated to onset of pathological conditions. for example, deletion of the polycistronic miR-1792 cluster is responsive for severe skeletal defects in humans and mice. mutation of the seed region of human miR-96 has been associated with progressive hearing loss. IFN response EEEV Togaviridae miR-142-3p [45] Increased RNA replication, translation and stability HCV, other pestiviruses Flaviviridae miR-122 [46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56] BVDV, other pestiviruses Flaviviridae miR-17/20/93/106 family (let-7 family) miRNAs targeting viral RNA (vRNA) CDS or 3\u2032 UTR are shown. a defined pool of miRNAs (red bars) targets the mRNA pool (light blue) for inhibition of translation or degradation. in infected cells, a defined pool of miRNAs (red bars) targets the mRNA pool (light blue) for inhibition of translation or degradation. enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a (+)ssRNA virus belonging to the Picornaviridae that can cause hand, foot, and mouth disease, encephalitis, and neurological complications. two miR-296-5p binding sites were identified in the coding region of the EV71 genome and transfecting cells with synthetic oligos mimicking EV71 activity decreased EV71 replication. studies also suggested that human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) can be directly repressed by the miRNA machinery, with miR-29 binding to the viral 3\u2032 UTR in human T lymphocytes. miR-29 site is relatively conserved but not for all HIV-1 isolates. two cellular miRNAs, miR-24 and miR-93, would recognize binding sites on the viral genome and their expression decreased VSV titers. equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a highly virulent mosquito-borne (+)ssRNA virus of the togaviridae family causing systemic disease or encephalitis with high mortality. EEEV has impaired replication in human macrophages and dendritic cells. mutant viruses elicited type I IFN responses and were attenuated in wild-type mice. the EEEV wild-type and miR-142-3p seed site mutants, however, had similar infection kinetics in IFN- receptor knock-out mice. the mechanism appears to be EEEV specific and is not conserved for the related VEEV. ssRNA virus of the Flaviviridae family causing chronic infection of the human liver leading to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. in ground-breaking work, it was shown that HCV replication is critically dependent on the abundant liver-specific miR-122. miR-122 binds two sites located in the HCV 5\u2032 UTR. studies of the equine non-primate hepacivirus (NPHV/EqHV) showed that miR-122 binds the viral genome in vivo and that the interaction with the 5\u2032 end of the viral genome also promote translation [75,76,77]. Interestingly, unlike in wild-type mice this virus fails to replicate in miR-122 knock-out mice [78]. the use of host targeting agents (HTAs) is believed not to lead to the same rapid emergence of resistance variants compared to directing acting antivirals. however, fit miR-122 independent HCV variants have been observed in culture, which does not exclude that the virus may find alternative mechanisms of resistance and escape [85,86]. the BVDV genome contains highly structured, non-capped, non-polyadenylated UTRs and a 5\u2032 UTR IRES. an RNA structure without 5\u2032 cap and 3\u2032 poly-A tail may indeed be necessary to avoid canonical miRNA repression. miR-17 and BVDV are highly conserved across all sequenced pestiviruses supporting a conserved function within this genus. miR-21 binding may function as a switch to control whether the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the viral genome can base pair and thereby circularize the genome. the reported impact of miR-21 binding was only 2-fold on viral RNA accumulation. miR-122 is a tumor-suppressor and knockout mice spontaneously develop hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) it is tempting to speculate that the partial virus induced miR-122 sequestration over years of chronic infection provides an environment fertile for liver cancer. a similar sponge activity was reported for the pestiviruses BVDV and CSFV and the miR-17 family. RNA viruses have a rapid course of infection and do not require complex gene regulation employed by some DNA viruses. positive-strand viruses may have a further advantage through extensive use of RNA recombination. canonical mRNA-like miRNA targeting is only expected if (i) it is an advantage for the virus to be repressed e.g., under certain circumstances. in infected cells, vRNA (black) can sponge a significant proportion of specific miRNA species resulting in a reduced available pool of that particular miRNA. a cellular tRNA (green) complementary to the primer binding site (PBS) sequence in the 5\u2032 region of the viral (+)ssRNA (black) is used to initiate reverse transcription. miR-296-5p seed sites abrogated miRNA-dependent inhibition of viral replication. restoration of miR-296-5p seed sites in non-targeted isolates rescued the phenotype. no clear correlation between miR-296-5p expression and EV71 tissue tropism was identified. depletion of miRNA-pathway components in human somatic cells could help resolve this issue and allow to further study any miRNA mediated effect on viral infection. one study showed that the deletion of Dicer did not increase the infection kinetic of HIV-1, dengue (DENV), west Nile (WNV), yellow fever (YFV), Sindbis (SINV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEEV), measles (MV), influenza A (IAV), ves eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a highly virulent mosquito-borne virus of the Togaviridae family causing systemic disease or encephalitis with high mortality. EEEV has impaired replication in myeloid cells and avoids the activation of type I interferon (IFN) responses. lifies tropism-specific mechanisms that RNA viruses can adopt to use antiviral properties of miRNAs. this concept is also being explored in vaccination approaches using modified viruses attenuated in specific tissues through insertion of miRNA sites. other cases similar to that of EEEV may await discovery. miR-122 promotes translation, stabilizes the IRES architecture and protects the 5\u2032 end of the viral genome from exonuclease activity. it was suggested that miR-122 acts as a switch between translation and replication by competing with binding of poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) to the same region. GB virus B (GBV-B), a virus of unknown origin in small New World monkeys, was the only known HCV-relative in the miR-122 dependency appears to be a general phenomenon among hepaciviruses. hepaciviruses with no attenuation compared to wild-type can be generated in the laboratory. hepaciviruses prefer miR-122 dependency to benefit from tolerogenic environment of the liver. clinical studies identified the presence of putative resistance variants in connection with miR-122 antagonist therapy. in vitro studies supported the resistance associated phenotype. the aGO-CLIP method allows identification of miRNA interaction sites on target RNA and represents a critical step towards a more comprehensive understanding of miRNA regulation. the let-7 and miR-17 binding sites are highly conserved across all sequenced pestiviruses supporting a conserved function within this genus. other pestiviruses of the AGO-CLIP based screen displayed more pervasive AGO/miRNA binding with several peaks across the viral genome. herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) downregulates miR-27 by expressing HVS U-rich RNAs. these ncRNAs can bind miR-27 to destabilize it by not fully understood mechanisms. infection with human and murine cytomegalovirus (CMV) leads to destabilization of specific miRNAs of miR-17 and miR-27 families. BVDV genomes harboring a miR-17 binding site were able to efficiently de-repress miR-17 mRNAs in cell culture. pestiviruses failed to functionally sequester this highly abundant miRNA, suggesting that the relative abundance of a miRNA determines any de-repression. RNA viruses also employ mechanisms of direct RNA binding to regulate the functional abundance of specific cellular miRNAs. retroviridae family is a large group of RNA viruses able to stably integrate a pro-viral form of their genome into the host genome. RT enzyme uses specific host tRNAs as primer; the 3\u2032 end of the host tRNA is engaged in sequence specific interaction with the complementary primer binding site (PBS) on the viral genome. cis-genomic elements in a sequence specific fashion to liberate complementary sequences of the PBS and tRNA for intermolecular interaction. this may explain why different retrovirus genera encoding specific NC proteins use different tRNAs. no functional experiments were done except on the interaction with miR-21. miR-132, a repressor of the histone acetyltransferase complex p300/CBP, is known to decrease the expression of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) higher permissiveness of cortical neurons compared to granule cell neurons positively correlated with higher miR-132 expression, thus potentially increasing permissiveness in specific brain areas for positive-stranded RNA viruses. EV71 infection upregulates the miR-208b/499a cluster. miR-146a then binds and represses its mRNA targets, IRAK1 and TRAF6. these miRNAs target the 3\u2032 UTR of IFNL3 mRNAs, counteracting the activation of the IFN-III response. high levels of miR-146a are responsible for post-transcriptional repression of IRAK1 and TRAF6 involved in the toll-like receptor signaling and type I IFN production. miR-146a knockout mice survived EV71 infection longer than wild type mice. repression of miR-146a levels in wild type mice increased expression of type I IFN and ISGs upon infection. infection with IAV recapitulated this signature, suggesting a general mechanism of lncRNA expression involved in the regulation of the antiviral response. the first functional evidence for a lncRNA in the antiviral response was the identification of NeST [131] this lncRNA is conserved and expressed from the same locus but on the opposite strand to the IL22 and IFNG genes. lncRNA #32 repression increased susceptibility to infection with the (+)ssRNA encephalomyocarditis virus and impaired IFN responses against HBV and HCV in primary cells. suppression of lncRNA #32 by IFN- in a feed-back loop may protect the cell from excess inflammation caused by high ISG expression. expression is induced upon infection with several RNA and DNA viruses. the splicing factor proline- and glutamine-rich protein (SFPQ) inhibits gene expression at the transcriptional level in presence of the non-POU domain-containing, octamer binding protein (NONO) the authors proposed a model in which allosteric conformational change induced by the interaction of the lncRNA would enhance GOT2 activity. this would reshape the cellular metabolic environment and mobilize energy that the virus can exploit for replication and particle production. many more such cases of miRNAs and lncRNAs may await discovery. single nucleotide polymorphisms in the region encoding IFN lambda 3 (IFNL3) and 4 (IFNL4) are associated to acute or chronic outcome of HCV infection. miR-208b and miR-499a target only specific variants of the IFNL3 3\u2032 UTR thereby contributing to decay of the IFNL3 genotype associated with chronicity. lncRNA ACOD1 accumulates in the cytoplasm upon SeV and VSV infection. binds the GOT2 protein to re-shape the metabolic landscape of the cell. lncRNA NeST binds the histone methyl transferase WRD5 leading to histone methylation and expression of the IFNG gene. lncRNAs can modulate metabolism and gene expression by coordinating architecture of nuclear domains. expression of specific lncRNAs, such as XIST or FENDRR, is essential for embryonic development and organ homeostasis [127,128,129]. a histone methyl transferase interacts with NeST to alter histone methylation of the IFNG promoter, thereby stimulating its expression. despite many lncRNAs epigenetically regulating neighboring genes, NeST apparently works in trans also when expressed from distant genomic loci. lncRNA #32 repression increased susceptibility to infection with the (+)ssRNA encephalomyocarditis virus. impaired IFN responses against HBV and HCV in primary cells. suppression of lncRNA #32 by IFN- in a feed-back loop may protect the cell from excess inflammation caused by high ISG expression. lncRNA-ACOD1 is induced by multiple viruses, including the (-)ssRNA Sendai virus (SeV) and VSV in multiple tissues. lncRNA-ACOD1 repression in cultured cells and deletion in lncRNA-ACOD1 knockout mice is sufficient to dramatically reduce viral replication independent of IFN responses. RNA Virus Encoded Non-Coding RNA In addition to viral exploitation of cellular RNA, virus derived ncRNA play important functions. for large DNA viruses, expression of several classes, including miRNAs and lncRNAs, is wellcharacterized. miRNA hairpins would have their genome cleaved directly during miRNA processing, whereas their anti-genome would be a cleavage target for RNA interference (RNAi) this would presumably result in significant attenuation of viral replication. however, these constraints could still be compatible with viral replication. miR-S6-3p mimics the seed sequence of miR-29, a miRNA known to be over-expressed in a variety of lymphoproliferative disorders. miRNA expression may sustain proliferation of the infected cells and play a role in BLV associated tumorigenesis. lack of evolutionary conservation and biological role question their functional relevance. mammalian cells still conserved the RNAi pathway including components, such as Dicer and AGO2 proteins, capable of mediating viral RNA cleavage. despite this, a parallel study did observe evidence of active RNAi in BHK cells. NS1 deletion mutant was highly attenuated in AGO2 expressing cells. EV71 3A counteracts the sensing of foreign RNA by Dicer. this allows the accumulation of viral dsRNA replication intermediates in the cytoplasm and therefore promotes viral replication. it is conceivable that mammalian specific viruses may have a need to employ VSR-like mechanisms. sfRNAs are produced through incomplete degradation of the viral genome once engaged by the XRN1 exonuclease. the XRN1 exonuclease is stalled on xrRNAs containing single (or multiple) pseudoknot-stabilized tertiary structures. the number of different sfRNAs produced differ between flaviviruses. sub-genomic flavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs) impair cellular response to viral infection. a pseudoknot-stabilized helix is formed in the 3\u2032 UTR of flaviviral genomes. this blocks the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 processing and nucleolytic activity of the exonuclease XRN1 which triggers accumulation of sfRNAs in the cell. in mammalian somatic cells, sfRNAs have been shown to globally inhibit inflammatory gene expression and dampen the cellular type I IFN response interfering with activation of pattern recognition receptors. sfRNAs were described to impair the innate immune response by direct targeting of cytoplasmic PRRs. sfRNA production is critical to sustain infection in animals with intact interferon response. lncRNAs are well described for large DNA viruses like the PAN RNA expressed by Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lncRNA expression from the LTR anti-sense to viral gene expression was described [176]. reliance on miRNA inhibitors only makes interpretation difficult. RNA viruses containing miRNA hairpins would have their genome cleaved directly during miRNA processing, whereas their anti-genome would be a cleavage target for RNA interference (RNAi) this would presumably result in significant attenuation of viral replication. however, these constraints could still be compatible with viral replication. miR-S4-3p mimics miR-132, a miRNA known to be over-expressed in a variety of lymphoproliferative disorders. miR-S6-3p mimics miR-132, thereby helping the virus escape innate immunity. antiviral RNAi mechanisms were extensively dissected in plants and invertebrates. however, whether a similar antiviral siRNA signature is observed and functional in infected mammalian cells has been debated. a parallel study did observe evidence of active RNAi in BHK cells. IAV NS1 inhibits viral derived siRNA accumulation in human cells. an IAV NS1 deletion mutant was highly attenuated in AGO2 expressing cells. a recent screen for viral proteins with VSR activity further identified the ability of the EV71 3A protein to impair Dicer-dependent siRNA production in human and murine cells. the capped genome is organized with 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs flanking a single open reading frame. mutations in highly structured regions of the viral 3\u2032 UTR significantly compromise the replication of flaviviruses. sfRNA is of great importance to flaviviruses, as viruses specifically defective for its production display a highly attenuated phenotype. the number of different sfRNAs produced differ between flaviviruses. mutations that stabilize such pseudoknots may trigger an increase in sfRNA accumulation. sfRNAs impair cellular response to viral infection. sfRNAs in mosquito Culex pipiens accumulate in midgut cells and display RNAi suppressor activity by counteracting Dicer. this process modulates transmission of the virus to the salivary glands and thus its transmission to the next host. sfRNAs have been shown to globally inhibit inflammatory gene expression and dampen the cellular type I IFN response. TRIM25 is central in promoting ubiquitination of RIG-I. the sfRNA inhibition of TRIM25 impairs the ubiquitination of RIG-I. this study further linked the high accumulation of sfRNA of particular DENV-2 strains to their epidemic potential. the role of cellular and viral-derived small RNA is further along compared to lncRNAs and other RNA species. a broader investigation of the RNA virosphere will reveal exciting discoveries in this emerging field."}
