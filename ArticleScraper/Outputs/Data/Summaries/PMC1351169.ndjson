{"summary": "the attributable fraction of cancer by charred fish and meat (21%) and alcohol drinking (22%) were considered low compared with other risk factor candidates. the attributable fraction of cancer speculated to be genetically determined was 32%, while 36% of cancer was considered preventable by improving lifestyle. the study was conducted as a part of an omnibus survey in December 2003. a total of 2,000 people aged 20 or older were randomly selected as study subjects. other studies focusing on specific cancers only have appeared [11-14]. interviews were successfully obtained from 1,355 (67.8%) among the 2,000 people selected for survey (977 men, 1,023 women), interviews were successfully obtained from 1,355 (67.8%) the remaining 645 did not respond because of change of address after sampling (n = 29), absence from home in the survey period (n = 295) and refusal to participate (n = 303) the second question asked about the fraction of cancer genetically predetermined using the same categories as the first. the third question asked about the preventable fraction of cancer by modification of lifestyle using estimation of an actual percent value. subjects also asked about their smoking and drinking practices, and occupational and educational status. 222 68.3 Chugoku, Shikoku and Kyushu 418 278 66.5 City scale 14 metropolises* 458 325 71.0 Other cities 1122 736 65.6 Towns and villages 420 294 70.0 the attributable fraction of cancer causes was considered highest for cancer-causing viral and bacterial infection (51.3%), followed by tobacco smoking (43.0%), stress (39.0%), and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (37.1%). the attributable fraction of other risk factor candidates such as occupational exposure, air pollution, food additives and pesticides were considered low compared with other risk factor candidates. in women, the former subjects considered the values lower than the latter. awareness of attributable fraction of cancer causes among the general population total men women Mean % (95%CI) Mean % (95%CI) Mean % (95%CI) Preventable fraction of cancer (%) by eliminating: Cancer-causing viral and bacterial infection 51.3 (49.5- 53.0) 48.7 (46.1- 51.3) 53.4 (51.1- 55.6) Tobacco smoking 43.0 (41.6- 44.4) 40.1 (3 attributable fraction of cancer among Japanese tended to be higher for cancer-causing infection, occupational exposure, air pollution and food additives than major lifestyle factors such as dietary factors. an average 35.5% of cancer were considered preventable by lifestyle improvement, with this ratio higher in homemakers, former smokers, and never and former drinkers. respondents estimate for attributable fractions were generally high. this may be due to anchoring and adjustment effects of the response categories used. this may be due to the tendency of people to respond near the middle of the scale. study subjects recruited from a nationally representative random sample. the results of the present survey provide valuable clues toward the formulation of relevant cancer prevention strategies in Japan. the author(s) declare that they have no competing interests."}
