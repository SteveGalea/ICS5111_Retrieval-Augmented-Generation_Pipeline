{"summary": "the international health regulations (2005) and the emergence and global spread of infectious diseases have triggered a re-assessment of how rich countries should support capacity development for communicable disease control in low and medium income countries. the first model has low rates of production and teaching may not always be based on the needs and priorities of the host country. the third model has the most potential as a capacity development measure for LMIC, but in practice faces challenges which may limit its ability to promote capacity development. the international health regulations 2005 (IHR) revise the 1969 IHR by broadening the range of, and creating a legal framework for, reportable 'public health events of international concern' low and middle income countries often have a porous patchwork of surveillance systems and inadequate resources to develop and implement effective early warning and response systems. based epidemiology training programs became a popular model of education through the 1990s and early part of this century [7,8,17-19]. over 40 countries now have field-based training programs. training should be integrated with the following parallel capacity development initiatives [21,22] in this paper, we explore how a university-based training program partners and complements health department initiatives to improve public health capacity. we argue that the tendency to reify \"training\" as distinct from other capacity development initiatives may be part of the reason FETPs in LMIC have difficulty bringing about transformative change in public health. streamed training model aims to train public health workers in specific areas of public health practice. model is usually taken up by junior health workers who are provided with limited set of public health competencies. but this model can quickly, efficiently and cost effectively meet emergent issues at the grass roots \u2013 until higher level public health specialists come on site. eller funded Public Health Schools Without Walls (PHSWOW) is a form of FETP offering an MPH qualification from a partner university. it aims to produce generalist public health physicians rather than communicable disease specialists. over 3 billion people in Asia live in areas potentially covered by an FETP student, compared to 45 million in 1980. two placements are reserved for Indigenous scholars each year. previous scholars have been based at Aboriginal Health Services or in the Office of Aboriginal Health in Perth. the MAE Program is restricted to Australian residents. students work across different levels within the health system, with research institutes, and across the non-health sector. they have led or participated in over 200 outbreak responses locally, nationally or internationally. they have led or participated in over 200 outbreak responses. the master of Applied Epidemiology is an effective model for improving public health capacity in rich countries. the master of Applied Epidemiology is an effective model for improving public health capacity in rich countries. MMWR produced a supplement containing 10 papers from a recent scientific conference of TEPHINET. nine of the papers were written by FETP graduates from LMIC, representing a professional constituency infrequently published in academic literature. seven of the papers included an external consultant as co-author. the student needs a suite of skills that does not belong to the strict corpus of communicable disease epidemiology. if the student has been encouraged through their training to adopt an attitude of resignation to communicable disease outbreaks \u2013 documenting rather than responding \u2013 both the country and the donor agencies may well feel their investment in FETPs has been wasted. communicable disease control is a flagpole endeavour for global health. avian influenza, avian influenza, and pandemic influenza have all demonstrated the need for countries to work together. in a globalised world, these contributions need to be scaled up. 'capacity development' can be defined as the deliberate effort to strengthen the ability of the health system to produce desirable outcomes. 'capacity development' can be defined as the deliberate effort to strengthen the ability of the health system to produce desirable outcomes. streamed training model aims to train public health workers in specific areas of public health practice, such as tuberculosis or diarrhoeal and vaccine-preventable diseases. streamed training model has been used by UNICEF, WHO and other international aid agencies [24,29] the first CDC-based FETP in a developing country was set up in Thailand in 1980 [8,17]. PHSWOW is a form of FETP offering an MPH qualification from a partner university. it aims to produce generalist public health physicians rather than communicable disease specialists. over 3 billion people in Asia live in areas potentially covered by an FETP student. two placements are reserved for Indigenous scholars each year. previous scholars have been based at Aboriginal Health Services or in the Office of Aboriginal Health in Perth. the program is restricted to Australian residents. the directors have a vested interest in identifying and implementing solutions. students work across different levels within the health system, with research institutes, and across the non-health sector. examples of studies conducted across sectors include studies with local/national food authorities. since 1991, the MAE Program has produced 139 graduates. they have led or participated in over 200 outbreak responses locally, nationally or internationally. most graduates now work in public health positions in Australia, Asia and the Pacific. nine of the 10 papers were written by FETP graduates from a professional constituency infrequently published in academic literature. seven of the papers included an external consultant as co-author. the two that did not have an external consultant as co-author had local academic staff. a student needs a suite of skills that does not belong to the strict corpus of communicable disease epidemiology. if the student has been encouraged through their training to adopt an attitude of resignation to communicable disease outbreaks, both the country and the donor agencies may well feel that their investment in FETPs has been wasted. FETPs must complement regional capacity development activities to help control trans-boundary spread of disease. communicable disease control is a flagpole endeavour for global health. the principles are translatable to non-communicable diseases and environmental health. a key driver that will need to be considered in LMIC is the coordination of training activities with capacity development initiatives. the challenge for LMIC now is to navigate through poorly coordinated capacity development activities across different government sectors and departments. education can be a driver for transformative change in health service function. supporting a milieu that will enable FETP students and the host country's health system to make the most of their training is the next challenge in capacity building. the system provided the infrastructure to link, analyse and disseminate health data at an operational level within health clinics. the system provided the infrastructure to link, analyse and disseminate health data at an operational level within health clinics. a systematic literature review on remediation programs for managing elevated blood lead levels in the vicinity of functioning smelters. establishing regular meetings and e-contact between field epidemiology training program students to develop an internal peer network in which they will be encouraged to focus on outcomes of outbreak investigations or surveillance activities. building collaborations Support collaborative endeavours by: \u2022 Establishing a number of clerkships for field epidemiology training program students or graduates in Australian institutions. the MAE Program at the Australian National University is funded by the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing. the MAE Program at the Australian national university is funded by the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing."}
