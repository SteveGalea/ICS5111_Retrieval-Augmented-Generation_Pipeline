{"summary": "the newly emergent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) poses a severe threat to public health worldwide. the virus can cause a series of respiratory manifestations, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (1, 2). these clinical symptoms are accompanied by a high risk of renal failure, leading to a very high mortality rate. the complex structure of the receptor binding domain in MERS-CoV S1 bound to CD26 has been solved by our group (10), illustrating the molecular basis of receptor recognition by this novel virus. fusion occurs, and this is expected to involve rearrangement of the characteristic elements called heptad repeats (HRs) in S2 to form a stable 6-helix bundle fusion core (5). crystallographically described for both murine hepatitis virus (MHV) (15) and SARS-CoV (13) at least three conformational states are proposed for all class I virus envelope proteins. the formation of a 6-helix bundle would bring the cellular and viral lipid bilayers into proximity, allowing membrane fusion (16). however, the observed fusion core structure likely represents the postfusion state. two constructs with variably truncated HR1 and HR2 sequences were made. one involves MERS-CoV spike residues E992 to L1040 for HR1 and I1246 to L1286 for HR2. the other involves amino acids E992 to I1054 for HR1 and L1252 to L1286 for HR2. a single colony was inoculated into 50 ml of LB medium containing 100 g/ml of ampicillin. overnight culture was transferred to 2 liters of fresh LB medium. protein overexpression was induced with 0.2 mM isopropyl--d-thiogalactoside. crystals of good diffracting quality were obtained after 14 days using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. the crystal was picked up using a nylon loop and immersed in a cryoprotectant solution containing 67% reservoir solution and 16% glycerol for 30 s. the crystal was then remounted and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. MERS pseudovirus was prepared by cotransfecting 293T cells with a plasmid encoding an Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 genome (pNL4-3.luc.RE) and the pCAGGS-MERS-S expression plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) peptides were synthesized by chinaPeptides Co., Ltd., with a purity of >95%. each peptide was dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 100 mM. one peptide (denoted P1; LTQINTTLLDLTYEMLSLQQVVKALNESYIDLKELGN) covers the full length of the HR2 sequence. incubation, the medium was replaced, and the sample was incubated for an additional 48 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were then collected, lysed, and measured for luciferase activity using a GloMax 96 microplate luminometer (Promega) the atomic coordinates and the related structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession code of 4MOD. construct used for pseudovirus production was cloned by inserting the full-length coding sequence of MERS-CoV spike into the pCAGGS vector to yield a recombinant plasmid named pCAGGS-MERS-S. for protein expression, expression vectors were transformed into BL21(DE3) competent cells. the protein fractions were collected and analyzed on a 15% tricine SDS-PAGE gel. the molecular weights were estimated by comparison with protein standards run on the same column. crystals of good diffracting quality were obtained after 14 days using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. crystallographic data collection and refinement statistics for MERS-CoV fusion core Parameter Valuea Data collection statistics Space group P3 Cell dimensions a, b, c () 42.82, 42.82, 75.57, (\u00b0) 90, 90, 120 Resolution () 50\u20131.90 (1.97\u20131.90) Rmerge 0.074 (0.156) I/I 18.4 (11.7) Completeness (%) 99.3 (100.0) Redundancy 4.5 (4.9) Refine peptides were synthesized by chinaPeptides Co., Ltd., with a purity of >95%. each peptide was dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 100 mM. the equivalent peptide in SARS-CoV exhibits a much higher inhibitory efficacy than the HR2 peptides of longer length (29). each concentration was incubated for an additional 48 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were then collected, lysed, and measured for luciferase activity. the proteins exhibit characteristic sequence features with normally hydrophobic residues at the \u201ca\u201d and \u201cd\u201d positions. multiple studies have been performed to characterize the fusion core structure of SARS-CoV. one of these with truncations from E900 to L948 for HR1 and I1145 to L1185 for HR2 was successful (13). the corresponding HR regions in MERS-CoV S2 are E992 to L1040 and L1252 to L1286, respectively. fusion core was prepared as a single chain by linking HR1 and HR2 with a 22-residue linker. resultant HR1/HR2 complexes are denoted HR complex 1 and HR complex 2 respectively. both proteins were eluted at approximately 15.5 ml on a calibrated Superdex 200 10/300 column. gel filtration chromatograph of HR complex 1. (B) CD spectrum of HR complex 2. (D) CD spectrum of HR complex 2. Structure of the MERS-CoV fusion core. both proteins were subjected to intensified crystal screening trials. these terminal residues are labeled, with the dashed line indicating the flexible linker connecting HR1 and HR2. each chain in the crystallographic asymmetric unit could yield a trimeric structure of a typical coiled-coil fold. the MHV fusion core is longer than that of MERS-CoV by about two helix turns. the hydrophobic residues at positions \u201ca\u201d and \u201cd\u201d in HR1 are aligned on one side of the helix, forming an interface of strong hydrophobicity. the groove-forming HR1 helices (green) and the groove-binding HR2 unit (magenta) are shown in the middle. the major HR2 residues engaging HR1 are presented as sticks and labeled on the right side. in vitro inhibition of MERS-CoV infection by an HR2-based peptide. peptides normally display a higher inhibitory efficacy than those derived from HR1 (14, 16) the HR regions exhibit characteristic sequence features with normally hydrophobic residues at the \u201ca\u201d and \u201cd\u201d positions. both regions are located downstream of a predicted S1/S2 cleavage site between R751 and S752. both regions are located downstream of a predicted S1/S2 cleavage site between R751 and S752. LVPRGSGGSGGSGGLEVLFQGP has been shown to work successfully with the HR domains of SARS-CoV. the vertical arrow indicates a potential cleavage site between S1 and S2 based on a ProP-1.0 prediction result. double minima at 208 and 222 nm were observed for both HR complexes 1 and 2. recombinant proteins, HR complexes 1 and 2, were expressed in E. coli cells and analyzed by analytical gel filtration and CD. the same structure yielded a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of only 0.048 for all C pairs. HR1 folds into a 12-turn -helix, whereas HR2 adopts a much more extended conformation for the first half and a canonical -helical structure for the second half. three HR1 helices aligned in parallel to each other to form the central coiled-coil core. this leads to a 6-helix bundle of approximately 13 in semidiameter and approximately 68 in height. the fusion core structure of MERS-CoV is very similar to those reported for other coronaviruses. a majority of these contacting amino acids are in the middle portion of the helical structure, while the remaining residues clinch the coil at both ends. no polar contacts, such as H bonds or salt bridges, are observed in this coiled-coil formation. HR2 binds to the side grooves of the center core and simultaneously contacts two HR1 chains. along the groove, HR2 folds into an extended loop and then proceeds to form an -helix of about five turns. much more extensive interactions than those for HR1 assembly are observed. inhibitory effect was observed for peptide P1 but not for peptide P2 or the SARS peptide, even at the highest concentration (100 M), indicating the inhibitory specificity of P1. The 50% effective dose (EC50) for inhibition of MERS-CoV infection by P1 was calculated to be 3.013 M (95% confidence interval, 1.815 to 5.001 M). MHV and SARS-CoV are classified into subgroups 2a and 2b respectively. the formation of 6-helix bundles by MERS-CoV HR1 and HR2 seems to follow the rule for other class I fusion proteins. inhibitory peptides targeting the membrane fusion architecture represent a very promising category, which has proven effective for many viruses, such as HIV and SARS-CoV. an HR-based peptide-inhibitor T20 (enfuvirtide) is used for the clinical treatment of HIV patients (36)."}
