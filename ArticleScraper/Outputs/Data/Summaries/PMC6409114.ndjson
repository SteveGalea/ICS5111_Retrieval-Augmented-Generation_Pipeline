{"summary": "'nipah' is an enveloped paramyxovirus with negative-stranded polarity. it has reticular cytoplasmic inclusions close to the endoplasmic reticulum unlike other paramyxoviruses. NiV is on average larger than typical paramyxoviruses. the two strains are approximately 92% identical on sequencing but appear to be significantly different in their pathogenicity and transmissibility (4-7). the first outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia- Singapore (1998-1999) was initially thought to be Japanese encephalitis (JE), but on further investigation, it was later identified as Nipah virus (Figure 1) (3,8,9). no human to human transmission was reported (8,12,13) a significant association of NiV disease and consumption of date palm sap contaminated by fruit bats was found. in date palm sap the virus remains stable for at least 7 days at 22\u00b0C. mounts et al, 2001 (13) No human to human and nosocomial transmission for the Malaysian strain of NiV causing Malaysia-Singapore outbreaks. ARDS in Bangladesh strain of NiV can substantially reduce mor tal i ty (36%) without any significant adverse reactions. asymptomatic infection was reported in 8% of patients with laboratory-confirmed cases in Malaysia. no such data of asymptomatic infection is available from Bangladesh and Indian outbreaks. 15 percent of patients (14 patients) had residual deficits out of which five remained in a vegetative state (19). ARDS (50% to 66% cases) was documented in Malaysian outbreak. virus isolation and reverse transcriptase chain reaction assay (RT PCR) from throat and nasal swabs, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), urine, and blood is recommended (24). advanced diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW) of the brain can give useful radiological evidence of Nipah encephalitis. differentials should be considered in patients with suspected Nipah infection. a) Japanese encephalitis (JE), b) Measles, c) Rabies, d) Dengue encephalitis and i) Bacterial meningitis. CSF pleocytosis with neutrophilic predominance and raised proteins with low sugar Diagnosis by blood and CSF culture and latex agglutination or nucleic acid amplification in CSF 7) Japanese encephalitis Pigs are healthy Low secondary attack rates Children are affected more than adults Basal ganglia involvement on imaging 8) Measles More in children Cough, coryza, conjunctivitis Maculopapular rash on face a total of 140 patients treated with ribavirin were retrospectively compared with 52 control NiV patients who did not receive ribavirin due to unavailability. the study showed 45 deaths in the treated group (32%) and 29 in the controls (54%), with a total of 36% reduction in mortality. ribavirin has been found to be teratogenic in animal studies on rodents and rabbits, but no human teratogenic studies are available. the minimum interval following treatment with ribavirin before pregnancy can be safely initiated is estimated to be 7 months (36). a strong case can be made favoring short course high dose ribavirin for therapy. viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor favipiravir was developed by toyama Chemical Company as an antiviral for use against influenza. ribavirin treatment only delayed but did not prevent death after Nipah or Hendra virus infection (31,32) only one in-vivo human study has evaluated the role of ribavirin during the Malaysia outbreak of NiV between 1998 and 1999. ribavirin was found to cross the blood-brain barrier following oral administration with a mean CSF/plasma ratio of 0.7 (35). the serious adverse drug reactions with ribavirin are: Neutropenia (8% to 40%; children & adolescents: 11%), lymphocytopenia (12% to 14%) and suicidal ideations (36). m102.4 is a potent cross-reactive neutralizing antibody in vitro. it was effective in protecting ferrets from lethal NiV challenge (38) m102.4 was offered as a trial on compassionate grounds to a mother and daughter who were exposed to the virus from their infected horse. standard precautions, hand hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE) remain as pillars of comprehensive infection prevention and control strategy. all hospitals should adhere to standard infection control precautions for all patient-care activities and aerosol-generating procedures. droplet, contact and airborne precautions should be applied. the role of drugs like ribavirin has to be clearly established. effective control measures in the community to prevent its transmission from animals (bats/pigs) to humans in disease prone areas must be instituted."}
