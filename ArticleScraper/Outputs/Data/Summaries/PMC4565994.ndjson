{"summary": "METHODS Patients This prospective study was performed in allogeneic HCT recipients undergoing transplant between December 2005 and February 2010. weekly virologic surveillance before and up to 100 days posttransplant was conducted. NWs were collected using 5 mL of saline per nostril for adults. all clinical and research respiratory samples collected between 60 days and 1 day pre-HCT were analyzed. results from pre-HCT lower respiratory tract samples were also included. results were compared for patients across 3 groups (group 1 viruses, group 2 viruses, and negative) outcomes were evaluated comparing patients with any respiratory virus to those without respiratory viruses among symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (groups shown in Figure 1). b specimens were collected from participants at least once before and weekly after HCT. a research specimen was generally collected within 14 days before the scheduled HCT regardless of respiratory symptoms. a research sample was designated as asymptomatic surveillance. study Outcomes We examined 3 primary outcomes: (1) need for bronchoscopy, as a potential marker for underlying pneumonia because bronchoscopy is performed routinely on all patients suspected of lower respiratory tract disease; (2) number of days alive and out of hospital, as a marker for resource utilization; (3) overall mortality. RESULTS Respiratory samples were collected from 458 patients between day 60 and day 1 prior to allogeneic HCT between December 2005 and February 2010. at least 1 pretransplant NW was collected from 451 (98%) patients. piratory Virus Detected (n = 458) Characteristic Without Pre-HCT Virus (n = 116) Age, y (range) 51 (1\u201375) 44 (1\u201375).002 Age, y 5 6 (2) 12 (10) 5\u201317 22 (6) 12 (10) 18\u201375 314 (92) 92 (79) Male sex 213 (62) 73 (63). twenty-four of 52 (46%) pediatric patients aged 18 years had respiratory viruses detected compared with 92 of 406 (23%) patients aged >18 years. only 3 (7%) of 45 group 1 viruses (1 RSV, 2 PIV) were detected by asymptomatic surveillance, compared with 23 (32%) group 2 viruses.

Developed worsening hypoxia and pulmonary infiltrates and died on day 32 from influenza pneumonia. research sample collected when the patient was asymptomatic was positive for influenza A when tested later per protocol. group 1 includes respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, influenza A and B, and adenovirus (P =.03); group 2 includes human rhinovirus, human coronavirus, and human bocavirus (P =.007) overall mortality patients with pretransplant respiratory viruses had higher overall mortality at day 100 compared with patients without pretransplant viruses. ninety of 150 (60%) symptomatic patients had respiratory viruses detected pre-HCT compared with 26 of 308 (8%) asymptomatic patients. incidence of bronchoscopy in 150 symptomatic patients was not significantly higher among those with respiratory viruses than those without. infected patients had significantly fewer days alive and out of hospital compared with uninfected patients. mortality appeared to occur mainly in symptomatic infected patients. patients with symptoms and any respiratory virus detected had no significant difference in bronchoscopy incidence or hospitalization days compared with uninfected patients. this suggests symptomatic patients with any pretransplant respiratory virus are at higher risk for adverse clinical outcomes than asymptomatic infected patients. our data strengthen current clinical practice guidelines advising that symptomatic patients should be tested and transplant delayed, when feasible. even pretransplant rhinovirus infection is associated with poor outcomes and delay of transplant, or possibly milder conditioning regimens should be considered."}
