{"summary": "ADP-ribosylation is the post-translational covalent addition of a single (mono-ADP-ribosylation or MARylation) subunits of ADP-ribose from NAD+ to a protein. this process is catalyzed by intracellular poly(ADP-ribosyltransferases) and extracellular cholera toxin-like ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTD PARP14 binds to STAT-6 and enhances IL-4-dependent gene expression in macrophages [15], and an unknown ADP-ribosylating enzyme inhibits RNAi following stress responses or poly(I:C) treatment. several PARPs are known ISGs (interferon stimulated genes), and many PARPs have been shown to be antiviral. PARP9 has been shown to complex with the DTX3L ubiquitin ligase to ubiquitinate the host histone H2BJ to enhance IFN signaling. this complex also targets the EMCV 3C protease for ubiquitination and degradation. coronaviruses are enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses that cause severe disease in several mammalian species. some, such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, cause severe disease in several mammalian species. others, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and MERS, cause lethal human diseases. alanine mutation of a highly conserved asparagine residue is present in all enzymatically active macrodomains. this asparagine residue is present in all enzymatically active macrodomains. the location of this residue within the protein is highly conserved among CoV macrodomains. we purified CD11b+ cells from the brains of mice infected with wild-type (WT) or N1347A MHV containing eGFP in place of ORF4 [50] from the brains of mice infected with wild-type (WT) or wild-type (WT) or N1347A MHV BAC clone. we also analyzed whether PARP expression changed after infection. BMDMs infected with WT and N1347A virus at low multiplicity of infection (MOI) at 20 hours post infection, BMDMs had >10-fold lower titers and gRNA levels than those infected with WT virus. total viral protein levels were noticeably decreased in infected cells when measured by immunoblotting for nucleocapsid (N) protein. BMDMs were infected as described above, and at 12 hpi, supernatants were collected and analyzed for IFN and IFN protein levels. the data in (A-E) are obtained from one experiment representative of two independent experiments; n = 3 biological replicates. previously, we observed a diminished innate immune response in the brains of mice infected with N1347A virus [50], likely reflecting diminished virus replication. loss of MAVS or IFNAR greatly reduced IFN mRNA levels compared to those in WT cells. however, the replication deficiency of N1347A virus in WT BMDMs was retained in MAVS-/- cells. FNAR-/- mice were mock infected or infected with WT or N1347A MHV. RNA levels were determined by RT-qPCR with primers specific to IFN (A) or genomic RNA (B), viral titers were determined by plaque assay (C), and viral protein expression was assessed by fluorescence microscopy (D). PARP13 primers were designed to detect all isoforms of PARP13. expression of these upregulated PARPs was also increased in infected MAVS-/- cells. expression of PARPs 9\u201312 and 14 were not increased in infected IFNAR-/- cells. BMDMs from WT or IFNAR-/- mice were mock treated or treated with 1000 U IFN for 8 h. RNA levels of selected PARPs were determined by RT-qPCR. PARP activity restricts N1347A MHV replication. PARP catalyzed ADP-ribosylation is responsible for decreased replication and increased IFN production during N1347A MHV infection. BMDMs were infected with WT or N1347A MHV and treated with vehicle (0.25% DMSO), 5 mM 3-AB, or 10 M XAV-939. two independent siRNAs directed toward PARP12 and PARP14 significantly rescued N1347A virus gRNA levels without having a significant effect on WT virus. in contrast, two independent siRNAs directed toward PARP12 and PARP14 significantly rescued N1347A virus gRNA levels. BMDMs were transfected with control siRNA (siCtl) or PARP-specific siRNA. Approximately 28 hours later, cells were infected with WT or N1347A MHV. the data in (A) represent the combined results of two to five experiments. siPARP/siCtl or inhibitor/DMSO-treated cells infected with N1347A virus. PARP14 inhibitor 8K caused reduction in IFN mRNA levels in both WT and N1347A virus-infected BMDMs. overexpression of PARP14, but not of GFP, was sufficient for IFN induction in delayed brain tumor (DBT) cells. mRNA levels were determined by RT-qPCR. the data in (A) represent the combined results of three experiments. cells were collected at 12 hpi, and IFN mRNA levels were determined by RT-qPCR. cell conditioned media used to pretreat WT or IFNAR KO A549 cells. numbers above bars represent fold difference between WT and N1347A or between siPARP/siCtl or inhibitor/DMSO-treated cells infected with N1347A virus. cells showed only partial antiviral activity, resulting in 3-fold enhanced replication of VSV M51R compared to cells that received conditioned media from stimulated WT cells. the addition of exogenous IFN to IFNAR KO A549 cells had no effect on VSV M51R replication in these cells. the location of the macrodomain within nsp3 of MHV and the specific location of this mutation have been previously reported. this asparagine residue is present in all enzymatically active macrodomains. the location of this residue within the protein is highly conserved among CoV macrodomains. the macrodomain is predicted to counter PARP-mediated ADP-ribosylation. several PARPs were highly upregulated in these cells following infection with either WT or N1347A virus. no cell culture system exists in which a CoV macrodomain-mutant virus has a robust growth defect. BMDMs were infected with WT or N1347A MHV and analyzed for virus replication. A,B Virus titers (A) and genomic RNA (gRNA) levels (B) were determined by plaque assay and RT-qPCR. both CXCL-10 and IFN transcript levels and secreted levels of IFN and IFN protein were significantly increased at 12 hpi in BMDMs infected with N1347A virus compared to levels in WT virus-infected samples. the coV macrodomain inhibits the innate immune response in infected BMDMs. 60% of IFNAR-/- mice infected with N1347A virus succumbed to the infection and exhibited weight loss similar to that induced by WT virus. we pretreated BMDMs with different doses of IFN for 8 hours and then infected cells with WT or N1347A virus. several PARPs are highly expressed during infection and in response to IFN stimulation in BMDMs. lack of upregulation of these proteins in IFNAR-/- cells or mice could explain restoration of N1347A MHV-specific phenotypes. BMDMs were infected with WT or N1347A MHV and collected at 18 hpi. RNA levels of selected PARPs were determined by RT-qPCR. PARP activity restricts N1347A MHV replication. 3-AB is a general PARP inhibitor, while XAV-939 was developed as a PARP5a/b inhibitor. at higher concentrations it inhibits most, if not all, PARPs [66]. both inhibitors significantly increased N1347A virus replication compared to vehicle treatment. the data in (A-D) show one experiment representative of two independent experiments. DMSO, n = 6; 3-AB and XAV-939, n = 3. we transfected BMDMs with siRNAs for the most highly expressed PARPs. a recently developed PARP14 inhibitor, compound 8K, targets the MARylating catalytic site of PARP14. compound 8K did not affect cell viability or metabolism or inhibit global cellular PARylation. this significantly restored replication of N1347A MHV in BMDMs. the results in (B) show one experiment representative of two independent experiments. PARP14-/- or PARP14+/- littermate control BMDMs were infected with WT or N1347A virus. cells were collected at 15 hpi, and gRNA levels were determined by RT-qPCR. PARP14 mutant with inactivating mutations H1698F, Y1730N, and E1810K also induced IFN expression in DBT cells following transfection. results suggest that PARP14 has both ADP-ribosylation-dependent and -independent mechanisms for regulating the IFN response. transduced control A549 cells were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting for PARP14 protein. at 16 hpi, VSV replication on WT or IFNAR KO A549 cells was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (F), and titers were determined by plaque assay on Vero cells (G). x-axis labels represent VSV-infected cells. conditioned media from stimulated PARP14 KO A549 or PARP14 KO NHDF cells showed only partial antiviral activity, resulting in 3-fold enhanced replication of VSV M51R. conditioned media from both WT and PARP14 KO cells treated with poly(I:C) still had a mild inhibitory effect on VSV M51R replication in IFNAR KO cells. a smaller difference in VSV replication between WT and PARP14 conditioned media-treated cells was observed in IFNAR KO recipient cells compared to WT recipient cells. the primary antiviral factor produced by stimulated cells was IFN-I. this indicates that PARP14 is necessary for efficient IFN-I production during CoV infection and poly(I:C) stimulation. osyltransferase activity since these inhibitors target the catalytic site of PARPs. the conserved CoV macrodomain functions to counter the activity of cellular PARP enzymes. however, this conclusion will require further validation. studies with chikungunya virus and Sindbis virus demonstrate that the alphavirus macrodomain counters cellular ADP-ribosylation as mutants with decreased ADP-ribose binding and enzymatic activity had mild to severe replication defects. however, very little PARP induction was observed in infected cells, and a MARylation inhibitor decreased WT virus replication. BMDMs, human PARP14 KO A549 and NHDF cells found that PARP14 was required for robust IFN-I production during CoV infection or poly(I:C) stimulation. the absence of PARP14 did not affect IRF-3 translocation to the nucleus but rather altered histone modification and reduced pol II recruitment to specific ISG promoters in the nucleus. anesthesia or euthanasia were accomplished using isoflurane and ketamine/xylazine or ketamine/xylazine. cell culture, plasmids, and reagents Delayed brain tumor (DBT) were propagated in perlman laboratory since 1983. pSport6-FLAG/PARP12 was obtained as a generous gift from Dr. Oberdan Leo (Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Gosselies, Belgium). mouse IFN and human IFN were purchased from PBL Assay Science (12401\u20131 and 11200\u20131). 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) (A4161) and XAV-939 (A1877) were purchased from APExBIO.
