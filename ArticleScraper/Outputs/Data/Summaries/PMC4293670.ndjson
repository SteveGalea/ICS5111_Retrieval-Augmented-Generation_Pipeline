{"summary": "licorice is the dried root of Glycyrrhiza glabra, Glycyrrhiza inflata or Glycyrrhiza uralensis, a member of legumes endogenous to Asia and southern Europe. the most important constituent of licorice is glycyrrhizin (G, 3-O-(2-O--d-glucopyranuronosyl--d-glucopyranuro the amount of GA in licorice root is reported to be in the 0.1\u20131.6% range. the amount of GA in licorice root is reported to be in the 0.1\u20131.6% range. the antihepatotoxic activity of GA is higher than that of GA. a total of 8 extracts representing three different Glycyrrhiza species were analyzed. a total of 8 well-characterized Glycyrrhiza samples representing a broad geographic and genetic sampling of species across the world were analyzed. rhizin (95%), 18-glycyrrhetinic acid (99%) and 18-glycyrrhetinic acid (99%) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) plant extraction and NMR measurement Dried and deep frozen Glycyrrhiza root powder (60 mg) was homogenized with 5 ml 100% MeOH using a Turrax mixer (11,000 RPM) for five 20 s periods a 1.31 s relaxation delay resulted in a total acquisition time of 28 min. the cells were grown as monolayers in adherent cell lines. cells were plated at a density of 1 104/well in 96-well plates. absorbance measured at 490 nm against a reference wavelength at 650 nm using a microplate reader. the mean of triplicate experiments for each dose was used to calculate the IC50. spectrophotometric method was adapted for TP assays in Glycyrrhiza roots. extracts were prepared by cold extraction with shaking over 3 h using 100% MeOH. plant debris was removed by centrifugation and solvent was removed by evaporation under nitrogen followed by lyophilization. G. uralensis China, eastern Inner Mongolia 2000 GU3 G. uralensis Commercial, Dongbei-Gancao, Vietnam 2009 Methanol-D4 (99.80% D) was purchased from Deutero GmbH (Kastellaun, Germany) standards for -glycyrrhizin (95%), 18-glycyrrhetinic acid (99%) and 18-glycyrrhetinic acid (99%) 2D ROESY spectra was recorded using standard CHEMPACK 4.1 pulse sequences (gROESY) implemented in Varian VNMRJ 2.2C spectrometer software. using a 1.31 s relaxation delay resulted in a total acquisition time of 28 min. 100 l of XTT-solution (2,3-bis (2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino) carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide) was added to each well. plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for another 4 h at a. percent inhibition of the COX enzymes was determined by comparing extract loaded wells with positive and negative controls. commercially available COX-1 inhibitor (SC-560) with an IC50 value of 100 M was used as positive reference for comparison. in the sugar region, signals at 4.49 d (7.3 Hz) and 4.67 d (7.7 Hz) were assigned to anomeric protons of glucuronic acid moieties at H-1\u2032 and H-1\u2032\u2032 position in glycyrrhizin, respectively [17]. despite crowded 1H NMR spectra, g isomer conformational assignment could not be successfully confirmed in most licorice extracts. ROESY spectra for - and -glycyrrhetic acid standard show distinctive crosspeaks between H-18 and its neighboring protons indicative for each isomer configuration. while the -isomer exhibits 1,3-diaxial interaction between H-18 (2.37) and CH3-27 (1.39) as well as CH3-29 ( 1.24), the -isomer shows interaction between H-18 (2.18) and equatorial CH3-28 appearing at 0.82 (Fig. methanol extracts from 11 samples inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1), an enzyme involved in inflammation processes. extracts from G. glabra and G. uralensis were among the most effective ones tested at doses of 100, 150, and 200 g/ml. accessions demonstrating the most potent anti-inflammatory effect were enriched in TP, i.e. G. glabra and G. uralensis. no significant difference in TP or anti-inflammatory effect was observed for samples belonging to the same species but coming from different geographical origin. all samples were tested for growth inhibition of (mutated androgen dependent) prostate (PC3) and (androgen independent) colon (HT-29) cancer cell lines at doses of 5, 10 and 20 g/ml. the high content of moderately cytotoxic compounds such as polyphenols and chalcones in G. inflata [17] probably is responsible for the growth inhibition effect. anti-inflammatory effect in relation to total phenolics (TP) content. extracts from 11 samples were among the most effective ones. extracts from G. glabra and G. uralensis were the least effective ones tested at doses of 100, 150, and 200 g/ml. accessions demonstrating the most potent anti-inflammatory effect were enriched in TP, i.e. G. glabra and G. uralensis. a similar trend was observed for species with low TP, i.e. G. echinata. all samples were tested for growth inhibition of (mutated androgen dependent) prostate (PC3) and (androgen independent) colon (HT-29) cancer cell lines at doses of 5, 10 and 20 g/ml. the high content of moderately cytotoxic compounds such as polyphenols and chalcones in G. inflata [17] probably is responsible for the growth inhibition effect. conflict of interest The authors have declared no conflict of interest. this study does not include work on patients or animals."}
