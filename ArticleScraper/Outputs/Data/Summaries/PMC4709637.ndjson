{"summary": "the up-regulated MAPK protein was further verified by western blotting. DF-1 cells were infected by live viral stocks of ALV-J CHN06 for 60 h at a multiplicity of infection (MOI of 1) DF-1 cells were infected by live viral stocks of ALV-J CHN06 (104 TCID50 0.2 ml1), ALV-J NX0101 (104 TCID50 0.2 ml1), ALV-A GD13-1 (104 TCID50 0.2 ml1), ALV-B CD08 (104 TCID50 0.2 ml1) or wild strains of ALV-J KNE131218 (S/P ratio of ERK2 phosphorylation was examined in DF-1 cells infected by ALV-A or B, NX0101 or wild strains of ALV-J, or various virus titers of CHN06, at 15 min and 120 h p.i. the results are representative of two to three independent experiments. expression levels of ERK phosphorylation increased with the ALV-J strain CHN06 virus titer at 120 h p.i. DF-1 cells were mock infected or infected by CHN06, GD13-1 or CD08. after 15 min or 120 h, cell lysates were collected and the amounts of p-c-Jun, c-Jun, p-JNK, total JNK, p-p38, total p38 and GAPDH were evaluated by western blotting. results are representative of two to three independent experiments. DF-1 cells were preincubated with 20 M SP600125 (a), 20 M SB203580 (b), 20 M PD98059 (c) and 50 M PD98059(d) for 1 h and infected with CHN06, GD13-1 or CD08 at 104 TCID50 0.2 ml1. PD98059 (2.5\u201350 M), U0126 (5\u201310 M) or DMSO (0.1%, v/v) for 1 h and infected with CHN06 (a,b), GD13-1 (d) or CD08 (e) for 15 min, or with NX0101 (c) for 120 h, at 104 TCID50 0.2 ml1. DF-1 cells were stimulated for 10 min with different concentrations of purified gp85. cells were electroporated with pCMV-gag-EGFP or vector. seventy-two hours later, cell lysates were subjected to western blotting. phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase is an upstream regulator of MAPK activation in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) this is consistent with the findings in Fig. 3c, showing that there was no significant difference between the ALV subgroups in ERK2/AP1 pathway activation. a significant decrease in viral transcription was observed when either inhibitor was added at 1, 0 or 1 h p.i. however, no statistical differences in viral transcription were observed when either inhibitor was added at 4 h p.i. DF-1 cells were treated with SP600125, SB203580 (20 M) or DMSO (0.1%, v/v) at the indicated times during the infection with CHN06. the cellular VEGF transcription level was monitored by real-time RT-PCR. DF-1 cells were seeded in 24-well dishes and co-transfected with 0.2 g pGL3-LTR and 0.02 g pRL-TK. at 48 h p.i., cells were lysed for luciferase detection. 20 M PD98059 dramatically suppressed gp85 protein expression of ALV-J strains CHN06 and NX0101. in contrast, 20 M SP600125 or 20 M SB203580 did not affect the gp85 protein expression of ALV-J. these results suggest that the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway plays an important role in ALV-J viral protein synthesis in vitro. gp85 expression was visualized by epifluorescent microscopy. the results were positive for ALV-J, and negative for ALV-A, ALV-B, REV and MDV. western blot analysis of tumor cells from the liver of ALV-J-infected chickens. fresh tissues were collected and fixed in 10% neutralized buffered formalin. sections were routinely stained with hematoxylin and eosin. DF-1 cells were infected by live viral stocks of ALV-J CHN06 for 60 h. cell lysates were subjected to western blotting with rabbit anti-p44/42 MAPK and GAPDH antibodies. iTRAQ ratios are shown on the right side. viral stocks were filtered and pelleted by centrifugation. the filtrate, pellet and supernatant were used individually to infect DF-1 cells. the results are representative of two to three independent experiments. pellet from the viral stocks of CHN06 induced p-ERK at 15 min and 120 h p.i. no signal was detected in the cellular extraction of DF-1 cells inoculated with supernatant after centrifugation. results indicate that CHN06 virus particles activated ERK at the stage of cell infection. DF-1 cells were mock infected or infected by p-c-Jun, c-Jun, p-JNK, total JNK, p-p38, total p38 and GAPDH. the results were representative of two to three independent experiments. DF-1 cells treated with different concentrations of inhibitors have no cell toxicity except 20 M LY294002. PD98059 simultaneously inhibited the ALV-induced c-Jun phosphorylation and VEGF-A expression at 120 h p.i. DF-1 cells were preincubated with PD98059 (2.5\u201350 M), U0126 (5\u201310 M) or DMSO (0.1%, v/v) for 1 h. PD98059 or U0126 pretreatment inhibited the ALV-induced ERK phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner. the inhibitors or DMSO were in the cell culture fluid all the time. gp85 or gag protein alone induces ERK2/AP1 activation. DF-1 cells were exposed to different concentrations of purified gp85 for 10 min. gp85 increased the phosphorylation level of ERK2 and c-Jun. at 104 TCID50 0.2 ml1, we detected a strong phosphorylated ERK2 signal in both the vector control sample and the gag-expressing sample. thus, we concluded that the cationic lipid reagents boosted signal transduction28, therefore we used electroporation to transiently express gag. however, gag-expressing cells showed a greater degree of ERK2 and c-Jun phosphorylation. this is consistent with the findings in PI3K-induced Akt and ERK phosphorylation were PI3K-dependent and MAPKK-dependent respectively. however, MAPKK inhibitor PD98059 could not suppress Akt phosphorylation. these results suggest that the ALV could induce the activation of the ERK/AP-1 and PI3K/Akt pathways may be in parallel. DF-1 cells were treated with PD98059, U0126, SP600125, SB203580 (20 M) or DMSO (0.1%, v/v) at the indicated times during the infection with CHN06. at 72 h p.i., viral production was monitored by real-time RT-PCR. effects of MAPK pathway inhibitors on ALV promoter activity. ERK pathway inhibitor, PD98059, also significantly inhibited ALV promoter activity. PD98059 caused dose-dependent increase in levels of CHN06 LTR promoter activity. at 48 h p.i., cells were lysed for luciferase detection. results suggest the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway plays an important role in ALV-J viral protein synthesis in vitro. DF-1 cells were mock treated or simultaneously incubated with 50 M PD98059 or DMSO (0.1%, v/v) during the infection with CHN06 or NX0101 (105 TCID50 0.2 ml1) assays have been previously described32 and the results were all positive for ALV-J, and negative for ALV-A, ALV-B, REV and MDV. the tumor cells were observed as relatively uniform large myeloid cells and lymphoid cell hyperplasia in the liver whose morphology are similar to eosinophils. western blot analysis detected high expression of p-ERK proteins in myeloid leukosis (ML) samples, but not in the normal samples. we examined the role of the MAPK pathway during exogenous ALV infection and pathogenesis. the experiments presented in the current study provide evidence that exogenous ALV could induce and sustain activation of ERK2. ERK2 was found to be phosphorylated at 15 min, 6 h and from 108 h to 132 h post ALV-J infection. both ALV-A and ALV-B triggered the production of phosphorylated ERK at 15 min and 120 h p.i. c-Jun-phosphorylation could be inhibited by PD98059 instead of SP600125 and SB203580. AP-1 present in the promoter region of the human VEGF gene has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of VEGF gene expression46,47. compared with the negative control DF-1 cells, the CHN06 strain of ALV-J caused a 1.75-fold up-regulation of VEGF mRNA at 72 h p.i. the ERK pathway inhibitor, PD9859 and U0126, the JNK pathway inhibitor, SP600125, and the p38 pathway inhibitor, SB203580, further investigated whether the MAPK inhibitors affect ALV 5\u2019LTR promoter activity. PD98059 almost completely blocked ALV 5\u2019LTR promoter activity with a mere 500nM dose. the unique 3\u2032 region of retroviral LTRs has been characterized with transcriptional enhancers and promoters60,61,62,63, and multiple cis-acting enhancer elements have been verified within the avian retroviruses64. the discrepant effects of SP600125 between CHN06 strain viral RNA level and LTR promoter activity remain unclear. infection with exogenous subgroup J, A or B ALVs could activate the ERK/AP1 pathway in associated with viral gp85 and gag proteins. the ERK/MAPK pathway plays an important role in ALV-J virus replication.
