{"summary": "aquatic birds are the main reservoir of influenza A viruses in nature. adapted viruses from aquatic birds to mammals involves a change in tissue tropism from intestinal to respiratory epithelia. more than one thousand human infections with avian influenza viruses were detected in the last decade. the severity of zoonotic influenza A infections ranges from clinically inapparent to fatal. only a very small proportion of them are due to sustained person-to-person transmission with global spread. there are 18 known HA types and 11 known NA types. the infection must spread beyond the local area to infect members of distant populations. step 3 and 4 appear to be the rare, rate-limiting steps. no case is known in which an influenza A strain has reached stage 4 but failed to reach stage 5. onotic isolates of novel influenza A viruses are thought to correlate with increased risk of pandemic emergence. the process of human adaptation needs not be complete to initiate a pandemic, so it may continue to occur at various stages throughout this progression. some argue that there is a general phenotype of 'transmissibility by respiratory droplets in mammals' ferret model recapitulates many features of human infection. changes identified in adaptation to ferret transmission would also be important for adaptation to sustained transmission in humans. notably, viruses isolated from humans who were infected by contact with birds show some of these changes. it is not currently feasible to invest in such countermeasures against all viruses circulating in avian or other reservoirs. there would be value in an accurate system to assess the relative pandemic risks posed by each virus. this consideration has motivated calls for comprehensive analysis of all available data to assess the threat to public health posed by these strains. in a given infection (Poon et al., 2016; Varble et al., 2014; hoye et al., 2010; imperfect public health systems lacking capacity to detect zoonotic infections presenting in patients; epistasis and other complexities that prevent straightforward prediction of viral traits from genotype. influenza virus subtype is a convenient classification but there can be substantial variation in estimable risk within subtype. phylogenetic clade is a practical unit for risk prediction. but in species where reassortment is frequent, phylogenetic clades must be considered on a gene by gene basis. swine and other domestic animals with extensive human interactions should be prioritized for surveillance and further study. study will then be required to assess the abundance and prevalence of different virus subtypes and clades. the substantial antigenic diversity of viruses circulating in swine is driven in large part by introduction of viruses from humans to swine. an avian influenza virus could acquire one or more of the determinants of pandemic potential by reassorting with a human seasonal influenza virus. with only one pandemic every few decades, the data set for testing the prediction is inadequate. evolutionary events in which a strain increases human-to-human transmissibility, but not enough to spark a pandemic are extremely hard to observe. all three traits changed in the adaptation of zoonotic H5 influenza viruses to droplet transmission in ferrets. novel approaches to identifying genomic predictors of traits and transmission phenotypes have generated new approaches to characterizing the genotype-trait and genotype-transmission maps in influenza viruses. methods that aim to identify sites under positive selection in the HA protein often find regions or sites that seem to contradict experimental evidence. passaging in regular MDCK cells produces a strong signal of positive adaptation underneath the sialic-acid binding site; this signal is entirely absent in unpassaged virus or virus passaged in SIAT1 MDCK cells. molecular features have been defined as distinct networks of inter-residue interactions involving key residues that make contacts with the different glycan receptor topologies. these features go beyond hallmark residue analyses and more accurately predict how amino acid variations in the receptor binding site impact the inter-residue interactions. association studies have begun mapping the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana to over 107 quantitative traits and the genomes of humans to over 100,000. these studies often investigate genetic variation at the scales of single nucleotide polymorphisms, alleles, and loci. TCGA amassed sequences from thousands of diverse tumors to investigate the mutations leading to different cancer types. the genetic commonality among tumors of any given type is shockingly low. a systematic screening strategy might include four components. the mutagenesis and screening involved would be extremely large in scope. some computational pre-screening to narrow the set of residues tested combined with contemporary mutagenesis and screening technologies. HA pH of activation HA avoids extracellular inactivation and undergoes conformational changes leading to membrane fusion at appropriate pH for human cells. the virus polymerase complex replicates the virus genome in conjunction with co-opted cell proteins. man et al., 2014; Seladi-Schulman et al., 2013; Campbell et al., 2014; Beale et al., 2014; Beale et al., 2014; Beale et al., 2014; beale et al., 2014; beale et al., 2014; beale et al., 2014; beale et al., 2014; bea avian isolates of H5N5 (Li et al., 2015), North American H7 (Belser et al., 2015), H7N9 (Schrauwen et al., 2016) found in human isolates H5N1 zoonotic isolate (Imai et al., 2012; Yamada et al., 2006) a possible counter to this interpretation is that it is seen only in the earliest isolates from human pandemic viruses. nearly all isolates from after the pandemic year, which should also have been passaged in eggs, show human-adapted phenotypes. a few entries in databases show sequences associated with human adaptation as of 2005. zoonotic H9N2 (Chen et al., 2006); some zoonotic H5N9 (associated with milder course); some zoonotic H5N9 (associated with milder course); some zoonotic H7N9 (associated with milder course) this review starts with a summary of our knowledge about the role of each of the three functional traits in conferring pandemic potential on a virus strain. if the avian traits were always found in avian isolates and human traits always in human isolates, only the shaded cells on the main diagonal would be filled. the trait Attachment of an influenza virus to a host cell requires binding of the viral HA to a sialylated glycan receptor (sialic acid) on the surface of the host cell. human upper respiratory epithelial cells express mainly glycan receptors terminated by 2,6-linked sialic acid. the evolution of receptor binding specificity is driven by the host environment. the error-prone replication of influenza genomes can facilitate rapid emergence of viruses with amino acid substitutions that alter the receptor binding characteristics of the HA. avian-adapted HAs typically carry Glu at position 190, Gln at position 226, and Gly and position 228 (H3 numbering), and the Gln226->Leu, Gly228->Ser substitutions have been associated with a switch to human receptor preference in HAs of H2, H3 (Matrosovich et al., 2000) hemagglutinin receptor binding specificity was first obtained by hemagglutination assays with erythrocytes whose surfaces had been chemically modified to display glycans terminating with either homogeneous 2,3 or homogeneous 2,6-linked sialic acids. greater precision and reproducibility has been achieved with the use of purified sialylated glycans to create solid-phase binding assays. biosensor interferometry and thermophoresis have been used to measure glycan-binding avidities and affinities in a more precise manner. the development of glycan microarrays represented a turning point in the analysis of influenza virus receptor binding specificity because it allowed simultaneous evaluation of virion or recombinant HA binding to a large repertoire of sialoglycans. genetic and protein sequence analysis, glycan arrays, and X-ray crystallography studies provide complementary data towards understanding the sialoglycan interactions of emerging viruses. estimating the contribution of receptor specificity to the pandemic risk posed by a novel virus relies primarily on the similarity between the receptor binding characteristics of the emerging virus and that of the most closely related HA with known transmissibility among humans or a surrogate animal model. phenotypic assays that directly measure the receptor-binding preference of HA may better capture the trait of interest than genetic predictions of this preference. a simple equivalence between binding preference for 2,6-linked glycans and pandemic risk could be misleading. a strong correlation between measured receptor preference and host from which a virus is isolated. however, they raise questions about the predictive value of human receptor binding preference. detection of a human receptor preference may be an indication of increased risk. upper respiratory epithelial cells express mainly glycan receptors terminated by 2,6-linked sialic acid. human adaptation of an HA is associated with a switch in its binding preference from avian to human receptors. the evolution of receptor binding specificity is driven by the host environment. genetic and structural determinants of hemagglutinin-receptor interactions Preference for binding human or avian glycan receptors is determined by the structure of the viral HA. antigenic regions of the HA are located nearby regions that determine receptor-binding preference. glu190Asp and Gly225Asp have been considered as hallmark amino acid changes to switch receptor specificity leading to greater human adaptation. cis and trans definition of glycan conformation does not fully describe HA binding to a range of structurally diverse glycans displayed on human respiratory cells and tissues. human conformations were obtained by hemagglutination assays with erythrocytes whose surfaces had been chemically modified to display glycans terminating with either homogeneous 2,3 or homogeneous 2,6-linked sialic acids. the development of glycan microarrays represented a turning point in the analysis of influenza virus receptor binding specificity. a limitation to predictive power is that glycans tested on current arrays may not match those present in the human respiratory tract. these arrays may also not present glycans in the same fashion as respiratory epithelial cells, so strategies such as measuring the binding of labelled viruses to human respiratory tissues may be promising alternatives. hallmark residues in the H1, H2 and H3 subtype correlate with human-adaptation in known sequences collected from birds or humans. they induce changes in receptor-binding specificity when introduced experimentally (Chen et al., 2012; Leigh et al., 1995); and experimental selection for receptor binding in vitro (Chen et al., 2012) or in ferrets (Imai et al., 2012) cause these changes to appear. in the case of early 2009 pandemic viruses, findings are mixed. some of the findings may reflect artifacts introduced when human isolates were passaged in eggs before receptor specificity was assayed. alternatively, they may reflect a transitional stage in the evolution of HA genes in human populations after transmission from other species. most viruses isolated to date fall within the shaded cells in Table 2. prioritizing pandemic countermeasures against virus lineages will likely lead to better targeting of such countermeasures on average. but counterexamples of human-to-human transmission suggest that in particular cases, reliance on this trait as a necessary condition may not identify all virus lineages that are in fact capable of causing a pandemic. structural changes that expose the fusion peptide and lead to fusion have been described in detail. if the virion is exposed to sufficiently low pH outside of a host or host cell, the HA protein undergoes irreversible structural changes too early. if the HA is too stable, further traffic into lysosomes results in virus inactivation by lysosomal proteases. a mutation that decreased the HA activation pH of A/chicken/Vietnam/C58/2004 (H5N1) from 5.9 to 5.4 has been shown to attenuate virus growth and prevent transmission in mallard ducks. a higher HA activation pH (5.6\u20136.0) has been associated with a component of fitness in birds and a lower HA activation pH (pH 5.0\u20135.4) two H5N1 viruses were adapted to transmit by the airborne route between ferrets. a final mutation that decreased the HA activation pH was shown to be necessary for airborne transmissibility in ferrets. however, this acid stability change is not sufficient in the absence of human receptor-binding specificity. experimental assays have been developed to measure the activation pH of the HA protein. the pH of inactivation can be measured using aliquots of virions exposed to buffers of various pH values. fluorescent probes are used to label virions, HA-expressing cells, and/or target liposomes or cells. HA-expressing cells can be assayed for trypsin susceptibility after low-pH exposure. prefusion HA is resistant and postfusion HA susceptible to trypsin degradation. HA refolding can also be triggered by other destabilizing agents such as heat and urea. a destabilizing HA mutation in the background of H1N1pdm results in a loss-of-function of airborne transmissibility in ferrets. mutations that lower the HA activation pH to 5.3, a value representative of human-adapted H1N1pdm viruses. the existence of these human-like avian viruses is perhaps unsurprising, as they may lack other essential adaptations for human transmission. a high-resolution determination of HA structural intermediates may assist in developing molecular modeling approaches to calculate HA stability from sequence. the HA must undergo a low-pH triggered conformational change to a state capable of fusing the viral and endosomal membranes. the pH of activation can be defined as a continuous measurement representing the least acidic (highest) pH at which a particular HA molecule is triggered. the HA protein undergoes irreversible structural changes too early. it is unable to mediate virus entry; such virions become inactivated. if the HA is too stable, further traffic into lysosomes results in virus inactivation. low-pathogenic duck viruses appear to range in acid stability from pH 5.3\u20136.0. highly pathogenic avian viruses range from 5.6\u20136.0. a mutation that decreased the HA activation pH of A/chicken/Vietnam/C58/2004 (H5N1) from 5.9 to 5.4 has been shown to attenuate virus growth. HA protein whose activation pH was 5.5 or lower was shown to be required for the pandemic potential of 2009 pH1N1 influenza virus. mutations that modify the activation pH do not appear to alter the prefusion HA protein backbone in X-ray crystal structures. a variety of experimental techniques have been developed to measure the activation pH of the HA protein. classical membrane fusion assays have measured the property in bulk. the pH of inactivation can be measured using aliquots of virions exposed to buffers of progressively lower pH. fluorescent probes are used to label virions, HA-expressing cells, and/or target liposomes. HA refolding can also be triggered by other destabilizing agents such as heat and urea. stability at a lower pH is associated with stability at higher temperatures and higher urea concentrations. the existence of these human-like avian viruses is perhaps unsurprising. reliance on this trait to prioritize pandemic prevention measures should consider this property in conjunction with other properties associated with pandemic potential. merase subunits (PA, PB1, PB2 gene products, together forming the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and nucleoprotein (NP gene product) are required to transcribe and replicate the viral genome. avian virus polymerase typically performs inefficiently in replicating the viral genome in human cells. a different set of PB2 mutations including changes at residues at 271, 590 and 591 lie on the same external surface. mammalian-adapting mutations increase the positive charge of this domain, suggesting that they either adapt the virus for interaction with an enhancing host factor or enhance its ability to repel a restriction factor. the adaptive value of these mutations is shown by experimental or observational data in which a mammalian host is infected with a virus whose PB2 is not adapted for efficient mammalian replication. such a mutation becomes common in the virus population over the course of infection. the original form of the in situ reconstituted polymerase assay requires expression of just the minimal set of four viral proteins to replicate the minigenome RNA. however, recent work showed an important additional role for another protein, the nuclear export protein (NEP), which is translated from a spliced mRNA derived from RNA segment 8 (that also encodes the major interferon antagonist NS2) the minimal polymerase assay is not always sufficient to predict viruses that have functionally adapted polymerase activity to human cells. a role for other viral proteins including at least NEP should also be considered in assessment of polymerase function. this could be achieved by measuring intracellular levels of viral transcripts using transcriptomics or qRT-PCR. polymerase complex efficiency in pandemic risk prediction. polymerase of avian influenza viruses in mammalian cells is one of the host-range barriers that likely diminishes pandemic risk. adaptation of avian virus polymerase by accumulation of adaptive mutations can enhance avian virus polymerase function sufficiently to support a host range jump. no single polymerase mutation appears to be predictive of pandemic risk. concept that the polymerase must adapt to human cells before it can cause extensive human-to-human transmission appears consistent with the four pandemic jumps that have occurred in modern times. the most famous of these mutations was later described as PB2 residue 627 (Subbarao et al., 1993), which is a glutamic acid (Glu) in avian influenza viruses but a lysine (Lys) in human-adapted viruses, including those that emerged in the pandemics of 1918, 1957 and 1968. in this virus, the PB2 segment had been introduced from an avian precursor into swine viruses in the 1990s. residue 701 of PB2 lies close to but is distinct from the 627 cluster. other mutations have been described that adapt PB2 for the mammalian nucleus. the adaptive value of these mutations is shown by experimental or observational data. reverse genetics experiments show that certain strains of avian influenza may be less able to accept these mutations than others. reverse genetics experiments show that certain strains of avian influenza may be less able to accept these mutations than others. mutations that increase the ability of NEP to rescue avian polymerase function allow more ready unfolding of the protein. however, mutations that increase the ability of NEP to rescue avian polymerase function allow more ready unfolding of the protein, unmasking the \u201cactivating\u201d domain at the lower temperature of the mammalian respiratory tract. a viral polymerase is influenced by at least 4 different viral genes. it involves interactions with several different human host factors. this phenotype is influenced by at least 4 different viral genes. this phenotype is influenced by at least 4 different viral genes. the absence of the signature PB2 627K mutation in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain demonstrates the limitations of relying on any single mutation for risk prediction. the concept that adaptation of the polymerase is necessary for sustained human transmission is validated by findings that the 2009 pandemic strain had adapted to replication in human cells by changes other than E627K within the polymerase. a candidate vaccine virus was produced from a virus representative of the 2013 Cambodian outbreaks. these findings led to extensive epidemiological and experimental investigations. they led to the decision to produce a candidate vaccine virus from a virus representative of the 2013 Cambodian outbreaks. a new pandemic strain would violate an apparent rule of human adaptation that applied perfectly to previous pandemic strains. it is unclear whether the list of sites and traits associated with human adaptation is nearly complete or will continue to grow as we experience additional pandemics. aims to further refine our understanding of sequence-to-trait relationships. this could include generating mutations not found in known strains in nature. this would include generating mutations not found in known strains in nature. ferrets are highly susceptible to most influenza A viruses without prior host adaptation. the ferret model is particularly valuable, as ferrets are highly susceptible to most influenza A viruses without prior host adaptation. ferrets express the sialic acid N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), but not the sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), on respiratory epithelia. ferrets are uniquely suited for the study of influenza viruses compared with other small mammalian models which express Neu5Ac. ferrets are not suitable for high-throughput screens, so research in the ferret model is most potent when complemented with in vitro and computational approaches. ferrets are not well suited to model multiple influenza exposures over several years that may be experienced by humans. ferret is one of several well-characterized mammalian models for influenza virus. mice offer greater availability of species-specific reagents, permit studies with greater statistical power due to larger sample sizes. guinea pig offers several comparable advantages to ferrets, including generally similar lung physiology to humans. initiation of a pandemic requires not only a well-adapted virus but ecological opportunity to spill over into humans. selective bottlenecks, which have been observed in experimental transmission of H5N1 and avian-like H1N1 viruses in ferrets, could lower the barrier to emergence of human-adapted viruses. both ecological and host factors are considered in the CDC\u2019s IRAT. serological surveys can help to estimate the frequency of spillover infections from non-human to human hosts. serological surveys can help to estimate the degree of cross reactivity arising from endemic human strains that share recent genomic ancestors with non-human strains of concern. if the emergent strain fails to achieve sustained transmission, it is not immediately clear how best to use further information on the frequency of human spillover infections. cross reactivity between non-human and human influenza strains may indicate some degree of reduced population susceptibility. older individuals are thought to have been far less susceptible to pandemic H1N1 than younger individuals. mechanistic models could be used to estimate the degree of increased risk of emergence due to the aging of partially immune cohorts. neuraminidase gene segments have been color-coded to show an example shared infection history in humans who are current spillover hosts for H7N9 and H9N2. swine-origin strain was detected in swine surveillance prior to pandemic emergence. swine-origin virus had an HA intermediate between human and avian adaptation in terms of receptor binding. swine-origin virus lacked amino acid residues thought to confer human adaptation for the polymerase complex. a false negative may motivate expenditure on prevention measures directed at a strain that would not have caused a pandemic. a false negative may lead to a failure to respond to a strain that would not have caused a pandemic. there are alternative approaches to ferret gain-of-transmission experiments in highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. a 2009 pandemic virus was modified to express a mutation that increased pH of HA activation, then selected in ferrets for droplet transmission. a second site mutation partially restored the lower pH of activation of the selected virus. surveillance would be a key rate-limiting step for pandemic risk assessment. phenotypic characterization of strains and dissemination of this information is also important to maximizing the value of surveillance. more deliberate approaches to the design of surveillance systems would also depend on answering the question addressed in box 2: how different must a virus be from previously characterized viruses to merit separate evaluation of its pandemic risk\" a comprehensive assessment of priorities to prevent or mitigate the next pandemic should consider the balance between improving our risk assessment capacity and developing responses robust to the possibility that we will once again be caught by surprise. a comprehensive assessment of priorities to prevent or mitigate the next influenza pandemic should consider the balance between improving our risk assessment capacity. wetenschappelijk Onderzoek VIDI grant 91715372 to Sander Herfst. e voor wetenschappelijk Onderzoek VIDI grant 91715372."}
