{"summary": "porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is indistinguishable from porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) it is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration in piglets, and histopathological lesions typical of atrophic enteritis. the last one-third of the genome encodes four structural proteins. the common characteristics for all CoVs N proteins are high expression levels early in the infection and high anti-N antibody levels. PDCoV N protein is highly conserved among PDCoV strains but had low sequence identity with other porcine coronaviruses, such as PEDV, TGEV, and PRCV [21]. TGEV, PRCV, SADS-CoV, PHEV are identical, because PRCV is a S gene deletion of TGEV [27]. besides, SADS-CoV also known as swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV) [28] and porcine enteric alphacoronavirus (PEAV) [29]. the monoclonal 4E88 showed the greatest reactivity with the N protein in infected cells. the monoclonal 4E88 showed the greatest reactivity with the N protein in infected cells. pET28a-N transfected cells post sonication. 4E88, 3B5, 11E, and 7D2 react well with denatured N protein. monoclonal 6A5 did not react with denatured N protein, indicating it may recognize a conformational epitope. four truncations of the N3-3 fragment were constructed: N3-1 (301-330 aa), N3-3-2 (308-342aa), N3-3-3 (221-328 aa), and N3-3-4 (221-318 aa) mAb 4E88 reacted only with the N3-3 fragment. the amino acids 308-318 are at a minimum necessary for the interaction. mAb 4E88 reacted most strongly with P1, reacted about half as well with P2, P3, and P6, and did not react with P4 or P5, demonstrating that the 4E88 minimal epitope is amino acids 309-317. PDCoV, sparrow coronavirus (HKU17) and Asian leopard cat coronavirus (ALCCoV) share 100% sequence similarity in the position of epitope 4E88. newly discovered Quail deltacoronavirus (UAE-HKU30) and Sparrow deltacoronavirus (SpDCoV) share 90% sequence similarity with PDCoV. PDCoV is the only porcine deltacoronavirus; sequence alignment of the 4E88 epitope with other porcine coronaviruses was performed to determine conservation among coronavirus genera. results showed very low sequence similarity, the highest being 22.2%. rNP was soluble and found predominantly in the supernatant post sonication (lane 4), and lanes 6 show the Ni-NTA purified rNP at the expected size, 44 kDa. pig anti-PDCoV hyperimmune serum expressed pET28a-N and empty vector pET-28a. monoclonal 4E88 showed the greatest reactivity with the N protein in infected cells. the reactivity of cells detected by each monoclonal was quantitated by Imagine Pro plus 6.0. PDCoV NS6 was used as a negative control. ELISA results showed that all the five mAbs recognized the N3 fragment but did not react with N1 and N2. mAb 4E88 reacted only with the N3-3 fragment. mAb 4E88 reacted most strongly with P1, reacted about half as well with P2, P3, and P6, and did not react with P4 or P5. mAb 4E88 reacted most strongly with P1, reacted about half as well with P2, P3, and P6. mAb 4E88 is highly conserved among the PDCoV strains analyzed. PDCoV, sparrow coronavirus and Asian leopard cat coronavirus share 100% sequence similarity in epitope 4E88. PDCoV is the only porcine deltacoronavirus; sequence alignment of the 4E88 epitope with other porcine coronaviruses was performed to determine conservation among coronavirus genera. the results showed very low sequence similarity, the highest being 22.2%. PDCoV, a novel swine enteropathogen, has spread rapidly since first discovered in 2012 in Hong Kong. compared with other coronavirus proteins, the N protein is preferred candidate for serological diagnostics because it is abundant and highly conserved among coronavirus species. monoclonal antibodies were produced against purified recombinant N-protein. they all recognized the 122 C-terminal amino acids of the N-protein. the largest of 10 predicted epitopes is in amino acids 221-342, this fragment we termed N3. PDCoV epitopes are fundamental for the development of epitope-based diagnostic tools, vaccines, and therapeutic antibodies. functional methods include X-ray crystallography, which can precisely locate the epitope position but it is limited to small soluble proteins. functional methods are used to detect the binding activity of antibody with antigen fragments, synthetic peptides or recombinant antigens. the shared sequence at position 309-317aa (epitope 4E88) among PDCoV, HKU17, ALCCoV, HKU30, and SpDCoV may contribute to the understanding of evolutionary relationship between birds and mammals. similar phenomenon was also found in other flaviviruses. cross-reactivity among swine coronaviruses has been reported. one-way cross-reaction between TGEV Miller hyperimmune pig antisera and various PEDV strains with the TGEV Miller N protein mAb was based on an N protein epitope. the PDCoV strain was preserved by the Laboratory of Research Center of Swine Disease in Sichuan Agricultural University. ST cells at 90% confluence were washed three times with DMEM supplemented with 5 g/mL trypsin-EDTA. for TGEV propagation, ST cells at 90% confluence were washed three times with DMEM supplemented with 10 g/mL trypsin-EDTA (maintenance medium) and then inoculated with 1 mL of PEDV. when CPE was observed, generally at 2 days post-infection, the cells were harvested then stored at 80 \u00b0C until further use. the recombinant rNP was purified from the supernatant post sonication by Ni-NTA His-Bind Resin. a series of truncated N-proteins were produced: His-N1, His-N2, His-N3, His-N3-1, His-N3-2, His-N3-3, His-N3-3-1, His-N3-3-2, His-N3-3-3, His-N3-3-4. Western Blotting Western blotting was used to test the reactivity of hyperimmune pig anti-serum against the recombinant N protein. Purified N protein and pET-28a (+) empty vector were subject to SDS-PAGE then transferred to a PVDF membrane. membrane washed three times with PBST then incubated with anti-PDCoV pig serum (1:200) overnight at 4 \u00b0C overnight. the membrane was washed four times with PBST and the proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents. mice were inoculated via subcutaneous injection with purified rN protein (100 g/mouse) mixed with an equal volume of Montanide Gel 01 PR adjuvant. 4.7. IFA ST cells were grown in 12-well plates until 80% confluent. half the wells were infected with PDCoV (MOI = 0.1) and half were mock infected. after 36 h post-infection, cells were washed twice with PBS. wells were rinsed again and incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG, (1:5000) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. color development was stopped with 3M H2SO4. peptides were dissolved in DMSO (Solarbio) to a concentration of 10 mg/mL, for dot-blotting 1 L (10 g) was spotted onto PVDF membrane, and for ELISA, 100 L (1 mg) were aliquoted into wells and incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 15 h.
