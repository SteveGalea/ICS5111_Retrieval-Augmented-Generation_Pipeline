{"summary": "the genus Ebolavirus of the family Filoviridae (Order: Mononegavirales) is comprised of five recognized species, with Zaire ebolavirus representing the prototype species. to date there have been numerous outbreaks of ZEBOV,1 the largest of which occurred in West Africa in 2014. the two serotypes of VSV, VSV-Indiana and VSV-New Jersey are both transmitted to mammals by hematophagous insects. transmission competent insect vectors of VSV include biting midges (Culicoides spp.), black flies (Simulium spp.), and mosquitoes. the prevalence of clinical cases in cattle herds is generally low (10%-20%). the resulting rVSVG-ZEBOV-GP construct has been tested in several animal models, including mice and non-human primates (NHPs) this vaccine has been shown to have an acceptable safety profile, to be immunogenic, and highly effective in preventing ebola virus disease (EVD) induced by ZEBOV in humans. the inability of V920 to replicate in arthropods was due to the replacement of the arbovirus envelope cassette with the ZEBOV GP gene. rVSV-SFV was also unable to replicate in arthropods in vitro and in vivo. virus titers of VSV-I were significantly higher (p-value 0.05) than V920 and rVSV-SFV as determined by a two-way ANOVA with a Tukey's correction at each timepoint. lOD = limit of detection (100 PFU/mL). rVSV-SFV had a stock titer of 6.6 log10 PFU/mL. mosquitoes were harvested on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 14 and infectious virus was quantified by plaque assay on vero cells. three-to-five mosquitoes were harvested at each timepoint, represented by specimens A-E. VSV-I reached peak titers of approximately 5 log10 PFU per mosquito between two and eight days post inoculation. V920 was recovered from one of three Ae. aegypti mosquitoes on each days 8, 10, and 12 post inoculation. rVSV-SFV was not recovered from Cx. quinquefasciatus on any days post inoculation. Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were exposed to blood meals containing either VSV-I, V920, or rVSV-SFV. at 14 days post exposure bodies were collected and assessed for presence of infectious virus. blood meal titers were confirmed by back-titration. no Ae. aegypti or Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes became infected with either V920 or rVSV-SFV. Titers of recovered virus in each mosquito are recorded in Tables S1-2. replication-competent virus particles were present in mosquito homogenate out to 7 days in Cx. quinquefasciatus and 14 days in Ae. aegypti. a two-way ANOVA was conducted with a Tukey's multiple comparisons test to compare the mean titer of each virus group. back titrations were conducted for each inoculum and confirmed to be within two-fold of the desired inoculum titer. each virus replicated to a high titer in Vero cells and caused significant cytopathic effect. mosquitoes Culex quinquefasciatus (Cx. quinquefasciatus) and Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti) were inoculated with 138 nl stock virus. the stock titer for both VSV-I and V920 was 8.3 log10 PFU/mL; rVSV-SFV had a stock titer of 6.6 0 4/4 1.4 1.4 2.4 1.7 0/3 0 0 0 2 4/4 4.4 4.4 4.3 5.1 0/4 0 0 0 0/3 0 0/3 0 0 0 3/3 4.7 4.5 4.1 0/3 0 0 0/3 0 0 0 0 8 3/3 5.4 4.9 4.7 1/3 0 0 2.5 0/3 0 0 0 10 4/4 4.5 5.2 V920 was recovered from one of three mosquitoes on eight days post inoculation. rVSV-SFV was recovered from one of three mosquitoes on each days 8, 10, and 12 dpi in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were exposed to blood meals containing either VSV-I, V920, or rVSV-SFV. blood meal titers were confirmed by back-titration. no Ae. aegypti or Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes became infected with either V920 or rVSV-SFV. a moderate midgut infection barrier is still present in this species. the titer of all viruses declined over time, but replication-competent virus particles were present in mosquito homogenate out to 7 days in Cx. quinquefasciatus and 14 days in Ae. aegypti. rVSVG-ZEBOV-GP does not replicate in any of the arthropod cell lines examined nor in live Culex or Aedes mosquitoes following intrathoracic inoculation or oral exposure. wild-type VSV-I is recognized for its potential to be transmitted by diverse taxa of arthropod vectors including mosquitoes. rVSV-SFV construct has the VSV G gene replaced with the full structural cassette of SFV, sans capsid. rVSV-SFV construct could be used to determine key mediators of host range infection and of alphaviruses and arboviruses in general. the cells comprising the C6/36 cell line, derived from larval Ae. albopictus, are perhaps not as permissive to infection with VSV as the other arthropod cell lines. the cell line, derived from larval Ae. albopictus, was selected for its increased permissiveness to replication of dengue and chikungunya viruses. replication-competent virus particles for both VSV-I and V920 were present in the homogenized mosquito matrix for 7 days in Cx. quinquefasciatus homogenate, and for 14 days in Ae. aegypti homogenate. rVSV-SFV was detected intermittently out to 12 days in Ae. aegypti. wild-type VSV-I was shown to infect both Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes, although a midgut infection barrier was present in both species. the results are consistent with a study that found moderate levels of virus dissemination in both species. ulbecco's minimal essential media (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S), 0.1% gentamycin, 0.1% amphotericin B. cells were stored in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. all arthropod cells were stored in a humidified incubator at 28\u00b0C in 5% CO2. the passage ranges of the cell cultures used during these experiments were as follows: Vero (passages 8\u201396), C6/36 (6\u201312), CuVa (17\u201336), LL-5 (94\u2013100), 4a3b (91\u2013121). rVSV-SFV is a VSV-I virus with the G protein replaced with the structural cassette of SFV sans capsid. additional stocks were generated on Vero cells via infection at a MOI of 0.01. infectious media was harvested 48 hours post infection (hpi), clarified via centrifugation at 4800xg for 30 minutes. e buffered saline (PBS) and insect cells were washed 3 times with appropriate cell culture media. 500 L supernatant was harvested, brought to 20% FBS, and frozen at -80\u00b0C for later plaque titration. debris from mosquitoes were centrifuged at 15,000xg for 5 minutes at 4\u00b0C. Approximately 5\u20137 day-old mosquitoes were administered a blood meal containing 1000 L defibrinated sheep blood. a suspension of homogenized mosquitoes was spiked with 7 log10 PFU of wt VSV-I or V920 and 6 log10 PFU rVSV-SFV. ten microliters gentamycin and 1 l amphotericin B were added to each sample every other day to prevent bacterial and fungal growth arising from mosquito homogenate. 4a3b (Anopheles gambia) cells50 were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S. LL-5 (sand fly; Lutzomyia longipalpis) cells51 were maintained in Schneider's media supplemented with 20% FBS and 1% P/S. rVSV-SFV is a VSV-I virus with the G protein replaced with the structural cassette of SFV sans capsid. rVSV-SFV is a virus with the G protein replaced with the structural cassette of SFV sans capsid. wild-type VSV-I strain 98\u20133514 was isolated from a horse during the 1998 outbreak in Colorado. no further information was available regarding the passage history of the virus or the case history of the animal from which it was isolated. titers from supernatant samples were determined by vero cell plaque assay. titers from supernatant samples were inoculated with 138 nL stock virus suspension. infectious blood meals were provided via water heated (37\u00b0C) glass membrane feeders using hog gut as the membrane. mosquitoes were anesthetized at 4\u00b0C and fully-engorged females were separated into new cartons. 6 log10 PFU rVSV-SFV incubated at 28\u00b0C in triplicate. five mosquitoes homogenized in 1000 L mosquito diluent. ten microliters gentamycin and 1 l amphotericin B were added to each sample every other day.
