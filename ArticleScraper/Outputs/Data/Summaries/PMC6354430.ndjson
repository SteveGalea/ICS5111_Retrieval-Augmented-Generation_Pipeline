{"summary": "microglia are resident macrophages of the central nervous system locally maintained through colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling. microglial depletion via CSF1R inactivation improves cognition in mouse models of neuroinflammation. but limits virologic control in the CNS of mouse models of neurotropic infections by unknown mechanisms. electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (10.1186/s12974-019-1397-4) contains supplementary material. the online version of this article contains supplementary material available to authorized users. PLX5622 broadly depletes Iba1+ cells. mice were fed chow containing PLX5622 or control chow for 2 weeks. microglia depletion was assessed by Iba1 immunohistochemical staining. for quantification panels, each symbol represents an individual control (black) or PLX5622 (red)-treated mouse, and bars indicate mean SEM. data shown represent analysis from one experiment with five mice per group, repeated in three independent experiments. PLX5622 treatment does not enhance BBB permeability. permeability measured by detection of sodium fluorescein accumulation in brain tissue homogenates derived from (A) olfactory bulb, (B) cortex, (C) cerebellum, (D) brainstem and (E) spinal cord. tissue viral loads measured by plaque assay at 2 and 4 dpi in control (black) or PLX5622-treated (red) mice. each symbol represents an individual control (black) or PLX5622 (red)-treated mouse. data shown represent analysis from one experiment with five mice per group. ns, not significant at P 0.05; *P 0.05; **P 0.01.
