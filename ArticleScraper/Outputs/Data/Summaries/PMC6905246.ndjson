{"summary": "inTRODUCTION Medical education is a professional cultivating program in which a student is transformed from a layperson to a physician through systematic learning. it is aimed at cultivating professional physicians who are devoted to lifelong learning and self-improvement, according to criticism from the national committee on foreign medical education and accreditation in 1998. the ministry of health and welfare of Taiwan launched the postgraduate year program (PGY program) on a trial basis before officially launching it in 2011. from 2019, medical graduates under the new PGY program will be required to 2-year training. countries transformed the old medical education program into a 6-year program. countries established criteria for qualified physician status according to the required professional abilities for health care. many countries have developed unique competency-based medical education (CBME) systems. medical education program should promote community medicine and general medicine education, emphasize students' self-directed learning, and advocate the inquired and interactive teaching methods. a 6-year medical education program was carried out since 2013 in Taiwan. the cognitive theory of teaching proposed by Anderson comprises four knowledge levels, namely practical knowledge, theoretical knowledge, procedural knowledge, and metacognitive knowledge. the overall goal of such a curriculum is to create a continuous and thorough medical learning process. a medical education that highly integrates clinical learning in basic curriculum facilitates context-based reflection. a medical professional in the 21st century should demonstrate nine standards for basic medical education, which are consistent with the aforementioned six core competencies of physicians. the changes in Taiwan's 6-year medical education program are consistent with dewey's perspective. the medical education program creates a complete learning environment using an innovative curriculum design that combines a formal curriculum, an informal curriculum, and a hidden curriculum. this enables students to learn at their own pace and thus improve their professional competencies and engage in self-directed learning by engaging in pre-class preparations. ADAPTATION OF TEACHERS IN CLINICAL TEACHING Teachers play a key role in the implementation of new teaching methods. the literature review revealed that the effectiveness of flipped teaching depends on learners' compliance and the established learning space. education reform advocates the transformation of clinical learning environment. but the center of the medical program, the patient, is ignored during the exercise of the reform. proponents of education reform must remain committed to the principle of prioritizing the interests of patients. financial support and sponsorship Tzu Chi Medical Mission Project 106-06-03, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation.
