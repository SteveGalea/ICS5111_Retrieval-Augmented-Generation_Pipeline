{"summary": "allo-HSCT recipients are at increasing risk for viral infections. improvements in viral diagnostics, such as use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular diagnostic methods, facilitate early diagnosis of viral infections. incidence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) infections and cytomegalovirus (CMV) diseases have significantly decreased because of the effective prophylaxis. risk factors for viral infections In the recipients of allo-HSCT, most viral infections are opportunistic and closely related with immune status. large-sampled epidemiological data on viral infections are absent in allo-HSCT recipients. a preponderance of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza virus (PIV) are reported. a preponderance of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza virus (PIV) are reported. the diagnosis of viral diseases in immunocompromised individuals is based on clinical manifestations and laboratory examination. a definitive diagnosis requires detection of specific virus in specimens obtained from involved tissues and secretions as well as blood, or even histopathologic evidences. however, such a definitive diagnosis is often unnecessary or unavailable due to the risk associated with the invasive procedure. viral culture is unsuitable in the early diagnosis because it takes days to weeks and requires specific cell lines. however, serology is less helpful for clinical decision in the recipients of allo-HSCT [24-26] antigen detection ++++++++ Most CARVs, herpesviruses, adenovirus Quick results Poor sensitivity PCR ++++ +++ All are possible Quick results High sensitivity Histopathology and immunohistochemistry NA NA NA NA Less helpful in diagnosis * \u201c+\u201d \u2013\u201c++++\u201d indicated low sensitivity to high sensitivity; # \u201c+\u201d \u2013\u201c++++\u201d indicated low specificity to high specificity; \u201c+\u201d \u2013\u201c++++\u201d indicated long prevention of viral infections is crucial to reduce the incidence and mortality of viral diseases. the strategies might be divided to prophylaxis pre-transplantation, during transplantation and post-transplantation. the incidence of HSV and VZV infections has decreased from 80% to lower than 5% in the recipients of allo-HSCT receiving antiviral prophylaxis. the incidence of viral pneumonia is 2.1-14% [4,20,64-66], and the incidence of viral pneumonia is 2.1-14% [4,20,64-66]. Typical clinical manifestations include fever, cough, myalgias. the mortality of viral encephalitis/meningitis ranges from 0% to 80%. adenovirus and norovirus are considered main causes of viral gastroenteritis. most common clinical manifestation of viral gastroenteritis is diarrhea, followed by vomiting and nausea. the incidence of viral hepatitis varies from 0.5% to 22%. the diagnosis should be based on exclusion of other transplant complications. adenovirus and CMV were suggested to be associated with late-onset HC. PTLD with extranodal involvement usually have poor outcome. mortality of PTLD is 50-64%. other viral diseases Bone marrow suppression is common. herpesvirus pneumonia is usually caused by reactivation of latent viruses which occurs in severe immunosuppression such as early period of transplantation. herpesviruses are the most frequent pathogens in sporadic viral encephalitis/meningitis. incidence of viral encephalitis after allo-HSCT was 1.2% in a retrospective study. adenovirus and CMV are increasingly recognized as important pathogens of viral gastroenteritis in the recipients of allo-HSCT. most common clinical manifestation of viral gastroenteritis is diarrhea, followed by vomiting and nausea. most common clinical manifestation of viral gastroenteritis is diarrhea. HC is divided into early-onset HC (within 48 hours of conditioning) and late-onset HC (occurring after 48 hours) early-onset HC is often due to the toxicity of conditioning regimen such as cyclophosphamide. some studies suggested that acute GVHD might increase the risk of HC. the mortality of PTLD is 50-64%. other viral diseases Bone marrow suppression is common in allo-HSCT recipients. graft failure is a fatal complication after transplantation. 80% of the healthy population have history of HSV-1 and 2 infections. the incidence of HSV reactivation has now decreased to 0-3%. prophylactic oral acyclovir has been administered routinely in allo-HSCT recipients. VZV immunization is advocated in recipients without a history of varicella. vaccine is safe in children with leukemia, but few data are available in transplant recipients. vaccine of VZV-seronegative individuals should be done. preemptive therapy based on CMV antigenemia significantly reduces the development of CMV disease in allo-HSCT patients. the mortality of CMV disease is more than 50% even with treatments [67,124]. the diagnosis includes CMV viremia, CMV syndrome and CMV end-organ disease. leen et al. reported that the response rate of CMV-specific CTL was 73.9% in the treatment of CMV diseases after allo-HSCT. primary EBV infection or reactivation usually induces asymptomatic infection or infectious mononucleosis in immunocompetent people. rituximab is recommended as preferred preemptive therapy, followed by reduction of immunosuppresants and EBV-specific CTL in the european guidelines [25] antiviral agents (e.g. acyclovir and ganciclovir) can reduce EBV replication, but is not active in PTLD, presumably because that viral thymidine kinase expression is low during lytic phase and lack during latency. rituximab monotherapy was reported 44-69% whereas the relapse rate was 18-32%. rituximab monotherapy has higher response rate (50-88%) and fewer relapse (0%). clinical data on EBV fever and end-organ diseases are quite limited. rituximab monotherapy seemed poorer than those with PTLD. HHV-6 diseases include encephalitis, interstitial lung disease and delayed engraftment. treatment of HHV-8 diseases after allo-HSCT is based on case reports. antigen detection has a good specificity and a short turn-around time of several hours. PCR for detection of virus nucleic acid is preferred in diagnosis. infection control is the mainstay of prevention against CARVs disease. healthcare facilities and infection control measures should be applied to HSCT recipient [26,168] the effective rate of aerosolized ribavirin therapy was 100% in the treatment of upper tract infections. only 25% of patients with PIV pneumonia survived [166]. influenza vaccine should be performed in HSCT recipients with seasonal influenza vaccine. adenovirus infection may arise from either reactivation of latent virus or acquisition from community. the incidence of adenovirus infection ranges from 0-6% in adult allo-HSCT recipients. half of these patients developed adenovirus-associated diseases [18,22] rotavirus and norovirus are important pathogens of viral gastroenteritis. the incidence of rotavirus infection is 6.7-11.5% in HSCT recipients. death is rare; norovirus as a cause of gastroenteritis is not well recognized. polyomaviruses JC virus (JVC) is known a pathogen of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. reports of PML are quite rare in the recipients of allo-HSCT. treatment and prevention of JCV in HSCT recipients remain unclear. HSV-1 infection is more common than HSV-2. after primary infection, the virus becomes latent in the neuronal cells. 80% of the healthy population have history of HSV-1 and 2 infections. VZV immunization is advocated in recipients without a history of varicella. vaccine has been shown to be safe in children with leukemia. but few data are available in transplant recipients. majority of CMV infections are caused by reactivation of virus which usually occurs within 3 months post-transplantation [8,24,78] preemptive therapy based on CMV antigenemia significantly reduces the development of CMV disease in allo-HSCT patients. mortality of CMV disease is more than 50% even with treatments [67,124] CMV-specific CTL has been used in prophylaxis and treatment of CMV viremia. the response rate of CMV-specific CTL was 73.9% in the treatment of CMV diseases after allo-HSCT. PTLD is most common among the recipients of allo-HSCT. preemptive therapy is developing in two directions: adoptive cellular therapy (EBV-specific CTL) and B-cell depletion with monoclonal antibodies. rituximab is recommended as preferred preemptive therapy, followed by reduction of immunosuppresants and EBV-specific CTL in the european guidelines. the response rate of rituximab monotherapy was reported 44-69%. the relapse rate was 18-32% [141-144] compared with rituximab, adoptive cellular immunotherapy has higher response rate (50-88%) and fewer relapse (0%). rituximab seems efficacious to treat EBV fever, with a response rate of 100%. clinical data on EBV fever and end-organ diseases are quite limited. HHV-6 diseases include encephalitis, interstitial lung disease and delayed engraftment. HHV-8 infection is rare in allo-HSCT recipients. it usually results in non-malignant diseases such as hepatitis, bone marrow suppression and encephalitis. 80% of the healthy population have history of HSV-1 and 2 infections. VZV Varicella caused by primary VZV infection is a common childhood disease. after primary infection, VZV establishes latency in the dorsal root ganglia in immunocompetent host. majority of CMV infections are caused by reactivation of virus which usually occurs within 3 months post-transplantation [8,24,78] preemptive therapy based on CMV antigen (pp65) detection significantly reduces the development of CMV disease in allo-HSCT patients. cidofovir and foscarnet are used as second-line therapy of CMV diseases. resistance is uncommon and usually mediated through mutations in the UL97 gene. CMV-specific CTL has been used in several studies. preemptive therapy is now developing in two directions: adoptive cellular therapy (EBV-specific CTL) and B-cell depletion with monoclonal antibodies. rituximab is easily available and has shown little toxicity. monoclonal antibody (rituximab) is used to clear EBV-infected B cells. rituximab is a recommendation of highest priority for treatment of PTLD. other first-line treatment includes reducing immunosuppressants, EBV-CTL and DLI. clinical data on EBV fever and end-organ diseases are quite limited. rituximab monotherapy in patients with end-organ diseases seemed poorer than PTLD. HHV-6 diseases include encephalitis, interstitial lung disease and delayed engraftment. HHV-8 is recognized the cause of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients [158], and usually results in non-malignant diseases such as hepatitis, bone marrow suppression [159,160]. clinical data on prevention and treatment of HHV-8 diseases after allo-HSCT are based on case reports. infection control is the mainstay of prevention against CARVs disease. infection control is the mainstay of prevention against CARVs disease. a large-sampled retrospective analysis suggested that aerosolized ribavirin with or without intravenous immunoglobulin did not improve the outcome of PIV pneumonia. the effective rate of aerosolized ribavirin therapy was 100% in the treatment of upper tract infections, whereas only 25% of patients with PIV pneumonia survived [166]. there are no recommendations on prophylaxis and treatment due to absence of effective antiviral agents and clinical trials. there are no recommendations on prophylaxis and treatment due to absence of effective antiviral agents and appropriate clinical trials. oseltamivir is the most widely used therapeutic agent for influenza. adenovirus is increasingly recognized as an important pathogen in immunocompromised individuals. adenovirus may arise from either reactivation of latent virus or acquisition from community. incidence of adenovirus infection ranges from 0-6% in adult allo-HSCT recipients. mortality was reported as high as 100% in adenovirus pneumonia [39] and 61% in disseminated disease [181]. PCR is the standard diagnostic method of adenovirus infection. norovirus as a cause of gastroenteritis after allo-HSCT is not well recognized. the incidence of norovirus-associated gastroenteritis was reported 12.9%. no norovirus-associated mortality was observed. treatment and prevention of JCV in HSCT recipients remain unclear. ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones may be useful to prevent HC reactivation. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
