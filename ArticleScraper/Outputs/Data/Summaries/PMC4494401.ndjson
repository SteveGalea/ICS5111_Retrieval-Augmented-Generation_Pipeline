{"summary": "report from the software system a were compared to data collected manually. this showed that data currently collected were not useful for tracking URI frequency and risk factors. but potential exists to increase the practicality and usefulness of this shelter software system to monitor URI. 3% of inventory reports were complete and of these 99% were accurate. the accuracy of the software system\u2019s age reports was 76%. the predictive value of the URI status in the software system a was below 60% both for positive and negative URI diagnosis. research methods employed to date for tracking URI in shelter cats have been prohibitively time intensive to permit routine use on an ongoing basis. resources for record-keeping in animal shelters are often limited and shelter managers may be uncertain as to what data are most pertinent. an open admission animal shelter admitted approximately 10,000 animals annually, of which approximately 50% were cats. at the time of the study the shelter staff had been using the software system a for six years. the majority of the staff reported that they had received limited training in the use of the program. data points were collected by observer. age and URI data were not collected. URI diagnosis entered into the software system a. results Two hundred and sixty cats and kittens were admitted to the shelter during the observation period. an additional 108 cats were already present in the shelter at the start of the study. a total of 317 cats were observed during the study period. intake data generated from the software system a were 77% complete (199/260 cats) when compared to observer collected data. the inaccurate records included cats with an incorrect intake date or incorrect location. the data could have been considered as 92% complete (292/317) the overall agreement between the observer and the software system a for URI diagnosis was only 59%. two hundred and twenty three cats were assigned a positive or negative URI diagnosis by the observer; another 92 cats were hiding and could not be evaluated. data collection and entry in animal shelters can pose particular challenges. limited resources, lack of training and knowledge among shelter staff and high staff turnover are not uncommon at many shelters. the most likely explanation for these reports being of high quality is that they were audited daily during inventory rounds by animal care technicians. the intake reports provide the date of admission for each animal and form the basis of other reports including days until diagnosis of URI and length of stay. the appearance of adult canine teeth is expected to occur at approximately five months of age. this provides a practical and readily observed indicator for shelter staff to determine a cutoff point between age groups. this was used as the definition of kitten versus adults in this study. vaccination against common respiratory agents, including feline herpesvirus and feline calicivirus, does not provide sterile protection against infection. it is generally recommended that animals be vaccinated immediately on intake to the shelter. both vaccination status and vaccination date reports were evaluated in this study. disease associated with stress and overcrowding is a problem best approached from a population medicine perspective with prevention as the goal. the shelter had 61 cats (19%) observed with signs of URI. this resulted in 21% of the total cat care days being spent caring for cats and kittens with URI. time until onset of URI may indicate change in pathogen/s. time until recovery is useful additional information to track in herd health settings. time until recovery is a potential indicator of severity of disease. population health monitoring is essential for managing endemic shelter animal diseases such as feline URI. the data entered into the software system a contained inaccurate data for intake date, intake age, vaccination status, vaccination date, vaccination date and URI recovery date."}
