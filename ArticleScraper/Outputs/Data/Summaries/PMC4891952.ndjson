{"summary": "the epidemiology of respiratory virus infections among hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients and patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy closely parallels the occurrence of infections in the community. infections in immunocompromised hosts are notable for prolonged viral shedding, higher rates of pneumonia and late airflow obstruction. respiratory viruses range from 15% to 40%. mortality-associated risk factors include stem cell source, oxygen requirement, high-dose steroid use, and APACHE II score. prolonged shedding may result in continued risk for virus transmission. case 2 A 77-year-old female presented to the emergency room with 3 days of fever and upper respiratory symptoms, 1 day of shortness of breath and a new oxygen requirement (5 L/min via nasal cannula) the patient had chronic GVHD treated with prednisone (0.5 mg/kg per day) and sirolimus. a nasal swab was positive for RSV with a CT of 27.2. PCR is rapid, sensitive, and specific and can potentially quantify viral load. in the cases presented, CT values are inversely related to viral load. detecting virus in the lower respiratory tract is associated with poorer outcome. retrospective studies have identified ribavirin in any form as protective against disease progression from URTI to LRTI and mortality in HCT recipients. ribavirin showed promising results in smaller case series28,29 and in a larger study of patients receiving chemotherapy or transplant. the patient presented late (>5 years) after transplantation, and the benefit of treatment (including ribavirin) is poorly studied in the late period. the additional benefit of immunoglobulin products remains controversial. available NAIs in the united states include oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, and IV peramivir. many mutations causing oseltamivir and peramivir resistance do not lead to zanamivir resistance46; inhaled zanamivir has been used to treat resistant strains. a randomized trial is comparing triple-combination antiviral therapy with oseltamivir alone in high-risk adults. ribavirin had no impact on viral shedding, symptom and hospitalization length, progression to LRTI, or mortality in patients with PIV. the impact of IVIG alone remains to be determined, although IVIG in PIV LRTI cases did not reduce mortality. the use of IVIG has not been evaluated and is not recommended. the patient was presumed to have HRV LRTI given the clinical circumstances. however, no specific therapies directed at HRV could be offered. care Coronavirus Infection Control procedures Isolation Isolation \u2022 Supportive care Bocavirus Infection control procedures Isolation \u2022 Isolation \u2022 Supportive care Recommendations from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Washington, and Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital. restrictions have been put in place for the use of aerosolized ribavirin. our current practice is to perform respiratory viral diagnostics on all symptomatic HCT candidates and recommend delay of transplantation if feasible. in pediatric patients, diagnostic PCR is done on all transplant candidates regardless of symptoms due to higher rates of virus acquisition and shedding in children. low doses of steroids (1 mg/kg per day) may not significantly impact progression to LRTI and/or mortality. if steroids had been initiated, without specific data on HRV, we would recommend lowering the dose to 1 mg/kg per day. ribavirin in any form is protective against disease progression from URTI to LRTI and mortality in HCT recipients. a pooled analysis has identified ribavirin in any form as protective against disease progression from URTI to LRTI. however, conclusive proof of efficacy from randomized trials remains elusive. the patient in case 2 would have moderate risk of LRTI and mortality. the benefit of treatment (including ribavirin) is poorly studied in the late period. the additional benefit of immunoglobulin products remains controversial. available NAIs in the united states include oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, and IV peramivir. many mutations causing oseltamivir and peramivir resistance do not lead to zanamivir resistance46; inhaled zanamivir has been used to treat resistant strains. a randomized trial is comparing triple-combination antiviral therapy with oseltamivir alone in high-risk adults. a randomized trial in hospitalized patients using oseltamivir showed poorer outcomes than with monotherapy oseltamivir. ribavirin had no impact on viral shedding, symptom and hospitalization length, progression to LRTI or mortality in patients with PIV. the use of IVIG has not been evaluated and is not recommended. the patient was presumed to have HRV LRTI given the clinical circumstances. however, no specific therapies directed at HRV could be offered. restrictions have been put in place for the use of aerosolized ribavirin. benefits and dosing of oral ribavirin in pediatric patients is not clearly understood. HBoV cases in this study were too small to determine an effect. our current practice is to perform respiratory viral diagnostics on all symptomatic HCT candidates and recommend delay of transplantation if feasible. low doses of steroids (1 mg/kg per day) may not significantly impact progression to LRTI and/or mortality. if steroids had been initiated, without specific data on HRV, we would recommend lowering the dose to 1 mg/kg per day. guidelines for HCT recipients recommend appropriate isolation be maintained for at least the duration of clinical illness, hospitalization, or viral shedding to prevent transmission. influenza vaccination Inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) is recommended for all patients 6 months of age with hematologic malignancies. pretransplant vaccination may be appropriate in reduced-intensity HCT, where host immunity is expected to extend into the early transplant period. 87-89 Influenza vaccination is also recommended for all family members, close contacts, and health care workers caring for immunocompromised patients. patients with suspected respiratory viral infections should be empirically placed on contact plus droplet precautions and diagnostic testing promptly initiated. symptomatic health care workers should be restricted from patient contact and symptomatic visitors should be actively excluded from visitation until symptoms are resolved. LAIV is not recommended for household contacts of HCT recipients 2 months posttransplant or with severe immunosuppression due to GVHD. chemoprophylaxis with NAIs should be considered in immunosuppressed patients who are in close contact with confirmed influenza cases or during influenza outbreaks. palivizumab is approved for prevention of RSV bronchiolitis in high-risk immunocompetent infants (age 2 years).95 Palivizumab may be considered in pediatric HCT recipients 2 years during RSV season; prophylaxis is not indicated in older children or adults. novel therapies Antivirals Several antivirals are in development for treatment of RSV infection. a randomized trial comparing efficacy to oseltamivir is nearing completion. a phase 2 randomized trial of laninamivir octanoate demonstrated good safety and a reduction in viral load112. a randomized trial comparing efficacy to oseltamivir is underway. antibody-based therapy High-titer RSV immunoglobulin was evaluated in phase 2 trials in immunocompromised adults with RSV URTI and LRTI135,136. further study is needed to determine efficacy. several monoclonals are under investigation for influenza with and without concomitant oseltamivir. antivirals Several antivirals are in development for treatment of RSV infection, including in immunocompromised patients and infants. ALS-8176, a nucleoside analog targeting RSV polymerase, demonstrated reduction of viral load and clinical severity in phase 1 studies. a phase 2 randomized trial of DAS181 in immunocompromised hosts with PIV LRTI is underway. no data for immunocompromised hosts exist; no data for immunocompromised hosts exist. several agents have shown efficacy against HRV and enteroviruses. several monoclonals are under investigation for influenza with and without concomitant oseltamivir. 140-143 IV hyperimmune immunoglobulin increased hemagglutination inhibition antibody responses. a phase 3 trial is underway. validation of proposed severity scores, identification of laboratory biomarkers for progressive disease, and more data on the impact of pretransplant infections are critically important for respiratory viruses. development of new therapeutics and vaccines and systematic evaluation of new and existing treatments are needed."}
