{"summary": "multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MPCR) has improved the diagnostic yield of pathogens and it is easier to identify the co-infections also. atotal of 177 BAL specimens collected over a 19 months period were analyzed with the MPCR and aerobic culture. the immunocompromised patients are more prone to various infections. respiratory complications are the most common because lungs can be a portal of entry for wide range of microorganisms. multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MPCR) may not only facilitate the optimal clinical management of immunocompromised patients but also prevent their transmission. a total of 177 patients were considered for evaluation. following pathogens were detected; flu A, B, and C; parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3, and 4; corona virus NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1; hMPV A and B rhinovirus, RSVs A and B; bocavirus; CMV, P. jirovecii, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococc 177 patients were considered for evaluation. PCR was done with the commercial multiplex FTD Respiratory pathogens 33 Kit. quantitative characteristics for each of the four groups were analyzed by mean and standard deviation. comparison among the four categories was made by one-way ANOVA and Chi-square tests. RESULTS Patient characteristics Of the 177 immunocompromised patients admitted during the study. n = 18, monomicrobial 5 and polymicrobial 13) of patients. most frequent mixed infection seen was CMV + P. jirovecii + K. pneumoniae. 61 (34.5%) were suffering from end-stage renal disease. 42 (23.7%) had undergone transplantation. 39 (22%) had neoplastic disease, 15 (8.5%) had autoimmune disease, and 20 (11%) were receiving immunosuppressive therapy for some other reasons. cytomegalovirus deoxyribonucleic acid in bronchoalveolar lavage and blood samples of 22 patients (Qiagen) 19 (86.3%) were positive for CMV DNA in blood sample with a mean of 575650 DNA copies/ml. no significant difference were found in age, gender, ICU admission, preexisting lung disease, days of symptoms, predisposing immunocompromised condition. if MPCR is routinely implemented in the diagnostic protocol of respiratory illness in immunocompromised patients, causative pathogen will be identified in significantly higher number of patients. baudel et al. showed similar type of results where MPCR was positive in 66%, and culture was positive in only 40% of patients. flu A, corona virus, RSV, AdV, bocavirus, enterovirus, and hMPV have been reported as an important cause of respiratory illness in immunocompromised patients. if done in clinically suspected immunocompromised patients, it is most sensitive and rapid method. a variable range from 14% to 38% has been reported in the previous studies. this is in concordance with several published studies. previous studies have shown the variable outcome among patients with mixed infections. viruses were detected in 28.8% of cases. it is in line with previous studies where prevalence of viruses in BAL has been reported from 3.6% to 68.2%. PCR is not confirmatory as it can represent either viral shedding or pulmonary disease. if done in clinically suspected immunocompromised patients, it is most sensitive and rapid method. this is the first study to evaluate the outcome of mixed infection in immunocompromised patients. results of the present study demonstrate that viruses and atypical pathogens can be significant respiratory pathogens."}
