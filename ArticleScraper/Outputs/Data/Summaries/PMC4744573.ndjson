{"summary": "the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of viral transcripts often contains identifiable domains that play key roles in facilitating both local and long range structural interactions of the RNA. local structures in the 3\u2032 UTR can serve a variety of functions, including influencing the formation of binding sites for regulatory proteins. miRNA sites can also be engineered into 3\u2032 UTRs to regulate virus gene expression on a cell-specific basis. it should not be overlooked that the 3\u2032 UTR also contains important and often highly conserved promoter elements that aid in viral polymerase binding and replication. lncRNAs are arbitrarily defined as non-coding transcripts >200 nucleotides in length. viruses have developed ways to usurp cellular lncRNAs to promote dysregulation of cellular functions to enhance viral infections. viruses have developed ways to usurp cellular lncRNAs \u2013 or make some of their own (Tycowski et al., 2015) flaviviral lncRNAs are generated via stalling of a cellular RNA decay enzyme Transcription is not the sole way to regulate gene expression in eukaryotic cells. degradation of cellular RNAs plays a significant role in regulating both the level of mRNAs as well as quality-controlling gene expression to remove unwanted or deleterious transcripts. deadenylated transcripts can be removed by 3\u2032-5\u2032 decay mediated by the cytoplasmic exosome or Dis3L2. degradation of mRNAs is generally initiated by deadenylation via the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex. this decapped mRNA is then rapidly and processively degraded by the 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonuclease Xrn1. flaviviruses generate subgenomic flavivirus RNAs using the cellular RNA decay machinery. the Xrn1 5\u2032-3\u2032 exoribonuclease stalls on RNA structures and creates stable RNA decay intermediates that accumulate to high levels in infected cells. it is very rare to observe intermediates in RNA decay pathways. the large C-terminal portion of Xrn1 is likely rather flexible and has not yet been crystallized. Xrn1 has also been recently implicated in the yeast S. cerevisiae as a key player in feeding back information on RNA decay to the nucleus. panel A. Xrn1-mediated exonucleolytic decay of the positive sense genomic RNA of flaviviruses generates a set of sfRNAs from the 3\u2032 UTR. panel B. Xrn1-mediated exonucleolytic decay of the positive sense genomic RNA of the flaviviruses generates a set of sfRNAs from the 3\u2032 UTR. Xrn1 is a highly processive exoribonuclease that appears to rarely, if ever, stall while degrading cellular mRNAs. the addition of poly(G) tracts to reporter RNAs was instrumental in trapping mRNA decay intermediates to map decay pathways in S. cerevisiae (Muhlrad et al., 1994) RNA crystallization studies of a 68 base fragment of the 3\u2032 UTR region of Murray Valley Encephalitis virus provided a clear picture of the novel structure involved in Xrn1 stalling. the RNA forms a three-helix junction comprised of interwoven pseudoknots with the 5\u2032 end of the RNA passing through the ring-like structure that is formed. this knot-like structure would be impervious to unwinding by an enzyme moving in the 5\u2032 the HCV IRES has been shown to contain a conserved pseudoknot involving the IIIf stem along with domain IV that contains the AUG start codon. mutational analyses using compensatory mutations produced conflicting results. this could imply that the structure is more complex than a simple pseudoknot. a cold competitor RNA containing the three-helix junction structure failed to affect Xrn1 activity in these assays. an increase in the level of uncapped mRNA was detected in a number of flavivirus-infected cells. this provides in cellulo evidence for Xrn1 repression. Xrn1 stalls at knot-like RNA structures while degrading flavivirus transcripts. the enzyme remains associated with the flaviviral RNA decay intermediate. repression of Xrn1 activity in cells would be expected to result in accumulation of decapped mRNAs. cellular mRNAs that are normally regulated by degradation accumulate in cells. the impact on normally short-lived mRNAs is, as expected, the greatest and most significant. generation of sf/xrRNAs may be a major factor in pathogenesis. sfRNAs are only generated from the 3\u2032 UTR of arthropod-borne flaviviruses. sfRNA serves as a mild repressor of RNAi responses in insect and mammalian cells. sfRNA may shut down the RNAi response just enough for the virus to replicate to sufficient levels in the insect. a recent study of a deNV-2 clade variant (PR-2B) with significantly increased fitness contained three nucleotide variations in and around the pseudoknot structures that stall and repress Xrn1. sfRNA was shown to interact with tripartite motif 25 (TRIM25), a key protein involved in regulating RIG-I-induced type-I interferon expression. potential relationship between miR-122 and Xrn1 stalling on the HCV 5' UTR miR-122 is highly expressed small RNA in liver cells and naturally regulates cellular genes at the post-transcriptional level. miR-122 binding to two sites at the 5\u2032 end of HCV genomic RNA is very important (but not absolutely essential) for viral replication. miR-122 binding prevents access of the cellular Xrn1 decay enzyme to the RNA and reduces the amount of RNA available for translation. the two independent miR-122 binding sites contribute to protection from Xrn1, albeit in an unequal fashion. in the presence of miR-122, the 5\u2032 end of the viral genomic RNA is effectively sealed by the RNA secondary structures/protein factors brought in by the binding of the miRNA to site 1 and site 2 near the 5\u2032 end. this produces a substantial pool of intact viral genomic RNA for efficient replication. formal testing of several aspects of this model await future experimentation. sfRNA/xrRNAs may serve as trans-regulators of viral replication directly by influencing long-range interactions of the ends of the viral genome. sfRNA/xrRNA function can also serve as a basis for discovery of cellular lncRNA function. Coronaviruses contain a highly conserved pseudoknot structure in the 3\u2032 UTR. they contain well-characterized IRES elements in their 5\u2032 UTRs. this knowledge can open up the doors to new therapeutic targets for the development of effective broad-spectrum antivirals."}
