{"summary": "scientific Knowledge on the Subject Optimal methods to titrate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) remain an active area of controversy in the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) a PEEP/FiO2 protocol inspired by the ARDS Network has been used in a variety of clinical trials, many intensive care practitioners use less PEEP and higher FiO2 than this protocol. two of the datasets were gathered retrospectively by reviewing the electronic health records of pediatric ICU (PICU) patients admitted to Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) from 2000 to 2007 (15) and 2009 to 2013 (16) one dataset was gathered prospectively from patients admitted to the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) from 2011 to 2016 (17, 18) a patient on 0.6 FiO2 recommends a PEEP of 10 cm H2O. a composite variable deemed \"low PEEP\" was categorized for patients with PEEP below protocol for a given FiO2. PICU mortality was the primary outcome. the primary objective was to evaluate whether patients managed with lower PEEP for a given FiO2 had higher mortality than patients managed with PEEP in line with or higher than recommended from ARDSNet. retaining variables that were either associated with PICU mortality or resulted in a greater than 15% change in the parameter estimates for PEEP lower than the protocol. a propensity score was created to model clinical and severity-of-illness factors associated with PEEP lower than the protocol. hypoxemia for the PARDS definition was based on oxygenation index (OI) greater than or equal to 4 or oxygen saturation index greater than or equal to 5. all patients had a PARDS trigger (i.e., pneumonia, sepsis), with pulmonary parenchymal disease on chest radiograph. clinical PEEP = 6 cm H2O, ARDSNet PEEP allowed 8\u201310 cm H2O, PEEP discordance score = 6 8 = 2 cm H2O. a composite variable deemed \u201clow PEEP\u201d was categorized for patients with PEEP below protocol for a given FiO2. secondary objectives were to determine whether this relationship was consistent among all datasets and whether it was modified by variables that may affect PEEP choice. we then explored factors that may be associated with PICU mortality or PEEP lower than recommended by the protocol for a given FiO2. analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation), Statistica version 12 (StatSoft), and Stata version 10 (StataCorp).

PEEP at CHOP follows a near-normal distribution, whereas PEEP at CHLA has more variability. CHOP used PEEP lower than protocol only 12.4% of the time. all variables are scaled to a maximum value of 1 for each variable. for all patients, CHOP generally used a higher mean airway pressure (PAW), higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and slightly lower FiO2 than CHLA, with slightly higher PF ratio and oxygenation index (OI) high-frequency oscillatory ventilation was the first NCV mode used at CHLA in all patients. on a univariate basis in both institutions, PEEP lower than protocol on day 1 was associated with higher mortality. ARDSNet = ARDS Network; CI = confidence interval; PEEP = positive end-expiratory pressure; PF = PaO2/FiO2; PRISM = Pediatric Risk of Mortality. PEEP lower than recommended by ARDSNet protocol for a given FiO2 remains independently associated with mortality. sensitivity analysis highlights the relationship between PEEP lower than the protocol and mortality is most relevant in the CHLA data. only 12% of patients have PEEP levels lower than recommended by the protocol at CHOP, compared with 40% at CHLA. CHOP included only patients with bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging. radiologist, intensivist, multiple practitioners, and timing of the films. mortality was lower at CHOP than CHLA. patients with hyperoxia (i.e., PaO2 > 100 mm Hg) had higher mortality than those with more normal PaO2 (60\u2013100 mm Hg, Table 1). this finding did not hold in multivariable modeling. but it provides indirect evidence of ill effects of high concentrations of oxygen. there are no clear data that demonstrate that PEEP matters in PARDS. the ARDSNet PEEP/FiO2 table for PARDS is suboptimal in PARDS. a more individualized approach using transpulmonary pressure, lung compliance, dead space, or other methods have strong theoretical advantages (5, 6, 28\u201334) however, our data do highlight that there may be problems with usual care PEEP management in PARDS. there is potential selection bias on the basis of individual practices for arterial line placement and potential differences on the basis of bilateral versus unilateral infiltrates. a well-designed randomized control trial targeting PEEP management in PARDS is needed."}
