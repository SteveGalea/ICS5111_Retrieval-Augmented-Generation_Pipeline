{"summary": "influenza surveillance is carried out in Guangdong province, southern china. a better understanding of influenza seasonality and predominant Subtypes of influenza virus can help to improve evidence-based prevention and control strategies for influenza in the future. influenza in some tropical countries circulates year round with peaks in rainy season (13-15), while some others have two distinct influenza seasons in winter/spring and summer months within a year. influenza activity in Guangdong province tends to have neither winter peak nor bimodal mode within a year. the incidence of influenza was estimated to be 4 to 20 per 1,000 populations in the province. a different and complex seasonality will complicate local annual vaccination campaign. it is necessary to study the seasonal characteristics of influenza activity in Guangdong province. ILI Outpatient Surveillance is defined as a fever (Body temperature 38 \u00b0C) with a cough and/or a sore throat, and the absence of other diagnoses. in all 28 sentinel hospitals, physicians record the number of outpatients they treated each day. the weekly percentages of ILI outpatients can be calculated automatically. if Outbreaks occur within 7 days in a small unit, local CDCs are required to report to Guangdong CDC through the national Influenza Surveillance Information System in 24 hours. at least 10 respiratory samples of affected ILI cases are required to be collected and test for influenza virus. ILI Outpatient Surveillance is defined as a fever (Body temperature 38 \u00b0C) with a cough and /or a sore throat. in all 28 sentinel hospitals, doctors record the number of outpatients they treated each day. the weekly percentages of ILI outpatients can be calculated automatically. if Outbreaks (15 ILI cases affected or above within 7 days in a small unit, like community, school, nursing house, etc.) occur and are detected, local CDCs are required to report to Guangdong CDC through the National Influenza Surveillance Information System in 24 hours. we used median, minimum and maximum (peak) value with their appearing time to describe the annual level of ILI epidemic. we applied spectral analysis and built a logistic regression model to fit and set a warning line for the time series of weekly ILI visiting percentage in Guangdong. data collection All data used in this paper are from the National Influenza Surveillance Information System and provided by Guangdong CDC. the surveillance week starts on Monday and ends on Sunday. there are 469 weekly data in total, from the 1st week in 2004 to the 52nd week in 2012. we take the fitted values as a baseline of weekly ILI percentage. peak month was identified as the month with the maximum number of strains isolated within a calendar year. peaks occurred at least 3 months apart within the same calendar year. from 2004 to 2008, patient visits for ILI peaked at 9-10%. one was detected in July causing by seasonal influenza. the other affected by the pandemic shown in November 2009, with a peak value of 7%. the weekly ILI epidemic in Guangdong displayed strong annual periodicity. the ILI visiting level had a strong annual unimodal cycle between 2004 and 2008. it was bimodal in 2009 because of the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. the provincial average level of patient visits to sentinel hospitals varied remarkably every year. from 2004 to 2008, patient visits for ILI peaked at 9-10%. since the H1N1 influenza pandemic arrived in 2009, Guangdong had two separate ILI peaks this year. the weekly ILI epidemic in Guangdong displayed strong annual periodicity. the ILI visiting level had a strong annual unimodal cycle between 2004 and 2008. the ILI surveillance data peaked sharply and unusually in November 2009, far beyond the thresholds. influenza A (H1N1), A (H3N2), A (H1N1) pdm09 (a novel subtype identified in influenza pandemic 2009) and influenza B. 107115 respiratory specimens of ILI outpatients were collected from 2004 through 2012, 16.29% of them tested for influenza virus were positive. influenza peaks in 6 of 9 years came in summer months in Guangdong, from April to September. the longest epidemic duration for influenza virus isolated was 7 months (in 2004 and 2010) the longest epidemic duration for influenza virus isolated was 7 months (in 2004 and 2010) and the shortest one was 3 months (in 2011). ILI is essentially a type of syndromic surveillance (26). the temporal trends normally reflect the actual influenza activity in epidemic seasons (8,9). the time series of ILI visiting percentage in Guangdong showed a clear and strong seasonal pattern. the same virus subtype never predominated during more than two consecutive calendar years from 2004 through 2012. the displacement of one subtype with another was gradual overall. the dynamic patterns of influenza virus activity in Guangdong had some differences. influenza virus activity in 2010 and 2012 tended to present a bimodal seasonality more clearly, with two distinct peaks in spring and summer respectively. seasonal influenza outbreaks in Guangdong normally concentrated in spring and summer, which coincide partly with influenza virus activity peaks. study used aggregate data to measure influenza activity and explore seasonal periodicity on a provincial scale. the overall dynamic pattern may not fit those in different parts of the province."}
