{"summary": "human enterovirus 71 (HEV71) is one of the member in HEV-A species of Enterovius genus in the family Picornaviridae. the viral genome contains a single-stranded positive-sense RNA of approximately 7400 nucleotides. the viral genome contains a 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) which are essential for viral RNA replication. a total of 6,049 HFMD cases were reported from local healthcare facility in Fuyang city. 3,023 (50%) were hospitalized, 353 (6%) were severe and 22 (0.4%) were fatal. the gender ratio of the epidemics was 1.9:1, with 3,938 male and 2,111 female cases. the age ranged from 28 days to 18 years, with 78% of the cases 3 years old. clinical characteristics of 15 out of 22 fatal cases showed that these cases had an acute onset of fever, sore throat, and myalgia (influenza-like illness) but the rash was rare. most hospitalized cases were initially diagnosed as severe pneumonia, some patients died within 1-5 days after onset. AST sequence analysis revealed that all of the sequences had high homology (95.1%) with HEV71. additional 121 more clinical specimens were collected for the detection of HEV71 and CV-A16 using direct RT-PCR. six (46%) of 13 fatal cases, 36 (36%) of 99 severe cases, 17 (44%) of 39 mild cases were positive for HEV71. virus isolates were obtained from clinical specimens: 34 of 132 (26%) throat swabs, 7 of 12 (58%) stool samples, 3 of 4 (75%) vesicular fluid, 3 of 22 (14%) anus swab, 1 of 2 (50%) antemortem oral efflux, and 2 of 23 (9%) autopsy lung tissue. by RT-PCR and sequence determination, 45/50 (90%) of the enteroviruses were identified as HEV71 gram was constructed with 14 representative Fuyang HEV71 isolates. it was selected based on the case classification and nucleotide divergence. the isolates belonged to cluster C4a of the subgenotype C4, similar to the HEV71 sequences isolated from the mainland of china during 2003-2008.
