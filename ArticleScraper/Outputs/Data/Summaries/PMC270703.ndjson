{"summary": "9% of population failed an adrenocorticotrophic hormone stimulation test. 4% had previously undiagnosed pituitary disease and 5% were suffering from sepsis-related adrenal dysfunction. but until we have an established definition for adrenocortical insufficiency in sepsis we will continue to yield disparate results. serum interleukin-6 concentration >1000 pg/ml was best predicted in their population by a bypass time in excess of 97 min and cardiac ejection fraction below 40%. baboons with active site-inactivated factor VII and tissue factor pathway inhibitor at the onset of sepsis attenuates organ injury and is protective for lung and kidney. the ionized portion of serum magnesium varies in the critically ill. the development of reduced levels of ionized magnesium was associated with higher mortality and more severe organ dysfunction. it may be that low levels contribute to critical illness, or just the converse is true is unclear. Choosing the right ventilation strategy for ARDS patients has more benefits than just lung protection. it is not unreasonable to consider that periodic endotracheal suctioning might undermine these benefits. it is not unreasonable to consider that periodic endotracheal suctioning might undermine these benefits. the three inotropes were comparable in moderate shock. dopamine would actually appear to have modest benefits for splanchnic circulation. a larger, truly randomized trial should determine whether they are correct."}
