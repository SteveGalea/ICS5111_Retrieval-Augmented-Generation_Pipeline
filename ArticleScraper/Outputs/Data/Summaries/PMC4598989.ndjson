{"summary": "endoplasmic reticulum (ER2) is responsible for folding, maturation, and trafficking of most secretory and membrane proteins. ER stress occurs when the nascent protein loading exceeds the ER folding capacity under circumstances such as virus infection, gene mutation, calcium flux perturbation, or glucose deprivation. ER stress activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) to suppress general protein synthesis and increase the ER folding capacity. IRE1 is a type I transmembrane protein with both endoribonuclease and kinase activity. the other isoform, IRE1, is found only in the epithelial cells of gastrointestinal track (7) and airway (8). IRE1 also forms a complex with the adaptor protein TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) to activate apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and JNK the mTORC1 complex contains the regulatory-associated protein of mammalian target of rapamycin (Raptor) and proline-rich Akt substrate 40 kDa. the mTORC2 complex also contains the regulatory-associated protein of mammalian target of rapamycin (Raptor) and proline-rich Akt substrate 40 kDa (PRAS40) mTORC1 was activated under ER stress conditions by ER calcium depletion by ER calcium ATPase blockage. TSC1- or TSC2-deficient cells showed increased phosphorylation of S6, IRE1 and JNK. Fyn overexpression activates mTORC1 through inhibition of the LKB1-AMPK pathway. propidium iodide, thapsigargin, and tunicamycin were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. rapamycin for in vivo experiments was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

HEK293T cells were transfected with the empty vector (pcDNA), Fyn wild type (Fyn WT) or Fyn kinase-defective (Fyn KD) forty-eight hours later, the cells were treated with 1 m TG for 4 h. TG increases XBP1 expression but not Bip or Chop mRNA expression. levels of unspliced XBP1 (XBP1u) and spliced XBP1 (XBP1u) were analyzed by semi-quantitative PCR. non-identical letters indicate results statistically different from each other at p 0.05. expression of Fyn KD had no significant morphological features compared with empty vector control-transfected cells. DAPI was pseudocolored as blue, whereas terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) was pseudocolored as green. PI staining demonstrated a lower degree of Fyn-induced cell death in the IRE1 knockdown cells. cells of IRE1 knockdown (IRE1 KD) and control cells (pLKO.1) were transfected by empty vector (pcDNA) or Fyn wild type (Fyn WT) forty-eight hours later, the cells were subjected to Hoechst and PI staining. thirty-two hours after transfection, the cells were treated with or without JNKi (JNKi, 25 m) for 16 h before being subjected to Hoechst and PI staining. the data are presented as mean S.E. Non-identical letters indicate results statistically different from each other at p 0.05. TG induced mTORC1-IRE1 activation in HEK293T cells. hek293T cells were transfected with either empty vector (pcDNA) or Fyn wild type (Fyn). rapamycin did not significantly inhibit the induction of Bip and Chop mRNA. XBP1 (XBP1u) and spliced XBP1 (XBP1u) were analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. these are representative PCR reactions independently performed three times. the data are presented as mean S.E. from three independent experiments. three-week-old wild type (WT) and SKM-Fyn transgenic mice were intraperitoneally injected with vehicle or rapamycin once a day for 4 days. mice were then fasted overnight, and gastrocnemius muscles were isolated. extracts were prepared and subjected to Western blotting against the proteins indicated. Thr-389 is the mTORC1-specific site of S6K phosphorylation, which is the major event promoting S6K activation. mTORC1 activation is shown by increased phosphorylation of S6K at Thr-389 and its downstream S6 phosphorylation. expression of Fyn WT increased IRE1 and JNK phosphorylation as well as that of the mTORC1 substrate S6K. expression of Fyn KD had no significant effect on Bip or Chop mRNA levels. lack of effect on Bip or Chop probably reflects additional presence of ER stress inducers in vivo. HEK293T cells were transfected with the empty vector (pcDNA), Fyn wild type (Fyn WT) or Fyn kinase-defective (Fyn KD) forty-eight hours after transfection, cell extracts were prepared and subject to Western blot for the indicated proteins. expression of Fyn KD had no significant morphological features when compared with empty vector control-transfected cells. cells were treated with Hoechst to visualize condensed nuclei and propidium iodide (PI) to assess cell permeability. PI showed a large increase in permeable cells following acute Fyn WT transfection. ase in HEK293T cells increases TUNEL staining. cells were transfected with empty vector (pcDNA) or Fyn wild type (Fyn WT) forty-eight hours later, the cells were subjected to PI staining. these are representative images from experiments independently performed three times. positive PI-stained cells were quantified from 10 images. the data are presented as mean S.E. Non-identical letters (a, b, and c) indicate results that are statistically different from each other at p 0.05. TG treatment in HEK293T cells showed a large increase in cell detachment. hek293T cells were transfected with the empty vector (pcDNA), Fyn wild type (Fyn WT) or Fyn kinase-defective (Fyn KD) rapamycin suppressed the phosphorylation of IRE1 and JNK. inhibition of IRE1 activation was also observed by the inhibition of XBP1 splicing. however, rapamycin did not significantly inhibit the induction of Bip and Chop mRNA. rapamycin treatment of the SKM-Fyn transgenic mice in vivo protected against the Fyn WT-induced loss of cells. however, rapamycin treatment completely protected against the Fyn WT-induced loss of cells. the data are presented as mean S.E. from four independent experiments. non-identical letters indicate results statistically different from each other at p 0.05. 4EBP1 is another direct mTORC1 substrate that is phosphorylated on multiple sites. in accordance with increased S6K phosphorylation, SKM-Fyn transgenic mice also demonstrated increased and bands with decreased band indicative of mTORC1 activation. wild type (WT) and SKM-Fyn mice at 3 weeks of age were sacrificed after an overnight fast. expression of Fyn WT and expression of Fyn KD had no significant effect. hek293T cells were transfected with and without the Fyn. hek293T cells were treated with TG, a well established ER stress inducer. HEK293T cells were transfected with empty vector (pcDNA), Fyn wild type (Fyn WT) or Fyn kinase-defective (Fyn KD) forty-eight hours later, the cells were treated with 1 m TG for 4 h. HEK293T cells were transfected with the empty vector (pcDNA), Fyn wild type (Fyn WT) or Fyn kinase-defective (Fyn KD) forty-eight hours later, the cells were subjected to Hoechst and PI staining. these are representative images from experiments independently performed three times. the percentage of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT)-positive cells was quantified from 10 images. these data are presented as mean S.E. Non-identical letters (a, b, and c) indicate results statistically different from each other at p 0.01. IRE1 activation leads to cell death through phosphorylation of Bcl-2 family members. treatment of Fyn-transfected cells with a JNK inhibitor resulted in fewer condensed nuclei and PI-positive stained cells. cells were transfected by empty vector (pcDNA and Fyn wild type) TG treatment in cells overexpressing Fyn WT showed a large increase in cell detachment. HEK293T cells were transfected with the empty vector (pcDNA), Fyn wild type (Fyn WT) or Fyn kinase-defective (Fyn KD) forty-eight hours later, cells were treated with 1 m TG for 32 h. hek293T cells were transfected with either the empty vector (pcDNA) or Fyn wild type (Fyn) forty-eight hours later, the cells were treated with 1 m TG with or without 100 nm rapamycin (Rapa) for the indicated times. mRNA levels of unspliced XBP1 (XBP1u) and spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) were analyzed by semi-quantit the data are consistent with a Fyn-induced activation of mTORC1 that drives ER stress-induced cell death, at least partially through IRE1. hek293T cells were transfected with either the empty vector (pcDNA) or Fyn wild type (Fyn) transgenic mice overexpressing Fyn in skeletal muscle resulted in a marked increase of mTORC1 activation (26), which is important in regulation of ER stress-induced cell death (23, 24). the latter could be responsible for the muscle wasting phenotype of SKM-Fyn mice, we examined the effect of Fyn on the indicative markers of three UPR pathways. wild type (WT) and SKM-Fyn mice (Tg) at 3 weeks of age were sacrificed after an overnight fast. p indicates phosphorylated form; p indicates phosphorylated form. mRNA levels of XBP1s, Bip, and Chop were determined by quantitative PCR. HEK293T cells were transfected with and without the Fyn and subsequently treated with TG, a well established ER stress inducer (33). TG induced both Bip and Chop mRNA that were not further increased by the expression of Fyn WT or Fyn KD. mRNA levels of unspliced XBP1 (XBP1u) and spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) (C) were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. mRNA levels of unspliced XBP1 (XBP1u) were analyzed by semi-quantitative PCR. HEK293T cells were transfected with the empty vector (pcDNA), Fyn wild type (Fyn WT) or Fyn kinase-defective (Fyn KD) forty-eight hours later, the cells were subjected to Hoechst and PI staining. these are representative images from experiments independently performed three times. cells of IRE1 knockdown (IRE1 KD) and control cells (pLKO.1) were transfected by empty vector (pcDNA) or Fyn wild type (Fyn WT) forty-eight hours later, the cells were subjected to Hoechst and PI staining. these data are representative images from experiments independently performed three times. inhibition of JNK represses the Fyn overexpression-induced cell death in HEK293T cells. cells were transfected with empty vector (pcDNA) and Fyn wild type (Fyn WT) thirty-two hours after transfection, the cells were treated with or without JNK inhibitor (JNKi, 25 m) for 16 h before being subject to Hoechst and PI staining. the cells were treated with 1 m TG for 32 h. expression of Fyn WT increased IRE1 and JNK phosphorylation. the cells were treated with 1 m TG for 32 h. cell extracts were prepared and subjected to Western blotting against the proteins indicated. p indicates phosphorylated form, and mRNA levels of unspliced XBP1 (XBP1u) and spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) were analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. three-week-old wild type (WT) and SKM-Fyn transgenic mice were intraperitoneally injected with vehicle or rapamycin once a day for 4 days. the mice were then fasted overnight, and gastrocnemius muscles were isolated. several pathways have been identified as stimulating skeletal muscle wasting. these include activation of the atrogin E3 ligase responsible for proteasome-mediated degradation, STAT3 activation during cancer cachexia, and inhibition of macroautophagy (26, 39\u201341). mTORC1 activation and AMPK activation induced ER unfolded response to activate apoptosis (24). mTORC1 activation of UPR has been shown to induce cellular apoptosis (23, 43) however, mTORC1 activation of UPR has been shown to induce cellular apoptosis (23, 43) this suggests the presence of an mTORC1-independent pathway responsible for JNK activation. JNK is a stress-activated kinase and a downstream target of mTORC1 activation that is associated with insulin resistance (47) and aging (34). our data demonstrate that Fyn stimulates JNK activation site phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo."}
