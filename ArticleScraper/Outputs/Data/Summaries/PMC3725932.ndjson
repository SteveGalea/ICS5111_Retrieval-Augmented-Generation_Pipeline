{"summary": "male and female 5-wk-old B-cell deficient B6.129S2-Ighmtm1Cgn/J (Igh), Ifn-deficient B6.129S7-Ifngtm1Ts/J (Ifn), B- and T-cell\u2013deficient B6.129S7-Rag1tm1Mom/J (Rag), CD4-deficient B6.129S2-Cd4tm1Mak/J (CD all animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the Yale IACUC. mice were inoculated orally with 300 infectious doses (ID50; 20 L of a 10% spleen stock in DMEM) of MPV1d. groups of 12 female and 6 male Igh, Ifn, Rag, and B6 mice (index mice) were inoculated at 6 wk of age with MPV1d and were housed as 2 female or 3 male mice per cage. a Swiss Webster mouse was added to each cage of mice (8 cages per mouse genotype) at 2 d after inoculation to allow for direct contact with the infected index mice. male mice were housed singly until all female mice of a given genotype had delivered litters. male mice were euthanized by CO2 overdose, blood was collected for MPV serology, and feces and MLN were collected for MPV PCR analysis. when pups were 1 wk old, cages were changed, and a Swiss Webster mouse was added to each cage for a 2-wk exposure to the dams and pups. individual fecal pellets for MPV PCR analysis were collected biweekly starting at 2 wpi. one Swiss Webster mouse was added to each index mouse at 1 wpi. contact sentinels were housed singly in clean cages for 2 additional weeks. blood was collected for MPV serology. mice were seronegative for ectromelia virus, murine rotavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, mouse hepatitis virus, MPV, minute virus of mice, murine norovirus, pneumonia virus of mice, reovirus, Sendai virus, and mycoplasma pulmonis. mice were housed in individually ventilated cages (ACE MicroVent, Allentown, NJ) mice were inoculated orally with 300 infectious doses (ID50; 20 L of a 10% spleen stock in DMEM) of MPV1d. blood was collected from all mice by cardiocentesis after CO2 overdose. sera were tested for antibodies to mouse parvovirus. feces were collected from each index mouse at 1 wpi and then biweekly starting at 2 wpi for MPV PCR analysis. one Swiss Webster mouse (contact sentinel) was added to each cage of mice (8 cages per mouse genotype) at 2 d after inoculation to allow for direct contact with the infected index mice for 12 d. contact sentinels were housed singly in clean cages for an additional 2 wk to allow for se a Swiss Webster mouse (litter contact sentinel) was added to each cage for a 2-wk exposure to the dams and pups. these sentinels then were housed singly in clean cages for 2 weeks. feces and MLN were collected for MPV PCR analysis. at 10 wpi for CD8, TCR, and B6 mice and 12 wpi for CD4 mice. index mice were euthanized by CO2 overdose, blood was collected for MPV serology. feces and MLN were collected for MPV PCR analysis. median levels of MPV DNA in the immunodeficient genotypes were at least 6-fold higher than those in B6 mice. from 6 to 18 wpi, feces from all Rag mice were positive for MPV DNA. shedding resumed in 1 or 2 mice at 14, 16, and 18 wpi. MPV was transmitted to the majority (75%) of sentinels in contact with Ifn mice through 2 wpi but not at any later time points. transmission from B6 and Ifn mice appeared to differ between 2 and 4 wpi. by 12 wpi, transmission appeared to have ceased, but transmission was detected again in a single cage at 14 and 16 wpi. the percentage of sentinels that had been in contact with Rag mice became MPV-seropositive was significantly (P 0.0002) higher than that of B6 mice starting at 4, 6, and 8 wpi. the percentage of sentinels that had been in contact with Rag mice became MPV-seropositive was significantly (P 0.0002) higher than that of Ifn mice starting at 4 wpi until 10 wpi. the pups in the B6 and Ifn litters were seropositive due to transfer of maternal antibody. none of the litters of Igh mice were seroconverted to MPV. contact sentinel serology at 16 wpi indicated transmission had recommenced. 0/6 Igh 16 0/6 2/6 1/6 a No. of mice positive for MPV/no. at the time of necropsy, most B6 mice and Ifn mice were seropositive. none of the B-cell\u2013deficient Rag mice seroconverted to MPV. 10 7/10 0/10 7/10 CD4 12 4/9 0/10 8/10 CD8 10 6/9 0/10 7/10 TCR 10 0/10 0/10 6/10 a No. of mice positive for MPV/ no. of mice tested To determine the duration of MPV shedding and transmission from T cell deficient mice. PCR analysis of feces collected at 1 wpi revealed 60% to 100% of B6 mice were shedding MPV. TCR mice were necropsied at 10 wpi and CD4 mice were necropsied 12 wpi. at the time of necropsy, 44% to 70% of B6, CD4 and CD8 mice and none of the TCR mice had seroconverted to MPV. MLN from the majority of B6, CD4, CD8, and TCR mice were positive for MPV DNA at 10 to 12 wpi. the profound susceptibility of the Rag mice, despite the natural resistance afforded by the B6 background, was not unexpected. Combined B- and T-cell deficiency on either the of these backgrounds greatly increased the duration and robustness of MPV infection. the difference between Rag and Igh mice was that peak MPV shedding in Igh mice occurred earlier (during the first 2 wk) shedding from Igh mice tapered, with sporadic shedding from only a few mice after 6 wpi. in 2 cages, MPV DNA was not detected in feces for 12 to 14 wk. retrospective analysis of contact sentinels exposed to Igh mice at 14 and 16 wpi revealed that a few mice had resumed MPV shedding at levels sufficient to infect the sentinel mice. a few mice had resumed MPV shedding at levels sufficient to infect the sentinel mice and 2 litters of Igh mice. in the jejunum, Igh mice have increased intraepithelial CD8+ T cells. Igh, SCID, and Rag mice have accelerated intestinal epithelia cell turnover. there is a substantial risk that detection of MPV infection can be missed if only a single fecal sample is tested. hepatic necrosis, necrotizing gastrointestinal tract lesions, acute peritonitis and pleuritis with adhesions on the serosal surface of the viscera. ifn receptor-deficient mice maintained higher loads of murine polyomavirus in the kidney and had higher tumor incidence than did B6 mice. the percentages of B6 mice that were seropositive for MPV were similar in our 2 experiments. the only significant difference in shedding occurred at 2 wpi. more CD4 and TCR mice shed MPV than did B6 mice and more CD4 than CD8 mice shed MPV. MPV shedding and transmission in TCR mice was no different than in B6 mice. fecal PCR and contact sentinels detected only at 1 wpi. fecal PCR analysis occurred through 6 wpi. pregnant outbred Swiss Webster mothers exposed to an MPV-infected mouse at 7 or 14 d postpartum did not transmit MPV to their pups. however, exposure of pregnant mice until parturition to MPV did not result in transmission to pups. age and pregnancy factors need to be considered when designing strategies to address control and elimination of MPV. PCR screening of MLN frequently is used to detect real-time shedding of MPV. the percentage of cages containing mice that were shedding MPV was similar to the percentage of individual mice with MPV DNA-positive feces for each of the 7 mice we evaluated. mice with combined B and T deficiencies pose the highest risk for transmitting MPV infection to other mice with the colony. mice with combined B and T deficiencies pose the highest risk of spreading MPV infection."}
