{"summary": "leishmania amastigotes in the skin nodules were confirmed by cytology and molecular diagnosis. treatment was initiated with allopurinol, resulting in a slight clinical improvement. combined therapy was safe and clinical cure was achieved without further relapses. worldwide epidemiological surveys of leishmania species causing feline asymptomatic infection and FeL have been reported. the number of clinical cases may be underestimated, leading to few reports and lack of information by clinicians and owners. the cat was referred to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, university of Lisbon, with multiple nodular skin lesions. the cat was previously treated for a presumptive pyodermatitis with prednisolone (1 mg/kg PO q12h for 12 days) and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (20 mg/kg PO q12h for 6 days) and showed no clinical improvement. single spots (20\u201350 mm in diameter) of ulcerative dermatitis affected the antebrachial (Figure 2a) and hock (Figure 2b) regions. a complete blood count and biochemical profile were used to evaluate the clinical status of the cat before treatment, after treatment and at all follow-up examinations.
