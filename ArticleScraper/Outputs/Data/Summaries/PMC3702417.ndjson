{"summary": "our objective was to investigate Alberta family physicians willingness to work during an influenza pandemic. 192 participants from a random sample of 1000 Alberta family physicians stratified by region. the most physicians who responded were willing to continue working through some scenarios caused by a pandemic, but less than 50% would continue. family physicians may be required to work in triage centers where they would make decisions about which patients to treat. a severe pandemic may also cause colleagues and physicians\u2019 families to sicken or die. a severe pandemic may also cause colleagues and physicians\u2019 families to sicken or die. survey development A questionnaire was designed then pilot tested on a convenient group of physicians who were not in the sample. the final questionnaire, which included both closed- and open-ended questions, was sent to selected family physicians after the summer vacation. the first and third packages included an information sheet, consent form, copy of the questionnaire, and a negative response sheet.
