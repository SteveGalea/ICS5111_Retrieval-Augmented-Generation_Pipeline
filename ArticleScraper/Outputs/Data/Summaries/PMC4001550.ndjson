{"summary": "human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a nonsegmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. nearly all children experience at least one RSV infection by the age of 2 years. nearly all children experiencing at least one RSV infection by the age of 2 years. columnar airway epithelium provides critical innate defense functions important for maintaining lung sterility. airway epithelial cells respond to inhaled pathogens by secreting antimicrobials and recruiting inflammatory cell infiltrates important for clearing infection and subsequent tissue repair. ciliated epithelial cells are sparing mucin-containing Goblet cells and the underlying basal epithelial cells. these in vitro findings are supported by histologic studies of cartilaginous airways from RSV-infected patients. they also demonstrate the preferential tropism of RSV for ciliated cells. ciliated cells infected with PIV3-NS2 became rounded and morphologically indistinguishable from ciliated cells infected with RSV. the results suggest that acute, distal airway obstruction may be due to the rapid shedding of infected bronchiolar epithelial cells into the airway lumen. representative en face images of GFP-positive cells and quantification of the percentage of epithelium surface area positive for GFP. at day 1 post-inoculation (pi), RSV infection resulted in 5% of the epithelium surface area positive for GFP. over time the extent of infection steadily increased as virus infection spread. the rapid net loss of RSV infection from HAE between days 4 and 8 pi suggests that most of the RSV-infected ciliated cells were cleared from the epithelium during this period. the rapid net loss of RSV infection from HAE suggests that most of the ciliated cells were cleared from the epithelium during this period. only GFP-positive ciliated cells retained native columnar shape of ciliated cells. no GFP-positive cells were observed that retained native columnar shape of ciliated cells. ciliated cell rounding was a direct consequence of RSV infection. cells, including cilia, demonstrated by loss of -tubulin IV immunoreactivity. cells retained GFP fluorescence, suggesting plasma membrane permeability was not overtly compromised. TEM studies of noninfected and RSV-infected HAE fixed to preserve hydrated external environment of the HAE lumenal surface. cells were present in accumulated mucus secretions. underlying intact epithelium of RSV-infected cultures was irregular in appearance. an overall decrease in cilia abundance also was noted in the epithelium. we quantified the extent and kinetics of epithelial cell shedding from noninfected and noninfected HAE cultures by determining the amount of dsDNA present in daily washes of the lumenal surfaces of noninfected and noninfected HAE. by day 3 pi, there was a clear difference between RSV-infected and noninfected HAE in the amount of dsDNA present in apical washes. shed and detached epithelial cells in mucus secretions on apical surface of HAE showed well-characterized nuclear structural changes indicative of cell death. shed and detached epithelial cells in mucus secretions displayed well-characterized nuclear structural changes indicative of cell death. shedding of ciliated cells, and not death while cells are embedded in the epithelium, represents the primary mechanism for clearing RSV infection from a differentiated airway epithelium, at least in vitro. we tested the consequence of RSV infection on directional transport of particulates present in airway secretions by measuring MCT rates of 1-m fluorescent beads. for noninfected HAE, MCT rates approximated those of noninfected HAE during the first 2 days of RSV infection, despite infection of approximately 20% of the epithelium surface. by day 4 pi, when approximately 60% of the epithelium surface was infected, MCT rates had fallen drastically to below 5 m/s the ciliated epithelium generates MCT within the first few days of infection. however, as the area of cilia activity was high, MCT rates had rapidly declined. high-speed video images of RSV-infected ciliated cells reveal visual evidence of cilia beat asynchrony prior to the loss of cilia structures. fected by RSV were significantly shorter, due to cell rounding, than those infected by other respiratory viruses that were tested. a recently isolated, minimally passaged, clinical strain of RSV (RSV Memphis 37) caused infected ciliated cells to round with morphology indistinguishable from those cells infected by recombinant GFP-expressing virus. all viruses expressed GFP. at least 100 infected cells in cultures obtained from 3 different donors were measured. columnar cell rounding is associated with expression of specific RSV genes. expression of NS2 by recombinant PIV3 mimics RSV-induced cell rounding. recombinant PIV3 was engineered to express GFP and NS2 (PIV3-NS2), NS1 (PIV3-NS1), or both NS1 and NS2 (PIV3-NS1/2), and the consequences of infection compared with PIV3 expressing GFP alone. growth of PIV3-NS2 and PIV3-NS1 was equally attenuated in HAE, replicating to titers approximately 1 log lower than PIV3 at the time of peak replication. growth of PIV3-NS1/2 was more severely attenuated, producing titers 2 logs lower than PIV3 at the time of peak replication. ciliated cells infected by PIV3-NS2 or PIV3-NS1/2 maintained native columnar morphology. ciliated cells infected by PIV3-NS2 or PIV3-NS1/2 underwent cell rounding. NS2 expression adversely affects ciliated cell structure and function. surface area of active cilia beat on noninfected HAE (black circles, dotted line) or HAE infected with PIV3 (white circles), PIV3-NS1 (black squares), PIV3-NS2 (white triangles), or PIV3-NS1/2 (black triangles) data (mean SEM) represent quadruplicate cultures. Golden Syrian hamsters were inoculated intranasally with PIV3, PIV3-NS2 (106 PFU) hamsters were inoculated intranasally with 106 PFU of PIV3 (black circles), PIV3-NS1 (white squares), or PIV3-NS2 (black triangles), and virus titers were determined at day 3 pi. fected with virus antigen detected at day 3 pi with an anti-PIV3 antibody. height of infected ciliated cells was determined by measuring height of virus antigen\u2013positive cells from fixed tissue sections. at least 200 cells analyzed across 3 individual animals. epithelial cells shed from the epithelium were rarely noted in the nasal cavity. this suggests that epithelial cells shed from the epithelium were rapidly cleared from the airway lumen. hamsters inoculated with PIV3 showed viral antigen distributed throughout the conducting airway epithelium. the percentage of cross-sectional airway lumen surface area occupied by virus antigen\u2013positive cells at day 3 pi was measured. each column represents an individual animal, and each symbol represents occlusion of an individual airway. data represent 3 independent experiments with a total of 4 to 9 animals per time point. the robust PIV3 infection of the bronchial and bronchial airway epithelium at day 5 pi remained unaltered by day 5 pi. the robust PIV3 infection of the bronchial and bronchial airway epithelium at day 3 pi remained unaltered by day 5 pi. hamster lung tissues inoculated with PIV3-NS2 or PIV3 titers were similar at days 1 and 2 pi, but PIV3 shed PIV3-NS2\u2013infected lower airway cells shed into the small airways were swollen and at times bi-nucleated. cell bodies protruding from the intact epithelium into the airway lumen. cytokeratin 18 was an immunomarker for epithelial cells. NS2 infection of hamster lower airways resembled those in lower airways of humans infected by viral antigen. morphologic changes, cell shedding, and small airway occlusions observed in hamster distal airways infected by PIV3-NS2 resembled those in lower airways of humans. at day 1 post-inoculation (pi), RSV infection resulted in 5% of the epithelium surface area positive for GFP. over time the extent of infection steadily increased proportionate to the numbers of GFP-positive cells. ciliated cells represented approximately 90% of the surface columnar epithelial cells in HAE. the rapid net loss of RSV infection from HAE between days 4 and 8 pi suggests that most of the RSV-infected ciliated cells were cleared from the epithelium during this period. a distinctive morphologic change in infected ciliated cells occurred in the absence of immune cell\u2013mediated clearance mechanisms. FP-positive cells retained native columnar shape of ciliated cells. ciliated cell rounding was a direct consequence of RSV infection. arrowheads indicate robust apical terminal web in ciliated cells. despite significant disruption of apical structures in these bulging ciliated cells, the cells retained GFP fluorescence, suggesting that plasma membrane permeability was not overtly compromised. TEM studies of noninfected and RSV-infected HAE fixed to preserve the hydrated external environment of the HAE lumenal surface, confirmed that RSV infection resulted in the disintegration of apical structures. the underlying intact epithelium of RSV-infected cultures was irregular in appearance. an overall decrease in cilia abundance also was noted in the epithelium. we quantified the extent and kinetics of epithelial cell shedding from noninfected and RSV-infected HAE cultures. we measured the amount of dsDNA present in daily washes of the lumenal surfaces of noninfected and noninfected HAE. however, by day 3 pi, there was a clear difference between RSV-infected and noninfected HAE in the amount of dsDNA present in apical washes shed and detached epithelial cells in mucus secretions on the apical surface of HAE showed well-characterized nuclear structural changes indicative of cell death. pyknosis (nuclear shrinkage), karyorrhexis (nuclear fragmentation) and karyolysis (nuclear dissolution) were noted in shed epithelial cells. findings demonstrate that RSV-infected ciliated cells do not undergo overt cell death while we tested the consequence of RSV infection on directional transport of particulates present in airway secretions by measuring MCT rates of 1-m fluorescent beads. for noninfected HAE, MCT rates approximated those of noninfected HAE during the first 2 days of RSV infection, despite infection of approximately 20% of the epithelium surface. by day 4 pi, when approximately 60% of the epithelium surface was infected, MCT rates had fallen drastically to below 5 m/s cell rounding is unique to RSV among a number of common paramyxoviruses. ciliated cells infected by PIV serotypes 1, 2, 3, or 5, failed to exhibit ciliated cell rounding. cilia beat asynchrony and subsequent disruption of unidirectional transport. a recently isolated, minimally passaged, clinical strain of RSV (RSV Memphis 37) caused infected ciliated cells to round with morphology indistinguishable from those cells infected by recombinant GFP-expressing virus. a recombinant RSV without GFP (GP1) caused rounding of infected ciliated cells identical to the recombinant GFP-expressing virus. confocal microscopy of fixed but unprocessed HAE infected with RSV, PIV3, HMPV, PIV5, or the RSV gene deletion mutants. at least 100 infected cells in cultures obtained from 3 different donors were measured. columnar cell rounding is associated with expression of specific RSV genes. expression of NS2 by recombinant PIV3 mimics RSV-induced cell rounding. recombinant PIV3 was engineered to express GFP and NS2 (PIV3-NS2), NS1 (PIV3-NS1), or both NS1 and NS2 (PIV3-NS1/2) the consequences of infection compared with PIV3 expressing GFP alone were assessed. growth of PIV3-NS1/2 was more severely attenuated, producing titers 2 logs lower than PIV3 at the time of peak replication. this observed attenuation presumably reflected increased genome length and gene number of the PIV3 viruses with inserted RSV NS genes. ated cells infected by PIV3-NS2 or PIV3-NS1/2 underwent cell rounding. NS2 expression adversely affects ciliated cell structure and function. expression of RSV NS2 by PIV3 mimics RSV-induced cytopathology. cilia beat on noninfected HAE (black circles, dotted line) or HAE infected with PIV3 (white circles), PIV3-NS1 (black squares), PIV3-NS2 (white triangles), or PIV3-NS1/2 (black triangles) data represent quadruplicate cultures. all viruses expressed GFP. Golden Syrian hamsters were inoculated intranasally with PIV3, PIV3-NS2 (106 PFU) hamsters were inoculated intranasally with 106 PFU of PIV3 (black circles), PIV3-NS1 (white squares), or PIV3-NS2 (black triangles) titers in the nasal turbinates were determined at day 3 pi. height of infected ciliated cells was determined by measuring height of virus antigen\u2013positive cells from fixed tissue sections. at least 200 cells analyzed across 3 individual animals. all viruses expressed GFP. ***P 0.001, 1-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test. in hamsters inoculated with PIV3, histologic analysis of whole lungs showed viral antigen distributed throughout the conducting airway epithelium of the large bronchial and small bronchiolar airway regions. the majority of infected cells were restricted to the conducting airways. whole lung sections from 6 animals were measured. each column represents an individual animal, and each symbol represents occlusion of an individual airway. data represent 3 independent experiments with a total of 4 to 9 animals. the robust PIV3 infection of the bronchial and bronchiolar airway epithelium at day 3 pi remained largely unaltered by day 5 pi. the robust PIV3 infection of the bronchial and bronchiolar airway epithelium at day 3 pi remained largely unaltered by day 5 pi. the more effective clearance of virus-infected cells following PIV3-NS2 infection influenced viral load in the lung. shed epithelial cells infected by PIV3-NS2 into hamster lower conducting airways were swollen and at times bi-nucleated. cell bodies protruding from the intact epithelium into the airway lumen. cytokeratin 18 was an immunomarker for epithelial cells, as expected. psy lung tissues obtained from hamster distal airways infected. bronchiolar lumens partially or fully occluded by pleomorphic epithelial cells positive for RSV antigen. bronchiolar lumens partially or fully occluded by pleomorphic epithelial cells. ciliated cells of the human large cartilaginous airways are important targets for RSV infection. the ciliated airway epithelium provides a mechanical barrier against inhaled pathogens and contributes to clearance by facilitating MCT. the ciliated airway epithelium serves an important role in maintaining lung health. we combined in vitro and in vivo models of differentiated airway epithelium to assess the impact of RSV infection on the integrity and function of the ciliated airway epithelium. the results were not observed in ciliated cells infected by PIV3 or several other respiratory paramyxoviruses. these effects were due to expression of the RSV NS2 protein. in vivo studies with PIV3-NS2 and control viruses infected only ciliated cells of the respiratory epithelium. only PIV3-NS2 caused ciliated cell rounding, membrane cytopathology, and cell extrusion. infected cells shed from epithelium rarely accumulated in the airway lumen. patchy infection in large airways may represent continuous shedding and clearance of infected cells in these regions. shedding and accumulation may perpetuate infection in the distal airways. a potential candidate for such a cell type is the non-ciliated columnar club (Clara) cell. the differences in morphology between cells shed into the lower versus upper airways might be due to PIV3-NS2 infection of club cells. a combination of smaller diameter of airway lumens in the bronchioles and the expanded volume of cells shed into these airway regions enhances the likelihood that shed cells would accumulate in and occlude distal airways. RSV bronchiolitis is closely associated with small airway obstruction. the obstructive material has been considered to be a mixture of necrotic epithelial cells, mucus secretions, and inflammatory cell exudate. however, autopsy specimens from patients infected with RSV rarely show the presence of mucus plugs in the small airways but consistently show unusual pleomorphic epithelial cells positive for virus antigen. despite the extensive infection and airway occlusions associated with PIV3-NS2 on day 3 pi, the infected cells were cleared more rapidly than was PIV3. despite this, quantification of whole lung viral titers confirmed that PIV3-NS2 was cleared more rapidly than was PIV3. morphologic and shedding phenotype attributed to RSV NS2 appeared to be independent of, and unaffected by, NS1. the precise mechanism by which RSV NS2 exerts its effects on epithelial cell rounding and shedding remains to be explored. the influence of RSV NS2 on cytoskeletal elements represents a potential mechanism for cell rounding following RSV infection. expression of NS2 in vivo resulted in accelerated clearance of infection. NS2-induced cell shedding acts as a novel clearance mechanism to remove infected cells from both the airway epithelium and the lumen. NS2-mediated cell shedding and subsequent airway obstruction may contribute to the increased incidence and severity of RSV-associated bronchiolitis compared with other viral etiologies.
