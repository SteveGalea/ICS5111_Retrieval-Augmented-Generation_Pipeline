{"summary": "the most common pathogens like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Staphylococcus aureus are normal and transient residents of the nasopharyngeal niche. the human microbiome in general is assumed beneficial to the host due to stimulation and maturation of immune systems. colonization by the \u201cpotential pathogens\u201d of the NP microbiome is mainly asymptomatic approx. 1 100 000 generated sequences (on average 11000 sequences per sample) yielded about 92 000 unique sequences, representing 13 taxonomic phyla and 243 species-level phyla types (OTUs) the data were normalized for equal numbers of reads per sample. in the oral cavity, microbiota are dominated by Firmicutes followed by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes (overall 50% Gram-positive bacteria) the microbiome of the nostril contains more than 80% gram-positive bacteria, mostly Actinobacteria and Firmicutes [15]. these data suggest different dynamics (i.e., different biological equilibria) in the NP microbiome.

PCR was performed using the forward primer 785F (5\u2032-GGA TTA GAT ACC CBR GTA GTC-3\u2032) and the reverse primer 1061R (5\u2032-TCA CGR CAC GAG CTG ACG AC-3\u2032) the primers were fitted with the 454 Life Sciences Adapter A (forward primer) and B (reverse primer), fused to the 5\u2032 end of the 16S rDNA bacterial primer sequences. real-time PCR for viruses One 200 l aliquot of swab \"rinse\" solution was used to extract viral nucleic acids using the MagNA Pure LC total nucleic acid isolation kit. samples were assayed in duplicate in a 25 l reaction mixture containing 10 l (c)DNA. taxonomic units (OTUs) were created by aligning unique sequences and calculating distance matrices as previously described [23] and using DOTUR [27] to create clusters at the lowest common taxon of at least two-thirds of the sequences. only those sequences found at least 5 times were included in the analyses. independent samples T-test and Spearman correlation coefficients were used for testing correlations between conventional cultures and pyrosequencing data. independent samples t-test was used to compare the contribution of gram negative and positive bacteria to the microbiota in different seasons. nasopharyngeal swabs were plated onto a 5% sheep blood agar plate. the cotton swabs were rinsed in 1 ml of saline and stored at 80\u00b0C. samples were homogenized with a mini-beadbeater. the release DNA was purified with the AGOWA mag Mini DNA Isolation Kit. the DNA binding step was performed twice for each sample. the integrity of the DNA was inspected by agar gel electrophoresis. 96 samples contained more than 1,3*103 fg/l DNA and were included in sequence analysis. PCR was performed using the forward primer 785F (5\u2032-GGA TTA GAT ACC CBR GTA GTC-3\u2032) and the reverse primer 1061R (5\u2032-TCA CGR CAC GAG CTG ACG AC-3\u2032) the four libraries were sequenced unidirectionally in the reverse direction (B-adaptor) during two 454 Genome Sequencer FLX (GS-FLX), 454 Life Sciences (Roche), Branford, CT 06405 USA. real-time PCR for viruses was performed in parallel using real-time PCR assays for bocavirus (HBoV), polyomaviruses (WUPyV and KIPyV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV data analysis GS-FLX sequencing data were processed as previously described [23]. we trimmed data by removing primer sequences and low-quality data. we then used the GAST algorithm [24] to calculate the percent difference between each unique sequence and its closest match. analysis, Principle Component Analysis, and hierarchical clustering were performed using TM4 microarray software suite [28]. seasonal differences in phyla distribution were studied by using Mann Whitney U test (SPSS software version 15.0) independent samples T-test, and Spearman correlation coefficients (SPSS software version 15.0) were used for testing correlations between conventional cultures and pyrosequencing data. nasopharyngeal samples are classified to species level. their absolute presence per child (yes/no) and relative abundance (% of all sequences) are listed."}
