{"summary": "technology advances have stimulated the development of new testing systems that have been providing huge amounts of molecular and clinical data. the routines of genomics laboratory are typically characterized by high parallelism in testing and constant procedure changes. results This paper describes a formal approach to address this challenge through the implementation of a genetic testing management system applied to human genome laboratory. incompatibilities between new and old processes and new data requirements make it difficult to integrate and analyze all the available information. a long-term solution to the scientific data integration issue requires formally validated and automated information processing tools. as a result, delayed software evolution may slow down scientific progress. amplification and reagents usually vary per exon and gene to be tested. another set of tests requires a screening step using DHPLC or a different strategy. a strategy for cost reduction of testing is to perform common genetic tests that are used for most cases of the disorder being investigated. new genetic tests are constantly being developed from old ones. a software system is required to handle different versions of procedures and tests. a popular approach is to include ontology evaluation into the design process of biological system rules. the PIMS is a specialized LIMS to manage protein testing methods. the WIST provides a set of application programming interfaces and web application to support the LIMS development. the PIMS and WIST are a group of software approaches that uses specific workflow definition languages and workflow management systems to support laboratory management requirements. the human Genome Research Center (CEGH) is the largest center in Latin America dedicated to the study of human mendelian genetic disorders. the center offers around 40 different genetic tests, which are performed by several technicians under the supervision of six researchers. a negative result is obtained, a second test is performed, which is used for the second most frequent cause of the disorder. the genetic test is used to identify mutations associated with spinal muscular atrophy, a neuromuscular disease that causes progressive muscle degeneration. a popular approach is to include ontology evaluation into the design and specification process of biological system rules. but ontologies cannot include semantics of tests and effectively address dynamic changes in genome testing routines. a downside, these approaches do not support the control of long transactions. SIGla: an adaptive open source LIMS for multiple laboratories [18] provides workflow features using the Enhydra Shark [19] open source editor that is a graphical tool to design workflows. SIGla creates a XPDL file [20] allowing workflow execution into a workflow engine, called Shark. a workflow in the context of information systems can be defined as automation of a process in which information or tasks are passed from one entity to another according to specific process rules. a workflow management system defines, creates, and manages workflow execution with the use of software. navigation plan concept Multiple application workflows are composed of actions that are performed through multiple applications, integrating data in heterogeneous information system environments. there are significant challenges due to potentially complex interferences among autonomously designed components. navigation plan definition language (NPDL) uses process algebra [22] as a formal basis for process representation and can be considered as a rigorous process representation language for controlled execution. NPDL adopts concepts (i.e., actions and operators) from basic process algebra extended by a merge operator and recursive expressions. navigation plan tool NPTool controls process execution and is designed for integration in information systems. NPTool uses NPDL and a relational database to specify processes and control their instantiation and execution. the navigation plan tool is designed for integration in information systems. navigation plan concept is defined through a clear compositional structure. a single action is a set of atomic actions formed using process algebraic operators. a step is either a single action or a checkpoint; a process is a set of steps formed using process algebraic operators. NPDL is a way to go from process algebra expression to a workflow system using a SQL extension. NPDL also includes interleaved parallel composition \u201c|*\u201d, the multi merge composition \u201c&\u201d, the discriminator composition \u201c\u201d, the unlimited repetition \u201c\"*, the number limited repetition \u201c\"n\u201d (n is a positive integer), the function limited repetition \u201c\"f\u201d (f is a function that returns a positive integer), and the conditional execution \u201c%r\u201d (r is a Bo the CEGH Information System uses process representation to manage genetic testing execution. it has around 100 tables and 50 interfaces to manage patient and family data, medical, laboratory and disease information, clinical annotations, access control, tests, relationships between tests and diseases, testing order, their execution and analyses. the system is implemented in Ruby on Rails version 2.3 and uses a postgreSQL database version 8.4 under a Linux environment. the software program is able to translate the user\u2019s definitions into process algebra expressions. the interface is designed to meet the user\u2019s needs and to be semantically close to the way he/she understands and recognizes the composition steps of a genetic test. it allows the use of a formal approach to manage processes without increasing software complexity. the atomic action END is released to execution at the completion of both procedures. after the PCR exon 7 and PCR exon 8 procedures are completed, the SMA test can be finished and the results stored. the next procedure to be performed is selected when using the interface shown in Figure 3 the user indicates the end of the execution of a procedure. a user can select the procedure status as follows: complete procedure, repeat procedure, cancel test, finish test. the NPDL will analyze the process algebra expression to decide which procedures can be released to execution. the software uses the process algebra expression to guide the user through the correct path to perform a genetic test. the current CEGH interface maps operators that only are required to perform laboratory genomic testing. our approach uses a common repository of process planning that ensures reusability, specification, instantiation, monitoring, and execution of processes. an application library implements a workflow engine as SQL extension for process instantiation, execution, control and monitoring. the software enables a user to define and control complex processes as he/she understands it.
