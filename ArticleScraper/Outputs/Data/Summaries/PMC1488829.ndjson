{"summary": "allrgic asthmatics are more susceptible to RSV infection and viral exacerbation. fluticasone propionate (FP) and salmeterol (Sal) were tested on RSV-induced airway inflammation. mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) and infected with RSV. the most commonly identified viruses in these studies include rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) URIs cause a decrease in peak flow that lags behind upper airway symptoms by 1\u20132 days. URIs cause a decrease in peak flow that lags behind upper airway symptoms by 1\u20132 days, with 46% of subjects reporting a two day lag in peak flow reduction. a combination of FP and Sal reduced infection and preserved ciliated cells to a greater degree than either alone suggesting synergy between the two agents. a combination of FP and Sal may provide protection from severe RSV infection and the ensuing asthma exacerbation. the suspension was clarified by centrifugation at 700 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. the resulting supernatant was layered onto a glycerol gradient. the pellet containing virus was resuspended in pre-cooled (4\u00b0C) buffer. 21 to day 27 mice were treated daily i.n. with FP, Sal, or the two in combination (FPS) at 10 g per mouse. mice were sacrificed and BAL fluid, lungs and spleens were taken. all experiments were repeated at least twice. cell-adhesion molecule ICAM-1, the goblet cell marker Muc-5A, and the Th2 marker T1/ST2 were sacrificed. single-cell suspensions were prepared from the spleens and cultured for 24 to 48 hrs in DMEM with 10% FBS. cells were surface-stained with FITC-anti-CD4 (Research Diagnostics, Flanders, NJ) Stained sections were photographed under a fluorescent microscope. differences between groups were considered significant at P 0.05. mice were infected under light anesthesia by intranasal inoculation of RSV. mice were treated daily i.n. with fluticasone (FP) propionate, salmeterol (Sal) or the two in combination (FPS) at 10 g per mouse. mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of OVA on day 1 and by intranasal (i.n.) administration of OVA on days 9, 12 and 14. BAL cells were centrifuged onto microscope slides by Cytospin (Shandon) and stained using the Hema3 kit (Fisher) inflammation was assessed as disruption or denudation of the epithelial layer and infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes into the perialveolar region. the concentration of IFN- in the BAL was measured by ELISA using a kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) the results were expressed as pg of IFN- per ml of BAL fluid. FP and Sal all showed reduced eosinophil numbers but no change in neutrophils. conjugation therapy resulted in a significant reduction in eosinophil numbers compared to other treatments. mice were sensitized with OVA and infected with RSV. treatment with FPS reduced the number of eosinophils and neutrophils compared to either drug alone. FP or S alone reduced the pathology somewhat but the combination FPS was significantly more effective. FP increased the number of cells producing IL-10 and Sal increased cells producing IL-4. FPS decreased the number of cells producing IL-10, IL-4 and IFN-. mice were sensitized with OVA, infected with RSV then treated with FP, Sal or FPS. they were sacrificed on day 15 and lung sections were stained for ICAM-1, Muc-5A or T1/ST2. two groups of mice were sensitized with OVA, then prophylactically treated with FP, Sal or FPS prior to infection with RSV. three days after infection, they were sacrificed. a differential cell count was performed on the BAL fluid. conjugation therapy resulted in a significant reduction in eosinophil number as well as lung inflammation compared to the other treatments. mice were sensitized with OVA and infected with RSV as described in Methods. FP or S alone reduced the pathology somewhat but the combination FPS was significantly more effective (Fig. 2C) the results showed that FPS significantly attenuated AHR and inflammation compared to control group and mice treated with FP alone. IL-10 and Sal increased cells producing IL-4, whereas FPS decreased the number of cells producing IL-10, IL-4 and IFN-. mice were sensitized with OVA, infected with RSV and treated with FP, Sal or FPS. apoptosis was induced in a population of cells in the lungs of OVA-sensitized, RSV-infected mice. they were sacrificed on day 15 and lung sections were stained. the decreased burden of virus in the lung tissue of FPS-treated mice was matched by an increase in secreted IFN- in BAL fluid. two groups of mice were sensitized with OVA, then prophylactically treated with FP, Sal or FPS prior to infection with RSV. steroid or 2-agonists alone was found to be partially effective in RSV infection and viral induced asthma. in experiments where mice sensitized with OVA received one RSV infection, there was a decrease in eosinophils but an increase in lymphocytes. this is probably due to the resistance of neutrophils to corticosteroids. cytokine-producing cells in splenocyte cultures are in agreement with increased number of Th2-like cells seen in lung sections from salmeterol-treated mice. increased IL-10 production has been associated with recurrent wheezing in children hospitalized for RSV bronchiolitis. lungs of mice treated with either FP or Sal showed a decreased number of apoptotic cells compared to FP or Sal alone. treatment with FP plus Sal decreases inflammation and examination of lung homogenates for RSV revealed a reduction in virus titer in the lungs of mice treated with FPS therapy. author(s) declare that they have no competing interests. RS prepared RSV, performed infections, drug treatments, AHR measurements. PKJ performed OVA sensitization and RSV infection."}
