{"summary": "Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a gram-negative pathogenic -proteobacterium. it belongs to the genus Neisseria that also includes the human pathogen Neisseria meningitidis. it is the causative agent of gonorrhoea, one of the most common sexually transmitted infections. a better understanding of N. gonorrhoeae infection and virulence could facilitate new treatments of gonorrhoea. novel immunogenic proteins could provide first indications of crucial proteins involved in gonococcal pathogenicity. another application for immunogenic proteins is the development of vaccines. the identification of immunogenic proteins is performed by 2D-PAGE and immunoblot followed by mass spectrometry [22\u201325], by time and labour consuming expression of the proteome and screening on nitrocellulose membranes [26], or recently by microarray technique [27\u201329]. however, all of these methods have certain disadvantages. phage display of antigens may avoid these limitations. the phenotype (protein fragments) is coupled with the genotype (corresponding gene fragments) by using polyclonal antibodies, patient or animal sera, immunogenic oligopeptides are selected in a panning procedure. this technology allows for the discovery of immunogenic proteins independent from pathogen cultivation, thus also identifying proteins only expressed in the patient (in vivo host pathogen context) the phage displayed oligopeptides were mapped to the obtained models. the obtained immunogenic proteins could serve as promising candidates for the further clarification of gonococcal infection and for the development of effective agents against N. gonorrhoeae. clones randomly picked from three different libraries (A) and from the phage packaged library (B), Lane 25 Empty pHORF3 vector control without insert, Lane 26 No template control, M Size ladder. panning and screening of oligopeptide phage A polyclonal rabbit antibody to N. gonorrhoeae was used for the panning rounds. oligopeptides isolated by phage display and proteins identified by BLAST were dismissed after screening due to low signal intensities in ELISA. Previously identified as immunogenic in Neisseria genus or found in outer membrane vesicle vaccines.

NGO1634 and NGO1796 exhibit oligopeptides in the middle of the protein. all models were checked for their reliability by QMEAN [64] the cloned libraries had an in-frame insert ratio of approximately 5%. in-frame insert rate was increased to 70% after Hyperphage packaging. clones were randomly picked from three different libraries. eight oligopeptides exhibited no homologies to known antigens. one clone carried parts of two genes\u2014NGO1656 and NGO1657\u2014the last 92 bp of NGO1657. both genes were chosen to further characterise the immunogenic character of their encoded proteins.

NGO0777 was shown to be upregulated in a gonococcal deletion mutant lacking a dam replacing gene. it is involved in DNA repair in certain stress situations which could also be the case in cell adhesion or infection. a real-time PCR analysis was performed to validate the presence of mRNA coding for this protein. osome recycling factor (rrf) is involved in the recycling of ribosomes upon translation. it showed signal intensities above fourfold of the cut-off of the negative control. studies with an E. coli homologue showed that it is essential for bacterial growth and a possible target for novel antibacterial treatments. NGO1656 and NGO1657 were expressed as full-length proteins. one selected clone contained DNA sequences of both proteins. the last 92 bp of NGO1657, a non-coding part of 48 bp and 131 bp of NGO1656. homologue NMB1468 was described as an immunogenic protein in N. meningitidis. it was strongly bound by a polyclonal anti-N. gonorrhoeae rabbit antibody in ELISA validating its immunogenic character for N. gonorrhoeae FA1090. several periplasmic ABC transporters comparable to NGO0170 were found to be surface-exposed in N. meningitidis [87,88]. homologues of NGO0326, NGO0564, NGO0592, NGO0777, NGO0916, NGO0983, NGO2095 and NGO2139 were also detected in outer membrane fractions. further investigation of NGO1634 could provide detailed information as to the protein\u2019s potential function, localization and structure. virulence-associated proteins were identified such as NGO0326 and NGO1577 increasing the likelihood of discovering virulence-associated factors among the identified proteins. a goat anti-rabbit IgG (Fc-specific, Biomol 611\u20131103 Lot#29341) was used as capture antibody for the panning procedure. three different antibodies against N. gonorrhoeae from separate immunisations and pools of individuals were deployed for the validation of full-length immunogenic proteins.
