{"summary": "PEDV is a member of the Alphacoronavirus genus that has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome. PEDV induces diarrhea, causing high mortality in suckling piglets and weight loss in older hogs. a mucosal PEDV vaccine is not available. the gut mucosal immune system consists of immune-inductive site, such as peyer's patches (PPs), where Ag-specific immune induction occurs. the main gateway of Ags into PPs is via microfold (M) cells, specialized epithelial cells mainly found in the follicle-associated epithelium of PPs in the gut (10) tetanus toxoid can be targeted to M cells by complexing with an M cell-specific Ab (NKM 16-2-4), which interacts with (1,2)-fucose-containing carbohydrate moiety. oral administration of the complex with the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin (CT) effectively induces tetanus toxoid-specific immune responses in the systemic and mucosal compartments (16). partial NTD gene was amplified from the S1 protein gene of the PEDV BM1 strain. the amplified gene was cloned into the pGEX 4T-1 expression vector. the protein lysate was treated with or without isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside. immunoblotting was performed using an anti-GST Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary Ab was added. bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit. ELISA and ELISPOT assays A total of 50 g recombinant NTD231\u2013501 protein was orally administered with or without CT to female BALB/c mice once a week for 3 wk. each indicated IgG isotype-specific Ab and alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated secondary Ab were added sequentially to the plates. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) data are presented as meansstandard error of repeated experiments unless otherwise specified. differences were considered significant at p0.05. recombinant NTD231\u2013501 protein containing a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag was expressed from the pGEX 4T-1 vector. the protein lysate was treated with or without isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside. a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary Ab was added. ELISA and ELISPOT assays A total of 50 g recombinant NTD231\u2013501 protein was orally administered with or without CT to female BALB/c mice once a week for 3 wk. to measure the NTD-specific serum IgG isotype, at 4 wk after the last oral immunization, sera were prepared and analyzed by ISO-2. LP lymphocytes were prepared using enzyme digestion buffer containing DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) and collagenase D (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) to measure the number of NTD-specific IgA-secreting cells in the LP. the plate was cultured for 24 h and incubated with AP-conjugated anti-IgA Ab. domain and the S2 region (residues 794\u20131385) involved in viral fusion to host cells. domain consists of an NTD (residues 231\u2013501) with sugar-binding ability and a CTD (residues 502\u2013780) containing a pAPN-binding site. role of the domain as a mucosal vaccine Ag has been poorly studied. l-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside induction confirmed by Western blot analysis. recombinant NTD231\u2013501 of the PEDV S1 protein was purified by glutathione Sepharose chromatography. recombinant NTD231\u2013501 of the PEDV S1 protein exhibits sugar-binding capability. TD231\u2013501 of the PEDV S1 protein purified by GST affinity chromatography was stained with NKM 16-2-4 anti-M cell Ab (Alexa 488, green), anti-GST Ab (Alexa 594, red), or WGA (Alexa 405, blue). recombinant NTD231\u2013501 of the PEDV S1 protein functions as a mucosal Ag capable of targeting itself to M cells. recombinant NTD231\u2013501 of the PEDV S1 protein induces Ag-specific immune responses in the systemic and mucosal compartments. each group of mice was orally administered the Ag once a week for 3 weeks. level of NTD231\u2013501-specific serum IgG2a was significantly enhanced by oral administration of NTD231\u2013501 or NTD231\u2013501 together with the mucosal vaccine adjuvant CT. sera, (B) feces, and (C) LP cells were prepared at (A and B) 3 days and (C) 4 weeks after the last immunization. the number of NTD231\u2013501-specific IgA Ab-secreting cells in the LP was determined by ELISPOT assay. recombinant NTD231\u2013501 of the PEDV S1 protein was produced in E. coli. soluble fraction of recombinant NTD231\u2013501 protein was purified by glutathione Sepharose chromatography. recombinant NTD231\u2013501 of the PEDV S1 protein exhibited mucin-binding activity in a mucin-binding assay (8). we also monitored the mucin-binding ability of our recombinant NTD231\u2013501 protein because it was purified under denaturing conditions and contains a GST tag. recombinant NTD231\u2013501 of the PEDV S1 protein exhibited significantly (p0.05) higher muc in the gut mucosa, M cells have a unique (1,2)-fucose-containing carbohydrate moiety compared with enterocytes that can be detected using an M cell-specific Ab (NKM 16-2-4) (16). by contrast, WGA binds to enterocytes but not to M cells. to this end, we assumed that the NTD231\u2013501 interacts with specific glycan motifs expressed on M cells. the level of NTD231\u2013501-specific serum IgG2a was significantly enhanced by oral administration of NTD231\u2013501 or NTD231\u2013501 together with the mucosal vaccine adjuvant CT. it is important to note that elevation of Ag-specific IgG2a was closely related to induction of Th1-type immune responses. the number of NTD231\u2013501-specific fecal IgA Ab-secreting cells in the LP was determined by ELISPOT assay. data are presented as meansstandard error (n=3) and a representative result from three independent experiments is shown. recombinant NTD231\u2013501 protein yield was 20 mg/L. recombinant protein produced in this study specifically binds to mucin and to the apical area of M cells. a currently licensed oral mucosal subunit vaccine does not exist. the Ag-specific IgG2a isotype was efficiently induced by oral administration of NTD231\u2013501. it is closely related to the induction of protective immunity against a number of viruses, including influenza virus, Ebola virus, and yellow fever virus."}
