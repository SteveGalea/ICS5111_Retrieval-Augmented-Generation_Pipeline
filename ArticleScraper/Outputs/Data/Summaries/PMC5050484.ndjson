{"summary": "recombinant ZEBOV GP (Integrated BioTherapies), recombinant SEBOV GP (Sino Biological) or purified virus-like particles (VLPs) containing nucleoprotein (NP), viral protein 40 (VP40) and GP antigen for the appropriate EBOV were used to detect cross-reactive IgG. fetal bovine serum washed 6 times with 300 microliters/well of 1PBS containing 0.2% Tween-20. plates were then washed 6 times with 300 microliters/well of 1PBS containing 0.2% Tween-20. serum samples were then assayed in duplicate. rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) of Chinese origin were inoculated intramuscularly with 1000 plaque-forming units (PFU) of ZEBOV-Makona (n = 4) or SEBOV-Gulu (n = 3) CS (pooled from survivors; ZEBOV-CS was from 6, and SEBOV-CS was from 3) were administered. all animals were given physical examinations, and blood was collected at the time of challenge and on days 3, 6, 9, 14, 21, and 28 after ZEBOV-Makona challenge. all animals were monitored daily and scored for disease progression with an internal filovirus scoring protocol approved by the University of Texas Medical Branch\u2013Galveston Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. ZEBOV RNA was detected using the CFX96 detection system (BioRad Laboratories) in one-step probe real-time qPCR kits. limit of detection is 1 104 genome equivalents per gram of tissue. anti-EBOV IgG Serum Analysis EBOV RNA\u2013negative sera collected at study end point from antiviral therapeutic ZEBOV-Makona or SEBOV-Gulu studies were tested for cross-reactive IgG antibodies against SEBOV and ZEBOV. recombinant ZEBOV GP (Integrated BioTherapies), recombinant SEBOV GP (Sino Biological) or purified virus-like particles (VLPs) LPs were washed twice with 300 L/well of 1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and blocked for 2 hours. plates were then washed 6 times with 300 microliters/well of 1PBS containing 0.2% Tween-20. NHP serum samples were then assayed in duplicate. serum dilutions were prepared in modified Eagle's medium. 100 L were seeded into 6-well plates to generate a confluent monolayer. serum-virus mixture was added in duplicate and samples were incubated for 60 minutes. a total of 70 mL, split 10 mL and 60 mL for intravenous and subcutaneous administration; this is roughly equivalent to approximately 11 mL/kg. all animals were given physical examinations, and blood was collected at the time of challenge and on days 3, 6, 9, 14, 21 and 28 after ZEBOV-Makona challenge. Detection of Viremia RNA was isolated from whole blood by means of the Viral RNA mini-kit (Qiagen), placing 100 L of blood into 600 L of buffer AVL. the limit of detection for real-time qPCR is 1 104 genome equivalents per gram of tissue. EBOV convalescent sera was used as an EBOV species control to test whether species-specific serum was necessary for treatment. high titers of IgG that could bind to SEBOV GP were detected in the SEBOV-Gulu sera compared to minimal levels bound to ZEBOV GP and both VLPs. the ability of ZEBOV-Makona and SEBOV-Gulu convalescent sera to neutralize ZEBOV-Makona was tested by a PRNT50 assay. only the ZEBOV-Makona convalescent sera were able to modestly neutralize ZEBOV-Makona in vitro with a PRNT50 of 1:40. CS or ZEBOV CS (blue) against ZEBOV VLPs in presence of increasing concentration of sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) Error bars represent standard deviations. a regimen of 3 total convalescent sera treatments once every 3 days beginning on day 3 after exposure. ebolavirus (ZEBOV)\u2013Makona exposure treated with Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV) convalescent sera (CS; green: n = 1), with ZEBOV CS (blue; n = 4), or untreated (red; n = 1). asterisk indicates the day of ZEBOV-Makona exposure, and the arrows indicate the days of CS treatment. S-CS-1 was the only animal to be devoid of typical gross pathologic and histopathologic findings and of labeling of ZEBOV antigen by immunohistochemical stain. the survival of animal S-CS-1 raised questions regarding possible differences between the SEBOV-Gulu and ZEBOV-Makona convalescent sera. avidity of the anti-ZEBOV GP antibodies from each individual donor serum was shifted. one SEBOV serum donor in particular, S-D-3, had a very marked shift in the avidity assay. SEBOV-Gulu convalescent sera\u2013treated animals in this study did not survive infection, dying on days 7 (S-CS-2) and 9 (S-CS-3) after exposure, respectively, with the untreated control dying on day 9 after exposure. all 3 animals had moderate-to-severe depression with infectious viremia. the SEBOV-Gulu convalescent sera were used as an EBOV species control. we assessed both sera for the level of IgG to the following ZEBOV or SEBOV proteins. similar levels of IgG that could bind to SEBOV GP were detected in the SEBOV-Gulu sera. a regimen of 3 total convalescent sera treatments once every 3 days starting on day 3 after exposure. six rhesus macaques were infected intramuscularly with 1000 PFU of ZEBOV-Makona. all animals were observed for clinical signs of disease and hematologic and blood chemical changes after ZEBOV-Makona exposure. animal S-CS-1 survived infection, while the untreated control and all 4 ZEBOV-Makona convalescent sera-treated animals died of infection. asterisk indicates the day of ZEBOV-Makona exposure. circulating anti-ZEBOV GP IgG was detected on day 6 postexposure. however, this circulating anti-ZEBOV GP IgG was unable to reduce the infectious viral load (Figure 2C) and viral RNA load in tissues (Figure 2D) of animals treated with ZEBOV-Makona convalescent sera. the survival of animal S-CS-1 raised questions regarding possible differences between the SEBOV-Gulu and ZEBOV-Makona convalescent sera. the survival of animal S-CS-1 raised questions regarding possible differences between the SEBOV-Gulu and ZEBOV-Makona convalescent sera. a regimen of 3 SEBOV-Gulu convalescent sera treatments was assessed. three NHPs were infected intramuscularly with 1000 PFU of ZEBOV-Makona. the lone NHP treated with these seras did not survive infection, dying on days 7 (S-CS-2) and 9 (S-CS-3) the WHO released a report supporting the use of experimental treatments for evaluation of their effectiveness against ZEBOV-Makona infection and disease. some of this support stemmed from the report of convalescent whole-blood treatment in the 1995 outbreak of ZEBOV-Kikwit infection. convalescent sera obtained about a month after initial exposure. this is consistent with conditions during the recent west africa ZEBOV epidemic. compared the efficacy of homologous SEBOV species convalescent sera against heterologous SEBOV sera. a small benefit from the SEBOV-Gulu convalescent sera cannot be ruled out in this study. the number of untreated control animals in the newly developed rhesus monkey model is not high enough at this time to determine whether a very small percentage of untreated control animals can survive. we cannot conclude that the anti-ZEBOV GP GP IgG avidity differences in the convalescent sera accounted for the lone survivor we observed."}
