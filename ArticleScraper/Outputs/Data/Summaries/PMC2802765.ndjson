{"summary": "the advent of in vitro cytotoxicity testing has greatly streamlined this process. there are clearer definitions and greater agreement for what constitutes cytotoxicity in vitro. a compound or treatment is considered to be cytotoxic if it prevents cellular attachment, causes dramatic morphological changes or adversely affects replication rate. VIABILITY ASSAYS Viability assays measure activities attributable to cellular maintenance and survival. these activities are typically metabolic biomarkers such as ATP and mitochondrial reductase potential. these activities are directly proportional to viable cell number after a treatment period. the product of resazurin reduction (resorufin) can also be measured using fluorescence with a fluorometer equipped with 560nm excitation and 590nm emission filter set. the product of resorufin can also be measured using fluorescence with a fluorometer equipped with 560nm excitation and 590nm emission filter set. resazurin reagents generate amongst the most cost-effective data on a per well basis. the major disadvantage of employing the chemistry is that the reagent is subject to interferences from compounds with inherent reductive capacity (such as ascorbic acid, glutathione, coenzyme A, dithiothreitol etc.) a 30 minute incubation of reagent and cells at 37oC is sufficient for generating a workable signal window. the incubation can be extended without detriment if work-flow scheduling does not permit shorter periods. this feature is particularly attractive for normalizing fluorescent or luminescent data sets. all commercial ATP quantification reagents contain luciferase enzyme and luciferin substrate. most useful formulations for HTS applications also contain thermostable recombinant luciferase and ATPase inhibitors. prolonged maintenance of the luminescent signal allows for batch processing of plates and obviates any inter-plate kinetic variability. CYTOTOXICITY ASSAYS Cytotoxicity assay chemistries are formulated to detect loss of membrane integrity associated with cell death. the current most useful cytotoxicity biomarkers are constitutive, conserved and relatively stable, high-abundance enzymes \u201creleased\u201d into the extra-cellular environment (culture medium) the implementation of LDH assays for cytotoxicity testing in HTS has been limited because most commercial assay protocols require a cell-free sample transferred into a separate assay plate. a single addition homogeneous assay format can be measured in HTS formats after a short incubation (10-20 minutes) the fluorescent format of the assay utilizes the highly-efficient rhodamine 110 (R110) fluorophore which is measured in as short as 30 minutes by a fluorometer with 485nm excitation. the luminescent format employs an engineered luciferase formulation to detect the luciferin product of cleavage thereby generating a glow-type signal. the concept of multiplexed screening is well appreciated for image-based technologies. it is emerging as a more viable option for plate-based, homogeneous assays. reagent formulations must not compromise functional aspects of the chemistries. fluorescent viability and cytotoxicity assays rely on an impermeant DNA intercalating dye which labels cells with damaged membranes. permeable dye is sequestered inside viable cells after esterase cleavage of a labeling group. variable chemistries are rarely employed where total fluorescence from assay wells is measured. it is possible to conduct immediate confirmation testing of apparent cytotoxic compounds in the same well by leveraging the statistical power of orthogonal detection of viability (viable cell aminopeptidase, dead cell protease and ATP biomarkers) the economy of this consolidated testing is noteworthy in terms of compound usage, culture set up, and operator man-hours. LUMINESCENT/LUMINESCENT ASSAYS Mixed detection combinations of the protease biomarkers are also available that offer benefit in screening applications. in this method, viability is measured first by the addition of the GF-AFC reagent followed by the addition of the luminogenic dead cell reagent chemistry. viability and cytotoxicity measurements utilize the same biomarker. viability and cytotoxicity measurements are subject to the same interferences. high content screening and label-free methods have gained some degree of popularity. the choice of which surrogate of health or death to use is greatly influenced by the available detection format and extent of assay time required to reach a result. Luminescent formats offer additional utility over fluorescent methods with regard to detection sensitivity, but are also typically more costly to use on a per well basis. all assay chemistries are subject to experimental error or interferences. multiplexed combinations of compatible assays offer a convenient and cost-effective manner to address variation (by response normalization), flag non-conforming orthogonal data points."}
