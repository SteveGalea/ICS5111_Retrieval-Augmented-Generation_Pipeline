{"summary": "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a leading cause of disability and death. the most common cause of COPD is smoking. there is evidence suggesting genetic factors influence COPD susceptibility. Genomic DNA extraction Blood samples were collected using EDTA. treated with sucrose lysis buffer and the nuclear cell pellets were stored at \u201380\u00b0C until DNA extraction. sequence of the Adenovirus C gene was amplified by real-time PCR. PCR was conducted for a 40-cycle amplification (10 min at 95\u00b0C, 15 s at 92\u00b0C and 1 min at 60\u00b0C) using 11.25 l of genomic DNA diluted in dH2O, 12.5 l of Taqman universal PCR master mix containing 2.5 mM dNTP, 2.5 mM MgCl2 and 1 unit of Taq polymerase. software automatically determined genotypes and generated an intuitive graphic representation of results in cluster plot report."}
