{"summary": "new human viruses emerge from zoonotic precursors and produce serious disease, especially in aged populations. virus replicon particles (VRPs) are replication incompetent, induce strong mucosal, cellular, and humoral immune responses and ensure clinical safety (10\u201312) attenuated VEE virus 3014 structural protein coats induce robust immunity against a variety of antigens. however, concerns have hampered VEE virus 3000-based vaccine applications because of the potential for replication-competent wild-type VEE virus infectious particles. the attenuated platform provides ease of purification for manufacturing processes. a new VRP system was created using the VEE virus 3526 backbone. it is highly immunogenic in primates and horses and is safe when administered by intraperitoneal infection (22). this was directly correlated with an inability to induce protective antibodies in vivo (8, 11) our data show the highly portable and safe VRP 3526 platform confers a robust expression/vaccine system that induces robust immune responses that protect both young and aged animal models from lethal challenge. a myriad of concerns have limited their use, including select agent/BSL3 containment, reversion, and inefficacy of the vaccine platform in vulnerable populations. all three plasmids were linearized, and RNA transcripts were electroporated into BHK cells. after 24 to 48 h, cell culture supernatants were collected, the VRPs were purified, and titers were determined on BHK cells. replicons were negative for cytopathic effect (CPE) after passages 1 and 2. vaccines from V3000, V3526, and V3014 coats determined on BHK cells by an IFA assay. Western blot from independent experiments showing expression of SARS-CoV Spike protein from V3526S and V3000S vaccines. ligand binding and antigenicity of norwalk virus VLPs produced from V3014 or V3526 VRPs. electron micrograph of norwalk virus VLPs produced from V3014 (A) or V3526 (B) VRPs. mouse anti-Norwalk virus polyclonal serum binding to norwalk virus VLPs. animals vaccinated with V3000S and V3526S had minimal viral replication. mice vaccinated with VRP-HA showed clear progression to diffuse alveolar damage and ARDS. compared to wild-type V3000S and V3014S. H&E-stained lung sections harvested 4 days postinfection with V3000S (black), V3526S (blue), V3014S (gray), or control (VRP-HA; white) for airway disease, vascular cuffing, pneumonia, and diffuse alveolar damage. previous work had shown only modest efficacy of the V3014 platform relative to V3000 following heterologous CoV challenge. histopathology scores indicated that neither of the platforms abrogated early-stage disease symptoms induced by a heterologous challenge virus. both show improvement relative to previous studies with infected, unvaccinated mice (17) the 3526 platform exceeded the limited efficacy of V3014 in heterologous challenge. V3526S (blue)-vaccinated mice for airway disease, vascular cuffing, pneumonia, and diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Error bars indicate standard deviation (SD) lung pathology showed little evidence of denuded airway cells or airway debris. animals that received V3014S or VRP-HA showed severe airway inflammation with a denuding bronchiolitis with accumulation of apoptotic debris. peribronchovascular cuffing characterized by high numbers of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages. representative H&E-stained lung sections harvested 4 days postinfection from indicated vaccine groups showing lungs, alveoli, and airway vasculature at lower (40) and higher (400) magnification. note clean airways in V3526S and VRP-HA groups, as indicated by green arrows. protection in young mice and aged mice correlates with antibody response. V3526S-vaccinated sera from young mice and aged mice indicate augmented specific IgG production and skewing toward IgG2A. ELISA results showed IgG titers to S protein, elicited in young mice following vaccination with V3000S (black), V3526S (blue), V3014S (gray), or control VRP-HA (dashed), in young mice (E) and aged mice (F) 0.001 (Student's t test) relative to V3000S and V3526S. PRNT50 analysis indicated that V3526S elicited high neutralizing antibodies in young mice. PRNT50 titers were found to be 3-fold lower in V3014S-vaccinated animals (1:286) the system uses the sequence of the wild-type VEE 3000 virus. the structural glycoproteins (GPs) for VRP 3526 have a deletion in the furin cleavage site in E3 (56RKRR59) this mutation restores efficient growth in BHK cells and prevents reversion to virulence through other secondary mutations. two stocks of VRP 3526 replicons expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) were used to infect Vero cells. after first passage, only a few GFP-positive cells and no CPE were observed. after the second passage, only a few GFP-positive cells and no CPE were observed. the final passage showed no evidence of GFP or CPE. two independent experiments showed that V3526S produced amounts of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein similar to those of V3000S. noV VLPs derived from BSL2 V3526-VP1 or BSL3 V3014-VP1 were indistinguishable from each other in morphology. particle microstructure integrity was comparable between the 3525 and 3014 VRP platforms based on ligand binding. groups of young mice were vaccinated and boosted 3 weeks later with 1 105 IU of each VRP vaccine and a control VRP 3000 HA (VRP-HA) encoding influenza H1N1 hemagglutinin. blood was collected at 21 days postprime, and 3 weeks postboost animals were challenged with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV. the V3526S platform produced protection similar to that of wild-type V3000S and V3014S following homologous challenge. percent weight loss (A) and survival curve (B) of young mice immunized with S protein-based vaccines from V3000S (black; n = 11), V3526S (blue; n = 11), V3014S (gray; n = 11), or control. VRP 3526 vaccine offers protection from heterologous challenge. previous work had shown only modest efficacy of the V3014 platform relative to V3000 following heterologous CoV challenge. VRP 3526 vaccine platform protects aged mice from lethal SARS-CoV challenge. groups of 1-year-old animals were vaccinated and boosted with 1.0 105 IU of each VRP-S vaccine or control (VRP-HA) both V3526S and V3000S protected aged mice from severe SARS-CoV. animals that received V3014S lost greater than 20% of their body weight 4 days postinfection, died, and/or were euthanized. virus replication was cleared by day 4 postinfection in V3000S- and V3526S-vaccinated aged animals. 105 PFU of SARS-CoV MA15 titers at 2 days postinfection. V3000S (black; n = 10), V3526S (blue; n = 12), V3014S (gray; n = 6), or control (VRP HA; dashed; n = 7) challenge with 105 PFU. vaccines elicited high IgG response to S glycoprotein in young animals. the V3526S platform elicited serology responses that were equivalent to those measured with V3000S. it may contribute to reduced protection of young animals from SARS-CoV-induced disease. ELISA results show IgG titers to S protein elicited in young mice. elicited in young mice following vaccination with V3000S (black), V3526S (blue), V3014S (gray) or control VRP-HA (white) a neutralizing immune response developed after vaccination with the V3256S vaccine. DISCUSSION Alphavirus replicon particles based on wild-type VRP 3000 or the attenuated VRP 3014 surface coats are highly successful vaccine platforms (15, 17, 24, 25) the attenuated VRP 3526 platform overcomes these safety concerns. incorporating mutations within the backbone and helper constructs, the platform overcomes these safety concerns and allows manipulation at BSL2. the new platform improves on an invaluable tool needed to study determinants of antigenic drift and escape. the 3014 platform had previously been shown to fail (17), challenge with GD03-MA15 resulted in reduced weight loss, viral replication, and disease in mice vaccinated with V3526S. the safer platform outperformed the 3014 platform, providing protection following both homologous and heterologous CoV challenges. zoonotic diseases have posed a significant threat to global public health. the attenuated VRP 3526 system provides an opportunity to use this resource at a lower biosafety level. rMA15 GD03-S was derived from an MA15 molecular clone by replacing the MA15 Urbani spike with the GD03-S glycoprotein encoding the Y436H mouse-adapted S mutation. rMA15 differs from the epidemic strain SARS-CoV Urbani in 6 amino acids. 000, 3014, or 3526 coat were constructed as previously described. genes encoding the capsid and envelope proteins were synthesized from BioBasic, Inc. and were inserted into pSMART vectors. amplicon containing the S gene was digested with ApaI and PacI. animal immunizations performed under BSL2 conditions. animals were anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine mixture and infected with 105 PFU of rMA15 virus or rMA15 GD03 S in a 50-l volume. pathology from H&E-stained sections were blind scored for clinical disease features. the norwalk virus ORF2 gene was inserted directly into the VEE virus replicon vector for the production of VRPs. each step was followed by washing with PBS\u20130.05% Tween 20. all antibodies were diluted in 5% dry milk in PBS\u20130.05% Tween 20. each step was followed by washing with PBS\u20130.05% Tween 20. nonparametric Mann-Whitney or Student's t tests were performed to generate P values as noted in the text. the animal study protocol followed in the manuscript was approved by the IACUC. rMA15 GD03-S was derived from an MA15 molecular clone by replacing the MA15 Urbani spike with the GD03-S glycoprotein encoding the Y436H mouse-adapted S mutation (17). vero E6 cells were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% FetalClone II (HyClone, South Logan, UT) and gentamicin- five-week-old mice were primed and boosted with 105 infectious units (IU) of the VRPs. lysates from cells infected with VRP 3526 S or VRP 3000 S were probed. mice were monitored for 7 days after prime. animals were anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine mixture and intranasally infected with 105 PFU of rMA15 virus or rMA15 GD03 S in a 50-l volume. animals that lost >20% of their body weight were euthanized according to the IACUC guidelines. pathology from H&E-stained sections were blind scored for clinical disease features, including airway disease, vascular cuffing, pneumonia, and diffuse alveolar damage. the norwalk virus ORF2 gene was inserted directly into the VEE virus replicon vector for the production of VRPs. s generated from different VRP coats were compared using a Student's t test. a difference was considered significant if the P value was 0.05. a difference was considered significant if the P value was 0.05."}
