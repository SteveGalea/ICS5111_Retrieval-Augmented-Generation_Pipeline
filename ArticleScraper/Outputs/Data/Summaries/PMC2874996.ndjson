{"summary": "the current influenza A virus is known to be sensitive to neuraminidase-inhibitor chemoprophylaxis but has limited diversity at neutralizing antibody binding sites. variations at numerous sites within the influenza A genome are predicted to alter these characteristics, with potentially important consequences for healthcare provision. model-P uses probe and sequence features to build intensity-prediction models that compute maximum likelihood scores for base-calling (9). another approach filters low-confidence base calls from problematic regions (e.g. regions with high mutation rates or repeats), thereby reducing the number of false-positive base calls (10). a perfect match (PM) probe residing in a mutation hotspot may contain mismatches that will have a detrimental effect on its hybridization intensity. if two mutations are found within 20 bp of each other in the alignments, then we need in total four (22) PM probes to encode them. the mean hybridization intensity of the three nearest PM probes to the immediate right of the mutation base (at position 1, 2 and 3), denoted as 1,2,3, and the mean hybridization intensity of the three nearest PM probes to the far right of the mutation base (at position 4, 5 and 6), denoted as 4,5,6. if 1,2,3 4,5,6 and 1,2,3 4,5,6, the query base is likely to be mutated. a majority of neighbourhood PM probes are non-high-confidence calls. unknown error/\u2018N\u2019\u2014All other neighbourhood hybridization profile patterns that do not fall under the previous categories. base queries with hybridization intensity abnormalities are passed to step 2 for further analysis. base queries with hybridization intensity abnormalities are also passed to step 2. true mutations have a signature NHIP type as per described in Figure 2b. for each query base with NHIP of type, we compute the likelihood l that the observed PM probe is indeed the true PM probe of the sample sequence. query bases that have NHIP of type described in Figure 2c are most likely isolated errors caused by poor PM probe quality. we correct the base-calls of these query bases to their respective reference bases (but represented by lower case base calls \u2018a\u2019, \u2018c\u2019, \u2018g\u2019 or \u2018t\u2019) RNA isolation and amplification of patient isolates Viral RNA from the diagnostic swabs or RNA extracted from MDCK cell cultures was extracted using the DNA minikit. a perfect match (PM) probe residing in a mutation hotspot may contain mismatches that will have a detrimental effect on its hybridization intensity. profiles belonging to true non-mutations (wild-type), true mutations, isolated errors/\u2018N\u2019s, long consecutive errors/\u2018N\u2019s, and unknown errors/\u2018N\u2019s are also high-confidence calls. the mean hybridization intensity of the three nearest PM probes to the far left of the mutation base must be 1.4-fold that of its MM probes. if 1,2,3 4,5,6 and 1,2,3 4,5,6, we say this is a dip pattern. a majority of neighbourhood PM probes are non-high-confidence calls. hybridization intensity reduction order is b1b2b3b4. we compute the likelihood ratio of fobs and frand. b1b2b3b4 is the probability of observing the hybridization intensity reduction order b1b2b3b4 by chance. we define the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a probe as the ratio of the mean to the standard deviation of the intensities of the nine pixels associated with the probe. in our experiments, we found that >95% of all probes had SNR less than TSNR. the remaining 5% of probes with SNR TSNR are unreliable. the query base results in a strong mutation call (represented by upper case base calls \u2018a\u2019, \u2018c\u2019, \u2018g\u2019 or \u2018t\u2019). otherwise, they are re-assigned an unknown \u2018N\u2019 call. lf that the observed PM probe is indeed the true PM probe of the sample sequence given the hybridization intensity-based ordering of its MM probes in the forward strand. if the PM probes in both strands are complementary and lf, lr > 2, the query base results in a strong base call. the remaining 5% of probes with SNR TSNR are unreliable. base queries with one or more probes with SNR TSNR are also passed to step 2. l > 1, the query base results in a mutation call with weak support. otherwise, they are re-assigned an unknown \u2018N\u2019 call. MM probes in both strands are complementary and lf, lr > 2, the query base results in a strong base call. if lf > lr and lr > 2, a base call with weak support is made from the PM probe in the forward strand. otherwise, they are assigned an unknown \u2018N\u2019 call. ling probes spanning the entire genome segments on both the forward and reverse strands were created at one base resolution (8). analysis of the sequence alignments revealed that there were no deletions, insertions or recombination. however, we found 36 mutation hotspots in the alignments where mutations occurred near one another. additional probes were added to ensure that we have accurate sequence of the drug binding pocket targeted by NA inhibitors (13) product labelling, hybridization and scanning, signal intensities for each probe was generated using Genepix 4.0 software. the standard Nimblescan software employs a gain-of-signal approach. the PBC algorithm assumed that the signal intensity of the PM probe (which matches exactly to the sequence in the sample) will be significantly higher than that of the MM probes. in total, of the expected 13 588 bases of the H1N1 virus the microarray called 13 449 bases while capillary sequence was able to call 12 832 bases. the NHIPs of these 10 true-mutation calls are very different from NHIPs of wild-type calls. NHIPs for all 10 identified true-mutation calls from patient sample 380 appear haphazard (Figure 5). however, when we trace the locations of these errors and \u2018N\u2019 calls, we found that some are isolated among good calls while others are conjugated in a small locality of the genome. this representative set consists of two unknown error/\u2018N\u2019 calls randomly selected from each segment. the observed NHIPs for all three identified isolated error/\u2018N\u2019 calls from patient sample 380. hybridization intensity reduction orders found in two replicated hybridization experiments of patient sample 380. we can compute the likelihood that the putative base call for a query base with ambiguous signals is correct. we can recover base calls of ambiguous query bases exceeding a reasonably high likelihood threshold. high quality sequence calls are made when the signal from the PM probe for both forward and reverse strands is at least 40% higher than that of the MM probes. the second-step processes the ambiguous bases. for bases confirmed to be mutations through NHIP analysis, they are graded as high quality sequence calls and denoted in the FASTA sequence in lower case characters. the genome coverage attained by EvolSTAR (99.02 0.82%) is much higher than that of Nimblegen PBC (94.3 6.06%). comparison of calls made by EvolSTAR and PBC for 14 samples Sample Program Rep.

EvolSTAR generates sequence calls of high accuracy and reproducibility. it generates a visualization map using a heat map based on the percentage identity of the called sequence to the reference sequence measured at 50 bp windows. locations of all mutation calls are denoted by red triangles beneath the heat map bar. with coverage 90% are automatically flagged as 'low coverage' with coverage 90% are automatically flagged as 'low coverage' up to 8 coverage of the regions comprising the 36 mutation hotspots and 10 drug-binding sites (Supplementary Data File 2). optimization of RT\u2013PCR primers and conditions Due to the small amount of virus present in samples relative to human or cell-line total RNA, it was necessary to amplify the viral RNA through PCR. NHIP due to the use of tiling probes in resequencing arrays, a single nucleotide mutation at a particular query base could cause a dramatic reduction in hybridization intensities of neighbouring PM probes up to six bases away (14). a single nucleotide mutation at a particular query base could cause a dramatic reduction in the hybridization intensities of neighbouring PM probes up to six bases away (14). the presence of a mutation at the query base caused a drop in hybridization intensities. the closer this mutation is to the centre of a neighbouring PM probe, the bigger the drop in hybridization intensity. this results in a distinctive dip to the immediate left and right of the centre where the mutation is. long chains of consecutive error and \u2018N\u2019 calls often have NHIPs where the PM probe of the query base together with neighbouring PM probes, have poor hybridization differentiation with their MM probes. NHIP analysis showed that all true mutation calls had a characteristic profile that differed from wild-type sequence calls. to build the likelihood model, we first determined the substitution bias on our platform by comparing the PM and MM probes of both strands. for each true call, we generated a hybridization intensity reduction order by ranking the PM and MM probes of a particular strand in decreasing order of hybridization intensity and recording their respective frequencies.
