{"summary": "79 cases were found in 2007 in a county hospital in Xinyang City, henan province. patients with similar clinical symptoms were reported with human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA; Anaplasma phagocytophilum) only 18 of 79 (22.7%) patients were positive for A. phagocytophilum. the disease was initially considered at least partly caused by A. phagocytophilum. virus culture often fails because of lack of cell lines capable of supporting propagation of viruses. virus culture often fails because of lack of cell lines capable of supporting propagation of viruses (e.g., hepatitis B and C virus) new bunyavirus is associated with FTLS through high-throughput sequencing. subsequent culture of the virus and PCR detection of the specific virus in patient specimens confirmed these findings. biosafety Given the serious nature of FTLS, it was decided to handle all clinical specimens. fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Fc) was purchased from Sihuan Sci-Technics Company (Beijing, China) sample processing for Illumina sequencing Equal quantities (100 L) of acute-phase sera from 10 FTLS patients who had a history of tick bite were pooled and centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 minutes. random hexamer PCR was carried out in a 25-L mixture containing 4 L of cDNA or DNA, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 100 M dNTPs, 1 U Taq DNA Polymerase. targets were amplified by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 40\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 50\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and 72\u00b0C the sequencing procedure was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. template library DNA was hybridized to the surface of the flow cells. multiple copies of DNA were made to form clusters using the Illumina cluster station. RT-PCR detection of the bocavirus Our mass sequencing data revealed a 168-bp sequence (C361, Accession: HQ412604) indicating the possible presence of a novel virus with closest identity (i.e., lowest E-value) to Tehran virus which belongs to the Phlebovirus genus of the Bunyaviridae family. PCR was carried out in a 25-L mixture containing 4 L of cDNA, 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 100 M dNTPs, 1 U Taq Pol (Promega, M1661), 0.25 M forward primer, and 0.25 M reverse primer. thermocycling conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 4 minutes (denaturation), followed culture supernatant, virus-infected cells (50 mL) were mixed 11 with 4% glutaraldehyde (paraformaldehyde), placed onto Formvar-carbon-coated grids, and stained with 1% methylamine tungstate. specimens were prepared by dehydrating washed cell pellets with serial dilution of acetone and embedding in epoxy resin. phylogenetic analyses were performed using the neighbor-joining method. available nucleotide or protein sequences from known viruses were obtained from GenBank for inclusion in the phylogenetic trees. FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG diluted 140 in buffer containing Evans blue was added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes. slides were mounted in glycerin and examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Fc) was purchased from Sihuan Sci-Technics Company (Beijing, China) samples of acute-phase sera from 10 FTLS patients who had a history of tick bite were pooled and centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 minutes. DNA and RNA extraction DNA was extracted from 140 L of each sample using the QIAamp DNA mini random hexamer PCR was carried out in a 25-L mixture containing 4 L of cDNA or DNA, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 100 ng of random hexamer primers. targets were amplified by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 40\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 50\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and PCR enrichment was performed, and 150\u2013180-bp fragments were collected for sequencing by the Illumina method. the sequencing procedure was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina) sequences assigned to the same virus family were further assembled into contigs with Velvet 1.1.04 (K-mer length = 21; coverage cutoff: default 0; minor contig length: 42) an E-value cutoff of 1105 was applied to both BLASTn and BLASTx analyses. some sequences showed possible infection with human bocavirus, which belongs to the Parvoviridae family. PCR was carried out in a 25-L mixture containing 4 L of cDNA, 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 100 M dNTPs, 1 U Taq Pol (Promega, M1661), 0.25 M forward primer, and 0.25 M reverse primer. each sample underwent at least three cell culture passages in Vero E6 cell line before being considered negative virus-infected cells (50 mL) were mixed 11 with 4% glutaraldehyde (paraformaldehyde), placed onto Formvar-carbon-coated grids, and stained with 1% methylamine tungstate. specimens for thin-section electron microscopy were prepared by dehydrating washed cell pellets with serial dilution of acetone and embedding in epoxy resin. Phylogenetic analysis Phylogenetic analyses were performed using neighbor-joining method. available nucleotide or protein sequences from known viruses were obtained from GenBank for inclusion in the phylogenetic trees. 20 L of FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG diluted 140 in buffer containing Evans blue was added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. slides were mounted in glycerin and examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. algia, arthralgia, dizziness, enlarged lymph nodes, muscle aches, vomiting and diarrhea, upper abdominal pain, and relative bradycardia. a small number of cases suffered more severe complications, including hypotension, mental status alterations, ecchymosis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, pulmonary hemorrhage, respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation. laboratory variables Mean (range) Normal range Number of abnormal (%) White-cell count 2.31(2.19\u20132.42) 4\u201311109/L Leukopenia 234 (98.32) Platelet count 58.89(55.26\u201362.51) 100\u2013300109/L Thrombocytopenia 232 (97.48) Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 307.50(256.42\u2013358.58) 0\u201340 U/L Elevated aspart s in FTLS and control pools were 98.08% (10,198,407/10,397,161) and 97.88% (10,250,809/10,472,315). Virus sequences constituted 0.0065% (67,969) and 0.0048% (50,677) of the reads in FTLS and control libraries. some sequences from adenoviridae (human adenovirus), herpesviridae (herpesvirus), papillomaviridae (papillomavirus) and retroviridae (human endogenous retrovirus) were detected in both FTLS patients and healthy subjects. analysis of the deduced protein sequences revealed four different virus families in sera from FTLS patients. among these were viruses from Hepadnaviridae, which are not known to cause FTLS, and Torque teno virus from Anelloviridae, which is not known to be transmitted by arthropods. viruses from the Parvoviridae family, including human bocavirus, could cause febrile illness and signs of FTLS. a phylogenetic tree was constructed using a neighbor-joining method. the result showed that the potentially novel virus clustered with toscana virus, Uukuniemi virus, and Rift Valley fever virus of the Phlebovirus genus. all 10 samples from patients tested positive for the novel bunyavirus. the specificity of the RT-PCR was confirmed by sequencing selected PCR products. none of the 80 sera from patients with respiratory diseases or the 50 sera from healthy subjects was positive using the novel virus-specific RT-PCR. the typical early CPE seen with novel bunyavirus isolates from patients with FTLS is shown in part A (40) infected Vero cells reacted with the serum of a convalescent FTLS patient in an indirect IFA in part C (400) a comparison of these new SFTSV sequences with the sequence of this novel virus showed that they were highly homologous (>99% identity) the three genomic segments of the novel virus, along with the SFTSV sequences, were highly divergent (Figure 1B\u20131E) 238 of 285 patients tested positive for novel bunyavirus infection by RT-PCR and/or IFA. the median age of patients was 57.2 years (range, 23\u201388) and the male-to-female ratio was 1 to 2.27; the male-to-female ratio was 1 to 2.27; 219 patients (92.02%) were farmers and 19 (7.98%) were workers or students. 219 (92.02) Body sores 193 (81.09) Nausea 181 (76.05) Myalgia 165 (69.33) Coarse breathing sounds 170 (71.43) Chill 171 (71.85) Diarrhea 156 (65.55) Dizziness 164 (68.91) Chill 171 (71.85) Diarrhea 156 (56.30) Enlargement of lymph nodes 128(53.78) Cough 119 (50.00) Sput ase(LDH) 532.95(482.72\u2013583.17) 135\u2013225 U/L Elevated lactate dehydrogenase 221 (96.13) Calcium 1.94(1.89\u20131.99) 2.3\u20132.7 mmol/L Low calcium 206 (86.55) Creatine kinase (CK) 53.24(45.82\u201360.67) 0\u201325 U/L Elevated creatine kinase (CPK) 481.66 sample raw reads data valid reads data Reads removed host viruses reads data Patients' Sera 10397161 10198407 3709639 67969 Sera control 10472315 10250809 3449274 50677 Criteria for SOAP including ID80%, E-value1e-2 and Match query0.7. e Alpharetrovirus 651 273 Betaretrovirus 337 Deltaretrovirus 289 87 Gammaretrovirus 166 568 Epsilonretrovirus 37 *Bold indicates virus families only found in FTLS patient sera. some sequences from adenoviridae (human adenovirus), herpesviridae (herpesvirus), papillomaviridae (papillomavirus) and retroviridae (human all family Bunyaviridae sequences detected in FTLS samples were assembled and their protein sequences were deduced. one fragment showed the greatest similarity to human bocavirus 2 isolate 53044 (identity = 86%) with the lowest E-value (81017). Phylogenetic trees were generated by comparing the translated amino acid sequences of individual sequence reads to the corresponding sequences from known bunyaviruses. the horizontal-line distance represents the number of sites at which the two compared sequences are different. RT-PCR revealed the presence of RNA for the novel bunyavirus in all four virus strains. the typical early CPE seen with novel bunyavirus isolates from patients with FTLS is shown in part A (40) the deduced amino acid sequence of the L segment had the highest homology to RNA polymerase of the Uukuniemi virus. the M segment had the highest homology (26%, E value = 81055) to glycoprotein genes of the Punta Toro virus in the Phlebovirus genus. of 95 patients from whom paired acute- and convalescent-phase sera were available, 52 had seroconversions and 21 had greater than 4-fold increases in antibody titer to the virus. six had less than a 4-fold increase in antibody titer to the virus, but all paired sera tested positive. bocavirus from the Parvoviridae is not likely involved in FTLS. bocavirus from the Bunyaviridae family is closely linked to vector activity. tick-borne viruses are more common in the late spring and late summer when tick activity peaks. a 168-bp fragment of the polymerase gene was used as the sequence of the unknown virus. this virus sequence was detected in all 10 pooled samples, indicating that the virus is involved in FTLS. a phylogenetic analysis of the genome sequence showed that this virus clustered into the Phlebovirus branch but was divergent from other known phleboviruses. we compared the sequences of SFTSV with those of FTLSV. we found that they were nearly identical (>99% identity). the most distinctive feature of the current work includes the use of an unbiased metagenomic approach for viral pathogen discovery. serial dilutions of in vitrobtranscribed bunyavirus RNA sequences tested. a wide linear range was detected in this assay."}
