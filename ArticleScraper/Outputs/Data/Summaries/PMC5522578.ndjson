{"summary": "the majority used a quasi-experimental study design with pre- and postintervention knowledge assessment questions, surveys of learners, or chart review with post-antibiotic prescription audit as methods of evaluation. the 2 analysis was used to measure pre- and postintervention differences (Microsoft Excel). students answered questions in 3 primary domains: general antibiotic use, microbiology and testing, and prescribing using the local antibiogram. questions were adapted from a previously published study by abbo et al [3] assessment Before the first lecture, we distributed an antibiotic pretest with 3 multiple-choice questions on common clinical scenarios. a premeeting survey evaluated fellows\u2019 existing participation in AS and IPC. a 4-month QI initiative was designed to enable internal medicine faculty to serve as ASP extensions (stewardship liaisons) to offer antibiotic recommendations to floor teams without providing direct patient care. stewardship liaisons systematically screened all patients initiated on empiric antibiotics upon admission to 2 geriatric units using postprescription audit. in year 1 (2014), students answered questions in 3 primary domains: general antibiotic use, (2) principles of microbiology and testing, and (3) prescribing using the local antibiogram. in year 2 and 3 (2015 and 2016), students downloaded a smart phone application (app) named, \u201cAPPropriate Use\u201d. students answered questions in 3 primary domains: (1) general antibiotic use, (2) principles of microbiology and testing, and (3) prescribing using the local antibiogram. questions were adapted from a previously published study by abbo et al [3]. a video describing the patient safety seminar can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch\"v=p8zYBuOc8VY. students participated in an anonymous, voluntary survey evaluating the program. medicine residency program consisting of recurring, 50-minute, case-based lectures on the recognition and management of typical inpatient infections (eg, community-acquired and healthcare-associated pneumonia, urinary tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, etc.) a hospital antibiogram and a syndrome-based pocket antibiotic prescribing guide were distributed. the second half-session addressed 5 challenging AS scenarios, including drug shortages and conflict resolution with the \u201cobstinate\u201d prescriber. Fellows answered multiple-choice questions using ARS (Turning Technologies). solutions were discussed openly with a panel of experts from area hospitals (hospital Epidemiologists, ID pharmacists, and infection preventionists) a 4-month QI initiative was designed to enable internal medicine faculty to serve as ASP extensions (stewardship liaisons) to offer antibiotic recommendations to floor teams without providing direct patient care. stewardship liaisons systematically screened all patients initiated on empiric antibiotics upon admission to 2 geriatric units using postprescription audit. cases were then discussed with ASP, and recommendations on regimens, dose adjustments, or additional management were conveyed to the floor teams. the APPropriate use app was the preferred source of antibiotic information for 69% of students surveyed. the app hits peaked at 330 in the immediate time frame after the February 2016 session. only 23% of students felt either \u201cvery comfortable\u201d or \u201csomewhat comfortable\u201d using PPE. posttest results showed a significant improvement in PPE proficiency and knowledge of HAI bundles. antibiogram orders of 104 unique prescribers were audited for appropriateness, with an average of 4 orders per resident per year. 104 unique prescribers were audited for appropriateness, with an average of 4 orders per resident. the \u201cSpecialized\u201d Learner: Infectious Diseases Fellows On average, 25 ID fellows attended the course annually, or >95% of second- or third-year ID fellows. more than half expressed a professional interest in an IPC or AS career after fellowship.

DISCUSSION The IDSA suggests real-time electronic question-answer sessions, peer instruction, and small group discussions as tools to enhance preclinical curricula in ID. APPropriate Use app was downloaded onto over 200 devices and accessed over 1200 times within the first 6 months of introduction. stewardship tools can aid experienced, non-ID clinicians select appropriate antibiotic regimens for complex, elderly patients. challenges include time constraints, long-standing prescribing behaviors, staff turnover, and emphasis on individual patients over aggregate outcomes. limitations Strategies presented herein share common themes and lessons learned. we did not conduct an educational needs assessment before study implementation. interventions were designed based on perceived educational needs extracted from daily interactions with learners. Approximately 70% uptake of antibiotic recommendations Internists can serve as trained extensions of AS Abbreviations: app, application; ARS, audience response technology; AS, antimicrobial stewardship; EMR, electronic medical record; ID, infectious diseases; IPC, infection prevention and control. a baseline audit of patient characteristics and antibiotic prescribing on the geriatric units was not conducted before stewardship implementation. unadjusted length of stay observed during the pilot was likely due to other factors in addition to ASP intervention. IPC Small group sessions, team-based activities, case-based modules Pre- and postintervention surveys, multiple choice knowledge assessment questions Annual 2-hour seminar since 2015\u20132016 Improved understanding of transmission-based precautions and related PPE Empower preclinical learners with tools of infection prevention and patient safety Postgraduate education Recurring case-based ID lectures, pocket antibiotic prescribing cards, antibiograms. a majority of local ID fellows attended our AS and IPC workshop. the study was not powered to demonstrate statistically significant differences in pre- and postsurvey responses. past course attendees have not been surveyed to determine the role of AS and IPC in their current careers.
