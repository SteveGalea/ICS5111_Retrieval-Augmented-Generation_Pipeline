{"summary": "in 70% of infected individuals, the virus persists and progresses to chronic liver diseases, including fibrosis, steatosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV is a major cause of type I mixed cryoglobulinemia, which occurs in 10% of patients. viral RNA is first sensed by cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and the PRR-mediated recruitment of adaptor proteins and the activation of downstream signaling lead to IFN production. viruses have developed elaborate strategies to escape the IFN antiviral system by blocking the expression or antiviral functions of IFN. retinoic acid-inducible gene 1-like receptor (RLR) leads to type I IFN synthesis and the toll-like receptor (TLR), resulting in the expression of a variety of effector ISGs. this review provides a perspective for a better understanding of the anti-HCV mechanisms of IFN and several critical cellular determinants known to contribute to the regulation of innate immunity. genotypes 1 through 7 differ by 20%\u201335% in genome sequence. subtypes within each genotype can differ by least 15%. heterogeneity of HCV genotypes also translates to differences in the manifestation of liver disease. HCV infection has led to substantial improvements in sustained virological response rates in genotype 1-infected patients. however, the use of these drugs may allow selection of resistant variants if direct-acting antiviral monotherapy is adopted. the HCV genome, which consists of a 9.6-kb open reading frame with 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTRs, is translated using an IRES to produce a polyprotein of approximately 3000 amino acids. cellular and viral proteases mediate the proteolytic cleavage of the polyprotein into three structural proteins, core, E1 and E2, and the non-structural proteins p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, the LVP is translocated to the tight junction of hepatocytes where the LVP binds to the tight junction proteins claudin-1 and occludin followed by internalization of the HCV particle via pH-dependent endocytosis. acidic pH in the endosome triggers fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane, allowing the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. all HCV NS proteins except for NS2 are involved in viral RNA replication. the NS proteins are colocalized with the replicating viral RNA on a light density, detergent-resistant cytoplasmic membrane structure termed a \u2018lipid raft' nascent virus particles associate with ApoB, ApoE and other low-density lipoprotein lipids to form LVPs. p7 plays numerous crucial functions in virion assembly and egress. p7 modulates membrane permeability to facilitate virus entry. IFN- and IFN- combat viruses directly by inhibiting virus replication or indirectly by inducing the innate immune response. most cell types can elicit a type I IFN response by activating the TLR, RLR and JAK\u2013STAT pathways. the viral dsRNA intermediate synthesized during viral replication is sensed by and activates the RIG-I and TLR 2 signaling pathways. Upon binding to dsRNA, TLR interacts with its associated adapter protein TRIF and recruits TRAF, TBK1 and IKK, thereby transmitting signals downstream to phosphorylate IRF3. TYK2 and JAK activate and phosphorylate STAT1 and STAT2 to form a heterodimer, which recruits IRF9 to form the ISGF3 complex that translocates into the nucleus to activate the transcription of various ISGs. Upon virus infection, TLRs and RLRs operate through different signaling pathways. TLR7 recognizes the urine-rich ribonucleotide region of RNA. TLR9 senses DNA PAMP motifs encoding CpG dinucleotides. Upon binding to a PAMP, TLR3 dimerizes and initiates binding of its cytosolic Toll-IL-1 receptor to the adaptor protein Toll-IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor. in turn activates NF-B through phosphorylation, polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of its associated inhibitor IB. TRIM25 mediates the ubiquitination of RIG-I at position Lys-. the interaction between RIG-I and MAVS promotes the formation of a signaling complex that recruits and activates the downstream classical IKK complex, IKK/IKK, and two non-classical IKK-related kinases, TBK1 and IKK. 75,76 Activation of TBK1 and IKK leads to the phosphorylation, dimerization and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor IRF3. ISGF3 is translocated into the nucleus, binds to IFN-sensitive responsive element (ISRE) and transactivates expression of various ISGs, such as 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylate (2-5A)-dependent, latent endoribonuclease (RNase L), dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) and IRF7. HCV-mediated phosphorylation and activation of PKR inhibits downstream target eIF2 and attenuates the expression of ISGs, promoting viral replication. the E2 protein antagonizes the PKR-dependent activation of host eIF2, resuming translation. NS4B interacts with STING/MITA to inhibit downstream IRF3 signaling. core protein is involved in the formation of the viral nucleocapsid. expression of the full-length HCV genome or core protein downregulates IFN signaling by depressing STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation. expression of core protein induces synthesis of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) in chronically HCV-infected patients. the NS3/4A complex is anchored to the intracellular membrane through the NS4A transmembrane domain and the amphipathic -helix at the NS3 N-terminus. all these domains facilitate cleavage of their two cellular targets, MAVS and TRIF. NS3/4A protease also cleaves TRIF, an adaptor protein linking TLR3 to kinases responsible for activating IRF3 and NF- NS4B phosphorylation occurs at multiple serine residues, such as serine 225, 229 and 232 upstream of the IFN sensitivity determining region (ISDR) of NS5A, which spans residues 237\u2013276 (based on genotype 1b HCV-J strain) NS5A p56 and p58 functions as a pleiotropic protein that modulates the host environment to favor virus replication and persistence. NS5A binds to MyD88, which is a major adaptor molecule in the TLR pathway, and inhibits the recruitment of IRAK1 to MyD88. PKR is an IFN-induced gene product that is activated by binding to dsRNAs commonly produced during viral replication. NS5A increases expression of IL-8, also known as chemokine CXCL8, by upregulating the IL-8 promoter, which in turn inhibits IFN antiviral activity and facilitates virus infection. IL-8 removal mitigates HCV replication. blocking apoptosis could be critical for the establishment of life-long persistence in the host organism. NS5A was shown to block the activation of caspase 3 and to inhibit proteolytic cleavage of the death substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in TNF-induced cells. sies from patients with chronic hepatitis C showed that upregulation of PP2A by HCV can inhibit the enzymatic activity of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) hypomethylated STAT1 is more prone to bind to protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 and inhibits STAT1 dimerization. hypomethylated STAT1 is more prone to bind to protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 and inhibits STAT1 dimer mediated SOCS3 expression is upregulated in chronically HCV-infected patients who are IFN non-responders compared with responders. core protein expression has also been demonstrated to inhibit IRF1 synthesis. many viruses use molecular mimicry as an important immune evasion strategy to promote virus survival and persistence. escort NS3/4A to MAVS on mitochondria88 and cleaves MAVS at Cys-508. NS3/4A-mediated cleavage of MAVS RIG-I signaling impairs IFN synthesis. NS3/4A protease also cleaves TRIF, an adaptor protein linking TLR3 to kinases responsible for activating IRF3 and NF-B. NS2B3 from dengue virus (DenV) acts as a protease to cleave STING. NS4B acts as a protease to cleave STING, thereby shutting down IFN signaling. NS5A is present as two phosphoproteins, the hypophosphorylated p56 and hyperphosphorylated p58. NS5A expression is sufficient to rescue the replication of an IFN-sensitive virus. the interaction of PKR with NS5A requires the ISDR that overlaps a broader PKR-binding region. mutations in or deletion of ISDR correlate with sensitivity to IFN-mediated antiviral activity. the 2-5OAS/RNase L antiviral pathway is present in virtually every cell. NS5A physically binds to 2\u20135OAS through amino acid residues 1\u201340 of NS5A. NS5A inhibits IFN antiviral activity in an ISDR-independent manner. PP2A is a serine/threonine phosphatase that is involved in multiple cellular processes, such as the cell cycle, signal transduction and stress response. increased expression of PP2A has been observed in a cell line inducibly overexpressing HCV protein. HCV-mediated PP2A upregulation enhances NS3 helicase activity by inhibiting PRMT1 enzymatic activity, which in turn facilitates virus replication. in this section, we will highlight the involvement of ISGs that are critical for modulating innate immunity in HCV replication. as DDX58 Inhibition of HCV replication by activating the RLR signaling pathway 72,127 DDX60 Suppression of HCV replication in a RLR-dependent manner 28,129 ADAR Inhibition of HCV replication via RNA editing of adenosine to inosine 148 IRF1 Suppression of HCV replication via modulation of ISRE-mediated ISG expression 132,134 IRF7 Elimination of HCV infection through enhancement of RIG-I V activity by OAS1 p46 and OAS3 170 ISG20 Inhibition of HCV replication by ISG20 through its 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease activity 146,172 IFITM Inhibition of HCV replication by IFITM1 200 Hindrance of HCV entry by disrupting the interaction of HCV coreceptors CD81 and occludin 186 IFIT Restriction of HCV replication by IFIT1. feron sensitivity determining region; ISG, IFN-stimulated gene; ISRE, IFN-sensitive responsive element; mRNA, microRNA; NS, non-structural protein; PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; PKR, dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R; RIG-I, retinoic acid-inducible gene 1; RLR, RIG-I-like receptor; USP18, UBL-specific prote the repressor domain is responsible for downstream signaling and activation of type I IFN after recognition of non-self RNA. without viral stimulation, the CARD interacts with the helicase domain, placing RIG-I in an auto-inhibitory state. 128 DDX60 DDX60 slightly resembles the yeast Ski protein. the RNA exosome exhibit antiviral activity against monkey leukemia virus and Sindbis virus (SINV)129 DDX60 expression is upregulated during infections of measles virus (MeV) and HCV. activated IRF1 regulates the promoter function of IFN/ promoter. it acts as a modulator of many ISGs by binding to the ISRE in the promoter region, thereby regulating viral replication. the IRF7-IRF3 heterodimer is translocated into the nucleus. it binds to the IRF elements in the promoter region of IFN- genes. these events increase the abundance of RIG-I and viral PAMP signaling components. the anti-HCV activity of PKR occurs through its translational control (Table 1).144,145,146. however, viruses have evolved elaborate strategies to counteract the detrimental effects of PKR. HCV employs NS5A and E2 to antagonize PKR function. the inhibitory effect of NS5A on IRES-dependent translation occurs through PKR inactivation. eIF5B is an analog of bacterial IF2 and eIF3 instead of eIF2 and its GTPase-activating protein eIF5 as the initiation factor. many viruses, including HCV, can modulate SG assembly and co-opt SGs to promote their own protein synthesis. 162,163 HCV induces SG formation via eIF2 phosphorylation. these results indicate the importance of eIF2 phosphorylation in SG formation. OAS and RNase L Upon sensing and activation by the PAMP of viral dsRNA, certain IFN-stimulated 2\u20135OAS proteins can synthesize 2-5A from ATP. after binding to 2-5A short oligoadenylates, a ubiquitous, latent endonuclease, RNase L, is activated through dimerization and degrades either cellular or viral RNAs, resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis, ppp-dsRNA or incubated with conditioned medium from LX2 cells stimulated with 5\u2032ppp-dsRNA.125 The two different domains in OAS-like a (OASLa) contribute to the antiviral activity. the N-terminal OAS homology domain impairs cell proliferation and viral replication. ADAR RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR) is constitutively expressed in normal cells as an inactive form. but viral infection triggers the two mammalian ADAR genes, ADAR1 and ADAR2, to express two active proteins. only the ADAR1 transcription level is induced by IFN treatment. cellular mRNA involved in viral replication may also be targeted by ADAR1. the editing of HDV RNA by ADAR1 converts the UAG stop codon to a UIG tryptophan codon. IFIT3 interacts with TBK1, IRF3 and other IFITM members and enhances IFN signaling. 191,192 Lipid raft membranes play vital roles in cellular pathways and in virus entry, assembly and budding. IFIT family The IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) family represents a class of ISGs featured by their unique helix\u2013turn\u2013helix motifs. IFITs mediate a broad range of protein\u2013protein interactions. this study addresses the mechanism by which 2\u2032-O methylation of the 5\u2032 cap of viral RNA renders viruses insensitive to IFIT-mediated host innate antiviral activity. this is presumably by targeting an eIF3-dependent step in viral IRES-mediated translation. ISGylation modulates signal transduction pathways and host antiviral responses. three antiviral effector molecules, IRF3, RIG-I and PKR, are also modified. hepatitis-1 chimeric HCV infectious model found that ISG15 acts as a pro-HCV regulator. increased ISG15/ISGylation facilitates HCV production, whereas blocking ISGylation decreases virus production. knockdown of Ube1L, the E1 activating enzyme, inhibits HCV replication. 224,225 USP18 knockdown is concomitant with increased cellular protein ISGylation, prolonged STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation and enhanced ISG expression, thus greatly enhancing the anti-HCV potency of IFN. all these studies suggest that USP18 disruption can impede its negative regulatory effect on IFN signaling, resulting in sustained JAK\u2013STAT activity and antiviral activity. viperin homologs contain three functional domains: the amphipathic, N-terminal domain, which mediates ER and LD association. the central CxxxCxxC motif, which mediates ER and LD association, and the highly conserved C-terminal domain, which is essential for antiviral activity. 231,232,233 Viperin expression regulates many cellular functions, such as forming LDs and reducing membrane fluidity. viperin enhances human cytomegalovirus infection through its interaction with the viral mitochondrial inhibitor of apoptosis vMIA protein. viperin is upregulated in Huh7 cells transfected with either poly(I:C or HCV RNA,239 and transient expression of viperin in HCV SGR replicating cells significantly decreases HCV replication. cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (CH25H), an IFN-stimulated ISG, can mitigate replication of many membrane-enveloped viruses, including HIV, VSV, HSV and murine -herpesvirus. many pathogenic viruses, such as RVFV, EBOV, Russian spring-summer encephalitis virus harbor class II peptides. studies have shown that RIG-I is essential for eliciting an immune response against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), sendai virus, Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and hepatitis C virus. ubiquitination by Ring finger protein 125 regulates antiviral signals. TRIM25 induces RIG-I to form a tetramer, promoting the CARDs of RIG-I to engage with the CARDs of MAVS. this results in the accumulation of MAVS on the mitochondrial membrane and the activation of IKK and TBK1. ubiquitination by TRIM25 also prevents CARDs from interacting with the helicase domain. dsRNA knockdown reduces the expression of type I IFN after HCV, HIV and YFV infections.28,129 DDX60 is essential for type I IFN expression during DNA virus infection. RF1 overexpression in these cells increases ISRE activity and attenuates HCV replication. however, HCV may evade the IRF1 anti-HCV effect through core-mediated suppression of IRF1 synthesis. IRF7 deficiency represses the induction and accumulation of IFN-, thus favoring WNV replication. 140 PKR PKR, which is also known as EIF2K2, is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates eIF2 in response to virus infection. HCV can activate PKR and eIF2 phosphorylation to enhance its own viral protein translation (Table 1).151,152 Compared with other previously studied dsRNAs, domains III-IV of the HCV IRES were shown to bind to the N-terminal dsRNA-binding domain of PKR, leading to increased PKR autophosphorylation and activation. down in HCV-infected cells restores ISG expression and enhances the antiviral effect of IFN. these results demonstrate that HCV escapes IFN antiviral activity by promoting the phosphorylation of PKR and inhibiting the production of antiviral ISG proteins. the SG proteins TIA-1, TIAR and G3BP1 have been shown to play a critical role in HCV replication and infectious virus production. the results of Garaigorta et al.156 demonstrated that HCV hijacks PKR phosphorylation-triggered SG formation to downregulate the translation of antiviral ISGs. some members of the OAS family exert antiviral activity independent of RNase L.169 The UA and UU dinucleotides within loops of predicted stem-loop structures in the viral RNA is prone to cleavage by RNase L. yeast RNA exonuclease 4 homolog subfamily has both RNase and DNase activities. 173 ISG20 overexpression restricts infection by encephalomyocarditis virus, VSV, influenza virus (INFV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), YFV, picornavirus and HCV. only the ADAR1 transcription level is induced by IFN treatment and by pathogen infections. in addition, ADAR1, but not ADAR2, affects the stability of HCV replicon RNA. in HCV SGR replication, IFN- treatment decreases viral RNA replication. IFITMs are topologically located at different intracellular membrane compartments. IFITMs show no inhibitory effects on entry of amphotropic mouse leukemia virus, Machupo virus, Lassa virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. 184,188,199 Amini-Bavil-Olyaee et al.188 demonstrated that the interaction of IFITM3 with VAPA antagonizes the association of VAPA with OSBP. the disruption of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis subsequently impairs the membrane fusion of intraluminal virion-containing vesicles and endosomes. IFIT1 acts as a negative-feedback regulator for Sendai virus-triggered induction of type 1 IFN antiviral signaling transduction. IFIT1/2 preferentially targets mutants of poxvirus, coronavirus, and WNV that lack 2\u2032-O methylation in their viral RNA cap, rendering these mutant viruses unable to replicate. ISG15 is post-translationally attached via its C terminus to the lysine residues of ISGs and to hundreds of target proteins involved in different pathways. 211,214 ISG15, together with its conjugation E3 ligase (CEB1) and its deconjugation enzyme USP18, are in the same UBL pathway. induction of ISG15 expression in NDV-infected cells counteracts the Ub-mediated degradation of IRF3. despite functioning as an antiviral molecule, ISGylation inhibits IFN signaling in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. 222 USP18 can function in both ISG15-dependent and ISG15-independent modes. USP18 binds to IFNAR2 and attenuates the JAK-STAT pathway. thereby negatively regulating IFN signaling. the expression levels of UPS18 and ISG15 increase in liver biopsy specimens from chronically HCV-infected patients who do not respond to IFN-based therapy. however, non-responders express higher levels of ISGs, particularly ISG15, compared with IFN responders. the findings demonstrate that USP18 is an attractive target for development of anti-HCV therapeutics. viperin alters membrane fluidity by interacting with farnesyl diphosphate synthase. induction of viperin into HIV-1-infected cells disrupts lipid rafts, causing viperin redistribution to CD81 compartments. viperin enhances human cytomegalovirus infection through its interaction with viral mitochondrial inhibitor of apoptosis vMIA protein. perin depends on both the N-terminal amphipathic -helix and the C-terminal domain. NS5A normally associates with the human homolog of the 33-kDa vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein (hVAP-33), which is a pro-viral cellular factor. al action of the CH25H gene product is mediated by the ability of its enzymatic product, 25-hydroxycholesterol, to inhibit pH-dependent and pH-independent membrane fusion between cells and viruses. this study shows that IFN can confer an antiviral state to host and/or target cells by inducing a natural oxysterol inhibitor but also suggests that modification of membrane oxysterols can be used as a potential antiviral approach. IFN-inducible proteins 44L and 6, IFITM2, MAPK kinasekinase 14, Moloney leukemia virus 10, nicotinamidephosphoribosyltransferase 1 and unc-84 homolog B display species-specific antiviral effector functions. several ISGs, such as ADAR, can enhance the replication of certain viruses. nitric oxide synthase 2 primarily function as IFN-mediated anti-HCV effectors. the majority of genes identified by Fusco et al. are not transcriptionally activated by IFN. some of these genes exert IFN-mediated antiviral effects at multiple steps of the HCV replication cycle. the anti-HCV activity of SART1 acts by regulating the expression of ISGs, such as MxA, OAS and PKR, either in the presence or absence of exogenous IFN-.248 The anti-HCV activity of SART1 acts by regulating the expression of ISGs, such as MxA, OAS and PKR. this genetic screen links an unappreciated role of RNA processing to control of antiviral immunity. mitophagy 281 IRGM Promotion of HCV viral growth through the interaction of IRGM with autophagy-associated proteins 282 miR-21. IKK HCV can co-opt an intrinsic innate pathway and hijack cellular lipid metabolism to facilitate its assembly. a scavenger receptor type 1 (MSR1) expressed on the plasma membrane of infected and adjacent uninfected cells can bind to dsRNA released from infected cells and mediate its endocytosis and transport to endosomes where the dsRNA is sensed by TLR3. MSR1 acts as a key element for the TLR3-mediated PRR, rendering both infected and uninfected hepatocytes refrac HMGB1 interacts with TLR4 to activate IFN signaling. HMGB1 is present at higher levels in the sera of patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis compared with those detected in control individuals. two laboratories have independently demonstrated that HCV can activate autophagy via ER stress-mediated induction of the UPR and that UPR-autophagy is required for HCV replication. the results demonstrate that HCV hijacks UPR and autophagy to stimulate viral RNA replication by suppressing immune antiviral immunity. a specific mode of autophagy, termed \u2018mitophagy\u2019, was recently reported to play a critical role in HCV replication. a specific mode of autophagy, termed \u2018mitophagy\u2019, was recently reported to play a critical role in the elimination of damaged mitochondria in a parkin-dependent manner. miR-21 was shown to be upregulated in liver samples from hepatocellular carcinoma patients and in HCV-infected cells. cJun and cFos form the AP-1 protein, which binds to miR-21 promoter and activates miR-21 expression. miR-21 also increases production of HIV, VSV and enterovirus 71. adjacent uninfected cells can bind to dsRNA released from infected cells and mediate its endocytosis and transport to endosomes where the dsRNA is sensed by TLR3. MSR1 acts as a key element for the TLR3-mediated PRR, rendering both infected and uninfected hepatocytes refractory to HCV replication. HMGB1 is present at higher levels in the sera of patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis compared with those detected in control individuals. the results of Jung et al.259 may help to elucidate the potential inhibitory action of HMGB1 in HCV propagation. two laboratories have independently demonstrated that HCV can activate autophagy via ER stress-mediated induction of the UPR and that UPR-autophagy is required for HCV replication. these results demonstrate that HCV hijacks UPR and autophagy to stimulate viral RNA replication by suppressing immune antiviral immunity. IRGM knockdown impairs autophagy induced by many viruses, such as HCV, MeV and HIV-1. IRGM knockdown impairs autophagy by interacting with IRGM. miR-21 expression is activated by the PKCe/JNK/cJun and PKC/ERK/cFos pathways. cJun and cFos form the AP-1 protein, which binds to miR-21 promoter and activates miR-21 expression. miR-21 also increases the production of type I IFN and ISG. the majority of studied ISGs mediate IFN antiviral activities. some ISGs function as negative modifiers in the innate immune response. some ISGs seem to act at multiple stages of the virus replication cycle. innate antiviral immune response can identify new ISGs that can be used as markers for predicting the clinical outcome of IFN therapy. emergence of complexity in the highly pleiotropic type I IFN system in HCV infection reveals that the host has evolved to erect multiple checkpoints for anti-HCV innate immune surveillance. further deciphering which ISGs and/or IEGs are induced by IFNs upon HCV infection and the specificity and action of these I"}
