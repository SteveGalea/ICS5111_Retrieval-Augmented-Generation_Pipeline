{"summary": "over 1,200 species of bats exist worldwide, making them the second most species-rich mammalian order. the order is classified into the suborders Yinpterochiroptera and Yangchiroptera, which represent biologically and ecologically diverse species that are distributed globally. bats display several unique biological features that are seemingly incompatible with their high heart rate and metabolism. emergence of zoonotic disease in northern australia in 1994. in two independent spillover events, this novel paramyxovirus claimed the lives of 15 horses and two humans who had contact with infected horses. over the last few years, the incidence of HeV spillover events in Australia has drastically increased. infection by the novel CoV has been reported in the Middle East, Europe, and africa. a highly similar MERS-like CoV from the feces of south africa bats suggests bats may also be a natural reservoir for the MERS-CoV [17] despite their impact, the natural reservoir for these viruses has not been definitively identified. virus was first isolated from humans and commercially farmed pigs exhibiting respiratory and neurological disease. between September 1998 and April 1999, NiV caused the death of 105 humans and the culling of over 1 million pigs in Malaysia and Singapore. RNA specific to both Ebola and Marburg has been identified in a number of fruit bat species. incidence of marburg haemorrhagic fever in mine workers in southern Uganda was attributed to possible transmission from infected bats. bats generally harbour viruses with no clinical signs of disease. bats have developed the ability to coexist with many different viruses, but some of these viruses have proven to be highly lethal in other mammalian hosts. the combination of deforestation of pteropid bat habitat in Southeast Asia between 1997 and 1998 triggered the encroachment of bats into pig farming/fruit growing areas in Malaysia. the four bat genomes now available represent vital resources to the scientific community. the fact that bats harbour such a large number of viruses poses an important question: do these viruses provide any benefit to the host\""}
