{"summary": "radiologic severity may predict adverse outcomes after LRI. but few studies have quantified radiologic severity of LRIs. results were derived from a cohort of patients with PIV-associated LRI. the use of radiologic progression in clinical trials is limited by the fact that qualitative chest radiographic interpretations do not precisely capture degrees of change in radiologic severity. this lack of precision and reliability reduce statistical power and thereby reduce the effectiveness of qualitative interpretations of radiologic severity as an outcome measure in pneumonia trials. a systematic scoring tool, the Radiologic Severity Index (RSI) [14], would predict mortality after lower respiratory tract infection (LRI) we tested this tool in a well-characterized cohort of patients enrolled early in the course of parainfluenza virus (PIV)-associated LRI. the primary objective of this study was to determine whether progression of LRI, as quantified by RSI, could predict mortality. definitions of PIV-associated LRI were defined as the detection of PIV from nasal wash with symptoms of a clinical pneumonia syndrome (fever >38.3\u00b0C, cough, dyspnea and/or hypoxemia) onset of PIV-associated LRI was defined as the first detection of radiologic infiltrates on CXR or CT. pulmonary infiltrates were scored on a three-point scale based on the predominant pattern in that zone: normal attenuation: 1, GGOs: 2, consolidation: 3. In general, CXR infiltrates were considered to be consolidation unless there was clear evidence of interstitial infiltrates. the sum of scores from all six zones gives the final RSI, ranging from 0\u201372. panels (A)-(C) show CXR images from an individual patient in order of increasing severity. panels (D)-(F) show CT images from a different individual patient in order of increasing severity. in secondary analyses, we added RSI scores from RSI-CXR only (RSI-CXR) for the first 30 days after admission and censored patients who were alive at 30 days after LRI. we assumed subjects who only had imaging performed at baseline had RSI values that remained stable throughout the study period or until they died. we used SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) for statistical analyses. patients We conducted retrospective chart review of previously-established cohort of consecutively-enrolled adult patients with hematologic malignancies. patients with PIV URI who presented with or subsequently developed radiologic infiltrates within 28 days of PIV diagnosis in nasal wash. data collection All clinical and oncologic data were collected prospectively from a database of viral infections used in infection control. data collected included demographic information (age, gender, race), underlying malignancy, cancer status (remission, relapse, or refractory), PIV detection in BAL (if performed), presence of BAL co-pathogens, cytotoxic chemotherapy. scores from each zone were added to give the final score, called the Radiologic Severity Index (RSI), which ranges from 0\u201372. dense clusters of nodules on CXR or CT were considered consolidative infiltrates for the purpose of RSI scoring. two senior thoracic radiologists reviewed the RSI literature with two pulmonary investigators (A.S., D.O.) and scored sample CXRs and CTs from a training set to establish a consistent rule-based system for scoring images. the radiologists independently scored all CXR and CT images performed within 60 days of LRI in sequential order. variables significantly associated with mortality with p-values 0.2 were candidate variables in multivariate extended Cox models. in secondary analyses, we replaced RSI with the number of involved zones. we then compared models using RSI with models using the number of involved zones by using the generalized R2 method to determine which model was best. there were no significant differences in age, race, underlying malignancy, remission status, or exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy within 30 days between survivors and non-survivors. only two patients had co-infection with other pathogens detected in BAL fluid; cytomegalovirus was detected in one patient, and herpes simplex virus in the other. 4%) 1 (11.1%) Black 5(9.3%) 0 Hispanic 5(9.3%) 0 Middle Eastern 1(1.9%) 0 Underlying malignancy (n,%) 0.10 Acute lymphocytic leukemia 13 (24%) 0 (0.0%) Acute myelogenous leukemia 14 (26%) 7 (77.8%) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia 4 (7.4%) 1 (11.1%) Chronic myelogenous leukemia 7 (13 p-valuea Days from HSCT to LRI (median, interquartile range) 134 (21\u2013790) 171 (131\u2013335) 0.81b Type of transplant (n,%) 0.22 Autologous 6(26.1%) 2(66.7%) Allogeneic 17(73.9%) 1(33.3%) Source of transplant (n,%) 1.00 Bone marrow 11(47.8%) 2(66.7%) Umbilical cord blood 1( non-survivors had increases in RSI temporally associated with time of death. non-survivors had increases in RSI temporally associated with time of death. RSI remained stable in survivors. RSI was used as a time-varying covariate in both models. the remaining variables were entered into the model with only baseline values. RSI was better at predicting mortality than the number of involved zones. delta-RSI scores were highly predictive of mortality (non-survivors: 33.65.6, survivors: 5.633.6, p0.0001), as were peak RSI scores (non-survivors: 53.213.2, survivors: 18.917.6, p0.0001) but baseline RSI scores were not predictive of mortality (non-survivors: 19.68.8, survivors: 13.314.3, p = 0.22) prediction of 30-day mortality with baseline RSI, peak RSI and delta-RSI with any RSI score. p-value AUC Cutoff value a Sensitivity Specificity Baseline RSI 0.986 (0.931\u20131.044) 0.6232 0.53 0 33% 87% Peak RSI 1.111 (1.044\u20131.182 0.0009 0.92 36 100% 78% Delta-RSI 1.150 (1.062\u20131.247) 0.0006 0.97 19.5 100% Bland-Altman plots for agreement between expert radiologists in (A) RSI, (B) RSI scores restricted to computed tomography (CT) only (RSI-CT), and (C) RSI scores restricted to chest x-ray (CXR) measurements only (RSI-CXR) Pitman-Morgan test for difference in variance p = NS c 95% confidence interval (CI) for upper and lower limits of agreement in: RSI lower limit, (-4.3,-3.5); RSI-CT lower limit, (4.8,5.6); RSI-CT lower limit, (-5.2,-3.2); RSI-CT upper limit, (4.4,6.4); RSI-CXR upper limit, (4.7,5.6) RSI-CXR systematically underestimates RSI-CT at low RSI scores and overestimates RSI-CT at high RSI scores.

RSIb was associated with mortality in our univariate cox regression model.

RSI-CXR systematically underestimates RSI-CT at low RSI scores. delta-RSI and peak RSI were accurate predictors of 30-day mortality. baseline RSI was not predictive of mortality. RSI performed better than traditional qualitative radiologic assessments of LRI severity. delta-RSI had excellent discriminatory ability to predict 30-day mortality. baseline RSI scores were not predictive of mortality after PIV-associated LRI. commonly used clinical risk assessment tools for community acquired pneumonia were primarily developed to predict outcomes using baseline data. mortality in pneumonia can range from 7% in non-immunocompromised inpatients with CAP [33] to >50% in immunocompromised patients with pneumonia [34\u201336]. RSI was a more robust estimate of LRI severity, likely due to RSI\u2019s provision of an estimate of the extent of involvement of each lobe in addition to the number of lobes involved. the high reliability of RSI among readers improves accuracy in the assessment of radiologic severity. the high inter-observer reliability of RSI is due to the granularity of scoring and the ability to capture the entire continuum of radiologic progression from minimal to extensive. more likely to be detected by CT due to cross-sectional imaging. but when infiltrates are dense, CXR is more likely to over-estimate severity due to superimposition of opacities over unaffected lung. however, the addition of RSI-CT scores to RSI-CXR scores improves the predictive power of RSI when using delta-RSI. the lack of radiologic studies in patients who died before follow-up studies could be obtained would also bias our results towards the null hypothesis. our method of imputation ensured that our model likely captured progression of clinical disease. RSI was superior to previous methods to quantify LRI severity due to improved precision and reliability. RSI is a promising tool that offers granular, reliable, precise and informative assessments of LRI severity and is well suited for consideration as part of a composite endpoint of clinical treatment failure in therapeutic trials of pneumonia."}
