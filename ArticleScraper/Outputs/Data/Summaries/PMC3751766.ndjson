{"summary": "studies have shown that nasally administered immunobiotics had the potential to improve the outcome of influenza virus infection. but the capacity of immunobiotics to improve protection against respiratory syncytial virus infection was not investigated before. aims of this study were to evaluate whether viability of Lr05 or Lr06 is indispensable to modulate respiratory immunity. acute lower respiratory tract infections are a persistent public health problem. there have been no significant changes in mortality in the last decades. respiratory infections are still among the primary causes of death worldwide. some studies have centered on whether immunoregulatory probiotic LAB (immunobiotics) might sufficiently stimulate the common mucosal immune system to provide protection in other mucosal sites distant from the gut. LAB treatments were related to an up-regulation of both respiratory innate and adaptive immune responses. lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 (Lr05) and L. rhamnosus CRL1506 (Lr06) in this mice model, we found that orally administered Lr05 beneficially regulate the balance between pro-inflammatory mediators and IL-10 in lung of poly(I:C)-challenged mice. our results suggested that Lr05 is a potent inducer of antiviral cytokines and may be useful as a prophy microorganisms Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 (Lr05) and CRL1506 (Lr06) were obtained from the CERELA culture collection (Chacabuco 145, San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n, Argentina) both strains were selected because their previously reported immunomodulatory capacities [6,12] mice received 108 cells/mouse/day in 50 l of PBS. mice received three doses of poly(I:C) or PBS with 24 hs rest period. IFN-, IFN-, IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations in serum and BAL were measured with commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique kits. protein content was measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) protein assay (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL) cells were washed with RPMI medium supplemented with 100 U/ml of penicillin and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin. cells were then resuspended in a medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum (FCS) cells were counted using Trypan Blue exclusion and then resuspended at an appropriate concentration of 5 106 cells/ml. Virus and infection human RSV strain A2 was grown in vero cells. cells were infected for 2.5 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 700 g for 10 min. cells were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 2.5 h. supernatant was removed, and 1 ml of fresh DMEM medium was removed. monolayers were fixed with 1 ml of ice-cold acetone:methanol. microorganisms Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 (Lr05) and CRL1506 (Lr06) were obtained from the CERELA culture collection (Chacabuco 145, San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n, Argentina) both strains were selected because their previously reported immunomodulatory capacities [6,12] the study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals of the guidelines for animal experimentation of tohoku University, Sendai, Japan. the present study was approved by the Institution Animal Care and Use Committee of tohoku University. Lung injury parameters Protein and albumin content were measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) protein assay (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL) albumin content was determined colorimetrically based on albumin binding to bromcresol green using an albumin diagnostic kit. cells were washed with RPMI medium supplemented with 100 U/ml of penicillin and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin. cells were then resuspended in a medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum (FCS) cell suspensions were pre-incubated with anti-mouse CD32/CD16 monoclonal antibody (Fc block) for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. cells were infected for 2.5 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. after infection, 7 ml of DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum was added. cells were scraped from the flask and sonicated three times, 5 s per time. monolayers were fixed with 1 ml of ice-cold acetone:methanol. plasma washed twice with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (Sigma) for 1 h. us CRL1505 and L. rhamnosus CRL1506 differentially modulate respiratory immunity In order to evaluate the changes induced by nasally administered LAB in the respiratory immune system we determined the levels of different cytokines in BAL. the four nasal treatments used in this study increased the levels of IL-6, IFN- and IFN- in BAL, however concentrations of these cytokines were significantly higher in Lr06- and HkLr06-treated mice. viable (Lr05) or heat-killed (HkLr06) L. rhamnosus CRL1506 nasal administration on the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interferon (IFN)-, IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10 concentrations in broncho-alveolar lavages (A) and serum (B). no modifications were observed in the number of CD3+CD8+ and CD3+CD8+IFN-+ T cells in lactobacilli-treated mice. no modifications were observed in the number of CD3+CD8+ and CD3+CD8+IFN-+ T cells in lungs. no quantitative changes were detected in CD11c+CD11blowCD103+ DCs populations in lungs of Lr06- and HkLr06-treated mice. rhamnosus CRL1505 was more efficient than L. rhamnosus CRL1506 to upregulate the expression of MHC-II in both DCs population. viable (Lr05) or heat-killed (HkLr06) L. rhamnosus CRL1506 nasal administration on lung wet:dry weight ratio, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and albumin and protein concentrations in broncho-alveolar lavages. mice received three doses of poly(I:C) with 24 hours rest period between each administration. al administration of poly(I:C) significantly increased respiratory levels of the pro-inflammatory mediators IFN-, IFN-, IL-6 and TNF- as previously reported. all lactobacilli treatments significantly increased the levels of BAL IFN-, IFN- and TNF- however, Lr06 and HkLr06 were more efficient to enhance the concentration of these cytokines than Lr05 or HkLr05. nosus CRL1506 nasal administration on the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interferon (IFN)-, IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 concentrations in broncho-alveolar lavages. mice received three doses of poly(I:C) with 24 hours rest period between each administration. poly(I:C) challenge also increased the number of pulmonary CD11bhighCD103-MHC-II+ and CD11blowCD103+MHC-II+ DCs compared to basal levels in all the experimental groups. only Lr05- and HkLr05-treated mice showed improved levels of pulmonary CD11bhighCD103-MHC-II+ DCs. lactobacilli improve resistance against respiratory syncytial virus infection. infant mice were nasally treated with Lr05, HkLr05, Lr06 or HkLr06. they then challenged with 106 PFU of RSV. lungs of infected mice were followed for five days after the challenge. effects of viable (Lr05) or heat-killed (HkLr05) Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 (A) and viable (Lr06) or heat-killed (HkLr06) L. rhamnosus CRL1506 (B) nasal administration on resistance against RSV infection. the results represent data from three independent experiments. different letters indicate significant differences (P 0.05). lactobacilli differentially modulate the cytokines response to respiratory syncytial virus infection. viable (Lr05) or heat-killed (HkLr06) L. rhamnosus CRL1506 nasal administration on the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interferon (IFN)-, IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 concentrations in broncho-alveolar lavages. mice were nasally challenged with RSV and BAL cytokines were studied 12 (TN us CRL1505 more efficient to improve the levels of this cytokine than L. rhamnosus CRL1506. viable cells were more efficient to upregulate TNF- than heat-killed strains. no differences were found in IL-10 levels when comparing viable and heat-killed lactobacilli treatments. Lr05, Lr06, HkLr05 or HkLr06 were nasally administered to different groups of mice for 2 consecutive days at a dose of 108 cells/mouse/day. levels of BAL and serum cytokines were studied on day 3. Lr05, Lr06, HkLr05 or HkLr06 were nasally administered to different groups of mice for 2 consecutive days at a dose of 108 cells/mouse/day. lung immune cells were studied on day 3. results represent data from three independent experiments. our previous work demonstrated that the nasal challenge of mice with poly(I:C) significantly alters lungs function and induce lung injuries. wet:dry weight ratio can be observed after poly(I:C) challenge. significantly increased levels of LDH activity as well as protein and albumin concentrations can be found in BAL samples of challenged mice. the results represent data from three independent experiments. pulmonary immune response induced by the nasal challenge with poly(I:C) and effect of nasally administered lactobacilli in that response were next evaluated. respiratory levels of IL-10 and IFN- and levels of both cytokines were significantly higher in lactobacilli-treated mice. the effects of lactobacilli treatments on the production of serum IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, IL-6, TNF- and IL-10 were similar to that found in BAL. the results represent data from three independent experiments. different letters indicate significant differences (P 0.05) lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 and viable (Lr06) or heat-killed (HkLr06) were nasally administered to different groups of mice for 2 consecutive days at a dose of 108 cells/mouse/day. mice received three doses of poly(I:C) with 24 hours rest period between each administration. Lr05, HkLr05 and Lr06 significantly improved the body weight during RSV infection while HkLr06-tretated mice showed no differences when compared to controls. challenge with RSV significantly increased lung wet:dry weight, BAL protein concentrations and LDH activity in infected mice. lung virus titers and changes in body weight were studied on different time points after the challenge. results represent data from three independent experiments. bacilli-treated mice showed significantly higher levels of BAL IL-6, IFN- and TNF- than controls. levels of IFN- and IL-10 were significantly improved by Lr05, HkLr05 and HkLr06 treatments. nasal administration of HkLr06 increased IFN- but not IL-10 production. effect of lactobacilli on production of cytokines induced by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. mice were nasally challenged with RSV and BAL cytokines were studied 12 (TNF-, IFN- and IL-6) or 48 (IFN- and IL-10) hours after the challenge. the results represent data from three independent experiments. poly(I:C) administration elicited the secretion of type I IFNs, TNF- and IL-6 and other cytokines in respiratory epithelial cells [20], therefore a likely source of these cytokines following poly(I:C) administration would have a significant effect on respiratory epithelial cells. it can be speculated that Lr06 may play an important role in the improvement of innate and specific immune responses against respiratory virus. we can speculate that Lr05 is more efficient than Lr06 to stimulate CD103+ DCs and improve Th1 response in the respiratory tract. we previously suggested that IL-10 would be valuable for attenuating inflammatory damage and pathophysiological alterations in lungs challenged with the viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern poly(:IC) [12] nasal priming with lactobacilli has the ability to improve antiviral immunity. we speculate that nasal priming with both lactobacilli would benefitly modulate the immune response against RSV and improve resistance of mice against this viral infection. ating protein-3 (CXCL1), MIP-1 (CCL9), TNF, and eotaxin-2 (CCL24) in response to pneumovirus infection significantly altered lung function, induced tissue injury and triggered inflammatory response. authors described ruffled fur and ataxia that occurred early after hour 12 post-RSV infection and continued for 3 days. no changes in peak viral titers or viral clearance were observed between IL-10 KO or anti\u2013IL-10R mAb-treated mice compared with their controls. we demonstrated that nasal administration of Lr05 or Lr06 improved the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in response to RSV challenge and also the production of IL-10, which would allow an effective immunological clearance of the virus without affecting lung tissue. previously found to cause a shift from Th1 to Th2 cell inflammation. authors investigated production of cytokines by mediastinal lymphoid node cells in mice receiving L. casei Shirota intranasally. authors found that the Shirota strain strongly induced production of IL-12 in these cells. both IFN- and TNF- levels were improved in mediastinal lymphoid node cell cultures from mice administered L. casei Shirota intranasally after influenza virus challenge [15]. intranasal administration of heat-killed L. pentosus S-PT84 strongly enhanced Th1 immunity, IFN- production and NK activity in the respiratory immune system. heat-killed lactobacilli are also effective in immunomodulation of the respiratory immune system in immunocompromised hosts. non-viable immunobiotics or their cellular fractions could be an interesting alternative as mucosal adjuvants, especially in immunocompromised hosts. heat-killed bacteria derived from viable strains with immunomodulatory capacity are also able to functionally modulate the respiratory immune system. authors declare that they have no competing interests. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. the funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript."}
