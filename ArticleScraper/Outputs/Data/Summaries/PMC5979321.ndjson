{"summary": "the burden of CVDs has increased tremendously in developing countries. many acute cardiovascular events, such as acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and myocardial infarction (MI), are due to unhealthy vascular states. however, restoration of blood supply and re-oxygenation paradoxically lead to further exaggeration of tissue injuries and tissue destruction. glucocorticoid-regulated protein Annexin A1 (AnxA1) is the focus of this review. it mimics the body\u2019s own pro-resolution effects while potentially having fewer side effects than existing therapeutic agents. this review aims to highlight the issues associated with I/RI. oxygen species (ROS), increased cell adhesion molecules (e.g., intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)), increased production of lipid mediators including leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and platelet activating factor (PAF) contribute to I/R-associated tissue damage. prolonged occlusion triggers depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and decreases intracellular pH. nds such as components of damaged tissue binding to TLRs lead to activation of downstream signaling pathways, including NF-kappa-B (NF-B), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and type I interferon pathways. recent evidence suggests both antigen-specific and independent mechanisms of activation where T cells accumulate at sites of ischemia and reperfusion. anxA1 is abundantly present in cells of myeloid origin such as neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages. the protein itself was discovered in the 1970s and 1980s by its ability to inhibit PLA2 activity. further anti-inflammatory actions were seen in guinea pig lung models, glucocorticoid (GC)-treated rat models and rat medulla cell experiments. anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects of 37 kDa protein are mediated by the shedding of l-selectin resulting in decreased neutrophil adhesion to the endothelium and restricting transmigration [7]. Getting et al. showed that both endogenous and exogenous AnxA1 were able to inhibit the neutrophil and monocyte recruitment in the murine peritoneal cavity [25] the FPR family is more complex, consisting of at least eight members. mouse Fpr1 shares 77% sequence homology with human FPR1. Fpr2 has 76% homology to FPR2/ALXR. hippocampus, hypothalamus, liver, lung, trachea MURINE Fpr1 Dendritic cells, microglia, mononuclear cells, neutrophils Adrenal gland, anterior pituitary,

monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. evidence suggests that FPR3 plays role in allergic reaction and dendritic cell maturation. formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (HFYLPM), G proteins are activated and trigger the release of several second messengers such as Ca2+ from intracellular stores. in inflammatory states, neutrophil FPRs participate in various biological functions including chemotaxis,

disability-adjusted life-years accounted for eight million deaths worldwide in 2013. AIS evolves locally due to underlying atherogenesis and vasculopathy (thrombotic occlusion) or from a distant embolus arising from the heart (embolic occlusion) TLR4 has been shown to upregulate the expression of cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs and selectins), facilitating neuronal injury. there is a crosstalk between thrombosis and inflammation in cerebral ischemia resulting in a thrombo-inflammatory state. the role of Annexin A1 in AIS AnxA1 has been shown to act in various ways to mitigate cerebral I/RI. our work has shown a significant effect of anxA1 (and its peptide mimetics) on diminishing leukocyte adhesion and trafficking [46], inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic cytokines. anxA1 knock-out (AnxA1/) mice possess a disorganized actin cytoskeleton due to increase in activity of RhoA small GTPase and a disruption of occludin and VE-Cadherin. it is not just blood cells that express Fpr2/ALX, but also brain resident cells such as Microglia [51] the role of Annexin A1 in AIS AnxA1 has been shown to act in various ways ventricular administration of the peptide reducing infarct size and cerebral edema two hours post cerebral ischemia. animals lacking the AnxA1 receptor Fpr2/ALX showed greater BBB leakage post-ischemia than their wild-type counterparts. reperfusion in IHD results in a massive outpouring into the ischemic tissue of activated leukocytes (especially neutrophils) and other mediators e.g., complement fragments, ROS and pro-inflammatory cytokines. a number of interventions have been shown to reduce infarct size up to 50% under experimental MI/R conditions. treatment with anxA1 also attenuated loss of fiber organization, decreased MPO activity, reduced TNF- and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1) levels and leukocyte extravagation in infarcted hearts. exogenous administration of Ac2-26 at the onset of reperfusion increased cardiomyocyte viability and recovery of LV function. Compound 17b (Cmpd17b) attenuates early and late inflammatory responses after reperfusion in MI [64], with ERK1/2\u2013Akt kinases seeming to play a significant role. treatment with anxA1 also attenuated loss of fiber organization, decreased MPO activity, reduced MIP-1 levels and leukocyte extravagation in cardiac tissues [60] anxA1 deficiency results in increased cardiac necrosis, inflammation, hypertrophy and fibrosis resulting in exaggerated cardiac infarct size after eight days of myocardial infarction [63]. these effects were linked to a greater expansion and altered mobilization of HPSC, with increased circulating neutrophils and platelets and altered macrophage inflammatory phenotype and function. renal transplant recipients are under immunosuppressant therapy to prevent graft dysfunction. 3% of kidney transplants will fail within a month of transplantation. 7% within a year and 17% within three years. inflammation plays a major role in renal I/RI due to enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. other cytokines, e.g., IL-6 and TNF-, are released upon renal tubular cell activation. in renal I/RI, neutrophils are the first cells to respond to injury site. some studies have shown that AnxA1 may exert a protective role. e.g., in a rat model of renal I/RI, exogenous administration of peptide Ac2-26 reduced: (a) tubular necrosis; (b) the influx of phagocytic cells (neutrophil and monocytes); (d) GFR, thereby improving functional recovery and outcome. the major side effect of Cyclosporine treatment is nephrotoxicity. exogenous administration of Ac2-26 has been shown to reverse these side effects. diabetes is metabolic syndrome which affects many organs including the kidneys. loss of barrier function facilitates movement of microbiota and their products from the gut to the blood stream. the loss of barrier function facilitates movement of microbiota and their products from the gut to the blood stream. the protective role of anxA1 in GI-Associated I/RI AnxA1 has been shown to play a protective role in gastrointestinal I/RI. anxA1 deficient mice failed to regain weight and showed no improvement in disease activity index and mucosal injury upon withdrawal of disease. the protective role of AnxA1 in GI-Associated I/RI has been shown to play a protective role in gastrointestinal I/RI. the loss of epithelial cell barrier is major characteristic of intestinal I/RI. the effect of anxA1 or its peptides on epithelial cell barrier has not been studied in intestinal I/RI models but they have afforded protection in other gastrointestinal inflammatory murine models. anxA1 deficient mice failed to regain weight and showed no improvement in disease activity index and mucosal injury upon withdrawal of disease. the majority of CVD related complications are due to I/RI. in this review, we focus on anxA1 and its peptide mimetics as possible therapeutic strategies for the treatment of I/RI. anxA1 promotes the balance between pro-inflammatory [7,31,47,58,60,88,90] and anti-inflammatory cytokines. disruption of barrier function due to loss of junctional molecules and apoptosis/necrosis of endothelial/epithelial cells is one of the main characteristics of I/RI."}
