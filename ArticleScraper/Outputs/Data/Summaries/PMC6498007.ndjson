{"summary": "pertussis is an acute, contagious respiratory disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. the bacterium can lead to life-threatening complications in infants and young children. it was documented as one of the major causes of childhood mortality in the 20th century (1). the Aries Bordetella assay can directly detect and differentiate B. pertussis and B. parapertussis from nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal swab samples. the promoter toxin gene targeted by the Aries Bordetella assay confers a high degree of specificity. the evaluation of the Aries BA included assay performance (positive percent agreement [PPA] and negative percent agreement [NPA]) and workflow parameters, including hands-on time (HOT) and turnaround time (TAT) to results. this was a retrospective study performed at a 478-bed tertiary care cancer center in new york city. discordant samples underwent repeat testing on both the Aries and FilmArray platforms. all concordant samples were also tested by bidirectional sequencing. data analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 7.04 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA) all NPS samples that were positive for B. pertussis between 2014 and 2018 were included in the study. fresh FilmArray RP samples that were negative for B. pertussis were randomly selected and collected daily over a 2-week period to cover several days of testing. a total of 300 NPS samples from 297 patients were selected for testing in this study. 73.4% (207/282) were negative for all pathogens detected by the filmArray RP. 26.6% (75/282) were positive for at least one pathogen other than B. pertussis. parainfluenza virus 3, rhinovirus/enterovirus/parainfluenza virus 3) 3 Total 300 TABLE 2.

DISCUSSION In this study, we evaluated the clinical performance of the Aries Bordetella assay for the detection of B. pertussis in an oncology patient population. both the FilmArray RP and the Aries BA target the single-copy gene ptxA for the detection of B. pertussis. two cases of immunocompromised patients diagnosed with B. pertussis by filmArray RP testing performed on NPS samples. both patients were treated with azithromycin but did not improve. bacterial cultures performed on lower respiratory tract samples grew B. bronchiseptica. the Aries BA did not cross-react with the few B. bronchiseptica-positive specimens in our study. however, a larger sample set should be tested to confirm this finding. the hands-on time of the Aries BA was comparable to that of the FilmArray RP."}
