{"summary": "sialic acids (purple diamonds) terminate glycan chains on glycolipids and glycoproteins as part of the glycocalyx on the surface of cells. they can also terminate glycans on secreted glycoproteins, like mucins. the sialate O-acetyltransferase, CasD1, adds acetyl groups to sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid [Neu5Ac modifications include acetyl, sulfo, methyl, and lactyl groups. complex mixtures of Sia forms may be present, with significant variation in both levels and the specific combinations of each modification. common chemical additions include O-acetyl modifications to the C-4, -7, -8, and/or -9 positions. at least one sialate O-acetylesterase (SIAE) enzyme regulates display of 7,9-O- and 9-O-Ac in many cells and tissues. the SIAE gene encodes two isoforms that vary in the presence of a proposed C-terminal localization tag in the lysosomal form (Lse) that is absent from the cytosolic form (12) the presence of 9-O-acetyl Sia modulates immune cell activation and differentiation (15) in B cells, negative regulation of B-cell receptor activation by siglec CD22 is mediated by binding to Neu5Ac-terminated glycan chains on the BCR. the presence of 9-O-Ac, 7,9-O-Ac, and SIAE activity has been linked to autoimmune disorders through the development of autoantibodies. NA is a sialidase which cleaves Sia off glycan chains when it is present in mucus or on the surface of cells. hemagglutinin-esterase fusion protein (HEF) binds specifically to 9-O-acetyl Sia to initiate uptake of the virus into cells. the esterase domain removes 9-O-acetyl modifications, releasing the virus from mucus. RESULTS Expression of 7,9-O- and 9-O-acetyl Sia in cells. there is currently only sporadic information about the expression of modified Sia on commonly used cell lines. we examined cell lines widely used in many experimental systems. in HEK-293 and HEK-293 cells, both 7,9-O- and 9-O-Ac appeared to be localized within the Golgi compartment. similar localization differences between some cell lines have been seen previously using the ICV HEF as a probe. permeabilization (perm) and nonpermeabilization (non-perm) methods were as in immunofluorescence assay staining. cells were permeabilized using 0.001% Tween 20 and imaged at 60 magnification. expression levels of those modified Sia variants were also quantified by HPLC analysis. analysis of conditioned media from A549 cells showed that approximately 2% of Sia was 9-O-Ac on secreted proteins with no 7,9-O-Ac detected. however, it would be worth examining proteins secreted by primary cells from humans or that are present in different tissues, including mucins. ND, not detected; *, primary swine nasal (SiNEC) and tracheal (SiTEC) epithelial cells. total sialic acid collected from cell lines and standards via mild acid hydrolysis. this content is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. the low levels of 9-O- and 7,9-O-Ac detected on HEK-293, A549, and MDCK cells by HPLC could be due to the heterogeneity of the population. however, even on cells expressing higher levels of 7,9-O- and 9-O-Ac, these modified Sia make up a small proportion of the total Sia present in the cell or -O- and 9-O-Ac, glycoengineered cell lines were created by manipulating the expression of CasD1 and SIAE genes. we knocked out CasD1 via CRISPR-Cas9 editing or overexpressed CasD1 via transfection of an expression plasmid. CasD1 clones were confirmed by examining for 7,9-O- and 9-O-Ac display. cells were permeabilized using 0.001% Tween 20 to determine internal expression. cells were permeabilized to reveal both surface and internal expression. HPLC data for total Sia collected from cells by mild acid hydrolysis. we overexpressed the human CasD1 (CasD1-OX) in the CasD1 variants of MDCK-NBL2, A549, and HEK-293 cells. however, only a modest increase in average 9-O- and 7,9-O-Ac expression across the population was seen by flow cytometry. expression levels for HEK-293, A549, and MDCK cells were still seen for 9-O-Ac. this suggests that 7,9-O- and 9-O-Ac expression is not directly regulated by the levels of CasD1 gene expression but may be affected by posttranslational regulation of CasD1 activity. HPLC confirmed the flow cytometry results by showing a small increase in 9-O-Ac levels in HEK-293 cells. HEK-293 cells showed a small but nonsignificant increase in 9-O-Ac levels compared to WT by HPLC analysis. however, HEK-293 cells grew more slowly than either SIAE or WT cells. es of edited cells show frameshifts that lead to stop codons in all cases. cells were permeabilized using 0.001% Tween 20 to show both surface and internal expression. 7,9-O-Ac and 9-O-Ac on influenza A, B, C, and D virus infection. IAV strains, as well as IBV strains B/Colorado/06/2017 and B/Memphis/1/2018, also showed equal infection efficiency on WT MDCK cells compared to CasD1 and CasD1-OX cells. strains to fully recover infectivity may be due to low surface levels of 9-O-Ac Sia on MDCK CasD1-OX cells. these levels were lower than in WT MDCK cells and could be below the receptor levels required for efficient infection by these viruses. this suggests that ICV and IDV are able to utilize the levels of modified Sia on WT MDCK cells as their primary receptors for binding and infection. CasD1-OX cells were inoculated at a high MOI with ICV strains C/Ann Arbor/1/50, C/Taylor/1233/1947, and C/Victoria/1/2011 and IDV strains D/bovine/MS/C000020N/2014 and D/swine/OK/1334/2011. data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA using Prism software. strains were mixed with either untreated mouse erythrocytes or mouse erythrocytes pretreated with esterase active BCV HE-Fc to remove all acetyl modifications. significantly greater hemagglutination was seen for both viruses on the esterase-treated mouse erythrocytes compared to untreated erythrocytes. the profiles for both N1 and N2 VLPs showed a preferential release of unmodified Neu5Ac compared to modified Sia forms. the N1 VLPs did not release any detectable O-acetylated Sia. the N2 VLPs were able to release 9-O-Ac (Neu5,9Ac2) but released significantly less 7-O- and 8-O-Ac. hemagglutinin-esterase proteins (HE) fused to human IgG1 Fc. HE-Fc probe recognizes 9-O-Ac, while BCoV HE-Fc recognizes primarily 7,9-O-Ac. both were mostly found in intracellular locations in HEK-293 and HEK-293. similar localization differences between some cell lines have been seen previously using the ICV HEF as a probe (38). in our studies, there was inherent variability within populations in terms of both level of staining and localization. for example, in MDCK-NBL2 not all cells were positive for 9-O-Ac. in MDCK type I some cells retained more 9-O-Ac and 7,9-O-Ac internally, while others displayed more of the modified Sia on their surfaces. cells were treated at 80 C for 3 h in presence of 2 M acetic acid. levels of 9-O-Ac were 1 to 2% of the total collected Sia from all cells. the levels of 7,9-O-Ac were below the level of detection in all cells. proteins with no 7,9-O-Ac detected, indicating that, at least in these cells, secreted proteins were not enriched for O-acetylated Sia. it would be worth examining proteins secreted by primary cells from humans or that are present in different tissues, including mucins. chromatograms show wild-type HEK-293 cells, A549 cells, MDCK-NLB2 cells, and bovine mucin standard of O-acetyl modifications. the low levels of 9-O- and 7,9-O-Ac detected on HEK-293, A549, and MDCK cells could be due to the heterogeneity of the population. cells expressing higher levels of 7,9-O- and 9-O-Ac make up a small proportion of the total Sia present in the cell or glycocalyx. previous studies have reported that podoplanin (GP40 in canine cells) is a primary carrier of 9-O-Ac on MDCK cells and therefore acts as the main receptor for ICV (44, 45) cells using CRISPR-Cas9 targeting of early exons in the CasD1 gene were confirmed by examining for 7,9-O- and 9-O-Ac display. CasD1 variants showed loss of both 7,9-O- and 9-O-Ac display when probed with different specific HE-Fc probes. HPLC analysis of total Sia showed a significant decrease in 9-O-Ac expression compared to wild-type (WT) cells cells were permeabilized using 0.001% Tween 20 to determine internal expression. most modified Sia are retained internally. cells were imaged at 60 magnification. we overexpressed the human CasD1 (CasD1-OX) in the CasD1 variants of MDCK-NBL2, A549, and HEK-293 cells. we expect expression of CasD1 under a strong promoter in the CasD1 background would increase consistency of the synthesis and display of 9-O- and 7,9-O-acetyl Sia relative to the WT cells. SIAE transcripts were consistently expressed in HEK-293 WT, CasD1 and CasD1-OX cells by qPCR analysis. mRNA levels in CasD1-OX cells were lower than those seen in WT. complete knockout of SIAE was confirmed both by genotyping to show deletions in both alleles and by loss of mRNA by qPCR. HEK-293 cells showed a small but nonsignificant increase in 9-O-Ac levels compared to either SIAE or WT cells. however, HEK-293 SIAE+CasD1 cells grew more slowly than either SIAE or WT cells. this suggests that 7,9-O- and 9-O-Ac may affect cell metabolism and growth rates. qPCR of relative SIAE and CasD1 mRNA expression in HEK-293 WT, SIAE, and SIAE+CasD1 cells compared to GAPDH. data were analyzed by a t test using Prism software. IAV strains, as well as IBV strains B/Colorado/06/2017 and B/Memphis/1/2018, also showed equal infection efficiency on WT MDCK cells compared to CasD1 and CasD1-OX cells. the inability of the ICV and IDV strains to fully recover infectivity may be due to the low surface levels of 9-O-Ac Sia on MDCK cells. HEK-293 WT, CasD1, CasD1-OX cells were inoculated at an MOI of 0.1 with IAV strains pH1N1 (A/California/04/2009) and Victoria H3N2 (A/Victoria/361/2011) the cells were fixed at 24 h, and the infected cells per field were counted. data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA using Prism software. effects of 7,9-O- or 9-O-acetyl Sia modifications on HA binding and NA activity. mouse erythrocytes contain 45% of their total Sia is O-acetylated. mouse erythrocytes contain primarily 2,3-linked Sia. effects of 7,9-O- and 9-O-Ac on IAV HA binding and NA cleavage. data for each Sia variant are given as the percentages of total Sia. data are averaged across three independent experiments. ylated Sia while the N2 VLPs were able to release 9-O-Ac (Neu5,9Ac2) but released significantly less 7-O- and 8-O-Ac (Neu5,7,9Ac3) and were unable to release any 7,9-O-Ac (Neu5,7,9Ac3) ICV and IDV are known to use 9-O-Ac as their primary receptor for cell binding and infection. they are expressed on cells in culture and that expression varies between cell lines. when present these modified Sia made up only 1 to 2% of the total Sia. Sia is added to the growing glycan chain in the Golgi by sialyltransferases. sialyltransferases are synthesized in the nucleus by the addition of cytodine monophosphate to Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc. the majority of glycoproteins with these modifications are retained in the golgi compartment. a deletion and frameshift in CasD1 completely removed both 9-O- and 9-O-Ac expression. the enzyme was responsible for creating both modifications, likely through addition to the C-7 position. none of the cells isolated showed universally higher levels of modified Sia synthesis. however, even in HEK-293 cells, 9-O-Ac still only accounted for 1.5% of total Sia. no increase in 7,9-O-Ac was seen in either SIAE and SIAE+CasD1 cell lines. dysregulation of SIAE and CasD1 by gene manipulation affects cell metabolism. >95% of the Sia is unacetylated Neu5Ac, which can be used by IAV and IBV as a receptor for binding and entry. higher levels, such as those found on mouse erythrocytes, were able to block IAV HA binding and decrease IAV NA cleavage efficiency in a strain-dependent manner. the presence of both 7,9-O- and 9-O-Ac were dependent on the activity of CasD1 and SIAE. the relative proportions, levels of expression, and localization appear to be controlled by more complex mechanisms than simply the expression of CasD1 and SIAE. IAV strains pH1N1 (A/California/04/2009) and Victoria H3N2 (A/Victoria/361/2011) were rescued from reverse genetics plasmids. HE-Fc (PToV HE-Fc) recognizes 7,9-O-Ac and shows low binding to 9-O-Ac (10, 11) cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. HE-Fc probes were prepared as described above with final concentrations of 5 g/ml HE-Fc probe and 1:1,200 of anti-IgG. a flow cytometer was used to collect data, followed by analysis using FlowJo software (v8). cell line mutations and characterization were performed using GraphPad Prism software. cells were cloned, and single-cell clones were screened. qPCR was performed to confirm deletion of the gene. sia composition of cells was determined by incubating with 2 M acetic acid. qPCR of SIAE and CasD1 expression was performed on a Applied Biosystems stepOnePlus real-time PCR system using Fast SYBR green (Bio-Rad) data were analyzed using stepOne software (Applied Biosystems, v2.1) and GraphPad Prism statistical analysis software. the cells were then fixed and stained with a mouse anti-influenza A NP antibody, a mouse anti-influenza B NP antibody (Abcam), a polyclonal mouse anti-influenza C antibody (a gift from Peter Palese, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai), or a polyclonal rabbit anti-influenza D antibody (a gift from Feng Li, South Dakota State University). ins SNA, which binds 2,6-linked Sia, and MAA I, binds 2,3-linked Sia. erythrocytes were then analyzed using flow cytometry. sequences were tagged, codon optimized, and ordered through Biomatik. IAV strains pH1N1 and Victoria H3N2 were rescued from reverse genetics plasmids using established protocols. all ICV strains were grown on MDCK-NBL2 cells using infection media containing DMEM, 0.03% BSA, and 1 g/ml TPCK-treated trypsin. cells were stained using probes derived from viral hemagglutinin-esterase proteins fused to human IgG1 Fc (HE-Fc) the porcine torovirus strain 4 HE-Fc recognizes 9-O-Ac and the bovine coronavirus strain HE-Fc recognizes 7,9-O-Ac. cells were collected using ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; HEK-293 and A549 cells) or Accutase (Sigma, MDCK cells) to retain surface glycans and then fixed in 4% PFA for 15 min. he-fc probes were prepared with final concentrations of 5 g/ml HE-Fc probe. cDNA open reading frame synthesized by bio Basic (Markham, Ontario, Canada) transfected cells were selected with G418, and single-cell clones were screened by PCR amplification of the target gene region. single-cell clones were screened by direct PCR amplification of the target gene region and analysis of the PCR product size. conditioned medium was collected, dialyzed with 3 volumes of PBS. the protein concentration was determined by using a 30-kDa centrifugal filter. qPCR of SIAE and CasD1 expression was performed on a Applied Biosystems stepOnePlus real-time PCR system using Fast SYBR green. fected cells were determined by imaging coverslips and counting cells per field. cells were seeded into 96-well plates and inoculated for 48 h. cells were then fixed and stained with a mouse anti-influenza A NP antibody, a mouse anti-influenza B NP antibody, or a polyclonal rabbit anti-influenza D antibody. 5% washed erythrocytes were blocked for 1 h using 1 Carbo Free blocking buffer (Vector Laboratories) and stained for 1 h with fluoroscein-labeled plant lectins SNA, which binds 2,6-linked Sia, and MAA I, which binds 2,3-linked Sia (Vector Laboratories) edward et al."}
