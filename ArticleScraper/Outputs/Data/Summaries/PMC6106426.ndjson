{"summary": "the GDPM formed an EBS Technical Working Group (TWG). it was formed by stakeholders from the Ministry of Health. the TWG also served on an assessment team and later assisted in disseminating the assessment results to stakeholders. a trainer from a higher administrative level provided mentorship and support. each province received a one-time start-up grant for infrastructural improvements. each province received a one-time start-up grant for infrastructural improvements. we used 3 criteria to select field visit sites. first, we assessed districts that were performing optimally and suboptimally. we defined optimal performance as districts with a signal incidence rate higher than the 50th percentile and suboptimal performance districts. high-priority diseases identified were rabies, avian influenza, vaccine-preventable diseases, cholera, and emerging new diseases. the TWG then drafted a list of signals that could serve as an early indication of the appearance of these priority diseases in the community. surveillance and reporting system improved for event-based surveillance, Vietnam, September 2016\u2013May 2017. the TWG assessed the EBS pilot for timeliness of detection and reporting of events, as well as EBS acceptability and sustainability at all levels. in each province, 2 districts and 2 CHSs per district were selected for site visits and key informant interviews. results The EBS pilot covered 7% of the total population of Vietnam (9) the provinces represented both rural and urban areas. at least 15,000 posters with community signals and reporting information were provided to CHSs. these posters were prominently displayed at public meeting places, CHS, village meetings, and other highly visible locations. EBS pilot assessment received 2,105 acceptability/sustainability surveys from 5 PPMC staff, 39 DHCs, 428 CHSs, and 1,633 VHWs. twenty-four (56%) of 43 districts returned the timeliness data extraction forms. a trained VHW learned that diarrhea and vomiting developed in 2 persons who had attended a wedding party meal on September 25, 2016 at 13:00 hrs. the VHW called the CHS and reported the signal 30 minutes after learning of the episode. the investigation found 93 other affected persons, 38 of whom were hospitalized. from 176 events reported, 40 were excluded for timeliness analysis. signal language should be simplified, including alternatives for medical terms such as \u201csevere,\u201d \u201cdehydration\u201d and \u201ccomplications\u201d. 82%\u201388% of VHW, CHS, and district respondents reported that EBS is very important in detecting public health events. 85% of VHW and CHS respondents and 77% of district respondents said they were willing to continue participating in EBS. data collected during field visits substantiated these results. staff from every district, CHS, and public hospital within each province were trained, achieving 100% training coverage. at least 15,000 posters with community signals and reporting information were provided to CHSs.
