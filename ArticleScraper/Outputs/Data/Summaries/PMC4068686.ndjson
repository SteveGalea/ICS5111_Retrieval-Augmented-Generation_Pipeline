{"summary": "aerosols are now recognized to be important mechanisms of transmission for viruses like influenza virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, porcine corona virus, norovirus, and foot-and-mouth disease virus. more standardized studies are needed to better understand the behavior of these viruses under airborne conditions. tail-less phages such as coliphages T4 and X174 were also explored as viral aerosol models. only a few studies have compared the effects of aerosolization and sampling on these tail-less phages. PCR quantification of total viral particles collected by a sampler is essential to assess the physical stress caused to the virus by aerosolization and sampling. these viruses were chosen on the basis of their similarities (morphology, envelope, capsid size, and genome material) with known pathogenic viruses. they were chosen on the basis of their similarities (morphology, envelope, capsid size, and genome material) with known pathogenic viruses. bacterial host HER-1102 14 HER-221 Phage PR772, 80 nm, unenveloped, linear dsDNA, 10,079 bp, bacterial host HER-1254 26 HER-462 Phage MS2, 25 nm, unenveloped, circular dsDNA, 10,079 bp, bacterial host HER-1462 14 ATCC VR-95 Human influenza A virus H1N1 A/PR/8/34, 80\u2013120 nm pseudoalteromonas espejiana host cells were grown in 30 ml broth containing artificial marine salt. all phage lysates were titrated on their respective bacterial host. no plaque was observed with the five phages when they were plated on other bacterial hosts. human influenza A virus H1N1 A/PR/8/34 strain was purchased as a live vaccine. phages lysates were mixed with 1 ml of allantoic fluid 16 h before aerosolization. the allantoic fluid was harvested from noninfected eggs, pooled, mixed, filtered on a 0.22-m-pore-size membrane. before aerosolization, phage buffer was added to the mixtures to obtain a final volume of 70 ml. b Lab nebulizer, and 19 liters/min with the Collison 6-jet nebulizer were maintained in a continuous flow throughout the sampling. the relative humidity in the aerosol chamber was below 20% with the Aeroneb Lab nebulizer and the TSI 9302 atomizer. the samples were recovered by vortexing. controls were performed to confirm that the vortex conditions did not affect viral infectivity. every aerosolization condition was repeated at least three times in distinct experiments (n 3). primers and probes used in this study are listed in Table 2. the probes were labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) at the 5\u2032 end and Iowa black FQ (IABlkFQ) or black hole quencher 1 (BHQ) at the 3\u2032 end. influenza virus and PM2 probes were also labeled with a ZEN quencher. -BHQ-3\u2032 6 S segment positions 450\u2013474 14 PR772for 5\u2032-CCTGAATCCGCCTATTATGTTGC-3\u2032 PR772 genome positions 4538\u20134560 This study PR772probe 5\u2032-FAM-CGCATACCATTACGCA-IABlkFQ-3\u2032 PR772 genome positions 4663\u20134641 This study PM2probe 5\u2032-FAM-AATTGCCGC-ZEN-ATCTTCCTCTCT virus M segment positions 160\u2013181 55 InfArev 5\u2032-AGGGCATTYTGGACAAAKCGTCTA-3\u2032 Influenza virus M segment positions 242\u2013265 55 The assay components per 25 l were 5 l of phage sample or 2 l of cDNA, 12.5 pmol of primers for all phages and 12.5 l of 2 master mix of the iQ Supermix (Bio-Rad) the iScript one-step reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) kit for probes (Bio-Rad) was as follows: 15 min at 50\u00b0C, 5 min at 95\u00b0C, and then 40 cycles including denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 15 s. for each PCR run, a standard curve was generated in duplicate with plasmid DNA (or RNA for NDV) the amplification products were cloned into the pDrive cloning vector using a Qiagen PCR cloning kit (Qiagen) the DNA constructions were transformed into Escherichia coli MC1061 competent cells using the rubidium chloride method (32). IPFU is the concentration of infectious viruses collected by the air sampler (number of PFU/liter), CPFU is the air sample concentration (number of PFU/ml), v is the air sample volume (liters/min), and t is the sampling time (min). the number of viral genomes per liter of air was also calculated for all air samples using the same method by replacing CPFU by the air sample concentration in number of genomes/ml (CqPCR) data were analyzed using 2-way analysis of variance or an unpaired t test. variables were log transformed and P values were reported from these transformations. the significance level that was used to assign significant differences was a P value of 0.05. the influenza virus and NDV strains were grown on specific-pathogen-free chicken eggs as described previously (28) the infectious titer, expressed as 50% egg infectious dose (EID50) units, was calculated according to the method of Reed and Muench (29) using five eggs per dilution. aerosols were generated with an atomizer (model 9302; TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN) at a dispersion rate of 3 liters/min. Aeroneb Lab nebulizer (Aerogen Inc., Galway, Ireland) was filled with 7 ml from a phage dilution (1 ml of phage PR772 lysate at 1010 PFU/ml in 49 ml of phage buffer) the aerosols were passed through a desiccator (model 306200; TSI Inc.) to form aerosol droplet nuclei, before entering a Gen the samples were recovered by vortexing for 15 min at a 70% motor speed and a 100% frequency in 5 ml (first stage), 1.5 ml (second stage), and 5 ml (filter) of phage buffer. each phage was diluted and plated on the bacterial hosts to determine the infectious titer of each phage. the number of experiments is displayed in the legends to the figures. the number of experiments is displayed in the legends to the figures. all primer and probe sets give qPCR fluorescence signals only with their designated phages. qPCR fluorescence signals only with their designated phages. the assay components per 25 l were 5 l of phage sample or 2 l of cDNA, 12.5 pmol of primers for all phages and 12.5 l of 2 master mix of the iQ Supermix (Bio-Rad) the PCR program for all the phages was as follows: 5 min at 94\u00b0C and then 40 cycles of 15 s at 94\u00b0C and 30 s at 55\u00b0C, followed by fluorescence measurement. for influenza virus detection, the PCR program was as follows: 5 min at 94\u00b0C and then 40 cycles of 15 s at 94\u00b0C and 30 s at 55\u00b0C. two 10-fold dilutions made in duplicate were analyzed. the background was subtracted using the average over cycle range function of the software. the plotting of CT as a function of the logarithm of the amount of DNA template gave a straight line. the system was purged until zero particles were counted from the chamber. the nebulizer was filled with sterile phage buffer. controls without reverse transcriptase were used for qPCR detection. the relative recoveries by qPCR were obtained by equation 2 by replacing IPFU and nPFU by IqPCR and nqPCR respectively. the relative recoveries by qPCR were obtained by equation 2 by replacing IPFU and nPFU by IqPCR and nqPCR. phage particles were collected using two air samplers (SKC BioSampler and a NIOSH two-stage cyclone bioaerosol sampler at 10 liters/min) the organic fluid could not be used with the Collison 6-jet and the Aeroneb Lab nebulizers. however, the aerosols delivered by the Aeroneb Lab nebulizer were larger and less concentrated. the TSI 9302 atomizer and Collison 6-jet nebulizer performed better in our setup. qPCR detected 1,000-fold more genome copies than infectious PR772 particles. the relative recovery of PR772 was 100-fold higher with the SKC BioSampler than the NIOSH two-stage sampler. the differences between the two air samplers in the relative recovery of phage PR772 by qPCR were less significant (P = 0.038) these data suggest that the NIOSH sampler is more damaging to the integrity of phage PR772 and/or is less efficient at collecting particles of the size range generated by the nebulizers. PM2 plaques were found for only 3 out of 18 samples analyzed. relative recovery of phage PM2 by culture was 6.3 107 times less than qPCR. qPCR and culture relative recoveries were not significantly different. the relative recoveries by culture were similar with the NIOSH samplers at 3.5 liters/min and 10 liters/min. the SKC BioSampler led to a better recovery (100-fold higher) of infectious X174 than the NIOSH sampler. the nebulization buffer did increase the relative recovery of 6 by culture by 100-fold. but that it had no significant impact on the recovery of infectious particles for MS2, PM2 and X174. an unpaired t test was performed on normally distributed log-transformed data. data are for six experiments for all phages and three experiments for influenza A virus and NDV. a and b, comparison of the relative culture/genome ratios of the viruses. an unpaired t test was performed on normally distributed log-transformed data. the aerosols produced with the Collison 6-jet nebulizer and the TSI 9320 atomizer were similar in size and concentration. however, the aerosols delivered by the Aeroneb Lab nebulizer were larger and less concentrated. the addition of organic fluid into the nebulization buffer slightly increased the number of particles. samples were taken with the SKC BioSampler or the NIOSH two-stage cyclone bioaerosol sampler at 10 liters/min (gray symbols) the black and gray bars indicate the median relative recoveries obtained with each sampler (n = 3). the relative recovery of PR772 was 100-fold higher with the SKC BioSampler than the NIOSH two-stage sampler when the air samples were analyzed by plaque assays (P 0.0001) the five primer and probe sets were tested with the five phage models. each primer and probe set gave a qPCR fluorescence signal only with its designated phage. however, the relative recovery by qPCR and culture was of the same order of magnitude with this phage. the bars indicate the median relative recoveries obtained with each sampler. P values were determined by an unpaired t test of normally distributed log-transformed data. comparison of the SKC BioSampler and the NIOSH two-stage cyclone bioaerosol sampler at 3.5 liters/min and 10 liters/min. comparison of the relative recoveries of the phages by culture divided the five phages into four clusters. the relative recoveries of MS2 and PM2 by culture were different from those of the other phages with both samplers. there was no statistically significant difference between the relative recovery of phages 6 and PR772 by culture. an unpaired t test was performed on normally distributed log-transformed data. P was >0.05 between viruses in cluster a, and P was >0.05 between the viruses in cluster b. relative recovery of virus was almost always higher when using qPCR than when using culture, with exceptions being phage MS2 and poultry virus NDV. qPCR is often used in aerosol chamber studies to quantify the total number of viral particles collected and compare it with the amount of infectious virus to assess the damage caused to the viruses. phage MS2 was the most robust among the five phages tested. it showed a good resistance to aerosolization and sampling. this phage is 7 to 10 times more resistant to aerosolization, sampling, and UV light than a coronavirus. the long-term storage of the lysate of this phage led to a decrease in the number of PFU and in the number of genome copies. however, the overall ratio of the number of genomes/number of PFU increased. these data suggest that phage PR772, and possibly other phages as well, lost its infectivity before genome degradation. phages PR772 and X174 were the best surrogates for NDV and phages PR772 and 6 were the best surrogates for influenza virus. the sampler may be more suitable than the SKC BioSampler for rare events. qPCR or culture No effect NDV 6 (dsRNA) SKC BioSampler or NIOSH two-stage cyclone bioaerosol sampler at 3.5 and 10 liters/min qPCR or culture No effect NDV PR772 (dsDNA)"}
