{"summary": "toxoplasma gondii is a well-adapted parasite of warm-blooded hosts. the parasite has distinct developmental stages, such as the fast-replicating tachyzoites that are present in the acute phase of infection. zoites form tissue cysts in muscular and nervous tissues during the chronic phase of infection. infection usually takes place after accidental ingestion of raw or undercooked meat containing tissue cysts, oocyst-contaminated food or water, and by transplacental passage of tachyzoites in active infection during the gestational period [3]\u2013[4]. congenital infection may lead to neurological disorders, ocular disease and/or fetal death. polyclonal IgY antibodies raised against T. gondii soluble tachyzoite antigen (STAg) were purified from egg yolks in order to obtain the highest yield and purity. the water soluble fraction (S1) presented undesirable low molecular weight proteins after acid water precipitation of pooled egg yolk. s from salting-out and gel filtration purified fractions until the concentration of 110 ng of protein. IgY enrichment conferred by Slot-blot assay, was detected until the concentration of 0.01 g of protein (box) IgY anti-STAg antibodies recognized a broad range of T. gondii antigens. from the 35th day onwards, IgY anti-STAg antibodies recognized a broad range of T. gondii antigens. samples with ELISA Index (EI) equal or superior to 1.2 were considered positive. standardized immunohistochemical assay using IgY anti-STAg antibodies was able to detect antigenic distinct structures in brain tissue sections. monolayers of HeLa cells infected with T. gondii were incubated with IgY anti-STAg and rabbit IgG anti-IgY conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate. immunocytochemistry for T. gondii using polyclonal IgY anti-STAg. rabbit IgG anti-IgY conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate. p30 was evenly recognized by antibodies from the distinct species. different recognition patterns in antigens with 60\u201380 kDa and absence of immunodominant p22 antigen by chicken IgY. IgY antibodies against the closely related protozoa did not cross-react with Toxoplasma antigens. purification of polyclonal IgY antibodies from egg yolks. water soluble fraction (S1) presented undesirable low molecular weight proteins after acid water precipitation of pooled egg yolk. each egg presented an average of 12 mL of yolk and mean yield was 48 mg/mL. Na2SO4) produced an enriched IgY pellet (P2) and a supernatant with contaminants (S2). IgY was detected until the concentration of 0.01 g of protein (box) the 14th fraction presented the highest degree of purity. the production of IgY anti-STAg increased significantly along the next weeks. the 6 M urea treatment presented a reduction in staining intensity of the described antigens between the 21st and 35th days p.i., with normal reactivity being observed after that period. samples with ELISA Index equal or superior to 1.2 were considered positive. paraffin-embedded brain sections of mice chronically infected with me-49 strain were incubated with IgY anti-STAg and rabbit IgG anti-IgY conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate. segmented parasitophorus vacuoles were detected into host cell cytoplasm around the DAPI-stained nucleus (blue) monolayers of HeLa cells infected with T. gondii were incuba tachyzoites were detected into cell cytoplasm around the nucleus (blue, DAPI) with strong staining (arrows) only chicken-derived antibodies recognized proteins with approximate molecular weights of 40 kDa, while IgG anti-STAg from mice reacted strongly to 50 kDa antigen. the assay revealed that IgY antibodies against the closely related protozoa did not cross-react with Toxoplasma antigens. the same recognition pattern against STAg proteins was noted in two-dimensional immunoblotts (WB2D) hens produced and purified polyclonal anti-T. gondii antibodies from the egg yolk. this is a protocol which animal bleeding turned out to be unnecessary. the high avidity of the produced IgY antibodies is the great features of the protocol herein described. IgY antibodies recognized a broad range of proteins, with distinct isoelectric points determined by 2D-immunoblot. serum samples from naturally infected humans react to a broad spectrum of T. gondii proteins [29] and experimentally infected mice produce specific antibodies against high and low molecular weight antigens. the role of T. gondii antigens involved in parasite virulence has been addressed over the last decade [40]\u2013[41]. polyclonal IgY anti-STAg antibodies are a promising complementary tool for studies of the T. gondii infection model. tachyzoites of T. gondii (RH strain) were maintained by serial passage in mice. only exudates containing 100% of free-ranging tachyzoites were used for antigen preparation. two boosters were performed at 15 day intervals, with 100 g of STAg plus Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant (Sigma). hens were monitored daily for adverse effects and individual laid eggs were daily collected and stored at 4\u00b0C until further processing. P2 samples were submitted to exclusion-size gel chromatography using Sephacryl S-300 column. actual protein concentration was measured by BCA kit (Sigma) and samples were stored at 20\u00b0C until use. possible cross-reactivity of purified IgY antibodies to mouse proteins ruled out by immunoblots. the optimal conditions for ELISA were obtained through block titration. plates were washed 3 times with PBS-Tween 0.05% (PBS-T) and blocked with PBS-T plus 1% bovine serum albumin (PBS-T-BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. two wells were rinsed with 6 M urea in PBS-T. the other duplicate wells were rinsed with PBS-T for 10 min at room temperature. all wells were washed 3 times in PBS-T. i.m. and s.c. routes (1100 sera dilution; 12000 anti-mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase \u2013 Sigma) a 2D-immunoblot assay was carried out to evaluate the antigen recognition profile of immunized hens to STAg. slides were incubated with rabbit anti-IgY labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC, Sigma) diluted 1300 in addition to DAPI for 60 min at 37\u00b0C. slides were mounted with carbonate-buffered glycerin. Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism version 4.0 software. the Student t test was used to investigate significant differences between groups. values of P0.05 were considered statistically significant. total protein was estimated by the Bicinchoninic acid kit (BCA, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) aliquots were stored at 80\u00b0C until use. same protocol was performed with cells extracted from the peritoneal cavity of mice. egg white was removed and egg yolk was diluted 10-fold in deionized water. the pellet was retrieved and represented the IgY-enriched fraction (P2). protein samples obtained during IgY extraction were sequentially diluted 10-fold (10 g to 104 g) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by a vacuum apparatus. the presence of detectable chicken antibodies was verified by an rabbit anti-IgY antibody conjugated to peroxidase (Sigma) as secondary antibody. two positive quality-controls and six negative controls were included in each plate in order to calculate the cut off. the same protocol was applied to mouse IgG anti-STAg obtained after immunization using a goat IgG anti-mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase. IgY was detected by incubating the secondary antibody, rabbit anti-IgY labelled with peroxidase, diluted at 120.000, for 2 min at room temperature. a 2D-immunoblot assay was carried out to evaluate the antigen recognition profile of immunized hens to STAg. 1D-immunoblot was performed to compare the STAg recognition profile between mammalian and avian hosts. primary antibodies were detected by goat anti-mouse IgG antibody labeled with peroxidase (11000, Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature. incubation with rabbit anti-IgY antibody labelled with FITC (Sigma) diluted 1600 in PBS plus 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. reaction read in an inverted fluorescence microscope system. polyclonal IgY antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum and Eimeria spp. were assayed against soluble antigens of peritoneal cells."}
