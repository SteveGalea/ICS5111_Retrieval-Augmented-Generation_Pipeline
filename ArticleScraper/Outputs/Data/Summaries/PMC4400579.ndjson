{"summary": "studies have demonstrated the utility of social media data sources for a wide range of public health goals. most such research has focused on English-language social media for the task of disease surveillance. studies have focused on epidemiological surveillance systems for influenza [1,2] and allergies [3], tracking health behaviors such as smoking [4-6] and exercise [7], identifying mental health trends [8,9], and measuring health perceptions and sentiment [10,11] most work to date has focused on twitter, emphasizing health topics of major concern in the united states, with little work concerning health issues important in other countries. social media data can be used to identify air quality trends and public response in china. we mined weibo messages for statements about air quality and pollution. we demonstrated two epidemiological uses of these data. weibo requires that users provide city and province upon registration, which is included in the downloaded data. each user account has a verified attribute that designates whether it is an individual user (as well as celebrities), a government account, a company account, the media, or others. we are making publicly available the health keywords used to filter Weibo messages. the words in the figure represent the 25 highest-probability words in each topic. larger words are more probable. the words have been translated from the original Chinese text. we measured the Pearson correlation (n=74) between the Weibo volumes and the city PM2.5 values. we labeled whether the message discussed air quality or air pollution. we labeled whether the message discussed air quality or air pollution. data We collected 93 million messages from Weibo using public API. a small set of randomly selected seed users downloaded the most recent messages from each user. the bulk are from 2013 (68.42%, 63,789,097/93,225,579) we used a keyword-based filter in which we selected messages that contain one of four relevant terms: pollution (), air (), breathe (), and cough (). second, we used latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [29], a probabilistic topic model, to filter messages that belonged to topics relevant to air quality or pollution. we used these two topics to filter Weibo messages by selecting messages where at least one token was assigned to the given topic by the sampler. we compared the volume of air quality messages with fine particle pollution (PM2.5) measurements for 74 cities. messages were coded independently by two annotators. disagreements were resolved after discussion with a third annotator. the messages were not coded for the purpose of training a model. 0.06% (251/435,873) were media accounts, and 0.06% (251/435,873) were companies. in total, the four keywords matched 75,912 messages, the AQ topic matched 15,763 messages and the PO topic matched 45,172. 114 messages sampled through this filter were actually relevant to air quality or air pollution. of those 114 messages, 90 indicated a firsthand experience (79.0%) of those 90 messages, 32 (36%) mentioned a reactive behavior. three (2.6%) out of 114 relevant messages requested action to improve air quality. one message declared a need to reduce carbon emissions, while the other two more generally called for cleaner air. the most common reactive behavior was wearing a face mask. annotator divergence stemmed from disagreement over whether a general discomfort should be classified as a health concern. many users expressed discomfort breathing and thus wore a mask. after discussion, we did not count such messages as health concerns. the correlations with pollution data are.718 (ADV) and.664 (MDV) these are both higher than the best correlation reported in Table 1. 74 cities with PM2.5 data were filtered for all health-related keywords. filters include URLs without URLs Number of messages Corr. (ADV)a Corr. (MDV)b Number of messages Corr. (ADV) AQc topic 7665.546.545 5866.583.565 POd topic 21,902.361.421 17,696.286.387 \u201cair\u201d 6321.552.593 4949.610.637 \u201cpollution\u201d. of the individual keyword filters, the AQ topic correlates best. the highest correlation achieved is with the AQ+\u201dpollution\u201d filter on messages without URLs, at.703 (P.001). analysis of Message Content We analyzed 170 messages from the AQ topic, which had the highest correlation of the two topics. annotator agreement percentages ranged from 78% to 97%. there was very high agreement on whether messages were relevant to air quality, whether the user requested action to improve quality, and whether the user expressed a reactive behavior. the lowest agreement was on whether the user expressed a health concern. PM A foreigner said that this picture shows the serious pollution of Beijing. the PM value is too high, but it is lightly polluted based on the air pollution index, so I have to stay at home. a recent study found machine learning to help identify air pollution trends in social media [35] some of the keyword filters did quite poorly. some of the keyword filters did quite poorly. coding results suggest a promising direction in using Weibo messages to understand health concerns, behavioral responses, and health impacts of environmental factors. we believe social media-derived information will be especially advantageous for measuring public perception and response. this is information that cannot be captured with physical sensors. social media users report perceptions and behaviors regarding air quality. this falls into a broader trend of using digital data to support research in behavioral medicine. results validate both the quality of messages and suggest that mining their content can deliver important epidemiological insights into environment health. supervised classification and topic modeling helped identify air pollution trends in social media. we estimate there are at least 10,000 messages about air quality in our crawled dataset. coding results suggest a promising direction in using Weibo messages to understand health concerns, behavioral responses, and health impacts of environmental factors. social media complaints tend to be general, and the threshold of perceived pollution before writing a complaint is quite likely lower in social media. behavioral response to pollution is hard to measure, and often is not measured at all, but rather inferred or assumed [27]. a type of behavioral response of particular interest is response to public awareness campaigns or health advisories regarding pollution. studies have shown that collective action and mentions of certain politically sensitive topics are subject to censorship. but it is not clear whether this would affect pollution-related media. findings show that social media messages in china contain relevant firsthand user reports of air quality."}
