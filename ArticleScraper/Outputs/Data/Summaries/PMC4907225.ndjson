{"summary": "respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of respiratory tract infection in children. primary infection usually occurs during infancy, and all children have been infected by 2 years of age. essentially all children have been infected by 2 years of age. monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against different antigenic sites differ in their neutralizing capacities, with pre- and postfusion-specific antibodies displaying the highest and lowest neutralizing capacities. vaccination with F proteins stabilized in a prefusion-like conformation, which presumably results in the induction of highly neutralizing prefusion-specific antibodies. the optical density at 450 nm corresponds to binding of MAbs to F. (E) Reactivity of G-specific MAb 131-2G with recombinant G protein was assayed by the addition of serial dilution of this MAb. expression constructs encoding the 101F antibody heavy and light chains were constructed on the basis of the published sequence (46) as described before (16, 21) the cDNA clones encoding a subtype A RSV G ectodomain (residues 64 to 298; GenBank accession number P03423.1) SV-X (GenBank FJ948820), its derivative recombinant RSV-X (rRSV) and RSV-A2 were propagated and vaccine batches prepared as described previously (28). Vaccination with similar preparations was previously shown to elicit enhanced disease phenotypes in cotton rats. the neutralizing titers were determined at the 50% reduction point compared to mock-treated viruses using 4-parameter fit curve analysis (GraphPad) the neutralizing capacity of the cotton rat plasma samples was analyzed by fluorescence-based plaque reduction neutralization assay (30). ELISA plates (Nunc MaxiSorp; Thermo Scientific) were coated with 25 ng of RSV F or RSV G. plates were coated with 25 ng of Flys-GCN and incubated with serial dilutions of serum samples or unlabeled MAbs. plates were incubated with biotinylated D25, 101F, palivizumab, or 131-2a at 0.6 g/ml, 0.4 g/ml, 0.3 g/ml, or 0.2 g/ml, respectively. the concentration of F-epitope-specific antibody in sera was calculated based on linear regression of concentration-dependent MAb inhibition. the correlation between the different serum responses was determined by linear regression and Pearson r analysis using the GraphPad software. the protein was eluted using 0.1 M glycine\u2013HCl buffer (pH 3.0) the protein was immediately neutralized using 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) a dose of 1 104 TCID50 in 50 l of FI-RSV was applied to 6 animals per group. cotton rats were challenged intranasally with 3 105 TCID50 of RSV-X in 100 l at day 28 after immunization. plasma samples were collected at day 28 (prechallenge) and 5 days later (postchallenge) ion of HRP reactivity was performed using tetramethylbenzidine substrate (BioFX) and an ELISA plate reader (EL-808 [from Biotek]) the titer for RSV F or G was determined by calculating the corresponding dilution for an optical density (OD) value from the linear part of the curve. to measure antibody responses to antigenic sites, I, II, and IV specifically, blocking ELISAs were performed. inhibition titer for each serum sample was determined as the serum dilution that resulted in 50% inhibition of palivizumab, 101F, or 131-2a binding. similar results were obtained when 25% inhibition was used as the readout. a monoclonal antibody (131-2G) against the G protein was shown to efficiently bind to the recombinant soluble G protein (Fig. 1E). a monoclonal antibody (131-2G) against the G protein was shown to efficiently bind to the recombinant soluble G protein (Fig. 1E). y axes depict the percentage of biotinylated MAb binding in the presence of nonbiotinylated MAbs normalized to the binding in the absence of nonbiotinylated MAbs. the different ELISAs (using F protein, G protein, and epitope-specific F protein) were validated using pooled human control sera that were obtained from beiRESOURCES. OD450 = 1 for FlysGCN and OD450 = 0.5 for RSV G. the error bars indicate the standard deviations (n = 3) sera were collected from 15 healthy individuals and quantitatively analyzed for the presence of virus-neutralizing F protein- and G protein-specific antibodies. dilution corresponds to 50% inhibition of RSV infection (RSV VN titer) (A), OD450 nm = 1 for RSV F (FlysGCN [21] (B), or OD450 nm = 0.5 for RSV G (FlysGCN [21]). the error bars indicate the standard deviations (n = 3). the age (in years) and gender of the 15 healthy volunteers from whom the sera were derived are indicated together with symbols that represent each individual. the error bars indicate the standard deviation (n = 3). sera from 15 healthy individuals (indicated by capitals) were checked for the presence of antibodies against F-specific epitopes as described in the Fig. 4 legend. the bar graphs depict the dilution (log2) that corresponds to 25% inhibition of binding of D25 (A) or 50% inhibition of other MAbs. antigenic site -specific antibodies in human sera show the highest correlation with virus neutralization titers of all the antigenic sites tested. the results corresponding to the titer of RSV neutralization and RSV protein/epitope-specific ELISA analysis of human sera are shown in the Fig. 5 and 6 legends. at 28 days postvaccination, blood samples were taken and the animals were challenged with RSV. at 5 days postinfection, the animals were euthanized, and lungs and blood samples were collected. animals that had been immunized with rRSV or with FI-RSV displayed significantly decreased virus titers in the lungs compared to the mock-vaccinated animals. pooled sera of cotton rats vaccinated with FI-RSV showed vaccination-enhanced disease. sera were collected on the day of challenge (pre-challenge) and 5 days after challenge (post-challenge) pooled sera from a parallel experiment in which cotton rats had been infected intranasally with105 PFU of RSV/A/Long per animal were analyzed. the latter animals did not display enhanced disease upon challenge. different ELISAs were developed to analyze RSV protein- and epitope-specific antibody levels in human and animal sera. as an antigen to determine F protein-specific antibody levels, we used a recombinant soluble prefusion-like form of F consisting of the F ectodomain extended with a GCN4 trimerization motif. the neutralizing capacity of these antibodies is shown in Fig. 1C. the specificity of the assays was verified by performing a blocking ELISA using labeled and nonlabeled MAbs. binding of biotinylated MAb could be blocked only by the corresponding nonlabeled antibody, with the exception of biotinylated D25, which was blocked by D25 and AM22, both of which have been shown to bind antigenic site. two-fold serial dilutions of pooled control sera were applied to F or G protein-coated wells. the optical density at 450 nm (OD450nm) corresponding to binding of antibodies to F or G was graphed as a line chart. blocking ELISA analyses were performed to check for the presence of antibodies in pooled control sera. two-fold serial dilutions of sera were applied to RSV F (FlysGCN)-coated wells, followed by addition of the indicated biotinylated MAbs. ization and G protein ELISA titers did not correlate significantly. sera from 15 healthy individuals (indicated by capitals) were checked for the presence of RSV neutralization titer as described in Materials and Methods and anti-RSV antibodies. antibody levels against 131-2a, palivizumab, and 101F epitopes correlated significantly with the F protein ELISA titers. however, the highest positive correlation was observed for antibody against D25 epitope. levels of antibodies against palivizumab and 131-2a but not 101F epitopes also showed a significant (but lower) positive correlation with virus neutralization titers. correlation between the F epitope-specific reactivity (depicted on the x axis) and RSV neutralization (depicted on the y axis) different symbols are used for the different sera. the Pearson r correlation coefficient and P values are indicated. each data point represents the fold difference between the value for each sera and the mean value for all sera tested. each data point represents the mean of results from three independent experiments performed to determine the presence of virus-neutralizing (RSV VN), flysGCN protein-specific (RSV F), G protein-specific (RSV G) and epitope-specific antibodies. vaccination with FI-RSV did not induce appreciable levels of either virus-neutralizing or F protein-specific antibody levels prior to the challenge. after challenge, all animals except the mock-vaccinated ones showed an increase in their virus neutralization titers and in their response to RSV F. however, immunization with rRSV induced antibodies against palivizumab, 101F, and 131-2a epitopes, the levels of which increased after the challenge. flysGCN epitope-specific ELISA titers pre- and postchallenge. pooled sera of cotton rats vaccinated with FI-RSV were analyzed. sera collected at day 42 postinfection (at the day of challenge) were analyzed. the reactivity observed with the different virus preparations was very similar to that of postfusion F (Fig. 10C) the lack of induction of palivizumab- or 101F-like antibodies was not due to the absence of their corresponding epitopes in FI-RSV preparations. reactivity in human sera correlated well with levels of serum antibodies recognizing antigenic sites I, II, and IV but not antigenic site. reactivity in human sera with recombinant prefusion F is not predictive of antigenic site -specific antibodies. activity with F indicates higher levels of antibodies against palivizumab, 101F, and 131-2a than against D25 epitope. the relatively low levels of antibody against D25 epitope may be related to the low stability of epitope compared to other epitopes (12, 36, 37) the abundance of antigenic site -specific antibodies correlated better with virus neutralization than the abundance of antibodies binding other antigenic sites. e-specific ELISAs were used to analyze sera from cotton rats that had been immunized with either live attenuated rRSV or FI-RSV followed by a challenge infection. in all cases, we could not detect the presence of antibodies against the D25 epitope in cotton rat sera or in cotton rats that had been infected with (live attenuated) RSV. analysis of F epitope-specific antibody levels in cotton rat sera revealed novel insights into the antibody responses induced by vaccination with FI-RSV. antigenicity of a vaccine preparation is not predictive of the induced antibody responses."}
