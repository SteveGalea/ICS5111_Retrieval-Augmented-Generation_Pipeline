{"summary": "influenza is a highly contagious respiratory disease of humans. influenza is caused by negative-strand RNA viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae. influenza is a highly contagious respiratory disease of humans. the world health organization reported that the HPAI H5N1 virus has infected 620 individuals, causing 367 deaths (59% mortality) as of 15 February 2013. a recent pandemic of A/H1N1pdm in 2009 occurred following reassortment between 2 swine influenza viruses, triple-reassortant swine influenza virus and Eurasian-lineage swine influenza virus. IC can be improved using antibodies conjugated with fluorescent beads (Fluorescent immunochromatography; FLIC), but the sensitivity is significantly improved. 4 antibodies of total 12 clones were selected for immunofluorescent assay (IFA) and ELISA (Table. 1). 5H7 showed a weak positive signal on Aichi2 infected cells. MDCK cells infected with MNG3, HKD8 or Vac-3 at MOI 4. 8C1 (a), 14A7 (b), 7A5-1 (c) or 5H7 (d) were stained with recombinant HA protein (rHA protein) of H5 subtype viruses. ELISA was then conducted with recombinant rHA protein (rHA protein) of H5 subtype viruses as the target. clades 1, 2.1, 2.2, and these sub clades were limited to clades 1, 2.1, 2.2, and these sub clades. but it could detect rHAs of Eurasian type outlier virus and North American type virus. 3 H5N1 viruses, MNG3, HKD08 and Vac-3, were tested by Type-E and Type-N kits at serial concentrations. Type-E detected all 3 viruses with a sensitivity between 105 and 106 pfu (per 100 l sample solution), and Type-E detected MNG3 and Vac-3 with a sensitivity of about 105 pfu (per 100 l sample solution), but not HKD08. -N Eurasian (calde2.2) A/whooper swan/Mongolia/3/2005 106 ++a +++ 105 + ++ 104 Eurasian (outlier) A/duck/Hokkaido/Vac-3/2007 106 + +++ 105 + 104 a The number of + indicates the level of signal. +, ++ or +++ indicates the intensity of signal is between 105 and 125%, between 126 to 175% or over combination of Type-E and Type-N is expected to have the potential to detect almost all H5 subtype influenza viruses. the combination of Type-E and Type-N is expected to have the potential to detect almost all H5 subtype influenza viruses. the sensitivity of FLICs was calculated using the exponential approximation of viral titer (pfu/mL) and the rate of signal/background (S/B) the cut-off S/B value was set at 1. The amount of viral titer at the intersection point of the exponential approximation and S/B = 1 was defined as the limit of detection. 107 TCID50 of other subtype viruses, including HPAI H7N7 virus (A/chicken/Netherlands/2586/2003) were tested. 1 g/mL of 15 rHA of other subtypes, including Spanish influenza virus (A/BrevigMission/1/1918) and H1N1pdm (A/California/7/2009), were also tested.

Specificities of H5 4 antibodies of total 12 clones were selected for immunofluorescent assay (IFA) and ELISA (Table. 1). MDCK cells were infected with 3 H5N1 subtype avian influenza viruses. 8C1 could detect all 3 strains of H5N1 viruses. antibody 8C1 (a), 14A7 (b), 7A5-1 (c) or 5H7 (d) at 6-infection, cells were stained with antibody 8C1 (a), 14A7 (b), 7A5-1 (c) or 5H7 (d) both 8C1 and 5H7 interacted with all 4 rHAs. A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (Eurasian type clade 1; VN1194), A/Indonesia/5/2005 (Eurasian type clade 2.1.3; IDN5), A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/1A/2005 (Eurasian type clade 2.2; QH1A), and AH1. influenza A virus Antibody combination Subtypes Strain Name genotype (clade) Antigen amount (ng) Type-E Type-N H5N1 A/Hong Kong/483/1997 Eurasian (Clade 0) 100 +++a 10 +++ A/bar-headed goose/Qinghai/14/2008 Eurasian (Clade 1) 100 +++ +++ 10 + + A/Cambodia/R0405050/2007 Eurasian (Clade 1.1) 100 3 H5N1 viruses, MNG3, HKD08 and Vac-3, were tested by using Type-E and Type-N kits at serial concentrations. Type-E detected all 3 viruses with a sensitivity between 105 and 106 pfu (per 100 l sample solution), and Type-N detected MNG3 and Vac-3 with a sensitivity of about 105 pfu (per 100 l sample solution), but not HKD08. the set of Type-E and Type-N of FLIC were tested for detection of 106 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of 7 strains of H5N1 viruses and 2 strains of H5N2 viruses. Type-E could detect all 7 Eurasian type viruses both GS/GD/1-lineage and outlier. the combination of Type-E and Type-N is expected to have the potential to detect almost all H5 subtype influenza viruses. Figure 2. Principles and appearance of FLIC. sensitivity of FLICs was calculated using exponential approximation of viral titer (pfu/mL) and the rate of signal/background (S/B) the cut-off S/B value was set at 1. The amount of viral titer at the intersection point of the exponential approximation and S/B = 1 was defined as the limit of detection. HA of other subtypes, including Spanish influenza virus (A/BrevigMission/1/1918) and H1N1pdm (A/California/7/2009), were also tested. all of the viruses and rHAs were not detected with any positive signals, meaning the FLICs maintained the specificity with the high sensitivity. H15N8 A/duck/Australia/341/1983 - - H16N3 A/black-headed gull/Sweden/5/1999 - Table 7. Specificities of H5 FLIC for non-H5 subtypes of recombinant HA protein. IC is based on an antigen\u2013antibody reaction, implying it is not suitable for detecting emerging or re-emerging influenza viruses that are precursors of epidemics or pandemics. sensitivity of IC was several 10 times higher than colloidal gold IC. avian influenza viruses of Eurasian type play an important role in the human infection by avian influenza viruses. the Type-E kit could detect both clade 2.3.2 and clade 2.3.4 viruses, meaning the kit identifies the general epitope of Eurasian type H5 viruses. ito et al. reported that LPAI H5 virus (A/whistling swan/Shimane/499/83 (H5N3)) became highly pathogenic in chickens after 24 consecutive passages by air sac inoculation. the result indicated that LPAI H5 viruses have a potential of becoming HPAI viruses and public health threat. cells and virus strains Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK cells; American Type Culture Collection, ATCC, VA, USA) were maintained in modified Eagle's medium (MEM) supplemented with 5% FCS and penicillin-streptomycin solution. all influenza A virus strains used in this study are listed in Tables 3 (H5 subtypes) and 6 (non-H5 subtypes) the recombinant virus was purified and named RVV-Flu HA (H5-mCl2.2) after 36 h, the virus-cell mixture was harvested by scraping, and frozen at 80\u00b0C until use. the cells were then washed with PBS and lysed in HA lysis buffer. the fused cells were selected with hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium on 96-well plates at a concentration of 2104 cells/well with IL-6 (0.25 U/mL) the antibodies were cloned by limited dilution and several clones were picked up. 1 ml of latex beads solution (0.5% in 10 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0) was combined into 300 l of water soluble carbodiimide (1 mg/ml in 10 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. the fluorescence was detected with Konica Minolta immunochromatography reader (Konica Minolta, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) at excitation wavelength 660 nm and emission wavelength 710 nm. ethics Statement All animal care and experimental procedures were performed according to the guidelines established by the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science subcommittee on laboratory animal care. ichi/2/68 (H3N2), B/Mass/3/66, and B/Tokyo/15480/08 were described previously [27]. all viruses were grown in MDCK or 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. a synthesized QH1A gene with 6 His tag sequence was inserted into pBMSF7C vector. spleen cells were obtained for cell fusion with mouse myeloma cell line P3U1. spleen cells were cloned by limited dilution and several clones were picked up. cells were observed by a fluorescence microscope (BZ-9000, Keyence, Osaka, Japan) 100 ng of target rHA protein was immobilized to F96 MAXISORP NUNC-IMMUNO PLATE. the immobilized plate was blocked with 150 mL of 1% BSA/PBS for 2 h. the fluorescent reagent was 2-[3-Chloro-5-[1,1-dimehtyl-3-(3-methyl-butyl)-1,3-dihydro-benzo [e]indol- 2-ylidene]-penta-1,3-dienyl]-1,1-dimethyl-3-(3-methyl-butyl)-1H-benzo [e] indolium hexafluorophosphate"}
