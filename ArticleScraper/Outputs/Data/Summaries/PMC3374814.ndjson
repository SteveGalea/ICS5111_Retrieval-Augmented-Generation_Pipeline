{"summary": "the parasite Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of severe malaria in humans. the complex life cycle includes an asexual proliferation within human erythrocytes. adapted to the intra-erythrocytic lifestyle have created new and in some cases unique organelles. in early intra-erythrocytic life stages multiple enclosed compartments, called pre-FV compartments, are detectable in which haemoglobin degradation has already started. in late ring stages these smaller compartments fuse and give rise to the FV in early trophozoite stages. chloroquine resistant parasites accumulate considerably less CQ in their FV relative to sensitive parasites [18], [19], [20], [21]. the difference in accumulation is attributable to mutations in the FV membrane protein PfCRT (PF3D7_0709000), particularly a substitution of K to T at residue 76 [22] and to a lesser degree changes in the FV membrane protein PfMDR1 (PF3D7_0523000) we generated isogenic parasites lines with anhydrotetracycline-regulatable expression of PfCRT-GFP fusions using pfcrt alleles from sensitive (PfCRTS) and resistant parasites. inducible expression of PfCRT-GFP fusions also allows us to further characterise the trafficking of PfCRT to the FV membrane. mbrane length is a trafficking determinant in other endomembrane proteins. we have taken advantage of an inducible expression system in order to over-express both PfCRTS and PfCRTR as GFP-tagged fusion proteins. both PfCRT forms are identically localised at the FV membrane. the first TMD of the glycoprotein M1 of the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus was obtained from Machamer et al. [42]. the first TMD of the glycoprotein M1 of the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus was obtained from Machamer et al. pT150GFP vector provides unique PstI and MluI restriction enzyme sites between the minimal regulatable promoter and GFP to create inducible GFP fusion proteins. sequences corresponding to the full-length coding region of PfCRT (PF3D7_0709000) were amplified from the chloroquine sensitive strain 3D7 (hereafter referred to as PfCRTS) and the chloroquine resistant 7G8 (hereafter the cultures were incubated in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 1% O2 and 94% N2 at 37\u00b0C. parasite cultures were synchronised using 5% sorbitol for 5 min at 37\u00b0C. the parasitaemia was adjusted to 4\u20138% ring-stage parasites. rabbit anti-GAPDH (15,000) was identified with rabbit anti-GAPDH (15,000) followed by anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated IgG (15,000, Molecular Probes) and visualised using chemiluminescence system (ECL, Pierce) cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in 12 L PBS. cells were incubated with DAPI Nucleic Acid stain (1500, Invitrogen) in 3% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. before mounting cells on a glass slide, they were washed twice in PBS. aliquot of the resuspended cells was mounted in 60% glycerol with DABCO. mM dissolved in 100% (w/v) DMSO for 2 h. a second parasite culture was prepared in the same way. instead of Dynasore hydrate the same volume of 100% DMSO was added. lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 0.008% (w/v) saponin, 0.08% (w/v) Triton X-100) fluorescence, with excitation and emission wavelength centred at 485 nm and 530 nm respectively, was examined. each such experiment was performed independently five times. pTMSP2HA was generated by replacing the MSP2 5\u2032UTR in pTMSP2HA that drives transcription of the TATi3 transactivator. the resulting 1.55 kb product was digested with AflII and XhoI. the fragment was then cloned into the XmaI/BstB1 sites of pTMSP2HA. parasite culture, transfection and induction of expression O+ human erythrocytes were cultured using a modification of the method established by Trager and Jensen. a total of 100 g plasmid-DNA was used per transfection and electroporated into ring-stage parasites. the cultures were incubated in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 1% O2 and 94% N2 at 37\u00b0C. western blot detection of overexpressed protein Protein expression of GFP-tagged PfCRT was induced. total protein from erythrocytes infected with mainly trophozoite and schizont parasites was obtained by lysis with PBS containing 0.15% (w/v) saponin and 0.1% (w/v) BSA. erythrocytes infected with mainly trophozoite and schizont parasites were fixed for 50 min at room temperature (RT) in PBS containing 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde and 0.0075% (v/v) glutaraldehyde. cells were washed twice with and incubated with either Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated antibodies. the cells were analysed using the Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging Universal Microscope (Zeiss) and the imaging software AxioVision v4.5 (Zeiss) the cells were analysed using the Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging software. a second parasite culture was prepared in the same way, treating with the same volume of ethanol instead of Brefeldin A. parasites were dispensed to a final parasitaemia of 0.5% in triplicate. a second corresponding parasite population was treated equally, yet maintained in the presence of the transcription inhibitor ATc. to mimic the temporal expression of PfCRT we modified the TATI3 vector by replacing the PfMSP2 with the promoter of PfPTEX150 (PF3D7_1436300), a gene with very similar expression phase and abundance to PfCRT [53], [54] to mimic the temporal expression of PfCRT [32], we generated ATc-regulatable constructs with PfCRT fused to GFP. expression of the transcription activator TATi3 is under the control of the 5' UTR of PTEX150. TATi3-binding to the Tet operon (TetO) is inhibited and no expression of GFP-tagged PfCRT occurs. localisation of GFP-tagged PfCRTS and PfCRTR to the FV membrane Previous localisation studies have reported localisation solely to the FV membrane [22], [33] however, our bioinformatic analysis of PfCRTS and PfCRTR predicted a possible difference in the length of the first TMD between resistant and sensitive proteins, associated with the mutations at position 76. single point mutations at position 76 [22], [63] were analysed using three different TM prediction applications. the predicted length and position of the first TMD of PfCRT were extracted and analysed. the predicted length and position of the first TMD of PfCRT were extracted and analysed. schizont stage parasites additionally localised to mobile puncta within the FV. localisations of both PfCRTS and PfCRTR were analysed and compared repeatedly. but no differences in the localisation were observed between the two at any life stage. in late ring stage parasites, the small sphere of fluorescence co-localises with a round spherical body that is visible by light microscopy. this indicates that a discrete pre-FV compartment, bearing PfCRT, forms prior to the appearance of haemozoin. the characteristic dark haemozoin crystal was not yet visible in these parasites. in some parasites the additional PfCRT-GFP enclosed compartment is separate from the FV and surrounds a dark structure, possibly haemozoin. this stage was followed by enlargement of the PfCRT-delineated vacuole, then continued expansion of both the haemozoin crystal and the vacuolar membrane. in mature schizont stages, a second PfCRTS-GFP-labelled structure was observed that enlarged into a small ring BFA-treated parasites showed a restricted FV membrane localisation. there was no accumulation or labelling of PfCRTS molecules at either the PPM or a Golgi-like compartment. results consistent with previous study dissecting targeting processes of PfCRT. malarial parasites expressing GFP-tagged PfCRTS for 2 h with a concentration of 40 M. a concentration at 80 M completely inhibited the development of the parasites. analysis of parasites cultured longer than 2 h in the presence of Dynasore did not show any differences in morphology and labelling pattern compared to the 2 h treatment. malarial parasites over-expressing PfCRTS and PfCRTR. these parasites each possessed two separate PfCRT proteins. the inducible system is imperfect, and only a small number of parasites strongly express the induced protein. on average 7.70.4% and 8.30.8% of parasites were fluorescent in the PfCRTS-GFP and PfCRTR-GFP lines, respectively. this result confirmed the consistency of the inducible expression system and additionally demonstrated comparable proportions of over-expressing parasites. fusion proteins either have no impact on chloroquine resistance, or a sufficiently mild effect that our drug-response assay is unable to detect it. we generated ATc-regulatable constructs with PfCRT fused to GFP. fCRT modified the TATI3 vector by replacing the PfMSP2 with the promoter of PfPTEX150 (PF3D7_1436300), a gene with very similar expression phase and abundance to PfCRT [53], [54]. 62 kDa is slightly smaller than the expected molecular weight of 76 kDa for PfCRT as a GFP fusion but multi-spanning TM proteins regularly migrate faster than expected. Western Blot analysis of induced over-expression of sensitive (PfCRTS) and resistant (PfCRTR) form of PfCRT as GFP-fusion is confirmed by the presence of a band at 62 kDa only in the parasites cultured in the absence of ATc. a single point mutation at position 76 represents a replacement of a positively charged, hydrophilic residue (lysine, K) with an uncharged, hydrophobic (threonine, T) residue. the predicted length and position of the first TMD of PfCRT were analysed using different bioinformatic predictors. the first TMD of the infectious bronchitis virus Glycoprotein M consists of a polar face (black square around the involved residues) the first TMD of the infectious bronchitis virus consists of a polar face (black square around the involved residues) within its first TMD that becomes obvious when represented in a helical wheel projection (modified from [42]) ducible expression system used in this study was capable of expressing both forms of PfCRT as GFP-fusions. the mutation does not result in any altered localisation of PfCRT. previous studies focused on trophozoite parasites because the FV was apparent during this life cycle stage. fCRT was over-expressed as a GFP-fusion protein using an ATc-inducible expression system. the earliest detectable and distinct localisation of PfCRT-GFP was observed in mid ring stage parasites, co-localising with a round spherical shape. the characteristic dark haemozoin crystal was not yet visible in these parasites. live cell microscopy of PfCRT-GFP parasites reveals presence of a pre-FV compartment prior to detection of haemozoin crystal. this compartment may originate from the parasite periphery, but is consistent with previously-described dynamic processes during late stage parasites that result in a second FV compartment originating from the FV [7], [56]. analysis of the targeting processes of GFP-tagged PfCRTS Inducibly expressed GFP-tagged Pf a second parasite population was treated with either BFA (5 g/mL) for 3 h or Dynasore (40 M/mL) for 2 h. the control parasites show an accumulation of fluorescence around the DAPI-stained nuclei, consistent with ER localisation. analysis of parasites cultured longer than 2 h in the presence of Dynasore did not show any clear differences in morphology and labelling pattern compared to the 2 h treatment. fluorescence in parasites treated with Dynasore was somewhat lower, indicative of some toxicity, as seen with BFA. a concentration at 80 M completely inhibited the development of the parasites. parasites in any generation of a transfected line do not express the desired product. expression of the PfCRT-GFP fusion became considerably weaker several cycles after induction. the reason for this is unclear, but may relate to toxicity of longer expression of the fusion protein. the IC50 value for 3D7 wild-type parasites using this experimental method was on average 18.93.8 nM. parasites transfected with the PfCRT-GFP plasmids but with transgene expression repressed by maintenance on ATc showed no significant difference in the IC50 compared to 3D7. 3D7 PfCRTSGFP induced + verapamil 17.61.7 3D7wt 18.93.8 3D7wt + verapamil 18.00.4 W2MEF 295.321.0 W2MEF + verapamil 56.60.7 Discussion The food vacuole membrane protein PfCRT is a major modulator of chloroquine resistance. mutations in PfCRT modify this transporter or channel so that it allows chloroquine to leak out of mutations that result in mis-targeting include mutations that alter the length of a transmembrane domain [35], [36], [42], [55], [65]. specific transmembrane domains have also been shown to be instrumental in trafficking in Plasmodium falciparum [66], [67]. the increased positive charge at this limit of the PfCRT TMDs polar face [68] might change the transporter's affinity for protonated CQ2+. we used the inducible PfCRT-GFP fusions to investigate the trafficking route of induced protein to the FV membrane. dynamin-like GTPases in Plasmodium have been interrogated using a non-competitive inhibitor, Dynasore. dynamin-like GTPases are involved in the targeting of PfCRT to the FV by Dynasore-treating parasites that over-expressed PfCRTS-GFP. in our experiments the FV was intact and not fragmented. the FV does not persist throughout the intra-erythrocytic life stages. it depends on de novo biogenesis following the invasion of each new erythrocyte. current models that try to describe how the FV occurs are based on observations from various microscopic techniques. it is unclear if these secondary compartments derive from parcels of haemoglobin from the cytostomal invagination that have already recruited PfCRT but have failed to fuse with the existing FV membrane. neutral lipid bodies can be visualised with the hydrophobic probe Nile Red and they have been previously linked to haemozoin formation. only a small percentage of cells expressed the fusion proteins after induction in either cell lines. this effect has been seen before for ATc-regulatable systems in apicomplexan parasites. the gap in drug sensitivity between strongly drug resistant and sensitive lines is sufficient. the exact process underlying the de novo biogenesis of the FV and the mechanism by which haemoglobin is transferred to the FV remain important questions to address. the question of how important compensatory mechanisms are for allowing PfCRT mutations to mediate chloroquine resistance. bioinformatic interrogation of these mutations suggests that they may alter the position and length of the initial transmembrane domain. we therefore tested whether changes in these transmembrane domains may modulate resistance to Plasmodium by changing the subcellular localisation of PfCRT. there was no difference in abundance or localisation between the two forms, and both were exclusively intracellularly localised, with no detectable fraction at the plasma membrane. proteins that regulate the activation of ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) proteins are involved in a wide range of functions, including regulation of ER and Golgi function and morphology, ER-to-Golgi transport, and recruitment of COP and adaptor protein complex proteins. we also examined the BFA sensitivity of the inducibly expressed PfCRT-GFP fusion, and found that BFA produced a defect in traffic from the ER/Go dynamin-like proteins may be involved in the trafficking of proteins from the ER/Golgi to the FV, potentially through its action in completing budding of vesicles. this suggests that dynamin-like proteins may be involved in the trafficking of proteins from the ER/Golgi to the FV. earliest PfCRT-bound compartments already contain haemoglobin. it is unclear if these secondary compartments derive from parcels of haemozoin from the cytostomal invagination that have already recruited PfCRT but have failed to fuse with the existing FV membrane. significant emission spectrum overlap between Nile Red and GFP prevented colocalisation experiments with PfCRT-GFP using available imaging equipment. this is partly because other lines expressing transgenic PfCRT have had weeks of growth at least to compensate for any negative effects of the mutant PfCRT [32] we had initially intended to study inducibly over-expressed PfCRT forms without the GFP fusion to investigate this effect. some PfCRT antibodies are available, but none were reliably specific in our hands. development of a superior inducible system in P. falciparum may also address these issues."}
