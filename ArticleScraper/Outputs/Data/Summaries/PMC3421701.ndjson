{"summary": "intracellular parasites require host cell machinery to internalize, replicate, and disseminate. endocytic routes to enter cells must exit endocytic vesicles. reoviruses have a broad host range and infect most mammalian species. id protein 3 and conformational rearrangement of outer-capsid protein 1 allow endosomal membrane penetration and release of transcriptionally active viral core particles into the cytoplasm. reovirus virions localize to early, late, and recycling endosomes during entry into host cells. reovirus virions traverse several endocytic compartments during cell entry. only a fraction of these virions use a pathway that leads to productive infection. reovirus strain type 1 Lang (T1L) is a laboratory stock. equivalence of 1 U of optical density at 260 nm to 2.1 1012 particles (51) Virus titers were determined by plaque assay using L929 cells. a rabbit antiserum raised against T1L (59) was purified by protein A-Sepharose. PCR amplification was followed by restriction enzyme digestion and insertion of the Rab13 fragment into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pEGFP-C1. RILP lacking the amino-terminal 212 amino acids (RILP212N) was amplified by PCR using RILP-C33 FWD and RILP-C33 REV oligonucleotide primers. reovirus particles (3 1012) were diluted into fresh 0.05 M sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.5) and incubated with 10 M succinimidyl ester A546 or pHrodo at room temperature for 90 min in the dark. titers following labeling were determined by plaque assay using L929 cells. nuclei were visualized by incubating cells with TO-PRO-3 (Invitrogen) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 642 (A642; 1:1,000) in PBS-BGT for 1 h. images were captured using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta laser-scanning confocal microscope. cells were plated on 35-mm glass-bottom microwell dishes (MatTek Co.) and adsorbed with reovirus at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. images were captured every 30.5 s (10.5-s scan time and 20-s intervals between scans) for 30 min. cells were analyzed with a BD LSRII flow cytometer and cell staining was quantified using FlowJo software. the cells were washed once with PBS, detached with Cellstripper, quenched with FACS buffer, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 20 h. the cells were then washed once with PBS, detached with Cellstripper, and quenched with FACS buffer. the cells were washed once with PBS, fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) at 4\u00b0C for 20 min, washed twice with Perm/Wash (BD Biosciences) and incubated with reovirus-specific polyclonal antiserum (1:20,000) at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. the cells were analyzed with a BD LSRII flow cytometer. pyruvate (Sigma) per ml, penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B. Reovirus strain type 1 Lang (T1L) is a laboratory stock. working stocks of virus were prepared by plaque purification and passage using L929 cells (57) purified virions were generated from second-passage L929 cell-lysate stocks. ively active Rab4A and Rab4B (Marci Scidmore, Cornell University), Rab5A and Rab7 (Walter Atwood, Brown University), Rab5C (Philip Stahl, Washington University), Rab9 (Suzanne Pfeffer, Stanford University), Rab11 (James Goldenring, Vanderbilt University), and Rab34 (Carolyn Coyne, University of Pittsburgh) were appended at the amino terminus with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reovirus virions were labeled with succinimidyl ester Alexa Fluor 546 (A546) or pHrodo SE (pHrodo; Invitrogen) as described previously (19, 27). reovirus particles were diluted into fresh 0.05 M sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.5) and incubated with 10 M succinimidyl ester A546 or pHrodo at room temperature for 90 min in the dark. cell washed once with PBS and fixed for 20 min with 5 to 10% formalin. cells were incubated with 1% Triton X-100 for 5 min and PBS-BGT for 10 min. cells were incubated with reovirus-specific polyclonal antiserum (1:1,000) in PBS-BGT. virions within the boundary of single cells were quantified. the percentage of internalized viral particles was determined using HeLa cells plated on #1.5 glass coverslips adsorbed with A546-labeled reovirus. cells were fixed with 5% formalin and stained as described except that PBS-BG was used instead of PBS-BGT. cells were washed twice in FACS buffer, pelleted, and stained in FACS buffer. cells were analyzed with a BD LSRII flow cytometer. cell staining was quantified using FlowJo software. the cells were washed once with PBS, fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) and incubated with reovirus-specific polyclonal antiserum (1:20,000) at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. reovirus traffics through the endocytic compartment during cell entry. the cells were chilled at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, adsorbed at 4\u00b0C with reovirus particles. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C over a time course of reovirus entry. reovirus particles traffic through early and fast recycling compartments during entry. ovirus also show internalized particles as early as 0 min (34), findings consistent with the internalization of transferrin into early endosomes. reovirus particles colocalize with markers of endocytic compartments. the acidic environment of late endosomes or endolysosomes provides a likely intracellular compartment for the reovirus disassembly events. to determine whether reovirus accesses late endosomes during cell entry, we assayed the colocalization of reovirus particles with Rab7 (Fig. 1F), Rab9 (Fig. 1G), and RILP. reovirus particles distributed with JAM-A during cell entry. cells were chilled at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, adsorbed, incubated at 37\u00b0C for 0, 20, or 60 min. overexpression of Rab4, Rab5A, Rab5C, and Rab7 did not affect colocalization. cells were stained for JAM-A and reovirus, imaged by confocal microscopy. cells were stained for spectral overlap between JAM-A and reovirus particles (A) or JAM-A, reovirus particles, and Rab-marked organelles (B) reovirus and reovirus particles colocalized with endosomes containing Rab 13. reovirus particles are internalized and traffic with JAM-A through early, late, and recycling endocytic compartments. reovirus particles transiently traverse through endosomes marked by Rab5A or Rab11. reovirus particles transiently colocalized with Rab5A, Rab5C, and Rab11 for the first 30 min of infection. reovirus particles transiently colocalized with Rab5A, Rab5C, and Rab11 for the first 30 min of infection. time lapses were analyzed to track individual viral particles during residence in specific endosomes. s label reovirus particles distributing to endosomes marked with EGFP-Rab5A or EGFP-Rab11. the mean dwell time is shown for each Rab GTPase. reovirus particles access an acidified intracellular compartment during cell entry. the cells were incubated in complete medium (Untreated) or supplemented with 20 mM NH4Cl at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, chilled at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, and adsorbed with either complete medium (Mock) or 5,000 particles of reovirus-pHrodo/cell at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. the inoculum was removed, the unbound virus was washed away, and the cells were either fixed with 1% PFA escence intensity was decreased in comparison to untreated control cells. reovirus particles distribute to acidified compartments between 20 and 60 min. reovirus particles distribute to acidified compartments during cell entry. expression of dominant-negative Rab5A and Rab7 impairs reovirus virions from accessing an acidified compartment. cells were transfected with EGFP, EGFP-tagged versions of dominant-negative Rab4, Rab5A, Rab7, Rab11, or Rab34 or left untransfected 24 h prior to infection. expression of dominant-negative Rab4, Rab5A, Rab7, or Rab11 did not alter cell surface expression of JAM-A or 1 integrin. dominant-negative Rab GTPases do not regulate the steady-state cell surface expression of either JAM-A or 1 integrin. cells were chilled at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, adsorbed with reovirus particles at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. internalized fluorescently labeled viral particles were distinguished from extracellular viral particles that were stained with reovirus antiserum. the cells were chilled at 4\u00b0C for 1 h and adsorbed with 1,000 particles of reovirus-A546/cell at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. the cells were either fixed with 5% formalin or supplemented with complete medium and incubated at 37\u00b0C for the times shown. the cells were stained with reovirus-specific antiserum without permeabilization. cells were adsorbed with reovirus at an MOI of

cells were adsorbed with reovirus at an MOI of 0.5 PFU/cell. the inoculum was removed, the unbound virus was washed away. the cells were supplemented with complete medium and incubated for 20 h. reovirus traffics through the endocytic compartment during cell entry. spectral overlap between reovirus and Rab4 showed statistically significant colocalization at 20, 60, and 120 min. reovirus particles traffic through early and recycling compartments during entry. reovirus particles in Rab5A- and Rab5C-marked endosomes traffic with different kinetics. cells were chilled and adsorbed with 5,000 particles/cell of reovirus-A546 (red) at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. cells were either fixed with 10% formalin or supplemented with complete medium. cells were imaged by confocal microscopy. reovirus particles accesses late endosomes during cell entry. reovirus-infected cells transfected with Rab7 and stained for early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) revealed that 60 min after infection, 19% of reovirus particles that colocalize with Rab7 also distribute with EEA1. these particles likely delineate a population of virions that are transitioning from early to late endosomes. spectral overlap of reovirus particles and JAM-A showed consistent colocalization of reovirus and JAM-A over time. overexpression of Rab13, which regulates tight-junction formation (37) and colocalizes with JAM-A (61), diminished the colocalization of reovirus and JAM-A at 60 min. spectral overlap is shown as the percent colocalization (n = 11 cells per time point, average of 468 particles per time point) arrows indicate areas of JAM-A, EGFP-Rab7, and reovirus colocalization. reovirus and JAM-A colocalized with endosomes containing Rab 13. despite the fact that Rab13 overexpression decreases the percentage of viral particles associated with JAM-A at 60 min. reovirus particles transiently traverse through endosomes marked by Rab5A, Rab5C, or Rab11. ral particles had an average dwell time of 102.7 s in Rab5A-marked endosomes, 88.5 s in Rab5C-marked endosomes, and 96.1 s in Rab11-marked endosomes. reovirus particles distribute into endosomal compartments marked by Rab5A, Rab5C, or Rab11 in a temporal manner, with particles residing within these compartments for less than 2 min. reovirus particles labeled with either A546 or pHrodo maintained signal intensity throughout the time course. labeling of reovirus particles with either A546 or pHrodo did not significantly alter the viral particle/PFU ratio. 5,000 particles of reovirus-pHrodo/cell were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. the cells were either fixed with 1% PFA or supplemented with complete medium. the cells were either fixed with 1% PFA or supplemented with complete medium. nontransfected cells were transfected with EGFP

the unbound virus was washed away. cells were incubated in complete medium at 37\u00b0C for 90 min. cells were transfected with EGFP or EGFP-tagged versions of dominant-negative Rab4, Rab5A, Rab7, or Rab11 24 h prior to infection. gray peaks represent JAM-A, 1 integrin, or reovirus fluorescence intensity in EGFP-positive cells. viral particles were distinguished from extracellular viral particles stained with reovirus antiserum (blue) cells expressing dominant-negative Rab5A and Rab5C displayed modest reductions in the percentage of internalized particles. expression of dominant-negative Rab7 resulted in a slightly higher percentage of internalized particles at 60 min. the cells were stained with reovirus-specific antiserum without permeabilization. the data are expressed as the percentage of internalized particles. the data are expressed as the percentage of internalized particles (n = 12 cells per time point, average of 391 particles per time point) reovirus infectivity was significantly decreased in cells expressing constitutively active Rab5A (Q79L) or Rab5C (Q80L), which each impair early endosome maturation (28, 46) reovirus infectivity was minimally affected by expression of wild-type, dominant negative, or constitutively active forms of Rab4 or Rab11. cells were permeabilized, stained with reovirus-specific antiserum. the data are expressed as the percentage of infected cells in EGFP-positive populations normalized to the percentage of infected cells in the nontransfected, EGFP-negative population. virions in the nonproductive pathway enter endosomes marked by Rab5A or Rab5C. disassembly intermediate penetrates endosomal membranes, releasing the transcriptionally active viral core into the cytoplasm. presence of viral particles in recycling endosomes during cell entry also has been observed for other viruses. the majority of viral particles do not give rise to productive infection. however, it remains unclear what percentage of reovirus particles will infect cells. reovirus particles localize to organelles marked by Rab5A and Rab5C. ovirus infection of some tissues does not require JAM-A (1). expression of constitutively active forms of Rab5A or Rab5C diminished reovirus infectivity to similar levels. if so, blocking endosomal trafficking with one dominant-negative Rab5 isoform would not be expected to impede the capacity of the virus to access early endosomes. the affinity of reovirus attachment protein 1 for JAM-A (24) may be sufficient to allow the virus-receptor complex to traffic to a specific intracellular site where viral disassembly takes place. reovirus requires an acidic environment for cathepsin-mediated proteolytic disassembly (2, 16), which is required for release of the transcriptionally active viral core into the cytoplasm. reovirus is internalized via clathrin-dependent endocytosis, the preferred method of entry for reovirus (18, 34), suggesting that reovirus is unlikely to mediate signaling events that target the virus to a productive entry route. reovirus also requires activation of Src kinase to efficiently enter cells. reovirus uses the cellular endocytic sorting machinery to gain access to an acidic endocytic compartment marked by Rab7 or Rab9 to productively enter cells. virulent human pathogens, including Ebola virus (49), Old World arenaviruses (43), and SARS coronavirus (30, 53, 58) require access to late endosomes to productively infect cells."}
