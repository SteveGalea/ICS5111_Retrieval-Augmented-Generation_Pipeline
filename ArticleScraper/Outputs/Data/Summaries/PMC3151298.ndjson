{"summary": "tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a common mechanism in the progression of chronic kidney disease to end-stage renal disease [1], [2]. integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1: L2 integrin) is the predominant integrin on leukocytes and an important molecule in firm adhesion and migration of leukocytes to inflammatory sites [4], [5]. al-mesenchymal transition plays pivotal roles in organ fibrosis. a large proportion of interstitial fibroblasts in fibrotic kidneys originate from proximal tubular cells. it is important to identify the molecules involved in the induction and progression of EMT of RTECs. TGF-1 increased expression of chemokines that mediate LFA-1 activation of PBMCs on HK-2 cells. expression of CCL3 and CXCL12 increased on HK-2 cells after stimulation of TGF-1 (10.0 ng/ml, 1.0 ng/ml and 0.1 ng/ml for 24 hrs in a dose-dependent manner. HK-2 cells stimulated with TGF-1 induced conformational activation of LFA-1 on PBMCs. HK-2 cells were up-regulated by TGF-1 stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. values are expressed as mean SEM of at least three experiments. HK-2 cells did not increase CCL3 expression regardless of TGF-1 stimulation. PBMCs were co-cultured with CXCL12 KD, CCL3 KD, Control or Mock HK-2 cells after stimulation with TGF-1 (0.1 ng/ml) for 30 minutes. less AL57-positive cells were detected among PBMCs after co-culture with CXCL12KD HK-2 cells. PBMCs were grown with non-treated HK-2 cells (Mock), CXCL12 knockdown HK-2 cells (CXCL12KD), CCL3 knockdown HK-2 cells (HCCL3KD) or non-targeted-siRNA-transfected HK-2 cells (Control) following TGF-1 (0.1 ng/ml) stimulation for 30 minutes. changes of epithelial cell junction markers and mesenchymal markers on HK-2-TGF-1 (0.1)-PBMCs were investigated by real-time RT-PCR and western blotting analysis. HK-2 cells after stimulation of TGF-1 (0.1 ng/ml) without co-culture with PBMCs were investigated as control experiments. markers on HK-2-TGF-1 (0.1)-PBMCs significantly decreased. changes of epithelial markers (E-cadherin and occludin) and mesenchymal markers (vimentin and fibronectin 1) increased in HK-2-TGF-1 (0.1)-PBMCs compared with those of controls. HK-2 cells co-cultured with PBMCs for 24 hrs without TGF-1 stimulation. HK-2 cells co-cultured with PBMCs for 24 hrs without TGF-1 stimulation. HK-2 cells were pre-incubated with anti-ICAM-1 mAb for 20 minutes. HK-2 cells without co-culture with PBMCs following TGF-1 stimulation for 24 hrs. HK-2 cells without stimulation of TGF-1 co-cultured with PBMCs were investigated as control. HK-2 cells without TGF-1 stimulation were co-cultured in lower plate. HK-2 cells with pre-stimulated TGF-1 (10.0 ng/ml, 1.0 ng/ml and 0.1 ng/ml) were cultured in upper insert in transwell plate.

HK-2 cells treated with TGF-1 (10.0 ng/ml) (HK-2-TGF-1 (10) served as controls of TGF-1-induced full EMT of HK-2 cells. snail and slug signaling and a-SMA expression significantly increased in HK-2-TGF-1 (0.1)-PBMCs, HK-2-TGF-1 (0.1) and HK-2-PBMCs compared with those of Mock. expressions of snail and slug signaling and -smooth muscle actin (-SMA) were determined by real-time RT-PCR. non-treated HK-2 cells (Mock), HK-2 cells treated with TGF-1 (0.1 ng/ml) and HK-2 cells without TGF-1 treatment with co-cultured with PBMCs. ICAM-1 expression decreased with TGF-1 stimulation at concentrations of 10.0 ng/ml, 1.0 ng/ml and 0.1 ng/ml after 24 hrs in a dose-dependent manner. expression also showed a time-dependent decrease at 24 hrs, 48 hrs and 72 hrs after TGF-1 (10.0 ng/ml) stimulation. CL5, CCL17, CCL19, CCL20, CCL21, CCL22 and CXCL12, was investigated on HK-2 cells after stimulation of TGF-1 (10.0 ng/ml, 1.0 ng/ml and 0.1 ng/ml) the expression of CCL3 and CXCL12 increased on HK-2 cells after TGF-1 stimulation at concentrations of 10.0 ng/ml, 1.0 ng/ml and 0.1 ng/ml flow cytometry used anti-LFA-1 mAb (clone: TS1/22) to detect total LFA-1 on PBMCs and anti-active form LFA-1 mAb (clone: AL-57) that reacted only with the active form of LFA-1 but not with the resting form of LFA-1. PBMCs were co-cultured with HK-2 cells stimulated by TGF-1 (0.1 ng/ml) for 30 minutes. PBMCs were grown alone (Mock), with HK-2 cells (HK-2), with TGF-1 (0.1 ng/ml) (TGF-1) or with HK-2 cells following TGF-1 stimulation (HK-2-TGF-1) for 30 minutes. total LFA-1 on PBMCs and active form of LFA-1 were stained with anti-LFA-1 mAb or the anti-active form of LFA-1 mAb. active form of LFA-1 stained with anti-LFA-1 mAb or anti-active form of LFA-1 mAb. cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. HK-2 cells without stimulation of TGF-1 co-cultured with PBMCs were investigated as control experiments. the results of real-time RT-PCR showed that expression of epithelial cell junction markers (E-cadherin and occludin) further significantly decreased and that of mesenchymal markers (vimentin and fibronectin 1) further significantly increased in HK-2-TGF-1 (0.1)-PBMCs compared with those of controls. HK-2 cells were co-cultured with PBMCs for 24 hrs following TGF-1 stimulation for 24 hrs. the changes of epithelial markers (E-cadherin and occludin) and mesenchymal markers (vimentin and fibronectin 1) were assessed by real-time RT-PCR. PBMCs were pre-incubated with anti-ICAM-1 mAb for 20 minutes. HK-2 cells co-cultured with PBMCs for 24 hrs following TGF-1 (0.1 ng/ml) stimulation for 24 hrs (E). HK-2 cells pre-incubated with anti-ICAM-1 mAb following TGF-1 (0.1 ng/ml) stimulation for 24 hrs (F). HK-2 cells without stimulation of TGF-1 co-cultured with PBMCs were co-cultured in lower plate and HK-2 cells with pre-stimulated TGF-1 (10.0 ng/ml, 1.0 ng/ml and 0.1 ng/ml) were cultured in upper insert. the interaction of LFA-1 on PBMCs and ICAM-1 on HK-2 cells activated ERK 1/2 signaling on HK-2 cells. the phosphorylation of smad2 and smad3 was not detected. however, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was detected in HK-2-TGF-1 (0.1)-PBMCs at 4 hrs and 12 hrs after co-culture by western blot analysis. HK-2 cells were pre-incubated with anti-ICAM-1 mAb for 20 minutes. HK-2 cells were pre-incubated with anti-ICAM-1 mAb for 20 minutes. the interaction of PBMCs and HK-2 cells pre-stimulated with TGF-1 contributed to the part of EMT of HK-2 cells. migration of HK-2-TGF-1 (0.1)-PBMCs increased at 72 hrs and 96 hrs. migration of HK-2-TGF-1 (0.1)-PBMCs did not change compared with those of Mock, HK-2-TGF-1 (0.1) and HK-2-PBMCs at 48 hrs, 72 hrs and 96 hrs. non-treated HK-2 cells (Mock), HK-2 cells treated with TGF-1 (0.1 ng/ml) (TGF-1 (0.1)) and HK-2 cells treated with TGF-1 at 10 ng/ml (TGF-1 (10) served as controls. values are expressed as mean SEM of at least three experiments. HK-2 cells stimulated by TGF-1 induced conformational activation of LFA-1 on PBMCs. however, HK-2 cells without stimulation by TGF-1 alone did not induce conformational activation of LFA-1 on PBMCs. CCL3 and CXCL12 were reported to activate LFA-1 on both monocytes and lymphocytes. less AL57-positive cells were detected among PBMCs after co-culture with CXCL12 knockdown HK cells pre-stimulated with TGF-1. we conducted real-time RT-PCR to detect the change of the TGF-1 mRNA in the HK-2 cells that underwent EMT and PBMCs separately at several time points after co-culture. however, we could not detect up-regulation of TGF-1 mRNA in both these HK-2 cells and PBMCs. the up-regulation of TGF-1 concentrations of the co-culture media of HK-2 cells and PBMCs also suggested the possibility of autocrine and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was detected on HK-2 cells after stimulation of TGF-1 co-cultured with PBMCs. this phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was blocked by anti-LFA-1 mAb or anti-ICAM-1 mAb. further study will be needed to investigate the mechanism and significance of the regulation of ICAM-1 expression. we characterized the EMT of HK-2-TGF-1 (0.1)-PBMCs compared with full EMT of HK-2 induced by TGF-1 (HK-2-TGF-1 (10). however, that of HK-2-TGF-1 (0.1)-PBMCs did not change compared with those of Mock, HK-2-TGF-1 (0.1) and HK-2-PBMCs at 48 hrs, 72 hrs and 96 hrs. a large proportion of the interstitial fibroblasts in fibrotic kidneys have been reported to originate from proximal tubular cells in an animal model. inflammatory mononuclear leukocytes contributed to renal fibrosis by accelerating EMT of HK-2 cells induced by TGF-1.
