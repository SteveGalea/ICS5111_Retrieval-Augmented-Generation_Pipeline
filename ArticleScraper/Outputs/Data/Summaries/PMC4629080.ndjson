{"summary": "influenza viruses have caused significant morbidity in the last and in this century1. to date, influenza-specific drugs include M2 ion channel blockers (amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) both of which were approved to prevent and treat influenza2. luciferase activity was not necessary, and the measurement of luciferase activity was simple and time-saving. a stable cell line derived from 293T cell was established, named 293T-Gluc. it synthesizes the reporter protein Gluc when infected with influenza A virus. titers were determined on MDCK cells and represented as the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) these viruses were provided kindly by Dr. Yuelong Shu at China CDC. cells were seeded in the wells of 96-well plate at 100 L/well. after an overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2, cells were infected with the indicated influenza viruses. infection was allowed to proceed for 24 h at 35 \u00b0C. a stock of coelenterazine-h was prepared in ethanol to a concentration of 1.022 mmol/L. before assay the stock was diluted into PBS by a factor of 60. for luminescence analysis, 60 L of working solution was added to 10 L of cell-free conditioned medium. ive dose (TCID50), as previously described13, was provided kindly by Dr. Yuelong Shu at China CDC. the microsource library (2000 compounds) was obtained from commercial sources and compounds from this library were dissolved in DMSO at 2 mmol/L. 105 cells/mL were seeded in the wells of 96-well plate at 100 L/well. after an overnight incubation at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2, cells were infected with the indicated influenza viruses. post-infection medium also contained TPCK-treated trypsin. luciferase activity assay A stock of coelenterazine-h was prepared in ethanol to a concentration of 1.022 mmol/L and stored at \u201320 \u00b0C. the working solution was held for 30 min at room temperature in the dark to stabilize it14. influenza A/WSN/33 strain exhibited the most potent ability to induce luciferase activity when the cells were infected at identical MOIs. therefore, influenza A/WSN/33 virus was used for all subsequent experiments. 0.1 or higher induced a Gluc signal at 12 h post-infection. signal intensity significantly increased thereafter and reached a peak at 36 h post-infection. this may explain the observation that the Gluc signal from the cells infected at an MOI of 1 was less than that of 0.1. amantadine hydrochloride, approved for the treatment of influenza infections, acts in the early phase of the life cycle of influenza A virus to target the M2 ion channel18, 19. it impedes influenza A virus replication by triggering the aggregation of NP and inhibits its nuclear accumulation20. a robust assay should have a Z\u2032 factor>0.5 and the larger the value of Z\u2032 factor, the better the data quality of the assay26. the Z\u2032 factor in our experiments was 0.84 (n=48), which is considered to be excellent for use in HTS.
