{"summary": "in developed countries, the number of viral respiratory episodes per year has been estimated between 6 and 10 in children before school age versus 3 to 5 in those after this age. ARI represents the cause of 30 to 40% of hospital admissions in this category of patients [1] [2]. a wide range of pathogens are involved in ARI, including bacteria and viruses. kits were compared to a combination of biplex PCR tests used as gold standard on a panel of respiratory secretions selected for their content in various infectious agent(s) the kits were compared to a combination of biplex PCR tests used as gold standard on a panel of respiratory secretions selected for their content in various infectious agent(s) the results were short-time return to clinicians. amplification was performed on GeneAmp\u00ae PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems) the size of PCR products was read on a TapeStation after electrophoresis using ScreenTape. kit C corresponds to the Magicplex RV Panel Real-time Test (Seegene Inc.), and the detection of PCR products was done on ABI7500 (Applied Biosystems) the real-time PCR reactions were performed on an ABI7500fast (Applied Biosystems) the viruses and/or bacteria that could be detected by the 7 kits mentioned above are listed in Table 1. 88 respiratory samples were selected for the study. one half being nasal swab and one half being respiratory secretions. no informed consent was required from the patients. the results of these screening tests were taken into consideration for the selection of a representative diversity of respiratory pathogens. the samples were fractionated blindly (by M.L.) into 7 tubes containing 200 l of specimen and frozen at 80\u00b0C. for each technique tested, one aliquot of each specimen was thawed and nucleic acids were extracted using the NUCLISENS\u00ae easyMAGTM. kit B corresponds to the Seeplex\u00ae RV15 OneStep ACE Detection and Pneumobacter ACE Detection (Seegene Inc., Seoul, South Korea); a GeneAmp\u00ae PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems) was used for amplification and the size of PCR products was read on a TapeStation after electrophoresis using ScreenTape. kit E corresponds to xTAG\u00ae respiratory Viral Panel fast (Ab a combination of 7 duplex Respiratory Multi Well System r-geneTM (Influenza A/B, RSV/hMPV, Rhino&EV/CC, AD/hBoV, Chla/Myco pneumo, HCoV/HPIV and Bordetella) commercialized by Argene/bioM\u00e9rieux (Marcy l\u2019Etoile, France) the real-time PCR reactions were performed on an ABI7500fast ( diff between the 4 types Yes w diff between the 4 types Adenoviruses Yes (A to G) Yes Yes Yes (B and E only) Bocavirus Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes No No No No Chlamydophila pneumoniae Yes Yes Yes No No No Bordetella pertussis Yes Yes Yes No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No the results of these screening tests were taken into consideration for the selection of a representative diversity of respiratory pathogens. the samples were fractionated blindly (by M.L.) into 7 tubes containing 200 l of specimen and frozen at 80\u00b0C. the nucleic acids were extracted using the NUCLISENS\u00ae easyMAGTM (bioM\u00e9rieux) in presence of 20 l of proteinase K (10 mg/ml) the number of pathogens considered to be present in the panel of the 88 samples was as depicted in Table 2. the performances of each kit are summarized in Table 3 for viruses and in Table 4 for bacteria. pathogens tested No. of positive specimens with the reference test Performances Evaluated kits A B C D E F Influenza A 7 sensitivity. 0.42[0.08;
