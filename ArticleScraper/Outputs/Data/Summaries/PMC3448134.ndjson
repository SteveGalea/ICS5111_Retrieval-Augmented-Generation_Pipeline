{"summary": "microorganisms are critical to ecosystem functioning and are involved in biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, and metals, as well as degradation or stabilization of contaminants in the environment. culture-independent approaches must be used to gain a comprehensive picture of microbial communities. many functional genes have too much variance or too few sequences available. MICROARRAYS VS. HIGH-THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING This review will focus on functional gene microarrays. MICROARRAYS VS. HIGH-THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING. microarrays interrogate samples against the same set of sequences (probes) microarrays are not affected in the same way since lesser abundance sequences will still hybridize to their corresponding probe. some new techniques have been developed to allow the discovery of new sequences. first FGA developed used PCR-amplicon probes and targeted four N-cycling genes. but only a limited number of genes could be included because conserved primers can only be designed for a few functional genes. geoChip 2.0 contains 24,243 (50-mer) oligonucleotide probes targeting 10,000 functional genes from 150 gene families involved in geochemical cycling of C, N, and P cycling, sulfate reduction, metal reduction and resistance. the most comprehensive FGAs reported to date are the geoChip arrays. geoChip 3.0 covers 56,990 sequences from 292 gene families. new gene categories include antibiotic resistance, energy processing, and phylogenetic markers (gyrB) new gene categories include antibiotic resistance, energy processing, and phylogenetic markers. geoChip 4.0 contains 83,992 probes targeting 152,414 genes in 410 gene categories. new categories added include stress response, antibiotic resistance, and bacteriophage genes. it has been used to examine microbial communities during the 2010 Gulf oil spill. microarrays are not affected in the same way since lesser abundance sequences will still hybridize to their corresponding probe. as long as it is above the detection limit, it will be detected. some new microarray techniques have been developed to allow the discovery of new sequences. most microarrays now use oligonucleotide probes, which are more specific (Zhou, 2003; Zhou, 2003; Gentry et al., 2006) the most comprehensive FGAs reported to date are the geoChip arrays. geoChip 2.0 contains 24,243 (50-mer) oligonucleotide probes targeting 10,000 functional genes from 150 gene families involved in geochemical cycling of C, N, and P cycling. new gene categories include antibiotic resistance, energy processing, and phylogenetic markers. a set of 16S rRNA gene probes were added as positive controls. human, plant, or hyperthermophile gene probes were added as negative controls. a common oligo reference standard (CORS) was added for data normalization. genes for enzymes or proteins that are key to the process of interest are selected. these could be catalytic subunits or proteins with recognition sites. the keywords should be as broad as possible since proteins from different microorganisms may be annotated differently or have more general or specific annotations. glass slides are more frequently used since they have less background fluorescence. a few companies synthesize custom microarrays using a customer\u2019s probe set. TARGET PREPARATION GeoChip can be hybridized with either DNA or RNA. mRNA obtained from 0.4\u20132.0 g total RNA per 0.5 g soil. nucleic acid quality is of great importance for microarray analysis. DNA and RNA should have an A260 to A280 ratio 1.8 and >1.9. WCRA provides a representative amplification with 50\u2013100 ng of starting material. commercial kits available for microbial RNA amplification such as MessageAmpTM II-Bacteria RNA Amplification Kit. for geoChip data, there is a data analysis pipeline2 for rapid preprocessing and data analysis. negative spots and outliers, based on Grubbs\u2019 test of outliers, are removed and then the signal intensities of all spots are normalized. data or hierarchical cluster analysis can be used to compare communities. t-tests, t-tests, and dissimilarity tests can be used. a relatively new analysis method is the random matrix theory-based neural network analysis (NNA) HMMER confirmed sequences are then used to design gene- or group-specific 50-mer oligonucleotide probes. the probes are then BLASTed against the GenBank database to confirm specificity. the newly designed probe sets can then be commercially synthesized. TARGET PREPARATION GeoChip can be hybridized with either DNA or RNA. most DNA samples used for geoChip analysis are extracted using a freeze-grind method with detergent lysis. mRNA is unstable and has a low abundance in environmental samples. a gel purification strategy followed by a phenol\u2013chloroform\u2013butanol extraction has been successful with a wide range of soil and sediment samples. large amounts of DNA (e.g., 1 g) or RNA (e.g., 5 g) are needed for geoChip hybridization. however, it can be difficult to get sufficient quantities of nucleic acid from some types of samples. the amplified nucleic acids are directly labeled with a fluorescent dye (Cy3 or Cy5). the labeled nucleic acids are then hybridized to the microarray at 42\u201350\u00b0C with 40\u201350% formamide. DATA ANALYSIS Due to the large volume of data obtained from GeoChip, data analysis can be very challenging. the data has a multivariate structure and the number of variables is much larger than the number of observations (pn) a relatively new analysis method is the random matrix theory-based (Mehta, 1990) neural network analysis (NNA) used to examine gene relationships within microbial ecological networks. nucleic acids can be purified using commercial kits but the presence of humic acids and other contaminants can still be a problem. new methods of array construction to increase probe density are needed. specificity and sensitivity can be improved at various stages of microarray design, construction, target preparation, or hybridization. amplification of community DNA can increase sensitivity. cyanine dye-doped nanoparticles or tyramide signal amplification labeling are able to increase sensitivity 10-fold. a lower hybridization solution volume (Shalon et al., 1996) and mixing during hybridization (Adey et al., 2002) have both been shown to increase sensitivity. polyphosphate kinase were detected, consistent with reactor operation. urea cycling, denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate, nitrite reduction, and N fixation were occurring. microcosms were set up from soil samples collected from a tree growing in a PCB-contaminated site. each new GeoChip version has expanded the coverage of gene variants and expands the number of genes covered. this continued expansion is challenging as the number of gene sequences available is constantly increasing. WCGA representatively amplify 1\u2013250 ng of community DNA. labeling methods can also affect sensitivity. cyanine dye-doped nanoparticles or tyramide signal amplification labeling can increase sensitivity 10-fold. genes for nitrate and nitrite reduction, organic contaminant degradation, sulfite reduction, and polyphosphate kinase were detected, consistent with reactor operation. mRNA can be used for fGA analysis to monitor activity. geoChip 2.0 was used to examine the microbial communities during different phases of operation. sulfate, pH, U, and Tc were found to be the most important drivers in determining the microbial community structure. genes associated with denitrification, organic contaminant degradation, metal resistance, and sulfite reduction were detected. stability of bioreduced U(IV) was examined by allowing system to enter periods of starvation (ethanol injections were halted) and reoxidation (dissolved O2 entered the system) functional communities showed distinct clustering patterns based on whether the system received ethanol or not, indicating a shift in community structure. acetate, U(VI) and redox potential were important environmental variables in determining the microbial community structure. Xie et al. (2011) examined five AMD sites in china using GeoChip 2.0 to determine the functional diversity and metabolic potential of microbial communities. microbial communities from the rhizosphere of the arsenic-hyperaccumulating plant Pteris vittata and non-rhizosphere samples were examined using geoChip 3.0 (Xiong et al., 2010). the functional gene diversity was significantly correlated with As concentration. microbial community associated with a bioremediation system was examined with the geoChip 1.0 (Rodrguez-Martnez et al., 2006) genes involved in the degradation of diesel fuel and other organic contaminants were detected. increased signal intensities for genes involved in anaerobic benzoate degradation indicated a shift toward anaerobiosis over time. the most important environmental factors in determining the microbial community structure were oil concentration and soil available nitrogen. results from geoChip 2.0 indicated communities from uncontaminated sites had higher functional gene diversity than those from contaminated sites in the same geographical area. microbial communities in the Gulf of Mexico were capable of intrinsic bioremediation and that the presence of the oil stimulated the oil-degrading community members. the aquifer with the highest level of contamination had the highest number of genes, most involved in contaminant degradation. microbial communities in spiked soils included dioxygenases involved in aromatic compound degradation, genes involved in the degradation of PAHs (nahA, rhda, nahQ, narR), and genes involved in the degradation of one-ring aromatic compounds. sulfate, pH, U, and Tc were found to be the most important drivers in determining the microbial community structure. a pilot-scale field bioremediation system used ethanol as an electron donor to stimulate microbial communities and immobilize U(VI) by reduction to U(IV) the sediment microbial community was examined with geoChip 2.0 after 2 years of operation. the inner loop communities had higher gene numbers and greater diversity than those in the outer loop. ethanol injections stimulated the microbial communities in the inner loop. Xie et al. (2011) examined five AMD sites in china using geoChip 2.0 to determine the functional diversity and metabolic potential of microbial communities. the sites showed a great deal of variability in regards to the microbial communities with 150\u20131000 functional genes detected in each sample. rhizosphere samples had a lower level of As compared to non-rhizosphere samples. rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere microbial communities were distinct. increased signal intensities for genes involved in anaerobic benzoate degradation indicated a shift toward anaerobiosis over time. many oil degradation genes (benzene, benzoate, catechol, polyaromatic hydrocarbon aromatics, protocatechuate, phthalate) were detected with geoChip 2.0. microbial communities in oil-contaminated water were capable of intrinsic bioremediation. the presence of the hydrocarbon plume caused a shift in the microbial community functional structure and composition. many genes associated with hydrocarbon degradation were significantly enriched in plume samples. sediments from industrial pollutant and pesticide-contaminated sites were examined with GeoChip 2.0. the results indicated that contaminant level was not a major driver in these systems. most of the reductive dehalogenation genes detected were from Dehalococcoides spp., suggesting that this microorganism may play an important role in contaminant degradation. phenoxyacetic acid herbicides (ftdA) atrazine (atzABC, trzN, trzA, trzE) were detected in all wells. the environmental variables (pH, sulfate, ammonia, and dissolved organic carbon) had significant effects on the community structure."}
