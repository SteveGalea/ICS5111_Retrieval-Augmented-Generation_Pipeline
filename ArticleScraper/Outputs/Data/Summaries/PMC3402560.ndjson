{"summary": "the use of geographical information systems (GIS) in health service planning & provision remains to be explored. the aim of this paper is to provide an introduction to GIS and how it can be used. the current state of GIS use in health care is intrinsic to the fields of epidemiology and public health. map where things are Their most basic use is simply to map where things are. in the case of the WHO, it may be where to send their expertise and resources; or at a more local level it may be where to build a new hospital. it is quite another for a developing country, such as india, to state that \"without computers and the Internet, we are fighting 21st century health problems with 19th century tools [6]\" map densities We need to look at further complexities such as density mapping. by mapping density we can map areas with different populations on an equivalent basis. if we see increased mortality in a specific area we can look to see what might be causing that. we can study how emergency patterns change from day to day to help decide where ambulances should be stationed. we need to be concerned with the validity of the data we're mapping. we can also look at what's happening inside a specific area. map change We can map the change in an area (Figure 1) to anticipate future conditions, decide on a course of action, or to evaluate the results of an action or policy. for example, we can study how emergency patterns change from day to day to help decide where ambulances should be stationed. in 2003, McLafferty [14] summarized the current uses of GIS as being able to be categorized into four distinct areas: 1) analysing need for health care; 2) analysing access to health care, a) measuring access, b) evaluating inequalities in access; 3) geographic variation in utilization; 4) GIS & health care delivery, a) locating health services, c) spatial decision support systems. she found that while efforts were underway to integrate GIS with spatial disease progression can be tracked by individuals' internet search engine usage more quickly than traditional methods of CDC flu outbreak reporting. some of the diseases currently been surveilled in both developed and undeveloped countries using GIS. health GIS is being used extensively in both developed developing countries. the first is a refinement of community profiling pertaining to built environment, neighbourhoods and their impact on health. health GIS is being used in combination with a sensor web, citizen sensing and social web technologies. it is also being used to manage and plan for disasters & humanitarian emergencies [83,84]. disease surveillance is an epidemiological practice that monitors the spread of disease in order to establish patterns of progression. a key component of modern disease surveillance is disease case reporting. a key component of modern disease surveillance is disease case reporting. ESRI developed a GIS tool allowing individuals in the u.s. to examine the environmental factors that may contribute to their disease. health access and planning relates directly to analyzing market segmentation and network analysis. this is an area where GIS has been extensively used in both developed countries. built environment & Neighbourhoods A neighbourhood [73] is a geographically localized community within a larger city, town or suburb. measures such as walkability [74-76], needs for school transport [77], opportunities for physical activity [79], environmental barriers [80] and alcohol use related to where alcohol is available for purchase [81] may be different in neighbourhoods that have the same built environment. the second is an extension to disease surveillance: crisis management. despite the exponential growth in the evidence for the use of GIS in health it remains a discipline slow to grow and mature. despite the exponential growth in the evidence for the use of GIS in health it remains a discipline slow to grow and mature. health GIS remains underutilized 15 years after it was first identified as having immense potential benefits. it remains underutilized 15 years after it was first identified as having immense potential benefits and having matured enough as a technology that researchers could use. healthcare informatics researchers are concerned with improving the health of our communities. this tool should not be ignored."}
