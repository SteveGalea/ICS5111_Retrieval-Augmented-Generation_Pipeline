{"summary": "the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a simple eukaryotic organism with approximately 6,000 genes. it is inexpensive to cultivate, can exist in either haploid or diploid states, and is extremely simple for genetic manipulations. more than 75% of the genes have an assigned function, while more than 40% share conserved sequences with at least one known or predicted human gene. ALS, called FUS, has been used to explore its biology in yeast. results suggest defects in RNA processing and transport may be a key element of ALS pathophysiology. in humans, the majority of FUS is found in the nucleus. yeast has the potential to be a much simpler and exciting system for modeling aspects of ALS. the results may open the way for more rapid progress in understanding the disease, its treatment, and the role of this new gene in ALS development. a growing list of viruses has been reported to undergo replication in yeast. these include RNA and DNA viruses that infect plants, insects, mammals, and humans. the study of the replication of RNA plant viruses was the first to be attempted using yeast cells. the yeast two-hybrid system, also called double-hybrid, has been extensively used to search and characterize the potential partner(s) of a given protein. the basis of this method allows searching and characterizing proteins capable of interacting with a known protein leading to obtaining the cloned genes of these interacting proteins. the two-hybrid assay checks for interactions between two proteins. a) Gal4 transcription factor gene produces two domain proteins (BD and AD) none of them is usually sufficient to initiate the transcription. retroviral enzymes are organized in domains on the Gag-Pro or Gag-Pro-Pol precursor polypeptide. these domains are not always cleaved into separate mature proteins. in most genera, all enzymes are translated together as a Gag-Pro-Pol precursor. shown are the nucleotide sequences at the frameshift site and the amino acids encoded in the Gag-Pro-Pol precursors of the indicated viruses. the upper amino acid sequence is read from either the gag or pro reading frame, and the lower sequence is read from either the pro or pol reading frame, as shown. the boxes represent the indicated reading frames. yeast Ty1 element and the reverse transcriptase of HIV-1 were shown to be active in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. the reverse transcriptase activity measured in yeast cells was shown to be sensitive to inhibitors of HIV-1 RT. the hybrid constructions that express NNRTI-resistant variants of HIV-1 are insensitive to8Cl-TIBO. recombinant enzyme purified after expression in yeast was the heterodimeric p66/p51 form. yeast possesses a protease with the same exquisite specificity as the HIV-1 protease [31] Integrase HIV-1 IN catalyzes insertion of proviral DNA into the host-cell genome. the 3D structure of the three domains of HIV-1 IN has been determined by RMN or X-ray crystallography. despite considerable efforts, the low solubility of the native HIV-1 integrase has hampered the determination of the crystallographic structure. a plasmid containing the retroviral integrase gene under the control of the inducible promoter ADH2/GAPDH was constructed. disruption of the RAD 52 gene, which is involved in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks, strongly increased the deleterious effects of the retroviral enzyme in this yeast strain. lethality in yeast seems to be related to the mutagenic effect of the recombinant HIV-1 IN. this non-sequence-specific endonuclease activity was further characterized. both the mutagenic effect and level of recombination events were affected. yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify a human gene product that binds tightly to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase in vitro. this protein has been suggested as being part of the PIC. sequence of the gene suggests that the protein is a human homolog of yeast SNF5, a transcriptional activator required for high-level expression of many genes. phenotype in yeast cells where SNF5 was inactivated, again revealing the functional analogy of many human and yeast genes. this question is the mechanism of entry of the PIC into the nucleus previous to integration in the host DNA. MTOC in the IN cellular voyage to the nucleus [28, 45]. IN expressed in yeast several times after induction. MTOC in red after immunodetection of -tubulin. the sequence of integration junctions showed that each integration event was disrupting a different open reading frame. the 5 bp repeats characterizing HIV integration were recovered for most clones, confirming that HIV-1 IN was responsible for the process. the retroviral integrase is the only viral protein necessary for the insertion of a DNA containing viral LTRs into the genome. integration assays performed under various conditions promoting or inhibiting hRAD51 activity demonstrated that the formation of an active hRAD51 nucleofilament is required for optimal inhibition. the availability of the RAD51 stimulatory agent, RAS-1, made it possible to show that this inhibition mechanism could be promoted in HIV-1-infected cells by chemical stimulation of the endogenous hRAD51 protein. retroviruses carry three enzymes, an RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase or reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase (IN) and protease (PR) the retroviral enzymes are organized in domains on the Gag-Pro or Gag-Pro-Pol precursor polypeptide. in most genera, all enzymes are translated together as a Gag-Pro-Pol precursor. shown are the nucleotide sequences at the frameshift site and the amino acids encoded in the Gag-Pro-Pol precursors of the indicated viruses. the upper amino acid sequence is read from either the gag or pro reading frame, and the lower sequence is read from either the pro or pol reading frame, as shown. the boxes represent the indicated reading frames. hybrid retrotransposons composed of the endogenous yeast Ty1 element and the reverse transcriptase of HIV-1 were shown to be active in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. the reverse transcriptase enzyme purified from the virus is a heterodimer with subunits of 66 and 51 kDa called p66 and p66. p51 subunit is a shortened version of p66 after cleavage by the HIV-1 encoded protease. only the HIV-1 gene for the p66 subunit was carried by the expression vector used. surprisingly the recombinant enzyme purified after expression was the heterodimeric p66/p51 form. the central region is the least conserved domain and is involved in nonspecific DNA binding. the 3D structure of the three domains of HIV-1 IN has been determined by RMN or X-ray crystallography. the three HIV-1 IN domains are required for in vitro 3\u2032-end processing and DNA strand transfer. the yeast model has been extremely useful to study many aspects of the integration step in retroviral replication. an expression plasmid containing the retroviral integrase gene under the control of the inducible promoter ADH2/GAPDH was constructed. disruption of the RAD 52 gene, which is involved in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks, strongly increased the deleterious effects of the retroviral enzyme in this yeast strain. lethality in yeast seems to be related to the non-sequence-specific endonuclease activity of the viral IN. this non-sequence-specific endonuclease activity was further characterized. the presence of LTR regions significantly stimulated this activity. the exact composition of the PIC is controversial since different laboratories have described various viral and cellular proteins. the yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify a human gene product that binds tightly to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase in vitro and stimulates its DNA-joining activity. the sequence of the gene suggests that the protein is a human homolog of yeast SNF5. the role of HIV-1 IN in intracellular HIV-1 trafficking has been tackled using the yeast system. a question that has not yet been fully answered about the HIV-1 cycle is the mechanism of entry of the PIC into the nucleus previous to integration in the host DNA. the authors also observed an accumulation of labeled HIV-1 IN in the nuclear periphery and the involvement of the MTOC in the IN cellular voyage to the nucleus [28, 45]. a) Expression of IN in yeast several times after induction. the sequence of the integration junctions showed that each integration event was disrupting a different open reading frame. the 5 bp repeats characterizing HIV integration were recovered for most clones, confirming that HIV-1 IN was responsible for the process. in vitro integration assays performed under various conditions promoting or inhibiting hRAD51 activity demonstrated that the formation of an active hRAD51 nucleofilament is required for optimal inhibition. the availability of the RAD51 stimulatory agent, RAS-1, made it possible to show that this inhibition mechanism could be promoted in HIV-1-infected cells by chemical stimulation of the endogenous hRAD51 protein. retroviruses have developed a mechanism leading to the synthesis of the Gag protein at higher levels relative to the pro and pol gene products. this is due to the use of the same initiation codon in the same mRNA to express the gag, pro, and pol genes. this leads occasionally to synthesis of a fusion protein called the Gag-Pro-Pol precursor. the ribosome leaves the gag reading frame and shifts into an overlapping portion of the pro-pol reading frame. the 14-Kd, 96-amino-acid HIV-1 encoded protein Vpr plays several roles in the replication cycle of this retrovirus. it is also required in the replication of HIV-1 in nondividing cells like the macrophages. sion yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe the induction of cell death observed was reminiscent of the effect of HIV-1 infection in mammalian cells. proteins have been identified as Vpr suppressors that can overcome Vpr-induced cell death in fission yeast as well as arrest Vpr-induced apoptosis in mammalian cells. the functional expression of Rev induces the cytoplasmic expression of the unspliced or incompletely spliced mRNAs that encode the viral structural proteins. a yeast protein interacting with the effector domain of Rev was found [60]. the NES domain of the Rev protein is required for Rev-mediated RNA export in mammals and in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. the ability of Rev NES mutants to interact with these FG nucleoporins parallels the ability of the mutants to promote RNA export in yeast, Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells. a putative nuclear localization signal was identified downstream of the GLFG repeat region. lower levels of exogenous Nup98 expression resulted in a relatively modest increase in unspliced RNA export. the results suggest a physiological role for hNup98 in modulating RNA export during HIV infection. the induction of Vpr expression in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe leads to several defects in the assembly and function of the mitotic spindle. in recent years proteins have been identified as Vpr suppressors that are able to overcome Vpr-induced cell death in fission yeast. mitochondria play an essential role in apoptosis in mammalian cells. Vpr in yeast promotes phosphatidylserine externalization and induces hyperpolarization of mitochondria. in fission yeast, Vpr induces unique morphologic changes in these organelles. a nuclear import inhibitory signal (NIS) that inhibits the entry of low molecular weight proteins has been described in Rev [58]. the early class of HIV-1 transcripts is fully spliced and encodes viral regulatory gene products. the early class of HIV-1 transcripts is fully spliced and encodes viral regulatory gene products. the ability of Rev NES mutants to interact with FG repeat-containing nucleoporins parallels the ability of the mutants to promote RNA export in yeast, Xenopus oocytes, and mammalian cells. a cellular factor called CRM-1 was shown to be an essential nuclear export factor interacting directly with nuclear export signals including the Rev NES. 98 expression resulted in relatively modest increase in unspliced RNA export. hNup98 signal encoded in Rev has been used as a therapeutic agent with anticandidal effects. this property was used to study the intracellular localization of the peptide. the stem loop was the upper part of the complete stimulatory element observed by NMR. a structure was recently identified on the basis of the complete yeast genome sequence. it seems interesting to explore frameshifting efficiency with the complete sequence. the frequency of frameshifting in yeast was much lower (3%) than for other coronavirus sites tested in yeast. this may indicate the existence of subtle differences in terms of frameshifting mechanisms. it would be interesting to investigate the possible binding of a transacting factor. future work should lead to the discovery of new cellular factors involved in virus proliferation. the ultimate information on the behavior of viruses or virus proteins inside the cell should be attained with plant, animal, and human cells or in vivo."}
