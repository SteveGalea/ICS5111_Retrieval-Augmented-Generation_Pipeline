{"summary": "endmic infections have been shown to have important effects on survival [1], [2] and reproduction [3], [4], [5], [6], [7] and the theoretical potential to regulate populations and drive abundance cycles [8], [9]. microbial infectious disease in nature is constrained to the analysis of a single pathogen or an ad hoc panel of pathogens for which there is a priori knowledge. stations located at 20 m intervals (1 trap/station) along a 1600 m curvilinear transect. traps were set in the afternoon (16.00 h BST) and collected the following morning (08.00 h) during the study period. females that were lactating or heavily pregnant at the time of capture were released. cells and supernatants harvested from these cultures at 24 h were used to measure mRNA and protein expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha [18], [21], mRNA expression of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9, and mRNA expression of TGF-1 and IL-10, which are anti-inflammatory cytokines involved in the regulation of immune responses. calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 u/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin and 60 M monothioglycerol. triplicate sets of individual cultures were assigned to each experimental condition. three cultures sets were stimulated with different TLR agonists. mRNA accumulations in cells harvested at 24 h were measured by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) using SYBR Green chemistry. total RNA was extracted from cells stored in RNAlater\u00ae using an Ambion RNAqueous\u00ae-Micro kit (AM1931) and converted to cDNA using an Applied Biosystems High capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (4387406) the 96-well real-time PCR assay was designed so that all target genes for one animal were run on a single plate. each target gene reaction and the endogenous control gene reaction were run in duplicate for samples and in triplicate for a reference cDNA that was included on each plate. individual mice with 10 such outlying values were classified as part of an \u201cextreme expression\u201d group. data were log-transformed prior to HCA and PCO and log-transformed prior to PCA. expression status coded extreme (1) vs non-extreme (0) expression as a binary variable. subsequent clusters were identified by adjusting for the presence of more significant clusters. based on data for common macroparasite species at Cotgrave Forest. LMs with normal errors or equivalent generalized linear models (GLMs) with Poisson errors or negative binomial errors were used as appropriate (again with deletion of non-significant terms) a Poisson distribution was used as a surrogate distribution in the case of ordinal data for P. serrata. in the present study lice were recorded in different infection categories. in the present study, thin blood smears were prepared from cardiac blood. eyes from each specimen were stored in 4% formalin and then lenses were removed and dried in an oven at 80\u00b0C for 72 h. necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) [18], [21], mRNA expression of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9, and mRNA expression of TGF-1 and IL-10, which are anti-inflammatory cytokines involved in the regulation of immune responses [22], [23], [24]. cell culture Spleens were disaggregated through a 70 m cell strainer into RPMI 1640. TLR4 agonists at 3 g/ml, or oligonucleotide ODN2006 (TLR9 agonist) at 6 g/ml. all reagents used were tested for functional induction of target TLR. further culture sets were stimulated with HbAg antigen at 50 g/ml. supernatants and cells were harvested after 24 h for unstimulated and TLR cultures. real-time PCR primers were then designed from the resulting Apodemus sylvaticus TLR sequence. each target and endogenous control gene 2\u20136 primer pairs were designed and trialled. target genes were normalized against the endogenous control gene -actin. each target gene reaction and the endogenous control gene reaction were run in duplicate for samples and in triplicate for a reference cDNA that was included on each plate. a no-template-control was included in duplicate for each primer pair. individual mice with 10 such outlying values were classified as part of an \u201cextreme expression\u201d group. data were log-transformed and standardized prior to HCA and PCO and log-transformed prior to PCA. the PCA of macroparasite variables produced a significant (P0.001) first component with coefficients of the same sign for most species. an estimator of body condition was produced by taking residuals (BWresid) from a regression of body weight (SVL) on SVL. individuals with >10 outlier readings from the 30 variables measured were considered an \u201cextreme expression\u201d group. the individual composition of this group was broadly supported by HCA, PCA and PCO for the subset of 22 expression variables without missing data values. actions show proportion of individuals with expression profiles classified as extreme at each sampling point. labelled data points relate to individuals classified as showing extreme immunological expression on the basis of 10 outlying expression measurements. individuals labelled 3 are unassigned to a temporal cluster. a significant temporal cluster (cluster 1) was detected in late June 2008. a significant secondary temporal cluster (cluster 2) occurred in early September 2008. the areas included and not included in these clusters appeared to broadly correspond to distinct forestry blocks. closed circles indicate over-wintered (1+) animals; open circles indicate young-of-the-year (0+) open circles indicate most recent young-of-the-year (0+) recruits with eye lenses 0.014 g. in 2008 1+ animals predominantly died off in June, coincident with a large pulse of recruitment. cluster 2 individuals had significantly greater body condition (BWresid) and grouped macroparasite infection (PC1p) than non-cluster individuals. cluster 2 animals had significantly better body condition (BWresid) than non-cluster animals, adjusting for size and stage. variable coefficients on PC1P were: Skrjabinotaenia lobata 0.25, Brachylaemus recurvum 0.28, Calodium hepaticum 0.24, Syphacia nigeriana 0.50, Heligmosomoides polygyrus 0.50, laelapid mites 0.102, Polyplax serrata 0.52. individuals with >10 outlier readings from the 30 variables measured were considered an \u201cextreme expression\u201d group. many animals with anomalous expression profiles were noted in June and September 2008. similar temporal patterns emerged for cultures subject to stimulatory conditions. Figure 2. Association between extreme immunological gene expression and live-trapping catch rate in an Apodemus sylvaticus population in the UK across May\u2013December 2008. aetiological agents are endemic at Cotgrave Forest. they occur in hosts with non-extreme levels of immunological expression. a significant temporal cluster (cluster 1) was detected in late June 2008. plots of lens weight with respect to time allowed unambiguous identification of over-wintered (1+) and young-of-the-year (0+) cohorts in 2008 compared to 2007 by an abrupt earlier disappearance of 1+ animals in late June. closed circles indicate over-wintered (1+) animals; open circles indicate the most recent young-of-the-year (0+) recruits with eye lenses 0.014 g. individuals in cluster 2 were characterized by relatively high levels of constitutive and LPS-stimulated expression of TLR4, TLR9 and FoxP3. cluster 1 individuals (June) were characterized by higher expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokineTNF-. cluster 2 animals (dark bar) had significantly better body condition (BWresid) than non-cluster animals, adjusting for size and stage. PC1P represents first principal component scores from a principal components analysis of common macroparasite species at Cotgrave Forest. this is consistent with the presence of an acute, highly immunogenic microbial infection in the mouse population at these times. other possible causes for the \u201cextreme expression\u201d clusters are considered less likely. autoimmunity, allergy or malignancy not involving infection does not well explain the clustered temporal epidemiological pattern. the identity of any putative aetiological pathogen(s) is unknown. the two \u201cepidemic\u201d clusters differed in the nature of the immune responses observed. cluster 1 individuals were exclusively over-wintered (1+) animals. cluster 2 animals were exclusively young-of-the-year (0+) individuals. cowpox virus suppresses TNF- responses, which were expressed at very high levels in cluster 1 mice. a further interesting characteristic of the second cluster is that cluster members showed significantly better body condition and greater macroparasite infection than non-cluster individuals. microbial pathogens are detected in animals with anomalous immunological transcriptional profiles compared to \u201cnormal\u201d animals. this study might point towards a possible, destabilizing, role for microbial infectious disease in addition to factors identified by other authors."}
