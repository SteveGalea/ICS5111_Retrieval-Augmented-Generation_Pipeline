{"summary": "a majority of newly synthesized proteins in mammalian cells are either misfolded or misassembled. the process detects misfolded proteins in the ER lumen and then extracts them through membrane channels in an energy-dependent manner for delivery to cytosolic proteasomes. inability of the ERAD system to destroy misfolded proteins is associated with more than 60 diseases. viruses can produce large quantities of glycoproteins in a short period of time, which may overwhelm ERAD. protein translocation across the ER membrane is the prerequisite for ERAD. in yeast, more than 40% of signal-containing proteins fail to use SRP. instead, these proteins are targeted by the GET pathway to the Sec61 translocon. one large class of SRP-independent proteins includes the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins. specific carbohydrates are bound by different chaperones/lectins in the ER lumen. these proteins include ERManI, EDEM, OS-9, XTP3-B, calreticulin, and calnexin. recognition of ERAD substrates probably results in assembly of the retrotranslocon. multiple E3s may be responsible for the polyubiquitin chains that then bind to the p97 partner proteins, Ufd1 and Npl4. the substrate is shown moving through the translocon into the center of the p97 hexamer. it is possible that p97 substitutes for the 19S lid. oligosaccharides on ER luminal proteins are critical for correct folding or selection for ERAD. the nascent protein has a three-branch structure with glucose3-mannose9-N-acetylglucosamine2-asparagine. re-addition of this glucose by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase. proteins retry folding until removal of three or four mannose residues triggers ERAD. correctly folded proteins leave the ER after one or two mannose residues have been cleaved. several lectins, OS-9 and XTP3-B, then interact via their MRH domains. ated proteins can be subjected to ERAD, but detection of misfolding does not involve calnexin and calreticulin. targeting of unglycosylated proteins to proteasomes involves EDEM1 (Shenkman et al., 2013) both glycosylated and non-glycosylated derivatives are recruited to the ERQC near the nucleus in presence of a proteasomal inhibitor. PDI family proteins are generally confined by a KDEL retention sequence to the ER. the oxidoreductase ERp57, localized near the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, may provide some protection for proteins that might be routed for ERAD by calnexin. certain ERAD substrates appear to be dependent on proline isomerization. such refolding events may be necessary for transit through the retranslocon by elimination of turns in substrate secondary structure. Derlin-3 has a cell-type specific distribution (Oda et al., 2006), suggesting recognition of certain substrates may be involved in its function. rhomboid proteases, such as RHBDL4, are upregulated by ER stress and binds to the cytosolic AAA ATPase p97. Suppressor/enhancer of Lin12-like (SEL1L) appears to link luminal factors that recognize misfolding and inappropriate glycosylation. transmembrane SEL1L protein (Hrd3p in yeast) also participates in regulation of ERAD by sequestering EDEM1 and OS-9 into ER-derived vesicles known as EDEMosomes. ane E3 can promote ERAD of a luminal substrate (ERAD-L) the process also involves Hrd3p (SEL1L in metazoans) as well as Usa1p and Der1p (Carvalho et al., 2010). other components appear to be dispensable if Hrd1p is overexpressed. multiple E3 ligases participate in ERAD. these ligases include the transmembrane proteins gp78/AMFR (Fairbank et al., 2009), TRC8 (Stagg et al., 2009), RMA1/RNF5 (El Khouri et al., 2009), MARCH6/TEB4 (Doa10 in yeast; Kreft and Hochstrasser, 2011; Olzmann et al., the p97 cofactors act as a substrate adapter to the p97 ATPase associated with the retrotranslocon. the p97 cofactors act as a ubiquitin-X (UBX) or UBX-like domain. adapter-p97 complexes may recognize different substrates and perform independent functions. other models suggest that Derlins are involved in unfolding of substrates. p97 ATPase binds ubiquitin chain editors that can extend shorter chains as well as deubiquitinating enzymes. p97 binds to a deubiquitinating enzyme YOD1 so that polyubiquitin chains will not interfere with insertion into the proteasome. the proteasome core is composed of 28 subunits arranged into four rings. p97 may deliver certain substrates directly to the proteasome core. both proteins are transmembrane glycoproteins and bind to newly made MHC-I to initiate retrotranslocation. despite their similar function, US2 and US11 use different pathways for MHC-I degradation. it is not clear whether either degradation of MHC-I by US2 or US11 involves the adapter complex Ufd1-Npl4. p97 ATPase does not appear to interact directly with MHC-I. mouse gammaherpesvirus 68 encodes an E3 ligase (mK3) that ubiquitinates newly made MHC-I heavy chains for proteasomal degradation. the mK3 ligase also is associated with the transporter-associated with antigen processing (TAP) as well as p97 and Derlin-1. CD4+ T cells secrete cytokines that control antibody production, phagocytic cell function, and cytotoxic T-cell responses. expression of Vpu and CD4 by transient transfection showed dramatic decreases in CD4 levels. expression of Vpu and CD4 by transient transfection showed dramatic decreases in CD4 levels. transmembrane protein Vpu recruits the E3 ligase complex SCF-TrCP. Knockdown of both -TrCP1 and -TrCP1 can prevent CD4 degradation. another E3 ligase (E3\") also may be involved. HIV-1 Vpu also targets another cellular protein, tetherin/BST-2. tetherin is an unusual type II membrane protein with an N-terminal transmembrane segment. tetherin monomers are bound together by disulfide bonds. gp78 is an ERAD-associated E3 ligase localized to mitochondria\u2013ER membrane contacts. mitochondria proteins may influence ERAD and modulate HIV-1 Env presentation to the immune system. some anti-viral signaling is controlled through mitochondria. gp78 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase localized to the ER-mitochondrial interface. it was detected by a high throughput RNAi screen to identify genes that restricted enterovirus replication. downregulation of gp78 was shown to decrease yields of vesicular stomatitis virus. cholera toxin has a catalytic A chain divided into two subunits (CTA1 and CTA2) inside a pore composed of five receptor-binding B subunits. PDI is a redox-dependent chaperone that unfolds the toxin, which is then released in the oxidized state. this unfolding event appears to be required for the ability of CTA1 to retrotranslocate to the cytosol. the chaperone BiP and an ER-resident ATPase (Torsin A) promote CTA1 retrotranslocation. ERdj5 also binds to Sel1L, likely providing interaction with the Hrd1 E3 ligase. mouse mammary tumor virus is a betaretrovirus that subverts the ERAD process to complete its viral replication cycle. all retroviruses synthesize an unspliced viral RNA that requires export from the nucleus to the cytosol for translation or packaging into virus particles. the complex retroviruses encode an adapter protein, such as the Rev protein of HIV-1. Rem is a precursor protein that is directed to the ER membrane for translation. it appears to be cleaved by signal peptidase into the Rev-like Rem-SP and a C-terminal glycosylated product (Rem-CT) of unknown activity. cholera toxin avoids proteasomal degradation. Rem-SP function was reduced by the expression of a dominant-negative Derlin-1, but not Derlin-2 protein (Byun et al., 2010). these results strongly suggest that Rem must be cleaved by signal peptidase prior to SP retrotranslocation to the cytosol and import into the nucleus for RNA binding. Rem-GFP tagged at the N-terminus with GFP was cleaved normally. GFP-Rem-SP localized to the nucleoli, a result typical of other Rev-like proteins. deletion mutations of the Rem C-terminus greatly affected stability of the protein. the polyomavirus (BKV) first binds to the ganglioside receptors GT1b and GD1b and enters through caveolae. other members of the polyomaviridae use caveolae-independent entry for ER delivery. studies of JCV, BKV, and SV40 indicate viral particles interact with PDI and ERp57 in the ER lumen to rearrange capsid proteins. the altered particles then engage different retrotranslocons (dependent on either Derlin-1 or Derlin-2) to induce retrotranslocation to the cytosol. these particles then bind to the nuclear pore where uncoating occurs to allow passage of viral DNA into the nucleus. SV40 uses Derlin-1 and SEL1L, whereas mouse polyoma virus uses Derlin-2. additional experiments indicate that exposure of VP2 hydrophobic sequences tethers virus particles to the ER membrane. polyomaviruses use ERAD to signal peptidase and cleavage of Rem precursor into functional N- and C-terminal proteins. both types of viruses avoid proteasomal degradation during ERAD. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) induce DMVs for targeting replication and transcription. the DMVs originate from ER membranes and contain the non-structural transmembrane proteins nsp3 and nsp4 and viral double-stranded RNA. autophagy machinery is not required for coronavirus replication. no colocalization of viral non-structural proteins was observed with LC3-II-coated autophagosomes. coronavirus-induced DMVs and EDEMosomes are coated with LC3-I protein. viruses hijack EDEMosomes to sequester double-stranded RNA from cytosolic sensors. other components of the ERAD system, particularly chaperone proteins, also participate in the replication and transmission of both plant and mammalian viruses. the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
