{"summary": "the etiologic agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV) was first discovered in the Netherlands in 1991. in the united states, PRRSV was first isolated and characterized in 1992. this initial suppression of the host innate immune response leads to the delayed induction of protective cellular and humoral immunity (7, 8), which provides a window of time. replicase-associated ORF1a and ORF1b genes are situated at the 5\u2032 end and represent nearly 75% of the viral genome. pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins are processed into at least 14 nonstructural proteins by a proteolytic cascade. nsp2TF and nsp2N are expressed by a novel 2/1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. PRRSV nsp1 has strong inhibitory effects on type I interferon (IFN) production and signaling pathways that lead to the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) a highly conserved GKYLQRRLQ motif was identified to be critical for 2/1 PRF transactivation and the innate immune suppression function of the virus. porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) were obtained from lung lavage samples of 6-week-old PRRSV-naive piglets. type 2 PRRSV isolate SD95-21 (GenBank accession no. KC469618) and its nsp1 mutants were used. specific mutations (K124A, R128A, R129A, or RR129AA) were introduced into the nsp1 region of pL-NA-nsp1-2 by using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. specific mutations (K124A, R128A, R129A, or RR129AA) were introduced into the nsp1 region of pL-NA-nsp1-2 by using a QuikCh mutated full-length cDNA clones were designated pCMV-SD95-21-R128A, pCMV-SD95-21-R129A, and pCMV-SD95-21-RR129AA. in vitro luciferase reporter assays, two reporter plasmids, p125-Luc and pISRE-Luc, were used as described previously. hek-293T cells (1 106 cells/well) were seeded into 6-well plates 1 day before infection. cells in each well were infected with a vaccinia virus expressing T7 polymerase at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) and/or IRDye 680RD goat anti-rabbit IgG(H+L) secondary antibody was added, and the membrane was incubated for an additional 1 h at room temperature. target proteins were visualized and quantified by using a digital image system. culture supernatants from recombinant virus-infected cells were used for viral RNA extraction using the QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen) the nsp1 coding region containing the corresponding mutations was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and PCR products were subject to DNA sequencing at Genewiz Inc. three pigs from each group were sequentially euthanized at 7, 21, and 35 dpi. three pigs from each group were sequentially euthanized at 7, 21, and 35 dpi. dpi, 3 pigs from each group were terminated and their plasma, PBMCs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and lung tissue samples were collected. e Pig 12 died before 7 dpi. real-time RT-PCR quantification of viral load in infected animals. porcine alveolar macrophages were infected with the WT virus or nsp1 mutants at an MOI of 1. At 12 h postinfection, the cell culture supernatant was harvested for analysis of IFN- expression using a ProcartaPlex Porcine IFN alpha Simplex kit. an immunofluorescence-based assay was performed by using a modified method described previously (34\u201336) the assay was conducted by using a 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD)/carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) PBMCs were first surface labeled with pig lymphocyte-specific fluorochrome-conjugated MAbs (CD3-peridinin chlorophyll protein [PerCP], CD4-allophycocyanin [APC], and CD8-fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC] for intracellular IFN- staining. the surface-immunostained cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized hek-293T cells and MARC-145 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic (streptomycin [100 g/ml]) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) were obtained from lung lavage samples. sp2TF (PAb-TF) (25) was used to immunoprecipitate and detect nsp2TF. an anti-tubulin MAb (abm Inc., BC, Canada) was used to detect the expression of the housekeeping gene -tubulin. mutated full-length cDNA clones were designated pCMV-SD95-21-R128A, pCMV-SD95-21-R129A, and pCMV-SD95-21-RR129AA. the region between SphI and ScaI of pCMV-SD95-21 was replaced by the regions of the shuttle plasmids containing the specific mutations. cells were mock treated, stimulated with SeV inoculated at 100 hemagglutination units/ml/well for 16 h, or treated with IFN- at 2,000 IU/ml/well for 16 h. nsp1-nsp2 and its mutants were expressed by using a vaccinia virus-T7 polymerase system (28). t analysis was performed to evaluate protein expression according to methods described previously (20, 26) cell lysates were prepared by harvesting virus-infected or plasmid DNA-transfected cells with radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. the cell lysate was mixed with an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer and heated at 95\u00b0C for 6 min. transfection was performed by using FuGENE HD reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) at 48 h posttransfection, the cell culture supernatant was harvested and passaged on MARC-145 cells. recombinant viruses were serially passaged on MARC-145 cells. a total of 45 specific-pathogen-free (SPF) pigs were obtained from the swine farm of The Ohio State University. pigs were randomly divided into 5 groups (n = 9) to determine plaque morphology of the virus. at 7, 21, and 35 dpi, 3 pigs from each group were terminated. plasma, PBMCs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and lung tissue samples were collected. real-time quantitative RT-PCR quantification of viral load in infected animals. the viral genomic region was amplified by RT-PCR using primers T7-GP5F and GP5R. the PCR product was purified and subjected to in vitro transcription. nsp1 mutants were infected with the WT virus or nsp1 mutants. at 12 h postinfection, the cell culture supernatant was harvested. NK cell cytotoxicity measured by flow cytometry by acquiring 10,000 CFSE-labeled events and further gated for the frequency of CFSE and 7-AAD (green and red) double-stained cells, which indicates the frequency of lysed target cells. cells were washed and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-pig IFN- or the isotype control MAb (BD Biosciences, East Rutherford, NJ) in 0.1% saponin-containing fluorescence-activated cell sorter buffer. 25,000 immunostained cells were acquired using a FACSAria II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, East Rutherford, NJ) sp1 genes carries a single alanine substitution at amino acid K124 (K124A), R128 (R128A) and R129 (RR129AA) a previously created mutant, nsp1KO (1KO) (R124/R128-to-A124/A128 double substitution) (26), was also included in the analysis. in contrast, 33-fold-, 19-fold-, 24-fold-, and 26-fold-higher levels of reporter expression were detected in cells expressing the R128A, R129A, RR129AA, and 1KO mutants. we further determined whether these mutations had an effect on the ability of nsp1 to suppress the IFN-dependent signaling pathway for interferon-stimulated gene expression. isRE-Luc expressing firefly luciferase derived from the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) (B) at 24 h posttransfection, cells were stimulated with SeV at 100 HA units/ml or stimulated with IFN- at 2,000 IU/ml for 16 h. the results confirmed the expression of nsp1 in mutant-transfected cells. a double mutation of K124/R128 to A124/A128 caused increased levels of nsp1 expression in comparison to those of WT nsp1 and other mutants. in this study, individual substitutions introduced at K124, R128, and R129 showed that only the R128A substitution affects the ability of nsp1 to suppress self-expression. the nsp2TF product was detected only in cells expressing WT nsp1-2 or the K124A mutant. the expression of full-length nsp2 and nsp1 was detected in the WT and all nsp1-2 mutants. residues R128 and R129 are critical for the transactivator function of nsp1 in activating the 2 PRF signal. vSD95-21-R128A (vR128A), vSD95-21-R129A (vR129A) and vSD95-21-R128A/R129A (vRR129AA), carrying single or double mutations at residues R128 and R129 of the GKYLQRRLQ motif. the stability of these mutations was determined by serially passaging each virus 5 times in MARC-145 cells. mutants had significantly reduced growth abilities, with 1- to 1.5-log decreases in virus titers throughout the time course of the study. v1KO and vRR129AA developed smaller plaques than did the WT virus. all of the nsp1 mutants showed an improved ability to induce the production of IFN-. vRR129AA showed the strongest stimulation of IFN- production. expression of nsp1 was detected by Western blotting. in vR128A- and vR129A-infected cells are not statistically significant. mRNA expression levels of IFIT1 and IFITM1 were increased in mutant virus-infected cells in comparison to those in WT virus-infected cells. the membrane was incubated with a mixture of primary MAb 123-128 and MAb against -tubulin. the secondary antibody IRDye 800CW goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) was used to visualize the target proteins with a digital image system. in vivo characterization of nsp1 mutants. pigs infected with vR129A mutant showed lower viral RNA loads from 1 dpi to 14 dpi. at most of the time points during the later stage of infection, the mean viral RNA load in pigs infected with the vRR129AA mutant was the lowest among all the infected pigs. the infectious virus titer was measured by a microtitration assay using MARC-145 cells. at 1, 2, and 5 dpi, infectious virus titers in groups of pigs infected with nsp1 mutants were 1 to 3 logs lower (statistically significant) than the virus titers in pigs infected with the virus. 32 Stable 122, UCU to CCU, Ser to Pro 33 Stable 122, UCU to CCU, Ser to Pro 35 Stable 122, UCU to CCU, Ser to Pro 36 Stable 122, UCU to CCU, Ser to Pro 21 dpi WT 14 9, GAC to GGC, Asp to Gly 15 9, GAC to GGC, Asp to Gly 16 9, GAC to GGC, Asp to Gly 122, UCU to C the viral load was quantified by qRT-PCR and microtitration assays. pigs infected with nsp1 mutants were consistently lower than those in pigs infected with the virus at 7 and 21 dpi. mean viral loads in lung samples and BALF from vR129A mutant-infected pigs were similar to those in nsp1 mutants at 35 dpi. these results suggest that nsp1 mutants have an attenuated replication ability in the lungs of infected pigs. vR129A showed a reversion to the WT phenotype at certain levels during the later stage of infection. serum samples from 3 pigs per group terminated at 21 dpi were used to determine the stability of the introduced mutations. no second-site mutation and also no reversion were found in the nsp1 coding region of the virus isolated from serum samples of pigs infected by the vRR129AA mutant virus. second-site mutation of Ser122 to Pro occurred in all of the pigs that maintained the designed mutations (R128A and R129A) at 14, 21, and 35 dpi. this suggests that this substitution may compromise the effect of the designed mutations on virus growth ability in vivo. we measured IFN- levels in both BALF (representing airways) and lung lysates. at 7 dpi, higher levels of IFN- were observed in the lung lysates of pigs inoculated with nsp1 mutant viruses. pigs were uninfected (mock) or infected with the virus. vRR129AA mutant-infected pigs had increased NK cell cytotoxic function at 7 dpi. production of IFN- in the serum of nsp1 mutant-infected pigs was undetectable. in vR128A mutant-infected pigs, increased IFN- levels were detected in serum at 5 and 14 dpi. similar increase in IFN- secretion was detected in the BALF of vR128A-, vR129A-, and vRR129AA-infected pigs, observed only at 7 dpi. however, increased levels of IFN- production in the lung lysates of vR129A- IL-6 levels in vRR129AA and lung lysates were analyzed by an ELISA. each data point represents the mean value SEM of data from 3 pigs. production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 suggests an inflammatory reaction in the lungs of pigs. the specific population of cells was identified based on a combination of phenotypic cell surface markers. cells were fixed and stained for intracellular IFN- and gated for their respective activated (IFN-+) phenotype. compared to those in vR129A- and vRR129AA-infected pigs, frequencies of total CTLs/ T cells increased at 21 dpi and then reduced significantly at 35 dpi. NK cells and the two important T cell subsets were activated particularly in PRRSV vRR129AA mutant-infected pigs. these data suggest that NK cells and the two important T cell subsets were activated particularly in mutant-infected pigs. this suggests virus-specific activation of innate and adaptive immunity. protein structural analysis showed that three basic residues are exposed on the surface of nsp1 (25) each of the nsp1 genes carries a single alanine substitution at amino acid K124 (K124A), R128 (R128A), and R129 (R129A) a previously created mutant, nsp1KO (1KO) (26), was also included in the analysis. cells were harvested to test the luciferase activities at 16 h postinfection. luciferase expression level was 46- to 16-fold lower in cells expressing WT nsp1 and the K124A mutant. in contrast, 33-fold-, 19-fold-, 24-fold-, and 26-fold-higher levels of reporter expression were detected. HEK-293T cells in a 24-well plate were cotransfected with a plasmid expressing WT nsp1 or the nsp1 mutant. an empty vector (EV) was used as a control. expression level of nsp1 was evaluated by Western blot analysis using nsp1-specific MAb 123-128. the expression level of nsp1 was evaluated by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's test. the results confirmed the expression of nsp1 in mutant-transfected cells used in luciferase assays. a double mutation of K124/R128 to A124/A128 caused increased levels of nsp1 expression. nsp1-2 or its mutants (K124A, R128A, R129A, 1KO, and RR129AA) were subjected to immunoprecipitation using a polyclonal antibody (PAb-TF) the nsp2TF product was detected only in cells expressing WT nsp1-2 or the K124A mutant but not in cells expressing the mutants. the expression of full-length nsp2 and nsp1 was western blot detection of expression of nsp2 (top) and nsp1 (bottom) using specific MAbs. in vitro characterization of recombinant viruses containing mutations in the nsp1 GKYLQRRLQ motif. age 3) were compared with those of the parental virus. vK124A showed a similar growth ability, while vR128A and vR129A showed certain levels of reduced growth ability. vRR129AA and v1KO mutants had significantly reduced growth abilities. IFN- expression was evaluated in nsp1 mutants or WT virus-infected porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) at 12 h postinfection, the mRNA expression levels of three selected ISGs were assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) all of the nsp1 mutants stimulated higher mRNA expression levels of ISGs. mRNA expression levels of IFIT1 and IFITM1 were increased in mutant virus-infected cells. mRNA expression levels of IFIT1 and IFITM1 were increased in mutant virus-infected cells. mRNA expression level of IFITM1 was evaluated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and normalized to the level of endogenous -tubulin mRNA. values in panels B to D are expressed as means SEM from three independent experiments. pigs infected with the vR128A and vRR129AA mutant showed lower viral RNA loads. at most of the time points during the later stage of infection, the mean viral RNA load in pigs infected with the vRR129AA mutant was the lowest among all pigs. virus titer was measured by a microtitration assay using MARC-145 cells. at 1, 2, and 5 dpi, infectious virus titers in groups of pigs infected with nsp1 mutants were 1 to 3 logs lower (statistically significant) than the virus titers in pigs infected with the WT virus. the growth ability of vR129A was attenuated at an early stage of infection but reverted to the WT phenotype at a certain level during the later stage of infection. vivo and that the growth ability of vR129A was attenuated at an early stage of infection but reverted to the WT phenotype at a certain level. viral load was quantified by qRT-PCR and microtitration assays. qRT-PCR and microtitration assays showed viral loads in lung lysates. lung lysates and BALF from all groups of pigs infected with nsp1 mutants consistently lower than those in pigs infected with the virus at 7 and 21 dpi. the mean viral loads in lung samples and BALF from vR129A mutant-infected pigs were similar to those in pigs infected with the virus at 35 dpi. sate samples were determined by a microtitration assay and calculated as log TCID50 per milliliter or log TCID50 per gram. statistical significance between the wild-type virus-infected group and mutant virus-infected groups was determined by one-way ANOVA. a reversion occurred in one of the vR129A mutant-infected pigs at 21 dpi. the pig with an Ala129-to-Arg reversion at 21 dpi had already obtained the reversion at 14 dpi. however, the designed R129A mutation was maintained in the other five pigs. pigs inoculated with vRR129AA and vR129A mutants showed an increased level of IFN- production compared to those of WT virus-infected pigs. at 7 dpi, higher levels of IFN- were observed in the lung lysates of pigs inoculated with nsp1 mutant viruses. pigs were uninfected (mock) or infected. PBMCs were harvested on the day of necropsy (7 dpi) cells were cocultured with target cells (K562) at an E:T ratio of 100:1 (B) or 50:1 (C) each data point represents the mean value SEM of data from 3 pigs. production of IFN- in the serum of nsp1 mutant-infected pigs was undetectable. spurts of IFN- secretion (100 to 150 pg/ml) were detected on multiple days postinfection. increased IFN- levels were detected in vR129A mutant-infected pigs at 7 to 21 dpi. pigs were uninfected (mock) or infected with WT PRRSV (WT) or the three indicated mutants (vR128A, vR129A, and vRR129AA) blood samples were collected on the indicated days postinfection. the porcine immune system has a unique frequency of CD3+ CD4 CD8+ T cells. the cells were fixed and stained for intracellular IFN- and gated for their respective activated (IFN-+) phenotype. the frequency of NK cells was significantly increased only in vRR129AA-infected pigs at 7 dpi. these data suggest that NK cells and the two important T cell subsets were activated particularly in PRRSV vRR129AA mutant-infected pigs. a potent innate immune response induced by microbial infection/vaccination will lead to the generation of sufficient adaptive immunity. but PRRSV infection generally induces poor antiviral innate IFN and cytokine responses, which result in weak adaptive immunity (46\u201350) nsp1 mutants carrying alanine substitutions at R128 and R129 showed a significantly reduced antagonism effect on reporter gene expression under the control of the IFN- promoter (p125-Luc); however, the K124A mutant still had an inhibitory effect on reporter gene expression similar to that of WT nsp1. nsp1 was recently identified as a transactivator for expression of the 2/1 PRF products nsp2TF and nsp2N. both nsp2TF and nsp2N share the N-terminal two-thirds sequence of nsp2. nsp2 was also identified as an innate immune antagonist. multiple-step virus growth curves showed that vR128A and vR129A had slightly slower growth kinetics. v1KO and vRR129AA showed 1- to 1.5-log-lower virus titers than that of the parental virus at all tested time points. it is worth noting that v1KO had a lower virus titer than that of the mutant virus with the single R128A mutation. recombinant virus containing the K124A mutation did not have much of an effect on virus replication. this mutant was excluded in the present animal study. 1KO showed an overattenuated phenotype with virus growing to an extremely low titer. pigs in vR129A- and vRR129AA-infected pigs had lower mean viral RNA loads. pigs also had lower levels of viremia than that of the virus group at early time points. results suggest that vR129A could be reversed back to the virus. ser122 was stably maintained in vR128A, vR129A, and vRR129AA. the results suggest that the ser122-to-Pro122 substitution may compromise the side effect of our designed mutations on virus replication ability in animals. type I IFNs are the principal cytokines for innate immunity against viral infections. nsp1 mutants induced higher levels of IFN- than did the WT virus. nsp1 mutants induced earlier and higher-level IFN- expression than did the WT virus. a strong Th1 response suppresses the Th2 response (humoral response) and vice versa. the lack of an improved virus-neutralizing antibody response in nsp1 mutant-infected pigs could be partially caused by the strong Th1 response. vRR129AA can grow to sufficient virus titers in cell culture (>5 log TCID50/ml), which facilitate large-scale vaccine production. mutants containing a single alanine substitution (vR128A and vR129A) need to be further assessed in animal challenge studies. residues R128 and R129 are highly conserved in all available PRRSV strains."}
