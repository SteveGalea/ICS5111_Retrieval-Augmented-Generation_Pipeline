{"summary": "occupational diseases of epidemic proportions have been musculoskeletal, psychiatric or toxicologic in nature. despite this uncertainty, government agencies and businesses are taking measures to address the impact of a potential pandemic influenza on their workforce. the greatest impact of SARS was subsequently felt in health care workers. they were estimated to have accounted for over 20% of total SARS cases in Singapore and 40% in canada. however, individuals working closely with infected animal hosts are at risk for first line crossover transmission of emerging virus. a new viral form of the virus would still contain avian viral surface proteins. when this occurs humans have minimal or no immunity against the virus, enabling a large geographic spread of disease with high attack rates. a new strain of avian influenza is considered to have pandemic potential. avian influenza has currently not developed into a pandemic. there are no industries that would be left unaffected by an avian influenza pandemic. there are no industries that would be left unaffected by a pandemic. in the event of a pandemic influenza absenteeism will be an enormous challenge. the public health agency of Canada is predicting total work absenteeism of 35 to 50%. a large manufacturing plant in the united states may require final product detailing in another region of the country. there is limited clinical evidence for the effectiveness of currently available medications or vaccines. the need for a rapidly deliverable vaccine for pandemic influenza has become more urgent since de Jong et al. [15] reported the emergence of oseltamivir resistance to H5N1. the first vaccine approved by the fda for pandemic influenza is a reverse genetics vaccine and demonstrated low immunogenicity except for high doses with an adjuvant. a unique challenge for the occupational medicine physician in the event of a pandemic is to determine who gets priority for receiving vaccination. neuraminidase inhibitors and adamantanes are the two main classes of antivirals available at present. there has been an emergence of resistance to adamantanes for seasonal influenza [21] leading many to reconsider them as agents in the treatment of pandemic avian influenza [22] a company of 1000 employees would need to invest $200,000 on a product they hope they will never use, is unproven, and has a limited shelf life. non-pharmaceutical controls will need to be considered to combat the spread of illness in the community and the workplace. the gold standard for particulate inhalation in most cases is the use of the N95 respirator. the gold standard for particulate inhalation in most cases is the use of the respirator. the respirators require fit testing, need to be replaced and tend to be uncomfortable. include the cost associated with fit-testing which takes approximately 20-minutes per person. include the cost associated with fit-testing which would therefore require 333 hours of time to fit 1000 employees. a trained professional is required to perform the fit-test procedure. the greatest impact of SARS was subsequently felt in health care workers. they were estimated to have accounted for over 20% of total SARS cases in Singapore and 40% in canada. however, individuals working closely with infected animal hosts are at risk for first line crossover transmission of an emerging virus. avian influenza is not the only avian influenza that has the capacity to affect humans. it occurs when a new strain of human influenza arises that humans have minimal or absent pre-existing natural immunity. the current strain of avian influenza considered to have pandemic potential is the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian influenza. avian influenza has currently not developed into a pandemic. there are no industries that would be left unaffected by an avian influenza pandemic. this is because patients will place an enormous burden on already fully taxed health care services. the health of a workplace is vital to the health and functioning of our interdependent society. in the event of a pandemic influenza absenteeism will be an enormous challenge. the public health agency of Canada is predicting total work absenteeism of 35 to 50%. avian influenza will have the capacity to disrupt services and supply chains. the interventions available to health professionals can be considered as engineering or administrative controls. there is limited clinical evidence for the effectiveness of currently available medications or vaccines. the first vaccine approved by the fda for pandemic influenza is a reverse genetics vaccine. it showed low immunogenicity except for high doses with an adjuvant. maintenance of essential services will be central to the continuity of a functioning society. neuraminidase inhibitors and adamantanes are the two main classes of antivirals available at present. there has been an emergence of resistance to adamantanes for seasonal influenza [21]. the cost-benefit of stockpiling anti-virals for treatment of pandemic avian influenza remains unknown. a company of 1000 employees would need to invest $200,000 on a product they hope they will never use, is unproven, and has a limited shelf life. non-pharmaceutical controls will need to be considered to combat the spread of illness in the community and the workplace. the need for a rapidly deliverable vaccine for pandemic influenza has become more urgent since de Jong et al. [15] reported the emergence of oseltamivir resistance to H5N1. increasing demand for vaccine during a pandemic may be tempered by the supply. health care workers and workers in critical occupations will be a priority for vaccination programs, once available. maintenance of essential services will be central to the continuity of a functioning society. oseltamivir has demonstrated resistance [15] in individuals with confirmed H5N1 influenza that were treated with oseltamivir. mortality was close to 80% in individuals with confirmed H5N1 influenza that were treated with oseltamivir. despite guidelines from the world health organization, there remains little 'level 1' clinical evidence. some of the above interventions have unique implications from an occupational medicine perspective. hygiene and respiratory etiquette are particularly effective in reducing the spread of infectious disease. this also applies to a workplace where people are in close proximity to one another. the N95 respirators would impose a large cost to an organization who decides they will outfit their employees with them in the event of a pandemic. each employee would require 30 masks over 2-weeks (10 working days), leading to a cost of $30 per employee for a total of $30K for 1000 employees. addressing both real and perceived risk of infection may be the most crucial factor in maintaining business continuity. the scientific community is devoting a great deal of effort and research funding towards what is considered an inevitable pandemic. the prevention and management of disease transmission in the occupational environment will play a central role in the health and economic burden of pandemic influenza. the authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
