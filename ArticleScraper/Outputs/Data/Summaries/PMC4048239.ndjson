{"summary": "HCV is a major causative agent of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. this genome encodes a large polyprotein, which is processed by host and viral proteases into 10 viral proteins that consist of three structural proteins, six nonstructural proteins, and a small hydrophobic peptide, p7 [1], [2]. viral RNA interacts with Core protein in juxtaposition to LD for virus packaging. interaction between NS5A and Core protein plays an important role in virus assembly. NS proteins, including NS2, NS3 and NS4B, have also been shown to influence the production of infectious virus. exosomes derived from cells containing HCV subgenomic replicon have been demonstrated to contain HCV RNA, but not viral NS proteins. NS5A and Core proteins are closely associated with and co-transported along the microtubules from the perinuclear region of cells. rep 1.1 cells harbor a genotype 1b HCV subgenomic replicon. they were grown in the afore-mentioned medium containing 0.5 mg/ml of G418. the same batch of culture supernatant from virus-infected and the control cells was used in all experiments. the same batch of culture supernatant from virus-infected and the control cells, including HCV subgenomic replicon cells (HCV assembly-defective replicon cells) was used in all experiments. total RNA was isolated from cell lysates using a QIAamp viral RNA kit (Roche) qRT-PCR was performed as described previously [10], [40] for immuno-EM, samples were first incubated with an anti-NS5A, anti-Core or anti-E2 mouse MAb. grids were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and blocked in a solution of 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 20 min cells were incubated with actinomycin D (10 g/ml) for 30 min. 20 l of BrUTP/Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) mixture were added to each well containing 500 l medium. cells were treated with 10 M nocodazole or taxol for 1 h. cell fixation and immunostaining were performed by the methods described below. the gray-scale of the 8-bit images ranged from 0 (black) to 256 (white) image analysis was carried out using the Integrated Morphometry Analysis program provided by MetaMorph. Rabbit polyclonal Abs against Core (RR8) and NS4B (RR12) were described previously [15]. secondary Abs against mouse, rabbit and goat were purchased from Invitrogen Molecular Probes. virus-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against TNE buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. the fractions were then concentrated by 10-fold in Ultracel-3k concentration devices (Millipore) and further processed for electron microscopy applications or infection. grids were incubated with primary Abs and normal mouse IgG for overnight at 4\u00b0C. grids were stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 1 min. purified virus was treated with 0.01% saponin in PBS for 20 min. the weighted colocalization coefficient is the sum of intensities of colocalization pixels relative to the overall sum of pixel intensities above the threshold. the shortest and longest average distance between the BrUTP-labeled viral RNA signal center and the nearest edge of LD were calculated manually using ZEN software (Zen 2009 light edition; Carl Zeiss Inc) microtubules also provide tracks for the transport of NS5A or the NS5A-containing RC and Core protein to reach the LD, where virus assembly occurs. we propose that microtubules also provide tracks for the transport of NS5A or the NS5A-containing RC and Core protein to reach the LD. the same enlarged area is defined in terms of two proteins at a time, as indicated, in the adjoining panels in Fig. A and B, and six panels in Fig. C. Bars, 10 m. nocodazole blocks the transport of NS5A and Core protein to the lipid droplet. the same images are shown for Core (red) or NS5A (red) and with DAPI (blue) in the lower panels of Fig. A and C. the same images are shown for Core (red) or NS5A (red) and with DAPI (blue) in the lower panels of Fig. A and C. nocodazole treatment at low concentrations affected the colocalization of Core and NS5A with LD. nocodazole treatment at low concentrations affected the colocalization of NS5A and NS5A with LD (Fig. 2B and Fig. 2D) the same images are shown for Core (green) or NS5A (green) and with DAPI (blue) in the lower panels of Fig. A and C, respectively. the same images are shown for Core (green) or NS5A (green) and with DAPI (blue) the number of BrUTP-labeled speckles averaged 30 per cell. in the DMSO control and taxol-treated cells, the number of speckles was reduced to an average of 11 per cell. the average distance between the speckle center and the nearest edge of LD was 0.43 m. LDs and nuclei were stained with BODYPI 493/503 (blue) and DAPI (cyan), respectively. the number of BrUTP-labeled viral RNA was counted manually. the average distance between the center of the signal emitted by the BrUTP-labeled viral RNA and the nearest edge of LD (HCV RNA-LD distance) were analyzed by using Zeiss LSM Zen software. membrane marker, anti-Core, and either anti-NS5A or -NS4B Abs. NS5A and Core protein colocalized in perinuclear region and at cell periphery. NS4B colocalized with Core protein only in perinuclear region, but not with NS4B. plasma membrane and nuclei were stained with antibodies specific for Core protein (red) and NS5A (green) or NS4B (green) (lower row) the cells were labeled with antibodies specific for Core protein (red) and NS5A (red) or NS4B (red) (upper row) LDs and nuclei were stained with BODYPI 493/503 (blue) (E) and DAPI (gray) the second and third panels in each row are magnified views, marked with a white box in the panel at the extreme left. colocalization of core protein with NS5A or -NS4B is depicted as yellow. NS5A-Core and NS4B-Core complexes colocalized with LDs and early endosomes. NS5A-Core complexes, but not NS4B, colocalized with the late endosomes. NS5A and Core protein colocalized with the microtubules in the peripheral region of cytoplasm. the number of anti-Core and anti-NS5A antibodies-labeled signals at the plasma membrane averaged 63 and 26 per cell, respectively. the number of anti-NS5A antibodies-labeled signals at the plasma membrane averaged 63 and 26 per cell, respectively, whereas that for anti-NS4B was less than 1. colocalization of Core-NS5A or -NS4B protein complexes with microtubules (A) or plasma membrane (B) is depicted as magenta (A) or yellow (B) the microtubule end (white arrow) is closest to the cell periphery (A) NS5A is released from the plasma membrane as a component of some virion particles. we cultured HCV-infected cells with dialyzed serum to reduce nonspecific binding of irrelevant proteins to virus particles. the culture supernatant was subject to sucrose gradient sedimentation. aliquot of each fraction was used to infect naive Huh7.5 cells. intracellular HCV RNA copy number per g of total RNA was determined 3 days after infection by qRT-PCR. HCV particles and immunogold labeled HCV particles from the combined analysis of two independent viral preparations. we analyzed the various fractions for the possible presence of Core and NS5A. the low-density fraction 7 (1.083 g/ml) contained abundant Core protein, but no NS5A or NS4B. morphology and composition of virus particles in both the LDF and HDF were further characterized. the diameter of particles ranged from 105 to 132 nm (n = 60) and 52 to 86 nm (n = 90) in the low- and high-density pools, respectively. the virion core of LDF, but not the HDF, could be stained with anti-NS5A antibody. the specificity of staining was confirmed by staining under various treatment conditions. in all virus samples, normal IgG or anti-NS4B antibody yielded very little staining with or without the saponin treatment. plasma membrane and nuclei were co-stained with anti-Core (red) or -NS5A (red) or -NS4B (red) and anti-CD81 (green) plasma membrane and nuclei were stained with WGA Alexa Fluor 647 conjugate (blue) and DAPI (gray) colocalization of NS5A with Core protein and microtubules in lipid droplets. HCV-infected cells were co-stained with anti-tubulin (green), -NS5A (red) (A) and/or -Core (red, B; blue, C) antibodies. Huh7.5 cells were first infected with HCV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 for 3 h. the cells were treated with either nocodazole or taxol for 2 days. the cells were stained with anti-Core (red) (A) or -NS5A (red) antibodies. the total fluorescence intensities of Core protein and NS5A were measured. a total of 20 cells were used for calculation of colocalization efficiency and total fluorescence intensity from two independent experiments. immunoblot analysis also showed that the levels of NS5A and Core proteins in the cells were not significantly affected by the low concentration (up to 4 M) of nocodazole or taxol used. this was in contrast to the effects of nocodazole at 10 or more M used in most of the published studies. NS5A and calnexin (D) were analyzed by using Zeiss LSM Zen software. a total of 20 cells were used for calculation of colocalization efficiency. newly synthesized membrane proteins generally leave the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to other destinations. the average distance between the center and the nearest edge of LD increased from 0.43 m in the DMSO controls and taxol-treated cells to 1.63 m in the nocodazole-treated cells. data suggest that NS5A or the NS5A-containing replication complexes and Core protein are transported to the LDs through microtubules. a total of 20 cells were used for quantitation and calculation of the HCV RNA-LD distance and the nearest edge of LD (HCV RNA-LD distance) a total of 20 cells were used for quantitation and calculation of the HCV RNA-LD distance and the number of BrUTP-labeled viral RNA from two independent experiments and error bars represent standard deviation of the mean. the total fraction of NS5A that colocalized with Core protein was 76%. the NS5A-Core complex colocalized in the peripheral region in 33% of the cells. NS4B-Core did not colocalize at all in the same region. LDs and nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) and DAPI (gray) LDs and nuclei were stained with BODYPI 493/503 (blue) (E) and DAPI (gray), respectively. the second and third panels in each row are magnified views. localization of NS5A or -NS4B complexes with LDs (E), early endosomes (F) or late endosomes (G) is depicted as yellow (A, B, D, E, F, G) the HCV-infected cells were labeled with anti-NS5A or -NS4B Ab. in the perinuclear region of cytoplasm, both the NS5A-Core and NS4B-Core complexes colocalized with the early endosomes. in the peripheral region, only the NS5A-Core complex, but not the NS4B-Core, colocalized with the late endosomes. NS5A and Core protein colocalized with the microtubules in the peripheral region of cytoplasm. signals containing both NS5A and Core (5 per cell on average) were also detected at the plasma membrane. no NS4B-Core signals were found at the plasma membrane. NS5A (Fig. 6D), core protein (Fig.6E) and the core-NS5A complex (Fig. 6F) localized mainly to patches or clusters. images from 20 cells were counted manually using an original magnification of 630. a quantitation analysis performed by an observer blinded to the experimental treatment. NS5A and Core are localized in clusters or patches on the plasma membrane. two peaks, one from fractions 7\u20138, with density of 1.083 to 1.098 g/ml sucrose (low-density fractions; LDF), and another from fractions 11\u201313 with density of 1.145 to 1.178 g/ml sucrose (high-density fractions; HDF) were found to contain distinct HCV RNA signals. both the LDF and HDF from culture supernatant contained infectivity. HCV particles were purified from two pooled fractions. the low-density particles (from fractions 7 to 8) and the high-density particles (from fractions 11 to 13) the virus samples were untreated (D) or treated with 0.01% saponin (E, F) the low-density fraction 7 (1.083 g/ml) contained NS5A in addition to Core protein, but no NS4B. recent studies have revealed that HCV virion release requires late endosome (or multivesicular body; MVB) [10], the functional endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) [46], [47] and hepatocyte receptor tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs) [45], all particles of 130 nm and 70 nm in diameter were observed in the extracellular space surrounding the HCV-infected cells. after treatment with saponin (0.01%), the size of the particles was reduced to 35-41 nm for both the LDF and HDF viruses. however, only E2 protein, but not CD81, was detected in the high-density pool. anti-CD81 and -NS5A antibodies also yielded very little staining. anti-Core (70%) and -NS5A (40%) stained intact virus samples strongly. NS5A or Core protein colocalized with CD81 at the plasma membrane. immuno-EM of plasma membrane co-labeled with antibodies against Core (6 nm) (B) or NS5A (6 nm) (C) and CD81 (18 nm) are shown. Arrowheads, gold-labeled Core and NS5A. Bars, 200 nm and 50 nm (B and C, left and right panels, respectively) NS5A-Core complexes were detected at the plasma membrane of the cells. NS5A-containing, low-density HCV particles constitute a minor population of the released HCV virions. this population was apparently infectious, though with slightly lower specific infectivity than the bulk of virus particles. the low-density, NS5A-containing virions are released off the cell via exosomes, whereas the high-density particles exit the cell via some alternative mechanism not involving the exosomal pathway. the NS5A-containing particles most likely exit the cells via fusion of MVB to the plasma membrane. NS5A was detected only in a minor population of low-density HCV particles. it was also possible that the affinity tag used in the previous study could not be detected in the low-density HCV particles. a postbinding fusion step within an acidic endosomal compartment is required for HCV entry. infected cells were fixed and processed for EM. large-diameter (A, white arrows) and small-diameter (B, black arrows) were released from plasma membrane."}
