{"summary": "studies have detected antibodies against p53, a well-characterized tumor antigen that is commonly mutated in cancer. antibodies against the HPV-16 E6 and HPV-16 E7 oncoproteins are highly specific biomarkers for the presence of HPV-driven tumors. LIPS immunoassays have been highly informative in elucidating patient subsets in autoimmune and infectious diseases [15,16,17,18], the discovery of new autoimmune conditions [19], the identification of novel pathogens [20,21], and for the diagnosis of pandemic viruses [22,23]. a streamlined version, LIPSTICKS, employing magnetic capture of immune complexes, was able to quickly and accurately measure diagnostic antibodies associated with six different autoimmune and infectious diseases all human serum samples from Conversant Bio were collected, processed, and distributed in full ethical and regulatory compliance with the sites from which they were collected. the HV controls (n = 20) represented subjects with an average age of 57 years and were 80% male. the average age of cancer diagnosis was 61 years and 75% were male. ds constructs into Cos1 cells were determined with a tube luminometer. 40 L of buffer A, 10 L of diluted human sera (1 L equivalent) and the luciferase-antigen cell extract (input of approximately 10 million LU) were added to each well of a microtiter plate for 1 h. the reaction mix is tapped two times to disperse the magnetic beads. then 100 L of buffer A is pipetted into the reaction mixture. a 1/8 diameter neodymium magnetic stick is then immersed into the tube containing the beads for 5 s to collect the immune complexes. serum samples from colon cancer (CC), systemic lupus erythematosus and HNSCC patients were obtained from Conversant Bio. subjects provided written informed consent under the Western Institutional Review Board approved by Conversant Bio. subjects provided written informed consent under the Western Institutional Review Board approved by Conversant Bio. the integrity of the described constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. luciferase antigen lysates were produced from transfection of DNA plasmids constructs into Cos1 cells. a 30% suspension (6 L) of ultralink protein A/G beads was added to each well of a 96-well filter HTS plate. a slightly modified version of the assay was used which changed the order of reagent addition and produced a higher signal. 5 L of the diluted serum sample (1:50 in water) is added to 5 L of the nanoLuc-E6 fusion protein cell extract (30 million LU/ L) in a 1.5 mL microfuge tube and then 5 L of diluted paramagnetic beads (Thermo Scientific/Pierce\u00ae protein A/G magnetic beads, Waltham, MA, USA wild type p53 were evaluated in serum samples from a cohort that included HV (n = 20), CC (n = 20) and HNSCC (n = 20) a cut-off value was assigned based on the antibody values corresponding to the mean plus three standard deviations of the 20. each symbol represents individual samples from twenty HV controls, twenty colon cancer (CC) patients and twenty head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. antibodies against E2, E7, and E6 HPV-16 proteins were analyzed. eight (45%) of the HNSCC patients showed high E2 antibody levels that were approximately 20\u2013100 times higher than the mean levels of the HV controls. nine subjects were seropositive for E6, eight overlapping subjects were E2 seropositive and 7 subjects were seropositive for E7 protein. the presence of nine samples in the HNSCC group (45%) was statistically different than the complete absence of E6 seropositivity in either the HV group or subjects with colon cancer. three standard deviations of the HV controls revealed a diagnostic performance of 89% (8/9) sensitivity. the E6 antibody levels detected by the LIPSTICKS format were significantly different (p 0.0001) between the HPV-negative HNSCC and HPV-positive HNSCC cases. this suggests that the E6 LIPSTICK test has the potential to diagnose HPV-16-associated HNSCC. dic device coupled with immunoassay detected HPV-16 E6 antibodies with moderate diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. the one-minute LIPSTICKS assay performed quite well to detect HPV-16 E6 antibodies associated with HNSCC."}
