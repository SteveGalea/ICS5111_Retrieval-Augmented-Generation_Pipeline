{"summary": "the patient was a 77-year-old male with relevant cardiac comorbidities. he was hospitalized at the Santa Maria Goretti Hospital in Latina 2 days after symptoms onset and died after 10 hours the hospitalization. virological diagnosis was made at the regional reference laboratory for arboviral infections. the patient was a 77-year-old male with relevant cardiac comorbidities. he was hospitalized at the Santa Maria Goretti Hospital in Latina 2 days after symptoms onset and died after 10 hours the hospitalization. virological diagnosis was made at the regional reference laboratory for arboviral infections. virological investigation Molecular diagnosis was based on real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR; RealStar Chikungunya RT-PCR Kit 2.0, Altona Diagnostics GmbH, Germany). virological diagnostic investigation was based on indirect immunofluorescence assay (Arbovirus Fever Mosaic 2 IgG and IgM, Euroimmun, Germany). the patient had a history of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), chronic obliterative arteriopathy of the inferior limbs, and bilateral carotid atherosclerosis. in July, he underwent contrast cardiac ventriculography for acute neurological syndrome that had started in the previous 3 hours. blood tests showed a white blood cell count of 6.290 103 uL (neutrophils 90%, lymphocytes 2.1%); red blood cell count of 3.666 106 uL; hemoglobin of 11.2 gr; and a platelet count of 179.000 103 uL. CHIKV infection was diagnosed on the basis of positive RT-PCR test. the sequence clustered with recent isolates belonging to the Indian Ocean sublineage of ECSA. the sequence showed only 1 nucleotide difference (synonymous substitution at position nt 3126 of nonstructural polyprotein) the tree also includes CHIKV/ITA/Lazio-INMI2-2017. the levels of IFN-, IFN-, and IL-6 were extremely high in this fatal case as compared with nonfatal cases. the levels of IFN-, IFN-, and IL-6 seemed not to be directly correlated to the levels of CHIKV RNA, as expressed by Ct values. the patient had a high fever (up to 39\u00b0C) and widespread arthromyalgia during the previous 2 days. he underwent contrast cardiac ventriculography for acute neurological syndrome. he was conscious and presented deviation of the angle of the mouth toward the right side. ation tests, no electrolyte alterations, creatinine of 1.10 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein of 1.37 mg/dL (normal range, 0\u20130.5) blood cultures were negative. the patient was transferred to a subintensive unit in stable condition with a fever. after 9-hour admission in subintensive unit care, the patient died of acute cardiac arrest. maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree is based on general timer reversible substitution model of the complete genome sequence of the isolate CHIKV/ITA/Lazio-INMI2-2017. the tree also includes CHIKV/ITA/Lazio-INMI2-2017 (MG049915), that is, the prototype sequence representing the same outbreak. levels of circulating interferon (IFN)-, IFN-, IFN-, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, and interleukin (IL)-6 were determined in plasma samples from a fatal case of CHIKV infection, anzio, Italy, 2017. white dots indicate the corresponding CHIKV RNA levels expressed as Ct values. DISCUSSION CF is generally considered a self-limiting and nonfatal disease. inflammatory cytokines revealed a strong increase of circulating type-I IFN. IL-6 pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine response contributes to pathogenesis of several viral infections. inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are thought to be involved in pathogenesis of CHIKV. studies have shown that abnormally elevated type-I IFN levels can cause morbidity and mortality, as opposed to protection, during influenza virus infection in animal models. however, due to the extremely small number of CHIKV-infected patients, it is not possible to establish whether CHIKV or the underlying cardiac dysfunction was the actual cause of the altered cytokine profile.
