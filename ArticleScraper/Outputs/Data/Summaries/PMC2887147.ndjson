{"summary": "the novel influenza A (H1N1) 2009 caused an epidemic of critical illness. some patients rapidly developed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. cytokines produced at the site of infection mediate many of the clinical and pathological manifestations of influenza infection. serum 17 cytokines were within normal ranges of IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1b. IL-1b, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 17, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-, MCP-1 and TNF- were normal or slightly increased. work from our group was the first to report the early elevation of chemokines and Th1 and Th17 cytokines in severe pH1N1 infected adults. more recently, to and colleagues [6] showed similar results, also in adults. chemokine and cytokine patterns very similar to those we found in adults. the authors declare that they have no competing interests. the study group of Martn-Loeches et al. is supported by the Ministry of Science of Spain."}
