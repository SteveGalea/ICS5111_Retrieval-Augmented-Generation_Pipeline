{"summary": "traditional methods of culture and antibody-based detection still play a central role in microbiological laboratories despite the delay between disease presentation and diagnosis. faster diagnosis of infections would reduce morbidity and mortality, for example, through the earlier implementation of appropriate antimicrobial treatment. these approaches are beginning to rapidly decrease laboratory turnaround times so that results can be available within 2-6 hours compared to perhaps 24 hours. pathogen-specific microarray probes may cross-hybridize with non-target probes. this can result in false-positive signals that lead to erroneous conclusions. this latter phenomenon could provide useful information for pathogen identification to the extent such cross-hybridization can be accurately predicted. array was designed to detect up to 35 RNA viruses using 40-mer probes tiled at an average 8-base resolution across the full length of each genome. oligonucleotide array was designed to detect up to 35 RNA viruses using 40-mer probes tiled at an average 8-base resolution across the full length of each genome. oligonucleotide array contained a total of 390,482 probes. the array probes that failed to hybridize each contained at least 3 mismatches (within a 15-base stretch) to the sample sequence. the array probes that failed to hybridize each contained at least 3 mismatches (within a 15-base stretch) median probe signal intensity decreased sharply to background levels at HD = 7 and MCM = 15, with 43% and 46% detectable probes. the majority of probes had HD scores between 8 and 21 and/or MCM scores between 0 and 15, of which only 1.23% and 1.57%, respectively, were detectable. the optimal cross-hybridization thresholds HD 4 or MCM 18, where >98% of probes can be detected, is shaded in blue. a given probe could belong to multiple r-signatures, thereby maximizing probe-level evidence for pathogen detection. a given probe could belong to multiple r-signatures, thereby maximizing probe-level evidence for pathogen detection. 320 2 2 316 9 325 13 Yellow fever Flaviviridae 10,862 1,389 255 2 3 250 2 252 14 Hepatitis B Hepadnaviridae 3,215 409 147 14 0 133 0 133 15 Influenza A Orthomyxoviridae 12,561 1,582 510 1 15 494 0 494 16 Influenza B Orthomyxoviridae 14,452 1,822 665 5 18 642 2 644 we compared all probes to the human genome assembly (build 17) by BLAST using a word size of 15 [21] as cross-hybridization with human sequences could confound results. r-signature would be one where all probes would hybridize to the target sequence at detectable levels. polymorphic variation between the probes and the actual target would be expected to impede the performance of the r-signature probes at some level. the dengue 1 sequence used to derive the Dengue 1 r-signature was approximately 5% different from the Hawaiian isolate. a 500-1,000 base-pair product can be generated from each possible starting position in the genome assuming that a nonamer in the random primer mix will complement the viral sequence perfectly. to validate the algorithm, we ranked the hybridization signal intensities for all 1,948 probes tiled across the RSV B genome and compared them to their AES values. r-signatures used 9,768 of the >50,000 unique probes initially included on the array. the 1,948 probes tiled across the RSV B genome were binned according to different filtering criteria and plotted against the percentage of probes with detectable signal. >70% of viral probes had signal intensities above detection threshold when using primer A2 compared to approximately 20% using primer A1. a large proportion of probes comprising the signature of a detectable pathogen have relatively strong signal intensities resulting in a right-skewed distribution. the presence of a pathogen is indicated by a non-normal distribution caused by outlier WKL = 17, corresponding to RSV. the original KL cannot reliably determine differences in the tails of a probability distribution, and is highly dependent on the number of probes per genome and the size of each signal intensity bin. PDA algorithm is extremely fast, capable of making a diagnosis from a hybridized microarray in less than 10 seconds. 36 specimens were obtained from children under 4 years of age with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), of which 14 were hospitalized for severe disease and 22 with ambulatory LRTI. 10-29 Pneumovirus Pneumovirus 24.8 5.0 104 133 71180 22.33 6.93 10-62 Pneumovirus

5.4 105 412 35890 19.66 2.42 10-49 RSV B RSV B 23.5 we binned probes into family- or genus-level r-signatures by relaxing similarity criteria (to HD 5 or MCM 25) and selecting probes common to genome sequences within families and genera for the picornaviridae family, paramyxoviridae family, rhinovirus genus and pneumovirus genus (inclusive of RSV and hMPV) the microarray identified the majority of HRV and RSV A samples using the genus-level r-signatures. it failed to detect three samples positive for HRV and three positive for RSV A by real-time PCR. these false negatives had an average Ct value >32, again suggesting a detection threshold close to that of real-time PCR. our analytical output includes both family- and genus-level predictions (for r-signatures restricted to conserved probes) as well as species-specific predictions (for r-signatures composed of conserved and unique probes) only one algorithm, E-Predict, has been reported and validated [5,29,30] a major strength of PDA is its ability to specifically identify sequence-characterized and co-infecting pathogens with low false positivity. this is demonstrated by the ability of PDA to detect specifically the presence of Dengue 1 in the clinical sample. the benefits of using both algorithms simultaneously for detecting both known and novel pathogens should be further evaluated. alternative technologies, such as beads [31, microfluidics [32,33] and nanotube microarrays [34], might provide advantages in both assay cost and speed relative to traditional microarray platforms. oligonucleotide array was designed to detect up to 35 RNA viruses using 40-mer probes tiled at an average 8-base resolution across the full length of each genome. all 3,805 SARS-specific probes displaying fluorescent (Cy3) signal well above the detection threshold. cross-hybridization with other pathogen probe sets was minimal, observed only for other members of Coronaviridae and a few species of Picornaviridae. the hybridization pattern of dengue 1 on the other hand was more complex. hybridization signatures corresponding to (a) SARS Sin850 or (b) Dengue 1 Hawaiian isolate are shown. we calculated the HD and MCM scores for every probe relative to the Hawaiian Dengue 1 isolate. all probes on the array with high similarity to the Hawaiian Dengue I genome, that is, HD 2 (n = 942) or MCM 27 (n = 627), hybridized with median signal intensity 3 SD above detection threshold. 85% probe detection and median signal intensity approximately 1.2 SD above detection threshold. we defined r-signatures for each of the 35 pathogen genomes represented on the array. each pathogen's r-signature comprised tiling probes derived from its genome sequence (HD = 0, MCM = 40), as well as cross-hybridizing probes derived from other pathogens. 6 SARS Coronaviridae 29,711 3,805 575 8 2 565 1 566 7 Dengue serotype 1 Flaviviridae 10,717 1,370 230 2 8 220 8 228 8 Dengue serotype 2 Flaviviridae 10,722 1,370 241 0 9 232 11 243 9 Dengue

censored probes with GC 40% or >60% from the r-signatures. the ideal pathogen r-signature would be one where all probes would hybridize to the target sequence at detectable levels. however, polymorphic variation between the probes and the actual target would be expected to impede the performance of the r-signature probes at some level. sequence polymorphisms, probe GC content and genome secondary structure failed to explain this phenomenon. the random primer used in our experiments was a 26-mer composed of a random nonamer (3') tagged with a fixed 17-mer sequence (5'-GTTTCCCAGTCACGATA) the probes tiled across the hMPV genome showed a similar result, P = 1.3 10-9. Repeatedly, we observed that higher AES correlated with greater probe detection, with, on average, >70% detection for probes in the top 20% AES. the probes that have detectable signal above threshold are shown in purple in the corresponding heatmaps. primer A2, which had the highest average AES for all 35 viruses present on the array, was selected as the 'AES-optimized' primer. primer A2 showed a marked improvement in overall PCR efficiency in amplifying both RSV and hMPV over the original primer, A1 (Figures S2 and S3 in Additional data file 1). RNA isolated from a patient was hybridized onto the array. distribution of probe signal intensities of all 53,555 probes (red) and r-signature probes for an absent pathogen shows a normal distribution. a non-normal WKL score distribution is observed (P 0.05 by Anderson-Darling test) k 1 Q a ( j ) log ( Q a ( j ) Q a ( j ) 1 Q a ( j ) where Qa(j) is the cumulative distribution function of the signal intensities of the probes in P a found in bin bj. R-signatures representing absent pathogens should have normal signal intensity distributions. those representing present pathogens should have high, statistically significant outlying WKL scores. twenty-one specimens tested positive for one or more viruses, while fifteen were PCR-negative for all three. all specimens were analyzed by microarray in a blinded fashion. 10-14 Pneumovirus Pneumovirus 26.2 1.1 105 8.3 1.92 10-4 HRV HRV 29.1 3.1 104 355 35662 18.00 2.97 10-40 Pneumovirus Pneumovirus 20.3 6.7 106 368* 66702 ND ND ND 374 66695 ND Pneumovirus 34.1 500 378 70933 13.82 7.77 10-17 Pneumovirus Pneumovirus 23.9 we first assessed array performance using only results from 16 patients diagnosed with either hMPV or RSV B by PCR. the microarray correctly detected the presence of hMPV or RSV B in 13/16 samples. this corresponds to a diagnostic accuracy of 94%. hMPV hMPV 24.8 5.0 104 133 71180 22.33 6.93 10-62 hMPV hMPV 25.1 4.0 104 165 66691 16.95 3.49 10-4 hMPV hMPV 27.9 3.9 103 254 70935 25.02 2.87 10-39 hMPV hMPV 22 5.4 105 769 73067 24.62 3.70 10-52 hMPV hMPV 22 the microarray made only two positive calls in this group, both for RSV B. both RSV calls correspond to high-titre RSV A specimens by PCR. this suggests certain probe sets can detect the presence of related viruses. re-screened all 36 samples by PCR and found HRV in 11 specimens. all nine HRV calls by microarray were confirmed by PCR except for one. this finding was intriguing given that the genomic diversity of the over 100 known rhinovirus serotypes makes detection by PCR notoriously difficult. the microarray is based on probes designed to recognize the most conserved viral domains. the microarray described a probe-dense resequencing array capable of detecting a smaller set of predefined pathogens. this capability allowed us to detect and accurately identify viruses in clinical samples. real-time PCR using pancoronavirus primers and primers specific for strains OC43 and 229E indicated the absence of coronavirus from this sample. a major strength of PDA is its ability to specifically identify sequence-characterized and co-infecting pathogens with low false positivity. the benefits of using both algorithms simultaneously for detecting both known and novel pathogens should be further evaluated. microarrays have the potential to revolutionize clinical diagnostics through their ability to simultaneously investigate thousands of potential pathogens in order to make a diagnosis. however, questions remain regarding their sensitivity and reliability. future improvements will include significant reduction in microarray manufacturing and usage costs. in total, 390,482 probes were synthesized on the array. sample preparation, microarray hybridization and staining Dengue (ATCC #VR-1254) was cultured as per ATCC recommendations.
