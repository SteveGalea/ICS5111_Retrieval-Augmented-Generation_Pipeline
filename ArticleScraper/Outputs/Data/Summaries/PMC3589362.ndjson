{"summary": "relatively resistant (C57BL/6) or susceptible (CBA/J) mice have low numbers of antigen-specific CD4 T cells that produce relatively small amounts of IFN- [1]\u2013[4], contributing to their increased susceptibility to infection. the importance of CD8+ T cells during Mtb infection remains unclear. IL-10 [22]\u2013[24] and surface expression of inhibitory molecules, such as programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin protein-3 (Tim-3) [26]. PD-1 has classically been used as a marker of T cell exhaustion in viral infection and in cancer [27]\u2013[30] and that cells expressing Tim-3 are dysfunctional and lack regulation [31], [32]. cells could secrete IL-10 during chronic infection during chronic infection. depletion of IL-10 in the lung did not overtly change the Mtb burden in the timeframe tested. zygous breeder colony of CBA/J IL-10/ mice was maintained. all protocols were approved by the Ohio State University's Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee. cell screen and residual erythrocytes were lysed with Gey's solution. non-adherent cells were washed and removed from the plates. GM-EL4 conditioned media was replaced on days 2, 4 and 6. 3104 BMDCs were infected overnight with Mtb Erdman at an MOI of 11 then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. infected BMDCs were cultured with 2105 CD8+ T cells or CD8neg T cells for 72 hr at 37\u00b0C. CD4+ (GK1.5), PE-Cy7 anti-CD8+ (53\u20136.7), PerCP-Cy5.5 anti-CD8+ (53\u20136.7), PE-Cy7 anti-IFN- (XMG1.2), PE anti-PD-1 (J43), FITC anti-CD122 (TM-Beta 1), and FITC V screening kit were purchased from eBiosciences. the study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals of the national Institutes of health. the protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The Ohio State University. stocks were grown in Proskauer-Beck liquid medium containing 0.05% Tween 80 to mid-log phase and frozen in 1 mL aliquots at 80\u00b0C. at specific time points post Mtb infection mice were sacrificed and lungs were removed into sterile saline. non-adherent cells were washed and removed from the plates. BMDCs were plated at 37\u00b0C in 1 ml of GM-EL4 conditioned media. GM-EL4 conditioned media was replaced on days 2, 4 and 6. infected BMDCs were cultured with 2105 CD8+ T cells or CD8neg T cells for 72 hr at 37\u00b0C in media containing either tissue culture media alone or 10 g/mL anti-CD3 (145-2C11) and 1 g/mL anti-CD28 (37.51) after incubation plates were frozen at 80\u00b0C until all timepoints were completed. PE anti-PD-1 (J43), FITC anti-CD122 (TM-Beta 1) and FITC V screening kit were purchased from eBiosciences. samples were read using an LSRII flow cytometer and analyzed with FACSDiva software. p0.05, ** p0.01, *** p0.001 results CD8+ T cells accumulate in the lungs of CBA/J mice as Mtb infection progresses. C57BL/6 mice showed a significant late accumulation of CD8+ T cells in the lungs of CBA/J mice. this late accumulation was absent from C57BL/6 mice which reached a plateau at day 60. a significant increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was observed in CBA/J IL-10/ mice at day 30, reflecting enhanced TH1 immunity in these mice. the accumulation of CD8+ T cells in the lungs of CBA/J mice during chronic infection is not mediated by IL-10. CD8+ T cells in wild-type or IL-10/ CBA/J mice as determined by flow cytometry. results representative of at least three independent experiments with 5 mice per group. phenotype was not associated with TH1 cytokine secretion but was linked to immuno-suppressive properties including IL-10 production. phenotype of pulmonary T cells in chronic Mtb infected CBA/J mice. IL-10-secreting CD8neg cells were predominantly CD4+ as adherent cells were removed during cell purification. IL-10-secreting CD8neg cells were predominantly CD4+ as adherent cells were removed during cell purification. we have failed to detect IL-10 within B cells and neutrophils in both mice. C57BL/6 and CBA/J mice were infected with an aerosolized dose of Mtb. at various times post-infection lungs were removed and cell populations were purified. clonal repertoire of CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice are clonally expanded. in CBA/J mice at day 120 after Mtb infection, V expression was comparable on CD4+ T cells from both mouse strains. the percentage of CD8+ T cells expressing V8 or V14 was always significantly higher throughout Mtb infection. p0.05, ** p0.01, *** p0.001 obtained by Student's t test. data indicate a dominant role for CD8+ V8+ expressing T cells in the IL-10 production we previously observed. IL-10 and V8+ CD8+ T cells were increasing in the lungs of CBA/J mice. depletion of CD4+ T cells led to significantly increased Mtb burden. depletion of a known protective T cell subset also failed to significantly impact the Mtb burden. pulmonary IL-10 after CD8+ T cell depletion as determined by flow cytometry. control group = no treatment and isotype control. depletion resulted in 95% reduction in cell number. a significant increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was observed in CBA/J IL-10/ mice at day 30, reflecting enhanced TH1 immunity in these mice. the accumulation of CD8+ T cells in the lungs of CBA/J mice during chronic infection is not mediated by IL-10. C57BL/6 and CBA/J lungs were homogenized and plated on 7H11 plates for CFU enumeration. results representative of at least three independent experiments with 5 mice per group. cells reached a plateau as early as day 30 post-infection. over 40% of all CD8+ T cells in the lungs of CBA/J mice were activated. CD8+ T cells expressed the suppressor of TH1 responses Tim-3. data representative of at least two independent experiments with 4 mice per group per timepoint. p0.05, ** p0.01, *** p0.001 obtained by two-way analysis of variance comparing only CBA/J mice across all timepoints. CD8+ cells from CBA/J mice, and not C57BL/6 mice, were capable of secreting IL-10 in response to TcR cross-linking. CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice were infected with an aerosolized dose of Mtb. the low SFU, relative to TcR cross-linking, likely reflects the challenges of delivering of Mtb antigen into the appropriate processing pathway. at late stages of Mtb infection, we observed that CD8+ T cells from CBA/J mice primarily expressed two variables of the TcR beta chain (V) V8 (8.2,8.3) and V14 were expressed by approximately 45% of all CD8+ T cells in CBA/J mice at day 120 after Mtb infection. V8+ and V8neg T cells from day 120 post-infection were cultured for 72 hr with anti-CD3/CD28 and IL-10 SFU determined by ELISA. supernatants from (a) were analyzed for IFN- levels by ELISA. in vivo depletion of IL-10 producing CD8+ T cells during chronic Mtb infection alters pro-inflammatory responses but fails to modify the bacterial load CD8+ T cells or V8+ cells were depleted from wild-type CBA/J mice from day 90\u2013120. depletion of CD4+ T cells led to significantly increased Mtb burden and mortality before day 120 showing that depletion of a protective T cell subset increased susceptibility. anti-V8 depleted or control mice were homogenized and plated on 7H11 plates and CFU enumerated after 21 days. depletion resulted in 95% reduction in cell number, as determined by flow cytometry. depletion of V8+ cells or the entire CD8+ T cell population in Mtb-infected mice led to a significant reduction in pulmonary IL-10 levels. however, we observed no significant change in pulmonary CFU following CD8+ or V8+ T cells depletion. in support of a negative role for CD8+ T cells in CBA/J mice, in vivo depletion led to a moderate, albeit not significant, decrease in CFU. this is in contrast to CD4+ T cell depletion in which all the mice were either dead or moribund before the necropsy time point. this is in contrast to CD4+ T cell depletion in which all the mice were either dead or moribund before the necropsy time point clonal expansions of CD8+ T cells with the capacity to produce IL-10 can arise during chronic Mtb infection. it is possible that Mtb infection leads to specific deletion of certain subsets of protective CD8+ T cells or is driving clonal expansion of less protective cells (V8, V14)"}
