{"summary": "MIRAGE syndrome is a recently described disorder consisting of myelodysplasia, infection, restriction of growth, adrenal hypoplasia, genital abnormalities, and enteropathy. it was initially identified in a subset of Japanese patients with syndromic adrenal hypoplasia and is caused by mutations in the SAMD9 gene on chromosome 7. the majority of patients die in infancy because of infections or adrenal crises, while other patients with monosomy 7 renal insufficiency Severe Mild None Severe Severe Genitourinary malformations Vesicoureteral reflux and pelviectasis Microphallus Male w/ hypospadias Female with slight clitoromegaly Absent Microphallus, hypospadias, cryptorchidism Gonads NE Undescended testes bilaterally Descended testes Inguinal testes NR Testicular failure Blood NR NR EBV-PTLD, respiratory failure Respiratory infections, skin GVHD Age at death 23 mo 21 mo NA 5 y NA Comparison of patients with SAMD9-related hematological disorders associated with MIRAGE syndrome. patients 3 to 6 were published elsewhere. we report 2 cases of HSCT in patients with hematological disorders associated with MIRAGE syndrome. one of the first cases of congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia associated with MIRAGE syndrome is the first case of congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia associated with MIRAGE. a repeat bone marrow evaluation was performed at 13 months of age. it showed profound hypocellularity (5% to 10%) with absent megakaryocytes, but without dysplasia. a single-nucleotide polymorphism array specifically did not identify copy neutral loss of heterozygosity. induced expression of the wild-type protein caused mild growth suppression. induced expression of the mutant caused profound growth suppression. bars indicate standard error. donor chimerism evaluations revealed 100% donor chimerism in all blood cell lineages. thymoglobulin, fludarabine, thiotepa, melphalan, melphalan, thymoglobulin, thymoglobulin, fludarabine, thiotepa, melphalan, melphalan, melphalan, melphalan, thymoglobulin remia and hypokalemia requiring IV fluid and electrolyte supplementation; frequent (several times per week) episodes of adrenal crisis and/or dysautonomia. her other complications, occurring at 4 months after transplant, included progressive cytopenias with an immune-mediated component. she eventually was transitioned to comfort measures and died at 9 months posttransplant. possessed this variant in the exome aggregation consortium database. she was enrolled to participate in our institutional Bone Marrow Failure Registry. to verify the pathogenicity of the patient\u2019s SAMD9 variant in vitro, we obtained the patient\u2019s skin biopsy fibroblasts. patient 2 had congenital adrenal hypoplasia, hypothyroidism, severe growth restriction, micropenis, chronic diarrhea with duodenitis and colitis indicative of an enteropathy. he required prolonged intensive care for 131 days because of feeding intolerance, recurrent infections, and chronic lung disease of prematurity. a bone marrow biopsy was performed at 1 year of age. hematopoiesis with dyserythropoiesis and diminished numbers of megakaryocytes was observed. repeat bone marrow biopsy 2 months later confirmed persistent dyserythropoiesis and megakaryocyte hypoplasia with monosomy 7 in 90% of cells by FISH. the patient had a pulseless electrical activity arrest with acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to K pneumoniae sepsis requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and continuous renal replacement therapy due to acute kidney injury. the patient subsequently developed necrotizing fasciitis requiring emergent debridement and died due to cardiopulmonary arrest within a month of coming off of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. 4 previously reported patients have undergone HSCT for bone marrow failure. temperature instability, enteropathy, adrenal crises, predisposition to bacteremia, electrolyte imbalances, and preexisting lung disease significantly complicated the posttransplant course. neither patient fully tolerated enteral feeds likely because of worsening of the MIRAGE-associated enteropathy without significant lower-tract GVHD. all 3 patients with MIRAGE and severe adrenal insufficiency who were transplanted in infancy died of posttransplant complications. 2 patients reported elsewhere4 who had no or only mild adrenal insufficiency underwent successful HSCT for SAMD9-related MDS. another patient with MIRAGE syndrome who presented later in childhood with neutropenia that transitioned to MDS underwent successful HSCT at age 5.6. patients with severe MIRAGE syndrome phenotypes should be aware of the potential for a protracted post-HSCT course. authors declare no competing financial interests."}
