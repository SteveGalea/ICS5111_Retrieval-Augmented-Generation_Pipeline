{"summary": "Ubiquitination of a growing list of pre- and posttranslational proteins can regulate their stability, function and subcellular localization. the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to lysine residues on target proteins is catalyzed by a sequence of enzymatic reactions mediated by E1 ubiquitin-activating enzymes, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and E3 ubiquitin ligases. there are six times more ubiquitin ligases than ubiquitin ligases in the human genome. emerging evidence suggest that DUBs have very specific cellular functions. the function and regulation of most neuronal DUBs are poorly understood. studies of the AMPAR GLR-1 in C. elegans were the first to show that glutamate receptors (GluRs) are regulated by ubiquitin. ubiquitin is directly conjugated to the cytoplasmic tail of GLR-1, providing a signal for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. usp-46 loss-of-function mutants exhibit increased levels of ubiquitinated GLR-1 and decreased levels of GLR-1 at synapses. the abundance of GLR-1(4KR), a mutant receptor which cannot be ubiquitinated, is unaffected in usp-46 loss-of-function mutants. Knock-down of USP46, but not USP12, results in increased levels of ubiquitinated GluA1 and decreased surface and total levels of GluA1. gluA1 is preferentially modified with Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which typically promote endo-lysosomal trafficking. prior studies showed that USP46 preferentially deubiquitinates AMPARs with Lys63- but not Lys48-linked chains in HE otropic receptors are comprised of hetero-pentamers and ubiquitination of specific subunits can regulate receptor trafficking and degradation in an activity-dependent manner. USP46 is also implicated in regulating the GABAergic system in mice. muscimol-induced postsynaptic GABAA receptor currents were slightly reduced in hippocampal neurons of USP46 (K92) mutants. this effect may be mediated by extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. nitrazepam restores depression-like behavior in USP46 (K92) and KO mutant mice. biochemical and proteomic studies showed that two WDR proteins, WDR48 (also known as USP1-associated factor, UAF1) and WDR20, interact with USP46 and USP12 (Cohn et al., 2009; Sowa et al., 2009; Kee et al., 2010). both WDR48 and WDR20 stimulate USP12 and USP46 catalytic activity (kcat) without increasing substrate binding affinity. USP12 and USP46 were crystallized in complexes with WDR48/UAF1 and WDR48/UAF1. WDR48 and WDR20 bind the DUBs relatively far from the catalytic cleft. ubiquitin binds in the palm region of the DUB. the four antiparallel -sheets of the Fingers subdomain are rigid in other USP structures. Binding of WDR48 to the tip of the Fingers subdomain stabilizes the \u201cPinky Finger\u201d and Fingers subdomain, which may ultimately propagate to the catalytic cleft in presence of substrate. gans homologs of WDR48 and WDR20 form a stable ternary complex with USP-46 in HEK293T cells. overexpression of usp-46 in neurons does not stabilize GLR-1. however, co-expression of usp-46 in neurons did increase surface and total levels of GLR-1. phylogenetic conservation of WD40-Repeat Proteins and USP46 WDR proteins and USP46 conserved across phylogeny from yeast to humans. studies in the multicellular filamentous fungi Aspergillus nidulans were the first to describe a role for WDR proteins in regulating DUBs. in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, the USP46 homolog Ubp9 regulates endocytosis, actin dynamics and cell polarity. the WD40 domain of Duf1 stimulates Ubp9 and Ubp13 catalytic activity. the genome of the fruit fly Drosophila melonagaster encodes for one DUB, CG7023, that is homologous to both USP46 and USP12. it will be informative to investigate the null phenotype of the WDR proteins and USP12 in the fly nervous system. 46 as a candidate gene associated with early-onset essential tremor. it will be interesting to learn if mutations in USP46 or its regulators are associated with other neurological disorders."}
