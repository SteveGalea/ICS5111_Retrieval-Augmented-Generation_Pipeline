{"summary": "IgY antibodies are serum immunoglobulin in birds, reptiles and amphibians. they are transferred from serum to egg yolk to confer passive immunity to their embryos and offspring. this systematic review was focused to determine the effect of IgY in controlling and preventing diarrhea in domesticated animals. common way antibiotics have been used in animal agriculture for growth promotion (sub-therapeutic doses), disease prevention (prophylactic doses) and for the treatment (therapeutic dose) for more than 50 years. but the use and misuse of in-feed antibiotics have resulted in serious complications due to drug residues in animal products and increased bacterial resistance. literature search Previous research reports were retrieved from different electronic data bases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPRINGER-LINK, WILEY, AGRICOLA, MEDWELL Journals, Scientific Research Publish and Chinese articles from Core periodicals in 2012. study should have used any one formulation of IgY: purified IgY, partially purified IgY, immune yolk (liquid) or immune yolk powder (spray dried or freeze dried) study should have used any one formulation of IgY: purified IgY, partially purified IgY, immune yolk (liquid) or immune yolk powder. 78.2% for rotavirus, 34.5% for Cryptosporidia, 18% for E. coli and 42% for polyinfection Field Trial: 2 g, 4 g, or 8 g egg powder with specific antibodies to rotavirus types 1 and 2 [Neutralization titer512] and E.coli K99 pilus antigen [ELISA titer 330] each, in a drink \u2013 two meal/day for the first 14 days. the challenge time was 2 hours after first dose of IgY on 2 day after birth Gp1 and Gp4 control IgY Gp 2 and Gp 3 received anti-Shimane IgY [3200 and 6400 titer] Gp 5 and Gp 6 received anti-KK-3 IgY [6400 and 12800 titer] g of combined anti-Shimane and KK-3 IgY 3 times/day for 2 weeks after birth in 50 mL distilled water. oral delivery by50 mL syringe Fecal score and body weight gain were examined (P) Vega et al., 2011 new born Holstein male Calves removed prior to suckling within the first 4 h of life 105.85 FFU of virulent INDIANA BRV between 3rd studies were categorized in to three different groups as good, moderate and poor if the score percentage was 75%, 65% and 55% respectively. the scores such as \u201cYes\u201d denotes low risk of bias, \u201cNo\u201d denotes high risk of bias, \u201cNA\u201d indicates non applicable. the random-effects meta-analysis was taken in to consideration for calculating the relative risk (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) in trails reporting the binary outcome. the subgroup analysis were carried out for the studies reported only in Piglets with following study characteristics, pathogen type \u2013 bacterial or viral and treatment regiment \u2013 prophylactic or therapeutic. abstract by 2 independent authors (TD, XYZ and YW) were reviewed when a decision could not be made using abstract. 2 reviewers independently evaluated the eligibility of each potential full-text article. reviewers assessed the risk of bias, inconsistency and indirectness of the included study \u2013 Calves. 78.2% for rotavirus, 34.5% for Cryptosporidia, 18% for E. coli and 42% for polyinfection Field Trial. unized egg powder [High]; 3) 100 g [75 g EG+50 g immunized egg [Low]; 4) 100 g [75 g EG+25 g immunized egg [Low]; 5) variable doses consisting of High on day 2, Medium on day 3 and Low on day 4 Fecal shedding of E.coli O157:H7 in five consecutive weekly samples. calves fed only milk according to their weight Examined the E fecal consistency score, weight gain, and mortality were assessed. Vega et al., 2011 new born Holstein male Calves removed prior to suckling within first 4 h of life. potential studies were assessed using the Animal Research: Reporting of In-vivo Experiment (ARRIVE) guidelines developed as part of NC3Rs (National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research) the quality was assessed by assessing whether the methodology of included studies met the ARRIVE guideline or not. data synthesis and statistical analysis In accordance with the differences between studies such as different doses, formulation of IgY, pathogenic strains used for challenge, duration of treatment, outcome assessment and age of animals. random-effects meta-analysis was carried out for the studies reported only in Piglets with following study characteristics, pathogen type \u2013 bacterial or viral and treatment regiment \u2013 prophylactic or therapeutic. the characteristics of each included studies are documented and presented in Table S1, S2, S3 and Table 1. some studies mentioned that IgY administration started before challenging with pathogen (prophylactic effect) whereas others reported the effect of IgY against the experimental diarrhea. only two items 7 and 8 show the low risk of bias for all the studies. findings clearly state the inadequacy of quality and standard in the reporting of animal studies on effect of IgY against diarrhea in different animal classes. the line crossing diamond represents the global estimate and its 95% confidence interval. the diamond represents the global estimate and its 95% confidence interval. the cut off line crossing RR 1 differentiates the study favors IgY treatment group or control group.
