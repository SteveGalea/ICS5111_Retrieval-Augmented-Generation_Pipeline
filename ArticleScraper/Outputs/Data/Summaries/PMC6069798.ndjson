{"summary": "quercetin inhibited EV71-mediated cytopathogenic effects, reduced EV71 progeny yields, and prevented EV71-induced apoptosis with low cytotoxicity. there is currently no specific medication for EV71 infection. cetin was predicted to insert into the substrate-binding pocket of EV71 3Cpro, blocking substrate recognition and thereby inhibiting EV71 3Cpro activity. quercetin may act in more than one way to deter viral infection."}
