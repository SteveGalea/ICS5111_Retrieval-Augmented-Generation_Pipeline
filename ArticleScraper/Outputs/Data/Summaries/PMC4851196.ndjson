{"summary": "allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients are exposed to the high risk of virus reactivation. patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia receiving induction or consolidation chemotherapy are at the highest risk of viral infection, especially infections caused by herpes simplex viruses. a recent italian study analyzed 528 febrile episodes among 747 patients receiving induction chemotherapy. only four episodes (0.8%) of viral infections have been reported. the main cause of death in a group of 83 children who received grafts from matched siblings and unrelated donors was relapse. two major improvements have a remarkable impact on the prevention of an infected patient from developing CMV disease. the first factor is the possibility to diagnose the infection in an early phase and with a test that has a great sensibility and specificity. the second factor is the introduction of new drugs potentially being effective against CMV, including ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet and cidofovir. human herpes virus 6 HHV-6 reactivation is detected in the blood of 40\u201360% of HSCT patients. clinical syndromes associated with the infection include delayed engraftment, fever, rash, hepatitis, hepatitis, gastroduodenitis and encephalitis. the diagnosis of HHV-6 infection may be obtained using quantitative PCR-based evaluation of HHV-6 DNA copies per ml in whole blood, plasma or serum. however, chromosomally integrated HHV-6 should be excluded; the prevalence of vertical transmission from mother/father is about 1%. most studies found no association between mortality and HHV-6 infection. respiratory viruses may be associated with many symptoms. these span from cold episodes to croup, bronchiolitis in children and exacerbation of asthma. the incidence of respiratory virus infections differs significantly among the studies. a longer period of surveillance is recommended in patients with severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and those receiving haploidentical, cord blood or unrelated transplant should be monitored for at least 2 months after the end of treatment. the management of CMV infection in HSCT recipients includes: primary infection may be prevented with the selection of the right donor. the treatment of established CMV disease is based on the use of ganciclovir or foscarnet with the addition of immune globulin. drug resistance to ganciclovir resulting from mutations in either the UL97 phosphotransferase gene or in the UL54 gene coding for the DNA polymerase may represent a clinically significant problem. no disease has been associated with HHV-6 in patients with hematological malignancies who have not undergone HSCT. only 40 cases have been described in the literature so far, usually 1\u20132 months post HSCT. encephalitis due to HHV-6 is more common after cord blood or human leukocyte antigen-mismatched graft. prospective monitoring of EBV-DNAemia is strongly recommended in high-risk patients once a week up to 3 months after the transplant. a preemptive approach for EBV-DNAemia represents at present the standard of care, based on the administration of Rituximab associated with the reduction of systemic immunosuppression whenever possible. recent advances in rapid diagnostic methods and a growing number of antiviral agents are allowing for more efficient management strategies against these pathogens."}
