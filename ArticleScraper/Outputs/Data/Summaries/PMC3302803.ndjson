{"summary": "prevalence of novel H1N1 (2009) influenza was significantly lower among vaccinated HCWs than among unvaccinated HCWs (p0.001) higher viral loads in throat swabs were found in HCWs with patient and household contact infection than in those with unspecified contact infection. infection control team has been enhancing infection control training for HCWs and implementing hospital-wide surveillance during outbreaks of infection. the pandemic H1N1 (2009) influenza outbreak rapidly spread worldwide, and cases were recorded even in the winter of 2010 [4], [5], [5], [5]. study was conducted at a 2600-bed tertiary-care center in southern Taiwan. 3986 of 4963 HCWs who worked for KCGMH in 2009 were involved in direct patient care. the infection control program at KCGMH included online education about infection control practices for HCWs, early recognition of index cases in the hospital, and audits for infection control compliance. the details of the infection control program were established as listed in Table 1. the online education module offered lectures aimed at improving understanding of not only influenza, but also of emerging or novel diseases. pandemic H1N1 (2009) influenza from sufferers to non-sufferers crowded at outpatient clinics. provide 75% alcohol-based solution for hand rub in inpatient rooms, corridors, and outpatient clinics. a standard and transmission-based precaution protocol was established before the outbreak. any HCW who developed ILI should report to the infection control team within 24 hours. afebrile HCWs suspected of having H1N1 infection were also required to report to the infection control team within 24 hours. 3986 of 4963 HCWs who worked for KCGMH in 2009 were involved in direct patient care. case definition HCWs were defined as employees of KCGMH providing clinical or nonclinical services. nonclinical HCWs were defined as those who had influenza-like illness. the infection control program at KCGMH included online education about infection control practices for HCWs, early recognition of index cases in the hospital, and audits for infection control compliance. the details of the infection control program were established as listed in Table 1. the infection control program required all HCWs to record their daily body temperature in an online reporting system. the temperature record was logged online once daily (at approximately 8 AM) the temperature record was logged online once daily. a standard and transmission-based precaution protocol was established before the outbreak. any HCW who developed ILI should report to the infection control team within 24 hours. afebrile HCWs suspected of having H1N1 infection were also required to report to the infection control team within 24 hours. online training was held twice before the outbreak of H1N1 influenza in the community. the rate of HCWs who attended each online training session was 91.8% in May and 97.3% in July. each person required at least 1 hour to complete each session. tract infection caused by viruses other than influenza, 8 had lower respiratory tract infection caused by bacteria, 7 had urinary tract infection, and 3 had cellulitis. the number of patients with ILI who visited our hospital for treatment peaked in early September and declined significantly after a national vaccination program was initiated. the attack rate among different HCW groups was significantly different (p = 0.027) the attack rate was highest among nurses (1.5%), followed by physicians (14.9%), other clinical HCWs (0.7%), and administrative and ancillary workers (0.4%). cough (90.5%), fever exceeding 38\u00b0C (72.5%), rhinorrhea (68.2%), sore throat (56.7%) and muscle aches (21.6%) were the most frequently reported symptoms among HCWs with H1N1 influenza infection. online training was held twice before the outbreak of H1N1 influenza in the community. the rate of HCWs who attended each online training session was 91.8% in May and 97.3% in July. each person required at least 1 hour to complete each session. the number of patients with ILI who visited our hospital for treatment peaked in early September. 51 HCWs (1.0%) were confirmed to have H1N1 infection. unspecified contact infections (37/51) were the most frequently reported infection/exposure routes. Variables Clinical HCWs (%)N = 47 Nonclinical HCWs (%)N = 4 Age groups (years) 30 18 (38.3) 1 (25.0) 31\u201340 22 (46.8) 2 (50.0) 41\u201349 7 (14.9) 1 (25.0) Gender Male 6 (12.8) 2 (50.0) Female 41 (87.2) 2 (50.0) Exposure Patient contact 7 (14.9) 0 (0) Household contact 7 (14.9) 0 (0) Unspecified contact 33 (70.2) cough (90.5%), fever exceeding 38\u00b0C (72.5%), rhinorrhea (68.2%), sore throat (56.7%) and muscle aches (21.6%) were the most frequently reported symptoms among HCWs with H1N1 influenza infection. the infection control program in this study was observed to have a low attack rate of confirmed H1N1 cases. infection control is the most important strategy for control of H1N1 influenza transmission in a hospital before the availability of H1N1 influenza vaccination. emergency rooms and pandemic (H1N1) isolation wards have been reported to be places with the highest risk. wards experienced the highest attack rate, probably because the HCWs in those wards had less stringent protection measures than other HCWs did. the rate of influenza vaccination in HCWs was 95.5% in the study hospital. this high rate of vaccination exceeded the target rate (80%) recommended by CDC [19], partly contributed to the low rate of H1N1 infection in HCWs."}
