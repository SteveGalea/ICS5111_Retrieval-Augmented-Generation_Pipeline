{"summary": "PHLS and the AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PHLs are a critical component of the public health system. they are helping to identify and track communicable diseases, prepare and respond to terrorist attacks, monitor environmental health hazards, and track food safety. despite substantial efforts to prepare for new Ebola cases, PHLs face significant budget, workforce, and other challenges. the Affordable Care Act requires all health insurance plans sold in the individual and small group markets, inside or outside the new state-level Exchanges Marketplaces, as well as Medicaid coverage for the newly eligible expansion population, to cover certain \u201cessential health benefits.\u201d8,9 Essential health benefits consist of 10 distinct benefit classes, including laboratory services. the expansion of health insurance and preventive service coverage under the Affordable Care Act raises two important sustainability concerns for PHLs. one problem relates to the fact that many PHLs historically have been supported through direct financing and may lack the capacity to bill insurers for services because of software and/or staffing limitations. private laboratories focus on individual patient care and are not legally or programmatically structured to safeguard the health of entire communities. they are susceptible to market forces and cost-containment pressures that may disincentivize the need to maintain readiness with adequate equipment. a second step is to ensure that all PHLs are capable of billing insurers for covered services. states might consider incentivizing inclusion in various health insurance markets. the centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) could give higher star ratings to Medicare Advantage plans that include PHLs. if direct financing of clinical laboratory services disappears, PHLs will struggle to maintain essential funding and capacity. policy makers can preserve this core public health function through a combination of transformation incentives, base funding for core and uninsurable activities."}
