{"summary": "the study investigated field cases of fulminating disease among 5 flocks of guinea fowl in 2010 and 2011. most birds showed marked congestive enteritis and a whitish, enlarged pancreas. guinea fowl poults were housed in 2 poultry isolators. the pellets were treated with RNase (Ambion, 20 g/mL) and DNase (Invitrogen, 10 U/L) to concentrate the viral material. RNA and DNA were extracted separately, and a random reverse transcription PCR was performed. a total of 476,430 sequences were generated (Table 1), 10.8% of which matched with known viral sequences. guinea fowl fulminating enteritis virus corresponds to a distinct genotype of CoV, clustering within Gammacoronavirus genus. the complete S gene sequence of GFCoV (GFCoV) was most similar to those of North American TCoV than to those of European (French) TCoV strains. coronavirus in experimentally and naturally infected guinea fowl poults detected by reverse transcription PCR, France, 2010\u20132011. data are no. of coronavirus PCR\u2013positive birds/total no. of birds. NT, not tested. only a partial S gene sequence (1,657 nt) was available for quail CoV/Italy/Elvia/2005. coVs are positive-sense RNA viruses that are subject to frequent mutations and recombination events. a few cases of guinea fowl fulminating disease are diagnosed each year in france but have no apparent epidemiologic link to each other. the severity of the disease in the field may suggest a poor adaptation of the pathogen to guinea fowl."}
