{"summary": "foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an economically important disease of domestic and wild cloven-hoof animals including cattle, swine, goat, sheep and buffalo. it can result in great reduction of productivity in adult animals and death in young animals. in 2001, the outbreak of FMD in England brought a loss of 8 billion dollars [1], and the consequent occurrence in Holland killed 0.2 million animals [2]. the 1997 outbreak in Taiwan brought a loss of about 3.6 billion dollars to its exports. at present, vaccination is a major means of FMD control in most endemic areas. the silkworm-baculovirus expression system was employed for expression of intact P1-2A, 3C coding regions of FMDV Asia I/HNK/CHA/05. all five cattle that were vaccinated with diluted expression antigen were induced specific antibody. PD50 (50% bovine protective dose) value of the subunit vaccine was 6.34 in bovine potency test. the plaque of recombinant virus expressed at maximum activity was selected to purify. the pure recombinant virus from the last round was used as stock virus. expression of polyprotein in Bm-N cells was analyzed by IFAT and sandwich-ELISA. expression yield was about 100 fold (positive antigen: 1/32,0.964; expressed antigen in haemolymph: 1/4096, 0.995) more than positive control. expression yield was about 100 fold (positive antigen: 1/32,0.964; expressed antigen in haemolymph: 1/4096, 0.995) but not detectable in negative control. LPBE-antibody titer was determined at 7, 14, 21 and 28 dpv. all five cattle vaccinated with Bm-P12A3C antigen developed a detectable FMDV-antibody response at 7 dpv. by 21and 28 dpv, the antibody level was maintained at the same level or higher. animal #Vaccinea neutralizing antibodyb dpvc number 7 7 14 21 28 33 Bm-P12A3C 8 16 64 90 90 124 Bm-P12A3C 8 8 64 64 64 122 Bm-P12A3C 8 8 32 32 32 45 Bm-P12A3C 8 8 32 32 50 Bm-P12A3C 8 8 64 90 90 2 BmBacPAK-6 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 vesicles developed in the control animals by 2 dpc at the sites of all feet and mouth. this indicated that antigen produced in silkworm could be effectively protective. animals were challenged with 10,000 BID50 of Asia I/HNK/CHA/05. total of 10,000 BID50 of Asia I/HNK/CHA/05 intradermally into two sites on the upper surface of the tongue. Vaccinated animals are protected if they do not develop lesions on the feet. recombinant virus Bm-P12A3C was used to express FMDV protein in cells or silkworm. expression of polyprotein in Bm-N cells was analyzed by IFAT and sandwich-ELISA. expression of FMDV polypeptides in silkworm larvae was estimated by sandwich-ELISA. haemolymph from 10 silkworms was harvested every 12 h beginning at 60 hpi and stored at 20\u00b0C. the haemolymph was diluted to 1000 folds for detection of expression products. animal Vaccinea LPBE-antibodyb dpvc number 7 7 14 21 28 33 Bm-P12A3C 8 32 180 360 360 124 Bm-P12A3C 8 20 90 90 90 122 Bm-P12A3C 8 20 45 45 45 45 45 Bm-P12A3C 8 20 90 90 90 50 Bm-P12A3C 8 45 360 360 2 BmBacPAK-6 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 animal #Vaccinea neutralizing antibodyb dpvc number 7 7 14 21 28 33 Bm-P12A3C 8 16 64 90 90 124 Bm-P12A3C 8 8 64 64 64 122 Bm-P12A3C 8 8 32 32 32 45 Bm-P12A3C 8 8 32 32 50 Bm-P12A3C 8 8 64 90 90 2 BmBacPAK-6 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 animal number # vaccine Days of onset of pyrexia Duration of Pyrexia(days) Protectionc 33 Bm-P12A3C - - - + 124 Bm-P12A3C - - - + 45 Bm-P12A3C Day 6 2 2 - 50 Bm-P12A3C - - - + 2 BmBacPAK-6 Day 2 3 4+mouth. seven distinct serotypes of FMDV have been identified, named A, O, C, Asia I, SAT I, SAT and SAT. none cross immune protection occurring between them. the FMDV serotype Asia is epidemic within Southeast Asia and Indian peninsula. expression cassette of adenovirus expression system can be assembled into capsids. it can express with very high efficiency in the hyperexpression variety of silkworm. the specific antigen produced per milliliter in silkworm haemolymph at least 100 folds more than the BHK-21 cell vaccine. vaccinated cattle developed lesions on all the feet and in the inside of mouth. animal 45 has the same neutralizing antibody titers as 122 but is not protected. the subunit vaccine potency could get 6.34 PD50 a dose for cattle. the baculoviral transfer plasmid pVL-P12A3C was co-transfected with linearized Bm-BacPAK6 DNA into Bm-N cells by liposome-mediated method. the co-transfection supernatant was subject to plaque assays to screen individual viral plaques. expression of FMDV polyprotein in Bm-N cells infected with Bm-P12A3C was analyzed by immunofluorescence test (IFAT) and sandwich-ELISA. the recombinant virus was used to generate high titer viral stocks for expression. lysates of Bm-N cells with Bm-P12A3C and BmBacPAK-6 infected were diluted in a two-fold series and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1h. guinea pig sera against FMDV was added to each well. substrate (0.05% H2O2 plus orthophenylene diamine) was added. candidates with a potency lower than 8 were housed in disease-secure isolation facilities. five cattle were vaccinated with 3ml/animal of vaccine with Bm-P12A3C's. two control cattle were vaccinated with the same dose of vaccine with BmBacPAK-6's. the restrained animals were carefully examined in the mouth, and feet every day for the first 10 days after challenge. all animals were challenged 3 weeks after vaccination with 10,000 BID50 of Asia I/HNK/CHA/05 to the vaccine. cDNA synthesis was performed with superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) PCR was used to amplify the Intact P1-2A and 3C protease coding regions from the cDNA using two pairs of specific primer. the target fragments of P1-2A and 3C were inserted into baculoviral transfer vector pVL1393. expression of FMDV polyprotein in Bm-N cells was analyzed by immunofluorescence test (IFAT) and sandwich-ELISA. Bm-N cells (2.0105) were cultured on cover slips and inoculated at a MOI of 10 pfu with Bm-P12A3C. the supernatant was tested using the sandwich-ELISA method. 96-well plat-bottomed plates were coated with the rabbit serum against FMDV overnight at 4\u00b0C. lysates of Bm-N cells with Bm-P12A3C and BmBacPAK-6 infected were diluted in a two-fold series. candidates with a potency lower than 8 were housed in disease-secure isolation facilities in Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute. five cattle (6\u20138 months old) were immunized by intramuscular inoculation at the site in the neck. all animals were challenged by intradermal inoculation at two sites in the tongue with 10,000 bovine infectious doses (BID50) of Asia I/HNK/CHA/05 at 28 dpv. the body temperature of the animals was monitored daily for the first 10 days after challenge."}
