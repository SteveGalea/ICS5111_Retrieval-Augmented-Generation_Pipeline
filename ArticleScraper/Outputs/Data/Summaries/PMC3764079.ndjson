{"summary": "the human health concern was identified as environmentally derived antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) that may adversely affect human health. these processes generate either environmental antibiotic-resistant bacteria (eARB) or pathogens with antibiotic-resistance (pARB) an antimicrobial-resistant microorganism has the ability to multiply or persist in the presence of an increased level of an antimicrobial agent compared with a susceptible counterpart of the same species. a vast amount of work has been undertaken to understand the contribution that the environment has on the development of resistance in both human and animal pathogens. antibiotic-resistance genes (ARG) between indigenous bacteria and their resistance determinants has yet to be quantified, but is of global concern. genetic elements encoding for the ability of microorganisms to withstand the effects of an antimicrobial agent are located either chromosomally or extrachromosomally. resistance genes can be present due to natural occurrence. sewage treatment has emphasized the need to better understand the environmental mechanisms of genetic selection and gene acquisition as well as the dynamics of resistance genes (resistome) and their bacterial hosts. sewage treatment has emphasized the need to better understand the environmental mechanisms of genetic selection and gene acquisition as well as the dynamics of resistance genes (resistome) a rare event that results in the transfer of a novel (to clinically important bacteria) resistance gene from a harmless environmental bacterium to a pathogen need happen only once if a human is the recipient of the novel pARB. the conditions for a \u201cone-time event\u201d could occur in a range of \u201cnormal\u201d habitats. assessment depends on the context (e.g., research, regulation), we provide a generic approach to undertaking an HHRA of environmental ARB that can be adapted to the users\u2019 interest. the codex Alimentarius Commission (2011) described eight principles that are specific to risk analysis for foodborne antimicrobial resistance. local surveillance data on the occurrence and types of antibiotics used in human medicine, crop production, animal husbandry, and companion animals; b) related disease information. this assessment should be amended by discussion with the relevant stakeholders. the key issue is how experimental approaches can be used to derive estimates. a robust quantitative risk assessment will require rates of HGT and/or gene mutations in the relevant compartments. the lack of quantitative estimates for mutation/HGT of ARG is a major data gap. traditional microbial risk assessment dose\u2013response approaches could be used to address the likelihood of infection. human, laboratory, and/or field animal/crop trials addressing the link between antibiotic use and resistance. studies on the link between resistance, virulence, and/or ecological fitness of ARB Studies on the environmental fate of antibiotic residues in water and soil and their bioavailability associated with the selection of ARB. microbial risk assessment (MRA) is a structured, systematic, science-based approach that builds on the chemical risk assessment paradigm. an MRA is used qualitatively or quantitatively to evaluate the level of exposure and subsequent risk to human health from microbiological hazards. it is needed to address resistant bacteria and/or their determinants. human health risk assessments dealing with ARB transmission via various environmental routes or direct contact with ARG are sparse. geenen et al. (2010) studied extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria. authors concluded an environmental risk assessment would be helpful in addressing the problem of ESBL-producing bacteria. selection for ARB depends on the type and in situ bioavailability of selecting/coselecting agents, the abundance of bacterial host, and the abundance of AR determinants. integrase expression can be up-regulated (increased) by the integrase expression by the integrase expression. quantitative data that describe the development of pARB in the environment are lacking. ample evidence exists for the co-uptake by an antibiotic-sensitive pathogen in the presence of an antibiotic, ARG (such as on a plasmid with metal resistance), and/or carbon utilization genes. the spatial distribution of organisms may also affect gene transfer. there are several pathogens that could be evaluated in microbial risk assessments. a) foodborne and waterborne fecal pathogens represented by Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica, or various pathogenic E. coli. b) environmental pathogens, such as respiratory, skin, or wound pathogens represented by Legionella pneumophila, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa the exact mechanisms and dose\u2013response relationships have yet to be elucidated. it seems reasonable for the noncompromised human exposed to a pARB to fit the published dose\u2013response/infection relationship. pARB is more pathogenic or causing more severe illness than their antimicrobial-susceptible equivalents. the final step of MRA is risk characterization, which integrates the outputs from the hazard identification, the hazard characterization, dose response, and the exposure assessment. this estimate may be expressed in various measures of risk, for example, in terms of individual or population risk, or an estimate of annual risk based on exposure to specific hazard(s) fate and transport models are available to estimate the amounts of antibiotics, pathogens, ARB, and ARG at points of human contact. a key aspect of the fate and transport models is the ability to account for the inherent variability of any system component. more recent models are including Bayesian learning algorithms that help to integrate information using meteorologic, hydrologic, and microbial explanatory variables. MCDA and Risk Ranking Methods Considering the complexity of exposure pathways associated with environmental ARB risks, outputs would inevitably be difficult to interpret and could in fact be counterproductive. there is merit in considering decision analysis approaches to prioritize risks, guide resource allocation and data collection activities, and facilitate decision making. MCDA could be applied to evaluate the relative contribution of coselecting agents from various sources to the overall risk of ARB in the environment. MCDA approaches could be used for risk ranking according to criteria based on relevant contributing factors (e.g., mobility of resistance determinants in genetic elements, antibiotic-resistance transfer rates in different environmental compartments, environmental fate and transport to exposure points) assays could be developed and validated in sandy and clay soils, different sediments, and water types. selection at subinhibitory concentrations and assay development are key areas of research that need to be addressed. however, overall care is needed when interpreting ex situ studies and extrapolating to in situ environmental conditions. screening procedures could be introduced early in the development cycle of novel antibiotics to ensure that existing resistance determinants are not prevalent in environmental compartments. marked recipient strains could be inoculated into environmental matrices, incubated, and seeded onto media containing the study compound. functional metagenomics could be used to identify novel resistance determinants in metagenomic DNA. there is also a need to develop dose\u2013response information for secondary illness end points (sequelae) resulting from pARB infections. safety could be based on the effective concentration for the specific antibiotic under consideration. epidemiological data from existing clones of antibiotic-resistant strains could provide useful data for dose\u2013response and exposure assessments. an alternative approach to capturing knowledge of experts and other stakeholders could be to develop a Bayesian network based on expert knowledge. this would require data on the prevalence of ARG, as well as levels of antibiotics present in all exposure routes to be considered in the risk assessment. which control points may be most effective in reducing risks. which risk-driving attributes should be specifically considered and minimized."}
