{"summary": "diagnostic tests are a fundamental component of a successful outbreak containment strategy. development of diagnostic tests suitable for epidemic prevention and containment is technically challenging. many tests are not available in a format that can be deployed at a community level. d in international focus and funding, which has enabled development and introduction of critical diagnostics. additional work is needed to improve current diagnostics, develop POC tests and ensure reliable availability. improvements in availability of point-of-care diagnostics and a more rapid set up of laboratory facilities in transmission zones limited the spread of the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 13 logistical issues with delivery of supplies and shortages of experienced staff persisted. poor commercial viability of diagnostics during non-outbreak periods Provide market incentives for manufacturers and establish sustainable business models to offset losses during non-outbreak years. limited access to samples leading to further delays in diagnostic development Establish a specimen sample bank open to both the diagnostics and vaccines industries. reagent shortage continued throughout 2016 and the first 8 months of 2017. improved access to rapid tests to speed up diagnosis of patients presenting to triage tents was badly needed. lack of affordable and definitive diagnostics described as one of today\u2019s most serious health security blind spots7. diagnostics that require limited sample preparation would reduce training needs and minimise the risk to laboratory workers. the delay between the index case and the identification of Ebola as the causative agent during the 2013\u20132016 epidemic was partly due to a lack of appropriate high-level containment facilities. funding for development of critical pathogen-specific assays that can be employed in a decentralised setting is essential to address the current gap in diagnostic epidemic and pandemic preparedness. commercial viability of diagnostics during non-outbreak periods is another important issue that needs to be addressed. a lack of market incentives discourages companies from continuing development and commercialisation. a lack of market incentives as outbreaks decline discourages companies from continuing development and commercialisation. a shared system open to both diagnostics and vaccines industries would ensure optimum efficiency. a shared system open to both diagnostics and vaccines industries would ensure optimum efficiency. a shared system open to both diagnostics and vaccines industries would ensure optimum efficiency. the rk39 ELISA test for detection of visceral leishmaniasis was developed by the Infectious Disease Research Institute in Seattle as a by-product of their vaccine research. improvements in the sharing of diagnostic data would greatly improve the diagnostic response to outbreaks. the recent yellow fever and Zika outbreaks underscore the impact of interruptions in supply on time to containment. it will be important to ensure sufficient manufacturing capacity for diagnostic tests is in place. additional investment in manufacturing will be essential to allow urgent demands to be met without negative impact on other business commitments. strengthening of the diagnostic capacity of laboratories at national levels is important for any preparedness strategy. the disconnect between surveillance findings and provision of vaccines negatively impacted the containment response to the yellow fever outbreak. linking diagnostics and vaccines in a common health programme would help ensure that vaccines are delivered in a timely manner to the most at-risk populations. reagent shortage continued throughout 2016 and the first 8 months of 2017. improved access to rapid tests to speed up diagnosis of patients presenting to triage tents was badly needed. lack of affordable and definitive diagnostics described as one of today\u2019s most serious health security blind spots7. funding for development of critical pathogen-specific assays is essential to address current gap in diagnostic epidemic and pandemic preparedness. funding must be sufficient, and its allocation must be strategic and coordinated. of these 70 companies, few were capable of success. the commercial viability of diagnostics during non-outbreak periods is another important issue that needs to be addressed. a lack of market incentives as outbreaks decline discourages companies from continuing development and commercialisation. innovative financing solutions, including pooled procurement mechanisms and funding for stockpiling of tests, must be put in place to establish a sustainable supply chain. a shared system open to both diagnostics and vaccines industries would ensure optimum efficiency. a shared system open to both diagnostics and vaccines industries would ensure optimum efficiency. an example of an effective sample sharing initiative is the pandemic influenza preparedness framework. improvements in the sharing of diagnostic data would greatly improve the diagnostic response to outbreaks. delays in sharing of diagnostic data affected containment times. some improvements were seen during the Zika outbreak. the recent yellow fever and Zika outbreaks clearly demonstrate the negative impact of poor surveillance. the absence of a specific marker for Zika surveillance was largely responsible for the wide spread of the disease. the absence of a specific marker for surveillance was largely responsible for the wide spread of the disease. a \u2018One Health\u2019 approach to surveillance would provide earlier opportunities for outbreak detection and prevention. but a number of challenges to implementing such an approach exist, including need for greater cross-sectoral communication, strengthening of laboratory networks, and development of shared databases. the first step may be the assembly of the multiple key stakeholders in this field to convene a global diagnostics forum. CEPI could act as a bridge between diagnostics needs and vaccine preparedness for research and development. Gavi is already exploring how to best use its resources to enable more effective vaccine campaigns for yellow fever outbreaks through support of diagnostics. diagnostics into existing preparedness systems and overall strengthening of healthcare system diagnostic capacity will lead to more rapid containment of future outbreaks."}
