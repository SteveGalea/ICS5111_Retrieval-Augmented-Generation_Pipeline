MERS-CoV belongs to lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus (CoV) in the family Coronaviridae under the order Nidovirales. the only known lineage C CoVs were two bat CoVs that are closely related to MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV is the first lineage C CoV and the sixth CoV known to cause human infection. it was designated a novel lineage C CoV based on the international committee on taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) criteria for CoV species identification using rooted phylogeny. ucleocapsid)-poly(A)-3\u2032 is similar to that of other CoVs. many of these genes and their encoded proteins are useful diagnostic, therapeutic, or vaccination targets. many of these genes are useful diagnostic, therapeutic, or vaccination targets. the other canonical structural proteins, namely, the E, M, and N proteins, are encoded by ORF6, -7, and -8, respectively, and are involved in the assembly of the virion. the other canonical structural proteins, including the papain-like protease and accessory proteins 4a, 4b, and 5, exhibit in vitro interferon antagonist activities that may modulate in vivo replication efficiency and pathogenesis.

Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against the RBD potently inhibit virus entry into host cells and receptor-dependent syncytium formation in cell culture. vaccines containing the RBD induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies in mice and rabbits. the key functional receptor of the host cell attached to by the MERS-CoV S protein is dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) it is also known as adenosine deaminase-complexing protein 2 or CD26 (46) it is abundantly expressed on the epithelial and endothelial cells of most organs. adenosine deaminase is a natural competitive antagonist. some anti-DPP4 monoclonal antibodies exhibit inhibitory effects on in vitro MERS-CoV infection. the energetically unfavorable membrane fusion reaction in endosomal cell entry is overcome by low pH and pH-dependent endosomal cysteine protease cathepsins. furin and furin-like proprotein convertases are broadly expressed serine endoproteases that cleave the multibasic motifs RX(R/K/X)R and process proproteins into their biologically active forms (55). furin cleaves the S1/S2 site during S protein biosynthesis and the S2\u2032 site during virus entry into host cells (54). the viral papain-like protease and 3C-like protease cotranslationally cleave the large replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab into nsp1 to nsp16 (16, 59, 60) these nsps form the replication-transcription complex, where transcription of the full-length positive genomic RNA yields a full-length negative-strand template for synthesis of new genomic RNAs. the world health organization (WHO) reported two cases of acute respiratory syndrome with renal failure associated with a novel CoV in two patients from the Middle East. the viral strains shared 99.5% nucleotide identity with each other, with only one nucleotide mismatch in partial replicase gene sequencing. sporadic cases were increasingly detected in the Middle East over the subsequent 6 months. a 49-year-old man was transferred from doha, Qatar, to an ICU in London, UK, on 11 September 2012 for severe community-acquired pneumonia. a novel CoV was detected in combined nose and throat swab, sputum, and tracheal aspirate samples. the replicase gene fragment shared 99.5% identity with the first HCoV-EMC strain. WHO first interim recommendations for laboratory testing for HCoV-EMC issued. a 60-year-old man with recent travel history to KSA was admitted to an ICU for laboratory-confirmed HCoV-EMC. two of his relatives who were close contacts also developed laboratory-confirmed MERS. CDC first report on the detection of a MERS-CoV-like virus (Neoromicia coronavirus) with 85.6% nt identity (complete genome) in the fecal sample of a fecal pellet of a Taphozous perforatus bat in KSA.

reported a total of 1,030 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS, including 381 deaths. 63.5% of the patients were male and the median age was 47 years. the persistence of the epidemic is postulated to be related to repeated animal-to-human transmissions from at least one type of animal reservoir that is in frequent contact with residents in the region. all primary MERS cases were epidemiologically linked to the Middle East, and all secondary cases in other countries were linked to primary cases imported from the Middle East. in a clinical cohort from KSA with 47 severe cases requiring hospitalization, the patients' median age was 56 years. about 96% of the patients had comorbidities, with the most common being diabetes mellitus (68%), chronic renal disease (49%), hypertension (34%), chronic cardiac disease (28%), chronic pulmonary disease (26%). smoking and obesity were reported in 23% and 17% of the patients, respectively. 88 311 86, 152, 334, 335 Time period April 2012

of past infection among the general population in the Middle East. serum neutralizing anti-MERS-CoV antibodies were not detected in archived serum samples of 2,400 control in- or outpatients without MERS in KSA. age C CoVs, Ty-BatCoV-HKU4 and Pi-BatCoV-HKU5 suggested the possibility of MERS-CoV being a zoonotic agent. these findings concur with the existing notion that bats are the likely gene sources of most CoVs and CoVs, including SARS-CoV (1, 15, 102\u2013107) the most recent common ancestor between NeoCoV and human MERS-CoV strains was proposed to exist in bats more than 44 years ago (112) the likelihood of MERS-CoV originating from both T. perforatus and vespertilionid bats is low (20, 110, 111) ilionoidea, family Vespertilionidae Asia Tylonycteris pachypus (Ty-BatCoV HKU4) China

to October 2005 Serum NAb: 9/11 (81.8%) total genome (MERS-CoV camel/Qatar_2_2014) shared 99.5% to 99.9% nt identities with other camel and patient strains. all 33 camels had IgG in serum and milk. 122 Egypt (Alexandra, Cairo, and Nile Delta region)/June to December 2013 Serum NAb: 48/52 (92.3% with titers between 1:20 and 1:640); 0/179 abattoir workers. intermediate animal hosts such as civets and raccoon dogs might also have been important in the transmission of SARS. the host range is determined mainly by the binding of the MERS-CoV S protein to the host receptor DPP4 which is relatively conserved among mammalian species. the first in vivo evidence to support the presence of an intermediate animal reservoir of MERS-CoV emerged when high titers of serum neutralizing IgG against the MERS-CoV S1 RBD were detected in dromedary camels (121). all 50 Omani dromedary camels were ser the percent seropositivity of neutralizing anti-MERS-CoV antibodies was much lower in juvenile than in adult dromedary camels. it was also shown that acutely infected juvenile dromedary camels without neutralizing antibodies might be a more important source for transmission to humans. host cell factors

Human bronchus and lung Productive replication in both human and lung ex vivo organ cultures. virions were found within the cytoplasm of bronchial epithelium, bronchiolar epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, and endothelial cells. budding virions were found in alveolar epithelial cells (type II) the significance of camels as the major source of animal-to-human transmission required further virological studies on the pattern of viral shedding in camels. an investigation of a disease outbreak in dromedary camels in Qatar demonstrated MERS-CoV in nasal swabs, but not rectal swabs or fecal samples. rate of detection of MERS-CoV RNA in the nasal and/or rectal swabs of juvenile camels was higher than in adult camels (135, 136). this may partially explain the absence of serum neutralizing anti-MERS-CoV antibodies among camel abattoir workers, who have contacted predominantly adult camels. infected camels transmitted the virus to nonimmune humans. the genomes of both the camel and human strains of MERS-CoV contained nucleotide polymorphism signature. the genomes of both the camel and human strains of MERS-CoV contained unique nucleotide polymorphism signature. a number of important questions remain unresolved at this stage. it is uncertain whether camels are intermediate amplification hosts or the natural reservoirs of MERS-CoV. the route of transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans remains unknown at this stage. a significant proportion of laboratory-confirmed human cases did not have a clear history of contact with camels (83, 142) genomes of human and animal strains of MERS-CoV were identified early in the epidemic from June 2012 to September 2013. the evolutionary rate of the coding regions of the viral genome to be 1.12 103 (95% confidence interval, 8.76 104 to 1.37 103) substitutions per site per year (146) the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA of MERS-CoV) was estimated to be March 2012 (95% confidence interval, December 2011 to June 2012) genomic analysis also supports the hypothesis that MERS-CoV is transmitted from animal to human and from person to person. at least four clades of MERS-CoV were identified in a family cluster in Riyadh, KSA, in October 2012. two phylogenetically distinct MERS-CoV strains were detected in a family cluster in a family cluster in the region of the epidemic. three real-time predictions of the spread of MERS-CoV have been conducted for the current epidemic. the estimated daily rate of MERS-CoV introductions into the human population in the Middle East is 0.12 to 0.85. the expected yearly incidence of MERS-CoV was estimated to be between 160 and 320 cases per year (90, 150) laboratory-confirmed cases were only less than one-tenth of those reported by the WHO as of 26 February 2015 (90, 150, 151) this low number limited the accuracy of the predictions, as a sufficient caseload is required to calculate the basic parameters for estimation of the worst- and best-case scenarios to gauge the magnitude of the epidemic. most of the cases reported in the early period of the epidemic were biased toward including more severe cases. about 96% of the patients had comorbidities, with the most common being diabetes mellitus (68%), chronic renal disease (49%), hypertension (34%), chronic cardiac disease (28%), and chronic pulmonary disease (26%). smoking and obesity were reported in 23% and 17% of the patients, respectively. fatal (86.8%) > nonfatal (42.4%) cases NA 45/47 (95.7); 28/45 (62.2) fatal NA 12/12 (100) NA 57/70 (81.4) Fatal (40/55;

anti-MERS-CoV antibodies were not detected among 158 children hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infections. recent reports also show a high ratio of nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) nucleotide substitutions per site in the bat DPP4-encoding genes. this adaptive evolution in the bat DPP4 is suggestive of long-term interactions between bats and MERS-CoV-related viruses. NeoCoV and human MERS-CoV strains were proposed to exist in bats more than 44 years ago (112) the likelihood of MERS-CoV originating from both T. perforatus (superfamily Emballonuroidea) and vespertilionid bats is low (20, 110, 111) abramus (Pi-BatCoV HKU5) China (Hong Kong)/April 2005 to August 2012 Detected in 55/216 (25.5%) alimentary samples; shared 92.3% (RdRp), 64.5% (S), and 70.5% (N) aa identities with MERS-CoV (HCoV-EMC/2012). 312 Africa Neoromicia capensis (NeoCoV) South Africa (KwaZulu-N Pipistrellus kuhlii, Hypsugo savii, Nyctalus noctula, and an unknown Pipistrellus sp.

viral load (3\u20134) the significance of camels as the major source of animal-to-human transmission required further virological studies on the pattern of viral shedding in camels. an investigation of a disease outbreak in dromedary camels in Qatar demonstrated MERS-CoV in nasal swabs, but not rectal swabs or fecal samples. infected adult camels may still be a source of human infection. shedding could be observed in camels with preexisting serum antibodies. the majority of amino acid residues critical for receptor binding are identical between most human and camel strains. the strongest evidence of direct cross-species transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans was provided in a study reporting the isolation of the virus from a dromedary camel. serological tests showed seropositivity in the camels but not in the patient before the human infection occurred. the air sample collected from the camel barn on the same day when a sick camel tested positive for MERS-CoV, but not on the subsequent 2 days, was also positive for M a number of important questions remain unresolved at this stage. first, it is uncertain whether camels are intermediate amplification hosts. the detection of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in archived sera of camels dating back to more than 28 years ago in eastern africa. the route of transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans remains unknown. direct contact with other bodily fluids, including blood and feces, is also possible. shedding in nasal secretions is usually short-lasting during acute infection. but viral shedding in these samples is also possible during acute infection. the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of MERS-CoV was estimated to be March 2012 (95% confidence interval, December 2011 to June 2012) the genomes of the MERS-CoV strains obtained from patients diagnosed between October 2012 and June 2013 showed various nucleotide changes in the last third of the genomes. codon 1020 at the HR1 domain of the S gene was identified to be under weaker positive selection. two phylogenetically distinct MERS-CoV strains were detected in a family cluster in Riyadh, KSA, in October 2012. the genomic diversity of MERS-CoV detected in patients from the same locality suggests the presence of multiple mobile infection sources such as animal reservoirs, infected animal products and/or infected patients. three real-time predictions of the spread of MERS-CoV have been conducted for the current epidemic. they have estimated the basic reproduction number (R0), the number of secondary cases per index case in a fully susceptible population, to be 0.30 to 0.77 (150), 0.60 to 0.69 (90), or 0.8 to 1.3 (151), compared to about 0.8 for preepidemic SARS-CoV. asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases identified through enhanced surveillance programs may further underestimate the R0 (90) a more recent study that included 700 cases of MERS showed that the R0 was much higher at 2.0 to 6.7 in large health care-associated outbreaks in KSA in spring 2014. 152, 157, 320 Time period April 2012 1 September 2012 to 15 June 2013 1 March 2013 to 19 April 2013 to 3 June 2013 May 2013 to August 2013 1

Acinetobacter baumannii, CT, computerized tomography scan; CXR, chest radiograph; DIC, disseminated intravascular coagulation; ICU, intensive care unit; INR, international normalized ratio. most common thoracic computerized tomography (CT) scan features are bilateral, predominantly basilar, and subpleural airspace involvement. tree-in-bud pattern, cavitation, and lymph node enlargement have not been reported. different changes in thoracic CT scan throughout the course of disease are suggestive of organizing pneumonia. patients infected with SARS-CoV may have enteric symptoms in addition to respiratory tract involvement. symptoms were found in more than a quarter of hospitalized cases in a large cohort in KSA (63) patients with MERS-CoV may have enteric symptoms. median time from symptom onset to invasive ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in these patients is 4.5 to 7 days, which is at least 6 days earlier than that for SARS (63, 66, 75, 88, 162) the duration of stay in the intensive care unit is often prolonged, with a median of 30 days (range, 7 to 104 days) most of these patients are young, healthy female health care workers or children who do not have any comorbidities postmortem examination was rarely performed in patients who died of MERS. no postmortem findings have been reported so far. the current understanding on the histopathology and pathogenesis of MERS is limited. common marmosets infected with MERS-CoV showed similar but more severe histological findings. in necropsied lungs of common marmosets euthanized on day 3 to 4 postinfection, extensive transcriptional evidence of pulmonary fibrosis was present. rhesus macaques immunosuppressed using cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone with depleted T and B cells. accessory proteins 3b and 6 are the major putative interferon antagonists of SARS-CoV. the papain-like protease encoded by nsp3 of ORF1a/b, M protein encoded by ORF7, and accessory proteins 4a, 4b, and 5 encoded by ORF4a, -4b, and -5, respectively, of MERS-CoV antagonize interferons in vitro. innate immune response is more severe in knockout mice with impaired type I interferon or toll-like receptor signaling than in those with impaired RIG-I-like receptor signaling. the depletion of natural killer cells, a major cellular component of the innate immune response, does not significantly affect the clinical disease severity or viral clearance kinetics (173) this was associated with a major decrease in the amount of mRNA and protein of interferon alpha in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. the antigen presentation pathway was broadly downregulated and affected type I and II major histocompatibility genes. increased levels of IL-17A and IL-23 within the first week after symptom onset were noted in fatal MERS cases. serum neutralizing antibodies are detected on as early as day 7 postinfection, reaching a peak titer on day 14 postinfection and decreasing slightly in titer on day 28 postinfection. both IgM and IgG against S and N proteins are detectable in the sera of infected patients on day 16 after symptom onset. the initial IgM antibody response is likely mounted before this time period (72) in vitro observation that MERS-CoV replicates more efficiently in a variety of lower respiratory tract cell lines than in upper respiratory tract cell lines. inability of the human bronchial epithelium to mount a timely and adequate innate immune response against MERS-CoV infection may partially explain the high incidence of severe cases in MERS (116, 157, 170, 184\u2013187). pronounced CPE with rounding, detachment, and death occurs only in primary kidney epithelial cells infected with either MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV. the concentration of infectious MERS-CoV progeny in primary kidney epithelial cells was almost 1,000-fold higher than that in primary bronchial epithelial cells (157) vivo culture systems of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells and macrophages confirm that MERS-CoV can infect both of these important professional antigen-presenting cell types. this leads to recruitment and infiltration of a large number of immune cells into the infected lung tissues, as is seen clinically. this leads to recruitment and infiltration of a large number of immune cells into the infected tissues, as is seen clinically. sloughed pulmonary epithelium that occluded small airways, and multifocal perivascular infiltrates of inflammatory cells within and adjacent to the affected areas of lungs were also reported. in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry demonstrated viral RNA and antigen, respectively, in type I and II pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages, and occasionally round mononuclear cells. MERS-CoV is capable of inhibiting recognition, delaying interferon induction, and dampening interferon-stimulated gene expression in polarized human bronchial epithelia (Calu-3) cells. it inhibits interferon-stimulated gene expression in human (HEK-293T) and/or primate kidney (Vero) cells. retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) are key cytosolic recognition receptors of virus-derived RNAs (25) preliminary data show that MERS-CoV, but not SARS-CoV, may employ an additional mechanism to antagonize ISG via altered histone modification. ine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) are associated with chemotaxis and activation of neutrophils. significant differences are noted between the innate immune responses in fatal and nonfatal cases. rhesus macaques infected with MERS-CoV, serum neutralizing antibodies are detected on as early as day 7 postinfection. serum neutralizing antibodies are detected on as early as day 14 postinfection and decreasing slightly in titer on day 28 postinfection. both IgM and IgG against S and N proteins are detectable in the sera of infected patients on day 16 after symptom onset. iter of anti-MERS-CoV-RBD neutralizing antibody response should be further evaluated in subsequent clinical cohorts consisting of patients with different severities and outcomes. the in vitro observation that the viral fitness and evolution may be restricted by the immunodominance of the anti-MERS-CoV-RBD neutralizing antibody response that blocks binding to human DPP4. MERS-CoV replicates efficiently to about 5 logs above the baseline titer. the concentration of infectious MERS-CoV progeny in primary kidney epithelial cells was almost 1,000-fold higher than that in primary bronchial epithelial cells (157). the kidney may be a potential site of autonomous virus replication. MERS-CoV can infect both of these important professional antigen-presenting cell types with high-level and persistent induction of immune cell-recruiting cytokines (190, 192) this leads to recruitment and infiltration of a large number of immune cells into the infected lung tissues. this leads to recruitment and infiltration of a large number of immune cells into the infected tissues. the WHO criteria for a laboratory-confirmed case include either a positive RT-PCR result for at least two different specific targets on the MERS-CoV genome or one positive RT-PCR result for a specific target on the MERS-CoV genome. an additional different RT-PCR product sequenced confirm identity to known sequences of MERS-CoV. assay (ORF1a gene) BAL fluid, NPA Confirmatory for upE-positive samples 4.1

including nasopharyngeal aspirate or swabs and oropharyngeal swabs, are most commonly collected in suspected cases of MERS. clinical specimens from extrapulmonary sites, especially urine, feces, blood, and/or tissues, may occasionally be positive and should also be collected if available. specimens should be sent to the laboratory in viral transport medium as soon as possible after collection or be stored at 80\u00b0C if a delay in transfer is expected. gene targets can be used for RT-PCR as screening and/or confirmatory testing for MERS-CoV. assays targeting the abundant N gene may be more sensitive than those targeting the other genes. however, a 6-nt deletion was found in N gene of the strain from the second laboratory-confirmed patient compared to the one obtained from the first patient. potential false-negative results due to mutations in this region may occur. cases with positive serology should be considered probable only if they meet the other criteria of the case definition. antibody detection assays are important for retrospective diagnosis in clinically and epidemiologically suspicious cases with negative molecular test results. healthy blood donors in southern china 2/94 (2.1%) of animal handlers, 17/28 (60.7%) SARS patients, and 0/152 (0%) of healthy blood donors had cross-reactive anti-MERS-CoV Ab An epitope around the HR2 domain of the S2

sample requirement. s Sera from hospitalized children and male blood donors in KSA None Estimated MERS-CoV seroprevalence in the study area was 2.3% in children during 2010 to 2011 and 3.3% in male adults in 2012 51, 97 Microneutralization assay (neutralizing anti-MERS-CoV Ab) Whole virus Animal handlers, SARS patients, and healthy blood donors in southern china 0/94 (0%), 7/28 (25.0%) of SARS patients. the development of antigen detection assays for MERS-CoV has been reported in histopathological confirmation in infected tissues of animals and in cell cultures with positive CPE (165, 166, 173) similar assays were found to be highly sensitive and specific for the laboratory diagnosis of SARS from sera and nasopharyngeal samples. the first identification of MERS-CoV was achieved by inoculation of the patient's sputum sample in monkey kidney cell lines, including LLC-MK2 and Vero cell lines, for detection of CPE. syncytium formation caused by fusion activity of the MERS-CoV S protein at neutral pH may be observed in LLC-MK2, Calu-3, Caco-2, and Huh-7 cell lines. upper respiratory tract specimens, including nasopharyngeal aspirate or swabs and oropharyngeal swabs, are the most commonly collected specimens in suspected cases of MERS. clinical specimens from extrapulmonary sites, especially urine, feces, blood, and/or tissues, may occasionally be positive. severe cases appear to have more prolonged virus shedding than mild cases (197). continued compliance with infection control measures is required during patient care procedures as a precautionary measure. specimens should be sent to the laboratory in viral transport medium as soon as possible after collection or be stored at 80\u00b0C. the patient had a compatible epidemiological and clinical history. the case is considered to be a probable case of MERS. a 6-nt deletion was found in N gene of the strain from the second patient compared to the one obtained from the first patient. cases with positive serology in absence of PCR testing or sequencing should be considered probable only if they meet the other criteria of the case definition. antibody detection assays are important for retrospective diagnosis in clinically and epidemiologically suspicious cases with negative molecular test results. cross-reactive Ab in IFA No evidence of widespread circulation of MERS-CoV in southern china.

anti-MERS-Co the development of antigen detection assays for MERS-CoV has been reported in histopathological confirmation in infected tissues of animals. similar assays were found to be highly sensitive and specific for the laboratory diagnosis of SARS from sera and nasopharyngeal samples from patients. the first identification of MERS-CoV was achieved by inoculation of the patient's sputum sample in monkey kidney cell lines. syncytium formation caused by fusion activity of the MERS-CoV S protein at neutral pH may be observed in LLC-MK2, Calu-3, Caco-2, and Huh-7 cell lines and Vero cells expressing TMPRSS2. viral agents with proven efficacy in randomized controlled trials are lacking for MERS (203, 204) supportive care remains the mainstay of treatment for severe viral pneumonia. ECMO has been increasingly used in severe viral pneumonia, including some cases of MERS. the improvement in outcome of MERS depends on the development of effective antiviral treatment for suppression of viral load. the first and fastest approach is to test drugs with broad-spectrum antiviral activities, including those with reported activities against other CoVs associated with human infection. the delayed commencement of the antiviral regimen for at least 2 weeks after symptom onset might have reduced the treatment benefit. another patient who received treatment early on the day of admission survived, though MERS-CoV RNA remained detectable in his sputum samples until day 12 of treatment. 20 adult patients with severe MERS who received oral ribavirin and pegylated interferon alpha 2a for 8 to 10 days had significantly better survival rates at 14 days but not at 28 days 324 Pegylated IFN- Exogenous IFN Vero (HCoV-EMC/2012) Decreased CPE at 1 ng/ml 58 IFN-2a Exogenous IFN Vero E6 (Hu/Jordan-N3/2012) IC50 = 160.8 U/ml 324 IFN-2b Exogenous IFN Vero (HCoV-EMC/2012) IC50 = 58.08 g/ml 208 58 Viral protease inhibitors Lopinavir 3C-like protease inhibitor Huh-7 (HCoV-EMC/2012) IC50 = 8.0 M, SI = 3.1; 2 other MERS-CoV strains (MERS-HCoV/KSA/UK/Eng-2/2012 and MERS-HCoV/Qatar/UK/Eng-1/2012) tested were less sensitive.

patients received corticosteroid. second approach to identify candidate antivirals for MERS involves screening of chemical libraries that comprise large numbers of existing drugs or databases. first agent with potent in vitro anti-MERS-CoV activity identified by this method was mycophenolic acid, an antirejection drug used in organ transplantation with broad. spectrum antiviral activities act by inhibiting IMP dehydrogenase and depleting the lymphocyte guanosine and deoxyguanosine nucleotide pools. the combination of mycophenolic acid and interferon beta 1b shows synergistic activity against MERS-CoV in vero cells. chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that inhibits MERS-CoV in vitro in Huh-7 and Vero E6 cells. lopinavir-ritonavir has been used successfully in the treatment of SARS in a case-control study. a number of potent monoclonal antibodies targeting different epitopes on the RBD in the S1 subunit of the MERS-CoV S protein have been identified by biopanning of ultralarge nonimmune human antibody libraries. these monoclonal antibodies bind to the RBD with 10- to 450-fold-higher affinity than does the RBD to the human DPP4 conferring higher neutralizing activity. the rapid determination of crystal structure for these enzymes has facilitated the development of candidate drugs to be further tested in animal studies. the clinical efficacy of anti-DPP4 monoclonal antibodies and adenosine deaminase analogues remains uncertain. cellular proteases that cleave the MERS-CoV protein should also be searched to broaden the range of existing antiviral options (51). infection control measures to interrupt the chain of transmission remain the cornerstone to control the MERS epidemic (3, 4, 153, 231\u2013233) dromedary camels, bats, hedgehogs, other livestock species prevalent in the Middle East should be further surveyed by validated serological and virological tests to exclude unrecognized MERS-CoV infection. residents in and travelers to the regions of endemicity should generally avoid contacting sick animals and especially camels. the risk is estimated to be one new infection in a 5-h flight in first class and 15 infections from a superspreader in a 13-hour flight in economy class (235) the hajj, which attracts millions of pilgrims from over 180 countries to gather in mecca every year, poses a theoretical risk of causing massive outbreaks of MERS. all health care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed MERS should undergo medical surveillance for 14 days after the last day of exposure. exclusion from work for the observation period should also be considered, as applied in the medical surveillance of other respiratory tract infections. a number of vaccines targeting the S protein of MERS-CoV are being developed and evaluated in cell culture or animal experiments. a viral vector-based vaccine using modified vaccinia virus Ankara expressing full-length MERS-CoV S protein induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies in BALB/c mice after intramuscular immunization. identification and exclusion of nonneutralizing epitopes in the immunopredominant domain of the MERS-CoV S protein may help reduce the risk of antibody-mediated disease enhancement. a truncated 212-amino-acid fragment at residues 377 to 588 of RBD fused with human IgG Fc fragment (S377-588-Fc) showed the highest titers of IgG and neutralizing antibodies in BALB/c mice and BALB/c mice (2 i.m. immunizations on days 0 and 21) high levels of NAb were induced 247 VRP-S Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles containing S protein of MERS-CoV (HCoV-EMC/2012) Ad5-hDPP4-transduced BALB/c mice (2 immunizations in the footpads at days 0 and 28) Reduction of viral t polyclonal antibodies against 358-588 S1-Fc mutant efficiently neutralized virus infectivity 34 S377-588-Fc Truncated 212-aa fragment of RBD. increased neutralizing IgG1 (Th2) and IgG2a (Th1) Ab responses specific for the RBD in the S1 subunit

CpG-ODNs given by the i.m. route provided the most robust RBD-specific humoral and cellular immunity. passive immunization using convalescent-phase plasma or hyperimmune globulin with high titers of neutralizing antibody has been used for emerging respiratory viral infections, including SARS and pandemic influenza A/H1N1/2009. clinical use of such therapy for MERS has not yet been evaluated in randomized controlled trials. a baculovirus-based expression system and an approach with equine encephalitis virus replicon particles have been successfully applied for the development of full-length MERS-CoV S protein-based recombinant vaccines. a truncated 212-amino-acid (aa) fragment at residues 377 to 588 of RBD fused with human IgG Fc fragment (S377-588-Fc) showed the highest high levels of NAb were induced 247 VRP-S Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles containing S protein of MERS-CoV (HCoV-EMC/2012) high levels of NAb were induced 247 VRP-S Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particles containing S protein of MERS-CoV (HCoV-EMC/2012) inant protein containing RBD (residues 377\u2013662) of S1 (HCoV-EMC/2012) mice showed neutralizing activity (>96%) against MERS-CoV pseudo- (Huh-7 cells) and live (Vero E6 cells) virus infection 41 358-588 S1-Fc RBD (residues 358-588) of S1 fused with human IgG Fc fragment (HCoV-EMC/2012) the i.m. route provided the most robust RBD-specific humoral and cellular immunity 250 Passive Adoptive transfer of sera Sera containing anti-MERS-CoV S Ab blocked virus attachment and accelerated virus clearance to nearly undetectable levels by 5 days p.i. convalescent-phase plasma or hyperimmune globulin with high titers of neutralizing antibody has been used for emerging respiratory viral infections. the clinical use of such therapy has not yet been evaluated in randomized controlled trials. rhesus macaques showed mild to moderate clinical and histopathological features compared to severe infection in humans. however, clinical signs varied between animals and were usually transient. common marmosets were also found to be susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. a mouse model using mice with prior transduction of respiratory epithelial cells with adenoviral vectors expressing human DPP4 inoculated with MERS-CoV intranasally showed virological, immunological, and histopathological features compatible with interstitial pneumonia. this model requires infection of the mice with the adenoviral vectors prior to every experiment. this model requires infection of the mice with the adenoviral vectors prior to every experiment. mild to moderate symptoms include nasal swelling, piloerection, decreased bowel opening, increased or decreased respiratory rate, decreased food intake, and hunched posture at 1\u20136 days p.i. virological: significant upregulation of genes associated with proinflammatory process (IL-6, CXCL1, MMP9) immunological: neutralizing Ab detected at 7 days p.i. and peaked at 14 days p.i. Microscopic: multifocal mild to moderate interstitial pneumonia and exudative changes in lungs. progression, cell proliferation, fibrogenesis, inflammation, endothelial activation, and tissue repair; upregulation of innate and adaptive immune genes; induction of type I IFNs, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6; inhibition of type II IFNs, IL-1, and TNF-. 174 transgenic mice with global expression of hDPP4 developed progressive wt loss, ruffled fur, lethargy, inactivity, and shallow breathing starting at 2 days p.i. mortality at 6 days p.i. was 100%. immunological: elevated mRNA expressions of antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. virological: no viral RNA detected in nasal, oropharyngeal, urogenital, and rectal swabs from 1\u201311 days p.i. Immunological: neutralizing Ab detected at 14 days p.i. microscopic: no lesions in trachea, heart, lung, spleen, liver, kidney, ileum, colon, urinary bladder, nasal turbinates, and brain tissues. virological: no detectable virus in lungs. the global health community has demonstrated efficient and collaborative efforts to handle the MERS epidemic. the clinical experience gained with SARS and the genomic data accumulated for other human and animal CoVs discovered after SARS have greatly enhanced our understanding of coronavirology and provided lessons that will be useful for tackling future coVs. the successful control of the expanding MERS epidemic will depend on the development of an effective camel vaccine to stop ongoing camel-to-human transmissions. the key research priorities to optimize the clinical outcomes of MERS include more in-depth understanding of the pathogenesis from postmortem studies and serial patient samples."}
