{"summary": "in humans, the disease is characterized by nonspecific symptoms, including undulant fever, weight loss, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and other severe complications. resistance to B. abortus depends on acquired cell-mediated immunity (CMI). adjuvants are coadministered with the antigen in the vaccine formulations. one of these adjuvants is S-[2,3-bispalmitoyiloxy-(2R)-propyl]-R-cysteinyl-amido-monomethoxy polyethylene glycol (BPPcysMPEG), a pegylated synthetic derivative of macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP-2). experimental groups were composed of 2-month-old female BALB/c mice. all mice received food and water ad libitum, and management and disposal were performed. each experiment with Brucella was performed under biosafety level three conditions. ified was double digested with HindIII/BamHI and ligated into expression vector pcDNA3.1. mice were immunized by the i.n. route with 50 g of plasmid coadministered with 0.5 g of BPPcysMPEG. mmuno plates were blocked with 5% gelatin in Tris-buffered saline for 1.5 h. plates were then incubated for 3 h at room temperature with serial 2-fold dilutions. endpoint titers were expressed as retrograde values of the last dilution that gave an optical density at 450 nm (OD450) of two times above the values of the negative controls. mice were euthanized 14 days after last immunization, and spleens were removed. spleens were used to prepare single-cell suspensions by mechanical disaggregation. cells were then washed with RPMI medium (19) spleens from five control or immunized mice in RPMI medium were plated at 2 105 cells/well in flat-bottom microwell plates. the cells were stimulated in vitro with either 0.4 g/ml rSOD, 5 g/ml CBPs, or medium alone and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. previously pulsed antigen-presenting cells and the lymphocytes of immunized mice were distributed to the wells of 24-well cell culture plates (Corning) at a 10:1 ratio and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 5 days. to test the cytotoxic activities against target cells expressing SOD antigen, we incubated effectors and target cells (B. abortus

(invitrogen) was used as the backbone for the DNA vaccine construct. mice were immunized with pcDNA-SOD, pcDNA-SOD/BPPcysMPEG, and pcDNA3.1/BPPcysMPEG. as a negative control, a group of mice was immunized with pcDNA3.1 empty vector or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) Isotype-specific goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugates were added at a 1:1,000 dilution. endpoint titers were expressed as retrograde values of the last dilution that gave an optical density at 450 nm (OD450) of two times above the values of the negative controls. samples negative for SOD-specific IgA were assigned an arbitrary titer of the lowest dilution measured. cell suspensions of spleens from five control or immunized mice were plated at 2 105 cells/well in flat-bottom plates. the cells were stimulated in vitro with either 0.4 g/m. l rSOD, 5 g/ml CBPs, or medium alone and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. supernatants were taken and stored until use at 80\u00b0C. each experiment was performed in triplicate. each mouse was challenged by an intraperitoneal injection of 1 104 CFU of B. abortus strain 2308 (5 mice per group) fourteen days later, the mice were euthanized, and their spleens were homogenized. dilutions were plated to establish the number of Brucella CFU per spleen. 0.52 0 pcDNA3.1 (50 g) 6.16 0.48 0 pcDNA-SOD (50 g) 6.12 0.39 0 pcDNA-SOD (50 g) and BPPcysMPEG (5

titers of SOD-specific IgG by day 15. responses in these two groups were significantly different than those in the animals that received PBS, pcDNA3.1, or pcDNA/BPPcysMPEG (i.e., negative-control groups) sera obtained on days 30 and 45 from mice immunized with pcDNA-SOD showed lower but still significantly increased titers of anti-SOD IgG1 compared to those in the negative-control groups. sera obtained on days 30 and 45 from mice immunized with pcDNA-SOD/BPPcysMPEG showed lower but still significantly increased titers of anti-SOD IgG1 compared to those in the negative-control groups the mice immunized with pcDNA-SOD/BPPcysMPEG showed significantly higher sIgA levels in BAL and NAL fluids than the animals immunized with pcDNA-SOD (P 0.01). the mice showed significantly higher sIgA levels in BAL and NAL fluids than the animals immunized with pcDNA-SOD (P 0.01). those of the animals vaccinated with pcDNA-SOD alone after restimulation with either rSOD (P 0.001) or CBPs (P 0.01) only low levels of spontaneous proliferation were observed when testing cells obtained from the mice in the control groups. significant production of IL-4 (P 0.001) was observed only in supernatant fluids from cultures of splenocytes derived from pcDNA-SOD/BPPcysMPEG-immunized mice. in contrast, significant production of IL-4 (P 0.001) was observed only in the supernatant fluids from cultures of splenocytes derived from pcDNA-SOD-immunized mice. cytotoxic responses were significantly higher at ratios of 5:1 to 50:1 using cells from mice immunized with pcDNA-SOD/BPPcysMPEG than when using cells obtained from the mice immunized with pcDNA-SOD (P 0.001). splenocytes from mice immunized with pcDNA-SOD, pcDNA-SOD/BPPcysMPEG, pcDNA/BPPcy vaccination with live B. abortus strain RB51 induced a 3.55-log-unit increase in protection. immunization with pcDNA-SOD induced a higher degree of protection against challenge (1.13-log-unit increase in protection) than immunization with pcDNA-SOD ( = 0.05) five mice were immunized with pcDNA-SOD, pcDNA-SOD/BPPcysMPEG, pcDNA/BPPcysMPEG, control pcDNA3.1, or PBS. sera were obtained on days 0, 15, 30, and 45 postimmunization, and SOD-specific IgG (A), IgG1 (B), and IgG2a (C) titers were determined. ers in sera from the pcDNA-SOD/BPPcysMPEG group were significantly increased in samples taken on days 15, 30 and 45 postpriming compared to those from the negative-control groups (P 0.001). the sera also showed significantly higher titers of anti-SOD IgG2a compared to those in the mice immunized with pcDNA-SOD (P 0.05 and P 0.001) the endpoint titer of SOD-specific IgA is divided by the total concentration of IgA (in g) present in the sample. bar-connecting lines indicate significant differences between the groups. cellular immune

deviation (error bars) obtained from five mice per group. bar-connecting lines indicate significant differences between groups. cDNA/BPPcysMPEG, pcDNA3.1, or PBS were stimulated in vitro with purified rSOD (0.4 g/ml) as antigen. data are shown as means SEM and are representative of data from two independent experiments. mice were challenged by an intraperitoneal injection of the virulent B. abortus strain 2308 and euthanized 15 days later to determine the number of CFU in their spleens. immunization with pcDNA-SOD or pcDNA-SOD/BPPcysMPEG induced significant degrees of protection compared to the PBS control group. a successful vaccine should trigger agent-specific immunity at a systemic level (27) but also an efficient local mucosal immunity (28). soluble antigens administered via the mucosal route are usually very poorly immunogenic (29). soluble antigens administered via the mucosal route are usually very poorly immunogenic (29). pcDNA-SOD and pcDNA-SOD/BPPcysMPEG-immunized mice showed increased rSOD-specific proliferative responses. splenocytes from pcDNA-SOD and pcDNA-SOD/BPPcysMPEG-immunized mice showed weak CBP-specific proliferative responses. pcDNA-SOD preferentially stimulates Th1 responses whereas BPPc i.n. immunization with pcDNA-SOD leads to SOD-specific systemic and mucosal immunity, which confers protection against B. abortus infection. results show that i.n. immunization with pcDNA-SOD coadministered with BPPcysMPEG leads to SOD-specific systemic and mucosal immunity."}
