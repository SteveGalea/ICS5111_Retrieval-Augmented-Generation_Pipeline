{"summary": "the introduction of highly antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has effectively reduced the mortality and morbidity related to HIV. more than 50% of HIV infected persons receiving HAART demonstrate milder HAND syndromes. cytokines were measured using human cytokine/chemokine kits. the lower levels of detection were ranged between 0.2 and 10.1 pg/mL. a total of 6 cytokines were measured using human cytokine/chemokine kits. the lower levels of detection were ranged between 0.2 and 10.1 pg/mL for each of the cytokines measured. median age was 38 years (range, 11\u201376 years) and 59 (69%) were men. risk factors for HIV infection were sexual transmission (n = 44), intravenous drug use (n = 15), blood transfusion (n = 7), paid blood or plasma donation (n = 2), mother-to-child transmission (n = 15) HIV-CI HIV-NC P value Number of subjects 52 33 Age in years [median (IQR)] 38 (31\u201342) 38 (33\u201342) Gender [n (%)] Male 38 (73%) 21 (64%) Female 14 (27%) 12 (36%) HIV RNA (log10 copies/mL) [median (IQR)] CSF 4.50 (2.95\u20137.50) 3.06 (1.70\u20133.60) P = 0.3640 Plasma 5.915 (3.44\u2013 concentrations of eotaxin and IFN-2 did not show any significant difference. differences were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U test. values below the lower limit of detection of the assay are reported as zero. 0.3949 59.36 0.79 0.0019 0.6241 IQR 15.88\u2013202.3 0\u201345.9 P = 0.0038 6.54\u2013200.4 0\u20131.165 P = 0.0001 Detection Limit 2% 56% 0% 37% G-CSF Median 234.8 207 0.4255 0.1667 64.3 4.36 0.2436 0.5353 IQR 31.54\u2013421.5 26.53\u2013415.2 P = 0.2375 17.62\u2013287.5 plasma and CSF Cytokines HIV infected patients with neurocognitive impairment had elevated levels of cytokines in CSF and plasma in comparison to those with normal neurocognition. there was significant difference in CSF levels of G-CSF (P = 0.0079), IL-8 (P = 0.0223), IP-10 (P = 0.0109) and MCP-1 (P = 0.0497) between HIV-CI and HIV-NC group. IL-8, IP-10, and MCP-1 in CSF were significantly higher than in plasma. but there was no difference for G-CSF. IP-10 presented the strongest correlation in the patients with HIV-CI.
