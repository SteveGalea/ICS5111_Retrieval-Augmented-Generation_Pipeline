{"summary": "experimental evidence suggests that CDHR3 functions as a receptor for rhinovirus C (RV-C) this clinical evidence supports that CDHR3 acts as an RV-C receptor, and raises the possibility of prevention of RV-C infections by targeting CDHR3. parents gave written informed consent before enrolment. parents were invited to the clinic during every episode of troublesome lung symptoms. a nasal sample was collected by the research physician under aseptic conditions. the study population included 289 at birth and 275 at age 3 years. the study population included 289 at birth and 275 at age 3 years. the study population included 289 at birth and 275 at age 3 years. the association between the frequency of viral respiratory illnesses and rs6967330 genotype was examined by quasi-Poisson count regression using an additive genetic model. a quasi-Poisson regression model was used instead of standard Poisson regression to model the observed overdispersion of outcome data. parents gave written informed consent before enrolment. parents were invited to the clinic during every episode of troublesome lung symptoms. a nasal sample was collected by the research physician. the children were diagnosed and treated by research physicians according to predefined algorithms as previously described (7, 8) the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. parents gave written informed consent before enrolment. the COAST cohort study was designed to test for effects of immune development and early-life viral respiratory infections on the risk of allergic diseases and asthma (9). expectant families were recruited during the prenatal period. all babies were delivered in Madison area hospitals. genomes were called with Illumina\u2019s Genome Studio software (rs6967330: Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium P = 0.308, call rate = 1.00) we excluded duplicates, sex mismatches, one of each sibling pair, and children not of European American descent. genomes were called with Illumina\u2019s Genome Studio software. we excluded duplicates, sex mismatches, one of each sibling pair, and children not of European American descent based on self-report. children included in this study were less likely than excluded children to be born preterm, to be delivered after cesarean section, to have mothers who received intra-partum antibiotics, and to have mothers with asthma. the included children were less likely to have a mother who smoked during pregnancy, more likely to have a cat or dog at home, and had, on average, mothers who were older. the annual rates of infections according to CDHR3 rs6967330 genotype are shown in Table E3A. there was no statistically significant association with episodes of gastroenteritis or fever. the distribution of number of total samples, RV-C samples, and non\u2013RV-C samples per child is shown in Figure E1. the CDHR3 risk allele (A) was associated with increased risk of respiratory illnesses with detection of RV-C in COPSAC (IRR = 1.89 [1.14\u20133.05]; P = 0.01), COAST (IRR = 1.37 [1.02\u20131.82]; P = 0.03), and the combined meta-analysis (IRR = 1.51 [1.13\u20132.02]; P = 0.006) there were no significant associations between the CDHR3 variant and respiratory illnesses.

CDHR3 rs6967330-A (tyrosine [Tyr]) allele was associated with respiratory illnesses in the first 3 years of life in two birth cohorts. this was observed for those illnesses in which RV-C was present in nasal samples and not for those with non\u2013RV-C viruses present. a similar RV-C\u2013specific pattern of association was seen during scheduled visits. the underlying mechanism for the asthma-associated CDHR3 allele is due to differential susceptibility to RV-C infections. rs6967330-A (Tyr) was associated with increased numbers of moderate to severe RV-C\u2013related respiratory illnesses in the first 3 years of life in both birth cohort studies. this locus was discovered as a susceptibility locus for an asthma phenotype characterized by severe exacerbations in early childhood (1). RV-C infection was associated with increased risk of recurrent severe respiratory illnesses compared with RV-A and RV-B infections (3). CDHR3 rs6967330-A (tyr) allele was associated specifically with RV-C infections, supporting a role for CDHR3 as an RV-C receptor. this has important implications for virology research and raises the possibility of prevention of RV-C infections. allele was associated with respiratory illnesses in the first 3 years of life in two birth cohorts. this was observed for those illnesses in which RV-C was present in nasal samples and not for those with non\u2013RV-C viruses present. a similar pattern of association was seen during scheduled visits. the underlying mechanism for the asthma-associated CDHR3 allele is due to differential susceptibility to RV-C infections. rs6967330-A (Tyr) was associated with increased numbers of moderate to severe RV-C\u2013related respiratory illnesses in the first 3 years of life in both birth cohort studies. RV-C has been shown to be a frequent trigger of asthma exacerbations in early childhood. it was also reported that RV-C infection was associated with increased risk of recurrent severe respiratory illnesses compared with RV-A and RV-B infections. a GWAS on a specific asthma phenotype can foreshadow improved understanding of disease mechanisms. early RV infections are a risk factor for later asthma development and reduced lung function, but it remains unresolved as to what extent this association is causal. the current results suggest that CDHR3 variation is associated specifically with increased risk of RV-C infections. cohorts acknowledge and appreciate the unique efforts of the COPSAC and COAST research teams."}
