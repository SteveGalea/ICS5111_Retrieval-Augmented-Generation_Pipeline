{"summary": "sorafenib was the first targeted drug to be clinically approved for use in patients with advanced HCC (4\u20136). the major target of sorafenib is the serine-threonine kinase Raf-1, which is involved in the MAPK cascade (7). kinases are associated with tumorigenesis, migration, invasion, and drug resistance. many kinases are reportedly associated with tumor progression in HCC. kinases are reportedly associated with tumorigenesis, migration, invasion, and drug resistance. MAP3K7 expression positively correlated with mTOR expression. high co-expression of MAP3K7 and mTOR was associated with poor survival. HEK293T cells were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected with 2 g scramble short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or shRNA against MAP3K7 (TRCN0000195383), AURKA (TRCN0000010533), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) (TRCN0000121325), or phosphoinositide-3-kinase-catalytic-alpha (PIK3CA) SK-HEP-1 cells harbor a luciferase plasmid (2.0 103 cells/40 L) were seeded into each well of a 384-well white plate containing 10 nM scramble siRNA or kinome siRNA library. luminescent signals were read with a Fluoroskan Ascent FL Reader. transwell invasion assays were performed using 8-m pore inserts (Greiner Bio-One, Stroud, UK) the cells were seeded into the top chamber of 0.5% Matrigel-coated Transwell plates containing 1% FBS. after invasion, the cells were fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. tumor Xenografts Five-week-old immunodeficient mice were purchased and acclimated for 5 days prior to tumor implantation. SK-HEP-1 cells (2.0 106) stably harboring scramble shRNA or shRNA against MAP3K7 were mixed with Matrigel for implantation into the mice. level score 5 was considered \u201clow,\u201d whereas a score >5 was categorized as \u201chigh\u201d. the results of colony formation, migration and invasion were performed by a non-parametric 2-tailed Student's t-test. primary HCC cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 (1:1) supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor (15 ng/mL), epidermal growth factor (20 ng/mL), L-glutamine (2 mM/L), insulin growth factor (4 U/L) for spheroid cell culture, the cells were cultured for 7 days until spheroid formation (diameter > 0.1 mm) CC cells with 10 g/mL polybrene (TR-1003-G, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 24 h. the cells were then maintained in culture medium with 1 g puromycin. the medium was refreshed every 3 days to obtain stable cell lines. the cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 3.0 103 cells/well. the culture medium was replaced every 3 days for 14 days until colony formation. the cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, stained with crystal violet. anti-MAP3K7 (4505, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-phosphorylated (p)-mTOR (Ser2448), anti-mTOR (2983, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-p-AMPK (2532, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-p-Ser792-raptor (2532, Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-ACTB (A5441, Sigma-Aldrich, MO) mice were purchased and acclimated for 5 all tumor cells within each microscopic field were counted for the Allred scoring system. the estimated average staining intensity was scored as: 0 (negative), 1+ (weak expression), 2+ (moderate expression), and 3+ (strong expression). a kinase expression level score 5 was considered \u201clow,\u201d whereas a score >5 was categorized as \u201chigh\u201d. the aim of the present study was to identify a suitable kinase as a therapeutic target for most types of HCC. two HBV-negative HCC cell lines (SK-HEP-1 and Huh7) (29) were transfected with a kinome siRNA library to determine the effect of each gene on HCC cell proliferation. knockdown of MAP3K7 had little effect on G1 phase arrest in cell cycle of SK-HEP-1 and Huh7 cells. siRNAs against top 11 ranked kinases were transfected into SK-HEP-1, HA22T, Huh7, and Hep3B cells for confirmation with a cell proliferation assay. MAP3K7 inhibitor (5Z)-7-oxozeaenol significantly reduced the growth and mobility of HCC cells. silencing MAP3K7 had no effect on cell invasion in HA22T and Hep3B cells. MAP3K7-silenced cells compared to cells transfected with scramble siRNA. the cell invasion results were quantified with Matrigel-coated Transwell filters. MAP3K7 was transiently or stably knocked down in SK-HEP-1 and Huh7. quantified results for migration (D) and invasion (E) are shown as the mean SEM. the cells were seeded in nanoCulture plates to grow as spheroids to mimic tumor formation in vivo. SK-HEP-1 and Huh7 cells harboring siRNA or shRNA against MAP3K7 were injected subcutaneously into nude mice. the volume of the xenografted tumors was measured. iter Glo assay is expressed as a percentage compared with control cells. xenograft tumors were dissected from sacrificed mice and weighed. MAP3K7 expression in xenograft tumors was confirmed by immunohistochemistry using an anti-MAP3K7 antibody. MAP3K7 and MAP3K7 inhibitor reduced proliferation of primary HCC cells. 71T (HBV-negative, HCV-positive) and 89T (HBV-positive, HCV-negative) cells were treated with MAP3K7 kinase inhibitor (5Z)-7-oxozeaen. MAP3K7 requires TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1), TAB2 and TAB3 to trigger NF-B activation, which is a key transcription factor for tumor initiation and malignancy. MAP3K7 knockdown attenuated the effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- stimulation on the transcriptional activity of NF-B in SK-HEP-1 and Huh7 cells. MAP3K7 expression positively correlated with mTOR levels. association of survival with MAP3K7 expression alone or combined with mTOR expression was evaluated by univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. the gene expression of mTOR in MAP3K7 knockdown cells was determined by real-time PCR. TCGA HCC dataset (n = 355) was used to analyze the correlation between MAP3K7 and mTOR expression in tumor tissues through the Pearson 2 test. high 57 (18.4) 1.12 (0.74\u20131.70) 0.600* 1.33 (0.86\u20132.05) 0.200 MAP3K7 (L) MTOR (L) 58 (18.7) 1.00 1.00 Either 202 (65.2) 1.03 (0.72\u20131.46) 0.891* 1.14 (0.72\u20131.79) 0.576 MAP3K7 (H) MTOR (H) 50 (16.1) 1.12 (0.73\u20131.74) 0.599* 1.24 (0. pooled siRNAs against these genes were transfected into SK-HEP-1 and Huh7 and -positive (HA22T and Hep3B) cell lines. the suppressive effects of siRNA against the top five genes on cell proliferation were consistent in the various HCC cell lines examined. MAP3K7 can serve as a tumor promoter or suppressor in liver cells. Stable knockdown with shRNA against NRBP2, PLK1, AURKA, MAP3K7, or PIK3CA in SK-HEP-1 and Huh7 cells was performed. MAP3K7 Kinase Is Involved in HCC Cell Migration and invasion. silencing MAP3K7 had no effect on cell invasion in HA22T and Hep3B cells. treatment of (5Z)-7-oxozeaenol reduced migration and invasion in HA22T. MAP3K7 may be important for metastatic characteristics in certain types of HCC cells. SK-HEP-1 and Huh7 cells were treated with the MAP3K7 inhibitor (5Z)-7-oxozeaenol for 48 or 72 h to measure cell proliferation with cellTiter Glo and (B) colony formation. the cells were incubated overnight in a culture insert, and the insert was removed to assess cell migration in the presence or absence of (5Z)-7-oxozeaenol. the knockdown efficiency of MAP3K7 in xenograft tumors was confirmed by immunohistochemistry using an anti-MAP3K7 antibody. MAP3K7 expression in xenograft tumors was confirmed by immunohistochemistry using an anti-MAP3K7 antibody. MAP3K7 expression was found to promote cell growth and metastatic characteristics in cell culture models. a tissue microarray containing tumor adjacent normal, tumor, and metastatic tissues was used to examine MAP3K7 expression. the level of MAP3K7 protein was higher in tumor tissues than in tumor adjacent normal tissues (p 0.0001) the quantitative results for MAP3K7 protein levels in adjacent normal, tumor, and metastatic tumor tissues are shown. MAP3K7 protein levels 5 and 5 were considered low and high expression, respectively. a protein level of 0 was defined as negative expression. a protein level of 0 was defined as negative expression. similar results were observed in patients with high co-expression levels of MAP3K7 and TAB2 or TAB3. MAP3K7 inactivation induces AMPK activity and diminishes phosphorylation of MTOR in skeletal muscle cells. MAP3K7 expression positively correlated with mTOR levels. neither MAP3K7 expression alone nor in combination with mTOR expression correlated with disease-free survival. MAP3K7/mTOR axis is involved in tumor malignancy, but not recurrence, in patients with HCC.

TP53 inactivation may be involved in kinase-mediated tumorigenesis. PIK3CA is activated by a mutation in 28% of patients with HCC. PI-103 inhibits cell proliferation and enhances the chemosensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib. MAP3K7 inhibitor LYTAK1 blocks NF-B activity to increase chemotherapeutic efficacy in pancreatic cancer cells. MAP3K7 conditional knockout in liver parenchymal cells of mice induces hepatocyte dysplasia and early-onset hepatocarcinogenesis. MAP3K7 reportedly phosphorylates mTOR to regulate mitochondrial function. mTOR is overexpressed in approximately 50% of patients with HCC. mTOR is associated with poor differentiation and prognosis (20) -SC, W-LT, P-FL, and C-WL performed most of the experiments, with the exception of the experiments performed by H-HT and Y-GG.
