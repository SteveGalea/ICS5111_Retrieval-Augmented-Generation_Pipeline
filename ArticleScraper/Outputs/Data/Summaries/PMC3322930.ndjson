{"summary": "data sources included case report forms, epidemiologic investigation forms. criteria for probable and suspected SARS included travel to a SARS-epidemic area in the 2 weeks before onset of symptoms or close contact with a probable SARS patient. data sources included case report forms, epidemiologic investigation forms. criteria for probable and suspected SARS included travel to a SARS-epidemic area in the 2 weeks before onset of symptoms or close contact with a probable SARS patient. on April 5, 2003, fever and headache developed in patient A. her leukocyte count was 6.4 x109/L, chest x-ray showed bilateral infiltrates with pleural effusion. she was treated for possible tuberculosis. on the same day, fever and chest x-ray abnormalities developed in eight of her relatives. the hospital had not implemented isolation and quarantine procedures for SARS during this period. patient D (associated with superspreading) is a 70-year-old woman whose symptoms developed on April 13. she had five close contacts among her relatives; SARS did not occur. 77 SARS patients were in this chain of transmission, including 15 who died. all deaths occurred among persons >40 years of age. 66 did not transmit to others, and 7 transmitted to 3 contacts. case-patients associated with superspreading averaged 36 contacts (range 11\u201374) while others averaged 0.37 contacts. superspreading appeared to be associated with a greater number of contacts. the syndrome developed in 18.5% of close contacts of other patients. three of four superspreading events occurred within the hospital. transmission from patient I was associated with a crowded construction site. the hospital treated a 62-year-old woman for treatment of diabetes mellitus. each of them transmitted SARS to two relatives after discharge. secondary infection rate among their contacts was 50% (4/8) patients D, E, F, G, and H were also hospitalized in the same ward as patient A, for the treatment of other diseases. patient I had 45 close contacts with whom he either worked or lived. secondary attack rate among contacts of patient I was 27%. 77 SARS patients were in this chain of transmission. healthcare workers accounted for 12 (16%) of the cases in this transmission chain. none of the superspreading events involved transmission from healthcare workers. case-patients associated with superspreading averaged 36 contacts. the 77 cases involved 8 households and 1 construction site. there were 47 cases that represented secondary infection within households or workplaces. seven of the eight families had more than two members with SARS. the occurrence of SARS in many visitors highlights the need for administrative controls to restrict exposures to potentially infectious patients. superspreading appeared to be associated with patients who had larger numbers of close contacts as well as a higher attack rate among those contacts. superspreading is not the only respiratory infection characterized by superspreading (8\u201310). the severity of illness may make it easier to identify transmission chains and trace back to the index case in a given community. many countries observed imported cases of SARS, but few experienced local transmission. absence of a superspreading event was likely the dominant factor influencing which countries were spared epidemic spread. triage procedures will require aggressive infection-control management of possible SARS patients."}
