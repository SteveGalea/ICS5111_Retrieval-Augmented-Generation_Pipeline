{"summary": "m6A-seq allows immunoprecipitation of fragmented m6A-modified RNAs followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. m6A writers have also been identified, a catalytically active methyl-transferase, METTL3. a family of effector m6A readers have also been identified. YTHDC1 regulates mRNA translation of targets. other proteins can read m6A indirectly, in a so-called \u2018m6A switch\u2019 mechanism. m6A destabilises the local RNA structure in hairpins. coma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) has a biphasic life cycle, with a latent phase and a productive lytic phase. under various stimuli, the KSHV episome is dormant in the nucleus of endothelial progenitor cells and B-lymphocytes. the replication and transcription activator (RTA) viral protein is the first lytic protein produced. shift assays demonstrate the ability of specific Royal domains to selectively bind m6A-modified RNA. this binding may occur in a RNA secondary structure/sequence-dependent manner. we further developed a modified RIP-seq technique to characterise for the first time the transcriptome-wide binding profile of SND1 to cellular and KSHV mRNAs. we performed m6A-seq in latent cells and cells undergoing lytic replication for 8 hr and 20 hr post-induction in two biological replicates. at 20 hr post-reactivation, 75 m6A peaks were mapped in 42 KSHV ORFs. 12 viral m6A peaks were further validated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) cellular m6A peaks remained mostly unchanged between latent and 8 hr of lytic replication. lower detection of m6A peaks at 20 hr post-reactivation was observed. however, the majority of uniquely identified m6A peaks were found in RNAs whose expression was increased during lytic replication. 5% was required in both biological replicates. m6A-IP reads and input reads for ORF37 and ORF50 transcript from two biological replicates at 20 hr post-viral reactivation are shown. common viral m6A peaks in two biological replicates are shown in the human TREx BCBL1-Rta cell line after 20 hr post-lytic reactivation. total RNA isolated from TREx BCBL1-Rta cells was chemically fragmented and subjected to m6A-IP-qRT-PCR. m6A peaks were identified with m6aViewer. peaks were filtered to keep only those with a minimum of 20 mean reads. the most cellular m6A peaks were identified in the Hesser datasets. 72% of 5,830 m6A-modified transcripts in latent cells were present in the same cell line during latency in the Tan dataset. 52% of our 4,059 m6A-modified transcripts in lytic cells were common to the lytic Tan dataset. this analysis shows a high reproducibility identifying m6A-modified transcripts in KSHV-infected cell lines by three different groups. the percentage of the total m6A-modified transcripts identified in our dataset overlap with previously published studies in TREx BCBL1-Rta and iSLK cells. m6A-IP read coverage across the viral episome is shown for both studies. m6A peaks in ORF50 RNA were consistently mapped in similar regions in both iSLK and TREx BCBL1-Rta cell lines. m6A peaks in ORF50 RNA were consistently mapped in similar regions in both iSLK and TREx cell lines. m6A peaks were found in the second exon of ORF50 RNA. this RNA encodes the latent to lytic switch RTA protein. mass spectrometry analysis revealed that all three viral baits enriched for YTH readers. snRNP200, snRNP116 and PRPF8 were among the top 15 enriched protein hits. multiple proteins related to RNA processing were also enriched in this bait. m6A readers, hnRNPA2B1, hnRNPC, or IGF2BP proteins were enriched in any of the baits. eight proteins with methyl-transferase activity were also recruited to methylated baits. METTL16 is the second m6A methyltransferase identified to date. results identify several members from the \u2018Royal family\u2019 as putative m6A readers. m6A peak positions from all m6A-seq biological replicates studied. m6A-methylation motifs highlighted in red and sequences selected for RNA affinity are shaded in grey. RNA affinity pull-downs were performed using protein lysates from TREx BCBL1-Rta cells that had been reactivated for 24 hr. the beginning of the stem of ORF50-1 bait presents weak base-pairing with four unpaired nucleotides (AUCC) the stable ORF50-1 bait (sORF50-1) has seven nucleotides replaced compared with ORF50-1. inant proteins containing the PWWP domain of PSIP1 selectively bind m6A-modified hairpins. EMSAs were carried out using recombinant GST-PSIP1-agenet domain (residues 2\u2013132) and biotinylated viral RNA baits. cORF50-1, cropped ORF50-1. the complete Royal Tudor domain of SND1 (residues 650\u2013910) is required for sDMA-binding. a GST-recombinant protein containing these residues (548-910) was used in native electromobility shift assays (EMSAs) neither ORF50-4 nor ORF37 methylated baits were selectively bound by SND1-C-terminus. ORF50-1 shows weak base-pairing with four unpaired bases. it may allow opening of the hairpin and selective SND1-binding. no specific selectivity for m6A-sORF50-1 by SND1-C-terminus. shorter exposure of free m6A-sORF50-1 bait did not reveal two distinct bands as the ones present in m6A-ORF50-1 hairpin. EMSAs showed no selectivity for m6A-ORF50-1 bait, suggesting non-specific DNA prevents the interaction between SND1 and m6A-ORF50-1 bait. SND1 is an m6A reader in KSHV-infected cells. we aimed to characterise the RNA-binding sites of endogenous SND1 transcriptome-wide during KSHV infection. the majority of the fragments ranged from 150 to 1000 bp. all highly expressed transcripts identified by RIP-seq (FDR 1%) were divided into high-confidence targets and high-confidence non-targets. the proportion of m6A-bearing RNAs in each group was determined. this transcript-wide analysis will not identify all SND1 targets. a false discovery rate (FDR) 1% is applied to RIP-seq data. no significant correlation between the number of m6A peaks in a given RNA and the binding of SND1 as determined by log2 fold change RIP/input. ND1 are enriched over shorter fragments during RIP. proteins were removed by proteinase K treatment. cross-links were reversed after sonication of formaldehyde-fixed TREx BCBL1-Rta cells. subset of m6A-modified transcripts identified by m6A-seq in same cell line. bioinformatic analysis of SND1 RIP-seq data. most enriched motif found in intronic enriched regions. 65% of all RNA targets contained m6A-modified transcripts. only 4%, 1% and 3% were shared with YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3 respectively. a novel localised enrichment analysis was developed similar to that used in ChIP-seq analysis. 4872 of these total targets showed SND1-binding throughout 5\u2019UTR, CDS and 3\u2019UTR. we then focused on analysing SND1-enriched intronic regions. out of the total 32,314 SND1-enriched regions, 2563 regions were found in introns. of these, 516 intronic regions directly overlapped with m6A peaks. TREx BCBL1-Rta cells depicting input (green) and RIP (blue) coverage. m6A-IP reads (pink) are also shown. m6A peak and 2-fold enrichment of m6A-IP reads over input reads. a U-tract was the most significant motif identified. in intronic regions that do not have m6A peaks, a U-tract was also the most enriched motif. we re-analysed multiple eCLIP datasets from the ENCODE consortium for established m6A reader proteins and SND1. we first assessed the overlap between the m6A profile in latent TREx BCBL1-Rta cells and HepG2 cells using an existing m6A-seq dataset from HepG2 cells. this revealed an extensive overlap of transcripts which contain m6A sites in these cells lines. transcripts with a bias towards coding region binding in common with most other reader proteins. the control TIAL1 protein displayed a strong 3\u2019 UTR bias. we used HOMER to identify motifs bound by SND1 and other established reader proteins. a highly expressed viral lytic RNA, ORF57, did not reach the cut-off to be considered a high-confidence target. a 40 fold SND1 enrichment was detected in the second exon and a 10 fold enrichment in the intron compared with the SND1 enrichment detected on the non-target 18S rRNA. PSIP1 showed a limited but consistent enrichment (3 fold) above the negative control IgG. SND1 knockdown significantly impairs KSHV lytic replication. RIP-seq identifies KSHV mRNAs as high-confidence targets. ND1 RIPs, n = 4 independent RIPs, for FXR1, FXR2 and normal rabbit IgG n = 3 independent RIPs. values are averages, error bars present s.d. ***p0.001 using an unpaired t-test. western blots are representative of two independent viral reactivations. n = 3 independent viral reactivations followed by three independent chromatin immunoprecipitations. BCBL1 cells were transduced with either scramble or METTL3-specific shRNAs. two days post-transduction media was replaced with puromycin-containing media. following 5 days post-transduction cells were reactivated for 24 hr and viral RNA and protein levels analysed. a, c, e Cellular and viral RNA levels were measured by qRT-PCR 24 hr post-reactivation. for YTHDF1 knockdowns n = 3 independent viral reactivations. for YTHDF3 knockdown n = 4 independent viral reactivations. qRT-PCR analysis confirmed a 4 fold-induction of these transcripts in SND1-depleted cells during the lytic cycle. TREx BCBL1-Rta cells are reactivated by expression of myc-tagged RTA which is integrated in the host genome in a spliced form. reactivation is achieved by addition of the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate (NaB), which leads to the expression of unsplice the same lentiviral shRNAs targeting SND1 were used to knockdown SND1 in TREx BCBL1-Rta cells. the same lentiviral shRNAs targeting SND1 were used to knockdown SND1 in BCBL1 cells. RNA-seq analysis reveals significant alterations in splicing events between scramble latent and scramble lytic TREx BCBL1-Rta cells. no significant changes in splicing are observed between scramble and lytic cells during latency (middle panel) or 24 hr lytic replication (left panel) values are averages, error bars present s.d. for mutant ORF50 n = 9 independent m6A-IPs. for mutant ORF50 n = 3, for DAA-treated cells n = 3. RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) antibody (clone CTD4H8) and non-specific immunoglobulin (IgG) were used respectively as positive and negative control antibodies. TREX BCBL1-Rta-SND1 depleted cells showed no significantly downregulated viral gene expression. ORF50 RNA was monitored in scramble and SND1-depleted TREx BCBL1-Rta cells. native ORF50 RNA was significantly more unstable in SND1-depleted cells. 80% of ORF50 RNA remaining at 6 hr post-transcription inhibition in scramble cells and 50% in depleted cells. a second cell line (METTL3 KD1) showed no depletion of METTL3 protein. in contrast, a second cell line (METTL3 KD1) showed no depletion of METTL3 protein. in addition, stable BCBL1 cell lines harbouring shRNA knockdown of either FTO, YTHDF1 or YTHFD3. wild type FLAG-ORF50 containing both ORF50 exons and the intron- and mutant plasmids were transfected into HEK-293 cells. m6A enrichment was quantified by m6A-IP-qPCR. no significant decrease in SND1 binding was observed. DAA effectively reduced m6A enrichment in all m6A-modified regions of ORF50 RNA. m6A inhibition on ORF50 RNA regulates SND1 binding to it. but the exact points of interaction between SND1 and ORF50 RNA remain to be elucidated. in latent cells, we consistently observed m6A peaks in six viral RNAs. at 8 hr post-reactivation, 33 m6A peaks were identified in 21 KSHV ORFs. at 20 hr post-reactivation, 75 m6A peaks were mapped in 42 KSHV ORFs. m6A peaks in cellular RNAs were also consistently called. 60% of viral m6A peaks contained the GGm6AC[G/U] motif. m6A peaks identified by m6AViewer software with associated p-values are indicated. a minimum fold change of m6A-IP reads over input reads was required in both biological replicates. m6A peaks present in four topological regions of viral RNAs. most significantly enriched DRm6ACH motif found in viral transcripts. meME software was used for motif analysis. ORF50-1, ORF50-2, ORF50-3 and ORF50-4 indicate primers that generate an amplicon spanning the m6A peak in the ORF50 intron respectively. ORF57 positive primers span the tallest m6A peak in the second exon of ORF57 mRNA while negative primers span the first m6A peak in the ORF57 second exon. the most cellular m6A peaks were identified in the Hesser datasets in iSLK cells with 25,000 m6A peaks. a direct one-to-one reciprocal overlap comparison between each of our m6A peaks and those found in the other datasets was not possible. m6A peaks were identified with m6aViewer version 1.6.1. peaks were filtered to keep only those with a minimum of 20 mean reads, 1% FDR (benjamini-hochberg) and an enrichment of 4-fold m6A-IP/input. top two deep-sequencing coverage tracks of ORF50 RNA are shown for our two lytic biological replicates at 20 hr reactivation in TREx BCBL1-Rta cells. top two deep-sequencing coverage tracks of ORF50 RNA are shown for our two m6A-seq datasets. m6A-IP coverage maps differed more than the TREx BCBL1-Rta cells. RNA affinity identifies putative m6A readers which belong to the Tudor domain \u2018Royal family\u2019. m6A peaks found in the second exon of ORF50 RNA encode the latent to lytic switch RTA protein. all three m6A baits enriched for YTH readers. methylated ORF50-1 (m6A-ORF50-1) distinctly enriched SND1. YTHDF1 was in the top thirteen enriched protein hits. the aromatic cage used for m6A recognition by YTH readers is structurally similar to the one present in the \u2018Royal family\u2019. several royal members were also enriched in methylated viral baits. LC-MS/MS identifies members from the \u2018Royal family\u2019 as putative m6A readers. mass spectrometry results of RNA affinity pull-downs using m6A-modified and unmodified biotinylated viral RNA baits. m6A-methylation motifs are highlighted in red and shaded in grey. the GGACT motif is centred in the middle of each RNA affinity bait. RNA affinity pull-downs were performed using protein lysates from TREx BCBL1-Rta cells that had been reactivated for 24 hr. a fraction of free m6A-ORF50-1 bait migrates slower than A-ORF50-1 bait. Representative native EMSAs using ORF50-1 baits on their own without any protein addition using a one second film exposure. EMSAs were carried out side by side using recombinant GST-CBX3-Chromo domain (residues 29\u201386) and control GST protein. up to 15 M GST protein was also tested without showing any shift. ORF50-4 and ORF37 methylated baits were selectively bound by SND1-C-terminus. the membranes had to be overexposed to obtain a good shift signal due to the small amount of shifted RNA in comparison with the free bait. a weak shift has also been observed in EMSAs for FMRP protein. m6A addition to ORF50-1 destabilises the hairpin which migrates slower compared with the non-methylated bait. a cropped version of ORF50-1 bait (cORF50-1) with strong base-pairing throughout the stem was tested in EMSAs. no specific selectivity for m6A-sORF50-1 by SND1-C-terminus was seen. control glutathione S-transferase (GST), a protein with no RNA-binding properties, was also tested in EMSA showing no selectivity for m6A-ORF50-1 bait. the free bait remained uncomplexed, suggesting that non-specific DNA prevents the interaction between SND1 and m6A-ORF50-1 bait. a transcript-wide analysis uncovered SND1 as a bona fide RNA-binding protein. of these, 3319 transcripts were mRNAs and 748 were long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) these target RNAs were consistently bound by SND1 during latency and lytic KSHV replication. transcript-wide analysis will not identify all SND1 targets. some RNAs are bound by SND1 at a specific region only. most significantly enriched GO terms amongst the 5061 target RNAs identified by RIP-seq. RNA targets and m6A peaks for YTH readers were mined from publically available PAR-CLIP and m6A-seq datasets from HeLa cells. overlap of target genes with m6A modifications between SND1 and heterologously expressed YTH reader proteins. introns are collapsed and exons spliced together into a single continuous RNA molecule. the majority of the fragments are between 50 and 200 base pairs (bp) in length with a small tail of fragments of larger sizes (>500 bp) the heat fragmentation step before cDNA synthesis was omitted. a U-tract coupled to a DRm6ACH motif is significantly enriched in intronic regions that overlap m6A peaks. a positive correlation between the number of m6A peaks in a given transcript and the SND1fold enrichment was not found. 37% of m6A-modified targets are common to YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3 respectively. only 4%, 1% and 3% were shared with YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3 respectively. a novel localised enrichment analysis was developed similar to that used in ChIP-seq analysis. ,314 SND1-enriched regions, 2563 regions were found in introns. of those, 516 intronic regions directly overlapped with m6A peaks. only 1.3% (109) directly overlapped with m6A peaks. m6A-IP reads (pink) are also shown. m6A-IP reads (pink) are also shown. m6A-IP reads (pink) are also shown. RIP-seq enabled us to identify differential SND1-binding to target RNAs that correlated to both differentially m6A-modified RNAs and the status of KSHV infection. at 8 hr and 20 hr post-reactivation, several adenosines in this intron are m6A-modified and SND1 binding ensues. 77% of TREx BCBL1-Rta m6A-modified transcripts were present in hepG2 cells. this showed an overlap of 1166 transcripts bound by SND1 of which 88% contained m6A sites. we then compared the extent of overlap between m6A and eCLIP peaks on transcripts. SND1 recognises consensus m6A motif in vivo. overlap of eCLIP, RIP-seq and m6A-seq enriched transcripts. overlap of m6A-seq peaks and eCLIP binding sites. equencing coverage for high-confidence SND1 targets can be seen in Figure 7. RIP-seq identifies KSHV mRNAs as high-confidence SND1 targets at 0 hr (left panel), 8 hr (middle panel) and 20 hr (left panel) post-reactivation. ORF50-1, ORF50-2, ORF50-3 and ORF50-4 indicate primers that generate an amplicon spanning the first, second, third and fourth m6A peaks of the second exon of ORF50 RNA. values are averages, error bars present s.d. orF57 antibody detects both full length ORF57 protein (black arrow) and the caspase-7-cleaved form (white arrow) Western blots are representative of two independent viral reactivations. m6A methylation has a pro-viral role in the KSHV lytic life cycle. after 5 days post-transduction cells were reactivated for 24 hr. m6A methylation has a pro-viral role in the KSHV lytic life cycle. values are averages, error bars present s.d. *p0.05, **p0.01, ***p0.001 using an unpaired t-test. ns = not significant. Western blots are representative of two independent viral reactivations. p0.05, **p0.01, ***p0.001 using an unpaired t-test. Western blots are representative of two independent viral reactivations. SND1 stabilises ORF50 RNA and is essential for KSHV replication. TREx BCBL1-Rta cells are reactivated by expression of myc-tagged RTA. this native RNA matures to the spliced form giving rise to a doxycycline-inducible promoter. this native RNA matures to the spliced form giving rise to RTA protein, which then transactivates the ORF50 promoter in a positive transcriptional feedback mechanism. however, as SND1 does not take part in the ND1 KD2 BCBL1 cells from two biological replicates were significantly downregulated. after 24 hr of lytic reactivation, 48 KSHV RNAs were significantly downregulated in SND1-depleted cells compared with scramble cells (FDR 5%) these results indicate that in the absence of SND1 there is a global impairment of lytic KSHV replication downstream of RTA and uncover SND1 as an essential protein for lytic KSHV replication. TREx BCBL1-Rta cells were reactivated for 24 hr into the lytic cycle. transcription was inhibited with actinomycin D (2.5 g/ml) each viral gene was normalised against 18S rRNA. values are averages, error bars present s.d. n = 4 independent viral reactivations. SND1 enrichment was determined by SND1-RIP-qPCR. values are averages, error bars present s.d. for mutant ORF50 n = 4 independent RIPs. for mutant ORF50 n = 3 independent RIPs. RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) antibody (clone CTD4H8) and non-specific immunoglobulin (IgG) were used respectively as positive and negative control antibodies. RNAPII was enriched at the GAPDH promoter and multiple viral promoters including ORF50, but there was no significant enrichment for either SND1 or the non-specific IgG. removal of m6A in ORF50 RNA impairs SND1 binding to ORF50 RNA Due to the broad and overlapping m6A-seq peaks across the ORF50 RNA. we attempted to deplete global m6A levels in ORF50 RNA by stably depleting METTL3 in BCBL1 cells. however limited depletion was achieved and no significant effect on KSHV lytic replication was observed. depletion of YTHDF1 or YTHDF3 readers resulted in increased viral mRNA and protein levels. depletion of YTHDF1 or YTHDF3 readers resulted in decreased ORF50 RNA and other lytic RNAs. a clear decrease in RTA protein and a slight reduction in ORF57 protein levels were evident. point mutation in the motif contained in ORF50-1 bait significantly reduced m6A enrichment. the binding of SND1 to WT FLAG-ORF50 and to a FLAG-ORF50 plasmid with a point mutation in the motif was evaluated by RIP. no significant decrease in SND1 binding was observed. in the absence of SND1, unspliced ORF50 RNA is more unstable. this results in reduced RTA protein levels which will further reduce activation of the RTA promoter in a negative feedback loop that culminates in lytic replication impairment. ao et al., 2010) and stabilises AT1R and IGFBP2 mRNAs. it will be of interest to address to what extent SND1 regulates stability of its target RNAs. curiously, the readers YTHDF1-3, FXR1, FXR2 and FMR1 have also been identified in mammalian stress granule cores. plant agenet members contain two plant agenet domains (Agenet1 and Agenet2) in tandem, each harbouring an aromatic cage. the aromatic cage of Agenet2 is proposed to be the site that binds methylated lysines. the aromatic cage of Agenet2 is proposed to be the site that binds methylated lysines. the N-terminal region of SND1 most likely contributes to RNA binding. the aromatic cage of Royal domains plays a role in recognising m6A-modified RNA. these studies could lead to the development of small molecule inhibitors. spermatid perinuclear RNA-binding protein (STRBP) was within the top ten enriched proteins in m6A-ORF50-1 bait. the remainder members of the Tudor protein subfamily bind methyl-lysine residues and contain other domains related to chromatin biology. the discovery of PSIP1, HDGFRP2 and MSH6 as putative m6A readers is surprising. highly specialised domains such as the Royal domains may be required for selective and direct recognition of m6A. proteins without aromatic cages may not be able to directly read m6A.

Other Magna ChIP Protein A+G magnetic beads Merck Millipore 16\u2013663 Used for m6A-seq and RIP-seq Cell lines were purchased from ATCC. TREx BCBL1-Rta cells were induced using 2 g/mL doxycycline hyclate (Sigma-Aldrich) and BCBL1 cells were induced using 2 mM sodium butyrate (Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies used in Western blotting are listed below: anti-SND1 (Proteintech, 10760\u20131-AP, 1:1,000); anti-METTL3 (Bethyl, A anti-FXR2 (Proteintech, 12552\u20131-AP); anti-PSIP1 (Proteintech, 25504\u20131-AP); anti-YTHDF3 (Abclonal, A8395) and normal rabbit IgG (Merck Millipore, 12\u2013370) RNA was ethanol-precipitated and re-suspended in 10 l of RNase-free water. 2 g of total fragmented RNA was saved as input RNA for later use in cDNA library construction. beads were re-suspended in 100 l of IP/wash buffer. libraries for the first biological replicate were sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 platform (Illumina) with 101 bp paired-end lane. for m6A-seq two independent biological replicates were prepared for each time point analysed (0 hr, 8 hr and 20 hr post-reactivation) RIPs were pended in 200 l of ice-cold shearing buffer. they were supplemented with Complete, EDTA-free protease inhibitors. samples were then sonicated with an EpiShear multi-sample sonicator. RNA was purified as described for m6A-seq. but instead of using phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol for purification, TRIzol LS (Thermo Scientific) was used according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. DNA-free DNA Removal Kit (Ambion) was used to remove any contaminating DNA from RIP RNA samples. RNA-seq NGS libraries were generated from two independent biological replicates using scramble and SND1 KD2 TREx BCBL1-Rta cells during latency and after 24 hr of lytic reactivation. a third biological replicate RIP sample at 0 hr was also deep-sequenced. as 1% input was saved, the dilution factor is 100 or 6.644 cycles (i.e. log2 of 100) percentage of recovery from the initial reaction (% input) was then calculated for each primer as 100 x Amplification efficiency (-Ct normalised m6A-IP) m6A enrichment was calculated as the fold change between the % input for a region of interest over the % input for a non-target control region. all raw sequence data were processed using Cutadapt software (Martin, 2011) in order to remove poor quality bases (quality score less than 20) as well as Illumina universal sequencing adapter sequence (AGATCGGAAGAG) from the 3\u2019 end of reads. read pairs shorter than 25 bp after trimming were discarded. peaks were called using m6aViewer software version 1.6. a minimum fold change of m6A-IP reads over input reads of 1.5. a false discovery rate of 5% (FDR 5%) was required in both replicates. RIP-seq data analysis SND1 binding sites were initially identified at transcript-level resolution by counting reads in the SND1 immunoprecipitated (RIP) and input (control) sample data. custom Java code was used to identify transcriptome regions that were enriched in the RIP data when compared to the input controls. low coverage segments (20 reads in RIP) were filtered out as quality control. all data from the different samples in the analysis were then merged to generate a single dataset that contained read depth data. each segmented region was subsequently treated as an individual \u2018gene\u2019 for re-analysis using DESeq2. eCLIP analysis Binding sites from eCLIP experiments were downloaded from ENCODE as narrowPeak bed files. clusters from replicate one which directly overlapped clusters in replicate two were extracted and kept for downstream analyses. de novo motif analysis was performed by feeding peaks into the findMotifsGenome.pl function within the HOMER suite (version 4.9.1) exons containing m6A-seq peaks were identified and these whole exon sequences were used for motif discovery. sequences for baits spanning an m6A consensus in the first m6A peak identified in ORF50 (ORF50-1) were: 5 -biotin-GUUGUCCAGUAUUCUGCAAGG-m6A-CUGUACCAGCUGGACACGCCA-3 and 5 -biotin-GGAGCCAGGACUGGGGCC-3. lysates were centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 10 min at 12,000 x g to pellet cell debris. 1000 g of protein per pull-down in an approximate volume of 200 l were supplemented with 40 units of RNasin Plus (Promega) and 50 g of yeast tRNA (Sigma-Aldrich) the final volume of the binding reaction was topped to 1 mL with binding buffer (150 mM KCl, 1.5 m input and pull-down samples were used for either Western blotting or LC-MS/MS analysis. each gel lane was excised and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion. peptides in 1% (v/v) formic acid were injected onto an Acclaim PepMap C18 nano-trap column. ionised by nano-electrospray ionisation at 2.1 kV using a stainless-steel emitter with an internal diameter of 30 m and a capillary temperature of 250\u00b0C. the LTQ- Orbitrap was set to analyse the survey scans at 60,000 resolution (at m/z 400) in the mass range m/z 300 to 2000 and the top twenty multiply charged ions in each duty cycle selected for MS/MS. the data was filtered at 5% FDR and removed any proteins that were only matched by a single peptide. the data was sorted based on the number total number of peptide spectrum matches (PSM\u2019s) identified, such that those proteins at the top of the list were only identified in the methylated samples. the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. the resin was washed twice with lysis buffer and once with 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4. the lysate was then sonicated using a sonicator. sperm DNA is provided after phenol-chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitation and sonication. the same biotinylated baits used in the RNA affinity experiments were used for EMSAs. site-directed mutagenesis A FLAG tag ORF50 gene included both ORF50 exons and the ORF50 intron cloned into a pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-Puro vector was purchased from NovoPro Bioscience. all plasmids containing the desired mutation were confirmed by DNA sequencing. atants were harvested, filtered through a 0.45 m filter (Merck Millipore) one mL of each 12-well plate was used to infect 500,000 cells by spin inoculation for 60 min at 800 x g at room temperature.
