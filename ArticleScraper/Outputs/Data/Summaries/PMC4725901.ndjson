{"summary": "infectious entry of IAV into SIA-deficient Lec2 cells expressing DC-SIGN/L-SIGN occurs independently of SIA and is pH- and dynamin-dependent. previous studies also demonstrated that IAV infection of lec2 cells expressing DC-SIGN/L-SIGN was inhibited by mannan, but not by pre-treatment of cells with bacterial sialidase8. CHO-ctrl, lec2-ctrl, lec2-DC-SIGN or lec2-L-SIGN cells were infected with (a) BJx109 or (b) HKx31 and HKx31 HSR (MOI 50 PFU/cell) for 8 hr at 37 \u00b0C. in some wells, 50 M of dynasore was added to the cells at the time of infection. cells were incubated for a total of 8 hr. additional wells incubated with 106 FFU of PIV-3 (MOI 5 FFU/cell) in the presence or absence of 50 M dynasore were fixed and stained for expression of PIV-3 NP. all wells were fixed at 8 hr post-inoculation and stained for expression of viral NP. inoculation of CHO-ctrl, lec2-DC-SIGN and lec2-L-SIGN resulted in 60\u201380% infection 8 hr post-exposure. addition of NH4Cl immediately after virus (t = 0 hr) reduced infection levels to 1%. y effects of dynasore are not mediated at post-entry steps in the virus life cycle. dynasore-mediated inhibition of IAV infection since PIV-3 infects cells in a pH-independent manner via direct fusion with the plasma membrane. lec2-DC-SIGN-AA and lec2-L-SIGN-AA lines expressed higher levels of cell-surface CLR. the amino acid sequence of the cytoplasmic domain of wild-type (WT) DC-SIGN and L-SIGN are shown. mutants containing LLAA mutations (AA) and deletion mutants lacking the entire cytoplasmic tail (DEL) cell monolayers were incubated with anti-DC-SIGN/L-SIGN mAb. cells were incubated at 4 \u00b0C or 37 \u00b0C for 40 min. mAb remained cell-surface associated for cells expressing -AA and -DEL mutants of either CLR. IGN-WT or Lec2-L-SIGN-WT cells at 37 \u00b0C colocalized with Rab5+ compartments. little colocalization was evident in lec2 cells expressing -AA or -DEL mutants. mutation (LL to AA) within or deletion of intracellular cytoplasmic domain abrogates endocytic capacity of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN. IAV binding to cells expressing -WT, -AA or -DEL mutants of DC-SIGN/L-SIGN is Ca2+-dependent. no binding to lec2-ctrl cells was observed. IAV entry into cells expressing -WT, -AA or -DEL mutants of DC-SIGN/L-SIGN. monolayers of lec2 cells expressing -WT, -AA or -DEL mutants of DC-SIGN/L-SIGN were transfected with a RFP-tagged Rab5 construct (red) and 16 hr post-transfection, incubated with 107 PFU of BJx109 p 0.05, One way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test. we compared the ability of BJx109 to infect lec2 cell lines expressing WT. for cells expressing DC-SIGN, the AA mutation was associated with a significant reduction in sensitivity to infection by BJx109. entry of IAV into SIA-deficient Lec2 cells expressing DC-SIGN/L-SIGN occurs independently of SIA and is pH- and dynamin-dependent. previous studies also demonstrated that IAV infection of lec2 cells expressing DC-SIGN/L-SIGN was inhibited by mannan. CHO-ctrl, lec2-ctrl, lec2-DC-SIGN or lec2-L-SIGN cells were infected with (a) BJx109 or (b) HKx31 and HKx31 HSR (MOI 50 PFU/cell) for 8 hr at 37 \u00b0C. data represent mean percent infected cells (1 SEM) from at least 4 independent fields. in some wells, 50 M of dynasore was added to the cells at the time of infection. cells were incubated for a total of 8 hr. additional wells incubated with 106 FFU of PIV-3 (MOI 5 FFU/cell) were fixed and stained for expression of PIV-3 NP at 16 hr post-infection. all wells were fixed at 8 hr post-inoculation and stained for expression of viral NP. inoculation of CHO-ctrl, lec2-DC-SIGN and lec2-L-SIGN resulted in 60\u201380% infection 8 hr post-exposure. addition of NH4Cl immediately after addition of virus (t = 0 hr) reduced infection levels to 1%. dynasore did not inhibit the ability of PIV3 to infect CHO-ctrl cells. dynasore-mediated inhibition of IAV infection since PIV-3 infects cells in a pH-independent manner. DC-SIGN-AA and Lec2-L-SIGN-AA lines expressed higher levels of cell-surface CLR. the amino acid sequence of the cytoplasmic domain of wild-type (WT) DC-SIGN and L-SIGN are shown. mutants containing LLAA mutations (AA) and deletion mutants lacking the entire cytoplasmic tail (DEL) cell monolayers incubated with anti-DC-SIGN/L-SIGN mAb at 4 \u00b0C. after 16 hr post-transfection, cells were incubated at 4 \u00b0C or 37 \u00b0C for 40 min. mAb internalized by lec2-DC-SIGN/L-SIGN mAb. lec2 cells expressing -AA or -DEL mutants colocalized with Rab5+ compartments. little colocalization was evident in lec2 cells expressing -AA or -DEL mutants. mutation (LL to AA) within or deletion of intracellular cytoplasmic domain abrogates endocytic capacity of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN. IAV binding to cells expressing -WT, -AA or -DEL mutants of DC-SIGN/L-SIGN is Ca2+-dependent. no binding to lec2-ctrl cells was observed. GN-WT effectively internalized virus, as indicated by enhanced colocalization with Rab5+ compartments. monolayers of lec2 cells expressing -WT, -AA or -DEL mutants of DC-SIGN/L-SIGN were transfected with a RFP-tagged Rab5 construct (red) and 16 hr post-transfection, incubated with 107 PFU of BJx109 for 1 hr at 4 \u00b0C p 0.05, One way ANOVA followed by Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test. we compared ability of BJx109 to infect lec2 cell lines expressing WT and mutated forms of DC-SIGN/L-SIGN. DC-SIGN and L-SIGN are mannose-specific CLRs that act as attachment factors and promote infection by a range of different viruses. they act as attachment factors and promote infection by a range of different viruses, including Ebola and marburg viruses, dengue virus (DV), dengue virus (DV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and phleboviruses. we previously reported that pre-treatment of CHO cells with bacterial sialidase abrogated IAV infection but did not alter infection of lec2 cells expressing either DC-SIGN or L-SIGN8. these studies confirm that high level expression of CLRs on SIA-deficient transfectants bypassed the requirement for SIA-mediated attachment. cross-linking of cell-surface DC-SIGN with mAb has been shown to induce efficient endocytosis of DC-SIGN in DCs31. ligation with mAb relocalizes DC-SIGN to late endocytic and lysosomal compartments15, suggesting that cargo-dependent signalling may determine the particular internalization pathway utilized. cell lines CHO Pro-5 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), manassas, VA, USA. the glycosylation mutant cell line, Lec2, was also obtained from the ATCC. both cell lines were cultured in alpha-minimal essential medium. virified from allantoic fluid by rate zonal sedimentation on 25 to 75% (wt/vol) sucrose gradients. purified virus was biotin labelled via exposed lysine groups using EZ-link-Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC Biotin reagent. nucleotide sequences of all DC-SIGN/L-SIGN constructs confirmed by sequence analysis.
