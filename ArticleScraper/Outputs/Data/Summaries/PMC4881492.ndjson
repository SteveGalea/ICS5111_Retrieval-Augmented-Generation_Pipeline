{"summary": "dengue virus disease affects about 50 to 100 million people worldwide. rotavirus infects about two million children under five years of age. seasonal influenza epidemics cause severe illness in three to five million people. traditional vaccines, such as attenuated vaccines, are created by altering the genome, such that they become less virulent to harmless. vaccines against measles, mumps, rubella and others are created this way and have had a good success rate, but have sometimes reverted to a virulence status through mutation. the idea is to scan the viral genome for the protein antigens that can elicit an immune response and then synthesize them into a peptide vaccine. a more focused approach is to precisely locate the epitope regions within these antigens and utilize them to elicit the immune response [14] the recent advancements in the technological and bioinformatics fields enable computer-based approaches for this purpose. the appropriate viral protein and its peptide segments according to chosen criteria, ensuring adequate hydrophilicity of the selected peptides, epitope potential of the peptide segments against cellular and humoral immune response. a MAP can be highly immunogenic and substitute as a multivalent vaccine combining several selected peptides. a phase I trial of a multivalent peptide vaccine against non-small cell lung cancer found the vaccine using a mixture of four peptides to be safe and capable of generating strong T-cell responses. advances in bioinformatics, proteomics, immunoinformatics, structural biology and others have led to vaccinomics and reverse vaccinology as novel approaches for a generation of new vaccines. a recombinant protein comprises nine conserved peptides from influenza A and B as anti-influenza peptide vaccine in a phase IIb study [34], a phase I study of another influenza vaccine [35], a multi-peptide mix with adjuvant of newly discovered conserved segments from a HIV-1 protein to augment the body\u2019s natural immunity with a broader, more rationally-designed immunity inducer [36], a phase 1 study by the Mayo Clinic [ Identifier: NCT00002428 in [18] Peptide vaccine for recurrent prostate cancer University Hospital Tuebingen Phase II Identifier: NCT02452307 in [18] Multileric linear epitope based peptide vaccine for influenza A and B BiondVax Pharmaceuticals Ltd. several web servers have been designed for predicting T-cell and B-cell epitopes targeting humoral- and cell-based immune responses. popular web servers include IEDB (Immune Epitope Database) analysis resource [47], and ABCpred (Artificial neural network based B-cell epitope prediction) server [48], which uses an artificial neural network program trained on a set of 700 known B-cell epitopes. the netCTL 1.2 server predicts CTL (Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes) epitopes in protein sequences. they identified a 9 mer epitope, KSSTGFVYF amino acid sequence. they then determined conservancy of the B-cell epitopes from the IEDB (Immune Epitope Database) server [26] and allergenicity from the AllerHunter tool. sequence alignment of selected strains of the dengue virus. they determined the consensus sequence of the dengue virus envelope glycoprotein and nine conserved segments of 8 to 22 amino acids in each segment. the next step was to discard those that had a hydrophobicity exceeding 50%, implying reduced propensity to surface exposure. alignment-free tools for rapid scanning of large numbers of sequences at a time to determine areas of similarities and dissimilarities. the method is to scan each protein sequence by a window of 8/12/14 amino acids as required and consider the sequence descriptors in each window at each position for all the protein sequences. several web servers have been designed for predicting T-cell and B-cell epitopes targeting humoral- and cell-based immune responses. several web servers have been designed for predicting T-cell and B-cell epitopes targeting humoral- and cell-based immune responses. peptide binding was found to compare well with several other web-accessible methods for HLA class II peptide-binding prediction. they presented 56 strains of the HCoV spike protein to the VaxiJen 2.0 server. they selected the one with the highest antigenicity index for the next analysis of epitope-prediction for T-cell response. kar [27] antigenicity prediction method showed seven regions with high antigenic scores. peptide GPSSQPY (a heptapeptide containg the amino acids from left to right: glycine, proline, serine, serine, serine, serine, glutamine, proline, tyrosine) was capable of inducing the desired immune response using B-cell epitopes. 3.33%) was scored by the peptide FAGHLKCRL (amino acid sequence reading from left to right: phenylalanine, alanine, glycine, histidine, leucine, lysine, cysteine, lysine, lysine, lysine, cysteine, arginine, leucine) out of the six total peptides recommended. conserved stretches are analyzed for their hydrophilicity to determine the surface situated peptides. the next step is to determine which ones have T-cell and B-cell epitopes. the remaining peptides that pass these tests are reported to be good candidates to act as peptide vaccines. integrating QSARs [62] could be extended to cover epitope binding. it has been found that using numerical indices derived from protein is simpler than having to work with the 3D protein structures [64,65], and could be extended to optimize the search for surface antigens. erroneous data can throw computations out of gear and cause a loss of precious time when dealing with infections of epidemic proportions. 4.3. Transition to wet lab. it is important to understand that translation of the bioinformatically-identified peptide to a working vaccine involves many steps. a dual core processor was still too long and had to be abandoned. the computational model, the processing power of the machine, and program efficiency are all factors to be considered when taking this approach to determine peptide vaccine targets. integrating QSARs [62] could be extended to cover epitope binding. adequate data are not available for the recently-emerged Zika virus, or the Ebola virus for that matter when it surfaced in a pathogenic epidemic form in 2015. wider dissemination could lead to more research and perhaps new insights. maintaining high quality and data integrity must be a prime requisite for numerical analyses. peptide vaccine discovery is a relatively new field, where many aspects are still in progress. computer-assisted approaches appear to show good promise for peptide vaccine identification strategies."}
