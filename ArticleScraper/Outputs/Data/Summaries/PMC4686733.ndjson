{"summary": "in 1885 two physicians invented a \u201crespiration system\u201d which could be considered as a first prototype of a heart-lung machine. this machine was intended to be used for basic research and not for open heart operations. it was a milestone in cardiac surgery together with the development of surface hypothermia by Bigelow (1954) there are some clinical studies on children with complex cardiac malformations operated in early childhood. the flow generated by the heart-lung machine usually has a constant and mostly laminar flow profile. this is in contrast to our own cardiovascular system which produces a pulsatile blood flow. stroke and TIA may be attributed to clots embolizing the A. cerebri media area. ischemia and reperfusion injury have a negative impact on the post-operative outcome. ischemia and reperfusion induce several signaling cascades. these signaling cascades are involved in regulatory mechanism of cell survival and cell death finally leading to potential organ dysfunction. in the past decades several protection strategies have been applied to ensure greater safety during CPB. several drugs have been tested to reduce organ malfunction. minocycline is a broad spectrum antibiotic attributed to tetracycline class. it has neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. minocycline reduced ischemia-induced elevated TNF-levels. ocycline treatment for medical reasons is in the range of 1\u20132 mol/L. this is more than ten times higher than the reported concentration needed for sufficient PARP-inhibition. but at the moment patient studies to corroborate the protective effects of minocycline are missing. doxycycline derivate also has cytoprotective activities. 3-aminobenzamide was tested in a rabbit model of CPB (Yeh et al., 2006) the authors could demonstrate that PARP-inhibition resulted in a significant decrease in cytokine levels and as a consequence a reduction of ROS. another well-known PARP-inhibitor is PJ34, which is classified as a phenanthridinone. a clinical trial was initiated involving patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. in these patients INO-1001 seemed to decrease inflammatory reactions during recovery. however, frequently seen non-serious adverse events were described. thoracic aortic aneurysms with bicuspid aortic valves had different expression patterns compared to aortic aneurysms with tricuspid aortic valves. thoracic aortic aneurysms with bicuspid aortic valves had a different expression pattern of MMPs and TIMPs compared to tIMP-1 and TIMP-2. doxycycline, minocycline, and oxytetracycline are approved drugs. doxycycline was very effective in reducing MMP-9-, TNF-, and IL-1-levels. doxycycline also showed protective effects on lung damage after CPB. intracellular acidification activates the NHE which exchanges H+ ions against Na+. this would increase intracellular pH but finally will lead to an undesirable increase in intracellular sodium. also, due to a dropdown in ATP, Na+/K+-ATPase is inhibited which also contributes to elevated sodium levels. a rise in intracellular calcium was not seen and it was speculated that this was due to the inhibitory effect of H+ ions on the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. in a model of orthotopic heart transplantation cariporide led to a better ventricular recovery. the experimental group receiving cariporide was even worse compared to the control group without cariporide. a subsequent study of Scholz et al. (2003) found 53 high risk patients received 20, 80, or 120 mg cariporide. serum S-100B levels were measured prior to coronary artery bypass. intracellular calcium ions rise during myocardial infarction inducing calcium overload, hypercontraction of cardiac cells and cell death. blocking of the MPTP might be a useful tool to inhibit deleterious effects of permeability transition. taurine supplemented hearts exhibited less lipid peroxide formation, less mitochondrial damage and hence less necrotic myocardial cells. tetracycline has the ability to inhibit calcium-induced mitochondrial swelling during ischemia/reperfusion. in mitochondria from brain and spinal cord minocycline significantly inhibited mitochondrial swelling and calcium-uptake at high doses. at lower concentrations it almost increased the swelling response to elevated calcium levels. the exact mechanism of how minocycline exerts its protective effects still needs to be unraveled. the gallate of epigallocatechin (epigallocatechin-3-gallate, EGCG) was tested in various experimental settings of inflammation, cancer, and ischemia. in a rat model of myocardial infarction EGCG was successful in reducing infarct size and blocking nuclear translocation of the transcription factors NF-B and AP-1. ischemia and reperfusion injury could show that CPB is accompanied with severe lung alterations such as alveolar congestion, neutrophil infiltration, thickening of alveolar wall and decreased oxygen index. in a small patient trial Eren et al. (2003) reported on reduced MDA levels and on lower alveolar-arterial oxygen gradients in the group treated with NAC. nicorandil showed a significant improvement of outcome with less myocardial infarction in the nicorandil group. nicorandil used cold blood cardioplegic solution preserved myocardial function better than cold hyperkalemic crystalloid or hyperkalemic blood cardioplegia. the addition of aprikalim during cardioplegic arrest of the cultured cells improved cardiomyocyte contractile function and led to less calcium overload. a selective mitochondrial IKATP opener preserved mitochondrial function and morphology after cardioplegic arrest compared to control hearts. ic drug has been developed to treat supraventricular tachycardia. after intravenous application esmolol has a short half-life of 9 min. it is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma esterases, which makes it well manageable. a more recent study was about the application of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. patients in the treatment group had lower troponin and creatine kinase levels. the results of this patient trial were as follows: patients in the treatment group had lower troponin and creatine kinase levels. cardioplegic-solutions Heart protection during CPB was always a matter of debate. the heart is not perfused during cardiopulmonary arrest which means for the cardiac muscle a period of absolute ischemia. for the survival of myocardial tissue surface cooling is essential on one hand. only 17 patients in each group versus 250 patients in the study of Calafiore et al. (1995) a new Bretschneider cardioplegic solution (=Custodiol) was supplemented with L-arginin, N-acetyl-L-histidine, deferoxamine, and LK-614 (iron chelator) (=Custodiol-N) and showed protective effects with an improvement of myo PARP-inhibitors DNA-strand breaks occur during reperfusion phase when oxygen levels increase. resulting single strand DNA nicks are detected by PARP and labeled with PAR-chains. over-activation of PARP depletes NAD+ stores and finally leads to a reduction of ATP-levels. minocycline reduced ischemia-induced elevated TNF-levels in the brain. the same effect could be shown in liver, where minocycline significantly decreased hepatic TNF and IL-1 expression and improved liver function. 3-aminobenzamide, PJ34, or INO-1001 have been tested in ischemia and reperfusion. it was described in the eighties to inhibit PARP by about 90% in an in vitro assay. in the following years 3-aminobenzamide was used in experimental models of stroke, renal ischemia, myocardial infarction, or heart transplantation. INO-1001 showed cardioprotective and lung protective properties in a canine model of cardiopulmonary bypass injury. piglets of up to 10 kg were examined in a model of extracorporeal circulation. piglets of up to 10 kg were examined in a model of extracorporeal circulation. MMP-inhibitors A collagenolytic factor was first discovered 1962 by Gross and Lapiere when they investigated how tadpoles lose their tails during metamorphosis. this factor was later named MMP-1 and to date more than 20 different MMPs are discovered. a variety of cardiovascular diseases are related to a dysfunction of the MMPs. tetracyclines are potent MMP-inhibitors, these are minocycline, doxycycline and oxytetracycline (Schwartz et al., 2014). doxycycline was very effective in reducing MMP-9-, TNF-, and IL-1-levels and it also showed protective effects on lung damage after CPB. blocking of MMPs is a very useful tool in organoprotection during CPB. until now there is no MMP-inhibitor \u201cin the pipeline\u201d to effectively protect organs during CPB in a clinical setting. doxycycline, minocycline, and oxycycline are approved drugs. in the mammalian heart the NHE-1 is the predominant isoform. it has been found that its blockade is beneficial during ischemia and reperfusion injury. inhibition of the NHE-1 with cariporide led to significant fewer alterations in cardiac hemodynamics, a lower incidence of ventricular fibrillation and a less pronounced decrease in intracellular ATP. study with 3000 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery cariporide at the highest dose of 120 mg led to a significant reduction in death and myocardial infarction. the other doses tested (20 and 80 mg) had no beneficial effects neither on death nor myocardial infarction. mitochondria lose impermeability by opening the so-called permeability transition pore. this pore was first discovered by Hunter et al. (1976) who described a process induced by calcium ions during which the permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane increased. other factors, which induce MPT are free radicals, fatty acids or inorganic phosphate. cyclosporine to the cardioplegic solution is beneficial for heart protection. hearts treated with taurine recovered faster, had lower malondialdehyde levels, lower levels of pro-apoptotic factors and less mitochondrial alterations. the amino-acid-like substance taurine is typically found in high concentrations in cardiac and skeletal muscle, retina and central nervous system. the tetracycline derivative minocycline has the ability to inhibit calcium-induced mitochondrial swelling during ischemia/reperfusion. the mechanism proposed was the inhibition of the calcium-induced MPT opening, mitochondrial swelling and depolarization which led to a collapse of oxidative phosphorylation and cell necrosis. the exact mechanism of how minocycline exerts its protective effects still needs to be unraveled. the 2-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one ebselen, a selene derivative, has been found to significantly improve the neurological outcome in stroke patients. in a piglet bypass model with 120 min aortic clamping Chen et al. tested the effect of ebselen on cardiac protection. the deleterious effects of CPB could be prevented by EGCG. we could prove that hippocampal impairment was less in the experimental group treated with EGCG. 70 patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing CPB, NAC was applied up to the maximum dose starting 2 h before bypass. a significant lower incidence of acute renal failure in the NAC-receiving group was described. however, in other trials NAC failed to show protective effects on the kidney. nicorandil showed a significant improvement of outcome with less myocardial infarction in the nicorandil group. nicorandil used together with cold blood cardioplegic solution preserved myocardial function better than cold hyperkalemic crystalloid or hyperkalemic blood cardioplegia. esmolol is a class II antiarrhythmic drug which has been developed to treat supraventricular tachycardia. it is rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma esterases, which makes this drug well manageable. esmolol has been used during CPB in children. in a more recent study weak beneficial effects of vitamin E and C application before CPB were found but again significant positive effects on patient outcome were not apparent. another anti-oxidant substance,coenyme Q10, was used by makhija et al. (2008). dexamethasone was applied before CPB and levels of inflammatory molecules were measured in myocardial tissue. the results were in favor of the dexamethasone group as a certain myocardial protection was seen (lower troponin levels) with less requirement for catecholamines. both crystalloid and cold cardioplegic solutions are used for cardiac arrest. oxygenated blood supplemented with high potassium and magnesium is administered via the aortic root until cardiac arrest. new custodiol-N solution also showed protective effects with an improvement of myocardial function in a rat model of heterotopic heart transplantation. iron chelators (desferoxamine and LK-614) tended to have a negative impact on heart protection. there are still many promising substances, which have been positively tested in ischemia-reperfusion protocols. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
