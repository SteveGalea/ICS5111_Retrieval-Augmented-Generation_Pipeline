{"summary": "african swine fever (ASF) is a severe viral disease that manifests clinical symptoms of hemorrhagic fever caused by african swine fever virus (ASFV) it can result in case fatality rates of up to 100% in domestic pigs. since the second major incursion of the disease, initially into Georgia in 2007, the virus has continued to spread worldwide, including China. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR techniques have provided a supportive method to post-mortem ASF diagnosis. but they cannot be used for field (on-site) detection in pig farms. Isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification has been successfully used to detect multiple viral pathogens. the protocol for this study was approved by the ethics committee of the Military Veterinary Research, Academy of Military Medical Sciences. the viruses were inactivated in the BSL-3 Lab, and the inactivated samples were transferred to the BSL-2 Lab for genomic DNA extraction and detection. real-time qPCR assay TaqMan PCR was performed to detect ASFV p72. sequences spanning the RPA amplification region were obtained through PCR. sequences spanning the RPA amplification region were obtained through PCR. all the reagents were prepared in a master mix, which was aliquoted into each tube of a 0.2 mL tube strip containing a dried enzyme pellet. Magnesium acetate (2.5 L) was pipetted slowly into the tube lids, and magnesium acetate was centrifuged into the tubes by using a mini-spin centrifuge. samples were collected in accordance with the protocols for viral hemorrhagic fever. the viruses were inactivated in the BSL-3 lab. samples were transferred to the BSL-2 lab for genomic DNA extraction. whole genome sequence of p72 genotype II virus was used as reference sequence for RPA primer selection. real-time PCR primers for p72 were used as described before. sequences spanning the RPA amplification region were obtained through PCR. all the reagents (500 nM RPA primers, 120 nM RPA probe, 4 rehydration buffer, and purified H2O) were prepared in a master mix, which was aliquoted into each tube of a 0.2 mL tube strip containing a dried enzyme pellet. 2 L of the sample DNA was added to the tubes, and the dipstick was inserted into 100 L of the sample buffer for 3\u20135 min. real-time PCR conditions yielded the highest amplification efficiency. real-time PCR conditions were 94\u00b0C for 5 min and 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s and 55\u00b0C for 30 s. a positive signal was detected in aSFV-SY18 and aSFV-JL18. the measured DNA band density revealed that the DNA yield doubled after a reaction time of 10 min and increased slightly after 15 min. the intensity of the DNA bands in agarose gel did not significantly change at reaction times of 15, 20, 25 and 30 min. however, the false positive test lines appeared when the reaction time was more than 15 min. sensitivity was 150 copies per reaction of the standard plasmid. positive ASFV RPA reaction products could be detected on the stained agarose gel (2%) the real-time PCR conditions yielded the highest amplification efficiency. the real-time PCR assay was sufficiently sensitive to detect 102 copies per reaction. no cross-reactions with PRRSV/CH1R, CSFV/Shimen, PRV/JL14, JEV/SA14-14-2, PEDV/CV777, and PCV2b-SD12 were observed. yield doubled after a reaction time of 10 min and increased slightly after 15 min. the intensity of the DNA bands in agarose gel did not significantly change at reaction times of 15, 20, 25 and 30 min. however, the false positive test lines appeared when the reaction time was more than 15 min. 145 samples included 90 spleen samples and 55 blood samples of animals. of these samples, 5 spleen tissues and 5 blood samples were positive for ASFV nucleic acid. the detection results were consistent with those of real-time PCR. laboratory testing with TaqMan real-time PCR is being widely used in affected areas. different isothermal molecule amplification assays have been developed. chimeric DNA/LNA-based biosensor takes less than 20 min at 38\u00b0C to complete. cross-priming amplification combined with immune-chromatographic strips for rapid on-site detection of ASFV. reaction conditions include 60 min at 59\u00b0C and six primers for a reaction system, thereby causing non-specific amplification. sensitivity of assay is 100-fold lower than genomic amplification. we evaluated a rapid RPA-LFD test for the rapid diagnosis of ASFV. the superior performance of RPA-LFD for ASFV and its consistent detection results with those of real-time PCR indicated its appropriateness for laboratory diagnosis and that it has great potential for on-site testing of ASFV circulating in China. financial relationships that could be construed as a conflict of interest."}
