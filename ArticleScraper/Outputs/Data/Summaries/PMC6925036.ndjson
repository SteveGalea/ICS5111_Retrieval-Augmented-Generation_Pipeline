{"summary": "the current study investigated the prevalence and risk factors of BRSV in cattle in the Nineveh Province, Iraq. the prevalence of BRSV was 83.11%, and it was significantly (p0.05) higher in cattle aged greater than 7 months-1.5 years than in older animals. BRSV infection leads to sudden fever, rhinitis, cough, respiratory distress, abdominal breathing, and decreased appetite. prevalence of BRSV in cattle ranged from 28% to 70%, depending on animal age and environmental conditions. BRSV occurs in most countries worldwide and affects cattle of all ages. 450 blood samples collected from animals were processed to extract the serum. samples showing values 20% were considered negative, while those showing values between 21% and 40% were considered positive. blood samples collected from animals were processed to extract the serum. samples showing values 20% were considered negative, while those showing values between 21% and 40% were considered positive. BRSV prevalence in the nineveh governorate was 83.11%. samples collected in the winter showed the highest prevalence of BRSV (RR=1.38) compared to those collected in the spring, summer, or fall (85.09%, 83.18%, and 75.18% respectively) Table-1. Relative risk factors associated with the prevalence of bovine respiratory syncytial virus. the overall prevalence of BRSV in the nineveh governorate was 83.11%. higher or lower prevalence was recorded in other countries. high variation in the prevalence estimates may be due to several factors such as differences in the disease management, laboratory methods, geographical region, and disease control programs. the current report is the first epidemiological investigation of BRSV prevalence among cattle in the Nineveh Province, Iraq. our results revealed a high prevalence of the disease in the cattle of this region and identified several risk factors associated with BRSV infection."}
