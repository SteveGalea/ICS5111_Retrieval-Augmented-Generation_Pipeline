{"summary": "severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) resulted in 10% mortality during the 2002-2003 epidemic (23) this elevated overall mortality resulted in part from a low survival rate (50%) in young (24 years old) infected patients (23) one mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV, MA15, is especially useful for pathogenesis studies since it causes severe disease in aged mice of all strains (24) mortality in 12- to 22-month-old mice infected with SARS-CoV or IAV was reduced from 80 to 100% by treatment with a TLR3 agonist, poly(IC), with concomitant increased expression of interferon and other proinflammatory molecules. mortality in 12- to 22-month-old mice was reduced from 80 to 100% by treatment with a TLR3 agonist, poly(IC) lungs were removed into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and homogenized using a manual homogenizer. titers are expressed as PFU/g tissue for SARS-CoV and TCID50/ml for IAV. epithelia were prepared from bronchial cells and maintained at the air-liquid interface on porous filters as described previously (11) cells were then grown in serum-free media for 72 h. poly(IC) (1 g/ml) was then applied both apically and basolaterally to cells 4 h prior to MA15 infection. SARS-CoV-specific peptides S436 (HNYKYRYL) and S525 (VNFNFNGL) were synthesized by BioSynthesis Inc. (Lewisville, TX) for tetramer staining, cells were stained for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. 106 cells were blocked with 1 g anti-CD16/32 antibody. rat anti-mouse IFN- (XMG1.2; from eBioscience); and rat anti-mouse I-A/I-E (M5/114.15.2; from Biolegend) all flow cytometry data were acquired on a BD FACSCalibur. mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and infected intranasally with 1 105 PFU of SARS-CoV or 1,066 tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50) of IAV. lungs were removed into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and homogenized. in some experiments, 80 g poly(IC) was delivered by the intraperitoneal (i.p.), subcutaneous (s.c.) or intravenous (i.v.) route in 200 l PBS. well-differentiated primary cultures of human airway epithelia were prepared from bronchial cells and maintained at the air-liquid interface on collagen-coated porous filters. live cells were enumerated by 0.2% trypan blue exclusion. tetramers were synthesized by bioSynthesis Inc. (Lewisville, TX) hamster anti-mouse CD11c (HL3), rat anti-mouse CD16/32 (2.4G2), rat anti-mouse Siglec F (E50-2440), rat anti-mouse Ly-6C (AL-21), rat anti-mouse IFN- (XMG1.2; from eBioscience); and rat anti-mouse I-A/I-E (M5/114.15.2; from Biolegend) agonists for TLR3 (poly(IC), TLR4 (LPS), TLR7/8 (R484), and TLR9 (CpG) infected aged mice with 105 PFU. all mice developed histological evidence of severe pneumonia (25, 33) n = 17 mice in the PBS group, 13 in the poly(IC) group, 6 in the LPS group, 7 in the CpG group, and 8 in the R848 group. to obtain virus titers, lungs were homogenized and virus titers determined on Vero E6 cells. aged mice infected with MA15 develop severe pneumonia and acute lung injury (ALI) as detected by histological examination. poly(IC) treatment reduces pulmonary edema and accelerates inflammatory cell infiltration into lungs. intranasal infection with 1 105 PFU MA15 virus. Lungs removed at indicated time points p.i., fixed in zinc formalin. sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. antibody treatment prevented neutrophil infiltration into the infected lungs. blocking neutrophil migration did not protect 12-month-old mice from lethal SARS-CoV. poly(IC) treatment enhances rDC migration and T cell responses in the lungs of aged mice. 12-month-old mice were treated with poly(IC) or PBS 2 h before intranasal inoculation of 50 l 8 mM CFSE. four h after CFSE instillation, mice were infected with 1 105 PFU MA15 virus. two interferon-stimulated genes with antiviral effects were also upregulated in poly(IC)-treated lungs. this delay in expression resulted in a response that was too late to inhibit virus replication sufficiently to prevent disease. the effects of poly(IC) were mediated, at least in part, by TLR3. 50% of the 12-month-old TLR3/ mice succumbed to the infection. twenty-two-month-old, but not 12-month-old, mice develop a fatal infection after infection with this strain of IAV. treatment with poly(IC) 6 h prior to infection was partially protective (approximately 60% survival), and protection was increased to 90% if mice were treated at both 6 and 48 h prior to infection. twenty-two-month-old B6 mice were treated with poly(IC) 48 and 6 h prior to intranasal infection with 1,066 TCID50 of IAV. RNA was extracted from lungs at the indicated time points and processed as described in Materials and Methods. Lungs were removed at the indicated time points p.i., fixed in zinc formalin. sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. arrows indicate necrotic debris. 1.6 mg poly(ICLC) was administered to healthy volunteers. treatment resulted in an immune response that was similar to that observed after vaccination with an attenuated viral vaccine. administration of poly(IC) 3 days prior to infection protected 80% of mice from lethal infection. twenty-two-month-old mice were treated with 80 g poly(IC) in 200 l PBS i.p., i.v., or s.c. 6 h before infection. weight loss and mortality were monitored daily. poly(IC) treatment protects 12- and 22-month-old B6 mice from lethal SARS-CoV infection. mortality in 12- to 22-month-old B6 mice infected with as little as 104 PFU of SARS-CoV was 80 to 100%. twenty-two-month-old mice are highly susceptible to many respiratory virus infections, including SARS-CoV and IAV (5, 31, 33) poly(IC) pretreatment was protective in 22-month-old mice infected with MA15-infected aged B6 mice. airway and alveolar epithelial lung cells are major targets for SARS-CoV in both infected patients and mice infected with strain MA15 (9, 21, 24). poly(IC) reduced virus titers by 100-fold after 48 h (P 0.005) suggesting that airway epithelial cells are a target for poly(IC) during the infection. poly(IC) treatment reduces pulmonary edema and accelerates inflammatory cell infiltration into SARS-CoV-infected lungs. some edema was observed at this time p.i. in the poly(IC)-treated mice. treatment with poly(IC)-treated mice resulted in increased numbers of total infiltrating lung cells at days 2 and 4 p.i. rDC and alveolar macrophages were specifically increased at these early times p.i. in poly(IC)-treated mice. rDC migration to draining lymph nodes (DLN) was impaired in 12-month-old mice. poly(IC) treatment resulted in increased rDC migration to draining lymph nodes. a result of deficient rDC migration was a greatly reduced T cell response. poly(IC) treatment results in earlier expression of several proinflammatory molecules, including IFN-, IFN-, RIG-I, MDA-5, and Stat1. genes encoding protein kinase R (PKR) and 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS), were also upregulated in poly(IC)-treated lungs. this delay in expression resulted in a response that was too late to inhibit virus replication sufficiently to IFN-, IFN-, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, or GM-CSF were protective. only poly(IC)-mediated protection was dependent upon both IFN-/-dependent and independent pathways. n = 9 in the PBS group, 6 in the IFN- group, 6 in the IL-1 group, 8 in the IL-6 group, 8 in the IL-6 group, 8 in the IL-12 group, 6 in the IL-12 group, and 6 in the GM-CSF group. poly(IC) treatment protects 22-month-old mice from lethal IAV infection. poly(IC) or cytokine treatments protect 22-month-old mice from lethal IAV infection. twenty-two-month-old B6 mice were treated with 20 g poly(IC), IFN- (2,000 U), or IFN- (200 ng) 6 h or 6 and 48 h before infection with IAV. weight loss and mortality were monitored daily. by day 4 p.i., peribronchial/perivascular infiltration and airway obstruction were detected in poly(IC)-treated IAV-infected mice. disease progressed in these mice so that by day 8, widespread alveolar and airway edema was present. treatment with poly(IC) resulted in increased numbers of total infiltrating lung cells at day 4 p.i. compared to PBS-treated IAV-infected mice. however, numbers of infiltrating inflammatory cells plateaued in poly(IC)-treated mice as disease resolved. twelve-month-old mice were treated with poly(IC) 6 h before infection. weight loss and mortality were monitored daily. n = 7 mice in the PBS group, 6 in the i.v. group, 8 in the i.p. group, and 6 in the s.c. group treated 12- or 22-month-old mice with poly(IC) by intraperitoneal (i.p.), intravenous (i.v.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) inoculation prior to infection with SARS-CoV. intranasal treatment with TLR agonists, especially poly(IC), is efficacious in aged animals infected with IAV or SARS-CoV. poly(IC), by activating the innate immune response, is able to prime. protection was mediated in large part by IFN induction by TLR3-dependent and TLR3-independent pathways. most cells express TLR3 and the cytosolic RNA helicase sensors RIG-I and MDA-5, so they could be targeted by poly(IC) asally delivered poly(IC) should be investigated for prophylaxis in aged populations at high risk for severe virus respiratory infections. no other therapeutic options are available in settings like the SARS epidemic."}
