{"summary": "most viral danger signals are derived from oligonucleotide structures exposed during the replication of the viral genomes [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. most viruses produce proteins that antagonize and effectively delay signaling by the primary viral oligonucleotide sensor molecules retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation\u2013associated gene 5. stocks of Sendai virus (SeV) with a high content of copy-back DVGs with interfering activity trigger enhanced production of cytokines in vitro. the group has also demonstrated that in contrast to standard viral genomes, SeV copy-back DVGs induce the expression of MDA5 and of a number of other interferon-stimulated genes. one predominant copy-back genome was present in cells infected with SeV Cantell HD (amplicon of 278 bp) no copy-back defective genome was detected in cells infected with SeV cantell LD up to six hours after infection. WT and Ifnar1/ BMDCs were infected with SeV cantell HD (HD), SeV cantell LD (LD) or NDV (moi = 1.5 TCID50/cell) total RNA was extracted at 2 and 6 h post-infection and analyzed for the presence of DVGs and standard virus genome (gSeV) by PCR. we cloned DVG-546 under the control of the T7 polymerase promoter. for this purpose we used seV strain 52 that normally does not produce highly immunostimulatory copy-back DVGs [24]. rDVGs significantly reduced the expression of SeV Np mRNA. DVGs accumulate at a high rate in infected cells and are associated with the induction of the antiviral responses. RNAs were transfected into cells before or after treatment with phosphatase or with RNase A that cleaves 3\u2032 of single stranded C and U residues. both genomic RNA and DVG RNA were susceptible to treatment with phosphatase, as well as to treatment with RNases. LLC-MK2 cells were transfected with the indicated doses of genomic RNA and DVG RNA. after 4 h, total RNA was extracted and the quantities of Ifnb mRNA, gSeV, and DVG were determined by RT-qPCR. DVGs were only detected in cells infected with SeV cantell HD at 6 h post-infection. differences in the net input amount of viral RNA cannot explain the more than >1000 fold difference in the expression of Ifnb mRNA between cells infected with equivalent infectious doses. MAVS was not required for the response to herpes simplex virus. only DVG RNA, but not standard viral genomes, could be amplified from endogenous RIG-I and MDA5 complexes immunoprecipitated from infected cells. association of DVGs with RLRs correlated with type I IFN induction. seV strains that accumulate copy-back DVGs early in infection induced faster Ifnb mRNA expression in vitro than viruses with delayed DVG accumulation by 2 h post-infection. all the viruses were used at a multiplicity of infection of 1.5 TCID50/cell. BMDCs were infected with SeV strain Z or SeV cantell LD. RNA was extracted at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h post-infection. gene expression is shown as copy number relative to the housekeeping genes Tuba1b and Rps11. infection in the presence of DPs resulted in reduced expression of SeV NP protein in the lung at day 7 post-infection. DPs reduce virulence by interfering with virus replication. mice were infected with 105 TCID50/mouse of SeV cantell HD (HD) or SeV cantell LD (LD) copy-back DVGs generated in the lung promote the expression of antiviral cytokines. a copy-back DVG of high molecular weight was detected at day 3 post-infection. a DVG of low molecular weight was only detectable at day 5 post-infection. BMDCs from IFN-YFP mice were infected with a moi of 1.5 TCID50/cell of SeV Cantell LD alone. total RNA from the YFP positive and negative fractions was extracted and analyzed for copy-back DVGs and standard viral genomes by PCR. we infected wild type or type I IFN receptor deficient mice with SeV cantell LD. we then analyzed viral genomes in YFP+ cells. this suggests that the presence of DVGs promotes IFN production in response to virus infection. the stock of IAV PR8 HD produced two predominant DVGs. no DVGs were detected in cells infected with IAV PR8 LD. the stock produced two predominant DVGs derived from the PA and PB1 genomic segments. PR8 LD were analyzed at day 1 (D1) and day 3 (D3) post-infection. expression of Ifnb mRNA in whole lung homogenates analyzed by RT-qPCR. copy-back DVGs were prepared from the same parental virus. one predominant copy-back genome was present in cells infected with SeV Cantell HD. no copy-back defective genome was detected in cells infected with SeV cantell LD up to six hours after infection. WT and Ifnar1/ BMDCs were infected with SeV cantell HD (HD), SeV cantell LD (LD) or NDV (moi = 1.5 TCID50/cell) total RNA was extracted at 2 and 6 h post-infection and analyzed for the presence of DVGs and standard virus genome (gSeV) by PCR. we cloned DVG-546 under the control of the T7 polymerase promoter. we used this construct to prepare a SeV stock containing a single recombinant DVG (rDVG) for this purpose we cloned DVG-546 under the control of the T7 polymerase promoter. DVGs accumulate at a high rate in infected cells and are associated with the induction of the antiviral responses. RNAs were transfected into cells before or after treatment with phosphatase or with RNase A that cleaves 3\u2032 of single stranded C and U residues. both genomic RNA and DVG RNA were susceptible to treatment with phosphatase, as well as to treatment with RNases. LLC-MK2 cells were transfected with 250 ng of control or treated RNAs and analyzed 4 h after transfection by RT-qPCR. total RNA was extracted and the quantities of Ifnb mRNA, gSeV, and DVG were determined by RT-qPCR. V cantell LD compared with 10 times less SeV cantell HD at 6 h post-infection. differences in the net input amount of viral RNA cannot explain the more than >1000 fold difference in the expression of Ifnb mRNA between cells infected with equivalent infectious doses. protein mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) was required for the activation of transcription factors IRF3 and NF-B and for expression of numerous antiviral and pro-inflammatory molecules upon infection with herpes simplex virus. only DVG RNA, but not standard viral genomes, could be amplified from endogenous RIG-I and MDA5 complexes immunoprecipitated from infected cells. seV strains that accumulate copy-back DVGs early in infection induced faster Ifnb mRNA expression in vitro than viruses with delayed DVG accumulation by 2 h post-infection. all the viruses were used at a multiplicity of infection of 1.5 TCID50/cell. BMDCs were infected with SeV strain Z or SeV cantell LD. RNA was extracted at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h post-infection and analyzed for the presence of DVGs and gSeV. RNA was extracted at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h post-infection. pathogenicity of SeV cantell LD in mice, while UV-inactivated DP particles did not provide significant protection. infection in the presence of DPs resulted in reduced expression of SeV NP protein in the lung at day 7 post-infection. copy-back DVGs generated in the lung promote the expression of antiviral cytokines. a copy-back DVG of high molecular weight was detected at day 3 post-infection in the lung. a DVG of low molecular weight was only detectable at day 5 post-infection. expression of Ifnb mRNA in whole lung homogenates was analyzed by RT-qPCR. BMDCs from IFN-YFP mice were infected with a moi of 1.5 TCID50/cell of SeV Cantell LD alone. total RNA from the YFP positive and negative fractions was extracted and analyzed for copy-back DVGs and standard viral genomes by PCR. DPs alone were also able to induce YFP in a dose-dependent manner, albeit at much lower levels than during co-infection with SeV. we infected wild type or type I IFN receptor deficient mice with SeV cantell LD and analyzed the lungs at different times post-infection. IFNs are not required for the generation of copy-back DVGs in vivo. the stock of IAV PR8 HD produced two predominant DVGs. no DVGs were detected in cells infected with IAV PR8 LD. Lungs from mice infected with IAV PR8 LD were analyzed at day 1 (D1) and day 3 (D3) post-infection. expression of Ifnb mRNA in whole lung homogenates analyzed by RT-qPCR. viral quasispecies have been shown to be essential for viral fitness and virulence. the differential DVG requirement may be explained by poor adaptation of the avian NDV to grow in mice while the murine SeV is fully adapted to grow in this species. we have reported that SeV cantell HD, but not NDV, has the ability to induce the expression of the viral sensor MDA5 independently of type I IFN feedback [27]. the newly synthetized MDA5 is involved in the recognition of SeV DVGs, regardless of type I IFN feedback. highly immunostimulatory SeV DVGs are of the copy-back type. enhanced production of type I IFNs in response to DVGs likely contributes to dampened viral replication. the role of naturally arising DVGs in promoting virus persistence in vivo remains to be investigated. we have demonstrated that DVGs arise naturally during an acute respiratory virus infection. the recognition of DVGs as stimuli has multiple practical implications. IFN-YFP reporter mice (B6.129-Ifnb1tm1Lky/J) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories.
