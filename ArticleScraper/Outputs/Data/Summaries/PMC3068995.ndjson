{"summary": "IAV attaches to host cells by binding of its major surface protein, the hemagglutinin (HA), to sialic acids, which are omnipresent on the glycolipids and glycoproteins exposed on the surfaces of cells. knowledge about the repertoire of endocytic pathways that can successfully be used by IAV will increase our insights into cell and species tropism. studies in which CME was obstructed by pharmacological or genetic intervention indicated the ability of IAV to enter host cells via alternative endocytic routes [4], [6], [7] also live cell imaging revealed the simultaneous availability of entry routes involving non-coated as well as clathrin-coated pits [4]. however, this alternative IAV entry route has not been characterized in any detail and requirements for specificity in receptor usage have not been established. pathways that are constitutive in one cell type may be absent or inducible by specific experimental conditions in other cell types. entry assay conditions allow dissecting cell entry into a dynamin-dependent (DYNA-DEP) and a dynamin-independent (DYNA-IND) component. the combined expression of the viral polymerase subunits and NP will drive transcription of luciferase mRNA from the negative strand vRNA and subsequent synthesis of Gaussia luciferase. dynasore, a small molecule inhibitor of the GTPase dynamin 2 crucial for endocytic vesicle formation in clathrin- and caveolin-mediated endocytosis. infection was performed in 0.2% DMSO (upper row panels) or in presence of 10 nM BafA1 (lower row panels) the nucleus was visualized by DNA staining with TOPRO-3 (red). in absence of inhibitor, IAV localized to the nucleus after 3 hrs. new virus particles spread to the cytoplasm after 6 hrs. two hours after infection 10 nM BafA1 was added to block any further entry. BafA1 specifically inhibits IAV during the entry phase. the continuous presence of 10 nM BafA1 for 16 hrs completely prevents infection. the addition of BafA1 at 1 hr or 2 hrs post infection resulted in high levels of luciferase activity. the indirect Gluc-entry assay was next tested for its capacity to examine the effects of specific inhibitors on IAV entry. dynasore or BafA1 were included in the medium (DMEM containing 10% FCS) during entry (the first 2 h of infection) and were removed when the inoculum was replaced by growth medium containing BafA1. dynasore completely inhibited entry in PBS, inclusion of 5% and 10% FCS resulted in increasing levels of dynasore resistant entry. this effect was not caused by inactivation of dynasore during the experiment as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was still sensitive to 80 M dynasore in the presence of 10% FCS. serum induces a Dynasore resistant entry route. entry was determined in presence of increasing concentrations of FCS. DYNA-DEP entry was determined in PBS and DYNA-IND entry in PBS containing 10% FCS and 80 M dynasore (80 DY) both pathways appear to be equally sensitive to de-sialylation of cells. entry into HeLa cells was performed in the absence or presence of 10% FCS in the absence or presence of 80 M dynasore (DY) the entry medium was replaced by growth medium (DMEM with 10% FCS and 10 nM BafA1) the cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained with a monoclonal antibody against NP. entry of DYNA-IND VLPs of both IAV strains was severely inhibited by dynasore when no serum was added to the inoculum. dynasore blocked access of BlaM1 to its CCF2 substrate in the cytoplasm. serum-inducible DYNA-IND entry was analyzed in HeLa cells. siRNA treated cells were infected with the pseudovirus WSN-Ren. entry of pseudovirus WSN-Ren (MOI 0.5) was reduced by 50% to 70%. a DYNA-IND entry pathway can be induced by serum in different cell types from several species. the evidence was obtained using both replication-dependent (Gluc-entry assay and immunodetection of infected cells). six kinase inhibitors appeared to act non-discriminatively, inhibiting both DYNA-DEP and DYNA-IND entry. the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors Ro 31-8220, rottlerin (both displaying moderate cytotoxicity, result not shown) and hypericin. four of the inhibitors thus appeared to induce significant inhibition of post-entry processes. -1 and HBDDE appeared to have a specific inhibitory effect on DYNA-IND entry. none of the 15 compounds induced >2-fold inhibition when added post-entry (at t = 2 hr post infection) the kinase library screen was repeated on human epithelial lung carcinoma cells. all kinase inhibitors were also screened on A549 cells. black and grey bars correspond to DYNA-DEP and DYNA-IND entry. for some inhibitors higher concentrations may be required for efficient inhibition of their specific target. DYNA-IND entry in PBS (A) or DYNA-DEP IAV entry (in PBS, 10% FCS and 80 M dynasor) were examined for their effect on actin polymerization/depolymerization. similar experiments were performed for GFP fusion proteins with dominant-negative and wildtype MLCK (MLCK DN and MLCK wt) and Myosin II-tail domain (MyoII-tail) or MyoII-head domain (MyoII-head) transfected cells were infected under DYNA-DEP (PBS, 10% FCS and 80 M dynasor) entry conditions. Rab5 is a small GTPase found in association with several endosome compartments. it is crucial for the function and maturation of early endosomes. it is required for the trafficking of a wide range of endocytic cargo following different routes, including DYNA-DEP and DYNA-IND routes. studies on macropinocytosis are hampered by lack of specific inhibitors. amiloride and the more potent derivative EIPA are inhibitors of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) and several other Na+/H+ antiporters. redundancy of DYNA-DEP and DYNA-IND entry pathways in 10% FCS using the luc-entry assay. the effect of 80 M dynasore (DY; red), 80 M EIPA (orange) or 80 M of both inhibitors (DY+EI; green) in the presence of 10% FCS is shown. FITC labeled dextran (Fdx) into relatively large vesicles (0.3 to 5 M) has often been applied as a morphological marker for macropinosomes. at high magnification and at color settings adjusted to higher intensity it could be seen that these Fdx granules were free of actin staining (by phalloidin) indicating that they were in the lumen of vesicles (result not shown) transferrin uptake was affected by dynasore, but not by EIPA. serum induces uptake of dextran into vesicles by combined action of serum and IAV. DYNA-IND entry of IAV depends on PAK1 and src Macropinocytosis has been implicated in the entry of several viruses. differences in susceptibility to inhibitors suggest that distinct forms of macropinocytosis might be used by different viruses. activated CDC42 and Rac1 can induce actin rearrangements independently of PAK1 [34], [40]\u2013[43] by direct interaction with WASP or WAVE family proteins. however, inhibitors of CDC42 (Pirl1 [46], Rac1 (NSC23766 [47]) or N-WASP (wiskostatin [48] did not display inhibitory effects on DYNA-IND or DYNA-DEP entry of IAV. inhibitors of PAK1 (40 M IPA-3), src (10 M PP2) or HSP90 (5 M aa-geldanamycin (GELD) were examined for their effect on DYNA-DEP (A) or DYNA-IND (B) entry using the Gluc-entry assay (HeLa cells; strain WSN; MOI 0.5; pre-incubation with inhibitors from 1 hr prior to infection to 2 hrs p.i luciferase reporter assay for quantitative analysis of IAV entry. 20 hours prior to infection HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid (pHH-Gluc) allowing constitutive synthesis of a negative strand viral RNA (vRNA) encoding a Gaussia luciferase under control of the untranslated regions of the NP segment of Influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1). luciferase reporter assay for quantitative analysis of IAV entry. cells were transfected with the IAV reporter plasmid pHH-Gluc 24 hrs before infection. inhibitors were added at 1 hr before infection with IAV. confocal fluorescence microscopy examined the effect of 10 nM BafA1 on subcellular localization of IAV particles. cells were grown on glass cover slips and infected with IAV (strain WSN; MOI of 10) and fixated after 30 min, 3 hrs or 6 hrs. inhibitor-containing medium was replaced with medium containing 10 nM BafA1. cells were incubated for a further 14 hrs to allow quantitative expression of luciferase activity (y-axes; RLU relative to the control infection without inhibitor) dynasore did not significantly inhibit IAV entry. dynasore or BafA1 were included in the medium (DMEM containing 10% FCS) during entry (the first 2 h of infection) and were removed when the inoculum was replaced by growth medium containing 10 nM BafA1 to prevent any further entry of virus. entry was indirectly quantified by determination of luciferase activity. sore demonstrates that under these experimental conditions IAV is able to enter cells via a pathway that is fully redundant to any dynamin-dependent (DYNA-IND) entry route. also when IAV travels via this novel dynamin-independent route, IAV apparently enters via low pH compartments as entry is fully sensitive to BafA1. the kinetics of the DYNA-DEP and DYNA-IND entry pathways were compared. entry via the DYNA-IND pathway (the only pathway available in PBS) was slower. the difference was most prominent after 15 min, while after 4 hrs similar levels were reached. DYNA-DEP entry was determined in PBS and DYNA-IND entry in PBS containing 10% FCS and 80 M dynasore (80 DY) both pathways appear to be equally sensitive to de-sialylation of cells. cells of mammalian and avian origin were infected for 2 hours at an MOI of 1 in PBS with or without serum. after 2 hours the entry medium was replaced by growth medium containing 10% FCS and 10 nM BafA1 and the expression of NP was examined after 14 hours later. a serum-inducible, DYNA-IND route of entry was thus functional in all five cell lines. the rapid and direct detection of entry was performed in the absence or presence of 10% FCS using VLPs containing HA and NA either from IAV-WSN (having a strict alpha 2\u20133 linked sialic acid binding specificity) the presence of 10% FCS rendered entry completely dynasore resistant. background fluorescence was subtracted from each measurement (geometric mean). data were normalized to VLP entry in Optimem without dynasore (DY) (red curve of panel A and and D) data were normalized to 18S RNA (RT-PCR) or tubulin protein levels and calculated relative to the levels obtained after transfection with a scrambled siRNA that served as a control. two different siRNAs had a significant inhibitory effect (48 hrs after siRNA transfection) on entry of the Renilla luciferase-encoding pseudovirus WSN-Ren [27] in the absence of FCS. six kinase inhibitors appeared to act non-discriminatively, inhibiting both DYNA-DEP and DYNA-IND entry. this allowed the independent inhibitor profiling of the novel pathway by avoiding the potentially masking effect of the presence of redundant entry pathways. cells were preincubated with the kinase inhibitors (10 M) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and then inoculated with virus (MOI 0.5) no specific DYNA-DEP entry inhibitors were identified. 15 inhibitors caused significant inhibition (>5-fold) of DYNA-IND entry. this included inhibitors of the calmodulin dependent kinases myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and CaMKII and seven inhibitors of different growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. DYNA-DEP entry conditions (entry in PBS; black bars) and DYNA-IND entry conditions (entry in PBS supplemented with 10% FCS and 80 M dynasore; grey bars) all inhibitors were added to cells that had not been treated with inhibitors during entry (in presence of 10% FCS) actin inhibitors were used at the minimal concentration required to induce clearly visible changes in the actin cytoskeleton as pre-determined by staining with FITC-phalloidin. all inhibitors as well as ML-7 and ML-9 significantly inhibited DYNA-IND entry by IAV. confocal images of HeLa cells expressing a wildtype Rab5-GFP fusion protein (Rab5 wt) or a dominant-negative mutant of a Rab5-GFP fusion protein (RAB5 DN; lower panel), inoculated with IAV (strain WSN; MOI 1). Similar experiments were performed for GFP fusion proteins with dominant-negative and wildtype MLCK (MLCK DN and MLCK wt) and Myo DN or MyoII-head (F) were infected at significantly lower levels via the DYNA-IND pathway while the DYNA-DEP pathway was not affected. plasmids encoding dominant negative or wildtype Rab5 fused to green fluorescent protein (Rab5 DN and Rab5 wt in Fig. 6) 24 h prior to infection with IAV. DYNA-IND IAV entry follows a pathway with similarities to macropinocytosis. studies on macropinocytosis are hampered by a lack of specific inhibitors, cargo, membrane markers and characteristic morphology. the DYNA-IND IAV entry pathway is EIPA sensitive. the effect of 80 M EIPA on DYNA-DEP (A) or DYNA-IND (B) entry was examined in the Gluc-entry assay. supernatant of cells inoculated in the presence of 80 M dynasore (DY), 80 M EIPA or 80 M of both inhibitors (DY+EI) in PBS (panel E) or PBS+10% FCS (panel F) after 2 hr the medium was replaced by growth medium containing 10% FCS and 10 nM BafA1. a characteristic of macropinocytosis is the nonselective uptake of large amounts of extracellular so a moderate, but reproducible shift to higher Fdx fluorescence was observed at 37\u00b0C when virus was added in presence of 10% FCS. such a shift was absent when no serum or virus was added. confocal microscopy showed that the combined presence of FCS and IAV increases the uptake of Fdx compared to FCS alone. serum induces the uptake of Fdx into large vesicles. this is consistent with the observed sensitivity of the serum-inducible DYNA-IND entry of IAV and VLPs to EIPA. a prominent downstream effect of these signaling cascades is the activation of p21 associated kinase 1 (PAK1) which in turn can activate a number of different pathways leading to actin network rearrangements. the results suggest a requirement for PAK1 in DYNA-IND entry of IAV that does not require activation by either CDC42 or Rac1. src inhibitor PP2 [52] specifically inhibited DYNA-IND entry of IAV. 17-AA-geldanamycin, a specific inhibitor of the chaperone protein HSP90, also caused specific inhibition of DYNA-IND entry. wiskostatin, NSC23766 or NSC23766 were added at t = 2 in order to check for their effect on replication we observed a dose-dependent inhibition by Pirl1 (60% inhibition at 12 uM) however, this pathway seems to play a crucial role in DYNA-IND entry by IAV. this pathway is independent of Rac1 or cdc42 but may require src, either upstream and/or downstream of PAK1. macropinocytosis is an inducible form of endocytosis by which fluid-phase cargo travels via non-coated, relatively large and heterogeneous organelles. this is especially important as different routes of IAV entry are likely to converge at some point in the endocytic pathway. DYNA-IND entry of IAV is similar, but not identical, to macropinocytic entry of other viruses. data for vaccinia virus are from [34] and for coxsackie B virus from [35]. the pathway requires the presence of serum factors in the entry medium. it results in the enhanced uptake of dextran and its co-localization with IAV in large vesicles. a number of RTKs have been shown to be involved in this process in different cell lines. the DYNA-IND route required the presence of 10% FCS in the entry assay medium. the DYNA-IND route required the presence of 10% FCS in the entry assay medium. the DYNA-IND route required the presence of 10% FCS in the entry assay medium. serum-inducible DYNA-IND entry was observed both in avian DF1 cells and in a human lung epithelial carcinoma cell line A549. dynasore (inhibiting DYNA-DEP entry) abolished entry whereas either drug alone had no effect. a redundancy in the utilization of CME and a clathrin-independent route for entry of IAV has been visualized by quantitative live cell imaging. a redundancy in the utilization of CME and a clathrin-independent route for entry of IAV has been visualized previously by quantitative live cell imaging. a function for the actin cytoskeleton in IAV entry was reported to be required for the entry into polarized epithelial cells but not for entry into non-polarized cells. the changes in actin network dynamics that can lead to the formation of macropinosomes can be triggered by a number of signal transduction cascades. strains of vaccinia virus were recently shown to induce their uptake by macropinocytosis via activation of either Rac1 or cdc42 [34]. cdc42 inhibitor pirl1 enhanced IAV entry and a similar effect was observed by wiskostatin, an inhibitor of N-WASP which functions directly downstream of cdc42. tyrosine kinase c-src has been shown to function as a key signaling intermediate in the induction of macropinocytosis via a mechanism independent of Rac1 or cdc42 [49]\u2013[51]. c-src has been shown to associate with macropinosomes [49], [51], while c-src kinase activity is required for macropinocytosis following EGF stimulation of HeLa cells vaccinia virus is able to trigger its own macropinocytic uptake [34], [43]. this does not exclude signaling induced by virus-host cell interactions. this is suggested by the significant increase of FITC-dextran uptake in presence of IAV. macropinocytosis has been described as a functional entry pathway of Haemophilus influenzae into primary human bronchial epithelial cells. the factors involved in signaling the process have not been identified yet. this has been studied in avian infections [72], [73] or by infection of mice with human-derived IAVs. MDCK cells were infected with IAV-WSN at a MOI of 0.02. supernatant was harvested after 48 hr of incubation at 37\u00b0C. cell debris was removed by centrifigutation (10 min at 2000 rpm) 293T cells were transfected using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with pCAGGS-BlaM1 (encoding a beta-lactamase reporter protein fused to the influenza matrix protein-1), pCAGGS-HA (encoding a beta-lactamase reporter protein fused to the influenza matrix protein-1) and pCAGGS-HA (encoding HA derived from either A/NewYork/1/1918 or IAV-W a unique SpeI \u2013 XbaI fragment of pGluc-basic was introduced into pHH-Fluc directly following the start codon of the Gaussia luciferase coding sequence. cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 10,000 cells/well and transfected the next day with 10 ng pHH-Gluc. the transfected cells were treated with inhibitors and infected as indicated. at 16 hr p.i. samples from the supernatant were assayed for luciferase activity using the Renilla Luciferase Assay system (Promega) FITC, GFP or Alexa Fluor 488 were excited at 488 nm, Alexa Fluor 568 at 568 nm, and TOPRO-3 at 633 nm. FITC-dextran uptake cells were grown in 24-well plates on glass coverslips. prior to FITC-dextran uptake cells were serum-starved for 2 hr in PBS. 3 ml ice-cold PBS followed by three washes with cold PBS and fixation with 3.7% PFA. 20,000 cells were analyzed by FACS and results were represented as mean fluorescence. effect of dynasore and EIPA on dextran and transferrin uptake was plotted relative to the mock-infection in PBS. the cells were inoculated with the WSN-Ren pseudovirus (MOI 0.5) in PBS. after 2 h of infection the entry medium was replaced by complete growth medium containing 10 nM BafA1 to prevent further entry. at 16 h post infection intracellular Renilla luciferase expression was determined as described above. FP [79] or myoII-tail or MyoII-head domain fused to GFP [80] 24 hr after transfection cells were inoculated with IAV-WSN (MOI 1) in PBS or in PBS containing 10% FCS and 80 M dynasore. 4 hr after infection cells were fixed and stained for examination by confocal microscopy. ferase pseudovirus (WSN-Ren) system has previously been described. the pseudovirus is produced in a MDCK cell line that expresses the HA of IAV-WSN. WR-LUC, a firefly luciferase encoding vaccinia virus was previously described. 293T cells were transfected using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with pCAGGS-BlaM1 (encoding a beta-lactamase reporter protein fused to the influenza matrix protein-1), pCAGGS-HA (encoding HA derived from either A/NewYork/1/1918 or IAV-WSN) and pCAGGS-NA (encoding HA derived from either A/BrevigMission/1/18 or unique SpeI and XbaI restriction sites were introduced into pHH-Fluc. the unique SpeI \u2013 XbaI fragment of pGluc-basic was cloned into the SpeI-XbaI site of pHH-Gluc. cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 10,000 cells/well. WR-LUC and VSV-FL were used to inoculate HeLa cells (10,000 cells/well) at an MOI of 2, in complete Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) after 7 hr the luciferase activity was detected using the SteadyGlo assay kit. FITC-dextran (MW70,000, Sigma-Aldrich) was incubated with HeLa cells in 500 l PBS. cells were washed 4 times with PBS at 4\u00b0C, fixed with 3.7% PFA in PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X-100 in PBS. on dextran and transferrin uptake cells were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 hr. the medium was replaced by PBS or PBS supplemented with 10% FCS containing IAV (strain WSN; MOI 10) and 0.5 mg/ml FITC-Dextran (Sigma; 70 kDa) cells were fixed and stained as described above and examined by confocal microscopy. post infection intracellular Renilla luciferase expression was determined. each siRNA experiment was performed in triplicate. cell viability was not affected as determined by performing a cell-viability assay. an unpaired Student's t-test was used for detemination of statistically significant differences. the use of the term significant in text refers to a comparison of values for which p0.05. additional data file (7.2MB, tif)."}
