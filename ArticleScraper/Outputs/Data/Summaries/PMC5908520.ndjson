{"summary": "outbreak response immunization (ORI) is recommended as an intervention. ORI campaigns routinely target children 6\u201359 months of age. a percentage reduction of the susceptible population will be below 1. if Re = 1.5 one must then reduce the susceptible fraction by 33%. at a minimum, the intervention should target the first age groups whose summed proportion of the susceptible population S exceeds 0.33/0.8 = 0.41. in the case of resurgent outbreaks, there may be insufficient data on which to base estimates of Re. the age distribution of the susceptible population is usually unknown at the start of a measles outbreak. historical surveillance data may be misleading with respect to the current distribution of susceptibles. however, uncertainty in these rates and historical incidence mean that these estimates will be highly uncertain in the best of circumstances. asles vaccine, while adopting a goal of measles elimination by the year 2000, started in 1992. the outbreak resulted in over 30 000 confirmed cases in So Paulo state. the outbreak itself resulted in over 30 000 confirmed cases in adults. a flexible approach to ORIs can better incorporate information gained in early stages of an outbreak to identify campaign age targets. we argue that unforeseen biases in clinical diagnosis can be mitigated through the incorporation of serological confirmation and high quality surveillance data. there were 16 age groups, the first 15 of which were 5-year age intervals [0, 5), [5, 10),..., [70, 75], with the last interval including all individuals 75 years and older. the transformed set of probabilities was modelled as a multivariate normal random variable. to this end, the transformed set of probabilities was modelled as a multivariate normal random variable. initial susceptible population We used the population age structure in 1996 and the history of vaccination prior to 1997. we modelled the number of susceptible individuals in each annual age class at the beginning of 1997 Sa,0 as a finite mixture of local susceptibles and excess susceptibles. we modelled excess susceptibles using a data augmentation approach. a latent number of susceptibles, constrained to a value uniformly distributed between zero and 1 million, were added to the model. this provided a means of accounting for infections that may not have been provided by a local population of susceptibles. the decay parameter allows for some flexibility in transmission dynamics. if there is little difference in the contact rate among age groups, the estimated will be close to one, while lower (higher) contact among disparate groups will result in estimates less (greater) than one. all models were fitted using a software package for the Python programming language. each model was sampled for 50 000 iterations using a Metropolis\u2013Hastings sampling algorithm. the first 40 000 samples were discarded conservatively as a warmup period. data was provided by the minist\u00e9rio da Sade (Ministry of Health) in brazil. fields included the county in which the case presented, reporting date, age in months or years, and the results (positive, negative or inconclusive) of a serological test for measles specific IgM. the transformed set of probabilities was modelled as a multivariate normal random variable. the transformation is the logit (logit(p) = log[p/(1 p)) which serves to convert probabilities (defined on the [0, 1] interval) to the real line. this was to allow confirmation rates to be correlated between neighbouring age groups, since the age boundaries were arbitrarily defined. we model local susceptibles as a binomial draw from the So Paulo population. where (vacc), (SIA) and (nat) are proportions of residual susceptibility following routine vaccination, supplemental immunization activities and natural immunity. we modelled the number of measles cases in each age class a and time step t as a Poisson random variable. we modelled the number of measles cases in each age class a and time step t as a random variable. [33] used population survey data to estimate contact rates within eight european countries. sensitivity analysis using a contact matrix for Brazil, calculated by [34] and is a constant, estimated as a random variable in the model. values closer to zero would eliminate age-specific transmission values. routine vaccination between 9 and 12 months of age assumes efficacy of the routine dose is 85% [31],1. SIAs conducted in 1987 and 1992 were conservatively assumed to result in 80% reduction of susceptibles in their targeted age classes [32] we modelled the number of measles cases in each age class a and time step t as a Poisson random variable. where Sa,t1 is the number of susceptibles in each age class a at time t 1, and Ba is the ath column of the who acquires infection from whom (WAIFW) matrix. model fitting Our model was fitted using data truncated at two different dates during the outbreak, to simulate the information state at June 15 and July 15, 1997. these two dates represent two contrasting levels of available monitoring data on which to potentially base intervention decisions. excluding potential lags in reporting, the model was fitted only to the information that would have been available at those time points. distribution of susceptibles is often wider [25] and wider age campaigns are often considered to reach larger proportion of susceptibles. both the estimate of Re and the age distribution of susceptibles are conditional on both date of the estimate (June or July) and the model used. for each model, we calculated the necessary vaccination threshold assuming a campaign that achieves 90% coverage of the target population. 40 years were significantly more likely to be IgM positive (greater than 50%) the estimated proportion of suspected measles cases in each 5 year age group that were IgM positive. the best fit model for 15 June data yields an estimate of R0 = 57 (95% credible interval: 54\u201360) estimated total number of susceptible individuals in each age class based on data observed on 15 July using the age confirmation model (red) and the clinical only model (blue) effective reproduction number Re was estimated to be clearly greater than 1 for both 15 June and 15 July using the age confirmation model. posterior distribution of Re estimates shifts target range to 8\u201324%. neither confirmation model predicts a 5-and-under strategy to be sufficient. in all cases, ORI strategies that target individuals up to 15 or 30 years of age, as well as a mixed strategy that targets children under 5 and adults between 20 and 30 years of age are predicted to be sufficient to stop the outbreak. relying on clinical confirmation alone can significantly bias inference about transmission rate (Re) and the minimal vaccination targets required to stop an outbreak. relying on clinical confirmation alone can significantly bias inference about transmission rate (Re) and the minimal vaccination targets required to stop an outbreak. insufficient vaccination coverage would be expected to result in more circulating infection, which would still likely result in exposure to natural infection. a case-control trial conducted after the 1997 outbreak found that recent immigrants to So Paulo were a significant risk factor for measles infection. we make very simplistic assumptions about age-specific transmission. it is possible that higher contact rates among adults mean adult susceptibles disproportionately contributed to this outbreak. we conclude that there is no support for a structured generational matrix. assessing the overall age distribution of cases may tend to underestimate the role of adults if based on clinical confirmation alone. clinical cases may reflect time-varying confirmation and bias estimates of transmission rates. if true, by correcting for age-specific confirmation bias, we necessarily correct for temporal variation in false positives. the full model is comprised of component sub-models, which are linked explicitly via conditional probability statements. this results in parameter estimates and evaluation of candidate vaccination targets that fully incorporate the uncertainty in dependent variables. the model predicted that only campaigns targeting adults, as well as children, were likely to be effective in stopping the outbreak.
