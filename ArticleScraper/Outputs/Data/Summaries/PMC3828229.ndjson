{"summary": "the first case of a novel coronavirus was identified in a patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure in jeddah, kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in June 2012. a subsequent case from Qatar who was being treated in the UK was identified 2 and a hospital cluster of pneumonia among health care workers in Zarqa, Jordan in march/April of 2012 was retrospectively determined to have been caused by the same virus. 144 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases have been identified in nine countries. all cases have had a direct or indirect link with the Middle East. the number of cases reported rose markedly starting in April 2013 compared with the previous six months since virus discovery. 21 laboratory-confirmed cases reported to have symptom onset in April, 22 in May, 22 cases in June, 14 cases in July, 20 cases in August, 28 cases in September, and 4 cases in October 2013. 58 cases were not reported with date for symptom onset. the majority (63.4%) of patients experienced severe respiratory disease. 29.8% were reported to have non-severe disease, including 18 cases reported as asymptomatic. 86.8% of patients are reported to have at least one underlying medical condition. ty-five cases were classified as secondary cases with epidemiological links to other confirmed MERS-CoV cases. 73 per cent of index/sporadic cases were male, compared with 60.0% of secondary cases, though this difference was not significant. index/sporadic cases were older and more likely to experience severe disease requiring hospitalization or advanced care. only 49 cases have information on exposure to animals, including owning or visiting a farm with camels, goats, sheep, chickens, ducks or other animals. at least two cases had a consumptive coagulopathy during the course of their illness. the clinical course is more severe in patients with immunocompromising conditions. lower lobes tend to be affected more than upper lobes early in the course of illness; radiographic appearance progresses rapidly. a few cases found viral RNA in blood 11, urine 13 and stool 13 but at much lower viral loads than in the respiratory tract. the viral load in upper respiratory tract specimens is general lower than in the lower respiratory specimens. patients with severe disease have been treated with systemic high-dose corticosteroids. none of the antimicrobial agents used so far, including the antivirals, appear to be successful in improving severe progressive disease. a number of the cases in France, Italy, Jordan, KSA, Tunisia, UAE, UK and Qatar have been reported in clusters 1, 4, providing evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred in HCS, households, and the workplace. the incubation period for primary cases who acquired infection from environmental or animal sources is unknown. transmission to close contacts has been limited 6, 11, 12, 20, 23, and secondary attack rates among family members of patients in other clusters appear to be low3, 5, 6, 10, 12, 24, 25. in HCWs infected by exposure to patients, fewer underlying conditions and milder presentations have been described; however, 37.5% experienced severe disease and at least three died. none of the HCW secondary cases had reported underlying immunosuppression; however, two had hypertension and one had an unspecified underlying comorbid the authors suggest that, based on their analyses using PCR-confirmed cases, MERS-CoV does not yet have pandemic potential. they used publically available epidemiological data on 111 confirmed and probable MERS-CoV patients. 190-nucleotide fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene was recovered from a faecal sample. fragment had 100% nucleotide identity with a MERS-CoV recovered from the human case that occurred in that area. Neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV or a similar virus have been described in camels from the Spanish Canary Islands, Oman35 and from Egypt36. the upE and the ORF 1a targets are considered equally sensitive. the upE assay has been recommended for screening specimens with the ORF 1a assay or other specific gene targets being used for confirmation39. phylogenetic trees have been published by several groups10, 13, 22, 29. all suggest the emergence of MERS-CoV in mid-2011. one study of 10 full genome sequences, including one from a french patient22, suggests the emergence in June 2011 with a narrower timeframe, from Sept 2010\u2013Nov 2011. MERS-CoV infects non-ciliated bronchial epithelium, bronchiolar epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and lung ex vivo organ cultures. cellular tropism may influence severity of highly pathogenic coronaviruses compared with HCoV-229E infection. sensitivity to pegylated interferon treatment has been hypothesized to be due to lack of a SARS-CoV ORF6 homologue in MERS-CoV. this has been shown to inhibit the nuclear translocation of p-STAT1 and activation of downstream antiviral genes28, 51. this involves the greater suppression of the antigen presentation pathway in MERS-CoV compared with SARS-CoV. all known cases have a direct or indirect link to the Middle East. the most likely explanations are a restriction in the range of the putative host species or exposures related to human behaviours. the primary question to be answered is the route of transmission from animal to human. evidence from SARS suggests milder cases did not transmit infection55. it is now clear that milder and even asymptomatic presentations do occur and that the case-fatality rate is lower than observed. acute renal failure has been associated with hemodynamic compromise. high-dose corticosteroids are not effective in the management of ARDS. there is substantial evidence of harm, and no evidence of benefit, from high-dose corticosteroids when used for SARS and influenza A(H1N1)pdm094, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60. the answer to this and other remaining questions requires formal, structured, multinational collaborative research studies. the answer to this and other remaining questions requires formal, structured, multinational collaborative research studies, including the development and implementation of effective surveillance strategies.
