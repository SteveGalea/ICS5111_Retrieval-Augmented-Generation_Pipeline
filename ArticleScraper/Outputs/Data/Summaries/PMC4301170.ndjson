{"summary": "equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) are spherical to pleomorphic. in Asian macaques, SHFV causes a viral hemorrhagic fever that is nearly 100% lethal (6, 7) these subgenomic mRNAs encode at least eight structural proteins that are essential for virion infectivity. they appear to have functional analogs in particles of other arteriviruses (E, GP2 to -5, GP5a, M, and N) the molecular aspects of the SHFV life cycle have been understudied. two cell surface factors have been implicated as receptors for PRRSV. PRRSV GP2 and GP4 interact with CD163 (25) clathrin-mediated endocytosis seems to be the predominant route of cell entry. confluent MA-104 cells were exposed to p2 viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 and observed until the virus-induced cytopathic effect affected 70 to 80% of the culture. the cells were lysed by two cycles of freeze-thawing, and the medium was clarified of debris by centrifugation. MERS-CoV propagated on vero E6 cells at an MOI of 0.01, as previously described. the cell media were removed, and the cells were washed once with EMEM without FBS. the cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h and stained with 5% neutral red. cells were infected with VACV-eGFP at an MOI of 1. cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 6 h postinoculation, cells were detached using trypsin. confluent MA-104 cells were exposed to SHFV particles at an MOI of 50 for 1 h at 4\u00b0C to permit virion adsorption to cell surfaces. the cells were scraped off 10 min later with a cell scraper, collected into 15-ml tubes, and immediately centrifuged at 500 g for 20 min. the embedded blocks were sectioned using a Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), blebbistatin, chloroquine, CA-074, chlorpromazine, -chymotrypsin, concanamycin A, cytochalasin D, dynasore, E-64d, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA), filipin III, FYdmk. -cyclodextrin, phospholipase A2, phospholipase D, trypsin, proteinase K, papain, and -chymotrypsin were added to inhibitor-containing media. the cells were then exposed to SHFV for 1 h at an MOI of 5 for 1 h. MA-104 cells were transfected with plasmids using lipofectamine 3000. sorted cells using a BD FACS Aria II cell sorter. clathrin heavy chain knockout experiments were performed. gRNA-85, gRNA1 and gRNA2 were synthesized and incorporated into suitable vectors (pD1411-AD: CBh-Cas9N-2A-GFP, Cas9-ElecD) by DNA2.0. plasmids pgRNA-CLTC-84 and pgRNA-CLTC-85 and three pgRNA-CLTC-86 plasmids were dissociated with Accumax 48 signals were detected with a superSignal west Femto chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) the second set of sorted GFP-expressing cells were infected with SHFV at an MOI of 1. the cells were stained with 4% PFA and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) ants were harvested 24 h postinoculation, and titers were determined by plaque assay. ants were harvested 24 h postinoculation, and viral titers were determined by plaque assay. ants were harvested 24 h postinoculation, and ants were harvested. the p3 virus and MA-104 cells were pelleted by ultracentrifugation. the cells were then washed once with EMEM without FBS. the cells were then exposed to SHFV particles. confluent layers of MA-104 cells in 6-well plates were exposed 24 h after seeding to serial dilutions of SHFV and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h under gentle rocking every 15 min. the inocula were removed, and a 1% agarose overlay was added. the infected cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h. the infected cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 72 h. they were stained with 2% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) in 10% neutral buffered formalin. the cells were enumerated manually. the fixed cells were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Sciences), stained en bloc with 2% uranyl acetate, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series. embedded blocks were sectioned using a Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL), and contrasted with lead citrate. the media containing inhibitors were removed and the cells were washed twice with EMEM (10% FBS) the media containing inhibitors were removed, and the cells were then exposed to SHFV for 1 h at an MOI of 5. unbound virions were washed off, 50 l of EMEM was added, and plates were moved to 37\u00b0C. incubation at 37\u00b0C was continued until a total time span of 3 h was reached. cytotoxicity of inhibitors was assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8. the sorted cells were infected with SHFV at an MOI of 1. the cells were sorted using a BD FACS Aria II cell sorter. the cell culture supernatants were harvested 20 h postinoculation. protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit. lysates were resolved in 4% to 12% Bis-Tris gradient gels (Life Technologies) and then dry transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Life Technologies) after blocking in 5% nonfat milk powder in PBS with 0.1% Tween (Sigma-Aldrich), the membranes were incubated overnight. ton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) cells were stained with Alexa 594-phalloidin (Life Technologies) for 20 min at room temperature and again washed twice with PBS, mounted, and viewed. the cells were infected with SHFV or PRRSV at an MOI of 5 at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. cubated MA-104 cells with SHFV particles at an MOI of 0.1, 1 or 5 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C; removed the inocula; and incubated the cells for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, or 72 h in fresh medium. for all MOIs, viral titers increased more than 10- to 100-fold over baseline at 8 h, with viral production peaking at 48 to 60 h. concanamycin A, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type H+-ATPases, reduced SHFV particle production by roughly 5,000-fold at a concentration of only 20 nM. together, these observations indicate that SHFV uses a pH-dependent and, therefore, most likely an endosomal cell entry pathway. endocytic pathways are used by viruses, including dynamin-mediated (usually clathrin-mediated) endocytosis, clathrin-independent endocytosis, macropinocytosis, and caveola-mediated endocytosis (35). PRRSV and EAV both enter cells via CME, and our transmission electron microscopy data suggest that SHFV may utilize a similar mechanism. clathrin HC expression in MA-104 cells treated with clathrin HC-specific gRNAs or control gRNA by Western blotting. the error bars indicate the standard deviation of triplicate samples of one of two independent experiments. we transfected MA-104 cells with expression plasmids encoding wild-type dynamin-GFP (pEGFP-Dynamin1-WT) or the dominant-negative mutant dynamin-K44A-GFP (pEGFP-Dynamin1-WT) we sorted the cells 48 h later for GFP expression and quantified SHFV production in cell culture supernatants 20 h later by plaque assay. present in Fig. 3 suggest that SHFV enters target cells by dynamin-mediated endocytosis. we treated MA-104 cells with increasing concentrations of compounds known to inhibit this type of endocytosis. none of the compounds had an effect on the percentage of VACV-eGFP-infected cells. macropinocytosis does not play a major role in SHFV target cell entry. the error bars indicate the standard deviations of triplicate samples from one of two independent experiments. the error bars indicate the standard deviations of triplicate samples. the effect of the inhibitors on RVFV infection was too weak to be detected in plaque assays. effect of pretreatment of MA-104 cells with increasing concentrations of inhibitors of caveola-mediated endocytosis on SHFV particle yield was determined by plaque assay. some viruses require cathepsin L- and/or B-mediated cleavage of viral surface glycoproteins before, during, or after fusion of the endosome with lysosomes for infectivity. treatment of MA-104 cells with increasing concentrations of the irreversible cathepsin L and B inhibitor E-64d, the cathepsin L inhibitor FYdmk, or the cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074 did not play a role all four proteases reduced SHFV particle production between 50- and 100-fold. these treatments did not influence SHFV particle production. together, these results indicate that the SHFV receptor on MA-104 cells is a protein and that SHFV interaction with the receptor does not involve lipids. SHFV particle production decreased by roughly 100-fold in both tested cells. CD163 plays an important role in SHFV cell entry. the error bars indicate the standard deviation of triplicate samples. viral titers increased more than 10- to 100-fold over baseline at 8 h. viral production peaked at 48 to 60 h. cDNA clones of SHFV are yet to be established. concanamycin A, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type H+-ATPases, reduced SHFV particle production by roughly 5,000-fold at a concentration of only 20 nM. together, these observations indicate that SHFV uses a pH-dependent and, therefore, most likely an endosomal cell entry pathway. prior to SHFV infection, we treated MA-104 cells with increasing concentrations of chemicals known to inhibit CME. phenylarsine oxide inhibited CME at concentrations of 1 to 20 M by interfering with the production of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate needed for CME. the error bars indicate the standard deviations of triplicate samples. Dynamin acts as a mechanochemical enzyme driving membrane fission and as a regulatory GTPase in CME and in clathrin-independent dynamin-dependent endocytosis. namin1-WT or the dominant-negative mutant dynamin-K44A-GFP (pEGFP-Dynamin1-K44A) quantified SHFV production in cell culture supernatants 20 h later by plaque assay. clathrin heavy chain is a crucial component of the SHFV cell entry process. blebbistatin lowers the affinity of myosin II for actin. wortmannin is a covalent inhibitor of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases. none of the three compounds had an effect on SHFV particle production. effects of pretreatment of MA-104 cells with increasing concentrations of inhibitors of macropinocytosis on the SHFV viral titer. the error bars indicate the standard deviations of triplicate samples from one of two independent experiments. the error bars indicate the standard deviations of triplicate samples from one of two independent experiments. effects of pretreatment of MA-104 cells with increasing concentrations of the same inhibitors on RVFV infection, as determined by plaque assay. methyl-cyclodextrin (MCD) reduced SHFV titers more than 10-fold. exogenous soluble cholesterol was added to reverse effect of MCD. plication is also dependent on cathepsins, we treated MA-104 cells with increasing concentrations of the irreversible cathepsin L and B inhibitor E-64d and FYdmk. no effect was observed on SHFV particle production with any of the three compounds. concentrations of phospholipase A2 or D to test the direct involvement of MA-104 plasma membrane lipids as SHFV receptors. these treatments did not influence SHFV particle production. together, these results indicate that the receptor on MA-104 cells is a protein. the error bars indicate the standard deviations of triplicate samples from one of two independent experiments. a low pH is required when virions usurp the cellular endocytosis pathway (52, 53) treatment with drugs that disrupt cellular pH inhibited SHFV particle entry in a dose-dependent manner. in-mediated endocytosis, caveola-mediated endocytosis, and ill-characterized pathways of clathrin-independent dynamin-mediated endocytosis. our experiments with the dynamin inhibitors dynasore and Dyngo-4a, as well as with a dominant-negative dynamin mutant, suggest that SHFV utilizes a dynamin-mediated pathway. pretreated with bona fide CME inhibitors became resistant to SHFV particle entry. clathrin heavy chain knockout also inhibited virus infection. only one cell line, MA-104 (and its subclones) is known to be susceptible to SHFV. mannin affected VACV-eGFP infection, as described previously (69), in an optical readout assay (Fig. 4), no effect was measurable in plaque assays. this discrepancy raises the possibility that the three inhibitors may have some effect on SHFV infection. however, the macropinocytotic pathway is highly unlikely to be a major gateway for SHFV into MA-104 cells. tilin, and ARF6 pathways were not examined in this study. however, filipin III completely inhibited EAV at a concentration of 10 M (27), we did not see any effect of the compound on SHFV particle production. the distribution of arterivirus host cell receptors could explain the predilection of arteriviruses for particular cells. recombinant reporter viruses and a panel of antibodies to perform high-content immunofluorescence assays."}
