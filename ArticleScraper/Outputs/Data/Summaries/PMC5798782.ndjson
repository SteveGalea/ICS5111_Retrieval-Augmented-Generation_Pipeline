{"summary": "multiple outbreaks of infectious diseases, including yellow fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola, dengue, chikungunya, are occurring with increasing frequency. at least three major factors have influenced the increasing incidence of infectious disease epidemics. the most recent is Zika virus (ZIKV), an emerging arbovirus in the genus Flavivirus and family of Flaviviridae. RT-LAMP was first reported by Notomi et al. 2000 [17] (Eiken Chemical Co.) and has rapidly gained popularity for POC testing [18, 19]. RNA can also be targeted with the addition of reverse transcriptase. a fully integrated RT-LAMP assay coupled to reverse dot-blot technique can detect ZIKV RNA spiked in saliva samples. WMSS samples were selected for use in this study because it is less viscous than other oral fluids. atant was centrifuged at 2000 x g for 5 min to remove cell debris. cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde, washed, stained with 0.025% crystal violet in 2% (vol/vol) ethanol. RNA copy number was serially diluted ten-fold. PLCal_ZV, Thailand strain, NR-50242 (5.1 x 107 RNA copies/ml); FLR, Florida strain, NR-5024 (4.4 x 107 RNA copies/ml) and R103451, Honduras strain, NR-50358 (5.4 x 107 RNA copies/ml). purified genomic RNA from dengue Virus (DENGV) serotype 1 (Hawaii, NR-4287) and serotype RT-LAMP reaction was carried out in a final volume of 25 l including the OptiGene Master mix ISO-004. 3 pairs of primers targeted a unique conserved sequence in the ZIKV capsid. the temperature and primer concentrations were optimized in the lab. the microfluidic Rheonix CARD\u00ae cartridge is an integrated cassette that can provide both an immunological and nucleic acid (RT-LAMP) result from a single sample. it incorporates all the pumps, valves, micro channels, reactions, and reagent reservoirs on a disposable cartridge described in Chen et al. 2016 [16] four DNA oligo probes were designed to target the ZIKV amplicon from the RT-LAMP reaction. the microarray key is provided as supporting information. pre-heated lysed ZIKV diluted in 1XPBS was used as a template for RDB assay optimization on the Rheonix CARD\u00ae cartridge. devices used for RT-LAMP assays Depending on the device used for the RT-LAMP assay, different detection techniques were applied. WMSS samples were collected as previously described by Chen et al. 2016 [16] under the protocol (H10-01894) approved by the Institutional Review Broad of the New York University Langone School of Medicine. zika viral production and titration ZIKV strain PRVABC59, NR-50240 was obtained through Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository. CO2 cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde, washed, stained with 0.025% crystal violet in 2% (vol/vol) ethanol. RNA copy number was serially diluted ten-fold and used as a standard concentration curve graphing the RNA concentration (RNA copies/ml) vs amplification time. purified genomic RNA from dengue Virus (DENGV) serotype 1 (Hawaii, NR-4287) and serotype 2 (New Guinea C, NR-4288) were also obtained through BEI Resources (Manassas, VA) the primers were designed using the Primer Explorer V4 software. RT-LAMP reaction was carried out in a final volume of 25 l including the OptiGene Master mix ISO-004 with 7.5 units of WarmStart reverse transcriptase. 3 pairs of primers targeting a unique conserved sequence in the ZIKV capsid were added as a template. the RT-LAMP reaction mix was dispensed automatically into the master mix reservoir onto the Rheonix CARD\u00ae cartridge [16] and pumped with 7 l of the spiked sample to the amplification tube where the RT-LAMP reaction was carried out at 65\u00b0C for 30 min. the RT-LAMP reaction was carried out at 65\u00b0C for 30 min. the microarray key is provided as supporting information. pre-heated lysed ZIKV diluted in 1XPBS was used as a template for RDB assay optimization on the Rheonix CARD\u00ae cartridge. the microfluidic Rheonix CARD\u00ae cartridge is an integrated cassette that can provide both an immunological and nucleic acid result from a single sample. it incorporates all the pumps, valves, micro channels, reactions, and reagent reservoirs on a disposable cartridge described in Chen et al. 2016 [16] four DNA oligo probes were designed to target the ZIKV amplicon from the RT-LAMP reaction. pre-heated lysed ZIKV diluted in 1XPBS was used as a template for RDB assay optimization on the Rheonix CARD\u00ae cartridge. devices used for RT-LAMP assays Depending on the device used for the RT-LAMP assay, different detection techniques were applied. RT-LAMP detection technique Samples analyzed Experiment Genie III. on the Genie III device we first demonstrated that a RT-LAMP assay could be used for the detection of ZIKV RNA by testing serial dilutions in 1XPBS of purified genomic RNA. results showed that the amplification time values, also known as Tp (time to positivity), of the RT-LAMP for ten-fold serial dilutions of ZIKV RNA detection were between 3 and 10 min. the results indicate that the RT-LAMP assay using primers that target the capsid consistently detected down to 2 x 103 (6 RNA copies/reaction) the RT-LAMP assay was performed on the Genie III device. Tp (min) Mean (95%CI) Positive samples in 10 replicates 2.2 x 105 660.00 8.36 (7.5, 9.15) 10/10 2.2 x 104 66.00 9.43 (8.56, 10.29) 10/10 2.2 x 103 6.60 11.45 (8.44, 14.46) 10/10 2.2 x 102 0.66 19.95 (2.14, 37.76) 7/10 2.2 x 101 0.06 ND ND Tp: time to positivity; four probes at three different concentrations were designed to react with either the primer sets (Probes 1 or 2) or the RT-LAMP amplicons (Probes 3 or 4) the \u201cSpotting Controls\u201d should be positive in all reactions and allow the system\u2019s software to confirm that the DNA arrays are properly orientated. pre-heated lysed ZIKV diluted in 1XPBS was used as template. to further demonstrate the ability to obtain a semi-quantitative estimation of the viral load, we evaluated the relative signal intensity of a range of ZIKV RT-LAMP amplicons (199 ng to 3200 ng) RT-LAMP reaction followed by RDB processing for visualization of reaction product amplicons. results indicate detection in saliva samples down to 6 ZIKV RNA copies. each spot on the array represents duplicate immobilized Probe 4. the RT-LAMP assay using primers targeting the ZIKV capsid gene consistently detected down to 2 x 103 (6 RNA copies/reaction) the results indicate that the RT-LAMP assay using primers that target the capsid consistently detected down to 2 x 103. RT-LAMP assay detected 2.2 x 103 RNA copies/ml (6.6 RNA copies/reaction) in 100% of the samples and in 75% of the samples 2.2 x 102 RNA copies/ml (0.66 RNA copies//reaction) ten replicates per dilution were tested. s (1.32 x 108 and 2.52 x 108 RNA copies/ml) was used to optimize experiments on the Rheonix CARD\u00ae cartridge. representative results show that the RT-LAMP amplicons can be detected using the RDB technique in the Rheonix CARD\u00ae cartridge. RT-LAMP assay performed on the Rheonix CARD\u00ae cartridge. pre-heated lysed ZIKV diluted in 1XPBS was used as template. pre-heated lysed ZIKV spiked in saliva samples as a template. results indicate detection in saliva samples down to 6 ZIKV RNA copies. each spot represents duplicate immobilized Probe 4 ranging from a concentration of 20 M to 0.039 M by two-fold dilutions. the world health organization (WHO) declared ZIKV and its link to birth defects a public health emergency of international concern. on 1 February 2016, the world health organization (WHO) declared ZIKV and its link to birth defects a public health emergency of international concern. this recent outbreak confirm that we need an effective surveillance and diagnostic program to reduce the impact of future emerging infectious diseases. viral RNA in the HIV diagnostic dual assay was adapted to detect DNA from P. falciparum and P. vivax by simply changing the primers and optimizing the LAMP assay. RT-LAMP RNA levels of 2 x 103 RNA copies/ml were consistently detected in the four strains of the Asian-lineage. saliva samples were diluted 1:5 before isothermal amplification. heat-lyse treatment protocol is easier, faster and requires less sample volume for the RT-LAMP assay. RT-LAMP assay on the Genie III can detect purified genomic RNA. the entire assay will be validated using well-characterized ZIKV human specimens and samples from people infected with other flaviviruses. the limit of detection of our RT-LAMP assay on the Genie III and Rheonix CARD\u00ae cartridges is similar to other results reported using RT-LAMP and other isothermal assays. we are working on the identification of ZIKV specific antigens using a high-density peptide microarray (PEPperCHIP Platform Technology, Heidelberg, Germany), whereby 15-mer amino acids, overlapping by 14 amino acids are probed with antibodies of interest in order to identify immunogenic epitopes. once validated the identified diagnostic peptides will be adapted to a serological assay incorporated on the Rheonix CARD\u00ae cartridges. there is currently no combined antibody/nucleic acid test available commercially for ZIKV detection [61, 62]. Adaption of this protocol for the next emerging infection requires two steps: (1) identification of the nucleic acid sequence of the infectious agent. further experiments with clinical samples and diagnostic peptides will validate the assay. no heat inactivated ZIKV (no treatment) was used as a control for infected Vero cells. 2 replicates were used for high and low MOIs with heat inactivated ZIKV."}
