{"summary": "pulmonary embolism includes pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) PE has a high morbidity, mortality and misdiagnosis rate. some risk factors are also proposed in the guideline. immunohistochemistry and observation under a light microscope After preparation of thrombus samples, HE staining, immunohistochemistry and Masson staining were performed. following reagents were used in this study: integrin. integrin 1 was expressed on the lymphocytes, but no expression of Laminin, Fibronectin, Collagen. venous thrombus was red thrombus in which cord-like structures aggregated. Arrow: dark-brown integrin 1 was expressed on the lymphocytes (A, 1000) expression of integrin 1 ligands (Laminin, B, 400; Fibronectin, C, 400; Collagen-II, E, 400) was not observed on the lymphocytes. fibrinogen to construct mesh-like structure (C, 400) no expression of Fibronectin (D, 400), Vitronectin (E, 400), vWF (F, 400) was observed on these cells. in colon cancer tissues, there widely presented with dark-brown mesh-like structure in venules. integrin is a transmembrane heterodimer composed by and subunits at a ratio of 1: 1 via the non-covalent bond. a total of 8 subunits (1: 8) have been identified in human. the binding of Integrin 2 and ligands is involved in immune cell adherence. light microscopy showed the thrombi in acute pulmonary thromboembolism were red thrombi. the binding of activated integrin 2 with fibrinogen is involved in the thrombosis. acute venous thrombosis is a main activation process of circulated neutrophils and platelets. activated factor X converted to Xa and distributed on the fibrinogen. acute venous thrombosis is a main activation process of circulated neutrophils and platelets. the increased CD4 level in patients with symptomatic VTE was consistent with findings in genomics [17]. the increased level of integrin subunit 1 indicates the activation of lymphocytes, suggesting the regulatory function of lymphocytes enhanced."}
