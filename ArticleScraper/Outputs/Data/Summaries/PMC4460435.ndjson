{"summary": "MERS is associated with mild encephalopathy, an infectious agent, and a distinct reversible lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum. our case highlights the key clinical and radiological features of MERS in an adult patient with influenza A infection. MRI brain showed a diffusion restricted, non-contrast enhancing lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum. a nasopharyngeal viral swab was positive for influenza A. new tab Axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image (FLAIR) showing hyperintense lesion (green arrow) in splenium of corpus callosum (A) platelet count nadir was at 39109/L (lower limit of normal 150109/L), but trended upwards to 48109/L by the day of discharge. a thorough review of his medications could not explain his continued encephalopathy. the patient denied any illicit drug use. heparin was discontinued and the timing of his thrombocytopenia was not consistent with HIT type II. there are no available clinical efficacy data regarding oseltamivir and influenza-associated central nervous system lesions. oseltamivir was not initiated as treatment is recommended to reduce severity and duration of influenza symptoms in healthy adults. the clinical presentation of MERS includes symptoms of acute mild encephalopathy such as confusion, slurred speech, lethargy, drowsiness and hallucinations. MRI brain allows identification of diffusion restricted, non-contrast enhancing lesions located in the splenium of the corpus callosum. mild encephalopathy with reversible splenial lesion of the corpus callosum manifests as mild encephalopathy. radiographic findings of lesions in the splenium of the corpus callosum should prompt investigation of one of the known aetiologies of MERS."}
