{"summary": "methylation of deoxycytidines (dC) in DNA plays a major role in cell processes regulation, especially in modulation of gene expression. methylation of promoters induces gene silencing while hypomethylation is associated with gene expression. DNMTs add a methyl group on the carbon-5 position of the deoxycytidine at the CpG site in the DNA. histone methyltransferases catalyse the transfer of one, two or three methyl groups to lysine and arginine residues of histone proteins. in eukaryotic cells, histone methylation at certain sites is implicated in the condensation and decondensation of chromatin. arginine methylation of histones increases the complexity of the histone code by modulating the interaction of nuclear factors with other nearby histone marks. a convergent synthetic pathway to synthesize transition state analogues of the DNMT methylation reaction based on the coupling of cytosine analogues to adenosine. the compounds unexpectedly failed to inhibit DNMTs and RNA MTases but rather inhibited PRMTs. methoxymethyl chloride (2.87 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred for 18 h at RT. the solvent was removed and the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography. 2\u2032,3\u2032-O-Isopropylidene-5\u2032-deoxy-5\u2032-(2-nitrobenzenesulfonamido)adenosine (13) was removed by vacuum and the residue was co-evaporated with DCM twice. the crude product was used immediately without further purification. d6) 8.64 (brs, 1H), 8.29 (s, 1H), 7.92 (dd, J = 1.2, 8.0 Hz, 1H), 7.84 (dd, J = 1.2, 6.4, 7.8 Hz, 1H), 7.71 (ddd, J = 1.2, 6.4, 7.7 Hz, 1H), 7.41 (brs, 2H), 6.10 (d, J = 2.9 Hz, 1H), 5.36 ( tert-butyl 2-(Boc-amino)-4-((2\u2032,3\u2032-O-isopropylidene-5\u2032-deoxyadenosin-5\u2032-yl)amino)butanoate (15) and tert-butyl 2-(Boc-amino)-4-((2\u2032,3\u2032-O-isopropylidene-5\u2032-deoxyadenosin-5\u2032-y Thiophenol (50 l; 500 mol) was added and the mixture was stirred at RT overnight. tert-butyl 2-(Boc-amino)-4-((2\u2032,3\u2032-O-isopropylidene-5\u2032-deoxyadenosin-5\u2032-yl)amino)butanoate was filtered, the solvent removed by vacuum and the residue purified by silica gel flash chromatography.

Desired compound 7 was obtained under acidic conditions from 28 obtained after deprotection of 27 by thiophenol.

Arg169 is also conserved in all type-I PRMTs as it interacts with the carboxylate atoms of the SAM/SAH. arg169 is also conserved in all type-I PRMTs as it interacts with the carboxylate atoms of the S weakest inhibitor compound 3 induces conformation changes of three residues, his415, Arg169 and Arg169 side chains, involved in the interaction with the cytosine moiety. the weakest inhibitor compound 3 induces conformation changes of three residues, involved in the interaction with the cytosine moiety. compounds 2 and 4 in prostate DU145, colon HCT116 and breast MCF7 cancer cell lines were treated at 1 and 10 M and analysed after 3, 7 or 11 days of treatment. compound 4 showed good solubility and was tested at 10 M with a final DMSO concentration of 1%. the lack of antiproliferative activity of compound 4 is most likely due to poor target engagement due to low concentration levels of the chemical entity in the intracellular medium. the transition state of DNMT1 has been characterized by means of experimental kinetic isotopic effects showing that the transfer of the methyl group is the rate-limiting step [37]. the key step was the development of a convergent synthetic pathway starting from the protected bromomethylcytosine derivative 10. position N1 of the cytosine derivative 8 was substituted by a methoxymethyl group (MOM) in order to avoid polymerization. this MOM group was chosen because it mimics a fragment of the sugar moiety. ourylated derivatives 13 and 14 were alkylated by (S)-2-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-4-bromobutyric acid tert-butylester. the secondary amines 15 and 16 were alkylated by the protected bromomethylcytosine 10 in the presence of K2CO3, followed by treatment with ammonia in methanol to remove the benzoyl group of the cytosine moiety. n-alkylation of the nosylated derivatives 13 and 14 with the protected bromomethylcytosine 10 in the presence of K2CO3, followed by ammonia treatment in methanol to remove the benzoyl group of the cytosine moiety. the presence of an NH group on the C5 methyl group of the cytosine moiety made it difficult to remove. uracil derivative 22 was prepared from amines 11 and 12 using the same conditions as for 9 (scheme 3). amine derivatives 11 and 12 were activated with 1,2,4-triazole and POCl3 in the presence of TEA. amine derivatives 11 and 12 were reacted with amine derivatives 5 and 6. Desired compound 7 was obtained under acidic conditions from 28 obtained after deprotection of 27 by thiophenol. none of the compounds, even compounds 1 and 2, were found to be effective in inhibiting hDNMT3Acat and hDNMT1. compound 1, the transition state amino analogue bearing the amino acid group, showed some inhibition at a high concentration of 1 mM (table 2) with an inhibition activity of 20% at 100 M. this incited us to screen the compounds against several viral and human RNA MTases involved in methylation of the RNA cap structure. compound 2 and its analogue 4 showed an activity against PRMT4. IC50 values against PRMT4 of 1.9 and 14 M were measured for 4 and 2 respectively. the structures were solved and refined in two closely related space groups. the orthorhombic space group contains one copy of the PRMT4 tetramer in the asymmetric unit. the monoclinic space group has two PRMT4 tetramers in the asymmetric unit. the colour code for PRMT4 is the one defined in electronic supplementary material, figure S1. Residues from the SAH structure (PDB: 5TBJ) are drawn as stick models and labelled (PDB: 5TBJ). hydrogen bonds are drawn as grey dashed lines. compounds 1, 3 and 7 are weak inhibitors of PRMT4 (table 3) and displaced only 50% of the naturally bound SAH molecules on PRMT4. the co-crystal structures show that binding of each compound produces no conformation changes except a small reorientation of Gln159. the colour code for PRMT4 is the one defined in figure 2. Hydrogen bonds are drawn as grey dashed lines. Residues from the SAH structure are coloured in yellow and slightly transparent. strong inhibition of PRMT4 by analogue 4 Compound 4 shows strongest potency against PRMT4 in the inhibition assays. it lacks the amino acid moiety and it is distant from the 5\u2032 position of the adenosine by an additional carbon. all PRMTs share a common active site architecture defined by specific amino acids. no co-crystal structure could be obtained with PRMT4. displaced only 50% of the naturally bound SAH molecules on PRMT4. cytosine moiety goes less deep into arginine substrate binding site. Residues are drawn as stick models and labelled (PDB: 5TBH) conformation of the inhibitor 7 in the catalytic site as compared with SAH (c) and concerted side chain movement upon 7 binding as compared with SAH (d). colon HCT116 and breast MCF7 cancer cell lines were treated with 2 and 4 at 1 and 10 M and analysed after 3, 7 or 11 days of treatment. compound 4 had no effect on the methylation of H3R17, a substrate of PRMT4. the compounds were tested against several RNA MTases and viral RNA MTases. the compounds were also tested against several RNA MTases. structural switches are involved in the strongest in vitro inhibition. these conformation changes involve residues strongly conserved in type-I PRMTs and amino acids specific to PRMT4. pyrazole and benzimidazole derivatives are potent PRMT4 inhibitors. data accessibility All structures and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. authors' contributions L.H. participated in the design of the compounds, carried out the chemical laboratory work, participated in data analysis and helped draft the manuscript. grants from CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg, INSERM, Instruct. grant ANR-10-LABX-0030-INRT, a French State fund managed by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche."}
