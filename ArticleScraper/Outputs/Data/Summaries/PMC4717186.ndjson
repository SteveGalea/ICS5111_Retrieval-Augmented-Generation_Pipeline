{"summary": "cell-cell fusion occurs in various physiological and pathological conditions. syncytiotrophoblasts are formed by endogenous retroviral envelope (Env) proteins called syncytins. pathology of many placental abnormalities including eclampsia remains to be elucidated. the R peptide-containing Env protein does not induce fusion-from-within. but the R peptide-truncated Env (R-Env) does, showing that the cleavage after virion release activates the fusogenicity required for the viral entry. in HIV-1, the precursor Gag protein inhibits the Env-induced cell fusion. ocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) regulates HIV-1 mediated-cell fusion but not viral transmission. it has been reported that cellular transformation by the H-Ras oncogene activates the E-MLV virion-induced fusion-from-without but not infection in NP2-derived cells. the endocytosis inhibitor attenuated the fusion-from-without. we proposed a cascade of the viral Env-induced fusion-from-within. the cDNA clone was molecularly cloned from HeLa cells. an expression plasmid encoding the dominant negative mutant of dynamin inhibits endocytosis was obtained from Dr. U. Hazan (Dumonceaux et al., 1998) and Dr. L. Chang (Chang et al., 1999), respectively. HEK293T cells seeded in 3-cm plates were transfected with nls-LacZ (0.5 g) and Env expression plasmids (0.5 g) together with the dynamin mutant expression or pcDNA3.1 plasmid (0.5 g) these cells were washed by PBS, co-cultured with TE671mCAT1 or NP2/CD4/X4 cells 24 h after the transfection. cells were stained with the cell tracker orange (TaKaRa) for 1 h. time lapse imaging was performed on the live cells. cells were co-cultured, fixed, and observed under a microscope. cDNA was molecularly cloned from HeLa cells by RT-PCR with the LA Taq (TaKaRa) and KOD-Plus (Toyobo) DNA polymerases. an expression plasmid encoding the dominant negative mutant of dynamin inhibits endocytosis. transfected and treated cells were co-cultured for 24 h and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoly-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) the fusion index was calculated as follows: number of blue nuclei in syncytia/total number of blue nuclei 100. cells were treated with trypan blue for 6 h. ratios of unstained and stained cells were counted using a counting chamber. hek293T cells were cultured in glass slides or glass bottom dishes. the E-MLV R-Env or HIV-1 Env expression plasmid was transfected to HEK293T cells together with a GFP expression plasmid. TE671 cells expressing the E-MLV receptor (TE671mCAT1) were stained with the cell tracker orange, and co-cultured with the transfected cells. orange dots were not detected in green fused syncytia. target cells are internalized into E-MLV R-Env-expressing cells. expression plasmids of the E-MLV R-Env (upper panel) or HIV-1 Env (lower panel) were transfected to HEK293T cells together with the GFP expression plasmid. TE671mCAT1 or NP2/CD4/X4 cells were stained with cell tracker orange. expression plasmids encoding the R-Env and CD63-GFP were transfected to HEK293T cells. mCAT1-expressing TE671 cells were stained with the cell tracker orange. time-lapse analysis of cell fusion dynamics was performed. syncytium formation requires endocytosis, cathepsin B, and endosome acidification. env-expressing cells were treated with an inhibitor of endocytosis (dynasore), endosomal cathepsin B (CA074Me), or concanamycin A. syncytium formation requires endocytosis, cathepsin B, and endosome acidification. the suppression of cell fusion by the inhibitors should not result from unexpected effects of the inhibitors. however, when the E-MLV R-Env or HIV-1 Env expression plasmid was transfected to HEK293T cells together with a dominant negative mutant of dynamin, cell-cell fusion was inhibited. the impact of dynamin mutant expressed in target cells on the cell-cell fusion could not be analyzed. 671mCAT1, SC-1, and HeLamCAT1 cells were treated with indicated inhibitor. this experiment was repeated three times. fusion indexes in the control cells were always set to 1. membrane fusion occurs at membrane dents. HIV-1 Env-transfected and NP2/CD4/X4 cells were co-cultured. cells were fixed 30 min after the co-culture. fusion-from-without requires endocytosis. mouse SC-1 cells were pretreated with dynasore, CA074Me, or concanamycin A. this result showed that endocytosis, cathepsin B, and endosome acidification are required for the fusion-from-without. small orange dots were observed in fused cells induced by the E-MLV R-Env (Figure 1A upper panel) and the HIV-1 Env (Figure 1A lower panel) orange signals represent unfused cells on syncytia. when unsusceptible orange cells were located near fused cells, the syncytia were not enlarged. HEK293T cells were transfected with the R+Env and GFP expression plasmids. TE671mCAT1 or NP2/CD4/X4 cells were co-cultured with the transfected cells. these cells were observed under a fluorescent microscopy. almost all orange dots in fused cells were co-located with CD63-GFP signals. this result indicated that parts of the target cells were encapsulated into late endosomes/lysosomes of the Env-expressing cells during the cell fusion. mCAT1-expressing TE671 cells were stained with the cell tracker orange. ruffling structures of cell membranes bound each other, and cell-fusion occurred. the time-lapse imaging showed fused cells can fuse with fused cells. phagocytosis in env-expressing cells is more important for cell fusion than in target cells. endocytosis in the Env-expressing cells is required for the cell-cell fusion. syncytium formation was not affected due to the mutant expression in only several % of transfected cells. the cells were simultaneously transfected with the dynamin dominant negative mutant expression plasmid or pcDNA3.1. fusion indexes in the control cells were always set to 1 and relative fusion indexes SD are shown. electron microscopic observation at the cell-cell contact area was performed. long and narrow compartments were observed in syncytia. red arrows indicate gaps between long and narrow compartments. membrane fusion occurs at membrane dents. endocytosis, cathepsin B, and endosome acidification are required for the fusion-from-without. mouse SC-1 cells were pretreated with dynasore, CA074Me, or concanamycin A. icles containing the target cell cytoplasm remain in the fused cell. a little proportion of invaginating endosomes participates for cell-cell fusion. orange and green cells indicate target and Env-expressing cells. a fused cell fuses with a fused cell. it is thought that the infection receptor proteins in the fused cells are occupied by the Env proteins. the fusion-from-without also requires endocytosis in the cells. o analyzed the data.
