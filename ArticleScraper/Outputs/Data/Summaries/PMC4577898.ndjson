{"summary": "the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective barrier critical for central nervous system homeostasis. it relies on specific features of the brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) lining the brain capillaries. the BBB is known to provide significant protection against hematogenously spread viruses. OC43 and 229E were found in the brains of SARS patients and multiple sclerosis patients. but the mechanism of neuroinvasion by hematogenously spread CoVs is elusive. the highly hepatotropic mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3) is known as the most virulent MHV strain, causing fulminant hepatitis. BMECs have already been reported as potential cell targets for MHVs. primary mouse BMECs were shown to support MHV3 replication in vitro. conflicting results regarding viral replication of MHV-A59 in BMECs have been reported. highly pathogenic MHV3 is a cloned substrain isolated from the liver of an infected mouse. the lower-virulence 51.6-MHV3 is an escape mutant, selected from the pathogenic MHV3 virus in the presence of S protein-specific A51 and A37 monoclonal antibodies. all viruses were produced in L2 cells. cell culture supernatant was collected for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and virus titration. total RNA was extracted for quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses. gene expression was normalized to expression of the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene as an endogenous control. the specificity of the PCR products was confirmed by melting curve analyses. all qPCR analyses of samples from in vitro and in vivo experiments were run in duplicate. bEnd.3 cell culture supernatants were infected for 72 h p.i. and i.p. injected with 100 l of 10% NaF in PBS 1 h prior to euthanasia. titers were determined according to the manufacturer's instructions. bEnd.3 cells were seeded in collagen-treated 24-well plates at 60,000 cells/ml and transfected with 25 nM small interfering RNA (siRNA) bEnd.3 cells were seeded in collagen-treated 24-well plates at 60,000 cells/ml and transfected with 25 nM small interfering RNA (siRNA) cells/cm2) (0.4-m pore size; Costar, Corning, Tewksbury, MA) assembled into 24-well plates and infected for 24 to 72 h. transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) (ohms per square centimeter) was recorded using an EVOM volt ohmmeter. the cells were incubated with primary antibodies (ZO-1, occludin, and VE-cadherin antibodies diluted 1:100; all antibodies from LSBio, Seattle, WA) overnight at 4\u00b0C, then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500) (1 h at room temperature), and mounted in antifade medium containing 4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino infected mice were compared to mock-infected mice or MHV-A59- and 51.6-MHV3-infected mice according to experiments. mice were housed in a HEPA-filtered air environment. all experiments were conducted with mice between 8 to 10 weeks of age. cells were seeded in collagen-treated 24-well plates at 6 104 cells/cm2 or collagen-treated 6.5-mm-diameter transwell polycarbonate membrane inserts. the cells were then infected with MHV3, MHV-A59, or 51.6-MHV3 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 for 24 to 72 h or up to 8 days according to the particular experiment. RNA from bEnd.3 cells was extracted using a NucleoSpin RNA II kit. one microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit. real-time PCR amplification was carried out on 25 ng cDNA using the hotStart-IT SYBR green qPCR master mix. titration was performed on brain lysates from infected mice and infected bEnd.3 cell culture supernatants. bEnd.3 cell culture supernatants were cultured in 96-cell monolayers. mice were infected for 72 h and i.p. injected with 100 l of 10% NaF in PBS 1 h prior to euthanasia. blood was collected, transcardial perfusion with 15 ml PBS was performed. bEnd3 cell monolayers were grown on collagen-treated 6.5-mm-diameter transwell polycarbonate membrane inserts. transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), reflecting barrier integrity, was recorded using an EVOM volt ohmmeter. bEnd.3 cells were seeded in two-well labtek chamber slides and infected for 48 h. the cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100, and blocked with 3% BSA. MHV-infected mice were compared to mock-infected mice or MHV3-infected mice were compared to MHV-A59- and 51.6-MHV3-infected mice according to experiments. RESULTS Brain invasion by hematogenously spread MHVs correlate with strain virulence and tropism for liver. examination of hematoxylin-eosin-stained brain sections revealed low-level presence of inflammatory cells in the meninges, microvasculature, and ependymal tissue lining the ventricles in the brains of MHV3-infected mice. no inflammatory cells or abnormalities in the neural tissue and choroid plexus were detected in the brains of all infected mice. viral detection of MHV3, MHV-A59, and 51.6-MHV3 at 72 h p.i. in brain samples of infected mice determined by qRT-PCR analysis of the viral nucleoprotein (N) expression and viral titration. no evidence of replication of MHV-A59 and 51.6-MHV3 was noted. mRNA expression of occludin (B), ZO-1 (C), VE-cadherin (D) and claudin-5 (E) was evaluated in brain samples by qRT-PCR. no significant difference in NaF uptake was observed in mice infected with MHV-A59 and 51.6-MHV3. mRNA expression of tight-junction proteins was significantly reduced by about 50% in the brains of MHV3-infected mice. levels of expression of claudin-5 and VE-cadherin mRNA were also impaired in the brains of MHV-infected mice. BMECs (bEnd.3 cell line) are more permissive to MHV3 replication than to 51.6-MHV3 and MHV-A59 replication. no change in tight-junction protein expression was induced by 51.6-MHV3 infection. production of infectious MHV3 increased from day 2 to day 3 p.i. and then stabilized up to day 8 p.i. mouse bEnd.3 immortalized brain microvascular endothelial cells were infected with MHV3, MHV-A59, or 51.6-MHV3 at an MOI of 0.1. bEnd.3 cells were treated with specific siRNA to each molecule prior to infection for 24 h, and MHV nucleoprotein (N) mRNA expression was determined by qRT-PCR. changes in cellular metabolism in the first 72 h of infection in MHV3-, MHV-A59-, or 51.6-MHV3-infected BMECs. the percentage of optical density (OD) slowly decreased (about 15%) in the first 72 h p.i. only in MHV-infected bEnd.3 cells. MHV3 exhibits differential viral fixation and/or entry into BMECs. levels of MHV nucleoprotein (N) RNA were evaluated in bEnd.3 cells. abrogation of the CEACAM1a expression resulted in a substantial decrease of MHV N RNA expression in BMECs infected with all viruses. clathrin or caveolin-1 expression was abrogated (P 0.05 to 0.01), while MHV N RNA levels of MHV-A59 were altered only in clathrin-deficient, infected cells. MHV3, but not MHV-A59 and 51.6-MHV3, enhances in vitro permeability of BMECs, leading to viral transendothelial migration. transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), reflecting barrier integrity, was monitored from 24 to 72 h. titers were recorded in the basolateral chamber from 24 to 72 h p.i. Viral detection threshold is 1.6 TCID50. a higher uptake of EVB was found in MHV3-infected bEnd.3 monolayers (P 0.01) than in MHV-A59-infected bEnd.3 monolayers (P 0.05) no effect on the permeability to either dye was noted in 51.6-MHV3-infected cells. we postulated that MHV3-induced enhancement of permeability would allow the virus to transmigrate across the b bEnd.3 cells were infected for 48 h with MHV3, MHV-A59, and 51.6-MHV3. levels of expression of occludin (A), VE-cadherin (B), ZO-1 (C) and claudin-5 (D) mRNA were evaluated by qRT-PCR. MHV3 infection, but not MHV-A59 and 51.6-MHV3 infections, may increase the production of autocrine inflammatory factors by BMECs. mRNA levels of TNF- did not increase in MHV3-infected cells, in contrast to 51.6-MHV3- and MHV-A59-infected cells (P 0.05 to 0.001) MHV3-induced breakdown of BMEC barrier does not depend on inflammatory factors. cells were infected with MHV3, MHV-A59, and 51.6-MHV3 at an MOI of 0.1. mRNA expression (A, C, E, and G) and protein levels (B, D, F, and H) of TNF-, IL-6, CCL2 and CXCL10 were evaluated. bEnd.3 cells were infected with MHV3, MHV-A59, and 51.6-MHV3 at an MOI of 0.1. mRNA expression (A) and protein expression (B) of IFN- was evaluated at 24 h p.i. TEER decreased only in MHV3-infected cells but was completely restored by IFN- treatment (P 0.01) addition of anti-IFN- antibodies did not decrease TEER in spite of a nonsignificant decrease in 51.6-MHV3-infected cells. previously observed enhancement of paracellular permeability to NaF and EVB in MHV-A59-infected cells and to a lesser extent in MHV-A59-infected cells was abolishe VE-cadherin genes (P 0.05 to 0.01) blocked MHV3 trafficking across the bEnd.3 monolayer. neutralization of IFN- potentially produced in MHV-A59- and 51.6-MHV3-infected cultures did not worsen virus-induced barrier permeability or reduction of tight junctions. however, neutralization of IFN- increased barrier permeability to NaF and EVB (P 0.05 to 0.01) in MHV-A59- and 51.6-MHV3-infected cells. neutralization of IFN- allowed transit of MHV-A59, but not 51.6-MHV3. findings suggest amount of IFN- produced by BMECs upon infection with MHV-A59 and 51.6-MHV3 but not MHV3 may control viral replication in these cells. choroid plexus were detected in the brains of 51.6-MHV3- or MHV-A59-infected mice. no multinucleate or rounding cells usually observed in the livers of all infected mice were noted in the brains of all infected mice. histopathological analysis of the liver was also done from 24 to 72 h p.i. to confirm that viral infection first occurred in the liver following i.p. inoculation in trafficking of virus to the brain was assessed by detection of MHV nucleoprotein (N) RNAs and titration of infectious particles. virus replication level in the brain after 72 h p.i. was too low to permit significant immunolabeling of virally infected cells. no significant difference in NaF uptake was observed in mice infected with MHV-A59 and 51.6-MHV3. mRNA expression of occludin (B), ZO-1 (C), VE-cadherin (D) and claudin-5 (E) was evaluated in brain samples by qRT-PCR. claudin-5, VE-cadherin, occludin, and ZO-1 staining intensities were lower in brain microvessels from MHV3-infected mice than in mock-infected mice. mRNA expression of tight-junction proteins was significantly reduced by about 50% in the brains of MHV-A59-infected mice. in vitro infections with MHV3, 51.6-MHV3 and MHV-A59 at an MOI of 0.1 were conducted on a BMEC cell line (bEnd.3 cells) the kinetics of viral replication showed that production of infectious MHV3 increased from day 2 to day 3 p.i. and then stabilized up to day 8 p.i. mouse bEnd.3 immortalized brain microvascular endothelial cells were infected with MHV3, MHV-A59, or 51.6-MHV3 at an MOI of 0.1. bEnd.3 cells were treated with specific siRNA to each molecule prior to infection for 24 h. the percentage of optical density (OD) slowly decreased (about 15%) in the first 72 h p.i. only in MHV3-infected bEnd.3 cells. the loss of cell activity did not increase when cells were infected with a higher MOI (MOIs of 1 and 5). abrogation of the CEACAM1a expression resulted in a substantial decrease of MHV N RNA expression in BMECs infected with all viruses (P 0.001). MHV-A59- and 51.6-MHV3-infected cells (P 0.01 and P 0.05 respectively), suggesting a more important role for TLR2 in the fixation or entry of MHV3 in BMECs. MHV3, but not MHV-A59 and 51.6-MHV3, enhances in vitro permeability of BMECs, leading to viral transendothelial migration. in vitro model of BBB was constructed using bEnd.3 cell monolayers grown on Transwell inserts. cells were infected with MHV strains for 24 to 72 h, and transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) reflecting BBB integrity was monitored. Viral titers were recorded in the basolateral chamber from 24 to 72 h p.i. the Viral detection threshold is 1.6 TCID50. results are representative of two independent experiments. MHV3-induced enhancement of permeability would allow the virus to transmigrate across the bEnd.3 monolayer. but not MHV-A59 or 51.6-MHV3 viral titers, were detected at 48 and 72 h p.i. in the basolateral chamber. bEnd.3 cells were infected for 48 h p.i. with MHV3, MHV-A59, and 51.6-MHV3 at an MOI of 0.1, the levels of expression of occludin (A), VE-cadherin (B), ZO-1 (C) and claudin-5 (D) mRNA were evaluated by qRT-PCR. results are representative of two independent experiments. hypothesized that MHV3 infection, but not MHV-A59 and 51.6-MHV3 infections, may increase the production of autocrine inflammatory factors by BMECs. mRNA levels of TNF- did not increase in MHV3-infected cells, in contrast to 51.6-MHV3- and MHV-A59-infected cells (P 0.05 to 0.001) the production of IL-6 increased only in 51.6-MHV3- protein levels (B, D, F, and H) of TNF-, IL-6, CCL2 and CXCL10 were evaluated at 24 h p.i. all experiments were conducted in triplicate. bEnd.3 monolayers infected for 48 h with MHV3, MHV-A59, and 51.6-MHV3 at an MOI of 0.1 in the presence of recombinant IFN- (100 pg/ml) or anti-IFN- monoclonal antibodies (1 g/ml) mRNA expression levels of occludin (F), ZO-1 (G) and VE-cadherin (H) in addition of anti-IFN- antibodies did not decrease TEER in spite of a nonsignificant decrease in 51.6-MHV3-infected cells. previously observed enhancement of paracellular permeability to NaF and EVB in MHV-A59-infected cells at 72 h p.i. was abolished following the addition of IFN- (P 0.01 and P 0.05, respectively) neutralization of IFN- increased barrier permeability to NaF and EVB. decreased expression of occludin and VE-cadherin in 51.6-MHV3-infected cells. but not in MHV-A59-infected cells (P 0.05 to 0.01) the amount of IFN- produced by BMECs upon infection with MHV-A59 and 51.6-MHV3, but not MHV3, may both control viral replication in these cells. we demonstrated that MHV-specific ability to cross the BBB during acute liver infection correlated with enhanced BBB permeability as evidenced in vivo and in vitro. the highly hepatotropic MHV3 (16, 22), we presumed a strain-specific restriction of CNS invasion at the BBB level according to virulence. this strain-specific ability of MHV3 to cross the BBB in vivo has been confirmed in vitro on a modeled BBB of a bEnd.3 cell monolayer grown on a Transwell system. a coronavirus, MHV3, can increase BBB permeability in impairing tight-junction ZO-1, VE-cadherin, and occludin expression in BMECs and the brain. the MHV-A59 or 51.6-MHV3 strain, however, induced no or a slight reduction of claudin-5 expression. MHV-A59 entry via clathrin-dependent endocytosis, but not caveolin-dependent endocytosis, has also been previously reported in other cell types. MHV-A59 entry via clathrin-dependent endocytosis, but not caveolin-dependent endocytosis, has also been previously reported in other cell types (40, 41) we cannot rule out the possibility that cytokines and chemokines may be produced in vivo by recruited inflammatory cells in the CNS during MHV3 infection. however, only a few inflammatory cells have been evidenced by hematoxylin-eosin-safranin staining at 72 h p.i. in the brains of MHV3-infected mice, and the levels of IL-6, TNF-, CCL2 and expression of MMP1a and MMP3 by BMECs was not affected by in vitro infection with MHV3, 51.6-MHV3 or MHV-A59 strain. the differential IFN- production by BMECs upon infection by MHVs may possibly represent one key factor in MHV strain specificity to induce BBB breakdown. the importance of IFN- downregulation in MHV3-induced BBB breakdown is supported by our results showing that the addition of IFN- antagonized MHV3-mediated permeability and disruption of tight junctions in BMECs independently of its antiviral properties. on the other hand, barrier integrity in MHV-A59- and 51.6-MHV3-infected BMEC monolayers was lost when IFN- was neutralized. sulfate detergent into the mice is presumed to alter BBB integrity (22) in human infections. the mechanism involved in CNS invasion by coVs following primary infection in the upper respiratory tract is unclear. MHV3 may specifically evade detection by TLRs or helicases."}
