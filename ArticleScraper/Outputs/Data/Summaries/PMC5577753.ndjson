Summary of amino acid variations of PEDV strain 85-7 during serial passages in cell culture. vero cells were pretreated with CsA, V-ZAD-FMK or DMSO for 1 h. they were then infected with PEDV with the presence of CsA, V-ZAD-FMK or DMSO. titers were determined as Log pfu/mL. the Y977H was the only site that differed the trypsin-independent strains (ca-DR13 and 85-7 strain) from the trypsin-dependent strains (DR13 and CV777)."}
