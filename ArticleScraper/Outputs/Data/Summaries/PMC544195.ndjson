{"summary": "a deadly communicable disease outbreak, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, amplifies the difficulties of hospital priority setting. the aim of this study is to describe and evaluate priority setting in a hospital in response to SARS using the ethical framework 'accountability for reasonableness' 'accountability for reasonableness' is an explicit ethical framework for legitimate and fair priority setting in health care. priority setting may be considered fair if four conditions are met: relevance, publicity, appeals, and enforcement. 'fair-minded' people seek to cooperate according to terms they can justify to each other. to our knowledge there have been no studies of hospital priority setting during an emergency response to a communicable disease outbreak. the purpose of this study was to describe priority setting in a hospital in response to a communicable disease outbreak. descriptive data were compared with conditions of 'accountability for reasonableness'. instances where conditions are not met were considered 'opportunities for improvement' the validity of the interpretations was enhanced in four ways [14] interviews were audiotaped and transcribed. participants were asked to describe priority setting decisions in relation to SARS. interview guide was modified during the study to explore emerging themes. priority setting decisions can be organized according to four specific types. decisions relating to staff and patients, beds/rooms, clinical activity, and visitors. 'ramp up' phase during which the hospital gradually increased its level of activity. surgical and ambulatory care were cancelled during the initial 7\u201310 days of SARS. 'no visitor' policy was enforced during the initial stages of SARS except for compassionate grounds as determined by the nurse manager or nurse in charge of the particular unit. decision making process Priority setting decisions were made across all levels of the institution. Table 2 describes decisions made, the reasons used, and the level at which they were made. the hospital as whole determined few hospital workers unessential Operational need; Screening capability; Infection control Hospital Command Redeploy staff from screening back to clinical areas Medical need; Duty to care; Operational need Hospital Command Hire screeners Medical need; Operational need; Infection control Hospital Command Remove pregnant staff from the clinical environment. Medical need Corporate Command Allocate OR time by division Medical need. Duty to care Corporate Command Treat some 'elective cases' in the OR as being urgent Medical need. Individual Clinicians Family Medicine did not go out into the community to provide care in initial stages of SARS. many participants found it difficult to evaluate the relevance of the reasons underlying many of the MOHLTC directives. many felt that communication beyond the core group of decision makers was incomplete. some stakeholders participated unfairly by using a'squeaky wheel' approach. priority setting decisions were made during the initial days of the outbreak. the first phase was a 'ramp up' phase during which the hospital gradually increased its level of activity. the first phase of the outbreak was a 'ramp up' phase. a 'no visitor' policy was enforced during the initial stages of SARS except for compassionate grounds as determined by the nurse manager or nurse in charge of the particular unit. staff deemed non-essential were sent home with pay; students were sent home and educational rounds were cancelled. the corporate command implemented the recommendations from the corporate command in accordance with patient population requirements and physical logistics. department managers and clinical staff also participated in allocating human resources and determining patient care priorities. During the early stages of SARS, decisions were made for infection control focused on protecting staff. patients (25) from 8th floor general medicine to make room for SARS unit and potential SARS patients Operational need; Medical need Hospital Command; Department Managers/Chiefs Separate staff entrance from visitor and patient entrance Operational need; Hospital Command Send staff home Infection control MOHLTC Hospitals greater than 500 beds will be expected to provide a 30 bed unit each. screening capability Hospital Command Lift visiting restrictions on case-by-case basis Compassion; Squeaky wheel; Medical need Department Managers/Chiefs Hospitals must restrict access to each hospital site. priority setting decisions can be organized according to four specific types: decisions relating to staff and patients, beds/rooms, clinical activity, and visitors. clinical activity All non-emergency surgery and ambulatory care were cancelled during the initial 7\u201310 days of SARS. operation room time was allotted by division \u2013 each individual surgeon reported to their division head the cases they considered urgent. 'no visitor' policy was enforced during initial stages of SARS except for compassionate grounds as determined by the nurse manager or nurse in charge of the particular unit. ambulatory care were cancelled during the initial 7\u201310 days of SARS. clinical activity volumes increased in percentages allowing for urgent cases to be seen as determined by physicians. a 'no visitor' policy was enforced during the initial stages of SARS except for compassionate grounds. Table 2 describes decisions made, the reasons used, and the level at which they were made. the hospital as whole determined few hospital workers unessential Operational need; Screening capability; Infection control Hospital Command Redeploy staff from screening back to clinical areas Medical need; Duty to care; Operational need; Infection control Hospital Command Hire screeners Medical need; Operational need; Infection control Hospital Command Remove pregnant staff from the clinical environment.

'Accountability for reasonableness' is a framework that can guide legitimate and fair priority setting in health care organizations, such as hospitals. it assumes that the time and effort required for meeting the conditions of fairness is justified for two reasons: first, it is important to act ethically and be perceived to be acting ethically \u2013 in this case, fairly. acting ethically can help an organization achieve 'goodwill' benefits including, but not limited to, increased trust and satisfaction and decreased complaints. the best assurance of fair priority setting in a crisis is fair priority setting everyday. the best assurance of fair priority setting in a crisis is fair priority setting everyday. the best assurance of fair priority setting in a crisis is fair priority setting everyday."}
