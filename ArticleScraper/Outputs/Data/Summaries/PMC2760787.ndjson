{"summary": "different nucleic-acid-based detection techniques have been developed in order to employ identification based on single-nucleotide variations. these techniques allowed distinguishing alleles and correctly assessing the genotype at the single-base level. 16S rRNA gene sequences have been used to resolve bacterial phylogeny and taxonomy issues in different contexts. mutations are identified on the basis of the higher thermal stability of the perfectly-matched probes as compared to mismatched probes. hybridization is generally combined with some other selection or enrichment procedures. oligonucleotide probe pairs and a thermostable DNA ligase are blended to form a mixture. the two probes hybridize consecutively along the template and the DNA ligase joins their ends only in the case of a perfect match. this reaction is cycled to increase product yield. RB (21) and PRIMROSE (22) are very diffused, both being tools implemented specifically on 16S rRNA. some commercial software, like Oligo 7 (Molecular Biology Insights, Cascade, CO, USA) or AlleleID (Premier Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA, USA) have been applied for probe design in a pathogen characterization experiment. the software comprises a series of scripts for retrieving oligonucleotide sequences, quality-check them and design probes for different applications, such as Ligase Detection Reaction (LDR) or Minisequencing/Primer Extension probes. a careful check of multiple alignment scores should be made, in order to avoid designs. the scripts also include a procedure for consensus determination from a set of user-defined sequences. 'N's are the most frequently present in aligned sequences and no degenerated bases are used in the consensus. two oligonucleotide probes are designed, one upstream (Discriminating Probe, DS, comprising the discriminating position) and one downstream (Common Probe, CP) of each position. the software keeps track of all the designed candidates, assigning a quality score. ORMA calculates some specific statistics for the qualitative evaluation of the candidates designed on consensus sequences. the intra-group score, as the number of initial sequences having the same discriminating base as the consensus, and the inter-group score, as the number of sequences other than those used for that consensus having the same discriminating base as the candidate one. this latter score is calculated only when the consensus were created inside ORMA, starting from a single-global alignment. cyanobacteria 16S rRNA data set comprised a total of 352 sequences. the sequences were organized by phylogenetical similarity and grouped in a total of 18 clusters, as described in (8). resulting file was imported into ORMA, where 18 consensus sequences were determined. a total of 14 DNA samples, corresponding to 13 cyanobacteria species, were tested in duplicate, independent, LDR experiments with both ORMA and Castiglioni et al. probe pairs. a total of 14 samples, corresponding to 13 cyanobacteria species, were tested in duplicate, independent, LDR experiments. aClonal DNA from environmental sample indicates that only the probe corresponding to the species was present; non-specific means that no probe was present. the number of replicates is reported within brackets. a total of 738 sequences were retrieved from RDP-Ribosomal Database Project II (27) for a total of 738 sequences. only sequences of length >1200 bp and flagged as of \u2018good\u2019 quality were retrieved. each subgroup was aligned independently in ClustalW. one probe pair per species was designed, except for Campylobacter spp. for which two probe pairs were evaluated in terms of reproducibility and specificity. the inter-group score of the candidates was required to be above a threshold of 80%, as in the cyanobacteria dataset. the null distribution was set as the population of 'Blank' spots. two times the standard deviation of pixel intensities of the same spots was added to obtain a conservative estimate. oligonucleotide sequences are retrievable, quality-checked and design probes for different applications, such as Ligase Detection Reaction (LDR) or Minisequencing/Primer Extension probes. a careful check of multiple alignment scores should be made to avoid designs on sequence datasets of distantly related species. the scripts also include a procedure for consensus determination from a set of user-defined sequences. the majority rule is in which the consensus base is the most frequently present in the aligned sequences and no degenerated bases are used. two oligonucleotide probes are designed, one upstream (Discriminating Probe, DS, comprising the discriminating position) and one downstream (Common Probe, CP) of each position. the software keeps track of all the designed candidates, assigning a quality score, depending on how many filters they pass. ORMA calculates some specific statistics for the qualitative evaluation of the candidates designed on consensus sequences. the intra-group score, as the number of initial sequences having the same discriminating base as the consensus, is calculated only when the consensus were created inside ORMA, starting from a single-global alignment. the software output can be exported as a comma-separated spreadsheet reporting: (a) the list of all the discriminating bases, grouped per species, with absolute (referring to the global alignment main function recalls all the side scripts needed to perform each requested operation. the software also comprises a series of scripts for retrieving oligonucleotide sequences, quality-check them and design probes for different applications. the overall procedure is accomplished in four main steps. a careful check of multiple alignment scores should be made. the scripts also include a procedure for consensus determination from a set of user-defined sequences. in case of equal occurrences, \u2018N's are used in the consensus. oligonucleotide probes are designed, one upstream (Discriminating Probe, DS, comprising the discriminating position) and one downstream (Common Probe, CP) of each position. the software keeps track of all the designed candidates, assigning a quality score, depending on how many filters they pass. oligonucleotide design is dependent on the molecular application chosen. candidate probes can be filtered and ranked according to their thermodynamic properties. candidate probes can also be filtered and ranked according to their thermodynamic properties. candidate probes can also be filtered and ranked according to their thermodynamic properties. oligonucleotide specificity can be real issue for oligonucleotide specificity. the search for discriminating positions on 16S rRNA starts from the import of a set of already-aligned sequences. standard multiple-alignment formats (Clustal-like, Multi Sequence Files, or aligned FASTA format) can be used. a careful check of multiple alignment scores should be made. the discriminating position finding procedure can be summarized as follows in four basic steps: (a) choice of a user-defined subset of sequences of the dataset (indicated as the \u2018positive set\u2019) the remaining sequences are used as a group of the discriminating positions must be different from; these are addressed, in the present article, as the 'negative set' the software keeps track of all the designed candidates, assigning a quality score, depending on how many filters they pass. the current options of the script on the discriminant base are: (a) limiting the range of positions, in order to exclude candidates insisting on positions too close to the 5\u2032- or 3\u2032-end of the sequences. the candidate probes can also be filtered and ranked according to their thermodynamic properties. cyanobacteria 16S rRNA data set comprised a total of 352 sequences, which were organized by phylogenetical similarity. 80% of the sequences constituting each of the 18 clusters carried the same base as the consensus in the candidate discriminating base. the inter-group score was set to be below a 2% threshold, with the same exceptions as above. the \u2018Unicyano\u2019 probe was the one proposed by Castiglioni et al.. lerans 4 Cyanothece sp.strain PCC 7418 Solar Lake, Israel Aspecific (1/2), Specific (1/2) Specific (2/2) Leptolyngbya 5 Leptolyngbya sp.strain 0BB 30S02 Bubano Basin, Imola, Italy Specific (2/2) Specific (2/2) Microcystis 6 Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 9354 Little Rideau Lake, Ontario, Canada aClonal DNA from environmental sample indicates that only the probe corresponding to the species was present. non-specific means that no probe was present, but also other probes showed an IF significantly above background signal. the number of replicates is reported within brackets. one probe pair per species was designed, except for Campylobacter spp. for which two probe pairs were evaluated in terms of reproducibility and specificity. the inter-group score of the candidates was required to be above a threshold of 80%, as in the cyanobacteria dataset. complete experimental procedures concerning the amplification of 16S rRNA sequences are reported in Supplementary Data. the complete cyanobacteria 16S dataset experiment The complete cyanobacteria. rRNA data set comprised a total of 352 sequences, which were organized by phylogenetical similarity and grouped in a total of 18 clusters. rRNA data set comprised a total of 352 sequences, which were organized by phylogenetical similarity and grouped in a total of 18 clusters. a total of 14 DNA samples, corresponding to 13 cyanobacteria species, were tested in duplicate, independent, LDR experiments with both ORMA and Castiglioni et al. probe pairs. a total of 14 DNA samples, corresponding to 13 cyanobacteria species, were tested. 8 Nostoc sp.strain PCC 7107 Shallow pond, Point Reyes, CA, USA Nostoc (100%) Aspecific (2/2) Non-specific (0/2) 9 Nostoc sp.strain PCC 8114 Water bloom, Lake Hepet.on, Morris Co, NJ, USA Cylindrospermum (58%) Non-specific (0/2) Non-specific (0/2) Planktothrix 10 Planktothrix sp. experiment Milk pathogens-related 16S sequences were retrieved from RDP-Ribosomal Database Project II (27) for a total of 738 sequences. only sequences of length >1200 bp and flagged as of \u2018good\u2019 quality were retrieved. each subgroup was aligned independently in ClustalW. one probe pair per species was designed, except for Campylobacter spp. for which two probe pairs were evaluated in terms of reproducibility and specificity. the thermodynamic parameters were the same described for the cyanobacteria data set, except for the melting temperature, which was required to be in the range 67\u201369\u00b0C. the null distribution was set as the population of \u2018Blank\u2019 spots (e.g. with no oligonucleotide spotted, n = 6) IFs. two times the standard deviation of pixel intensities of the same spots was added. 16S presents highly polymorphic regions that can be used in clusterization, phylogenetic tree construction and molecular discrimination of microbiological families. ORMA can perform all these operations with user-specified parameters in an automated way. a new set of cyano-specific probe pairs was designed and compared to the original one (8), generated on the same database of sequences. ORMA identified 192 candidate probe pairs for the 18 species. a very low content of degenerated bases (average 2%, max = 6%) and a very low content of degenerated bases. 3 (3) 100% 0 (349) 0% 100 100 Cylindrospermopsis_z_28 Cylindrospermopsis 1560 543 28 CGTAAAGGGTCTGCAGGTGGA ACTGAAAGTCTGCTGTTTTAAAGTTTG 21 27 63.3 63.7 0 0 10 3 (3) 100% 3 (349) 1% 100 100 Cylindrospermum_z_29 Cylindrospermum 2133 1062 29 GTTTTTAGTTGCCAGCACTTC c 1886 825 32 GGGGAGTACGCGCAACG GTGAAACTCAAAGGAGGGG 19 24 66.0 63.5 0 0 10 5 (6) 83% 4 (346) 1% 97.37 100 Prochl+Synech _z_3B Prochlorococcus+ Synechococcus 1475 426 3B CTTGAGGAATAAGTAAT TCCGTGCCAGCGCG 24 18 63.5 65.2 0 0 TAACGCGTTAAGTC TCCCGCCTGGGGAGTACGC 22 19 64.0 66.0 0 0 10 3 (5) 60% 0 (347) 0% 97.27 100 Lyngbya _z_34 Lyngbya 1120 112 34 AGTAACGCGTGAGAATCTGCCTTA GGGTCGGGGACAACCACCG 24 19 63.5 66.0 0 0 10 3 (3) 100% 1 (349) 0% 100 100 Phormidium_z_ al to the number of quality checks each probe passed (10 means all, 8.3 is five out of six); \u2018Inter-group score \u2018and \u2018Intra-group score\u2019 evaluate the probe pair specificity (as reported in the text) the exact probes sequence from ORMA is reported. the first 11 specific +1 universal probes corresponded to probes which were actually tested on cyanobacteria samples. probe pair was designed with its DS insisting on a position which did not discriminate univocally the Anabaena + Aphanizomenon consensus from the consensuses of the other species. the mismatch gives instability to the 3\u2032-end of the DS when annealing on the 16S rRNA sequences of species other than those of Anabaena + Aphanizomenon cluster, impeding the ligase to join the adjacent end of the DS. the cyanobacteria universal probe pair was called as statistically over the background in all the experiments. performances of the LDR procedure were comparable to those obtained with the Castiglioni et al. probe set, having a SNRnp of 1.1 0.26 and a SNRp ranging from 7 to 387 (average 131) in this case, we had no signs of aspecificity in the experiments. a cyanobacterial DNA was correctly assessed by the universal probe pair. one of the products has been correctly classified by microbiological methods. the other DNA was very uncertain and classified as 'cylindrospermum' the discriminating base are marked by a black box. the discriminating position was found on some Leptolyngbya strains. the discriminating position is unique to all Cylindrospermum sequences. the final evaluation on the candidate probe pairs was made by RDP and BLAST checks. the probes were slightly longer than the ones on cyanobacteria dataset, with an average length of about 40 nt. the consensus scores for both the DS and CP confirmed the overall quality of the probes. 80% 88 99.50 S_agal_z_15 Strept. bovis 91 81 16 CGTGCCTAATACATGCAAGTAGTTTTGCGAACGGGT GAGTAACGC 43 36 67.4 67.9 0 0 10 17 (18) 94% 92.25 99.69 S_bovis_z_16 Strept. bovis 223 192 19 CGCATGACAATAGGGTACACATGTACCC TATTTAAAAGAG Staphylococcus (no aureus) 208 186 21 GAAACCGGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGA 233 192 9 CTCTATACTCCTGCTTAACACAAGTTTTTTTCGGTG 42 46 67.4 67.2 0 0 10 71 (78) 91% 90.60 90.75 Campylob_2_z_9 Campylobacter spp. the scale varies between non-significance (>0.05) to high-significance (0.005). the line \u2018Other\u2019 represents the mean of all the remaining Zip-codes in the universal arrays that were not associated to any actual probe. ORMA helped in developing a reliable PCR-LDR-UA assay. ORMA is a bioinformatic tool for the search and determination of single-discriminating positions within a set of highly homologous sequences. a careful grouping of the sequences in clusters is strongly suggested. a careful grouping of the sequences in clusters is strongly suggested. toFI-beta (15) implements a suffix-tree-based algorithm for isolating suitable candidate probes from a target genome. pathogenMIPer (16) is based on a different strategy (i.e. molecular inversion assays), which starts from the selection of unique sequences on a reduced dataset. PRIMROSE and ARB are tools widely used for the classification and the phylogenesis of bacterial species. they operate a probe design on the basis of the phylogenesis of the species under analysis. none of these two software, however, is built specifically for the determination of discriminating positions within a set of very similar sequences. ORMA can retrieve discriminating positions and design specific probes on every set of sequences. it is not based on an internal database of sequences and can be extended to any gene. the database should be critically built by only context-specific sequences. silico checks versus public databases are necessary only in case of lack of reference among the sequences imported in ORMA or when the species eventually present in the biological context under study are too many. a complete set of major thermodynamic parameters are reported in the output. the probe pair for anabaena + Aphanizomenon group was flagged as inadequate by ORMA, having six degenerated bases in the CP. the mix containing all probe pairs was tested on the corresponding synthetic templates. all except anabaena+Aphanizomenon gave positive results.

ORMA helped in developing a reliable PCR-LDR-UA assay. the molecular procedure allowed the discrimination between the most frequently isolated or emerging pathogens in mastitis. the molecular identification on the basis of the 16S rRNA gene required PCRs with species-specific primers. a careful grouping of the sequences in clusters is strongly suggested. a careful grouping of the sequences in clusters is strongly suggested. in this latter application three rounds of design were applied to compensate the non-perfect homogeneity of some species. pathogenMIPer (16) is based on a different strategy (i.e. molecular inversion assays), which starts from the selection of unique sequences on a reduced dataset. all these software perform smart designs where the probes have to be selected on the whole genomic DNA. in both the presented datasets, the molecular complexity of the genomic material has been reduced by PCR on the 16S rRNA. the software was applied on the design of probes for a specific technique (LDR) and on a specific target gene (16S rRNA), the software is not limited to this combination. the design of probes for minisequencing application would have implied the determination of one oligo with the single-base variation in the middle of the sequence. specific probes on every set of sequences should be critically built by only context-specific sequences. standard procedures, like PCR with specific primers, can help in isolating only the subsets of sequences which constitute the actual database from those completely unrelated to the biological context under investigation. cyanobacterias in particular, are constantly and frequently upgraded. a complete set of major thermodynamic parameters are reported in the output. our data assessed and demonstrated the performance of ORMA in designing probes for molecular applications on 16S rRNA gene and their feasibility for experimental use."}
