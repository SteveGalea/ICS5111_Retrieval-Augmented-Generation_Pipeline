{"summary": "influenza has been reported from Indian Hajj and Umrah returning pilgrims. but data on other respiratory pathogens are sparse in india. the study reinforces the need for better infection prevention and control measures such as vaccination, health education on cough etiquette and hand hygiene. participants included pilgrims returning from Saudi Arabia after having completed Hajj or Umrah from October 2014 to April 2015. from 100 l clinical specimen RNA was extracted using the MagMax automated RNA extractor as per the manufacturer details. real-time RT-PCR assays were carried out using the Invitrogen Superscript III one-step quantitative RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) ninety seven (32.3%) tested positive for any virus. influenza viruses [n=33, A (H3N2)=13], A [(H1N1pdm09)=9 and B (Yamagata)=11] were the most frequent. human coronaviruses (n=26, 8.7%) were the most common detected. co-infections were seen in two patients (aged 50 and 60 yr, both females) one each of enterovirus + adenovirus and adenovirus + PIV-1. all patients were given symptomatic treatment and advised about cough etiquette. corona- and rhinoviruses were the most commonly detected viruses in pilgrims returning from Hajj and Umrah in 2015. coronaviruses OC43 and 229E have been known to be associated with upper respiratory infection. crowded conditions during pilgrimage likely facilitate transmission of these viruses. ah are performed throughout the year with changing dates. the congregation of potentially infected individuals from all across the world makes the acquisition and transmission of the viruses possible. transmission of the virus has been reported in home countries after travelling to a MERS-CoV-affected country."}
