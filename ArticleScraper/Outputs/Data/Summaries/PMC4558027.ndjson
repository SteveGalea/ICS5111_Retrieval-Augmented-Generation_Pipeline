{"summary": "a nested polymerase chain reaction approach was used to detect influenza (A, B), metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza (1\u20134), rhinovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus and coronaviruses. in both cohorts, RSV was the most frequent pathogen (52.9% and 36.1% of the cohorts, respectively) tial virus (RSV), influenza virus (IV), human parainfluenza virus (hPIV), adenovirus (AdV) and rhinovirus (hRV) have been associated with LT-ARI. the frequency of LT-ARI cases varies with age, among other factors. a comparison cohort of 97 UK children admitted with LT-ARI, aged over 1 month, was recruited between 2009 and 2012. the cohorts allowed for comparison of North and South European data from two regions with different climate and healthcare systems. in both cohorts, recruited patients were admitted to PICU or ward. second round PCR was performed using 1 l amplicon from first round PCR as template material. Genotyping was performed by Sanger sequencing of second round PCR products when appropriate (AdV) study participants were previously healthy children under 14 years of age admitted to a participating hospital with an LT-ARI diagnosis. all types of LT-ARI were included, from bronchiolitis to pneumonia, with or without wheezing, fever, rhinorrhea or respiratory distress. multiplex nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in all samples independently of any diagnostic test carried out by the referring hospital. viral material was eluted into a volume of 200 l. the level of statistical significance was set to 0.05. Statistical tests and Figures were carried out using R software v. 3.0.2 (R Core Team (2013). R: A language and environment for statistical computing). in co-infected samples, the most frequent combination of pathogens was RSV + hRV (n = 108), followed by hBoV (n = 68), hBoV (n = 48), AdV (n = 39), HMPV (n = 27), IV (n = 12), hPIV and hCoV (both n = 7). the virus most frequently found in dual infection was RSV (n = 42), followed by hR 68 24 17 11 51 13 14.4 40.9 44 7 9 5 11 6 3 6 (33.3) (24.7) (17.9) (55.4) (42.4) (17.9) (36.0) (29.4) (42.3) (35.3) (18.8) (25.0) Bocavirus 48 19 6 3 42 16 22.5 31.9 21 4 10 8 13 4 4 3 (23.5) (19.6) (6.3) (45.7) (50.0) (27.4) (35.8) (15.4) (10.3) (40.0) (47.1) (5 _ 1 _ (2.5) (1.1) (4.3) (23.5) (1.5) (0.0) (3.8) (6.3) Co-infection 92 29 _ _ 15.1 25.6 53 8 16 10 18 6 4 4 4 (45.1) (29.9) (16.1) (25.1) (41.7) (23.5) (72.7) (66.7) (35.3) (30.8) (21.1) Total samples 204 97 95 56 92 29 16.7 36.6 136 39 25 17 26 17 16 24 (46.1 hBov/hCov 3/3/1 1.6/1.6/0.5 0/0/0 0.0/0.0/0.0 RSV+hBov+IV/AdV 2/4 0.5/1.1 0/1 0.0/1.2 hRV+hBov+AdV/IV 4/0 2.1/0.0 1/1 1.2/1.2 IV+hBov+AdV+AdV/HPIV 2/2 1.1/1.1 0/0 0.0 the viruses most frequently found in dual infections were RSV and hBoV (both n = 12), followed by hRV (n = 9) and IV (n = 8). hRV and IV were observed with similar frequencies in single infection and co-infection (hRV n = 11 vs 13; IV n = 13 vs 10), and RSV was more commonly present as a single infection. the differences were only observed in the UK cohort for hBoV (PICU: 16.3%\u2014non PICU: 22.2%) the differences were only observed in the UK cohort for hBoV (PICU: 16.3%\u2014non PICU: 22.2%) nasopharyngeal samples from 204 patients identified 23 (11.3%) nasopharyngeal swabs and 181 (88.7%) nasopharyngeal aspirates/wash. no differences in findings were observed in relation to the method used for sample collection. Molecular diagnostics identified at least one pathogen in 187 samples. hRV, IV, hBoV, AdV and hMPV were more frequently found in co-infections. data are presented as number of positive samples (percentage of evaluated samples) or the mean (standard deviation) age is expressed in months. metapneumovirus 27 4 9 2 18 2 16.8 48.5 18 1 3 1 5 1 1 1 (13.2) (4.1) (9.5) (3.2) (19.6) (6.3) (27.7) (57.2) (13.2) (2.6) (12.0) (5.9) (19.2) (5.9) (6.3) (4.2) Influenza virus 12 23 4 13 8 10 35.7 45.9 2 5 4 4 5 2 8 (5.9) (23.7) (4.2) (20.6) (8.7) (31.3) (4 GENDRES cohort UK cohort Pathogens detected Number % of positive cases Number % of positive cases Co-infection, two pathogens 65 34.2 24 28.2 RSV+hRV/hBov/AdV/MPV/IV 23/10/7/2/0 12.3/5.3/3.7/1.1/0.0 3/4/2/0/2 3.5/4.7/2.4/0.0/2.4 hRV+hBov/hCov/AdV/MPV/HPIV 2/2 the most commonly detected virus was RSV (n = 35), followed by hRV (n = 24), IV (n = 23), hBoV (n = 19), AdV (n = 9), HMPV (n = 4) and hPIV (n = 6) in the co-infected samples. in children aged 12\u201324 months there was also a significant association age and co-infection in patients aged 24\u201348 months. in the UK cohort, there was also a significant association age and co-infection in patients aged 12\u201324 months. in the UK cohort, RSV infection affected younger children more frequently (mean age: 8.1 months; SD: 14.9) and hPIV was principally found in older patients. 0.844 17 (39.5) 18 (33.3) 0.671 Rhinovirus 15 (39.5) 28 (30.1) 0.312 11 (25.6) 13 (24.1) 1.000 Bocavirus 6 (15.8) 21 (22.6) 0.479 7 (16.3) 12 (22.2) 0.451 Adenovirus 5 (13.2) 14 (15.1) 1.000 3 (7.0) 6 (11.1) 0.727 Parainfluenza 1 (2.6) 3 (3.2) 1.000 1 (2.3) 5 (9.3) at least one respiratory pathogen was detected in 91.7% of the enrolled patients in the spanish cohort and 87.2% in the UK cohort. this finding is in the upper end of the reported range in children. hRV was found in one third of samples and as single pathogen in approximately 10% of the cases. infection by both RSV and hRV was the most common viral co-infection detected. but in the UK cohort the most common viral co-infections were RSV + hBoV and IV + hBoV. hMPV is an important cause of bronchiolitis, accounting for 5\u201315% of all cases. 66.7% of hMPV were detected as a co-infection with another respiratory virus, and 33.3% were found as a mono-infection. in the UK four (4.1%) samples were hMPV-positive, including two with co-infection. more than one virus in children admitted to hospital with LT-AR ranged from one third to two thirds of these patients, depending on the age. the co-infection pattern most frequently found was the combination of RSV and hRV."}
