{"summary": "health care workers are at a high risk of exposure to infectious diseases. the use of personal protective equipment by health care workers is one of the most crucial measures to protect them against diseases. a lot of studies have been carried out to determine the limitations of the respirators with respect to human Factors (HF) and to resolve them. a study conducted by Grinshpun et al. found that seal between face and respirator is the most important part responsible for any leakage of contaminants (8). respirator masks may impose physiological stress on mask wearers. different aspects of comfort include the impact of respirators on humidity and heat inside the mask. other aspects of comfort include the impact of respirators on humidity and heat inside the mask. questionnaire was designed to evaluate and compare ergonomic aspects of the respirator masks used in the health care system. content validity, alpha coefficient and test-retest methods were used to evaluate the validity, internal consistency and reliability of the questionnaire. questionnaire consists of four major dimensions: respirator fit, comfort, their impact on the performance of individuals wearing them, and the mood of an individual while using the respirators. the panel members were selected from experts active in the questionnaire content domain. the minimum number of panel members is suggested to be four persons (14, 15) 290 questionnaires were completed by the Masih Daneshvari Hospital medical staff. the questionnaire internal consistency was determined using Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient. the questionnaire was resubmitted after two weeks to 45 individuals who had previously completed the questionnaires. the first draft of the questionnaire contained 50 five-point Likert scale questions. the panel members were selected from experts active in the questionnaire content domain. the minimum number of panel members is suggested to be four persons. 290 questionnaires were completed by the Masih Daneshvari Hospital medical staff. the questionnaire was resubmitted after two weeks to 45 individuals who had previously completed the questionnaires to examine the questionnaire reproducibility using test-retest method. 290 questionnaires were completed by the Masih Daneshvari Hospital medical staff. the questionnaire internal consistency was determined using Cronbach\u2019s alpha coefficient. the questionnaire was resubmitted after two weeks to 45 individuals. the bartlett and KMO Index were used to check the suitability of data for factor analysis. the primary model, the goodness of fit values was not at an acceptable level. d 31 Removed 10 0.387 0.068 0.001 32 0.706 0.062 0.001 11 Removed - - - 12 Removed - - - The effect of items on performance 33 Removed 38 0.790 0.082 0.001 34 0.774 0.071 0.001 39 0.870 0.059 0.001 35 0.866 0.062 0.001 40 0.804 0.068 0.001 36 0.592 0.065 0.001 41 the AVE values are greater than the MSV and ASV values for all components. divergent validity is also established for all components. a 45-item questionnaire containing five dimensions of awareness and training, comfort, human performance and mood dimensions was prepared. the questionnaire contained 42 items and it is beneficial to use it in the health care system to evaluate the ergonomic problems of the masks and to have optimal choice in this respect."}
