{"summary": "the health insurance review & assessment service has run a healthcare utilization monitoring system (HUMS) since 2008. the HUMS has kept records of health insurance claim data for 4 years. it has a 14-terabyte hardware capacity and employs several easy-to-use programs for maintenance of the system. the health insurance review & assessment service (HIRA) has a similar system with limited functionalities. there was a dramatic increase in surgical operations regarding urinary incontinence (UI) in 2007 in the ROK. the HUMS contains a database management system (DBMS), extract-transfer-load (ETL) and online analytical processing (OLAP) severs. the HUMS has servers for data mining to detect abnormal signs of healthcare utilization. the HUMS has 14 terabyte data storage space. it includes storage space for producing data after data mining. the storage size of the HUMS will increase to 30 terabyte data storage space. the HUMS uses a filtering process in order to produce two indices. items showing abnormal signs of health care utilization can be produced by the type of health care services such as the medical care, the dental care, the oriental medicine, and the pharmacies. the DBMS of the HUMS is operated on an HPUX operating system. the other servers use windows NT and windows 7. the HUMS has servers for data mining to detect abnormal signs of healthcare utilization. the HUMS monitors healthcare utilization and the volume of healthcare costs by diseases (ICD-10), types of services (e.g., diagnosis, lab test, long-term care, etc.) the system does not provide English version. the HUMS has an independently operated SAS server for data mining. raw data loading and data loading for data mining take two days and at least five days. the HUMS monitors healthcare utilization and the volume of healthcare costs by diseases (ICD-10), types of services (e.g., diagnosis, lab test, long-term care, etc.) the system uses a filtering process to produce two indices which are the percentage increase oscillator (PIO) and the relative strength index (RSI) values showing items that are out of specific data ranges. the screen is composed of four sections. the first section is the current status on health insurance claims shown as daily and monthly amount of healthcare costs. the second section shows information on the total amount of healthcare costs and the proportion of healthcare costs assumed by the insurer. the HUMS helps the HIRA to explain the cause of a healthcare cost increase or decrease. the HUMS is able to find those areas that lead to healthcare cost changes using six categories. the HUMS is not a real-time system, even though it appears to be real-time. the database of the HUMS is composed of many tables to enable fast data loading. if users want to see more detailed results, they have to run a separate analysis from the main DW system. the national health insurance, medical aids, veterans and healthcare services type (inpatient/outpatient) there are two indices. the first is the increase rate calculated from the previous month. the second is compared against the same month in the previous year. HUMS shows the results after processing the five data mining models. cases having the disease code (ICD-10) T80 showed sign of abnormal healthcare utilization when this study requested the cases by disease submitted in may. users of the HUMS can verify whether there has been any increase in healthcare costs per claim with this disease code in May. the system is well spread out over the past history of healthcare utilizations. the actualization of the data set was based on the past history of healthcare. there is a time lag of 2 to 3 months because hospitals and clinics tend to file health insurance claims a little late. the HUMS has a user-friendly interface to quickly analyze large-scale health utilization for monitoring and supporting decision-making processes. it could be impossible to deliver due to the manual process involving billions of claims containing various patients' information."}
