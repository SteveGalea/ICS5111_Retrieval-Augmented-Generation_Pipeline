{"summary": "respect for Persons Respect for autonomy is one of the fundamental principles of clinical ethics. the principle of beneficence can be considered to be the doctor's duty to put the patient's interest before his or her own interests. duty to do good and avoid Harm Inherent in most medical codes of ethics is duty to care for patients and to relieve patient suffering. nonmaleficence counterbalances the principle of beneficence. equal distribution of medical resources without prejudice or discrimination is principle of distributive justice. physicians who choose a specialty that inherently carries a higher risk of acquiring an infectious disease may have accepted this duty (and risk) through their choice of specialty. david frum: this duty depends on reciprocal obligations of governments and societies to physicians to reduce the risk of transmission to healthcare providers. he says there is uncertainty about how to use isolation and quarantine for asymptomatic healthcare providers such as those under surveillance for possible Ebola virus exposure. otracheal intubation and chest compressions are unlikely to result in a survival benefit and probably shouldn't be performed. the healthcare providers managing patients with EVD must weigh the benefits and risks associated with each intervention and should decide whether to use these treatments on a case-by-case basis. volunteerism is an appropriate means for healthcare providers to serve those infected with the Ebola virus. it is uncertain how care is to be provided to the sick if patient demand surpasses volunteer capacity, such as in a pandemic event. there is uncertainty about how to use isolation and quarantine for asymptomatic healthcare providers. use of unapproved or experimental therapies Several of the americans infected with the Ebola virus in west africa were airlifted to the united states and were treated with optimum medical care. a recent panel issued the opinion that offering unproven interventions with unknown efficacies is ethical under certain conditions. a final ethical consideration is why should some individuals get access to experimental therapies when others dying of EVD in West Africa do not."}
