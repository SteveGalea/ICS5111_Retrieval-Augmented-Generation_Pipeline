{"summary": "the susceptibility to infection in neonates can be attributed to limitations of both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms. neonatal monocytes have a reduced capacity to amplify signals and activate adaptive immune cells through upregulated cytokine production and expression. the antiviral activity of V9V2-T cells is determined by their activation and amplification. it is known that IPP-expanded V9V2-T cells have more antiviral activity against influenza virus than resting V9V2-T cells. blood was collected at the Division of Neonatology in the department of pediatrics, second hospital of Sichuan University, from January 2010 to March 2012. the research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University Hospital of Sichuan University. h culture, and the perforin, IFN- and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)--secreting cells were examined by intracellular cytokine staining. cells were stained with anti-human perforin-FITC, anti-human TNF- antigen-presenting cell and anti-human IFN--PE-Cy7 (BD Biosciences) the expression of perforin, TNF- and IFN- were further examined. paired t-tests were used to compare the fold change between groups. brefeldin A (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added at a final concentration of 10 g/ml. cells were then collected after 12, 24, 36 and 48 h culture. perforin, IFN- and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)--secreting cells were examined by intracellular cytokine staining. all samples were acquired with a minimum of 0.1 million events. forward scatter and side scatter were used to identify lymphocytes. expression of perforin, TNF- and IFN- were further examined. adults had a significantly higher percentage of V9V2-T cells in the blood than all groups of neonates. 4%\u201310%, 1%\u20133%, 1%\u20131.5% and less than 1% V9V2-CD3+ T cells in the blood of healthy adults, full-term and preterm. the percentage of resting T cells within CD3+ T-cell populations was determined by flow cytometry. the intracellular expression of perforin, IFN- and TNF- in V9V2 T cells of full-term (n=40), preterm (n=19) and SGA (n=23) neonates. perforin expression in V9V2-T cells reached peak level at 24 h post-stimulation. peak expression of perforin was at 36 h in neonates. magnitude of perforin expression was lower in neonates than in adults. the virus did not induce significant IFN- and TNF- expression in V9V2-T cells from preterm neonates. adult V9V2-T cells had the highest antiviral cytokine response to influenza virus. the fold increases of IFN- and TNF- expression were significantly higher than those in preterm or SGA neonates after 24 h stimulation. s from full-term (n=34), preterm (n=17) and SGA (n=19) neonates or from adult PBMCs (n=7) were incubated with influenza H1N1 PR/8 virus at an MOI of 2 for the indicated time. the fold increase of IFN- and TNF- expression was calculated. the perforin, IFN- and TNF- responses of V9V2-T cells were positively correlated with the birth weight of neonates. the correlation of their fold increase with gestational age or birth weight was determined. weaker IPP-induced expansion of V9V2-T cells in adults. the percentage of V9V2-T cells (a) and their fold change of expansion (b) were determined in adults (n=9), full-term (n=6), preterm (n=4) and SGA (n=4). 8.51.3 32.11.6a,b 39.41.2 Gender (M/F) 1310 911

the percentage of resting T cells within CD3+ T-cell populations was determined. 2-T cells from adults were significantly higher than that from full-term, preterm or SGA neonates after 24 h stimulation. the magnitude of perforin expression was lower in neonates than in adults. the virus significantly triggered IFN- and TNF- expression in V9V2-T cells. however, the virus did not induce significant IFN- and TNF- expression in V9V2-T cells from preterm neonates. individual CBMCs from full-term (n=34), preterm (n=17) and SGA (n=19) neonates or from adult PBMCs (n=7) were incubated with influenza H1N1 PR/8 virus at an MOI of 2 for 24 h. the percentage of V9V2-T cells expressing IFN- (a) and TNF- (b) within the CD3+ population was determined. the perforin, IFN- and TNF- responses of V9V2-T cells were also positively correlated with the birth weight of neonates. the correlation of their fold increase with gestational age or birth weight was determined. the percentage of V9V2-T cells (a) and their fold change of expansion (b) were determined in adults (n=9), full-term (n=6), preterm (n=4) and SGA (n=4). both of these groups are highly susceptible to life-threatening infections. innate immune system plays a more important role than adaptive immune system. monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells and neutrophils are also depressed. defects in natural killer cell cytotoxicity limited the antiviral response to virus. perforin is a pore-forming molecule that allows apoptotic molecules to enter and cause osmotic lysis of target cells. adult V9V2-T cells expressed significantly increased perforin, IFN- and TNF- after influenza virus stimulation. IPP is a 246-Da molecule with a five-carbon isopentenyl chain and a pyrophosphate moiety. it is the first ligand for human V9V2-T cells and rapidly induces signal transduction pathways associated with the TCR. IPP can still expand neonatal V9V2-T cells to a certain degree. authors declare no potential conflicts of interests."}
