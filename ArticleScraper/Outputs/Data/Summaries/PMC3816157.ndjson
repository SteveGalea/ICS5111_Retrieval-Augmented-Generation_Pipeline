{"summary": "feline chronic gingivostomatitis syndrome (FCGS) is a multifactorial disease, very commonly seen in clinical practice. it is described as a severe oral inflammation (gingivitis, stomatitis and/or periodontitis) and may be secondary to various causes such as neoplasia, toxins or even metabolic disease. an immune mediated etiology should always be considered. long-acting corticosteroids are also a well-known cause of insulin-resistance [10,11] by inducing chronic hyperglycemia which can lead to a glucotoxic beta-cell insufficiency [10], therefore, being a potential cause of type II diabetes mellitus (DM) in cats, long-acting corticosteroids are controversial in this species in general. rFeIFN- is a useful alternative management option for refractory FCGS. it may also be of particular interest in cats where corticosteroid administration is contraindicated. rFeIFN- was successfully administered as an alternative therapy for concurrent FCGS. the cat was fed with a diabetic specific diet (Purina DM) and insulin-glargine (1 IU/cat SC BID) after three days of hospitalization, the cat was discharged. after a gradual decrease of insulin therapy, the cat went into remission of the DM and insulin therapy was stopped. the cat developed a severe dysphagia with hypersalivation and weight loss. the cat had only a mild gingivitis and stomatitis, without significant pain. the animal had been treated only with rFeIFN-, which was not discontinued due to the good clinical results obtained. the animal was started on the oral rFeIFN- protocol. despite the persistence of gingivitis and caudal stomatitis, the owners reported a significant pain relief. three months later, five months after the beginning of therapy, the cat presented with a good clinical condition. cat presented with gingivitis and caudal stomatitis which extended to the palatoglossal folds. after initial workup, a type II DM complicated with ketoacidosis was diagnosed. after three days of hospitalization and a good initial response to this insulin, the cat was discharged. the cat started to improve gradually, and 2 months later the owners described a significant improvement of mastication and reduced evidence of pain. the cat had been treated only with rFeIFN-, which was not discontinued due to the good clinical results obtained. animal had a significant alveolar and caudal mucositis, with concurrent inflammation of palatoglossal folds and severe pain on mouth manipulation. owners had made some HBGC that revealed inconstant values. after three days of hospitalization, the animal was discharged and owners performed weekly HMBG curves. osteroids are considered a risk-factor for DM in cats. the animals required insulin therapy and a concurrent suitable diet. clinical remission was obtained 10 and 18 weeks after starting insulin therapy. both cases were infected with calicivirus. oral human interferon-alpha administration may potentiate a local T-helper 1 response (Th1) [23]. human interferon-alpha seems to increase the expression of gamma-interferon, a Th1 cytokine inducer, while it reduces the Interleukin-4 production, responsible for a T-helper 2 response. further controlled prospective studies are needed to correlating these clinical findings.
