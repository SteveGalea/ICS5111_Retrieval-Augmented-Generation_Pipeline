{"summary": "the provincial transfer authorization centre (PTAC) was established as a part of the emergency response in Ontario, Canada to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2003. prior to 2003, data relating to inter-facility patient transfers were not collected in a systematic manner. in an emergency setting, a comprehensive database with a complex data collection process was established. inter-facility patient transfers occur for routine to urgent reasons. despite the great volume of patient movement due to inter-facility transfers, these movements were not tracked, monitored or documented in a systematic manner. the provincial transfer authorization centre (PTAC) was operational within days of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care suspending all patient inter-facility transfers. ility patient transfers comprehensively at the provincial level for the first time. there are very limited population-based studies of inter-facility patient transfers. the validation of these databases is an important step in determining the quality of their data before they are used for research purposes. the PTAC database captures all requests for inter-facility patient transfers. a random sample of 100 patient transfer records was selected from the PTAC database. a total of 100 patient transfers were examined at each of the 10 selected facilities. a sample of 100 was selected because it would allow detectable differences in error rates between the PTAC forms and the institutional patient records as small as 10% with 95% confidence. a single researcher (VR) conducted the entire chart review eliminating errors stemming from multiple abstractors. PTAC report fields were compared to the institutional patient record for each patient from the sending facility. the institution patient record was selected as the gold standard because it is at that point during the transfer that the data contained in both sources should be identical. the two free text variables were deemed to be an exact match with the PTAC form if the information was consistent with the institutional patient record. the institution patient record was taken as the gold standard. accuracy and sensitivity measures are the most appropriate validation processes. sensitivity and accuracy were calculated using accuracy rates. the PTAC database captures all requests for inter-facility patient transfers. a random sample of 100 patient transfer records was selected from the PTAC database. a total of 100 patient transfers were examined at each of the 10 selected facilities. healthcare facilities Number of transfers (during the sample period) Representation of total number of transfers during entire study period Ideal relative number of facilities to be sampled (out of 10) Total number of facilities in sampling frame Number of teaching facilities to be sampled Number of nursing homes/long term care facilities to be sampled. the PTAC report fields were compared to the institutional patient record for each patient from the sending facility. the institution patient record was selected as the gold standard because it is at that point during the transfer that the data contained in both sources should be identical. data variables included patient last name, first name, age, sex, sending facility, receiving facility, medical supervision during transfer, transfer status and the primary reason for the transfer. accuracy and error rate numerators do not include missing data. results Of the 100 institutional patient records sought in this validation process, 95 were located. acy and error results Variable Accuracy rate (%), (95% CI) Error rate (%) Missing data Missing from PTAC (%) Missing from both (%) Facility identification and timing Sending facility 100.0, (100.0\u2013100.0) 0.0 0 0 Receiving facility 91.6 (87.9\u201395.2) 3.2 0 5.3 0 Date of transfer 85.3 (83.0\u201387.5) 1.1 0 13.7 0 Demographics Last name 91.6 the gold standard was the institutional patient record from the sending facility. the data variable categories of facility identification and timing, demographics and reason and urgency of transfer all had variables that had consistently strong accuracy rates and sensitivity values. the highest overall error rate (8.4%) was for the last name variable. the PTAC database can be used as a legitimate data source for population-based research. this paper presents a unique example of using institutional patient records as a gold standard to validate an external database. long-term care."}
