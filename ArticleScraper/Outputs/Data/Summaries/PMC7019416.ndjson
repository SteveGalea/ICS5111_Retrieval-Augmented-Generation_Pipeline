{"summary": "acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is caused by severe pulmonary vascular dysfunction. it is characterized by acute onset of dyspnea, tachycardia, hypoxemia associated with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and systemic inflammation. no effective therapeutic agent targeting the pathologic disease has been procured to date. pathologic nature of inflammation promoting inflammatory response12 is recognized and the character of \u201cmicrothrombi\u201d leading to multiple hematologic phenotypes is uncovered. the true mechanism of in vivo hemostasis in vascular injury and three different thrombogenetic mechanisms within hemostasis are uncovered. DIC is a clinical disorder of pathologic hemostasis associated with activated coagulation system such as DIC. ARDS is one of the major organ phenotypic disorders among MODS contributing to the death associated with microthrombosis in critically ill patients due to diseases such as sepsis, trauma and immune disorders. atitis.36,37 This multi-organ involvement suggests ARDS may not be primary disease but is likely a part of ongoing systemic pathogenetic mechanism due to infection or other critical illnesses. underlying physiologic alteration of MODS in sepsis and other critical illnesses is identified as circulatory dysfunction occurring as a result of EA-VMTD.11\u201313 This is an extremely important concept in the understanding for the pathogenesis. sepsis AIDS and viral sepsis Rickettsia Rickettsia rickettsii Rocky Mountain spotted fever and rickettsial sepsis Fungi Candida albicans Candida sepsis Parasites Plasmodium falciparum Malarial sepsis Abbreviations: AAI, acute adrenal insufficiency; ALF, acute liver failure; ARF, acute renal failure; DIC, false ARDS is a hemostatic disease due to endotheliopathy that promotes activation of two molecular pathways. one is inflammatory pathway, which releases cytokines and provokes inflammation, including fever, malaise, and myalgia. the other is microthrombotic pathway, which causes exocytosis of ULVWF and platelet activation. theliopathy-associated vascular microthrombotic disease, ECs, endothelial cells, HC, hepatic coagulopathy, MAHA/aMAHA, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia/atypical microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. the clinical features of ARDS are characterized by (1) acute onset of noncardiogenic respiratory distress, (2) bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and (3) evidence of diffuse circulatory obstruction. pathogenesis of ARDS is not due to multifactorial processes primarily involving the lungs, but is the result of one pathophysiologic mechanism affecting the lungs and multiorgans. this has been designated as thrombocytopenia in critically ill patients. the platelet consumption occurs when ULVWF release from endotheliopathy recruit platelets to form platelet-ULVWF complexes,1,9,12. this concept of TCIP is direct and unequivocal evidence that endotheliopathy promotes in vivo hemostasis. blood vessel damage limited to ECs in endotheliopathy activates ULVWF path, but TF path is not activated if subendothelial tissue (SET) major participating components Components Origin Mechanism (1) ECs/SET/EVT Blood vessel wall/EVT Protective barrier (2) ULVWF ECs Endothelial exocytosis/anchoring and microthrombogenesis (3) Platelets Circulation Adhesion to ULVWF strings and microthrombogenesis (3) Vascular injury and hemostatic phenotypes Injury-induced damage Involved hemostatic path Level of vascular injury and examples (1) ECs ULVWF Level 1 the blood vessel wall is the site of hemostasis (coagulation) to produce hemostatic plug in vascular injury to stop hemorrhage from external vascular injury. it is also the site of hemostasis (thrombogenesis) to produce intravascular blood clots in intravascular injury to cause thrombosis. SET injury promotes the release of sTF from the outside of blood vessel wall. this concept is important in the understanding of endotheliopathy leading to ARDS. ARDS indicates acute respiratory distress syndrome; ECs, endothelial cells; eTF, extravascular TF; EVT, extravascular tissue; RBC, red blood cell; SET, subendothelial TF; TF, tissue factor; ULVWF. ARDS with coexisting TTP-like syndrome responded dramatically when therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) was employed in very early stage of ARDS. it was also caused by the fact that ARDS has never been considered to be a hemostatic disease, and further TTP-like syndrome was unknown to be caused by endotheliopathy. vascular microthrombosis can explain the compromised vascular circulatory function of the lungs and occlusive lesions in pulmonary angiography better than any of other propositions. proposed theories for pathogenesis of ARDS include pulmonary endothelial injury leading to endothelial dysfunction due to inflammatory cytokines. ARDS is just one phenotype among MODS associated with increased microvascular permeability due to VMTD involving multi-organs. ARDS, HUS, and every organ syndrome are also the manifestations of EA-VMTD/DIT. ARDS is not the cause of MODS, but all the organ phenotypes of MODS as well as ARDS are collateral syndromes provoked by VMTD. this will be discussed in heading of tropism and endothelial heterogeneity within pathophysiological mechanisms involved in ARDS. endotheliopathy plays a major role in sepsis with inflammation and coagulation. inflammation coexists with other organ phenotypes such as encephalopathy, acute renal failure, myocardial infarction, pancreatitis, fulminant hepatic failure, adrenal insufficiency. a 1996 study in japan found that a diagnosis of DIC complicated about 1.0% of admissions to university hospitals. DIC is a condition in which blood clots form throughout the body\u2019s small blood vessels. it can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels, which can damage the body\u2019s organs. the reinterpretation of \u201cDIC\u201d based on \u201ctwo-path unifying theory\u201d of hemostasis and the mechanism of thrombogenesis clearly support that it occurs as a result of activated ULVWF path. the true character of blood clots in \u201cDIC\u201d is the same microthrombi occurring in VMTD as seen in TTP and TTP-like syndrome. thrombogenesis takes two different paths in normal hemostasis. microthrombotic (ULVWF) and fibrinogenetic (TF) are involved in normal hemostasis. however, in the different level of intravascular injury, thrombogenesis takes two different paths. each pathogenesis occurs when ULVWF path, TF path, and/or combined paths are utilized depending upon the vascular levels of damage in intravascular injury. characters of microthrombi, fibrin clots, and macrothrombus from different paths are very different and produce distinctly different clinical thrombotic disorders. acute \"DIC\" is characterized by thrombocytopenia, MAHA, MODS, and severe hemorrhagic syndrome. chronic \"DIC\" is characterized by thrombocytopenia, MAHA, MODS, and severe hemorrhagic syndrome. thrombocytopenia, MAHA, and MODS without coagulopathy are similar but \u201cdifferent diseases\u201d77\u201382. the reason was the clinical trials were designed based on incorrect pathogenetic mechanism. but the reason is unexplained. DIC occurs in ARDS in which fibrin clots are formed by fibrinogenesis via extrinsic coagulation cascade from activated aberrant TF path. sepsis-associated coagulopathy can be readily understood as true DIC. ARDS is an organ phenotype of hemostatic disease occurring as a result of generalized endotheliopathy (ea-VMTD/DIT) ARDS also occurs in association with trauma to the chest/lungs and head/brain,14,15 complications of surgery, pregnancy and transplant,16\u201320 certain drug, toxin, chemicals and venom exposure, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)-like syndrome. some clinicians have interpreted DIC was the cause of ARDS, but others have proposed it was the result of ARDS. transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is characterized by acute noncardiogenic circulatory disorder of the lungs following blood product transfusions. ARDS may not be primary disease but is likely a part of ongoing systemic pathogenetic mechanism due to infection or other critical illnesses. underlying physiologic alteration of MODS in sepsis and other critical illnesses is identified as circulatory dysfunction occurring as result of EA-VMTD. DIC/DIC DIT EA-VMTD/DIT MAHA TTP-like syndrome Viruses Hantavirus Ebola virus Corona viruses Dengue virus Influenza A (H1N1) virus HIV Epidemic hemorrhagic fever and viral sepsis AIDS and viral sepsis Rickettsia Rickettsia rickettsii Rocky Mountain spotted fever and rickettsial sepsis Fungi Candida alb endothelial molecular pathogenesis of ARDS and MODS in critically ill patients is succinctly illustrated. the underlying pathologic nature of ARDS is a hemostatic disease due to endotheliopathy that promotes activation of two molecular pathways. one is inflammatory pathway, which releases cytokines and provokes inflammation, including fever, malaise, and myalgia. the other is microthrombotic pathway, which causes exocyto disseminated intravascular thrombosis orchestrates consumptive thrombocytopenia, MAHA, MODS, and TTP-like syndrome. ARDS indicates acute respiratory distress syndrome; DIT, disseminated intravascular thrombosis; EA-VMTD, endotheliopathy-associated vascular microthrombotic disease; ECs, endothelial cells; HC, hepatic coagulopathy; hepatic coagulopathy pathological features of ARDS are characterized by (1) diffuse alveolar damage associated with injury to alveolar lining and endothelial cells (ECs), (2) exudative pulmonary edema, and (3) hyaline membrane formation. these pathologic changes are very similar, if not identical, in each ARDS caused by different pathogens and insults. ARDS is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage associated with injury to alveolar lining and endothelial cells (ECs), exudative pulmonary edema, and (3) hyaline membrane formation. pathologic features of ARDS are very similar, if not identical in each ARDS caused by different pathogens and insults. pathogenesis of ARDS is not due to multifactorial processes primarily involving the lungs, but is the result of one pathophysiologic mechanism affecting the lungs and multiorgans. thrombocytopenia occurs in ARDS during the course of the disease. TCIP is found to be consumptive thrombocytopenia caused by microthrombogenesis that leads to EA-VMTD/DIT.9 Table 3. Hemostatic principles (1) Hemostasis can be activated only by vascular injury. ECs/SET ULVWF + sTF Level 2 damage. eVT alone eTF level e damage. blood vessel wall is the site of hemostasis (coagulation) to produce hemostatic plug in vascular injury to stop hemorrhage from external vascular injury. it is also the site of hemostasis (thrombogenesis) to produce intravascular blood clots in intravascular injury to cause thrombosis. each component has different function contributing to molecular hemostasis. the degree of thrombocytopenia in sepsis was associated with increased severity and higher mortality54,55. thrombocytopenia was an increased risk and predictive for patient mortality in ARDS. masked microangiopathic hemolytic anemia was less prominent in ARDS with fewer schistiocytes than that in acquired immune TTP. ARDS has never been considered to be a hemostatic disease. it was also caused by the fact that ARDS has never been considered to be a hemostatic disease. it was also caused by the fact that ARDS has never been considered to be a hemostatic disease. vascular microthrombosis has been well recognized as the underlying disease of TTP and more recently as that of TTP-like syndrome, which occurs in EA-VMTD. vascular microthrombosis could contribute its clinical expression as ARDS in the lungs, but also as MODS in other vital organs. phenotype among MODS associated with increased microvascular permeability due to VMTD involving multi-organs. this is also true for current biorgan designation syndromes such as hepatorenal syndrome, cardiopulmonary syndrome, pulmonary\u2013renal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy, and others. ARDS is not the cause of MODS, but all the organ phenotypes of MODS as well as ARDS are collateral syndromes. this will be discussed in the heading of tropism and endothelial heterogeneity within pathophysiological mechanisms involved in ARDS. inflammation and microthrombosis in endotheliopathy are two separate processes. inflammation alone is not the major factor causing poor outcome of the patient. inflammation alone is not the major factor causing poor outcome of the patient, but clinical severity of MODS caused by VMTD is the main culprit. mbogenesis has not been identified yet. it is because the physiological mechanism of in vivo hemostasis has been incompletely understood. there is no simple answer on the difference between DIC and microthrombosis. the pathophysiological mechanism of \u201cDIC\u201d is not TF/FVIIa complex-activated coagulation cascade but rather is partial hemostasis due to lone activation of ULVWF path. this author has derived two theories of \u201ctwo-activation theory of the endothelium\u201d and \u201ctwo-path unifying theory\u201d of hemostasis. in pathologic hemostasis, aberrant TF activation occurs and produces fibrin clots (ie, true DIC) in APL due to TF expression in intravascular space from leukemic promyelocytes. there are 3 different thrombogenetic paths in \"two-path unifying theory\" each thrombogenetic path occurs when ULVWF path, TF path, and/or combined paths are utilized depending upon the vascular levels of damage in intravascular injury. the characters of the thrombus/blood clot from different paths are unique and produce distinct clinical thrombotic disorders. acute \"DIC\" is characterized by thrombocytopenia, MAHA, MODS, and severe hemorrhagic syndrome without coagulopathy. chronic \"DIC\" is characterized by thrombocytopenia, MAHA, and MODS without coagulopathy. \u201cDIC\u201d is incorrect in its concept but is consistent with EA-VMTD/DIT. chronic \u201cDIC\u201d is incorrect term, which should be EA-VMTD/DIT without hepatic coagulopathy. DIC is associated with sepsis, trauma, and other critical illnesses. ARDS is an organ phenotype of hemostatic disease occurring as a result of generalized endotheliopathy. generalized endotheliopathy activates inflammatory pathway independent of microthrombotic pathway. thrombocytopenia commonly occurs in ARDS during the course of the disease. hemostatic principles: blood vessel damage limited to ECs in endotheliopathy activates ULVWF path, but TF path is not activated if subendothelial tissue (SET)/extravascular tissue (EVT) is not compromised. TCIP is found to be consumptive thrombocytopenia caused by microthrombogenesis that leads to EA-VMTD/DIT. SET and EVT release from tissue due to vascular injury and fibrinogenesis. ECs ULVWF level 1 damage\u2014Macrothrombosis (eg, AIS; DVT; PE; AA) the blood vessel wall is the site of hemostasis (coagulation) to produce hemostatic plug in vascular injury to stop hemorrhage from external vascular injury. it is also the site of hemostasis (thrombogenesis) to produce intravascular blood clots in intravascular injury to cause thrombosis. ARDS indicates acute respiratory distress syndrome; ECs, endothelial cells; eTF, extravascular TF; EVT, extravascular tissue; SET, subendothelial TF; TF, tissue factor; ULVWF, unusually large von Willebrand factor multimers. thrombocytopenia was an increased risk and predictive for patient mortality in ARDS. ARDS was employed in very early stage of ARDS. it was due to inconspicuous schistocytosis and unsuspected diagnosis. it was also due to diametrically different pathogeneses between TTP and TTP-like syndrome, in which clear distinction has not been recognized until recently. othelial dysfunction due to inflammatory cytokines or activated immune cells,63 upregulation of adhesion molecules such as soluble vascular adhesion molecule 1 and E-selectin,64,65 interactions between neutrophils and cytokines. these theories cannot answer why inflammation in ARDS is frequently associated with simultaneous hematologic syndromes and MODS. the organ phenotype of ARDS in the lungs is caused by microvascular thrombosis, which is also characteristic of TTP, TTP-like syndrome, \u201cDIC\u201d and thrombotic microangiopathy. ARDS is just one phenotype among MODS associated with increased microvascular permeability due to VMTD involving multi-organs. ARDS is not the cause of MODS, but all the organ phenotypes of MODS as well as ARDS are collateral syndromes provoked by VMTD. this will be discussed in the heading of tropism and endothelial heterogeneity within pathophysiological mechanisms involved in ARDS. in severe ARDS, inflammation coexists with other organ phenotypes such as encephalopathy, acute renal failure, myocardial infarction, pancreatitis, fulminant hepatic failure, adrenal insufficiency, and others.8\u201312 In severe ARDS, inflammation coexists with other organ phenotypes such as encephalopathy, acute renal failure, myocardial infarction, pancreatitis, fulminant DIC is a widespread hypercoagulable state that can lead to both microvascular and macrovascular clotting and compromise blood flow. it is because the physiological mechanism of in vivo hemostasis has been incompletely understood. there is no simple answer on the difference between DIC and microthrombosis. in vivo hemostatic process, microthrombi and fibrin clots can be easily differentiated. the true character of blood clots in \u201cDIC\u201d is the same microthrombi occurring in VMTD as seen in TTP and TTP-like syndrome. the pathophysiological mechanism of \u201cDIC\u201d is not TF/FVIIa complex-activated coagulation cascade but instead is partial hemostasis due to lone activation of ULVWF path. thrombogenesis takes two paths to conclude normal hemostasis with passive role of NETs. if level of intravascular injury is confined to the endothelium, lone ULVWF path becomes activated and causes microthrombosis. if only SET/EVT is injured, available TF is supposed to activate lone TF path. the concept of hemostasis is based on the concept of primary hemostasis in a local vascular injury followed by secondary hemostasis forming fibrin clots. however, this concept cannot explain microthrombi and thrombus formation. \"DIC\" is uncontrolled \"TF path\" initiated coagulation disorder. \"DIC\" is caused by microthrombosis initiated by \"platelet-ULVWF complex\" \"DIC\" is characterized by thrombocytopenia, MAHA, MODS, and severe hemorrhagic syndrome. \u201cDIC\u201d is incorrect in its concept but is consistent with EA-VMTD/DIT. chronic \u201cDIC\u201d is incorrect term, which should be EA-VMTD/DIT without hepatic coagulopathy. acute \u201cDIC\u201d is incorrect term but is consistent with EA-VMTD/DIT. phenotype is TTP-like syndrome with or without hepatic coagulopathy. on the other hand, hepatic coagulopathy via fibrinogenesis can be understood as true DIC. it is no wonder why we could not unmask the true identity of \u201cDIC\u201d term used more than 60 years to date. membrane attack complex exerts deleterious effects to host\u2019s ECs90 unless CD59 glycoprotein is adequately expressed in ECs. MAC attacks the membrane of ECs, channel formation develops on the endothelial membrane90. endothelial dysfunction via activation of complement cascade is suspected to be the major component contributing to pathologic hemostasis of ARDS. ARDS pathogenesis has been assured to be the result of pathologic hemostasis. ARDS is not the primary disease causing various organ dysfunction syndromes. but is the secondary syndrome due to one of hypoxic organ dysfunction resulting from microthrombosis caused by endotheliopathy just like other MODS. ARDS and other MODS would respond to the same treatment based on the same pathophysiological mechanism. the endothelium is distributed to the entire organ system and tissue of human body and protects from internal disease and external bodily injury through hemostasis. ARDS and additional organ syndromes start with an equal footing in systemic VMTD. but the severity of selective organ damage is determined by the localization through selectivity of endothelial heterogeneity and tropism. authors have claimed one organ phenotypic syndrome such as ARDS has caused several other organ dysfunctions, including pancreatitis. microthrombosis in ARDS is a distinctly different disease from macrothrombosis seen in DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) it has taken several decades to recognize microthrombosis is a distinctly different disease from macrothrombosis seen in DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) DIC, thrombotic microangiopathy, HUS, and ARDS are characterized by DIT involving the vital organs. hematologic phenotype is TTP-like syndrome, which hematologic phenotype is TTP-like syndrome. ARDS is characterized by generalized endotheliopathy without compromise of SET/EVT. sepsis is characterized by generalized endotheliopathy without compromise of SET/EVT. if the intravascular damage is confined to the ECs, lone ULVWF path becomes activated and causes microthrombosis. if the damage extends from the ECs to SET (level 2), both ULVWF path and TF path become activated and form macrothrombosis. if the damage extends from the ECs to beyond vessel wall including SET, both ULVWF path and TF path become activated. each thrombogenesis occurs when ULVWF path, TF path, or combined paths are activated depending upon the levels of damage in intravascular injury. characters of microthrombi, fibrin clots, and macrothrombus from different paths are very different and produce distinct clinical thrombotic disorders. endothelial molecular pathogenesis promoting microthrombogenesis has not been understood until recently. the pathophysiological mechanism of endotheliopathy causing VMTD has not been understood until recently. activation of endothelial inflammatory pathway occurs due to cytokines in septic and nonseptic critical illnesses. activation of endothelial inflammatory pathway occurs due to cytokines in both septic and nonseptic critical illnesses. complement activation could promote destructive action to innocent bystander of the endothelium of the host. complement activation could promote destructive action to innocent bystander of the endothelium of the host. endothelial dysfunction in ARDS activates 2 major molecular mechanisms. one is severe inflammation caused by inflammatory cytokines released from the endothelium. the other is hypoxic organ dysfunction caused by partial hemostasis via microthrombogenesis. esion molecules could play a secondary role through endothelial heterogeneity and NETosis in the phenotypes of ARDS-associated MODS. ARDS is not the primary disease causing various organ dysfunction syndromes but is the secondary syndrome due to one of hypoxic organ dysfunction resulting from microthrombosis. both ARDS and other MODS occur as a result of the same pathophysiological mechanism, which is now identified to be microthrombo a similar organ phenotype can occur due to different types of pathogens. a common occurrence of combined syndrome of ARDS and acute necrotizing pancreatitis. some authors have claimed one organ phenotypic syndrome such as ARDS has caused several other organ dysfunctions. but the severity of selective organ damage is determined by the localization through selectivity of endothelial heterogeneity and tropism. the term extrapulmonary manifestations or extrapulmonary phenotypes of ARDS are misrepresentation. the term of microthrombogenesis is defined in previously mentioned two hemostatic theories. both theories are congruent to each other. the two-activation theory of the endothelium represents endothelial molecular pathogenesis following exocytosis of ULVWF in endotheliopathy. thrombogenesis of ULVWF path and fibrinogenesis of TF path have contributed to the redrawing of the framework on two different thrombogenetic mechanisms. the former assembles microthrombi strings as seen in VMTD such as TTP, TTP-like syndrome, \u201cDIC\u201d, HUS, ARDS, and the latter generates fibrin clots as seen in APL and certain envenomation. disseminated microthrombosis presents with many intriguing features such as ARDS and HUS. thrombocytopenia, MAHA, TTP-like syndrome, and DIC. two thrombotic/coagulation pathways are initiated in normal hemostasis. thrombogenesis occurs when ULVWF path, TF path, or combined paths are activated depending upon the levels of damage in intravascular injury. ARDS is a hemostatic disease made of \u201cmicrothrombi strings\u201d. ARDS, ARDS, MODS Level 2 Endothelium + SET ULVWF and TF paths Macrothrombosis DVT, PE, AIS, AA Level 3 Endothelium + SET + EVT ULVWF and TF paths Macrothrombosis and hemorrhage THS Extravascular tissue damage from obtuse trauma. sepsis is the initiating cause of microthrombosis and ARDS is the manifestation of organ phenotype of microthrombosis. thrombocytopenia, MAHA, MODS, TTP-like syndrome, and SIRS may occur simultaneously in both sepsis and ARDS. inflammation is accentuated, perhaps through additional loop of activated immune cell pathway (eg, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes) interacting with activated ECs. this additional mechanism may explain why more severe inflammation occurs in sepsis than in trauma. the existence of two utterly different characters of blood clots has contributed to the redrawing of the framework on two different thrombogenetic mechanisms. the latter assembles microthrombi strings as seen in VMTD such as TTP, TTP-like syndrome, \u201cDIC\u201d, HUS, ARDS, and the latter generates fibrin clots as seen in aortic aneurysm. hemostasis is characterized by generalized endotheliopathy without compromise of SET/EVT. lone activation of ULVWF path on ECs leads to formation of microthrombosis. bleeding does not develop because SET and EVT damage do not occur. d and cause macrothrombosis (eg, DVT; acute ischemic stroke) as illustrated in hemostatic theory. if the damage extends from the ECs to beyond vessel wall including SET and EVT, both ULVWF path and TF path become activated. if the damage extends from the ECs to beyond vessel wall including SET and EVT, bleeding occurs into EVT in smaller vessels. endothelial molecular pathogenesis promoting microthrombogenesis has been well known and documented in medical literature. the endothelial molecular pathogenesis promoting microthrombogenesis has not been well known and documented. pathophysiological mechanism of endotheliopathy causing VMTD has remained in mystery. pathogenesis of microthrombosis orchestrating hematologic expressions. thrombocytopenia, MAHA, MODS, and TTP-like syndrome may occur simultaneously. activation of endothelial inflammatory pathway occurs due to cytokines in septic and nonseptic critical illnesses. this pathway further upregulates the expression of inflammatory response, sometimes causing \u201ccytokine storm\u201d. ARDS is an expression of hemostatic disease that is characterized by VMTD. acute respiratory distress syndrome is the most prominent organ phenotype syndromes developing in sepsis and other critical illnesses among MODS. ARDS and other organ syndromes are the manifestations of each specific organ phenotype in EA-VMTD/DIT. clinical, etiologic, pathogenetic, and Phenotypic Features of ARDS Based on EA-VMTD/DIT. no pharmacologic treatments aimed at the underlying pathology have been shown to be effective to date. the proper diagnostic approach of ARDS should start with hematological evaluation. every patient with ARDS should be evaluated for the potential of unrecognized TTP-like syndrome. clinicians should stay vigilant with close clinical monitoring for developing additional organ phenotypes of ARDS. the diagnostic assessments are summarized in Table 6. ARDS has underlying EA-VMTD/DIT clinical features TCIP (consumptive thrombocytopenia) ADAMTS13 gene mutation abbreviations: EA-VMTD, endotheliopathy-associated VMTD; DIT, disseminated intravascular microthrombosis; HC, hepatic coagulopathy; LDH, lactic acid dehydrogenase; MAHA, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia; MODS, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome; TCIP, thrombocytopenia in critically ill patients; VMTD, vascular micro ARDS is the most important organ phenotype among MODS that could haveten the demise of the patient due to severe hypoxemia. at this time, the earliest intervention utilizing TPE is the only potentially effective treatment to save lives. the most efficient therapeutic regimen would be antimicrothrombotic agents. both agents are neither approved nor used for human use as defined antimicrothrombotic agents. the worsening thrombocytopenia (ie, TCIP) is the most important sign suggesting progression of ARDS. schistocytes are fewer in ARDS than antibodies-associated TTP (AA-VMTD, acquired TTP),23,24,132. thrombocytopenia and intravascular hemolysis may be the sufficient criteria to establish the diagnosis of TTP-like syndrome. TCIP (consumptive thrombocytopenia) \u2013 After exclusion of identifiable thrombocytopenia MAHA with evidence of hemolysis \u2013 With/without schistocytosis \u2013 Reticulocytosis \u2013 Hypohaptoglobinemia \u2013 Increased LDH \u2013 Indirect hyperbilirubinemia \u2013 If markedly elevated, may support associated HC in EA-VMTD/DIT ADAMTS13 antibody \u2013 If markedly decreased the pathophysiologic mechanism of ARDS has not been clearly recognized. the failure of therapeutic regimens to restore the physiologic alteration of ARDS from endotheliopathy certainly indicates that the pathogenesis of ARDS is yet to be discovered. authors confident that novel hemostatic \u201ctwo-path unifying theory\u201d and \u201ctwo-activation theory of the endothelium\u201d uncover this long hidden mystery. the earliest intervention utilizing TPE is the only potentially effective treatment to save lives. if the patient is entrenched in mechanical ventilation with volume overload, the recovery from ARDS may become remote even with TPE. the most efficient therapeutic regimen would be antimicrothrombotic agents. the pathophysiologic mechanism of ARDS has not been clearly recognized. the pathogenesis of ARDS is yet to be discovered. ARDS is a hemostatic disease called pulmonary vascular microthrombosis. ARDS is the most important organ phenotype among MODS that could haveten the demise of the patient due to severe hypoxemia. at this time, the earliest intervention utilizing TPE is the only potentially effective treatment to save lives. hepatic coagulopathy could rapidly progress to combined microthrombo-hemorrhagic syndrome. pathogenesis of ARDS is a hemostatic disease occurring due to lone activation of ULVWF path of hemostasis in critically ill patients."}
