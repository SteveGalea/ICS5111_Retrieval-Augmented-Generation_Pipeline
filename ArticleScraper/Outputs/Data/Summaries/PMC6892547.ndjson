{"summary": "one health approach recognizes that complex health challenges are beyond the purview of any one sector or discipline working in isolation. a resilient health workforce must be capable of effective and collaborative prevention and detection of, as well as response to emerging health challenges. the formal global health construct known today as One Health wasn\u2019t officially recognized by international and scholarly bodies until 1984 [8] emerging disease threats can cross national borders, cultures and species. the subsequent decades which were marked by unprecedented global interconnectedness and human mobility were associated with threats to global health security. this article supports such efforts by identifying key factors that support effective collaboration around health events. despite widespread recognition of the importance of a One Health approach, there exists a gap in the literature regarding what constitutes a successful One Health collaboration. scholars of cross-boundary collaborations point to the importance of leadership, shared goals, trust and mutual understanding, institutional structures and resources, communication, and data management. review of literature on cross-boundary collaborations suggests a lack of validated metrics for measuring collaborative effectiveness and performance. global health community grapples with the fundamental questions of what characterizes a successful One Health approach. emphasis on multisectoral and transdisciplinary collaboration and a call for strengthening human, animal and environmental health systems through a One Health approach. cross-boundary collaborations are not unique to any discipline, yet there is very little cross-fertilization of research across disciplines. this research builds upon the existing literature on cross-boundary collaborations and applies it to one health collaborations. the literature on cross-boundary collaborations focuses on three critical phases of a successful cross-boundary collaboration. study focuses on three critical phases of a successful cross-boundary collaboration: adequate starting conditions, an effective process of collaboration, and attention to the outcomes of collaboration [16\u201320]. starting conditions There is a general consensus in the literature on cross-boundary collaborations that starting conditions-the conditions in place before any collaborative process begins\u2014impact the process, structures and outcomes of collaboration. scholars of cross-boundary collaborations highlight the importance of measuring the outcomes of collaboration. the literature on cross-boundary collaborations and its attention to the starting conditions, processes, and outcomes of collaborative approaches have informed this study on the factors that enable effective One Health collaborations. the authors decided to limit this literature review to the PubMed database at the outset of the study. the decision to use one database reflects the exploratory nature of this study and the Author\u2019s intent to propose further hypothesis-driven research. article search terms (yielded 2,630 unduplicate results) searched Communicable Disease Control Population Surveillance Zoonoses/epidemiology Zoonoses/organization & administration Zoonoses/prevention and control Disease Outbreaks/organization & administration Disease Outbreaks/prevention and control Interprofessional Relations Cooperative Behavior Community Networks. interdisciplinary team conducted an analysis of the 50 articles that explicitly addressed multisectoral collaboration in response to an actual health event. each reviewer coded approximately 5\u201310 selected articles using the qualitative data analysis software, MaxQDA [28]. predetermined codes were used to identify individuals or groups involved in each health event response. the team used the code \u201croles\u201d to identify individuals or groups involved in the coordinated response in a formal role based on individual expertise and formal training. a first round of organizing codes differentiated between collaborations that actually happened versus ideal scenarios and hypothetical lessons. the text was further coded to reflect whether the authors were reporting a success factor of collaboration, or a challenge of collaboration. both the successes and challenges reported in the literature were related during the grounded theory thematic analysis. a scoping literature review was conducted to identify key factors that facilitate multisectoral collaborations around major health events. a scoping review is well-suited for a field such as One Health that is still relatively new and evolving, as the method allows for assessment of emerging evidence. meSH terms were used to identify articles discussing multisectoral health events and collaborations. this initial MeSH search identified 2,630 non-duplicated articles. this scoping review was conducted in order to support more hypothesis driven research for One Health. 179 abstracts met initial inclusion criteria and full articles were procured and reviewed. the research team divided into transdisciplinary pairs. each of the articles that met the initial inclusion criteria were independently reviewed according to the modified screening criteria. interdisciplinary team conducted an analysis of the 50 articles that explicitly addressed multisectoral collaboration in response to an actual health event. each reviewer coded approximately 5\u201310 selected articles using the qualitative data analysis software, MaxQDA [28] code \u201croles\u201d to identify individuals or groups who participated in the coordinated response in a formal role based on individual expertise and formal training. a third type of classification in the literature was more general categorization of sectors involved, such as the traditional designations of Public, Non-profit, and Private/For-profit. the findings were related during the grounded theory thematic analysis and informed the final thematic results reported. the authors employed a deductive framework developed from the review of literature on multisectoral collaboration. a subset of articles represents a diverse crosssection of transdisciplinary efforts around emerging health events. the search included peer-reviewed articles available to-date in the U.S. National Library of Medicine\u2019s PubMed database that were searched using specified MeSH terms. the research team thus elected to work with a university of Minnesota research librarian to develop MeSH terms for this study. article search terms (yielded 2,630 unduplicated results) searched Communicable Disease Control Population Surveillance Zoonoses/epidemiology Zoonoses/organization & administration Zoonoses/prevention and control Disease Outbreaks/epidemiology Disease Outbreaks/organization & administration Disease Outbreaks/prevention and control Interprofessional relations. disciplinary reviewers did not agree, the articles were brought to a full research team meeting and reviewed jointly until consensus among all researchers was achieved. the same method of collaborative review was used for the second round of screening and resulted in 50 articles for the final analysis. each paper was coded for the predetermined codes outlined in Table 3. Preliminary descriptive codes. the team used the code \u201croles\u201d to identify individuals or groups involved in the coordinated response in a formal role based on individual expertise and formal training. a first round of organizing codes differentiated between collaborations that actually happened versus ideal scenarios. the text was further coded to reflect whether the authors were reporting a success factor of collaboration, or a challenge of collaboration. both the successes and challenges reported in the literature were related during the grounded theory thematic analysis and informed the final thematic results reported. the scoping review team tried to overcome this by building an expanded list of search terms and conducting an iterative review process using two independent transdisciplinary reviewers. both methods offset this limitation and might have minimized the likelihood of missing specific content. the final subset of articles represents a diverse crosssection of transdisciplinary efforts around emerging health events. zoonotic agents were considered zoonotic, meaning they spread between humans and animals. involved parties or entities played varied roles and represented diverse disciplines and sectors. the team ultimately created organizing categories that reflected individual, organizational and network levels of collaboration. al Culture: leadership, accountability, ownership, trust, transparency of processes, existing relationships, systems based thinking, cultural awareness and engagement. organizational factors include 3) organizational structures, 4) organizational culture, 5) human resources, and 6) communication. training and capacity building provided a platform for better collaboration for outbreak response [49] NGOs support gov. through staff training [50] Participatory epidemiology training [51] Prior Experience & Existing Relationships (informal/formal) Pre-existing multisectoral relationships [45,52\u201355] Pre-existing multisectoral relationships [45,52\u201355] Previous experience collaborating for health events [34,56,57] Individual Factors Ad hoc \u201cjust-in culture leadership, accountability, ownership, trust, transparency of processes, systems based thinking, cultural awareness and engagement Leadership to support the iterative and developmental review of collaborative processes [58] Strong, engaged Leadership [32,35,52,68] Accountability, Ownership [67,68] Cultural Engagement; Engagement; Diversity/ Involvement of community [67,69] Trust [38,41,49,70] Transparency [31,34,61] Need to understand each other\u2019s processes [53,70] [65]Reporting structure [49,60] Creating shared protocols [45] Policies -Institutional\u2014nation-nation/ regional agreements [45,49,58,72]Basic public health and infection control measures including contact tracing, infection control procedures, and quarantine [62] Joint tasks forces and bilateral agreements ie.

Engagement of diverse stakeholders to reflect research team suggests 12 factors that may be used by practitioners involved in one health activities to more systematically assess the successes and challenges of multisectoral collaboration. researchers found this distinction was critical in our understanding of how successful collaborative processes are initiated. the absence of formalized training opportunities before an event was often reported as a gap and a challenge to effective one health response [40\u201342, 49] shared competencies were suggested as a strategy for standardizing protocols and performance across multiple individuals and organizations. ad hoc trainings do not replace or diminish the need for foundational technical training. literature review uncovered the role for strong university-based education and training. organizational structures, culture and resources were cited as important elements for creating an enabling environment for effective One Health collaboration. organizations reported the need for functional systems for information and resource management and sharing and reporting both surveillance and laboratory results. authors reflected on the importance of cultural awareness, transparency of communication processes and the engagement of diverse stakeholders. research suggests that workers need to be trained at an individual level, have defined roles and responsibilities at an organizational level, and need to be able to mobilize their efforts at a network level. ized operating foundation in which organizations and individuals could contribute. formalized roles and responsibilities supported effective human resource mobilization in both organizations and networks. lack of existing structures was reported to prevent efficient multisectoral engagement in the preparedness and response to health events. cultural awareness and inclusion of diverse stakeholders was consistently reported as a success factor for collaborative efforts if included from the start [33,34,37,42,51,52,56,59,61,75] a supportive political environment was reported to enable the flow of available financial, human and material resources and empowered decision making. authors noted the importance of a supportive political environment to aid in the development and institutionalization of effective collaborative structures. effective network management during an outbreak was reported in the areas of management practices, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), communication, awareness and ongoing stakeholder engagement. management practices included case and task management through the MCM [41], regularly scheduled meetings [53,58,60] and development of shared response guidelines and management protocols across the network. the importance of communications cannot be overemphasized and was repeatedly reported as an integral factor for building relationships, trust and supportive organizational culture. multiple methods of communication were reported including electronic communications, list-servs, contact lists and regular meetings. in many cases these were supported through existing MCMs [48,58] Monthly meetings [53,58,60] and establishing clear lines of communication were reported as critical. researchers created a code to capture reported outcomes of collaborative efforts. results were consistently missing or under-reported in the literature reviewed. authors noted outcomes of collaborative efforts were consistently missing or under-reported in the literature reviewed. authors have proposed a framework for evaluating outputs, outcomes, and what they refer to as \u201cadaptations\u201d of collaborative processes [18,19] authors from public affairs, such as Emerson and Nabatchi (2015) et al. have proposed a framework for analyzing and reporting on One Health collaborations. a proposed reporting framework based on the 12 identified factors. Describe the following factors as they existed prior to the health event/activity. Describe the following factors as they existed. research team had to negotiate and re-negotiate ways of working, integrate differing points of view and assign roles in ways to leverage expertise but not reinforce bias. the inherent challenge of interdisciplinary work is in how we talk about collaboration and the terminology we use to describe both theory and practice. researchers found that this distinction was critical in our understanding of how successful collaborative processes are initiated. starting conditions influence the process of collaboration, and the process itself can lead to improvement of structures and processes that will now inform improved starting conditions. individual factors that supported the process of collaboration were most frequently reported as workers having access to necessary education and training that was available ad hoc or as \u201cjust in time\u201d training to support operations during the health event. many of these trainings were reported to be rigorous and responsive with continuous follow-up to support compliance [39,42,49] organizations reported the need for functional systems for information and resource management and sharing and reporting both surveillance and laboratory results [41,43,45,48,48,55,59,63,64,64,66,67]. Organizational culture was reported in multiple key areas [31,35,38,38,41,48,49,60,61,68\u201370,81]. authors highlighted the importance of a reflexive workforce, i.e. human resources that could be mobilized quickly and efficiently to respond to health events in a rapidly changing context [31,42,45,57]. networks were reported to provide a foundation for effective collaborative efforts to occur across participating organizations. established multisectoral coordinateing mechanisms (MCMs) were often reported as key to assisting with collaboration across participating organizations. established structures allowed individuals, organizations and networks to more effectively respond once an emergency arose. development of formal and informal relationships prior to a health event allowed individuals, organizations and networks to more effectively respond once an emergency arose. a supportive political environment was reported to enable the flow of available financial, human and material resources. network leadership and management processes were critical to effective multisectoral response efforts. leadership engagement during a health event allowed for mobilization and needed support for management processes. strong and engaged network leadership was noted as an important success factor for collaboration. communication was deemed most effective when it was regular, frequent, and designed to foster awareness and support the engagement of a range of stakeholders. communication was deemed most effective when it was regular, frequent, and designed to foster awareness and support the engagement of a range of stakeholders, from local through national, regional and international levels. engagement of diverse stakeholders before, during, and after response reported as essential. diverse stakeholders included community and local actors, national governments, intergovernmental organizations, and operating partners [45,49,51\u201353,75] outcomes of collaborative efforts were consistently missing or under-reported in the literature reviewed. the majority of articles reviewed never discussed the evaluation of either the process of collaboration or the resulting outputs or outcomes. this creates a pivotal challenge in understanding how to improve One Health operations. the results of this scoping review are intended to support the next steps in supporting one health evaluation. individual factors Relevant success factors at the onset of a one health event include an individual\u2019s education and training. many of these trainings were reported to be rigorous and responsive. many were reported to be responsive with continuous follow-up to support compliance. ad hoc trainings do not replace or diminish the need for foundational technical training. authors recognized and identified the importance of strong and engaged leadership [31,34,52,68] and the need for leadership to support the iterative and developmental review of collaborative processes [53,68]. trust and credibility were consistently reported as a key element of organizational success [38,41,49,70] pre-existing network structures were reported to provide a foundation for effective collaborative efforts to occur across participating organizations. established multisectoral coordination mechanisms (MCMs) were often reported as key to assisting with collaboration across a network. development of formal and informal relationships prior to a health event allowed individuals, organizations and networks to more effectively respond once an emergency arose. preemptive planning for potential disease threats was reported to strengthen connections and relationships and support multisectoral disease training. a supportive political environment was reported to enable the flow of available financial, human and material resources. effective network management during an outbreak was reported in the areas of management practices, monitoring and evaluation, communication, awareness and ongoing stakeholder engagement. effective network management during an outbreak was reported in the areas of management practices, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), communication, awareness and ongoing stakeholder engagement. communication was deemed most effective when it was regular, frequent, and designed to foster awareness and support the engagement of a range of stakeholders. communication was deemed most effective when it was regular, frequent, and designed to foster awareness and support the engagement of a range of stakeholders, from local through national, regional and international levels. diversse partners, including foreign militaries, were reported to support foundational infrastructure that allowed other international partners to stay involved when supporting an effective response to a health event [39,71,79]. a number of authors pointed to the importance of being able to mobilize both the material and human resources. implementation of M&E activities was one of the major gaps in the reports of One Health collaboration. majority of articles reviewed never discussed the evaluation of either the process of collaboration or the resulting outputs or outcomes. this creates a pivotal challenge in understanding how to improve One Health operations. the results of this scoping review are intended to support the next steps in supporting One Health evaluation. the researchers propose this to the One Health community as a tangible next step that may lead to more effective reporting and potentially evaluation of One Health efforts in the future. a transdisciplinary research team encountered many of the same collaborative challenges. the research team had to negotiate and re-negotiate ways of working, integrate differing points of view and assign roles in ways to leverage expertise but not reinforce bias. one Health approaches need to be evaluated to help practitioners decide when and how to most effectively collaborate for their intended purposes. a majority of the articles focused broadly on the need for collaboration between multiple sectors or disciplines with little attention to what factors enable an effective One Health response effort.
