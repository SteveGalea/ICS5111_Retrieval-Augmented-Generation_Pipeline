{"summary": "SARS-CoV is characterized by its virulence, its ability to cross the species barrier, and a fatality rate of 10% during the pandemic of 2002 to 2003 (2). recent identification of nine human cases of severe viral pneumonia (with one death) attributed to a SARS-like CoV (4) reveal that coronaviruses remain a significant threat to human health. initiation of negative-strand synthesis in coronaviruses requires interaction between a cis-acting RNA pseudoknot in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032 UTR) (7) and a complex of multiple replicase proteins (8). additional structural work has identified RNA hairpins in the 5\u2032 UTR of MHV as essential for replication (9\u201311) revertants were identified only in two regions in the entire 31,335-nucleotide genome. this genetic evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that MHV N and MHV nsp3a interact physically. it was also shown that BCoV N poorly stimulates the initiation of infection by transfected MHV genomic RNA. a key determinant of the binding free energy is localized to the SR-rich linker region just C-terminal of the folded NTD. a key determinant of the binding free energy is localized to the SR-rich linker region just C-terminal of the folded NTD. the coding sequence for MHV nsp3a residues 1 to 114 was amplified from the pGEX6P-nsp3 plasmid (17) the plasmid was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into the pET3a expression plasmid to create pNsp3a. the overall insert was digested with NdeI and BamHI. the integrity of all DNA constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. the integrity of all DNA

at low speed. pellets were frozen at 80\u00b0C overnight, thawed, resuspended in 200 ml lysis buffer (25 mM KPi, 2 mM EDTA, 500 mM KCl, 0.1 g protease inhibitor cocktail [Sigma] [pH 6.0]), and lysed by sonication a single colony from the transformation plate was used to inoculate a 200-ml LB culture containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 34 mg/liter chloramphenicol. the starter culture was used to inoculate six 1-liter LB cultures such that the 1-liter cultures would have an initial OD600 of 0.1. natant was resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (25 mM KPi, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM DTT [pH 6.0])

the sample was then further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a superdex 75 16/60 column. centrifugation and 0.15% (vol/vol) PEI were added dropwise to the supernatant. the pellet was then subjected to (NH4)2SO4 precipitation. the final 80% pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A. ml TEV protease was added to cleave the peptide of interest. the sample was loaded back onto the HisTrap HP column. the peptide-containing fractions were then pooled and lyophilized. the lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and 0.15% (vol/vol) PEI was added dropwise to the supernatant. the supernatant was then subjected to (NH4)2SO4 precipitation. the 80% pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (25 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT [pH 8.0] MHV nsp3a and SR-linker peptide were prepared by growing transformed cultures on a minimal medium containing 1 M9 salts (6 g/liter Na2HPO4, 3 g/liter KH2PO4, 0.5 g/liter NaCl [pH 7.4]), 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.25 mg/liter thiamine hydrochloride, 100 mg/liter ampicillin, 2.5 g/ a titrant containing a 10-fold molar excess of MHV nsp3a was titrated into 10 to 20 M N protein at 25.0\u00b0C. a single 2-l injection followed by 69 4-l injections was used for each experiment. 200 M MHV nsp3a was titrated into a complex of 20 M N and 25 M TRS RNA at 25.0\u00b0C. the corrected data were fit to a binding model invoking a single class of n binding sites, i.e., a single-site binding model, as described previously using Origin (21). a 170 M 15N-labeled MHV nsp3a sample was titrated with increasing amounts of unlabeled SR-linker peptide in 50 mM KPi, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM TCEP (pH 6.0), and 10% D2O. the change in the MHV nsp3a chemical shift at all resonances was monitored as a function of increasing concentration of

from the full-length MHV N gene using standard PCR methods. plasmids were digested by NdeI and BamHI and ligated into pET3a expression plasmid to create pNsp3a. tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleaves immediately N-terminal to the Cys [TEV(cys)] in the expressed protein construct and gives recombinant SR-linker peptide following purification. both traditional and overlap extension PCR methodologies were used. pMHV1-219, pMHV60-219, and pBCoV_NTD were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. a single colony from the transformation plate was used to inoculate a 200-ml LB culture containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin. large cultures were grown at 37\u00b0C for an additional 4 h prior to harvesting by centrifugation at low speed. the pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (25 mM KPi, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM KCl [pH 6.0]) the sample was then subjected to purification using an SP-Sepharose cation-exchange column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer B. the sample was then further purified by size exclusion chromatography. large cultures were grown at 37\u00b0C with shaking until the OD600 reached 0.6 to 0.8. cell pellets were frozen at 80\u00b0C overnight, thawed, resuspended in 200 ml

Fractions containing the CTD\u2013glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein were pooled. pellet was resuspended in 20 ml buffer C (25 mM KPi, 2 mM DTT [pH 6.0]) the sample was then dialyzed against TEV cleavage buffer (25 mM KPi, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM DTT [pH a single colony from the transformation plate was used to inoculate 200-ml LB cultures containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin. large cultures were grown at 37\u00b0C with shaking until the OD600 reached 0.6 to 0.8. cell pellets were frozen at 80\u00b0C overnight, thawed, resuspended in 200 ml lysis buffer. the sample was eluted with a linear imidazole gradient (10 mM to 500 mM imidazole) over 20 column volumes. the pellet was then resuspended in 20 ml buffer C (25 mM Tris, 1 mM TCEP, 10 mM imidazole, 100 mM NaCl [pH 8.0]) a single colony from the transformation plate was used to inoculate a 200-ml LB culture containing 100 mg/liter ampicillin and 34 mg/liter chloramphenicol. the starter culture was used to inoculate six 1-liter LB cultures such that the 1-liter cultures would have an initial OD600 of 0.1. the sample was extensively dialyzed against buffer B (25 mM Tris, 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT [pH 8.0]) the dialyzed sample was loaded onto the column and was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (100 mM to 400 mM NaCl) over 24 column volumes. unlabeled transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS) RNA (10-mer; 5\u2032-gAAUCUAAACU [where the lowercase letter stands for a nonnative nucleotide] was prepared via in vitro runoff transcription using SP6 polymerase from synthetic double-stranded DNA templates. all transcription reaction mixtures contained 5 mM template, 0.05 g/ml of polyethylene glycol (PEG), 8,000, and 1 transcription buffer. MHV nsp3a was titrated into 10 to 20 M N protein at 25.0\u00b0C. a single 2-l injection followed by 69 4-l injections was used for each experiment. each data point was corrected for the heat of dilution by a point-by-point subtraction. all spectra were acquired at 25\u00b0C on 200 M MHV nsp3a or 1.8 mM SR-linker peptide. proton resonances were referenced indirectly on the basis of the proton reference frequency by the equations C0 = 0.251449530H0 and N0 = 0.101329118H0. n saturation and sat represent the signal-to-noise level in each experiment. a 170 M 15N-labeled MHV nsp3a sample was titrated with increasing amounts of unlabeled SR-linker peptide. the data were fit to a single-site binding model using global binding analysis with Dynafit. structure calculations were performed using established protocols in Xplor-NIH (30) initial structures were calculated by a distance geometry and simulated annealing protocol with Xplor-NIH. the impact of individual RDC restraints was validated by randomly removing 20% of the restraints. error in TS was calculated from the square root of the sum of the squares of the SD of the average values of Ka and H obtained from three independent titrations. d Ka values were averaged from multiple ITC titrations and were fit to a model invoking a single-site binding model. MHV nsp3a backbone and side chain assignments have been deposited in the BioMagResBank under accession ID 18587. the structure bundle and mean average solution structure of MHV nap3a have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession codes 2M0A and 2M0I. the solution structure was calculated using 943 NOE restraints, 45 1DNH residual dipolar coupling restraints, and 32 hydrogen bond restraints. the experimentally derived residual dipolar coupling restraints are in good agreement with those back-calculated from the average structure. the values of the axial component (Da) and rhombicity (Dr) for MHV nsp3a in 8% stretched polyacrylamide gels were found to be 3.3 Hz and 0.33 respectively. the ensemble structures between residues 19 and 114 were analyzed by using PROCHECK-NMR. the largest difference between the MHV and SARS-CoV nsp3a structures lies in the 3 helical region. in MHV, this region forms a single, continuous helix, whereas in SARS-CoV nsp3a, this region forms two short, disjointed helices. MHV N219 (residues 60 to 219) binds MHV nsp3a with 1:1 stoichiometry. binding is strongly enthalpically driven (Hcal, 13.0 0.6 kcal mol1, where Hcal is the calorimetric H value) and is opposed by entropy. the curve in the lower graph indicates the best fit defined by a single-site binding model. the low observed heat of binding and the lack of saturation under these conditions preclude quantitative analysis beyond an estimate of H. we used a domain addition/deletion strategy for MHV N in order to identify major determinants of this interaction. representative titrations of MHV nsp3a (200 M) into MHV N1-219 (20 M) in 0.15 M K+\u20135 mM TCEP (pH 6.0) shown is a graphic comparison of the enthalpic (H) and entropic (TS) components of the free energy (G) for the binding of MHV nsp3a to MHV N60-219 (filled bars), MHV S207D N coroner N is an RNA-binding protein that makes a high-affinity complex with the transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS) RNA. this titration also evolved no significant net heat (Fig. 5B) this suggests that MHV N219\u2013nsp3a complex formation is inhibited by bound RNA. titration of MHV nsp3a into a solution containing a 33-residue peptide showed no observable heat change by ITC. titration of the same SR-linker peptide into 15N-labeled MHV nsp3a was monitored by 1H,15N NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 7A) this acidic region is electrostatically complementary to the basic MHV SR-linker peptide. this region is the same to which three of the four BCoV revertant mutations map (E5, T18, A38), with D113 in the junction region between the folded nsp3a domain and the immediately adjacent strongly acidic region. perturbations (ppm) are painted on the average structure of MHV nsp3a in colors ranging from yellow to red. proline residues are shown as white, while residues with no information are shown as gray. the log of peak intensity is painted on the model in colors ranging from blue to green. nsp3a binds to the N-terminal region of the SR-linker peptide. nsp3a binds to the N-terminal region of the SR-linker peptide. nsp3a binds to the N-terminal region of the SR-linker peptide. nsp3a binds to the N-terminal region of the SR-linker peptide. single phosphomimetic substitutions in MHV N60-219 do not strongly disrupt binding to nsp3a. a number of phosphorylation sites in the NTDs and CTDs of MHV, infectious bronchitis virus, and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus have now been mapped using mass spectrometry (47\u201351) ITC-derived binding experiments reveal that both the S207D and S218D forms of N219 bind to MHV nsp3a with high affinity. binding is detectably weaker (3-fold) than that of wild-type N219. no. of NOE distance constraints 943 Intraresidue 227 Sequential (|i j| = 1) 384 Medium range (|i j| 5) 181 Long range (|i j| > 5) 151 Hydrogen bonds 32 Distance violations (>0.35 ) 0 No. of dihedral angle constraints 172 Residual no. of dihedral angle violations of >5\u00b0 0 Total no. of RDCsa 45 Q factor 0.23 RM inspection of the structure reveals a fold composed of three -helices and four -strands arranged in the order 1\u20131\u20132\u20132\u20133\u20133\u20134 onto which is appended an N-terminal unstructured domain (residues 1 to 18) the structure shows some similarity to a domain of the streptococcal pyogenic exotoxin precursor (PDB code 1FNU) and an E3 ubiquitin ligase a representative binding isotherm is shown in Fig. 4a. MHV N219 (residues 60 to 219) binds MHV nsp3a with 1:1 stoichiometry (n, 1.2 0.2 in multiple experiments) association constant [Ka], [1.4 0.3] 106 M1) is strongly enthalpically driven (Hcal, 13.0 0.6 kcal mol1, where Hcal is the calorimetric H value) the binding is strongly enthalpically driven (Hcal, 13.0 0.6 kcal mol1, where Hcal is the calorimetric H value) and is opposed by entropy (Table 2). MHV N197 (residues 60 to 197) exhibited no measurable net heat of binding to MHV nsp3a. an identical titration carried out at 30.0\u00b0C also showed no observable heat. shown is a graphic comparison of the enthalpic (H) and entropic (TS) components of the free energy (G) for the binding of MHV nsp3a to MHV N60-219 (filled bars), MHV S207D N60-219 (stippled bars), MHV S218D N60-219 (diagonally striped bars), and MHV N1-219 (open bars). binding of MHV nsp3a and TRS RNA to MHV nsp3a may be mutually exclusive. the fact that TRS RNA seems to outcompete MHV nsp3a is consistent with their relative affinities. these results are qualitatively consistent with prior findings. titration of the same SR-linker peptide into 15N-labeled MHV nsp3a was monitored by 1H,15N NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 7A) the affinity of MHV nsp3a for the MHV SR-linker peptide was determined to be (8.1 0.3) 103 M1, consistent with the fast chemical exchange observed between the free and bound components. 1H,15N HSQC spectrum of MHV nsp3a (acquired at 600 MHz) highlighting selected chemical shift perturbations upon the addition of increasing amounts of the SR-linker peptide. perturbations of only three residues are shown for clarity. the resulting 1H,15N HSQC spectrum shows significant line broadening of resonances on both \u201cfaces\u201d of MHV nsp3a. the only exception is that resonances in the N-terminal unstructured region exhibit no line broadening. this hypothesis could not be tested directly, due to the poor solubility of both nsp3a and N197. MHV SR-linker peptide titrated unlabeled nsp3a into a solution of a 15N- and 13C-labeled SR-linker peptide. amide cross peaks in the 1H dimension of the 1H,15N HSQC spectrum of this 33-residue peptide reveals a lack of defined secondary structure in the unbound state. the same is true of the complex formed upon the addition MHV N is most likely to be phosphorylated on the basis of predictions made by NetPhos 2.0. phosphorylation of N may regulate the switch between viral replication and transcription or viral recognition and genomic RNA packaging (47\u201349, 53, 54) MHV N and nsp3a (the N-terminal domain of MHV nsp3) do indeed interact physically. we have mapped the binding determinants and interfacial regions on each protein partner. the MHV N\u2013nsp3a interaction is likely characterized by electrostatic complementarity. reversible phosphorylation of one or more serine residues in the SR-rich region may be necessary to regulate MHV nsp3a binding. however, multiple phosphorylation events within this region of MHV N may be necessary to regulate MHV nsp3a binding. an early RNA recombination experiment suggested that the N-terminal domains of BCoV and MHV were not functionally interchangeable (61) a direct interaction of this domain with another MHV protein or membrane lipid associated with the RTC would relieve the intermolecular inhibition of MHV N\u2013nsp3a complex formation. previous studies reveal that this domain is conformationally unstructured in the free N protein and plays no role in N NTD-RNA interactions. a genomic RNA\u2013N complex must be brought to the replicase to initiate both RNA replication and sgRNA transcription from the 3\u2032 end of the genome (17). it is not known how reversible phosphorylation might regulate this activity. studies to test these ideas are in progress, as are efforts to positively identify sites of phosphorylation in the MHV N SR-rich region."}
