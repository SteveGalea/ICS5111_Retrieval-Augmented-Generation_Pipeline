{"summary": "a website called HealthMap mines news websites, government alerts, eyewitness accounts, and other data sources for outbreaks of various illnesses reported around the world. the site aggregates those cases on a global map, with outbreaks displayed in real time. traditional flu surveillance by the centers for disease control and prevention relies on outpatient reporting and virological test results supplied by laboratories nationwide. the timing of the spike suggests the queries were as much in response to public curiosity as anything else. otherwise, it would be vulnerable to \u201cnoisy\u201d queries. that\u2019s unlike Twitter, a fast-growing \u201cmicroblogging\u201d platform. twitter content predicted flu outbreaks 1\u20132 weeks ahead of the CDC's surveillance average. but flu-related tweet streams don\u2019t always match up with laboratory-confirmed influenza. researchers say open access is in part what makes Twitter so promising as health research tool. cell-phone data from 1.9 million cell phones in the island nation could change that. results from the study showed an estimated 630,000 people left within 19 days. the major recipients of that outflow were three coastal towns. an adjunct professor at the Harvard School of Public Health proposes that changes in cell-phone use patterns also may reveal where outbreaks emerge in remote locations. changes in call patterns did, in fact, occur, but they coincide with disruptive floods that predated outbreaks of cholera by about 2 weeks. research was presented at the American Public Health Association\u2019s 2011 Annual Meeting. Ideally scientists want as much individualized information as they can get to anchor social network predictive models in real-world data. the power of these models was illustrated in a 2010 study by two professors and long-time collaborators. a professor at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University says social position matters in communication networks. social position also matters in communication networks, Eubank says. people with perceived credibility and access to major followings can have large influence on public opinion. MIDAS has two missions, says its director, Jim Anderson. the MIDAS is funded by the national Institute of general medical sciences. a typical goal, Eubank adds, is to find nonpharmaceutical methods for impeding an epidemic\u2014for example, by closing high-risk schools. harnessing the best platforms can take the protection of public health to a new level."}
