{"summary": "mAbs were previously generated by vaccinating mice with recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV-EBOV-GP) hybridoma cells were generated by fusing mouse plasma cells with SP2/0-Ag14 myeloma cells. monoclonal hybridoma cells were isolated by performing 2 rounds of limiting dilutions in 96-well flat-bottomed tissue culture plates. ELISA identified 4 immunoglobulin G1 mAbs (S3, S12, S17, and S33) that bound the GPs of all 5 Ebolavirus species. the focus was shifted to cross-reactive mAbs that can bind to all known Ebolavirus species. this suggests that 1 conserved epitope on the GP was targeted by these mAbs. Detection of the EBOV GP suggests that the mAbs recognized 1 linear epitopes on the GP1 but that these epitopes are only partially conserved. a 5-minute incubation step with or without 8 M urea was added after aspiration of the mAbs. the avidity for all mAbs was highest for the EBOV GP used during primary vaccination. the percentage of binding competition was calculated as [1 (OD competition)/(OD maximum binding of biotinylated mAbs)] 100, as previously described for mAbs against SARS-CoV [12] mAbs S12, S17, and S33 did not compete with S3; therefore, S3 recognized a unique epitope on the GP. the antibodies described in this study did not display neutralizing activity. nonneutralizing antibodies have been shown to protect in vivo. future studies will include testing the in vivo efficacy of these mAbs."}
