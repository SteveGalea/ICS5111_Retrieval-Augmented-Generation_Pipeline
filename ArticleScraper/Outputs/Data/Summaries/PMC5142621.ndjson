{"summary": "positive-strand RNA viruses of eukaryotes modify intracellular membranes into unique structures that presumably facilitate viral RNA synthesis. these replication organelles may consist of different substructures, such as spherules, tubules, convoluted membranes, or double-membrane vesicles. despite this diversity, two recurrent classes of replication organelles have been recognized. Equine arteritis virus (EAV) is the prototype of the arterivirus family. it induces the formation of an extensive reticulovesicular network (RVN) of DMVs. EAV infection results in the formation of proteinaceous tubules containing the nucleocapsid protein. viral nonstructural proteins directly involved in RNA synthesis colocalize with the membrane structures induced during EAV infection. the dsRNA was located in the core of the DMVs, whereas the nonstructural proteins were located mainly on the membranes of the vesicles as well as on surrounding membranes. the exact benefits of positive-strand RNA viral replication organelle formation remain unclear. replication organelles could be a suitable microenvironment for viral RNA synthesis. the third proposed role is hiding viral RNA species from detection by innate immune sensors. these sensors recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) we evaluated the role of individual ISGs, including cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) and viperin, which are known to inhibit HCV membranous web formation (30, 31) however, the candidates tested appear not to be involved in restricting EAV nsp-induced membrane remodeling. we hypothesized that such a response could be linked to the type I IFN signaling pathway. a clear dose-dependent reduction of the GFP signal was observed during a single cycle of infection. cells were infected with a recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing reporter virus (EAV-GFP; multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 10) and treated with IFN- from 1 h postinfection. hpi, and GFP fluorescence were measured and normalized to a control infection. error bars represent the standard deviation from 3 independent experiments. it is not possible to study the effect of IFN- treatment on DMS formation directly in infected cells. electron tomography showed that their double-membrane architecture was identical. at 24 h post-tetracycline induction, many DMVs were found. presence of the C-terminal GFP tag on nsp3 did not influence the morphology of DMVs. a 2-nm-thick virtual slice of a reconstructed tomogram is shown. a virtual slice of a reconstructed tomogram is shown. the scale bar represents 100 nm. we first checked the effect of IFN- treatment on nsp2-3 expression levels and polyprotein cleavage in HuH-7/tetR/HA-nsp2-3GFP cells. the cells were chemically fixed, scraped from the dish, pelleted, and embedded in an epoxy resin. if there would be a difference in the extent of DMS formation, this would be reflected in the number of cell profiles that contain DMSs. levels of the indicated proteins in HuH-7/tetR/HA-nsp2-3GFP cells were analyzed 24 h after the indicated treatments, using Western blotting. the expected position of the HA-nsp2-3GFP precursor is indicated. the average reduction over 4 experiments was 27% 7% (P = 0.001) the next step was to quantify nsp2-3-induced DMS in HuH-7/tetR/HA-nsp2-3GFP cells, treated with tetracycline alone or in combination with IFN-. in four independent experiments sections containing 300 to 500 cell profiles with a nucleus were analyzed for each condition. double-membrane sheets were found in cell profiles that also contained DMVs. they were often juxtaposed to intact DMVs. this strong increase in double-membrane sheets suggested a major effect in DMS biogenesis. the effects of IFN- treatment on DMS morphology and abundance are caused by the products of one or more ISGs. a high-throughput screen of the hundreds of ISG candidates was not feasible. two membrane-associated ISGs, viperin and CH25H, were previously shown to influence HCV replication membranes. mRNAs of viperin and PLSCR1 were strongly upregulated, whereas CH25H mRNA could not be detected, either with or without IFN- treatment. we decided to test its impact on EAV nsp2-3-induced DMS. we found no significant reduction in the number of DMS-containing cells. PCR was validated using cDNA of lipopolysaccharide-treated dendritic cells. cells were treated with 500 U/ml IFN- or 10 M 25HC or untreated. a section covering 300 to 500 cell profiles with a nucleus was analyzed for each sample. LSCR1 was required for the effects of IFN- treatment we observed. we found no significant differences in the fraction of cells showing double-membrane sheets compared to the parental HuH-7/tetR/HA-nsp2-3GFP cell line. together, these data suggest that viperin and PLSCR1 do not contribute to the disruption of nsp2-3-induced DMV biogenesis. DMVs with characteristic double membranes and cores were abundantly present (Fig. 1C, red arrows) as well as the N protein-containing tubules described previously (13) cells were infected with a recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing reporter virus (EAV-GFP) and treated with IFN- from 1 h postinfection (p.i.) onward. a clear dose-dependent reduction of the GFP signal was observed during a HuH-7 cells were infected with EAV-GFP in 96-well black plates for 1 h. after removal of the inoculum, they were treated with the indicated dose of IFN-. tag on nps3 under the control of a tetracycline-inducible cytomegalovirus promoter (HuH-7/tetR/HA-nsp2-3GFP) promoter. induction of nsp2-3 expression in this cell line resulted in the formation of uniform DMVs. these structures were not observed in noninduced cells. electron tomography showed that their double-membrane architecture was identical. a 2-nm-thick virtual slice of a reconstructed tomogram is shown. a 2-nm-thick virtual slice of a reconstructed tomogram is shown. the scale bar represents 100 nm. nsp2-3GFP expression in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells may be triggered by other viral PAMPs (e.g., viral RNA), which could affect the formation or function of the replication organelles by inducing the expression of particular ISGs. we initially asked the question of whether IFN- treatment affects the number of EAV nsp2-3-induced DMS formed per cell. IFN- treatment reduces the number of double-membrane structures formed by EAV nsp2-3, while protein levels and nsp2-3 cleavage efficiency are not affected. the expected position of the HA-nsp2-3GFP precursor is indicated. multiple mosaic maps were analyzed for each sample. Ratios are calculated as the number of cell profiles divided by the number of cell profiles containing a nucleus. the average reduction over 4 experiments was 27% 7% (P = 0.001) the double-membrane sheets were found in cell profiles that also contained DMVs (Fig. 4A, bottom panel, red arrow) in 1% of the cell profiles, we also observed some double-membrane sheets, a presumed precursor of DMVs during their biogenesis (Fig. 4A, bottom panel, red arrow) insets are 2 magnifications of areas where DMVs (A) or double-membrane sheets (B) are visible (indicated with white arrows) the different appearance of these samples relative to the data shown in Fig. 2 is the result of different sample preparation approaches. we first examined the expression of viperin, CH25H, and a third membrane-associated ISG, phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) in parental HuH-7 cells upon IFN- treatment. the mRNAs of both viperin and PLSCR1 were strongly upregulated, whereas CH25H mRNA could not be detected, either with or without IFN- treatment. however, we found no significant reduction in the number of DMS-containing cells, nor did indicated genes were amplified with gene-specific primers. the RT-qPCR was validated using cDNA of lipopolysaccharide-treated human dendritic cells. we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to knock out either PLSCR1 or viperin expression in the HuH-7/tetR/HA-nsp2-3GFP cell line. if either viperin or PLSCR1 was required for the effects of IFN- treatment, IFN- treatment should no longer lead to the proliferation of double-membrane sheets in these respective knockout cells. treatment of cells with IFN- (mimicking the triggering of innate immunity after recognition of PAMPs such as viral nucleic acids) inhibits the formation of arterivirus-induced DMVs. this suggests that the membrane-curving and/or fission events that could lead to DMV formation were inhibited by IFN- treatment. rapping pathway was only partially blocked or that the remaining DMVs were formed via an alternative mechanism. membrane curvatures are indicated with red dashes between the membranes. the step proposed to be inhibited by IFN- treatment is indicated. a previous high-throughput ISG screen included EAV-GFP (39) most hits in that screen were well-characterized ISGs, such as the OAS proteins, which are known to affect other stages of the viral replication cycle. some candidates could be tested to confirm this. LC3 colocalizes with nidovirus replication organelles (43, 44) it would be interesting to investigate whether this could be related to antiviral IFN- or IFN- effects. the impact of the disruption of DMS formation following IFN- treatment still requires validation in infected cells. a previously unknown effect of IFN- treatment on viral replication organelles. this implies that the innate immune system possesses multiple ways to counteract the formation of replication organelles. this implies that the innate immune system possesses multiple ways to counteract the formation of replication organelles. 293T cells (Virgin lab, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis) and wild-type C57BL/6 MEFs (Chen lab, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) were cultured in DMEM with 10% (vol/vol) FCS. all cell culture media contained 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin. pDONR201 was assembled with an HA tag at the N terminus of nsp2 and enhanced GFP (eGFP) fused to the C terminus of nsp3. the pDONR construct was then transferred to either pcDNA3.1-DEST or pLenti6.3/TO/V5-DEST (Life Technologies, Inc.) resulting cell line, HuH-7/tetR/HA-nsp2-3GFP, was transduced again with pLenti6.3 constructs containing the nsp2-3GFP (pLenti6.3/HA-nsp2-3GFP) coding sequence. cells were selected with 12.5 g/ml blasticidin S (PAA Laboratories) cells were grown on coverslips and fixed after 24 h of tetracycline and/or IFN- treatment. cells were then washed with PBS and stored in PBS with 1% (wt/vol) BSA until analysis. quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed using iQ SYBR green SuperMix (Bio-Rad) and a CFX384 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) gene-specific primers were used to amplify interferon-stimulated genes as well as genes coding for -actin and GAPDH as reference genes. mosaic maps were generated as previously described (35) at 6,800 magnification and binning 2, which correspond to a pixel size of 3.2 nm. cell profiles that were positive for arterivirus-associated DMSs, cell profiles positive for double-membrane sheets, and cell profiles that contained a nucleus were annotated and counted.
