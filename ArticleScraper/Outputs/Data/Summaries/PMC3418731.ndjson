{"summary": "mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis is the causative agent of Johne's disease. it is responsible for the highest average production losses among five production-limiting diseases (11, 56) there is additional growing concern that M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis may be a causative or contributing factor to Crohn's disease in humans. macrophages pretreated with IFN- effectively clear mycobacteria. macrophages pretreated with IFN- effectively clear mycobacteria. gamma interferon plays a central role in immune defense against intracellular pathogens. mice deficient in IFN- show increased susceptibility to intracellular pathogens. humans with mutations of the IFN- receptor are susceptible to infection with low-virulence mycobacterial strains. mania donovani decreases expression of IFNGR1, adenovirus decreases expression of IFNGR2 and Mycobacterium avium decreases expression of both IFNGR1 and -R2 (31) human cytomegalovirus targets JAK kinases for degradation (40), mumps virus reduces levels of STAT1 (27), varicella-zoster virus reduces levels of Jak2 and STAT1 (1). inability of IFN- to induce phosphorylation of peptides corresponding to early JAK-STAT intermediates in infected monocytes indicates that M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis blocks responsiveness at, or near, the IFN- receptor. this contributes to the ability of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected cells to be activated by IFN-. monocytes were purified from isolated PBMC by magnetic cell sorting (MACS) purification. monocytes were plated at 5 106 cells/well in six-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium. M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis pellet was resuspended in appropriate volume of cell culture medium to achieve a 5:1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) bacterial loads were added to each well containing 5 million monocytes/well. each sample was quantified and checked for purity using a 2100 Bioanalyzer. RNA (200 ng) was converted to cDNA by adding 8 l of 2 RT buffer and 2 l of RT enzyme (Invitrogen) to a total volume of 10 l. a master mix of buffer and enzyme was made to eliminate pipetting errors. purified monocytes (uninfected and M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infected) were prepared. supernatant was collected from each well, diluted (1:2). cells were prepped for cytospins by centrifugation at 325 g for 5 min. the kinome experiments for all the animals were performed simultaneously in a single run. a 70-l aliquot of this supernatant was mixed with 10 l of activation mix. Arrays were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)\u20131% Triton. a final wash was done with distilled deionized H2O. Arrays were read using a genePix Professional 4200A microarray scanner. images were collected using a 580-nm filter to detect dye fluorescence. paired t tests were performed for each animal-independent peptide. responses from all three animals were pooled to increase statistical confidence. PCA was applied to the M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis data before and after subtraction of biological controls. pathways are assigned a probability value (P) based on the number of proteins present for a particular pathway. monocytes were purified from isolated PBMC by magnetic cell sorting (MACS) purification. monocytes were plated at 5 106 cells/well in six-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) the culture was centrifuged at 3,400 g for 30 min. supernatant was decanted, and the pellet was dried for 30 min. tube weight was then recorded, and pellet weight was determined. RNA (200 ng) was converted to cDNA by adding 8 l of 2 RT buffer and 2 l of RT enzyme (Invitrogen) to a total volume of 10 l. RNA template was removed by the addition of 1 l of Escherichia coli RNase H for 20 min. monocyte TNF- release in response to IFN- stimulation was added at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml. supernatant was collected from each well, diluted (1:2), and used for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for bovine tumor necrosis factor alpha. cells were incubated on ice for 10 min and spun in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)\u20131% Triton submerged in phospho-specific fluorescent ProQ Diamond Phosphoprotein Stain. Arrays were washed three times in destaining solution containing 20% acetonitrile. a final wash was done with distilled deionized H2O. Arrays were air dried for 20 min and then centrifuged at 300 g for 2 min. three tests were performed for each animal-independent peptide. responses from all three animals were pooled to increase statistical confidence. for each animal-independent peptide, responses from all three animals were pooled. PCA was applied to the M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis data before and after subtraction of biological controls. the first two principal components, PC1 and PC2, account for the largest variability within the sample data. pathway analysis of differentially phosphorylated peptides. a homologous cell population ensures that any detected kinase activity was a result of changes in the cells of interest, which cannot be known in a mixed cell population. experiments for all animals were preformed simultaneously in a single run in order to minimize the possibility of technical variances in the kinome. 37, 52, and 43 peptides had significantly different reactions in the treatment of monocytes treated with IFN-, monocytes treated with IFN-, and monocytes infected with M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. this indicates that there is more variation in how animals respond to IFN- stimulation than to an infection with M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. the kinome data sets were subjected to cluster analysis for comparison and visualization of patterns of response of the different animals to the different treatments/infections. the data were analyzed to consider both the absolute kinome profile of each animal under each treatment condition (without subtraction of biological controls) and the dynamic response of each animal to each treatment (with subtraction of biological controls) animal dependence was verified by using hierarchical clustering. this animal dependence may reflect cumulative differences of selected peptides. a higher significance level would mean that more peptides would be determined to have different expression levels across animals. sp. paratuberculosis blocks the ability of the cells to undergo the same changes in signal transduction observed in the uninfected cells. kinome data were subjected to pathway overrepresentation analysis to determine which cellular pathways/processes are activated under different treatment conditions. input data were limited to peptides with a consistent pattern of differential phosphorylation across the three biological replicates in at least one of the treatment sets. the confidence in activation of JAK-STAT is extremely low (P 0.831) for the same treatment of the M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected monocytes, the confidence in activation of JAK-STAT is extremely low. only four of the peptides representing JAK-STAT signaling proteins show increased phosphorylation. information processing 6 6 0.025 0 1 0 1 0 1 TGF- signalingc TGF- (canonical) 8 7 0.139 1 0.990 3 0.236 1 0.952 TGF- signaling pathway 5 5 0.045 0 1 2 0.425 1 0.895 TGF- receptor 15 11 0.273 4 0.957 5 0.061 0 1 NF-kB signaling pathway. a representation of the JAK-STAT pathway highlights activation of JAK-STAT by IFN- in uninfected monocytes. a representation of the JAK-STAT pathway highlights activation of JAK-STAT by IFN- in uninfected monocytes. uninfected monocytes M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected monocytes Fold change P value Fold change P value IFNAR1 1.14 0.04 1.17 0.23 IFNGR1 1.09 0.26 1.07 0.27 IL-10RA 1.11 0.19 1.14 0.15 IL-16 1.20 0.10 1.17 0.16 IL-2RB 1.10 0.24 1.09 1.08 0.31 IL-6ST 1.14 1.04 0.33 IL-7R signaling within the JAK-STAT pathway in bovine monocytes is color coded. red indicates increased phosphorylation, green indicates decreased phosphorylation, and white indicates no change. a decrease in expression of IFN- receptor chains has been reported for pathogens. cobacterium avium decreases expression of SOCS3 and IFNGR in response to M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection. RNA was extracted from bovine monocytes after either 1- or 18-h infection with M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MOI of 5:1) release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) is a well-established marker of macrophage activation by IFN- (12) for the uninfected monocytes, treatment with 10 ng/ml of bovine IFN- resulted in release of large quantities of TNF-. however, under identical stimulation conditions, there is minimal release of TNF- from the cells. the in vitro infection of purified monocytes with M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis was 93% 4%. experiments for all animals were preformed simultaneously in a single run. peptides with P values less than 0.01 were considered animal dependent in all three treatments relative to the control. 37, 52, and 43 peptides had significantly different reactions in the treatments of monocytes treated with IFN-, monocytes treated with IFN-, and monocytes infected with M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. the kinome data sets were subjected to cluster analysis for comparison and visualization of patterns of response of the different animals to the different treatments/infections. the data were analyzed in this way to consider both the absolute kinome profile of each animal under each treatment condition (without subtraction of biological controls) and the dynamic response of each animal to each treatment (with subtraction of biological controls) 200 of the 300 peptides were found to be animal independent at 0.01 level of significance. this animal dependence may reflect cumulative differences of the selected peptides, which together contributed to the notable variations among animals. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected monocytes rather than the IFN-stimulated monocytes. this suggests that M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis blocks the ability of the cells to undergo the same changes in signal transduction observed in the uninfected cells and is consistent with the IFN- unresponsiveness. the confidence in activation of the JAK-STAT pathway is extremely low (P 0.831) for the same treatment of the uninfected monocytes, the confidence in activation of the JAK-STAT pathway is extremely low. only four of the peptides representing JAK-STAT signaling proteins show increased phosphorylation. 0.910 5 0.251 IL-22 soluble receptor signaling 5 5 0.047 0 1 1 0.915 3 0.340 Androgen receptor 11 10 0.081 1 0.999 4 0.247 2 0.919 IFN- enhancer information processing 6 6 0.025 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 TGF- signalingc TGF- (canonical) 8 7 0.139 1 0.990 3 0.236 1 0.952 TGF- signaling pathway 5 5 0.0 many of these pathways, in particular those associated with cytokine/chemokine signaling, share signaling intermediates with IFN-induced responses. that activation of these secondary pathways is not observed in M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected monocytes following IFN- stimulation would suggest that the pathogen blocks cellular responsiveness at, or near, the receptor. FN- in uninfected monocytes while M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection blocks IFN- responsiveness throughout the pathway beginning at the receptor. the substrate protein with a peptide representing a phosphorylation site on the array. b Fold change is the relative change calculated by comparing the background-corrected and normalized signal values of these samples to the medium control. P values indicate how significant a difference there is between IFN--treated cells and control cells. mycobacterium avium, a closely related pathogen to M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis, decreases expression of both chains of the IFN- receptor. RNA was extracted from bovine monocytes after either 1- or 18-h infection with M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection inhibits any TNF- release induced by IFN-. the well-documented response of TNF- release following IFN- stimulation is observed in uninfected cells. mycobacterium tuberculosis is estimated to infect one-third of the world's population. there is growing concern over food safety, with indications that M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis may represent a zoonotic threat. a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of these microbes is a first step in the development of rational therapeutic strategies. pathway analysis of kinome data indicated activation of the JAK-STAT pathway in uninfected monocytes. inability of IFN- to induce differential phosphorylation of peptides corresponding to early JAK-STAT intermediates in infected monocytes indicates that M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis rapidly, within 3 h, blocks responsiveness at or near the IFN- receptor. independent assay used to confirm a loss of response to IFN- in infected monocytes was a measure of TNF- release. results indicated a significant release of TNF- following IFN- treatment of monocytes but no release of TNF- in similarly treated M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected cells. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation and M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection in bovine monocytes found an increase in interleukin-10 (IL-10) and TNF- mRNA expression following p38. when p38 was inhibited, a decrease in IL-10 expression was observed while there was no change in TNF- expression. this investigation offers specific insight into pathogenic mechanisms of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. this also offers further insight into various and often redundant mechanisms used by viral and bacterial pathogens to block IFN- responsiveness to achieve chronic infections."}
