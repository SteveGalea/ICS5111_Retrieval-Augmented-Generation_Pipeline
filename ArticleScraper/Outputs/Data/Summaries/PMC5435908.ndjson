{"summary": "single stranded RNA viruses, such as negative-sense Ebola, marburg, Lassa, and influenza and positive-sense human immunodeficiency viruses, are very important human pathogens in the world. the respiratory viruses are highly contagious and cause annually worldwide epidemics and occasional pandemic outbreaks. the viral genome limits the clinical impact of all types of medicinal products for the prevention and treatment of influenza infections. the HRV has almost the highest number of serotypes (more than 100) among all respiratory viruses due to mutations of its genome. binase reduced the titer of pandemic influenza A/Hamburg/4/2009 (H1N1pdm), reovirus serotype 1 (Reo 1-Lang), herpes virus type I (pseudorabies), middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and human corona virus (HCoV-229E) in infected Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epitheli the pandemic influenza A/Hamburg/04/09 (H1N1pdm) and human rhinovirus serotype 1A (HRV1A) were provided by the strain collection of the Institute of Medical Virology, justus Liebig University, Giessen, Germany. the cells were incubated with H1N1pdm and HRV1A at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 diluted in PBS++/BA. tron shaking incubator (INFORS HT, Switzerland) at 37\u00b0C until the beginning of the stationary phase of bacterial growth. the supernatant was acidified by glacial acetic acid to pH 5.0, diluted 1 : 5 in double-distilled water (ddH2O), and applied on the column with DE-32 cellulose. the flow through from DE-32 was transferred to column packed with phosphocellulose P11 (Whatman, UK) equilibrated with 10 m binase was incubated in 0.25 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) in the presence of 0.5 g/l RNA (final concentration) in a water bath for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. reaction stopped by addition of 6.8% perchloric acid followed by incubation on ice bath for 10 min followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 12000g. growth medium of subconfluence HeLa cells in a 96-well plate (in triplicate) was replaced with DMEM containing different concentration of binase (at final concentrations of 0.005\u2013500 g/ml) the cells were left to recover for 60 min in growth medium and then replaced by 200 l of MTT-mix (growth DMEM medium containing 0.123 mg/ml of MTT-reagent = 1-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2- 2.6. Binase Treatment To determine the effect of 100 g/ml binase against H1N1pdm virus, the A549 monolayers were subcultured to prepare 96-well plates. the cells were grown in a 48-well plate (in triplicate) overnight at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. cells were infected with 75 l of virus suspension in PBS++/BA. cells were incubated with 250 l growth medium in each well containing different concentrations of binase for 24 h, at 33\u00b0C and 5% CO2. supernatants containing HRV1A virus assayed for their viral titers using plaque assay. binase nontreated cells were used as 100%. the EC50 was determined using GraphPad Prism 5.0 Software. cellular proteins were labeled with green (Cy3) and red (Cy5) cyanine dyes. labeling reaction terminated by incubating with 10 mM lysine for 10 min. labeled protein was mixed and used for isoelectric focusing.

Statistical analysis Statistical tests and graphical data presentation were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 Software (GraphPad Software, Inc., USA) and MS Excel 2010 (Microsoft, USA). the significance between two groups was determined via \u201cStudent t-test.\u201d A significant difference was considered to be a P value of 0.05. binase is a thermo- and pH-stable agent, which can be used in vivo retaining its activity. the 49% reduction of binase activity in the cell culture fluid can be explained by internalization of the enzyme to the A549 cells. binase at concentrations up to 100 g/ml is not toxic towards A549 cells [13, 17] while inhibiting H1N1pdm virus propagation. a concentration of binase of 100 g/ml with binase reduced the infectious titer in A549 cell culture by 40% after a single replication round. this raises a question regarding antiviral targets of binase in the virus-infected cells. two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis of proteins isolated from nontreated ((i), green labeling by Cy3) and binase-treated cells ((ii), red labeling by Cy5) merged image, unchanged protein spots appeared yellow. high resolution 2D-DIGE images were generated using Typhoon FLA 9500 Imager. binase reduced the viral RNA expression by 4.4 times. a target of binase antiviral action could be viral mRNA. its degradation prevents synthesis of viral proteins. plasmids pHW-PB1-Hamburg, pHW-PB2-Hamburg, pHW-PA-Hamburg, and pHW-NP-Hamburg were used. they carry genes for generating the mRNAs of polymerases and NP segments of H1N1pdm virus. the expressed subunits of the viral polymerases and nucleoprotein replicate and transcribe the influenza virus-like RNA expressed by pPOLI- possible binase actions are represented in the steps: (A) binase internalization into cytoplasm, (B) binase internalization into nucleus, (C) and (D) inhibitory effect of binase on the expression of influenza A virus mini genome system. vRNA is protected by NP proteins and its degradation would result in complete elimination of the virus from the cell culture. binase may be able to cleave viral RNA catalytically and inhibit synthesis of viral proteins. bacterial enzyme uncovers promising aspects of its application as a new antiviral agent. antiviral drugs targeting RNA have provided drug-like small molecules that inhibit viral replication and include inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) and influenza A virus [20]. ncRNA components in viral genomes and transcripts may be promising. RNA viruses suggest binase as a promising antiviral agent against different viruses. authors declare there are no conflicts of interest regarding publication of this article."}
