{"summary": "the use of large doses of corticosteroid in the treatment of SARS caused many osteonecrosis of the femoral head during year 2003. the incidence of male was 39.5% while 19.3% of female. this disease is a hotspot in the research on orthopedic clinical problems. the specimens were randomly divided into three groups: the normal femoral head and neck group (group A); the interior supporting system and bone graft group (group B); and the tantalum rod and bone graft group (group C). each group contained five specimens. the maximum stress was recorded when the femoral head collapsed and when the femoral neck was damaged. step two involved the mechanical testing for the interior supporting system and bone graft group. emoral head and neck specimens were soaked in formalin within 1 year. no pathological change was found through macroscopic observation and X-ray fluoroscopy. pression method was performed for the tantalum rod and bone graft group model. step-by-step loading was applied until the femur was damaged. maximum stress was recorded when the femoral head collapsed and when the femoral neck was damaged. sa, calcar femoral, and under the greater trochanter were recorded until the femoral head collapsed and was destroyed. step two involved the mechanical testing for the interior supporting system and bone graft group (group B). the values recorded in group A were also recorded in group B. the maximum load was applied to the top of the femoral head until the femur was damaged. the maximum load value of B group was obviously higher than that of group A and group C (P 0.05), meanwhile, there\u2019s no difference between group A and group C (Table 2). descending order of strain in group B is as follows: calcar femoral > under the big rotor > the femur rotor nest. difference between group A and group B is statistically significant (P 0.001) adult osteonecrosis of the femoral head causes ischemia of bone cells, necrosis, bone breaks, and femoral head collapse. the disease can manifest at any age, but its highest incidence can be found within the age range 31 years to 60 years old. treatment of femoral head necrosis by shock wave can work instantly and can significantly reduce pain [10-14] hyperbaric oxygen therapy is also considered a type of non-invasive treatment. Surgical treatment is the main method for the treatment of ischemic necrosis of the femoral head. Tantalum rod is a biological material with high porosity (> 80%) and has completely interlinked holes (average pore size is 430 m) this material has high friction stability with bone and has a modulus of elasticity that corresponds to that of bone (3 GPa) femoral head or reset the collapsed femoral head. using a triangular structure of the heart column, we performed a bone graft. this system relies on the external thread of the closed set fixed in the interior supporting system to the bone tunnel. the tunnel influences the bearing load of the femur. the compression strain and bearing load of the femoral head are close to normal after placement of an interior supporting system. the interior supporting system helps prevent ischemic necrosis of the femoral head collapse."}
