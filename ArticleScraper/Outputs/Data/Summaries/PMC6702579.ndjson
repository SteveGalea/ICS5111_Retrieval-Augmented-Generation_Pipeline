{"summary": "the current vaccination for peste des petits ruminants virus is stalled by myriad challenges and continuous endemicity of pneumonia due to fulminant bacterial complication in goats. the goats were randomly grouped and vaccinated within 2 weeks using a combination of PPRV lineage 1 and bacterin from Mannheimia haemolytica. vaccination strategy will provide framework needed in prevention and control of endemic caprine pneumonia in Nigeria. vaccine through the intranasal route induced potent mucosal immunity in goats against peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) goats vaccinated intranasally against PPRV showed better clinical response [5] while against Mh was not protective in the goats when clinically challenged with PPRV [10] there is a need to vaccinate goats with both vaccines through the intranasal route and then challenge in an experimental model, to mimic field or natural conditions. the animals were vaccinated as indicated in each group below. a known confirmed infected WAD goat with apparent clinical signs of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) was introduced into the pen mimicking field infection. thin blood smears were made on clean glass slides, fixed in absolute methanol, and stained with Giemsa. plasma protein concentration was determined using the Goldberg refractometer. twelve west africadwarf goats were acquired from a recognized breeding farm. they weighed between 4.5 and 6 kg each. on arrival, they were acclimatized for 14 days and monitored clinically for changes in temperature, respiratory rate, body condition. all the animals were allowed to comele and clinically observed daily for another 6-week post-infection. the respiratory rate was taken for each goat through the inhalation or expansion of the thoracic cavity for 60 s. the qualities of the respirations were noted. the goats showed slight pyrexia in the 1st week post-vaccination, but which normalized 4 days later. there was moderate pyrexia, serous to purulent ocular discharge and the body condition was good. two goats were very weak at the 13th and 28th days PI. the hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, and red cell counts were within reference range before and after vaccination. the leukocytes and platelets were also within reference range except the slight leukocytosis observed 6 weeks PI. there were marked anemia, moderate leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphocytopenia, neutrophilia, and marked hypoproteinemia few days PI in the goats. the plasma protein, albumin, and immunoglobulin values were within range. the SOD, GSH, and GPx activities decreased slightly. the MPO content, MDA, and H2O2 generation increased moderately. 2.3a 9.02.5a 2.21.5a 1.00.1a 3.22.2a B 6.40.8a 12.61.9a 9.93.0a 14.82.9b 1.80.1a 8.02.5b C 5.40.9a 9.42.2a 13.93.0b 24.53.0c 2.10.1b 9.52.9b SOD=Superoxide dismutase, GPx=Glutathione peroxidase, GSH=Reduced glutathione, MPO= clinical changes observed in goats intranasally vaccinated with peste des petits ruminants virus and Mannheimia haemolytica challenged goats. group B (PPRV + Pm vaccinated): goats did not show signs of weakness until around the 11th day post-infection. 103/L NL* TP* g/dl ALB* g/dl IG* g/dl Pre-vaccination A 32.32.3a 7.01.4a 1.40.3 5.31.2 1.70.2 0.40.0 27.90.9 8.40.1 3.50.1 4.90.1 B 33.02.7a 7.60.9a 1.40.2 5.40.6 2.22.4 0.40.0 29.11.7 7.90.3 3.10.3 4.80.0 C 28.33.2a 6.50.5 a new tab PCV=Packed cell volume, HB=Hemoglobin concentration, RBC=Red blood cell, WBC=White blood cell, PLT=Platelets, NL=Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, TP=Total protein, ALB=Albumin, IG=Immunoglobulin. there were marked anemia, moderate leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphocytopenia, neutrophilia, 1.10.5a 1.00.1a 1.50.3a B 11.53.0a 16.45.5a 3.40.6a 1.81.0b 1.20.1a 1.00.5b C 9.92.5a 15.84.8a 3.91.5a 2.81.0c 1.00.1b 1.50.7b Post-vaccination A 10.02.5a 15.84.2a 8.82.1a 1.10.5a 1.00.1a 1.50.3a B 11.33.1a 18.05.6a 9.12.7a 1.81.0b 1.20.1a 1.0 the highest titer was in the goats vaccinated with PPRV + Mh. the least titer was in unvaccinated goats (0.05) this was similar to reports on pneumococcal vaccination of mice through the intranasal route which boosted the mucosal immunity against Streptococcus pneumoniae. the reason for comingling the goats was justified by the fact that new stock is introduced into a nave flock. intranasal combined vaccines elicited better protection against pneumonia in goats. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
