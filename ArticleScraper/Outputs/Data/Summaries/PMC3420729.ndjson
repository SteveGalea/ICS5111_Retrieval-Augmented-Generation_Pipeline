{"summary": "acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) may be idiopathic in nature or associated with many factors, such as autoimmune rheumatic diseases, occupational exposure, altered immune status. the term undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) is used to identify autoimmune systemic diseases that do not fulfill the criteria to be classified as a definitive connective tissue disease. sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic vasculitis, and polymyositis/dermatomyositis. a high percentage of patients with UCTD maintain an undifferentiated clinical course and do not evolve to a distinct CTD. there are only six cases of AFOP associated with rheumatic disease described. pulmonologist had already searched and excluded tuberculosis and dyspnea. she had positive personal and family history of hashimoto's thyroiditis. autoantibodies: anti-Scl70, anti-Jo1, c-ANCA, anti-RNP, anti-SS-A, anti-SS-B, anti-CCP, and anticentromere. c-ANCA: antinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies; anti-thyroid peroxidase; anti-TGB: antithyroxine binding globulin; anti-Scl 70: antitopoisomerase antibodies anti-Sjogren's syndrome antigen B; anti-CCP: anticitrulline containing peptide; HBV: hepatitis C virus; RV: reference value. autoantibodies were negative (antinuclear antibodies-ANA, rheumatoid factor, anti-Jo-1, anti-RNP, anti-SS-A, anti-SS-B, and c-ANCA), except a 1 : 20 p-ANCA scleroderma standard microangiopathy: dilated capillaries and devascularization areas. after three weeks of diagnosis, the patient developed high fever (39 degrees) and dyspnea at rest, requiring hospitalization. she developed respiratory failure, requiring ventilatory support and intensive care. a female patient of 39 years with diagnosis of undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) and manifestations suggestive of systemic sclerosis (SSc) as Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) and capillaroscopic pattern SD associated with acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) there were no infectious process and no granulomas. the presence of capillaroscopy abnormalities that characterize the scleroderma pattern indicates a high specificity and a positive predictive value for the diagnosis of SSc and related disorders. the manifestations strongly suggested the SSc, but it was not possible to give the diagnosis based on the American College of Rheumatology criteria. the patient in this study received cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone pulse therapy in the intensive critical unit but progressed to respiratory failure by pulmonary hemorrhage. the diagnosis of AFOP is undistinguishable from the others lung injuries diagnosis. the diagnosis of AFOP is essentially histological. beasley et al. noted in their series an association with ankylosing spondylitis and polymyositis. association with rheumatic diseases as systemic lupus erythematosus was already described in literature. there are no previous reports in the literature about the association of UCTD and AFOP. it is a rare association that may be increasingly reported in the literature."}
