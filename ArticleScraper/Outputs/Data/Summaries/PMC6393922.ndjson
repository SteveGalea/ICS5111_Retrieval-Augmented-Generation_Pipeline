{"summary": "HCV replication cycle takes place into the cytoplasmic compartment of hepatocyte. chronic liver infection can evolve to steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and in a small percentage (about 20%) of chronically infected patients it can develop to the end-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. hepatocytes overexpressing HCV core protein have reduced GSH levels and increased the oxidation of thioredoxin (Trx) patients with chronic hepatitis C show a depletion of GSH content, which increases after antioxidant treatment. the de novo synthesis of GSH is controlled by the transcription factor Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2), which regulates the expression of cytoprotective genes. some studies demonstrate that acute HCV infection is associated with an early induction of proteins functioning in cellular stress responses, including the Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response. plasmid was linearized by XbaI digestion and treated with mung bean nuclease to remove 5\u2032 end overhangs. aliquots were mixed with 10 g of in vitro transcribed RNA and dispensed into 0.4 cm Gene Pulser cuvettes. cell supernatants were plated and incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 and 100% relative humidity. cells were splitted every 3 days, and virus infectivity measured by immunofluorescence assay. the level of HCV infection was determined three days postinfection by immunofluorescence staining for HCV core protein. the wells showing positive staining for HCV core protein were counted. the TCID50 titer was interpolated using the Reed-Muench method. Western Blotting Cells were detached, washed with cold PBS, and centrifuged at 700 g for 10 min. pellet was lysed in cold RIPA lysis buffer (20 mM TRIS pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X 100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. tGSH and GSSG were determined by comparison with standards. tGSH was masked by 2-vinylpyridine for 1 h before the assay. tGSH and GSSG were determined by comparison with standardized protein content. apoptosis detection kit allows discrimination among early apoptotic, late apoptotic, and necrotic cells. cellROX (5 M) was added to cell cultures and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes. cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%), and samples were immediately analyzed with an LRS II cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) a comparative real-time PCR analysis of gene expression was performed with the iQTM SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, 170-8880) and analyzed on lightCycler iQTM 5 (Bio-Rad, 170-8880) the following forward and reverse primers were used: NOX4 (5\u2032-CAGGAGAACCAGGAGATTGTTG-3\u2032 forward; 5\u2032-GAAGTTGAGCATCATCATG-3\u2032 reverse); in vitro transcribed genotype 2a RNA was used as a standard to quantify copy numbers of viral RNA. all data reported were verified in at least 3 independent experiments. all data reported were verified in at least 3 independent experiments. 0.4 ml aliquots were mixed with 10 g of in vitro transcribed RNA. samples were pulsed using a Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) cells were resuspended in 20 ml of complete growth medium, plated and incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 and 100% relative humidity. the titer of infectious HCV was determined by the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assay. cell supernatants were serially diluted 10-fold in complete DMEM. the level of HCV infection was determined three days postinfection. fluorescent images were acquired on an Olympus IX70 microscope equipped with nanomover and softWoRx DeltaVision image acquisition software. images were captured under constant exposure time, gain, and offset. Western Blotting Cells were detached, washed with cold PBS, and centrifuged at 700 g for 10 min. mouse monoclonal antitubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, T5168), and mouse monoclonal anti-Lamin A/C (Sigma-Aldrich, L1293) were detected through peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Jackson), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. densitometry was done using Quantity One 1-D Analysis software. apoptosis was determined by comparison with standards, normalized to protein content, and expressed as nmol/mg protein. the gSH content was obtained by subtracting the GSSG from the tGSH. the quantitative evaluation of apoptosis was performed by a double-staining flow cytometry method. real-time RT-PCR analysis Total RNA was isolated from control and HCV-infected cells. RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the iScriptTM cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, 1708890) the production of intracellular viral RNA was assessed by quantitative one-step RT-PCR carried out using an ABI 7000 Real-Time PCR System. 5 l of total RNA was mixed with 2x TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix (ABI), 1 M forward (TCCCGGGAGAGCCATAGT), 1 M reverse primers (CCCAGTCTTCCCGGCAATT) and 200 nM probe (FAM- CACCGGTTCCGCAGACC in the late stage of infection (76 days postinfection p.i.), only about 15% of the cells expressed the core protein. the HCV RNA in intracellular compartment reached the highest titer (3.59 107 1.3 106 copies/g total RNA P 0.001 vs. p0) 8 days p.i., and it decreased after the recovery phase of the cell culture. apoptotic death in infected cells coincided with the highest intracellular viral RNA titer. from 37 days p.i. up to 76 days p.i., the percentage of apoptotic cells returned to control values upon recovery of the cultures. apoptotic death in infected cells coincided with the highest intracellular viral RNA titer. qRT-PCR analysis of cell viability in uninfected (CTR) and HCV-infected cells at different days postinfection. mean SD from three independent experiments shown. a significant increase in intracellular ROS levels was detected in infected cells 8 days p.i. (p2), when HCV RNA reached the maximum value, and was maintained at high levels during all the apoptotic crisis period. the results suggest that intracellular ROS-mediated oxidative stress was induced by HCV replication. blot is one representative experiment out of three performed. unpaired t test: P 0.05 and P 0.01 vs. CTR (considered as 100%) in the early steps of acute phase of infection, GSH content diminished of about 40% (P 0.05, P 0.01 at 2 (p0) and 6 (p1) days p.i, respectively) compared to uninfected cells. in contrast, the GSH levels in infected cells were significantly higher (about 70%) during cell recovery (p3) compared to the control cells. the graph represents the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) versus oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in infected cells (I) vs. CTR cells (considered as 100%) Western blot of uninfected (C) and HCV-infected (I) Huh7.5 cells at different times of infection using anti-Nrf2 antibody. lamin A/C was used as a loading control. unpaired t test: P 0.05 and P 0.01 vs. CTR (considered as 100%) oxidative stress induction could favor viral replication that in turn caused cell damage and death. oxidative stress induction could favor viral replication that in turn caused cell damage and death. human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (Huh7.5) was infected with HCV at low (0.01) m.o.i. to allow a multiple-cycle replication. after viral adsorption, cell culture viability was monitored at different time points. the number of viral core positive cells was estimated by immunofluorescence. trypan blue dye exclusion assay showed a significant decrease of alive cells during the so-called \u201ccrisis\u201d phase that lasted about two weeks during which the infected cultures were not splitted. annexin V/PI double staining of cells showed that infected cells underwent apoptotic death only during the crisis phase. percentage of HCV core-positive cells decreased to 15% (Figure 1(a) right panel) vs. 80% of the acute phase, thus mirroring viral titer trend. results suggest steady state level of HCV replication. initial infection of Huh7.5 cells with low m.o.i. leads to an acute in vitro infection featured by apoptotic death of infected cells. this latter is followed by the recovery of the infected cells characterized by lower virus replication and subsequently by the establishment of a persistent infection, here named chronic phase. the impact of intracellular HCV replication on cellular redox environment is so far contradictory. data obtained from the samples relative to 8 and 14 days p.i. are shown as one representative experiment out of three performed. numbers represent the median fluorescence intensity. results are expressed as percentage of variation vs. CTR uninfected cells considered as 100. NOX4 protein expression was upregulated in infected cells during the acute phase, while it was decreased during the chronic phase. similar results were obtained for NOX1 enzyme, although its decrease began earlier (p3) than NOX4. Collectively, these data suggest NOX enzymes as one possible player in HCV-induced ROS production. >1 [37] was shifted toward the oxidized form and was 1 (p1 and p2) during the acute and chronic phase of infection. mRNA levels of GR were strongly upregulated during the early steps of infection. gene expression was measured in uninfected (CTR) and HCV-infected cells at different passages of infection. unpaired t test: P 0.05 and P 0.01 vs. CTR. oxidative stress during the acute phase is useful in long-term cultures. auranofin-induced Oxidative Stress leads to increased levels of HCV RNA Copies. oxidative stress induction could favor viral replication that in turn caused cell damage and death. RT-PCR analysis of HCV viral titer in absence or absence of Au. results from one representative experiment out of three performed. hepatocyte damage during in vitro infection was considered to be mediated by the immune system. the presence of low number of core expressing cells, parallel by the low level viral RNA titer, indicated the ability of the JFH1 clone of HCV to persistently infect susceptible cell cultures. the reason why both NOX enzymes were downmodulated in infected cells during the chronic phase is still unclear. we hypothesize that it could be a further mechanism induced by the virus to maintain reducing environment into host cell for the establishment of its persistence. further studies will be needed to clarify this aspect. a great debate on the induction and modulation of oxidative stress by HCV and its relationship with acute or chronic phase of infection. the oxidized environment seems to be necessary for HCV to replicate as demonstrated by viral titer peak in the acute phase. the mechanisms through which HCV manipulates redox environment to its advantage are not fully clarified yet. authors suggest that the nuclear translocation of p-Nrf2 might play an important role in the expression of genes which contribute to regulate apoptosis and HCV persistence [25, 26, 30, 62] authors suggest that the high GSH levels registered in chronically infected cells might be partly related to the activation of Nrf2 pathway. the acute phase of HCV infection is characterized by a marked oxidative stress that, similarly to other viruses, is useful for viral replication. the restoration of reducing redox conditions that characterize the chronic phase of infection might play a key role in decreasing viral replication and apoptotic death. authors declare that there is no conflict of interests."}
