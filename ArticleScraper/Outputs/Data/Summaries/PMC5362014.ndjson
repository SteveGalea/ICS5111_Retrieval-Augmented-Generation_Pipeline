{"summary": "retrospective analysis was to determine the seroprevalence of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) antigenaemia among owned cats in Vienna and the surrounding area. all samples were sent to the university as part of routine diagnostic procedures, either to determine infection in clinically symptomatic individuals or to rule out infection prior to vaccination. y cats,7 and a study in 2009 reported a prevalence of FeLV of 3.6% among >17,000 owned felines in Germany. samples taken from healthy cats in the UK in 1989 demonstrated a prevalence of 5%,2 while a later study of pet cats determined a prevalence of just 1.4% in clinically healthy animals in 2002.3. these lower rates appear to demonstrate the effectiveness of control programmes throughout the UK. between 1996 and 2000, the FASTest FeLV ELISA (Megacor Diagnostik GmbH; sensitivity and specificity not retrospectively available) was used to test samples. from 2001 to 2004, samples were tested with the ViraCHEK FeLV ELISA. presence of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) antigenaemic cats between 1996 and 2011 decreased gradually. over the 16 year period, 4465 samples were analysed. no age was given for >50% of cats included in the 2008 group. the prevalence of FeLV antigenaemic animals in 1996 was 7.4% compared with 5.9% in 2008\u20132011. the difference between the year groups is therefore 1.5% (95% CI 1.3 to 4.3) 2 test \u2013 age of feline leukaemia virus antigenaemic cats Age (years) 1996 2008\u20132011 Total 2 value (with Yates correction) P value 0\u20131 24 9 33 >1 31 7 38 Total 55 16 71 0.854 0.3733 5 43 15 58 >5 12 1 13 Total 55 16 71 2.506 0.1564. studies on neighbouring countries in the 1990s reported similar FeLV prevalences to the Austrian example. prior to the availability of a FeLV vaccine and of a rapid in-clinic test, cats tested in the mid-1980s were likely to be clinically symptomatic. the number of samples routinely tested for FeLV decreased dramatically from 1985 to 2011. from 22,053 samples between 1985 and 1995 to 4465 samples between 1996 and 2011 in the current study. however, this study still includes a much larger cat population than similar studies in neighbouring countries. ELISA-positive but virus isolation-negative cats have previously been described and may occur at the beginning or end of an infection. sensitivity of a variety of market in-house ELISAs when compared with the gold standard of virus isolation has been reported to be between 92.1% and 96.8%. the positive predictive values of samples in two different in-house ELISAs ranged from 81.4% to a maximum of 96.7%, depending on which assays were used. repeat testing with ELISA or another test method is essential in every healthy cat with a positive FeLV antigen test result. sex on FeLV-positive results were less statistically powerful than the analysis of overall prevalence. it would have been relevant to have analysed factors relating to the cats\u2019 household situations. however, given the retrospective nature of this study, such data were not available."}
