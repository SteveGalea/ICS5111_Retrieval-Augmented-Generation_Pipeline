{"summary": "the well-studied model of tail morphology in bacteriophage classification was used for comparison with nucleotide usage patterns. bacteriophages have unique TUD patterns, representing genomic signatures that are relatively conserved among those with similar host range. analysis of phylogenies based on phenotypic systems is limited by convergent evolution. tail morphology forms the basis for bacteriophage classification into 3 separate families. prokaryotes most commonly have been taxonomically classified according to a single locus, 16S rRNA. tide usage patterns retain phylogenetic signal among many related prokaryotes. differences between tetranucleotide usage and 16S rRNA in ancestral reconstruction likely are due to horizontal influences, such as extensive recombination, and/or presence of restriction/modification systems. oligonucleotide biases (e.g. dinucleotide and trinucleotide biases) through markov chain analysis results in a substantial loss of TUD phylogenetic signal [19]. the patterns of tetranucleotide usage are relatively well-conserved across all bacteriophages studied. the ordinate represents the number of tetranucleotide combinations within each interval. panel A: Red \u2013 Enterobacteria phage HK022 (Siphoviridae), Green \u2013 Enterobacteria phage P2 (Myoviridae), Blue \u2013 Shigella phage V (Podoviridae) a parallel relationship is shown by comparing Burkholderia cepaciae phage 1. the two Enterobacteria phages share high level TUD similarity. results are parallel for Streptococcus phages and for Mycobacterium phages. logeny TUD patterns in prokaryotes have phylogenetic content similar to that of 16S rRNA [19]. phylogenies based on TUD patterns were generated assuming that phylogenetic structure would be predicted by host range, tail morphology, a combination of both, or essentially be random. phylogenies were created by neighbor-joining analysis. colors indicate Myoviridae (contractile tails; blue), Podoviridae (short tail stubs; green), and Siphoviridae (long tails; red) bootstrap values >50 based on 100 replicates are represented at each node. the phylogeny is consistent with a model of host-phage co-evolution. exceptions include Bacillus phages PZA and GA-1, Pseudomonas phage Phi KMV and several Enterobacteria phages that cluster independent of presumed host. the single stranded RNA viruses cluster together, with the exception of togaviruses and coronaviruses. picornoviruses cluster with the exception of foot and mouth virus, and paramyxoviruses cluster with the exception of RSV. small double stranded DNA viruses cluster, but are separate from large double stranded DNA viruses. logeny based on gene content approximates that of 16S rRNA. phylogeny appears more robust than TUD phylogeny for positive-sense RNA viruses, both large and small DNA viruses, single stranded DNA viruses, and retroviruses. tetranucleotide usage patterns in each genome deviate from those expected based on overall nucleotide content. zero-order Markov algorithms were chosen, as removal of constituent oligonucleotide biases (e.g. dinucleotide and trinucleotide biases) through markov chain analysis results in a substantial loss of TUD phylogenetic signal. the observed/expected TUD was determined for the 256 tetranucleotide combinations for each bacteriophage genome. the ordinate represents the number of tetranucleotide combinations within each interval. Enterobacteria phage HK022 is more closely related in TUD to Enterobacteria phage P2 (R2 = 0.649; Figure 3a) than to Mycobacterium phage Bxz1 (R2 = 0.067; Figure 3b). a parallel relationship is shown by comparing Burkholderia cepaciae phage 1 with Bordetella phage BIP-1 (R2 = 0.561) panel C: Streptococcus pneumoniae phage EJ1 vs. MM1 (Siphoviridae) phylogeny TUD patterns in prokaryotes have phylogenetic content similar to that of 16S rRNA. phylogenies based on TUD patterns were generated assuming that phylogenetic structure would be predicted by host range, tail morphology, a combination of both, or essentially be random. phylogenies were created by neighbor-joining analysis. colors indicate Myoviridae (contractile tails; blue), Podoviridae (short tail stubs; green), and Siphoviridae (long tails; red) phylogeny is consistent with a model of host-phage co-evolution. exceptions include Bacillus phages PZA and GA-1, Pseudomonas phage Phi KMV, and several Enterobacteria phages that cluster independent of presumed host. phylogeny was determined using representative species to determine phylogenetic structure. eukaryotic viruses are associated based on family, size, and type of genetic material. important trends include: 1) the single stranded RNA viruses cluster together. phylogeny based on gene content also approximates that of 16S rRNA. prokaryotes have genomic signatures that contain phylogenetic signal at both the dinucleotide and the dinucleotide [25] and the dinucleotide [25]. bacteriophage genomic signatures are associated with their host organisms. this is most likely the effect of co-evolution between host and parasite. both phage and host avoid use of certain tetranucleotides recognized by host restriction/modification systems. mycobacterium phage TUD patterns more closely approximate each other than their prokaryote hosts. nucleotide usage patterns are relatively homogenous across each phage genome. this suggests that the proportion of horizontally transferred genes in phage genomes may be relatively small or subject to rapid amelioration. the Bacillus phages are Phi29-like phages, with many known similarities at the genetic level [29], further suggesting their phylogenetic distinctness. each of these phage groups has substantial strand bias [31], indicating their unique differences compared to other phage groups. the TUD analysis shows separate grouping of the large and small double stranded DNA viruses. the polyphylogeny observed among the large and small DNA viruses, the positive-sense RNA viruses, and the single stranded DNA viruses reflect methodologic limitations or evolutionarily significant phenomena. we based our minimum genome sequence length on the assumption that 95% of tetranucleotide combinations should occur at least 10 times. the minimum genome length analyzed in this study was 4.7 kb (9.4 kb when analyzing both strands), while pentanucleotides would have required a minimum genome length of 20 kb. a zero-Order Markov algorithm was used to determine the expected number of tetranucleotides by the expected oligonucleotide word frequency is determined by removing biases existing in component oligonucleotides. the frequency of the word F(W) is expressed as the ratio of the observed O(W) to the expected E(W). the frequency of the word F(W) can be determined for all windows Fw(W) of specified size within each genome. phylogeny based on gene content was determined using an operational definition of orthology. phylogenies were constructed based on distance matrices using Phylip 3.5 [40], reviewed via Treeview [41], and displayed using midpoint rooting with Paup 4.0b10 [42]. tetranucleotides Tetranucleotides were selected for study because analysis of higher-order oligonucleotides was not possible given the limitation in virus genome sizes. the minimum genome length analyzed in this study was 4.7 kb (9.4 kb when analyzing both strands), while pentanucleotides would have required a minimum genome length of 20 kb. each tetranucleotide is expressed as the ratio of observed to expected. tetranucleotide differences in each genome were determined using Swaap 1.0.1 [36]. the frequency of the word F(W) is expressed as the ratio of the observed to expected. phylogeny based on gene content was determined using Swaap PH 1.0.1 [39]. phylograms were constructed based on distance matrices using paup 4.0b10 [42]. distances were expressed as one minus the percent of shared genes. differences in -ln L for random phylograms can be considered as the null distribution, obtained when there is no more similarity in topology than expected by chance. if the -ln L values for comparisons among the phylograms are within the 99th percentile of the null distribution, then the topologies are significantly different."}
