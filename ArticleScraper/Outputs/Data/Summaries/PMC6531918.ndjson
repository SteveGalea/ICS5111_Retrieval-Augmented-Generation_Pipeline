{"summary": "inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been one of the most frequently investigated human health issues associated with the gut microbiota. more than 3.6 million people worldwide are affected with IBD, including Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) the incidence of these diseases has been increasing in recent decades. a few models of colitis exist, but in particular, the C. rodentium-induced colitis model has been well documented for studying the pathogenesis of host responses to enteric bacteria. research related to C. rodentium is a key step for developing innovative prophylactic and therapeutic treatments. the study sample comprised pathogen-free female C57BL/6 mice. the control group (CTRL, n = 10) and the C. rodentium-infection group (CR-infection, n = 10) received a basal rodent diet. the quercetin group (QUE, n = 10) received a basal rodent diet. colonic mucosal tissue specimens were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 3-m sections. sections were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) for visualization under a microscope. the taxonomic assignment of the OUTs was annotated using RDP reference (version 16) with an identity threshold of 97% in the UPARSE pipeline. the OTU table with taxonomic assignments was converted into the \u201cbiom\u201d format. mice were fed quercetin and/or basal rodent diet for 2 weeks. each mouse was housed in an individual cage to avoid reinfection. colonic mucosal tissues of all mice were removed using razors in ice. the colonic mucosal tissues were pulverized using surgical scissors. the tissue homogenates were then centrifuged at 1,900 g at 4\u00b0C for 15 min. the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17, IL-6, TNF-, and IL-10 were measured using commercial ELISA kits. the body weights of the mice in the CTRL and QUE groups were not significantly different before and after the experiment. the mice in the CR-infection group showed signs of colitis. the CR-infection and QUE groups showed significantly elevated IL-10 levels (Figure 3A), IL-17 (Figure 3B), IL-6 (Figure 3C) and TNF- (Figure 3D) levels (all p 0.05) quercetin supplementation in the QUE group appeared to mitigate the C. rodentium-induced increases in the IL-17 (Figure 3B), IL-6 (Figure 3C), and TNF- (Figure 3D) levels (p 0.05). the QUE group showed increased Chao1 (Figure 4B), Shannon (Figure 4C) and ACE indices (Figure 4D) compared with the CR-infection group, the QUE group showed increased Chao1 (Figure 4B), Shannon (Figure 4C), and ACE indices (Figure 4D) the QUE group showed enhanced populations of Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Clostridia but suppressed populations of Fusobacterium and Enterococcus. the QUE group showed enhanced populations of Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Clostridia. mouse strains develop only subclinical symptoms and are considered resistant to C. rodentium-induced colitis. mouse models of C. rodentium-induced infection are the most useful for studying infectious diseases and colitis in mice because they have been well documented for host responses to pathogenic bacteria. decreased diversity has also been observed in inflamed and noninflamed tissues. CD patients generally exhibit reduced bacterial loads at inflammation sites. quercetin supplementation increased gut microbial diversity. in the present study, C. rodentium-infected mice showed significantly increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-, and IL-17 in the colonic mucosal tissues compared with CTRL mice (not infected). this finding indicates that quercetin might restore the appropriate host-microbe relationship required to manage colitis by restoring the proinflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and bactericidal functions of enteric macrophages.
