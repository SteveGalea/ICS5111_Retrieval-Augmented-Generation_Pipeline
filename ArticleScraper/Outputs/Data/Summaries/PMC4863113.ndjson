{"summary": "cortex phellodendri is the dried bark of Phellodendron chinense Schneid. it is bitter in flavor and cold in nature, categorized in kidney, urinary bladder, and large intestine meridians. air-dried C. phellodendri was milled into powder and immersed into 70% ethanol (5 L) for 24 h. the supernatant was collected and evaporated under reduced pressure. n-butyl alcohol extract was further evaporated under reduced pressure. mice were housed at room temperature (20\u201325\u00b0C) and constant humidity (50\u201360%) under a 12 h light-dark cycle in an animal facility. experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of the South-Central University for Nationalities. mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injection administration of 0.9% saline solution containing 0.6 mg OVA and 0.4 mg of adjuvant aluminum hydroxide on days 1 and 8. Lung slices were placed in a chamber and were held with a small nylon mesh. perfusion was maintained in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) at a rate of 800 L/min. air-dried C. phellodendri was milled into powder and immersed into 70% ethanol (5 L) for 24 h. the components in the mixture were extracted by hot reflux. the supernatant was collected and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. mice were sensitized by intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 mL of 0.9% saline solution containing 0.6 mg OVA and 0.4 mg of adjuvant aluminum hydroxide. mice were challenged from days 15 through 19 by daily intranasal instillation of 50 L of OVA solution (3 mg/mL) HBSS was supplemented with 20 mM HEPES buffer. images of lung slices under 10x objective were acquired at the rate of 30 frames/min. results are expressed as the mean SEM. NBAECP inhibits high K+-induced contraction in TRs. high K+ triggered contractions in a healthy (i.e., control) TR. the sustained contraction was totally blocked. NBAECP inhibits ACH-induced precontraction in TRs. a similar experiment was performed in asthmatic TRs. nifedipine partially inhibits ACH-induced contraction. nifedipine-resistant TRs were incubated with 10 M nifedipine for 10 min. we then observed the action of Pyr 3 (an inhibitor of TRPC3 and STIM/Orai channels) however, Pyr 3-induced relaxation in asthmatic TRs was markedly greater than in controls. Identical experiments were conducted in lung slices from asthmatic mice. results indicated that NBAECP had similar relaxant action on bronchial smooth muscle. NBAECP inhibits high K+-induced contraction in TRs. high K+ triggered contractions in a healthy (i.e., control) TR. the sustained contraction was totally blocked. NBAECP-induced relaxation in 7 control and 6 asthmatic TRs. results indicated that NBAECP could block ACH-induced sustained contractions in control. nifedipine-resistant TRs were incubated with 10 M nifedipine for 10 min. we then observed the action of Pyr 3 (an inhibitor of TRPC3 and STIM/Orai channels) however, Pyr 3-induced relaxation in asthmatic TRs was markedly greater than in the controls. identical experiments were conducted in lung slices from asthmatic mice. results indicated that NBAECP had similar relaxant action on bronchial smooth muscle. high K+ could induce membrane depolarization, resulting in activation of voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) high K+-induced contractions completely depended on L-type Ca2+ channel-mediated Ca2+ influx. inhibition of high K+-induced contraction due to NBAECP resulted in the inhibition of L-type Ca2+ channels, thus terminating Ca2+ influx. nifedipine partially inhibited ACH-induced contraction in TRs. TRPC3 and/or STIM/Orai channels also play roles in ACH-induced contractions. nifedipine-resistant and Pyr 3-resistant contractions also inhibit ACH-induced contractions. NBAECP can inhibit agonist-induced sustained contractions of healthy and asthmatic airway smooth muscle. findings indicate that NBAECP could be a new inhibitor of asthma attacks. authors declare no conflict of interests."}
