{"summary": "at present, at least two issues are not well understood. theory requires weak or no epistasis among alleles. evidence accumulates epistasis may be strong and even affect the sign of the fitness effects of alleles, changing deleterious into beneficial alleles. directed evolution experiments combine in vitro mutation and recombination protocols with in vitro or in vivo selection. they are an effective approach for improving or altering the functionality of biomacromolecules, from nucleic acids to enzymes. this approach allows the identification of small benefits associated with recombination, which are revealed only over long evolutionary periods. a biomacromolecule can be represented as an exploratory walk in this high-dimensional fitness landscape. in natural evolution, organisms explore the fitness landscape by generating genetic diversity. this diversity is the raw material upon which natural selection operates via the consequences it has for reproduction and survival. sequence space exploration during evolution of a gene by mutation alone (asexual) and mutation and recombination (sexual) different kinds of recombination are depicted: homologous and non-homologous. recombination between the two local peak genotypes E and F (black solid arrows) might speed up the ascent of the global peak G. recombination should counter the accumulation of deleterious mutations. weak negative epistasis among fitness-affecting alleles, and genetic drift and selection in the absence of epistasis. there is growing support for the prevalence of much stronger epistasis affecting the sign of the fitness effects of alleles. recombination benefits may exist even when sign epistasis prevails. recombination itself is predicted to affect the epistatic architecture of the genome. long-term recombination benefits may arise also on rugged fitness landscapes when environmental conditions change sufficiently rapidly or populations are polymorphic. directed evolution has been also termed \u2018evolutionary protein engineering\u2019. it has been successfully used to create \u2018artificial\u2019 biomacromolecules. iterative cycles of generation of variation, selection/screening and amplification mimic Darwinian evolution. iterative rounds of random mutagenesis and selection have been the most frequently used method in directed evolution experiments. it mimics the \u2018step by step\u2019 exploration of the fitness landscape where asexual populations move \u2018uphill\u2019 towards a fitness peak. in vitro recombination experiments can start from two (pairwise) or multiple (pool-wise) parental sequences with either high, low or no sequence homology. the process is similar to naturally occurring non-homologous recombination, such as during the horizontal transfer of new genes. virtually all forms of recombination occurring in nature can be performed in directed evolution experiments. recombination has not been systematically compared with asexual protocols (e.g. epPCR) in order to test for benefits of recombination, let alone to test population genetic theory on the advantages of sex. there are very few studies that have directly compared asexual and sexual evolution protocols. Stemmer compared three mutagenesis strategies for a phage display antibody library. the original protocol for DNA shuffling was also mutagenic. the same group later used DNA \u2018family\u2019 shuffling to recombine four cephalosporinases. homologous RACHITT monooxygenase improved catalysis jumps in sequence space comparison with other random mutagenesis [40] homologous DNA shuffling/combinatorial cassette mutagenesis -glucuronidase improved -galactosidase activity clonal interference comparison of DNA shuffling and recursive random mutagenesis. negative mutations were effectively removed, while beneficial mutations accumulated. recombination of structurally related proteins preserves function with a higher probability than random mutations introducing comparable genetic changes. a few studies used in vitro recombination of nucleic acids, both homologous [51,63,64] and non-homologous recombination [65\u201368], mediated by DNA shuffling either at the DNA level or directly catalysed by RNA [69\u201371]. in some studies, benefits of recombination have been observed. some speculate that the ribozyme occupied a fitness maximum in sequence space. non-homologous recombination of RNA can rapidly promote oligomer diversity [76,77], complexity [65,78] and new functionality [79]. recombination of preformed, short modular elements is a relevant mechanism for the natural evolution of RNA, as observed in current functional RNA molecules [80], viroids [81], and RNA virus genomes [82]. recombination is effectively the transfer of energetically equivalent chemical moieties from one substrate to another. it is a facile reaction that can occur with a variety of prebiotically relevant polymers (nucleic acids, polypeptides and lipids) the utility of such reactions in promoting informational diversity at the precipice of life could have been extreme. fish's theorem assumes infinite population size, and may not generally hold for finite populations. conditions leading to inefficient selection may sometimes provide adaptive benefits, which were ascribed to the ruggedness of the fitness landscapes involved. in vitro recombination studies provide two clear advantages for studying evolutionary significance of recombination relative to other approaches. the relative role of mutation and recombination can be compared under tightly controlled conditions, including a wide range of mutation and recombination rates. this allows for the detection of small effects of recombination, as well as a systematic comparison of mutation and recombination-based evolution schemes. observed recombination effects can be correlated with the topography of the local fitness landscape to examine the origin of linkage disequilibria underlying observed effects. further improvements of sequencing technologies may increase the maximum length of single sequences that can be analysed as haplotypes. funding D.P. and J.A.G.M.d.V. acknowledge financial support from the NWO.
