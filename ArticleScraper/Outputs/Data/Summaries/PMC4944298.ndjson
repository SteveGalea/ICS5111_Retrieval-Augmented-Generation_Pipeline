{"summary": "an RNA triphosphatase, a guanylyltransferase, and a guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) are used in viral and eukaryotic cellular mRNAs. the basic cap-0 structure m7GpppN is formed by sequential reactions catalyzed by an RNA triphosphatase, a guanylyltransferase, and coronavirus currently consists of four virus families, Arteriviridae (12.7- to 15.7-kb genomes; known as small-genome nidoviruses), Coronaviridae, Roniviridae, and the recently recognized Mesoniviridae (26.3 to 31.7 kb) the last three families are known as large-genome nidoviruses. nidovirus is the type species of the genus Okavirus in the family Roniviridae of the order Nidovirales. it has been associated with mortalities in black tiger shrimps (Penaeus monodon) and economic losses to shrimp farming in eastern Australia. nidoviruses may have evolved from arthropods, according to bioinformatics analysis. all nidoviruses except arteriviruses encode a 2\u2032-O-MTase domain at the C-terminal end of their large pp1ab replicase polyprotein. all large-genome nidoviruses except toroviruses possess an N7-MTase domain. ronivirus nsp16 possesses 2\u2032-O-MTase activity in vitro. this is in contrast with coronavirus nsp16, which requires virus-encoded nsp10 as a cofactor for its full function. these results extend our understanding of nidovirus RNA capping and methylation. pGEX-6p-1-GAV nsp10 and pGEX-6p-1-GAV nsp16 were cloned into the genome. the mutant plasmids of pGEX-6p-1-GAV nsp16 were generated by one-step PCR with mutagenic primers. pET30a-EToV nsp16 (pp1ab residues 6593 to 6857; 265 aa) was cloned into E. coli expression vectors pET30a and pGEX-6p-1. pET30a-EToV nsp16 was expressed and purified similarly to GAV nsp16. the cells were grown in LB medium containing kanamycin at 37\u00b0C. the bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. EToV nsp10 was 17 kDa in size. reaction mixture was mixed thoroughly and incubated for 16 h at 37\u00b0C. 2 units of Turbo DNase was added, followed by a further incubation for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. pppACn, pppUC20, pppGC20, and pppCC20 were transcribed. control substrates G*pppA-RNA and 7MeG*pppA-RNA were prepared using the vaccinia virus protein D1-D12, which has the activities of both GTase and N7-MTase. the control substrates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and were purified as described previously (5). alignment of nsp16 protein sequences from different Nidovirales species was performed by using ClustalX. the result was imported into ESPript 3.0, together with the 3D structure of SARS-CoV nsp16/nsp10. pGEX-6p-1-GAV nsp10 and pGEX-6p-1-GAV nsp16 were cloned into the gene. the mutant plasmids were generated by one-step PCR with mutagenic primers. the genes of equine torovirus (EToV) were obtained. gene fragments were cloned into E. coli expression vectors pET30a and pGEX-6p-1, respectively, generating the plasmids pET30a-EToV nsp16 and pGEX-6p-1-EToV nsp16. pET30a-EToV nsp16 (pp1ab residues 6593 to 6857; 265 aa) was expressed and purified coli BL21(DE3) was grown in LB medium containing kanamycin at 37\u00b0C. the cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. the bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. the reaction mixture was mixed thoroughly and incubated for 16 h. 2 units of Turbo DNase was added, followed by a further incubation for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. the nonviral RNA substrates pppACn, pppUC20, pppGC20, and pppCC20 were transcribed and purified as described previously. the control substrates G*pppA-RNA and 7MeG*pppA-RNA were prepared using the vaccinia virus protein D1-D12. the capped RNAs were digested with nuclease P1 (U.S. Biological) to release the cap structures and were then loaded onto polyethyleneimine cellulose F plates. alignment of nsp16 protein sequences from different Nidovirales species was performed by using ClustalX. the result was imported into ESPript 3.0, together with the three-dimensional (3D) structure of SARS-CoV nsp16/nsp10 to assign the secondary structure. coronavirus nsp16 and nsp10 are arbitrarily named EToV or GAV nsp16 and nsp10, respectively, in analogy to CoV protein nomenclature. the well-characterized 2\u2032-O-MTases SARS-CoV nsp10/nsp16 and vaccinia virus VP39 were used as controls. chymotrypsin-like proteinase (3CLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase (Hel), exonuclease (ExoN), N7-methyltransferase (N7MT), uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (Ne; also abbreviated NendoU) and 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (2OMT) expression and pur we first conducted 2\u2032-O-MTase activity assays in vitro using a 21-nt RNA substrate (the cap-0 7MeGpppAC20) that was capped and methylated at the position of the cap. all assays with GAV proteins were performed at 20\u00b0C while all the other assays were at 37\u00b0C. nsp16 was incubated with 7MeG*pppA-RNA in the presence of 0.2 mM SAM. after incubation, the RNA was digested with nuclease P1 to release the cap structure. radiolabeled cap analogs G*pppA, 7MeG*pppA, and7MeG*pppAm, generated by vaccinia virus D1/D12 and VP39, were used as controls an RNA representing the first 68 nucleotides of the GAV genome was capped to form 7MeG*pppA-RNA, incubated with GAV nsp16, digested by nuclease P1 to release cap structures. the error bars indicate standard deviations. capped RNA oligonucleotide pppAC20 and capped RNA oligonucleotide GpppAC20 were used as substrates. 3H-methyl groups could not be incorporated either by GAV nsp16 or by SARS-CoV nsp16/nsp10. nsp16 could methylate only the cap-0 structure of RNA substrates (7MeGpppA-RNA) different nucleotides followed by 20 cytidines, 7MeGpppAC20, 7MeGpppCC20, 7MeGpppppCC20, and 7MeGpppppGC20 were treated with purified GAV nsp16 in the presence of 3H-labeled SAM. the products were purified and measured by liquid scintillation counting. the results indicate that GAV nsp16 2\u2032-O- the activity of GAV nsp16 reached a plateau when the RNA length reached 6 nucleotides (n = 5 to 8) the activity of GAV nsp16 reached a plateau when the RNA length exceeded 9 nucleotides (n > 8) these results imply that the in vitro 2\u2032-O-MTase activity of GAV nsp16 requires a certain length of RNA substrate for full activity. RNAs were purified with Sephadex A-50 and detected by liquid scintillation counting. an activity of 100% corresponds to that at pH 8.0. we then tested the influence of pH on GAV nsp16 activity. the conserved K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad of the GAV 2\u2032-O-MTase is required for activity. the group of 2\u2032-O-methyltransferases contains a conserved K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad, which is vital for RNA 2\u2032-O-MTase activity (20, 41, 42) to identify the conserved K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad the residues of the predicted K-D-K-E tetrad in GAV nsp16 are located in an -helix with three parallel -strands. the structural model predicts that GAV nsp16 possesses a six-stranded -sheet instead of the seven-stranded -sheet of many known 2\u2032-O-methyltransferases (5, 43) the missing -strand of GAV nsp16 would correspond to four residues (K39, D114, K144, and E178) were mutated to either alanine or an amino acid residue with similar chemical properties (R for K, E for D, and D for E) the wild-type enzyme possessed about 50% of the activity of SARS-CoV nsp10/nsp16 (the positive control) when tested under their respective optimal conditions. MTase activities of GAV nsp16 (WT and mutants) detected by using 7MeGppp-RNA (GAV 5\u2032 UTR) as the substrate in 3H-methyl incorporation assays. lane 4 represents the WT of GAV nsp16; lane 2 is a negative control, lane 3 is a positive control treated with vaccinia virus VP39. ed by previously characterized MTase inhibitors, such as S-(5\u2032-adenosyl)-l-homocysteine (SAH, or AdoHcy), sinefungin, and ribavirin. these three small molecules have often been used to inhibit SAM-dependent methyltransferases (39, 44, 45) nidoviruses encode a putative 2\u2032-O-MTase domain located at the most C-terminal end of the replicase pp1ab polyprotein (17) nidovirus nsp16 possesses SAM-dependent 2\u2032-O-MTase activity in the absence of another protein cofactor. the pp1ab polyprotein of EToV and GAV are indicated in Fig. 1A. it is notable that FCoV nsp16 exerts low activity of 2\u2032-O-MTase in the absence of nsp10 (20) however, our group has conducted an extensive analysis of the stimulating activities of nsp10 proteins of different coronaviruses. recombinant nsp10 and nsp16 of EToV, GAV, and EToV could be abundantly expressed in E. coli cells and purified to more than 95% homogeneity. cpm values reflect the 2\u2032-O-MTase activity detected by liquid scintillation counting. shrimps (P. monodon) naturally have a lower body temperature than mammals. all assays with GAV proteins were performed at 20\u00b0C. EToV nsp16 alone or in combination with nsp10 did not display 2\u2032-O-MTase activity. the 2\u2032-O-methylated cap (Fig. 2A, lane 4) generated by VP39 migrated more slowly than a cap-0 structure lacking 2\u2032-O methylation (7MeG*pppA) the migration of the cap structure released from 7MeG*pppA-RNA treated with GAV nsp16 corresponded to that of 7MeG*pppA. methyltransferase activities of GAV nsp16 and SARS nsp16 were incubated with AC20 (white), GpppAC20 (gray) and 7MeGpppppAC20 (black) in presence of 3H-labeled SAM for 1 h. radioactivity incorporation was detected by liquid scintillation counting. methylated cap-0 structure, 7MeGpppAC20 (black bars in Fig. 2B) were used as substrates. efficient incorporation of 3H-methyl groups by both GAV nsp16 and SARS-CoV nsp16/nsp10 was observed. vaccinia virus VP39 is a 2\u2032-O-MTase that modifies 5\u2032-capped mRNA without any sequence specificity. nsp16 2\u2032-O-MTase has a strong preference for 7MeGpppA-initiated RNA. this suggests that the length of the RNA substrate is relevant for GAV nsp16 2\u2032-O-MTase activity in vitro. the activity of GAV nsp16 reached a plateau when the RNA length exceeded 9 nucleotides (n > 8). we further characterized the biochemical parameters and optimal reaction conditions for GAV nsp16 in vitro. the optimal temperature of the methyltransferase reaction was determined. shrimps, which are the natural hosts of GAV, live in environments with low or variable temperatures. pH values between 6.0 and 11.0 were used. the GAV 2\u2032-O-MTase had optimal activity at pH 8.0. we also investigated the effect of divalent ions on GAV nsp16 at the optimal temperature and pH. the amino acids marked with asterisks in Fig. 4A constitute the predicted K-D-K-E tetrad of GAV nsp16 (Lys-39, Asp-114, Lys-144, and Glu-178) the residues of the predicted K-D-K-E tetrad in nidoviruses are completely conserved in the 2\u2032-O-methyltransferases of nidoviruses the -strands of the canonical MTase fold are labeled from 1 to 7. the -strands of the canonical MTase fold are labeled from 1 to 7, and additional -strands from B1 onward. the wild-type enzyme possessed about 50% of the activity of SARS-CoV nsp10/nsp16 when tested under their respective optimal conditions. when any of the four GAV residues was mutated to alanine, the 2\u2032-O-MTase activity was completely abolished. both the charges and the steric properties of the tetrad residues of GAV nsp16 influence its MTase activity. lane 2 is a negative control, lane 3 is a positive control treated with VP39. lane 3 is a positive control treated with vaccinia virus VP39. lanes 5 to 12 are mutants of GAV nsp16. the IC50 of AdoHcy is 0.34 M for the 2\u2032-O-MTase of dengue virus NS5MTaseDV (39) and 144 M for FCoV nsp16 (20). the activity was measured by using 3H-methyl incorporation MTase activity assays. onaviruses, the N7- and 2\u2032-O-MTases have been studied in detail. the guanylyltransferase of coronaviruses could function as an RNA triphosphatase (46) no experimental evidence for the activities of these enzymes is available for any of the other nidoviruses. GAV nsp16 can discriminate an N7-methylated RNA cap from a nonmethylated cap (20) this is different from other viral 2\u2032-O-MTases, such as those of dengue virus and meaban virus. vaccinia virus VP39 is a 2\u2032-O-MTase that works in a sequence-nonspecific manner (37) unlike coronavirus nsp16, in vitro, GAV nsp16 the equivalent of the 3-strand of SARS-CoV nsp16 is predicted to be missing in GAV nsp16. the RNA-binding groove on the surface of GAV nsp16 is longer than that of SARS nsp16. the latter is about 32 in length and fits well with the requirement for a 6-nt RNA substrate (7MeGpppAC5) -sheet arrayed in parallel in the middle of the protein surrounded by -helices and loops. the -sheet is seven stranded in nsp16 and many other known 2\u2032-O-methyltransferases. the -sheet is also reported for some other known 2\u2032-O-methyltransferases. ronivirus 2\u2032-O-MTase shows similarities and unique features compared with the coronavirus 2\u2032-O-MTase. the ronivirus 2\u2032-O-MTase shows both similarities and unique features compared with the coronavirus 2\u2032-O-MTase."}
