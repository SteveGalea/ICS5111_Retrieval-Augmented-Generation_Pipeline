{"summary": "chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects 170 million people worldwide. it can lead to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and end-stage liver diseases. current treatment of chronic HCV infection is limited to combination drug therapies, which are highly expensive. adenoviruses (Ad) are non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses containing a double-stranded DNA genome of 26\u201348 Kbp [21] they induce different levels of immunity against a single epitope from HCV NS3 antigen. it is not known if pre-existing heterologous immunity has any role in the HCV clearance. CV proteins with various adenoviral proteins (Ad proteins) found homology between multiple HCV peptide sequences from core, F, NS3, NS4 and NS5 proteins and a number of Ad proteins. immunization of mice with Ad vector not expressing exogenous HCV antigen(s), induces robust cross-reactive humoral and cellular immune responses against multiple HCV antigens. compared Ad proteins (27) showed homology (scores ranging between 25\u201340) with several peptides from HCV antigens core, F, NS3, NS4, NS5a and NS5b (S1\u2013S6 Datasets) the maximum homology scores shown by HCV peptides were core (45\u201350), F (45\u201350), NS3 (45\u201350), NS4 (35\u201340), NS5a (40\u201345) and HCV antigens E1, E2, P7 and NS2 showed low homology (25%) with the lowest number of Ad proteins. these were not tested for cross-reactive immune responses induced by Ad vector. DNA isolated from Ad vector does not contain HCV genes. the proliferation and IFN- production from spleen and lymph node T cells were determined in response to HCV core, NS3 and NS5 protein antigens. both spleen and inguinal lymph node T cells from Ad vector immunized mice showed high HCV antigens (core, NS3 and NS5)-dependent proliferation and IFN- production. cross-reactive proliferation and IFN- responses against selected individual peptides of core, F, NS cross-reactive antibody response against HCV antigens. data are presented as meanstandard deviation of 3\u20134 replicates. cross-reactive IgG antibodies against HCV protein antigens. proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells stimulated ex vivo with: (A) HCV proteins; (B) Representative peptides derived from HCV proteins using the CFSE-based assay. data are obtained from a pool (n = 5) of spleen cells and are representative of two independent experiments. cross-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells showed enhanced IFN- and IL-10 expression in comparison to the PBS group. however, the frequency of CD8+ T cells, which express IL-10 or both IFN- and IL-10, was not increased with any of the selected peptides except HCV core peptide #17. cross-reactive effector cells induced upon immunization with Ad vector immunized mice exert cytotoxicity to target cells loaded with HCV-derived peptides. different sets of CFSE-stained EL4 targets were prepared by loading them with pools of respective HCV antigen peptides. splenocytes induced after Ad vector immunization had potent cytotoxic effector function, in an antigen-specific manner. core, NS3, NS4 and NS5 were incubated with corresponding HCV peptides each at 1 g/ml concentrations for 4 days. the target EL4 cells were incubated with effectors at 10:1 ratio for 4\u20135 hours. CFSE-labeled live targets were quantified by flow cytometry. l/6 mice challenged with wild-type vaccinia (WT-Vac) or Vaccinia-HCV chimeric viruses. mice immunized with Ad vector in presence of poly I:C had significantly reduced Vac-HCV (core-NS2-NS3 or NS3-NS4-NS5) viral loads were determined in individual mice. data are presented as mean standard deviation of % reduction in viral titer compared to corresponding unimmunized control group. humans with pre-existing Ad immunity demonstrate cross-reactive humoral and cellular immune responses against HCV antigens. data shown as the percent increase in expression of IFN-, IL-10 and IFN-/IL-10 in an HCV antigens-dependent manner compared to controls (media) data for each donor and data points from all donors are plotted in stacked dot plots as meanSD. the maximum homology scores shown by HCV peptides were core (45\u201350), F (45\u201350), NS3 (45\u201350), NS4 (35\u201340), NS5a (40\u201345) and NS5b (40\u201345). similar homologies were found with ChAd25 sequences. first panel shows the DNA ladder followed by agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR products obtained with HCV core, F, NS3, NS4, NS5a and NS5b specific primers. hek lysate supernatant and rAd-HCV vectors were used as negative and positive controls. selected individual peptides of core, F, NS3, NS4 and NS5 antigens are shown in supplementary information. T cell proliferation and IFN- responses were also examined against synthetic peptides from HCV antigens NS3, NS4 and NS5 showing low (20%) or no homology. responses were not obtained above background. Splenocytes obtained from Ad vector immunized mice were stimulated ex vivo with HCV protein antigens (core, NS3, NS4 and NS5) or selected representative peptides from these proteins. cross-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells proliferate in HCV antigens-dependent manner. splenocytes from mice immunized with Ad vector and incubated with medium were used as negative controls. both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from Ad immunized mice showed increased expression of IFN- and IL-10 simultaneously upon stimulation with HCV proteins. cross-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were cultured with representative peptides derived from HCV core, NS3, NS4 or NS5 at 5 g/ml each. data are obtained from a pool (n = 5) of spleen cells and are representative of two independent experiments. splenocytes induced after Ad vector immunization had potent cytotoxic effector function, in an antigen-specific manner. splenocytes harvested from Ad vector immunized mice were stimulated in vitro with the HCV protein antigens core, NS3, NS4 and NS5 at 5 g/ml concentrations for 4 days. a surrogate Vac-HCV infection model was used to demonstrate the antiviral potential of the induced cross-reactive immune responses against HCV. vaccinia-HCV challenged mice were challenged with wild-type vaccinia (WT-Vac), or Vaccinia-HCV chimeric viruses. mice immunized twice intramuscularly with Ad vector (with or without poly I:C), PBS, or HEK cell lysate, were challenged 8 days after the second immunization with wild-type Vaccinia (WT-Vac) and viral loads in each mouse were determined by plaque-forming assay using TK-1 cells. healthy humans with pre-existing Ad immunity show HCV-specific cross-reactive immune responses. OD values for Ad-specific IgG from 19 healthy donors were arranged in ascending order and matched with corresponding OD values for IgG against different HCV antigens. a number of donors showed increased IFN- and IFN-/IL-10 expression in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells upon stimulation with HCV antigens. a number of donors showed increased IFN- and IFN-/IL-10 expression in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells upon stimulation with peptide pools from all four HCV antigens. heterologous immunity does not require the entire T cell epitope to be homologous. it has been shown that only 2\u20134 amino acids in the T cell epitopes actively participate in interaction with the TCR. a TCR will still recognize a peptide if its non-contact amino acid(s) are replaced with biochemically similar or even different amino acid(s) some individuals may show higher heterologous immunity against certain antigens. adenovirus does not encode for a complete sequence of HCV-core. adenovirus does not encode for a complete sequence of HCV-core. antibodies can recognize a linear peptide epitope or conformational epitope. the cross-reactive antibody response is expected to be contributed by the linear peptide epitope epitopes. antibodies produced in response to Ad vector immunization also show cross-reactivity with HCV antigens. only a minority of donors showed higher levels of IFN- expression compared to IL-10 in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. these results represent the existence of two discreet courses of natural cross-reactive cellular immune responses against HCV antigens. human subjects screened are seropositive to chimp Ad virus 3 and 22% are seropositive to a rare human Ad virus 6. homology between HCV epitopes and different adenoviruses spans across a number of adenoviral proteins. adenovirus-specific immunity against conserved epitopes has been shown across various human serotypes and also across species. adenovirus vector Replication-incompetent human adenovirus 5, with no transgene insert, was amplified and titrated in human embryonic cell line 293A (HEK-293A, source ATCC# CRL 1573). adenoviruses (rAd) expressing HCV antigens core (rAd-core), F (rAd-F), NS3 (rAd-NS3), NS4 ( PCR tubes were incubated in a thermo-cycler with initial denaturation at 92\u00b0C and 40 amplification cycles. amplification products were run on 1% agarose gel at 80 volts to resolve amplification products along with 1 KB sized Quick Load DNA Ladder. mice were euthanized 8 days after the second immunization and tissue samples were collected. the cells were resuspended in 2 ml of media and passed through an equilibrated nylon wool column. the column was washed after 45 min of incubation at 37\u00b0C and the flow through contained the splenic T cells. cytokine concentration per ml of culture supernatant was determined by multiplying the calculated concentration with the dilution factor. the averages of these concentrations (pg/ml) from duplicate wells were plotted in the graphs shown here. splenocytes cultured for 5 days with HCV antigens were cultured with ionomycin (1 g/ml), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or PMA (50 ng/ml) and brefeldin A (1.5 g/ml, Cat.# 00\u20134506) for 5 hours. stained with fluorochrome labeled antibodies for extracellular lineage markers. stained cells were run in a BD FACS Canto (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) stained cells were stained with isotype control antibodies with corresponding fluorochromes. EL4 cells were incubated with corresponding peptides for 4 days. mice were challenged with 1x107 PFU of Vac-HCV chimeric virus. mice were euthanized and ovaries were removed, homogenized and freeze-thawed three times in 1x PBS. ovaries were removed, homogenized and freeze-thawed three times in 1x PBS. control groups had viral titers in the range of 107108 pfu/mouse (Vac-C/NS3) and 108109 pfu/mouse (Vac-NS3/4/5). human blood donors, Plasma and PBMCs Peripheral blood samples were collected from healthy human donors of both sexes with no known history of HCV infection. anti-human IgG labeled with alkaline phosphatase (AP) for 1 hour. plates were washed with 1x PBST (1x PBS with 0.1% Tween-20) absorbance was measured at 405 nm, and corrected for background by subtracting the OD values obtained in control SOD-coated plates. phyto-hemagglutinin (PHA, 1 g/ml) and media-treated cells were considered positive and negative controls. cells were treated with 1.5 g/ml brefeldin A (Cat.# 00\u20134506, eBiosciences Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) for 5 hours. two tailed student t-test was used to determine the significant difference between two groups. P-values less than 0.05 (0.05) were considered statistically significant. ethics statement All animal experiments were approved by university of Alberta animal care and use committee. adenoviruses (rAd) expressing HCV antigens core (rAd-core), F (rAd-F), NS3 (rAd-NS3), NS4 (rAd-NS4) or NS5 (rAd-NS5) were prepared. PCR reaction was set up with 10 l template DNA obtained from the above preparation using 50 l total reaction volume. mice were immunized twice intramuscularly (at 14-day intervals) using an optimized dose (2x107 PFU/mouse) of Ad. mice were euthanized 8 days after the second immunization. rads were mixed with different HCV-derived proteins (core = c22-3, NS3 = c33c; NS4 = c100-3; NS5 = NS5 SOD, polyprotein c25 = core+NS3+NS4; polyprotein c200 = NS3+NS4 or control protein = rhSOD, provided by Chiron/Novartis) anti-mouse IgG labeled with alkaline phosphatase (AP) was added and plates were incubated for 1 hour. plates were washed with 1xPBST (1xPBS with 0.1% Tween-20) after each incubation step. splenocytes cultured for 5 days with HCV antigens were harvested and counted. splenocytes were stained with 1 M CFSE (Cat.# 21888, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in 1 ml of cell suspension for 7\u201310 minutes at room temperature. stained cells were cultured for four days and stained with isotype control antibodies with corresponding fluorochromes. enocytes harvested from Ad vector immunized mice were stimulated in vitro with the HCV protein antigens core, NS3, NS4, NS5 or polyprotein at 5 g/ml for 4 days. the target EL4 cells were incubated with corresponding HCV peptides (core peptides #: 2, 14, 17, 25, 27, 28, 32; NS3 peptides #: 8, 10; NS5a peptides #: 1, 2, 16, Homogenized samples were stored at -80\u00b0C until used for viral titer. unbound virus was removed and fresh 1x DMEM medium was added. plaques were fixed by using 10% formaldehyde at room temperature for 30 minutes. the upper plasma layer was frozen in aliquots for IgG ELISA. the middle PBMCs layer was collected, washed and frozen until use. plasma samples were assayed at 1:100 and 1:400 dilutions.
