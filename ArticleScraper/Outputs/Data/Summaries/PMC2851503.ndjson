{"summary": "cyt b sequences from 10 bat species were included in this study. genome samples were obtained from 3-mm wing membrane biopsy specimens from wild bats. amplification was conducted at an initial denaturing temperature at 94\u00b0C for 30 s. 34 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 90s. complete mitochondrial cyt b gene (1,140 bp) was amplified. odes of bamboo EF517315 Guangdong, China EF517313 Guangxi, China EF517314 Hong Kong, China Rhinolophus ferrumequinum 49 (5) Caves DQ297575 Yunnan, China DQ351847 Jilin, China R. macrotis 78 (4) Caves EF517309 Guizhou, China EF517310 Yunnan, China DQ297587 Sichuan, China four consecutive Markov chain computations were run for 2 million generations. first 3,000 trees were discarded before generation of consensus tree. the Bayesian consensus tree was rooted to Breda virus (AY427798) phylogeny was performed using mitochondrial cyt b gene to construct maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian phylograms. we used heuristic searches (10 replicates, random addition of taxa, with tree bisection and reconnection branch swapping) trees were sampled every 20 generations, and the first 5,000 trees were discarded before the consensus tree was made. genetic diversity among bats and CoVs We compared the genetic diversity of CoVs isolated from rhinolophids and vespertilionids. cyt b sequences were generated from M. magnater (n = 4), T. pachypus (n = 3), R. macrotis (n = 2), R. sinicus (n = 2), S. kuhlii (n = 1), and Myotis ricketti (n = 1).
