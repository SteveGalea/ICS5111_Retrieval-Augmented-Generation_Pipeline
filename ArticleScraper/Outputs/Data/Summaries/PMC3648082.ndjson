{"summary": "infectious viral particles consist of an icosahedral nucleocapsid made of the core protein and a lipid bilayer embedding the small (S), middle (M) and large (L) envelope proteins. the nucleocapsid surrounds the relaxed circular, partially double-stranded DNA genome. the envelope proteins bear the intriguing property to self-assemble into spherical and filamentous subviral particles (SVP) sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) has been proposed as a functional receptor for HBV and hepatitis D virus (HDV) following cell attachment and endocytosis, virus particles must travel along the endocytic route to reach the replication site. despite recent discoveries, the intracellular trafficking events have remained completely obscure for HBV. the results indicate that transport of viral particles to late endosomes is required for a crucial step of the life cycle. interference with the lysosomal activity by pH neutralization or treatment with protease inhibitors had no effect on infection. expressing tetracycline-inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) specific for Rab5, Rab7, Rab9, and Rab11 depletion Protein Sequence no. all short hairpin oligonucleotide sequences (invitrogen) were cloned into pENTR/H1/TO entry vector (invitrogen) following manufacturer's instructions. tetR cells were transduced with a lentivirus produced from pLenti6-TR plasmid (BLOCK-iT inducible H1 lentiviral RNA interference [RNAi] system; Invitrogen) resistant clones were selected following serial dilution. pLenti4/H1/TO lentivirus containing specific shRNA sequence. clones expressing shRNA specific for Rab5 (HepaRGtetR/shRab5), Rab7 (HepaRGtetR/shRab7), Rab9 (HepaRGtetR/shRab9) and Rab11 (HepaRGtetR/shRab11) were selected by serial d calreticulin expression was visualized using the ECL enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (GE Healthcare) cells were seeded on cover glass and maintained for 3 days in the presence or absence of 1 g/ml Tet. cells were washed three times with PBS, followed by 30-min incubation in complete medium at 37\u00b0C. mouse anti-Lamp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptors (CI-MPRs) were diluted 1:1,000 and 1:250, respectively. cells were washed three times with PBS and further incubated for 30 min with secondary Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat-anti rabbit Abs. a 300-fold-concentrated supernatant of HepG2.2.2.15 cells containing 104 HBV genome equivalents (Geq)/cell was used as viral inoculum. in experiments addressing effect of Rab proteins silencing on HBV life cycle, 1 g/ml Tet was added at day 3 prior to viral inoculation. an equal number of cells were used to extract nucelocapsid viral DNA. the purified DNA was separated on a 1.2% agarose gel. the blot was hybridized with a vacuum transfer blotter. the pellet obtained following centrifugation of cells for 5 min at 2,000 g washed twice with TS buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris-Cl [pH 7.4]) then resuspended in 3 ml TS buffer on ice. samples were homogenized with 40 strokes in a Douncer on ice. cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Euroclone) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 g/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM Glutamax (Gibco) all short hairpin oligonucleotide sequences were cloned into pENTR/H1/TO entry vector (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's instructions.

RESULTS Characterization of HepaRG cell lines with tetracycline-inducible, downregulated Rab5, Rab7, Rab9, or Rab11 expression. the level of Crt, a soluble endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein was also measured as a control. the results suggest that Tet induction was efficient at silencing the expression of each of the Rab proteins considered in this experiment. hTfn was readily internalized in noninduced HepaRGtetR/shRab5 and HepaRGtetR/shRab11 cells. hTfn was readily internalized in noninduced HepaRGtetR/shRab5 and HepaRGtetR/shRab11 cells. the amount of internalized hTfn decreased significantly in HepaRGtetR/shRab5 cells. a fraction of the fluorescent marker accumulating in the vicinity of the plasma membrane resulted in less fluorescent ligand being endocytosed. t-treated samples represented as percentage from control (C). quantitative measurement of the internalized fluorescence by FACS analysis. internalization of LysoTracker Green Dnd-26 was investigated by flow cytometry using the FACS Calibur and the Cell Quest Pro software. the values are the geometric mean fluorescence of Tet-treated samples represented as a percentage (SD) of the control (B) in the absence of Rab9 expression, the latter fraction was more prominent and extended to the cell periphery, consistent with CI-MPR retention within late endosmes. a much tighter juxtanuclear localization became dominant, another effect described following Rab9 depletion (43). a strong inhibition of HBV infection was observed upon induction in both HepaRGtetR/shRab5 and HepaRGtetR/shRab7 cells, of about 70 and 75% respectively. a strong inhibition of HBV infection was observed upon induction in both HepaRGtetR/shRab5 and HepaRGtetR/shRab7 cells. treatment was discontinued at day 3 p.i. infected cells were harvested 14 days p.i. and the amount of encapsidated viral DNA was quantified by real-time PCR. the results are expressed as the percentage of HBV infection from untreated controls. expression of certain shRNA sequences can trigger an interferon response in host cells (44). western blotting was used to monitor the HBV replication in the newly established HepaRG cells. a potent HBV replication inhibitor was also included in the experiment as a control. etR/shRab5 and HepG2.2.2.15tetR/shRab7 cells were treated with 1 g/ml Tet or 10 M 3TC for 3 days or maintained untreated as a control. Western blotting used specific Abs and Crt expression as a loading control (B) fractions 15 to 20 were heavily loaded with the 34-kDa, mature cathepsin D chain characteristic of the lysosomal compartment (46) these results are consistent with the successful separation of the endolysosome heavy fraction from the remaining heterogenous vesicles. in contrast, the major pool of HBV particles is concentrated in the light endosomal vesicles. s were collected from the top of the gradient and analyzed for the distribution of intracellular markers by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (A) the error bars represent the SD between two independent experiments run with triplicate samples (B). it was previously demonstrated that pharmacological agents known to elevate the pH of endosomes and lysosomes have no impact on HBV or DHBV infections when cells are pretreated. encapsidated viral DNA was quantified by real-time PCR. the results are expressed as percentages of HBV infection from untreated controls. a reduction step along the endocytic pathway is required for initiation of a productive infection. the new HepaRG clones were analyzed for the expression of the corresponding Rab proteins, in the absence and presence of the inducer. however, it was unaffected in the remaining cell lines (Fig. 1A and D) shRNA specific for the indicated Rab proteins were either induced with 1 g/ml Tet for 3 days (+) or maintained untreated as a control. depletion of the Rab proteins was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-Rab5 (A), anti-Rab7 (B), anti-Rab9 (C), and anti-Rab11 (D) Abs. hTfn was readily internalized in HepaRGtetR/shRab5 and HepaRGtetR/shRab11 cells. a similar behavior was observed for HepaRGtetR/shRab5 cells. intracellular distribution of Rab5 (A) and Rab11 (B) was evidenced using specific Abs and the Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope following mounting with Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI, to visualize the nuclei (blue) images were taken with the 63 objective and processed with ZEN software. lysosomes were induced with 1 g/ml Tet or left untreated as a control. cells were either induced with 1 g/ml Tet or left untreated. cation-independent (CI)-MPRs colocalize with this compartment, while a fraction is also present in Rab9-positive late endosomes (41). CI-MPRs were concentrated in the perinuclear area, while little staining was observed in punctate vesicles. the consequences of Rab7 and Rab9 or Rab9 or Rab11 depletion on internalization of hTfn and Lysotracker were also investigated. the data show that the Rab proteins were specifically and efficiently downregulated in the newly developed HepaRG cell lines. induction in both HepaRGtetR/shRab5 and HepaRGtetR/shRab7 cells did not have any significant impact on HBV infection. these results suggest that the HBV particles enter the endocytic pathway of the host cell and require trafficking as far as late endosomes/lysosomes to initiate an infectious cycle. neither the recycling compartment nor the endosomal transport to the trans-Golgi network a potential direct influence of Rab5 or Rab7 depletion on HBV replication cannot be excluded. in the first approach, HBV-infected HepaRGtetR/shRab5 and HepaRGtetR/shRab7 cells were treated with Tet during viral replication, between days 7 and 14 p.i.. ab5 and HepaRGtetR/shRab7 cells were infected with 104 HBV Geq/cell and then treated with 1 g/ml Tet. infected cells were harvested 14 days p.i. and the amount of encapsidated viral DNA was quantified by real-time PCR. subcellular fractionation experiment was performed with HepaRG cells at 24 and 48 h p.i. by ultracentrifugation in a 30% Percoll gradient. this type of gradient has been used before to separate endocytic vesicles in two distinct populations. postnuclear fractions were collected from top to bottom and characterized for the presence of different endocytic markers by Western blotting and viral nucleocapsids. differentiated HepaRG cells were infected with104 HBV Geq/cell for 24 h. the viral inoculum was removed by extensive washing with PBS-EDTA. the cells were harvested after incubation for either 24 or 48 h. differentiated cells were infected with 104 HBV Geq/cell. they were then incubated with medium containing 50 nM Baf, 50 mM NH4Cl, 100 M E64d (A) or 400 M BSO (B) the drugs were added either after removal of the HBV inoculum (BSO), or 24 h later (BSO, Baf, NH4Cl, and E64d) NTCP, a liver bile acid transporter, was proposed as a potential receptor for HBV (13). NTCP overexpression in cell lines that are not permissive for HBV infection rendered them susceptible. however, the efficiency of the infection remained intriguingly low. this strongly suggests that plasma membrane receptors are not the only limiting factors of infection. viral particles enter early endosomes that progress to late endosomes. acidification does not appear to be an essential factor for HBV infection. trafficking through endosomes may only represent an intermediate step leading to a cellular organelle where the viral genome is released. the disulfide bond-reducing activity of the endocytic pathway is activated upon internalization of a folate-FRET reporter into endosomes. this activity requires deprotonation of thiols, which is not favored thermodynamically by the acidic environment of the endosome. this suggests that most likely, an enzymatic catalysis is involved. viral particles were found dispersed into a fraction of heterogeneous endocytic vesicles consisting of early and late endosomes. they later were concentrated into lysosomes, suggesting that viral nucleocapsids remain intact in the endocytic pathway for at least several days. this is consistent with the observation made during the first characterization of the HepaRG cell line, showing that the input viral particle level is relatively stable. ative branch appears to be a dead-end pathway, possibly as a part of the cell defense mechanisms to limit the number of viral particles available to initiate productive infection. lysosomal trafficking and accumulation of the viral particles in this compartment are contributing factors to the unusual low efficiency of HBV infection in vitro."}
