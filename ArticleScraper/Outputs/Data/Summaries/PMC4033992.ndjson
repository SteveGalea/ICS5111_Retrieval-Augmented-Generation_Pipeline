{"summary": "cell-penetrating-homing peptides have been harnessed to translocate a wide range of molecules across the cell membranes. this limitation hampers one of the most promising applications of CPPs, their lack of cell specificity. this limitation hampers one of the most promising applications of CPPs. cell-penetrating-homing peptides are usually small (no longer than 25\u201330 amino acids) non-immunogenic molecules and show low cytotoxicity. most of cell-penetrating peptides have been described using in vivo biopanning. integrin v\u00df3 is overexpressed on neoendothelial cells and frequently on tumor cells. RAFT-RGD is a cyclic decapeptide (KKKPGKKKPG) with two orthogonally addressable domains pointing on either side of the cyclopeptide backbone. the tetrameric RAFT-RGD was reported to have a ten-fold higher affinity for its soluble receptor integrin v\u00df3 than the monomeric cRGD. RAFT-RGD was rapidly internalized in small vesicles after 10 minutes. this finding contrasts with the trafficking route followed by the \u00df1 integrin. conjugation of doxorubicin to doxorubicin showed reduced toxicity and improved efficacy against human cancer xenografts in nude mice. this conjugate showed reduced toxicity and improved efficacy against human cancer xenografts compared with free doxorubicin. tTNF-NGR inhibits tumor growth in mice by thrombotic occlusion of tumor vessels without any major side effects. tTNF-NGR inhibits tumor growth in mice by thrombotic occlusion of tumor vessels without any major side effects. tTNF-NGR is a 31 amino acid sequence derived from the nuclear protein high mobility group (HMGN2) [41] a 12-mer peptide is able to translocate selectively across the cell membranes of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) it is non-toxic, non-immunogenic in mice, stable in vivo, and stable in vivo. the authors of that study consider HN-1 as a potential shuttle of drugs into this kind of tumor. penetrating homing peptides \"recognize\" some kind of molecule on the surface of the target cell. pep42 is a cyclic 13-mer oligopeptide that binds to glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and internalizes into cancer cells. pep42 is a promising vector for tumor cell-specific chemotherapy. authors demonstrated that Pep42 specifically recognizes GRP78 present on the cell surface of melanoma me6654/2 cells. after this recognition it is internalized with it. they chose the amphipathic apoptosis-inducing peptide D-(KLAKLAK)2. the other drug chosen was hematoporphyrin, a photosynthesizer. the delivery system induced higher cell death compared to treatment with the drug only. the mitochondrial cytotoxic peptide, D-(KLAKLAK)2, was coupled to the heptapeptide SMSIARL [53], isolated from an in vivo phage display peptide library. this chimeric peptide postponed cancer development, suggesting a potential alternative to the surgical approach used to treat this disease [53] the authors of that study showed an enhanced internalization rate in several tumoral cell lines in vitro compared with the corresponding non tumoral ones. these peptides are not only capable of preferentially internalizing cancer cells, but also exert a toxic effect on them and thereby prevent their proliferation. the homing of LyP-1 peptides is tumor type-specific; it accumulates in some tumors but not in others. treatment of tumor cells with LyP-1 causes cell death. this effect is specific because cells that do not bind LyP-1 are not affected. library on poorly differentiated colon carcinoma cells (HT29) described a peptide, CPIEDRPMC (RPMrel) this peptide has been reported to target colon tumor tissues from four patients without binding healthy colon tissue or other tissues such as lungs, lung sarcoma, liver, liver sarcoma or stomach. the authors report the efficacy of this novel peptide in transporting the mitochondrial toxin D(KLAKLAK)2 to these tumor colon cells the sequences of these peptides are the following: DRG1: SPGARAF; DRG2: DGPWRKM; and DRG3: FGQKASS. these results provide a powerful tool that will facilitate future research into the structural basis of neuronal cellular subpopulations. peptides display a rigid type II polyproline helix backbone functionalized to contain six cationic moieties and two distinctive hydrophobic groups. phage display technology allows the selection of peptides with binding specificity to certain cells. in vivo phage display allows the binding of the peptides in a true physiological environment. cell-penetrating homing peptides are the minimal expression of a targeted drug delivery system. they are powerful non-immunogenic tools to deliver cell-impermeable drugs to cells. but having a strong internalization capacity commonly clashes with high specificity. the ErbB2 gene is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family. it is overexpressed in about 30% of breast cancer. this phenotype has been shown to increase the metastatic potential of human breast cancer. metic which binds to ErbB2 with high affinity rendered the translocation profile of the peptide selective both in vitro and in vivo. this construct (P3-AHNP) efficiently and selectively delivered a STAT3-inhibiting peptide, named STAT3BP, and even inhibited the growth of ErbB2-overexpressing cells in vitro. a well studied CPP derived from the murine sequence of the cell adhesion molecule vascular endothelial cadherin, amino acids 615\u2013632 showed good internalization rates in several cell lines [81]. the combination of these two peptides showed good internalization in several cell lines in vivo [82]. this peptide was detected in tumors but not in control tissue. the combination of targeting peptides with a CPP to help in the translocation across the cellular membrane leads to a simple but efficient drug delivery system. the number of homing peptides, as discussed above, increases yearly. for this purpose, they have worked extensively with phage display peptide libraries for in vivo screening. chimeric peptides were bound to two proven transducible anticancer peptides, a p53-activating peptide (TATp53C'; [89]) and a cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 2 antagonist peptide (TAT-RxL; [90]. a novel cyclic peptide, P15 (CWMSPRHLGTC), abrogates CK2 phosphorylation by TLTYTWS peptide specifically binds to collagen IV modified by matrix metalloproteinase-2, a protease involved in the process of angiogenesis in an in vivo assay in a concentration-dependent manner. it also significantly reduces endothelial differentiation in vitro. combination of this homing capacity with that of CPPs may allow CPPs to be specifically directed to a desired location. p53 is a protein known as the \u201cguardian of the genome\u201d, a transcription factor. it regulates the cell cycle and functions as a tumor suppressor protein. this domain is regulated by its C-terminal sequence. the same chimeric peptide induced rapid apoptosis in human and rat glioma cells. this case in breast cancer cell lines carrying endogenous p53 mutations. the peptide was not toxic to non-malignant breast or colon cells. most solid tumors grow in an environment that differs completely from that of healthy tissues. a tumor is refractory to radiotherapy and anticancer chemotherapy. the expression of HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1) is barely detectable. the ubiquitin-proteasome system is located in the cell cytoplasm. a PTD (protein transduction domain) was required to translocate the fusion protein into the cells. the fusion protein product TOP3 was systemically administered to mice bearing human pancreatic tumor xenografts. a survivin sequence (K79-K90) blocks the interaction between survivin and Hsp90 in vitro. they created sepherdin (K79-L87), a molecule that interacts specifically with Hsp90. they also demonstrated that intracellular delivery of sepherdin induced tumor cell death. this new peptidic drug had the capacity to disrupt two crucial cell survival pathways. sepherdin is considered a potential new specific drug for cancer treatment. diseases involving PrPSc are believed to result from a change in the conformation of a normal protein called cellular prion protein (PrPC), which is present in large amounts in the brain as well as in other tissues. prion protein-derived CPPs comprise the N-terminal signal peptide in mouse and residues 1\u201324 in bovine PrP. these peptides transport hydrophobic cargos across cell membranes in a lipid raft-dependent macropinocytosis mechanism. they worked in vitro using, GT1-1 cells, which are murine neuronal hypothalamic cells. oligonucleotide derivatives have demonstrated remarkable potential for therapeutic application as gene regulators. siRNA delivery is currently the focus of intensive research effort. it can specifically bind (after dicer processing) to mRNA sequences. nucleic acids are strongly negatively charged and thus unable to cross the cell membrane. sethuraman and coworkers designed a delivery system called \"smart micellar nanoplatform\" the system takes advantage of the low pH usually found in the tumor environment. the core of the micelles is composed by poly(L-lactic acid) into which any chemotherapeutic agent can be integrated. the sulfonamide loses charge and detaches, thereby exposing TAT for interaction with the tumoral cells. a decrease of pH in the tumor environment induces the hydrolysis of the hydrazone bond, thereby exposing the CPP, which helps the delivery system to enter the tumoral cells. temperatures above 43 \u00b0C of sufficient duration directly kill cells. the application of mild hyperthermia (40\u201343 \u00b0C) is under clinical development as an adjunct with various established cancer treatments. large amounts of the ELP can be easily purified, and they can be genetically modified to insert cell-penetrating sequences or therapeutic peptides or proteins. applying high temperature to a tumoral mass could theoretically lead to an enhanced concentration of the delivery system in the region, thereby minimizing the side effects. orally administered CsA is highly effective against a wide range of inflammatory skin diseases, such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. this approach facilitated the penetration of CsA into mouse and human skin, the solubility of CsA was enhanced in water and effects of reduced inflammation were observed. in 2003, Heckl and coworkers published a new strategy to visualize prostate cancer using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) their aim was to develop a novel MRI contrast agent with the capacity to accumulate specifically in tumoral cells for relatively long periods [153] the main problem of these strategies is the rapid influx and efflux of the particles. in vitro (HeLa cells) and in vivo (prostate adenocarcinoma) the Gd3+ particles were retained longer than the Gd3+- Antennapedia particles without the c-myc PNA. authors have been cautious in the interpretation of their results and have not directly related the presence of a complementary PNA for a highly expressed protein in the cells. system consists of cationic liposomes carrying pDNA encoding for green fluorescent protein (GFP) modified with TAT CPP. anti-myosin monoclonal antibody 2G4 (mAb 2G4) has demonstrated an excellent capacity to recognize and bind ischemic cells with damaged plasma membranes. this antibody has demonstrated an excellent capacity to recognize and bind ischemic cells with damaged plasma membranes. p38MAP kinases are responsible for activating endothelial cells in these diseases. these cells secrete cytokines and chemokines that further promote leukocyte recruitment and infiltration. the system also includes the cyclic RGDfK peptide known to bind with high affinity and specificity to v\u00df3 integrin. the development of non-viral vehicles represents an easier, less expensive and safer alternative to viral vectors. cell specificity is one of the most important features to be improved in the field of non-viral delivery systems. the lack of specificity is a major issue to be solved before drug delivery. many of the strategies described have proved successful in in vivo experiments. however, topical application of CsA shows low effectiveness. Avi Biopharma is working on clinical development of CPPs for the in vivo steric block splicing correction using 6-aminohexanoic acid spaced oligoarginine [(RXR)4 XB CPP] it consists on a Morpholino oligo conjugated to the mentioned CPP [(RXR)4 XB CPP]"}
