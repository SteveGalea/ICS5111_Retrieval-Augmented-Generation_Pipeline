{"summary": "Bd causes the disease chytridiomycosis, and its effect on amphibians has been described as \u2018the most spectacular loss of vertebrate biodiversity due to disease in recorded history' whole genome sequencing and expression studies have led to new insights into the phylogenetics and functional genomics of Bd. specific Bd traits have been linked to virulence, including zoospore production, zoosporangium size and the ability to inhibit the growth of immune cells. declines are not universal (Pearl et al., 2009), suggesting that there is important variation in the effect of Bd on populations of this host amphibian. one study suggested that juvenile R. cascadae have higher Bd prevalence than other life stages. many affected populations experience repeated recruitment failures in which very few individuals survive their first year after metamorphosis. each animal was swabbed five times along the ventral surface of the trunk. we evaluated the amount of Bd on each swab in terms of zoospore equivalents (ZE) frogs from each site were reared separately in a standardized environment. frogs from each site were exposed to each of the two Bd isolates. frog survivorship and Bd infection intensity were monitored for 14 weeks. values were read daily at 490 nm using a PowerWaveXS microplate reader. to characterize the growth of Bd, we fit logistic growth models to absorbance data. a separate logistic model was fit for replicate cultures of each isolate. jurkat cells were plated at 200 000 per well (1 106 ml1) and zoospores were added at a final concentration of 1 106 per well (5 106 ml1) the cultures were pulsed with 0.5 Ci 3H-thymidine (5 Ci ml1, specific activity 2 Ci mmol1; Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) genomes were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. genome alignment and single nucleotide polymorphism calling were performed as in the study by Rosenblum et al. (2013). between 2008 and 2013 we measured frog abundance using visual encounter surveys. each site was visited multiple times over the course of each season. each animal was swabbed five times along the ventral surface of the trunk. in 2009\u20132011 we tested for differences between the two study sites in infection intensity for animals that tested positive for Bd. we used analysis of variance (ANOVA) and applied the same fixed predictor variables as in the analysis of Bd prevalence. infection intensity in Bd-positive animals was analyzed using a linear mixed model. number of ZEs was log-transformed to meet assumptions of normality. cultures were grown in 96-well plates with 10 wells per isolate. jurkat cells (from an immortalized line of human T lymphocytes) were used as a surrogate for amphibian lymphocytes. sensitivity of human and mouse lymphocytes was also documented. genomes were sequenced using a phenol\u2013chloroform protocol. we inferred phylogenetic relationships among isolates using a parsimony method. we used the sequence divergence test dN/dS to test for adaptive genomic evolution in the Section Line isolate. we scanned for genes with an excess of nonsynonymous (dN) relative to synonymous (dS) substitutions in heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms. positive selection on a gene is indicated if the dN/dS ratio for that gene is >1. our analyses did not uncover statistical associations between life stage and Bd prevalence or infection intensity. we conducted controlled laboratory exposures of 171 field-collected, captive-reared R. cascadae from five source populations. over the course of the experiment 95% of the 56 frogs exposed to Section Line Bd died or had to be killed. the average infection intensity on animals exposed to Section Line Bd increased from 218 to 60 916 ZE between weeks 1 and 2 after exposure. the average infection intensity on animals exposed to Carter Meadow Bd increased from 218 to 60 916 ZE between weeks 1 and 2 after exposure. the section line and Carter Meadow isolates nested within the most recently derived and widely distributed clade\u2014the GPL. the most compelling genomic patterns observed were chromosomal copy number variation and LOH in the section line isolate. supercontigs 2, 3, 7, 8, 11, 12 and 14 showed higher copy numbers in the Section Line isolate than the average of other isolates studied to date. only one of 1336 genes evaluated showed a dN/dS ratio >1 and it was a gene coding for an uncharacterized predicted protein. abundance of juvenile frogs declined by >99% between 2009 and 2012; adult abundance increased steadily between 2008 and 2012. the maximum number of adult and juvenile frogs observed during visual encounter surveys is shown. we conducted controlled laboratory exposures of 171 field-collected, captive-reared R. cascadae from five source populations. 95% of the 56 frogs exposed to Section Line Bd died or had to be killed. frogs from Old Cow Creek experienced higher prevalence than frogs from two of the four other collection sites. frogs from old Cow Creek experienced higher prevalence than frogs from two of the four other collection sites. genomics results are based on 13 696 single nucleotide polymorphisms across 17 supercontigs. we obtained a depth of coverage for aligned reads of 26 in Section line and 3 in Carter Meadow. this isolate has the most interesting virulence phenotype and the most robust genomic coverage. only one of 1336 genes evaluated showed a dN/dS ratio >1. it was a gene coding for an uncharacterized predicted protein. discussion Bd has caused declines and extinctions in amphibians worldwide. this is the first time that optical density at carrying capacity has been linked to virulence. this is the first time that optical density at carrying capacity has been linked to virulence. this is the first time that optical density at carrying capacity has been linked to virulence. 7 and 8, which show unusual copy number variation and LOH patterns in the Section Line isolate, and 12, which is found at a high copy number in the Section Line isolate. a high copy number in the section line isolate contains a high density of protease gene copies that are hypothesized to have a role in Bd pathogenesis. however, we did not find evidence for selection on particular genes-of-interest. a site 18 km from Section Line Lake at a similar elevation has sustained high frog densities in the presence of Bd without experiencing dramatic declines. however, no evidence that frogs from different source populations were more susceptible to Bd than frogs from other sites, suggesting that populations differ in their ability to resist infection. current paper may not represent a rare virulence phenotype. future research should focus on quantifying the relative importance of pathogen virulence, abiotic environmental factors and host density as drivers of Bd-related amphibian declines. abiotic environmental factors and host density have been linked to the in situ evolution of increased virulence. the high-virulence isolate was collected in a region where the host amphibian is widespread. the low-virulence isolate came from a remnant population in a region where dramatic host declines have occurred. this inconsistency highlights the importance of local processes in determining host\u2013pathogen dynamics."}
