{"summary": "hepatitis C virus (HCV) has a high propensity to establish a persistent infection in the human liver. 170 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis C and are at risk to develop cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. current antiviral therapy is based on the use of polyethylene glycol conjugated interferon alpha in combination with ribavirin. viral non-structural proteins like NS5A and NS3 and double stranded viral RNA are also present around LDs [11], [12]. NS5A plays a double role in both replication and assembly processes. NS2 may interact with viral partners involved in virion morphogenesis. a reporter epitope at the N-terminus of NS2 found that NS2 accumulates in dotted structures derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and colocalizes with E1, E2, NS3 and NS5A in close proximity to the core protein and LDs. mutations in other viral proteins reported to inhibit the assembly process abolished viral assembly. predicted TM, consensus transmembrane (TM) segment predictions were deduced from 6 available web-based algorithms prediction methods (DAS, TOPPRED2, TMHMM, SOSUI, TMPRED, PHD-TM) alanine insertion mutant A16 twists the helix by 110\u00b0. the side chains of indicated residues are shown to highlight this distortion. alanine scanning insertion mutagenesis has been shown to disrupt helix-helix interactions in a membrane environment. insertion of a single amino acid into a transmembrane helix displaces the residues on the N-terminal side of the insertion by 110\u00b0 relative to those on the C-terminal side of the insertion. alanine insertions near the center of putative transmembrane helices were expected to be the most efficient to disrupt inter-helices potential interactions. alanine insertions near the center of putative transmembrane helices were expected to be the most efficient to disrupt inter-helices potential interactions. NS2 transmembrane region enables the NS2-E2 interaction. mutants drastically decrease the production of infectious virions. mutants were electroporated with viral RNA transcribed from different mutants. -NS2 in electroporated cells was confirmed by Western blotting. the actin content was also analyzed to verify that equal amounts of cell lysates have been loaded. however, in the absence of p7, the E2-p7 form is absent. core protein in supernatants decreased drastically as compared to wild-type. the release of core was at the same level as the dead mutants. this likely reflects a difference of sensitivity between the two assays. gene and co-immunoprecipitation data suggest that NS2 interacts with E2 [23], [32], [33], [34]. in the absence of p7, E2 migrated slightly faster. this is likely due to the absence of p7, which has a slightly slower migration profile. RR/QQ mutation is believed to abolish the ion channel activity of p7. it induces a drastic decrease in virus production as previously reported. mutations had no significant effect on E2-NS2 interaction. NS2 accumulates in dotted structures. -HA RNA were grown on coverslips and fixed at 48h and 72h post-electroporation. the subcellular localization of HA-NS2 was analyzed by immunofluorescence using an anti-HA antibody. NS2 dots overlapped with other organelle markers of the secretory pathway. NS5A and NS3 were also shown to colocalize with NS2 in its dotted pattern. this is illustrated by the presence of magenta dots (red NS2 and blue NS5A) in the proximity of LDs. core (blue) is tightly associated to LD (green) as the LD becomes cyan due to colocalization. at different time points post-electroporation, the virus infectivity was determined by titration of foci forming units (FFUs) at different time points post-electroporation, the virus infectivity present in the supernatants was determined by titration of foci forming units (upper panel). Error bars indicate SE from at least two independent experiments performed in duplicate. a low number of cells contained NS2-positive structures with a different pattern of subcellular localization. this pattern was observed in approximately 1 to 3% of the cells at 72h post-infection or post-electroporation. these structures colocalized less with ER markers and overlapped with ERGIC-53, a marker of the ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment [36]. however, these NS2 dots were detected in close proximity to the ER exit sites a virus that does not contain the mutations paralleled the NS2/NS5A dots formation with a significant correlation coefficient. this data reinforce the idea that NS2/NS5A positive dots are involved in the virus production process. to further investigate the NS2 localization, we performed immuno-electron microscopy with an anti-HA antibody. alanine insertion mutants showed NS2 dotted structures as wild-type. a41 mutation induced a drastic decrease in the percentage of cells with NS2 dots. NS2 transmembrane region is an important localization determinant. cells showing at least 3 NS2/NS5A dots were considered positive for NS2 dotted structures. the results were expressed as percentage of total counted cells. at least 250 infected cells were counted. dotted structures increased tremendously in comparison to the wild-type. PP mutation induces a block in the assembly process, which favors the accumulation of NS2 protein in the dotted structures. Huh-7 cells were electroporated with viral RNA transcribed from a mutant. at 72h post-electroporation, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitation was performed with an anti-HA antibody. the immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody. mutant cells electroporated with JFH-HA RNA or mutant genomes were grown on coverslips and fixed at 72h post-electroporation. the subcellular localization of HA-NS2 was analyzed by immunofluorescence using anti-HA (red) and anti-NS5A (green) antibodies. the nuclei were stained with DAPI. the deletion introduced in the envelope region is predicted to generate a chimeric protein comprising the N-terminus of E1 and the C-terminus of E2 protein. the deletion introduced in the envelope region is predicted to generate a chimeric protein comprising the N-terminus of E1 and the C-terminus of E2 protein. the two mutants induced a drastic decrease in the number of cells presenting NS2/NS5A dotted structures. together, these data indicate that NS2 needs a functional p7 polypeptide to colocalize with NS5A in dotted structures. this suggests that NS2-E2 interaction might be crucial for NS2 subcellular localization. if FMDV 2A protease had not been functional, we would have observed a difference of 7kD corresponding to the molecular mass of unprocessed p7. in contrast to the wild-type envelope protein, the truncated E2 did not interact with NS2. p7-NS2 interacts with p7 in a co-immunoprecipitation assay. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing p7-Flag, HA-NS2 from different genotypes, HA-NS2 mutants or control plasmids. at 24h post-transfection cells were lysed and immunoprecipitations with an anti-HA antibody were performed. the presence of p7-NS2 in transfected cells was confirmed by Western blotting. in NS2-GFP, the cytosolic domain of NS2 was replaced by GFP protein. for NS2-GTM, we replaced the transmembrane domain of NS2 by the transmembrane domain of glycoprotein G of VSV. the transmembrane region is the main determinant of p7-NS2 interaction. plasmids were transfected with plasmids expressing CFP-p7, YFP-NS2 or CFP-EYF. at 24h post-transfection, cells were lysed and protein expression was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. samples were subjected to FLIM and color coded maps were obtained. the mean life time decreased from 2.560.03 ns (n = 14) in cells transfected with the donor only (CFP-p7) to 2.340.09 ns (n = 10) for double transfections (CFP-p7+YFP-NS2) as a positive control, we used the transmembrane domains of HCV glycoproteins E1 and E2 which are known to interact and to have the same subcellular localization as p7 and NS2 FP-E2+YFP-E1 2.59+/0.08* CFP-EYF+YFP-NS2 2.59+/0.06 *p0.005. NS5A stabilizes NS2 dotted structures. NS5A is recruited through direct interaction by the core protein around LDs. the results fitted the literature with JFH-S/A-HA virus infectivity moderately reduced at 72h and JFH-3BS/A-HA profoundly impaired in infectious virus production. the replication and protein integrity were unaltered (Figure 9A, B, C). alignments of NS2 membrane domain sequences from HCV strains JFH1 and Con1. struct., secondary structure deduced from the NMR analyses of NS2 synthetic peptides from Con1 strain [19]. alanine scanning insertion mutagenesis has been shown to disrupt helix-helix interactions in a membrane environment. insertion of a single amino acid into a transmembrane helix displaces the residues on the N-terminal side of the insertion by 110\u00b0 relative to those on the C-terminal side of the insertion. the subsequent perturbation of the residue side-chain distribution could disrupt a potential helix-helix packing interface. three different mutants were designed by inserting alanine residues close to the middle of the transmembrane segments of NS2. the positions for alanine insertions were carefully chosen within the putative helical segments to preserve the overall fold of the corresponding helices. we wanted to evaluate the impact of our mutations on the viral life cycle. deletion of first two transmembrane segments prevented the production of infectious particles similar to the negative controls. mutants A16 and A41 showed residual infectivity, but A82 was not able to produce infectious particles. mutants A16 and A41 were electroporated with viral RNA transcribed from different mutants. cells were electroporated with viral RNA transcribed from different mutants. at 72h post-electroporation, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitation was performed with an anti-HA antibody. the presence of E2 and HA-NS2 in electroporated cells was confirmed by Western blotting. the level of expression of HCV proteins was higher for the JFH-HA control in this particular experiment. therefore, we measured the NS2/E2 ratios which were similar for A16, A41 and JFH-HA. to test whether the lack of infectivity could be due to a defect in virus secretion. mutations in the transmembrane domain of NS2 prevent assembly process. alanine insertions in the transmembrane region had different effects. alanine insertions in the transmembrane region had different effects. TM2) induced a consistent decrease in the amount of E2 co-precipitated by NS2. to this aim, we used two mutants of p7, a deletion mutant (JFH-p7-HA) and a mutant having the two arginine residues in the cytosolic loop of p7 replaced by glutamine residues (JFH-RR/QQ-HA) this mutation is believed to abolish the ion channel activity of p7 3415% of infected cells from 8 different electroporations displayed NS2 dots. the size of these structures was 0.840.38 m (meanSD, n = 402). NS2 accumulates in dotted structures. NS2 dots overlapped with HCV envelope glycoproteins E2 and E1. NS5A and NS3 were also shown to colocalize with NS2 in its dotted pattern. this is illustrated by the presence of magenta dots (red NS2 and blue NS5A) in the proximity of LDs. individual confocal images of each labeling are shown in left panels. two by two overlays are shown in right panels. a view of the entire cell is shown in the top right panel. two clusters of gold particles (white arrows) are lying on well-preserved ER bilayers. a third cluster of gold particles (black arrow) is observed on a less preserved ER bilayer. it has to be pointed out that a low number of cells contained NS2-positive structures with a different pattern of subcellular localization. this different pattern was indeed observed in approximately 1 to 3% of the cells at 72h post-infection or post-electropor the kinetics of virion production and the percentage of cells presenting NS2/NS5A positive dots showed a high correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.9. to exclude the possibility that the NS2 phenotype depends on the cell culture adaptive mutations, we performed a similar experiment with a virus that does not contain the mutations. this data reinforce the idea that NS2/NS5A positive dots are involved in the virus production process. NS2 localized in confined structures which did not colocalize with NS5A. there was no colocalization between the truncated NS2 and the E2 glycoprotein (Figure 5B) the subcellular localization of NS2 for the alanine insertion mutants was analyzed. mutants in NS2 transmembrane region drastically decrease the number of cells presenting NS2 dotted structures. cells showing at least 3 NS2/NS5A dots were considered positive for NS2 dotted structures. at least 250 infected cells were counted. NS2 dotted structures were not found in the vicinity of LDs in the context of the PP mutation. PP mutation induces a block in the assembly process, which favors the accumulation of NS2 protein in the dotted structures. cells showing at least 3 NS2/NS5A dots were considered positive for NS2 dotted structures. results were expressed as percentage of total counted cells. at least 220 cells were counted. the presence of core and NS5A was confirmed by Western blotting. mutants electroporated with JFH-HA RNA or mutant genomes were grown on coverslips and fixed at 72 h post-electroporation. mutants were labeled with anti-HA and anti-NS5A antibodies. a deletion in the envelope region would therefore block the assembly process. in the context of our JFH-HA virus, this deletion mutant is also fully replicative. in this context, NS2 localized in NS5A positive structures juxtaposed to the LDs and core protein. a complete deletion (JFH-p7-HA) or an amino acid substitution (JFH-RR/QQ-HA) previously reported to affect the assembly and release of the virus [32], [35]. the two constructs behaved as expected. if FMDV 2A protease had not been functional, we would have observed a difference of 7kD corresponding to the molecular mass of unprocessed p7. in contrast to the wild-type envelope protein, the truncated E2 did not interact with NS2. p7-NS2 interacts with p7 in a co-immunoprecipitation assay. NS2 and p7 interact in a co-immunoprecipitation assay. NS2-GFP corresponds to the transmembrane domain of NS2 in fusion with GFP. NS2-GTM corresponds to the transmembrane domain of VSV-G protein in fusion with cytosolic domain of NS2. p7 interacts with NS2 in a genotype independent manner. the system is not sensitive enough to discriminate between slight changes in affinities. p7 interacts with NS2 in a fluorescence resonance energy transfer. U2OS cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing CFP-p7 and YFP-NS2. at 24h post-transfection, cells were lysed and protein expression was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. the mean life time of fluorescence decreased from 2.690.12 ns (n = 10) in cells transfected with the donor only (CFP-p7) to 2.340.09 ns (n = 10) for double transfections (CFP-p7+YFP-NS2) as a positive control, we used the transmembrane domains of HCV glycoproteins E1 and E2 which are known to interact and to have the same subcellular localization as p7 NS5A is recruited through direct interaction by the core protein around LDs where its domain III is involved in the assembly process potentially by its phosphorylation [14], [16], [17]. NS5A is recruited through direct interaction by the core protein around LDs where its domain III is involved in the assembly process. chimeric virus consisting of the structural proteins of J6 strain up to NS2 protein. we analyzed the phenotype of the mutants as well as the polyprotein processing. mutants present less hyperphosphorylated NS5A (Figure 9C) 7 polypeptides, NS2, NS3, NS4B, NS5A were reported to be involved in viral assembly [14], [17], [20], [22], [32], [48]. however, the mechanism of the complex interplay between the structural and non-structural proteins towards the virion production is not understood. in this paper, we provide evidence for molecular interactions between NS2 and p7 respectively. the transmembrane domain of NS2 (NS2TM) would be the main region available for interactions with the upstream transmembrane proteins p7 and E1E2. p7, the transmembrane domain of NS2 and the transmembrane domain of E2 contain signals which act synergistically to direct the NS2 protein towards the NS5A positive membranes. mutations in the first two transmembrane helices suggest a drastic alteration of NS2 structure by this mutation. this suggests a drastic alteration in NS2 function that can be linked to local alteration of its structure. a weak E2-NS2 interaction as seen for A41 is not able to direct the p7-NS2 unit to the LDs. the formation of NS2 dotted structures is not due to a non-specific effect of the viral genome replication. mutations in core (JFH-HA-PP) or in the envelope proteins (JFH-E1E2-HA) induced an obvious increase in the number of cells presenting NS2 dots. this could mean that the p7-NS2-E1E2 complexes pre-exist in the NS5A positive subcompartment. if serine 457 is replaced, the virus titers are moderately reduced at 72h. mutations may prevent the arrival of dots components to NS5A structures. changes in the phosphorylation state of NS5A could regulate virion production efficacy. NS5A switches from replication to assembly mode by phosphorylation. NS2 emerges as an essential mediator between structural and non-structural proteins in HCV assembly process. anti-capsid ACAP27 [58] and anti-NS3 (486D39) Mabs were kindly provided by JF Delagneau (Bio-Rad, France) the anti-NS5A Mab 9E10 [8] and polyclonal antibody were kindly provided by CM Rice (Rockefeller University, NY, USA) the following plasmids were assembled for FRET-FLIM analyses in the background of pCMV plasmid (Addgene) pCMV/YFP-E1TM, pCMV/CFP-E2TM, pCMV/CFP-p7, pCMV/CFP-EYF, pCMV/YFP-NS2. for these constructs, the plasmids encoding YFP and CFP were p7-Flag, pTriex/EYF-Flag, pCI/HA-NS2, pCI/HA-NS2-GFP and pCI/HA-NS2-GTM are in fusion with the Flag epitope. HA-NS2 has a HA epitope fused to the N-terminus of NS2. in HA-NS2-GFP, the cytosolic domain of NS2 was replaced by GFP protein the JFH-p7-HA keeps the first 2 amino acids of p7 followed by the HA tag sequence and the SGG linker at the N-terminus of NS2. the JFH-E1E2-Luc plasmid has been described previously [31]. it contains an in-frame deletion of amino acids 217\u2013567. a similar strategy was used for the construction of JFH-E1E2TME2-HA using as a backbone plasmid the JFH-RR/QQ-HA. the primers and enzymes used for the constructs are presented in Table S1. the time correlated single photon Counting FLIM system (TCSPC) was used. a dedicated photo-counting and timing electronic card (SPC 830 TCSPC card, Becker and Hickl) was coupled to the internal FLIM detector. the decay curve was directly used to determine the donor's lifetime. cell pellets were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) lysis buffer. lysates were incubated with anti-HA antibodies (HA11) or Sepharose beads covalently bound to HA11 antibody (Covance) overnight at 4h. immunocomplexes were pulled down with 50 l of Protein G and washed three times with lysis buffer.
