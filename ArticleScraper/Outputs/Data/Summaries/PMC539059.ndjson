{"summary": "the viral replicase is translated directly from the genomic sense-strand RNA. it then creates a full-length complementary (minus-sense strand) copy of the genomic RNA. these 3\u2032 UTRs share with the genomic SARS RNA a 32-nucleotide element. the s2m element is the most highly conserved RNA element within the coronaviruses and astroviruses that contain it. nucleotide bases except U(25), U(30), and U(48) are shown as long-range contacts. diagram is designed to approximate the representation of the fold. the s2m RNA secondary structure is shown in yellow and purple. the backbone fold of the s2m RNA mimics that of the 530 loop of 16S rRNA. the ribosomal RNA 530 loop and the proteins that bind to it are involved in translational initiation. we propose that the role of the s2m in SARS may also involve translation initiation. we solved the crystal structure to 2.7- resolution using a single platinum isomorphous/anomalous derivative and obtained a readily interpretable electron density map. the electron density enabled us to fit the s2m RNA sequence unambiguously to the map. the initial map was virtually indistinguishable from the final 3Fo\u20132Fc map calculated using phases from the refined RNA structure. 0.0 were used for model refinement and electron density map calculations Table 2. data for which isomorphous differences were greater than five times the root mean square isomorphous difference, or for which anomalous differences were greater than 3.5 times the root mean square anomalous differences were excluded from the initial phase estimation only. the 90\u00b0 kink thus formed is facilitated by a sharp bend in the backbone involving unpaired residues 29 and 30. the unusual pairing between A(17) and G(34) facilitates formation of a long-range tertiary contact between A(33) of the three-purine asymmetric bulge and G(11) and A(12) of the seven-nucleotide asymmetric bubble. the base of U(25) is disordered in the structure, and little side-chain density is apparent in an otherwise well-defined electron density map. phylogenetic comparisons shown in Figure 1A reveal that the pentaloop sequence is highly conserved. RNA sequences required to preserve these G\u2013C pair interactions are present in all but one of the viral sequences analyzed (avian nephritis virus) asymmetric bulge in the s2m element of SARS is absolutely conserved in SARS. A(17) pairs with G(34), involving the Watson\u2013Crick base-pairing faces of both purines. this mode of interaction is rather distinct from the more usual \u201csheared\u201d G\u2013A pairings involving the Hoogsteen faces of both purines. A(33) forms long-range tertiary interactions with G(11) and A(12) by hydrogen bonding to the N3 of G(11) and the ribose of A(12) substitutions at position 12 are thus tolerated, as is a single instance of purine substitution at position 11. these interactions superficially resemble those observed in domain IV of 4.5S RNA of the signal recognition particle [17,18]. s2m, we performed chemical modification experiments. the results are consistent with the crystal structure. tertiary structural interactions observed in the crystal structure also occur in solution. -p-toluene sulfonate (CMCT; magenta spheres in Figure 4B; data not shown) as are the non-conserved 3\u2032-terminal uridines. the crystal is not well ordered in the crystal but which we expect is also solvent-exposed. we analyzed 38 sequenced SARS variants and found that the motif is absolutely conserved within all of them. no insertions or deletions appear to be tolerated, indicating that this region forms a highly conserved RNA tertiary structure. the [Mg(H2O)5]2+ complex ions, depicted as white octahedra, bind to the pro-R and pro-S phosphate oxygen atoms of A(12) an extensive network of potential hydrogen bonds between the metal-coordinated water molecules and the RNA is shown as yellow dotted lines. tiary interactions, are represented in green, red, and yellow. the actual three-dimensional fold of the RNA is illustrated in Figure 1C. Figure 2A shows a stereo diagram in which all non-hydrogen atoms are present. s2m SARS RNA consists of two regions that are defined by two perpendicular RNA helix axes. the larger region contains several non-helical motifs involved in long-range tertiary contacts. the smaller region forms a stem-loop structure in which a pentaloop (residues 22\u201326) is structured similar to a conventional GNRA tetraloop motif but has an extra residue (U[25] bulge the RNA sequences required to preserve these G\u2013C pair interactions are present in all but one of the viral sequences analyzed (avian nephritis virus) all previously characterized RNA base quartets are purine tetrads [9,10,11,11,12,13,14,15] and do not occur within double-helical structures; the G\u2013C quartet thus appears to be another novel structural feature present within the s2m element of SARS and related viruses the remaining non-canonically base-paired region of secondary structure contains mostly conserved nucleotides. the remaining non-canonically base-paired region of secondary structure contains mostly conserved nucleotides including an absolutely conserved pair between C(10) and A(40) and a Watson\u2013Crick pair within an otherwise highly distorted helical region. the tunnel forms a binding site for two [Mg(H2O)6]2+ ions in the native structure. the tunnel is also the binding site for cis-[(NH3)2Cl2Pt(IV)]2+ and [Ru(NH3)6]3+ metal complexes that were introduced for heavy atom isomorphous replacement phasing. these highly structured and rigorously conserved features allow us to suggest that SARS pathogenesis might be inhibited tertiary structural interaction observed in crystals of s2m RNA is likely to be quite similar to what occurs in solution. G(11) is the only G residue of the s2m RNA detectably modified by kethoxal. the orange sphere represents reaction with kethoxal at the N1 position of G(11), and magenta spheres represent CMCT reactions with uridines. s2m RNA crystal structure has a symmetry mate, G(11)\u2032. s2m RNA is the most disordered residue in the structure and has the highest temperature factor. the structure is compelling prima facie evidence for its biological importance in coronaviruses and astroviruses. s2m RNA structure is sufficiently large, and apparently contains enough stabilizing secondary and tertiary interactions, to offset any energetic advantage that might come from crystallizing as a duplex. at least three inter-molecular contacts are required to form a crystal. the most extensive contact is the base of residue G(11); it stacks upon that of its 2-fold symmetry mate. the s2m RNA crystal structure is likely to be a close representation of the structure that forms in solution and in the context of the SARS virus RNA genome. the s2m element is found only in astroviruses and coronaviruses; no homologs are immediately apparent. phosphodiester backbone fold accompanying the 90\u00b0 kink in s2m RNA mimics that found in the 530 stem-loop of 16S ribosomal RNA. the latter binds to the S12 protein found at the interface between the small and large ribosomal subunits. the 530 stem-loop, and the S12 protein that bind to it, have been implicated in EF\u2013G-independent ribosomal translocation aryotic proteins whose structures resemble S12 or the OB folds typical of these ribosomal proteins. eIF-1 (magenta) and S12 protein (blue) that bind to the 16S rRNA 530 loop (now hidden) are shown relative to the same stem-loop folds. nsp9 reveals it to be a variant of the OB fold, a protein structural motif not previously recognized to be involved in viral replication. the authors demonstrate nonspecific single-strand RNA binding affinity for nsp9, by virtue of its OB fold, may bind specifically to s2m in a manner similar to that illustrated in Figure 5B. s2m RNA sequence we crystallized was originally identified from the genomic sense strand within a rigorously conserved region of the 3\u2032 UTR of the RNA. however, it is formally possible that the conserved sequence corresponds to a conserved structure at the 5\u2032 end of the anti-sense RNA. the variant of the energetically stable and rather common GNRA loop structure (GAGUA) would have to be replaced with an energetically unstable and rare CUCAU loop. crystal packing interactions may potentially distort RNA structures. the s2m RNA structure is sufficiently large, and apparently contains enough stabilizing secondary and tertiary interactions. at least three inter-molecular contacts are required to form a crystal. the rest of the structure appears to be rather rigid and well defined, including the three-purine asymmetric bulge and the seven-nucleotide asymmetric bubble. the phosphate backbone atoms of these non-Watson\u2013Crick regions are among the most ordered in the structure. the crystal structure of s2m is likely to be a close representation of the structure that forms in solution and in context of the SARS virus RNA genome. the phosphodiester backbone fold accompanying the 90\u00b0 kink in s2m RNA mimics that found in the 530 stem-loop of 16S ribosomal RNA [19]. the latter binds to the S12 protein found at the interface between the small and large ribosomal subunits. the 530 stem-loop, and the S12 protein that bind to it, have been implicated in EF\u2013G-independent ribo eIF-1 (magenta) and S12 protein (blue) that bind to the 16S rRNA 530 loop are shown relative to the same s2m RNA superposition. eIF-1 (magenta) and eIF-1 (blue) that bind to the 16S rRNA 530 loop (now hidden) are shown relative to the same s2m RNA superposition. nsp9 reveals it to be a variant of the OB fold, a protein structural motif not previously recognized to be involved in viral replication. the authors demonstrate nonspecific single-strand RNA binding affinity for nsp9, by virtue of its OB fold, may bind specifically to s2m in a manner similar to that illustrated in Figure 5B. s2m structure is unique to coronaviruses and astroviruses. it is likely that in the context of the virus, this invariant feature of the s2m structure is involved in binding interactions with highly conserved proteins. it is reasonable to propose that by designing a drug that specifically targets this structural feature and binds tightly to it. the native and platinum derivative data were processed using CCP4's MOSFLM. a single platinum heavy atom site was found in both isomorphous- and anomalous-differences Patterson-map Harker sections calculated using data from 10- to 5- resolution. phase calculation, solvent flattening, phase extension, and annealing refinement were carried out within CNS version 1.1 [34] crystals containing s2m for solution structure analysis were prepared using plasmid templates cleaved downstream. the s2m element was present at the 5\u2032 end of the transcript and contained an RNA tail consisting of plasmid sequences. crystals of a 48-nucleotide RNA transcript containing the conserved s2m RNA element were obtained via hanging-drop vapor diffusion. a single platinum heavy atom site was found in both isomorphous- and anomalous-differences Patterson-map Harker sections calculated using data from 10- to 5- resolution. the initial SIRAS map was uninterruptible in spacegroup P6122 but was unambiguous in P6522. the actual nucleotide-sequence register was then confirmed by inspecting the electron density, and residues 1\u201347 were built in using O [35]. crystals of a 48-nucleotide RNA transcript containing the

47-nucleotide poly-C model was built into the IRAS map using O. the actual nucleotide-sequence register was then confirmed by inspecting the electron density. residues 1\u201347 were built in using O.
