{"summary": "macrophages are categorized as classically (M1) or alternatively (M2) activated based on surface markers and functional role (12, 13). macrophages can sustain viral replication, disseminate virus, and serve as a viral reservoir post-infection (5\u20137) some studies have shown impaired phagocytosis of opportunistic pathogens by AM (22\u201326); others have reported no change in AM phagocytic activity during infection (27, 28). such variations may result from differences in length of infection or reliance on the use of monocyte derived macrophages. rhesus macaques used in this study were housed in the NCI Animal Facility. the facility is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. 19 macaques were challenged weekly intravaginally using a repeated low-dose of SIVmac251. reagents were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-EPCAM (N3C3) and CD2+ microbeads for non-human primate. depletion was performed using MACS cell separation technology. cells were stimulated for 6 h in 500 l R-10 media. bead-gp120 mixture was brought to a final 50-fold dilution in R-10 media. 50 l was added to the cells and incubated for 3 h at 37\u00b0C. bead uptake was assessed using a flow cytometer. fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal Abs (except where specified otherwise) known to cross-react with Rhesus macaque antigens were used in this study. rat monoclonal Abs (except where specified otherwise) were used for surface staining. x488 anti-IL-10 (JES3-97D), BV605 anti-TNF- (Mab11) were used to exclude dead cells. surface antibodies were added to cells and incubated for 25 min at room temperature. cells were then washed with PBS prior to resuspending in BD Cytofix/CytopermTM and incubating for 15 min at RT. Purified rhesus IgG was used to generate a standard curve for total IgG. plates were washed 5 times with 1X wash solution (KPL) horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-monkey IgG (50 l at a 1:10,000 dilution; Alpha Diagnostics) was added. thirty macaques were used as nave controls and 19 macaques were challenged weekly intravaginally using a repeated low-dose of SIVmac251 (800 TCID50) infection was confirmed for 14 of the macaques with plasma viral loads of 50 SIV RNA copies/ml as assessed by droplet digital PCR. rabbit polyclonal anti-EPCAM (N3C3) (GeneTex, Irvine, CA); CD2 and CD20 MicroBeads for non-human primate (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) cells were stimulated for 6 h in 500 l R-10 media (RPMI + 10% FBS + 5% Pen-Strep + 5% Anti-Anti) autologous bead-gp120 mixture was brought to a final 50-fold dilution. 50 l was added to the cells and incubated for 3 h at 37\u00b0C. bead uptake was assessed using a LSRII flow cytometer. antibodies used for surface staining: BV711 anti-CD4 (L200), BV786 anti-CD45 (D058-1283), BUV395 anti-CD3 (SP34-2), BUV496 anti-CD16 (3G8), BV711 anti-CD32 (FLI8.26/8.26), BUV737 anti-CD64 (10.1), BUV805 anti-CD14 (M5E2), BV605 anti-CD86 (B7.2 the blue LIVE/DEADTM viability dye was used to exclude dead cells. surface antibodies were added to cells and incubated for 25 min at room temperature. cells were then washed with PBS prior to resuspending in BD Cytofix/CytopermTM and incubating for 15 min at RT. purified rhesus IgG (Non-Human Primate Reagent Resource) was used to generate a standard curve for total IgG. plates were washed 5 times with 1X wash solution (KPL) horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-monkey IgG (50 l at a 1:10,000 dilution; Alpha Diagnostics) was added. the mean frequency of AMs was >80% of leukocytes found in the lavage samples. expression of CD11c and CD14 has been shown to identify AM phenotypes with changes in expression occurring during the fibrotic stage of lung disease. expression of CD11c and CD14 has been shown to identify AM phenotypes. proinflammatory Cytokine and Chemokine expression by AM Peaks at the Acute Phase of SIV Infection Macrophages secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to HIV infection. however, a clear dynamic of the cytokine and chemokine response by macrophages over the course of HIV/SIV infection has not been shown. AMs play an important role in maintaining an anti-inflammatory environment in the lung. IL-10 expressing AMs were detected in nave animals and the frequency of IL-10+ cells was significantly higher compared to that of acutely infected animals. BAL cells from 5 macaques at nave or acute and chronic infection stages were incubated with native gp120 from R5 tropic SIV or LPS for 6 h. both gp120 and LPS induced comparable levels of MIP-1 and IL-6 in AMs from naive and acutely-infected animals. BAL samples from 5 nave animals and 5 SIV-infected macaques sampled between 2 and 20-wpi. enriched cells were incubated with SIVmac251 gp120-coated fluorescent beads. activity decreased significantly at 12 and 20-wpi time points compared to acute and nave time points. AMs from nave macaques or sampled over the course of SIV infection were incubated with antigen-coated beads along with autologous BAL-F. phagocytic scores were normalized against the score obtained using nave BAL-F. infected MDMs have shown compromised expression of the signaling chain of FcRIIIa, possibly leading to altered phagocytic activity. however, thus far no correlation has been found between ADP and HIV/SIV viral load, CD4 count or FcR expression. cRIII+ cells were 30% in nave macaques. low frequency of FcRIII+ AMs was maintained until 20-wpi. expression levels were significantly reduced at 8 and 20-wpi time points. the frequency of PD-1+ AMs was assessed from a total of 19 acutely infected macaques. the PD-1+ AM frequency at 20-wpi was significantly different from both nave and 2-wpi time points. the percentage of PD-1+ AMs correlated positively with viral load at 20-wpi. PD-1 expression was analyzed on AMs taken from 6 nave macaques or at 2, 12, and 20 wpi. a more restricted expression pattern has been documented for PD-L2. AMs from nave macaques predominantly expressed high levels of PD-L2. this expression decreased modestly, but not significantly, after SIV infection. AM phagocytosis examined the phagocytic activity of AMs from 7 chronically infected macaques in the presence of PD-1 blocking antibody or mouse IgG as control. PD-1 expression is likely mechanistically linked to impairment of phagocytic activity. expression of CD11c and CD14 has been shown to identify AM phenotypes with changes in expression occurring during the fibrotic stage of lung disease. expression of CD11c and CD14 has been shown to identify AM phenotypes with changes in expression occurring during the fibrotic stage of lung disease. cytokine levels in AM collected from rhesus macaques between 2 and 20-wpi. expression of TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1 in AMs was significantly increased by 2-wpi. expression decreased to levels comparable to nave samples by 4-wpi and remained low until the 20-wpi time point. IL-10 expressing AMs were detected in nave animals. the frequency of IL-10+ cells was significantly higher compared to that of acutely infected animals. the low proinflammatory cytokine response in chronic infection was not associated with an increase in AM-expressing AMs. both gp120 and LPS induced comparable levels of MIP-1 and IL-6 in AMs from naive and acutely-infected animals. however, in chronically infected macaques gp120 did not induce intracellular IL-6 or MIP-1 expression in AMs. enriched cells were incubated with SIVmac251 gp120-coated fluorescent beads. at 8-wpi, phagocytosis decreased and was comparable to nave cells. activity further decreased at 12 and 20-wpi time points compared to acute and nave time points. specific IgG was detected at 8-wpi with levels maintained or continuing to rise until 20-wpi. phagocytic scores were detected at 12-wpi compared to nave and 4-wpi time points. fcRIII occurs in two isoforms: FcRIIIa (expressed mainly on NK cells and macrophages) and FcRIIIb (expressed on neutrophils) infected MDMs have shown compromised expression of the signaling chain of FcRIIIa, possibly leading to altered phagocytic activity (46). a similar increase in AM FcRIII MFI was not observed in the acute phase of infection compared to nave animals. expression levels were significantly reduced at the 8 and 20-wpi time points compared to levels at 2-wpi. data in (A\u2013F) are represented as mean SEM. differences were determined using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons test. surface expression of PD-1 is increased in chronically SIV-infected rhesus macaques. PD-1 expression was analyzed on AMs taken from 6 nave macaques or at 2, 12, and 20 wpi. AMs from nave macaques expressed high levels of PD-L2. this expression decreased modestly, but not significantly, after SIV infection. PD-L1 expression significantly decreased over the course of SIV infection. PD-1 expression is likely mechanistically linked to impairment of phagocytic activity. we further assessed cytokine expression of PD-1 expressing AMs. PD-1 expression on AMs during SIV infection may be a marker of dysfunction. a higher percentage of lymphocytes in BAL of HIV-infected patients has been reported (57). estimating actual AM numbers by multiplying cell count with percentage of AMs did not result in significant differences. phenotypic comparisons of AMs from the BAL of HIV-infected individuals also have not shown differences. the -Chemokines MIP-1, MIP-1, and RANTES can bind to the HIV-1 co-receptor CCR5. any protective effect of -chemokines expressed by AMs is likely limited to the acute phase of infection. lowering of cytokine and chemokine responses after the acute phase of infection was not associated with increased IL-10 expression. AMs readily internalized antigen coated beads during acute infection. this ability markedly decreased in chronically infected animals. initial phagocytic activity was non-specific, as no gp120-specific antibody was present. decreased ADP activity was seen later in chronic infection. prolonged HIV infection may lead to diminished expression of FcRIII. a correlative trend between frequency of FcRIII+ AMs and ADP was observed. PD-1 expression on macrophages has been linked to diminished ability to clear microbial invasion in septic mice. PD-1 expression was only associated with SIV infection. no direct evidence has implicated PD-1 in AM dysfunction. PD-1 ligands were found to be expressed on AMs from nave macaques. tumor microenvironment and in active tuberculosis (78, 83) blockade of PD-1 could significantly improve phagocytic activity further highlighting PD-1 as a factor playing a role in dysfunction of AMs. PD-1 is likely a factor in any inhibitory role exerted on AMs through the PD-1/PD-L pathway. conflict of interest Statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
