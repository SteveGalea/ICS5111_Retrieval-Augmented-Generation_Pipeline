{"summary": "synthetic biology may be best described as engineering-related approach to rationally design and construct biological compounds, functions and organisms not found in nature. it integrates different scientific disciplines, including molecular and systems biology, chemistry, (bio-)physics, computer-aided modeling and design. synthetic biology work may be characterized as involving the combination of multiple genes, newly constructed \u201cbiological parts\u201d or the use of non-natural molecules to enhance traits. synthetic biology aims to engineer complex biological features and to effectively integrate them into organisms as well as to construct entire, new organisms. the field may increasingly integrate, require and converge with synthetic genomics [10-12] synthetic genomics techniques have been used to reconstruct viruses including polio virus or the virus of the 1918 influenza pandemic [14, 15], to introduce genome-wide changes for designing vaccine candidates from the poliovirus and influenza viruses [12, 16], or to generate a first bacterial (Mycoplasma) cell controlled by a chemically synthesized genome upon transplantation into a related recipient cell [11]. societal benefits derived from synthetic genomics/biology applications such as novel drugs and vaccines or \u201c synthetic attenuated virus engineering (SAVE) adapted/reprinted with permission of Macmillan Publishers Ltd. a synthetic virus containing the three deoptimized genes (PR83F) can be safely used to immunize mice. bacterial and viral proteins have been developed that allow to screen potential drugs for tuberculosis [27] or HIV infection [28] in a mammalian cell line or bacteria. more complex or multi-input sensing, gene-expression regulatory circuits and synthetic RNA molecules have been designed that can detect disease-associated molecular changes in cells. such devices can be built consisting of transplantable, microencapsulated cells equipped by synthetic gene circuits or assembled signaling pathways. viral thymidine kinase gene expression, replication, and progeny production/cell lysis can occur in a variety of tumor cells, but not normal cells. a pox virus that shows tumor-specific replication based on targeting multiple mechanisms was rationally constructed by simple genetic engineering. further approaches for targeting cancer cells have been devised to equip bacteria with multiple functions. synthetic mobile genetic elements that can invade mosquito populations could provide a tool capable of rapidly spreading genetically-engineered parasite resistance among mosquitoes. chimeric antigens exemplifies a relatively straightforward approach to construct novel diagnosis tools for pathogens (e.g. Lyme disease) involving DNA-synthesis and genome-assembly techniques have been used to generate entire viral genomes. synthetic biology approaches including non-natural amino acids and expanded genetic codes have been envisaged for the biosynthesis and diversification of peptide-based compound libraries. synthetic circuitries involving hybrid transcription regulators have been developed that allow to screen potential drugs for tuberculosis [27] or HIV infection [28] in a mammalian cell line or bacteria. adenovirus was constructed in which viral genes needed for its replication (E1A and E4) were brought under the control of the gene regulatory region of the human E2F1 gene that in normal cells is repressed by the RB tumor suppressor gene product. a pox virus that shows tumor-specific replication (in clinical trials) based on targeting multiple mechanisms was rationally constructed. simple tetracycline-repressible genetic circuits have been devised to eradicate insect vector populations for parasites causing malaria or dengue fever. synthetic mobile genetic elements that can invade mosquito populations could provide a tool capable of rapidly spreading genetically-engineered parasite resistance among mosquitoes in the field [41] synthetic biology is one of the best-known applications linked to synthetic biology. synthetic biology approaches include non-natural amino acids and expanded genetic codes. toxic contamination of soil and water has become major environmental issues on a global scale. cells contain an oscillator module based on genetic quorum-sensing circuits (light green), producing synchronized oscillations of expression of H2O2 and of green fluorescent protein (GFP) this genetic oscillator was coupled to one of two arsenite sensor modules containing parts of the oscillator (luxR or luxl genes) under the control of an arsenite-responsive repressor protein (ArsR) and its cognate promoter element ( biosensors have early been generated to detect and measure environmental contaminants such as heavy metals, explosives or pesticides. the introduced genetic circuits can vary greatly in complexity. examples comprising natural sensor proteins can be distinguished from those that involve \u201cnon-natural\u201d sensor proteins with novel specificities, generated by directed evolution [51] or computational design [52]. decontamination of water or soil by microorganisms (bioremediation) is a process that can occur naturally (intrinsic bioremediation), it may be enhanced by the addition of nutrients (biostimulation), additional microorganisms (bioaugmentation) or by plants (phytoremediation) a novel and complex catabolic pathway for the degradation of organic pollutants methylphenols and methylbenzoates has been constructed in Pseudomona sp. a pathway to synthesize lactic acid from sugar was generated in E. coli [61] and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) was engineered to produce polyhydroxy-alkanoates (PHA) [62]. Interestingly, a new efficient pathway for the biosynthesis of a chemical that is produced in nature in trace amounts only was constructed by adding a single enzyme activity to an organism. a new pathway was constructed involving a high degree of rational design based on in silico algorithms predicting and ranking possible pathways from E. coli central metabolites to BDO. this was followed by optimizing the strain to channel carbon and energy sources into the new pathway via gene deletions guided by an E. coli genome-scale metabolic model. a recent computational modeling approach combines synthetic arsenite-sensing gene circuits with an oscillating circuit in E. coli. a large number of these fluorescent biosensor cell colonies were coupled and synchronized via a rapidly diffusible, long-range output signal (hydrogen peroxide) generated by the synthetic circuits. a new pathway for biodegradation of 2-chlorotoluene was assembled from segments of distinct catabolic pathways. the function to seek and degrade a pollutant was generated by coupling in E. coli a synthetic aptamer riboswitch that recognizes the herbizide atrazine to the translation of the mRNA for the protein controlling E. coli motility. a mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MDD) activity was derived from a protein-engineered version of an MDD from an archebacterium. the strain directly produce 1,4-butanediol (BDO) [66], an important commodity chemical for products such as plastics, rubber or solvents. this example is especially noteworthy since it has moved metabolic pathway engineering closer towards a central synthetic biology concept. new generations of biofuels based on non-edible, lignocellulosic plant parts, special energy grasses or microalgae have thus been envisaged [17, 68-70] some approaches aim to create \u201cdrop-in\u201d fuels that can use existing infrastructure and can be mixed with fossil fuels in any ratio. these are based on synthetic hydrocarbons or higher-chain alcohols (like butanol) with high energy content, allowing gasoline, diesel and the origin of genes is indicated by color: blue, R. eutropha; green, C. acetobutylicum; orange, T. denticola. the introduction of as few as two heterologous genes, encoding acyl-ACP reductase (AAR) and alkanal decarboxylative mono-oxygenase (ADM) activities, can confer, or enhance n-alkane (C10- C20) pathway engineering approaches aim to synthesize biofuels from lignocellulosic polysaccharides (cellulose, hemicellulose), making available non-edible plant parts. genes to make use of cellulose or hemicellulose were transferred into different microorganisms, some of them containing one or several exogenous genes, in order to synthesize butanol, biodiesel or hydrocarbons. cyanobacteria have been metabolically engineered to efficiently produce and secrete fatty acids (to synthesize biodiesel) [85] or alkanes [86], with secretion allowing continuous and energy-saving production schemes [17] there is as yet no such product on the market. synthetic biology approaches to construct new pathways for microbial hydrogen production might contribute to solving these problems in the future. biodiesel and alkanes were synthesized from sugar in E. coli, yeast and other fungi and alkanes in microalgae. pathway engineering approaches aim to synthesize biofuels from lignocellulosic polysaccharides (cellulose, hemicellulose), making available non-edible plant parts. genes to make use of cellulose or hemicellulose were transferred into different microorganisms, some of them containing one or several exogenous genes, in order to synthesize butanol, biodiesel or hydrocarbons. introducing as few as two genes from other cyanobacteria was sufficient to build a pathway for linear alkane synthesis and a module for alkane secretion. this allowed to generate these functions in robust cyanobacterial genera that may be exploited for industrial use. however, there is as yet no such product on the market. synthetic biology approaches to construct new pathways for microbial hydrogen production might contribute to solving these problems in the future. new drug discovery and diagnosis tools to combat important infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis [27], may be expected. synthesizing drugs by metabolically-engineered microbes may provide more affordable alternatives to expensive chemical synthesis or extraction from precious natural sources. bacterial toxicity or host immune response may occur, or there may be genetic changes with unpredictable consequences during the proliferation cycle of \u201cliving therapeutics\u201d such as viruses or bacteria [97, 98] concerns include potential hazards for human health (by synthetic gene products injected by bites of surviving female mosquitoes), potential ecological consequences (e.g. empty niche) [100, 101] or ethical and social issues [101, 102] sustainable biosynthesis of chemicals and materials could reduce depletion of and dependence on fossil resources and mitigate climate change. in situ applications of GEMs for biosensing and bioremediation will require GEMs to be released into the environment. some experiments point to possible impacts on indigenous organisms through horizontal gene transfer of recombinant DNA or via indirect effects. in vitro work demonstrated storage in and recovery of genetic information from various XNAs. these enzymes were generated by directed evolution of a replicative Thermococcus polymerase [113] the findings may implicate the natural evolution of such enzyme activities, which would undermine a solely XNA-based firewall. large-scale production of bio-based chemicals (including fuels) may result in competition for land needed to grow food crops and may lead to GHG emissions from land-use change. energy climate change mitigation and improved energy security could be the key assets of new generation of biofuels, if their production and use resulted in a net reduction of total GHG emissions. biofuels produced via photosynthetic microalgae may avoid these issues in principle. these issues may be reduced or avoided if plant feedstock can be grown on agriculturally-degraded or abandoned land with little or no fertilizer input. biofuels produced via photosynthetic microalgae may avoid these issues in principle. the way patents for synthetic biology solutions are organized and applied may therefore influence the extent to which poor countries in the global south have access to biofuel feedstock and technologies. concerns have been raised that genetically engineered microorganisms such as microalgae could pose environmental risks if they escape, by becoming invasive and evolving rapidly [138] potential hazards for human health, potential ecological consequences, or ethical and social issues. initial field-release experiments have recently been performed in the cayman islands, Malaysia, and in Brazil [99, 101] further socio-economic issues may arise from a soar in broad patents and \u201cpatent thickets\u201d through synthetic biology [103, 104], potentially impeding access to drugs by poor countries. in situ applications of GEMs for biosensing and bioremediation will require GEMs to be released into the environment. some experiments point to possible impacts on indigenous organisms through horizontal gene transfer of recombinant DNA or via indirect effects. upcoming approaches based on systems and synthetic biology could improve the issue of poor in situ efficiency of GEMs. these enzymes were generated by directed evolution of a replicative Thermococcus polymerase. the findings may implicate the natural evolution of such enzyme activities, which would undermine a solely XNA-based firewall. even synthetic \u201cxeno-organisms\u201d that would show complete genetic isolation from DNA-based life forms might still interact with native organisms on an ecological level. large-scale production of bio-based chemicals (including fuels) may result in competition for land needed to grow food crops and may lead to GHG emissions from land-use change. energy climate change mitigation and improved energy security could be the key assets of new generation of biofuels. biofuels produced via photosynthetic microalgae may avoid these issues in principle. but their benefits will depend on answers to crucial issues. possible solutions include the use of wastewater (as a nutrient source) and flue-gas CO2. the way patents for synthetic biology solutions are organized and applied may therefore influence the extent to which poor countries in the global south have access to biofuel feedstock and technologies. concerns have been raised that genetically engineered microorganisms such as microalgae could pose environmental risks if they escape, by becoming invasive and evolving rapidly [138] a large increase in the scope of growing energy crops linked to an easier and more lucrative conversion to biofuels by \u201csynthetic\u201d organisms may make these issues more pressing. a large increase in the scope of growing energy crops linked to an easier and more lucrative conversion to biofuels by \u201csynthetic\u201d organisms may make these issues more pressing. large-scale custom DNA synthesis (and new genome-assembly techniques) combined with knowledge from functional genomics on pathogens might facilitate the generation and malicious use of new pathogens by both nation states and non-state actors (e.g. rogue individuals or terrorist groups) a number of governance options have been suggested both within and outside the field. effective governance should be informed by the most pluralistic expertise and perspectives available. therefore, various actors may be involved by creating conditions that encourage them to take on and evolve responsibilities regarding the development of scientific knowledge and the various levels of risks associated with its use."}
