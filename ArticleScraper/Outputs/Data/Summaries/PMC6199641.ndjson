{"summary": "hyponatremia (HN) 135 mmol/L is a frequent finding in children with community-acquired pneumonia. we aimed to determine the proportion of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) among patients with CAP and HN. study was approved by the ethics committee of hospital universitario Ram\u00f3n y Cajal. participants were 1-month-old to 17-year-old children hospitalized due to CAP. CAP was defined as fever and an infiltrate in the chest x-ray. essential criteria for SIADH were plasma osmolality 275 mOsm/kg, urine sodium >40 mmol/L and clinical euvolemia without edema or dehydration (9). additional criteria were urinary osmolality >100 mOsm/kg and fractional sodium excretion (FENa) >1%. PCR was carried out for influenza (A and B), bocavirus (hBoV), adenovirus (ADV), enterovirus (EV), human rhinovirus (hRV), and coronavirus (CoV; 229E, OC43, NL63 y HKU12). bacterial growth in blood culture or pleural fluid, positive PCR in blood, positive PCR in nasopharyngeal exudate for atypical bacteria, and positive the continuous variables are expressed as the mean standard deviation (SD) or the median and interquartile range according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test. a multivariate, conditional logistic regression analysis model was used. an intro, simultaneous regression model was built, and then checked with forward and backward models. a significance level of 0.1 was used. serum sodium 135 mmol/L was defined as serum sodium 135 mmol/L. dehydration was evaluated attending skin turgor, urinary output, tears and mouth saliva. additional criteria were urinary osmolality >100 mOsm/kg. Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen in pleural fluid (BinaxNow) was added if thoracentesis was performed. PCR multiplex was performed in nasopharyngeal aspirate for 16 viruses. the primary endpoint was serum sodium 135 mmol/L. we studied the following potential predictors as independent variables. a descriptive analysis of the sample was performed. Spearman\u2019s test was performed in order to study the linear correlations. the assumptions of simple linear regression were verified using graphs of residuals. 5 (3%) of 150 patients had serum sodium 130 mmol/L. no patient had symptoms attributable to HN. features of children with and without HN can be found in Table 1. 87 (82) 0.19 2.1 (0.6\u20136.6) SatO292%\u2014n (%) 8 (13.3) 25 (27) 0.09 N/A CRP (mg/L) 135 (54\u2013266) 49 (21\u201396) 0.001 N/A CRP >100 mg/L\u2014n (%) 29 (65) 25 (23) 0.001 6.1 (2.8\u201313.3) PCT (ng/mL) 1.6 (0.2\u201310.4) 0.19 (0.09\u20130.64) 0.00 of the 45 patients with serum sodium levels 135 mmol/L, we wanted to determine the number of patients who had true, hypo-osmolar HN. we excluded 10 patients who lacked serum proteins data. only 22 (62%) of these 35 patients had true, hypo-osmolar HN. three patients with HN and hypo-osmolality had urine sodium 40 mmol/L, but had a urine osmolality of >100 mOsm/kg. no significant differences were found in terms of hospitalization, compared with the rest of patients with HN. urine sodium levels 20 mmol/L and urine sodium levels >20 mmol/L. negative linear correlation between serum sodium and PCT. the slope of the regression line was significantly greater than zero, indicating that urine sodium levels tend to decrease as serum sodium levels decrease. a total of 72% of patients are explained by the model. some of our patients with HN and hypo-osmolality had low urine sodium and FENa 1%, which is at odds with SIADH. vomiting is a well-known cause of vasopressin release, along with pain and stress. there is increasing evidence that IL-6 and ADH release are related. hypo-osmolality and low urine sodium may displace the ADH curve to the left. vomiting, inflammation and IL-6 may increase ADH liberation, leading to hypo-osmolality. only five patients in our study had clinical and laboratory criteria for SIADH."}
