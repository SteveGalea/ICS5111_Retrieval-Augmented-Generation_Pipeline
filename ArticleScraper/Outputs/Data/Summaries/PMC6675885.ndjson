{"summary": "MERS-CoV emerged from a zoonotic origin, with the original host thought to be bats and the current host reservoir being camels (2\u20135) the virus has yet to show sustained transmission between humans. the yeast knockout collection knocked out each gene in S. cerevisiae with a known DNA cassette containing a unique \u201cbarcode\u201d region. the project managed to knock out 4,600 of the 6,000 yeast genes. deletion of the others resulted in an inability to produce viable yeast. YDL042C/SIR2 is a sirtuin protein, first identified through its role in silencing the cryptic mating-type loci HML and HMR. sirtuins have been defined as NAD-dependent histone deacetylases (32) involved in regulating a multitude of cellular functions, including metabolism, apoptosis, stress responses, DNA repair, and gene expression. the yeast-based screening system demonstrated a functional link between ORF4a and SIRT1 in mammalian cells. however, ORF4a can modulate SIRT1-mediated enhancement of NF-B signaling, suggesting a functional link between the two proteins in mammalian cells. id was able to grow similarly to yeast transformed with a vector control. however, grown in the presence of 2% galactose (Gal), viral genes were expressed. we analyzed whether any of the MERS-CoV-encoded proteins could inhibit yeast growth by performing 48 h growth curves. yeast cells were diluted and cultured for 48 h in 2% raffinose media. every 30 min, the plate was shaken for 30 s and the OD600 was read. the growth curve has OD600 plotted against time. a known YDL042C/SIR2 strain was picked from an arrayed collection of the YKO library. the most commonly detected gene deletion was YDL042C/SIR2. Western blot to demonstrate that the suppressor phenotype observed in YDL042C/SIR2 colonies was not a result of a lack of ORF4a expression. large colonies were picked from Gal plates and tested for growth in liquid culture and for continued expression of ORF4a. the identity of the knockout was determined by PCR amplification and sequencing of the unique barcode regions that are used in the yeast knockout library. a confirmed YDL042C/SIR2 deletion strain was transformed with the ORF4a expression plasmid. the suppressor phenotype was maintained. YDL042C/SIR2 is a bona fide genetic suppressor of ORF4a. or223W DSC3 1 YDL051W LHP1 1 YLL001W DNM1 1 YNR060W FRE4 1 YAL014C SYN8 1 YCR010C ADY2 1 YOR248W Dubious ORF 1 YHR073W OSH3 1 YMR210W MGL2 1 YPL003W ULA1 1 YLR020C YEH2 1 Y endogenous SIRT1 is localized to the nucleus in Huh7 cells. a plasmid encoding ORF4a-GFP showed GFP signal in the cytosol. but the nuclear puncta of ORF4a-GFP appeared to be in regions with lower levels of SIRT1 labeling. Huh7 cells were plated to coverslips 1 day prior to infection with MERS-CoV at an MOI of 1. infection was allowed to proceed for 18 h prior to fixation and immunofluorescence labeling for SIRT1 (visualized with anti-mouse Texas Red) in all experiments, nuclei were labeled with DAPI. anti-GFP antibody was used to immunoprecipitate ORF4a-GFP. in cells cotransfected with ORF4a-GFP and either of the SIRT1 constructs, SIRT1 was detected only in the nonspecific and flowthrough fractions and never in the IP fraction. these data suggest ORF4a and SIRT1 do not directly interact in mammalian cells. lysate and nonspecific (NS), flowthrough (FT) and IP fractions were all analyzed. yeast SIR2 was detected as a genetic suppressor of ORF4a-mediated slow growth. however, ORF4a and SIRT1 were found to not directly interact in mammalian cells. Huh7 cells were treated with the indicated concentration of resveratrol. resveratrol was incubated for 24 h and supernatant collected. vir TCID50 per milliliter in the supernatant was determined on Vero cells. siRNA-transfected cells were infected 24 h after plating with MERS-CoV. titer in supernatant was determined as described for panel C. siRNA-transfected cells were transfected with wild-type or H363Y mutant SIRT1 plasmids. resveratrol is a broad activator of sirtuin proteins, of which there are 7 in the human genome. this was tested by transfecting cells with SIRT1 siRNA, treating with resveratrol, and infecting with MERS-CoV. two lentiviral preparations were used to transfect two separate populations of Huh7 cells stably expressing the dCas9 construct (Huh7-dCas9 cells) the sgRNA is constitutively expressed, while the dCas9 is doxycycline (DOX) inducible; therefore, the stable cell populations can be divided into DOX-treated and untreated populations for internal controls of target gene knockdown. samples were collected 24 h later to determine titer by TCID50 assay. data are from three independent infections, with error bars representing standard deviations. resveratrol inhibited MERS-CoV replication even in the absence of SIRT1. IR2 was unable to detect a direct interaction between ORF4a and mammalian SIRT1. we therefore speculated that ORF4a may have an indirect influence on SIRT1 activity in promoting MERS-CoV replication. we used NF-B signaling as a readout of SIRT1 activity to determine whether ORF4a alters this. ORF4a alters SIRT1 function in mammalian cells. HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid and combinations of ORF4a-GFP, wild-type (WT) or H363Y mutant SIRT1 as labeled. cells were lysed and whole-cell lysates were Western blotted. control and ORF4a data are the same as described for panel A. cells were treated with resveratrol (Res) or EX527 (EX) for 2 h prior to addition of TNF- and further incubation for 6 h. luciferase production was determined as described for panel A. RT1 transfection and the resveratrol treatment suggest that ORF4a alters a SIRT1-mediated response in cells. this phenotype can be used to investigate functional aspects of these proteins in eukaryotic cells by the use of suppressor screens. in these screens, yeast genes are knocked out or overexpressed to identify genes that suppress the growth phenotype caused by the expression of the pathogen protein. SP5 (green dotted/dashed line in Fig. 1A), NSP10 (maroon line), NSP15 (gray line) and ORF4a (gray line) other MERS-CoV genes examined had only a modest impact. expression of GFP-tagged proteins alone was not responsible for the slow growth observed. the OD600 was measured, yeast cells were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 in 2% raffinose media. a 1:5 dilution series of the yeast was made. each 30 min, the plate was shaken for 30 s and the OD600 was read. a known YDL042C/SIR2 strain was picked from an arrayed collection of the YKO library and transformed with gal-inducible ORF4a plasmid. the plasmid was used to test whether YDL042C/SIR2 yeast cells do or do not grow faster than wild-type yeast. 150 colonies were assessed for growth phenotypes and 56 were found to have suppressor phenotypes to various degrees. the most commonly detected gene knockout was YDL042C/SIR2 (no other sirtuin genes were detected) YDL042C/SIR2 is a bona fide genetic suppressor of ORF4a-mediated slow growth. the phenotype seen when ORF4a was present was specific. YDL042C/SIR2 is a bona fide genetic suppressor of slow growth. the data in the column labeled \u201cNo. of hits\u201d indicate numbers of individual colonies that were found to have same gene deletion. the mammalian homologue of yeast YDL042C/SIR2 is the histone deacetylase sirtuin protein SIRT1. the nuclear puncta of ORF4a-GFP appeared to be in regions with lower levels of SIRT1 labeling. the more punctate appearance of cytosolic ORF4a in infected cells was possibly a result of lower expression levels compared to the overexpression construct. for 18 h prior to fixation and immunofluorescence labeling, nuclei were labeled with DAPI. arrows point toward nuclear and arrowheads point toward cytosolic ORF4a localizations. a higher level of expression of SIRT1 would allow us to detect even low levels of interaction. ORF4a and SIRT1 do not directly interact in mammalian cells. whole-cell lysates from untransfected (Unt.) Huh7 cells or cells transfected with wild-type SIRT1 or H363Y mutant SIRT1-Flag-tagged plasmids were subjected to Western blotting with anti-GFP antibody. the genetic suppression observed in yeast does not necessitate a direct interaction between the two proteins. we hypothesize that ORF4a may modulate SIRT1 activity indirectly to regulate MERS-CoV replication. resveratrol, a chemical compound that broadly activates sirtuin proteins, can inhibit MERS-CoV replication. cell viability was determined by cellTiter-Glo assay. error bars represent standard deviations of results of comparisons between 6 treatment wells from an experiment representing 3. siRNA-transfected cells were infected 24 h after plating with MERS-CoV. cells were incubated for 24 h prior to supernatant collection. titer in the supernatant was determined as described for panel C. tuin proteins may have different impacts on MERS-CoV infection. this was tested by transfecting cells with SIRT1 siRNA. resveratrol inhibits MERS-CoV infection independently of SIRT1. both human-dCas9-sgRNA cells demonstrated knockdown of SIRT1. doxycycline-treated cells were infected with MERS-CoV for 7 days. doxycycline-treated dCas9-sgRNA cells were cultured as described for panel. resveratrol inhibited MERS-CoV replication even in the absence of SIRT1. the level of inhibition of MERS-CoV replication appears to have been slightly lower in this experiment. however, under conditions of testing over multiple infections, the inhibition results were statistically significant. HEK293T cells were transfected with combinations of ORF4a, SIRT1 (WT or H363Y mutant) and a B-luciferase plasmid. the following day, cells were treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) for 6 h and lysed. the amount of luciferase produced was determined. cell lysates were Western blotted for SIRT1, GFP, and tubulin as a loading control. cells were transfected with various combinations of plasmids and treated with TNF- for 6 h prior to performing a firefly luciferase assay. luciferase production was largely blocked compared to the levels seen with cells without transfected ORF4a. results from the SIRT1 transfection and the resveratrol treatment suggest ORF4a alters a SIRT1-mediated response in cells. Yeast species do not have an interferon response and yet show growth inhibition by ORF4a expression. suppressor screen results suggest there is a functional link between the two proteins but that the link does not rely on a direct physical interaction. siRNA or CRIPSRi knockdown of SIRT1 had no impact on resveratrol-mediated inhibition of MERS-CoV replication. resveratrol can activate SIRT1 function, suggesting that other sirtuins that are activated by the compound may have antiviral properties. resveratrol may have other effects on cell biology that inhibit replication. we found that SIRT1 overexpression in HEK293T cells actually resulted in an enhanced NF-B response following TNF- treatment. this enhancement occurred regardless of the level of catalytic activity of SIRT1. this discrepancy with previously published work could represent a result of the use of different cell lines.
