{"summary": "RNA viruses have rapid replication and high error rates, leading to immense diversity within each viral replication cycle. it has been proposed that this gives these viral pathogens an increased ability to shift to a new environmental niche, such as a new host. however, if diversity within a quasispecies becomes too high, deleterious mutations can accumulate leading to loss of overall fitness. DWV is a member of the single-stranded positive-sense RNA genus Iflavirus. it exists as a group of closely related viruses, often considered as variants of the same species complex. a second closely related virus Varroa destructor virus-1 is also part of the genus Iflavirus, which is now designated DWV type B. transmission of DWV by Varroa reduces variant diversity to one master variant. the dominance of one master variant over another will lead to ultimately different life histories for the colony. by existing as a diverse swarm of variants, viruses are able to co-occupy several biological niches. recombination between these variants is a source of further variation. there are numerous biological implications of quasispecies occupying large amounts of sequence space that challenge the treatment and control of established and emerging infectious diseases. effective vaccines are yet to be developed for both these viruses because of the rapid emergence of resistant mutants under vaccine selection pressure. a 'new' non-Varroa-transmitted DWV master variant may be circulating in some colonies during the winter causing OCL. the 'vicuna' de novo assembler was used as it is designed to assemble highly heterogeneous viral populations. a bioinformatics pipeline was developed to accommodate the large amount of variation found within the DWV species complex. reads were searched against a custom BLAST database containing the DWV, VDV-1 and KV genomes, with an e-value of 10e5. 'sed' and 'awk' scripts were used to parse and read the top hit of the BLAST output. paired reads were balanced using a custom script written in R version 3.2.0. the balanced DWV family reads were assembled using the Vicuna assembler. DWV scaffolds were aligned with full-length genome sequences from the NCBI database. full genome comparisons were visualised in mVISTA (Frazer et al., 2004) dRp amino acid sequences for seven DWV subtypes spanning all three types that were either sequenced and assembled from the Devon hive or available from genbank. we assumed a fixed rate model of protein evolution and reconstructed the phylogeny using a model jumping method. to test whether these fragments contain a molecular clock signal, we estimated the root-to-tip divergence using Path-o-gen v.1.4 to estimate how much genetic variation can be explained by the sampling date. a temporal signal is supported if there is a significant difference between the real data set and the randomised data sets. jModelTest v.2.1.1 used path sampling to compare lecular clock models. the resulting substitution models were the Tamura-Nei (tnR) model (lp-fragment) and the Hasegawa, Kashino and Yano (HKY) model (vp3- and RdRp-fragments) we chose an exponential relaxed clock prior for the lp- and capsid-fragments and a lognormal relaxed clock and constant growth prior for the RdRp-fragment as well as for the DWV-subtype analyses. to generate a genome-wide estimate, we calculated the mean of the relaxed clock means for the individual fragments. Xia et al. (2003) used the method from Xia et al. to confirm that the alignment had not reached substitution saturation. Sequencing and assembly Total RNA was sequenced without an amplification step. 'sed' and 'awk' scripts were used to parse and read the top hit of the BLAST output. the reads that contained 'nohits' were extracted using QIIME. the balanced reads were assembled using the Vicuna assembler. the same steps were carried out on the type A sequence in order to assemble the type A genome consensus from Devon. the DWV scaffolds were then aligned with full-length genome sequences from the NCBI database. full genome comparisons were visualised in mVISTA. we reconstructed the phylogeny of the conserved RdRp amino acid sequences for seven DWV subtypes, spanning all three types that were either sequenced and assembled from the Devon hive or available from genbank. we used a Bayesian approach using MrBayes (v. 3.1.2) to test whether these fragments contain a molecular clock signal, we estimated the root-to-tip divergence using Path-o-gen v.1.4 to estimate how much genetic variation can be explained by the sampling date. a temporal signal is supported if there is a significant difference between the real data set and the randomised data sets. the path sampling maximum likelihood estimator was implemented in BEAST 1.8. for the three large temporal data sets, we used jModelTest v.2.1.1. the substitution models were the Tamura-Nei (tnR) model (lp-fragment) and the Hasegawa, Kashino and Yano (HKY) model (vp3- and RdRp-fragments) we chose an exponential relaxed clock prior for the lp- and capsid-fragments and a lognormal relaxed clock and constant growth prior for the RdRp-fragment as well as for the DWV-subtype analyses. we implemented this evolutionary rate as an uncorrelated lognormal clock prior for the DWV-subtype analysis with a lognormal distribution. Xia et al. (2003) used the method from Xia et al. to confirm that the alignment had not reached substitution saturation. DWV-subtype analysis was performed on colonies that survived (GD2) or collapsed (GD1) because of OCL. disproportionate coverage of the 5\u2032 region of the type A variant was unusually high. however, closer examination of 3\u2032 region where the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene is located revealed that the Devon type B variant shared 100% identity to VDV-1 type B genome in this region. ed with other type A variants, whereas Type C formed a distinct branch, confirming the originality and thus new master variant assignment of DWV Type C. we screened for any genomes with evidence of recombination and excluded them from the analysis in order to comply with the assumptions underlying phylogenetic reconstruction. nucleotide consensus sequences created by Vicuna for type A were found to be 98.2% identical to the type A reference DWV genome. a Bayesian analysis of the polyprotein encoding region of the sequences was carried out using an MCMC model. a molecular clock model was run within BEAST v1.8.1. DWV is a \u2018generalist' known to infect bumblebees. it is unclear which variant was responsible for OCL. 85% to 98% of reads in hive GD1 were Type C. DWV type B is not present at sufficient levels to protect the honey bee from the virulent type A, or possibly C variants. DWV type B is not present at sufficient levels to protect the honey bee from the virulent type A, or possibly any recombinants between A and C. a total of seven Hepatitis C virus genotypes exist to date, differing from each other by >15% over their complete coding region. a new classification of DWV as a quasispecies with at least three master variants that can recombine with each other would be prudent. respiratory syndrome, Ebola and influenza are major threats to public health. further study of the DWV quasispecies may help explain how DWV is able to exist as multiple variants in many hosts. may elucidate mechanisms by which it establishes a persistent infection among several hosts but only proves pathogenic in some."}
