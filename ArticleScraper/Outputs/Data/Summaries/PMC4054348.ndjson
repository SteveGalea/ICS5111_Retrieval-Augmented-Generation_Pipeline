{"summary": "a coV is the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) the first global human pandemic disease of the 21st century spread to 30 countries in five continents. a large-scale animal screening was implemented in may 2003. several strains of SARS CoVs were isolated from nasal and/or fecal swabs of six masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and one raccoon dog (Nyc in 2005, 87 to 92% nucleotide (nt) identity with SARS CoVs were identified in horseshoe bats (11, 12) the key S1 domain of the S gene, responsible for receptor binding and determining host tropisms (22, 23), shared a sequence identity as low as 76 to 78% with SARS CoVs and had a deletion of 19 amino acids (aa) in the S gene receptor binding domain (RBD), which mediates human infection via lyRa11 has high nucleotide and amino acid identities in its genome. several clades of new alphacoronaviruses have been identified in Rhinolophus and Myotis spp. alphacoronavirus; betacoronavirus; S, SARS-like CoV. TABLE 1 Details of rectal swabs from bats and positive number of bats detected by nested RT-PCR Organism Xiangyun Bingchuan Jinghong Baoshan Total No. No. all specimens were pooled and subjected to viral metagenomic analysis. RT-PCR primers targeting a 440-bp fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene were synthesized based on previous publications. six clones of each amplicon were randomly picked for sequencing by the Sanger method in an ABI 3730 sequencer (Invitrogen) the first two letters represent the sampling location, with the remaining letters identifying the host species and numbers referring to the sampling order. 16 degenerate PCR primer pairs were designed using GeneFisher, based on human/civet SARS CoV and bat SARS-like CoV sequences available in GenBank. positive swab was examined for viral particles of LYRa11. 100-l suspensions were centrifuged at 120,000 g for 3 h in an SW55Ti rotor. pellets were resuspended in 20 l SM buffer. total proteins were harvested 24 h posttransfection with pEGFP-Rp3. total protein was boiled in 2 protein loading buffer (Tiangen) for 10 min, separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore) the blocked membrane was then incubated with primary antibody mixture (SARS-convalescent human serum, rabbit anti-EGFP antibody [Beyotime], and 5% skimmed milk [vol/vol/vol = the aligned sequences were initially scanned for recombinational events using the Recombination Detection Program (RDP; version 4) using MaxChi and Chimaera methods. maximum likelihood trees of four genomic regions generated by four breakpoints were constructed to illustrate the phylogenetic origin of parental regions. in total, 268 adult bats were live captured with nets in 2011 in 4 counties/prefectures of Yunnan Province. in each county there was either a single sampling location or two adjacent sites.

RT-PCR primers targeting a 440-bp fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene were synthesized based on previous publications. using GeneFisher, based on human/civet SARS CoV and bat SARS-like CoV sequences available in GenBank, targeting almost the full length of the genome. the amplicons were sequenced after blunt ligation into pZeroBack vector (Tiangen) the amplicons were assembled with SeqMan v.7.0 into full genomic sequences. plasmids pEGFP-BJ, pEGFP-LY, and pEGFP-Rp3 were transiently expressed in BHK-21 cells using FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Promega) total proteins were harvested 24 h posttransfection with M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Promega) concentration was measured by the BCA protein assay kit (Tiandz) washed membrane was then scanned in an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences) at 700-nm and 800-nm wavelengths to detect EGFP protein. the full-length genomic sequence of LYRa11 was aligned with selected human/civet SARS CoVs (Tor2, AY274119; BJ01, AY278488; SZ3, AY304486). a total of 730,668 useful reads with an average length of 141 nt were generated. a total of 730,668 useful reads with an average length of 141 nt were generated. a total of 730,668 useful reads with an average length of 141 nt were generated. of 216 coronavirus-related sequences, 177 matched to the helicase gene of alphacoronavirus, with 70% nucleotide identities. 11% (13/120) of bats from Xiangyun, 7% (7/100) from Bingchuan, and 6% (2/34) from Jinghong were alphacoronavirus positive. 2/11 (18%) Rhinolophus affinis bats from Baoshan were positive for SARS-like CoVs, sharing 98.4% nucleotide identity in the RdRp gene with bat SARS-like CoV Rp3. the full genome of LYRa11 contained 29,805 nt, slightly larger than that of SARS CoVs and other bat SARS-like CoVs. LYRa11 is more closely related to Tor2 and Rs3367 than to Rf1 and Rp3. ORF4 is absent from LYRa11, while it is present in Tor2 and Rs3367. LYRa11 shares 92.5 to 94.6% identity with human/civet SARS CoVs. other bat SARS-like CoVs, including BM48, share 58.7 to 61.3% amino acid identities with human/civet viruses. lyra11 and Rs3367 have no deletion and have almost completely the same sequence as SARS CoVs. the sequences of SARS-like CoVs in this study are marked as filled triangles, with other bat SARS-like CoVs as open triangles. lyra11 is antigenically more closely related to SARS CoV than the representative bat SARS-like CoV Rp3. several fragments of LYRa11 were potential recombinants from Rs3367 and Yunnan2011 when LYRa11 was set as a query. four breakpoints were detected in the LYRa11 genome, generating three recombinational fragments. similarity plots suggest fragment 1 of LYRa11 was recombinant from lineages that had ultimately evolved into Rs3367. LYRa11 (bold italic), Rs3367, Yunnan2011, and Rf1 were detected. four breakpoints at nt 20968, 23443, 24643, and 26143 in the LYRa11 genome were detected. phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the three fragments (D to F, corresponding to fragments 1 to 3) by the maximum likelihood method. a total of 730,668 useful reads with an average length of 141 nt were generated. 32,335 of them (4.43%) were noted to viruses, including double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), dsRNA, and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses of mammalian, plant, insect, or bacterial origin. all sequences were classified into two groups: group Alphacoronavirus comprising 17 clades, and group Betacoronavirus comprising 10 clades. clades containing approved species are in italics; clades containing unapproved novel species are marked with an asterisk. the full genome of LYRa11 shared 91% nucleotide identity with those of SARS CoVs and the most recently reported SARS-like CoV Rs3367 (29), slightly higher than the highest identity with other bat SARS-like CoVs published previously (89%). LYRa11 is more closely related to Tor2 and Rs3367 than to Rf1 and Rp3. lyRa11 shared high identity (83.3 to 84.0%) with those of human/civet viruses and Rs3367 but low identity (62.4 to 66.6%) with those of other bat SARS-like CoVs. an RBD amino acid sequence comparison of LYRa11 with human/civet viruses showed that LYRa11 shares 92.5 to 94.6% identity with human/civet SARS CoVs and 95.1% with Rs3367. T487N, was observed in LYRa11 and Rs3367 compared with SARS CoVs. phylogenetic analysis of entire S1 amino acid sequences based on the maximum likelihood method. sequence comparison of entire RBMs of SARS CoVs, LYRa11 (boxed) and other closely related bat SARS-like CoVs are marked as filled triangles. LYRa11 is antigenically more closely related to SARS CoV than the representative bat SARS-like CoV Rp3. the molecular masses are given on the right. lyRa11 is antigenically more closely related to SARS CoV than the representative bat SARS-like CoV Rp3. phylogenetic analyses based on parental regions suggested fragment 1 of LYRa11 was recombinant from lineages that had ultimately evolved into Rs3367. fragments 2 and 3 of LYRa11 were recombinants from lineages of Yunnan2011. similarity plots (A) and bootscan analyses (B) were conducted with LYRa11 as the query and bat SARS-like CoVs. the sample was subjected to RT-PCR for detection of CoV, respirovirus, morbillivirus, henipavirus, avulavirus, rubulavirus, and pneumovirus in Paramyxoviridae and influenza virus A in Orthomyxoviridae. results showed that the sample was positive only for coronavirus. further CoVs have been discovered in different bat species within China. there have been 4 bat betacoronavirus species identified within the Betacoronavirus genus (1) since the first betacoronaviruses, i.e., SARS-like CoVs, were identified in bats. more betacoronaviruses will be identified in bat populations, although not as abundantly as alphacoronaviruses. a 440-bp highly conserved region of the RdRp gene was amplified to construct the phylogenetic tree in the present study. this region is useful to analyze the diversity although cannot accurately determine the evolutionary status of CoVs (20). LYRa11 and Rs3367 reported recently have high sequence identity with the S1 domain of SARS CoVs. LYRa11 is antigenically very close to SARS CoV. LYRa11 is antigenically very close to ACE2. LYRa11- or Rs3367-like viruses will be isolated from bats in the future. previous studies have suggested that SARS CoVs were likely recombinants originating from strains Rp3 and Rf1 (13, 35), while Rs3367 recombined from lineages that had ultimately evolved into human/civet SARS CoV and bat SARS-like CoV Rs672 (29) shaped spikes were observed on the surface of the virions. studies have shown that S1 is not strongly associated with S2. the observation of only a few intact spikes might be ascribed to damage or loss of S1."}
