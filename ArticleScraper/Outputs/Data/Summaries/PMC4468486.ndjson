{"summary": "dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages are key target cells for HIV-1. they are found in all the tissues of the anogenital tract that make up the portals of virus entry (1, 2). they represent the first line of contact between HIV-1 and the immune system. the formation of the TRAF3-TBK1-IRF3 signaling complex is key to the induction of IFNs. lentiviruses such as HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus encode a number of multifunctional accessory proteins which have enabled them to evolve strategies to evade the host immune system (21). containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) via Vpx, apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme and catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) via Vif. tetherin via Vpu also play a key role in interfering with the induction of type I IFNs in T cells (22\u201325) purified high-titer HIV-1BaL stocks on order of 2 109 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50/ml) were produced using tangential filter concentration and titrated. values were generated in TZM-BL cells (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) and measured by long terminal repeat (LTR) -galactosidase reporter gene expression after a single round of infection. the endotoxin levels of these virus stocks were below the detectable limit of 0.005 U/ml or 0.0005 ng/ml. lysates were incubated for 60 min at 4\u00b0C and centrifuged at 18,407 g for 10 min to pellet cell debris. lysates were added to bead-bound antibody, incubated for 3 h or overnight at 4\u00b0C. Western blotting was carried out using lysates derived from MDDCs, MDMs, or transfected HEK293T cells or immunocomplexes derived from immunoprecipitation assays. blots were probed with polyclonal rabbit antibodies directed against K63 ubiquitin, phospo-IRF3, TBK1, phospho-TBK1, IKK, STING, TRAF3, and GAPDH (Cell Signaling) amplification stock was added to the samples and left at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. the cells incubated with a 1:5 dilution of the ligase and a 1:80 dilution of the polymerase for 100 min at 37\u00b0C. slides were visualized through a 60 or 100 1.4-numerical-aperture lens. of 2 109 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50/ml) were produced using tangential filter concentration and titrated as described previously (28\u201330) cells were infected with vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G)-pseudotyped pBaL. the endotoxin levels of these virus stocks were below the detectable limit of 0.005 U/ml or 0.0005 ng/ml (Limulus amebocyte lysate assay; Sigma), and testing for residual tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), IFN-, IFN-, and IFN- was negative. cells were washed in ice cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with 30 l/1 106 cells Phosphosafe lysis buffer (Merck Millipore) the lysates were incubated for 60 min at 4\u00b0C and centrifuged at 18,407 g for 10 min to pellet cell debris. immunoprecipitation assays were performed using a the Turboblotter system (Bio-Rad) and polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. cells were permeabilized and then incubated with one of the following pairs of primary antibodies. the plus and minus (anti-rabbit and anti-mouse) PLA probes were then added to the cells and incubated in a preheated humidity chamber. cells incubated with 1:5 dilution of amplification stock and 1:80 dilution of polymerase. slides were visualized through a 60 or 100 1.4-numerical-aperture lens. images were then deconvolved using deltaVision SoftWoRx software 5.5. gene expression levels of full complement of type I (IFN-, -, -, -, and -) and type III (IFN-1 to -3) IFNs were measured by qPCR. both cell types expressed basal levels of the genes encoding IFN-, -, -, and -1 in mock-treated cells. however, no type I or III IFN gene upregulation was observed in response to HIV-1 in either cell type. gene expression was determined by qPCR, and data for Sendai virus and HSV-1 at 18 h only are shown as a positive control for IFN induction. no upregulation of IFN-, -2, or -3 mRNA was detected in either cell type in response to any treatment. TBK1 staining was diffusely cytoplasmic in mock-treated DCs and macrophages. TBK1 staining became punctate within 2 h of LPS treatment. such staining was observed in approximately 60% of cells. TBK1 can recruit to a number of different signaling complexes. TBK1 is shown in green and the nucleus (DAPI staining) in blue. TBK1 is shown in green and the nucleus (DAPI staining) in blue. TBK1 is shown in green and the nucleus (DAPI staining) in blue. MDDCs were treated with HIV-1BaL (MOI of 1) or Sendai virus or mock treated for 4 h. Western blotting was then carried out on the immunoprecipitated TBK1 complex. blots probed for TRAF3 (upper band) and TBK1 (lower band) TBK1 is ubiquitinated but not phosphorylated in human DCs and macrophages in response to HIV-1. TBK1 must first undergo K63-linked polyubiquitination by TRAF3 followed by transautophosphorylation before phosphorylating IRF3. this then dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus. TBK1 and IKK levels were determined in increasing amounts (15, 30, and 60 g) of mock MDDC cell lysates. TBK1 is ubiquitinated but not phosphorylated in HIV-1-treated MDDCs and MDMs. we hypothesized that the most likely mechanism by which this occurs is via an interaction between one or both of these proteins with TBK1. the most likely candidate was Vpr, as it is present at higher levels in the HIV-1 virion than the other accessory proteins. we therefore carried out coimmunoprecipitation assays in HEK293T cells transfected with plasmids encoding TBK1 and green fluorescent protein-tagged Vpr. HEK293T cells were mock transfected or transfected with mammalian expression vectors encoding TBK1 or Vpr-GFP (B) or TBK1 and pBaL (C) cells were mixed and a coimmunoprecipitation assay was carried out using an antibody to TBK1. blots probed for TBK1 and Vpr (B) and TBK1, Vpr, V type III (IFN-1 to -3) IFNs were measured by qPCR. both cell types expressed basal levels of the genes encoding IFN-, -, -, and -1 in mock-treated cells. no type I or III IFN gene upregulation was observed in response to HIV-1 in either cell type. no upregulation of IFN-, -2, or -3 mRNA was detected in either cell type in response to any treatment. no upregulation of IFN-, -2, or -3 mRNA was detected in either cell type. TBK1 staining was diffusely cytoplasmic in mock-treated DCs and macrophages and became punctate within 2 h of LPS treatment and within 6 h of HIV-1 treatment. such punctate staining was observed in approximately 60% of cells. TBK1 can recruit to a number of different signaling complexes associated with many different outcomes. TBK1 distribution was determined by immunofluorescence deconvolution microscopy. TBK1 is shown in green and the nucleus (DAPI staining) in blue. TBK1 is shown in green and the nucleus in blue. a coimmunoprecipitation assay was then carried out using an antibody to TBK1. Western blotting was then carried out on the immunoprecipitated TBK1 complex. TBK1 does not block IFN induction by targeting signaling proteins for proteasomal degradation. TBK1 is the predominant kinase in immune cells as it is expressed at much higher levels (38\u201340) TBK1 must first undergo K63-linked polyubiquitination by TRAF3 followed by transautophosphorylation before phosphorylating IRF3, which then dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus. TBK1 underwent K63-linked polyubiquitination in response to HIV-1 in both cell types. TBK1 and IKK levels were determined in increasing amounts (15, 30, and 60 g) of mock MDDC cell lysates. TBK1 and IKK levels were determined in increasing amounts (15, 30, and 60 g) of mock MDDC cells. hek293T cells were mock transfected with plasmids encoding TBK1 and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Vpr. the most likely candidate was Vpr, as it is present at higher levels in the HIV-1 virion than the other accessory proteins. we therefore carried out coimmunoprecipitation assays in HEK293T cells. TBK1 and Vpr-GFP (B) or TBK1 and pBaL (C) cell lysates were mixed. a coimmunoprecipitation assay was then carried out using an antibody to TBK1. the blots probed for TBK1 and Vpr (B) and TBK1, Vpr, Vif, and Nef (C) IFN-, -1, and -2 were not induced in DCs or macrophages in response to HSV or Sendai virus. lack of expression of IFN- is consistent with the fact that it is expressed and secreted predominantly by keratinocytes. TBK1 is a node protein involved in both IFN and NF-B signaling pathways. TBK1 is recruited to a number of signaling complexes, resulting in a variety of outcomes other than IFN induction. we used proximity ligation assay and coimmunoprecipitation assay. the leader proteinase of foot-and-mouth disease virus and the PLP2 protein of murine hepatitis virus are both known to block IFN induction by deubiquitinating TBK1. in both cell types, ubiquitinated TBK1 was detected by 4 h after HIV-1 treatment continuing to 24 h. the precise point in the signaling pathway at which HIV-1 blocks IFN induction was defined. several viruses have evolved to block IFN induction by interfering with the TRAF3-TBK1-IRF3 signaling complex via a physical interaction with a virally encoded protein. however, none of these studies have reported a specific interaction of the viral protein with TBK1 but rather that the formation or function of the signaling complex is prevented. reversing the inhibition of IFN- induction by HIV-1 may reduce spread. in mucosal DCs this may restore an early IFN barrier to mucosal HIV-1 penetration by creating a tighter bottleneck. there is substantial productive infection with HIV in (M0) MDMs cultured in human serum in vitro. this is similar to that in ex vivo \u201cresting\u201d microglial cells."}
