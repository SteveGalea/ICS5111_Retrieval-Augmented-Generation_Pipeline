{"summary": "monocytes were differentiated into macrophages by exposure to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (Sigma) primary human monocyte-derived macrophages were cultured in monocyte differentiation medium: X-VIVO 10 (Lonza) supplemented with 1% human fibrin-depleted plasma and antibiotics. cells were grown in humidified atmosphere at 37\u00b0C and 5% carbon dioxide. antibodies against entry factors were purchased from R&D Systems. GP-Binding Assay 293T cells, transfected to express entry factors, were incubated with concentrated cellular supernatants containing comparable amounts of EBOV-GP1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein. RNA was extracted from cell lines and MDMs and analyzed using an ABI 7500 FAST real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems), TaqMan gene expression assays. the mean cycle threshold (Ct) value for each individual assay was calculated from triplicate measurements and mean Ct values calculated for TIM-1, Axl, and NPC1 were normalized by subtraction from the Ct values obtained for the housekeeping reference -glucuronidase. the inhibitors were incubated with target cells for 30\u201360 minutes before addition of pseudotypes. first, MDMs seeded in 8-well chamber slides were transfected with siRNA in duplicates and infected with EBOV at a multiplicity of infection of 10. cells were cultured in monocyte adhesion medium with 7.5% human fibrin-depleted plasma and antibiotics. the next day, cells were detached, reseeded in monocyte differentiation medium. the integrity of all PCR-amplified sequences was confirmed by automated sequence analysis. THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophages and small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfected. for SR-A expression, MDMs were siRNA transfected and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. signal intensities were quantified using the ImageJ software program version 1.47. transduction Experiments Lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with heterologous viral GPs (pseudotypes) were generated as described elsewhere [11] for transduction experiments. target cell lines were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated for 8 hours with vector preparations. cells with medium containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) were permeabilized and stained for nucleoprotein. nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. the number of nucleoprotein-positive cells relative to the total number of cells was determined in every tenth photomicrograph. expression of lectins and TIM-1 increases EBOV-GP-driven entry. expression of TIM-4 and Axl had no effect on transduction mediated by EBOV-GP. expression of TIM-3 and CLEC5A did not modulate transduction under all conditions tested. DC-SIGN but not TIM-1 and Axl Bind to the GP1 subunit of the EBOV-GP. the EBOV-GP subunit was also able to bind to DC-SIGN. surface unit, glycoprotein (GP) 1, of the Ebola virus binds to dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3\u2013grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) but not T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-1 (TIM-1) or Axl. similar results were obtained in a single representative experiment performed with single samples. the effect of siRNA-mediated knock-down of Axl and TIM-1 expression was dependent on cell type. augmentation of GP\u2013driven entry by T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-1 (TIM-1) and Axl is limited to a subset of susceptible cells. TIM-1 on untransfected cells was determined with fluorescence-activated cell sorting 24 hours after transfection. similar results were obtained in a separate experiment. 1 promotes EBOV glycoprotein (GP)\u2013driven entry in a cell-line independent fashion. A, HeLa and Huh7 cells were transfected with the indicated small interfering RNAs. at 72 hours after transduction cells were lysed and analyzed for luciferase activity. similar results were obtained in 3 separate experiments. RT-PCR analysis revealed that MDMs express only low amounts of Axl and TIM-1 compared with the cell lines HeLa and Huh7. siRNA-mediated knock-down of Axl and TIM-1 expression had no appreciable effect on EBOV-GP\u2013driven transduction of MDMs. results represent the mean of 3 independent analyses; error bars indicate standard deviations. luciferase activities in cell lysates were determined 72 hours after transduction. results of a representative experiment performed with triplicate samples are shown. integrin V, CD14, CD36, LOX-1, SR-A, and Mer were previously implicated in EBOV-GP\u2013mediated entry. integrin V, SR-A and Mer expression significantly reduced EBOV-GP\u2013 but not VSV-G\u2013mediated transduction of macrophages. integrin V, SR-A and Mer expression reduced transduction more efficiently than the single siRNAs. transduction of cells transfected with control siRNA was set at 100%. results represent mean of 3 (Mer), 6 (SR-A) and up to 15 experiments. expression of Mer (white bars) was analyzed with flow cytometry. Statistical significance was calculated using the 2-tailed Student t test. we analyzed the efficiency and specificity of the siRNA-mediated knock-down of Mer and SR-A expression. tannic acid blocks ligand binding to SR-A [42] inhibits transduction of MDMs. results are in keeping with a role of SR-A and Mer in EBOV-GP-dependent macrophage transduction. interference with Mer, SR-A, and NPC1 expression reduces EBOV infection. cells were extensively washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. infection efficiency was calculated by determining the ratio of NP-positive to DAPI-positive cells. infection of cells transfected with control siRNA was set at 100%. al cell C-type lectin (LSECtin) increased EBOV-GP\u2013 and EBOV-GPmuc\u2013mediated transduction up to 37-fold but had no effect on entry mediated by vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) expression of TIM-1 and Axl had no effect on transduction mediated by EBOV-GP but slightly enhanced transduction driven by EBOV-GP. the EBOV-GP1 subunit was also able to bind to DC-SIGN. binding to the other proteins tested was within the background range. the surface unit, glycoprotein (GP) 1, of the Ebola virus (EBOV)\u2013GP binds to dendritic cell\u2013specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3\u2013grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) but not T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-1 (TIM-1) or Axl. a comparison between endogenous TIM-1 and Axl expression on cell lines and susceptibility to EBOV-GP and EBOV-GPmuc-driven transduction revealed no correlation. the effect of siRNA-mediated knock-down of Axl and TIM-1 expression (Figure 3C) on transduction efficiency was dependent on cell type. la cells, which express endogenous Axl, and Huh-7 cells, which express endogenous TIM-1, were transfected with the indicated small interfering RNAs (siRNA) expression of Axl on HeLa cells and expression of TIM-1 on Huh7 cells was determined with fluorescence-activated cell sorting 24 hours after transfection. expression of endogenous Niemann-Pick C1 promotes EBOV-GP\u2013mediated entry in a cell-line independent fashion. at 72 hours after transduction cells were lysed and analyzed for luciferase activity. results of a single representative experiment performed with triplicate samples are shown; similar results were obtained in 2 separate experiments. NPC1 but not TIM-1, Axl or Mannose-Specific Lectins Promote EBOV-GP\u2013Mediated Transduction of Macrophages are targeted early and throughout EBOV infection [36, 37]. RT-PCR analysis revealed that MDMs express only low amounts of Axl and TIM-1 compared with the cell lines HeLa and Huh7. TIM-1 promotes EBOV glycoprotein (GP)\u2013mediated transduction of macrophages. total RNA isolated from the indicated cell lines was treated with deoxyribonuclease (DNase) and analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. integrin V, CD14, CD36, LOX-1, SR-A, and Mer were previously implicated in EBOV-GP\u2013mediated entry. integrin V, SR-A and Mer expression significantly reduced EBOV-GP\u2013 but not VSV-G\u2013mediated transduction of MDMs. phages with small interfering RNAs against Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), Mer, and scavenger receptor A (SR-A) reduces Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP)\u2013mediated entry. phages with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), Mer, and scavenger receptor A (SR-A) were transfected with the indicated transduction of cells incubated with solvent (water) was set at 100%. results represent mean of 3 separate experiments performed with triplicate samples. siRNA directed against SR-A reduced EBOV-GP- but not VSV-G-driven transduction by 45%. tannic acid reduced EBOV-GP-mediated transduction in a robust and concentration dependent manner. tannic acid reduced EBOV-GP\u2013 but not VSV-G\u2013mediated transduction by 45%. monocyte-derived macrophages were transfected with the indicated siRNAs and infected with EBOV strain Mayinga at a multiplicity of infection of 10. at 16 hours after infection, cells were extensively washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and stained against EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) and nuclei. tyrosine kinases and TIM proteins promote entry of ebolaviruses [14, 16] and other enveloped viruses [19, 20, 23, 44] by binding to PtdSer in the viral envelope. inability of TIM-3 to augment entry is due to inadequate presentation of its PtdSer-binding domain. mRNA is produced in MDMs compared with susceptible cell lines. siRNA-knock-down showed that expression of these factors is dispensable for GP-driven entry into MDMs. Mer but not Axl or Tyro3 was found to be essential for efficient phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages. recombinant 51 integrin or antibodies against 1 integrin interfere with GP-driven entry [13, 48] but subsequent work indicated that expression of 51 integrin is required for full activity of cathepsin L. SR-A is expressed in macrophages and dendritic cells and contributes to the macrophage uptake of a broad spectrum of ligands, including apoptotic cells. macrophages suggest that the set of factors exploited by the viruses may be cell type dependent."}
