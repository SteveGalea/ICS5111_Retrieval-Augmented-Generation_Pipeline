{"summary": "genome sequencing indicated that SARS-CoV is a new virus with no genetic relatedness to any known human coronaviruses. serologic studies found no evidence of seroprevalence to SARS-CoV or related viruses in the human population. at least 3 different animal species in the shenzhen market were infected by coronaviruses that are closely related to SARS-CoV. this initial study indicated that at least 3 different animal species were infected by coronaviruses that are closely related to SARS-CoV. masked palm civet Paguma larvata Natural None observed (9) Experimental Fever, lethargy, reduced appetite (11) Chinese ferret badger Melogale moschata Natural None observed (9) Cynomolgus macaque Macaca facicularis Experimental Lethargy, skin rash, respiratory distress (12), Rhesus macaque Macaca mulatta Experimental Fever. close match of virus sequences between human and civet isolates from each outbreak strongly suggest that civets are a direct source of human infection. however, these studies did not clarify whether animals other than civets were involved in transmission of SARS-CoV to humans or whether civets were an intermediate host or the natural reservoir host of SARS-CoVs. on dogs in 1 animal market and 1,107 civets from 25 farms in 12 provinces showed positive results for all animals from the market. none of the 21 wild civets sampled had positive antibody or PCR results for SARS-CoV (28) civets were experimentally infected with 2 strains of human SARS-CoV. as many as 84% of the horseshoe bats examined contained antibodies to a recombinant N protein of SARS-CoV. the actual seropositive proportion of R. sinicus might be 84%. genome organization of all bat SARS-like\u2013CoVs is almost identical to that of the SARS-CoVs isolated from humans or civets. phylogenetic trees based on deduced amino acid sequences of the spike protein S1 domain (a), the open reading frame (ORF)10' (b), and the N protein (c). GD01, human isolate from early phase of the outbreak in 2003; Tor2, human isolate from late phase of the outbreak in 2003; SZ3, civet isolate from March 2003; Rp3, bat isolate from Rhinolophus pearsoni, December 2004; Rf1, bat isolate from the discovery of SARS-CoV has boosted the search for novel coronaviruses of human and animal origin. many other coronaviruses have been detected by PCR among diverse bat populations in Hong Kong. the same virus or viruses of the same genetic lineage were found in 3 miniopterus species (M. pusillus, M. magnater, and M. schreibersii) however, attempts to isolate virus by using 3 different cell lines (MDCK, FRhK4 and VeroE6) were unsuccessful. in 2004\u2013July 2005, Woo et al. (32) sampled 309 individual bats representing 13 species from 20 different locations in rural Hong Kong. they detected coronavirus-related viral genomic RNA in 37 bats, representing a prevalence of 12%. hus) were clustered with known bat SARS-like\u2013CoVs (or group 2b), 40 belonged to group 1 and the remaining 22 formed a separate cluster in group 2, most likely clustering with the group 2c viruses reported by Woo et al. (32). Attempts to isolate virus in VeroE6, FRHK4 and CV1 were unsuccessful. cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV seems to be a relatively rare event. cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV seems to be a relatively rare event. human/civet SARS-CoVs are still capable of infecting original reservoir species. molecular epidemiologic studies and studies of receptor-S protein interaction indicate that the progenitor viruses are unlikely to be able to infect humans. a rapid viral evolution in an intermediate host (such as civets) seems to be necessary to adapt the virus for human infection. discovery of bat SARS-like\u2013CoVs and great genetic diversity of coronaviruses in bats shed new light on the origin and transmission of SARS-CoV. a continued search in different bat populations in People's Republic of China and neighboring countries will eventually identify the native reservoir species. a positive outcome of these investigations will greatly enhance our understanding of spillover mechanisms. lophus sinicus Hong Kong (32) Bat-CoV HKU6 Myotis ricketti Hong Kong (32) Bat-CoV HKU7 Miniopterus magnater Hong Kong (32) Bat-CoV HKU8 Miniopterus pusillus M. magnater Miniopterus schreibersii Hong Kong (28,32) BtCoV/701/05 Myotis ricketti Anhui, Yunnan, Guangdong (33) BtCoV from 162 swab samples collected from 12 bat species, they detected a novel group 1 coronavirus by sequencing of PCR products from the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. the same virus or viruses of the same genetic lineage were found in 3 miniopterus species (M. pusillus, M. magnater, and M. schreibersii) group 2a (coronaviruses existing before the discovery of SARS-CoV), group 2b (SARS-CoV and SARS-like\u2013CoVs) and group 2c (novel bat coronaviruses discovered in this study) Attempts to isolate virus in veroE6, MRC-5, LLC-Mk2, FRhK-4, Huh-7.5, and HRT-18 were unsuccessful. cross-species transmission Emergence of zoonotic viruses from a wildlife reservoir requires 4 events: interspecies contact, cross-species virus transmission, and 4) virus adaptation within the spillover species. the most convincing case was the infection of a waitress and a customer in a restaurant where SARS-CoV\u2013positive civets were housed in cages. fecal-oral route represents main mode of transmission among animals. mixing of live reservoir hosts (e.g., bats) and intermediate hosts (e.g., civets) may come from contaminated feces, urine, blood, or aerosols. this may also be true for civet-to-human transmission. the discovery of bat SARS-like\u2013CoVs and the great genetic diversity of coronaviruses in bats has shed new light on the origin and transmission of SARS-CoV. the discovery highlights the increasingly recognized importance of bats as reservoirs of emerging viruses (36). ipaviruses (37,38), Menangle, and Tioman viruses (36), and variants of rabies viruses and bat lyssaviruses (38,39) also support contention that viruses, especially RNA viruses, possess more risk than other pathogens for disease emergence in human and domestic mammals."}
