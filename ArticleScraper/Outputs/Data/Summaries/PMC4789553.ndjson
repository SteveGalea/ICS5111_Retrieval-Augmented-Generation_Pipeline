{"summary": "a concept is emerging in the context of intracellular sensing of pathogens. if molecules specific to pathogens or shared by pathogens and host are located in an inappropriate cellular compartment. subsequent signaling downstream of pathogen recognition is compartmentalized to organelle-based signaling platforms on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. a parallel breakthrough occurred when several groups determined that cytosolic CDNs from a variety of pathogens provoke an IFN response. a parallel breakthrough occurred when several groups determined that cytosolic CDNs \u2013 small nucleotides that are unique to bacteria \u2013 provoke an IFN response. a second study proved a direct biochemical interaction between STING and cyclic-diguanylate. cGAS deletion phenocopies STING deletion with regards to IFN production. cGAMP is the missing cytosolic DNA sensor linking STING activity to IFN production. bacterial cyclic dinucleotides (like L. monocytogenes cyclic di-AMP) also activate. cytoplasmic DNA sensors involved in innate immune responses are the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex and the MRN complex. the two complexes are both sensors and effectors of the DNA damage response (DDR) TBK1 can subsequently phosphorylate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) leading to IFN production. several recent papers have highlighted early IFN-induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) following viral or bacterial infection. IFN-independent induction required STING/TBK1/IRF3 and IRF7. an exciting future direction will be to determine phenotypic outcomes based on subset of ISGs that are induced during a variety of infections. the link between STING/TBK1/IRF3 signaling and autophagy has emerged from several recent studies. cytosolic DNA from the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes was first reported to lead to a type I interferon (IFN) response. a parallel breakthrough occurred when several groups determined that cytosolic CDNs \u2013 small nucleotides that are unique to bacteria \u2013 provoke an IFN response. cyclic dinucleotide eukaryotic second messenger, 2\u20323\u2032-cyclic guanosine monophosphate\u2013adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) was found as the missing cytosolic DNA sensor linking STING activity to IFN production. cGAS deletion phenocopies STING deletion with regards to IFN production following activation. binding of cGAS product, cGAMP, leads to conformational change of STING. bacterial cyclic dinucleotides (like L. monocytogenes cyclic di-AMP) also activate STING. other cytoplasmic DNA sensors involved in innate immune responses. interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) have been previously suggested to be sensors of DNA. consensus on how and whether they act upstream of STING has not been reached. understanding how the DNA-sensing pathways intersect and complement each other in various cell types or tissues. IFN production was the same for RNA viruses in wild-type or TREX1-deficient cells, but viral load was much lower due to a baseline increase in ISGs. this increase was dependent on STING/TBK1/IRF3 and IRF7 and also led to increased lysososomal biogenesis. future questions of interest to the field will be to determine whether the bacterium is secreting its own DNA or lysed bacteria are the source of the DNA signal. it will be informative to compare and contrast signaling outcomes from eukaryotic versus bacterial CDNs in terms of which ISGs are induced. RIG-I was identified as a protein that could lead to IRF activity in the presence of dsRNA in a large scale cDNA screen. a mutant of RIG-I solely expressing its caspase-recruitment domain CARD was sufficient to spontaneously activate the IFN-producing activity. parallel work demonstrated that MDA-5 was a second direct sensor of viral RNA. deletion of enzymes required for this modification leads to increased IFN production dependent on MDA-5 sensing, suggesting that RNA that lacks this modification is the MDA-5 ligand. the structure of this interaction was finally solved in 2013 (Wu et al., 2013a) the other two groups identified MAVS using unbiased high-throughput screens for IFN production. MAVS has a CARD domain, a leucine rich repeat and a transmembrane domain. the protein travels across the mitochondria in waves, reminiscent of a prion-type conversion. the clustering and conversion of MAVS begs the question whether or not it can be restored to its pre-viral state or must it be removed. the vast majority of MAVS is anchored in the mitochondrial outer membrane. a fascinating paper identified that MAVS can also be peroxisomal. RNA Sensing through MAVS Since viral infection generates pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as double stranded RNA, the field of RNA sensing made earlier advances than the field of DNA sensing. TBK1 and IB kinase-i (IKK-i) as kinases critical for phosphorylation and activation of IRF3 and IRF7 both in vitro and in vivo. ectopic expression of MDA-5 was sufficient to induce IFN signaling. genetic ablation of MDA-5 was shown to block the response to poly(I:C) whereas loss of RIG-I abrogated sensing of in vitro transcribed dsRNA. a recent hypothesis is that LGP2 synergizes with MDA-5. it has superior dsRNA binding capacity but reduced signaling efficacy. a future direction would be to dissect the interplay between the three molecules. elucidated using cell-free system that incorporates isolated mitochondria. other work had previously demonstrated role of K63-linked ubiquitin modification in RIG-I signaling. this linkage enhances signaling capacity of target protein. peroxisomal MAVS leads to an early interferon-independent induction of ISGs that requires IRF1. mitochondrial MAVS contributes to the canonical type I IFN response. this signaling was downstream of RIG-I sensing.
