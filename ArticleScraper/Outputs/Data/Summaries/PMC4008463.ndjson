{"summary": "introduction RNA interference (RNAi) mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) is an exciting, new technology with many potential biomedical applications. siRNA targets specific mRNA (mRNA) for enzymatic degradation via association with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) siRNAs have been designed as promising therapies to target human diseases including those caused by viruses3-6 and cancers. onic polymers allow for synthetic modification of structures to enhance transfection efficiencies and reduce cytoxicity. common cationic polymers used for this purpose include poly (l-lysine) PLL15,17-20 and polyethylenimine PEI. poly(ethylene glycol) PEG15,17-21,23,24 is often introduced to improve solubility of the nanoparticle complex. LL(Z)\u2013NCA was prepared by intramolecular ring closure of LL(Z). the hybrid copolymers, protected by Z groups, were then synthesized using successive ring opening polymerization. target copolymers P1, P2, and P3 were obtained. molecular weights of commercial PEG-NH2, NH2-PEG-NH2 and NH2-PPG-PPG-NH2 can be deduced from 1HNMR data18,27. Figure 2.1H NMR spectra of P1-Z, P2-Z, and P3-Z. Characterizations by 1H NMR using DMSO-d-6 as solvent for measurements are shown. water-soluble and cationic copolymers formed polyplexes with siRNA via electrostatic interactions as shown by agarose gel electrophoresis. polyplexes were formed at N/P ratio of 0 (naked siRNA) to 4. cationic copolymers P1 and P2 condense siRNA at an N/P ratio of 4. the diameters of P2 complexes were larger than those of P1 and P3. increasing the N/P ratio of P1 or P2 polymer complexes resulted in larger particles, while increasing the N/P ratio P3 polymer complexes resulted in smaller particles. the small Zeta potential of P3 (20 mV) may improve its affinity to the cells. it is possible that the small Zeta potential of P3 (20 mV) may improve its affinity to the cells and internalization by the cells as compared with the other copolymers tested. cells treated at concentrations of 80 g/ml maintained over 85% viability. but less than 75% when treated with P2. toxicity may be primarily caused by addition of an excess of polymer. neuro 2a/GFP cells were treated with complexes of copolymer P1, P2, and P3 with GFP siRNA at a high N/P ratio of 6, 12, and 24. the cells were treated with different complexes containing a final concentration of 80 nM Cy3-labeled siRNA (red) the knockdown efficiencies when using copolymers P2 and P3 to deliver siRNA were similar to efficiencies observed using LipofectamineTM 2000 lipoplexes. cells were treated with complexes of copolymer P1, P2, and P3 with GFP siRNA at a final concentration of 80 nM siRNA. copolymers were synthesized by intramolecular ring closure of LL(Z)\u2013NCA. the hybrid copolymers were then synthesized using successive ring opening polymerization. the polymer P1 P2 P3 Mn (kD) 10.2 7.9 6.5 a determined by 1HNMR. the CMC of the P1, P2, and P3 copolymers was analyzed by fluorescent spectroscopy using pyrene as a probe. the CMC of the P1, P2, and P3 obtained in this study are 556, 459, and 264 mg/l. polyplexes were further characterized by size and Zeta-potential measurements. the diameters of P1 complexes were 128 nm, 130 nm, and 150 nm for respective N/P ratios of 6, 12, and 24. the diameters of P2 complexes were larger than those of P1 and P3. the Zeta-potentials of P2 complexes range were 44 mv, 46 mv, and 52 mv for respective N/P ratios of 6, 12, and 24. the Zeta-potentials of P2 complexes were greater than those of P1 and P3. Zeta potentials were determined at 25 \u00b0C using the Zetasizer Nano. cytotoxicity of cationic copolymers was evaluated by MTT viability assay in Neuro-2a cells. green fluorescent protein (GFP)-targeted siRNA labeled with a Cy3 fluorescent tag was used to form polyplexes. the cells were transfected with polyplexes composed of the cationic copolymers P1, P2, and P3 with siRNA at N/P ratios of 6, 12, and 24. red fluorescent signal was not detected inside the neuro 2a cells and GFP expression was still very strong. fluorescent microscopy results qualitatively showed major differences in siRNA delivery by the three copolymers. cells were transfected at an equivalent concentration of 80 nM siRNA complexed with the copolymers at an equivalent concentration of 80 nM siRNA complexed with the copolymers at N/P ratios of 6, 12, and 24. copolymers P1, P2, and P3as designed were minimally toxic up to a concentration of 60 g/ml for copolymer P2 and 80 g/ml for copolymers P1 and P3as. compared with P1 and P2, P3 complexes are smaller and denser, and thus may be internalized via endocytosis more readily.
