{"summary": "the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) maintains ER homeostasis by increasing protein-folding capacity, reducing global protein synthesis, and clearing misfolded proteins. three transmembrane proteins are monitored by PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcriptional factor 6 (ATF6) and inositol requiring enzyme 1. the IRE1-XBP1 branch is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans. it splices many mRNA targets destined for translation at the ER. most of the target mRNAs are degraded, but the unconventional splicing of XBP1 mRNA produces a functional transcript that encodes the transcription factor XBP1s. the cellular UPR has been recognized as an intrinsic line among innate defenses. PRRSV has recently been shown to induce the activation of the PERK and IRE1 branches of the UPR in porcine alveolar macrophage cell line ZMAC [41] but the significance of these events for virus replication is unknown. we show that the virus encodes a protein, GP2a, which targets GRP78 for degradation. treatment with the potent ER-stress inducer thapsigargin (TG) resulted in a dramatic increase of GRP78. uninfected cells have the capacity to produce large amounts of this protein. 93FT cells grown on coverslips in six-well plates were transfected to express GP2a-HA. at 24 h post transfection, they were treated with MG-132 (30 M), Bafilomycin A1 (0.5 M), or Z-VAD-FMK (20 M) before being collected for western blot analyses. expression of nonstructural proteins (S1 Fig) and major envelope membrane proteins (S2 Fig) did not decrease GRP78 expression. however, the minor envelope protein GP2a caused a decrease of this protein in about 50% of the cells. this effect could be reversed by treatment of the cells with MG-132. MARC-145 cells were transfected with siRNA targeting GRP78 (siGRP78) or scrambled siRNA (siNC) at 36 h post transfection, the cells were analyzed for UPR activation. pPERK, peIF2a, ATF4, XBP1s, PDI and peIF2a were expressed as fold changes compared to mock-infected control. pPERK, peIF2a, ATF4, XBP1s, ATF6 and PDI were expressed as fold changes. s of virus production in MARC-145 cells and PAMs at an MOI of 0.1. results represent the averages of at least three independent experiments. all siRNAs could effectively silence the expression of the respective protein at 36 h post transfection. infection of these cells with PRRSV revealed a reduction in virus titers. also, overexpression of ATF4 or XBP1s in MARC-145 cells by means of lentivirus transduction significantly increased the virus yields. asterisks indicate statistical significance: NS, no significance; *, P 0.05; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.001; ***, P 0.001. cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were isolated and probed for presence of ATF4 and XBP1s. PRRSV nonstructural proteins nsp2/3 hijack ATF4 to viral replication complexes. at 36 hpi, the cells were treated or untreated with TG (200 nM) for 0.5 h. an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was used to detect subcellular location of ATF4. we found that ATF4 was not within nuclei but was present at perinuclear regions in PRRSV-infected cells. the TG-induced ATF4 nuclear translocation was blocked by PRRSV infection. recruitment of ATF4 to viral RTCs is an early event in PRRSV infection. we found that nsp2 was able to partially retain ATF4 in the cytoplasm. but co-expression with nsp3 dramatically increased retention efficiency. RNAi knockdown of ATF4 greatly reduced the level of total viral RNAs. this correlated well with impaired virus production. RNA levels were analyzed during a single viral replication cycle (i.e., within 12 hours) MARC-145 cells were transfected with an siRNA targeting ATF4 (siATF4) or scrambled siRNA (siNC) at 36 h post transfection, the cells were infected with PRRSV strain JXwn06 at an MOI of 1. abundance of viral RNA was assessed by RT-PCR of ORF7. negative-stranded viral RNA was detected by RNAscope in situ hybridization method. negative-stranded viral RNA was detected by immunostaining. nsp9 and ATF4 were detected by immunostaining. the mechanism of UPR induction by PRRSV was initially focused on GRP78 because it is the master regulator that binds to and negatively controls sensors PERK, ATF6, and IRE1 [7,42]. if levels of misfolded proteins rise, GRP78 is released, resulting in activation of the UPR [7,42], so that the protein folding capacity of the cell can be enhanced. the viral nucleocapsid protein, N, was used as an infection indicator. hek-293FT cells grown on coverslips were transfected to express GP2a-HA. at 24 h post transfection, the cells were collected for western blot analyses. GP2a contributes to the GRP78 decay via proteasomal pathway. proteasomal pathway contributes to reduced levels of GRP78 seen in PRRSV-infected cells. expression of nonstructural proteins (S1 Fig) and the major envelope membrane proteins (S2 Fig) did not decrease GRP78 expression. GP2a but not E protein decreased levels of GRP78. the downstream effectors ATF4 and XBP1s of UPR signaling are activated at an early stage of PRRSV infection. asterisks (*) indicate the statistical significance: ***: P 0.001; ****: P0.0001; NS: no significance. the cells were harvested at the indicated times post infection. the XBP1 mRNA sequence was amplified by RT-PCR followed by digestion with Pst I. the abundance of pPERK, peIF2a, ATF4, XBP1s, ATF6 and PDI were expressed as fold changes compared to mock-infected control. MARC-145 cells or PAMs grown on coverslips in six-well plates were infected with PRRSV strain JXwn06 at an MOI of 0.1. at the indicated times, the cells were fixed, permeablized, and stained with antibodies against ATF4 and nsp2. both ATF4 and XBP1s are critical for PRRSV replication. MARC-145 cells were transduced with lentivirus expressing ATF4-myc, XBP1s-myc, or the empty vector. at 36 h post transduction, the cells were infected with PRRSV. at 24 hpi, the total viral titer in each culture was measured by the end-point dilution assay. the quality of the fractionation was checked by assaying for cytoplasmic GAPDH and nuclear histone subunit H3. in TG-treated cells, this protein was almost exclusively found in the nuclear fraction (compare lanes 5 and 9), but in infected cells, it was almost exclusively found in the cytoplasmic fraction (compare lanes 8 and 12) the data were acquired by Nikon A1 confocal microscope. they represent at least three independent experiments. a mouse isotype antibody used as a control. PRRSV nsp2/3 is sufficient to retain ATF4 in the cytoplasm. nsp3 is known to form heterodimer with nsp2, which is known to form heterodimer with nsp2, dramatically increased the retention efficiency. recruitment of ATF4 is an early event in PRRSV infection. the detection of ATF4 was earlier than observed with Western blots. it is likely that recruitment of ATF4 to viral RTCs is an early event in PRRSV infection. no negative-stranded viral RNAs could be detected in either the control or siATF4-treated cells at 0 hpi. positive-stranded RNA could be detected at 0 hpi due to the input of virions used to start the infection. a gradual, obvious decrease was observed over time. the presence of viral RNA was assayed by RT-qPCR targeting 5\u2019-UTR sequence or (E) GAPDH as a negative control. the fold enrichment of viral RNA was expressed against the GST control. a purified GST-ATF4 or GST were purified from E. coli. chimera, but not GST alone, could pull down viral RNA from purified infected-cell RNA. confocal microscopy of infected cells showed that ATF4 exhibited remarkable co-localization with negative-stranded viral RNA (detected by RNAscope in situ hybridization), as well as the viral polymerase nsp9 in infected cells. PRRSV targets GRP78 for partial proteasomal degradation by viral glycoprotein GP2a. it creates a positive feedback loop to sensitize and potentiate the UPR signaling. the first unexpected finding from this study was the downregulation of GRP78 in a manner that is proteasome dependent. previous studies of how viruses utilize ATF4 have only revealed effects that depend upon its activity as a DNA transcription factor. in the cases of WNV and IBV, ATF4 upregulates transcription factor CHOP to induce apoptosis and virus release. nsp2/3 recruited to viral RTCs to promote viral replication. this protein was depleted with siRNAs, causing the accumulation of viral RNA. this is unlike host RNA helicase DDX1, which is relocated to the cytoplasm in coronavirus infections. IRE1 is activated in infected cells, consistent with two previous reports. the downstream effector XBP1s is important for virus replication. XBP1s may be important for regulation of autophagy. apoptosis through IRE1-ASK pathway, autophagy, lipid synthesis. findings provide further insight into mechanisms by which PRRSV interacts with cellular pathways. results also identify potentially druggable targets (ATF4 and XBP1s) and provide new information for making attenuated vaccines to control PRRSV. previous studies of how viruses utilize ATF4 have only revealed effects that depend upon its activity as a DNA transcription factor. in the cases of WNV and IBV, ATF4 upregulates transcription factor CHOP to induce apoptosis and virus release. the effect seems to be equal on the accumulation of all viral RNA species at the transcriptional level. this is unlike host RNA helicase DDX1, which is relocated to the cytoplasm in coronavirus infections. further evidence supporting the association of ATF4 with the replication machinery of PRRSV includes its interaction with viral RNA in pulldown assays. ire1-mediated RIDD and JNK pathways, autophagy, ERAD, and lipid synthesis through activation of XBP1s. ire1-ASK pathway is activated in infected cells, consistent with two previous reports. XBP1s may be important for regulation of autophagy. cellular pathways reveal a novel paradigm for how pathogens can repurpose components UPR for their own use. our results also identify potentially druggable targets (ATF4 and XBP1s) and provide new information for making attenuated vaccines to control PRRSV.
