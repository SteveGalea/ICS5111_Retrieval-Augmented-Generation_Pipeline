{"summary": "in 2006 there was an unparalleled large-scale outbreak of the so-called high fever disease in most provinces of china that affected more than 2,000,000 pigs. in march 2007 the disease was identified in the Hai Duong province of Vietnam and spread countrywide affecting more than 65,000 pigs. the outbreaks caused extensive concern worldwide [7]. real-time RT-PCR has been developed for assaying the HP-PRRSV and PRRSV. but it is not able to differentially detect the HP-PRRSV and PRRSV. two methods provided alternative diagnostic assays in diverse PRRSV epidemiological circumstances. region was selected to design an assay for discriminating between HP-PRRSV and PRRSV strains. the differential detection based on real-time RT-PCR using SYBR Premix Ex Taq was performed using the same primer pair. amplification conditions were 95\u00b0C for 10 s followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 5 s and 60\u00b0C for 40 s. fluorescent signal was detected for each cycle at the end of 60\u00b0C extension step. positive and negative reference samples were detected along with unknown samples. conventional RT-PCR was performed by using the NSP2-F and NSP2-R primers described in Table 1. 10 L reaction mixture contains 0.5 L cDNA, 5.0 L 2 PCR reaction mix, 0.4 L NSP2-F (10 M) primer, 0.4 L NSP2-R (10 M) primer, 0.1 L Taq DNA polymerase (2.5 U/L), and 3.6 L H2O. negative controls included the reagents without cDNA template. 39 and 477 serum samples were obtained from 6 pig farms in south china in 2008 and 2011 respectively. the viral RNA of the virus-infected cell culture and serum was extracted by using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (Qiagen) cDNA was synthesized using the extracted total RNA and AMV Reverse Transcriptase from Reverse Transcription System of Promega. al RT-PCR NSP2-F AACACCCAGGCGACTTCA 787 874 NSP2-R GCATGTCAACCCTATCCCAC Real-time RT-PCR NSP2-qF. amplification was performed in a 10 L reaction mixture containing 5.0 L SYBR Premix Ex Taq (2), 0.2 L of each forward (NSP2-qF) and reverse (NSP2-qR) primer (10M), 1.5 L cDNA or plasmid the 10 L duplex TaqMan probe real-time PCR reaction mixtures contained 5.0 L Premix Ex Taq (2) (TaKaRa), 0.2 L of each forward (NSP2-qF) and reverse (NSP2-qR) primer (10 M), 0.2 L of each probe (Pb-H and Pb-N or Pb-all and Pb-N, 10 M), 1.5 L cDNA or plasmid DNA, and 2.7 L H2O. the PCR products were detected by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis in 1 TAE. then the PCR products were cloned into the plasmid pMD20-T (TaKaRa) and propagated in competent Escherichia coli DH5 cells according to manufacturer's instructions. amplification curves were observed when HP-PRRSV and PRRSV were used as templates. fluorescent curves were observed when HP-PRRSV (GD) and PRRSV (CH-1a) were used as templates; no fluorescent signals were observed when the templates were other viruses and host cells. when Pb-H (FAM) and Pb-N (HEX) probes were combined in a duplex real-time PCR system, only the FAM fluorescent signal could be observed in the template of GD HP-PRRSV strain. however, when Pb-N (HEX) and Pb-all (HEX) were combined in a duplex real-time PCR system, only the FAM fluorescent signal could be observed when the template was CH-1a PRRSV strain. the results of the specificity test of the two methods showed that there were no cross-amplifications from other viruses or host cells. 10-fold serially diluted plasmid standards of HP-PRRSV (pMD20-GD) and PRRSV (pMD20-CH1a) were used as templates for sensitivity tests in both conventional PCR and real-time PCR. real-time PCR using both SYBR Green I and TaqMan probe could be used to simultaneously detect and differentiate HP-PRRSV and PRRSV in China. but the conventional RT-PCR was the lowest detection rate. Kleiboeker et al. developed dual labeled probes quantitative PCR. this assay could simultaneously detect NA- and EU-PRRSV. but this assay could not simultaneously detect and differentiate between both HP-PRRSV and classical North American type PRRSV (PRRSV) strains in china. amplification with primers NSP2-qF and NSP2-qR yielded 85 bp and 172 bp amplified product within NSP2 of both HP-PRRSV and PRRSV respectively. standard curves were generated based on Cp values of 10-fold dilutions of plasmid DNA. the input concentrations of HP-PRRSV (a) and PRRSV (b) plasmid DNA in real-time RT-PCR detected using SYBR Green I and HP-PRRSV (c) and PRRSV (d) using TaqMan probe. only the HEX fluorescent signal could be observed in the template of GD HP-PRRSV strain. however, when Pb-N (HEX) and Pb-all (HEX) probes were combined in a duplex real-time PCR system, only the FAM fluorescent signal could be observed when the template was CH-1a PRRSV strain. 10-fold serially diluted plasmid standards of HP-PRRSV (pMD20-GD) and PRRSV (pMD20-CH1a) were used as templates for sensitivity tests in both conventional PCR and real-time PCR using SYBR Green I and TaqMan probe. results showed that real-time PCR using both SYBR Green I and TaqMan probe can be used to detect concentrations at least 100 copies/L of plasmid standards. s/L) n Intra-assay (Cp) Mean SD CV (%) HP-PRRSV (SYBR) 106 3 14.96 0.02 0.13 14.82 0.29 1.96 104 3 21.78 0.04 0.18 21.49 0.57 2.65 102 3 28.5 0.16 0.16 0.56 28.48 0.27 0.95 PRRSV (SYBR) Kleiboeker et al. developed dual labeled probes quantitative PCR. this assay could simultaneously detect NA- and EU-PRRSV. however, this assay could not simultaneously detect and differentiate between both HP-PRRSV and classical North American type PRRSV. a total of 535 samples were tested by real-time PCR and conventional RT-PCR. the real-time RT-PCR developed based on SYBR Green and TaqMan probe could be used for simultaneous detection and differentiation of HP-PRRSV and PRRSV."}
