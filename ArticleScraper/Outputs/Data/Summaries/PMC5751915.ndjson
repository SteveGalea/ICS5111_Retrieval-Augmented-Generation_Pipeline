{"summary": "the international committee on taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) defined a universal taxonomic scheme for all the viruses. according to the ICTV scheme, viral classification starts at the highest level of order and continues as follows: order, family, subfamily, genus, and species. alignment-free methods are based on the statistics of oligomers frequency and associated with a fixed-length segment, known as k-mers. the natural vector method is an alignment-free approach. the 12-dimemsional natural vector of S is defined as ( n A, n C, n G, n T, A, C, G, T, D A 2, D C 2, D G 2, D T 2 ),8,10 where n = i = 1 n w ( s i ) / n is a scaled variance of positions of letter. if a viral genome contains more than one nucleotide sequence, known as multiple-segmented, then each nucleotide sequence is represented by a natural vector. according to the distance matrix, we find the nearest neighbor of each virus, i.e., the virus that has the smallest distance to it. in 2013, we proposed 12-dimensional natural vectors for classifying all single-segmented viruses. the error rates of classifying Baltimore labels were below 0.01% for Baltimore I, II, IV, V, and VII. the error rates of classifying family labels were 0 for Baltimore II, III, V, VI, and VII. we successfully predicted 21 missing labels of viruses. each viral nucleotide sequence is analyzed and converted into a unique 12-dimensional natural vector. the distance between 2 viral genomes based on natural vectors successfully reflects their biological distance. the distance between 2 viral genomes based on natural vectors is one to one. the online inquiry system at VirusDB facilitates the broad scientific user community with the natural vector method. a Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP solution is applied. web interface design overview The structure of Web interface of whole system consists of 8 parts: Home, About, Content, Submit Sequence, Get Result, Current Collection, FAQ, and Contact Us. Virus classification system includes submit Sequences and Get Result. the system would predict whether the query virus is in the Baltimore class or not. it will calculate the corresponding natural vector as well as the distances between the submitted sequence and the viruses in VirusDB. only when the distance between the reference virus and its nearest neighbor is smaller than 75%, we will make the prediction that this virus belongs to the same class as its nearest neighbor. each viral nucleotide sequence is analyzed and converted into a unique 12-dimensional natural vector. the distance between 2 viral genomes based on natural vectors successfully reflects their biological distance. the distance between 2 viral genomes based on natural vectors is one to one. if the virus is single segmented, some integer larger than 1 if the virus is multiple segmented. a Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP solution is applied. web interface design overview The structure of Web interface of whole system consists of 8 parts: Home, About, Content, Submit Sequence, Get Result, Current Collection, FAQ, and Contact Us. Virus classification system includes submit Sequences and Get Result. if no label is chosen, the calculation would be done within the Baltimore class. code to ensure human requiring, it will calculate the corresponding natural vector as well as the distances between the submitted sequence and the viruses in VirusDB. only when the distance between the reference virus and its nearest neighbor is smaller than 75% of the distances in the family, we will make the prediction that this virus belongs to the same class as its nearest neighbor. automatic database updating refers to retrieving latest sequences from GenBank and recalculating the natural vectors and its associated distances with other viruses. automatic database updating refers to retrieving latest sequences from GenBank and recalculating the natural vectors and its associated distances with other viruses. in 2016, we constructed a 60-dimensional protein space to analyze the evolutionary relationships of 4021 viruses by whole proteomes in the NCBI Reference Sequence Database. the accuracy for randomly chosen 351 viruses data set can reach 95.4%, whereas the k-mer can only get 71.2% accuracy (k = 6 as the optimal) this inspires us to add the proteome information into our system."}
