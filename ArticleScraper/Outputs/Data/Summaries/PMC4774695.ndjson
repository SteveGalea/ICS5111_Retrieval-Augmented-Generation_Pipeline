{"summary": "recombinant human adenovirus type 5 expressing foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) capsid protein genes and full-length 2B, 3B and 3Cpro were generated and amplified in HEK-293 cells. the titer of the recombinant adenoviruses was approximately 108, 109.5 and 1011 TCID50/ml. recombinant adenoviruses expressing capsid proteins of the FMDV O/IND/R2/75 were constructed and produced in high titers. a decrement of up to 10-fold at 4\u00b0C and 21-fold at 37\u00b0C was recorded in the virus titers during 60 h incubation period. FMD is characterized by formation of vesicles on the feet, buccal mucosa and mammary glands, and drooling of saliva in the form of string. the affected animals retain the virus in their oro-pharynx and may act as a carrier for the disease transmission to the susceptible animals. the disease is caused by the serotypes O, A, and Asia-1. the serotype O is the most prevalent (93.3%). the disease is controlled by vaccination in developing countries while developed countries follow stamping out policy. the hAd5 carrying FMDV capsid genes has been tested in mice [17,25], guinea pigs [26], swine [17,26] and cattle [27] to protect them from homologous challenge virus. the hAd5 containing full length 2B has been reported to induce a rapid and increased FMDV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified CO2 incubator. construction of the expression cassettes Viral RNA (FMDV O/IND/R2/75) was isolated by RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and converted into cDNA using Thermoscript RT (Invitrogen, USA) the genes of interest (P1-2AB, 3BCwt and 3BCm) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers all the PCR products were purified by PCR purification kit (Fermentas, USA) all the gene segments mentioned above were digested with SpeI enzyme (NEB, USA) either the 3BCwt or 3BCm was ligated to P1-2AB by T4 DNA ligase. top 10 cells were cloned into pShuttle-CMV vector. recombinant pShuttle vectors are kanamycin resistant and grow on LB agar. non-recombinant top 10 cells die out of GOI. the recombinant pShuttle-CMV vectors were linearized with PmeI enzyme (NEB, USA) the transformed BJ5183-AD-1 cells were grown on LB agar containing kanamycin (50 g/ml) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18 h. plasmids were amplified in top10 cells growing in Teriffic broth. the cells were re-suspended in phosphate buffer saline (DPBS) containing Ca++ and Mg++ and freeze-thawed thrice to release the virus. then the virus-cell suspension was centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min. supernatant containing the virus was collected and stored at 80\u00b0C. adenovirus serial 10-fold dilutions of the virus were prepared in culture media. 100 l of each dilution was added to 10 wells of a 96 well tissue culture plate. the plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C in CO2 incubator for 10 days. hek-293 cell monolayer grown in 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks (Nunc) was infected separately with the recombinant adenoviruses or non-recombinant replication-defective human adenovirus 5 (dAd5) the cells were harvested at 0 h (immediately after adsorption) and at every 12 h intervals post infection up to 5 days and frozen at 80\u00b0C. the human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cell line (# 240085, Agilent Technologies, USA) was grown in Eagle\u2019s minimum essential medium (# 12-611Q, Lonza, Belgium) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 25mM HEPES, non-essential amino acids (Lonza, Belgium), penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 g/ml) the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0 the amplification of above two segments was carried out with initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C/5 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C/30 s, annealing at 58\u00b0C/30 s and extension at 72\u00b0C/30 s. all the PCR products were purified by PCR purification kit (Fermentas, USA) recombinant pShuttle vectors were cloned into pShuttle-CMV vector. top 10 cells were spread-plated on LB powder containing kanamycin. non-recombinant top 10 cells die out. the integrity of GOI was checked by PCR and RE digestion. the sequencing of the target genes was carried out in an automated DNA Sequencer (Perkin Elmer, USA) the recombinant pShuttle-CMV vectors were linearized with PmeI enzyme (NEB, USA) transfection of HEK-293 cells with adenovirus plasmids was performed by using Virapack Transfection Kit (#200488, Agilent Technologies, USA) the transfected cells were observed daily up to 10 days for the appearance of virus induced plaques. the cells were re-suspended in phosphate buffer saline (DPBS) containing Ca++ and Mg++. Rabbit anti-FMDV serotype O serum was used to probe expressed FMDV antigen followed by washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST) the cells were then stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000 diluted in PBS) the clarified cell lysate containing the adenovirus was layered on CsCl discontinuous gradient and centrifuged at 23000 rpm for 2 h in an ultracentrifuge. in second step, the adenovirus obtained after discontinuous gradient purification was subjected to continuous gradient centrifugation at 23000 rpm at 15\u00b0C for 20 h for further purification and concentration. in mutagenic PCR, two fragments of size 404 bp and 537 bp were amplified. the expression cassettes (3,656 bp) were found intact in recombinant pSH-CMV vectors (pSH-CMV/P1-2AB3BCwt and P1-2AB3BCm) smaller segment represents the cloning of the gene of interest. small colonies, being potential recombinants, were tested for GOI by colony PCR. the adenovirus hAd5/P1-2AB3BCwt was generated 5-day post transfection. the expression of FMD capsid proteins was detected in indirect immunofluorescence assay.
