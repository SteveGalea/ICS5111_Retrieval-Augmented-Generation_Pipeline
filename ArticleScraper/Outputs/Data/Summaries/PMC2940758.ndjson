{"summary": "arenaviruses are enveloped viruses with a bisegmented negative single-strand RNA genome. each RNA segment contains two open reading frames in mutually opposite orientations. the RNA encodes the viral nucleoprotein (NP; 63 kDa) and glycoprotein precursor (GPC; 75 kDa) the two RNA genomes are encapsidated by the NP. the NP is the most abundant protein in virions and infected cells. the mRNA molecules have a non-polyadenylated 3\u2032-end. both domains L1 and L3 interact with the Z protein [21]. the domain is able to bind nucleotides, with a preference for UTP, and RNA. expression and purification of such a large viral polymerase is problematic and has not been documented. encoding aa residues 1 to 250 for the N-terminal end of four arenavirus (PIRV), Lassa fever virus (LASV), parana virus (PARV) and LCMV) L proteins. the construct was expressed in E.coli and purified, but yielded well-diffracting crystals. the LCMV NL1 monomer structure has approximate dimensions of 59 37 27. it features four mixed -strands forming a twisted plane surrounded by seven -helices. helix 3 is surrounded at its extremity by two N-terminal (1 and 2) and C-terminal helices (6 and 7) the Tt1808 hypothetical protein from Thermus Thermophilus HB88 (PDB code 1WDJ, Z-score 3.8, r.m.s.d. 3.4 for 81 aa) and the restriction endonuclease SdaI (PDB code 2IXS, Z-score 3.6, r.m.s.d. 6.3 for 104 aa) are also recovered. key residues from the endonuclease active site (PD, E/D, and K) are schematically depicted by colored dots and labelled. the -sheet forms a negatively charged cavity creating a binding site for divalent cations. the C-terminal end of helix 5 forms a positively charged patch and a concave surface. a structural superimposition of the arenavirus NL1 and influenza PAN active sites shows that the side-chains of three evolutionary-conserved residues closely superimpose with P88, D89 and E102. NL1 was crystallized without metal ions and a water molecule is found close to the position that should be occupied by the divalent metal. no close structural match is found for H41 nor K134 of the influenza virus PAN. the two Mn2+ ions present in the PAN structure are shown as light green spheres with their closest ligand indicated by a dashed line. the carbonyl main-chain of PAN I120 and NL1 C103 are shown in sticks. Bunyaviridae is the other family of virus to possess a segmented negative-strand RNA genome. the putative endonuclease catalytic motif of Nairovirus is much larger (4000 aa) than the L protein of other members of the Bunyaviridae family (2200 aa). the NL1-like domain is more closely related to LCMV NL1 than are the TOMV and CCGV. the ability of NL1 to bind nucleotides was investigated using UV-crosslink experiments. the crystal structure relatedness to the endonuclease fold would suggest that the NL1 domain is able to bind RNA rather than nucleotides. NL1 is able to cleave ssRNA having no stable secondary structure at specific sites indicating a preference for the presence of uracil (Figure 4A, B) a moderately stable RNA hairpin containing uracil (G = 3.4 kcal/mole) is cleaved down to a 14/15-mer product. polyU RNA is cleaved randomly down to a 8-mer product with a better efficiency than poly onuclease domain was prepared according to bio-informatic predictions. the enzymes were equally active using short RNA substrates. NL1 is 90-fold more active in the presence of Mn2+ than Mg2+. LCMV enzymes prefer adenosine- and uracil-containing sites. divalent cation assay was run during 45 min without intermediate points. Tm is the melting temperature of NL1 with the divalent ions. Mutational analysis of NL1 domain on the endonuclease activity. the mini-replicon system contains all trans-acting factors (L protein and NP) required for transcription and replication of a genome analogue containing Renilla luciferase as a reporter gene (mini-genome) it contains all trans-acting factors (L protein and NP) required for transcription and replication of a genome analogue containing Renilla luciferase as a reporter gene. antigenome signals in Northern blots were quantified via intensity profiles (wild-type = 100%) 5 RNA signals in Northern blots were quantified and the mRNA-to-antigenome signal ratio was calculated. methylene blue-stained 28S rRNA is shown below the blots as a marker for gel loading and RNA transfer. phenotype of mutants E41A, E41Q, K44A, S54A, C60A, T108S, F116A, D142N, and W155A is similar to that of wild-type. cDNA constructs encoding aa residues 1 to 250 for the N-terminal end of four arenavirus (Pirital virus), Lassa fever virus (LASV), parana virus (LCMV) L proteins. the construct was expressed in E.coli and purified, but yielded crystals diffracting to 8. the homologous 196 residues domain of LCMV yielded well-diffracting crystals. the structure was refined using a native data set at 2.13 resolution (Table 1). two NL1 molecules are present within the asymmetric unit. Residues 1\u2013191 are visible for one molecule while only 1\u2013175 could be modelled for the other NL1 molecule owing to high mobility of the C-terminal end of helix 7. helix 3 is surrounded at its extremity by two N-terminal (1 and 2) and C-terminal helices (6 and 7) on the opposite side of the -sheet, helix 3 is surrounded at its extremity by two N-terminal (1 and 2) and C-terminal helices (6 and 7) side-chains for residues within the NL1 endonuclease active site are shown as red sticks and labelled. arrow indicates the putative RNA binding groove and the active site crevice. negative charges are in red and positive charges in blue and neutral in white. both NL1 and PAN share a similar core structure. NL1 shares the conserved active site sequence motif characteristic of type II endonucleases. corresponding residues are P88, D89...E102, or either K115 or K122. NL1 C103 main-chain carbonyl superimposes quite well with PAN I120 main-chain carbonyl. the triad made of K115, D119, and K122 in NL1 is spatially equivalent to K134 in PAN. bunyaviruses and Bunyaviridae share a conserved RdRp motif within their large L protein, as well as a conserved N-terminus domain. the PD catalytic motif was located after aa 700, the N-terminal of Nairovirus L protein being assigned as a so-called OTU-like domain. PUMV, HLCV and RVFV NL1-like domains are more closely related to LCMV NL1 than are the TOMV and CCGV. LCMV NL1-like domain contains 6 -strands and shares the PD motif just upstream the first -strand, whereas it is just upstream the second -strand in the case of NL1 and PAN. the band shift assay is judged by degradation products at the bottom of the gel under the labeled RNA oligo. NL1 is able to cleave ssRNA having no stable secondary structure at specific sites indicating a preference for the presence of uracil (Figure 4A, B), and adenosine to a lesser extent. polyU RNA is cleaved randomly down to a 8-mer product with a better efficiency than polyA, whereas polyC is not a substrate for NL1. a 5\u2032-capped RNA of 264 nucleotides in length also acts as a substrate. this indicates that the cap structure does not seem to be a direct RNA binding determinant. a, Nucleotide sequence of the radiolabelled RNA used for activity assays. the * indicates the radiolabelled nucleotide. the most drastic effect was observed. a double mutant D89A/E102A shows further reduced but not abolished activity. a double mutant D89A/E102A shows further reduced but not abolished activity. a double mutant D89A/E102A shows further reduced but not abolished activity.

Mean of 2 independent transfection experiments. 4 antigenome signals in Northern blots were quantified via intensity profiles. mutants E41A, E41Q, K44A, S54A, C60A, T108S, F116A, D142N, and Y183A express luciferase and RNA at high level, but the steady-state level of mRNA relative to that of antigenome is reduced by about 50%. the most interesting phenotype is observed with mutants D89A, D89N, E102A, E102N, D119A, D119N, arenavirus NL1 nuclease is an RNA endonuclease domain of influenza virus. domain is an RNA endonuclease. it is in line with the recent discovery of the PAN endonuclease domain of influenza virus. the presence of water molecules and previous structural models for influenza PAN allows to propose putative positions of metal ions. the first step in the general mechanism for phosphodiester hydrolysis is the preparation of the attacking nucleophile by deprotonation. there are no indications against D119 being this general base. the influenza PAN histidine 41 is involved in binding the nucleobase of the presumed incoming RNA substrate. the NL1 endonuclease does not share the same sequence specificity, and the NL1 endonuclease does not share the same sequence specificity. the cap structure does not seem to be a direct RNA binding determinant. RNA caps subsequently used by a large primer-dependent RNA polymerase. it seems more plausible that the L gene has evolved by divergence over time. a single crystal structure of a functional arenavirus protein is currently available, that of the Machupo virus glycoprotein GP1. cell pellets from harvested cultures were resuspended in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 0.1% Triton, 5% Glycerol. Lysozyme (0.25 mg/ml), PMSF (1 mM), DNase I (2 g/ml), and EDTA free protease cocktail (Roche) were added before sonication. crystallization Crystals grew in LiSO4 250 mM, citrate 50 mM, isopropanol 5.5%. cryoprotected by dipping in a solution containing 65% of crystallization buffer and 35% of a buffer made of size exclusion chromatography buffer/glycerol. the structure was refined with BUSTER and COOT using this data set. the atomic coordinates have been deposited at the PDB (3JSB) the reaction mixtures were exposed to UV light (254 nm) for 6 min at 5 mm distance. the crosslinked species were separated in a 15% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. endonuclease assays were carried out using 3.3 M of radio-labeled RNA in a buffer containing 40 mM Tris-base, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM -Mercaptoethanol and 2 mM MnCl2.
