{"summary": "the high prevalence of dengue in Taiwan and the consecutive large dengue outbreaks in the period 2014\u20132015 suggest that current control interventions are suboptimal. Objectives We developed a framework to measure season-based health burden risk from 2001 to 2014. the high prevalence of dengue in southern Taiwan and the consecutive large dengue outbreaks in the period 2014\u20132015 suggest current control strategies are suboptimal. mathematical models are useful tools in controlling infectious disease. the parameter of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) estimates the amount of time, ability, or activity of an individual lost because of disease-induced disability or death. it is estimated, on average, 115.3 (range 6.3\u2013934.3) DALYs per million population annually were lost to dengue for the period 1998\u20132014 in Taiwan. the monthly minimum (Tmin), maximum (Tmax) and mean (Tmean) temperatures are defined as the lowest, highest, and averaged daily temperatures of a specific month. Kaohsiung, located in southern Taiwan with a typical tropical climate, is a major dengue epidemic area with >50% confirmed dengue cases each year. the susceptible-exposed infectious recovery compartmentalized disease transmission model was implemented to simulate the dengue virus transmission within human populations. to account for the impact of temperature on the epidemics of vector\u2013host interactive dynamics, we selected three temperature-dependent parameters including larvae survival proportion (SL), extrinsic incubation rate (m), and female mosquito death rate (m) h represents transmission potency of dengue virus in the vector\u2013host dynamic model constituted with transmissibility of dengue from mosquito to human (Rmh) and from human to mosquito populations. an average R0 of 1 implies that the disease is in endemic equilibrium. disabilities are then classified into six categories or grades, with each grade allocated a scalar value weighting between 0 and 1. the lower the value, the less impact the disability has on a person\u2019s life. the optimal model was selected based on the least squares criterion from a set of linear and nonlinear models provided by TableCurve 3D packages. DALYs was selected to represent the health burden caused by dengue epidemics and outbreaks in the risk assessment. i represents control efficacy of different control strategies, and h and J are integers. we then defined and estimated for dengue as = EIP+EIP, (4) where EIP and IIP represent extrinsic and intrinsic incubation periods. temperatures are defined as the lowest, highest, and averaged daily temperatures of a specific month. Kaohsiung is a major dengue epidemic area with >50% confirmed dengue cases each year. host interactive dynamics selected three temperature-dependent parameters including larvae survival proportion (SL), extrinsic incubation rate (m), and female mosquito death rate (m) for mosquito populations based on previously published studies to construct temperature-basic reproduction number (R0) profile. an average R0 of 1 implies that the disease is in endemic equilibrium. each parameter was defined with an optimally fitted distribution. temperature-dependent R0 was then assigned as the integrated forecast of each defined parameter distribution. disabilities are then classified into six categories or grades. each grade allocated a scalar value weighting between 0 and 1. the lower the value, the less impact the disability has on a person\u2019s life. epidemics in the period 2001\u20132014, seasons including summer (June\u2013August), fall (September\u2013November), and winter (December\u2013February) were selected since there were none or only sporadic dengue cases occurring in spring (March\u2013May). DALYs was selected to represent the health burden caused by dengue epidemics and outbreaks in the risk assessment. h and J are integers based on the algorithm in estimating,1,2,18. we then defined and estimated for dengue as = EIP+EIP. the total infectious period of dengue existing in both mosquito and human populations can be expressed as the summation of IIP and EIP. the highest monthly temperature was 38.01\u00b0C in September 2008, whereas the lowest temperature was 7.24\u00b0C in March 2009. the estimated monthly burden of dengue was less than 1,325 DALYs in the period 2001\u20132014. results showed that in the interval of 10\u00b0C\u201335\u00b0C, the extrinsic incubation rate increased with temperature (Figure 3A). by contrast, an opposite result was found in the female mosquito death rate, which decreased with elevated temperature between 10\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C and subsequently increased slightly after 20\u00b0C. mSL (T) Nh S L ( T ) = 4 89.41 exp ( ( ( T 24.14 ) / 4.33 ) (T1) m j Extrinsic incubation rate (d1) m ( T ) = 0.02 + 4.39 10 6 T 3 (T2) m k Female mosquito death rate (d1) m ( T ) = 0.15 + 0.004 T + 2.03 T (T3) i SL(T) was estimated from Ruiz-Moreno et al.29 j Estimated based on Focks.5 k Estimated based on Yang et al.28 Abbreviations: LN, lognormal; gm, geometric mean; gsd, geometric SD. Figure 4 demonstrates the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis result for contribution of simultaneous variation in each parameter to the variance of temperature-derived R0. the optimally fitted models and associated parameter values were listed in Table 3. Results highlighted that the R0 and DALYs increased with temperature but turned to decline at a specific temperature. summer had the lowest DALYs with the estimated range from 0.78 at 17\u00b0C to 248.27 at 29\u00b0C.

TS has the lowest variation in temperature estimates of 29.16\u00b0C. DALYs estimates were more likely (ER=0.8), likely (ER=0.5), and less likely (ER =0.2) to be 127 (95% CI: 91\u2013163), 148 (115\u2013181), and 419 (358\u2013479), respectively. DALYs estimates were more likely (ER=0.8), likely (ER=0.5), and less likely (ER =0.2) to be. this study only considered the highest control efficacy of individual and combined control measures in which efficacies were 0.4 (W), 0.42 (C), 0.51 (S), and 0.98 (R), respectively. control measure effectiveness was estimated based on combinations of different control efficacies for varied seasons. a dengue-mosquito-human transmission model was integrated with the concept of DALYs to estimate the temperature-varied R0 and dengue disease burden. the extrinsic incubation rate (m) can be an index of mosquito vector competence and is deeply dependent on temperature change. disseminated infection on A. aegypti was similar to A. abopictus,39. temperature change on virus-disseminated infection may be species specific. temperature-dependent virus dissemination should be incorporated into extrinsic incubation rate to quantify dengue virus transmission dynamics precisely. people aged 60\u201369 years had a relatively higher prevalence rate of dengue fever than those in the other age groups in the period 2010\u20132014. the more elderly population (aged over 70 years) had the highest rate in 2015 (309 per 100,000 population) 98.7% protection from bites from female A. aegypti and 99.8% from female C. quinquefasciatus. future research should investigate length of use and specific mosquito species to develop repellent spray formulations."}
