{"summary": "human anti-VEEV single chain Fragments variable (scFv) were isolated for the first time from a human nave antibody gene library using optimized selection processes. the selected antibody fragments will improve the fast identification of VEEV in case of a biological warfare or terroristic attack. VEEV is classified as bioterrorism agent Category B by the center of disease control (CDC) VEEV causes disease symptoms ranging from mild febrile reactions to fatal encephalitic zoonoses. monospecific diagnostic monoclonal antibodies are either hardly available on the market or too expensive for extensive use. antibody phage display is a promising method to generate recombinant antibodies against human pathogenic viruses like VEEV. using antibody phage display, genotype and phenotype of an antibody fragment are linked by fusing the antibody gene fragment to the minor coat protein III gene of the filamentous bacteriophage M13. representative phage clones were assessed for their ability to bind VEEV TC83 immobilized onto 96 microwell plates. bindings of scFv phage to VEEV-specific capture antibodies mAb 8747 and mAb VEE-WIS without and with an non-specific antigen, like lysozyme, were determined. soluble scFvs instead of scFv phage minimized false positives. inactivated VEEV particles were used to ensure that antibodies selected on active VEEV particles bound inactivated virus, too. this effect was enhanced if VEEV particles were directly coated onto the wells and not captured by antibodies. IGHD2-8*02 IGHJ5*02 IGLV3-1*01 IGLJ3*01 CHN24-2-A2 IGHV3-9*01 IGHD6-19*01 IGHJ3*02 IGHD6-19*01 IGHJ3*02 IGLV3-1*01 IGLJ1*01 CHN24-2-B7 IGHV1-18*01 IGLV2-14*04 IGLJ3*02 IGLV3-1*01 scFv phage preparations showed a nearly equal and efficient display of scFv antibodies on their surface. immunoblot analysis allows to compare the cognate ELISA, Western blot and immunohistochemistry results. scFv phage clones and corresponding scFv-Fc fusion proteins were compared. scFv phage clones were able to bind directly immobilized VEEV particles. scFv phage concentration increased when using very high scFv phage particle concentrations. the scFv-Fc were detected using goat anti-human antibody conjugated with HRP (1:20000) the scFv-Fc were detected using c fusion protein dilutions. ELISA on directly immobilized active VEEV particles. anti-VEEV scFv phage and scFv-Fc fusions were prepared at 56\u00b0C under non-reducing conditions and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. the epitopes recognized by the scFv phage and scFv-Fc fusions are likely to be conformation dependent. Western blots were stained with 1 g/mL scFv-Fc and murine anti-VEEV IgG (1:1000) and detected with goat anti-human (gamma chain specific) AP (1:5000), or goat anti-mouse (Fc specific) AP (1:10000), respectively. VEEV VRS samples were prepared at 56\u00b0C under non-reducing conditions. VEEV strains TC83, 230 and H12/93 were captured by using anti-VEEV mAb VEE-WIS1 (VERO VEEWIS1) or by a mAb mix consisting of mAb 3/4, mAb 12/2 and mAb VEE-WIS1 (VERO mAb mix) some virus strains (VEE-230) were captured better than others (VEE-H12/93) incubation with mAb anti-M13 conjugated with HRP (1:5000) the IIB6 scFv phage was used as negative control. all VEEV antigens were employed with a nearly similar TCID50/mL of 3 108 to 1 109. VEEV antigen was detected by using 1 109 (cfu) scFv phage per well followed by an incubation with mAb anti-M13 conjugated with HRP (1:5000). VEEV antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry in TC83 infected and formaldehyde fixed Vero cells. all scFv clones, except for clone CHN24-2-A1, showed a specific cytoplasmic immunostaining of VEEV infected Vero cells. the human naive scFv antibody gene library HAL4/7 was used to generate antibody fragments reactive to members of the VEE virus serocomplex. the vaccine strain, TC83, as a medically important and epizootic Alphavirus species was used as antigen non-infected vero cells (Vero VRS), 1:2 diluted supernatant of non-infected VERO cells (Vero SN), 0.5 g of each anti-VEEV capture mAb 8747 and VEE-WIS1, 1 g lysozyme. the bound scFv phage were detected using mAb anti-M13 conjugated with HRP (1:5000). single clones were isolated from the third panning round isolated scFv fragments contained the antigen-binding variable domains of the light chains LV1, 2, 3 and 6. the heavy chains of the isolated scFvs belonged to the subfamily HV1, 3 and 4, while HV1 predominated. scFv phage clones were subjected to immunoblot analysis. scFv clones were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. clones were subjected to immunoblot analysis. scFv phage per lane were separated on a reducing 10% SDS-PAGE. Western blot followed by detection of wildtype pIII or scFv::pII fusion using mouse mAb anti-pIII (1:2000) and goat anti-mouse HRP (1:5000). a selection of seven anti-VEEV scFv phage clones and their corresponding scFv-Fc fusions scFv-Fc fusion proteins were used for VEEV detection. antigen: 1 g VRS purified VEEV particles or 1 g VRS concentrated supernatant from non-infected Vero cells as control. anti-VEEV scFv phage/mL were used for the specific detection of structural proteins. the samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a PVDF membrane and stained. none of the isolated scFv phages are conformation dependent. western blots were stained with 1 g/mL scFv-Fc and murine anti-VEEV IgG (1:1000) and detected with goat anti-human (gamma chain specific) AP (1:5000) or goat anti-human (gamma chain specific) AP (1:10000) anti-VEEV mAb 8/6, mAb VEE-WIS1, mAb 12/2 and mAb 42/2 were used for the group specific detection of Alphaviruses. all viral antigens were captured by either the VEEV-specific mAb VEEV-WIS1 or a mAb mixture of anti-Alphavirus antibodies. some virus strains (VEE-230) were captured better than others (VEE-H12/93) mAb mix consisting of mAb 3/4, mAb 12/2 and mAb VEE-WIS1 (VERO mAb mix) A. Staining with biotinylated anti-VEEV mAb 8/6 (1:10000), mAb VEE-WIS1 (1:10000), mAb 12/2 (1:5000) and mAb 42/2 (1:2000) followed by streptavidin-HRP (1:4000) incubation maximum binding in the antigen sandwich ELISA was found for the Russian strain VEEV 230. none of the selected anti-VEEV scFv phage showed any cross-reactivity with other Alphaviruses. VEEV was detected by using 1 109 (cfu) scFv phage per well followed by an incubation with mAb anti-M13 conjugated with HRP (1:5000) detection of VEEV-specific antigen by immunohistochemistry in TC83 infected and formaldehyde fixed Vero cells was possible. the panning procedure is described by van den Brink et al. [26]. recombinant or purified virus proteins were used for panning if using a nave antibody gene library [27-29]. the panning procedure may be useful for in vitro antibody selection of scFvs against other viral targets from human nave antibody gene libraries. all obtained scFv clones identified structural epitopes that are still folded after denaturation at 56\u00b0C. if the viral antigens were either prepared under reducing conditions or boiled prior to SDS-PAGE, no specific binding was observed. a possible neutralisation activity of the selected scFvs has to be assessed in further studies. this study describes the selection of antibodies against a human pathogenic virus from a human nave scFv antibody gene library using complete, active virus particles as antigen. the selected recombinant antibody fragments will improve the rapid and specific detection of VEEV infections after human and equine outbreaks of encephalitis. strain TC83 was obtained from the Trinidad donkey strain by serial passages on guinea pig embryo heart cells in 1960.
