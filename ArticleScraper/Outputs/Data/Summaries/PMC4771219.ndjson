{"summary": "outbreaks of disease were recorded as early as 500 BC, when the Plague of Athens may have caused as many as 100,000 deaths. plagues in Europe had significant effects on the development of governance and art. they ranged from the Antonine Plague (similar to smallpox), which caused a death toll of 30% of the population (165 to 180), to the Plague of Justinian (541 to 542) and the Black Death (plague; 1346 to 1350) use of dead bodies infected with Yersinia pestis to contaminate wells in Italy (1155; Battle of Tortona) and catapulting of corpses of dead soldiers in Bohemia in 1422. attempted biological warfare by Luke Blackburn, using smallpox-contaminated clothing, was recorded in the civil war of the united states and officially banned in 1863 by U.S. army general order. a week after the 9/11 attacks, letters laced with anthrax arrived via the u.s. postal service. twenty-two cases of anthrax were identified (11 inhalational and 11 cutaneous cases); 5 of the inhalational cases were fatal (3). the laboratory response network (LRN) is typically presented as a pyramid. a sentinel laboratory is able to perform high-complexity testing in accordance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988. in-house testing includes Gram stains and at least one of the following: lower respiratory tract, wound, or blood cultures. laboratory personnel must meet federal regulations for packing and shipping of infectious agents. the laboratory should have a class II or higher certified biological safety cabinet. the second level of the pyramid is represented by confirmatory reference laboratories. the apex of the pyramid is the national laboratories that definitively characterize samples and microbial isolates. the criteria for a tier 1 agent are as follows: (i) the ability to cause a mass casualty event or economic devastation, (ii) communicability or dispersibility, (iii) a low infectious dose, and (iv) a history of interest in weaponization. the tier 1 select agents have come to the most recent attention either as actual outbreaks or as presumed weaponized agents. dic cases still occur, such as the recent cases of wound botulism related to black-tar heroin contamination in southern California (8). a large commercial market has made several neurotoxins readily available globally (9) by creating a flaccid paralysis, these toxins provide treatment for muscle contraction disorders, such as dystonias. a catastrophic epidemic is one of the few disasters that could derail world development. a single species, marburg marburgvirus, is currently recognized. the first outbreak was noted in Germany and was related to zoonotic transmission from research primates. variola virus is an aphthovirus and an RNA virus of the picornaviruses. a total of 45 smallpox virus strains recovered between 1940 and 1977 have been sequenced. a total of 45 strains recovered between 1940 and 1977 have been sequenced. foot-and-mouth disease virus is an RNA virus of about 8,500 bases. it is a species within the Picornaviridae genus (21) as an unenveloped virus, it can survive in a variety of zoonotic environments. it mutates readily, and as a consequence, vaccination has been challenging. Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis subsp. tularensis is more pathogenic than F. tularensis subsp. holarctica. it has a broad animal host range, from mammals to reptiles and invertebrates. burkholderia mallei is not an environmental pathogen compared to its close relative, B. pseudomallei. both organisms show polymyxin B/colistin resistance. yersinia pestis is the etiological agent of bubonic plague. yersinia pestis is a plump Gram-negative bacillus with good growth at 48 h on blood agar media but pinpoint growth at 24 h. it is a relatively inert organism, being oxidase negative, rapid urea negative, and nonmotile at 22\u00b0C. the most typical presentation in humans is a skin lesion, which is the result of exposure to animal products containing anthrax spores. pXO1 contains three genes that create toxin virulence. pXO2 contains a five-gene operon responsible for capsule synthesis. the primary mode of dispersal for bioterrorism incidents is the spore and spore toxin, not the live, non-spore-forming bacillus. the spore is especially durable under conditions of drying and aerosolization (5). a relatively low concentration of organisms (10 to 100 bacteria) can establish infection in humans. the three common species, Brucella abortus, Brucella melitensis, and Brucella suis, cause zoonoses that can be severe and chronic. testing for active tuberculosis still requires the tuberculin skin test or a gamma interferon release assay (44) but new tests are entering the market. a former fungal select agent, Coccidioides immitis, should be mentioned as a risk to laboratory personnel. ycosis can mimic common respiratory infections, hence the common term for the disease, valley fever. in some ethnic populations, the infection becomes systemic, chronic, and difficult to treat (47). clinical laboratories in regions of endemicity also tend to have significant experience with the likelihood of isolation and use of appropriate exposure restrictions. a gram of anthrax spores contains 1 108 spores. a gram of anthrax spores contains 1 108 spores. anthrax spores must be delivered in a breathable form. 153 cases of actual or threatened use of bioterrorism agents were reported between 1990 and 1999 (54). 153 cases of actual or threatened use of bioterrorism agents were reported between 1990 and 1999 (54). 153 cases of actual or threatened use of bioterrorism agents were reported between 1990 and 1999 (54). this number has continued to increase. population dynamics can also affect disease presentation and should be part of an individual laboratory's risk assessment. each clinical microbiology laboratory should build contemporary migrations and local migrations into their assessment. several training modules and texts are available for easy reference. a break in the BSL management process may be only one cause. considerable effort should be made by clinical microbiology laboratory directors. CAP incorporated a requirement in its accreditation standards requiring a bioterrorism preparedness plan for each CAP-accredited clinical microbiology laboratory. CAP also created the Laboratory Preparedness Exercise (LPX), based on a model of survey specimen distribution and grading. APHL is the membership organization representing public health and governmental laboratories. some states have local and regional public health laboratories. some states use a centralized state public health laboratory. other states use a centralized state public health laboratory. the CAP Commission on Laboratory Accreditation recommended checklist items related to bioterrorism protocols (66) other approaches include the use of metrics, which will depend somewhat on the frequency of bioterrorism organism encounters and development of an audit system for biosafety procedures. clinicians are advised to obtain optimal specimens from the sentinel clinical microbiology laboratory. they are advised to limit culture manipulation and refrain from viral culture. also, they are advised to contact their local public health laboratory and restrict manipulation of certain potential agents to a certified class II biological safety cabinet. participating laboratories were sent two mailings (LPXA and LPXB) a year. participants were informed that bioterrorism agents might be part of each challenge. participating laboratories were required to \u201copt in\u201d to the LPX program. terrorism agent (full identification not required) (40) may be the most acceptable response for laboratories with more limited service. judging the capacity depends considerably on the expertise and facilities of each laboratory. the percentage of reference laboratories reporting themselves as reference laboratories tended to be similar to the percentage performing full identification. however, direct linking of these data to demographics was not performed. in the 2008 Y. pestis challenge, 69.2% of laboratories applied automated detection on commercial systems. the number of participants indicating they would notify their reference laboratories increased over time for the period of 3 to 6 days, which may reflect an appropriate interval depending on the organism examined. the LPX surveys continue to be available through the CAP/APHL/CDC collaboration and show improvement in the management of potential bioterrorism agents. the LPX surveys continue to be available through the CAP/APHL/CDC collaboration. clinicians are advised to obtain optimal specimens from the sentinel clinical microbiology laboratory. they are educated to limit culture manipulation and refrain from viral culture. they are advised to contact their local public health laboratory and restrict manipulation of certain potential agents to a certified class II biological safety cabinet. participating laboratories were sent two mailings (LPXA and LPXB) a year. participants were informed that bioterrorism agents might be part of each challenge. participating laboratories were required to \u201copt in\u201d to the LPX program. data on the time interval between specimen processing and notification to an appropriate LRN reference laboratory were also collected, as well as identification procedures, including characteristics and tests. judging the capacity of a laboratory depends considerably on the expertise and facilities of each laboratory. a reference laboratory may be the most acceptable response for laboratories with more limited service. the percentage of reference laboratories reporting themselves as reference laboratories tended to be similar to the percentage performing full identification. however, direct linking of these data to demographics was not performed. in the 2008 Y. pestis challenge, 69.2% of laboratories applied automated detection on commercial systems. the number of participants indicating they would notify their reference laboratories increased over time for the period of 3 to 6 days, which may reflect an appropriate interval depending on the organism examined. CAP, APHL, and the CDC collaborated in 2007 to develop a bioterrorism response educational exercise. a bioterrorism response educational exercise would test most aspects of a clinical microbiology laboratory response, including ruling out and referral of potential bioterrorism agents by using appropriate LRN sentinel laboratory guidelines. participants were informed that bioterrorism agents might be part of each challenge. participating laboratories were required to \u201copt in\u201d to the LPX program. the organisms presented in the challenges in the first 2 years were as follows. data on time interval between specimen processing and notification to an appropriate LRN reference laboratory were collected, as well as identification procedures, including characteristics and tests. the percentage of reference laboratories reporting themselves as reference laboratories tended to be similar to the percentage performing full identification. yersinia pestis, yersinia pestis, and Francisella tularensis in the LPX in 2007 and 2008. yersinia pestis, yersinia pestis, yersinia pestis, and y. pestis in the LPX in 2007 and 2008. in the 2008 Y. pestis challenge, 69.2% of laboratories applied automated detection on commercial systems. the number of participants indicating they would notify their reference laboratories increased over time for the period of 3 to 6 days, which may reflect an appropriate interval depending on the organism examined. the LPX surveys continue to be available through the CAP/APHL/CDC collaboration. there has been improvement in this aspect in the LPX surveys. the LPX surveys continue to be available through the CAP/APHL/CDC collaboration. microbiology laboratories are in the process of implementing systems available from bioM\u00e9rieux/Vitek and Bruker. some laboratories are engaging in laboratory-developed testing using primary positive blood culture bottles with successful CLIA validation. the issue of contamination of automated equipment arose in the management of Ebola cases in the united states. the system was used recently for analysis of Ebola virus infection in the united states. the FDA has approved four molecular tests for bioterrorism testing under emergency circumstances. the bioFire FilmArray biothreat panel is currently restricted to use by the Department of Defense. the index case for the Ebola virus outbreak of 2014 occurred in a young boy in Guinea in December 2013 after exposure to bats. large outbreaks in sub-saharan Africa occur for three species: Zaire ebolavirus, Bundibugyo ebolavirus, and Sudan ebolavirus. a total of 23,948 cases, with mortality of 9,729 cases (77, 79) as of 2 March 2015. the CDC issued a level 3 warning for U.S. citizens to avoid travel to Guinea, liberia, and Sierra Leone. the CDC involvement heightened with the first reported case in the united states. questions occurred regarding the safety of testing specimens on various types of laboratory equipment used for routine testing. the CDC recommended the use of manufacturer-recommended disinfectants or avoidance of use for testing equipment which generates an aerosol (82). Centrifugation poses a risk for aerosolization and requires review. the CDC has an in-depth guideline for isolation precautions (82). a place to begin for an individual clinical laboratory may be the use of prospective failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) prospective failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) can also be used for many other risk questions. the biosafety Blue Ribbon Panel convened by the CDC in 2012 provides an excellent outline for individual clinical laboratories based on the elements found in a quality management system (83). for each of the 12 quality system essentials, specific biosafety considerations are provided. for each of these familiar 12 QSEs, specific biosafety considerations are provided. the performance of the LRN was discussed through an assessment of sentinel laboratory performance. the importance of internal laboratory safety review was emphasized through a discussion of the recent Ebola epidemic."}
