{"summary": "endogenous mechanisms that orchestrate the resolution pathways are essential for tissue homeostasis. acute inflammation can progress to chronic inflammation linked to fibrosis, metabolic diseases, and cancer (1\u20133). sPLA2s have been implicated in inflammation over the last few decades. group IID sPLA2 (sPLA2-IID) is preferentially expressed in DCs in lymphoid organs (12), suggesting its regulatory role in acquired immunity. sPLA2-IID alleviates a Th1-driven immune response in the elicitation phase of contact hypersensitivity (CHS) by directing the anti-inflammatory PGD2-DP1 receptor axis. our results point to a general role of sPLA2-IID as an immunosuppressive sPLA2 that alters the steady-state lipid balance toward an anti-inflammatory state, thereby providing significant impacts on inflammation and cancer. LN expression of inflammatory DC/macrophage markers Itgax (CD11c) and Itgam (CD11b) was significantly greater in Pla2g2d/ mice than in Pla2g2d+/+ mice. the expression of Crth2 encodes the pro-inflammatory chemotactic PGD2 receptor CRTH2/DP2. increased LN inflammation in late phase of irritant dermatitis in Pla2g2d/ mice. expression on day 5 being regarded as 1 (n = 4\u20135) in the CHS model. sensitization phase (irritant dermatitis) analyzed in this study. the levels of 3 PUFAs and their oxygenated metabolites were markedly reduced in Pla2g2d/ mice relative to Pla2g2d+/+ mice. the levels of AA metabolites (i.e. PGs) were barely affected by Pla2g2d deficiency. differences in the LN levels of PUFAs between the genotypes became smaller. 1 level in Pla2g2d+/+ LNs was markedly decreased to a level similar to that in Pla2g2d+/+ mice on day 0. Exceptionally, the LN level of PGD2, but not PGE2, was greatly increased in Pla2g2d/ mice relative to Pla2g2d+/+ mice on day 0. sPLA2-IID could also influence other types of immune response. in a model of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis, repeated IMQ challenges to mouse ears elicit psoriasis-like acanthosis. repeated IMQ challenges to mouse ears elicit psoriasis-like acanthosis and dermal swelling with Th17-type immune responses. flow cytometry of IL-17A- or IL-22-expressing T cells in the skin of IMQ-treated Pla2g2d+/+ and Pla2g2d/ mice on day 6 (n = 3) values are mean S.E., *, p 0.05, and **, p 0.01. IMQ-induced ear swelling and epidermal hyperplasia were significantly greater in Pla2g2d/ mice. LN expression of Pla2g2d in WT mice tended to decrease following IMQ treatment. Flow cytometry of IL-17A- or IL-22-expressing CD3+ T cells in the skin further supported the greater Th17 response in IMQ-treated and even IMQ-untreated Pla2g2d/ mice than in replicate Pla2g2d+/+ mice. in the LNs, the steady-state levels of 3 PUFA metabolites were consistently (>2-fold) elevated in Pla2g2d-TG mice compared with control mice. the levels of some 6 AA-derived metabolites also tended to be slightly higher in the TG mice. in both skin and LNs, Pla2g2d expression was markedly higher in IMQ-treated Pla2g2d-TG mice than in replicate WT mice. IMQ-induced increase in IL-17A- or IL-22-expressing CD3+ T cells was significantly reduced in Pla2g2d-TG skin relative to WT skin. e, ESI-MS analysis of the RvD1 level in the skin of Pla2g2d-TG and WT mice treated with or without IMQ treatment for 6 days (n = 3\u20134). e, time course of ear swelling in Pla2g2d-TG and WT mice that were sensitized with DNFB on day 5 and then re-challenged with DNFB for the indicated periods (n = 16) expression of sPLA2-IID was induced more robustly in Pla2g2d/ DCs than in Pla2g2d+/+ DCs at each time point regardless of IMQ treatment. sPLA2-IID alleviates Th1 immunity even under the basal state. EPA-derived RvE1 (5,12,18-trihydroxy-EPA) had no significant effects on the expression of Il6 and Il23a. expression of the psoriasis-related cytokines Tnf and Il22 in IMQ-treated LN cells was reduced to varying degrees by various AA, EPA, and DHA metabolites. sPLA2-IID attenuates various types of inflammatory response (LN inflammation in irritant dermatitis, Th1-driven CHS, and Th17-driven psoriasis) through the production of pro-resolving lipid metabolites. this beneficial immunosuppressive property of sPLA2-IID is conversely disadvantageous in certain situations such as host defense. significant reduction of tumor development was evident in Pla2g2d/ (tumor weight and number) and Pla2g2f/ (tumor weight) mice but not in Pla2g2e/, Pla2g5/, and Pla2g10/ mice. protection of Pla2g2f/ mice against skin cancer was ascribed to decreased keratinocyte hyper-growth by the absence of epidermal sPLA2-IIF. expression of Arg1 and Cd206, markers for tumor-promoting M2-like macrophages, was substantially lower in Pla2g2d/ skin than in Pla2g2d+/+ skin at 4 weeks after DMBA/TPA treatment. RT-PCR of the regional LNs further confirmed the lower expression of the M2-like macrophage marker Arg1 in Pla2g2d/ mice. d+/+ mice decreased to their levels in Pla2g2d/ mice. absence of sPLA2-IID results in augmentation of anti-tumor immunity. sPLA2-IID increases anti-tumor immunity. Arg1 (H) and Ifng (I) in the skin of Pla2g2d-TG and WT mice with or without DMBA/TPA treatment for 4 weeks (n = 4\u20138) we then applied Pla2g2d-TG mice (C57BL/6 background) to the DMBA/TPA-induced skin carcinogenesis model. LN expression of the inflammatory DC/macrophage markers Itgax (CD11c) and Itgam (CD11b) was significantly greater in Pla2g2d/ mice than in Pla2g2d+/+ mice. the expression of Crth2 encodes the pro-inflammatory chemotactic PGD2. receptor CRTH2/DP2 was robustly elevated in DNFB-treated Pla2g2d/ LNs over Pla2g2d+/+ LNs. the LN expression of Crth2 was much higher than that of Ptgdr (DP1), another PGD2 receptor that prevents DC migration. RT-PCR of genes related to chemokines and lipid mediators in the LNs of Pla2g2d+/+ and Pla2g2d/ mice. levels of PUFAs and their metabolites were markedly reduced in Pla2g2d/ mice relative to Pla2g2d+/+ mice. sPLA2-IID is preferentially coupled with the production of 3 PUFA metabolites. PGs are mostly produced from an sPLA2-IID-independent AA pool. differences in LN levels of PUFAs between the genotypes became smaller. sPLA2-IID could influence other types of immune response. psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by epidermal hyperplasia. sPLA2-IID signal was colocalized in most, if not all, CD11c+MHC-II+ dermal DCs in the affected skin of WT mice. expression levels of Th17-related cytokines (Il17a and Il22) and chemokine (Ccl20) were significantly greater in Pla2g2d/ mice. Pla2g2d deficiency did not affect expression of keratinocyte differentiation marker Krt1. sPLA2-IID is an epidermal sPLA2 whose gene ablation leads to perturbed keratinocyte differentiation and activation. sPLA2-IIF is an epidermal sPLA2. 2g2d-overexpressing TG mice in accordance with the procedure depicted in Fig. 3A. the amplified fragment for the Pla2g2d transgene shifted from a 1,300-bp band (for silent LNL-Pla2g2d) to a 170-bp band (for active Pla2g2d) values are mean S.E., *, p 0.05, and **, p 0.01. we then subjected Pla2g2d-TG mice and littermate WT mice to psoriasis. IMQ-induced ear swelling was significantly ameliorated in Pla2g2d-TG mice. RT-PCR of Th17 cytokines in the LNs and skin of Pla2g2d-TG and WT mice treated with or without IMQ treatment for 6 days (n = 3\u20134) expression in WT being regarded as 1 (n = 3\u20134) skin expression of inflammatory markers, including Ifng, S100a9, Itgax, and Itgam, was consistently lower in Pla2g2d-TG mice than in WT mice. these results fully reciprocate the CHS phenotypes observed in Pla2g2d/ mice (12) quantitative RT-PCR (B\u2013D) or ELISA (E) of cytokines in BMDCs (B and C) or LN cells (D and E) after stimulation for 6 h with IMQ in the presence or absence of the indicated lipids (10 nm) values are normalized with Rn18s (A) or Gapdh (B\u2013D) sPLA2-IID exacerbates skin cancer by attenuating anti-tumor immunity. this beneficial immunosuppressive property of sPLA2-IID is disadvantageous in certain situations such as host defense. sPLA2-IID suppresses an anti-viral Th1 immune response. at 24 weeks, Pla2g2d/ mice were highly protected from skin tumors. tumor incidence and multiplicity over time were delayed. the average tumor volume at 24 weeks was apparently small. values are mean S.E. *, p 0.05, and **, p 0.01. expression of Arg1 and Cd206, markers for tumor-promoting M2-like macrophages, was substantially lower in Pla2g2d/ skin than in Pla2g2d+/+ mice at 4 weeks after DMBA/TPA treatment. the steady-state levels of RvD2 and maresin 1 were reduced in the LNs of Pla2g2d+/+ mice compared with Pla2g2d+/+ mice. this difference was not seen in the DMBA/TPA-treated group as the levels of these lipid mediators in Pla2g2d+/+ mice were decreased to their levels in Pla2g2d/ mice. this difference was not seen in the DMBA/TPA-treated group as RT-PCR of Arg1 (E), flow cytometry of cytotoxic T cells (F) and lipidomics detection of RvD2 and maresin 1 (G) in the LNs of Pla2g2d+/+ and Pla2g2d/ mice with or without DMBA/TPA treatment for 4 weeks. in the elicitation phase of CHS, the resolution of a pro-inflammatory Th1 response in the skin and regional LNs is markedly delayed in Pla2g2d/ mice (12). however, the role of sPLA2-IID in acute inflammation remained unclear. the expression of Crth2 encodes the pro-inflammatory chemotactic PGD2 receptor CRTH2/DP2. the expression of Crth2 was robustly elevated in DNFB-treated Pla2g2d/ LNs over Pla2g2d+/+ mice. the expression of Ptgds2 was greater in Pla2g2d/ mice than in Pla2g2d+/+ mice. IFN- production by LN cells obtained from DNFB-treated Pla2g2d+/+ and Pla2g2d/ mice on day 0 and then stimulated with DNBS for 24 or 48 h ex vivo. ESI-MS analysis of steady-state levels of PUFAs and their metabolites in the LNs of Pla2g2d+/+ and Pla2g2d/ mice, with the level of each lipid in Pla2g2d+ the levels of 3 PUFAs and their oxygenated metabolites were markedly reduced in Pla2g2d/ mice relative to Pla2g2d+/+ mice. the levels of AA metabolites (i.e. PGs) were barely affected by Pla2g2d deficiency. the lack of sPLA2-IID exacerbates the late stage of LN inflammation in the process of irritant dermatitis. the marked decrease in the steady-state level of 3 PUFA metabolites suggests that sPLA2-IID could also influence other types of immune response. a schematic representation of the procedure (top panel) and the kinetics of ear swelling in Pla2g2d+/+ and Pla2g2d/ mice with or without IMQ treatment for the indicated periods (n = 20) we found that IMQ-induced ear swelling and epidermal hyperplasia were significantly greater. sPLA2-IID signal was colocalized in most, if not all, CD11c+MHC-II+ dermal DCs in the affected skin of WT mice. expression levels of Th17-related cytokines (Il17a and Il22) and chemokine (Ccl20) were substantially higher in IMQ-treated Pla2g2d/ mice than in Pla2g2d+/+ mice. Pla2g2d deficiency leads to exacerbation of the Th17 immune response in psoriasis. we generated Pla2g2d-overexpressing TG mice in accordance with the procedure shown in Fig. 3A. RT-PCR of Pla2g2d relative to Rn18s in various tissues and cells of Pla2g2d-TG and WT mice (n = 3). we then subjected Pla2g2d-TG mice and littermate WT mice to the models of psoriasis. Pla2g2d-TG and littermate WT mice were subjected to psoriasis. time course of ear swelling in Pla2g2d-TG and WT mice with or without IMQ treatment for the indicated periods. n18 values are mean S.E., *, p 0.05, and **, p 0.01. in the elicitation phase of CHS, Pla2g2d ablation results in delayed resolution of Th1-driven dermatitis. DNFB-challenged Pla2g2d-TG mice displayed an earlier recovery from ear swelling than did replicate WT mice. sPLA2-IID alleviates Th1 immunity even under the basal state. quantitative RT-PCR of cytokines in BMDCs from Pla2g2d+/+ and Pla2g2d/ mice after stimulation for the indicated periods with (+) or without IMQ. EPA-derived RvE1 (5,12,18-trihydroxy-EPA) had no significant effects on expression of Il6 and Il23a. expression of psoriasis-related cytokines Tnf and Il22 in IMQ-treated LN cells was reduced to varying degrees by various AA, EPA, and DHA metabolites. sPLA2-IID attenuates various types of inflammatory response (LN inflammation in irritant derma sPLA2-IID suppresses an anti-viral Th1 immune response, leading to increased coronavirus infection and thereby augmented lung inflammation. to this end, we applied a model of chemical carcinogenesis to Pla2g2d/ mice and littermate WT mice on a BALB/c background. at 24 weeks, Pla2g2d/ mice were highly protected from the development of skin tumors. the expression of Arg1 and Cd206, markers for tumor-promoting M2-like macrophages, was substantially lower in Pla2g2d/ skin than in Pla2g2d+/+ skin at 4 weeks after DMBA/TPA treatment. the expression of Arg1 and Cd206, but not Cd68, was substantially lower in Pla2g2d/ skin than in Pla2g2d+/+ skin at 4 weeks after DMBA/TPA treatment. sPLA2-IID increases anti-tumor immunity by decreasing tumor-promoting M2-like macrophages and increasing tumor-suppressing M1-like macrophages. the absence of sPLA2-IID results in augmentation of anti-tumor immunity. quantitative RT-PCR of macrophage markers in DMBA/TPA-treated Pla2g2d+/+ and Pla2g2d/ skins at 4 weeks, with Rn18s as a normalization control (n = 6). D, flow cytometry of M1- or M2-like macrophages in the spleen of Pla2g2d+ and Pla2g2d/ mice with or without DMBA/TPA treatment for 4 weeks. Pla2g2d deficiency, its TG overexpression shifts the immune balance toward suppression of the anti-tumor immunity. application of the hapten antigen dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) to abdominal skin followed by a second application of the same antigen to ear skin (elicitation) elicits Th1-driven ear swelling (13) itgax (CD11c) and itgam (CD11b) were significantly greater in Pla2g2d/ mice. Pla2g2d cells produced more IFN-, a signature Th1 cytokine. these results suggest that Pla2g2d deficiency results in exacerbation of the late stage of acute inflammation toward a Th1 response in skin-regional LNs. the sensitization phase (irritant dermatitis) was analyzed in this study. elicitation phase (irritant dermatitis) was detailed in previous report. the levels of 3 PUFAs and their oxygenated metabolites were markedly reduced in Pla2g2d/ mice. the levels of AA metabolites (i.e. PGs) were barely affected by Pla2g2d deficiency. differences in the LN levels of PUFAs between the genotypes became smaller. the down-regulation of Pla2g2d expression was greatly increased in Pla2g2d/ mice relative to Pla2g2d+/+ mice on day 0. this corroborates the increased expression of Ptgds2 in the null mice. sPLA2-IID could also influence other types of immune response. repeated IMQ challenges to mouse ears elicit psoriasis-like acanthosis. repeated IMQ challenges to mouse ears elicit psoriasis-like acanthosis and dermal swelling with Th17-type immune responses. values are mean S.E., *, p 0.05, and **, p 0.01. IMQ-induced ear swelling and epidermal hyperplasia were significantly greater in Pla2g2d/ mice than in Pla2g2d+/+ mice. sPLA2-IID signal was colocalized in most, if not all, CD11c+MHC-II+ dermal DCs in the affected skin of WT mice. IL-17A- or IL-22-expressing CD3+ T cells in the skin further supported the greater Th17 response in IMQ-treated and even IMQ-untreated Pla2g2d+/+ mice. Lipidomics analysis of the affected skin revealed substantial reductions of DHA-derived metabolites but not AA-derived eicosanoids such as PGE2 and PGD2 in Pla2g2d-TG mice. 3 PUFA metabolites were consistently (>2-fold) elevated in Pla2g2d-TG mice compared with WT mice. levels of some 6 AA-derived metabolites also tended to be slightly higher in the TG mice. LN expression of Il17a and IL-22 was substantially lower in IMQ-treated Pla2g2d-TG mice than in replicate WT mice. IMQ-induced increase in IL-17A- or IL-22-expressing CD3+ T cells was significantly reduced in Pla2g2d-TG skin relative to WT skin. skin level of RvD1 was substantially higher in IMQ-treated Pla2g2d-TG mice. d1, time course of ear swelling in Pla2g2d-TG and WT mice treated with IMQ for 6 days (n = 3\u20134). H, quantitative RT-PCR of inflammatory markers in the skin of Pla2g2d-TG and WT mice on day 5 after DNFB re-challenge. expression of Il6 and Il23a was induced more robustly in Pla2g2d/ DCs. also, Pla2g2d+/+ DCs expressed more Il12a (a Th1 cytokine) than did Pla2g2d+/+ DCs. sPLA2-IID alleviates the Th1 immunity even under the basal state. EPA-derived RvE1 (5,12,18-trihydroxy-EPA) had no significant effects on the expression of Il6 and Il23a. expression of the psoriasis-related cytokines Tnf and Il22 in IMQ-treated LN cells was reduced to varying degrees by various AA, EPA, and DHA metabolites. sPLA2-IID attenuates various types of inflammatory response (LN inflammation in irritant dermatitis, Th1-driven CHS, and Th17-driven psoriasis) through the production of pro-resolving lipid metabolites. this beneficial immunosuppressive property of sPLA2-IID is conversely disadvantageous in certain situations such as host defense. the protection of Pla2g2f/ mice against skin cancer was ascribed to decreased keratinocyte hyper-growth by the absence of epidermal sPLA2-IIF. a, schematic representation of the procedure for DMBA/TPA-induced skin cancer. 68, a marker for tumor-suppressing M1-like macrophages, was substantially lower in Pla2g2d/ skin than in Pla2g2d+/+ skin at 4 weeks after DMBA/TPA treatment. flow cytometry of splenic (Fig. 7D) and LN (data not shown) cells revealed a reduction of M2-like macrophages (CD11cloCD206hi) and an increase of M1-like macrophage sPLA2-IID increases anti-tumor immunity by decreasing tumor-promoting M2-like macrophages and increasing tumor-suppressing M1-like macrophages and cytotoxic T cells. sPLA2-IID increases anti-tumor immunity by decreasing tumor-promoting M2-like macrophages. we then applied Pla2g2d-TG mice (C57BL/6 background) to the DMBA/TPA-induced skin carcinogenesis model. constitutive expression of Arg1 was elevated and DNBA/TPA-induced expression of Ifng was dampened. this shifts the immune balance toward suppression of the anti-tumor immunity. sPLA2-IID, a DC-expressed \u201cresolving sPLA2,\u201d retards the resolution of Th1-driven inflammation in the skin and draining LNs by preferentially mobilizing lipid mediators. this function could be explained, at least partly, by the ability of sPLA2-IID to mobilize 3 PUFA metabolites that dampen the Th1- or Th17-type immune responses. ectopic administration of 3 PUFA metabolites (38\u201340) confers protective effects against infection-based inflammation or cancer xenograft by facilitating phagocytotic clearance of hazardous materials by innate immune cells. multiple 3 PUFA metabolites could exert a distinct impact on acquired immunity by suppressing the functions of DCs, T cells, or their interactions. 3 PUFAs themselves can block Th17 cytokine production by lamina propria lymphocytes in colitis (14) and inflammasome activation in obesity (48\u201350) through the fatty acid receptor GPR40 or GPR120. sPLA2-IID appears to be coupled with the AA-PGD2-DP1 axis in the lung LNs during pulmonary viral infection (28) sPLA2-IIA is a prototypic sPLA2 isoform that is inducible by pro-inflammatory stimuli. it amplifies sterile inflammation by hydrolyzing membranes in microparticles. sPLA2-V promotes M2 macrophage polarization and Th2 immunity. sPLA2-X exacerbates asthma by mobilizing AA metabolites in the lung. Pla2g2d/, Pla2g2e/, Pla2g2f/, and Pla2g10/ mice backcrossed to C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice for more than 12 generations. all animal experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science. male founders were mated with female C57BL/6 mice to confirm germ line transmission by PCR genotyping. those with successful germ line transmission (LNL-Pla2g2d-TG) were then crossed with female CAG-Cretg/+ mice, which carry a Cre recombinase transgene under control of the CAG promoter (58). this step resulted in removal of the Neor cassette from the LNL-Pla2g2d transgene mouse tissues were fixed with 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, mounted on glass slides, deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated in ethanol with increasing concentrations of water. stained sections were analyzed using a microscope (Olympus) the specificity of the anti-sPLA2-IID antibody was confirmed by absence of sPLA2-IID staining in the spleen, LNs, and skin of Pla2g2d/ mice (12).
