{"summary": "enteric pathogens infect the intestine epithelial lining, resulting in food poisoning or diarrheal disease. in humans and animals, enteric pathogens must withstand proteolytic conditions in the stomach before penetrating the mucus layer and accessing the underlying gut epithelium for attachment or cell invasion. enteric Viruses and Carbohydrates Carbohydrates function as receptors for virus entry. carbohydrates are expressed on many types of cells and tissues such as sialic acid and heparan sulfate. the enteric virus norovirus recognizes histo-blood group antigens. the A antigen (GalNAc 1-3(Fuc-1-2)Gal) and B antigen (Gal 1-3(Fuc-1-2)Gal) of HBGAs are generated by transfer of GalNAc and Gal, respectively, to an H structure irrespective of the carbohydrate core structure. HBGAs are found in saliva and mucosal secretions from the intestinal epithelial cells of secretors. feline calicivirus (FCV), a member of the genus Vesivirus, infects the upper respiratory tract by attaching to 2-6-linked sialic acids. it is easy to study the life cycle of FCV because the virus replicates efficiently in cell culture without specific supplementation. noroviruses are not cultivable in cell culture. bacterial fimbriae and adhesins contribute to bacterial attachment. each bacterial adhesin recognizes a specific structure of its target sugar molecule. each bacterial adhesin recognizes a specific structure of its target sugar molecule. Salmonella, S. typhi and S. paratyphi cannot survive within macrophages. they cause gastroenteritis in humans and animals by colonizing the intestinal epithelium and then invading and destroying the M cells. Std fimbriae are categorized as -fimbriae and are well conserved among S. enterica serotypes but absent from other related bacterial species. non-typhoidal Salmonella, S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis, however, are unable to survive within macrophages. type 1 fimbriae consist of a major component (FimA) and a minor component (FimH). fimH lies at the tip of type 1 fimbriae, where it mediates binding to D-mannose-containing structures and enables the bacteria to colonize various host tissues. type 4 fimbriae are thought to recognize carbohydrates as specific receptors. but precise functions of some type 4 fimbriae have yet to be determined. bacterial virulence has been shown to decrease when type 4 fimbriae are deleted. the leX antigen is defined by the presence of a terminal Gal1-4(Fuc-3)GlcNAc moiety on saccharide chains of glycoproteins or glycosphingolipids. in the human intestine, it is expressed mainly in crypt epithelial cells. abundant crypt abscesses are commonly found in S. typhimurium patients. the std fimbriae are well conserved among S. enterica serotypes. the std fimbriae are absent from related bacterial species. allelic variation of FimH adhesion directs not only host cell-specific recognition but also distinctive binding to mammalian and avian receptors. pylori express blood group antigen b-binding adhesion (BabA) and BabA binds to leb antigens. gangliosides act as co-receptors for Salmonella enterica FliC. gangliosides also act as co-receptors for eukaryotic cell membranes. they are all zoonotic pathogens that invade and colonize their target tissues. the ability of T. gondii to infect CHO cells deficient in sialic acids was reduced by 26.9% compared to wild-type cells. the ability of T. gondii to infect Chinese hamster ovary cells deficient in sialic acids was reduced by 26.9%. tachyzoite can be secreted or membrane-bound and attached to sialic acids, carbohydrates and glycoproteins during invasion. SAG1, SAG2A and SAG3 have some capacity for host cell attachment through glycan recognition. glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) protein anchors are abundant in the membranes of tachyzoites and other apicomplexan protozoan parasites. the GPI moieties of T. cruzi and P. falciparum were found to be TLR2 ligands [51, 52], and T. gondii both stimulate cytokine production in macrophages. mucin glycoproteins from mucus-producing cells in the epithelium or submucosal glands are the major macromolecular constituent of mucus. membrane-anchored cell-surface mucin glycoproteins are a major constituent of the glycocalyx in all mucosal tissues. epithelial mucins are a heterogenous family of large complex glycoproteins containing a dense array of O-linked carbohydrates. the carbohydrate structures present on mucosal surfaces vary according to cell lineage, tissue location and developmental stage. mucin glycosylation can alter in response to mucosal infection and inflammation. glycosaminoglycan chains are composed of highly sulfated saccharides. syndecan-1 carries conserved attachment sites for glycosaminoglycan chains. glypicans contain GPI anchors in a tissue-specific and temporally regulated manner. intestinal M cells, specifically designed to capture and present microbes to the underlying lymphoid tissue, can be regarded as a \u201chole\u201d in the mucin barrier. the dome epithelium lacks goblet cells and therefore does not produce gel-forming mucins. GP2 expressed on M cells functions as a bacterial uptake receptor. carbohydrates (glycoconjugates) function as receptors for various pathogens. on the surface of mucosal tissue, the glycocalyx physically prevents microbes from accessing the cell membrane. glycoconjugates can also function as barrier to infection. these pathogens cause food poisoning in humans and gastrointestinal diseases in animals all over the world. the development and use of drugs that target these carbohydrates is anticipated, even though the microbes vary widely and have different modes of infection. the development and use of drugs that target these carbohydrates is anticipated. sulfated polysaccharides have been analyzed as drug candidates for protozoan infectious diseases. the sulfated positions in the carbohydrates can be critical for the inhibitory quality."}
