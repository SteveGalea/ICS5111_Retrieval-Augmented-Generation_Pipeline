{"summary": "the reporter construct (GRP78-fluc) used in the study contains the promoter region of GRP78 driving the coding sequence of firefly luciferase gene30,31. the reporter activity was measured by dual-luciferase assay 24 hours post transfection. 293T cells were transfected with the PGK-renilla-luciferase as an internal control, and increasing amounts of plasmids encoding M1 or M3. the lysates were prepared 24 hours posttransfection for dual-luciferase assay. RT-PCR was performed using a primer set specific for GRP78. mRNA levels determined quantitative RT-PCR analysis as described in Fig. 1A using specific primer sets for indicated genes. mRNA levels determined quantitative RT-PCR analysis as described in Fig. 1B using specific primer sets for indicated genes. eukaryotic cells were transfected with vector control (A) or plasmids encoding M1 (B) or M3 (C) for 24 hours, and were prepared for electron microscopy analysis. both proteins contain signal peptides and cleavage sites located close to the N-terminus. the results also indicated that both M1 and M3 are secreted proteins. NIH3T3 cells were mock-infected or infected with wild-type (WT) or M1-cHA MHV-68 at MOI 10 and harvested at indicated time points for western blot analysis. we then asked whether the ER localization is required for M1 to induce chaperone genes. 293T cells were transfected for 24 hours with the plasmids encoding the indicated M1 mutants. cells were harvested for western blot analysis using antibodies against tublin (top), HA (middle) or FLAG (bottom) 293T cells were transfected with the indicated M1 mutants. clones without the signal peptide (M1SP, M1F2) were detectable by both HA and FLAG antibodies. clones without the signal peptide (M1SP, M1F2) were distributed throughout the cells with no specific ER localization (Fig. 4C). mutagenesis studies revealed that the M1 protein requires both its signal peptide and at least portion of its intraluminal fragment to reach the full potential of function. induction of different ER chaperone genes requires the cooperation between the three UPR signaling pathways. the luciferase is expressed only after IRE1-induced splicing removes the 26-nt intron33. luciferase is expressed only after splicing removes the 26-nt intron33. luciferase activates the IRE1 and ATF6 pathways of UPR. XBP1 is produced downstream of activated ATF6 pathway. we used a reporter plasmid (p5XATF6-fluc) that contains five copies of aTF6 consensus binding site upstream of the firefly luciferase coding sequence34. to investigate the PERK-mediated signaling in response to M1 expression, we examined the phosphorylation of eIF2 (p-eIF2) induced by PERK upon UPR. expression from the MHV-68 genome had no effect on viral growth kinetics in vitro. 293T cells were transfected for 24 hours with GRP78_fluc or GRP78mut_fluc and PGK_RL plasmids. they were either mock infected or infected with wild-type (WT), M1S or M1R MHV-68 at MOI 5 for 18 hours. phenotype is specific to the GRP78 promoter, cells were transfected with the GRP78mut-fluc plasmids. none of the viruses had a significant effect on the mutant reporter construct. in all cases, attenuated reporter activities were observed in cells infected with the virus as compared to cells infected with WT and M1R MHV-68. based on the screen results, we speculated that there are one or more viral factors that actually function to limit the signaling pathways involved in regulation of both the chaperone genes and other cellular factors unfavored in viral replication. it would be of interest to uncover how virus manipulates the chaperone network and its associated cellular machineries to achieve a balanced and beneficial outcome. 293T cells were transfected with the PGK-renilla-luciferase as an internal control and increasing amounts of plasmids encoding M1 or M3. RT-PCR was performed using a primer set specific for GRP78. levels of mRNA were normalized to that of GAPDH mRNA. intensity was calculated by normalizing the intensity of bands in top and middle panel bands (GRP78) to the middle panel bands (-actin) the promoter activities of GRP94 and ERdj4 were determined by reporter assay as described in Fig. 1A. 293T cells were transfected with vector control (A) or plasmids encoding M1 (B) or M3 (C) for 24 hours. electron microscopy analysis revealed a massive expansion of the ER in the M1-expressing cells. both proteins contain signal peptides and cleavage sites located close to the N-terminus. tagged virus replicates normally (Fig. S2) and enables detection of the M1 protein. M1 expression was induced at 12 hours post infection in the NIH3T3 cells. we observed significant a co-localization of M1 with Conc A. M1 requires ER localization for ER chaperone induction. 293T cells were transfected for 24 hours with plasmids encoding indicated mutants. cells were harvested for western blot analysis using antibodies against tublin (top), HA (middle) or FLAG (bottom) cells were transfected with individual clones and subject to western blot analysis. proteins bearing the M1 signal peptide sequence (i.e.: M1, M1SPF2, M1SPM3) could not be detected by the HA antibody (upper panel: Lane 1, 4, 6) indicating a cleavage at the N-terminus. the ER-localized M3SP+M1 activates the IRE1 and ATF6 axes of UPR to induce ER chaperone genes. mutagenesis studies revealed that the M1 protein requires its signal peptide and at least portion of its intraluminal fragment to reach the full potential of function. pXBP1u-fluc consists the coding sequence of firefly luciferase conjugated to the second ORF of XBP1u. the luciferase is expressed only after IRE1-induced splicing removes the 26-nt intron33. antibody specific for phosphorylated-eIF2a, total eIF2a and -actin (loading control) as indicated. cells transfected with M1 expressed a higher level of total XBP1 mRNA than did vector or M3-transfected cells. we suspected that the ATF6 pathway may also be stimulated by M1 expression. removal of the M1 expression from the MHV-68 genome had no effect on viral growth kinetics in vitro. infection by M1-deficient MHV-68 leads to reduced ER chaperon production. 293T cells were transfected 24 hours with GRP78_fluc or GRP78mut_fluc and PGK_RL plasmids. 293T cells transfected with GRP78-fluc reporter construct were either mock infected or infected with the wild type (WT), M1S or M1R MHV-68 at MOI 5. infection with the virus led to a moderate increase in luciferase production, whereas M1S was not able to induce the reporter activity to an equivalent level (Fig. 6B). infection by WT or M1R MHV-68 led to a lower induction of chaperone genes. based on the screen results, we speculated that there are one or more viral factors that actually function to limit the signaling pathways involved in regulation of both the chaperone genes. it is of interest that the virus selectively acts on the beneficial aspects of the UPR program while avoiding the detrimental features. a recent study used the three-dimensional structure analysis to demonstrate that IRE1 activation is actually caused by direct binding to the unfolded proteins. this finding implicates that certain undefined properties in the M1 protein leads to the differentiated modulation on the UPR sensors. viruses are able to engage the host chaperone machinery to support effective cell entry and nuclear import16,35,36,37, viral genome replication38,39, viral protein expression and folding17,18,19, and virion assembly40,41,42. viruses can even encode proteins that exhibit chaperone-like activities to facilitate their infection. gamma-herpesviruses are capable of establishing lifetime persistence. it is natural that different viruses adopt distinct approaches to tackle similar environmental challenges. previous studies have found that the M2 protein unique to MHV-68 enhances the cellular interleukin-10 expression to promote B cell growth and differentiation.
