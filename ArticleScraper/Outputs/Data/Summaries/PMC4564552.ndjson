{"summary": "pATX VSVG-HA-ZGP contained the HA sequence in a multiple cloning site flanked by the MluI and AvrII restriction sites, as well as the ZGP sequence flanked by XhoI and NheI. both genes were downstream from the matrix gene (M) and upstream from the RNA-dependent RNA gene (L) antigens were detected using mouse serum containing anti-H5N1 HA or a monoclone. titers were quantified using a standard plaque assay on MDCK cells. nal mouse anti--actin was detected using a monoclonal mouse anti--actin at 1:5000 (Sigma) the control antigen was detected using a monoclonal mouse anti--actin at 1:30000 as a secondary antibody. bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit. all infectious work was performed in the Biosafety Level 4 facility at PHAC. a total of 14 mice (7 control, 7 vaccinated) were used for the experiments shown in all 4 panels. each sample was serially diluted 1:2 in PBS starting at a 1:10 dilution. a total of 100 L MEM with 0.1% BSA containing 2.0 g/mL TPCK-trypsin or 100 L DMEM containing 2% FBS was added to the influenza or EBOV virus sample wells. the capture antigen was diluted in PBS and 50 L/well of 1 g/mL was used to coat Immulon 2 HB 96-well flat bottom microtiter ELISA plates. a sample was deemed positive when the absorbance was greater than 5 standard deviations from the prevaccination control sample for each animal. a total of 6 mice were used for these experiments, and thus the results against HA or ZGP originated from the same set of mice. each pool was diluted with RPMI 1640 and added to the microtiter plates at 2.5 g/mL per well. splenocytes were centrifuged and resuspended in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% sodium pyruvate, 1% HEPES buffer. the complementary DNA of the pATX VSVG-HA-ZGP construct and helper plasmids were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) the supernatant was blind passaged onto subconfluent Vero E6 cells and incubated until cytopathic effects (CPEs) were observed. immunoblotting expression of HA and ZGP from VSVG-HA-ZGP was confirmed by immunoblotting. vero E6 cells infected with VSVG-HA-ZGP were harvested at 48 hours postinfection along with cell supernatant. BALB/c mice were challenged via the intranasal (I.N.) route 30 minutes postexposure and 28 days postvaccination at 100 times the lethal dose. mice were also challenged with 100 LD50 of the heterologous Hong Kong 97 (450 PFU), Vietnam 04 (100 PFU), or Indonesia 05 (100 PFU) H5N1 viruses at the same time points. serum samples were treated overnight with receptor-destroying enzyme for influenza virus (Denka Seiken) at 37\u00b0C followed by inactivation at 56\u00b0C for 45 minutes. each sample was serially diluted 1:2 in PBS starting at a 1:10 dilution, added to 4 agglutinating doses of corresponding homologous or heterologous virus, and incubated with horse red blood cells. inactivated mouse serum samples were serially diluted 1:2 in blocking buffer starting at 1:100. 50 L was applied to each well then allowed to incubate for 60 minutes. a sample was deemed positive when the absorbance was greater than 5 standard deviations from the prevaccination control sample for each animal. 96-well microtiter plates with a PVDF membrane were coated with antimouse interferon (IFN)\u2013 antibody. plates were blocked with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin for 4 hours. splenocytes were centrifuged and resuspended in RPMI 1640. recombinant, bivalent VSVG-HA-ZGP vaccine was constructed to express both the Hanoi 05 HA and ZGP. a control -actin antigen was also probed for all samples with the correct molecular size appearing at 42 kDa. mice given either DMEM or 1 107 PFU VSV-eGFP challenged I.P with 1000 LD50 of MA-EBOV resulted in rapid weight loss, and 100% mortality between days 4 and 9 postinfection. 9 of 10 mice survived when given the vaccine 30 minutes postexposure with approximately 14% weight loss.

VSVG-HA-ZGP was well tolerated in mice, but there is a need to fully elucidate the safety profile of this bivalent vaccine in order to facilitate clinical acceptance. the efficacy of VSVG-HA-ZGP against a single or dual virus challenge increases its value as a vaccine against multiple pathogens as well as highlighting the vaccine's utility and flexibility."}
