{"summary": "systemic inflammatory response syndrome is characterized by dysregulation of the host innate immune response. this hyperinflammatory response has untoward effects on the cardiopulmonary system, vascular endothelium, and gut, precipitating progressive organ dysfunction until the host succumbs. bacterial sepsis is amenable to treatment and is presumably more common. a recent study of adult patients with severe sepsis showed that viral respiratory pathogens were overlooked in 70% of patients. the most frequent sites of infection were the respiratory tract (40%) and bloodstream (20%) iology was found in only approximately 15% of cases, making viral infection more likely as a plausible cause of sepsis in these patients. iology was found in only approximately 15% of cases, making viral infection more likely as a plausible cause of sepsis in these patients (11) in the pediatric intensive care unit, influenza virus is a leading cause of viral sepsis and caries an especially high mortality rate (12). the concomitant compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome predisposes the host to secondary nosocomial infection and latent viral activation (25, 26). the type of mechanisms employed vary by virus but generally result in some combination of (1) cytokine release, (2) endotheliopathy, and (3) host cytotoxicity (27). pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs) are cellular sensors that recognize specific molecular structure of a pathogen (28). toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) are two types of PRRs that are involved in viral sensing (28). melanoma differentiation associated factor 5 (MDA5) recognize dsRNAs in response to different RNA viruses and signal the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type-1 IFNs (37). trypsin is upregulated and released by the vascular endothelium (38) and has been shown to cleave circulating pro-MMP released from macrophages to form activated MMPs (40). viral particles induce reactive oxygen species generation by circulating neutrophils, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, P-selectin increase margination and activation of leukocytes, further promoting the inflammatory response. inflammatory mediators, including thrombin, ROS, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), promote weibel-Palade body exocytosis. heparan sulfate may bind and activate antithrombin III. also exposes membrane-bound glycoprotein Ib/IX/V complexes. loss of integrity of the protein-rich glycocalyx alters microvascular fluid equilibrium between the vascular lumen and subglycocalyx. a pathogenic strain of H3N2 influenza virus develops acute lung injury. the exact mechanisms each virus employs to induce endothelial cell dysfunction are not clear. the typical presentation of capillary leak with viral sepsis suggests a common pathway by which endothelial integrity is compromised. viruses take over and utilize host intracellular machinery to replicate. viruses may also indirectly promote apoptosis through macrophage reprogramming. invasiveness and pervasiveness of the viral infection dictates by cell tropism. s have significantly reduced TLR expression, antigen-presenting cell activity, NK cell responsiveness, NK cell responsiveness, NK cell functionality, B-cell maturity, and complement concentration (70) children with congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies are more susceptible to viral pathogens. clinical features and risk factors for viral sepsis are frequently indistinguishable from bacterial or fungal sepsis. hypothermia, on the other hand, is a less frequent but more specific indicator of sepsis that may be predictive of illness severity and death. a myriad of cardiopulmonary manifestations can range from completely asymptomatic to severe respiratory distress due to pneumonia. virus-induced sepsis requires a high index of suspicion, especially in very young children and those with chronic medical conditions. neonates and young infants are at higher risk of sepsis from HSV, HPeVs, and enterovirus. the leading three bacterial coinfections were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas spp., and Haemophilus influenza (87). in children hospitalized for RSV, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the most common organisms isolated in those who developed bacteremia (88). these secondary bacterial infections may exacerbate innate immune dysfunction (89) upregulation of surface platelet-activating factor receptor on epithelial cells and leukocytes by pro-inflammatory cytokines may also increase adhesion and invasion of certain virulent pneumococcal strains. a leading hypothesis entails translocation of bacteria and endotoxin through damaged intestinal epithelium into the splanchnic circulation, systemically increasing production of nitric oxide. there was no difference in the risk of hospitalization or the severity of illness in patients with single viral infections and those with viral coinfections (102). there was no difference in the risk of hospitalization or the severity of illness in patients with single viral infections and those with viral coinfections (102). the long turn-around time for results significantly limits its utility for expedient diagnosis (108). commercial or laboratory-developed nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) may provide greater sensitivity and specificity than POC or DFA testing. the use of NAATs is limited by the high cost, delay in results and the inability to distinguish between viral nucleic acids from live viruses. a positive test could be a result of asymptomatic colonization, prolonged viral shedding or viral coinfection. the use of serum biomarkers and whole blood gene expression analysis (118) may serve a crucial role in this setting to discern viral from bacterial sepsis. the mean sensitivity of PCT as a biomarker of sepsis remains low at 77%, with a specificity of 79% (123, 124). in general, these biomarkers are non-specific in distinguishing bacterial vs. viral infection (125) many viral infections can be prevented with the use of hand hygiene, environmental decontamination, use of personal protective equipment, elimination of second-hand smoke. additional protection can be conferred by administering vaccines for common communicable viruses. development of novel vaccines and treatment is critical (131) the use of ALS-008176, an RSV polymerase inhibitor, has also been shown to reduce viral load and rapidly clear RSV. the use of ALN-RSV01 is a lipid-based nanoparticulate system, containing small-interfering RNA (siRNA) that demonstrates promising antiviral effects against RSV in lung transplant patients (141) inflexalR V and InfluvacR are two virosomal vaccines that have been shown to be efficacious against influenza infection (147, 148) nanotraps such as sialylneolacto-N-tetraose c bind to hemagglutinins on the influenza virus and prevent viral replication in vitro. abzug et al. reported greater survival in patients with neonatal enteroviral sepsis who received pleconaril (159) no antiviral activity has been observed from pleconaril against HPeV (18) a recent study found no difference in mortality between patients with and without viral infections who were admitted to PICU (172). the highest mortality from RSV infection was seen at mean age of 6.2\u20137.5 months with three quarters of these cases associated with comorbid conditions. HPeV infections have also been associated with encephalitis, hepatitis and coagulopathy. rare complications include necrotizing enterocolitis, myocarditis, myositis, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and Reye's syndrome. Developing countries often have disproportionately higher mortality in patients with viral infections (190), likely due to delayed diagnosis and treatment. risk of severe sepsis is also related to the site of infection, with endocarditis and CNS infections being associated with mortality as high as 20%. australia and new Zealand sepsis study group identified a pathogen in approximately 50% of patients with sepsis and septic shock (9). bacterial etiology was found in only approximately 15% of cases, making viral infection more likely as a plausible cause of sepsis in these patients. viral sepsis is characterized by systemic and dysregulated inflammation. it can lead to vicious cycle of vascular endotheliopathy, microcirculatory hypoperfusion, intestinal barrier dysfunction, circulatory shock, and mitochondrial failure. concomitant compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome predisposes the host to secondary nosocomial infection and latent viral activation. pathogen-recognition receptors are cellular sensors that recognize specific molecular structure of a pathogen (28) pathogen-recognition receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) encounter pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) intracellular TLR-7 and TLR-8 recognize single-stranded Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) of viruses like HPe TLR activation culminates in myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88, through TLR-7,-8, and -9) or toll/interleukin receptor domain-containing adapter protein inducing IFN- (TRIF, through TLR-3) activation (32). these proteins activate nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) and IFN-regulatory factor (IFR)-mediated cytokine transcription ( endothelial glycocalyx exposes cellular adhesion molecules (e.g., ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, P-selectin) that increase the margination and activation of leukocytes. inflammatory mediators, namely thrombin, ROS, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), promote weibel-Palade body exocytosis. viremia occurs through direct invasion of epithelial cells to reach the surrounding vasculature (47) once in the blood, the virus may induce endothelial glycocalyx degradation by activating leukocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells. endothelial glycocalyx disruption exposes selectins and intracellular adhesion molecules, making them available for leukocyte adhesion and activation. hantavirus bind to cellular surface 3-integrins, thereby promoting VE-cadherin internalization and adherens junction destabilization (57). hantavirus appear to bind to cellular surface 3-integrins, thereby promoting VE-cadherin internalization and adherens junction destabilization (57). NF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is released from viral-reprogrammed macrophages. natural killer (NK) and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8+) T cells inject perforin into the membranes of infected host cells. the intrinsic pathway may be activated after viral protein recognition by the host cell or suicide gene insertion by cytotoxic viruses. viruses with greater cytopathogenicity are more likely to cause sepsis in immunocompetent hosts than viruses with typically minimal associated cytopathology (69). effectsors of the host immune system, such as natural killer (NK), cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and complement, attack, and destroy virally infected host cells. double stranded viral ribonucleic acids are (dsRNA) recognized within the host cellular cytosol by retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors. retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs)- RIG-I, MDA5 and LGP2 undergo conformational change. intracellular TLR-7 and TLR-8 recognize single-stranded Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) of viruses like HPeV, the enteroviruses, human metapneumovirus, and influenza. intracellular TLR-9 recognizes double-stranded (ds) DNA of viruses like the herpes viruses. trypsin is upregulated and released by the vascular endothelium (38) trypsin is upregulated and released by the vascular endothelium (38) and has been shown to cleave circulating pro-matrix metalloproteinase (pro-MMP) released from macrophages to form activated MMPs (40). viral particles induce reactive oxygen species generation by circulating neutrophils, eosinophils, and macrophages endothelial cell Tie2 receptor antagonizes endothelial cell cytoskeleton. loss of glycocalyx and adherens junction integrity permits increased trans-cellular protein and fluid movement from the vascular lumen to the interstitium. endothelial cells are anchored to each other through adherens junctions. pathogenic strains of hantavirus appear to bind to cellular surface 3-integrins. pathogenic strains of hantavirus appear to bind to cellular surface 3-integrins. viral-induced host cytotoxicity is mediated by cytopathic effects, cellular reprogramming, and/or initiation of host immune cytotoxic responses. apoptosis may also indirectly promote apoptosis through macrophage reprogramming. the effect of TRAIL on other cell lines was not determined. it is plausible that the effect seen in T-cells may be more diffuse. invasiveness and pervasiveness of the viral infection is likely dictated by cell tropism. specific immunodeficiencies that place children at higher risk for viral sepsis include NK cell deficiency, interferon (IFN)- receptor deficiency, nuclear factor-kappa B essential modulator deficiency, severe combined immunodeficiency, severe T-cell lymphopenia in DiGeorge syndrome, agammaglobulinemia, and hyperIgM syndrome (71). a myriad of cardiopulmonary manifestations ranging from mild tachypnea to acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock can be seen. clinical presentation in patients with respiratory viral infections can range from completely asymptomatic to severe respiratory distress due to pneumonia. second born children at higher risk of HPeV-3 infection than firstborn. comorbid conditions reported to increase risk for severe infection include prematurity, congenital heart disease, chronic lung disease, and immunodeficiency. the leading three bacterial coinfections were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas spp., and Haemophilus influenza (87). in children hospitalized for RSV, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the most common organisms isolated in those who developed bacteremia (88). these secondary bacterial infections may exacerbate innate immune dysfunction (89) and convey substantially increased risk of worse outcomes (90, 91). HIV infection can lead to apoptosis of CD4 T-lymphocytes, defective T and B lymphocyte function, decreased production of IFN-, IL-2 and immunoglobulins, and decreased NK cell activity. the course of illness in patients with viral coinfections depend on virus-virus interaction. children with viral coinfections have not shown any association with increased clinical severity (104, 105) patients infected with HIV are at high risk of secondary viral infections such as CMV, HSV and respiratory viruses like RSV, influenza and metapneumovirus. diagnostic testing The diagnosis of viral sepsis is typically one of exclusion. the use of NAATs is limited by the high cost, delay in results and the inability to distinguish between viral nucleic acids from live viruses. a positive test could be a result of asymptomatic colonization, prolonged viral shedding or viral coinfection. the use of serum biomarkers and whole blood gene expression analysis (118) may serve a crucial role in this setting to discern viral from bacterial sepsis. a viral etiology must be considered and consultation with an infectious disease expert is recommended. Zaas et al. identified a 30-gene signature to discriminate symptomatic influenza A-infected subjects from both healthy and bacterially-infected subjects. a 2-transcript RNA signature showed promising results in its ability to distinguish between bacterial and viral infections. a 4-gene expression signature in whole blood to distinguish viral infections from other etiologies. palivizumab is an RSV-specific monoclonal antibody. it should be administered as a monthly injection during RSV season. studies have shown variable efficacy of palivizumab. aerosolized ribavirin is the only FDA-approved treatment available. seasonal influenza vaccine has demonstrated reasonable efficacy at attenuating influenza A and B viral disease (143) the vaccine has shown to be beneficial and tolerable in children with influenza if received within 48 h of illness (144, 145) influenza polymerase inhibitor T-705 (favipiravir) has been demonstrated significant attenuation of influenza virus activity (149) other agents under investigation include CS-8958, a long-acting neuraminidase inhibitor, and DAS181 an attachment inhibitor (150). neonatal HSV infection often occurs after transmission from asymptomatic women with primary HSV infection (162) a subunit HSV vaccine has shown promising results in prevention of genital herpes. antiviral prophylaxis with acyclovir in late pregnancy has been demonstrated to decrease viral shedding, leading to reduction in cesarean rates and recurrent herpes. highest mortality from RSV infection was seen at mean age of 6.2\u20137.5 months. three quarters of these cases associated with comorbid conditions. influenza epidemics and various pandemics have historically led to significant morbidity and mortality in the past. mortality from systemic HSV infection is usually due to severe coagulopathy, hepatitis and pneumonitis (15) increased mortality from metapneumovirus infection has been observed in children with chronic medical conditions, female gender and patients who acquired the infection in the hospital (184) meningitis from HPeVs is a common cause of sepsis in neonates and young children. consequent mortality is low in these patients (179)"}
