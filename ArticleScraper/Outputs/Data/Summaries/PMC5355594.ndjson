{"summary": "norovirus and rotavirus induce gastroenteritis, characterized by vomiting, diarrhea, and malaise (1, 2). Viral gastroenteritis causes significant morbidity and mortality in children, the elderly, and immunocompromised persons. currently there is no specific antiviral therapy for these viral pathogens. recombinant IFN- treatment is sufficient to prevent and cure MNoV infection (8). mice deficient for Ifnar1 show enhanced extraintestinal spread of virus. levels of MNoV fecal shedding are comparable to those of wild-type mice. FNAR1 may be expressed at lower levels or alternately trafficked, such as only to the apical portion of the cell (9, 20) differential receptor expression thus could account for complementary roles for different IFNs in protection against systemic infection (type I) and infection of mucosal sites. analysis of receptor expression levels may be insufficient. a conditional allele of Ifnlr1 (Ifnlr1f/f) was crossed to multiple different Cre lines for lineage-specific deletion of Ifnlr1 (Ifnlr1f/f) RNA was isolated from sites along the intestine, lung, mesenteric lymph node (MLN) and spleen. expression of Ifnlr1 was detected by quantitative real-time PCR of cDNA generated from these RNA samples. Embryonic stem (ES) cells targeted with a construct containing sequences homologous to Ifnlr1, an FLP recombinant target (FRT)-flanked lacZ and neomycin cassette were provided by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Mice derived from these ES cells were crossed with mice expressing Flp recombinase for deletion of the FRT-flanked cassette. Ifnlr1f/f-MRP8cre, Ifnlr1f/f-LysMcre, and Ifnlr1f/f-CD11ccre mice showed substantial depletion of Ifnlr1. expression of Ifnlr1 remained unchanged in lung, MLN, spleen, stomach, and duodenum in Ifnlr1f/f-Villincre mice. intestine and the lung, MLN and spleen, and epithelial and LP fractions from Ifnlr1f/f-Villincre (C), Ifnlr1f/f-MRP8cre (D), Ifnlr1f/f-LysMcre (E), and Ifnlr1f/f-CD11ccre (F) mice compared to their Ifnlr1f/f littermates. n = Ifnlr1f/f-Villincre mice phenocopied Ifnlr1/ and Ifnlr1f/ mice, exhibiting both elevated fecal shedding of MNoV and resistance to IFN- treatment. at day 7 postinoculation, IFNLR1 regulated fecal shedding of MNoV. PBS or recombinant IFN- was injected intraperitoneally on day 21 into wild-type and Ifnlr1/ (A), wild-type and Ifnlr1f/ (B), Ifnlr1f/f-Villincre (C), Ifnlr1f/f-MRP8cre (D), Ifnlr1f/f-LysMcre (E), or Ifnlr1f/f-CD11ccre (F expression of Ifnlr1 in IECs is required for IFN-mediated sterilizing innate immunity to persistent MNoV infection. we established Rag1/ Ifnlr1f/f-Villincre conditional double knockout mice. time course of MNoV genome copies shed into fecal pellets with time points at 7, 14, 21, 24, 28, and 35 days after CR6 infection. n = 6 to 14 mice per group, combined from three independent experiments, analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by multiple-comparison test. Ifnlr1f/f-Villincre mice showed increased titers of reovirus in small intestinal tissues as well as enhanced fecal shedding. these results demonstrate that expression of IFNLR1 in epithelial cells is essential for the control of reovirus infection by IFN- in the gut. Ileum and proximal colon tissues were isolated from wild-type (WT), Ifnlr1/, Ifnlr1f/f, and Ifnlr1f/f-Villincre mice. these tissues were then assessed for expression of canonical antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) Oas1a (42), Ifit1 (43), and Ifi44 (44). ***, P 0.001; ns, not significant. RNA was isolated from sites along the intestine, lung, mesenteric lymph node or spleen. Ifnlr1 expression was quantified by quantitative real-time PCR of RNA from sites depicted in panel A. n = 4 to 6 samples per group, from two independent experiments analyzed by Mann-Whitney test. ation of the small intestine into epithelial and lamina propria fractions revealed efficient deletion of Ifnlr1 in the epithelium of these mice. Ifnlr1f/f-MRP8cre, Ifnlr1f/f-LysMcre, and Ifnlr1f/f-CD11ccre mice showed no alterations in intestinal Ifnlr1 expression at the level of the whole tissues tested. ifnlr1 expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR of sites along the intestine and the lung, MLN and spleen. n = 4 to 7 samples per group, from two independent experiments, from two independent experiments. Ifnlr1/ mice allow higher levels of fecal MNoV shedding than wild-type mice at early time points. this treatment terminates MNoV replication in wild-type mice. this assay was applied to the four mouse strains with lineage-specific deletion of Ifnlr1. Ifnlr1f/f-Villincre mice showed no difference in comparison to Ifnlr1/ and Ifnlr1f/ mice along the full time course of infection. time course of MNoV genome copies shed into fecal pellets with time points at 7, 14, 21, 24, 28, and 35 days after CR6 infection. n = 6 to 12 mice per group, from two to three independent experiments, analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple-compa n = 8 to 11 mice per group, from two to three independent experiments. expression of Ifnlr1 in intestinal epithelium is essential for induction of IFN-mediated sterilizing innate immunity to persistent MNoV infection. IFN- responses in IECs limited persistent MNoV infection. IFN- signaling in IECs was essential for clearance of persistently infected MNoV by IFN-mediated sterilizing innate immunity. time course of MNoV genome copies shed into fecal pellets with time points at 7, 14, 21, 24, 28, and 35 days after CR6 infection. r1/ and Ifnlr1f/f-Villincre mice were orally inoculated with 108 PFU of reovirus strain type 1 Lang (T1L) at 4 days postinfection, viral titers in small intestinal tissues, including duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, were significantly higher. Ileum and proximal colon tissues were isolated from wild-type (WT), Ifnlr1/, Ifnlr1f/f, and Ifnlr1f/f-Villincre mice 1 day posttreatment with either PBS or IFN-. these tissues were then assessed for expression of canonical antiviral interferon-stimulated genes. n = 5 to 9 mice per group, combined from two independent experiments, analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple-comparison test. a P value of 0.001 was determined by ANOVA column factor for all tissues. IECs are the functionally dominant IFN--responding cells for endogenous and exogenous IFN- control of viruses in the intestine. expression of Ifnlr1 mRNA throughout the gut and in other extraintestinal tissues was quantified by qPCR analysis. IFN- controls influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus infection in the lung (45\u201347) and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) infection in the genital tract (48), redundantly with type I IFNs. adult IECs in neonates exhibit robust STAT1 activation after type I IFN treatment in vivo (9, 19, 20) IFN-mediated sterilizing innate immunity requires IEC expression of the receptor. rotavirus can be terminated by injecting IL-22 and IL-18 into Rag1/ mice. but this IL-22- and IL-18-mediated viral clearance does not induce IFN- or Stat1 activation. a plasmid encoding the CR6 genome was transfected into 293T cells. after two passages, BV2 cultures were frozen and thawed to liberate virions. titers of virus stocks were determined by plaque assay on BV2 cells. ant strain type 1 Lang (T1L) is a stock generated by plasmid-based rescue from cloned T1L cDNAs (53) cells were frozen and thawed three times, and virus was isolated by plaque purification using monolayers of L cells. reovirus virions were generated from second- or third-passage L-cell lysate stocks (55) Ifnlr1/ (B6.Cg-Ifnlr1tm1Palu) mice were obtained from Bristol-Myers Squibb (Seattle, WA) and backcrossed using speed congenics onto a C57BL/6J background (28) mice were orally gavaged with a dose of 106 PFU of strain CR6 at 6 to 8 weeks of age by the oral route in a volume of 25 l. for reovirus infections, mice were orally gavaged with a dose of 108 PFU of strain CR6 at 6 to 8 weeks. the dissociated cells were collected as the epithelial fraction, consisting predominantly of IECs. the remaining tissue was used as the lamina propria fraction. Isolation of neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. dendritic cells were confirmed to be 70 to 85% CD11c-AF488 (BioLegend) single positive or CD11c-AF488 and B220-PE (BD Bioscience) double positive. quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. RNA from stool was isolated using a ZR-96 viral RNA kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) standard curves for quantitative qPCR assays were generated to facilitate absolute quantification of transcript copy numbers. for Rps29, the PCR product using the above-described primers was cloned into the p-ENTR/D-TOPO vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and for Ifnlr1 a full-length Ifnlr1 cDNA clone (5036481; Open Biosystems) was used. a plasmid encoding the CR6 genome was transfected into 293T cells to generate infectious virus. after two passages, BV2 cultures were frozen and thawed to liberate virions. titers were determined by plaque assay on BV2 cells. purified reovirus virions were generated from second- or third-passage L-cell lysate stocks (55). virions were extracted from infected cell lysates using vertrel XF (Dupont) bands corresponding to virions (1.36 g/cm3) were collected and dialyzed in virion storage buffer (150 mM NaCl, 15 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM Tris-HCl Ifnlr1/ (B6.Cg-Ifnlr1tm1Palu) mice were obtained from Bristol-Myers Squibb (Seattle, WA) and backcrossed using speed congenics onto a C57BL/6J background. a conditional-ready allele in which exon 2 is flanked by loxP sites, designated Ifnlr1f/f, was created. mice were orally gavaged with a dose of 108 PFU of strain T1L virus at 6 to 8 weeks in a volume of 100 l. for treatment of mice, 25 g of IFN- diluted in PBS was injected intraperitoneally. tissues were flash frozen in a bath of ethanol and dry ice. r1f/f-MRP8cre mice and Ifnlr1f/f littermates were lysed using red blood cell lysis buffer (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) neutrophils were isolated using the mouse neutrophil isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) Isolated neutrophils were confirmed to be 95 to 98% double positive for CD11b-allophycocyanin (APC) and Ly6G-fluorescein isothiocyanate RNA from stool was isolated using a ZR-96 viral RNA kit. five microliters of RNA from stool or 1 g of RNA from tissue was used as a template for cDNA synthesis with the ImPromII reverse transcriptase system. DNA contamination was removed using the DNAfree kit (Life Technologies) product using the above-described primers was cloned into the p-ENTR/D-TOPO vector. a full-length Ifnlr1 cDNA clone (5036481; Open Biosystems) was used. for Oas1a, Ifit1, and Ifi44, absolute transcripts were quantitated based on target sequence-containing gBlocks."}
