{"summary": "results Data analysis We have studied the available data for total (cumulative) number of cases R(t) as a function time t and extracted the data for number of new cases I(t) from these. most of the earlier studies have dealt with the actual numbers of cases. c and T depend on the values of and q. the removed population in the model corresponds to the cumulative infected cases. this fitting form is used for the cumulative data of infected cases. exponent values and tp are tabulated in Table 1. the errors in the estimation of exponents are for a, for c and for T (beween 0.9 to 7.6 percent) tp is also directly proportional to the total duration, being least for liberia and maximum for Guinea. for 1 2, it shows short range behaviour. the underlying network must be short ranged. to get results comparable to the real data, one should use a value of larger than 1. we show the data by the blue curve in Fig. 3(a) using q = 0.58. this range is 0.05 while for q it is 0.02. the red curve has a peak occurring earliest while the disease lasts for the shortest duration which corresponds to liberia. a/c corresponds to the saturation value of R(t) and c and T determine the value of tp. a/c corresponds to the saturation value of R(t) and c and T determine the value of tp. Table 3 shows that the density of infected population was same for Sierra Leone and Liberia and order of magnitude smaller in Guinea. compared with the real data, we find that the timescales in the real data are approximately 8\u20139.2 times the timescales in the Monte Carlo simulations. the rescaled data Rs(t) and R(t are plotted against \u201creal time\u201d in Fig. 4. the agreement for Liberia is not that good, however, the data for Liberia are somewhat irregular and it is difficult to fit them with a smooth function very accurately. 59.5716 1.33 228.88 0.362399 Liberia 0.0320618 0.00464 0.0443399 0.00636 42.5638 2.02 132.62 0.723091 Sierra Leone 0.0274868 0.00450 0.0387566 0.00603 57.3669 2.41 186.47 0.709215 The values of a and c can be compared to those appearing in Table 2. a minimal model would consist of two parameters like the one considered in ref. 20. the agents have two nearest neighbour connections and a random long range connection to a agent located at a distance l with probability l. the parameter essentially controls the network structure and the other parameter is of course the infection probability q. a peak value for I(t) will occur at tp = T log(1/c) the associated values of the exponents a, c and T are found out for the three countries and the values of tp are also extracted. tp is directly proportional to the total duration, being least for liberia and maximum for Guinea. the behaviour of the network depends on the value of. the network behaves as a small world network for 1 and as a regular one dimensional lattice for > 2. for 1 2, it shows short range behaviour. we show the data by the blue curve in Fig. 3(a) using q = 0.58. the red curve has a peak occurring earliest while the disease lasts for the shortest duration. the green curve shows a peak occurring at a later time and the duration is also longer. the blue curve in Fig. 3(b) corresponds to Guinea as the peak value occurs at a slightly larger time compared to the green curve while the duration is longest. the quantitative values of tp are also consistent with the real data. a/c corresponds to the saturation value of R(t) and c and T determine the value of tp. the actual population who are susceptible may form only a subset of the total population so saturation values can be different changing the values of a and c. the rescaled data Rs(t) and R(t are plotted against \u201creal time\u201d in Fig. 4 and show an excellent agreement for Guinea and a reasonably good agreement for Sierra Leone. the data for Liberia are somewhat irregular and it is difficult to fit them with a smooth function very accurately. tp values are approximately 8\u20139 times compared to the tp values obtained in the Monte Carlo simulations (Table 2). tp values are approximately 8\u20139 times compared to the tp values obtained in the Monte Carlo simulations. the density of population is 79.4/km2 and 40.43/km2 respectively for these two countries29. the population densities of Guinea (40.90/km2)30 and Liberia are quite close so that one should use the same value. however, a smaller value of q indicates less infection probability which is possible if proper medical care and control measurements are taken. the rescaling is somewhat manipulated by the results of the model. the ratio of the saturation values for the real data and the simulated data corresponds to the factor. in principle one should incorporate more factors in the model to fit the real data independently. the first available data is from March 2014 when Guinea was already struck with the disease for some time. for liberia and Sierra Leone, the data for initial stage are available, however these are sparse and unreliable; often the data for number of death exceeds the number of cases detected. for this reason, the entire data set must be handled carefully. the average degree of each node is three and it is expected that the inhomogeneity of the degree distribution is negligible. the disease spreading process is then simulated by assuming a single infected agent at any randomly chosen site in the beginning. all the neighbours are likely to be infected with a probability q. the data for the initial stage of the disease is missing. for liberia and Sierra Leone, the data for initial stage are available. however these are sparse and unreliable; often the data for number of deaths exceeds the number of cases. the disease spreading process is then simulated by assuming a single infected agent at any randomly chosen site in the beginning. all the neighbours are likely to be infected with a probability q in the next step. from the agents who are infected in the second step, the disease spreads to their neighbours."}
