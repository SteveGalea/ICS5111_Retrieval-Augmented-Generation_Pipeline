{"summary": "Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs to the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. it contains many viruses that cause human diseases, such as dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and west Nile encephalitis. after ZIKV was first isolated in Uganda in 1947, the virus was regarded as asymptomatic [3], until outbreaks of febrile disease in the Yap Islands of the Federated States of Micronesia, French Poly a more economical and broadly applicable murine model is urgently needed. KM is the most highly produced in china; it is used in toxicology and neurology studies owing to its high yield, good quality, resistance, and strong adaptability. manangeeswaran et al. have initially studied the neurodegeneration in the CNS of immunocompetent neonatal C57BL/6. the results suggest such an immunocompetent mice can also have susceptibility to ZIKV [35] suckling mouse models represent an important step toward understanding severe neurological outcomes. suckling mouse models may be useful for drug screening, vaccine tests, and general ZIKV research. mice were breast-fed by their own mothers and divided into groups of 5\u20136 for BALB/c and C57BL/6 and 10\u201312 for KM. weights of each nest of mice were measured at birth. topathological examinations were fixed for 16\u201324 h in 10% paraformaldehyde. mice that did not respond to stimuli were regarded as moribund. humanely euthanized by inhaling 40% carbon dioxide (CO2) tissues for paraffin embedding were submitted to Guangzhou Huayin Medical Science Company Limited (Guangzhou, China) they were processed and sectioned before staining with haematoxylin and eosin (H and E) and examined microscopically for histopathological changes. 20 L of the inoculum was administered to each mouse strain by multipoint subcutaneous injection. each suckling mouse was injected with 105 TCID50 ZIKV. five inoculation positions were established, including the back of the neck, the centre of the back, the front of the tail, and the waist. viral RNA was extracted from 140 L of tissue homogenate using the QIAamp\u00ae (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) Viral RNA Mini Kit. was quantified by real-time RT-PCR using the LightCycler480\u00ae Instrument (Roche Diagnostics, Roche Instrument Center AG, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) KM (n = 50), BALB/c (n = 50), and C57BL/6 mice (n = 50) were monitored post-infection for symptoms and signs throughout the disease progression. onset (4\u20136 days) was characterized by slow movement, lower limb weakness, hunched posture, trembling, etc. phenotype was used as an index of onset (Figure 2E) by day 9 or 10, BALB/c suddenly showed upper or lower limb weakness, hunched posture, ruffled fur, toe-walking, etc.. after a two-day struggle, rapidly recovered, implying a very short onset time. one endangered or dead mouse for the C57BL/6 strain was observed on day 11, one on day 13, and two on day 15. daily weight data were analysed by t-tests. * p 0.05. disease progression was divided into incubation, onset, exacerbation, and recovery. disease progression was divided into incubation, onset, exacerbation, and recovery. phenotypes were referred to as movement disorders (MD) (Movie S3 and S4) and led to the highest morbidity, 100%. each strain was serially euthanized three mice per day during the disease course at onset, recovery, or exacerbation in both repeat experiments. viral loads were determined in the brains, spleens, livers, kidneys, and the males\u2019 testes. for all strains, the viral load was highest in the brain. in the liver, the virus in the spleen was detected at 1\u20132 days after the onset of illness. only three dissected animals at the incubation period and two in day 4 of the onset period were male. the virus in the brain and kidney of C57BL/6 was uniformly distributed and was closely related to disease progression. another two-lower-limb paralysis KM mouse exhibited large quantities of virus throughout the body. the BALB/c mouse only carried the virus in the brain. eosinophilic necrosis, coagulative necrosis, glial cell nodules, ghost cells, neutrophil infiltration, and lymphocytic infiltration. no unusual findings were observed in the periocular tissue of mice with suspected ocular symptoms. KM, and BALB/c mice exhibited malacia in the cerebral cortex during onset. eosinophilic necrosis in KM was less serious than that in KM. eosinophilic necrosis in KM was less serious than that in KM. splenic sinusoid exhibited remarkable congestion, with erythroblastic islands and macrophages. macrophages were detected in splenic tissue, with hemosiderin detected in the cytoplasm, indicating chronic congestion. similar effects, like reactive lymphoid hyperplasia in lymphoid follicles of the white pulp, and congestion of the splenic sinusoid in the red pulp. lower: Oedema and hyperplasia of hepatocytes with erythroblastic islands. upper: hyperaemia in the spleen with reactive hyperplasia of the lymphoid tissue. lower: hyperaemia in the spleen with reactive hyperplasia of the lymphoid tissue. KM (n = 50), BALB/c (n = 50), and C57BL/6 mice (n = 50) were monitored post-infection for symptoms and signs throughout the disease progression. KM and BALB/c suckling mice exhibited the same disease progression. onset (4\u20136 days) was characterized by slow movement, lower limb weakness, hunched posture, trembling, etc. in these cases, the lower limb was unable to support the body to maintain balance. by day 9 or 10, BALB/c suddenly showed upper or lower limb weakness, hunched posture, ruffled fur, toe-walking, etc. green dots show mice used for histopathological examination (n = 4) black dots show mice that died within 24 h (n = 7) weight changes of each strain were recorded, panel B for KM: phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (n = 6) vs. Zika Virus (ZIKV) (n = 17), panel C for BALB/c: PBS (n = 5) vs. ZIKV (n = 19) and serious movement disorders (SMD) during exacerbation. two mice died accidentally, and all remaining invalid mice manifested SMD. disease progression was divided into incubation, onset, exacerbation, and recovery. the weights of infected C57BL/6 and their control group were significantly different (p 0.05) beginning on day 13, which coincided with exacerbation. KM and BALB/c did not show obvious differences in weight between infected and control mice (p > 0.05) in the liver, the virus in the spleen was detected at 1\u20132 days after the onset of illness. only three dissected animals at the incubation period and two in day 4 of the onset period were male. the testis was virus-infected before day 3 and exhibited a decreasing trend. Kunming mice showed paralysis of two lower limbs (Movie S7) or no response. another two-lower-limb paralysis KM mouse showed large quantities of virus throughout the body. another two-lower-limb paralysis KM mouse showed large quantities of virus throughout the body. histology Organs were harvested at onset and recovery from KM and BALB/c mice. each three mice with suspected ocular symptoms were also killed at its onset and recovery for eye injuries. the molecular layer of cerebrum showed apparent glial cell nodules. encephalomalacia foci in the cerebellum worsened and encephalomalacia foci in the cerebrum developed. eosinophilic necrosis in KM was less serious than that in KM. glial nodule (white arrow) and neuronal eosinophilic necrosis (black arrow) in the cerebrum. overt encephalomalacia focus with an explicit boundary to normal tissue. erythroblastic islands and macrophages were detected in splenic tissue. (A\u2013I) H&Estaining represent the spleen, liver, and kidney. KM, BALB/c, and C57BL/6 represent the spleen, liver, and kidney. in KM and BALB/c mice, liver cell oedema was observed without hyperplasia. erythroblastic islands disappeared and hepatocytes near the central venous region were atrophic, indicating chronic congestion. all three mice maintained normal structures of nephridial tissue during onset. the morbidity of KM was only 39.4%, with non-uniform signs and symptoms. a slight yellow extraocular exudate was detected in some of the remaining unaffected individuals, suggesting the presence of ocular changes. the lack of ocular symptom diagnosis, the difficulty in acquiring tear samples in suckling mice, and incomplete periocular tissue sections limited our ability to explain the ocular findings in mice. clinical cases involving foetuses and infants exhibit cerebellar hypoplasia, microglial nodules, and neuronal and glial cell degeneration and necrosis [54], similar to our observations in mice. the appearance of chronic ecchymosis in the liver and spleen of C57BL/6 mice revealed high susceptibility. the disappearance of erythroblastic islands coincided exactly with viral clearance, implying a relationship between viral elimination or transfer and the haematological system. the testes of ifnar1-/- mice have high viral loads after ZIKV infection. however, it is not clear whether type I IFN is an important regulatory mechanism when ZIKV passes the blood-testis barrier. viremia in KM and BALB/c mice persists for 14 days. viremia in KM and BALB/c mice only continued for seven days. despite lower morbidity, onset of KM mice exhibited uniform neurological manifestations. BALB/c offers the option of testing conditions that may lead to clinical ocular findings. despite the application mentioned above, we should be very cognizant of the limitation that discoveries in such a ZIKV-infected suckling mice model may not be extrapolate to the physiological complications largely found in adults."}
