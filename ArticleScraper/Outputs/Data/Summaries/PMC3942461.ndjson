{"summary": "white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is an enveloped virus with a circular double strand DNA of about 300 kb. the virus mainly infects animals of Decapoda and causes high lethality to shrimp. the outbreak depends on the interactions between the pathogen, host and environment. exopalamon carincauda has the potential to be an ideal experimental animal for crustacean with the virtues stated before [21] there is no report about the initiation mechanisms of WSSV acute infection induced by temperature variation. in this study, shrimp E. carincauda, cultured at 18\u00b0C, were challenged with WSSV. each shrimp was injected with WSSV inocula at a dose of 7000 copies. the culture temperature of Group T was raised to 25\u00b0C within 3 hours. at 6, 12 and 24 hours post temperature rising, 7 shrimp from each group were sacrificed and their cephalothoraxes were collected. extracted DNA was subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel and quantified by nanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer. four-fold serially diluted solutions of a plasmid harboring the gene encoding the extra-cellular part of WSSV envelope protein VP28 were used as standard to generate a standard curve.

WSSV load experienced sharp leap from 4.16103 copies/ng DNA at 27 hours post infection to 9.65104 copies/ng DNA at 30 hpi. a total of 25,399 unigenes (41.04% of all unigenes) were matched to known genes in NR database. a large percentage of sequences with no matches in the protein database was also reported elsewhere. 3.1 DEGs involved in energy production and glycometabolic process go analysis showed that almost all the DEGs related to energy production were up-regulated in Group WT. this result was consistent with previous studies that proteins in electron transport and ATP synthesis were up-regulated upon WSSV infection [28], [29]. rate dehydrogenase with NAD as the coenzyme were down-regulated in Group WT. the isocitrate dehydrogenase with NADP as the coenzyme was up-regulated in group WT. the expression profiles of ATP-citrate synthase (CL4068.Contig2_All) and triosephosphate isomerase B (Unigene3409_All) in the three groups were analyzed by real-time gene annotation E-value Catalyzed pathway Expression change CL3945.Contig2_All ATP-citrate synthase 0 CL4965.Contig3_All Isocitrate dehydrogenase [NADP], mitochondrial 0 up Unigene3409_All triosephosphate isomerase B (B) apoptosis has been regarded as a nonspecific defense mechanism against virus infection in eukaryotic cells, aborting virus multiplication by a premature lysis of infected cells. apoptosis has been regarded as a nonspecific defense mechanism against virus infection in eukaryotic cells, aborting virus multiplication by a premature lysis of infected cells. tig1_All and Unigene37574_All (B) were further confirmed by real-time PCR. GO analysis of the DEGs related to positive regulation of cell death and anti-apoptosis. cell cycle consists of four phases, gap 1 (G1), synthesis (S), gap 2 (G2) and mitosis (M) in succession. 10 DEGs were annotated as cyclins, which were all down-regulated (File S7) expression profiles of two cyclin genes were further confirmed by real-time PCR. virulence difference between MV and Shope fibroma virus [50] may be one of the causes of the high virulence of WSSV. GO terms Percentage of down-regulatedDEGs (%) Percentage of up-regulatedDEGs (%) GO:0007049 cell cycle. expression profiles of unigene42832_All (a DNA primase), unigene20038_All (a DNA polymerase) and CL2571.Contig1_All (B) both annotated as cyclin. their expression in Group T, Group W and Group WT at 6, 12 and 24 hours post temperature rising was tested by real-time PCR. significant differences between the three groups are indicated by different characters (P0.05). the adverse effect on the cellular DNA synthesis in the infection course of other viruses such as frog virus 3 and herpes simplex virus were also reported. the repressed state of cellular DNA replication ensures that the virus will have unrivalled access to precursors of DNA synthesis [45], [51]\u2013[53]. GO analysis showed that almost all the DEGs related to energy production were up-regulated in Group WT, suggesting an increased energy need and a boosted energy production. this result was consistent with previous studies that proteins in electron transport and ATP synthesis were up-regulated upon WSSV infection. isocitrate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase were all up-regulated in Group WT, suggesting a reduced glycometabolism level. however the isocitrate dehydrogenase with NADP as the coenzyme was up-regulated in Group WT, suggesting that a reduced glycometabolism level through the tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway (TCA) metabolic changes resembling the Warburg effect in shrimp hemocytes were detected in the early stage of WSSV infection. it was proposed that the enhanced aerobic glycosis and ATP energy production favored the virus during the earlier phases of its replication cycle. DEGs related to positive regulation of cell death were down-regulated. DEGs related to anti-apoptosis were up-regulated in Group WT. apoptosis has been regarded as a nonspecific defense mechanism against virus infection in eukaryotic cells. s with annotation to E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (9/10, File S6) were down-regulated. two genes (CL1901.Contig1_All and Unigene37574_All) were further confirmed by real-time PCR. 3.3 DEGs involved in cell cycle were down-regulated in Group WT. the cell cycle consists of four phases, gap 1 (G1), synthesis (S), gap 2 (G2) and mitosis (M) in succession. in order to carry through this vital process orderly, a series of mechanisms have been developed. hepatitis virus (MHV) infection resulted in an arrest at the G0/G1 phase. it was reported that alterations in cell cycle transit during virus infection might be very important for the virulence difference between MV and Shope fibroma virus (SFV) this may be also one of the causes of the high virulence of WSSV. expression profiles of unigene42832_All (A) and CL2571.Contig1_All (B) both annotated as cyclin. expression profiles of unigene42832_All (a DNA primase), unigene20038_All (a DNA polymerase) and CL2500.Contig1_All (a DNA topoisomerase) were further detected by real-time PCR. all and Unigene20038_All, the repressed state lasted till 24 hptr at least when shrimp death began to occur. all these data indicated that WSSV proliferation inhibited the cellular DNA replication process. the adverse effect on the cellular DNA synthesis in the infection course of other viruses such as frog virus 3 and herpes simplex virus were also reported. expression profiles of unigene83_All annotated as DNA primase (A), Unigene20038_All annotated as DNA polymerase (B) and CL2500.Contig1_All annotated as DNA topoisomerase (C) were tested by real-time PCR. the values are shown as meanSE. actin binding genes (Unigene7524_All, and Unigene42358_All) and the ADMA9 (Unigene37466_All) in the three groups at the sampling time were detected by real-time PCR to analyze whether the down-regulation of these genes was an inducement or a result of WSSV acute proliferation. expression profiles of unigene7524_All (A) and unigene42358_All (B) both annotated as actin binding expression profile of unigene37466_All annotated as disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 9 (ADAM9) was tested by real-time PCR. it was interesting that 6 out of 7 crustin genes in the DEGs were down regulated and one of them was completely repressed. crustin may function as a WSSV-resistant gene and was possibly a responsible factor for the slowed infection pace of Group W. the virulence of viruses is partially related to their ability to suppress the host anti-viral defense. the up-regulated expression of this gene was due to WSSV infection. it was induced by the infection of many other viruses including hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus, hepatitis C virus, HCMV, rotavirus and dengue virus (DENV) the infection of Group WT was at the end of the latent stage. the virus hasn\u2019t undertaken rapid replication. understanding the interactions between the host and WSSV at the initial stage of acute infection will help to get a deep insight into the pathogenesis of WSSV. file S11 DEGs annotated as GRP78, HSP70 or HSP90.
