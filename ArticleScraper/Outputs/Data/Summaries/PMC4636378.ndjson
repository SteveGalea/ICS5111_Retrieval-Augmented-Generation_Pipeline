{"summary": "mixed infections of multiple pathogens are becoming common in swine farms. porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine pseudorabies virus (TGEV), porcine parvovirus (PPV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) are major pathogens causing heavy economic losses in swine industry. RNA is easily degradable as compared to DNA, so in PCR-based methods of detecting RNA viruses, viral genomic RNA extracted from field samples should be used to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA) first. it is still needed to test whether this method can be used in the detection of RNA virus. TGEV, an enveloped virus with a positive-stranded RNA genome, has been recognized as a principal causative agent of enteric disease. duplex UNDP-PCR assay is suitable for simultaneous detection of RNA and DNA viruses in early viral infection, providing effective approach for diagnosis of swine diseases. TGEV, PCV2 and PPV were propagated in PK-15 cells. PRRSV was propagated in Marc-145 cells. four types of cells were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified eagle medium. Primers for conventional RT-PCR method of detecting TGEV and PEDV were designed using primer-blast software on the basis of TGEV and PEDV highly conserved region of ORF1a. all the primers, probes and oligonucleotides designed for this experiment owned higher specificity to make sure diagnosis more precise.

PCR was performed as described in previous study. the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of the UNDP-PCR assay for TGEV genomic RNA was extracted using RNA Kit and reverse transcribed to synthesize cDNA. the part of TGEV ORF1a gene was amplified from cDNA using the primers (5\u2019-CGTAATGGTGACAGCCGAT-3\u2019/5\u2019-AGCAGCATCACGGAAACCAT-3\u2019) the 435 bp amplified products were clone sensitivity of duplex UNDP-PCR assay for TGEV and PCV2 were diluted serially from 104 to 1 copies/ml respectively. the diluted samples containing same viral copy numbers of TGEV and PCV2 per ml were mixed, and then tested by single MMPs-based and duplex MMPs-based duplex UNDP-PCR. 162 serum samples were collected from healthy pigs in pig-producing farms near Xianyang and Baoji of Shannxi province, china. the pigs were humanely euthanized by injecting with 15 mg/kg of Ketamine in the jugular vein, then 3\u20135 ml of blood samples were collected from each pig by jugular venipuncture. primer-blast software for conventional PCR/RT-PCR detection of PCV2, PPV, PRRSV and CSFV were designed as described in previous studies. primers, probes and oligonucleotides were synthesized by Sangon (Shanghai, China) CAAATATTTCGTTTTTAGTTGGTGTCCG 78\u2013109 Probe 2 Hybridization 5\u2019NH2-T15CGAATAGGAAGACTAGGCACGTTGTCCG 360\u2013385 Probe 3 Hybridization 5\u2019NH2-T15ACTCATCATAAGAAGCCAAACAGGCTTTGCAT 6146\u20136177 Probe 4 Hybridization 5\u2019NH2-T15GTGTCTCTGCCTTGCAGTCCTAGAGCAC 6494\u20136519 Probe 5 Hy auNPs coated with TGEV or PCV2 specific oligos were washed and resuspended in 100 l sterile deionized water. a final concentration of 0.01 M PBS (0.1 M NaCl in 0.01 M of phosphate buffer, PH 7.0) was developed by adding 0.1 M PBS to the reaction tube three times to incubate for more than 48 hours at room temperature. lysis buffer (0.01 M Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.015 M NaCl, 0.5% SDS, pH 8.0) was mixed with 2 l of probe-coated MMPs and 5 hybridization buffer (5SSC, 0.1% Tween-20 and 2% SDS in H2O) mixture was incubated for 30 minutes by stirring. the 435 bp amplified products were cloned into pMD-19T simple Vector. the concentration of the plasmid was measured by nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer. the viral copy number in samples per ml was tested by real-time PCR. the specificity of duplex UNDP-PCR, PPV, PEDV, PRRSV and CSFV were tested by the established method. the inter-assay and intra-assay tests were carried out in triplicate by detecting three different concentrations of mixed serum containing serial diluted TGEV. replicases and only exists in genomic RNA, while the last third exists in both genomic RNAs (gRNA) and subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) to encode structural and nonstructural proteins of virus [21, 29, 30]. in this assay, we first quantified viral number using primers targeted to TGEV gRNA and different sgmRNAs. six targeted regions were selected from the 5\u2019 end, middle and 3\u2019 end of the ORF1a for designing probe 1-functionalized MMPs and oligo 2-functionalized Au-NPs are optimal for capture of TGEV RNA and formation of sandwich complex. functional magnetic microparticles MMP-p1, -p2, -p3, -p4, -p5 and -p6 were incubated with RNA of TGEV in hybridization buffer at 40\u00b0C for 30 minutes. then the complexes were reverse transcribed into cDNA, which were detected by TGEV visible targeted bands around 501 bp could be seen in lanes representing serum samples with viral concentrations ranging from 103 copies/ml to 20 copies/ml respectively. sensitivity of UNDP-PCR specific for TGEV was 250-fold that of conventional RT-PCR for TGEV. PCV2, PPV, PEDV, CSFV, PRRSV and blood collected from healthy swine were detected by UNDP-PCR for TGEV as control. no specific PCR products of 501 bp were obtained from the assay using PCV2, CSFV, PRRSV, PEDV, PPV or healthy pigs serum as pending samples. the detection limits of single MMPs-based and duplex MMPs-based duplex UNDP-PCR were identical with 20 copies/ml for TGEV and PCV2 in serum. however, at least 5000 copies/ml of PCV2 and TGEV serum sample was able to be detected by conventional duplex PCR/RT-PCR assay. these results suggested that the sensitivity of duplex UNDP-PCR specific for PCV2 and TGEV was 250-fold that of two viruses (TGEV and PCV2) and unrelated viruses (PPV, CSFV, PEDV, PRRSV) and serum of healthy pigs were tested to evaluate the specificity of the single MMPs-based and duplex MMPs-based duplex UNDP-PCR assay. duplex UNDP-PCR assay showed that 48 samples were PCV2 positive, 15 samples were TGEV positive, but none of samples were found to be positive for both PCV2 and TGEV. the positive detection rate of duplex UNDP-PCR was 29.6% for PCV2, 9.3% for TGEV and 3.7% for PCV2 and TGEV preclinical infection. the results were consistent when single MMPs-based and duplex UNDP-PCR were used to detect these samples. the detection rate of PCV2 and/or TGEV infected preclinical samples using conventional PCR and RT-PCR, single MMPs-based UNDP-PCR and duplex MMPs-based UNDP-PCR methods. 1 sample was between 500 and 50 copies/ml, and 1 sample was below 50 copies/ml. the TGEV viral loads of 3 samples were between 5000 and 500 copies/ml. 2 sample were between 500 and 50 copies/ml, and 1 sample was below 50 copies/ml. TGEV, an enveloped virus of the coronaviridae family, contains a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of 28.5 kb. the first two-thirds of the viral genome encodes two replicases and only exists in genomic RNA. the last third exists in both genomic RNAs (gRNA) and subgenomic mRNAs to encode structural and nonstructural proteins of virus. all six probes could capture TGEV RNA, but MMP-p1 and MMP-p2 exhibited higher capture ability for TGEV RNA. oligo 1 and 2-coated Au-NPs shared same targeted sequence with probe 1 to 6. serial 10-fold dilutions of TGEV in serum samples were tested. sensitivity of UNDP-PCR for RNA virus was 250-fold. serial dilutions of TGEV serum samples were detected by RT-PCR. the reproducibility of UNDP-PCR for TGEV was estimated by three independent runs for three consecutive days. three different concentrations of TGEV serum samples were detected by UNDP-PCR for TGEV. sensitivity of single MMPs-based and duplex MMPs-based duplex UNDP-PCR assay for both DNA and RNA viruses. serum samples of TGEV and PCV2 were diluted serially and mixed as templates. the detection limits of single MMPs-based and duplex MMPs-based duplex UNDP-PCR were identical with 20 copies/ml for TGEV and PCV2. mixed quantified serum samples of PCV2 and TGEV were tested by duplex MMPs-based duplex UNDP-PCR assay. the DNA of PCV2 and RNA of TGEV were extracted as the template for conventional duplex PCR/RT-PCR detection. MMPs-based duplex UNDP-PCR assay in triplicates and in three independent runs. Agarose gel electrophoresis of the single MMPs-based duplex UNDP-PCR products. duplex UNDP-PCR assay showed that 48 samples were PCV2 positive, 15 samples were TGEV positive, but none of samples were positive for both PCV2 and TGEV. the positive samples detected by the duplex UNDP-PCR method included all of the samples found to be positive by the conventional duplex PCR/RT-PCR. virus samples to evaluate viral loads of PCV2 and TGEV in all positive samples. 7 samples were over 5000 copies/ml, 15 samples were between 5000 and 500 copies/ml. 23 samples were between 500 and 50 copies/ml, and 3 samples were below 50 copies/ml in viral load. UNDP-PCR assay was found to be the best method for detecting DNA and RNA viruses in preclinical samples simultaneously. all the results indicated that UNDP-PCR-based assay was a rapid and economical approach with high specificity and high sensitivity. traditional approaches to detect mixed infection of RNA and DNA viruses present some limitations, such as complex virus genome isolation procedures. duplex UNDP-PCR could detect DNA and RNA virus from large-scale serum samples simultaneously. magnetic beads and gold nanoparticles coated with duplex specific probes for TGEV and PCV2 were added to capture and enrich viral nucleic acid. the results of detection for preclinical samples indicated that duplex UNDP-PCR assay (29.6% for PCV2, 9.3% for TGEV and 3.7% for PCV2 and TGEV mixed infection) described here was more sensitive than conventional detection methods (4.3% for PCV2, 1.2% for TGEV and 0% for PCV2 and TGEV mixed infection)"}
