{"summary": "virulent mycobacterial strains are less apoptogenic than their attenuated counterparts. in active TB patients the expression of genes that promote apoptosis is diminished. apoptosis is a virulence trait aimed to preserve its cellular niche. some reports document the participation of the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway. infection with attenuated Mtb strains results in mitochondrial outer membrane permeability with release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase 9 [12, 13]. reticulum stress and lysosome pathways have been implicated in macrophage apoptosis provoked by mycobacteria. pqH triggers an intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway, with the participation of cytochrome c and the apoptosis-inducing mitochondrial factor (AIF) pqH triggers an intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway, with the participation of cytochrome c and the apoptosis-inducing mitochondrial factor (AIF) polymyxin B, Ponceau red, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA); a subcellular protein fractionation kit fractionation was obtained from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL, USA). the fluorescent lipophilic dye 3,3\u2032 dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR, western blots with the IT-19 mAb failed to demonstrate LpqH in cell walls of native M. smegmatis bacilli. cell wall fractions were electron-transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. a 19-kDa strip was excised and processed to be used in apoptosis assays as a control. adherent cells were cultured with 10% fetal bovine serum. this step is considered necessary to get rid of nonadherent cells, death cells, and nonmacrophagic cells. cells were incubated with 0.5, 5, or 50 g of LpqH for 1 or 24 h. d with 100 L radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) cell lysates were centrifuged (34025.6 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C) and the supernatant was obtained. membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugate supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 390.6 g for 5 min. TNF- was measured after 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min treatment. expression of death receptors and their ligands was determined by a cell surface ELISA method. cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with blocking mAb to human TNF- (1 g/mL), human TNFR1 (5 g/mL), or human TNFR2 (1.5 g/mL) inhibition assays were also performed with blocking mAbs to human Fas (500 ng/mL) and to human FasL (32 ng/mL) cells were diluted with PBS to a final volume of 1 mL and analyzed by flow cytometry. immunofluorescence of untreated cells or cells treated with LpqH for 1 and 24 h was analyzed. slides were washed once with PBS and a drop a 0.05% saponin solution in PBS was added for 5 min, rinsed with PBS, and incubated for 1 h with the anti-AIF mAb. slides were mounted with an anti-mouse IgG antibody labeled with CY5. goat polyclonal antibody to human cytochrome c was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. horseradish peroxidase-conjugated control isotype antibodies to goat IgG and mouse IgG were from Dako (Carpinteria, CA, USA) a cell-death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Plus was obtained from Roche Diagnostics (Penzberg, Germany). cell wall fractions were obtained by centrifugation and washed with ice-cold sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM/L) to isolate LpqH, cell wall fractions were obtained by sonication of bacteria at 20 KHz in iced water. protein was resolved by 12% or 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blots with the IT-19 mAb failed to demonstrate LpqH in cell walls of native M. smegmatis bacilli. Western blots with the IT-19 mAb failed to demonstrate LpqH in cell walls of native M. smegmatis bacilli. cells were incubated with 0.5, 5, or 50 g of LpqH for 1 or 24 h at 37\u00b0C. apoptosis was measured by ELISA with a cell-death detection kit. whole cell extracts were obtained after cells were lysed and vortexed with 100 L radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. cell lysates were centrifuged (34025.6 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C) cells were preincubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with 20 M of the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. cells were incubated with 5 g LpqH for 1 or 24 h at 37\u00b0C. apoptosis was measured by ELISA as described before. cells were incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-labeled goat or mouse anti-IgG antibodies. cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-labeled goat or mouse anti-IgG antibodies diluted 1/1000. 100 Lof ABTS solution were added to the cells. cells were incubated with 5 g LpqH for 1 and 24 h and washed three times with PBS. 40 nM DIOC6 was added to pellet for 30 min at 37\u00b0C in the dark. cytochrome c, diluted 1/200 in PBS Tween 20, 0.01%, overnight. a secondary antibody to goat IgG labeled with peroxidase was used diluted 1/1000. immunofluorescence to Detect AIF in nuclei of macrophages. a transformed M. smegmatis strain that overexpresses the LpqH lipoprotein induces high levels of apoptosis in the human monocytic THP-1 cell line. results were analyzed using Student's t-test and Student's paired t-test. peripheral blood monocyte-derived human macrophages were incubated for 1 h with LpqH. as a control, cells were incubated with 100 g protein present in 19-kDa nitrocellulose strips of native M. smegmatis (M. smeg-N), which as seen by immunoblot do not contain LpqH. inhibition assays were performed using a specific mAb known by its ability to block TLR2 activation; 0.5 106 cells were preincubated with 20 g antibody for 1 h and then with 5 g LpqH to induce apoptosis. a similar procedure was used to analyze the participation of TLR4. MOs were preincubated with blocking mAb against Fas and FasL. the expression of Fas and FasL was quantitated by a cell surface ELISA method using specific mAb. mAbs to TNF- (P 0.05), TNFR1 (P 0.01), and TNFR2 (P 0.01) decreased apoptosis significantly. the latter observation is interesting because TNFR2 is a receptor devoid of cell-death domains. mos were preincubated with neutralizing mAb to human TNF-, TNFR1 and TNFR2 without rinsing. apoptosis was measured as described in Materials and Methods. in cells treated with LpqH for 1 h, there was a 27.51% decrease in DiOC6 labeling. this indicates disruption of the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential (m), a change often associated with apoptosis. to determine if LpqH induces transfer of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol, we perform immunoblot of cytosolic fractions. 0.05 suggested a role for a caspase-independent mechanism. it is well established that after a variety of apoptotic stimuli, AIF is rapidly released from the mitochondria and relocated to the nuclei. chromatin condensation and cell death is unresponsive to caspase inhibitors. apoptosis was induced with 5 g LpqH for 1 and 24 h. apoptosis was measured by a nucleosome ELISA kit. cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation and immunoblot with a mAb. a transformed M. smegmatis strain that overexpresses the LpqH lipoprotein induces high levels of apoptosis in the human monocytic THP-1 cell line. as a control, cells were incubated with 100 g protein present in 19-kDa nitrocellulose strips of native M. smegmatis which does not contain LpqH as shown by immunoblot. smegmatis (M. smeg-N), which as seen by immunoblot do not contain LpqH, was measured with a nucleosome ELISA kit. apoptosis is expressed as the mean SE arbitrary units (a.u.) of four independent experiments. Statistically significant differences are indicated. inhibition assays were performed using a specific mAb known by its ability to block TLR2 activation. 0.5 106 cells were preincubated with 20 g antibody for 1 h and then with 5 g LpqH to induce apoptosis. MOs were preincubated with 5 g LpqH for 1 h with 5 g LpqH. expression of Fas and FasL was quantitated by a cell surface ELISA procedure. mAbs to TNF- (P 0.05), TNFR1 (P 0.01), and TNFR2 (P 0.01) decreased apoptosis significantly. by cell surface ELISA no differences were found in TNF- membrane expression between LpqH-treated and untreated cells. were preincubated with neutralizing mAb to human TNF-, TNFR1 and TNFR2. without rinsing, 5 g LpqH was added to cells for 1 h. apoptosis was measured as described in Materials and Methods. mitochondrial factors are involved in the caspase-dependent phase of the death cascade triggered by LpqH. we performed immunoblot of cytosolic fractions with an antibody to human cytochrome c after 24 h apoptosis. in cells treated with LpqH for 1 and 24 h, translocation of AIF was seen as magenta fluorescent spots or massive fluorescence. apoptosis was induced with 5 g LpqH for 1 and 24 h. at 1 h apoptosis inhibition was of 49.08% and at 24 h of 19.41%. cells were subjected to subcellular fractionation and immunoblot with a mAb to human AIF labeled with CY5 (red fluorescence); nuclei were labeled with DAPI (blue fluorescence); photographs were taken at the midsection of at least 100 cells per condition. membrane-bound FasL is a considerably more potent inducer of apoptosis than soluble FasL [34]. this property could be relevant in TB since tuberculous granulomas contain numerous macrophages that express surface FasL. this raises the possibility that these FasL armed cells may kill by direct contact Fas-expressing cells within the granuloma. activation of caspase 9 and cytochrome c released from mitochondria into cytosol. activation of caspase 9 and procaspase 9 cleaves and activates procaspase 3. apoptosis feature less frequent than OMM permeabilization but frequently associated with cytochrome c release. mitochondria release factors involved in caspase-independent cell death. a pancaspase inhibitor has been shown to avoid apoptosis in lpqH-challenged cells. in the mitochondria it participates in oxidative phosphorylation, a life function, and when out of the mitochondria it provokes cell death. cell death with the participation of AIF has been reported in infectious processes. in some bacterial infections, AIF triggers the death of infected cells. in some bacterial infections, AIF triggers the death of infected cells."}
