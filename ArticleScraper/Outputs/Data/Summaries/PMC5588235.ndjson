{"summary": "human coronavirus (HCoV)-NL63, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (Boca), human polyomavirus KI (KIV) and human polyomavirus WU (WUV) were not detected in any of the samples. HCoV-NL63 was not detected in any of the samples. human coronavirus (HCoV)-NL63 [4,5], human bocavirus (Boca) [6,7], human polyomavirus KI (KIV) and human polyomavirus WU (WUV) [8,9,10] may be responsible for many respiratory tract illnesses. hMPV can cause severe infections, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia, and it is responsible for 2% of the hospitalization of children suffering from acute RTI. hMPV, HCoV-NL63, Boca, KIV and WUV have been circulating for at least 50 years and has a definite clinical impact. hMPV has been circulating for at least 50 years and has a definite clinical impact. the newly discovered viruses were previously considered pathogenic. the URTI included those of the throat (pharyngitis), nasopharynx (nasopharyngitis), sinuses (sinusitis), larynx (laryngitis) and tracheitis. the majority of samples were collected during autumn and winter. autumn in Kuwait occurs between September and November and winter between December and March. RNA was then eluted in 60 l of the buffer provided in the kit. the presence of viral nucleic acids from hMPV, HCoV-NL63, Boca, KIV and WUV was determined. PCR results were confirmed as previously described using a hybridization technique. the URTI included those of the throat (pharyngitis), nasopharynx (nasopharyngitis), sinuses (sinusitis), larynx (laryngitis) and tracheitis. the majority of samples were collected during autumn and winter. cleic acid was extracted from 140-l respiratory specimens using the QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit. RNA was then eluted in 60 l of the buffer provided in the kit. the presence of viral nucleic acids from hMPV, HCoV-NL63, Boca, KIV and WUV was determined with the primers described before. the most common viral infections were HRV 122 (42.8%), followed by Flu A 47 (16.5%), RSV 42 (14.7%), HCoV-OC43 25 (8.8%), AdV 22 (7.7%) and hMPV 15 (5.3%) the newly discovered viruses were detected in 43 (15.1%) of the patients with viral RTI. viruses in relation to sex, age, hospital admission and type of specimen collected WUV KIV Boca hMPV AdV Flu A RSV PIV-1 PIV-3 HRV HCoV-OC43 HCoV-229E Total Male 6 (2.1) 3 (1.1) 8 (2.8) 8 (2.8) 13 (4.6) 28 (9.8) 25 (8.8) 3 (1.1) 6 (2.1) 69 (24.2) 13 (4.6) 8 (2.8) 190 (66.7)1 Female the number in parentheses represents the number of infections in relation to the total number of patients (n = 285) in %. the number in parentheses represents the number of infections in relation to the total number of patients (n = 285) in %. the majority of the patients admitted to wards had HRV infections (n = 68, 23.9%), followed by patients with flu A infections (n = 35, 12.3%) most of the children were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for HRV (n = 43, 15.1%), followed by RSV (n = 23, 8.1%) and 11 (3.9%) of patients with viral respiratory infection were admitted to the intensive care unit due to HRV. the prevalence of respiratory viral infections was highest during the period from October to February and then declined to the lowest level from July to September. the prevalence of newly discovered viral infections was highest during the months of January, February and October. the other respiratory viral infections were generally present throughout the year, reaching a peak during the winter months from October to February. LRTI (pneumonia, bronchiolitis, bronchopneumonia and respiratory distress) was diagnosed in 88.1% and URTI (pharyngitis and croup) in 28.1% of the hospitalized patients. the prevalence of newly discovered viral infections was highest during the months of January, February and October. the peak season for hMPV (2.5%, n = 7) was in February. in the Philippines, peak positivity for hMPV infections occurred in March. a seasonal distribution of WUV, KIV, hMPV and Boca infections was noted in summer, autumn and winter. in Japan, the peak seasonal activity of WUV and KIV was detected only during the autumn/winter months from October to January."}
