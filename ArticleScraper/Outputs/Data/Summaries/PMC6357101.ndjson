{"summary": "MERS coronavirus (CoV) is an infectious virus that was first reported in June 2012. older age, underlying comorbidity, and delayed confirmation or late diagnosis are all factors that affect MERS disease outcomes and mortality. more males seem to be affected than females. antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, including neutralizing antibodies, have been detected in the sera of dromedary camels. there is a high prevalence of MERS-CoV infection in camel workers, particularly in Saudi Arabia [27] there is a high prevalence of MERS-CoV infection in camel workers, particularly in Saudi Arabia [27] clonal IgG antibody (SAB-301) that is produced by transchromosomic cattle immunized with a MERS-CoV vaccine [54] has been tested in human clinical trials. however, no vaccines or therapeutic agents have been approved for the prevention or treatment of MERS. nsp16 is necessary for interferon resistance and viral pathogenesis. nsp15 is a nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease. activity may be mediated by catalytic residues, oligomeric assembly, or RNA-binding efficiency. the S protein contains an S1 subunit at the N terminus and an S2 subunit at the C terminus. the RBD has a key role in the mediation of binding of MERS-CoV to cells expressing dipeptidyl peptidase 4 receptor, enabling the virus to enter into target cells by fusing with cell membranes. residues are located at the DPP4-binding interface, and have a critical role in RBD\u2013DPP4 binding. other structural studies have revealed four S-trimer conformational states. each RBD is either tightly packed at the membrane-distal apex or rotated into a receptor-accessible conformation. the MERS-CoV S-protein trimers are colored in gray, with three RBDs colored in red, blue, and green. three DPP4 dimers are colored in plum, orange, and yellow. the function and structure of the S-protein RBD demonstrate that it is an important target for development of vaccines. RBD-[SSG]-FR and RBD-FR nanoparticles Bind to DPP4 receptor. antisera block RBD-hDPP4 binding Induce MERS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies (IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgA) in mice Elicits MERS-CoV RBD-specific cellular immune response (IFN-, IL-2, IL-4) in mouse splen induces MERS-CoV S1-specific antibodies (IgG, IgG1, IgG2a) in mice and rabbits. cross-neutralizing 17 pseudotyped (>1:104), 2 live (EMC2012, London1-2012: 1:103) MERS-CoV, and 5 mAb escape mutants. associated hDPP4 receptors and MERS-CoV RBD-specific mAbs (Mersmab1, m336, m337, m338) induces robust and long-term MERS-CoV S1-specific antibodies (IgG, IgG1, IgG2a) in mice, neutralizing at least 9 pseudotyped (>1:104) and live (EMC2012: >1:103) soluble nanoparticle vaccine formed in Escherichia coli by the RNA-mediated folding of a RBD-ferritin (FR) hybrid elicits robust RBD-specific antibody and cellular immune responses in mice. a chimeric, spherical VLP (sVLP) vaccine expressing MERS-CoV RBD induces specific antibody and cellular immune responses in mice. rRBDs with single or multiple mutations corresponding to S-protein sequences of MERS-CoV strains from 2012 to 2015 have also been studied. a trimeric RBD-Fd protein formed by fusing a MERS-CoV RBD fragment (residues 377\u2013588) to the foldon trimerization motif, binds strongly to DPP4 and elicits robust and long-term responses with the production of MERS-CoV S1 the T579N vaccine has significantly greater efficacy than the wild-type RBD vaccine. it fully protects against a lethal MERS-CoV challenge in immunized hDPP4-Tg mice. the antiviral mechanisms, in vivo protection, and crystal structures of previously reported mAbs. live MERS-CoV strains used for neutralization and challenge experiments are indicated in parentheses. mAbs have synergistic effect against pseudotyped MERS-CoV with reduced IC50 by 0.499-fold (for MERS-GD27) or 6.05-fold (for MERS-GD33) JC57-14 mAb Macaque Recognizes RBD residues W535, E536, D539, Y540, and R542 Yes, crystal structure for the Fab\u2013RBD complex IC50: 0.0084 g/mL against pseudotyped MERS-CoV. cross-neutralizing 8 pseudotyped MERS-CoVs N/A protects hDPP4-Tg mice against MERS-CoV (EMC2012: 106 HCAb-83 (200 g) prophylactically protects hDPP4-Tg mice against MERS-CoV. HCAb-83 (200 g) prophylactically protects hDPP4-Tg mice against MERS-CoV (EMC2012: 105 PFU) most of these mAbs can neutralize pseudotyped or live MERS-CoV. some have shown protection against MERS-CoV infection in animal models in vivo. the human mAbs MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33 each recognize distinct regions of the RBD. the mAbs have a synergistic effect in the neutralization of pseudotyped MERS-CoV in vitro. the neutralization and recognition epitopes almost completely overlap this site. a probe-based single-B-cell cloning strategy has been used for the isolation of CDC2-C2 and CDC2-C5 mAbs from a patient convalescing from MERS. all these antibodies have neutralizing activities against both pseudotyped and live MERS-CoV strains. CDC2-C2 prophylactically protects hDPP4-Tg mice from MERS-CoV infection, resulting in no detectable viral replication in the lungs MERS-4 binds the RBD from outside the DPP4-binding interface. unlike MERS-27, MERS-4 binds RBD in the \u201cstanding\u201d position. nanobodies Targeting the MERS-CoV S-protein RBD single-domain antibody fragments (VHHs) are the antigen-recognition regions of camelid heavy-chain-only antibodies (HcAbs), which do not contain light chains. hDPP4-Tg mice (K18) injected with monomeric VHH-83 lose weight. protection against MERS-CoV is complete, with no viral titers or pathological changes in the lungs of virally challenged mice. a single-dose treatment of hDPP4-Tg mice with this agent completely protects them against lethal MERS-CoV challenge. most of these mAbs can neutralize pseudotyped or live MERS-CoV in vitro. some have shown protection against MERS-CoV infection in animal models in vivo. the human mAbs MERS-GD27 and MERS-GD33 each recognize distinct regions of the RBD. the mAb protects hDPP4-Tg mice from MERS-CoV challenge, both preventively and therapeutically. a probe-based single-B-cell cloning strategy has been used for the isolation of CDC2-C2 and CDC2-C5 mAbs from a patient convalescing from MERS. CDC2-C2 is the most potent against 10 pseudotyped MERS-CoV strains, with neutralization IC50 values ranging from 0.002 g/mL to 0.011 g/mL [102] the human mAb MERS-4 neutralizes pseudotyped MERS-CoV. the human mAb MERS-4 also neutralizes pseudotyped MERS-CoV. MERS-4 binds the RBD from outside the DPP4-binding interface, rather than competing with DPP4. camels immunized with modified vaccinia virus expressing MERS-CoV S protein. these VHHs bind MERS-CoV S protein with low Kd values (0.1\u20131 nM), recognize an epitope at residue D539 of RBD, and neutralize MERS-CoV (PRNT50, 0.0014\u20130.012 g/mL) recognizing conformational epitope (residue 539) at the RBD\u2013DPP4 interface, blocking binding of RBD to DPP4. these VHHs, particularly NbMS10-Fc, potently cross-neutralize pseudotyped MERS-CoV strains isolated from different countries, hosts, and time periods. a structurally designed S-protein trimer in the optimal prefusion conformation is shown to elicit production of high titers of anti-MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies. a structurally designed S-protein trimer in the optimal prefusion conformation is shown to elicit production of high titers of anti-MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies."}
