{"summary": "in humans, VEEV causes a febrile illness typified by fever, malaise, and vomiting. mortality rate among cases with neurological symptoms can be as high as 35% in children and 10% in adults, with long-term neurological deficits often being seen in survivors. a number of studies have examined the alterations in the host transcriptome following VEEV infection. a comparative microarray analysis between cells persistently infected with VEEV resulted in the identification of PARP12L as an antiviral factor (8). a second study by the same group identified the regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the brains of VEEV-infected mice. these analyses suggest that VEEV may be utilizing cellular miRNAs in order to regulate downstream mRNA, which may correspond with the VEEV-induced histological changes to the nervous system. VEEV TrD-infected astrocytes have been shown to produce multiple cytokines, including IL-8, IL-17, interferon gamma (IFN-) and gamma interferon-induced protein 10, all of which were found to be associated with viral attenuation. RNA-Seq was used to monitor changes in gene expression in VEEV TrD-infected astrocytes at 4, 8 and 16 h postinfection (h involving select agents is registered with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. for infections, VEEV was added to supplemented Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) to achieve a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05, 0.5, or 5. cells were infected for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and rotated every 15 min. 119 million sequencing reads and an average of 6.6 million reads per sample were used as the input into our analysis pipeline. downstream RNA-Seq analysis was carried out using the CLC bio Genomics Workbench (v7). read trimming was done using the modified Mott algorithm with a Q20 quality score. genes No. of genes No. of viral reads detected % of viral reads detected No. of ERCC92 reads % of ERCC92 reads Mock-infected samples MOCK mRNA 4H R1 5,126,389 3,310,102 15,025 0.0 36,429 0.7 MOCK mRNA 4H R2 5,497,371 3,183,070 15,873 0.0 29,467 0.5 MOCK mRNA 4H R3a RNA 8H R1 5,310,960 2,322,137 15,701 999,715 19,0 20,211 0.4 VEEV mRNA 8H R2 5,549,103 2,679,642 15,806 1,044,308 19,0 25,541 0.5 VEEV mRNA 8H R3ab 8,334,045 4,731,269 18,355 1,738,006 21.3 45,409 0.6 VEEV mRNA 16H R1a a box plot of log2-transformed RPKM values for each sample before normalization is shown in Fig. 2B. the R2 value for pairwise sample-to-sample variation within each biological replicate set was observed to range from 0.89 to 0.99, indicating that our biological replicates were consistent and showed no strong bias. individual genes were provisionally considered differentially expressed when their expression differed by more than 2-fold with a significance with a P value of 0.05. individual genes were provisionally considered differentially expressed when their expression differed by more than 2-fold with a significance with a P value of 0.05. k-means clustering and gene set enrichment analysis were performed using two approaches. purified mRNA was converted to cDNA using a high-capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. analysis was performed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) as previously described (26).

EGR1 has been associated with increases in expression of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) (28), which is a key component of the UPR. this connection represented a potential bridge between the UPR pathway and the interferon response pathway. 15 genes from this analysis were selected for further analysis by qRT-PCR. each cluster (C) has six data points per gene. mock-infected cells at 4, 8, and 16 hpi followed by mock-infected cells at 4, 8, and 16 hpi. a network of type I interferon response- and UPR-related genes was seeded with k-means clusters 18 and 20 and many ribosomal protein genes were removed.

VEEV infection induces UPR late in infection. cells treated with 1 M tunicamycin indicated that 8 h of treatment provided the most robust induction of UPR proteins. VEEV-infected but not mock-infected or UV-inactivated VEEV (UV-VEEV)-infected cells displayed a dramatic increase in p-eIF2 expression and a modest but consistent increase in CHOP and ATF4 expression at 16 hpi. U87MG cells were mock, VEEV, or UV-VEEV infected (MOI, 5) and protein lysates were collected at 4, 8, and 16 hpi. western blot analysis was performed using antibodies against CHOP, ATF4, p-eIF2 and actin. treatment of MEFs with thapsigargin has been shown to induce EGR1 expression in a PERK-dependent manner (44) treatment of VEEV-infected cells resulted in a complete loss of EGR1 induction (Fig. 7C) U87MG cells were mock, VEEV, or UV-VEEV infected (MOI, 5), and protein lysates were collected at 4, 8, and 16 hpi. western blot analysis was performed using antibodies against EGR1, capsid, and actin. two sets of experiments were performed to quantitatively confirm these results. both WT and EGR1/ MEFs displayed dose-dependent decreases in cell viability following VEEV infection. a dose-dependent increase in caspase 3/7 activity was observed following VEEV infection. at 24 hpi caspase 3/7 activity was analyzed using the Caspase 3/7 Glo assay (Promega) the fold change values for mock-infected cells were set to a value of 1. **, P 0.001. log2-transformed fold change values of normalized gene expression were 1.16, 1.18, and 1.50 at 4, 8, and 16 hpi.

EGR1/ and WT MEFs were infected with VEEV (MOI, 0.5 or 5.0) Viral supernatants were collected at 4, 16, and 24 hpi. the average from biological triplicates is shown. many proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-12, glycogen synthase kinase 3, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), have all been shown to play a role in VEEV pathogenesis. the use of high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies, such as RNA-Seq, allows an in-depth and unbiased look expression of HEV capsid protein open reading frame 2 (ORF2) activates expression of CHOP and ATF4 (56) during VEEV infection, initiation of the UPR pathway and subsequent activation of EGR1 play a role in the outcome of virus-induced apoptosis. VEEV appears to induce the UPR and promote increased eIF2 phosphorylation. VEEV infection is expected to induce significant ER stress due to the massive production of viral proteins. the structural proteins of VEEV are translated from the viral subgenomic RNA into polyproteins on the rough ER. it is possible that VEEV has developed mechanisms to subvert the induction of the UPR. literature points toward EGR1 as an important node in the novel link between VEEV activation of the type I interferon response and UPR. previous studies have demonstrated that the nuclear localization of CHOP may act as an inducer of EGR1 and that CHOP may act as a transcriptional cofactor for regulation of target genes. studies are under way to determine if alteration of the UPR through small molecule inhibitors or siRNA interference influences VEEV replication and/or cell death. to date the mechanisms underlying VEEV pathogenesis and subsequent neuronal degeneration have been only partially elucidated."}
