{"summary": "the active site region of SARS CoVMpro is divided into 8 subsites. understanding the binding mode of SARS CoVMpro with a specific substrate is useful. octapeptides with sequences of Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-Ala-Gly-Phe and Thr-Val-Lys-Leu-Gln-Ser-Gly-Phe and Thr-Val-Arg-Leu-Gln-Ser-Gly-Phe are optimal for cleavage by SARS CoVMpro. the octapeptides contained either a long chain positive charge or an aliphatic hydrophobic amino acid. this was proposed to prove that the P3Lys is a significant amino acid for binding in the S3 subsite of the SARS CoVMpro. the results obtained from this research are very important in the understanding of the binding mechanism and catalytic mechanism of the SARS CoVMpro. the structures of the octapeptides were prepared based on the research of Fan et al. [13]. the structure of the SARS CoVMpro was prepared in the catalytically competent conformation. energy minimization was performed by using 1,000 steps of steepest descent method. long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the Particle-Mesh Ewald method. a cutoff distance of 9 was applied for lennard-Jones interactions. the docked conformations were clustered by set the root mean square deviation (RMSD) as 2.0. the first ranked presented the highest members was selected. the conformation that exhibited the lowest docking energy was selected for analysis and further MD simulation. the results of molecular docking and MD simulations were analyzed using Discovery Studio 2.0.1 [16]. all of the calculations were performed on a 48 processor itanium cluster at the National Electronic and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC), Thailand. the structure of the SARS CoVMpro was taken from the Brookhaven protein data bank using the PDB code 1UK4[10]. the structure of the enzyme was set to the GROMOS96 43a1 force field with explicit hydrogen atoms in the aromatic rings. the simulation cell was created in a cubic periodic box with a minimum distance of 0.9 between the protein and the box walls. structure of the octapeptide was defined as 19 rotatable bonds. grid points were set to 80 80 80 with the sulfur atom of SARS CoVMpro Cys145 assigned as the center of the grid box. values of the root mean square deviation (RMSD) and the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) were monitored during the simulations. the atomic distances and number of hydrogen bonds were also investigated to explain the interaction between the SARS CoVMpro and the octapeptide. the structures were shown in dimer form (a) and monomer form (b) the structure was extracted at the equilibrium point of MD simulation. it is known that the S2 subsite is a hydrophobic pocket and is located near the catalytic dyad between domains I and II. the octapeptide P3Ile had the lowest docking energy so it was the most specificity. below these were P3Arg and P3Ile, which had docking energies of -13.26 and -8.11 kcal/mol. the structure of the enzyme-substrate complex (SARS CoVMpro-octapeptide) obtained from molecular docking was then subjected to MD simulation. it is clear that the system of the enzyme in complex with the octapeptide rapidly reached equilibrium. the values reached an equilibrium level at nearly 2000 ps. however, the variation of the total energy in the enzyme free form is caused by movement of the flexible chain, one turn -helix and long loop, in the active site of the SARS CoVMpro complex. P3Arg and P3Ile were still not in the correct confirmation for the active site cleft and moved about 0.3\u20130.35 nm away. however, it is possible to suggest that the movement was only happening on some of the residues of the octapeptide. the RMSF of the enzyme and the octapeptide has also been investigated. at the first time period of MD simulations, these P3 have their side chains pointed out to solvent. after the observed conformational changes these would then point upward to Glu47, and not downward to Glu166. at equilibration of MD simulations, an electrostatic interaction was formed between S3Glu47 and P3Lys or P3Arg. the number of hydrogen bonds seen within the simulation time fluctuates between 4\u20137. however, the enzyme-substrate complex could form 9 hydrogen bonds at P5Thr(N-terminus) and the octapeptide. octapeptide P3Lys, P3Arg and P3Ile were shown in A, B and C. the structure of the enzyme was snapshot and the new confirmation compared to the starting structure. it had a different conformation in the active site caused by movement of the one turn -helix and the long loop chain of the enzyme. this result indicated that the structure of the SARS CoVMpro and in particular, the active site obtained from this research differed from the crystal structure. the docking energy of the three octapeptides was calculated. the conformation with the lowest docking energy from the best cluster was selected. the lower docking energy referred to a higher specificity. octapeptide P3Lys had an energy of -14.23 kcal/mol. the orientation of the docking octapeptides was superimposable over the peptidomimic chloromethyl ketone inhibitor. this inhibitor was specifically bound to the SARS CoVMpro in the crystal structure (PDB ID = 1UK4) the structure of the enzyme-substrate complex obtained from docking studies was acceptable for further MD simulations. system with octapeptide P3Lys, P3Arg and P3Ile were -104521, -104482 and -104216 kcal/mol, respectively. the results showed that the complex of octapeptide P3Lys had the lowest energy, whereas P3Ile had the highest energy. the total energy value was unstable in the first 1500 ps. the lines of the SARS CoVMpro free form complexed with octapeptide P3Lys, P3Arg and P3Ile were colored in black, blue, red and green respectively. it is possible to interpret from the results that the variability in the first 100 ps was due to the structure of the octapeptides adapting. after this time, the octapeptide P3Arg and P3Ile were still not in the correct confirmation the value of the long loop chain is seen to be consistent for all structures. however, the value of the long loop chain is seen to be consistent for all structures. the results also indicated that in the enzyme free form the one turn -helix moved during simulation. the hydrogen bonds, water-bridges and electrostatic interactions between S3Glu47 and P3Lys (Arg) have been observed continuously until the end of MD simulation times. this phenomenon has not been previously reported and this research can propose that the characteristic of S3Glu47, with the negatively charged region it generate, is important for the binding mechanism of SARS CoVMpro. the hypothesis proposed that Glu47 is an important residue in the S3 subsite for binding with P3Lys of the octapeptide. the electrostatic interactions between Glu47 and P3Lys play a key role in specific binding. the full contents of the supplement are available online at http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10\"issue=S1\""}
