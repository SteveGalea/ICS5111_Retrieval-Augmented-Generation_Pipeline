{"summary": "the majority of u.s. hospitals providing emergency care were classified as frontline hospitals. states tasked with receiving, isolating, and providing supportive care for patients under investigation. states subsequently planned that patients would be transferred to an Ebola treatment center capable of safely administering sustained medical care through the entire course of the illness. a 2015 survey of HLIUs found 91% of HLIUs had biosafety level 3 laboratory support in their clinical laboratory and/or public health laboratory. 87% planned to provide some type of laboratory support within the isolated patient's room. the extent of laboratory support available in the hospital laboratory and within the patient's room remained unknown. IU completed the 2015 survey, then the listed point of contact was used. the survey was sent to the same contact as used for the 2015 study. nonrespondents were also solicited for responses, by email, twice after the original deadline had passed. equipment considered \u201cdisposable\u201d included the Piccolo chemistry analyzer (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL), the i-Stat system for blood analysis (Abbott Laboratories), glucometers, the pocH-100i hematology analyzer (Sysmex, Lincolnshire, IL), and the Clinitek urine dipstick reader. on-site laboratories in 27 HLIUs (81%) had the capacity to inventory and to securely bacterial cultureb 30 (94) 0 (0) 8 (27) 19 (63) 2 (7) 1c (3) Biological safety cabinet 31 (97) 0 (0) 17 (55) 14 (45) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) PCR assay 28 (88) 0 (0) 9d (32) 11d (39) 8e (29) 0 (0) 0 (0) a Including the jurisdictional PHL (excluding the CDC laboratory for confirmation diagnosis) HLIUs Test No. (%) available For HLIU Within patient care room Within facility Outside facilitya Other Complete blood count with automated differential 29b (91) 0 (0) 16 (55) 11 (38) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) Magnesium level 21 (66) 0 (0) 14 (67) 7 (33) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 1c (4) Standard calcium level 25 (78) 0 (0) 16 (64) 9 (36) urine culturef 14 (44) 0 (0) 2 (14) 10 (71) 1 (7) 1c (7) Molecular assay 17b (53) 0 (0) 3 (20) 10 (67) 1 (7) 1c (7) Molecular assay 17b (53) 0 (0) 2 (12) 8 (47) 4 (24) 1c (6) Manual differentialg 15 (47) 0 (0) 3 (20) 12 (80) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 3 (23) 10 (77) 0 HLIUs in the united states are prepared to provide a range of laboratory tests for patients with HHCDs. most HLIUs have conducted risk analyses and developed specimen transport procedures. the risk to laboratory workers in handling HHCD specimens should be assessed prior to ordering such tests. 87% of surveyed HLIUs initially planned to provide some type of laboratory support within the patient care room. results from this follow-up study indicate that only 31% of HLIUs now plan to conduct the specified tests or to use the listed tools within the patient care room. all specimens collected from persons suspected or confirmed to have EVD require specialized packaging as category A infectious substances. only personnel trained and certified to package and to transport category A substances are allowed to package and to ship Ebola virus-infected specimens. the cost of transporting samples during the EVD outbreak was exorbitant. tests performed at PHLs ranged from 3 to 36 h. tests performed at PHLs ranged from 3 to 36 h. tests could result in a patient being in isolation longer than needed. health agencies and private organizations during and in the aftermath of the outbreak in 2014 to 2016 (15) these inconsistencies may generate confusion among HLIU laboratorians regarding the tests and instruments that should be provided for HHCD patients. guidelines focused on HHCD treatment facilities are not necessarily adequate for assessment hospitals, as such facilities have been asked to offer their own laboratory testing capabilities. response rate may indicate that others have chosen to no longer maintain high-level isolation capabilities. therefore, results may not be entirely indicative of all CDC-designated HLIUs."}
