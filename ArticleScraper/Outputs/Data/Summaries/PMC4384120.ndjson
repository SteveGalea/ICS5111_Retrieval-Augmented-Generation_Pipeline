{"summary": "chemokines are a family of cytokines that induce chemotaxis of target cells. they were originally discovered for their ability to induce leukocyte migration into the infected or injured sites. chemokines regulate tumor cell differentiation and survival. atic Name Alternate Human Names Tissue/Cells Reference CCL2 Monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) Tumor biopsies, tissues and ascites Negus et al., 1995 [18] Milliken et al., 2002 [19] CCL5 RANTES Tumor biopsies, serum and ascites. underlying mechanisms likely involve the NFB-regulated chemokine expression. increased activity of NFB in ovarian cancer cells is mediated by enzymes of the IB kinase complex. increased activity of NFB in ovarian cancer cells is mediated by enzymes of the IKK complex. the specificity of NFB-regulated responses is mediated by the subunit composition of NFB complexes and their post-translational modifications. hypoacetylation of transcription factors induced by histone acetyl transferases (HATs) generally promotes transcriptional activation, but hypoacetylation induced by HDAC activity is associated with transcriptional repression. hypoxia induces IL-8 [30], CXCL12 [63], and CCL28 [24] expression in ovarian cancer cells. hypoxia induces a direct binding of Hif-1 to the hypoxia-response element. hypoxia induces a direct binding of Hif-1 to the IL-8 promoter. ketone body hydroxybutyrate (OHB) is an endogenous and specific inhibitor of HDACs. administration of exogenous OHB increases histone acetylation, correlating with changes in transcription. chemokine expression by tumor cells modulates cancer development. l in ovarian cancer cells involve increased expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs) and increased p65 NFB binding to IL-8 promoter. the first FDA approved proteasome inhibitor, Bortezomib (BZ) has shown a limited effectiveness in ovarian cancer treatment as a single agent. chemokine expression suppresses angiogenesis and tumorigenicity of ovarian cancer cells. expression of CCL2, CXCL1, CXCL2, and IL-8/CXCL8 is mediated by NFB in ovarian cancer cells. increased activity of NFB in ovarian cancer cells is mediated by enzymes of the IB kinase. hypoxic conditions increase IL-8 expression in ovarian cancer cells by increasing binding to IL-8 promoter. hypoxic conditions increase IL-8 expression in ovarian cancer cells by increasing NFB and AP-1 binding to IL-8 promoter. the high rate of glucose consumption and lactic acid production contributes to the acidification of the tumor environment and cancer progression. the role of lactate and other metabolites of the glycolytic pathway in the regulation of pro-angiogenic chemokine expression in ovarian cancer cells is yet to be investigated. increased chemokine expression by tumor cells modulates cancer development. a major contributor to the acquired chemoresistance of ovarian cancer cells is the increased expression of NFB-dependent chemokines that is induced by the platinum-based drugs carboplatin and cisplatin. anti-inflammatory therapy targeting IKK might increase the BZ effectiveness in ovarian cancer treatment [41]. understanding the molecular mechanisms by which chemotherapeutic interventions increase the chemokine expression in ovarian cancer cells should lead to the development of more effective combination strategies. chemokine promoter sequences have been identified in ovarian cancer cells and tissues.

DAC1 and SMRT have been suggested to suppress the CCL2 expression in hepatic cells and adipocytes. the putative transcription factor binding sites identified in human CXCL1 promoter are listed in Table 3. experimental studies have demonstrated binding of the transcription factors p65 NFB, AP-2, CCAAT displacement protein (CDP) and the stimulating protein-1 (SP-1) to the CXCL1 promoter in human cells. expression levels of IL-8 directly correlate with ovarian cancer progression. suppression of IL-8 expression inhibits tumor cell proliferation, migration and angiogenesis. inflammatory chemokine discovered as neutrophil chemoattractant. the IL-8 transcription is regulated predominantly by p65 homodimers. in most cell types, the IL-8 transcription is regulated by p65 homodimers. proteasome inhibition developed as a strategy to inhibit NFB-dependent transcription. ephrine enhance the IL-8 expression by a FosB-dependent mechanism. the IL-8 expression is negatively regulated by the NFB repressing factor NRF, nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR), the silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor SMRT. the binding site in human IL-8/CXCL8 promoter has the same nucleotide sequence as the NFB site in human IL-8/CXCL8 promoter. both CCL2 and IL-8 are increased by paclitaxel [83] and bortezomib [41], indicating that the paclitaxel and BZ-induced CCL2 (and IL-8) increase is promoter specific. p65 NFB, AP-2, CCAAT displacement protein (CDP) and stimulating protein-1 (SP-1) to the CXCL1 promoter in human cells. the expression is negatively controlled by the transcriptional repressors CDP and the poly(ADPribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) [113,114]. a number of studies have identified a minimal region in human IL-8 promoter that spans nucleotides -1 to -140, is necessary for IL-8 transcription, and contains binding sites for NFB, AP-1, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBP or NF-IL6), Hif-1, and NFB-repressing factor (NRF) proteasome inhibition developed as a strategy to inhibit NFB-dependent transcription, paradoxically increases the IL-8 expression in ovarian cancer cells. a recent study has shown that the stress hormones norepinephrine and epinephrine enhance the IL-8 expression by a FosB-dependent mechanism. the role of these corepressors in the IL-8 regulation has yet to be demonstrated. it will be important to elucidate their function in ovarian cancer setting. many questions remain to be answered."}
