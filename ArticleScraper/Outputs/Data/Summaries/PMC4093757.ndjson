{"summary": "the medical research council (MRC), Wellcome Trust and biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) commissioned a review of all their funded research studies from January 1997 to December 2006. the review panel, led by Professor Sir Patrick Bateson, recommended that \u2018Science policy-makers together with the public sector, private sector and charitable funders of research should commission a working group to develop proposals for a mechanism\u2019. a study comparing types of ultrasound equipment and one funded by the Medical Research Council of Australia were excluded. access to the remaining 284 full texts was gained using Europe PubMed Central (155 studies), Internet search engines (75), Athens (42) and the RSM Library e-journal resource (8). research funding Research funders were identified in study abstracts. cellular research utilised NHP tissue and COS-1, COS-7 and Vero cell lines derived from the African green monkey. 40 of these studies also involved invasive research in rodents, cattle, goats, sheep, poultry or fish. cellular research focused on disease pathogenesis (5 studies), control of infection (2) and vaccine development (3). non-invasive studies concerned HIV infection, HIV vaccines, hepatitis C, animal models of trypanosomiasis, evolution of malaria, obesity and gender-related behaviour (1 each). cellular studies focused on genetic disorders, infectious disease and cancer. is pigmentosa, retinoschisis, schizophrenia, Treacher Collins syndrome, van der Woude syndrome, Williams-Beuren syndrome and Wolfram syndrome. studies of therapeutic relevance Davies et al.3 investigated the effect of trehalose in cell and transgenic mouse models of the late onset autosomal disease oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy. virology pathogenesis research focused on Bunyamwera virus, human cytomegalovirus major, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, enterovirus 71, hepatitis C virus, herpes simplex virus type 1, herpesvirus-6, HIV-1 Group P, measles virus, mumps vaccines, mumps vaccines, mumps virus, retroviral restriction, vaccinia virus. fast and Kaleebu13 reviewed international progress towards developing an effective AIDS vaccine. apoBdpL/R-W had broad activity against herpes viruses and different HIV strains yet minimal cytotoxicity or haemolytic activity. health relevance Biagini et al.17 considered how newfound knowledge of parasite transport physiology could be turned into a strategy for drug delivery in malaria. Kennedy18 argued in favour of the continued use of animal models of human africa trypanosomiasis. Dart et al.22 investigated the relationship of the corepressor protein prohibitin and the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer and concluded that \u2018altering AR activity via increasing levels or activity of corepressors is a valid therapeutic strategy for advanced prostate cancer\u2019. of 55 studies based outside the UK, 27 were in Europe, 18 in the USA, three in China, three in Africa, two in Australia and one each in Thailand and Japan. in 95 studies, researchers acknowledged additional support from grants, fellowships, studentships, gifts of research materials from fellow scientists, and sponsorship from charities. cellular studies focused, inter alia, on protein metabolism (46 studies), gene expression and function (36), endoplasmic reticulum function (6), phosphorylation (6), signal transduction (6), calcium metabolism (5), microtubule metabolism (5), the Golgi apparatus (5), calcium channel function (4), cell membrane function (4), phagocytosis (4), receptor trafficking (3), cell movement (2), cell adhesion (2) and testing a neurosurgical procedure (1) study focused on alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, bardet-Biedl syndrome, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, craniosynostosis, cystic fibrosis, diabetes Type 2, familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB), frontotemporal dementia with Parkinsonism. the endosomal protein Rab5 enhanced polyglutamine toxicity in cell and fly models of HD. overexpression attenuated toxicity: 'a possible therapeutic approach for HD and other proteinopathies would thus be to enhance Rab5 activity' onia syndrome, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, Parkinson\u2019s disease, popliteal pterygium syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa, retinoschisis, schizophrenia, Treacher Collins syndrome, van der Woude syndrome, Williams-Beuren syndrome and Wolfram syndrome. studies of therapeutic relevance Davies et al.3 investigated the effect of trehalose in cell and transgenic mouse models of the late onset autosomal disease underwood et al.8 found that in fly and zebrafish models of HD, antioxidants \u2018exacerbate the disease phenotype and abrogate the rescue seen with autophagy-inducing agents\u2019. the potential benefits in neurodegenerative diseases of some classes of antioxidants may be compromised by their autophagy-blocking properties. apoBdpL/R-W had broad activity against herpes viruses and different HIV strains yet minimal cytotoxicity or haemolytic activity, supports its use as a lead for the development of microbiocides or HIV therapeutics' apoBdpL/R-W had broad activity against herpes viruses and different HIV strains yet minimal cytotoxicity or haemolytic activity. fast and Kaleebu13 reviewed international progress towards developing an effective AIDS vaccine. Salisbury et al.16 found that Salmonella Virchow infection of chickens can occur without overt clinical signs. Pathogenesis research This focused on burkholderia pseudomallei, Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, Salmonella Dublin, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and rickettsial phylogeny. 'we still hope that a magic bullet akin to the Taenia onchosphere antigens will be found by serendipity,' they concluded. the laudable goal will require a 'long march' human P. falciparum is of gorilla origin and not of chimpanzee, bonobo or ancient human origin. pathogenesis research focused on cancers of the breast, prostate and ovary; leukaemia; neuroblastoma; tumour suppression; hypoxia regulatory factors. Dart et al.22 investigated the relationship of the corepressor protein prohibitin and the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer. concluded that \u2018altering AR activity via increasing levels or activity of corepressors is a valid therapeutic strategy for advanced prostate cancer\u2019. change means that basic medical and biological research now share common ground in respect of cellular research methods and materials. reduction in invasive NHP studies should reduce harm to animals and will lead to a reduction in the level of opposition to NHP research and aggression towards researchers. the low level of translation may have been due, at least in part, to legitimate negative research findings. implementation of the Bateson Review\u2019s Recommendation 4 would meet this need. future outlook The shift in research emphasis brings medical and biological science into a complementary relationship. proportion of research of medical relevance At 35%, the proportion of medical studies was low compared to biological studies (61%). this is broadly in line with the findings of the Cooksey Review of 2006, which cited the UK Clinical Research Collaboration analysis. invasive whole animal to cellular research brings medical and biological science into a complementary relationship. it will hopefully lead to better understanding of disease aetiology, and improved diagnosis, prevention and treatment, particularly of chronic disease. need for coordination of biological and medical research may increase."}
