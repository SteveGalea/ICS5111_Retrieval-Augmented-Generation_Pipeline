{"summary": "virtually all DNA virus classes including herpesviruses, adenoviruses, hepatitis B virus, parvoviruses and polyomaviruses must deposit their genomes within the nucleus for transcription, genome replication and subsequent capsid assembly. all these viruses must navigate through the cytoplasm of infected cells, escape or counteract physical host cell barriers and antiviral processes. many studies on aspects of virus infection have almost invariably relied on indirect, surrogate measures of detection of virus genomes. e.g., on the effect of inhibitors on DNA entry or analysis of DNA sensing have invariably relied on indirect, surrogate measures of detection. these techniques have been exploited by the Greber laboratory for analysis of adenovirus (Adv) infection [16] using viruses incorporating the alkyne-derivatised nucleosides EdC (ethynyl-deoxycytidine) or EdU (ethynyl-deoxyuridine) in their genomes for the spatiotemporal investigation of genome trafficking at the single particle level. we also recently showed that incubation with EdC had ethynyl-nucleoside incorporation in uninfected and HSV infected cells analysed by ethynyl-nucleoside incorporation. results show no significant effect of EdC even over relatively prolonged times (72 hrs) on uninfected cell growth or morphology. results show a modest increase for HSVEdC (Fig 1D) concentrations at least 10 M were well tolerated, with minimal effect of virus replication and the progression of infection. a) cell monolayers infected with 50 pfu of HSV-1[17] and incubated in the presence of EdC at various concentrations. homogeneous diffuse patterns (S2ii and S2iii Fig) are consistent with previous spatial analysis of cellular DNA synthesis. the percentage of positive cells increased to approximately 55% by 5 hpi (hours post infection) virtually all cells were positive for EdC incorporation by 8 hpi (hours post infection) ICP8 formed in smaller (Fig 3, iv) or larger (Fig 3, v,vii) lobules. localisation of ICP8 likely represents some level of ongoing viral DNA synthesis in such S-phase cells, in background of prominent cellular DNA synthesis. samples of HSVEdC or unlabelled HSV-1[17] were adsorbed onto borosilicate coverslips, fixed and processed for the simultaneous detection of genomes and capsids. the individual channels for genome detection are shown in corresponding panels II and V for each virus. the control HSV-1[17] had no detectable genomes above background. the percentage of HSVEdC particles with detectable genomes was comparable if not slightly greater than that for similarly labelled Adv. we used the coefficient of variation (CV, (/) x 100) as a measure of variance. the goodness of fit to a normal distribution of VP5 intensities exceeded 0.95. this variance in particle intensity is very similar to analogous types of HSV single particle analysis using either GFP-fusion proteins or antibody to capsid protein. adsorption of virions at room temperature resulted in numerous elongated filamentous stands ejected from virions. adsorption of virions at room temperature resulted in numerous elongated filamentous stands ejected from virions. this was accompanied by an increase in the numbers of punctate genome foci that were not detected by immunofluorescence. at 4\u00b0C for both HSVEdC and HSV, numerous virus particles could be detected on cells (VP5, panels I) there was no significant genome signal for HSVEdC particles adsorbed onto cells. this is consistent with the lack of genome detection in physiological buffer. cells were infected with (a) HSV-1EdC or (b) HSV-1[17] at moi 10 at 4\u00b0C and incubated for 45 min. cells were fixed immediately (4\u00b0C), or the temperature was raised to 37\u00b0C for 2 hr (4\u00b0C 37\u00b0C) HSVEdC nuclear genomic foci were comparatively homogeneous in size and shape and generally spherical. with increasing moi there was an increasing trend of genome foci in the nucleus. this was not directly proportionate, with for example an average of 4\u20135 foci at moi 10, 6 at moi 20 and 10 at moi 50. box limits represent 2nd and 3rd quartiles with the horizontal bar in the middle showing the median and whiskers showing up the 5\u201395% range of the total population. Exceptional outliers (less than 5% of population) are shown as individual dots. 3D-SIM data of a cell infected with HSV-1EdC (moi 20) and examined at 0.5 hpi. raw data was visualised by iso-rendering in Huygens analysis software. we examined genome presentation in the nucleus at early times of infection (0.5 hpi) cells were imaged by 3D-SIM and the data processed using the Object analyser module of Huygens image processing software. after 3D segmentation, geometrical and spatial localisation data can be calculated for individual objects. by 2 hpi, the mean volume of the foci had increased further (by another 2\u20134 fold), but there was also a marked increase in irregularity as the foci became more decondensed and dissipated. as infection progressed beyond 2 hrs, the genome signal became more difficult to quantitate evolving into diffuse, dissipated aggregates of lower intensity. within 30 min after shift to 37\u00b0C, new discrete nuclear foci (green channel) were readily observed exhibited quite precise co-localisation with the genome foci at 1 hr, by 3 hrs ICP4 was observed more within the dispersed areas of genome labelling. this distinction of ICP4 localisation on earlier condensed (1 hr, panel VIII) versus later more decondensed foci (3 hrs, panel XII) is shown in expanded form. infected cells were infected (moi 10) either untreated or in the presence of a series of inhibitors each added 1 hr prior to infection. the effects of inhibition of transcription, translation and virus DNA replication on transitions in genome decompaction. in absence of drug treatment, genome foci were observed in the nucleus by 0.5 hpi together with the temporal increase in volume, irregular morphology (1, 2 hpi), progressive decondensation and dissipation (3 hpi) two significant conclusions could be made from inhibition of transcription. inhibition of transcription did have a significant effect on the progressive increase in genome volume and eventual decompaction, which were almost completely inhibited. we repeated this analysis for Act D including relatively late times (8 hpi) the temporal trend to increasing dissipation continued so that by 8 hpi, the diffuse dispersed signal from incoming genomes was extremely low. in contrast, in the presence of Act D, genomes maintained in more condensed foci. the tendency towards clustering is highly significant for the CHX treated cells. abundant accumulated data has shown that in the presence of CHX transcription occurs but is limited to IE loci with little or no DE transcription nor DNA replication. panel a illustrates theoretical nuclei with random, clustered or dispersed patterns. algorithm compares cumulative inter-point distance frequencies (CDFs) with actual cumulative distribution obtained for foci in each example pattern (panel b, red lines in each graph) SDIs were calculated for the foci in each nucleus and compiled into a distribution of SDIs across the cells for each condition. the results indicate a clear difference in the population distribution of inter-foci distances in Act D versus CHX treated cells. the results indicated a distinct statistical significance for clustering of genomes in the presence of CHX versus Act D. the spatial distribution of genomes in Act D treated cells could not be attributed any distinct pattern. the results strongly support the conclusions for a distinct difference between Act D and CHX treated cells and the proposal that transcription is recognised in the host cell. a drug which depolymerises microtubules has been shown to inhibit HSV infection and capsid transport [38\u201340]. control experiments for the activities of MG132 and Leptomycin B using known targets and effects confirmed their action. neither proteasome function nor nuclear export are required for the initial stages of HSV nuclear transport, uncoating and import. ethynyl-deoxycytidine was more sensitive for detection of HSV replication centres than EdU (ethynyl-deoxyuridine), consistent with the high GC content of HSV DNA [24]. the results show a modest increase for HSVEdC (Fig 1D) prolonged incubation with EdC at concentrations at least 10 M was well tolerated. overall even prolonged incubation with EdC at concentrations up to 10 M was well tolerated. \u201330% of cells with spatial localisation patterns observed at higher magnification (S2 Fig) varying from discrete small clusters to more intense incorporation in prominent large focal clusters (S2ii and S2iii Fig) these patterns are consistent with previous spatial analysis of cellular DNA synthesis and reflect approximate stage within S-phase [20, 22]. multiple intense focal clusters of nascent DNA synthesis were observed, but in this case without any clear colocalisation with ICP8. the localisation of ICP8 likely represents some level of ongoing viral DNA synthesis in such S-phase cells. samples of HSVEdC or unlabelled HSV-1[17] were adsorbed onto borosilicate coverslips, fixed and processed for the simultaneous detection of genomes (green channel) and capsids (using anti-VP5 antibody, red channel) the individual channels for genome detection are shown in corresponding panels II and V. control HSV-1[17] had essentially no detectable genomes above background. the percentage of HSVEdC particles with detectable genomes was comparable if not slightly greater than that for similarly labelled Adv. genome signal detected by cycloaddition exceeded 0.95 with a CV of 23.75. variance in particle intensity is very similar to analogous types of HSV single particle analysis using either GFP-fusion proteins or antibody to capsid protein. newcomb and colleagues observed that DNA was realised as elongated strands with increasing ejection at elevated temperatures. we detected genomes within virions as punctate foci, but did not observe elongated genome release. to examine detection and possible ejection of HSVEdC genomes further, we analysed virions that had been adsorbed onto coverslips and then subject to elevated heat treatment. orbed onto cells at 4\u00b0C for 45 min and then either washed and processed directly or shifted to 37\u00b0C to allow fusion and virus entry. at 4\u00b0C for both HSVEdC and HSV, numerous virus particles could be detected on cells (VP5, panels I) there was no significant genome signal for HSVEdC particles adsorbed onto cells. cells were infected with (a) HSV-1EdC or (b) HSV-1[17] at moi 10 at 4\u00b0C. cells were fixed immediately (4\u00b0C), or the temperature was raised to 37\u00b0C for 2 hr (4\u00b0C 37\u00b0C) HSVEdC nuclear genomic foci were comparatively homogeneous in size and shape and generally spherical. at this early stage, HSVEdC nuclear genomic foci were comparatively homogeneous in size and shape. with increasing moi there was an increasing trend of genome foci in the nucleus. box limits represent 2nd and 3rd quartiles with the horizontal bar in the middle showing the median and whiskers showing up the 5\u201395% range of the total population. Exceptional outliers (less than 5% of population) are shown as individual dots. the mean value is indicated by a \u2018+\u2019. 3D-SIM data of HSVEdC virions adsorbed to glass coverslips. raw data was reconstructed and individual representative particles are shown as Z-projections. raw data was visualised by iso-rendering in Huygens analysis software. unpaired two-tailed t-tests were used for statistical results. compared virions on coverslips versus infected cell nuclear genomic foci at 0.5 hpi. by 2 hpi, the mean volume of the foci had increased further (by another 2\u20134 fold), but there was also a marked increase in irregularity as the foci became more decondensed and dissipated. as infection progressed beyond 2 hrs, the genome signal became more difficult to quantitate evolving into diffuse, dissipated aggregates of lower intensity. within 30 min after shift to 37\u00b0C, new discrete nuclear foci (green channel) were readily observed ICP4 localised on earlier condensed (1 hr, panel VIII) versus later more decondensed foci (3 hrs, panel XII) by 3 hrs ICP4 was observed more within the dispersed areas of genome labelling, lacking any distinct enrichment in the remaining punctate foci. a cell nucleus infected with HSV-1EdC fixed at 2 hpi showing residual EdC labelled infecting genomes remaining as tighter foci on the periphery of replication compartments. a series of inhibitors each added 1 hr prior to infection; actinomycin D (Act D, 5 g/ml), acyclovir (ACV, 500 M), phosphonoacetic acid (PAA, 400 g/ml genome foci were observed in the nucleus by 0.5 hpi together with the temporal increase in volume, irregular morphology (1, 2 hpi), progressive decondensation and dissipation (3 hpi) in the absence of drug treatment, genome foci were observed by 0.5 hpi together with the temporal increase in volume, irregular morphology (1, 2 hpi), progressive decondensation and dissipation. in the presence of ACV or PAA, events linked to or downstream of transcription per se are reflected in increasing volume and irregularity and decreased compaction of the uncoated genomic foci. we repeated this analysis for Act D including relatively late times (8 hpi), comparing the fate of infecting virus genomes during normal progression of infection or when transcription was inhibited. independent estimation of clustering by calculation of the K-function at increasing length of test radii. data shown are the mean +/- sem of the K function for radii between 0.11m and 6 m. tendency towards clustering is highly significant for the CHX treated cells. algorithm compares cumulative inter-point distance frequencies (CDFs) with actual cumulative distribution obtained for foci in each example pattern. a truly random pattern will show approximately even distributions of SDI values between 0 and 1. clustered SDI distributions will show a distinct leftward shift towards lower values. SDIs were calculated for the foci in each nucleus and compiled into a distribution of SDIs across the cells for each condition. the results indicate a clear difference in the population distribution of inter-foci distances in Act D versus CHX treated cells. results indicated a distinct statistical significance for clustering of genomes in CHX treated cells with search radii from 1\u20134 m and a tailing off as the radii became too large to attribute significance. the spatial distribution of genomes in Act D treated cells could not be attributed any distinct pattern. ptomycin B (as used in the previous studies) showed no significant effect on HSVEdC genome uncoating and import. the drug depolymerises microtubules and has been previously shown to inhibit HSV infection. -tests were used for statistical results (ns = not statistically significant, *** = p0.0001) in this experiment infection even in the untreated sample was somewhat less efficient than standard, but there was no difference with either MG132 or Leptomycin B at 30 min. in contrast, no diference for MG132 at 1 hr resulted in a substantial and significant reduction in accumulation of uncoated nuclear genomes. the inner part of the circle indicates only genomes. the outer part indicates the association of genomes with the regulatory protein ICP4 (indicated in red) the bottom sections indicate features delineated in the presence of inhibitors. a portal-specific alteration is possible but not necessary to explain our observations. a more global perturbation around the capsid shell could allow access to the components of the cycloaddition reaction, the largest being the azide-fluorochrome (mol wt 861) there could be distinct perturbations with one type allowing access to small compounds. s could not be detected in the nucleus at 30 min. quantitative analysis on nuclear entry was performed at 2.5 hrs. this does not necessarily indicate that HSV genome import is more rapid than adenovirus. proteasome inhibition could have inhibited a number of processes involved in surrogate read-out later in infection or inhibited bulk capsid dynamics that were not important for early genome delivery. the distribution of the numbers of genomes appearing in the nucleus and the relationship to moi bear similarity to those from physical analysis of adenovirus genome entry [16] similar conclusions were made for Adv nuclear entry [16]. we currently cannot discriminate fate of capsids which do not uncoat at the nuclear pore. for Adv genomes appear to be lost from the capsid. genome congregation could directly contribute to congregation, even if not all genomes were transcribing. it could be that genome congregation is a host response to infection. genomes underwent further progressive decondensation, eventually becoming difficult to discriminate and dissipating within DNA replication compartments. the pattern of genome association with ICP4 warrants discussion. genomes that remained as condensed foci were selectively depleted for ICP4 and frequently devoid of the protein altogether. however as infection progressed there was a clear distinction in this association. genomes released from the capsid are randomly digested and not assembled into any conventional nucleosomal organisation. one model attempting to integrate results from different approaches proposes that infecting genomes associate with some form of nucleoprotein complex that includes histones but in a non-conventional highly distributive, rapidly associating/dissociating organisation. genome condensation state linked to transcription and replication; reveal novel processes in genome congregation dependent upon transcription and replication; show temporal switching in regulatory protein recruitment (represented by ICP4) to distinct genome compartments. results demonstrate the efficient incorporation of EdC into virus replication compartments, colocalisation with the major virus DNA binding protein, ICP8 and features of virus DNA replication in relation to the cell cycle. a more global perturbation around the capsid shell could allow access to the components of the cycloaddition reaction, the largest being the azide-fluorochrome (mol wt 861) there could be distinct perturbations with one type allowing access to small compounds and another involving changes including at the portal, promoting genome release. quantitative analysis on nuclear entry was performed at 2.5 hrs. this does not necessarily indicate that HSV genome import is faster than adenovirus. this would require a direct parallel comparison with similarly labelled viruses in the same cells and on identical imaging systems. this is in contrast to a previous publication which indicated proteasome function was required post-entry for efficient delivery of incoming HSV capsids to the nucleus and subsequent gene expression. previous conclusions were based on measurements of gene expression (-galactosidase) at 6 hpi or on measure of capsid localisation of a fluorescent virus at 2.5 hpi. Adv genomes appear to be lost from the capsids. we currently cannot discriminate the fate of capsids which do not uncoat at the nuclear pore. we are currently developing bioorthogonal approaches with distinct chemical moieties on DNA versus RNA. genome congregation could directly contribute to congregation, even if not all genomes were transcribing. it could be that genome congregation is a host response to infection. genomes underwent further progressive decondensation, eventually becoming difficult to discriminate and dissipating within DNA replication compartments. acting on HSVEdC would result in one labelled parental strand remaining at the replication fork. the other parental strand would move away as replication and unlabelled progeny DNA accumulates. it is not currently technically possible to discriminate between these possibilities and other explanations are also possible. a model attempting to integrate results from different approaches proposes that infecting genomes associate with some form of nucleoprotein complex that includes histones but in a non-conventional highly distributive, rapidly associating/dissociating organisation. we show that after capsid exit and nuclear import, genomes expand but in a constrained and distinct state and then further decondenses in a discernible fashion prior to replication. the results reveal novel aspects of the spatiotemporal dynamics of HSV genome uncoating, transport and organisation. they provide a framework for future investigation in distinct fields of host cell-virus genome. acycloguanosine (ACV), 500 M; phosphonoacetic acid (PAA, 400 g/ml) inocula were neutralised at 1 hpi with a 40 mM citric acid wash. inocula were neutralised at 1 hpi with a 40 mM citric acid wash. cells were then incubated in presence of various concentrations of EdC. the cells were grown in roller bottles (850 cm2 surface area) to 80% confluency. the cells were infected with HSV-1[17] at a moi of 0.025 in 25 ml medium without serum. dC was added to a final concentration of 5 M at 6 hpi and again at 24 hpi. the \u2018Mock EdC\u2019 inoculum used for control experiments was prepared by pulsing uninfected RPE-1 cells for 48 hr with 5 M EdC, harvesting the supernatant and concentrating exactly as if preparing virus from infected cells. similar results were obtained in comparing HSV and HSVEdC particle/pfu ratios. images were acquired with Zeiss x63 lens using Zeiss x63 lens. images were mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant. maximum projections were captured using the Image Pro Plus Stage-Pro function. the plugin places an identical sized ROI centred on the maxima. Maxima with too close a spatial overlap or at an image edge are excluded by the protocol. infected cells were co-stained with DAPI to allow outlining of nuclei. image stacks (2 m) were acquired in Frame Fast mode (single multiband cube) for analysis of infected cells, image stacks (2 m) were acquired with a z-step of 110 nm and 15 raw images (five phases) raw data was then computationally reconstructed using the ZEN software. a super-resolution 3D image stack was obtained with a pixel size of 32 nm in xy and 105 nm in z. images from different colour channels were registered in ZEN. volume analysis was performed the object analyser module of the Huygens image processing suite. the image is segmented into defined objects by the seed-threshold level adjustment, and connection process. point patterns tend to cluster have an SDI closer to 0. patterns tending to even spacing have an SDI close to 1. a p-value for the difference between the two populations is calculated. viruses and infections were performed in the presence of pooled neutralising human serum (Sigma-Aldrich) at 2% or clinical grade purified human immunoglobulin (IVIg, Carimune NF, Nanofiltered, human immune globulin, CSL Behring) at 2 mg/ml. RPE-1 cells were pulsed with increasing concentrations of EdC (Sigma-Aldrich, #T511307) for 48 hr. viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion using an automated cell counter. inocula were neutralised at 1 hpi with a 40 mM citric acid wash. Virus was harvested at approximately 48 hpi, separating cell associated and supernatant virus by low speed centrifugation (3000 rpm, 4\u00b0C for 15 min) supernatant virus was transferred into oakridge tubes and pelleted in a sorvall centrifuge RC5B using a SS34 rotor at 19,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 90 min. cycloaddition of labelled fluorochromes and immunofluorescence Cells grown on borosilicate coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min, quenched in 100 mM glycine in PBS for 5 min, and permeabilised with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. samples were then processed by cyclo antibodies were used: mouse anti-VP5 (Virusys, HA018; 1:300); mouse anti-ICP8 11E2 (Abcam, #20194; 1:100); mouse anti--tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, #T6074; 1:1000); rabbit anti-PML [73] (1:300); mouse anti-cyclin B1 (Ab18221; 1:500); Alexa-594 Goat anti-mouse IgG (Ther sized ROI centred on the maxima with user configurable diameter to encompass virus particles. maxima with too close a spatial overlap or at an image edge are excluded by the protocol. infected cells were co-stained with DAPI to allow outlining of nuclei. images were acquired by standard wide-field microscopy or 3D-structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) images were then processed using image J denoise plugin and corrected for background. lateral (x-y) resolution (approximately 120 nm) and axial (z) resolution (approximately 300 nm) images from different colour channels were registered in ZEN with alignment parameters obtained from calibration measurements with either virus capsids simultaneously labelled in both red and green channels or with TetraSpeck calibration beads 0.1 m diameter. detected objects are automatically labelled and submitted to a continuous renderer. the segmented image is shown as a coloured iso-surface image. a simulated fluorescence process (SFP) computing algorithm allows visualization of the 3D data and production of the rendered image as an animation. a p-value for the difference between the two populations is calculated. a p-value for the difference between the two populations is calculated. the D statistic is the largest deviation between the two CDFs. viable cells were quantified by trypan blue exclusion at the end of the incubation period. incorporated EdC was detected by cycloaddition using Alexa 488-azide capture reagent. the same analysis used for overall frequency distributions of VP5 and DNA of the total particles was used to generate scatter plots where each dot represents an individual particle and its score for VP5 (Y-axis) and EdC (x-axis) threshold for scoring positive is indicated by the solid lines in red or green. ddition and immunofluorescence experiments on entry and uncoating of HSV-1EdC genomes. RPE-1 cells were infected with HSV-1EdC and fixed at 2 hpi. experimental variations from the normal process were as follows. uninfected cells were treated with MG132 (10 M), nocodazole (2 M), or Leptomycin B (20 nM) for 1.5 hr, as during analysis of infection, then fixed and processed for immunofluorescence of ICP4. panels I and IV show MG132 treatment increases PML number and size per nuclei; panels III and VI show inhibition of nuclear export and nuclear accumulation of cyclin B1. a theoretical CDF for a truly random distribution is generated. for an actual random pattern the red line will be close to the black. for clustered and evenly spaced the red line will deviate left or right respectively. for clustered and evenly spaced the red line will deviate left or right respectively."}
