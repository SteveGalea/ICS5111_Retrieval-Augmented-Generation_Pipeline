{"summary": "virome studies have shown unprecedented numbers of viruses present in the fecal samples of this ancient mammalian species. little is known about the genetic architecture of most bat species, the virus variation and gene flow that occur through different species, the potential of different bat species to support human virus replication, or the potential of bat viruses to undergo zoonotic transmission to humans. HCoV-NL63 was first discovered in 2004 as a new HCoV isolated from a 7-month-old baby suffering from bronchiolitis (48). a similar virus was isolated around the same time in samples derived from an 8-month-old baby with pneumonia (16). since 2004, this HCoV has been detected in 1.0 to 9.3% of respiratory tract samples collected from several different countries. the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), the red bat (Lasiurus borealis) and the tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus) five of these species shed unique -CoV sequences (11); however, the reagents necessary to isolate these viruses are currently lacking. this observation suggests that human CoVs grow in these bat cells. -CoV sequences present in fecal samples of eastern bat species (11). previously reported primers and protocols (11) to amplify a >2,200-nucleotide fragment in the replicase region of these viruses. sequences were aligned using ClustalX as implemented in Geneious 5.4.3. tree was generated using 100 bootstraps, and the tree image was exported using the bioinformatics tools available in the Geneious software suite version 5.4.3 (13). this was the largest fragment available for all three genomes, and that was the basis for generating the tree using these sequences. a normal probabilistic prior with a mean of 121 years before the present time was used to calibrate the analysis. an exponential population size assumption was tested using the SRD06 model. the model was superior to the GTR model by a log10 Bayes factor of 240. only nonrabid bats that were badly injured beyond recovery were euthanized. the organs were removed from transport buffer, washed with cold processing media, placed in specimen tubes with fresh processing media. the dissected tissues were then transferred to a 50-ml conical tube, covered with cold 0.25% trypsin (Gibco), and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. the following day, the samples were centrifuged at 37\u00b0C on a benchtop shaker set at 200 rpm for 1 h. the cells were fed by removing the medium and replacing it with fresh primary medium with 15% FCS every 3 to 5 days until the cells reached confluence. the primary cells were then maintained for 2 to 5 passages to generate cell stocks that were cryopreserved and stored at 140\u00b0C. the cells were infected with 1 ml of wild-type HCoV-NL63 or HCoV-NL63 expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) on the following day, the cells were transfected a second time using the same protocol. for the adsorption period, the cells were incubated at 32\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 1 h with agitation every 15 min. at the end of the adsorption period, an additional 2 ml of culture medium was added to each well. the infected cells were maintained at 32\u00b0C with 5% CO2 and monitored for 5 days. resulting bands were excised, purified, and subjected to Sanger sequencing at the UNC Genomic Analysis Center. the resulting bands were also excised, purified, and subjected to Sanger sequencing at the UNC Genomic Analysis Center to verify the origins and sequence of the leader-containing cDNAs. PESU-B5L cells were infected with HCoV-NL63 at a multiplicity of 0.7 or mock infected. cells were washed with cold PBS followed by lysis in AV lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholine, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. nal antibody to beta actin (catalog no. 612656; BD Transduction Technologies) was used, followed by staining with secondary antimouse HRP antibody (GE Amersham Biosciences) the sequences determined in this study were deposited into GenBank under accession numbers JX537911 through JX537914. sequences of ARCoV.1, ARCoV.2 and NECoV were deposited into GenBank. sequences were aligned using ClustalX as implemented in Geneious 5.4.3. alignment was manually trimmed and corrected to generate a 2,321-nucleotide alignment. a maximum likelihood tree was generated using PhyML with 100 bootstraps. most of the sequences were dated in years before present, which was 2011 when this study was conducted. a normal probabilistic prior with a mean of 121 years before the present time was used to calibrate the analysis. both the GTR+Gamma 4 + I and the SRD06 models were tested. organs harvested from each bat included heart, lung, intestine, brain, kidney, liver, and stomach. organs in medium were delivered on ice within 8 h to our lab. all of the organs harvested at the bat rescue were transported to our lab. the cells were fed by removing the medium and replacing it with fresh primary medium with 15% FCS every 3 to 5 days until the cells reached confluence. the cells were then infected with lentivirus vectors expressing the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene. hTERT\u2013Bmi-1\u2013Polybrene mixture was created by placing 1.5 ml of each vector into a 15-ml conical tube at vector concentrations of >106 infectious units/ml. the mixture was vortexed gently and stored on ice. for the cells to be immortalized, we added 1 ml of medium before incubation. immortalized bat lung cells from the tricolored bat were seeded onto a 6-well plate and grown in primary cell culture medium at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. the cells were infected with 1 ml of wild-type HCoV-NL63 (wtNL63) or HCoV-NL63 expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (NL63gfp) (12) or PBS (mock) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of for HCoV-NL63, we used primers designed to amplify the subgenomic leader containing mRNA transcripts of each virus. the amplified leader-containing cDNAs are specific to each HCoV. the band was excised, purified, and subjected to Sanger sequencing. rabbit anti-NL63 nucleocapsid sera (the kind gift of Lia van der Hoek) were used as primary antibody. unbound primary antibody was removed by washing three times with 1% BSA\u20130.05% Nonidet P-40 in PBS. infected cells were photographed using an inverted microscope. proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using an Xcell blot module (Invitrogen) the proteins were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T buffer (0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline) for 1 h. new tab Phylogeny of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene from several mammalian species. the scale bar represents nucleotide substitutions. only nodes with bootstrap support above 70% are labeled. a novel -CoV in the tricolored bat is closely related to HCoV-NL63. a maximum likelihood tree comparing the nucleotide sequences of these bat CoVs to other known CoVs indicated that NECoV and ARCoV.1 are very closely related. NECOV and ARCoV.1 were identical in this region, so only ARCoV.1 is shown. molecular clock analysis was conducted to estimate an MRCA between ARCoV.2 and HCoV-NL63. this analysis was performed using sequence fragments obtained from the highly conserved viral polymerase (nsp12) HCoV-NL63 and ARCoV-NL63 originated from the same ancestor. only ARCoV.1 was used in this analysis, and this sequence clustered with other -CoVs of bats. a female tricolored bat arrived in the rescue in mid-juy of 2011 suffering injuries sustained from being hit by a car. intestine, stomach, and kidney tissues were obtained from this bat. primary cells were successfully generated for the brain, lung, and heart. the tricolored bat lung cells grew most efficiently. at the time of writing, we have PESU-B5L cells that have undergone over 30 passages and over 100 doublings. there were no observable morphological changes in these cells over passage. however, the immortalization process appears to have selected for a single fibroblast-resembling cell population. RT-PCR and sequencing were used to determine that the murine Bmi-1 gene was expressed in the immortalized cells. PESU-B5L cells were infected with NL63gfp at an MOI of 0.25. they were monitored by bright-field and fluorescence microscopy. no GFP expression was detected in PESU-B5L cells over 5 days of infection. western blotting of cells expressing HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid appeared bright green under fluorescent conditions. uninfected cells strongly expressed a protein of approximately 45 kDa. total RNA was harvested from cells on day 5 postinfection. mock-infected cells, fluorescence microscopy; III, HCoV-NL63-infected cells, fluorescence microscopy; IV, HCoV-NL63-infected cells, bright-field microscopy. western blot of HCoV-NL63 and mock-infected PESU-B5L cell lysates with -actin as a loading control. all three of these viruses replicated subgenomic RNAs in the PESU-B5L lung cells. subgenomic transcripts were detected at both time points for all three strains. the band representing the M gene was excised and sequenced by Sanger sequencing for all three of these strains. sg transcripts for X1, envelope (E), membrane (M) and open reading frame 6 were detected at both time points for all three strains. sg M bands for all three strains were excised, and the DNA was purified and sequenced to verify that the SARS-CoV leader sequence and the 5\u2032 end of the M gene were present. the mitochondrial cytochrome b genes of several bat and other mammalian species were compared. the scale bar represents nucleotide substitutions. only nodes with bootstrap support above 70% are labeled. RT-PCR used to amplify a >2,200-nt region of these viruses. novel -CoV sequences in the tricolored bat suggest a new clade in the Alphacoronavirus genus. a novel -CoV in the tricolored bat is closely related to HCoV-NL63. molecular clock analysis was conducted to estimate an MRCA between ARCoV.2 and HCoV-NL63. this analysis was performed using sequence fragments obtained from the highly conserved viral polymerase (nsp12), which is arguably the most conserved region of the CoV genome. the results are shown with highest posterior densities (HPD) in Table 1. ARCoV.1 and NECoV were nearly identical, but only ARCoV.1 was used in this analysis. model roots (range)a Mean substitution rateb (range) GTR + G + I, constant 3469 (1237\u20135923) 1.629 104 (1.034 104\u20132.3499 104) SRD06, constant 5940 (2424\u20139921) 1.76 104 (1.073 104\u20132.570 104) SRD06. tricolored bat lung cells grew most efficiently. stocks of these cells were cryopreserved at 140\u00b0C. primary cells were immortalized with lentiviral vectors containing hTERT. have PESU-B5L cells that have undergone over 30 passages and over 100 doublings. the immortalization process appears to have selected for a single fibroblast-resembling cell population. RT-PCR and sequencing were used to determine that the murine Bmi-1 gene was expressed in the immortalized cells. PESU-B5L cells were infected with mock or NL63gfp. they were monitored by bright-field and fluorescence microscopy. no GFP expression was detected in cells over 5 days of infection. cells expressing HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid appeared bright green under fluorescent conditions. uninfected cells strongly expressed a protein of approximately 45 kDa. the protein was consistent with the size of the HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid protein. western blot of HCoV-NL63 and mock-infected PESU-B5L cells lysates with -actin as a loading control. nucleocapsid (N) protein appears as a distinct band at 45 kDa. RT-PCR was conducted on RNA harvested from these cells at 24 and 48 h. PESU-B5L cells were infected with the mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV, MA15, and with chimeric SARS-CoV viruses bearing the spike genes of GD03 and HC/SZ/61/03 at an MOI of 1. all three of these viruses replicated subgenomic RNAs in the PESU-B5L lung cells. sg transcripts for X1, envelope (E), membrane (M), and open reading frame 6 were detected at both time points for all three strains. sg M bands for all three strains were excised, and the DNA was purified and sequenced to verify that the SARS-CoV leader sequence and the 5\u2032 end of the M gene were present. only a small number of species have been studied and shown to harbor RNA viruses. more than 1,000 species of bats have not been assessed for the presence of CoVs or other RNA and DNA viruses. there may be hundreds of novel coronaviruses in bats throughout the world. if this is the case, then the next CoV spillover from bats to humans is a matter of ecological opportunity. some of the Roche 454 sequences derived from the tricolored bat were more closely related to HCoV-NL63 than any other -CoV. however, it is clear that specific bat species harbor SARS-like viruses that are more closely related to HCoV-NL63 than any other -CoV. we successfully immortalized cells from a bat species known to harbor a unique -CoV that appears to share common ancestry with HCoV-NL63. to our knowledge, this is the first bat cell line that supports growth of HCoVs. this is the first bat cell line that supports growth of HCoVs. the adenovirus serotype 5 genes driven from the promoters for human phosphoglycerate kinase and thymidine kinase of herpes simplex virus (22), and hTERT (7). hTERT alone cannot immortalize primary human bronchial epithelial cells (30), possibly due to suboptimal culture conditions. hTERT in combination with viral oncogenes has been used to immortalize mamma we have been using high-throughput and Sanger sequencing approaches to identify and fill in genomic sequences that can be engineered into infectious clones. we previously used this synthetic approach to resurrect Bat CoV HKU3, the SARS-like CoV identified in the Chinese horseshoe bat (26) the only block to replication of this bat virus in primate cells was the 180-amino-acid portion of the spike glycoprotein known as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (3). HCoV-NL63 appears to replicate more efficiently than any of the SARS-CoV variants. a recent study has shown that signatures of recurrent positive selection in the bat ACE2 gene map almost perfectly to known SARS-CoV interaction surfaces. ACE2 utilization preceded the emergence of SARS-CoV-like viruses from bats (9) coVs have a long history of cross-species transmission (35) BCoV and HCoV-OC43 are closely related, with an MRCA predicted to have occurred 100 years ago (2, 50, 51) BCoV strains have also spread to alpaca and wild ruminants. early strains CCoV-1 and FCoV-1 diverged from common ancestor. ARS-CoV is thought to have crossed species barriers from horseshoe bats to masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) to humans. the virus is thought to have crossed the species barriers from horseshoe bats to masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes allow the virus to maintain viral populations in multiple hosts, exchange genetic information to alter pathogenesis or transmission characteristics. further work is necessary to determine the risks of such a cycle, evaluate the impact that this could have on public health."}
