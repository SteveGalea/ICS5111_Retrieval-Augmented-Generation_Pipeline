{"summary": "more than 99 different viruses have been detected in and/or isolated from bats of diverse species. Rabies virus and other lyssaviruses infect bats of many species. Old World fruit bats (family Pteropodidae) are reservoirs for both Hendra and Nipah viruses. phylogenetic analysis of complete genome sequences of coronaviruses from bats, humans, birds, and other vertebrates suggests that bats may be the reservoir hosts from which all coronavirus lineages originated. the potential for emergence of zoonotic viruses into the human population depends on the prevalence of the virus in its host species, host range mutations within viral quasispecies. spertilionidae (16 species) and Molossidae (1 species) were sampled at 16 rural sites (sites #1\u201316, Fig. 1) in the Rocky Mountain region during the summer of 2007. additional bat fecal samples were collected during the summers of 2008 and 2009. intestines of bats submitted to public health departments were negative for CoV. counties with at least one coV-positive intestinal sample are shown in black. bats were either captured in mist nets during the night as they drank or foraged. each sample was extracted on a Qiagen Biorobot EZ1 using the EZ1 viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. extracted RNA was eluted in 60 L of RNase-free water and stored at 80\u00b0C. we designed primers within the amplicons of alphacoronaviruses from bats of several species in the genus Myotis and big brown bats. RT-PCR was performed using consensus degenerate primers from several regions within the RdRp gene in a superScript III one-step RT-PCR system. bats were captured under authority of a scientific collecting license. sample collection Insectivorous bats of the families Vespertilionidae (16 species) and Molossidae (1 species) were sampled at 16 rural sites in the Rocky Mountain region during the summer of 2007. some bats had been tagged with PIT tags for host demographic analysis. circles represent sites where live bats were captured and fecal or swab samples were taken. counties with at least one coV-positive intestinal sample are shown in black. RNA from 200 L of each sample was extracted using the EZ1 viral RNA mini kit. extracted RNA was eluted in 60 L of RNase-free water and stored at 80\u00b0C. PCR and nucleotide Sequencing All cDNA samples collected from bats at rural sites or during 2007 were screened for CoV RNA by PCR with a pair of pan-CoV consensus primers [13] that amplify a highly conserved region (400 nucleotide amplicon) of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene as previously described. template included in every RT and PCR experiment gave no false-positive results. samples were scored as positive if coV RNA was detected on two PCR runs. phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method. site # Species Total Tested # Positive % Positive 1 Myotis lucifugus 11 0 0 2 Myotis volans 3 0 0 3 Eptesicus fuscus 29 0 0 Lasionycteris noctivagans 1 0 0 Lasionycteris noctivagans 1 0 0 Lasionycteris noctivagans 1 0 0 Myotis ciliolab tivagans 7 0 0 Myotis californicus 7 0 0 Myotis ciliolabrum 19 0 0 Myotis evotis 22 0 0 Myotis thysanodes 4 0 0 Myotis volans 22 0 0 Myotis yumanensis 3 0 0 Parastrellus hesperus 8 0 0 Tadarid evotis 7 0 0 Myotis thysanodes 1 0 0 16 Myotis volans 3 0 0 17 Eptesicus fuscus 123 16 13 18 Eptesicus fuscus 123 11 9 20 Eptesicus fuscus 41 4 10 21 Eptesicus fuscus 149 10 7 CDPHE+ Eptesicus fuscus 29 6 19 Myotis ciliolabrum 6 (21%) of 29 big brown bats and 1 (5%) of 20 little brown bats tested were positive for CoV RNA. female bats often show year-to-year fidelity to maternity roosts. female bats often show year-to-year fidelity to maternity roosts. 56 bats of eight different species were sampled during two summers (2008 and 2009) only big brown bats at site #5 were positive for CoV RNA. prevalence of CoV infection varied from 2%\u201319% depending on the site, month, and year of collection. the prevalence of CoV RNA in big brown bats was higher in 2008 (13%) than in 2007 (5%). 113 (24%) of the 465 bats from these sites had been previously individually tagged. sixteen (14%) of these tagged bats were captured and sampled more than once. males 302 19 6 0.59 Females 697 52 8 Adults 877 55 6 0.008 Juveniles 122 16 13 Urban Maternity Roosts (all Eptesicus fuscus bats) Males 61 11 18 0.04 Females 404 35 9 Adults 413 36 9 0.03 Juveniles 52 10 19 *Fisher's exact test. the first cluster (A) included CoV RNAs of big brown bats from sites #5 and #17\u201321, the one big brown bat from site #4, and two long-legged bats from site #4 that were collected in 2007 and 2009. the sequence of the A cluster (representative bat: RM-Bt-CoV 09-07/2009 MV) was 96% identical to that from an occult bat (RM-Bt-CoV 3) reported previously.

Phylogenetic analysis of an 1100 nucleotide segment of the S2 region of the spike gene of RM-Bat-CoV 453/2007/EF (Eptesicus fuscus) compared to other known alphacoronaviruses. coV RNA was detected in approximately 7% of all bats sampled. a relatively high prevalence of CoV RNA was detected in bats of 2 species. a relatively high prevalence of CoV RNA was detected in bats of 2 species. s have only been detected in Old World bat species belonging to the families Pteropodidae (Rousettus spp) and Rhinolophidae (Rhinolophus spp.) no bat families of the suborder Yinpterochiroptera occur in the New World. the finding of only alphacoronaviruses may be because bats of these species are resistant to other CoVs. long-legged bats had an alphacoronavirus RNA prevalence of 31% in 2007, 19% in 2009, but only 6% in 2008. prevalence of CoV infection in these bat roosts tended to peak in late spring/early summer. similar findings were made in rhinolophid bats in Asia that harbor SARs-like-bat-CoVs [37] and in fruit bats experimentally infected with bat CoVs which showed no signs of illness. phylogenetic studies of CoV genomes in Old World bats in Asia and Europe have suggested some bat CoVs may infect bats of only one species or several closely related species. big brown bats had a high prevalence of CoV infection, ranging from 0\u201367% (overall 10%) depending on the site and time of year. recombination between different bats could potentially occur in vivo, giving rise to new CoV genomes. the great diversity of CoVs, their high frequency of RNA recombination, their ability to persist in bat populations suggest that ongoing evolution of CoVs in bats may pose a continuing threat for emergence of novel CoVs into new hosts. a. Amplicons obtained from a big brown bat (07-453 EF) and a long legged (07-433 MV) bat in 2007 have 97% sequence similarity with a big brown bat (RM-Bt-CoV one microliter of cDNA was amplified in a 50-L reaction containing 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.2 mol/L deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 2.5 U of HotStarTaq (QIAGEN) and 2.0 mol/L primers. RT-PCR was performed using consensus degenerate primers from several areas within the RdRp gene."}
