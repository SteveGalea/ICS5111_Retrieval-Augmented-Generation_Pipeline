{"summary": "a naturally occurring disease outbreak or deliberate epidemic could generate critically ill victims in numbers that greatly exceed a hospital's capacity to deliver traditional critical care [8,9] in countries with widespread critical care capabilities few, if any, critically ill survivors of traumatic disasters have had to forgo acceptable critical care because of staff or resource shortages [1-7]. emergency mass critical care requires modification to standards of critical care interventions, staffing, equipment, and triage to provide an acceptable level of care for large numbers of critically ill victims. at a minimum, hospitals should plan to deliver a basic mode(s) of mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic support, antibiotic or other disease-specific countermeasure therapy, and a small set of prophylactic interventions. a major challenge will be to determine when, and on what basis, traditional standards of critical care are modified to accommodate emergency conditions. if engagement of care givers and the community is neglected, mass casualty standards could be misinterpreted and generate distrust or fail to be implemented during a disaster. technology systems could capture and aggregate data for large, simple, near real time clinical trials. system could be invaluable for illuminating the course of new or unfamiliar diseases. if a large SARS outbreak occurs tomorrow, clinicians would have no more clinical trial data on which to base treatment decisions than they had 2 years ago. all critical care staff should be explicit and routinely trained in infection control procedures, including how to remove personal protective equipment without self-contaminating. leaders of critical care units should consider implementing droplet and contact precautions for all critically ill patients with febrile respiratory illnesses."}
