{"summary": "ARIs rank among the top 5 causes of illness and hospitalization in children. high childhood mortality leads to about 5 million fatalities per year in developing countries in children younger than 5 years of age. a number of newly discovered viruses, such as human bocavirus (HBoV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1 are detected in these infections. etiology of ARIs in the Kurdistan of Iraq remains poorly studied. a total of 269 samples obtained from an appropriate study group were analyzed using the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel Fast assay. nasopharyngeal samples were collected using nylon-flocked nasal swabs. the swabs were immersed in 3 mL of 1 phosphate buffered saline. the swabs were kept at 70\u00b0C until further use. the study protocol was reviewed and approved by the research ethics committee of the College of Medicine, Hawler Medical University. the collection and use of clinical samples and data from patients at the Raparin Pediatric Teaching Hospital was approved by the Erbil Director of Health. informed consent was obtained from the parents of all the participating children. patients were assigned to 6 age groups: 1 year (n = 140; 51.8%), 1 to 2 years (n = 52; 19.2%), 2 to 3 years (n = 25; 9.2%), 3 to 4 years (n = 11; 4.1%), 4 to 5 years (n = 6; 2.2%), and >5 years (n = 30; 11.1%). 174 (85.7%) Difficulty in breathing 245 (91.1%) 193 (95.1%) Apnea 106 (39.4%) 75 (36.9%) Allergy 26 (9.6%) 20 (9.8%) Diarrhea 20 (7.4%) 13 (6.4%) Ear ache 65 (24.1%) 55 (27.1%) Abbreviations: ARI, acute respiratory infection; SEM, standard error of mean. ity rate was highest in samples obtained from children under 1 year (117/140, 83.6%) and very high in the combined age groups of children under 2 years of age 154/192. virus-detection rates were found to decline with increasing age. HBoV was detected only in children less than 2 years of age. 0 16 (5.9) PIV 3 1 (0.7) 2 (3.8) 0 1 (9.1) 0 0 0 4 (1.5) HboV 4 (2.8) 2 (3.8) 0 0 0 0 6 (2.2) HCoV-NL63 1 (0.7) 0 0 0 0 0 1 (0.4) single-virus infection 91 (65) 25 (48.1) 16 (64) 8 (72.7) 3 (50) 16 (53.3) 2 161 ( the most common virus combinations in coinfections were found to be HEV/HRV + RSV (12/42, 28.5%), HEV/HRV + hMPV (9/42, 21.4%), and HEV/HRV + hAdV (human adenovirus; 7/42, 16.6%). there was 1 sample in which a coinfection with 4 viruses could be confirmed (0.37%). a total of 270 pediatric patients were enrolled in this study of causative viral agents of ARIs among hospitalized children. all patients presented with typical symptoms of an ARI that required hospitalization and admission to the pediatric emergency unit. the majority of the study population was urban residents. patients with confirmed ARI (N = 203) Age, mean SEM, months 23.6 28.5 20.6 23.9 Gender Male 182 (67.65%) 134 (66.0%) Female 87 (32.35%) 69 (34.0%) Age (years) 1 140 (52.0%) 117 (57.6%) 1.1-2 52 (19.3%) 37 (18.2%) 2.1-3 25 (9.29%) 16 (7.9%) 3.1-4 11 (4.08%) 9 (4.5%) 4.1-5 6 (2.2 influenza B virus, adenovirus, PIV 1, and influenza A virus (H1N1pdm09 in all cases) were detected less frequently (6.3%, 6.3%, 5.9%, and 3.7%, respectively) HBoV, PIV 3, and HCoV-NL63 were detected in just a few cases (2.2%, 1.5%, and 0.4%, respectively; Table 2). 1 (16.6) 8 (26.6) 1 88 (32.7) RSV 1 18 (12.8) 2 (3.8) 2 (8) 1 (9.1) 0 2 (6.6) 0 25 (9.3) RSV 2 26 (18.6) 3 (5.8) 0 0 1 (16.6) 0 0 30 (11.1) hMPV 22 (15.7) 7 (13.4) 2 (8) 2 (18.2) 0 2 (6.6) 1 36 (13.4) Inf A 2 (1.4) 4 (7.7) 2 ovirus; inf A, influenza A virus; inf B, influenza B virus; hAdV, human adenovirus; HBoV, human bocavirus; HCoV, human coronavirus. a Shown are the total numbers of samples tested positive for a specific virus in a given age group. the two triple infections were combinations of (a) HEV/HRV + RSV + PIV 1 and (b) HEV/HRV + hAdV + hMPV+ hAdV. one quadruple infection was found to be caused by HEV/HRV + RSV + hAdV + PIV1. the most frequently detected viruses causing ARIs in patients of our study group were HEV/HRV and RSV, both as single-virus infections and viral coinfections. however, in our study members of the genus Enterovirus (HEV and HRV) was the most frequently detected virus groups. hMPV was one of the most frequently detected viruses involved in ARIs. two previous studies investigated the role of hMPV infection in ARIs in Iraq using non-nucleic acid\u2013based techniques. HCoVs were detected only in a single case, in which HCoV-NL63 could be identified, indicating a minor role of these viruses in causing severe forms of ARIs in the Erbil City population. this result was similar to a study conducted in Kuwait, which failed to detect any HCoV-NL63 infections in 735 hospitalized patients. virological studies of ARIs in pediatric outpatient departments have been required to explore this possibility. in our study, viral coinfections were confirmed in 15.6% of the patients. this was similar to other studies, such as those published by Akinloye et al10 (16%), He et al37 (14.9%), and Bicer et al12 (20.4%). the main findings of this prospective study provide valuable epidemiological information on the viral etiology of ARIs in Erbil, Kurdistan region, Iraq. they confirm the major role of respiratory viruses in hospitalized children in the study area, particularly in young infants younger than 5 years."}
