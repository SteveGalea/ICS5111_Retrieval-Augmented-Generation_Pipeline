{"summary": "multiple sequence alignment (MSA) uses dynamic programming, a regression technique that finds an optimal alignment by assigning scores to different possible alignments and taking the one with the highest score. the computational cost of MSA is extremely high and may not produce accurate phylogeny for diverse systems of different families of RNA viruses. a sequence of length N, n (A, C, T, G) denotes the number of nucleotide in the sequence. s[][v] is the distance from the first nucleotide (regarded as origin) to the vth nucleotide in the DNA sequence. s and classify species into correct clusters with higher accuracy and less time cost. the Coronaviruses dataset includes 36 viral genomes. 34 viruses are from the exact same dataset with. o n o f t h e s e q u e q u e n c e 1, i f a p p e a r s a t t h e i t h p o s i t i o n o f t h e s e q u e n c e property 1 and 2 can be easily proved by the definition of Indicator Function (u) and Accumulated Indicator Function (i) now we prove the Property 3, which builds up the relationship between the Accumulated Indicator Function and the average position of a specific nucleotide. ti1 ti... tn N, satisfies 1 t1 t2... ti1 ti... tn N, [ 0, 0,..., 0, t 1 1 1, 1,..., 1, ( t 1 1 ) 2, 2,..., 2,...

Coronaviruses Dataset belongs to the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae, in the order Nidovirales. in this paper, we construct a dataset with 36 Coronaviruses, in which 34 viruses are from the exact same dataset with. the other two viruses are two new members in Coronavirus. the phylogenetic tree indicates that the ChinaGD01 and MERS-CoV/KOR forms a monophyletic clade, sister to the SARS clade, which may possibly be a variant from some SARS viruses. we also performed the same procedure with k-mer method on the Coronaviruses dataset. phylogenetic uPGMA tree using k-mer method on Coronaviruses dataset. influenza A viruses are single-stranded RNA viruses. HA has 15 subtypes and NA has 9 subtypes. phylogenetic UPGMA tree using k-mer (k = 5) method on Influenza A viruses dataset. k-mer method and MSA are also performed on this dataset. k-value is determined in the same procedure as in the Coronaviruses dataset as 5. a 72 Ebolaviruses dataset is tested, which is a subset of the 163 viruses used in Zheng et al. (2015). it consists of 38 Ebola virus (EBOV), 11 Sudan virus (SUDV), 9 Reston virus (RESTV), 1 Ta Forest virus (TAFV), 6 Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), 6 Marburg virus (MARV) and 1 Lloviuvirus (LLOV). if the virus shares its distance with its neighbor, we can predict it from its nearest neighbor. the accuracy can be computed by dividing the number of correct ones by the number of all viruses, in this case, by 351. the optimal choice of k is made by the same procedure in the other datasets. 5.24% 21.65% 12.25% 65.53% Computing Time (seconds) 2466.73 4179.24 8636.13 24011.70 Unable to compute on laptop Mammals Our Accumulated Natural Vector performs well not only on virus datasets, but also on other common species. the genomes are from seven known clusters: Primates, Carnivora, Cetartiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Eulipotyphla, La the phylogenetic UPGMA tree using ANV method on mammals mtDNA dataset. we simulated a sequence of length 1,000 bp as a base sequence. both A and B have 100 nucleotides different from the original sequence. ds distances between the distance matrix and the \u201ccorrect\u201d matrix are shown in Table 5. the simulated dataset is in Table S6. the difference between trees mainly lie in the branch of sequences generated from B. the phylogenetic UPGMA tree using ANV method on simulated dataset. the phylogenetic UPGMA tree using FFP (k-mer) method when K = 4 on simulated dataset. we can build up a phylogenetic tree using ANV method on Coronaviruses. Figure 1 shows that the two new members are clustered together with Group 4. the phylogenetic tree indicates that the ChinaGD01 and MERS-CoV forms a monophyletic clade, sister to the SARS clade. k = 7 is equal to that of k+1, i.e., tree topologies converge. the results of k = 8 and k = 9 are in the Figures S1, S2. the four outgroup viruses cannot be clustered together as another branch from the tree of Coronaviruses. the group 1 was divided into smaller groups. there is no specific research about this virus and we infer that it may be the intermediate from H7N3 to H7N9. H7N3 had an outbreak in July 2012, causing millions of poultry's infection. but there is no report of infection from human to human yet. the natural Graph using ANV method on influenza A virus dataset is tested. it consists of 38 Ebola virus (EBOV), 11 Sudan virus (SUDV), 9 Reston virus (RESTV), 1 Ta Forest virus (TAFV), 6 Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), 6 Marburg virus (MARV) and 1 Lloviuvirus. we test a large dataset of 351 viruses in Li et al. (2016). the average length of them is 11,952 nucleotides and it makes alignment methods on a laptop impossible. this evaluation is inspired by the high rate of missing labels in many databases of viruses. we extract 31 mammalian mitochondrial genomes with average length of 16,696 nucleotides. the genomes are from seven known clusters: Primates, Carnivora, Cetartiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Eulipotyphla, Lagomorpha, and Rodentia. the difference can be attributed to that mitochondrial genomes in mammals may not always reflect the organismal evolutionary history. however, it still keeps more information than k-mer does in Figure 7B. the distance within each group is smaller than the distances between groups. alignment is done by the \"seqpdist\" function in MATLAB Bioinformatics toolbox. we calculate the pairwise alignment distance between the sequences. the tree of alignment, ANV and FFP (k = 4) methods are shown in figures 8, 9A,B separately. cleotide substitutions in B_original B4 5 random nucleotide substitutions in B_original B6 10 random nucleotide substitutions in B_original B6 10 bp Deletion from positions 601:610 in B_original B9 20 bp Insertion at position 51 in B_original B10 20 bp Insertion at position 601 in B_original B11 50 bp Transposition from position 1 to 50 in B_original B12 100 a protein sequence would produce an 1,830-dim vector for each sequence. the covariance for three amino acids at a time may be more reasonable.
