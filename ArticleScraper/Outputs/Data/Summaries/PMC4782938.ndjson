{"summary": "carbonic anhydrases (CAIX) catalyze reversible hydration of carbon dioxide in order to maintain pH balance in living organisms. the gene is directly activated at the transcriptional level by hypoxia inducible transcription factor HIF-1. in hypoxic conditions, the CAIX gene is directly activated at the transcriptional level. a high level of CAIX expression is restricted to the majority of primary RCC (clear cell type with granular or spindle cell, papillary type of chromophilic cell and collecting duct except for chromphobic cell) but is not observed in normal kidney tissues, benign epithelial cystic lesions, or non-renal cell clear cell adenocarcinoma. mAbG250 was used to construct a first-generation single-chain antibody scFv(G250)-CD4-FcRI which was then retrovirus transduced and expressed on autologous T cells. two out of the three patients suffered from liver toxicity. improvement in safety and efficacy is required for this cellular therapy against RCC to be moved into further clinical trials. two out of three patients with advanced chemotherapy-resistant chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) had received adoptive immunotherapy using second-generation CAR (4-1BB) targeting CD19. second-generation CD28-encoded CARs targeting CD19 have shown promising results in CLL, indolent B-cell lymphoma, and ALL. scFv-Fc minibodies were converted to scFv-Fc (hIgG1) to test for anti-CAIX mAb-mediated ADCC. all scFv-Fcs exhibited antigen-specific tumor lysis. first-generation scFvG36 fused to truncated extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular domains of CD28 plus signaling domain of TCR (G36-CD28z) second-generation CD28 CAR was generated, consisting of scFvG36 fused to truncated extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular domains of CD28 plus signaling domain of TCR. anti-CAIX scFv CARs fused with human CD28 extracellular, TM, and intracellular signaling domain to TCR. both anti-CAIX scFv CARs were cloned into a bicistronic self-inactivating vector with expression driven by an internal eF1 promoter. the CAR control construct contains an irrelevant anti-HIV CCR5 specific A8 scFv substitution. C9-tag expression was only detected at circa one-third the level of the CAIX-Fc protein (Figure 2b, middle column), which is likely related to the finding that mAb 1D4 preferentially recognizes the rhodopsin nonapeptide C9 when presented as a carboxy-terminal versus internal polypeptide sequence. transduced cells that were cultured in vitro for 6 weeks maintained their expression of ZsGreen. levels of type I cytokines IL-2, interferon (IFN)-, and IL-17 secretion were seen with control A8 CD28z CART cells or LAK cells alone. both first- and second-generation G36-CD28z CART cells secreted 6.5, 2.3, and 4 more IL-2, IFN-, and IL-17, respectively than first-generation G36-CD8z CART cells. Clone 4-1 is a in vivo passaged subclone of sk-rc-52. after interaction with CAIX+ sk-rc-52 tumor cells, G36-CD28z CART cells produced 6 times more spots than seen for G36-CD28z CART cells upon interaction with CAIX+ sk-rc-59 tumor cells. Irrelevant A8-CD28z CART cells and control T cell LAK showed the background nonspecific tumor lysis with around 20% lysis when using the highest 100:1 of E:T ratio. transduced and untransduced T cells showed background lysis with around 20% lysis. chimeric antigen receptor-transduced T cells (CART) cells were plated with irradiated tumor cells (CAIX+ sk-rc-52 and CAIX sk-rc-59) weekly at three different ratios of tumor to T cells as indicated. no expansion of A8-CD28z CART cells was seen over the 2-week study. the percentage of CD8 cells remained constant throughout the 16-day study. sk-rc59 cells were incubated with irradiated tumor cells for 1 or 2 weeks. cytokines were detected at levels 50 pg/ml interferon- and 10 pg/ml interleukin-2. sk-rc59 cells were injected intravenously. in trial one, treated and untreated CAIX sk-rc-59 tumors had average size of 6.09 0.02 mm on day 4 and 9.29 0.12 mm on day 25. tumor size of G36-CD28z CART cell-treated mice showed statistically significant reduction in size compared to no T-cell-treated mice. mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 7.5 106 sk-rc-52 and 5 106 sk-rc-59 tumor cells at left and right flank respectively. mice were injected intravenously with 50 106 G36 CD28 CART cells, A8 CD28 CART cells ( 20% CAR+), LAK, or phosphate-buffered saline alone. gene construct LAK A8-CD28z G36-CD28z Statistics Target antigen None Irrelevant Specific \u2014 Costimulatory None Two signals Partial response 2 1 10 P 0.005*; p 0.001** Nonpartial response 13 14 5 N.S. no statistically significant relationship between number of tumors and partial response between T cells transduced with LAK and with A8-CD28z. TUNNEL assay was used to measure apoptosis of tumor cells by TUNNEL assay with PE-Cy5 dye. transduced T cells were shown by ZsGreen. two representative slides were shown to indicate the apoptosis of tumor cells at the edge of tumor (upper panel) and inside the tumor bed (middle panel), respectively. granzyme B+ T cells are seen infiltrating into the CAIX+ sk-rc-52 tumor sections. granzyme B+ T cells were seen surrounding the tumor and inside the tumor. tumor tissue was sectioned for this staining after 1 day. scFv-Fc minibodies exhibited antigen-specific tumor lysis. scFv-Fc minibodies were added to target tumor cells in presence of human peripheral blood mononucleated cell (E:T 25:1). two generations of anti-CAIX CARs were constructed: first-generation G36 CD8 CAR. scFvG36 fused to truncated extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular domains of CD28 plus signaling domain of TCR (G36-CD28z) to deliver costimulatory signals, second-generation CD28 CAR was generated. the second-generation CAR, scFv-CD28-TCR (CD28 CAR), contains anti-CAIX scFv fused with human CD28 extracellular, TM, and intracellular signaling domain to TCR. both anti-CAIX CARs were cloned into a bicistronic self-inactivating vector with expression driven by an internal eF1 promoter. the transduction rate of primary T cells ranged from 17 to 45% by ZsGreen expression in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. CAIX-Fc fusion protein can bind to the G36-CD8z and -CD28z CART cells but not to control A8-CD28z CART cells. first- and second-generation G36-CD28z CART cells secreted 6.5, 2.3, and 4 more IL-2, IFN-, and IL-17, respectively than first-generation G36-CD8z CART cells. a representative out of two to three results is shown. cytotoxicity of CAIX-specific CART cells, control A8 CART cells, or LAK cells were incubated in a 4-hour cytotoxicity assay. Clone 4-1 is a in vivo passaged subclone of sk-rc-52. G36-CD28z CART cells produced 6 times more spots than seen for G36-CD28z CART cells upon interaction with sk-rc-59 tumor cells. ART cells showed two- to threefold higher cytotoxicity than G36-CD8z CART cells. but with low ratio of 5:1, G36-CD28z CART cells showed good cytotoxicity with up to 60% lysis using 100:1 of E:T ratio. transduced and untransduced T cells showed background lysis. at ratio 1:8, the population of G36-CD28z CART cells increased to 30-fold. at a ratio of 1:4, the number of G36-CD28z CART cells increased 19-fold. with higher amounts of tumor cells, neither G36-CD28z or G36-CD8z CART cells could proliferate. expression of G36-CD8z CART cells was enriched from 19% on day 0 (same levels at T cells only) to 32% on day 8 to 88% on day 16. no expansion of A8-CD28z CART cells was seen over the 2-week study. CART cells IFN- (pg/ml) IL-2 secretion after 1 or 2 weeks of contact with tumor cellsa. one week Two weeks One week Two weeks RC-SK-52 (CAIX+) cells G36-CD28z 25,788 28,192 7,524 24,937 G36-CD8z 13,096 10,961 1,470 10,029. a8-CD28z CART cell, or untransduced T cells (LAK) were injected intravenously. no T-cell treatment was included in order to compare growth of tumor and effect of cell-therapy. mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 7.5 106 sk-rc-52 and 5 106 sk-rc-59 tumor cells at left and right flank respectively. mice were injected intravenously with 50 106 G36 CD28 CART cells, A8 CD28 CART cells ( 20% CAR+), LAK, or phosphate-buffered saline alone. 8-CD28z CART cells and LAKs at P 0.001 and P 0.005 respectively by Fisher test. partial response is defined as the regression of tumor to smaller than 30% volume of control tumor. transduced T cells were shown by ZsGreen. two representative slides were shown to indicate the apoptosis of tumor cells at the edge of tumor (upper panel) and inside the tumor bed (middle panel), respectively. after the treatment with CART cells, the regressing tumors were stained by granzyme B antibody (brown) and H&E. the apoptoic tumor cells lost the DAPI nuclear staining. the apoptoic tumor cells lost the DAPI nuclear staining. the tumors were harvested and sections were stained with granzyme B antibody. scFvG36 was chosen for targeting the anti-CAIX CARs based on its killing activity, good expression levels, and ability to mediate CAIX internalization. we constructed self-inactivating lentiviral vectors expressing first- and second-generation fully human G36 CARs. a mechanistic link between IL-17 and NK activity has been recently demonstrated. a second-generation G36-CD28z CART cells showed superior activity in vivo in inhibiting CAIX+ tumor cell growth compared to irrelevant CART or LAK cells. anti-CAIX mAbs M75 and G250 are directed to the N-terminal PG domain. this staining is restricted to the apical surface of cells of the stomach and bile duct mucosa39,40 and small intestine. mAb G36 recognizes the centrally located catalytic domain. it does not recognize CAIX by immunohistochemical staining. however, it remains to be determined if similar crossreactivity and toxicity would occur in vivo with G36-CD28z CART cells. soluble serum CAIX will cause widespread triggering of infused genetically redirected T cells. toxicity demonstrated in patients treated with first-generation anti-CAIX CART cells treated with chimeric CAIX Abs. this strategy could be developed with fully human anti-CAIX mAbs. scFv isolation and conversion of scFv to scFv-Fc CAIX-specific scFv antibodies were isolated from a nonimmune human phage library. scFv-coding DNA fragments from the pFarber phagemid were digested with SfiI/NotI sites and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1-F105L-hinge-s anti-SARS antibody (11A)24 and fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies alone were used as negative controls. construction of scFv-CD8-TCR and scFv-CD28-TCR constructs in phagemid vector pSL1180. chimeric TCR constructs tagged with internal C9 peptide were cloned into the pcDNA3.1-F105L-hinge stuffer vector using NotI and PacI restriction sites. the primers used for cloning chimeric TCR constructs are 5\u2032 TAG GCG GCC GCa acc gag acc agc cag gtg ccc gcc gcc gcc gcc anti-CCR5 scFv (clone A8 as irrelevant scFv control) antibody fragments were cloned to replace anti-CXCR4 scFv at SfiI/NotI sites to create CAIX-specific chimeric TCR constructs. the lentivirus vector pHAGE-CMV-DsRed-IRES-ZsGreen was replaced by an eF1 promoter derived from the pSIN the virus pellets were resuspended in R-10 medium and kept frozen at 80 \u00b0C. the cells were infected with two or three rounds of lentivirus transduction. five hundred thousand cells were stained with antibodies at recommended concentration. target tumor cells were labeled with a fluorescent ligand (BATDA) for 30 minutes at 37 \u00b0C. the culture was incubated for 4 hours in humidified 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C. 20 l of supernatant was transferred to a flat-bottom plate. the control for spontaneous release was prepared by culturing the labeling cells only. reducing buffer (0.1 mol/l dithiothreitol) and run on a 10\u201320% polyacrylamide gradient gel. membrane was incubated with 1:2,000 primary antibody, anti-human -chain monoclonal antibody 8D3. then with 1:3,000 secondary antibody horseradish peroxidase. 5 million sk-rc-59 and 7.5 million passaged sk-rc-52 cells were subcutaneously inoculated on opposing flanks into nude mice. after 7 days, tumors grew to the size of 6 mm, and 50 million nontransduced or transduced T cells were injected intravenously. mice were also treated with 20,000 IU human IL-2 by peritoneal injection every 2 days.
