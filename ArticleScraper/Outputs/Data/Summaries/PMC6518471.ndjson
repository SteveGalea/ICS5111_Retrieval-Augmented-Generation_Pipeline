{"summary": "association between school sessions and ARI outbreaks has long been observed. researchers have proposed school attendance as an important driver of early autumn and winter spikes in ARIs. but research demonstrating this effect is relatively limited. a composite of \u2018all-cause\u2019 respiratory infection diagnoses was used to estimate the level to which school attendance contributes to seasonal outbreaks of all-cause respiratory infections. we included temperature and relative humidity in the model of seasonality. ARI diagnoses were stratified by patient age and trended over time. five age categories were used: preschool children (0\u20134 years), school-aged children (5\u201317 years), young adults (18\u201324 years), adults (25\u201364 years) and older adults (65+ years). ARI counts from 2008 to 2011 are depicted in Figure 2. 68 895 8.5 2008\u201309 11 148 44 094 25.3 12 856 81 800 15.7 4635 57 510 8.1 30 364 531 460 5.7 5244 148 184 3.5 64 247 863 048 7.4 2009\u201310 10 463 44 549 23.5 11 784 83 367 14.1 4341 55 231 7.9 29 317 547 346 5.4 5000 155 765 3.2 60 905 886 258 6.9 2010 school attendance for each week of every calendar year was coded with one of six values representing: (1) 1 week in session, (2) 2 weeks in session, (3) more than 2 consecutive weeks in session, (4) 1 week out of session, (5) 2 weeks out of session or (6) more than 2 consecutive weeks out of session. statistical analysis was performed with R version 2.15.1. a composite of 'all-cause' respiratory infection diagnoses was regarded as statistically significant. ARI diagnoses were stratified by patient age and trended. the local database was originally developed for ongoing assessments of inappropriate antibiotic use. five age categories were used: preschool children (0\u20134 years), school-aged children (5\u201317 years), young adults (18\u201324 years), adults (25\u201364 years) and older adults (65+ years).
