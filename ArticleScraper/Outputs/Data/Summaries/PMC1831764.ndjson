{"summary": "the use of medicinal plants is an option for livestock farmers who cannot afford to use allopathic drugs under certified organic programs. 128 plants are used for ruminant health and diets, representing several plant families. is, Urtica dioica, Symphytum officinale, Pinus ponderosa, Potentilla pacifica, Althaea officinalis, Salix alba and Ulmus fulva. Mastitis is treated with Achillea millefolium, Arctium lappa, Salix alba, Teucrium scorodonia and Galium aparine. the average wage for farmers working full time in agriculture in the capital region of Vancouver Island was $14,000. 53% of all farms have receipts of less than $5000. in 2003 there were 420 certified organic farmers 51% of which had less than $10,000 in gross sales. literature on ethnomedicinal plants, folk medicine and related fields in British Columbia was reviewed prior to and during the research. a purposive sample of livestock farmers was created to target key informants with the knowledge sought. the sample was obtained from membership lists of organic farmers, other specialists in alternative medicine and holistic veterinarians. participants discussed the previously produced ruminant section of the data. a low-cost, non-experimental method was used to evaluate potential efficacy of ethnoveterinary remedies. if ethnobotanical and pharmacological data are consistent with the folk use of the plant, its use is classed in the highest level of validity and is considered efficacious. the participants discussed the previously produced ruminant section of the data. four levels of confidence were established: 1. Minimal level: If no information supports the use it indicates that the plant may be inactive. low level: a plant (or closely related species of the same genus) attains the lowest level of validity, if no further phytochemical or pharmacological information validates the popular use.
