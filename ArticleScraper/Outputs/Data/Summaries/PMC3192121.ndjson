{"summary": "genus Orbivirus currently includes twenty two distinct virus species. genomes composed of 10 segments of linear double stranded RNA (dsRNA) vectored by Culicoides midges, ticks, phlebotomine flies, anopheline or culicine mosquitoes. several tick-borne orbiviruses can infect humans. VP1, VP4 and VP6 are minor enzymatic proteins that are packaged along with the ten genome segments within the central space of the virus core [6], [7] orbivirus outer-capsid layer is composed of two additional structural proteins (VP2 and VP5 of BTV), which mediate cell-attachment and penetration during infection. the relative number and locations of the BTV structural proteins have been determined in biochemical and structural studies. BTV-Seg-9 encodes the minor core protein VP6, which is a helicase. the putative protein (identified here as NS4) varies in size between 10 kDa and 22.5 kDa. cytoplasm and nuclei of cells infected with insect-borne and tick-borne orbiviruses. KC cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 pfu/cell. infected cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 72 hours until cell lysis began. RNA was extracted from cell pellets using guanidinium isothiocyanate (RNA NOW reagent: Biogentex, Tx, USA) alignments of NS4 of various orbiviruses were generated using the Clustal X program [23] and pairwise aa identities calculated using the MEGA 4 package [24]. the presence of \u2018coiled-coils\u2019 was indicated by analyses using the program \u2018COILS\u2019 (http://www.ch.embnet.org/cgi-bin/COILS_form_parser) and the predictprotein server (http://www.predictprotein. sequences are specific to the NS4 ORF. sequences in bold characters are restriction enzyme sites. pGEX-4T-2 vector and Seg-9 PCR. products were double-digested with EcoRI and NotI (BTV-8) or EcoRI and XbaI (GIV) enzymes. pCI-neo vector and Seg-9 PCR products were gel purified using Genclean kit (Qbiogen) the soluble fraction of the fusion protein was purified by glutathione affinity chromatography using glutathione sepharose. proteins were analysed by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using a 10% polyacrylamide separating gel (Miniprotean III) with a 3% stacking gel and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue.

DNAse I is an endodeoxyribonuclease that can degrade dsDNA into 5\u2032 phosphorylated tetranucleotides. dsDNA ladder (Promega) with sizes ranging from 2645 to 36 bp provides a target for DNAse I cleavage. dsRNA was added to separate wells of a streptavidin-coated 96 well plate (Pierce) the wells were washed three times with TBS-Tween-20, then two hundred microlitres of a 5% solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added in each well, to block non-specific sites. rabbit anti-BTV or anti-GIV NS4 sera was diluted 1/250 in 5% BSA and 100 l was added the reaction was stopped by adding 100 l of 1 M HCl. wells from which the dsRNA was omitted were included as negative controls. NS4 (BTV or GIV) alone was incubated were also included as controls. KC cells were infected at an MOI of 0.1 pfu/cell and then incubated at 28\u00b0C for 7 days. both BHK-21 and KC cell pellets were used in western blot analyses. bacterial particles formed a blue band at the interface of the sucrose solutions. the presence of nuclear localisation signals were analysed by predictNSL. the presence of nuclear localisation signals were analysed by predictNSL. synonymous site conservation within the BTV VP6 coding sequence was analysed. Sequences in bold characters are restriction enzyme sites. pGEX-4T-2 vector and Seg-9 PCR products were double-digested with EcoRI and NotI (BTV-8) or EcoRI and XhoI (GIV) enzymes. corresponding vectors and PCR products were ligated overnight (O/N) at 16\u00b0C using T4 DNA ligase (Roche) to generate pGEX-BTVNS4, pGEX-GIVNS4, pCI-BTVNS4 or pCI-GIVNS4. plasmids were used to transform XL1-Blue bacteria (Stratagene) the purified fusion protein was used to immunize rabbits (Harlan) with an initial injection followed by 4 boosts at 2 weeks interval in the presence of Montanide ISA50 (Seppic) as an adjuvant. western blot analysis of purified BTV and GIV virus particles. membranes were washed three times with TBS-Tween-20 and incubated with monoclonal, anti-rabbit, peroxydase conjugate (Sigma) after 2 hours the membranes were washed three times with TBS-Tween-20 and developed using 4-chloro-naphthol (Sigma) in presence of hydrogen peroxide. localization of NS4 in infected cells by confocal fluorescence microscopy. 50% confluent cells were infected with 0.1 pfu/cell of BTV-8 or GIV. incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4 hours or 24 to 72 hours, then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunofluorescence. cells were transfected with pCI-BTVNS4 using anti-BTV-8 immune serum. at 48 hours post-transfection, cells were dissolved in sample denaturation buffer. nucleic acid protection assays dsRNA binding proteins can compete with Dicer. competition assays between DNAse I (Roche) and NS4 were carried out in a final volume of 20 l, containing 2 l of 10X DNAse I buffer and 2 g of dsDNA. the completed reaction was heated at 99\u00b0C for 1 minute to inactivate the DNase and the reaction products were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis. the wells were washed three times with TBS-Tween-20, then two hundred microlitres of a 5% solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added in each well, to block non-specific sites. rabbit anti-BTV or anti-GIV NS4 sera was diluted 1/250 in 5% BSA and 100 l was added to each well. results Bioinformatic analyses The program MLOGD models and compares sequence evolution in single-coding and dual-coding sequences. it has previously been used to identify a second ORF, in a different but overlapping reading frame from that encoding the viral helicase (VP6 of BTV), within Seg-9 of the insect-borne orbiviruses [17], [18], [30]. this ORF was also identified in tick-borne orbiviruses. non-coding regions of orbiviruses likely to contain functionally important elements. panel 1 shows positions in aligned sequences, of stop codons (blue triangles) in the +1 and +2 reading frames relative to the VP6 reading frame, and alignment gaps (green rectangles) AHSV NS4 exhibits strong relatedness to fzo-mitofusin protein. the fzo protein has a coiled-coil structure and mediates mitochondrial. the fzo protein has a coiled-coil structure and mediates mitochondrial. PHSV NS4 (111 aa long) contains a coiled-coil domain between aa 75 and 111. YUOV NS4 (113 aa long) contains two coiled-coils domains between aa 5 to 85 and aa 110\u2013140. the BTV NS4 (77 aa long) appears to contain only a single coiled coil structure, between aa 27 and 77. aa region 55 to 129 of GIV NS4 showed 29% identity (55% similarity) to aa 1823 to 1890 of UTP20 (a component of the nucleolus). soluble fraction was used in competition assays with DNase I or endoribonucleases belonging to the RNAse III family. antiserum identified a single protein band with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 12 kDa in BTV-8 infected cells. the anti-BTV NS4 antiserum is therefore specific to NS4 and does not cross react with other viral proteins. anti-GIV NS4 rabbit antiserum does not cross react with other viral proteins. Lane NI indicates non-infected KC cells which do not show any cross reactivity of anti-BTV NS4 antibody and cellular proteins. NS4 that was identified in infected cells using anti-NS4 antibodies (12 kDa) was absent from non-infected cells. Western blot analysis of purified BTV-8 showed all seven structural proteins stained with Coomassie blue. the reaction is negative, indicating that NS4 is truly non-structural. anti-BTV NS4 antibodies identified a protein in the nucleus of infected cells. localisation of NS4 was detected as early as 4 hours post-infection. NS4 formed small aggregates throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus. no immunofluorescence signal was detected when non-infected cells were labelled using anti-NS4 antibodies. no immuno-fluorescence signal was detected when non-infected cells were labelled using anti-NS4 antibodies. HK-21 cells infected with GIV showing fluorescence in the cytoplasm and cell membrane but less in the nucleus. cells were incubated with anti-BTV-8 NS4 rabbit antibodies. cells were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 (green fluorescence) conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. to the nucleoli was confirmed using anti-fibrillarin antibodies. fluorescence signal was super-imposable on that of NS4 in the nucleoli. d NS4 formed spherical bodies with 0.7 and 1 m in diameter. similar spherical bodies were occasionally observed in cells infected with BTV-8 or GIV. spherical bodies are associations between NS4 and lipid droplets. NS4 was found to form spherical bodies with a diameter between 0.7 and 1 m. similar results were obtained with cells transfected with pCI-GIVNS4 expressing NS4 of GIV. mice immune serum from an animal infected with pCI-BTVNS4 identified a protein in cells transfected with pCI-BTVNS4 expressing NS4 of BTV-8. no band was identified in non-transfected cells. incubation of dsRNA with VP9 did not affect dsRNA integrity. however, pre-incubation of dsRNA with VP9 then treatment with Dicer resulted in cleavage into 21 bp long fragments. similar results were obtained with RNAse III. incubation of dsDNA with VP9 (as a control) did not affect dsDNA integrity. dsDNA ladder pre-incubated with GIV NS4 followed by DNase I. dsDNA ladder protected against DNase cleavage. colorimetric assay to detect interactions of dsRNA with dsRNA. concentrations of dsRNA were bound to wells coated with streptavidin. BTV NS4 or GIV NS4 were added to the wells in triplicate. NS4 sequences contain a high proportion of charged residues, with basic R+K (arginine + lysine) content ranging from 13% to 22%. acidic E+D (glutamic + aspartic acids) content ranges from 12% to 22%. each NS4 protein contains 4\u20135 histidine residues, with exception of the BTV protein, which contains none. panel 3 shows the probability that the degree of conservation within a given window could be obtained under a null model of neutral evolution of VP6-frame synonymous sites. amino acid identity between NS4 of the different Orbivirus species compared ranged from 5% to 50%. PHSV NS4 (111 aa long) contains a coiled-coil domain between aa 75 and 111, YUOV NS4. the fzo protein has a coiled-coil structure and mediates mitochondrial fusion. AHSV NS4 (143 aa long) contains two coiled-coils domains between aa 5 to 45 and 75 to 105. the BTV NS4 (77 aa long) appears to contain only a single coiled coil structure, between aa 27 and 77. two overlapping potential nuclear localisation signals\u2019 (NLS) were identified in the aa sequence of PHSV NS4 (positions 86\u201399: RKLERVE NS4 NS4 of BTV and GIV were cloned into pGEX-4T-2. the soluble fraction was used in competition assays with dsRNA. the inclusion bodies fraction was purified using bugbuster reagent. anti-GIV NS4 rabbit antiserum does not cross react with cellular proteins. western blot analysis of purified BTV virus particles showed no reaction with anti-BTV NS4 antibodies. NS4 that was identified in infected cells using anti-NS4 antibodies (12 kDa) was absent from non-infected cells. BTVBHK24 = BHK-21 cells harvested at 24 hours post-infection. Lane NI indicates non-infected BHK-21 cells. NS4 that was identified in infected cells using anti-NS4 antibodies (12 kDa) was absent from non-infected cells. non-infected (lane N-INF) and BTV-8 infected cells probed with anti-BTV-8 VP2 antibodies raised in mice against recombinant VP2. antiserum did not cross react with non-infected cells. localisation of NS4 in infected cells NS4 was detected as early as 4 hours post-infection. NS4 formed small aggregates throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus. this is consistent with bioinformatic analysis showing similarities between NS4 and membrane-associated proteins. cells were incubated with anti-BTV-8 NS4 rabbit antibodies and anti-alpha tubulin mouse antibodies. cells were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated anti-mouse. cells stained with DAPI, anti-alpha-tubulin and anti-NS4 antibodies. cells stained with anti-BTV-8 NS4 rabbit antibodies and anti-alpha tubulin mouse antibodies. cells were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 (green fluorescence) conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 568 (red fluorescence) conjugated anti-mouse. cells were incubated with anti-BTV-8 NS4 rabbit antibodies. infected cells showed fibrillarin (A: in red) detected by anti-fibrillarin antibody. NS4 (B: in green) identified by anti-BTV-8 NS4 antibodies. cells transfected with pCI-GIVNS4 stained with oil-red-O. figure 19 shows non-infected cells stained with oil-red-O. similar data were reported for rotaviruses, where VP2, VP6 or NSP5 associate with lipid droplets. cells infected with pCI-BTVNS4 stained with oil-red-O and probed with anti-BTV NS4 antibodies. the protein band had the same size as that identified by the anti-BTV NS4 rabbit immune serum in BTV-infected cells. at 48 hours post-transfection cells were scraped, lysed in sample denaturation buffer. pCI-BTVNS4 indicates cells transfected with pCI-BTVNS4 plasmid. NT indicates non-transfected cells. NS4 that was identified in transfected cells using anti-NS4 antibodies (12 kDa) was absent from non-transfected cells. Lane 1: dsRNA ladder pre-incubated with GIV NS4 followed by Dicer. VP9 of BAV did not prevent Dicer from cleaving long dsRNAs into 21 bp long siRNAs. Lane 2: dsDNA ladder pre-incubated with VP9 of BAV followed by DNAse I. VP9 of BAV did not prevent DNAse I from degrading dsDNA. negative control wells containing only dsRNA also had OD values close to zero. ylated dsRNA were bound to wells coated with streptavidin. wells not containing dsRNA/NS4 were included as negative controls. only wells containing the dsRNA to which GIV NS4 was added reacted with anti-GIV antibodies. NS4 was previously shown to contain significant aa sequence matches with dsRNA-binding domains. pfam programme suggested translation of ORFx may be initiated via \u2018leaky ribosome-scanning\u2019. hydrophobicity profiles of orbivirus NS4 based on a Clustal X generated alignment of orbivirus amino acid sequences. residue numbers are relative to NS4 of GIV (the longest NS4 identified to date) plots show significant similarities with GRAVY values of 1.02 to 1.05. double-stranded RNA-binding proteins (DRBPs) do not recognize specific nucleotide sequences. this conformation allows DRBPs to bind non-specifically to dsRNAs. this conformation allows DRBPs to bind non-specifically to dsRNAs. the lack of nucleotide binding recognition suggests target specificity may generally be governed by interactions with other proteins. NS4 was detected in the nucleoli of cells harvested at 24 hours post-infection. anti-fibrillarin antibodies failed to detect fibrillarin. this may reflect BTV induced apoptosis, leading to nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation. the ability of GIV NS4 to protect dsRNA from cleavage by endoribonucleases of the RNAse III family and its ability to bind dsRNA agree with sequence analyses that indicated the presence of a dsRNA binding domain. other reoviruses dsRNA-binding proteins include Sigma 3 of mammalian orthoreovirus. intracellular expression of an NS1 specific antibody fragment (scFv) destabilised the formation of NS1 tubules in infected cells. NS3 is effectively expressed in insect cells [15], it is much less abundant in mammalian cells [4]"}
