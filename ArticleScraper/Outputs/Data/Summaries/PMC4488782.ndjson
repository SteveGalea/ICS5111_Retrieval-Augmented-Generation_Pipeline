{"summary": "viral pathogens most commonly associated with acute respiratory infections are picornaviruses (including the species rhinovirus (RV) A, RVB, RVC and the enteroviruses A\u2013D), orthomyxoviruses (influenza A, influenza B and influenza C), paramyxoviruses (including the parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1\u20134, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) for the prevention of ARI have yielded heterogeneous results [14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27], with moderate protective effects overall. a number of in vitro studies have investigated the effects of vitamin D metabolites on host immune responses to respiratory viruses. oligomerisation domain (NOD)-like receptors activate epithelial cells in order to initiate a rapid immune response against viral invasion. intraepithelial dendritic cells (DCs), DCs residing just below the respiratory epithelium, and tissue-resident macrophages continuously sample particles in the airway lumen. intracellular TLRs 3, 7, 8 and 9 are located on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane before UNC93B1-dependent trafficking cytosolic NLR NOD2 is associated with the recognition of bacterial muramyl dipeptide. despite differences in viral genomes, replication strategies, and the types of PRRs activated, common signalling pathways are utilized. recognition of viral pathogens elicit conserved outcomes. type I IFNs are some of the earliest cytokines to be produced. the inflammatory cytokines TNF-, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12 are also produced at an early stage of the innate immune response. they promote leukocyte extravasation by increasing endothelial expression of adhesion molecules. antimicrobial peptide LL-37 is traditionally viewed as a component of the immune response to bacteria. anti-viral activity of LL-37 has also been demonstrated against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. it disrupts the membrane of influenza virus [54], modify cytokine production [54], enhance TLR3 signalling [55], and have direct effects on RSV viral particles and infected epithelial cells. macrophages appear to have a vital role in the antiviral immune response. they produce antimicrobial peptides during the innate response, and phagocytosing dead cells and cellular debris to prevent immunopathology. adapted immune response PRR signalling facilitates maturation and trafficking of dendritic cells. evasion mechanisms by viruses emphasise importance of complement in anti-viral immunity. matrix protein M1 of influenza A binds to C1q to prevent interaction with antibodies on the surface of infected cells. membrane fusion or endocytosis follows, thus internalizing the virus. pathogen-associated molecular patterns on the virus can be recognised by various intracellular innate pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) intraepithelial dendritic cells (DCs), DCs residing just below the respiratory epithelium, and tissue-resident macrophages continuously sample particles in the airway lumen. the intracellular TLRs 3, 7, 8 and 9 are located on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane before UNC93B1-dependent (an ER multi-transmembrane-domain-containing protein) trafficking to the endolysosome following viral infection. recognition of viral pathogens elicit conserved outcomes, with the interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-mediated production of type I IFNs a central feature. kappa B (NF-B)- and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated regulation of various inflammatory cytokines. IRAK/TRAF6 complex phosphorylates IRF7 to initiate transcription of type I IFN genes. inflammatory cytokines TNF-, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12 are also produced at an early stage of the innate immune response. chemokines CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10 and IL-15 facilitate recruitment of neutrophils and NK cells. antimicrobial peptide LL-37 is produced by both neutrophils and macrophages. anti-viral activity of LL-37 has also been demonstrated against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. it disrupts the membrane of influenza virus [54], modify cytokine production [54], enhance TLR3 signalling [55], and have direct effects on RSV viral particles. Adaptive Immune Response PRR signalling facilitates maturation and trafficking of dendritic cells. DCs with antigen-MHC complexes migrate through the afferent lymph vessels to secondary lymph nodes. these T-lymphocytes are activated, proliferate, differentiate into effector T-cells. CD16 on NK cells recognises the Fc portion of antibodies bound to the surface and kills the target cell [37,65,66,67]. evasion mechanisms by viruses emphasise the importance of complement in anti-viral immunity, as reviewed elsewhere [68,69]. the detection of VDR abundance throughout the immune system has directed vitamin D research into the area of immunology. the observation that VDR expression is regulated by immune signalling. the detection of CYP27B1 expression by immune cells has directed vitamin D research into the area of immunology. extra-renal 1-hydroxylation in cells such as monocytes and macrophages is regulated primarily by immune inputs. this renders the immune system responsive to circulating levels of 25(OH)D and allows the sustained and potentially beneficial production of 1,25(OH)2D during an immune response. ligation of TLR4 by LPS up-regulated CYP27B1 expression in monocytes [93,94] extra-renal expression of CYP27B1 has been shown to be possible. other TLRs or alternate PRRs may promote extra-renal expression of CYP27B1. extra-renal 1,25(OH)2D synthesis has been shown to be regulated by TLR ligation. active form of LL-37 is cleaved by serine protease 3 in neutrophils. LL-37 is present in epithelial cells, monocytes, NK cells, B-cells and T-cells. cathelicidins are multifunctional antimicrobial peptides, and the sole form in humans is hCAP-18. proximal promoter region of deFB4 gene also contains a VDRE. 1,25(OH)2D can upregulate expression of -defensin 2. vitamin D has been demonstrated to modulate the innate immune system. vitamin D induces autophagy by regulating pathways such as Bcl-2, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex, and cathelicidin production. expression of TLR2 and TLR4 is inhibited in monocytes, resulting in impaired downstream signalling and hyporesponsiveness to PAMPS. dendritic cells are the most potent antigen-presenting cells. they have a direct effect on lymphocyte activation and induction of the adaptive immune response. addition of 1,25(OH)2D has been demonstrated to inhibit DC differentiation, maturation and antigen presentation. DC production of IL-12 and IL-23 inhibited by 1,25(OH)2D. IL-12, as well as stimulating the development of Th1 T-cells, also inhibits the development of Th2 cells. IL-10 is a cytokine with pleiotropic effects in immunoregulation. 1,25(OH)2D has also been shown to have direct effects on T-cells. production of IL-2, IFN-, TNF-, IL-17 and IL-21 are all inhibited. production of IL-2, IFN-, TNF-, IL-17 and IL-21 are also directly altered. vitamin D may affect other lymphocyte subsets, with fewer invariant natural killer (iNKT) cells and CD8+ T-cells from MS patients secreting less IFN- and TNF- and more IL-5 and TGF- following 1,25(OH)2D treatment. however, the mechanisms behind any potential beneficial role of vitamin D are unclear, with conflicting cellular studies on the effects of vitamin D on Th2 cells [170,171]. 1,25(OH)2D has diverse and extensive effects on the immune compartment. monocytes producing more LL-37 and -defensin, with increased NOD2 expression and autophagy. also producing diminished amounts of inflammatory cytokines, with decreased expression of TLR2 and TLR4. Rhinovirus infection of epithelial cells results in increased production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. During RSV infection, IB expression is reduced, resulting in increased transcription of NF-B-driven genes. STAT1 is also phosphorylated and able to translocate into the nucleus. incubation with vitamin D metabolites did not alter this effect. treatment with vitamin D did, however, enhance secretion of CXCL8 and CXCL10. these molecules are pro-inflammatory chemokines responsible for the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection. cells infected with RSV for 24 h had decreased protein levels of IB. increase in IB results in NF-B remaining inactive in the cytoplasm. vitamin D inhibits RSV induction of NF-B-driven IFN- and CXCL10 secretion. 1,25(OH)2D is able to decrease levels of phosphorylated STAT-1 (pSTAT-1) and increase IB protein levels, with subsequent diminished expression of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), IRF7, IFN- and CXCL8 mRNA. a number of studies have been carried out in calves, looking at the association between vitamin D and bovine RSV (BRSV) vitamin D treatment has been shown to increase secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12p40 following BRSV infection [189] no effect was observed on T-cell cytokine production [190], or IFN-, CXCL8, TNF-, IL-1 or IL-6 secretion [189]. a simple and cost-effective prevention strategy is desirable. the antimicrobial peptides LL-37 and human -defensin 2 have anti-viral properties against influenza virus. this may be another mechanism by which vitamin D exerts antiviral effects on influenza virus infection. the majority of work into vitamin D has been investigating the potential use of vitamin D as an adjuvant in influenza vaccines. vitamin D metabolites are pro-inflammatory chemokines responsible for the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection. vitamin D deficiency linked to RSV susceptibility, with low cord blood plasma concentrations of 25(OH)D related to RSV incidence in the first year of life. NF-B remains inactive in the cytoplasm, preventing its translocation into the nucleus and subsequent binding to DNA promoter regions. vitamin D inhibits RSV induction of NF-B-driven IFN- and CXCL10 secretion. vitamin D is able to dampen NF-B and STAT-1 mediated inflammation to reduce RSV immunopathology, with an impairment in regulation of STAT-1 phosphorylation resulting in more severe disease. a number of studies have been carried out in calves, looking at the association between vitamin D and bovine RSV. vitamin D treatment has been shown to increase secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12p40 following BRSV infection [189]. no effect was observed on T-cell cytokine production [190], or IFN-, CXCL8, TNF-, IL-1 or IL-6 secretion [189]. a simple and cost-effective prevention strategy is desirable. the majority of work into vitamin D and influenza infection has been investigating the potential use of vitamin D as an adjuvant in influenza vaccines. however, vitamin D has not been shown to be able to modulate the humoral response to inactivated influenza virus in this setting [194,195,196,197,198]. vitamin D metabolites affect respiratory virus-induced expression of cell surface markers mediating viral entry and bacterial adhesion to respiratory epithelial cells."}
