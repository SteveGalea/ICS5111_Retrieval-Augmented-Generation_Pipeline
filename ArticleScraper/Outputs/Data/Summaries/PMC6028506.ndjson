{"summary": "viruses can be pathogenic and disease-causing or opportunistic and relatively harmless. opportunistic viruses can benefit the host, and this virus mutualism is evolutionarily old. rosy apple aphid is infected by a densovirus that induces wing development in the aphid. the flavivirus GB virus C, also known as hepatitis G virus, behaves as a mutualist. the beneficial effect of viruses on the host are indicative of the existence of virus-encoded molecules that can drive the establishment of complex nondevelopmentally predetermined phenotypes. flaviviruses alter expression of genes that control lipid accumulation by fatty acid oxidation. these gene expression changes alter lipid metabolism in a way that facilitates the build-up of a membranous web. cytomegalovirus infection also induces major metabolic reprogramming. the ability of an infected cell to reach an end point in which it acquires an infection-supporting phenotype (or viral infection state) can be seen as a state of virus-induced quasidifferentiation. in development, robustness is described as canalization, whereby developing cells are directed toward a specific outcome from uncertain starting conditions. the self-organizing and self-stabilizing property of the cell state defines gene expression profiles. the attractor state can be reached via an almost infinite number of paths, all of which lead to cell type\u2013specific gene expression patterns that are highly resistant to noise. however, in the presence of sufficiently high levels of fluctuations or in response to a deterministic signal, cells can switch between attractors. the ability of viruses to install the viral infection state implies the existence of mechanisms that allow the virus to override the robustness of the differentiated cell state imposed by the gene regulatory network. viruses need to interfere with the gene regulatory networks at points that operate as network hubs, or at multiple points, thus generating multiple perturbations to the system. viruses are well equipped to implement a multitarget strategy toward interference with multiple cell functions. at the foundation of this viral feature is the abundance of potentially polyreactive IDPs or intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) more than 20 small viruses encode five or fewer proteins have 50% or more disordered residues in their proteomes. the lack of inherent structure reduces the constraints of protein function and allows for creation of novel protein motifs that could be used by the virus to subvert host functions. a lack of structural constraints is supposed to promote a multiplicity of viral protein interactions with the host proteins. a lack of structural constraints is supposed to promote a multiplicity of viral protein interactions with the host proteins. a lack of structural constraints is supposed to promote a multiplicity of viral protein interactions with the host proteins. histone tail could be viewed as a collection of multiple overlapping SLiMs. each motif (whether unmodified or posttranslationally modified) functions as a discrete unit. this feature of the tail may contribute to its unique capability to facilitate binding of numerous nonhistone proteins. the methyltransferases G9a and GLP possess a functional histone-like sequence (red letters), localized within the N-terminal domain of the proteins. the methylated histone mimic in G9a (red hexagon) is mediated in cis by the catalytic SET domain that is flanked by pre- and post-SET domains. NS1 protein suppresses type I IFN response during influenza infection. tails of NS1 proteins from other influenza subtypes display no recognizable motifs. NS1 tail diversity may contribute to unique features of the individual virus subtypes. both the histone H3 tail and the H3N2 NS1 tail bind in a sequence-dependent fashion to the polymerase-associated factor 1 (Paf1) component of the Paf1 complex. the NS1 tail could be viewed as a highly interactive, internally disorganized motif where amino acid variations contribute to target specificity and hence to the unique features of individual virus subtypes. the insect polydnavirus Cotesia plutellae bracovirus encodes an orthologue of the insect histone H4 (CpBV-H4; Hepat et al., 2013) the life cycle of C. plutellae requires colonization of young larvae of P. xylostella, which display growth retardation and immunosuppression once parasitized. d protein VII shares limited sequence similarity with histone H3. binding of protein VII to chromatin appears to sustain binding of the immune modulatory protein HMGb1 to chromatin in the infected cells. yFV core is intrinsically disordered and features lysine residues that are spaced in a fashion similar to histone H4. xylostella exhibit growth retardation and immunosuppression once parasitized. CpBV-H4 suppresses host immunity by inhibiting expression of genes encoding phenoloxidase. it causes developmental retardation by inhibiting expression of insulin-like peptide in host larvae. the YFV core is intrinsically disordered and features lysine residues that are spaced in a fashion similar to histone H4. the yFV core is acetylated in infected cells and binds to nuclear proteins in a fashion similar to acetylated histone H4. the liquid phase separation at the SEs is likely to increase the fragility of these transcriptional hubs to perturbations based on the interaction between virus-derived and host-derived compartments. such interaction is likely to have a dramatic impact on chromatin function, as it will drastically increase the concentration of histone-like sequences in the vicinity of gene regulatory regions. the accumulation of viral histone mimics in the nucleolus of the infected cells might be sensed by dedicated (as yet unknown) sensors followed by nucleolar stress and death of the infected cell. phagocytosis of cells killed by viruses will amplify the systemic immune response against infection. the presence of histone mimics in structurally distinct viral proteins underscores the ability of viruses to use highly evolvable host protein sequences to develop optimal strategies for pathogen\u2013host interaction. this could be seen as a cell defense mechanism that minimizes the impact of viral disordered proteins on the host while preventing further viral spread."}
