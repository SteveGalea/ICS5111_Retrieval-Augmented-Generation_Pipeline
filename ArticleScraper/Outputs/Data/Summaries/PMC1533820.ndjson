{"summary": "we tested the hypothesis that pneumococci activated pulmonary epithelial cell cytokine release by c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) Methods Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) or epithelial HEK293 cells were infected with S. pneumoniae R6x. antisense-constructs targeting the AP-1 subunits Fra1 and Fra2 had no inhibitory effect on pneumococci-induced IL-8 release. over 40 % of all cases are due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is the most frequent etiologic agent of community-acquired pneumoniae. pneumococci infection of lung epithelial cells initiated complex signaling pathways leading to activation of the canonical NF-B pathway and subsequent expression of pro-inflammatory genes. p38 MAPK activation induced phosphorylation of NF-B p65/RelA at serine 536 at the interleukin-8 promoter thus paving the way for RNA polymerase II recruitment, and subsequent IL-8 transcription in pneumococci infected epithel AP-1 repressor A-Fos reduced IL-8 release induced by pneumococci but not by TNF. antisense-constructs targeting the AP-1 subunits Fra1 and Fra2 had no inhibitory effect on pneumococci-induced IL-8 release. cell viability was validated by microscopy and measurement LDH release into the supernatant. subconfluent cells were co-transfected by using superfect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) cells were infected for 15 h with pneumococci as indicated in a humidified atmosphere. RT-PCR For analysis of IL-8 and GAPDH gene expression in BEAS-2B cells total RNA was isolated with RNEasy Mini kit (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany) cDNA was amplified by PCR using specific intron-spanning specific primers for IL-8 and GAPDH. EMSA binding reactions were performed by incubating 7.5 g of nuclear extract with the annealed oligos according to the manufacturer's instructions. the reaction mixture was subject to electrophoresis on a 5% native gel. cells were washed in ice-cold 0.125 M glycin in PBS and then rapidly collected in ice cold PBS. cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% desoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 1% aprotinin) il8 promoter DNA was amplified by PCR using hotstart Taq polymerase. PCR conditions were 95\u00b0C for 15 min, 33 \u2013 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 20 s, 60\u00b0C for 20 s, 72\u00b0C for 20 s. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and detected by ethidium bromide staining. BEAS-2B cells were infected with 106 cfu/ml S. pneumoniae R6x for the times. IL-8 (B) and IL-6 (D) concentrations were measured in the supernatant. hek293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding TLR2. hek293 cells were infected with plasmids encoding TLR2. cells were stimulated with TNF (50 ng/ml) for 15 h. IL-8 concentration was measured in the supernatant. hewitt broth supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract and incubation at 37\u00b0C for 3 \u2013 4 h to midlog phase (A600 0.2 \u2013 0.4), harvested by centrifugation. cell viability was validated by microscopy and measurement LDH release into the supernatant. subconfluent cells were co-transfected by using superfect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) cytokine release was analyzed using beads specific for IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-17, MCP-1, TNF, IL-1, IFN, GM-CSF and MIP-1. RT-PCR For analysis of IL-8 and GAPDH gene expression in BEAS-2B cells total RNA was isolated with RNEasy protein was visualized by incubation with secondary IRDye 800- or Cy5.5-labeled antibodies. EMSA binding reactions were performed by incubating 7.5 g of nuclear extract with the annealed oligos according to the manufacturer's instructions. chromatin immunoprecipitation BEAS-2B cells were stimulated, culture medium was removed and 1% formaldehyde was added. cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% desoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 1% aprotinin) il8 promoter DNA was amplified by PCR using a PCR purification kit. PCR conditions were 95\u00b0C for 15 min, 33 \u2013 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 20 s, 60\u00b0C for 20 s, 72\u00b0C for 20 s. agarose gel electrophoresis detected equal amounts of input DNA. beAS-2B cells were infected with 106 cfu/ml S. pneumoniae R6x for the times. IL-8 (B) and IL-6 (D) concentrations were measured in the supernatant. recruitment of ser63/73-phosphorylated c-Jun and RNA polymerase II to the endogenous il8 promoter was detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation (C) representatives of at least three independent experiments are shown. AP-1 repressor blocked S. pneumoniae-induced IL-8 release. IL-1 was found only after 10 and 20 h of infection, and IL-7 level was elevated only after 5 h. significant time-dependent increase was found for GM-CSF, IFN, IL-1, IL-4, IL-12 (p70), IL-17 and TNF. IL-6 displayed highest protein level after 5 h of pneumococci exposure. IL-8 gene transcription is in part regulated by JNK-dependent activation of AP-1 in granulocytes. 4 h of infection were similar potent in AP-1 activation as 1 h of TNF stimulation with 10 ng/ml. no activated AP-1 was found 30 min after S. pneumoniae infection. antisense constructs for AP-1 subunits Fra1 or Fra2 [20] had no inhibitory effect on IL-8 release by HEK293-TLR2 cells. S. pneumoniae induced cytokine release in human lung epithelial cells. in human lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells, we detected JNK2 phosphorylation starting at 30 min post infection. after 4 h, pneumococci induced JNK2 phosphorylation similar to TNF. release of the important inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was also analyzed in cells with inhibited JNK kinase. phosphorylated AP-1-subunit c-Jun 2 and 4 h after pneumococci-infection of human lung epithelial cells. ser63/73-phosphorylated c-Jun and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) were recruited to the endogenous il8 promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation. epithelial cell line BEAS-2B with pneumococci resulted in a broad panel of regulatory cyto-, chemokines and growth factors. chemoattractants IL-8 (polymorphonuclear neutrophils) and MCP-1 (monocytes) were found. pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1, IL-6, and IL-13 were released after pneumococci infection. phosphorylation of JNK indicating activation in pneumococci-exposed epithelium. inhibition by chemical inhibitor SP600125 reduced IL-8 mRNA expression. intracellular IL-8 and IL-6 levels remained unchanged. we found increased AP-1 DNA-binding after pneumococci infection of human lung epithelial cells in EMSA as well as increased DNA binding of phosphorylated AP-1-subunit c-Jun in a specific ELISA. we also noted recruitment of Ser63/73-phosphorylated c-Jun and Pol II to the endogenous il8 promoter by ChIP. 500-A-Fos in TNF-related cell activation were obtained in HEK293 cells. a central role for JNK in the expression of IL-8 in lung epithelial cells was also reported by Wu et al. NK-AP-1 signaling pathway for pneumococci-induced IL-8 liberation by human pulmonary epithelial BEAS-2B cells. authors declare that they have no competing interests for this study. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
