{"summary": "GI (human), GII (human), GIII (bovine), GIV (human and feline), GV (murine) and GVI (canine) can be further divided into different genotypes. the prototype strain norwalk virus represents genogroups GI, GII, and GIV. murine norovirus (MNV) can be grown in cultured macrophages and dendritic cells. it remains unclear whether MNV is a model that recapitulates all the biological characteristics of HuNoVs. the released viral genomic RNA is believed to function as mRNA to direct the translation of the ORF1 polyprotein. the nonstructural proteins assemble into a replication complex to produce both new genomic RNA and a 3\u2032 coterminal subgenomic RNA expressing structural proteins VP1 and VP2. expression of VP1 is predominantly dependent on the production of a subgenomic RNA, it is widely considered a hallmark of HuNoV RNA replication (24). 293FT cells were transfected with carrier RNA or NV RNA. at each time point, cells were either lysed for IP and Western blotting of VP1 (D) or extracted for cellular RNA to quantify NV RNA by RT-qPCR (E). innate immune responses form the first line of defense against virus infections. studies using MNV have provided strong support for the role of the IFN responses in control of norovirus replication in vivo and in vitro. studies also showed that type III IFNs control persistent enteric MNV infection and that type III IFN treatment cures persistent MNV infection in mice. replication of NV and U201 RNA in cultured mammalian epithelial cells does not induce an IFN response. NV RNA replication does not block IFN induction elicited by an exogenous virus. the human hepatoma cell line Huh-7 was kindly provided by Shinji Makino (University of Texas Medical Branch) all cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum (FBS), with the addition of 30 g/ml puromycin. nucleotide at position 4607 (4607) of the ORF1 region causes a frameshift and premature termination of the viral polymerase (Pol) the full-length U201-RLuc reporter genome plasmid, pHuNoV-U201F-ORF2RLuc, contains the same 4607 mutation as described above. rabbit monoclonal antisera to NV p48 amino acids (aa) 70 to 83 (39) guinea pig polyclonal antiserum to NV p48 amino acids were provided by Kazuhiko Katayama (NIID, Japan) other antibodies used in Western blotting and immunofluorescence (IF) staining included rabbit monoclonal anti-IRF3 D6I4C (11904S; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti- ifn-2) and IL-28B (AF1598; R&D Systems) at 1:100, goat anti-IL-10 receptor (IL10R2) at 1:100, sheep anti-IL-28 receptor (IL28R1) at 1:100, and a cocktail of the above three antibodies at the same dilutions for neutralization of type III IFNs. IFN- (PHP108Z; AbD Serotec) and IFN- (407318; CalBiochem) were 293FT cells were seeded into 48-well plates with 250 l of medium/well or 96-well plates with 100 l of medium/well and cultured to 60 to 70% confluence. NV stool RNA or carrier RNA as a negative control was transfected into the cells using TransIT-mRNA transfection reagent (Mirus Bio) plasmid pT7-NV (37) was linearized with SalI as the template to synthesize NV genomic RNA by in vitro transcription using a mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 transcription kit. a reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay was performed as previously described. the levels of NV RNA in transfected cells are presented as genome copies/well. 293FT-ISRE-Luc reporter cells were transfected with NV stool RNA or with carrier RNA as a negative control. for experiments that measured the IFN response to NV RNA replication, the 293FT-ISRE-Luc reporter cells were transfected with NV stool RNA or with carrier RNA as a negative control. 2 l of the cell lysate was mixed with 50 l of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) in a 3.5-ml polypropylene tube (Sarstedt) and immediately measured for luminescence on a Sirius Luminometer (Berthold) programmed with 2 s of delay and 10 s of signal integration. the results presented are representative of experiments performed at least twice with similar results. cells were transfected with a combination of 100 ng of IFN--Luc reporter plasmid and 100 ng of vector, U201-RLuc, or U201-4607-RLuc reporter genome plasmid. at 7 hpt, the vector-transfected cells were infected with SeV at 40 hemagglutination units (HA)/ml. each cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation. 10 l of lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. cell monolayer was incubated with primary antibodies against viral antigens, dsRNA, or cellular proteins. shRNA knockdown 293FT cell lines 293FT-shMAVS and 293FT-shIRF3 were generated by transduction of 293FT cells with shRNA lentiviral particles of MAVS. the human hepatoma cell line Huh-7 was kindly provided by Shinji Makino (University of Texas Medical Branch) plasmid pKS435 contains empty vector plasmid containing human norovirus GII.3 strain U201 full-length genome cDNA, pHuNoV-U201F. mutant plasmid pT7-NV contains complete NV cDNA under the T7 promoter. erum to NV VP1 was generated by immunizing rabbits with virus-like particles (VLPs) formed by NV VP1 and VP2 that were expressed and purified from a baculovirus expression system. rabbit polyclonal antisera to NV p48 was previously generated by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide of NV p48 amino acids (aa) 70 to 83 (39) sheep anti-IFN- (31400-1; PBL Assay Science) at 1:4,000, rabbit anti-IFN- (31410-1; PBL Assay Science) at 1:1,000, a cocktail of the above four antibodies at the same dilutions for neutralization of type III IFNs. goat anti-IL-29 (IFN-1) with cross-reactivity to IL-28A (IFN-2) and IL-28B (IFN-3) were used at 1,000 the yield of NV stool RNA from 20-ml stool filtrate was typically 60 l of RNA at a concentration of 60 to 70 ng of RNA/l (mostly carrier RNA) for RNA transfection, 293FT cells were seeded into 48-well plates with 250 l of medium/well or 96-well plates with 100 l of medium/well and cultured to 60 to 70% confluence. 240 ng of NV stool RNA was mixed sequentially with 30 l of Opti-MEM, 0.6 l of mRNA boost reagent, and 0.6 l of TransIT-mRNA reagent. the mixture was incubated for 1 min and distributed at 10 l/well in triplicate to the cell culture. cells were lysed or fixed at 48 h post-RNA transfection unless otherwise indicated. all samples were quantified using RNAs from triplicate wells. the primers were antisense primer p165 (complementary to NV nucleotides [nt] 4689 to 4715) and sense primer p166 (NV nt 4641 to 4658) spent medium was added at 50 l/well to 293FT-ISRE-Luc reporter cells. cells were seeded into 96-well plates with 100 l of medium/well. at the end of the incubation, cells were lysed with 100 l/well cell culture lysis buffer (Promega) 293FT cells seeded into a 48-well plate were transfected with a combination of 100 ng of IFN--Luc reporter plasmid and 100 ng of vector, U201-RLuc, or U201-4607-RLuc reporter genome plasmid. at 24 hpt (17 h postinfection [hpi] for SeV), cells were either lysed with 100 l/well cell culture lysis buffer (Promega) for Western cell monolayer in a 48-well plate was lysed in 100 l/well NP-40 lysis buffer. cell lysates from luciferase assays were also used for Western blotting. each cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and 10 l of lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE. 293FT cells were derived from SV40 large T antigen-transformed HEK293 cells. transfection of 293FT cells with NV RNA isolated from stool samples of an NV-challenged volunteer resulted in expression of ORF1-encoded nonstructural proteins. the appearance of multiple VPg precursors, among which p22-VPg-Pro-Pol seemed to be a major precursor, confirmed the synthesis and auto-processing of the OR mature VPg, a 20-kDa protein believed to be covalently linked to the 5\u2032 end of viral genome RNA, was not detected by Western blotting. the detection of VP1 confirmed RNA replication since this protein is not present in the input RNA and not translated from the input RNA following transfection (due to the frameshift between ORF1 and ORF2). the NV IVT RNA failed to produce VP1 (Fig. 1C, VP1 panel), indicating that NV VP1 expression is strictly dependent on RNA replication. similar replication kinetics of NV RNA in transfected cells were shown by RT-qPCR assay. or IFN- at 100 and 1,000 U/ml (equivalent to 0.37 and 3.7 ng/ml IFN-), respectively. if 1,000 U/ml of IFN- was added to the cell culture at 12 h after NV RNA transfection, an inhibitory effect was also observed. a similarly reduced number of VP1-positive cells was observed in IFN--pretreated cells compared to the number in untreated cells. NV VP1 in cell lysate was detected by IP and Western blotting. cells were fixed at 48 h post-RNA transfection and stained with guinea pig antibody. NV RNA replication does not induce an IFN response in 293FT cells. ISRE-Luc detected both IFN induction (resistant to B18R) and signaling (sensitive to B18R) as expected, the B18R protein had no effect on ISRE-Luc activity induced by IL-29, a type III IFN. we therefore chose the 293FT-ISRE-Luc reporter cell line to detect both induction and signaling of type I and III IFNs. as a positive control, 100 g/ml poly(IC) was added to the medium of untransfected cells for 6 h. Luciferase activity was normalized to that of untransfected cells (control) and is presented as fold induction. NV RNA replication in transfected cells was confirmed by blotting of VP1. the induction of ISG56, an ISG, was observed only in poly(IC)-treated cells. at each time point, the IFN response was not detected by the ISRE-Luc assay. the entire U201 genome is cloned downstream a mammalian EF-1 promoter. cells transfected with the plasmid express the ORF1 polyprotein. they initiate RNA replication at low frequency, resulting in expression of VP1 and VP2 capsid proteins and production of progeny viruses. if staining of VPg and VP1 in plasmid-transfected cells showed that only U201 was capable of RNA replication. no VP1 was produced by replication-defective U201-4607 mutant. 293FT cells were transfected with IFN--Luc reporter in combination with vector, U201, or U201-4607-RLuc plasmid for 24 h. as a positive control, vector-transfected cells were infected with SeV for 18 h. we also performed a dual-luciferase assay by cotransfection of an IFN--Luc reporter plasmid with the U201-RLuc or U201-4607-RLuc (Renilla luciferase) reporter genome plasmid into 293FT cells. despite their different replication abilities, no activation of IFN- promoter was observed for either U201-RLuc or U201-4607-RLuc. TR was not observed for the GII.4 strain Lordsdale (45) the 4607 mutation creates an untranslated region between ORF1 and ORF2. the actual cause of the basal RLuc activity remains to be further investigated. lack of a detectable IFN response to NV and U201 RNA replication prompted us to evaluate whether dsRNA is generated during NV and U201 RNA replication. dsRNA was detected at 24 hpt by IF in both punctate and diffuse patterns within the same cells. neither VP1 nor dsRNA was detected in cells transfected with the U201-4607 mutant plasmid, which is capable of ORF1 expression (VPg-positive) but unable to replicate (Fig. 5B, U201-4607) dsRNA is generated in detectable amounts during NV and U201 RNA replication. this excludes the possibility that the lack of IFN response is due to the absence of dsRNA. NV and GII.3 VLPs do not induce an IFN response. NV RNA replication is not enhanced by neutralization of type I/III IFNs. no IFN response to NV or U201 RNA replication was detected by 293FT-ISRE-Luc reporter assay or by Western blotting of ISG56. NV RNA replication is not enhanced by neutralization of type I IFNs. the spent medium was collected before lysis of cells and added to 293FT-ISRE-Luc reporter cells. a cocktail of the four antibodies completely blocked both IFN- and IFN-. Luc reporter cells for 1 h followed by stimulation with 500 U/ml IL-29. NV RNA replication was also not enhanced by type III IFN neutralizing antibodies either applied individually or as a cocktail. NV RNA replication is not enhanced by knockdown of MAVS or IRF3. NV RNA replication is not enhanced by knockdown of MAVS or IRF3. some ISGs can be induced by activation of IFN induction pathways. 293FT and 293FT-shMAVS cells were transduced with ISRE-Luc lentiviral particles for 24 h. then mock or SeV infected (40 HA/ml) for 18 h. Luciferase activity was normalized to that of mock-treated 293FT cells. ns, not statistically significant, compared to results in 293FT cells. Knockdown experiments of the IFN-/ receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and IFN- receptors IL10R2 and IL-28R1 were also performed. but were found to be less effective than the B18R protein or IFN neutralizing antibodies in blocking type I/III IFNs. both NV RNA transfection and HAV infection were confirmed by Western blotting of NV VP1 and HAV VP1 and precursors. both the abundance and staining pattern of MAVS in NV RNA replicating (VP1-positive) cells remained intact compared to those in neighboring uninfected cells. nuclear translocation of IRF3 was not observed in seV-infected 293FT cells. this was despite a strong IFN response detected by ISRE-Luc and IFN--Luc assays. the exact mechanism remains to be further investigated. we speculate that a subset of IRF3 molecules induces phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. at 48 hpt (18 hpi for SeV), cells were fixed and labeled with antibodies to ISG56 (red) and NV VP1 (green) nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue) the laser scanning confocal microscopy images show that SeV-induced upregulation of ISG56 occurs in both NV VP1-positive and -negative cells. mature VPg, a 20-kDa protein believed to be covalently linked to the 5\u2032 end of viral genome RNA, was not detected by Western blotting. the detection of VP1 confirmed RNA replication since this protein is not present in the input RNA and not translated from the input RNA following transfection (due to the frameshift between ORF1 and ORF2). NV IVT RNA contains a 5\u2032 cap analog that is incorporated during IVT. translation and auto-processing of the ORF1 polyprotein were observed in both NV RNA- and NV IVT RNA-transfected cells. however, the NV IVT RNA failed to produce VP1 (Fig. 1C, VP1 panel), suggesting that VP1 expression is strictly dependent on RNA replication. IFN- for 24 h followed by NV RNA transfection, showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on NV RNA replication. IL-29 also showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on NV RNA replication, as measured by VP1 expression. NV RNA replication is sensitive to the antiviral effects of exogenously added type I and III IFNs. 293FT cells were transfected with NV RNA and treated with 1,000 U/ml IFN- at 12 h post-RNA transfection. NV VP1 in cell lysate was detected by Western blotting. vaccinia virus B18R protein, a soluble type I IFN decoy receptor (49), was able to completely block IFN- and IFN-induced ISRE-Luc activities. but only partially blocked SeV- and extracellular poly(IC)-induced ISRE-Luc activities. as expected, the B18R protein had no effect on ISRE-Luc activity induced by IL-29, a type III IFN. 293FT-ISRE-Luc reporter cells were untransfected (control) or transfected with carrier RNA or NV RNA. as a positive control, 100 g/ml poly(IC) was added to the medium of untransfected cells for 6 h. activity similar to that of both untransfected (control) and carrier RNA-transfected (another negative control) cells at 48 h post-RNA transfection. as a positive control, poly(IC), when added to the medium for 6 h, induced strong ISRE-Luc activity. NV RNA replication in transfected cells was confirmed by IP and Western blotting of VP1. GII.3 HuNoV strain is cloned downstream a mammalian EF-1 promoter. cells transfected with the plasmid initiate RNA replication at low frequency. a replication-defective mutant U201 genome contains a guanine nucleotide deletion at position 4607 (4607) in the region encoding the viral polymerase (Pol) truncated form of Pol was not detected by Western blotting. expression levels of p35 (Nterm) and p41 were elevated in mutant U2014607. if staining of VPg and VP1 in plasmid-transfected cells showed only U201 was capable of RNA replication. plasmids express ORF1 polyproteins (VPg-positive) but RNA replication occurs in only one of the U201-transfected cells, not in U201-4607-transfected cells. plasmid with an IFN--Luc reporter plasmid into 293FT cells at 24 hpt. no activation of the IFN- promoter was detected for either U201 or U201-4607. as a positive control, SeV induced strong activation of the IFN- promoter. a basal level of RLuc activity was observed for the mutant. this could be due to a basal level of internal translation initiation. this could be due to a basal level of internal translation initiation. but not likely to residual RNA replication or translation termination reinitiation (TTR) between ORF1 and ORF2. p48, a membrane-associated viral nonstructural protein involved in RNA replication (51, 52), shared the same punctate focus staining patterns with dsRNA and strongly colocalized with dsRNA. this results confirm that dsRNA is generated during NV RNA replication but also suggest that it is a component of the membrane-associated RNA replication complex. both VP1 and diffuse form of dsRNA were located in the cytoplasm. the punctate form of dsRNA was located in the nucleus where VP1 was absent. the nuclear localization of dsRNA appeared to be associated with RNA replication since dsRNA was not observed in the mutant plasmid-transfected cells. 293FT-ISRE-Luc reporter cells were treated with increasing doses (12 and 36 g/ml) of NV or GII.3 (strain TCH-104) VLPs or with 100 g/ml poly(IC) (as a positive control) Luciferase activity was normalized to that of untreated cells and is presented as fold induction. reagents used in these experiments were at sufficient doses to block any trace levels of IFNs that could possibly be induced by NV RNA replication. NV RNA replication as measured by VP1 expression was not enhanced by any of them. 293FT-ISRE-Luc reporter assay of type I IFN neutralizing antibodies. NV RNA replication, as measured by both VP1 and VPg expression, was not enhanced by type III IFN neutralizing antibodies. reporter cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml IL-29. NV RNA replication is not enhanced by knockdown of MAVS or IRF3. NV RNA replication is not enhanced by knockdown of MAVS. NV RNA replication is not enhanced by inhibition of either IFN induction or the signaling pathway. 293FT and 293FT-shMAVS cells were transduced with ISRE-Luc lentiviral particles for 24 h. Luciferase activity was normalized to that of mock-infected 293FT cells. 93FT-shIRF3 cells seeded in 48-well plates were transfected with NV RNA for 48 h. cells were fixed for IF staining with antibody to NV VP1. the number of VP1-positive cells per well was counted and is presented as mean values from multiple wells. Western blotting showed that the abundance of MAVS was markedly reduced in HAV-infected 293FT cells due to cleavage by the viral 3ABC protease precursor. both NV RNA transfection and HAV infection were confirmed by Western blotting of NV VP1 and HAV VP1 and precursors. both the abundance and staining pattern of MAVS in NV RNA replicating (VP1-positive) cells remained intact compared to those in ocal microscopy images of 293FT cells infected with HAV. cells were labeled with antibodies to MAVS (red) and HAV VP1 or NV VP1 (green) nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue) scale bars, 10 m. nuclear translocation of IRF3 was not observed in 293FT cells. NV RNA replication does not block an seV-induced IFN response. 293FT cells were transfected with NV RNA. at 30 h post-RNA transfection, cells were mock or infected. NV and GII.3 VLPs do not induce an IFN response when they are added to the medium of 293FT cell culture. the lack of an IFN response indicates that none of these steps triggers IFN induction. replication of GII.3 strain U201 RNA generated from a reverse genetics system has also been shown to decline after it peaks at 24 hpt (34). the failure of reinfection has been speculated to be caused by the lack of a necessary cell surface receptor/coreceptor or by a virus-induced IFN response that is sensed by the neighboring cells. the number of NV RNA replicating (VP1-positive) cells was not affected by IRF3 knockdown (Fig. 9G) or IFN neutralization (data not shown), suggesting that blocking the IFN response does not lower the threshold for NV replication. the commonly used Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells have a strong IFN response to SeV infection (56) but were not used in this study due to low NV RNA transfection efficiency. the lack of IFN response to HuNoV RNA replication in 293FT cells is likely due to an intrinsic feature of HuNoV RNA replication rather than to cell type difference. a report showed that MNV is transported across an in vitro-polarized mouse intestinal epithelial monolayer in the absence of viral replication by cells characteristic of microfold (M) cells (61). further studies showed that M cells are the primary route for MNV to cross the intestinal epithelial barrier and infect the underlying immune cells. this suggests that intestinal epithelial cells may not be the primary infection sites for MNV. receptor B18R protein was functionally equivalent to IFNAR1 or STAT1 knockout. shRNA knockdown of MAVS and IRF3 also efficiently inhibited RIG-I/MDA5 and TLR3 signaling pathways of IFN induction. NV does not replicate in human macrophages or dendritic cells (16) murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), both belong to the Coronaviridae family, do not induce an IFN response. dsRNA colocalizes with the membrane-associated nonstructural protein p48 in NV RNA-transfected cells. NV RNA replication is sensitive to type I and III IFN treatment. the same concentration (1,000 U/ml) of IFN- has been shown to be inhibitory even for the less IFN-sensitive strain of MHV (71). NV RNA replication does not block an IFN-induced IFN response. the NV stool RNA transfection system used in this study is an authentic RNA replication system in which the NV stool-isolated RNA is directly transfected into 293FT cells. both systems do not fully represent a complete virus infection cycle than the NV replicon."}
