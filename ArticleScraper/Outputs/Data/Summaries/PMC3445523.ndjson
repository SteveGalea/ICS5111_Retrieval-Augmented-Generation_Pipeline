{"summary": "flotillins are highly conserved among species and show a wide expression pattern in various cell and tissue types. flotillins are constitutively associated with certain types of membrane microdomains known as \u201clipid rafts\u201d by means of acylation [4], [5] and oligomerization [7], [7], and do not traverse the membrane but reside on the cytoplasmic side of it. active Raf kinase phosphorylates MEK1/2 on both tyrosine and threonine residues. despite their almost ubiquitous expression, information on regulation of flotillin expression is scarce. overexpression of flotillin-2 in non-tumorigenic melanoma cells results in melanoma progression and formation of metastases [18] because of their ability to modulate the outcome of signaling cascades and to stimulate cell proliferation [15], [18], [25], cell spreading [26] and filopodia formation [27], which are processes important during carcinogenesis and metastasis formation. however, very little information is available on factors that regulate flotillins at cytokine leads to differentiation of progenitor cells into neutrophilic granulocytes in a STAT3-dependent process [30]. in drosophila, flotillin-2 has recently been shown to be transcriptionally regulated upon embryonic wound response [30]. in drosophila, flotillin-2 has recently been shown to be transcriptionally regulated upon embryonic wound response. 100 U/ml Penicillin and 100 g/ml Streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) at 8% CO2 and 37\u00b0C.

PPAR overexpression led to increased promoter activity of flotillin-1. PPAR is a ligand-activated transcription factor. the unstimulated control sample was set as 1. F1-1330 (E) and F2-2130 (F) transfected Hela cells were stimulated with troglitazone for 24 h in serum-free medium. values are mean standard deviation of at least 3 experiments measured in duplicates. RNA was isolated, transcribed into cDNA and flotillin mRNA was measured by qPCR. values are mean standard deviation of at least 3 experiments. chromatin IP (ChIP) assays with antibodies specific for both flotillins. the transcriptional regulation of flotillins is conserved among species. approximately 1000 bp of the murine flotillin-1 and -2 promoters were cloned into pGL3-basic. stimulation with EGF, retinoic acid, PMA, or troglitazone resulted in increased activity of the murine promoters. mutations of the binding sites for the RXR family or Egr1 impair flotillin-2 transcription. the number of the binding sites in human flotillin promoters is too high to be feasible for these studies. we mutated the sites in the mouse flotillin-2 proximal promoter construct. mutagenesis of Egr1 or RXR binding sites prevents transcriptional activation of mouse flotillin-2. the sequence shown in italics was deleted to remove the binding sites. basal activity was highest for the second-longest construct F1-1330. illin-1 promoter activity was found to be highest with the longest construct. Flotillin-2 promoter activity was reduced to about 50% in the shortest construct reaching 560 bp upstream of the ATG.

Flotillin promoter constructs F1-1330 (A, C, E) or F2-2130 (B, D, F) were cotransfected into Hela cells together with expression plasmids for Egr1, SRF, empty PSV control plasmid or with the ERK2 expression constructs. hela cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs for Egr1 or SRF. RNA was isolated, transcribed into cDNA and analyzed by qPCR. computer-based analysis of the two promoters revealed 19 conserved putative transcription factor binding sites. in-2 promoter activity is induced by trans-retinoic acid. PPAR overexpression led to increased promoter activity. PPAR is a ligand-activated transcription factor. Flotillin promoter activity is induced by RXR, RAR, PPAR, and the PPAR activator troglitazone. stimulation with increasing amounts of troglitazone resulted in a dose-dependent activation of both flotillin promoters. hela cells were transfected with expression constructs for RAR, RXR, retinoic acid, and PPAR. RNA was isolated, transcribed into cDNA and flotillin mRNA was measured. genomic region of flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 upstream of the ATG start codon was used for the detection of the precipitated DNA fragment. RXR, RAR, and Egr1 bind to the promoter of both flotillins, while RAR only bound to flotillin-2 promoter. the transcription factors RAR, RXR (Fig. 9C and D), Egr1 (Fig. 9E and F) and SRF (Fig. 9G and H) confirm a species-conserved transcriptional regulation of flotillins by these transcription factors. mutations of binding sites for the RXR family or Egr1 impair flotillin-2 transcription. the RXR binding sites were individually mutated using extension overlap PCR [31], whereas the Egr1 binding sites which are located close to each other were deleted. single mutation of the RXR family binding sites did not abrogate the transcriptional activation of the reporter constructs upon RA stimulation. however, when the mutations of the RXR binding sites 2 and 3 were combined with a deletion in the 3\u2032 region removing the Egr1 binding sites, the transcriptional activation flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 are direct transcriptional targets of growth factor-induced MAPK-signaling, mediated by Egr1 and SRF, and 2) nuclear receptors that dimerize with RXR. flotillin expression is controlled by MAPKs, most likely through Egr1 and SRF activation. flotillin-1 is a novel MAPK scaffolder that is essential for full ERK activation. ERK1/2 dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they bind to and phosphorylate transcription factors such as Elk-1 [39]\u2013[41], c-Myc [42] and c-Fos [43] which then induce the transcription of several target genes. c-Fos, Elk-1, and c-Myc are genes that regulate cell cycle progression. a knockdown of flotillin-1 in HeLa cells resulted in a reduced basal as well as EGF-induced cyclin D1 expression. in general, activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade is associated with increased proliferation, and a dysregulation thereof is a hallmark of many tumors. Egr1 downregulates its own expression [60], resulting in termination of Egr1-regulated gene expression. the potential role of Egr1 in cancer is not fully understood, since Egr1 has been shown to either promote [61] or suppress cell proliferation and/or cancer progression in a cell and tissue specific manner. in-silico analysis of mammalian genomic flotillin-1 and -2 sequences revealed 19 different, species-conserved putative transcription factor families. retinoic acid regulates gene expression by acting as a ligand for the nuclear receptors RAR (all-trans retinoic acid) and RXR (the all-trans retinoic acid metabolite 9-cis retinoic acid) retinoid X receptor RXR is able to control the function of many nuclear receptors. PPAR plays a critical role in adipogenesis and fat storage. drosophila flotillins are most abundantly expressed in the embryonic nervous system [73], suggesting a morphogenic function. flotillin-1 and flotillin-2 knockout mice are viable, fertile, and morphologically normal. phenotypes observed after flotillin depletion or overexpression in cultured cells may not directly reflect the essential nature of flotillins in multicellular organisms. flotillins are extremely well conserved between species that are not closely related. tillins were able to identify flotillins as transcriptional targets of MAPK signaling, mediated by the transcription factors Egr1 and SRF. retinoic acid, RXR, RAR and PPAR exert positive effects on the expression of flotillins."}
