{"summary": "in the united states, more than 3,00,000 patients are admitted and about 20,000 die from acute pancreatitis per year. in the united states, the incidence rate of acute pancreatitis is 0.03% and the mortality rate among severe acute pancreatitis is 16.3%. in the united states, more than 3,00,000 patients are admitted with incident pancreatitis and about 20,000 die from the disease each year. in the united states, more than 3,00,000 patients are admitted with incident pancreatitis and about 20,000 die from the disease each year. two key diagnostic tests for acute pancreatitis involve measuring levels of serum amylase and serum lipase. measurement of serum lipase, however, has a much higher sensitivity (90%) and specificity (90%) for diagnosing acute pancreatitis. the monetary value of each point has been equal to the fixed budget divided by the number of points that all hospitals claim. the degree of cuts in reimbursement was measured based on the quarterly monetary value of each point. the aim of this study was to compare the health service utilization (length of hospital stay), health care expenditures and quality of care. files Approximately, 0.2% of the ambulatory care expenditures, by visit, CD file extracted by systematic sampling method on a monthly basis. 5% of the inpatient expenditures, by admission, DD file extracted by systematic sampling method on a monthly basis. 1 million cases of systemic sampling dataset were used in this study. hemiplegia, moderate or severe renal disease, diabetes with end-organ damage, tumor without metastases, leukemia, or lymphoma. a score of 3 was added when the subjects had co-morbid metastatic solid tumors or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) the NHRI is a nonprofit foundation established by the government. the t-test was used to compare the differences in mean values of length of stay (LOS), diagnostic costs, drug costs, therapy costs, total costs, and 14-day re-admission rate before and after implementation of the global budget system. 5% of inpatient expenditures, by admission, DD file extracted by systematic sampling method on a monthly basis. 5% of inpatient expenditures, by admission, DD file extracted by systematic sampling method on a monthly basis. 1 million cases of systemic sampling dataset were used in this study. a score of 3 was added when the subjects had co-morbid moderate or severe liver disease. a score of 6 was added when the subjects had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) the total score was obtained by adding the relative weight of all co-morbidities. the NHRI is a nonprofit foundation established by the government. the t-test was used to compare the differences in mean values of length of stay (LOS), diagnostic costs, drug costs, therapy costs, total costs, and 14-day re-admission rate before and after implementation of the global budget system. in the pre-budget group, 74% of the subjects were men and in the post-budget group, 75% of the subjects were men. the mean income state index before global budgeting was 1.79 0.05 and that after adoption of the system was 1.74 0.04. there were significant differences in age (P.001), income state index (P =.04), and Charlson Comorbidity Index (P.001) before and after the global budgeting system went into effect. the mean 3-day re-visit rate to the ED decreased from 9.9 0.9% at baseline to 7.2 0.6% after implementation of the global budget system. the mean 14-day re-admission rates before and after the global budget went into effect were 11.6 1.0% and 7.9 0.7%. LOS differed significantly among hospitals in northern Taiwan, central Taiwan, southern Taiwan, Kaoshiung city, and eastern Taiwan. the impact of several independent variables on length of stay in patients with acute pancreatitis (mixed-effects Poisson model) global budgeting did not have a significant impact on drug costs. male gender was associated with significantly lower drug costs than female gender ( = 0.13, P =.03) there was a significantly positive correlation between age and drug costs ( = 0.01, P =.42; = 0.08, P =.14) there was no significant correlation between gender, age, or income state index and therapy costs ( = 0.06, P =.63; = 0.002, P =.76; = 0.009, P =.81). compared with medical centers, there was no significant difference in therapy costs between regional hospitals and local hospitals. compared with hospitals in Taipei city, there was no significant difference in total costs between regional hospitals and local hospitals. there was no significant difference in total costs between hospitals in northern Taiwan, central Taiwan, southern Taiwan, or eastern Taiwan. there was no significant difference in the risk of revisiting the ED within 3 days among hospitals in northern Taiwan, central Taiwan, southern Taiwan, Kaoshiung city, or eastern Taiwan. there was no significant difference in the risk of readmission within 14 days among hospitals in northern Taiwan, central Taiwan, southern Taiwan, Kaoshiung city, and eastern Taiwan. LOS A mixed-effects Poisson model was used for clustered count data analysis. the model was fitted using option IRR (incidence-rate ratio) to obtain exponential estimates. male gender was associated with a significantly shorter LOS than female gender. global budgeting had a significantly positive impact on diagnostic costs. male gender was associated with significantly lower diagnostic costs than female gender. there was no significant correlation between age and diagnostic costs. there was no significant difference in drug costs between regional hospitals and local hospitals ( = 0.08, P =.82;

central Taiwan, southern Taiwan, Kaoshiung city, and eastern Taiwan. the impact of GB, age, sex, income index, Charlson Comorbidity index, accreditation hospital level, and regional level on therapy costs. the impact of GB, age, sex, income index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, accreditation hospital level, and regional level on total costs (loge) using mixed-effects linear model. no significant correlation between age, gender or income state index and risk of revisiting the ED within 3 days. global budgeting had a significantly negative impact on the risk of being readmitted within 14 days. there were no significant correlations between age, gender, income state index and the risk of readmission within 14 days. patients treated in local hospitals were at significantly lower risk of readmission within 14 days than patients treated in medical centers. diagnostic costs, drug costs, therapy costs, and total costs all significantly increased after global budgeting took effect. this represents the increases of 37.1% to 217.7%, significantly exceeding Taiwan's 2.2% growth in consumer price index (CPI) for the same period. the impact of global budgeting on the risk of revisiting the ED within 3 days was not significant. patients treated at local hospitals were at significantly lower risk of readmission within 14 days than patients treated at medical centers. 65% of hospitals are private, some receiving bonuses based on productivity. the major treatment for acute pancreatitis includes supportive care, fluid resuscitation, transfer to intensive care unit and enteral feeding. the launch of global budgets leads to an increase in the quantity of medical services supply to maximize profits. for survival, hospitals must focus on quality of care. length of stay, higher health care expenditures, and better quality of care in patients treated for acute pancreatitis. author contributions Provision of study materials: Ya-Lin Ko, Jyun-Wei Wang, Hui-Mei Hsu, Chia-Hung
