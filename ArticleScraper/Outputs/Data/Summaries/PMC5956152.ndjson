{"summary": "the ability of LAB to elicit an immune response against expressed foreign antigens has led to their use as mucosal vaccine vectors. LAB tend to elicit minimal immune responses against themselves, instead inducing high levels of systemic and mucosal antibodies against the expressed foreign antigen. the text of this review focuses on in vivo immune responses and on selected in vitro studies with a significant immune component.

immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been relegated to the status of being a treatable chronic disease. but infection rates are unacceptably high (10) using lactobacilli as mucosal vaccine vectors can provide enhanced immune response at the typical mucosal sites of infection. several studies have looked at lactobacilli expressing HIV antigens. expressing additional secreted molecules as adjuvants can significantly improve the mucosal (IgA) and systemic (serum IgG) immune responses against HIV proteins (MPER, Gag) in orally dosed mice. there are currently two FDA-approved vaccines against the most common strains of HPV (vaccines Gardasil and Cervarix) both generate protective immune responses via spontaneous virus-like particle formation of the HPV L1 capsid protein (21). only one research group has used Lactobacillus to generate VLPs using the L1 protein, resulting in serum IgG expression following subcutaneous injection in. oral administration improved the response in comparison to the results seen with subcutaneous or intramuscular administration (28, 29). a human trial using cervical cancer (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 [CIN3] patients demonstrated the presence of E7-specific lymphocytes in cervical tissues but not in blood, with the majority of patient tumor pathologies being downgraded. a follow-up study showed that antibody levels and IFN- secretion and proliferation, as well as protection against lethal challenge, lasted 7 months postvaccination. coronaviruses usually infect via the gastrointestinal tract in livestock and the respiratory tract in birds and humans, causing devastating economic losses and dangerous morbidities. atypically studied secretions such as ophthalmic and nasal secretions showed a synergy against the spike protein, but not against the nucleocapsid. a recent set of experiments by Jiang et al. delved deeper into the immune response generated by L. casei. rotavirus is the second leading cause of death in children under the age of 5 worldwide. rotavirus responsible for 40% of hospitalizations due to diarrheal illness (50) it is estimated that rotavirus killed approximately 215,000 children in 2013. aquaculture is an important food supply paradigm, and with it comes the typical pathogen problems that large-scale animal farms encounter. lactobacillus vaccine vectors can provide an effective and easily administered system for pisciculture. the first set of studies targeted infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) classical swine fever virus (CSFV) has been tested in rabbits, mice, and pigs. all tests resulting in production of serum and mucosal antibodies. addition of thymosin -1, a T cell-stimulating peptide, was able to increase levels of IgG, IgA, IFN-, IL-2, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) in pigs. human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been relegated to the status of being a treatable chronic disease. infection rates are unacceptably high (10) an effective HIV vaccine is still elusive via traditional methods, with statistical significance limitations plaguing the only modestly successful clinical trial (11) the application was safe in rhesus macaques and afforded protection against simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) challenge (16\u201318) that group also used lactobacilli for secretion of broadly neutralizing antibody fragments to protect the vaginal mucosa. the work was still performed in vitro (19). a similar study using E6 had similar results (26). a similar study using E6 had similar results (26). a similar study using E6 had similar results (26). vaccinated mice survived lethal challenge (32) similar antibody and T cell results were observed in BALB/c mice. cholera toxin subunit A1 (CTA1) significantly improved antibody levels and protection against lethal challenge. several spike protein epitopes have been targeted (S, 6D), resulting in induction of serum IgG and mucosal IgA in mice. the only human coronavirus addressed was SARS-CoV, with induction of serum IgG and mucosal IgA against spike proteins. some Lactobacillus species have been shown to downregulate IL-17 responses (48) but this simply points to the delicate balance that Th17 cells must strike between pathogen-stimulated inflammation and the potential damage of errant autoimmune inflammation (49). it is clear that homeostasis with respect to inflammation, immunity, lactobacilli, and Th17 cells is a complex subject. first avenue used typical oral vaccination with L. casei, inducing mucosal IgA and neutralizing serum IgG against porcine Rotavirus major protective antigen (PA) VP4 in mice. second used antibody fragments to confer protection. ovirus carpio (spring viremia of carp virus) have also been studied. the two antigens (KHV ORF81 and SVCV glycoprotein) were expressed together in L. plantarum and dosed orally in carp and koi. serum IgM and challenge survival data were promising. foot-and-mouth disease virus, a Picornavirus afflicting cloven-hooved animals, was investigated in a comprehensive dosing study. this study assessed anticapsid immune responses resulting from administration of recombinant L. acidophilus via intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or oral route. the resulting antibody responses were thus much higher via intramuscular and intraperitoneal administration than via mucosal delivery enteric Escherichia coli bacteria are a major cause of diarrheal morbidity and mortality. most experiments mentioned here, except one, have targeted enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) Ferreira et al. were the only group to target enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and attempted the only sublingual dosing regimen. splenocytes secreted elevated levels of IL-6 and IFN-. a final set of experiments failed to induce significant levels of IgA prior to challenge, but the researchers noted that challenge with S. pneumoniae did induce a significant IgA response. authors also identified what has become an interesting theme with lactobacillus vaccinations, i.e., that of dual Th1 and Th2 induction. anti-adhesion serum IgG and intestinal IgA reduced bacterial load and gastric inflammation following challenge (85). antibodies against the -toxoid of Clostridium perfringens were identified in BALB/c mice following oral L. casei administration. enterotoxigenic E. coli bacteria are a major cause of diarrheal morbidity and mortality. most experiments mentioned here, except one, have targeted enterotoxigenic E. coli. Ferreira et al. were the only group to target enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and attempted the only sublingual dosing regimen. splenocytes secreted elevated levels of IL-6 and IFN-. only the results from the sublingual vaccination were reported. a final set of experiments failed to induce significant levels of IgA prior to challenge, but the researchers noted that challenge with S. pneumoniae did induce a significant IgA response. the authors also identified what has become an interesting theme with lactobacillus vaccinations, i.e. that of dual Th1 and Th2 induction. a vaccine targeting Helicobacter pylori, a common cause of stomach ulcers, would be extremely beneficial. a vaccine targeting H. pylori with an L. acidophilus strain reduced bacterial load and gastric inflammation following challenge (85) several studies have explored strategies to express adjuvants such as cytokines, pathogen-associated molecular patterns, toxins, and targeting molecules for M cells and DCs. the route of administration can have an effect on the type of response elicited due to differences in mucosal inductive sites."}
