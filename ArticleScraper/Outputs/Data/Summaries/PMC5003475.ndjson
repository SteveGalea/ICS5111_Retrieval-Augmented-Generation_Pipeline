{"summary": "emergence of genetic tools to explore species differences has had a tremendous impact on our knowledge of global biodiversity. two mitochondrial loci, cyt b (cytochrome b) and COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I), have gained particular prominence in this role. the international barcode of life (IBOL) consortium has adopted COI barcodes as the standard for studies on biodiversity throughout the animal kingdom. rabies virus (RV) is the type species of this genus and the only Lyssavirus known to circulate in the Americas [17] there is a need for tools that discriminate both host species and viral strains. the persistence of RV in chiropteran hosts provides a source of potential cross-species infection for domestic animals. spotted bat (Euderma maculatum), eastern small-footed bat (Myotis leibii) and western small-footed bat (Myotis ciliolabrum) rarely come in contact with humans due to their scarcity and/or their very limited range. the pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus) is also uncommon and very infrequently submitted so the vast majority of submitted specimens represent just 13 species. the study demonstrates the feasibility of this approach as a first step in the development of a novel user-friendly molecular method for bat species identification. Submitted specimens are routinely examined upon arrival at the laboratory and assigned a species designation based on specific morphological keys. a custom database was initially developed that contained 365 American and 685 Canadian bat COI gene sequences obtained from NCBI, Barcode of Life Data Systems and CFIA. sequences were aligned using ClustalXv2 or ClustalXv1.83 [40,41] and then reviewed manually to identify regions that were conserved within a species. 50 mg of brain, lung, spleen, or hair bud were taken from frozen bat specimens for DNA extraction using either of two methods. the sample was ground in a hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada) solution. the final dried DNA pellet was dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA) slot blots were incubated in pre-hybridization buffer (5 SSC, 1% casein, 0.1% N-lauryl sarcosine, 0.02% SDS) for 1 h. blots were washed sequentially in 0.1% SDS containing 2 SSC, 1 SSC and 0.5 SSC at the hybridization temperature. PCR consisted of an initial denaturation step at 94 \u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 45 s, 45 \u00b0C for 45 s, 72 \u00b0C for 1 min, and a final extension step of 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. the 50 L reaction mixture consisted of 2 L of DNA template, 0.2 L of enzyme mix in 5 L 10 reaction buffer, 1.5 L of 50 mM MgCl2, 1 L of 10 probes in 15 L Pronto!TM Epoxide Spotting Solution were spotted in triplicate on Epoxide Slides (Corning) at 60% humidity using the VersArray ChipWriter TM Pro printer (Bio-Rad) and SMP3 pins (ArrayIt, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) following printing, the humidity was increased to 70% overnight and gradually reduced to ambient humidity the following day. Printed slides were stored in a desiccating chamber until use. reactivity was considered positive if it had an MFI greater than the mean MFI of the whole probe set plus two times the standard deviation. Submitted specimens are routinely examined upon arrival at the laboratory and assigned a species designation based on specific morphological keys. 365 american and 685 Canadian bat COI gene sequences obtained from NCBI, Barcode of Life Data Systems and CFIA. sequences were aligned using ClustalXv2 or ClustalXv1.83 [40,41] and then reviewed manually to identify regions that were conserved within a species. a pallid bat probe was designed using the program AlleleID. the final dried DNA pellet was dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA) and stored at 20 \u00b0C. some samples were extracted using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Toronto, ON, Canada) as per manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. blots were washed sequentially in 0.1% SDS containing 2 SSC, 1 SSC and 0.5 SSC at the hybridization temperature. once in Buffer 1 (0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.5) at room temperature. unbound conjugate was removed by washing twice in buffer 1 for 15 min each time. the 50 L reaction mixture consisted of 2 L of DNA template, 0.2 L of enzyme mix in 5 L 10 reaction buffer, 1.5 L of 50 mM MgCl2, 1 L of 10 mM dNTP mixture, and 1 M of each primer. amplicons were visualized either on the Qiagen instrument (Qiagen) or on a 1% agarose gel. Printed slides were blocked by incubation in pre-hybridization buffer (5 SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.1 mg/mL BSA) for 45 min at 42 \u00b0C. the following day, hybridized slides were washed once in 2 SSC, 0.1% SDS, twice in 1 SSC and twice in 0.1 SSC at room temperature. a previous study of the variation of the COI gene in 13 bat species required the use of four separate PCR reactions for successful amplification of the COI gene from all the species. this revealed gaps in the required sequence information. multiple sets of PCR primers flanking the COI gene were designed to amplify the entire COI gene of single specimens for 13 of the 14 targeted Canadian bat species. universal PCR primers designed in this study can successfully replace the four separate PCRs previously used to amplify the partial COI gene of the targeted bat species. the one sample that failed to amplify was badly decomposed and a weak product was only generated after switching to alternate primers that produced a slightly different amplicon of approximately the same size. reduction in amplicon size may improve PCR product yields as described in other studies which used smaller microcodes.

PCR for partial Amplification of the Cytochrome c Oxidase Subunit I (COI) gene of Canadian bats was validated using DNA extracted from 153 Canadian field specimens of the 14 bat species. the PCR was validated using DNA extracted from 153 Canadian field specimens of the 14 bat species. a primer pair developed in this study was used for the PCR. the targeted cytochrome c oxidase subunit I regions of all 14 bat species were successfully amplified.

PCR and microarray assay described can be used to genetically identify Canadian bat specimens to the species level using DNA extracted from small amounts of tissue from bat carcasses. this method could complement traditional taxonomic methods of species assignment especially when specimens are deteriorated, incomplete, or are of species that share highly related morphological features. the present study has used a similar approach to design and validate a tool for a very specific purpose but further development of this technique could enlarge its applicability. the principle could also be extended to the analysis of the much larger number of bat species that inhabit tropical regions of the Americas. the adaptation of this method to novel far less labour intensive microarray platforms could be beneficial. 152 out of 153 bats representing 14 different species of bats have been submitted for rabies diagnosis in Canada. amplification of COI from a highly degraded sample required an alternate primer pair. a microarray-based method for identification of chiropteran specimens to the species level was successfully developed."}
