{"summary": "porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was first detected from pigs with diarrhea in Ohio, USA, in 2014. PDCoV has also been reported in some Asian countries, including south Korea, China, Thailand, and Laos (9\u201312). PDCoVs have often been detected in domestic pigs at swine farms in multiple prefectures since 2014. the data were assembled using Torrent Suite version 5.0. the nearly complete genomic sequence was found to be 25,359 nucleotides (nt) in length, including partial unidentified regions at both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 terminals. no changes in the length of each gene, other than a 3-nt deletion in the ORF1a/1b gene of the U.S. and South Korean PDCoV strains. complete genome of the isolate HKD/JPN/2016 has been deposited in GenBank under the accession no. LC260045."}
