{"summary": "the serological profile for influenza virus in farrow-to-finish pig farms in minas gerais state, brazil. pigs with no SIV vaccination history were selected from four larger pig production areas. influenza virus (SIV) is characterized by fever, inactivity, decreased food intake, respiratory distress, coughing, sneezing, conjunctivitis, and nasal discharge. the disease is characterized by high morbidity and generally low mortality rates. PB1, PB2, PA, HA, NP, and NS from the triple reassortant swine lineage of the swine influenza virus,7 had never before been recognized in swine. Immediately after the spread of H1N1pdm09 in human populations, outbreaks in pigs were reported in many countries worldwide. the objective of this study was to evaluate the serological profile for influenza virus in pigs from farrow-to-finish farms in minas gerais state, brazil. thirty farms (F1 to F30) from the four larger pig production areas in Minas Gerais state were selected for this study. samples were tested for hemagglutination inhibition (HI) activity against the H1N1 pandemic strain (A/swine/Brazil/11/2009) and the H3N2 IAV (A/swine/Iowa/8548-2/98) reference strain. samples with an HI titer 40 were considered positive. a herd was considered positive when at least one of the animals was seropositive. a herd was considered positive when at least one of the animals was seropositive. a herd was centrifuged after clot formation and the serum was stored at 20\u00b0C. samples were tested for hemagglutination inhibition (HI) activity against the H1N1 pandemic strain (A/swine/Brazil/11/2009) and the H3N2 IAV (A/swine/Iowa/8548-2/98) reference strain. the same viruses were used in the back titration in each plate for the HI assay. the percentages of animals with antibodies against H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 SIV were 2623% and 157%, respectively. the percentages of seropositive herds for both viruses were 966% and 132%, respectively. serological profiles from areas 1, 3, and 4 followed a characterized pattern of antibody profiles. some farms had detectable antibody levels throughout all ages. one farm (F8) had no anti-H1N1pdm09 antibodies at all ages. grower pigs in areas 1 and 3 were seronegative for H1N1pdm09 virus. highest values were observed in nursery pigs and grower pigs. one area 1 farm (F6) and two area 3 farms (F21 and F22) had respiratory outbreaks. the detection of anti-influenza antibodies in most of the farms suggests virus circulation. the rates of animals with anti-influenza antibodies were lower than those previously reported for many countries. the prevalence of H1 and H3 subtypes at farrow-to-finish and specialized finishing farms from Netherlands was investigated. at the farrow-to-finish farms, 443% of the animals were seropositive for H1, and 66% of the animals were seropositive for H3.21. some Brazilian studies have also detected anti-influenza antibodies at pig farms. in 2009, a seroprevalence study investigated the prevalence of anti-swine influenza virus antibodies in sows from 17 farrow-to-finish farms in Minas Gerais state. a higher prevalence of antibodies against H3N2 virus was found in a herd from southern Brazil,13 suggesting that there may be differences in the circulating serotypes of influenza virus. highest mean antibody titers and highest number of animals with low and medium titers followed by farrowing crate group. lowest maternally derived antibodies against influenza virus were observed at 3\u20139 weeks of age, suggesting animals are more susceptible later in the production cycle. ive measures, and passive antibodies may interfere in the immune response to vaccination or infection, must be analyzed to improve protection against influenza infection. a few months prior to the sample collection, some farms had outbreaks of respiratory disease in nursery and grower pigs. studies involving serological surveillance for the influenza virus in other regions in Brazil could be useful to provide information about molecular epidemiology of SIV."}
