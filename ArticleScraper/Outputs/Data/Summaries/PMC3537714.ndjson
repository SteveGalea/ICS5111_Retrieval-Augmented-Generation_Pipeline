{"summary": "a protective role of mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolins against CMV disease has been reported after transplantation. the impact in HIV-infected patients is unclear. a case-control study nested within the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. in patients with prolonged immunosuppression, substantial reduction of CMV-specific T-cells is associated with an increased risk for CMV reactivation, progressive replication and disease. the decline of CD4 T-cells below 100 cells/L serves as a surrogate marker for an advanced state of immunosuppression and an increased risk of CMV disease. homo-trimeric protein subunits synthesised in the liver, binds in its oligomeric form to carbohydrates on bacteria, fungi, and viruses [9], [10], [11]. this interaction subsequently was shown to lead to neutralization by deposition of complement C3 and C4 on the virus. this interaction subsequently led to neutralization by deposition of complement C3 and C4 on the virus. MBL levels show only very limited acute phase changes [24], [25], thereby a one-time measurement might be sufficient to determine life-long plasma levels. up to one third of the general population carry genetic polymorphisms associated with functional MBL deficiencies [26], [27]. functional deficiencies of MBL were found to be associated with an increased risk for CMV disease in recipients of solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplants [9], [29], [30], [31], [32], BL (primary exposure variable) and M-ficolin (ficolin-1), L-ficolin (ficolin-2), and H-ficolin (ficolin-3) respectively. two groups of patients were compared: HIV-infected patients with CMV disease (cases), and HIV-infected individuals with CMV antibodies but without CMV disease (controls) patients were not eligible as controls after starting a treatment known to have CMV anti-viral activity. they became eligible again 30 days after discontinuation of the anti-viral treatment. nitis and other end-organ involvement excluded in CDC AIDS defining conditions. definitive CMV retinitis was diagnosed by characteristic ophthalmological appearance, CMV-detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and response to CMV treatment. all assays were performed using an in-house time-resolved immunofluorometric assay. wells were coated with monoclonal anti-M-ficolin, incubated with samples diluted in a high ionic strength buffer with EDTA, heat aggregated human IgG and bovine IgG. a covariate for the interaction between CD4 T-cell count and MBL was added to our model. we calculated CD4 T-cell count strata to separate patients with CD4 T-cell counts below 20 cells/L from those with CD4 T-cell counts above 20 cells/L. we represented MBL by a piecewise linear spline with 2 knots at 100 and 500 ng/mL. informed consent to the enrolment into the SHCS. the study was evaluated through the scientific committee of the SHCS. the availability of DNA was primarily driven by year of consent. vir, entecavir, famciclovir, foscarnet, val/ganciclovir, interferon alpha, peginterferon alpha, ribavirin or telbivudine were eligible again 30 days after discontinuation of the anti-viral treatment. controls were a random sample of all those at risk for CMV disease at the time when the index case was detected. definitive CMV retinitis was diagnosed by characteristic ophthalmological appearance, CMV-detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and response to CMV treatment. in older cases, the code \u201cdefinitive\u201d CMV retinitis is related to previous CDC-definitions that did not require PCR. conditional logistic regression is appropriate to assess association between CMV disease and plasma MBL in a study with matched pairs. 126 cases and their 126 controls a power of 80% could be achieved to detect an odds ratio for CMV disease of 1.4 per standard deviation unit decrease in MBL. Earlier studies, which used MBL in categories rather than on a continuous scale, have suggested a protective role of MBL against CMV disease in transplant recipients [32]. using a piecewise linear spline allows estimation of the association between CMV disease and MBL without assuming a continuous gradient across the entire range of observed MBL levels. excluded cases, with a first episode of CMV disease between March 1985 and November 2009, had on average a shorter duration of HIV-infection, and were more likely to be male with no prior exposure to cART. matched controls included in the study and corresponding plasma samples analysed for MBL and ficolin levels. 4 Herpes simplex disease, mucocutan, disseminated toxoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis retinitis or toxoplasmosis of the brain within 90 days of the index date. cases were predominantly male with a median age of 37 years (interquartile range [IQR] 32\u201344) cases diagnosed with both \"CMV not liver, spleen or lymph nodes\" and \"CMV retinitis\" are counted as the former (n = 2). a first documented positive test (49%, 52%) a first reported positive test (33%, 35%) or the cohort registration visit (18%, 12%). 6 Herpes simplex disease, mucocutan. disseminated toxoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis retinitis or toxoplasmosis of the brain within 90 days of the index date. density plots of mannan-binding lectin levels showed comparable distributions among cases and controls. no association was found between CMV disease and any one of MBL, M-ficolin, L-ficolin, or H-ficolin. there was no evidence that MBL is a more important immunological risk factor for CMV disease in patients with CD4 T-cell counts below 20 cells/L. the estimated ORs were 1.26 per log10 ng/mL (95% CI 0.69\u20132.28) and 0.92 per log10 ng/mL (95%). plasma levels of MBL and all three ficolins appeared stable over the range of past (available in 34 (32%) cases and 50 (48%) controls. prior to the index date, no phase of reduced MBL or ficolin levels was observed. 779 cases of incident CMV disease were documented in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) of these patients, 126 (16%) patients had both a CD4 T-cell count measurement within 90 days of the date of diagnosis. excluded cases, with a first episode of CMV disease between March 1985 and November 2009, had on average a shorter duration of HIV-infection. IQR, interquartile range; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; cART, combination antiretroviral therapy; IRIS, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. 1 Cases diagnosed with both \u201cCMV not liver, spleen or lymph nodes\u201d are counted as the former. 75% of cases were classified as having CDC stage C. cases had on average a shorter duration of HIV-infection and lower CD8 T-cell count compared with their controls. IQR, interquartile range; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; cART, combination antiretroviral therapy; IRIS, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome; MBL, mannan-binding lectin. cases diagnosed with both \u201cCMV not liver, spleen or lymph nodes\u201d and \u201cCMV retinitis\u201d are counted as the former. at the time of first diagnosis of CMV disease the median MBL level for cases was 1,535 ng/mL (IQR 357\u20132,465) median M-ficolin, L-ficolin, and H-ficolin levels were 1,008 ng/mL (IQR 723\u20131,722), 19,248 ng/mL (IQR 14,835\u201326,232) and 36,546 ng/mL (IQR 22,880\u201357,054) respectively. CMV disease was more likely in females (OR 2.13; 95% CI 0.84\u20135.41) and with increasing HIV RNA level (OR 1.53 per log10 copies/mL; 95% CI 1.08\u20132.16) but less likely with increasing duration of HIV-infection (OR 0.91 per year; 95% CI 0.84\u20130.98) the estimated ORs were 1.26 per log10 ng/mL (95% CI 0.69\u20132.28) and 0.92 per log10 ng/mL (95% CI 0.60\u20131.41) for patients with CD4 T-cell counts above and below 20 cells/L respectively. no association was found between CMV disease and MBL either. 105 case-control pairs included in this study. time is relative to the index date, with pre and post disease measurements optional. markers were given in ng/mL on a log10 scale. a large number and high quality of samples available from the multi-center SHCS. the diagnostic criteria for CMV disease, either CMV retinitis or CMV disease at other sites, require detection by PCR. the matching criteria allowed us to control for potential confounders of the adaptive immune response. in other transplant cohorts, either structural haplotype AA had higher rates of CMV disease compared to patients with A/O or O/O. studies showed higher proportions of functional MBL deficiency in transplantation compared to healthy individuals [47], [48], implying selection biases. our study was not designed to assess differences in MBL and ficolin levels. patients with high CMV viremia do show an increased risk for CMV retinitis. a prospective study might address the association between viremia and MBL."}
