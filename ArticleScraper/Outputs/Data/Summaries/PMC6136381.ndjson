{"summary": "bovine coronavirus (BCoV), another host-type of Betacoronavirus 1, is commonly found infecting both the respiratory and enteric tracts of cattle. a suggested bovine-to-human spillover of BCoV resulting in HCoV-OC43 has been proposed around year 1890. a 32kDa accessory protein (ns2) is found in both BCoV and HCoV-OC43. betacoronaviruses have a history of spillover to humans leading to the emergence of pathogens. such a pathogen emergence is limited by ecological and genetic factors. codon usage evolution has a measurable role on the adaptation of viruses to hosts. oV-OC43 (strain 19572, AY903460.1), detected in 2004 in Belgium. eight coronavirus genomes were split into each coding region/mRNA. complete mRNA sequences were retrieved from GenBank. the eight HCoV sequences had their CAIs calculated for each coding region/mRNA using human SFTPA1 and CCK sequences as references in CAI Calculator 2. HCoV-OC43 CAI - BCoV CAI (calculated as mentioned above) for each coding region/mRNA regarding human respiratory and enteric tracts. continuous RSCU values were assigned the binary values 0 (RSCU1) and 1 (RSCU>1). data from both hosts and both HCoV-OC43 and BCoV assembled into a single alignment were used to build an MCMC MCC tree with the simple model. this included estimated frequencies, burn in=10% states, uncorrelated exponential relaxed clock (which showed a lower standard deviation when compared to lognormal clock) sequences were retrieved from GenBank for BCoV (strain BCoV R-AH187, EF424620.1), and HCoV-OC43 (strain 19572, AY903460.1), detected in 2004 in Belgium. further human coronaviruses complete genome sequences included HCoV-HKU1 (KF686341.1), HCoV-NL63 (DQ445911.1), HCoV-229E (JX50 the eight HCoV sequences had their CAIs calculated for each coding region/mRNA using human SFTPA1 and CCK sequences as references in CAI Calculator 2 (Wu et al., 2005) both indicators were plotted in the expected number of codons (ENC)/ expected %GC3 graph (Wright, 1990) codons with RSCU 1 are considered non-preferred, and those with RSCU >1 are preferred. continuous RSCU values were assigned the binary values 0 (RSCU1) and 1 (RSCU>1). data from both hosts and both HCoV-OC43 and BCoV assembled into a single alignment were used. HCoV-OC43 and BCoV CAI upper and lower limits for human coronaviruses were 0.244-0.611 and 0.244-0.472. CAI optimization (CAI>1) was found for nsp2-5, nsp8, nsp15, ns2, HE, S, M, I and N and nsp2, nsp4-6, nsp14, nsp16, nsp16 mRNAs for nsps1-16, ns2 and structural proteins HE, S, E, M, I and N are highly expressed, tissue specific proteins from the enteric and respiratory tracts. negative CAI values indicate viral codon usage optimization, while negative values indicate deoptimization. lowest CAI distance (-0.039) was found for both the human and respiratory and enteric tracts. codon usage selection regimes All Nc x %GC3 plots were found either above or below the expected curve for all HCoV-OC43 and BCoV coding regions/mRNAs and for human and bovine CCK and SFTPA1. observed (dots) and expected (curve) effective number of codons (Nc and ENC, respectively, on the Y axis and %GC3 on the X axis for BC a second split was found for this minor cluster containing both hosts and coronaviruses codon usage statuses. for this last one a third split event led to CCK and HCoV-OC43/ BCoV I exclusive clusters. the RSCU distance of human and bovine CCK and SFTPA1 mRNAs was 0.136 and 0.221, respectively. seven human coronaviruses included in this study in human respiratory and enteric tracts were 0.244-0.611. CAI optimization (CAI>1) was found for nsp2-5, nsp8, nsp11, nsp15, ns2, HE, S, M, I and N and nsp2, nsp4-6, nsp11, nsp14, nsp16, nsp16 negative CAI values indicate viral codon usage optimization. lowest distance from HCoVs lower CAI limit for both HCoV-OC43 and BCoV. lowest CAI distance (-0.039) was found for both human and respiratory and enteric tracts. highest CAI distance for lower human coronaviruses CAI was found for both the human and respiratory and enteric tracts. %GC3 on the X axis for BCoV and HCoV-OC43 coding regions/mRNAs for nsps1-16, ns2 and structural proteins HE, S, E, M, I and N. the two closest dots to bovine and human SFTPA1 dots represent the internal I protein of BCoV (upper) and HCoV-OC43 (lower) and SFTPA1 (left and right lower arrowheads, a third split event (node C, 95%HPD 2.04E5-3.54E6) led to CCK and HCoV-OC43/ BCoV I exclusive clusters. the RSCU distance of human and bovine CCK and SFTPA1 mRNAs was 0.136 and 0.221 respectively. coronaviruses non-structural proteins of the replicase class can process ORF1 polyprotein and release from it all subunits. the analysis of coronaviruses non-structural proteins allows deep phylogenies to be estimated. a lower CAI might lead to lower protein synthesis and consequently lower exposure to the immune system. the upper limit (2.44E5) is related to a time compatible with early humans. this time span overlaps with the one found for node B (95% HPD 2.07E5-1.55E8), meaning that the first ancestor host/ ancestor betacoronavirus contact might have been stable for circa 150 million years before reaching early humans. all coding regions/mRNAs from an ancestor coronavirus experienced optimization or deoptimization, as suggested in Figure 1. this process of codon usage evolution resulted in CAIs approaching the CAI limits for human coronaviruses. nsp14 is a coronavirus 3\u2019-5\u2019 exonuclease. codon usage studies only allow speculations after virus attachment and entry. the full set of interspecies jumps for the HCoV-OC43 ancestors has not been assessed. the focus was the proposed recent bovine-to-human spillover."}
