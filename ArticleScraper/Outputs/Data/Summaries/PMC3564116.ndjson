{"summary": "there are eight RNA segments in the influenza A virus encoding 14 viral proteins. the polymerase proteins (PB1, PB2, PA) [1,2], nucleocapsid protein (NP), hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), matrix proteins (M1 and M2), nonstructural proteins (NS1 and NS2) and the recently described PB1-F2, PB1 N40, PA-X and M42 proteins [1,2, pressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA) and the CsA-CypA complex interact with and inhibit calcineurin, a calcium-calmodulin-activated serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase [22], which suppresses T-cell activation. extracellular CypA acts as a growth factor in several cell types. CypA is encoded by the peptidyl prolyl isomerase A (PPIA) gene. regulatory PPIA polymorphisms are a component of genetic susceptibility to HIV-1 infection or disease progression. interaction of CypA and capsid protein (CA) in newly infected human target cells usually aids viral infectivity. in HBsAg-expressing cell lines, expression level of CypA is lower than controls. more CypA is secreted into the supernatant via the vesicular secretion pathway. During VV infection, CypA stability is increased. M1 is phosphorylated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) downstream of the Ras-activated factor (Raf)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) pathway. the cellular receptor of activated C kinase (RACK) 1 may also interact with M1. heat shock cognate (Hsc) 70 interacts with M1 protein, causing vRNP complexes to accumulate in the nucleus a cell line depleted of endogenous CypA was constructed to understand the precise functions of CypA in the influenza virus lifecycle. further studies indicate that CypA regulates influenza virus replication at the post-transcriptional level. however, CypA does not impair the nuclear export of viral mRNA. the well-known immunosuppressive drug CsA inhibits influenza virus replication through CypA-dependent and -independent pathways. in detail, CsA inhibits influenza virus replication at a post-transcriptional level and impairs the nuclear export of viral mRNA in the absence of CypA. Whether CypA mediates host antiviral defenses during influenza virus infection is an interesting question and requires further study. Whether CypA mediates host antiviral defenses during influenza virus infection is an interesting question and requires further study. extracellular CypA is secreted into the extracellular space. the function of extracellular CypA during influenza virus replication deserves further study."}
