{"summary": "introduction duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene (DMD), most commonly frame-shifting deletions of one or more exons. the milder allelic condition, Becker muscular dystrophy, is also caused by dystrophin mutations, but these are typically in-frame deletions that allow synthesis of internally truncated dystrophin isoforms that retain partial function. splice motif disruption prevents proper exon selection or results in the use of cryptic splice sites that cause partial exon loss or intron retention. deep intronic mutations activate pseudoexon inclusion in the mature gene transcript. splice-switching antisense oligomers (AO) by-pass two donor splice site mutations, one involving exon 16 (DMD-16ss) and the other impacting upon exon 45 processing (DMD-45ss) one mutation responded to single exon skipping while the other required dual exon skipping to overcome the disease-causing mutation. oligomer sequences targeting exon 16 for removal were reported previously. the exon 44, 45, and 46 oligomer sequences are shown in Table 1. the use of human tissue in this study has been approved by the University of Western Australia Human Ethics Committee. fibroblasts were converted to myoblasts through forced myogenesis. fibroblasts were cultured until 80% confluent, washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), detached with 0.25% Trypsin (w/v) PCR 2OMe AOs were transfected as cationic lipoplexes with Lipofectamine 2000\u00ae (1:1 w/w) in Opti-MEM media. RNA was extracted and RT-PCR undertaken using 100 ng of total RNA as template for primary amplification. after 30 cycles (myoblasts) and 35 cycles (MyoD converted fibroblasts) a 1 L aliquot was removed and subjected to nested PCR exon 47 R TTATCCACTGGAGATTTGTCTG Exon 69 Fo GCAAAAGGCCATAAAATGCAC Exon 75 Ro ACGGCAGTGGGGGGCCTTT Exon 69 Fi CCCATGGGGGGGGGGGGCCTTT Exon 75 Ri TGTTCGTGCTCTTTAGAC Exon 13 F CACGCAACTGCTGCTTTTAGAC Exon 15 F GATGCAGTGAAGATTCAC Intron 16 R TCTCTGAG western analysis of dystrophin expression DMD16-ss cells was transfected with oligomer sequences targeting the exon 16 acceptor splice site. electrophoresis and western blotting were performed using NCL-DYS2 (Novocastra Laboratories, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, U.K.) images were captured on a Vilber Lourmat Chemi-Smart 3000 system. oligomers to the most amenable sites were prepared and supplied by Sarepta Therapeutics (Bothell, WA) as phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers conjugated to a cell penetrating peptide (PPMO-k) (RXR)4XB, where B = -alanine; R = l-arginine; X = 6-aminohexanoic acid) cells from the patient DMD-16ss, carrying the exon 16 donor splice site were obtained from a muscle biopsy. dermal fibroblasts were prepared from a skin biopsy from the patient (DMD-45ss) with an exon 45 splice site mutation. fibroblasts were converted to myoblasts through forced myogenesis. RNA extraction and nested RT-PCR 2OMe AOs were transfected as cationic lipoplexes with Lipofectamine 2000\u00ae (1:1 w/w) PPMO-k was transfected into the cells, at concentrations indicated. after incubation as specified, RNA was extracted and RT-PCR undertaken using 100 ng of total RNA. agarose gel analysis, imaging, and sequencing were fractionated on 2% agarose gels in TAE buffer and relative exon skipping efficiency estimated by densitometry of the full-length and oligomer-induced PCR products. agarose gel analysis, imaging, and sequencing were fractionated on images captured by the Chemi-Smart. the identities of induced transcripts were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. western analysis of dystrophin expression DMD16-ss cells were transfected with oligomer sequences targeting the exon 16 acceptor splice site. western analysis of dystrophin expression DMD16-ss cells were transfected with oligomer sequences targeting the exon 16 acceptor splice site. site scores were determined using the algorithm http://rulai.cshl.edu/new_alt_exon_db2/HTML/score.html that predicts the maximum 5' donor score as 12.6, with the average score of constitutive exons being 8.1. the normal exon 16 donor splice site score of 8.0 is average, while the exon 16 donor splice site mutation lowered the value to 2.7. RT-PCR across exons 12\u201317 (DMD-16ss) produced either no signal or sporadic amplicons of various lengths. amplification across exons 41 to 47 (DMD-45ss) resulted in no product. dystrophin mRNA was either absent, or present at extremely low levels. intron 16 was retained in the transcript. RT-PCR across dystrophin exons 1\u20137 (A) and 69\u201375 (B) on four separate RNA preparations from patient DMD-16ss. dystrophin transcripts missing exon 16 were readily detected at all but the lowest transfection concentrations. the shorter amplicon was previously reported as having arisen from spontaneous skipping of exons 14, 15 and 16. the larger amplicon (700 bp) is a revertant transcript missing exons 14\u201316. protein extracts from normal cells and oligomer-treated and untreated DMD-16ss cells were analyzed by western blotting. the 2OMe AO was transfected as a cationic lipoplex at 400 nmol/L and PPMO-k was added directly at 2 mol/L. the cells were incubated for 7 days. the excision of exon 45 alone disrupts the dystrophin reading frame. it was necessary to excise either exons 44 and 45 or exons 45 and 46 from the mature mRNA to allow translation of a BMD-like dystrophin isoform. double exon skipping of 44 and 45 and exons 45 and 46 appeared similarly efficient. single exon excision did not generate detectable transcripts in the patient cells. inability to amplify products from DMD-45ss RNA appears to be due to the retention of intron 45 (36.1kb) in the patient dystrophin mRNA, resulting in a transcript target size that would preclude RT-PCR amplification. RT-PCR from exon 43 to intron 45 to detect dystrophin transcripts retaining intron 45. the size of the amplicon expected from retention of intron 45 is indicated (1159 bp) the forced myogenesis of dermal fibroblasts induces sufficient dystrophin expression to permit RNA studies. however, in this case, the myogenic capacity of the myoD transduced DMD-45ss patient cells was not adequate for dystrophin detection. dystrophin transcripts missing exon 16 were readily detected at all but the lowest transfection concentrations. a amplicon of near-normal length, detected in RNA extracted from untreated cells, was generated sporadically. an amplicon of near-normal length, detected in RNA extracted from untreated cells was generated sporadically. the oligomer-induced amplicon missing exon 16 is 536 bp. the smaller product (326 bp) is a revertant transcript missing exons 14\u201316. the larger amplicon is present in all samples. the 2OMe AO was transfected as a cationic lipoplex at 400 nmol/L. PPMO-k was added directly at 2 mol/L. the cells were incubated for 7 days. RT-PCR across regions of the DMD-45ss dystrophin transcript. excision of exon 45 alone disrupts the dystrophin reading frame. single and dual oligomer preparations targeting exons 44 and 45 were transfected into normal myogenic cells. double exon skipping of 44 and 45 and exons 45 and 46 appeared similarly efficient. inability to amplify products from DMD-45ss RNA appears to be due to the retention of intron 45 (36.1kb) in the patient dystrophin mRNA. exon 45 and 46 exclusion was efficiently induced at all concentrations from 5 nmol/L and above. exon 44 and 45 skipping appeared less effective, reflected by the amount of induced transcript and the presence of intermediate products in cells transfected with 2OMeAOs at 10 nmol/ antisense oligomer-mediated exon skipping to reframe the dystrophin gene transcript is showing great promise as a potential therapy to overcome DMD-causing mutations. dystrophin expression has been reported after systemic administration of splice-switching oligomers, of two different chemistries, in DMD patients. but targeted exon skipping strategies must be tailored to the mutation, and may have to be personalized for some individuals. estimate suggested 15% of all human point mutations result in aberrant splicing. this is now recognized as an underestimation for some genes. most common consequence of mutations affecting authentic splice sites is skipping of one or more exons followed by aberrant donor or acceptor splice activation. harp et al. 1992: omission of exon 7 from the mature dystrophin transcript. disruption of the reading frame can be restored by exclusion of exons 6 and 8. RT-PCR across the gene lesions failed to yield reproducible amplicons. tron 16 and a reverse primer targeting exon 20 also generated a product of the anticipated size if intron 16 was retained within the mature mRNA. the smaller product detected most frequently in this study was identified by DNA sequencing, and is presumed to have arisen from endogenous skipping of exons 14, 15 and 16. amplicon representing dystrophin transcripts missing exon 16 only was sporadic. this is consistent with retention of intron 16 in the majority of the transcripts. titration showed a clear dose response between 0.8 and 25 nmol/L. but this was not observed in the patient cells. despite the rare, perhaps unique nature of the mutation reported here, this patient could be considered an excellent candidate for personalized exon skipping. the loss of exon 16 does not appear to compromise dystrophin function. exon 45 is within the high priority dystrophin target region for induced exon skipping. oligomers targeting exons 44 or 46 had no detectable splice-switching effect. the splice-switching AO H45A(03 + 22) induced robust exon 45 skipping in normal cells at 50\u2013100 nmol/L. exon 45 and 46 skipping appeared to be the more effective strategy. addressing the exon 16 splice mutation necessitated removal of two exons and the associated introns. addressing the exon 45 splice mutation necessitated removal of two exons and the associated introns. two possibilities could account for variable dual exon skipping efficiencies. 44 and 45 or 45 and 46 were effectively induced, with a clear threshold effect evident. we suggest it is likely that exon skipping strategies will need to be individualized for many of the nondeletion DMD cases."}
