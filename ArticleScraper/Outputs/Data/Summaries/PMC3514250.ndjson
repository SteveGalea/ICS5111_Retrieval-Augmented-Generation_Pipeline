{"summary": "population of un-owned cats and cats passing through rescue shelters may be subject to compromised welfare and increased susceptibility to disease. a sampling frame was constructed by searching the databases of publicly registered charities for England, Scotland and Wales. overall, 2,352 contacts for 1,380 organisations were identified. 121,693 stray dogs were collected by local authorities in 2010. a quarter of these dogs were transferred to private shelter organisations. a small number of shelter organisations publish their own figures. uncontrolled reproduction appears to be a likely contributing factor, at least for cats. in one study in the uk, 4.4% and 3.8% of dog- and cat-owning households relinquished a pet to a shelter in the previous year [10] there appears to be correlation with the owner\u2019s lifestyle, education and expectations of owning pet. the aims of this study were to create a complete sampling frame of cat and dog shelter organisations within the UK. a census of the population of un-owned animals administered by these organisations was carried out. further organisations were identified using a combination of animal welfare websites. these were initially identified via Google using search terms including \u201cdog\u201d, \u201ccat\u201d, \u201canimal\u201d, \u201crescue\u201d and \u201cshelter\u201d in various permutations. questionnaire was designed using an automated reading software programme. all mailings for the actual study were sent between March and October 2011. a first reminder letter was sent to non-responders 5\u201312 weeks after the initial mailing. a second reminder letter was sent, with another copy of the questionnaire and a prepaid return envelope. an initial search was made using national registers of charitable organisations. for Scotland, the online records of the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator were searched. for northern Ireland, no comparable register was available at the time of the study. questionnaire was designed using an automated reading software programme. participants provided the names of other web directories, organisations and individuals known to them. questionnaire was pilot-tested between September and November 2010 by individuals with a variety of roles within animal welfare organisations. all organisations that had not responded by 12 weeks after the 2nd reminder were classed as non-respondents. respondents were asked to describe: scope of activities of their organisation; numbers of cats and dogs cared for; the origins of these animals and outcomes of their stay. organisation was found in more than one location, it was attributed to the site it was first found. 7 hundred and thirty-five unique responses were received. data from 203 branches was excluded from the analysis. the total number of animals cared for in 2010 was 89,571 dogs and 156,826 cats. the median number cared for by each organisation per year was 33 for dogs (IQR 6\u2013103), and 93 (IQR 31\u2013215) for cats. for dogs, data were available from 301 organisations representing 101617/156826 (64.8 %) of the cats in the study. most common outcome for cats and dogs was being rehomed, with 75% of dogs and 77.1% of cats finding new owners. 059 (10.4) 1 0-3.5 12,989 (13.2) Released (e.g. ferals) not applicable 0 0-2 3,512 (3.6) Died 0 0-0 154 (0.2) 0 0-1 561 (0.6) Other 0 0-0 131 (0.1) 0 0-0 202 (0.2) breed rescues differed substantially from other rescues. dataset n = 536;

[4] it is possible this represents a genuine increase in euthanasia, with the present study capturing different respondents. a relatively small proportion of the animals entered shelters from sources other than straying and relinquishment. some organisations transfer animals between themselves, although the small numbers involved suggest that this is not common. behavioural problems are a significant risk factor for both initial and re-relinquishment. a total of \u00a3340 million was spent on the care of un-owned animals by 519 charities. a large number of man-hours and a substantial financial sum are spent on un-owned animals in the UK. there is currently no statutory licensing requirement for any \u2018shelter\u2019 organisation in the UK. despite substantial amounts of manpower and money, there is still a continual flow of animals out of ownership and into the guardianship of rescues and shelters. it is clear that further understanding of the reasons for this flow is vital if we are to prevent this continued cycle of over-production and relinquishment. the centre for evidence-based veterinary medicine is supported by an unrestrictive grant from Novartis animal health and The University of Nottingham."}
