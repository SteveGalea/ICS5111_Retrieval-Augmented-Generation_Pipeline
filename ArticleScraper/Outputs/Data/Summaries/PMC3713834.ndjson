{"summary": "the demand for hardwood, firewood, wood pulp, agricultural and grazing land, living space, roads, minerals, and power has had an enormous effect on the ecosystems of the region. net forest losses continue, however, in Myanmar, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Papua new Guinea. the rate of land-use change in much of the region has probably peaked. over the last decade, china has increased agricultural output despite a slight decrease in total agricultural land area. this intensification is driven largely by demographic pressures, which are predicted to result in a 70% increase in food production by 2050. the per capita consumption of meat in developing countries has tripled since the early 1960s. east and Southeast Asia are home to 569 million pigs (60% of the world pig population) and 9.2 billion poultry (43% of the world poultry population) pork consumption in china will increase by 55% between 2000 and 2030. this practice has a demonstrable effect on the emergence and prevalence of potentially clinically relevant resistant microorganisms in food animals. the subsequent excretion of antimicrobial drugs into the environment may subject environmental bacteria to antimicrobial selection pressures. it is clear that the continued use of non-therapeutic antimicrobial drugs in livestock and aquaculture industries poses a threat to human and animal health. zoonotic pathogens remain popular in East and Southeast Asia as traditional medicines, tonics, food delicacies, or symbols of wealth. Asia continues to host the largest illegal wildlife trade in the world (26) exports from africa to Asia increased 20% from 2003 to 2008. cities are key in the epidemiology of many infectious diseases. they can function as \u201cpace-makers\u201d that drive temporal and spatial transmission dynamics of local epidemiology (e.g., dengue), hubs for national and global spread (e.g., SARS and HIV) a high level of antimicrobial resistance is a marker of the failure to control access to antimicrobial drugs and to influence prescribing behaviors. the supply- and demand-side incentives for inappropriate antimicrobial drug use will lead to a region awash with antimicrobial drugs. the potential for public health disasters, such as artemisinin resistance, threatens global malaria control. the WHO Western Pacific Region was the only WHO region that showed a statistically significant improvement in both areas. the attribute score is the percentage of attributes in which moderate or strong technical capacity has been attained in each core capacity area. there have been more international meetings about influenza A(H5N1) virus than human cases of the disease. a benefit of the many meetings held after the outbreaks of SARS and influenza A(H5N1) virus has been a strengthening of regional and international professional partnerships. ing Diseases was revised and re-endorsed by the WHO Regional Committees in 2010. this plan provides a common framework for strengthening national and regional surveillance and response capacity for emerging infectious diseases in the 48 countries of the Asia Pacific Region. es geographic heterogeneity; interaction of different drivers of pathogen evolution, crossover, and dispersion; dynamic systems and uncertainty inherent in such assessments. the capacity to predict and identify biologic threats does not stagnate as the memory of SARS fades."}
