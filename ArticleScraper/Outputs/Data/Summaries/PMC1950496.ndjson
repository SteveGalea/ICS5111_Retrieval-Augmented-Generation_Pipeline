{"summary": "RT-PCR-based detection and identification of viruses assumes a known, relatively stable genome. high mutation rates may lead to extensive changes in viral nucleic acid sequences making dedicated PCR primer use problematic. there is a great need for the development of rapid and universal virus detection and identification technologies. the recombined virus caused 60% mortality in 2 strains of mice. the wild type virus caused no death. a credible bioterrorism scenario might entail the release of such a recombined virus. the ability to recombine \"non-pathogenic\" viruses in vitro introduces the potential for de novo pathogenicity but also for enhanced stealth. there is a great need for the development of techniques that enable the universal amplification of viral nucleic acids. cloning of the norwalk agent genome from stool and Hepatitis G virus from plasma has not found great utility in the direct discovery or identification of novel viruses. however, recent studies indicate that DNAse treatment of serum samples can degrade most of the host genomic DNA but not affect viral nucleic acids, which are protected by stable capsids. human plasma was inoculated with 1 l of an Adenovirus Type 17 suspension, filtered and incubated for 2 hrs with either 10 u DNAse or 5 u RNAse as indicated. filtration, DNAse and RNAse treatment increases efficiency of amplification of Adenovirus Type 17 DNA. this combined treatment eliminates amplification of genomic -actin (upper band) and -actin cDNA (lower band) mp UltrasSens Virus Kit subjected to 1st strand cDNA synthesis and 50 cycles PCR using primers specific for either Adenovirus Type 17 or human -Actin DNA (upper band; primers cross an intron) or cDNA (lower band). amplicons were visualized on an ethidium bromide impregnated agarose gel. primers consisting of the sequence 5'-NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN-3' did not enable the production of discrete or clonable PCR amplicons. we then examined the ability of the V8AA primers to PCR amplify the plasmid, pBabe, and found that we could amplify as little as 100 fg. in the un-inoculated plasma samples, we were unable to clone and sequence the amplicons. in subsequent experiments we have had variable success obtaining random multiplex PCR amplification from human plasma. however, when we shot-gun cloned the DNA amplified from the Adenovirus 17-inoculated human plasma, we obtained 12 recombined vector clones. randomly amplified DNA from Adenovirus 17-infected plasma was shot-gun ligated into pCR 2.1-TOPO and competent E. coli were transformed. Resultant colonies were screened for the presence of recombinant plasmid DNA (A) and plasmid DNA from positive colonies was then purified and sequenced (B) the stock solution of Adenovirus Type 17 contained 1 107 genome equivalents/ml. we inoculated human plasma with the RNA virus Coxsackievirus A7 (CSV A7). then filtered, treated with DNAse and RNAse, purified the remaining nucleic acids and conducted (RT)-PCR using two commercially available reverse transcriptases. lastN alignment searches of the NCBI Non-Redundant database. we were surprised that the cloned DNA from Coxsackievirus A7 aligned with the known sequence for Coxsackievirus A16. therefore, we had amplified portions of the Coxsackievirus A7 genome that had not previously been sequenced. we also inoculated human plasma with Respiratory Syncytial Virus B. 1 ml of human plasma was inoculated with 5 l of suspended Coxsackie Virus A7 (ATCC), filtered and incubated for 2 hours with nucleases. cDNA was purified, amplified and sequenced as described in the Methods section. recombinant plasmid #7 was aligned to all sequence data in the Non-Redundant NCBI Database using the NCBI Nucleotide-Nucleotide BLAST (blastn) Search Algorithm (version 2.2.8) filtration and nuclease treatment improves Viral DNA Amplification by Removing Host DNA and mRNA. the combination of DNAse and RNAse completely eliminates -actin mRNA. we postulate that this finding may be related to the protection of RNA species by DNA:RNA hybrids. primers within this mixture will bind every 200\u2013500 bp in both orientations in the 19 viral genomes that were examined. we found that this mixture enabled a continuum of discrete PCR products to be amplified from 4 different circular DNA plasmids. however, primers consisting of the sequence 5'-NNNNNNNNNN-3' did not enable the production of discrete or clonable PCR amplicons. 5'-VVVVVVVVVVVAA-3' primers allow for random multiplex amplification of DNA from human plasma inoculated with Adenovirus Type 17. the plasma was then filtered (220 nm filter) and incubated for 2 hours with nucleases. PCR amplified discrete PCR products in the un-inoculated plasma. e/RNAse treatment and V8AAmer Random Multiplex PCR allows for the detection and identification of Adenovirus Type 17 without using any virus-specific reagents such as primers, antibodies or microarray chips. 1 ml of human plasma was inoculated with 0\u20135 l of suspended Adenovirus Type 17 (ATCC), filtered and incubated for 2 hours with nucleases. the suspension of Adenovirus Type 17 received from the ATCC had not been quantified and the sensitivity of the random multiplex PCR method thus was uncertain. we then subjected the ATCC Adenovirus Type 17 suspension to real-time PCR using the same Adenovirus Type 17-specific primers and found that we could readily detect the genomic DNA. based on the real-time PCR generated from the known concentrations of Adenovirus Type 17 genomic template, we determined that the stock solution cleic acids and conducted (RT)-PCR using two commercially available reverse transcriptases (Omniscript and SuperScript II) and CSV A7 specific primers separated by either 200 bp or 1.4 Kb. whereas Omniscript RT was more efficient at amplifying 200 bp cDNA species, SuperScript II RT was more efficient at amplifying 1.4 Kb fragments. we cloned the amplification products and found that the amplified real-time PCR was conducted using 109 to 101 genome equivalents/ml as template. the indicated genome equivalents of Adenovirus Type 17 were added to 1 ml of human plasma. total nucleic acids then were purified, amplified by random multiplex PCR (50 cycles) and sequenced as described in the Methods section. the same samples were then subjected to random multiplex PCR with 5'-VVVVVVVVVAA-5' primers as detailed in the Methods section. amplicons were visualized on an ethidium bromide impregnated agarose gel. cDNA from coxsackie Virus A7-infected plasma was shot-gun ligated into pCR 2.1-TOPO. unique PCR products in infected cell preparation were cloned and sequenced. 57% homology was found with bovine Coronavirus[13,14]. RT-PCR of hundreds of infected clinical specimens, using primers specific for the novel virus, confirmed the identification. our long-term goal is to provide emergency room and primary care physicians with the ability to universally detect viruses in human plasma. a second application of this technique involves identification of previously undescribed \u2013 but naturally occurring \u2013 viruses in patients suffering with idiopathic disease states of possible viral etiology.
