{"summary": "in the intervening 30 years, the inability to create an effective protective or therapeutic vaccine can be attributed to a number of characteristics of HIV. molecular mimicry, whereby the expression of proteins structurally similar to host defense proteins, can lead to viral persistence [6\u20139]. nonneutralizing antibodies (non-nAbs) are most effective when directed against highly conserved and functionally critical epitopes. if produced in sufficient abundance, non-nAbs may provide a basis for viral escape from the bnAbs [45\u201348]. non-nAbs that bind to epitopes of HA may interfere with binding of nAbs to proximal neutralization epitopes. a cocktail of nmAbs binding to different epitopes may be a valid clinical approach. a cocktail approach to passive immunotherapy for HIV will need to involve highly crossneutralizing mAbs. this immune memory is essentially a quick response capability that avoids the slower process of the original immune reaction that ultimately gives rise to affinity maturation. with memory, the antibody repertoire can be brought to bear in a matter of days, rather than weeks and months [65\u201368]. this susceptibility has to do with the characteristics of the initial immune response and the subsequent inability of the memory response. ADE has been the leading theory to explain the observation of increased risk of severe disease upon a secondary infection from a heterologous serotype. recent studies in humans have called into question ADE as the principal mechanism of increased disease risk. modifications to antibody Fc regions that disrupt antibody interaction with Fc receptors have been shown to be effective strategies in preventing ADE-mediated lethal disease. suppression of the 1F7-bearing population can allow for a higher titre of Abs capable of neutralizing the autologous contemporaneous viruses. some evidence suggests that bnAbs can develop within the 1F7 repertoire. some potential methods for avoiding OAS have been described. anti-influenza mAbs with broad-range neutralization activity are generally able to interfere with the viral fusion process in the endosomic vesicle by targeting conserved epitopes at that site. these bnMAbs are poorly induced by infection or vaccination as is the case with HIV and other viral infections. only about 20% of infected individuals mount an immune response that contains bnAbs.

[112] employed a recombination target site for integration of each individual mAb into the same genomic site. the cell culture system obviates the need for uniform genetic integration events since no genomic integration is involved in generating the antibody producing cells. transient expression technology has proved versatile, but capable of rapid, high-yielding production of a variety of proteins. it is exceptional in biopharmaceutical manufacturing, and to date all have been similar to those produced in mammalian cell culture when analyzed by a variety of in vitro and in vivo assays. a transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana line with xylosyltransferase and fucosyltransferase activity effectively knockedout has been frequently used. glycans in the double-knockout are more homogeneous than current FDA-approved mAbs produced in mammalian cell culture. lineation based on neutralization fingerprints for screening sera or characterizing antibody specificities induced upon infection or vaccination. new scalable production systems as well as favorable regulatory environment may enable multi-mAb products to be commercialized."}
