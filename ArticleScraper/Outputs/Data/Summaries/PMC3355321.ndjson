RESULTS DON induces rRNA cleavage in RAW 264.7 macrophages. the x-axis indicates the size of the fragments in nucleotide (nts) and the y-axis indicates the relative peak intensity in fluorescence units (FU). the two major peaks represent 18S rRNA (2000 nts) and 28S rRNA (4000 nts). Arrows designate three significant cleavage peaks between 28S and 18S rRNA. 28S rRNA were cleaved into one of two pairs of fragments. a + e (approximately 5000 nts) and b + d (approximately 4700 nts) because no complementary fragment (approximately 2000 nts) to fragment c was detected, it was likely to be a product of the subsequent degradation of a or b. three probes complementary to 18S rRNA were hybridized to RNAs from RAW 264.7 cells treated with vehicle or DON (1000 ng/ml) for 6 h. Arrows indicate fragments from 18S rRNA identified by Northern blot analysis and their corresponding sizes (nts) ND indicates nondetectable. Asterisk indicates statistically significant differences in cell apoptosis as compared with control (p 0.05). annexin V/PI was used to compare apoptosis in control and DON-treated adherent cells and total cells. cells were preincubated with (A) C-16 (0.1 or 0.3 M), (B) PP1 (5 or 25 M), (C) SB 203580 (1 or 5 M), (D) pifithrin- (80 or 100 M), (E) pifithrin- (10 or 25 M), or (F) Z-VAD-FMK (50 or 100 M) for 1 h and then with DON (1000 ng/ml) for 6 h. the presence of cleaved caspases 8, 9 and 3 was determined by Western blot analysis. rRNAs were purified and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. results are representative of three separate experiments. cells were incubated with SG and anisomycin, which can freely diffuse through cell membrane and ricin, a RIP. ricin possesses inherent RNA N-glycosidase activity to depurinate RNA. ribotoxins may share conserved pathway for mediating rRNA cleavage. Cleavage at 6 h was concentration dependent with 200 ng/ml of DON. incubation with DON at 1000 ng/ml for 6 h was uniformly employed. RNAs were purified and analyzed either (A) on 1.2% formaldehyde denaturing agarose gel (10 g) or (B and C) by capillary electrophoresis. DON induces Cleavage of both 28S and 18S rRNA Northern blot analyses using 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes. incubation with five probes complementary to 28S rRNA revealed six fragments (a\u2013f) based on rRNA fragment sizes, probe position and Northern blotting, putative cleavage sites of 28S rRNA were deduced. three probes complementary to 18S rRNA were hybridized to RNAs from RAW 264.7 cells treated with vehicle or DON (1000 ng/ml) for 6 h. the putative 18S rRNA cleavage pattern suggested that fragments A (approximately 1000 nts) and B (approximately 800 nts) are derived from intact 18S rRNA. the remaining fragments (C, D, and E, approximately 600 both adherent and total populations contained markedly higher annexin V-positive cells (early apoptotic) than the control total cells (31%). annexin V/PI-double positive cells (late apoptotic) were much higher in adherent (4.8%) and total (10.8%) populations than that of the control (1.2%) PKR, Hck, p38, p53, and caspases were key upstream elements for rRNA cleavage in RAW 264.7 cells. p38 mediates sequential activation of p53 and caspase 3 to induce apoptosis. rRNAs were purified and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. p53-dependent transactivation of p53-responsive genes and apoptosis. caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK also caused concentration-dependent inhibition of DON-induced rRNA cleavage. p53 and caspase activation are additional upstream elements in the signaling pathway leading to DON-induced rRNA cleavage. cells were treated with DON (1000 ng/ml), SG (10 ng/ml), anisomycin (25 ng/ml), ricin (300 ng/ml) and lipopolysaccharide (10 g/ml) for 6 h. results are representative of three separate experiments. distinct 18S and 28S rRNA bands were evident in both control and DON-treated RAW 264.7 cells. over five additional rRNA fragment bands were detected in DON-treated cells. capillary electrophoresis was employed to monitor cleavage. Arrows designate three significant cleavage peaks between 28S and 18S rRNA. two peaks below 18S rRNA indicate chart region to be shown in subsequent figures. five probes complementary to 28S rRNA were hybridized to RNAs from RAW 264.7 cells treated with vehicle or DON (1000 ng/ml) for 6 h. Arrows indicate fragments from 28S rRNA identified by Northern blot analysis and their corresponding sizes. results are representative of three separate experiments. DON-induced rRNA Cleavage Is Concurrent With Apoptosis AO/EB staining of adherent RAW 264.7 cells revealed that DON exposure (1000 ng/ml, 6 h) induced significant apoptosis concurrent with rRNA degradation. flow cytometry was additionally employed to measure apoptosis in adherent and suspended cells following DON treatment. the role of these kinases in rRNA cleavage was determined using selective inhibitors. both the PKR inhibitor C-16 (0.1 and 0.3 M) and the Hck inhibitor PP1 (5 and 25 M) were found to concentration dependently suppress DON-induced rRNA cleavage. RNAs were purified and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. p38 mediates the sequential activation of p53 and caspase 3 to induce apoptosis. caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK also caused concentration-dependent inhibition of DON-induced rRNA cleavage. cells were treated with DON (1000 ng/ml), SG (10 ng/ml), anisomycin (25 ng/ml), ricin (300 ng/ml) and lipopolysaccharide (10 g/ml) for 6 h. RNAs were purified and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. ribotoxins have apparently different mechanisms for inhibiting translation. SG, anisomycin, and ricin induced similar apoptosis-mediated cleavage profile to that of DON. ribotoxins may share conserved pathway for mediating rRNA cleavage. DON-induced rRNA cleavage fragments (b\u2013f) were from the D8 region. two other cleavage sites (a and e) were within D10 (approximately 3785\u20133822 nts) it might be speculated that DON treatment rendered D8 and D10 accessible to constitutive and/or inducible RNases. transfection of 2-5A and RNase L activator (RLA) into RAW 264.7 cells did not induce rRNA cleavage. increased RNase L activity alone might be insufficient for inducing rRNA cleavage in RAW 264.7. p38 but not JNK mediated DON-induced rRNA cleavage. rRNA cleavage was completely suppressed by the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. rRNA cleavage was completely suppressed by the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. rRNA cleavage was a prerequisite for rRNA cleavage. caspases mediate degradation of some ribosomal-associated proteins. this proteolytic action might expose ribosome-embedded rRNA to constitutive and inducible RNases. this proteolytic action might expose ribosome-embedded rRNA to constitutive and inducible RNases. future work should focus on understanding how DON mediates PKR activation. future work should focus on identifying critical executing caspases and RNases."}
