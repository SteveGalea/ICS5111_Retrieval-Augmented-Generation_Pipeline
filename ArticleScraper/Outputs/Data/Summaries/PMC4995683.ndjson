{"summary": "early climate models predicted that warming would expand parasite and mosquito vector ranges beyond the tropics. climate change can stress hosts, and stress might make them more susceptible to infection or death. some diseases have emerged or increased 2 just as global greenhouse effects 3, urban heat islands 4, and devegetation 5 have increased temperatures over the last century. malaria and climate affects the malaria parasite and the mosquitoes that vector it. climate affects the parasite and the mosquitoes that vector it. climate affects the malaria parasite and the mosquitoes that vector it. species evolve low and broad thermal performance curves 30 or regulate toward an optimal temperature through endothermy, behavior, phenology, or migration 31. performance rises slowly from the critical thermal minimum (CTmin) to a thermal optimum (To), declining sharply to the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) climate change could affect host susceptibility, but effect probably varies with temperature and other factors. climate change could affect host susceptibility, but effect probably varies with temperature and other factors. trematode intensity is halved in a 3 \u00b0C warming experiment. this double effect of production and death on transmission helps explain why some trematode infections increase with warmer water 48. experimentally heating nests above ambient temperature killed parasites, leading to a sharp decline in parasitism 50. the most pathogenic parasites have a hard time persisting without a tolerant reservoir host. a key factor is host density (including vectors and reservoir hosts), which should increase the force of infection 64. for human, crop, and livestock diseases, economic development is another key driver 67, 68. many emerging and resurging diseases in wildlife and in humans are increasing in prevalence and geographic range over time as climate changes. disease events during warm years are not sufficient evidence for a climate change effect because diseases emerge each year for various reasons. temperature-disease correlations best indicate a climate change effect if they persist after removing the temporal trend and have experimental support. if climate does associate with an increase in a disease in a particular location, it is important not to overgeneralize. results can be inconsistent among similar parasite species. the review process is commissioned by members of the prestigious F1000 Faculty. the referees who approved the final version are listed with their names and affiliations but without their reports on earlier versions."}
