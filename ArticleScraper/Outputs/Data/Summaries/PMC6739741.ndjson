{"summary": "a cat with chronic, progressive, non-painful, non-lateralizing multifocal neurologic clinical signs associated with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) the cat initially presented as underweight, despite a good appetite, and a complete blood count showed non-regenerative anemia. three months later the cat was returned having developed ataxia and paraparesis, which then progressed over 2 months to tetraparesis, tail plegia, urinar the FECV biotype transmits readily and causes only a mild infection. if the viral infection worsens and becomes systemic then the virus is classified as the FIPV biotype. such viruses are believed to contain an \u2018internal mutation\u2019 that accounts for the altered tropism. a cat with neurologic FIP progressed over several months. the findings provide support that FIP can present predominantly in the CNS. a propensity for certain mutations can be associated with specific clinical presentations or pathological changes. chemistry profile showed marked elevations in alkaline phosphatase, alanine transferase and phosphorus levels. a decrease in creatinine and albumin was also noted. glucose (RI 72\u2013175 mg/dl) 87 95 (RI 77\u2013153 mg/dl) 91 ALT (RI 27\u2013158 U/l) 272 71 AST (RI 16\u201367 U/l) 68 33 ALP (RI 12\u201359 U/l) 101 48 (RI 14 \u2013 192 U/l) 58 GGT (RI 0\u20136 U/l) 2 3 Total bilirubin (RI 0.0\u20130.3 the cat returned to the general practitioner for evaluation of pelvic limb gait abnormalities that had progressed over the previous 2 weeks. the cat had severe non-ambulatory paraparesis, with more severe deficits on the right side. the chemistry panel revealed hypoalbuminemia, a decrease in albumin:globulin (A:G) ratio, low creatinine values and hyperphosphatemia. the chemistry panel revealed hypoalbuminemia, a decrease in the albumin:globulin (A:G) ratio, low creatinine values and hyperphosphatemia. tetra-ataxia and paresis significantly worsened over the next few months. the cat now had titubation, tail plegia and consistent urinary and fecal incontinence. a necropsy was performed at the animal health diagnostic center. ventricular system was effaced by a similar inflammatory population. no FIP-associated lesions were present in other organs. non-FCoV comorbid histologic findings were chronic enteritis with mid-mucosal fibrosis. PCR conditions were 20 mins at 50\u00b0C, 3 mins at 95\u00b0C and 40 cycles of 10 s at 95\u00b0C, 20 s at 55\u00b0C, 40 s at 72\u00b0C, then 10 mins at 72\u00b0C. PCR and sequencing showed the presence of a type I FCoV, based on a sequence alignment with reference genomes. the cat initially presented to the referring veterinarian with respiratory signs and fever, and with abnormal liver enzyme function and anemia. at this time FIP was not suspected. these initial signs resolved but were replaced by progressing neurologic signs, which led ultimately to euthanasia. all samples tested from this cat contained a distinct leucine residue at position 791. mutation of the viral spike protein is linked to FIP outcome, specifically in the S1/S2 cleavage-activation site. not determined Individual sequences were terminated in different ways M = methionine; L = leucine Conclusions This case report describes a young cat with neurologic FIP in which detailed clinical and molecular characterization of the associated FCoV infection was performed."}
