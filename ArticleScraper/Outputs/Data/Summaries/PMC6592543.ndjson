{"summary": "a newly described canine circovirus (CanineCV) was identified recently in serum from healthy dogs [1]. some characteristics of the disease observed in dogs were also present in pigs infected with porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2), found to be genetically related. a total of 18 puppies died, and the rest recovered within a week. all dogs had been properly vaccinated against CPV, canine distemper virus and infectious canine hepatitis virus. samples belonging to surviving animals were not available. primer set for genomic/Rev 533 was used to amplify a 533 bp fragment from the Rep gene for diagnostic purposes. positive samples were further tested with other primer sets to cover the entire genome for sequencing purposes. a positive sample was tested with the additional primer sets listed in Table 1. amplicons were eluted after agarose gel electrophoresis with Easy Pure Quick gel Extraction kit. the full-length genome sequence was assembled using the Mafft software (EMBL-EBI) the complete sequence was named strain UBA-Baires and deposited in Genbank under accession number MK033608. study JQ821392 USA 2012 dog 214/2012/USA Kapoor et al., 2012 KC241982 USA 2013 dog UCD1/2013/USA Li et al., 2013 KC241983 USA 2013 dog UCD3/2013/USA Li et al., 2013 KC241984 USA 2013 dog UCD2/2013/USA Li et al., 2013 KF887949 Germany 2014 dog Ha13/2014/GER Halami et al., KT734822 Italy 2016 dog PE8575/2016/ITA Zaccaria et al., 2016 KT734823 Italy 2016 dog PE8575/2016/ITA Zaccaria et al., 2016 MG266899 China 2017 dog CD17/2017/CHI Yan et al., 2017 (unpublished) MF797786 China 2018 dog XF16/2018/CHI Je et al., 2018 (unpublished) primer set for genomic/Rev 533 was used to amplify a 533 bp fragment from the Rep gene for diagnostic purposes. positive samples were further tested with other primer sets to cover the entire genome for sequencing purposes. the full-length genome was assembled using the Mafft software (EMBL-EBI) the complete sequence was named strain UBA-Baires and deposited in Genbank under accession number MK033608. a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of these sequences was obtained using PhyML (version 3.1) [20]. geneBank Accession Number Origin Year Host Virus ID Reference MK033608 Argentina 2018 dog UBA-Baires/2018/ARG This study JQ821392 USA 2012 dog 214/2012/USA Kapoor et al. wolf AZ663/2016/ITA Zaccaria et al., 2016 KT734822 Italy 2016 dog TE6685/2016/ITA Zaccaria et al., 2016 KT734823 Italy 2016 dog PE8575/2016/ITA Zaccaria et al., 2016 MG266899 China 2017 dog CD17/2017/CHI Yan et al., 2017 (unpublished) results Detection of CanineCV Pooled tissue samples from two of the three animals genome of strain UBA-Baires was 2063 nt in length with a GC content of 51.5%. gene characteristics include two putative ORFs synthesized from both DNA strands and two intergenic regions. the overall nt identity of strain UBA-Baires ranged from 98% (strain Bari/411-13) to 85% (isolate UCD3-478). both Rep and Cap ORFs were highly conserved including sequences related to rolling circle replication (FTINN, TPHLQ and CSK) PCR analysis detected the presence of CPV in all samples, except for the stomach. all generated amplicons were digested with MboII. gel electrophoresis of PCR reactions for CanineCV with different tissues and primers. genome of strain UBA-Baires was 2063 nt in length with a GC content of 51.5%. nt identity of strain ranged from 98% (strain Bari/411-13) to 85% (isolate UCD3-478) mutants were confirmed after two independent sequencing runs from PCRs amplicons. no mutations were observed in the intergenic regions. nine major variable regions have been proposed to exist within the cap gene of CanineCV. only one of the four mutations present in the cap gene of strain UBA-Baires is encompassed at these proposed locations. aa substitutions in the cap gene have been described for PCV2. in dogs with respiratory symptoms from Thailand, CanineCV was detected together with respiratory pathogens (canine influenza virus, canine parainfluenza virus, and canine respiratory coronavirus) no histopathology was performed on these cases in order to confirm the presence of some of the lesions observed in previously described cases involving CanineCV. a more thorough analysis of the epidemiology and evolution of this emerging virus will help in the comprehension of its role in disease."}
