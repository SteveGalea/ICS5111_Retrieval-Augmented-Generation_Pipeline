{"summary": "differences in innate immune responses involved in bacterial defense at onset of AOM in children who were stringently defined as otitis prone (sOP) and children not otitis prone (NOP) children received all doses of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine according to the U.S. schedule with either pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 7 or pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 13 depending on the date of enrollment. TRIzol reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added to the MEF pellet. a DNA digestion step was performed by using deoxyribonuclease I enzyme from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) after RNA isolation, ribonuclease inhibitor was added to each sample to avoid degradation. cDNA template from each MEF sample was mixed with the appropriate ready-to-use PCR master mix. amplification performed (10 minutes at 95\u00b0C, 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95\u00b0C, 1 minute at 60\u00b0C) only genes with threshold cycle (Ct) values of 35 were considered to be detectable. phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin antibodies were added and incubated for 30 minutes. the samples were run per the manufacturer's instructions on a bio-Plex 200 system. total protein concentrations were determined by using the Pierce BCA Protein assay kit. children were enrolled from a middle-class, suburban, sociodemographic population in Rochester, new york. the details of the study design were previously described. 1 mL of TRIzol reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added to the MEF pellet. a DNA digestion step was performed by using deoxyribonuclease I enzyme from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) after RNA isolation, ribonuclease inhibitor was added to each sample to avoid degradation. cDNA template from each MEF sample was mixed with the appropriate ready-to-use PCR master mix. amplification performed (10 minutes at 95\u00b0C, 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95\u00b0C, 1 minute at 60\u00b0C) only genes with threshold cycle (Ct) values of 35 were considered to be detectable. phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin antibodies were added and incubated for 30 minutes. the samples were run per the manufacturer's instructions on a bio-Plex 200 system with Luminex xMAP technology. total protein concentrations were determined by using the Pierce BCA Protein assay kit. sOP population included 72% boys compared with 40% boys in the NOP population. sOP population included 72% boys compared with 40% boys in the NOP population. three genes differed significantly in upregulation. e 8 (MAPK8) and Toll-like receptor adaptor molecule 2 (TICAM2) genes were 2.20- and 2.31-fold downregulated in children who were sOP compared with children who were NOP (n = 12) sOP = Stringently defined otitis prone; NOP = not otitis prone. some genes, e.g., IL-8, TICAM2 and ZBP1 (zinc binding proteins) showed a similar trend nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) of children with stringently defined otitis prone (sOP) versus children who were not otitis prone (NOP) chemokine protein levels were significantly higher in children who were sOP, which corresponded to lower levels of gene expression. the sOP population included 72% boys compared with 40% boys in the NOP population. this difference was not significant (p = 0.214) mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8) and toll-like receptor adaptor molecule 2 (TICAM2) genes were 2.20- and 2.31-fold downregulated in children who were sOP compared with children who were NOP (n = 12) sOP = Stringently defined otitis prone; NOP = not otitis prone. innate immune response in the middle ear fluid (MEF) in relation to the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) or nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) of children with stringently defined otitis prone (sOP) versus children who were not otitis prone (NOP) IL-8 showed higher expression in children who were sOP. a previous study showed that overstimulation and dysfunction of recruited neutrophils within the lung result in release of a number of proinflammatory molecules and proteases. this is likely the case in children who were sOP and who experience AOM as well. SLPI is generally expressed at mucosal surfaces and plays a role in the defense against the destruction of epithelial tissues by neutrophil elastase. it exerts an impact on mucin gene expression, which is known to be an important regulator in otitis media. TICAM2 was shown to be required for IRF7 activation. we did not detect differences in protein levels of CCL5 in sOP compared with children who were NOP. this may be due to issues of assay sensitivity or sample size. the gene expression difference shown in this study could be attributed to viral co-infection in some of the children. IL-8 and IRF7 gene pathways are also affected by viral infection. it is not possible to determine if the noted gene expression differences are an epiphenomenon secondary to viral infection."}
