{"summary": "obesity is a risk factor for many adverse health conditions including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, obstructive sleep apnea, and osteoarthritis. it follows a social gradient in which those with the highest socioeconomic status are least affected. non-Hispanic black women older than 40 years have the highest prevalence of overweight or obesity at 80%. dynamic modeling and simulation could be used to identify data gaps to address that would improve confidence in the model\u2019s output. many of these methods have yet to be broadly adopted as mainstream tools in population health planning and policymaking. mobile and digital technologies are reducing barriers to data collection by substituting sensors for more expensive labor. a positive trend promoting the need for greater use of modeling and simulation is increased recognition that these methods have an important role in population health management and the development of cities. a trend conducive to greater diffusion of modeling and simulation methods is the growing interest in deriving new value from the sheer amount of data collected today. a trend conducive to greater diffusion of modeling and simulation methods is the growing interest in funding development of new modeling and simulation techniques for management and analysis of huge amounts of data. lack of understanding of modeling and simulation on the part of the end user is the difficulty modelers often have communicating with policymakers. the need for effective interdisciplinary collaboration is essential in modeling and simulation. the need for effective interdisciplinary collaboration is difficult because of differences in theoretical and conceptual orientation, terminology, and disciplinary practices. the national Institutes of Health supports training in systems science for young scientists in the Institute for Systems Science and Health. it has invested in modeling and simulation in select areas, including cancer,54 infectious diseases,26 and obesity. insufficient funding and training are inhibitors to greater development and use of modeling and simulation for population health. the state of Virginia formed a multisectoral collaborative for modeling and simulation directed at economic development. such partnerships could be extended to examine approaches to population health challenges. concrete steps could be taken to implement recommendations from previous studies regarding modeling and simulation in population health. the combination of methods can provide policymakers with a deeper understanding of the problems they face and the effectiveness of the options they have."}
