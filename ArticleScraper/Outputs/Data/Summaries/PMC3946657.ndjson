{"summary": "the AS03-adjuvanted Pandemrix\u00ae was the most commonly used vaccine in response to the Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreak in Europe [4]. in 2010 reports of a possible association between exposure to the vaccine and occurrence of narcolepsy in children and adolescents emerged in both the latter countries, which led to a review of the vaccine by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) a random sample of 1,011 people ranging between 20\u201390 years of age was drawn from the Swedish national population register. the aim was to examine to what extent self-reported intentions to improve personal hygiene and increase social distancing during influenza outbreaks can be explained by perceptions of threat and the ability to cope as outlined in PMT. the intentions to carry out a protective behavior are assessed by asking whether the respondent would try to perform the behavior during a mild and severe influenza outbreak. both outbreak scenarios described personal risk of infection as high (i.e., 1 in 3 people infected) and a minor lifestyle impact (services mainly operating normally) self-reported health is measured by the SF-8TM 24-hour recall questionnaire in order to examine associations with intentions to carry out protective behaviors. it is derived from the SF-36 for the purposes of yielding comparable scores for the 8 health dimensions and 2 summary measures of the SF-36 with minimal respondent burden. the subjects were asked to complete a paper-based survey, querying for sociodemiographic data and data elements from the SF-8TM. each subject was presented with brief scenarios of mild and severe influenza outbreaks. each subject was presented with brief scenarios of mild and severe influenza outbreaks. agreement scores in the low extreme were contrasted against other opinions for response efficacy and self-efficacy. for social distancing, agreement scores in the low extreme were contrasted against other opinions for response efficacy and self-efficacy. for social distancing, agreement scores in the low extreme were contrasted against other opinions. theoretical model was constructed to inform the analysis of the main research question. i.e. to what extent self-reported intentions to perform protective behaviors during influenza outbreaks can be explained by perceptions of threat and the ability to cope. self-assessments of health status, trust in official information and sociodemiographic factors. threat appraisal is in this study characterized in its three dimensions [11], [20]\u2013[21]: perceived relative risk of catching influenza; measured by one item assessing personal likelihood of infection; measured by one item for each influenza type; measured by one item for each influenza type; measured by one item for each influenza type. self-reported health is measured by the SF-8TM 24-hour recall questionnaire in order to examine associations with intentions to carry out protective behaviors. trust in government information during influenza outbreaks has been found to be associated with greater self-efficacy and personal hygiene. the sociodemiographic factors included in the model were marriage status, number of children living at home, formal education, employment status, and ethnicity. logistic regression analyses were applied using the items in the model as explanatory variables. these included trust in official information; variables corresponding to PMT items; variables representing the SF-8 summary items (PCS and MCS); and sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, educational level, living with partner, living with partner, and employment) the age category 65\u201390 years was slightly over-represented (54% response rate) among the study participants when compared to the total population sample (p = 0.039) however, the effect size of this difference in participation was small (Cramer\u2019s V = 0.08) study population displayed by the mean values (95% C.I.) on subscales and summary components of the Short Form-8 (n = 443). average 95% CI Reference General Health 48.95 48.13\u201349.77 48.90 Physical functioning 49.41 48.61\u201350.21 49.30 Role Physical 50.73 50.04\u201351.42 49.40 Bodily pain 53.74 52.87\u201354.60 50.00 Vitality 49.11 48.33\u201349.89 77% of the respondents scored strong agreement with the stated intention to use handwash products during mild outbreaks. 46% reported strong agreement in association to mild influenza outbreaks and 60% in association to severe outbreaks. self-reported intention strongly associated with coping appraisal. influenza scenario Mild influenza scenario Simple models Multiple modelb OR (95% C.I.)
