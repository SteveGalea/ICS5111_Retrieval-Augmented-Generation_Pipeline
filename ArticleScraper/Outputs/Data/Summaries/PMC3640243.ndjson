{"summary": "89.8% of health-care workers were aware of the DSN system. only 33.3, 31.1, and 33.7% knew specific uses of forms IDSR 001, IDSR 002 and IDSR 003 (IDSR: Integrated Diseases Surveillance and Response) disease surveillance depends on definition of case and recognition of illness, compilation of individual data, analysis, and reporting. notifiable diseases are diseases that must be reported to the public health-care authority in the relevant jurisdiction when the diagnosis is made. the health-care facility staff collects data at this level, fills, and sends the forms on a weekly or monthly basis. results are sent to the local government primary health care department. the data are analysed before transmission to the federal ministry of health. population of 4,182,032 with 2,174,641 males and 2,007,391 females. 21 local government areas (LGAs) and 177 communities in the state. literacy level ranges from 48.6% to 84.1%. 79% of respondents were found to have reported occurrence of an epidemic. q=1 \u2013 0.79=0.21 An adjustment of the estimate of the sample size to cover for non-response rate was made by dividing the sample size calculated with a factor f. a multistage sampling technique was used to select six health-care facilities from the state. study was limited to notifiable infectious diseases only because data were not collected on maternal and child health care, family planning, and noncommunicable diseases. only 33.3% knew that the form IDSR 001 was used for immediate/case-based reporting, whereas 17.1% knew the correct use of the IDSR 001 form, mentioning correctly two diseases reported using it. the IDSR 001 and IDSR 002 forms were predominantly found in primary health-care facilities. however, the HMIS forms were less likely to be available in secondary health-care facilities (2=7.67, P=0.005) the KII finding shows that DSNOs have been sponsored to attend several workshops. only 33.3% of health-care personnel studied knew that IDSR001 form was used for immediate/case-based reporting. 31.1% knew that IDSR002 form was used for weekly notification of epidemic-prone diseases. 33.7% knew that IDSR003 form was used for monthly notification of diseases of public health-care importance. the quantitative survey is contrary to that of Bawa et al.,9. only 8.0% of the facilities had IDSR forms. it also differs from that of Adindu,23."}
