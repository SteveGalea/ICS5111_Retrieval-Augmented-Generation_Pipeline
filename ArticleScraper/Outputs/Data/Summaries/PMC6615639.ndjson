many of those sequences sharing a significant degree of resemblance to m366.6. both in vitro and in vivo experiments used the AG129 (types-I and -II IFN receptor deficient) mice to test the therapeutic effect of m366.6 against DENV-2. the survival rate of mice in the control antibody treatment group can reach 67% in m366.6 treatment group. m366.6 epitope is at close to or partially overlaps the dimerization interface between domains II and III. m366.6 is a potent cross-reactivity of m366.6 to naturally isolated dengue viruses. docking of deNV DIII-m366.6 antibody complex was performed using ZDOCK method. we selected the three top scored docked complexes that contained key residues identified from an experimental epitope mapping approach. one of the top scored docked models exhibited minimum clashes with appropriate protein interface parameters. discussion Dengue is a disease with a complex immune response orchestrated by host cells partially due to the presence of four serotypes of DENV. it is very urgent to develop an effective and cross-reactive antiviral therapy against DENV infection. the conserved fusion loop epitope (FLE) in DII is the immunodominant epitope in E protein. however, this epitope frequently induced poorly neutralizing and strongly infection-enhancing antibodies via ADE [18\u201320]. therefore, DIII represents the ideal target for neutralizing antibodies. we analyzed m366.6 sequence using the IMGT tool to identify its closest VH and V germline genes. the m366.6 IgG showed broadly neutralization towards the four serotypes DENV as well as a recent DENV isolate from clinical samples. the epitope appears to overlap with the epitope previously explored as targets for cross-reactive murine mAbs. m366.6 is a potential candidate therapeutic which could be further developed in preclinical and clinical settings. the epitope of the germline-like mAb m366.6 could guide the design of effective candidate vaccine immunogens capable of eliciting m366.6. the plasmids were transfected into Expi293 cells (Thermo Fisher) for transient expression. the purified protein was biotinylated by mixing with biotinylation reagents. the plasmids of the positive clones were prepared by using Zyppy Plasmid Miniprep Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. random mutagenesis of the scFv genes were performed through error-prone and DNA shuffling PCR. varying concentrations of antigens were injected at 30 l/min using running buffer containing 10mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.05% Surfactant P-20. the association and dissociation phase data were fitted simultaneously to a 1:1 Langumir global model. dilutions of antibodies under concentrations ranging from 100 to 0.01 g/ml were mixed with DENV-1 or DENV-2, and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. the cells were then washed 3 times with serum free RPMI-1640 medium. the ADE effect was calculated as different viral yields in the supernatant after infection in the presence of the added antibodies. the epitope mapping of m366.6 was performed using previously described protocols. after two rounds of sorting on a FACSAria II cell sorter, the sorted cells were amplified and their plasmids were prepared. docking of scFv m366.6 to the dengue Env-III was performed by ZDOCK server (http://zdock.bu.edu) we selected a list of residues as biological constrains, 307, 309, 310, 311, 327, 361 and 383, on the surface of DENV DIII. mice were intracerebrally injected with 200 PFU of DENV1-4. survival rates, weight loss, and disease sings were monitored daily. all mice were intracerebrally injected with 200 PFU of DENV1-4. o cells C6/36 were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. all cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. all cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C incubator. 10 g of binotinylated DIII.3-Fc and 1010 cells of the initial nave library were mixed and washed by PBSA. the downsized library was further sorted against binotinylated DIII.3-Fc (1 g/ml) but also using unbiotinylated K310E mutant (1 g/ml) as the competitor. m360 scFv, m366 scFv, m360.6 scFv, and m366.6 scFv were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance technology. the antibodies were covalently immobilized onto a sensor chip. the mixture was added to a 12-well plate in duplicate and incubated for 1 h. the mixture was removed and 1 ml of 1.0% (w/v) LMP agarose (Promega) was layered onto the infected cells. the wells were stained with 1% (w/v) crystal violet dissolved in 4% (v/v) formaldehyde to visualize the plaques. the data were fit to a sigmoidal dose-response curve using Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA) to determine the titer of antibody that achieved a 50% reduction in infection. dilutions were mixed with DENV-1 or DENV-2, and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. a-488 conjugated goat-anti-mouse antibody (Invitrogen) and PE-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen) sorted cells were amplified and their plasmids were prepared and sequenced. computational docking of m366.6 scFv antibody was carried out using the SWISS-MODEL workspace [68]. two residues from each of each of CDR-H1, H3 and L3 loops were chosen at the docking interface. results from the top 2000 ZDOCK predictions were filtered using the user-defined residues. three predicted complexes were only kept as all residues selected come together at the interface. all mice were intraperitoneally injected with 2x106 PFU of DENV-2 in a volume of 200 L. survival rates, weight loss, and disease sings were monitored daily. all experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the institutional committee of Fudan University. m360.6 was immobilized onto a CM5 chip. the analytes consisted of serial dilution of DIII from DENV-1 (A), DENV-2 (B), DENV-3 (C) or DENV-4 (D) DENV-2 was incubated with serial dilutions of mAbs before added to K562 cells. m366.6 IgG-LALA was incubated with 10fold serial dilutions."}
