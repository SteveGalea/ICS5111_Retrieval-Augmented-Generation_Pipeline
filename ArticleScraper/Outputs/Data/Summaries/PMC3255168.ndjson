{"summary": "Hundreds of genes have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease. many of these genes can be grouped into discrete signalling networks and pathways relevant to the various subpathologies, risk factors, and biochemistry of Alzheimer's disease. viral, bacterial, spirochete, and fungal pathogens implicated in dementia or Alzheimer's disease are referenced at http://www.polygenicpathways.co.uk/alzenvrisk.htm. h. pylori eradication has been reported to improve performance and increase lifespan in Alzheimer's disease patients. herpes simplex, HHV-6, C. Pneumoniae, H. pylori and the periodontal pathogen, P. Gingivalis, have also been implicated in atherosclerosis [22\u201325], while C. neoformans infection in rabbits induces an increase in neutrophil superoxide production. atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries, or of the circle of Willis and leptomeningeal APP, gamma secretase, and previous GWAS results are majoritarily involved in pathogen entry and defence, particularly in relation to herpes simplex. this suggests that genes, pathogens, and the immune system act together to cause Alzheimer's disease. this suggests that a focus on pathogen detection and elimination should be a priority in the ageing at risk population. key interactors, currently numbering over 450, are stocked and referenced at http://www.polygenicpathways.co.uk/herpesKEGG.htm. expression data are provided in Figure 1 and are also hyperlinked to the bioGPS webserver. susceptibility genes returned from very large genomewide association studies are in black, and those from the pre-GWAS era in grey. linked diamonds and other effects indicated by linked diamonds and other effects by arrows. clusterin, predominantly expressed in brain, liver, and testis, is a ligand for the lipoprotein receptor, megalin (LRP2) that is involved in beta-amyloid clearance. complement cascade binding to complement component, CR1 ligand, C3 and its derivatives and to CD59, a further inhibitor of the formation of the complement membrane attack complex [48]. a protein that stabilises the complement C3 and C5 convertase contributes to the formation of the membrane attack complex [49]. complement pathway is involved in bactericidal effects against this pathogen. clathrin-mediated endocytosis and intracellular transport pathways are indicated by linked diamonds and other effects by arrows. clathrin-mediated endocytosis and intracellular transport pathways are indicated by linked diamonds and other effects by arrows. early endosomes receive traffic from the cell surface, which is transferred to late endosomes for traffic to lysosomes. late endosomes also receive traffic from the trans-Golgi network used to synthesise proteins and from phagocytic pathways. lysosomal or proteasomal pathways may be used to destroy pathogen proteins. PICALM plays a key role in clathrin-related endocytosis. binding to clathrin heavy chains (CLTC and CLTCL1) plays a key role in clathrin-related endocytosis. the AP-2 complex is a heterotetramer consisting of permutations. GGA1 binds to the sortilin-related receptor, SORL1, and the APP cleaving beta-secretase BACE2. GGA2 binds to the beta-secretases BACE1 and BACE2, SORL1 and the prolyl-isomerase PIN1. CD2AP is involved in the entry of the helicobacter vacuolating toxin VacA. the ectodomain of E-cadherin is involved in bacterial adherence to mammalian cells. the ectodomain of E-cadherin is involved in bacterial adherence to mammalian cells. the ectodomain of E-cadherin is involved in bacterial adherence to mammalian cells. integrins are used for attachment by viruses, bacteria, and fungi. individual integrins bind to many others, forming heteromeric complexes. integrins may serve as pattern recognition receptors regulating immune response. CD33-related SIGLECs regulate adaptive immune responses. binds to alpha2-3- or alpha2-6-linked sialic acids (N-acetyl neuraminic acid) [95]. these specific sialic acids are expressed on the surface envelope glycoproteins. IDO1 activation can lead to the production of toxic tryptophan derivatives. plasma tryptophan levels are also lower in the ageing population and in Alzheimer's disease. a pattern accompanied by immune activation and increased concentrations of quinolinic acid. only three protein/protein interactions for EPHA1 are reported in the NCBI gene interaction section. EFNA1, the anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) and a SMAD-specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 (SMURF2). clusterin is a ligand for TGF beta receptors (TGFBR1/TGFBR2) [121]. Gamma secretase substrates are indicated by the square boxes and their pathogen ligands in the oval boxes. APOA1 and APOE are substrates of the lipoproteins. plasma membrane-situated ABCA7 increases efflux of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin efflux to APOA1 and APOE, with no effect on cholesterol efflux. but cholesterol efflux to lipid-laden APOE, but not to lipid free APOE, is increased by ABCA7 expression in HEK-293 cells. APOA1 exerts antiviral effects against herpes simplex and inhibits viral entry into cells. in macrophages, ABCA7 is expressed intracellularly and does not participate in cholesterol or phospholipid efflux. in man, APOE is also involved in hepatitis C, HIV-1, and herpes simplex infectivity. resistance to infection (Klebsiella pneumoniae) or endotoxaemia is also decreased in APOE knockout mice. Helicobacter pylori is able to promote atherosclerosis in heterozygous APOE (+/) LDLR (+/) mice. arginine methyltransferase, PRMT5, regulates herpes simplex replication via methylation of the ICP27 viral gene. DISC1 is a component of the microtubule-associated dynein motor complex used in viral traffic. TTLL7 (tubulin tyrosine ligase-like family, member 7) also regulates tubulin phosphorylation. pathogens, including herpes simplex, express thymidylate kinases. they are important for viral replication and a target for acyclovir. hyperhomocysteinaemia correlates with C. pneumoniae IgG immunoreactivity in carotid artery atherosclerosis. beta amyloid clearance is mediated via lipoprotein receptors. APOE, clusterin, and complement receptor 1 play key roles in beta amyloid clearance. APOE, clusterin, and alpha-2 macroglobulin (A2M) also play key roles in beta amyloid clearance. clathrin assembly protein AP180 in a neuronal cell line does reduce beta-amyloid generation. clathrin-mediated endocytosis is relevant to many receptors, including members of the lipoprotein family (LRP1, LRP2, LRP8, LDLR, VLDLR) [179] MAPT stabilises microtubules by interacting with tubulins and promoting microtubule assembly [189] hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangles are among the core pathologies of Alzheimer's disease [190] and can be promoted by herpes simplex infection [191] beta-amyloid autoantibodies in the sera of the ageing population and in Alzheimer's disease. antimicrobial, antiviral, and immunostimulant properties of beta-amyloid are likely to be abrogated by the presence of beta-amyloid autoantibodies in the sera of the ageing population and in Alzheimer's disease. gamma secretase is involved in proteolysis of at least three herpes simplex receptors, nectin 1 alpha (PVRL1) [204], and syndecans (SDC1, SDC2) [205]. gamma secretase is involved in proteolysis of at least three herpes simplex receptors, nectin 1 alpha (PVRL1) [204], and nectin 1 alpha (PVRL4). lipoprotein receptors LRP1, LDLR, and VLDLR are activated by the Epstein-Barr virus [220, 221], while ERBB4 is a receptor for vaccinia and other pox viruses. the low affinity nerve growth factor (NGFR) is a rabies virus receptor, [223], Ephrin B2, (EFNB2) a Nipah virus and Hendra virus receptor [224] and sialophorin (SPN), this scenario is supported by the ability of herpes simplex, C. pneumoniae, and B. burgdorferi to increase beta-amyloid deposition. the final extent of risk may depend on the overall pathogen burden, rather than upon any specific pathogen. autoantibodies are observed in many, if not most human diseases. autoantibodies targeting extracellular and intracellular human proteins would be expected to effect protein knockdown, a strictly immunopharmacological effect, as well as immune attack. many autoantigens targeted by the autoantibodies reported in these conditions contain peptide sequences identical to those in pathogens also implicated in the disease. pathogen/human matches are highly and significantly enriched in the products of susceptibility genes implicated in Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and schizophrenia. many genes related to Alzheimer's disease, including those described above, are involved in the immune network [10, 256], and the propensity for developing autoantibodies to particular proteins is also genetically determined and inherited. beta-amyloid plaques contain numerous inflammatory proteins, and even without meningoencephalitis, these are commonly found within the walls of meningeal and medium-sized cortical arteries in Alzheimer's disease [265]. Almost the entire length of the tau protein was predicted as immunogenic (B cell epitope), as defined by the server set cutoff index of 0.35. antibodies to which label beta-amyloid in brain tissue have already been reported to be identical to proteins expressed by 69 viruses including HSV-1, HSV-2, and HHV6. only highly antigenic regions of pentapeptides or more were processed. neoformans HDSGY

coloration susceptibility genes, or the variety of tree (risk factors), do not kill the moth but allow several causes to do so. epidemiological studies could conclude that the birds are not killing the moths, as they are always present, on both sets of trees. many of the pathogens implicated in Alzheimer's disease are able to promote cerebral beta-amyloid deposition in animal models without the aid of any gene variant. tangles are highly enriched in human proteins used the herpes simplex during its life cycle. the virus establishes latency in neurones, existing as a dormant form where only the latency transcript is expressed. a number of factors related to susceptibility genes and environmental risk factors can be related to herpes simplex latency and reactivation. high levels of total oestradiol have been reported as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease in both women and men [282, 283]. vitamin A related gens include APOE4, the isoform least able to transport the vitamin A precursor retinyl palmitate, A2M ABCA1 ALB ALDH2 APOA1 CHD4 CLU CYP46A1 ESR1 GSTM1 GSTP1 HSPG2 KLF5 LIPA LPL LRAT L glucocorticoids and prostaglandins are also able to reactivate the virus. cyclooxygenase inhibitors (PTGS2), celecoxib and indomethacin block viral reactivation. hypoxia also increases the replication of herpes simplex. individual species may exert benevolent or malevolent effects. these networks are implicated in diseases, and their efficiency, as well as pathogen/host homology, is dictated by susceptibility genes. the principles discussed here may apply to many other, if not most human diseases. protective agents can be linked to pathological pathways involved in cholesterol and lipid function (statins, fish, and diet, e.g., ABCA1, ABCA7, ABCG1, ACADS, ALDH2, APOA4, APOC1-4, APOE, CH25H, CYP46A1, DHCR24, FDPS, HMGCR, HMGCS2, HSD11B1, LIPC, LRP1, LRP2, LRP8, LDLR, LIPA, phage display is now possible to express peptide fragments of the entire human proteome in a phage library. the antigen expressed by the labelled phage can be identified by high throughput sequencing. such technology is likely to be extremely useful in characterising biomarkers and pathological immune processes as well as potential pathogen/human cross-reactivity. two groups have reported a very extensive repertoire of autoantigens in Alzheimer's disease, which can be characterised with a high degree of accuracy by a definitive immunosignature. the principles outlined above could thus be tested by analysis of pathogen/autoantigen cross-reactivity. ligand for lipoprotein receptor, megalin (LRP2) that is involved in beta-amyloid clearance. complement inhibitor prevents formation of membrane attack complex. herpes simplex virus interacts with other members of the complement cascade. receptor, also known as MAC-1, generally mediates the phagocytosis of pathogens coated with complement C3 derivatives. complement inhibitor CD59 is also a ligand for CD2 and CD59 activation of this receptor, presumably involving CD2AP, activates T cell receptor signalling resulting in the secretion of interleukins. mammalian surface receptors are endocytosed via clathrin-dependent or independent processes. early endosomes receive traffic from the cell surface, which is transferred to late endosomes for traffic to lysosomes. late endosomes also receive traffic from the trans-Golgi network. olar sorting proteins (SORCS1, SORCS2, SORCS3, SORL1) are usurped by viruses and other pathogens to gain access to cells and to various intracellular compartments. lysosomal or proteasomal pathways may be used to destroy pathogen proteins. clathrin-mediated endocytosis is one of several processes used by Helicobacter pylori, herpes simplex, and many other viral, bacterial and fungal path gamma-adaptins (GGA, GGA2, GGA3) bind to clathrins and mannose-6-phosphate receptors and regulate protein traffic between the Golgi network and the lysosome and the sorting of mannose-6-phosphate receptors. this network is also related to important Alzheimer's disease susceptibility genes as the interactions culled from NCBI gene show that GGA1 binds to the sortilin-related receptor, SORL a protein that is exploited by several bacteria (Escherichia coli, Shigella, Neisseria, Rickettsia, Chlamydia, Staphylococcus, Cryptosporidium, and Helicobacter pylori), fungi (Candida Albicans), viruses (Vaccinia) enabling them to modify the actin cytoskeleton. the ectodomain of E-cadherin is involved BIN1 also participates in phagocytosis in macrophages and is associated with early phagosomes. but it is retained on vacuoles containing Chlamydia pneumoniae. integrins are used for attachment by viruses, bacteria, and fungi. gE: immunoglobulin E, sialic: alpha2-3- or alpha2-6-linked sialic acids: genes in the top right square were returned from GWAS prior to the very large studies. CD33 is a member of the sialic acid binding Immunoglobulin g-like lectin (SIGLEC) family. CD33-related SIGLECs regulate adaptive immune responses. IDO1 upregulation is an important defence mechanism against pathogenic bacteria. many of these bacteria are unable to synthesise tryptophan. this response is also deleterious to other pathogens and parasites. IgE-related allergic responses are also involved in C. neoformans infection. other members of this gene cluster are structurally related to the immunoglobulin E receptor and to CD20 (MS4A1). EPHA1 is an ephrin receptor, primarily expressed in the liver. ALK plays a role in neural development, and its expression decreases with age. it plays a role in neural development, and its expression decreases with age. its key involvement in lymphoma suggests a role in the immune network. APOA1 and APOE are substrates for ABCA7. plasma membrane-situated ABCA7 increases efflux of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. sphingomyelin is enriched in extracellular herpes simplex viral membranes. apolipoprotein E Possession of the APOE4 allele facilitates the entry and transmission of herpes simplex in mice. APOE mRNA is primarily expressed in the liver, adipocytes; kidney and brain, with very low expression in the peripheral immune network. APOE mRNA is primarily expressed in the liver, adipocytes; kidney and brain. the presence of the APOE4 allele is associated with an enhanced macrophage inflammatory response. the anti-inflammatory effects of 17-beta-oeastradiol on microglia are also reduced in such animals. the anti-inflammatory effects of 17-beta-oeastradiol on microglia are also reduced in such animals. the presence of the APOE4 allele is associated with an enhanced macrophage inflammatory response. cytokine responses to the intracerebral injection of lipopolysaccharide are increased in APOE4 transgenic mice. the anti-inflammatory effects of 17-beta-oeastradiol on microglia are also reduced in such animals. PVRL2 is a receptor for herpes simplex (HSV-1 and HSV-2) [158], and the mitochondrial translocator, TOMM40, a receptor for certain chlamydial species. the replication factor RFC3 is part of a complex necessary for human DNA polymerase activity. a related arginine methyltransferase, PRMT5 regulates herpes simplex replication via methylation of the ICP27 viral gene. MTHD1L is involved in mitochondrial synthesis of tetrahydrofolate kinases. many pathogens, including herpes simplex, express thymidylate kinases. apolipoprotein APOC1 is present in all lipoprotein blood fractions in blood. APOE, clusterin, and complement receptor 1 play key roles in beta amyloid clearance as do two further herpes simplex binding proteins APOA1 and alpha-2 macroglobulin (A2M) this is primarily mediated via lipoprotein receptors. APOA1 is also involved in beta-amyloid clearance via its transporter ABCA1. beta amyloid in the bloodstream is processed by its binding to complement C3. it subsequently binds to complement receptor 1 on erythrocytes. clathrin-dependent endocytosis is also involved in internalisation and recycling of neuronal APP. but knockdown of AP180 in a neuronal cell line does reduce beta-amyloid generation. the microtubule network and Tau Phosphorylation Many pathogens, including herpes simplex, helicobacter, chlamydiae, P. gingivalis, and C. neoformans, use the microtubule network. MAPT stabilises microtubules by interacting with tubulins and promoting microtubule assembly. beta-amyloid is an antimicrobial peptide with broad spectrum activity against a variety of yeasts and bacteria, effects that were attenuated by anti-A antibodies. beta-amyloid also activates innate immune responses via the activation of pattern recognition receptors. beta-amyloid autoantibodies are likely to be abrogated by the presence of beta-amyloid autoantibodies in the sera of the ageing population. monocytes for PSEN1 http://www.biogps.org/#goto=genereport&id=5663/, dendritic cells and myeloid cells for nicastrin http://www.biogps.org/#goto=genereport&id=23385/ and B cells, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and myeloid cells for APH1A. gamma secretase is involved in prote CD46 is also cleaved by a protease secreted by P. gingivalis. rabies virus receptor, EFNB2 a Nipah virus and Hendra virus receptor, 224. chemokine CXCL16 binds to cytomegalovirus chemokine receptor. phosphatidylserine is the major lipid membrane component in most bacteria. a major function of this key group, implicated in both familial and late onset Alzheimer's disease, is dedicated to pathogen defence. increased beta-amyloid generation is primarily a defence mechanism to rid the body (and brain) of invading pathogens. autoantibodies can traverse the blood brain barrier [242] and enter cells via high affinity IgG receptors (Fc gamma receptors) (FCER1G) in the case of the rhinovirus, or the SARS coronavirus, or via the tripartite motif protein, TRIM21 in the case of adenoviruses. this ability places autoantibodies in a rather sinister context, as their targeting of extracellular and intracellular human proteins would 22 autoantigens reported in HIV-1/AIDS contain HIV-1/human matching sequences. it has been argued that slightly dissimilar, rather than exact matches, are the more malignant in terms of autoimmunity. autoantibodies must be dependent upon the extent of pathogen/human matching, and thus by genes which determine human protein sequences. autoantigens have a tendency to relate to proteins known to bind to dermatan sulphate, a component of dead cells [259] and a constituent of glycosaminoglycan receptors for many bacteria and viruses. in mice, immunisation with neuronal tau produces neurofibrillary tangle-like structures, axonal damage, and gliosis, as in Alzheimer's disease, in vivo. predicted B cell epitope segments were compared with Borrelia burgdorferi, C. neoformans, C. pneumoniae, H. pylori, P. gingivalis and herpes viruses. the VGGVV sequence, antibodies to which label beta-amyloid in brain tissue, has already been reported to be identical to proteins expressed by 69 viruses. pneumoniae EF SGYEV 4 F 0.73 C. neoformans FRHDS Borrelia burgdorferi +RH SGY++ and F H+SG H. pylori F HD EV Cytomegalovirus FR SGY P. gingivalis +RHDS C.

APP, beta amyloid, and gamma secretase seem intimately concerned with pathogen life cycles and defence and the immune network. susceptibility genes are in fact causative agents, which are conditioned by susceptibility genes. vitamin A supplementation in rats increases cerebral levels of both NGF and BDNF. oestrogen deficiency lowers cerebral NGF levels. high levels of total oestradiol have been reported as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. stress-activated corticosterone is also able to reactivate the virus. herpes simplex reactivation is blocked by beta-receptor antagonism. hypoxia also increases replication of herpes simplex 301. the microbiome in Alzheimer's disease These pathogens form a very small proportion of an extensive human microbiome. these networks are implicated in diseases, and their efficiency is dictated by susceptibility genes. these networks are implicated in diseases, and their efficiency, as well as pathogen/host homology, is dictated by susceptibility genes. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories or the generally healthy life-style of nuns living in convents have all been associated with a reduced incidence or severity of Alzheimer's disease. homocysteine lowering B vitamins and folate have been shown to slow the rate of brain atrophy in cognitively impaired elderly patients. the success of such protective agents is likely to be determined by genes and other confounding factors. in this genomic era, affordable whole genome sequencing will soon be achieved, ushering in an age of more effective treatments tailored to individual genetic profiles. technology is likely to be extremely useful in characterising biomarkers and pathological immune processes. a move from GWAS to PWAS would also be very informative. selective autoantibody removal via affinity dialysis might well be expected to influence the severity and progression of Alzheimer's disease. ary tangles are among the core pathologies of Alzheimer's disease. herpes simplex proteins are homologous to a number of kinases known to phosphorylate tau (GSK3A, GSK3B, MAPK1 and CAMK2B). APP plays a key role in the herpes simplex life cycle and is involved in its intracellular transport [193] gamma secretase is constituted of four components: the presenilins (PSEN1 or PSEN2), anterior pharynx-defective-1 (APH1A), the Presenilin enhancer-2 (PSENEN) and nicastrin (NCSTN) APP is the only gene in this set that appears to be preferentially distributed in brain compartments. the substrate, APP, is the only gene in this set that appears to be preferentially gamma secretase is involved in proteolysis of at least three herpes simplex receptors, nectin 1 alpha (PVRL1) [204], and syndecans (SDC1, SDC2) [205]. gamma secretase is involved in proteolysis of at least three herpes simplex receptors, nectin 1 alpha (PVRL1) [204], and syndecans (SDC1, SDC2) [205]. rabies virus receptor, [223], Ephrin B2, (EFNB2) a Nipah virus and Hendra virus receptor, [224] and sialophorin (SPN), a receptor for the influenza A, and both human and simian immunodeficiency viruses. chemokine CXCL16 is a scavenger receptor for phosphatidylserine and oxidized low density lipoprotein [229] autoantibodies derived from pathogens as contributor-caucasative agents. Viruses and bacteria express proteins containing short contiguous amino acid stretches. these pathogens are identical to those in human proteins. autoantibodies targeting extracellular and intracellular human proteins would be expected to effect protein knockdown, a strictly immunopharmacological effect, as well as immune attack. many autoantigens targeted by the autoantibodies reported in these conditions contain peptide sequences identical to those in pathogens also implicated in the disease. autoantibodies will depend on the extent of human/pathogen matching. somatic hypermutation, which drives the creation of multiple antibodies, is disrupted in autoimmune disorders. autoantigens have tendency to relate to proteins known to bind to dermatan sulphate. beta-amyloid plaques contain numerous inflammatory proteins, and even without meningoencephalitis, these are commonly found within the walls of meningeal and medium-sized cortical arteries in Alzheimer's disease [265]. Almost the entire length of the tau protein (638/776 amino acids = 82.2%) was predicted as immunogenic (B cell epitope), as defined by the server set cutoff index of 0.35. neoformans +AE HDSG+

ATP synthase, induce apoptosis, and increase the cellular uptake of high density lipoprotein [266, 267], antibrain antibodies that enhance intraneuronal beta-amyloid deposition [269] and antimicrobial peptide S100B. many of the pathogens implicated in Alzheimer's disease (herpes simplex, Borrelia burgdorferi and C. pneumoniae) are able to promote cerebral beta-amyloid deposition in animal models without the aid of any gene variant. this suggests numerous ways with which to tackle the problem of Alzheimer's disease. the cerebral herpes simplex viral load is decreased in APOE knockout mice. the viral load is much increased in APOE4 transgenic mice compared to APOE3 mice. a number of factors related to susceptibility genes and environmental risk factors can be related to herpes simplex latency and reactivation. the virus can also be reactivated by heat [284], IL6 [285], or TNF [286]. stress-activated corticosterone is also able to reactivate the virus. the virus can also be reactivated by heat [284], IL6 [285], or TNF [286]. retinoic acid isomers all-trans-, 9-cis-, and 13-cis-Retinoic Acid are all able to reduce viral replication. reactivation occurs is stimulated by caspase 3 activation (CASP3). the principles discussed here may apply to many other, if not most, human diseases. the principles discussed here may apply to many other, if not most, human diseases.
