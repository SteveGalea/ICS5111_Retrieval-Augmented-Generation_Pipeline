{"summary": "Methods Setting Abu Dhabi is the largest of the 7 emirates of UAE. it has 2.3 million residents, including 1.9 million expatriates, and 35 hospitals (14) healthcare exposure to a case-patient was characterized as either confirmed or probable (i.e., persons who had been within 2 m of a symptomatic case) (15,17) or probable (i.e., persons who had been within the same hospital unit for >1 hour, had a common HCW, or had moved into a bed or dialysis station vacated by a symptomatic case) rRT-PCR assay was performed on a subset of isolates from 8 case-patients (7 from healthcare-associated clusters and 1 non\u2013healthcare related) full genome sequencing from original respiratory samples was determined by using the Sanger method (direct genome walking PCR) and next-generation sequencing approaches (22,23) close contacts, including anyone who lived with, visited, provided care for, or had similar close contact with case-patients while they were symptomatic, were identified from interviews and other sources. infections of case-patients who worked at, were admitted to, or visited a healthcare facility during the 14 days before symptom onset were considered to be healthcare-associated if exposure occurred exclusively in this setting. clinical records were used to assess probable exposures for healthcare-associated case-patients with no confirmed exposure. cases with confirmed exposure were not assessed for probable exposure because confirmed exposure was assumed to confer the greatest risk. clinical records were used to assess probable exposures for healthcare-associated case-patients with no confirmed exposure. based rRT-PCR assay at CDC (21). Sequencing Genetic sequencing was performed on a subset of isolates from 8 case-patients (7 from healthcare-associated clusters and 1 non\u2013healthcare related) sequencing was determined by using the Sanger method (direct genome walking PCR) and next-generation sequencing approaches (22,23). all HCA case-patients, n = 27 HCWs, n = 19 Patients, n = 2 Median age, y (range) 59 (30\u201383) 43 (27\u201382) 39 (27\u201363) 65 (40\u201373) 44 (34\u201354) Male sex 3 (100) 17 (63) 11 (58) 5 (83) 1 (50) Expatriate 1 (33) 26 (96) 18 (95) 6 (100) 2 (100) 0.02 (5) 2 (33) 0 Vomiting/nausea 1 (33 1 (4) 0 1 (17) 0 Medical history Any underlying conditions 2 (67) 15 (56) 7 (37) 6 (100) 2 (100) Diabetes mellitus 1 (33) 6 (22) 1 (5) 4 (67) 1 (50) Dementia 1 (33) 0 0 0 0 0 0 Receiving immunosuppressant 1 (33) 0 0 0 0 0 source case-patients include HCWs, patients, and hospital visitors. earliest date of onset of symptoms in an HCA cluster of case-patients. only significant values are shown. clusters ranged in size from 3 to 21 case-patients. each circle represents a case-patient. arrows connect case-patients with likely source of MERS-CoV infection. the source case-patient for cluster II (patient II-A; Figure 1) was a 68-year-old UAE resident who owned a farm and reported direct contact with camels. he had no travel history, no contact with a known case, and no healthcare facility contact during the 14 days before symptom onset. a secondary case-patient (patient II-B; Figure 1) who shared a room with the symptomatic source case-patient before the diagnosis subsequently developed respiratory symptoms. -patient for cluster III (patient III-A; Figure 1) was a 45-year-old expatriate who had no travel history, no animal contact, and no healthcare facility contact during the 14 days before symptom onset. he was assessed at an emergency department (ED) in Abu Dhabi on 3 occasions for fever, cough, shortness of breath, and pneumonia. he was admitted to a general medical unit (unit A), where he received care for 5 hours before being transferred to the intensive care unit attack rates among healthcare contacts with confirmed exposure to the source case-patient were estimated to be 16% (10/64 contacts) in the ED and radiology department before diagnosis and 5% (1/21 contacts) in the ICU after diagnosis. blue boxes indicate date of interaction between source case and healthcare providers. subsequent screening of 83 healthcare contacts of patient III-Q identified 2 healthcare-associated case-patients, including patient III-Q\u2019s daughter (patient III-R, tertiary case), and a nurse who provided care to patient III-Q in unit A (patient III-S, tertiary case) no cases were identified among the 50 additional healthcare contacts screened from Unit A. all 23 PCR-confirmed case isolates included in the validation sample were verified by using the N2 assay at CDC. genome sequences are similar (>99%) to other known MERS-CoV and clusters most closely with camel-derived MERS-CoV strains. 13 (93%) were exposed before the patient\u2019s diagnosis. the 1 HCW who became infected after caring for a recognized case-patient reported using gloves and N95 respirator masks during all patient care activities but did not consistently wear a gown. 14 healthcare workers were infected with MERS-CoV after caring for a source case-patient. 14 were infected with MERS-CoV after caring for a source case-patient. an additional 16 case-patients had worked at or visited a healthcare facility in the month before illness. 8 of the 16 excluded case-patients were HCWs with confirmed exposure to a symptomatic case-patient outside the healthcare setting. 38.5\u00b0C) 3 (100) 9 (33) 6 (32) 3 (50) 0 Shortness of breath 3 (100) 5 (19) 0 5 (83) 0 0.01 Fatigue/malaise 2 (67) 8 (30) 4 (21) 3 (50) 1 (50) Cough 2 (67) 7 (26) 4 (21) 3 (50) 0 Cough with sputum production 2 (67) 2 (7) 0 2 (33) 0 0.04 Rhinorrhea 2 HCA, healthcare-associated; HCWs, healthcare workers; MERS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; Signif, statistically significant. Source case-patients include HCWs, patients, and hospital visitors. healthcare-associated cases Of the 27 healthcare-associated case-patients, 17 (63%) were male. none had a history of camel exposure during the 14 days before symptom onset. disease severity varied by type of case; source case-patients had greatest disease severity. the source case-patient for cluster I (patient I-A; Figure 1) was an 82-year-old UAE resident who owned a farm with camels and had no travel history or contact with another case-patient. two days later, the patient was transferred by ambulance to another hospital 350 km away, where he tested positive for MERS-CoV. the source case-patient for cluster III (patient III-A; Figure 1) was a 45-year-old expatriate. he had no travel history, no contact with a known case, and no healthcare facility contact during the 14 days before symptom onset. a secondary case-patient (patient II-B; Figure 1) who shared a room with the symptomatic source case-patient subsequently developed respiratory symptoms. PCR screening of respiratory specimens from 224 possible healthcare contacts from the ED, ICU, and medical wards identified 15 healthcare-associated case-patients. ten were secondary case-patients who had exposure to the source case-patient during ED visits. 4 were tertiary case-patients among HCWs who had no exposure to the source case-patient but had confirmed exposure to infected co-workers in radiology. a second subcluster of illnesses was detected in unit A. a 74-year-old hospital patient (patient III-Q) who had been admitted to the unit in february developed new onset of shortness of breath on April 12. a second subcluster of illnesses was detected in unit A. 20 healthcare-associated cases are attributable to a single introduction in the hospital. a final case-patient who was also cared for in unit A was identified. the 40-year-old expatriate man was admitted to the hospital in february 2014 with shortness of breath and multiple concurrent conditions. cluster II, March\u2013April 2014 The source case-patient for cluster II (patient II-A; Figure 1) was a 68-year-old UAE resident who owned a farm and reported direct contact with camels. he had no travel history, no contact with a known case, and no healthcare facility contact during the 14 days before symptom onset. in march 2014, this patient was hospitalized in Abu Dhabi with respiratory symptoms; MERS-CoV was diagnosed 4 days later. PCR screening of respiratory specimens from 224 possible healthcare contacts identified 15 healthcare-associated case-patients. ten were secondary case-patients who had exposure to the source case-patient during ED visits. attacks among healthcare contacts with confirmed exposure to the source case-patient were estimated to be 16% (10/64 contacts) in the ED and radiology department before diagnosis and 5% (1/21 contacts) in the ICU after diagnosis. symptom onset is not listed; data exclude a secondary case with probable exposure (patient III-Q) a second subcluster of illnesses was detected in unit A (i.e., general medical unit of hospital of admission) when a 74-year-old patient (patient III-Q) who had been admitted to the unit in february developed new onset of shortness of breath on April 12. 20 healthcare-associated cases (12 secondary, 6 tertiary, and 2 quaternary) are attributable to a single introduction in the hospital. a final healthcare-associated case-patient who was also cared for in unit A was identified (patient V; Figure 1). this 40-year-old expatriate man was admitted to the hospital in february 2014. genome sequences are similar (>99%) to other known MERS-CoV and clusters most closely with camel-derived MERS-CoV strains (GenBank accession nos. KJ650295\u2013KJ650297) obtained in al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia, in 2013, suggesting potential camel origin. the variation table was generated on the basis of the full genome sequence described in the Methods section. Blank cells indicate no sequence difference. MERS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Case not associated with healthcare. for the source case from cluster II (patient II-A) is not considered related (11-nt difference) the non-healthcare-associated case from 2013 is even more divergent (30-nt difference). 13 (93%) were exposed before the patient\u2019s diagnosis. 1 HCW who became infected after caring for a recognized case-patient reported use of gloves and N95 respirator masks during all patient care activities. recalled an occasion when patient material contaminated her clothing. discussion MERS-CoV in healthcare settings accounts for >40% of all reported infections in Abu Dhabi. 1 patient directly infected 12 persons in 1 hospital, resulting in a total of 20 healthcare-associated infections caused by secondary, tertiary, and quaternary transmission. in the largest cluster, the source case-patient was placed under standard precautions, rather than contact and airborne precautions. the severity of illness associated with MERS-CoV infection among case-patients in our investigation ranged from asymptomatic to severe disease, as has been previously reported. we identified 3 instances in which transmission appears to have occurred from infected HCWs who reported no fever or symptoms of respiratory illness (patients III-B, III-G, and III-I) this investigation has several limitations. the healthcare clusters we describe are supported epidemiologically. MERS-CoV can clinically appear with mild or nonspecific respiratory symptoms. patients may seek care without having known risk factors for infection. maintaining a high index of suspicion in every patient encounter is imperative."}
