{"summary": "name-strings can be called on to discover, index, manage, and analyze accessible digital biodiversity information from multiple sources. Known impediments to the use of scientific names as metadata include synonyms, homonyms, mis-spellings, and the use of other strings as identifiers. the findings confirm the necessity for name-processing tools and the value of scientific names as a mechanism to interconnect distributed data. on-line resolution services will bring older scientific names up to date or convert surrogate name-strings to scientific names. occurrence of scientific names with incorrect authors is a quality-control issue in need of attention. names act as a system of metadata with which we can organize open distributed data in a biologically meaningful way. names act as a system of metadata with which we can organize open distributed data in a biologically meaningful way. projects such as LifeWatch, Atlas of Living Australia and especially Encyclopedia of Life rely on names to organize content. the most significant known challenge with the use of names as metadata is the \u2018many names for one taxon\u2019 problem. a search initiated with a single name-string may not find content that applies to a taxon because it was labelled with a different name. the two names are heterotypic (taxonomic or subjective) synonyms. the issue of two \u2018species\u2019 being found to be different stages in the life history of a single species is common among fungi that have sexual (teleomorph) and asexual (anamorph) reproductive stages. hypocrea jecorina and Trichoderma reesei are scientific names for the teleomorph and anamorphic states of a single fungus species, respectively. taxa may be distinguished using identifiers in the form of short molecular sequences or barcodes, or with data identifiers such as LSIDs or UUIDs. some name-strings include scientific elements, or may be part common names, part acronym, or part surrogate. some names may be mis-spelled, distorted because of OCR errors, inadvertently concatenated, or have alternate spellings. the Codes of Nomenclature seek to prevent homonyms by stipulating that when a name is used, it can never be used again for another taxon. the same name may be legitimately used for taxa of plants and animals (Peranema is a name for a fern and for a flagellate). the number of species-level homonyms is small (a few hundred) in the absence of agreement to use a unified code, transregnal homonyms will need to be disambiguated to avoid information on unrelated species being included among the results of a search using a homonymic name. chresonyms are references to scientific names as used by others. some taxonomists incorrectly include chresonyms in synonymy lists. other known problems with the use of names as metadata relate to their inability to discriminate among taxonomic concepts. this paper draws on several sources of names to quantify the types of challenges presented in the use of names. names.dmp file was downloaded from GenBank on 15th May 2015. it contained 1920102 records with four fields: (1) tax_id - the identifier of the node associated with this name, (2) name_txt - the name-string itself. DRYAD is the largest compilation of endorsed taxa. it contains over 33,000 data files relevant to biodiversity. the curation process does not include oversight of taxonomic names. GN-UUID creates UUID version 5 identifiers for name-strings. any environment will generate the same UUID as long as they agree on the generation of a name space. gn_uuid has a DNS domain defined as a name space. the parser is able to distinguish the use of the term \u2018Bison\u2019 as a genus, species, and subspecies. it removes variation among versions of name-strings for the same taxon. the primary use of the parser is to transform a name-string into a canonical version. anolis barkeri POWELL & BIRT 2001 and anolis barkeri POWELL 2001 are not code-compliant names and may be chresonyms that refer to the use of the name Anolis barkeri by Powell and by Powell and Birt. the process of canonicalization involves parsing a name and then removing non-latinized and non-essential elements. 'noisy' elements of a name include annotations or differences in heuristic rules designed specifically for scientific names to produce improved levels of recall, precision and execution time. the number of actions such as a character change, addition, deletion within the source name-string is referred to as 'Edit Distance' the tool is being described in more detail (Mozzherin et al., in prep.) the names derived from GenBank and DRYAD were cross-mapped against Catalogue of Life. each record in the source database was recorded as one of the following. the canonical form of a name in the source matched a canonical name in Catalogue of Life with an Edit Distance of 2-6. the source name-string would require 2-6 changes to match a name-string in Catalogue of Life. the match may be made to the identically spelled genus name for a monkey. an exact match of a uninomial genus name (Erigeron) adds one point to give a confidence score of 0.75. a match of a binomial name (Erigeron altaicus with Erigeron altaicus Popov) increases the probability significantly. results with scores of 0.5 and below need to be confirmed by a human check. Clade identifiable genus: the name-string includes the name of a genus but no subordinate taxa. such name-strings have some value to interconnect content in distributed data environments, but do so without full taxonomic detail. included in this class are name-strings that were well formed, or were not originally well formed but from which the scientific name-string could be extracted. names.dmp file contained 1920102 records with four fields: tax_id, name_txt, whiptail stingray, whiptail stingray, whiptail stingray, whiptail stingray, whiptail stingray, whiptail stingray, whiptail stingray, whiptail stingray, whiptail stingray, whiptail stingray, whiptail stingray, whiptail stingray, whiptail stingray, whiptail stingray, whiptail stingray it includes name-strings that relate to 1,606,554 species, 150,118 infraspecific taxa, 1,322,911 synonyms and 329,997 common names. CoL is believed to cover 70-84% of the (estimated) number of formally described species. gni.globalnames.org has access to 24 million name-strings of which 17,275,622 are visible at gni.globalnames.org. the content of GNI has, to date, been rendered into 7,695,783 reconciliation groups using algorithms. the \u2018biodiversity\u2019 global names parser (http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.45038) is a Ruby gem (https://github.com/GlobalNamesArchitecture/biodiversity/releases/tag/v3.4.1) that takes incoming name-strings and divides them into their semantic components. the parser is able to distinguish the use of the term \u2018Bison\u2019 as a genus, species anolis barkeri POWELL & BIRT 2001 and anolis barkeri POWELL 2001 are not code-compliant names and may be chresonyms that refer to the use of the name Anolis barkeri by Powell and by Powell and Birt. the process of canonicalization involves parsing a name and then removing non-latinized and non-essential elements. 'noisy' elements of a name include annotations or differences in Ruby Port fuzzy matcher is based on taxaMatch (Rees 2014) it is a biologically informed spell-checker that seeks to identify variant spellings that may be caused by typographical, transliteration, or OCR errors. as a result, it can identify Dorsophila melanogaster as being a variant of Drosophila melanogaster. the business rules of pre-processing can be adapted to suit each source. the tool is being described in more detail (Mozzherin et al., in prep.) Canonical form fuzzy match 1: The canonical form of a name in the source matched a canonical name in Catalogue of Life with an Edit Distance of 2-6. the source name-string would require 2-6 changes to match a name-string in Catalogue of Life. match may be made to the identically spelled genus name for a monkey. a sigmoid curve converts the sum of positive and negative points that increase or decrease (respectively) into a confidence value. points reflect features of name-strings which increase the likelihood of a correct match, and negative values to features that decrease it. a match of a binomial genus name (Erigeron altaicus with Erigeron altaicus Popov) increases the probability significantly. class adopted are: Clade identifiable species: the name-string includes the name of a species but not any subordinate taxa. such name-strings have some value to interconnect content in distributed data environments. included in this class are name-strings that were well formed, or were not originally well formed but from which the scientific name-string could be extracted. name-strings include an annotation such as cf., nec., aff., nr, null or other comments to indicate that the scientific elements of the name-string in the record do not identify the taxon in question. this category includes unresolvable acronyms, environmental samples without any taxonomic identity, abbreviated names, some organelles, idiosyncratic forms of name-strings. parts, and Blast names each account for less than 0.1% of GenBank content. 2% of acronym entries in GenBank are incorrectly classified scientific names. some acronyms end with a \u2018V\u2019 and refer to viruses. most of the 250,000 or so \u2018Authority\u2019 entries in GenBank duplicate scientific names without author information. most of the 250,000 or so \u2018Authority\u2019 entries in GenBank duplicate scientific names without author information. the second example illustrates one of the irregular forms of name-strings. na mucor miehei malaria parasite P. falciparum loosestrife family baboon argentina red shrim Equivalent name: Alternative names for a taxon which do not satisfy the nomenclatural requirements of synonymy. the 2,646 synonyms marked \u2018GenBank\u2019 are given priority for display purposes. they are assigned only if more than one synonymic latinized scientific names are in use for the same species. they are over 22,000 name-strings in this class. the class includes species, infraspecies, and higher taxon names, annotated names, negated names, scientific and non-scientific generic or higher taxon names, acronyms or strain numbers. the class includes species, infraspecies, and higher taxon names; annotated names, negated names, scientific and non-scientific generic or higher taxon names, acronyms or strain numbers. geneBank also includes a field 'GenBank unique name' that is used to disambiguate duplicates. most curatorial intrusions comply with nomenclatural and taxonomic expectations, but not all uniques are disambiguated. a high proportion (71%) of the 78,000 or so name-strings (4.1% of GenBank name-strings) relate to bacteria. a further 28% of type sequences relate to fungi. we reclassified GenBank content after canonicalization and removal of duplicates. the number of name-strings with same canonical form varied from 1 to 9,742 (Bacillus). 375,549 unique canonical name-strings were derived from them. this gives somewhat less than the number of species indicated by GenBank. some of these are names of junior synonyms and some are lexical variants of the same name. class verbatim Pre-processed Species 71.8 % 82.3 % Infraspecies 2.2 % 0.9 % Other scientific names 15.9 % 16 % Common 1.4 % 0.8 % Acronyms 4.4 % 0 % Presumably reflecting the absence of curation, many original name-strings in DRYAD are not well formed. not all length-adjusted strings are 10 characters long. Dilomasp - presumably for Diloma sp. each name-string was assigned to a single category. exact matches - only about 11-15% of the results fall into this class. canonicalization allows a further 50% (GenBank) to 76% (DRYAD) of the name-strings to be matched. udibacter propionicigenes JCM 13257 Paludibacter propionicigenes str. WB4 Paludibacter propionicigenes DSM 17365. annotations such as 'cf' in the first name-string are discussed by Bergstrom (Bergstrom 1988). emend. Abraham et al. 2008 matched to Phenylobacterium Hyphomicrobium Stutzer and Hartleb 1899 (sic) matched to Hyphomicrobium Brucella abortus matched to Brucella abortus. the following 4 pairs of name-strings with nomenclatural and taxonomic annotations are treated as identical after canonicalization. a loss of information associated with canonicalization is illustrated below. Acacia catechu (L.f.)Willd., Acacia catechu auct. non L., Acacia catechu auct. non Willd., and Acacia catechu (L.f.) willd. all had a canonical form exact match to Acacia catechu (L.f.) the exclusion of non-code-compliant names in taxonomic sources would address these errors. over 40,000 name-strings in GenBank began with Lepidoptera sp. BOLD had a canonical form exact match to Lepidoptera. i, Sphagnum austinii Sull., Sphagnum beringiense, Sphagnum beringiense A.J.Shaw, R.E.Andrus & B.Shaw, Sphagnum bordasii Besch., Sphagnum brasiliense, Sphagnum brasiliense Warnst., Sphagnum cribrosum, Sphagnum crispum R.E.Andrus, Sphagnum cymbifolioides, ycnocladum, Sphagnum pycnocladum Angstrom, Sphagnum sjorsii, Sphagnum tenerum Sull., Lesq. ex Sull., Sphagnum warnstorfii, Sphagnum warnstorfii Russow, Sphagnum wheeleri,Sphagnum wheeleri Muell.Hal. ablepharus boutonii africanus matched to ablepharus boutonii boettger, 1881, ablepharus boutonii Boettger, 1913, ablepharus boutonii Boulenger, 1887, ablepharus boutonii Boulenger, 1898, ablepharus boutonii Loveridge, 1934, ablepharus boutonii Mertens, 1930, ablepharus boutonii Mertens, 1931, ab the following examples illustrate inappropriate matches. the cross-mapping software incorrectly interprets hybrid notation or establishes matches to host names when the record relates to a symbiont. the most tolerant and correct match involved 6 differences. 80% of fuzzy matches based on a single error produced correct matches. truncate names, replace or transform characters. about 1,000 of the 14,000 common names in GenBank were matched to a scientific name. many were instances where the scientific name and common name are the same (Vicugna) some examples of matches between common names and scientific names follow with confidence scores. graminis Bibi et al. 2011 matched to Bacillus gracilis Schaum, 1862, Bacillus gracilis Burmeister, 1838, Bacillus gracilis (Gray, G.R., 1835) and to Bacillus gramineus Bates, 1865 Fuzzy matching works well if there is only one other name-string that differs by a single character. but this is not always the case, giving multiple errors in the following over a quarter (about 580,000) of the name-strings in GenBank failed to match to Catalogue of Life in any way. about 14% (74,000) of un-matched name-strings were of genera and about quarter (120,000) were higher taxon names. some names were names of familiar organisms (Plasmodium vivax), infraspecific taxa (Zygrhablithus bijugatus crassus) and negated names (Lithastrinus cf. moratus), and some taxonomic areas such as coccolithophorids (e.g. Zygrhablithus bijugatus and a mis-spelled variant of that name) were strongly represented among the infraspecific name-strings represent 1-2% of the content of the sources. 1b. Species. Slightly more than 760,000 unique name-strings from GenBank and almost 6,000 from DRYAD were identified as referring to species. more than 260,000 name-strings from GenBank and almost 550 from DRYAD include scientific names above the rank of genus or have a non-scientific name that can be reconciled to a scientific name for a clade. about 150,000 name-strings in Genbank, and 6 in DRYAD include scientific names above the rank of genus. the use of terms like virus, viroid, phage, sometimes with host or symptoms. higher taxon name endings such as -viridae, -virinae and many acronyms that include 'v' relate to viruses. only about 260 of the unique common name-strings from GenBank found a common-name match in Catalogue of Life. common names can be placed into a number of subclasses. some common names identify a species. when these are included within reconciliation structures, they will be reconcilable to a scientific name of a terminal taxon. symbionts About 6,000 name-strings relating to symbionts may include two scientific names that can lead to matches with the wrong name. there are over 1,800 references to bacterial phytoplasmas, but there is considerable variety as to how the names for them are presented. hessleri gill endosymbiont Incompatibility symbiont of Nasonia vitripennis Chlorella symbiont of Hydra viridis Wolbachia endosymbiont 1 of Acromyrmex octospinosus 'Ipomoea pes-caprae' little leaf phytoplasma Onion yellows phytoplasma Phytoplasma sp. onion yellows Oni the most common form is to include a symbol that looks like a multiplication sign; but a variety of differently encoded characters can look similar. the same characters can be used in other ways, such as to indicate an un-named species. typographic error for Erysimum odoratum (Populus alba x Populus glandulosa) x Populus tomentosa tetraploid red crucian carp x blunt snout bream Gerbera hybridcultivar Malus x domestica is a natural hybrid. 100,000 name-strings were deemed to be \u2018not useful\u2019 because they contained no direct, indirect, or discoverable reference to a taxon a class of about 750 unique name-strings in GenBank do not include reference to a taxon, or if they do, the taxon in question is negated. 'aff' is a firmer indication that the taxon studied is NOT the one that is referred to. numbered names are name-strings that begin with numbers. they fall outside the conventions of scientific names. they contain no information that would lead to one or more terminal taxa. the most common was to interpolate an underscore character (in about 5,000 name-strings, mostly from DRYAD) there is an overlap with the class where generic names are not included. some sources offer a supplementary file that translates the terms into taxa. more than 17,000 name-strings include reference to strains. about 9,400 lacked taxonomic information and were classified as 'not useful' some include reference to a recognizable data-source (below, UTEX and ATCC) and we presume they can be linked to additional data through that unique source:strain identifier. about 600 name-strings included the term \u2018plasmid\u2019. some name-strings from GenBank provide some explanatory molecular context, but without adding a taxonomic identifier. 257,702 species name-strings and 20,566 infraspecies matched entries in Catalogue of Life. 92.1% of terminal taxa identified as species found a match. only 5.8% were un-matched. only 1,905 unique canonical name-strings were common to GenBank, Catalogue of Life and the processed DRYAD name-strings. some problems could be addressed with improved discipline regarding conventions of using names by data sources and applying appropriate business rules. inverted commas indicate non-code-compliance 'Geophagus' steindachneri - inverted commas indicate non-code-compliance 'Formosa crassostrea' - inverted commas indicate non-code-compliance 'Phlomobacter' - inverted commas indicate a subtaxon Hyperolius viridiflavus subsp. 'ngorongoro' 'Flagelliformis' (Platycladus orientalis flagelliformis) is a non-capitalized genus name. some of the software relies on capital at the start of a genus name to identify latin names. some of the software relies on the capital at the start of a genus name to identify latin names. the rules of nomenclature for bacteria are challenging and require the availability of a culture of the taxon in question. the rules of nomenclature for bacteria are challenging and require, among other things, the availability of a culture of the taxon in question. chresonyms are formed when scientific names are coupled with the names and dates of authors who are not the authors of the basionym nor combination but who referred to the organism. in some taxonomic areas, chresonyms are incorrectly included in synonymy lists. 87 Naja haje Peters, 1854 Naja haje Fischer, 1885 Naja haje Scortecci, 1932 Naja haje Bogert, 1943 Naja haje Hallowell, 1857 Naja haje Wallach Et Al., 2009 Naja haje Valverde, 1989 Naja haje anchietae, and Naja haje arabica Scortecci 1932 match to the same bundle of name-strings because those subspecies, not included in corchorus aestuans Blanco Corchorus aestuans forssk. chrosonym problems tend to be associated with particular taxonomic areas. the problem arises from conventions used in particular global Species Databases that contribute to the Catalogue of Life. a hybrid marked by the parentheses is hybridized with another species. double square brackets indicate the taxon referred to using an identifier from some organization. spergillus glaber]] CBS 492.91 [Chrysosporium botryoides]] [Arthrographis alba]] CBS 370.92 ATCC 35419 [[Bacteroides suis]] Parentheses are sometimes used to indicate a synonym. in this case, two name-strings are used to refer to the same aphid. ta vivipara Fejervryi, 1923 Lacerta vivipara Mayer, Bhme, Tiedemann & Bischoff, 2000 11.

Barker 1956 (Approved Lists 1980), nom. cons., emend. 2% of acronym entries in GenBank are incorrectly classified scientific names. many acronyms end with a \u2018V\u2019 and refer to viruses. some virus acronyms are classified as scientific names. there are 347 anamorph names and 194 teleomorph names. most of the 250,000 or so \u2018Authority\u2019 entries in GenBank duplicate scientific names without author information. the second example illustrates one of the irregular forms of name-strings. geneBank includes about 21,000 equivalent names, about 1.1% of the GenBank name-strings. most are V-acronyms and are treated in this study as names of viruses. some scientific names are incorrectly included in this class. the 2,646 synonyms marked \u2018GenBank\u2019 are given priority for display purposes. they are over 22,000 name-strings in this class (1.2% of GenBank name-strings) many of which include a scientific name and an acronym or strain identifier. the class includes species, infraspecies, and higher taxon names, annotated names, negated names, scientific and non-scientific generic or higher taxon names. the class includes species, infraspecies, and higher taxon names; annotated names, negated names, scientific and non-scientific generic or higher taxon names, acronyms or strain numbers. GenBank also includes a field \u2018GenBank unique name\u2019 that is used to disambiguate duplicates. most curatorial intrusions comply with nomenclatural and taxonomic expectations, but not all uniques are disambiguated. the term is not used strictly in the nomenclatural sense because the majority of name-strings are scientific names. the list includes many strings that are not Code-compliant. a high proportion of the 78,000 or so name-strings (4.1% of GenBank name-strings) relate to bacteria. to 2,335 unique name-strings, the most common duplicated strings were: environmental samples (3990), no culture available (37), algae (21), Algerian barb (13), tsetse fly (13), mycorrhizal samples (11), tsetse fly (13), tsetse fly (13), tsetse fly (13), mycorrhizal samples (11), strain S1 (10) and Rhodotorula (10). the number of name-strings with the same canonical form varied from 1 to 9,742 (Bacillus) GenBank has 12,034 name-strings that include the string Bacillus; those without a species name will yield \u2018Bacillus\u2019 as the canonical form. class Verbatim Pre-processed Species 71.8 % 82.3 % Infraspecies 2.2 % 0.9 % Other scientific names 15.9 % 16 % Common 1.4 % 0.8 % Acronyms 4.4 % 0 % Other names 4.3 % 0 % Presumably reflecting the absence of curation, many original names in DRYAD are not well formed.

Fuzzy matching seeks to overcome impediments to matching that are caused by errors that may, for example, truncate names, replace or transform characters. 80% of fuzzy matches based on a single error produced correct matches, so improve the potential for interoperability. about 1,000 of the 14,000 common names in GenBank were matched to a scientific name. many were instances where the scientific name and common name are the same (Vicugna) some examples of matches between common names and scientific names follow with confidence scores. taeniata matched to Bothrops taeniatus Wagler, 1824 and to Bothrops taeniatus Kornacker, 1999 both with a confidence score of 0.75. taeniata matched to Bacillus gracilis Schaum, 1862, Bacillus gracilis Burmeister, 1838, Bacillus gracilis (Gray, G.R., 1835), and to Bacillus gramineus B over a quarter (about 580,000) of the name-strings in GenBank failed to match to Catalogue of Life in any way. about 14% (74,000) of un-matched name-strings were of genera and about quarter (120,000) were higher taxon names. s from DRYAD failed to match to Catalogue of Life. 60% were names of terminal taxa, 15% were names of higher taxa. some were names of familiar organisms (Plasmodium vivax) and negated names. nat, nothosubsp., convar., pseudovar., sect., ser., subvar., subf., race,,,,,, a, b, c, d, e, g, k, **, and * are infraspecific ranks. more than 760,000 unique name-strings from GenBank and almost 6,000 from DRYAD were identified as referring to species. more than 260,000 name-strings from GenBank and almost 550 from DRYAD include scientific names above the rank of genus or have a non-scientific name that can be reconciled to a scientific name for a clade. some negated species names may or may not include authors and annotations. about 150,000 name-strings in Genbank, and 6 in DRYAD, relate to viruses. some are latinized names, but the majority are not. some are latinized names, but the majority are not. common names can be placed into a number of subclasses. some common names identify a species. when these are included within reconciliation structures, they will be reconcilable to a scientific name of a terminal taxon. the language in use is not specified, and this adds an additional problem in the reconciliation of common language names. maltese cross mayo Medics similar frog Tasmania townhall clock Occasional common names are concatenated. hessleri gill endosymbiont Incompatibility symbiont of Nasonia vitripennis Chlorella symbiont of Hydra viridis Wolbachia endosymbiont of Acromyrmex octospinosus 'Ipomoea pes-caprae' little leaf phytoplasma Onion yellows phytoplasma Phytoplasma sp. onion yellows Onion name-strings that relate to hybrids often involve two names. this can lead to incorrect matching of names. the most common form is to include a symbol that looks like a multiplication sign. avzevii Nepenthes xhookeriana - a natural hybrid in this genus of pitcher plants Erysimum x oderatum - may be a typographic error for Erysimum odoratum (Populus alba x Populus glandulosa) x Populus tomentosa tetraploid red crucian carp x blunt snout bream. a class of about 750 unique name-strings in GenBank do not include reference to a taxon, or if they do, the taxon in question is negated.

'ngorongoro' - inverted commas indicate a host 'DiaphantaX' chryseres. some of the software relies on capital at the start of a genus name to identify latin names. litoria ewingii and litoria moorei (Australia\u2019s whistling tree and motorbike frogs) lack capitalization and are missed by GN tools concentricavalva. ursirivus it is not clear if this is a species name without a genus, or a genus without a capital. other entries make it clear that it is a genus without a capital. the rules of nomenclature for bacteria are challenging and require the availability of a culture of the taxon in question. conventions have appeared to allow names to be presented even when they are not fully compliant with the relevant code. one solution is to refer to the taxon as 'candidatus' (Murray and Stackebrandt 1995); another is to use inverted commas to indicate the name is not yet code-compliant. Naja haje annulifera, Naja haje anchietae, and Naja haje arabica Scortecci 1932 match to the same bundle of name-strings. a second example, also a reptile, is Cnemidophorus sackii stictogrammus Burger 1950 which matches to: Cnemidophorus sackii. corchorus aestuans L. Corchorus aestuans L. Corchorus aestuans Herb. ex Wall. Corchorus aestuans Blanco Corchorus aestuans Forssk. chrosonym problems tend to be associated with particular taxonomic areas. parentheses are used to indicate a hybrid. it is more common to encounter this format with plant names. it is more common to encounter this format with plant names. double parentheses are used to indicate type material in GenBank. in this case, two name-strings are used to refer to the same aphid. names converted from one encoding to another incorrectly will have problems. some of the entries are name-strings that cannot be linked to other content. 400,000 unique canonicalized name-strings from GenBank relate to terminal taxa. 82% could be matched to entries in Catalogue of Life, but only after processing. this confirms potential and practicality of a name-based cyber-infrastructure to interconnect digital data on biodiversity. a large number of 'tips' are not named species, but are entities labelled with molecular identifiers. a growing number of entities will either not be given any name or will have interim names identified as such with the term \u2018candidatus\u2019 or other marker. the integration process should include the mapping of molecular identifiers to species. this requires a continuing investment in routine sequencing of voucher material. the name-strings should be dereferenceable to the associated sequence data. reconciliation services should include common names so that content labelled with scientific names can be accessed through common-to-scientific name reconciliation. standardized names compilations promote consistency and provide gold-standard material for the last step in reconciliation - that of name resolution. the name-string contains information that may allow greater accuracy to be achieved through a cross-link to external sites. we recommend that ecologists improve taxonomic skills and preserve voucher specimen specimens for subsequent confirmation of identification. some taxonomic areas are well represented in some sources but not others. GenBank is predictably rich in information about viruses and prokaryotes. some areas - such as Melaleuca (oddly), viruses, algae, other protists, and other prokaryotes - are poorly represented. the taxonomic community will be unable to comply with the code for anything more than a tiny minority of the revealed diversity. surrogates and interim names do and will have high value as pointers to information, ideally in a standard form. this task may also fall to the compilers of sequence data. Synonymy lists vary in quality, containing different spellings, chresonyms, and taxonomic statements such as pro. parte. and sensu auctt. chresonyms are instances of heterotypic (=subjective or taxonomic) synonyms. 43,000 unique name-strings matched 15 variants of ablepharus boutonii africanus. some matches will result from canonical matching of species and subspecies. homonyms match if canonical forms of names are used. concepts. 315 name-strings contained the term \u2018sensu\u2019. this indicates that the entry refers to a more precisely defined taxon than is achieved with the name-string alone. the same is indicated by the term \u2018sec.\u2019. of the 1.9 million unique name-strings in GenBank, about 1.61 million are scientific names. of the 1.9 million unique names in GenBank, about 1.61 million are scientific names, of which only 219,216 match to Catalogue of Life. canonicalization may result in access to additional information. fizzy matching tools were introduced to address variant spellings, mis-spellings or OCR errors. performance is about 80% satisfactory with an edit distance of \u20181\u2019 - meaning that one in five matches is incorrect. cross-checks against multiple taxonomically endorsed data sources are desirable to eliminate such matches. the next level of performance is a perfect match of the canonical versions of the terminal taxa. the cross mapper can call upon users to alert users to the possibility of a homonym. cross-mapping tool has been released with additional functionality to address issues with synonyms. new version (0.1.8) of cross-mapping tool has been released with additional functionality to address issues with synonyms. lists of homonymic taxa are already available from IRMNG. list would include terms such as \u2018symbiont\u2019, \u2018host\u2019, \u2018parasite\u2019, or similar term; inclusion of \u2018of\u2019, \u2018ex\u2019 or \u2018from\u2019, or the use of inverted commas. the data may not be downloaded or replicated by any means, manually or mechanically, including copying and pasting into theses, papers and other publications. any copying of the data or images without the written permission of the copyright owner (generally AlgaeBase) may result in legal action, including legal action involving the service provider or publisher. annotation Annotation systems allow comments to be added to data objects. a generic system is hypothes.is. two systems are being applied to biology, Filtered Push and AnnoSys. the first element would be an open and highly visible tool based on the Global Names Recognition and Discovery algorithmcapable of identifying names in many formats such as text documents, pdf files, spreadsheets, lists, and images. it would then report if the name is known to preferred taxonomic authorities, if it is a senior synonym, if it is spelled correctly, if it has the right authority information, or if it needs to be updated. a URI (a pointer to a location accessible through the Internet coupled with a UUID) is seen as a good though not flawless solution. the use of a shared algorithm to generate the same UUID for a name-string enables data providers to locally mint the same identifiers for identical strings and avoid dependence on services. users should adopt scientific names where possible for terminal taxa. authors should limit themselves to canonical versions of names. validation tools should add URIs to the names. a growing number of entities will either not be given any name, or will have interim names identified as such with the term \u2018candidatus\u2019 or other marker. it is urgent that molecular identifiers and names are managed together as alternative tokens for taxa, a point addressed for fungi. only 152 of the unique common name-strings from GenBank found a common-name match in Catalogue of Life. about 1,000 common names matched to a scientific name, but many were instances where the scientific name and common name are the same. common names need to be identifiable as such so that names-management tools do not confuse common names with scientific names. standardized lists promote consistency and provide gold-standard material for the last step in reconciliation - that of name resolution. some of the 500,000 unique canonicalized scientific name-strings in GenBank will have been introduced for managerial or navigational purposes. about 400 names-strings relating to scientific names in DRYAD lacked the genus name (S hangoei and virescens) about one in 20 names-strings in both GenBank and DRYAD contained no taxonomically useful information. the virus Code differs in character to codes for plants, animals, and prokaryotes. the challenge of managing information about viruses can only be achieved with an open compilation of all names and name-strings that point to viruses and their inclusion with comprehensive lists of names. the need for interim names and surrogates is a result of the stringent requirements in the code for nomenclature of prokaryotes. y / chresonymy / ambiregnal taxa: Synonyms are needed to develop reconciliation groups that are the essence of a names-based infrastructure. fishBase assessed the ratio closer to 30:10, the estimate for fungi is 17 synonymous names for 10 species, slime moulds have 20 synonyms for 10 species. chresonyms are a combination of the latinized components of the scientific name together with the author of the paper in which the name is used. such uses do not comply with codes of nomenclature, and so should not be included in synonymy lists. chresonyms inflate perceived matching of lists. more than one set of nomenclatural rules may be applied to some groups of microalgae. Cyanobacteria may be subject to botanical or bacterial conventions. euglenids, dinoflagellates, stramenopiles, collar flagellates, cryptophytes. the approach is sensitive to taxonomic completeness and conventions of sources under comparison. the use of concepts draws attention to finer granularity than can be achieved with names on their own. the unambiguous definition of concepts by reference to defining characteristics will be needed if they are to be used in organizing biodiversity information. Canonicalization may remove some terms that either negate or clarify the name-string: Acacia catechu auct. non Willd., matching to Acacia catechu willd. performance is about 80% satisfactory with an edit distance of \u20181\u2019. one in five matches is incorrect. a capital letter were the cause of failures to fuzzily match names from which the first letter missing. the approach should be limited to canonical elements to eliminate the consequences of noise in author and date information. knowledge of Latin and Greek grammar - such as gender compliance - may be used to discriminate among results. cross-checks against multiple taxonomically endorsed data sources are desirable to eliminate such matches. the next level of performance is a perfect match of the terminal taxa. there is a small level of risk of homonyms. the global names architecture is seen as a system to draw on such sources to provide valuable services to the users of names. such data can be used to disambiguate ambiguous results, filter or corroborate insights. lists of scientific names that also occur in plain language dictionaries - such as Bison, Cafeteria, or Torpedo. list would include terms such as \u2018symbiont\u2019, \u2018host\u2019, \u2018parasite\u2019, or similar term. inclusion of \u2018of\u2019, \u2018ex\u2019, \u2018ex\u2019, or \u2018from\u2019, or the use of inverted commas. copyright refers only to original works of creative art, not to data. the data claimed to be under copyright by algaebase is not so covered. a generic system is hypothes.is. annotation tools can be activated by mouse-overs or embedded in editing environments. annotations can accompany the data object, be made visible to the data source or supplier of the digital object. it provides a mechanism for quality control based on users will target content in use. the name-string extension of GNRD demonstrates that anchors can be added to name-strings in sources, and outbound links added to make the names in documents actionable. the second component is to add UUIDs to name-strings and/or to register identifiers if they already exist. github.com/GlobalNamesArchitecture/GlobalNamesArchitecture.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2015-05-31-gn-uuid-0-5-0.md. the third element is to embed the UUIDs in reconciliation groups. a fourth component is an annotation system that enables users to comment on all name-strings in use. validation tools should add URIs to names. authors contributed to conceptualization, data acquisition and analysis."}
