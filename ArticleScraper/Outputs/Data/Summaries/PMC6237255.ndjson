{"summary": "bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is an important paramyxoviral pathogen of cattle, causing primary pneumonia in animals of all ages, and predisposing to secondary bacterial infections in the bovine respiratory disease complex. despite proven efficacy, it remains in the lore of the veterinary profession that inactivated BRSV vaccines are generically ineffective and harmful (2). heterologous prime-boost method of immunization uses different forms of an antigen administered by different routes to broaden and extend immune responses. it was the purpose of this study to address these issues related to induction and duration of immunity to BRSV in cattle that were reared under conditions that were essentially those of a commercial beef operation. the remaining 25 calves were not vaccinated. serum was collected via jugular venipuncture for measurement of BRSV-specific IgG. at approximately 2 mo of age, 24 (1 calf died within a few days of birth and had no signs of respiratory disease or other disease at gross postmortem) all 75 cow-calf pairs were weaned at approximately 4 mo after parenteral vaccination when they were 6 to 7 mo old. at this time, 9 IN/MLV-boosted calves and 9 IN/inactivated boosted calves were randomly selected from their respective treatment groups. the 20 calves were challenged on the day of weaning as previously described. the calves were assessed on day 0 immediately before BRSV inoculum challenge and on days 1 through 14 after challenge. the calves were not confined in a chute system during observation except on days 0, 5 and 7 when sampling was required. calves were treated with 6 mL of tulathromycin (Draxxin; Zoetis Canada) at the end of the trial, on day 7, calves were treated with 6 mL of tulathromycin (Draxxin; Zoetis Canada) at the end of the trial, on day 7, calves were treated with 6 mL of tulathromycin. serum samples, and BRSV-specific IgA (ELISA) for nasal secretions were performed and analyzed as previously described (7,11) in a single set of assays performed at the end of the study to reduce inter-assay variation. data were analyzed to determine if there was a difference between the 2 treatment groups in the change of BRSV-specific IgG from baseline (Day 0, just prior to challenge) to Day 5 after challenge. total incidents of observed coughing were summed in the same way for a total cough score. the higher the score, the more clinical signs of disease, or the more coughing that was present. a Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons. ted calves were boosted with a parenteral combination modified-live virus (MLV) vaccine containing BRSV, bovine parainfluenza virus-3 (BPIV-3), bovine herpes virus-1 (BHV-1) and bovine virial diarrhea virus (BVDV) types 1 and 2. the other 25 calves that were not neonatally vaccinated received a parenteral combination inactivated vaccine containing BRSV, BPIV-3, BHV-1 two control calves (229 kg and 247 kg) were randomly selected from their respective treatment groups. the 20 calves were challenged on the day of weaning as previously described. the challenge inoculum consisted of a lung wash obtained from a newborn calf infected with BRSV. calves were euthanized immediately if they were observed with severe respiratory distress, for example, pronounced open-mouthed, labored breathing (as evidenced by an expiratory grunt) if they were severely depressed and recumbent with reluctance to rise, or if they had PaO2 60 mmHg. mL of tulathromycin (Draxxin; Zoetis Canada) was observed for another 7 d to ensure recovery prior to return to the herd. postmortem analysis On necropsy the respiratory tract was harvested and percent pneumonic lung for each lung lobe was assessed visually. 2 values were normally distributed and were analyzed using a 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) the results were presented as the mean and standard deviation. 3.3 0.0 to 5.2 Challenge Day 5 IN/MLV-boosted 3.5 0.37 to 12.9 IN/inactivated-boosted 4.1 0.0 to 20.2 Challenge Day 7 IN/MLV-boosted 1.9 0.05 to 12.9 IN/inactivated-boosted 5.0 0.11 to 14.2 BRSV serum neutralization titers (geometic means) all statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows V. 23 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA) results Clinical signs and mortality Eighteen of the 20 calves developed signs of mild respiratory disease after aerosol challenge with BRSV that were reflected in low total clinical scores (P = 0.76) there were no statistically significant differences between the boosted groups with regard to total clinical scores (P = 0.76) there were no statistically significant differences between the boosted groups in number of calves shedding or amount of BRSV shed (P > 0.67) paO2 and pneumonic lesions. the 2 calves that required euthanasia, a control and an IN/MLV-boosted calf had PaO2 concentrations of 47 mmHg and 46 mmHg. the lungs in these calves had lesions characteristic of acute BRSV infection. ma by BRSV-stimulated blood leukocytes was variable and not significantly (P = 1.0) different between treatment groups (IN/inactivated-boosted calves median: 2.9 pg/mL, range: 0 to 51 pg/mL; IN/MLV-boosted calves median: 2.2 pg/mL), range: 0 to 51 pg/mL. IN/MLV-boosted group is activated-boosted than the IN/MLV-boosted group. BRSV serum specific IN/MLV-boosted 76.7 56.0 to 99.7 0.04 IgG 24 h old (1st vaccination) bovine respiratory syncytial virus-specific (IgA) nasal antibodies (as determined by ELISA) were low ( 14 units) and were not significantly different between the 2 boosted groups between days 0 and 7. in nasal secretions none of the calves had detectable BRSV on the day of weaning/challenge ( 10 PFU/mL) on day 5, the number of calves shedding BRSV was similar in both groups, with 6 IN/MLV-boosted calves and 5 IN/inactivated-boosted calves shedding 10 PFU/mL of virus. the 2 control calves shed 360 and 340 PFU of virus per mL on day 5. neonatally primed calves received either modified-live or inactivated combination BRSV vaccines as booster immunizations at 2 mo of age. lungs from a passively immune calf developed severe respiratory disease. BRSV-specific IgG antibodies between birth ( 24 h old) and 2 mo of age were significantly higher in the IN/inactivated-boosted group. only 1 calf in the IN/MLV-boosted group had a biologically significant increase (2 to 32 ELISA units; Figure 4) after challenge exposure to BRSV. 16.8 Change in BRSV specific IgA from day 5 to day 7 IN/MLV-boosted 1.5 4.5 to 11.5 IN/inactivated-boosted 2.2 14.5 0.73 Change in BRSV specific IgA from day 5 to day 7 IN/MLV-boosted 0.27 9.41 to 13.0 0.83 IN/inactivated-boosted 2.4 11.3 to 7.0 BRSV neutralization titers (NT) two previous studies examined antibody responses in neonatally primed commercially reared beef calves that were boosted homologously with the same MLV form of BRSV. a challenge of immunity was performed in those studies, limiting conclusions that could be drawn. a single dose of a combination MLV vaccine was given at 2 mo of age in the face of decayed but not absent passive immunity. the calves in the IN/inactivated-boosted group, in the face of maternal antibodies, had this response. the inactivated vaccine formulation preserved epitopes that stimulate functionally important antibody responses. in this study, we previously obtained inconsistent results when measuring IgA in BRSV-vaccinated and/or exposed cattle (2). it may be attributable to the relative brevity of mucosal memory for IgA production in the absence of repeated mucosal exposure to the virus. inhibition or blocking of primary antibody responses by maternal antibodies is a well-documented phenomenon of neonatal immunology. the results of this study suggest that boosting of already primed (secondary) responses by parenteral MLV vaccines can also be at least partially blocked by residual maternal antibodies in calves with good passive transfer. some studies have reported various T-cell responses to BRSV following vaccination IFOMA (2,18); however, scant data associating these mostly in vitro responses with clinical immunity in virus-challenged animals. xoviruses predict that the responses to BHV-1 and BVDVs would be similar to those to BRSV. there are no commercial intranasal vaccines for mucosal priming of young calves. equivalence would have significant impact on safe use of combination vaccines around and during pregnancy. commonly used parenteral combination viral MLV and inactivated vaccines were administered as boosters at the traditional time of handling of calves for a first vaccination. overall, the inactivated immunogen engendered better clinical immunity, including relevant anamnestic antibody responses."}
