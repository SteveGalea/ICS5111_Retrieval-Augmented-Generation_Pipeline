{"summary": "the most frequent complications of influenza are secondary bacterial pneumonia. the aim of this work was to study the acute phase proteins (APP) responses after coinfection of piglets with H1N1 swine influenza virus (SwH1N1). the acute phase response is an unspecific systemic reaction of the organism that occurs after infection or inflammation. the reaction includes changes in the concentration of some plasma proteins called acute phase proteins (APPs) [2,5] no studies related to the APP behavior following influenza virus and Pm have been reported. C-reactive protein (CRP), haptoglobin (Hp), serum amyloid A (SAA) or/and pig major acute phase protein (Pig-MAP) responses after simultaneous co-infection with common porcine pathogens were evaluated. correlation between concentration of investigated APP in serum and severity of infection were also studied. in control pigs total number of leukocytes ranged from 17.04 109/l at 0 dpi to 26.64 109/l at 5 dpi (p0.05) in control pigs total number of leukocytes ranged from 17.65 109/l to 18.02 109/l. the number of lymphocytes remained relatively stable. cells, lymphocytes and granulocytes (A) and percentage of lymphocytes and granulocytes (B) in pigs coinfected with swine influenza virus (H1N1) and Pasteurella multocida. the HI titre ranged from 80 to 160. sera from control pigs had no antibody titres (20 HI titre) no viral RNA was detected in lungs on day 10 post inoculation. results of the bacterial isolation, identification of Pm genes encoding DNT with the use of the PCR technique, and results of the real-time RT-PCR assay. investigated APP increased significantly after coinfection, with mean maximum concentration from day 2 to 3. concentrations of CRP, Hp, SAA and Pig-MAP in serum of pigs before and at various time points after intranasal coinfection. a significant increase of SAA after coinfection was observed only at 2 and 3 dpi (p0.05) the mean peak level reached 155.20 38.93 g/ml, this was almost 40-fold higher compared to day 0-level. from 5 dpi the SAA concentration had decreased and did not differ from those observed in control animals. pigs coinfected with swine influenza subtype H1N1 virus and Pasteurella multocida. clinical score ranged between 1 and 5 in the control pigs. 0 dpi to 15.77 109/l at 5 dpi and then decreased to 10.35 at 10 dpi. the mean percentages of lymphocytes were the lowest at 3 and 5 dpi. on day 0 the percentage of lymphocytes reached over 60%. real-time RT-PCR assay used to confirm presence of SIV in nasal swabs revealed positive results from all infected pigs between 2 and 5 dpi. at 7 dpi positive results were found only in 2 out of 6 infected pigs. dpi Nasal swabs Lung M gene of SIV- PCR 0 0/10 n/a 2 10/10 n/a 3 10/10 (++) 2/2 5 8/8 (+) 2/2 7 2/6 (+) n/a 10 0/6 0/6 Pm -reisolation 0 0/10 n/a 3 6/10 0/2 5 6/8 2/2 7 4/6 n/a 10 4/6 2/6 DNT Pm - significant difference, as compared to control animals, were seen between 1 and 3 dpi. the maximum mean level was observed at 2 dpi and reached 153.92 50.50 g/ml (over 8-fold increase) the mean concentrations of CRP did not differ significantly from that observed in control pigs. the maximum mean concentration of Pig-MAP, observed at 3 dpi in coinfected piglets, was almost 4 times higher as compared to day 0-level. from 10 dpi the Pig-MAP concentrations had decreased and did not differ significantly between control and infected pigs. the highest mean concentrations of Hp were observed at 3 dpi. the mean peak level was over 4-fold higher as compared to the mean preinoculation concentration. the most frequent complications of influenza are secondary bacterial pneumonia. Pasteurella multocida is considered to be an opportunistic invader that could be cleared from the lungs of normal pigs [13], but SIV-induced damage to the respiratory tract reduced ability to clear the infection. concentrations of CRP, Hp, SAA and Pig-MAP significantly increased before specific antibodies were detected. but in Pm monoinfection the concentration of CRP was higher, as compared to control pigs, only at 2 dpi. the APP response was observed earlier than in co-infected pigs. the mean induction levels of most APP were higher in co-infected animals. it seems that SIV and Pm co-infection contributes to exacerbate pulmonary lesions. the serum levels of other cytokines stimulating production of APP by hepatocytes were under the limit of detection. rapid disappearance of IL-6 from serum could also explain a fast drop in APP concentrations during to the preinoculation levels in only SIV infected piglets. the highest concentrations of all investigated APP were observed from 2 to 3 dpi, before specific antibodies in serum were present. the highest concentrations of all investigated APP were observed from 2 to 3 dpi, before specific antibodies in serum were present. piglets were housed at the animal facility in two independent units. one for the control and one for the infected pigs. animal use and handling protocols approved by local Ethical Commission. the remaining pigs were euthanized and necropsied at 10 dpi. clinical and pathological examination Rectal temperatures were assessed daily and clinical signs of disease were recorded. apical lobe 10%, cardiac lobe 10%, diaphragmatic lobe 30%. changes in intermediate lobe scored as 5%. all recorded scores were then added together to determine final lung score. antibodies against SIVs were measured using a commercial ELISA test (PMT ELISA, Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) according to the manufacturer\u2019s specification. all sera were tested in serial twofold dilutions starting at 1:20. no evidence of pleuropneumonia, streptococcosis and atrophic rhinitis was recorded. animals were also tested for serum antibodies against dermonecrotic toxin (anti-DNT Ab) produced by Pm. experimental design On day 0, ten piglets were inoculated with SwH1N1 and Pm. inoculations of 107.3 TCID50 of SwH1N1 and 3108 CFU of toxigenic Pm were given intranasally. snouts sectioned at the upper first premolar tooth at necropsy. normal turbinates were graded as 0. Normal turbinates were graded as 0. Moderate atrophy of not less than half of the turbinates was graded at 2. Severe atrophy of the dorsal and ventral scrolls was graded as 3. Lung score Lungs were assessed according to the scheme described by Christensen et al. the standard bacteriological methods were used for detection of Pm in the nasal swabs and lung samples. samples were streaked onto agar containing 5% horse blood and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C in 7.5% CO2 atmosphere. serum samples were tested in duplicate. samples were diluted as follows: 1:1000 for CRP, 1:35000 for Hp, 1:500 for SAA and 1:1000 for Pig-MAP. the HI assay were performed using 0.5% chicken erythrocytes and 4HA units of strains SwH1N1 virus. all sera were tested in serial twofold dilutions, starting at 1:20. all authors have read and approved the final manuscript. authors wish to thank Barbara Frcek and Monika Grzesiak for excellent technical assistance."}
