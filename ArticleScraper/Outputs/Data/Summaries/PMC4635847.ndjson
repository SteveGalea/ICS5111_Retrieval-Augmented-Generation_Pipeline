{"summary": "there are approximately 145 cases of intoxication reported each year. there is currently no licensed vaccine to prevent botulinum poisoning. five of the 8 serotypes are known to cause human disease. the toxin then causes proteolytic degradation of the proteins responsible for the release of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. the prevention of neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic nerve terminals results in muscular paralysis. the only treatments for botulinum intoxication are post-exposure antibody-based therapies. DNA vaccines targeting the receptor-binding domain (HC) might represent an effective prophylactic vaccine to prevent botulinum poisoning. a trivalent DNA vaccine targeting the heavy chain C-terminal fragment of the C. botulinum serotypes (A, B, and E) most responsible for human disease has not been reported. 100 LD50 BoNT/A, BoNT/B, and BoNT/E plasmids were immunized with DNA. all heavy chain sequences were synthetically codon and RNA-optimized. the three components targeting the heavy chains of BoNT/A, BoNT/B, and BoNT/E refer to the monovalent vaccine preparations. constructs were expressed in vitro (Fig. 1). Figure 1. Construction and representative expression of boNT/Hc/A, B, or E genes cloned into pVAX1 mammalian expression vector. expression was confirmed using transfected RD cells and a HA-tagged antibody. anti-neurotoxin-specific endpoint titers induced by boNT/Hc/A, BoNT/Hc/B, and BoNT/Hc/E were 1.3 105 (9.7 103, 1.6 106), 2.0 105 (1.5 104, 2.6 106), 1.3 106 (2.6 105, 6.0 106), respectively. these results demonstrate the ability of the monovalent vaccine formulations to elicit high-titer antibodies after a total monovalent DNA vaccination provides complete protection against lethal challenge with 102 LD50 of pure C. botulinum neurotoxin. all vaccinated animals survived lethal neurotoxin challenge and all nave animals succumbed to intoxication within 6 hours post-challenge. monovalent antisera completely protects nave mice from lethal boNT challenge. we wanted to assess whether the monovalent antisera contained antibodies potent enough to prevent intoxication of nave mice. botulinum neurotoxin (%)c 1 Nave + BoNT/A 0 2 BoNT/Hc/A + BoNT/A 100 3 Nave + BoNT/B 0 4 BoNT/Hc/B + BoNT/B 100 5 Nave + BoNT/E 0 6 BoNT/E 100 aAntisera were from nave or vaccinated animals from the monovalent study. trivalent DNA vaccination provides complete protection against lethal challenge with pure C. botulinum homologous neurotoxin. animals received i.p. injections of 200 l of 102 LD50 of either C. botulinum neurotoxin type A, B, or E. bAnimals were challenged 4 weeks post-final immunization with 200 l of the respective toxin delivered by intraperitoneal injection. monovalent and trivalent vaccination induces robust and specific humoral immunity against botulinum A, B, and E antigens. trivalent vaccination induced toxin-specific CD4+ T cells producing total IFN-, TNF-, and IL-2 in the harvested splenocytes. we measured the ability of vaccine-induced Ag-specific T cells to secrete IFN-, TNF-, and IL-2 in response to ex vivo Hcs BoNT/A, BoNT/B, or BoNT/E peptide stimulation. cytokine recall responses to boNT/Hc/ABE were measured 3 weeks after the last immunization by ICS. flow cytometry was used to determine the percentage of multifunctional CD4+ T cells displayed as IFN-, TNF-, and IL-2 triple, double, or single positive CD4+ T cells. transfected RD cells with hemagglutinin-tagged boNT/Hc/A, boNT/Hc/B, and boNT/Hc/E plasmids. as a negative control, we transfected RD cells with an empty vector backbone, pVAX. a preliminary study determined that a 10 g dose of DNA for each vaccine resulted in consistent humoral responses. 3 separate groups of mice were immunized with 10 g of either pBoNT/Hc/A, pBoNT/Hc/B, or pBoNT/Hc/E. Vaccination with all monovalent antigens induced high titer antibodies (Fig. 3A, B, and C) anti-botulinum neurotoxin titers against serotypes A (A), B (B), and E (C) for 5 animals per group were measured by ELISA. vaccinated animals directly administered 102 LD50 of pure homologous neurotoxin. botulinum neurotoxin (%)b Nave N/A N/A N/A BoNT/A 0 BoNT/Hc/A 100 Nave N/A N/A N/A BoNT/B 0 BoNT/Hc/B 10 g 2 20 g BoNT/E 100 aAnimals were challenged 4 weeks post-final immunization with 200 l of the respective toxin delivered by intraperitoneal injection. animals that received nave sera and toxins succumbed to botulinum poisoning within 6 hours. the antibodies induced by monovalent vaccination are capable of neutralizing 100X the lethal dose of botulinum neurotoxin. trivalent DNA vaccinations induced high anti-toxin-specific antibody titers. trivalent DNA vaccination provides complete protection against lethal challenge with pure C. botulinum homologous neurotoxin. all vaccinated animals survived lethal neurotoxin challenge. botulinum neurotoxin (%)b Nave N/A N/A N/A BoNT/A 0 BoNT/Hc/A + BoNT/Hc/B + BoNT/Hc/E 10 g (each) 2 60 g BoNT/B 100 Nave N/A N/A N/A BoNT/B 0 BoNT/Hc/A + BoNT/Hc/B + BoNT/Hc/E 10 g (each trivalent vaccination induces antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4+ T cell immunity. trivalent vaccination induced toxin-specific CD4+ T cells producing total IFN-, TNF-, and IL-2. antigen stimulation with Hcs BoNT/A, BoNT/B, or BoNT/E resulted in the production of multifunctional CD4+ T cell cytokines. cytokine recall responses to boNT/Hc/ABE were measured 3 weeks after last immunization by ICS and flow cytometry. there is no licensed botulinum toxoid (PBT) vaccine to prevent intoxication from the botulinum serotypes most responsible for human disease, serotypes A, B, and E. the threat of the use of weaponized C. botulinum neurotoxin remains a concern. otypes A, B, and E named the constructs pBoNT/Hc/A, pBoNT/Hc/B, and pBoNT/Hc/E. vaccinated animals with each construct were completely protected against a lethal dose of toxin. the data show that DNA antisera neutralized the lethal dose. monovalent study determined that the heavy chain C-terminal fragment of botulinum serotypes A, B, and E are immunogenic. vaccination with DNA constructs expressing each serotype results in high-titer, toxin-neutralizing antibodies. we wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of a trivalent formulation of our vaccines. this multivalent formulation did not target botulinum serotype F. the highest incidence of human botulism are associated with more potent serotypes. serotypes would likely be the focus for weaponization in the event of bioterrorism. the need for new, prophylactic vaccines is often not realized until there is a present threat of disease outbreak. the lack of available vaccines has contributed to the Ebola, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemics. the lack of available vaccines has recently contributed to the MERS-CoV epidemics. each insert was cloned into a pVAX expression promotor between the BamHI and Not1 sites. the resulting purified DNA plasmids were formulated with sterile water and used in animal vaccinations.
