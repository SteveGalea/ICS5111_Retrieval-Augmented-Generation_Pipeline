{"summary": "the ability of TGEV to inhibit the host innate immune response by modulating the NF-B signaling pathway is not clear. a dual luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the inhibition of NF-B. the amino acid residues at positions 590\u20131,215 in Nsp3 compose the critical domain that mediates NF-B inhibition. we speculate that this inhibitory effect is likely to be related to the structure of PLP2 with deubiquitinating enzyme activity of the amino acid residues."}
