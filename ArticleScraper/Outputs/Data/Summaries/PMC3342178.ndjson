{"summary": "study aims to explore knowledge, attitudes and practices related to avian influenza among poultry workers in Nepal. most respondents were male (80%), mean age was 35 (SD = 11.6) a pandemic is bound to incur disastrous economic losses in a country where sectors like agriculture and tourism are expected to be particularly hard hit. there are subgroups which are particularly critical, such as poultry or pig farmers, who are among those first in line when it comes to risk of contracting AI. the aim of the present study was to identify levels of knowledge about preventive behaviours as well as actual preventive behaviours with regard to avian influenza in Nepalese poultry workers. the study, which took place in April 2009, was based on a cross-sectional cluster survey design. interview questionnaire The interview was based on a standardized questionnaire. interviewers read the questions to the study participants and recorded responses on an answering sheet. participants indicated how afraid they could contract avian influenza (yes/no) multiple analyses were performed using logistic regression. the variables included were chosen on the basis of the research questions. the variables included were chosen on the basis of the research questions. the study was based on a cross-sectional cluster survey design. interviews were conducted with 96 poultry workers aged 15 and above from the Rupandehi district, Nepal. no actual cases of H5N1 had appeared in this area at the time of the study. an influenza were developed on the basis of a published questionnaire from a study on Italian poultry workers. participants were asked to name all protective measures they knew against the danger of being infected due to work with poultry. participants were asked to name all protective measures they knew against the danger of being infected due to work with poultry. knowledge, fear and practices related to avian influenza. the majority of respondents were male (80%) and fell in the age bracket between 25 and 44 years. nearly two thirds (63%) were owners of poultry farms, the others were employed workers. almost everyone (97%) was aware that AI cases in poultry had been detected in Nepal. only one per cent had received health information from health workers. 44% described themselves as very afraid, while 18% said they were \"rather afraid\" about half (51%) of the group regularly practiced up to two such behaviours. about one third (31,2%) reported using three to four, and only 19,8% more than four of these protection measures. most government control measures found uniformly high acceptance. logistic regression analysis: Factors associated with preventive behaviours ( = 2 habitual practices/> 2 habitual practices); N = 96 Variables OR CI P Age.97.93-1.02.193 Gender (1 = male; 2 = higher than primary); N = 96 Variables OR CI P Age.97.93-1.02.193 Gender (1 = male; 2 = female); 92.26-3.26.897 Education (1 = none to primary; 2 = higher than primary). the majority of respondents were male (80%) and fell in the age bracket between 25 and 44 years. almost two thirds (63%) were owners of poultry farms, the others were employed workers. hand washing was the most common practice among poultry workers. only a third of the group regularly practiced up to two such behaviours. most government control measures found uniformly high acceptance. only 42% of respondents said they used treatment (96%) and burial of carcasses (95%) only very few said that when finding sick (1%) or dead poultry (4%) they were in the habit of notifying the district livestock services office. logistic regression analysis: Factors associated with knowledge about protective behaviours against avian influenza Table 2 shows the findings from a logistic regression analysis. ihood = 116.73; 2 = 15.98; df = 6, p = 0.14; Nagelkerke R2 =.41 Factors associated with preventive behaviours against avian influenza. a majority of over 60% among respondents felt afraid of contracting AI. almost everyone knew about the importance of washing hands with soap and water. this finding is in line with studies on poultry workers in other countries. only half of the sample mentioned face masks as an option. a higher degree of fear leads to less knowledge due to defensive processes such as not wanting to deal with the threat. the focus in this case was specifically on knowledge about protective behaviours, not on knowledge about AI in general, its danger potential, transmission pathways etc. the findings emphasize the role of awareness-building about the availability of preventive options as a first step in generating preventive habits. despite a generally voiced agreement with governmental emergency control measures and bio-security regulations large parts expressed doubts with regard to the sufficiency of such control measures. the very low percentage of respondents reporting compliance with notification procedures indicates that such tendencies were not pervasive. however, the very low percentage of respondents reporting compliance with notification procedures indicates that such tendencies were not pervasive. pre-publication history The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/12/76/prepub Acknowledgements."}
