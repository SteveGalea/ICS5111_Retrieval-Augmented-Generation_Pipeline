{"summary": "Expanded CAG RNAs Perturbed Ribosomal RNA Transcription. pre-rRNA expression level was down-regulated in our Drosophila polyQ disease models. compared with unexpanded MJDCAG27, a reduction of pre-rRNA levels was observed in degenerative expanded MJDCAG78 transgenic flies. tRNAmet expression in cell (C) models expressing CAG constructs was repeated three times. tRNAmet expression in mutant RNA and protein species contributed to polyQ toxicity. discontinuous CAG repeat construct MJDCAA/G78 did not cause any perturbation of pre-rRNA gene expression. the only difference between the MJDCAG78 and MJDCAA/G78 transgenes lies in the CAG repeat region. the continuity of the MJDCAA/G78 transgene is disrupted by another glutamine-coding triplet CAA (13) expanded CAG RNAs induced Stabilization and Mitochondrial Accumulation of p53. inhibition of pre-rRNA gene expression has been reported to elevate p53 protein level (25) and trigger neuronal apoptosis (4) via the ribosomal protein\u2013MDM2-p53 nucleolar stress pathway. p53 accumulates in mitochondria and allows Bak to oligomerize on mitochondrial outer membrane to form pores. cytochrome c release from mitochondria is a universal inducer of caspase cleavage. cleavage of poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) was detected. expanded CAG RNAs interfered with the formation of rRNA transcription preinitiation complex and promoted hypermethylation of rRNA promoter. chromatin immunoprecipitation of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase I (RPA194) (28) to the rRNA promoter. the effect of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine on expanded CAG RNA-induced UCE CpG DNA hypermethylation. compared with the controls, UCEs extracted from cells that expressed MJDCAG78 and EGFPCAG78 RNA were found to be hypermethylated. MJDCAG78 RNAs (S1-MJDCAG78) was performed to identify expanded CAG RNA-interacting proteins. the nucleolar protein, NCL (36), specifically associated with expanded CAG RNAs. this result indicates that CAG continuity is necessary to mediate the interaction between expanded CAG RNAs and NCL. Western blotting was performed to confirm the expression of the GST-NCL protein. this experiment was repeated three times, and a representative gel is shown. down of NCL expression reduced binding of UBF to UCE (Fig. 3E and Fig. S5C) the reduced level of binding of NCL to UCE was accompanied by an enhanced association between expanded CAG RNAs and expanded CAG RNAs. our findings indicate that expanded CAG RNAs prevent NCL from interacting with UCE by directly binding to NCL. d the expanded CAG RNA-mediated nucleolar stress response. we treated expanded CAG RNA-expressing cells with 5-azacytidine. inhibition of UCE DNA methylation reduced cellular accumulation of p53 in MJDCAG78 and EGFPCAG78 RNA-expressing cells. p53 induces apoptosis by promoting phosphorylation of p53 on Ser46 (39) and p53 may trigger cell death by inducing the expression of apoptosis-inducing genes (40). nucleolin overexpression restored rRNA transcription and suppressed nucleolar stress. CAG repeat expansion confers a pathogenic property to the mutant RNA molecules. such RNA\u2013protein interaction causes DNA hypermethylation in the rRNA promoter and results in a reduction in rRNA transcription. dysregulation of UBF1 acetylation has also been shown to cause impairment of rRNA transcription in R6/2 polyQ transgenic mice (41) a reduced level of rRNAs causes accumulation of free ribosomal proteins. interaction between free ribosomal proteins and E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 leads to mitochondrial accumulation of p53. cytochrome c activates caspase cascade and induces apoptosis."}
