{"summary": "HCoV belongs to the Coronaviridae family (alphacoronavirus 1) and comprises a large group of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded polyadenylated RNA virus. it consists of the largest known viral RNA genomes, ranging from 27.6 to 31.6 kb. the classification is also supported by evolutionary analysis. the rapid in silico informatics-based approach has gained much popularity with the recent advancement in the sequencing of many pathogen genomes and protein sequence databases. however, these methods of vaccine development usually work through the identification of human leukocyte antigens and T cell epitopes. a database of the ExPASy Bioinformatics Resource Portal was used for the selection of HCoVs and their associated information. the outer membrane protein (spike protein) sequences of HCoV were retrieved from the UniProtKB database. all the sequences were stored as a FASTA format for further analysis. a tool from the Immune Epitope Database21 was used to predict the MHC-I binding. the stabilized matrix base method (SMM)22 was used to calculate the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of peptide binding to MHC-I molecules. the KSSTGFVYF epitope was subjected to PEP-FOLD web-based server28 for 3D structure conversion. a docking study was performed using Molegro Virtual Docker, version 6.0 (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark) the HLA-B*15:01 was selected for docking on the basis of the available Protein Data Bank structure deposited in the database. a database of the ExPASy Bioinformatics Resource Portal was used for the selection of HCoVs and their associated information. the outer membrane protein (spike protein) sequences of HCoV were retrieved from the UniProtKB database. a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the ClustalW2 multiple sequence alignment tool. the stabilized matrix base method (SMM)22 was used to calculate the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of peptide binding to MHC-I molecules. a web-based tool was used to predict proteasomal cleavage, TAP transport, and MHC-I. the KSSTGFVYF epitope was subjected to PEP-FOLD web-based server28 for 3D structure conversion. this server modeled five 3D structures of the proposed epitope. the best one was selected for the docking analysis. human UbcH6 peptide was retrieved from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) protein database30. the docking was established at a grid of X: 24.81, Y: 29.16, and Z: 40.59. the aim of the prediction of the B cell epitope was to find the potential antigen that would interact with B lymphocytes and initiate an immunoresponse. the netCTL server predicted the potent T cell epitopes from the selected protein sequence. based on the high combinatorial score, the five best epitopes were selected for further analysis.

Figure 2. Population coverage. the epitope KSSTGFVYF binds in the groove of the HLA-B*15:01. Abbreviation: HLA-B, the-major histocompatibility complex, class I, B. the average antigenic propensity of the protein was 1.058, with maximum of 1.240 and minimum of 0.920. the antigenic determination threshold for the protein was 1.00. regions above the threshold are antigenic, shown in yellow. region 88 to 94 amino acid residues were more accessible. x-axis and y-axis represent the sequence position and surface probability. tope prediction tool is based on a Hidden Markov model. we predicted that the peptide sequences from 88\u201394 amino acids are capable of inducing the desired immune response as B cell epitopes. antigenic protein prediction The VaxiJen server assessed all of the retrieved protein sequences in order to find the most potent antigenic protein. the protein was used for further analysis. the five best epitopes were selected for further analysis. *68:23 (1.30), HLA-C*05:01 (1.02), HLA-B*40:13 (0.50) HLA-A*01:01 (0.46), HLA-C*07:01 (0.36), HLA-A*32:15 (0.21) KTLQYDVLF HLA-B*15:17 (1.77), HLA-A*32:07 (1.39), HLA-A*32:01 (1.37) 64.29% HLA peptide molecules from proteasome cleavage associated with class-I MHC molecules were transported to the cell membrane where they were presented to T helper cells. higher overall score for each peptide denotes higher processing capabilities. mer epitope, KSSTGFVYF, was found to interact with most MHC-I alleles, including HLA-B*27:20; HLA-B*15:17; HLA-B*15:03; HLA-B*40:13; HLA-A*32:07; HLA-C*03:03; HLA-C*12:03; HLA-C*12:50; HLA-A*32:01; HLA- the epitope KSSTGFVYF interaction analysis was visualized with the PyMOL molecular graphics system, version 1.5.0.4 (Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, Portland, OR, USA) the epitope KSSTGFVYF binds in the groove of the HLA-B*15:01. x-axis and y-axis represent the sequence position and antigenic propensity, respectively. the threshold value is 1.0. the flexible regions of the protein are shown in yellow color, above the threshold value. the region of 75\u201395 was found to be the most flexible (Figure 7). the region of 75\u201395 was found to be the most flexible (Figure 7). the HCoV is an RNA virus, which tends to mutate more frequently than the DNA viruses. spike proteins have the most potential as a target for vaccine design because of their ability to induce a faster and longer-term mucosal immune response than the other proteins. the initial criterion is the conservancy of the epitopes, which was measured by the IEDB conservancy analysis tool. the KSSTGFVYF epitope possessed the highest amount of interactions with the HLA alleles. we also found a spike protein with 64.29% conservancy among the 56 spike proteins. the threshold for prediction of allergen cross-reactivity is adjusted so that a sequence is predicted as a cross-reactive allergen if its probability is >0.06. a sequence is potentially allergenic if it either has an identity of at least six contiguous amino acids or >35 percent sequence identity over a window of 80 amino acids."}
