MICs and minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) of toxoflavin were determined to be between 128 and 256 g/ml. the MIC and MFC values for toxoflavin against A. fumigatus were 64 and 128 g/ml respectively. microscopy study was carried out to characterize the effects of toxoflavin on A. fumigatus Af293. Spores of A. fumigatus Af293 began to germinate in minimal medium (MM) broth without toxoflavin after incubation for 8 h at 37\u00b0C. toxoflavin production by B. gladioli HDXY-02 was observed to be much higher in the KMB broth (170 mg/liter) than in LB broth after 24 h of cultivation at 30\u00b0C. the result suggests that toxoflavin production correlates with the growth curve of the bacterium HDXY-02. xoflavin productiona Parameter Effect Coefficient SE t P Constant 737.7 30.6 24.08 0.000* Glucose 193.4 96.7 30.6 3.16 0.016* Glycerol \u201374.4 \u201337.2 30.6 \u20131.21 0.264 Peptone 269.0 134.5 30.6 4.39 0.003* NaCl 24.0 12.0 30.6 0.39 0.707 MgSO4 44.2 22.1 30.6 0.72 0.494 Ty model is as follows: Y = 10, 774 + 629 X 1 + 374 X 2 + 3, 592 X 3 13.29 X 1 2 8.79 X 2 4, 330 X 3 2 \u2013 0.22 X 1 X 2 + 38.6 X 1 X 3 \u2013 21.0 X 2 X 3.
