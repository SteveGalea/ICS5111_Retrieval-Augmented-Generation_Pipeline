{"summary": "in 2011 there was an outbreak of fatal H3N8 influenza virus in harbor seals. this virus caused interstitial pneumonia, hemorrhagic alveolitis and necrotizing bronchitis. in seals this virus caused interstitial pneumonia, hemorrhagic alveolitis and necrotizing bronchitis. the zoonotic potential of Seal/H10N7 in harbor seals is unknown. a good and well accepted animal model for severe respiratory disease caused by influenza A viruses in humans is the ferret after intratracheal inoculation. six ferrets were intratracheally inoculated with Seal/H10N7, euthanized on 3 or 7 days post infection. us organ and tissue samples were collected including skin, skeletal muscle, tongue, mandibular, retropharyngeal, pulmonary and mesenteric lymph nodes, tonsils, bone marrow, thymus, nasal mucosa, trachea, lung, heart, aorta, spleen, liver, pancreas, kidneys, urinary bladder, esophagus, stomach, small and large intestine, gona zooepidemicus - 2 3* mf +++ suppurative and granulomatous pneumonia negative positive (+/-) positive (+/-) positive S. phocae + 3 3* mf +++ suppurative to granulomatous/eos pneumonia positive (+/-) positive (+/-) positive S. phocae + 3 3* mf +++ suppurative to granulomatous/e ++/+++ granulomatous/eos pneumonia not examined positive (+/-) positive (++) positive (+/-) negative Brucella spp. +++ 12 7* foc +++ necrosuppurative bronchopneumonia/adenitis not examined positive (+) positive (+) positive (++) negative S. phocae, alpha-hemolysing Streptococci + 14 1 (f) foc + granulomatous to e IHC on paraffin-embedded tissue sections of all organs was performed using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) method. polyclonal antibody (Lot 25, rabbit #162) was applied as described previously. for negative control purposes, the primary antibody was replaced by ascitic fluid from non-immunized Balb/cJ mice. -sucrose agar (TCBS) (Vibrio selective) agar (E. Merck) was incubated in a CO2-incubator with 10% C02 for at least five days. a genus-specific PCR targeting the 16S rDNA was designed according to Rawadi and Dussurget [20]. infectious virus titers were calculated in quadruplicates of each of the nasal swabs, pharyngeal swabs, and homogenized tissue samples. three days after inoculation, supernatants of cell cultures were tested. tomidine (10 and 0.05 mg/kg resp.) antagonized by atipamezole (0.25 mg/kg resp.) ferrets were inoculated intratracheally with 106 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of Seal/H10N7 in a 3-ml volume. trachea, bronchus, lung, tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes, tonsils, heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, adrenal glands, pancreas, jejunum, olfactory bulb, cerebellum and cerebrum. Tissues for virological examination were homogenized in transport medium using the FastPrep system (MP Biomedicals) a complete necropsy was performed on each seal. the samples were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and processed routinely into paraffin wax. influenza virus antigen immunolabelling Mycoplasma PCR Bacteriological culture Lungworm infestation Nasal mucosa Tracheal mucosa Lung Bronchial mucosa Bronchial glands 1 n. k.* mf ++ necrosuppurative pneumonia/adenitis positive (+/-) negative negative negative (+/-) negative S. equi ssp. zooepidemicus - 2 3* mf ++ granulomatous/eos pneumonia positive (+) positive (+/-) positive (+) negative S. phocae +/++ 11 6* of ++/+++ granulomatous/necrotizing/eos pneumonia not examined positive (+/-) positive (++) positive (+/-) negative Brucella spp. +++ 12 7* foc +++ necrosuppurative bronchopneumonia/adenitis not examined positive IHC on paraffin-embedded tissue sections of all organs was performed using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) method. polyclonal antibody (Lot 25, rabbit #162) was applied as described previously. for negative control purposes, the primary antibody was replaced by ascitic fluid from non-immunized Balb/cJ mice. thiosulfate-citrate-bile-sucrose agar (TCBS) (Vibrio selective) agar (E. Merck) was incubated in a CO2-incubator with 10% C02 for at least five days. a genus-specific PCR targeting the 16S rDNA was designed according to Rawadi and Dussurget [20]. infectious virus titers were calculated in quadruplicates of each of the nasal swabs, pharyngeal swabs, and homogenized tissue samples. the experiments were conducted in strict compliance with european guidelines (EU directive on animal testing 86/609/EEC) ferrets were inoculated intraracheally with 106 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of Seal/H10N7 in a 3-ml volume. clinical scores were assessed daily and the activity status was scored as follows: 0, alert and playful; 1, alert but not playful when stimulated; 3, neither alert nor playful when stimulated. at 3 and 7 dpi, three animals were euthanized by exsanguination. the following samples were taken for virological, histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses. tissues for virological examination were homogenized in transport medium. histological examination revealed catarrhal rhinitis and tracheitis with epithelial single cell necrosis. acute necrotizing bronchitis, bronchiolitis and adenitis of bronchial glands were observed. lungworms were also present in bronchi displaying epithelial hyperplasia and within pulmonary lobules without inflammatory reaction. bronchiolar and bronchial glandular epithelium of harbor seal (No. 13) naturally infected with seal/H10N7. histopathology showed necrotizing bronchitis with accumulation of cellular debris in the lumen (asterisks) and bronchial adenitis with necrosis of glandular epithelial cells (arrows) ing type I pneumocytes were found in the pulmonary parenchyma. antigen was not detected in extra-respiratory tissues or organs. immunohistochemistry for morbillivirus antigen was negative in lungs and brains. three seals (nos. 1, 8, 12) Bordetella bronchiseptica (nos. 3, 4, 7) Bordetella bronchiseptica (nos. 2, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16) Streptococcus phocae (nos. 5, 14, and 15) a low number of various non-specific bacteria were isolated. in 4 (nos. 2, 3, 4, 7) out of 16 seals Mycoplasma spp. were identified. the ferrets lost between 4 and 6% of body weight at 3 dpi and between 8 and 18% of body weight at 7 dpi. there was multifocal consolidation of the lung parenchyma that was red-grey at 3 dpi with 10\u201320% of the tissue affected. at 3 dpi it was 0.90% (range 0.89\u20131.02) and at 7 dpi it was 1.32% (1.25\u20131.82) the alveolar septa were distended by infiltration of neutrophils, mild edema and had epithelial necrosis. in the alveolar lumina there were moderate numbers of neutrophils and alveolar macrophages mixed with proteinaceous material. at 7 dpi, the lesions in the lungs were similar but with less neutrophils and more macrophages and lymphocytes. cro-suppurative alveolitis (D), bronchiolitis (E) and bronchial adenitis (F) at 7 dpi there was more severe hypertrophy of epithelial cells. there were less neutrophils and more intraluminal macrophages. immunohistochemical staining of influenza virus antigen was associated with lesions. virologically, virus was detected in the pharyngeal swabs from 1 to 7 dpi. in nasal swabs, virus was isolated only in one ferret at 2 (2.25 TCID50/g) and 3 (1 TCID50/g) dpi. high virus titers were detected in lung (3/3), bronchus (3/3), trachea (3/3) and nose (1/3), low virus titers in dpi Nasal turbinates 1/3 (8.6)* 0/3 Trachea 3/3 (4.0\u20134.9) 2/3 (3.6\u20134.1) Bronchus 3/3 (3.3\u20134.7) 1/3 (4.3) Lung 3/3 (5.3\u20136.6) 3/3 (1.6\u20134.0) Tracheobronchial lymph node 1/3 (2.4) 0/3 Tonsil 1/3 (2.2) 0/3 Olfactory bulb 2/3 (2.1\u20133.9) histopathology and immunohistochemistry of nasal respiratory mucosa and tracheal mucosa naturally infected with Seal/H10N7. there was marked hyperemia (dilated blood vessels) in the nasal respiratory mucosa and accumulation of exudate (asterisk) in the nasal cavity (A; magnification 100x) in the tracheal epithelium there were numerous necrotic epithelial cells (arrows) and mild inflammatory infiltration ( bronchial glandular (arrowheads) (E; magnification 200x) and bronchiolar (F; magnification 400x) epithelial cells and intraluminal cells. immunohistochemistry revealed specific staining of influenza A nucleoprotein exclusively in the respiratory tract. plasm of a bronchial epithelial cell of seal no. 16; N = nucleus; pop-off technique applied on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue section; N = nucleus; magnification 25.000x; bar = 100 nm. tracheal swabs (seal nos. 8\u201316) and throat swabs (seal nos. 13\u201315) tested positive for influenza virus. in seal no. 16, the heartworm Acanthocheilonema (previously called Dipetalonema) spirocauda was additionally observed. experimentally infected ferrets were inoculated intratracheally with H10N7 influenza virus A/harbor seal/Germany/PV20762_TS/2014. all animals survived and clinical examination of the ferrets demonstrated that they were less active starting at 3 days post inoculation. two ferrets had mild hepatic lipidosis at 3 dpi and one at 7 dpi. bronchitis, bronchiolitis and adenitis were characterized by mild epithelial necrosis, exocytosis of neutrophils, hypertrophy of epithelial cells and accumulation of intraluminal neutrophils. histopathology at 3 and 7 dpi showed multifocal mild to severe necro-suppurative alveolitis (A), bronchiolitis (B) and bronchial adenitis (C) at 7 dpi there was mild to severe necro-suppurative alveolitis (D), bronchiolitis (E) and bronchial adenitis (F) at 7 dpi there was staining of influenza virus antigen was present only in 2 ferrets in few bronchial and bronchial glandular epithelial cells (1/3) and occasional type II pneumocytes (1/3). no influenza virus antigen staining was present in the remaining respiratory or extra-respiratory tissues on both days. at 7 dpi, low virus titers were detected in lung (3/3), bronchus (2/3) and trachea (2/3), while no virus was isolated from other respiratory or extra-respiratory tissues. titers were measured in six ferrets from 1\u20133 dpi and in three ferrets from 4\u20137 dpi. seal/H10N7 caused respiratory disease in both naturally infected wild harbor seals and experimentally infected ferrets. virus-induced lesions and cell type tropism were restricted to the respiratory tract with no evidence for spread to extra-respiratory tissues. harbor seals naturally infected with LPAI H7N7 that developed necrotizing bronchitis, bronchiolitis and hemorrhagic alveolitis. the most severe lesions in the harbor seals infected with Seal/H10N7 were suppurative or pyogranulomatous bronchopneumonia caused by co-infections with bacteria and/or lungworms. seals were isolated only from lungs of seals that died during phocine distemper or influenza epidemics. seals stranded on the coast of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, independent of mass mortalities, these bacteria were not found. bronchopneumonia associated with intralesional virus antigen mainly located in bronchiolar epithelial cells and less frequently in type I and II pneumocytes. also, virus was predominantly found in pharyngeal swabs, trachea, bronchus and lung but not in the extra-respiratory organs. bronchiolar tropism of Seal/H10N7 was similar to that of influenza A[H1N1]p marine biologists working with stranded seals or with experimentally infected seals during the outbreak of LPAI H7N7 in 1979 developed purulent conjunctivitis. this virus may again cross the species barrier and infect humans working with live (or dead) seals. similar changes were seen in the lower respiratory tract including tracheitis, bronchitis, bronchial adenitis and to a lesser extent bronchiolitis. the difference between the seals and the ferrets is the absence of lesions and virus antigen in the nose of the ferrets. the seals had virus antigen presence in occasional type I pneumocytes and the ferrets in few type I and II pneumocytes which may reflect a slight difference in tropism between the two species. virus attachment studies showed tropism of seasonal human influenza virus and avian LPAI and HPAI viruses for bronchial submucosal glands in humans. bronchial glandular epithelial cells may play a role in efficient mammal-to-mammal transmission, since virus excreted from these glands into the bronchus is more likely to be expectorated than virus produced in alveolar epithelial cells. weight loss from 1 to 3 dpi was more severe than that from 4 to 7 dpi."}
