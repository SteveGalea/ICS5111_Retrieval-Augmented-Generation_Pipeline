{"summary": "a novel human coronavirus (CoV) has established itself as a fatal human respiratory disease [1], [2], [3], [4]. the exact mechanism of SARS pathogenesis remains unknown. pathological examination of lung biopsies and autopsy specimens from SARS patients revealed \"diffuse alveolar damage\" a failure of type I IFNs in infected mice has led to the hypothesis that SARS-CoV has evolved strategies to evade this potent IFN-related innate antiviral response. the failure of type I IFNs in infected hosts has led to the hypothesis that SARS-CoV has evolved strategies to evade this potent IFN-related innate antiviral response. human airway epithelium is likely one of the initial sites of SARS-CoV infection [35]. a thorough understanding of how human lung epithelial cells respond to SARS-CoV infection is crucial. a thorough understanding of how human lung epithelial cells respond to SARS-CoV infection is crucial. 2B4 clone explored innate antiviral signaling pathway/s triggered by SARS-CoV. clone analyzed global gene responses of 2B4 cells over time in response to SARS-CoV infection. but 2B4 cells can mount an active response. the magnitude of their expression was not as high as those induced by DHOV. the translational machinery for IFN- and IFN-2 mRNA transcripts in 2B4 cells was not as efficient as those of IFN-1, IL-6, IL-8, and, especially, CXCL-10/IP-10. 2B4 clones were highly permissive to SARS-CoV. we chose cells of the 2B4 clone for a detailed characterization. ACE2 expression of 2B4 cells (passage #6) was much more intense than that of the parental Calu-3 cells. this was confirmed by Western blot analysis. 2B4 cells and their parental Calu-3 cells were assessed by standard IHC (A) and Western blot analysis (B), whereas confluent 2B4 cells were subjected to SARS-CoV (MOI = 0.1) the morphological features of polarized 2B4 cells were assessed by TEM (C), as described in Materials and Methods. infected 2B4 cells increased from 12 hrs (i.e., 8%) to 24 hrs (i.e., 30%), reaching 100% at 48 hrs. expression of the SARS-CoV N protein was readily detectable in infected 2B4 cells at 24 hrs, significantly increased at 48 hrs, and reached the maximum at 72-hrs p.i. the microarray-based analysis of the temporal gene expression of 2B4 cells in response to SARS-CoV or DHOV infection was performed simultaneously within the same experimental setting. most of the results relevant to DHOV infection, unless indicated otherwise, are the subject of a separate manuscript. the capacity of SARS-CoV to modulate gene expression of infected 2B4 cells was not as potent as that of DHOV, whose infection resulted in 684 and 246 genes being significantly up-regulated and down-regulated. the cells were lysed for extracting total RNAs for the subsequent microarray analysis by using Affymetrix Genechips. the remaining seven genes are functionally related to transcriptional factors (TFs) by acting either as suppressors, phosphatases, or kinases. a total of 85 and 412 genes whose expressions were significantly altered (i.e., either up- or down-regulated) at 24- and 48-hrs p.i. appa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor alpha Inhibit NFB nuclear translocation NFB 1.7 3.3 5.8 PTX3 Pentraxin-related gene rapidly induced by IL-1 Amplification of the inflammatory reactions and regulation of innate immunity 1.8 4.4 10.6 a Enriched TF responsible for up-regulating the expression of genes at 12 hrs. the majority of TFs are also known to regulate the expression of multiple and often overlapping genes genes whose expressions were significantly altered in 2B4 cells were subjected to the TRANSFAC database-based analysis of TF activation. adjusted p values of 0.05 among stringent pairwise comparisons were used for selecting those enriched TFs that were significantly enriched at 12, 24, and 48 hrs p.i. 13 enriched biological entities were readily revealed for those genes up-regulated at 12, 24, and/or 48 hrs p.i. all of the functionally enriched GO terms identified thus far appeared to be closely involved in either genomic transcription (i.e., TFs, sequence-specific DNA and/or double-stranded RNA binding) or inflammatory responses. expressions of genes directly involved in cell differentiation, cell cycle progression, and cell-to-cell signaling were significantly up-regulated as early as 12 hrs. genes with GO-annotated biological functions of \u201cresponse to virus\u201d and \u201cimmune response\u201d were particularly prominent. feron-stimulated genes (ISGs), such as ISG20, MXs, OASs, RIG-I, MDA-5, TLR3, STATs, etc. were hierarchically clustered along with time points after infection to more comprehensively reveal the temporal and transitional nature of host antiviral and inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV infection. inducible protein (IP)-10, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) BB, and TNFSF10/TRAIL could also be detected at either 48 or 72 hrs p.i. the enhanced expression of genes coding for FGF basic and PDGF BB could only be detected at the translational, but not transcriptional levels. IL-1RA in infected 2B4 cells prompted us to evaluate the correlativity of mRNA and the corresponding protein expression among a cohort of virally activated genes. we selected 48 hrs and 72 hrs p.i., two of the most conspicuous time points for detecting up-regulated mRNA and protein levels. relative efficacies of transcriptional and translational genes in 2B4 cells were assessed. a strong correlation between transcriptional and translational expressions of genes coding for CCL5/RANTES, CXCL1/GRO, CXCL10/IP-10, IFN-2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNFSF10/TRAIL was identified in DHOV-infected 2B4 cells. a parallel analysis of the mRNA and protein expression profiles of genes elicited by differentially infected 2B4 cells. we drew a dotted line representing a \u201cone-to-one\u201d ratio of the gene mRNA and protein expression. this would represent those whose protein expression after mRNA transcription were more efficiently expressed by DHOV-infected cells. the ability of SARS-CoV to activate MXs, OAS, RIG-I, MDA5, TLR3, STATs, and many other ISGs without stimulating any significant responses of IFN-, and especially of IFN-s. we pretreated 2B4 cells with IFN-, IFN-1 and IFN-2, either individually or in combination at indicated concentrations prior to infection with SARS-CoV. we also found that pretreatment of cells with all three types of IFNs together diminished the antiviral effect provided by the combination treatments of IFN-1/IFN-, IFN-2/IFN-, and IFN-1/IFN-2 at the same concentrations. the mechanism of this interesting observation remains unknown. 18 out of a total of 26 clones established exhibited an array of varying intensities of ACE2 expression and permissiveness to SARS-CoV. the remaining eight clones revealed increased ACE2 expression and susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection, when compared to their parental Calu-3 cells. results of IHC staining revealed that the ACE2 expression of 2B4 cells (passage #6) was much more intense than that of the parental Calu-3 cells 2B4 cells clonally derived from human bronchial epithelial Calu-3 cells. expressions of the viral ACE2 receptor in indicated passages of 2B4 cells and their parental Calu-3 cells were assessed. morphological features of polarized 2B4 cells were assessed by TEM (C) infected 2B4 cells increased from 12 hrs (i.e., 8%) to 24 hrs (i.e., 30%), reaching 100% at 48 hrs. expression of the SARS-CoV N protein was readily detectable in infected 2B4 cells at 24 hrs, significantly increased at 48 hrs, and reached the maximum at 72-hrs p.i. DHOV, a proposed orthomyxoviral surrogate of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus [45], [46], productively infected 2B4 cells. the microarray-based analysis of the temporal gene expression of 2B4 cells in response to SARS-CoV or DHOV infection has been performed simultaneously within the same experimental setting. most of the results relevant to DHOV infection, unless indicated otherwise, are the subject of a separate manuscript the kinetics of viral replication was also determined at each time point to correlate the levels of viral infection to the extent of host gene responses. we constructed a Venn diagram, based on the results of the stringent microarray analysis, to roughly reflect the temporal changes in the gene expression of infected 2B4 cells. regulated 417 genes (178 up- and 239 down-regulated genes) only 8 up-regulated genes were detected at the earliest time point (i.e., 12 hrs) the expression of these genes continued to increase over time. the remaining seven genes are functionally related to transcriptional factors (TFs) by acting either as suppressors, phosphatases, or kinases. c-JUN v-jun sarcoma virus 17 oncogene homolog (avian)

Inhibit NFB nuclear translocation NFB 1.7 3.3 5.8 PTX3 Pentraxin-related c-JUN, CREB, and CREB/ATF were also detected at 24 hrs. activation of IRF-7, a molecule critically involved in the induction of type I IFNs, could not be observed until 48 hrs p.i. all of the significantly up- and down-regulated genes were subjected to gene ontogeny (GO)-based annotation. an adjusted p value of 0.05 was used as the minimal criterion for selecting the enriched GO-annotated biological functions. no enriched GO-annotated biological term could be identified for those genes whose expressions were significantly down-regulated. expressions of genes functionally related to oxidoreductase were reduced at 48 hrs. but their subsequent impact on host responses and/or SARS pathogenesis remains unknown. enriched GO terms describe the \u201cbiological themes\u201d of those genes whose expressions were up-regulated in infected 2B4 cells. 2B4 cells elicit temporal and transitional expressions of genes relevant to innate immune responses. expression of 52 and 26 genes relevant to host viral immune responses (A) and expression of cytokines and chemokines (B) elicited by SARS-CoV-infected 2B4 cells were hierarchically clustered along with time points after infection. 35 cytokines and chemokines could be measured simultaneously by using the human group I and II Bio-Plex. we could also detect the increased expression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) basic, CCL5/RANTES, CXCL1/GRO, CXCL10/interferon-inducible protein (IP-10), IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) BB. 0.05 by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's post-hoc test in comparison with the mock-infected group at the same hrs p.i. mRNA and protein expression of genes encoding for FGF basic, PDGF BB, and IL-1RA in 2B4 cells prompted us to evaluate the correlativity of mRNA and the corresponding protein expression among a cohort of virally activated genes. mRNAs and their corresponding proteins correlated poorly for IFN-2-, IL-1-, and IFN--encoding genes. relative transcriptional-versus-translational efficacies of selected genes in 2B4 cells were assessed. mRNA transcripts were more readily detectable than those of the proteins. fected 2B4 cells drew a dotted line representing a \u201cone-to-one\u201d ratio of the gene mRNA and protein expression. genes plotted above this dotted line would represent those whose expression was more readily detectable by DHOV-infected ones harvested at the same time points p.i. the ability of SARS-CoV to activate MXs, OAS, RIG-I, MDA5, TLR3, STATs, and many other ISGs without stimulating any significant responses of IFN-, and especially of IFN-s, prompted us to investigate whether IFN-s elicited by infected 2B4 cells could potentiate IFN-like activity against SARS-CoV. treatment with either type of IFN-, together with an otherwise ineffective low-dose of IFN- (e.g., 10 IU) drastically hampered the growth of SARS-CoV in 2B4 cells (P0.05), a finding that either species of IFN- could potentiate the antiviral effect of IFN-. bronchial Calu-3 cells secreted high levels of biologically active IL-6, IL-8, and IP-10 in response to SARS-CoV infection. but they failed to mount any detectable IFN-/ response [38]. the global host gene expression in response to SARS-CoV infection has been previously reported in various cell types. innate antiviral signaling is initiated upon the recognition of conserved molecular structures shared by invading pathogens of various origin. innate antiviral signaling is initiated upon the recognition of conserved molecular structures shared by invading pathogens of various origin, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by specific pattern recognition receptor molecules expressed on host cells. effective transcriptional induction of the IFN- gene requires coordinated induction and binding of at least three promoter-specific TFs. studies with targeted gene knockout mice have clearly indicated that IRF-3 and/or IRF-7 molecules play an indispensible, but distinctive, role in the induction of IFN-/ responses against viral infection. the impact of such a delay in the activation of the indispensible IRF-3/7 pathways in infected 2B4 cells remains unknown. however, it has been reported that SARS-CoV is capable of evading innate antiviral responses by encoding antagonistic molecules that target different host antiviral pathways. TBK1/IKK-IRF-3/7-STAT- signaling axis imposed by SARS-CoV in 2B4 cells appeared incomplete. however, such interferences in the TBK1/IKK-IRF-3/7-STAT- signaling axis imposed by SARS-CoV in 2B4 cells appeared to be incomplete. expressions of IFN-2 and, especially of IFN- proteins, were profoundly inhibited, but SARS-CoV infection did not impose a generalized suppression of host posttranscriptional machinery in 2B4 cells. failure of effectively translating IFN- transcripts has also been reported recently in mouse fibroblasts infected by MHV stain A59. epithelial cells seemed to be preferentially responsive to IFN-s. recent studies have indicated that IFN-s contribute to the host defense viral pathogens infecting the lung but not the liver. the relative contribution of IFN-s in the epithelial defense against SARS-CoV infection has yet to be explored. bronchial epithelial 2B4 cells are capable of responding to SARS-CoV infection by temporally activating latent NFB (12-hrs), AP-1 (ATF2/-Jun) (24-hrs), and IRF-3/7 (48-hrs), all of which are critically involved in the induction of type I IFN gene expression and the subsequent activation of virus-dependent and/or IFN-dependent antiviral signaling pathways. despite their delayed expressions, we demonstrate that both IFN-/ and IFN-s possess non-redundant and complementary activities against SAS-CoV replication. we also identify various ISGs elicited by lung epithelial cells, the primary target cells of SARS-CoV infection. the original stock of DHOV was subjected to two additional passages in vero E6 cells. a viral stock with a titer of 1107 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50)/ml was generated and stored at 80\u00b0C. the prototype strain of Dhori virus (DHOV), an orthomyxovirus, was also used in this study. infected 2B4 cells grown on 24-well plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) the infected 2B4 cells were harvested by adding Trypsin-EDTA. the final washing was saved for determining the titer of the residual \u201ccell-free\u201d viruses. the protein samples (20 g each) were mixed with 2 Novex\u00ae Tris-Glycine SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) the membrane was tehn incubated with 2% blocking reagent supplemented in the ECL Advance western blotting detection kit (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) overnight, followed by additional incubation overnight with either goat anti-human ACE2 polyclonal antibody (0.1 g/ml) at 4 membranes were cut out, sliced into stripes, and stacked at one side of a flat embedding mold. semi-thin sections were stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate and lead citrate. cells were stained with rabbit anti-sARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (NP) microarray analysis DNA microarray experiments were performed in the MG Core Facilities at UTMB. to characterize changes of gene expression induced by SARS-CoV or DHOV, confluent 2B4 cells grown in T-75 flasks were infected with either viruses (MOI = 0.1) or remained uninfected for 12, 24, and 48 hrs. mock-infected cells were compared to cells infected with either SARS-CoV or DHOV at each time point. for comparison across different arrays, the data for each array were normalized by Robust Multi-chip Average (RMA) [75] using Spotfire DecisionSite (Spotfire, Inc., Somerville, MA) and GeneSifter (VizX Labs, Seattle, WA), and probe sets with expression values below the level of background noise were data-mining, gene ontology and TF analysis for DNA microarray data. all of the genes whose expressions were significantly altered were analyzed against the available human genomes to assign the most characteristic gene ontology terms to each cluster of genes. all of the genes whose expressions were significantly altered (i.e., both up- and down-regulated genes) were analyzed against the available human genomes to assign the most characteristic gene ontology terms. p values obtained for the selected GO terms were corrected to obtain an adjusted p value. adjusted p values 0.05 were chosen to determine the level of statistical significance. supernatants of virally infected cultures were subject to a serially 3-fold dilution. we titrated the contents of IFN- and IFN-s in the supernatants by using the commercially available ELISA kits for human IFN- and IL-28A/IFN-2. both the human group I 27-plex and the group II 8-plex were used for profiling the cytokine responses of infected 2B4 cells. the correlation coefficient was calculated by Spearman correlation coefficient analysis. the significance of the correlation coefficient was also calculated from an F test. a viral stock with a titer of 1107 50% tissue culture infectious doses was generated and stored at 80\u00b0C. DHOV was originally isolated from Hyalomma dromedarii ticks [73], intranasal infection of mice with this tick-borne virus resulted in the onset of a uniformly fatal illness. the original stock of DHOV was subjected to three additional passages in Vero E6 cells before being used in this study. infected 2B4 cells grown on 24-well plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at indicated time points after infection to remove cell-free viruses. cells were harvested by adding Trypsin-EDTA and next total cell recovery was counted. ed in the ECL Advance western blotting detection kit (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) overnight, followed by additional incubation overnight with either goat anti-human ACE2 polyclonal antibody (0.1 g/ml) at 4\u00b0C or mouse anti-actin (11250; cat #: ab6276, Cambridge, MA) after washing with TBS (3), the blotted membrane was allowed to react for another 2 hours with an HRP-conjugated rabbit anti sections were cut first, stained with toluidine blue. sections were examined under a Philips 201 or CM-100 electron microscope at 60 kV. confluent 2B4 cells grown in T-75 flasks were infected with either viruses (MOI = 0.1) or remained uninfected for 12, 24, and 48 hrs. supernatants were harvested from differentially treated cultures at 12, 24, and 48 hrs p.i. for subsequent analyses of viral yields and cytokine profiling. results of these analyses indicated that the RNA samples used and the data generated after normalization were of sufficiently high quality for subsequent analyses. for statistical purposes, all 27 arrays were analyzed as 18 separate groups (mock-, SARS-CoV-infected, and DHOV-infected cells at 12, 24, and 48 hrs) the GeneSifter-based normalization was followed by pairwise comparisons of average group values and Student's t test with Benjamini and Hochberg correction. data-mining, gene ontology and TF analysis for DNA microarray data were used to identify the independence and redundancy of the gene expression over time. all of the genes whose expressions were significantly altered were analyzed against the available human genomes to assign the most characteristic gene ontology terms to each cluster of genes. supernatants of virally infected cultures were subjected to a serially 3-fold dilution on vero E6 monolayer grown on to the 96-well plates. after absorption for an hour, the medium was decanted to remove unbound VSV, followed by addition of 100 l/well of culture medium containing 1% methylcellulose. the infected cultures were stained with crystal violet (1%) for enumerating the plaques. cells were pre-treated with rIFN- (PBL), rIFN-1, or IFN-2 (Peprotech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ) for 24 hrs before challenging with SARS-CoV (MOI = 0.01) for 72 hrs. a two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's post-hoc test was used to establish statistical significance between groups (p0.05).
