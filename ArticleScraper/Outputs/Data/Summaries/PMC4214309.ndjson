{"summary": "potential participants were asked to participate in the study on a voluntary basis if they were 18 years of age and were able to provide consent. Upon inclusion in the study, participants were sampled and followed up before departing from France (on October 2, 2013) and immediately before leaving Saudi Arabia (on October 24, 2013). Nasal and throat swab specimens collected from participants were placed in viral transport media. kept at 20\u00b0C before being transported to a laboratory in Marseille for storage at 80\u00b0C within 48 h of collection. a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System was used to analyze categorical variables. p values 0.05 were considered significant. participants were recruited on a voluntary basis if they were 18 years of age. nasal and throat swab specimens were collected from each participant by using rigid cotton-tipped swab applicators 10 days before participants departed from France (pre-Hajj specimens) only 1 day before they left Saudi Arabia (post-Hajj specimens) samples were placed in viral transport media at the time of collection. quantitative real-time PCRs for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Bordetella pertussis, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. reactions were performed by using a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System. p values 0.05 were considered significant. most (90.7%) pilgrims had 1 respiratory symptom, including cough (86.8%), sore throat (82.9%), rhinorrhea (72.1%), myalgia (50.4%), fever (49.6%), and dyspnea (21.7%). only 1 pilgrim (0.8%) was hospitalized during the stay in Saudi Arabia. none had received the 2013 influenza vaccine before departing for the Hajj. 44.2% reported having received the seasonal influenza vaccine in 2012. 53.5% of pilgrims reported frequent use (9.3%) or occasional use (44.2%) of facemasks; 93.0% used disposable handkerchiefs; 49.6% reported frequent handwashing. a high prevalence of HRV was observed in pre-Hajj and post-Hajj specimens (12.4% vs. 0%; p0.001) of 19 participants whose post-Hajj specimens were positive for HRV, 17 (89.5%) had acquired the infection during their stay in Saudi Arabia. 0.62 Human metapneumovirus ND ND NA 2 (1.7) 1 (0.8) 0.61 Human parainfluenza viruses ND ND NA 4 (3.3) 1 (0.8) 0.20 Human parechovirus ND ND NA 0 0 NA Human respiratory syncytial virus 0 0 NA 0 1 (0.8) 1 Human rhinovirus 5 (3.0) 13 (8.4) 0.036 17 (14.0) 19 (14.7) 0.88 At least 1 virus 8 (4.3) the prevalence of influenza A and B viruses was significantly higher in post-Hajj specimens than in pre-Hajj specimens. 43 (86.0%) reported 1 respiratory symptom during their stay in Saudi Arabia. 53 (71.6%) still had respiratory symptoms at the time of sampling. Detection of Respiratory Bacteria Pre-Hajj and post-Hajj throat swab specimens were obtained from 126 (97.7%) and 129 (100%) participants. none of the participants were positive for N. meningitidis, B. pertussis, or M. pneumoniae at any point in the study period. the prevalence of S. pneumoniae in post-Hajj specimens was significantly lower in persons who reported using hand sanitizer during their stay in Saudi Arabia than in remaining participants. of 80 participants whose post-Hajj specimens were positive for S. pneumoniae, 27 (33.8%) were co-infected with 1 virus. most (90.7%) pilgrims had 1 respiratory symptom, including cough (86.8%), sore throat (82.9%), rhinorrhea (72.1%), myalgia (50.4%), fever (49.6%), and dyspnea (1.7%). onset of respiratory symptoms peaked in the second week (week 41) after the arrival of the pilgrims in Mecca and decreased thereafter. only 1 pilgrim (0.8%) was hospitalized during the stay in Saudi Arabia. none of the other preventive measures was found to be effective in preventing ILI symptoms during the stay in Saudi Arabia. the prevalence of human coronavirus E229 (HCoV-E229) was significantly higher in post-Hajj specimens than in pre-Hajj specimens (12.4% vs. 0%; p0.001). of 19 participants whose post-Hajj specimens were positive for HRV, 17 (89.5%) had acquired the infection during their stay in Saudi Arabia.
