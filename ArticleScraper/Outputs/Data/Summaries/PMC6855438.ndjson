{"summary": "the majority of congenital infections in humans is subclinical [2,5] and is not associated with easily identifiable brain lesions or birth defects. animal models addressing sequelae in offspring may provide valuable information about outcomes of mild congenital ZIKV infection in offspring. postnatal ZIKV infection in macaque infants resulted in altered emotional reactivity to acute stress [14], the evidence is still lacking for the cumulative impact of subclinical in utero ZIKV infection and postnatal environmental insults on health sequelae in offspring. pigs are relevant to model human in utero ZIKV infection [17\u201319] and associated immunopathology and brain pathology in offspring. subclinical in utero infection imposes IFN- sequelae and molecular brain pathology in offspring that did not have clinical signs of congenital Zika syndrome. we inoculated two conceptuses from three sows with 105 TCID50/fetus at 53\u201354 gd. pigs have 14\u201316 fetuses with each fetus possessing individual amniotic membrane and placenta. two fetuses in each pregnant pig were directly inoculated (I) with ZIKV. fetal brains of directly inoculated and trans-infected fetuses were collected at necropsy. placental samples collected at birth and offspring brains did not have histopathological lesions (Fig 2A\u20132D). Fig 2. Histology, viral loads, and ZIKV-specific Ab responses. to confirm in utero infection, we demonstrated high loads of ZIKV in amniotic membranes and placenta from all three ZIKV-exposed litters. we also detected ZIKV RNA by in situ hybridization in the placenta and by RT-qPCR targeting the negative strand of ZIKV RNA in the placenta and placenta. two ZIKV-specific RT-qPCR assays did not show viral RNA in the blood plasma, cerebrum, and cerebellum from all exposed and control piglets. subclinical in utero infection is associated with IFN- sequelae in affected offspring. maternal blood IFN- levels in ZIKV litters were lower or equal to that in control litters (P 0.23) maternal blood IFN- levels in ZIKV litters were lower or equal to that in control litters (P 0.23) maternal IFN- is unlikely to affect fetuses and offspring as it does not cross through the human or porcine placenta. we do not know whether lower levels of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17A, TNF, and IFN- in offspring at 32 days after birth were caused by subclinical in utero ZIKV infection. subclinical in utero infection and social stress induce synergistic pathological effect on cytokine responses in offspring. piglets in control group showed a slight, up to a 2-fold decrease (1.30.3) in blood plasma IFN- levels. piglets affected with subclinical in utero infection showed dramatic, up to a 31-fold decrease (6.88.5) FN- responses in offspring subdivided into two subgroups. stress did not induce a significant decrease in other tested cytokines. stress did not induce a significant decrease in other tested cytokines. no history of in utero infection were sampled at 37 days after birth. genes with altered expression in the PFC of virus-affected offspring were positively enriched. genes with altered expression in the PFC of virus-affected offspring were positively enriched. cortisol levels were higher in utero cortisol levels during persistent ZIKV infection. cortisol levels were higher in piglets (S3E Fig; S1F Table) cortisol levels were higher in hair, a well-established test to assess chronic stress throughout the lifespan. all subnetworks with FDR-adjusted P 0.1 and at least three connected nodes are shown. all subnetworks with FDR-adjusted P 0.1 are pathways with positive and blue are with negative enrichment. a considerable number of upregulated and downregulated GO processes were also shared between N and P subgroups. this analysis suggests that subclinical in utero ZIKV infection may cause similar molecular pathology in the brain of offspring both positive and negative for ZIKV-specific Ab. females and males shared 118 enriched biological processes (S2M Table) but significantly larger loss of affected neuronal and behavior pathways (FDR-adjusted P 0.05) was observed in males (Fig 8B and Fig 8D) this suggests a greater loss of neuronal function in males. ZIKV replication in the porcine placental mesenchyme is associated with the increased number of CD163-positive cells [37]. to provide independent support for the sex-specific pattern of transcriptional responses to ZIKV infection, we profiled the whole genome expression in placental samples persistently infected. the number of differentially expressed genes in ZIKV-positive placental samples was considerably higher than in ZIKV-positive brain samples. the higher number of affected genes in both female and male samples is also in accord with in vitro RNA-seq studies in placental cells [54] and in vivo studies in human cells [55] GO biological vascular processes significantly altered (FDR-adjusted P 0.05) in the placenta with persistent ZIKV infection. RNA-seq results in the brain of affected offspring and virus-infected placental samples. RNA-seq results in the brain of affected offspring. control females showed more aggressive behavior than control females. 63.9% of initiated fights (P = 0.45) and 96.3% won fights (P = 0.0039) mixed tests were performed between control and affected offspring to induce social stress and assess behavior. two fetuses in each pregnant pig were directly inoculated (I) with ZIKV. fetal brains of directly inoculated and trans-infected not-manipulated fetuses were synchronized and delivered at term (114\u2013115 days) placental samples collected at birth and offspring brains did not have histopathological lesions. positive cells were found in a sample from pig #335. to confirm in utero infection, we demonstrated high loads of ZIKV in amniotic membranes and placenta from all three ZIKV-exposed litters. we also detected ZIKV RNA by in situ hybridization in the placenta and by RT-qPCR targeting the negative strand of ZIKV RNA in the placenta and amniotic membranes. these results confirm ZIKV transmission between siblings and productive, persistent infection in two RT-qPCR assays did not show viral RNA in the blood plasma, cerebrum, and cerebellum from all exposed and control piglets. subclinical in utero infection is associated with IFN- sequelae in affected offspring Subclinical in utero infection increases concentrations of IFN- in amniotic fluids and fetal blood at 28 days after inoculation. the increased IFN- levels were mostly attributed to the P subgroup with high ZIKV-specific Ab titers at birth. maternal blood IFN- levels in ZIKV litters were lower or equal to that in control litters. maternal IFN- is unlikely to affect fetuses and offspring as it does not cross through the human or porcine placenta. we do not know whether lower levels of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17A, TNF, and IFN- in utero ZIKV offspring at 32 days. maternal blood levels of these cytokines were lower in the ZIKV group. social stress induces synergistic pathological effect on cytokine responses in offspring. piglets in control group showed a slight, up to a 2-fold decrease. piglets affected with subclinical in utero infection showed dramatic, up to a 31-fold decrease (6.88.5) in blood plasma IFN- levels. stress did not induce a significant decrease in other tested cytokines. no difference in IFN- shutdown was observed between serological (N and P; P = 0.12) and sex (P = 0.29) subgroups. gene expression differed significantly between PFC samples from control offspring. genes with altered expression in the PFC of virus-affected offspring were positively enriched for processes related to cell death. genes with altered expression in the PFC of virus-affected offspring were positively enriched for processes related to cell death. fetuses showed significantly elevated cortisol levels in utero cortisol. cortisol levels were higher in utero cortisol levels during persistent ZIKV infection. cortisol levels were higher in utero cortisol levels during persistent ZIKV infection. all subnetworks with FDR-adjusted P 0.1 and at least three connected nodes are shown. neuronal and cell death biological processes in prefrontal cortex of offspring affected with subclinical in utero ZIKV infection. subclinical in utero ZIKV infection may cause similar molecular pathology in the brain of offspring both positive and negative for ZIKV-specific Ab at birth. female and male offspring showed a distinct transcriptional signature in the PFC. pathway analysis of significantly altered processes also attributed neuronal and behavioral pathways to male offspring. this suggests a greater loss of neuronal function in males, which is in a strong agreement with more prominent ZIKV-induced neurocognitive pathology in male mouse offspring. l placental mesenchyme is associated with increased number of CD163-positive cells. we profiled whole genome expression in placental samples persistently infected with ZIKV. sex-specific pattern in placental samples also exhibited considerable sex-specific pattern. positive placental samples were significantly higher than in ZIKV-positive brain samples. higher number of altered genes in both female and male samples is also in agreement with in vitro RNA-seq studies in placental cells. RNA-seq results in the brain of affected offspring and virus-infected placental samples. we tested whether molecular pathology in the brain of affected offspring is associated with altered behavior in the normal environment and during stress. compared fighting in control and ZIKV offspring (S2 Video) 63.9% of initiated fights (P = 0.45) and 96.3% won fights (P = 0.0039) mixed tests were performed between control and ZIKV-affected offspring to induce social stress and assess behavior. subclinical in utero ZIKV infection was associated with abnormal IFN- responses in apparently healthy offspring under normal environmental conditions. ae suggests link between fetal IFN- pathways reprogrammed during in utero ZIKV infection [18,37] and altered IFN- responses in offspring. fetal development may program postnatal immune and neurological pathology which can be transferred across generations [63\u201366] piglets were inoculated with 105.8 TCID50 ZIKV intracerebrally, intradermally, or intraperitoneally cleared the virus from lymphoid tissues within seven days [75] piglets inoculated with 105.8 TCID50 intracerebrally, intradermally, or intraperitoneally cleared the virus from lymphoid tissues within seven days [75] in utero acquired ZIKV-induced IFN- pathology is most likely attributed to changes in peripheral blood cells. hematopoietic stem cells in affected fetuses and offspring may have different mechanistic background. cognitive impairment, severe neurological sequelae, seizures, prefrontal hypometabolism and psychiatric syndromes were described in adult and pediatric patients treated with therapeutic doses of IFN- [93\u201398]. affected IFN- responses during stress, specifically, the stress-induced IFN- shutdown, might also influence the susceptibility of offspring to other infections. offspring brains were negative for ZIKV, suggesting transcriptional changes in the PFC may be a persistent representation of earlier ZIKV replication in their brains during subclinical in utero infection. we believe that ZIKV caused brain infection in at least some offspring during their in utero fetal life and was subsequently cleared. in the N subgroup, most of them had infection in their individual amniotic membranes and placenta collected at birth. fetal, amniotic membrane, and placental blood circulations are intimately interconnected. the role of immune responses to ZIKV at the maternal-fetal interface in birth defects has been also suggested. piglets showed more dramatic molecular pathology in the brain and placenta. most affected biological processes related to neuropathology were represented by male offspring. male offspring affected with mild ZIKV infection showed higher risk of developing neurocognitive disorders. future experiments should use larger sample size, longer observational periods, and a broader panel of methods for behavioral and cognitive research in pigs [114\u2013119]. findings should encourage further efforts to better understand silent pathology in fetuses and offspring, monitor utero ZIKV-affected human cohorts. to exclude porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) in utero infection, we tested blood plasma collected from all newborns at birth, before feeding colostrum, for PCV2 antibodies. pregnant pigs were randomly assigned into control (three animals) and ZIKV (three animals) groups. fetal location was selected to maximize the virus spread within the uterus. we collected blood samples from mothers at 53\u201354 and 112 gestation days. piglets were monitored for 36 days for clinical signs by veterinarians. blood centrifugation (2,000g, 20 min, +4\u00b0C) plasma was aliquoted and immediately frozen (-80\u00b0C) piglets were euthanized by licensed veterinarians with an anesthetic overdose followed by exsanguination. pigs were rapidly exsanguinated to ensure a quick death. mixing test was performed at 35 days after birth to determine effects of subclinical in utero ZIKV infection on blood cytokine levels and aggressive behavior. mixing pairs were individually marked with numbers on their backs, relocated to the mixing room and simultaneously released into individual unfamiliar mixing pens. video recordings were recorded for 120 min, as most fights between unfamiliar pigs occur during the first few hours after mixing. three blinded investigators performed analyses of behavioral data. observations were compared (initiators: Fleiss\u2019 kappa = 0.81, winners: Fleiss\u2019 kappa = 0.98) and averaged both in males and females. tximport in R and normalized using EdgeR then converted into a normal distribution using the voom function. correction was done directly in the linear model by setting sex as a variable in the model. maternal cytokines levels between control and ZIKV groups and within groups were compared with Bonferroni-corrected repeated measures analysis of variance. IFN- levels in offspring blood plasma sampled at birth were compared between control and ZIKV groups with Mann-Whitney U-test. six, pregnancy-matched Landrace-cross pigs were obtained from a high-health status herd free for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. to exclude porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) in utero infection, we tested blood plasma collected from all newborns at birth, before feeding colostrum, for PCV2 antibodies. two fetuses close to the uterine bifurcation were directly inoculated. this fetal location was selected in order to maximize the virus spread within the uterus. piglets were monitored for 36 days for clinical signs by veterinarians. blood was collected in sterile EDTA tubes with vacutainer blood-sampling system. plasma was aliquoted and immediately frozen (-80\u00b0C) piglets were euthanized at 37 days of age. mixing test was performed at 35 days after birth to determine effects of subclinical in utero ZIKV infection on blood cytokine levels and aggressive behavior in a stressful environment. piglets were mixed with males, females with females; piglets' body weight differences did not exceed 1 kg; piglets' body weight differences did not exceed 1 kg. pigs were staying separated for 60 s or more for every fight. the pig that first stopped fighting, retreated, turned away from its opponent or tried to flee was considered to be the loser of the fight. from these observations, we calculated the ratio of initiated fights and the ratio of winners within the group. a sequence database of coding and non-coding transcripts was generated from ENSEMBL Sus scrofa 11.1. the count table was assembled using tximport in R and normalized using EdgeR. correction for sex was done directly in the linear model by setting sex as a variable in the model. prevalence of stillborn and weak piglets was compared using Pearson\u2019s chi-squared test with Yates\u2019 correction for continuity. maternal cytokines levels between control and ZIKV groups were compared with Bonferroni-corrected repeated measures analysis of variance. each horn contains multiple fetuses with each fetus possessing individual amniotic membrane and placenta. two fetuses in each pregnant pig were directly inoculated with ZIKV or control media. most conceptuses (a fetus with fetal membranes) within the uterus are infected.
