{"summary": "MERS-CoV is genetically distinct from the SARS virus. symptoms include breathing difficulties, fever, cough, muscle aches, chest pain, vomiting and diarrhea. there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine available for the virus. the public health agency of Canada has been meeting this need for information by conducting regular risk assessments on MERS-CoV. this risk assessment summary is to describe the methodology, the assessment of the risk, the risk mitigation and leading to the current risk-level of MERS-CoV to Canadians living in the country. as of September 23, 2014, the WHO has reported 846 confirmed human cases, including 298 deaths. in 2013 and 2014, a sharp upsurge in cases was reported from KSA accounting for 48% of all cases and 38% of all deaths reported to date (5). 113 retrospective cases between May 2013 to May 2014 were reported in late June 2014. people having had contact with camels or camel products are at increased risk of infection with MERS-CoV. transmission patterns of secondary cases in healthcare settings and households have also been shown to be at increased risk of infection (5). limited secondary transmission has been reported in only two of the previously mentioned countries (10) there have been no cases identified in Canada (Figure 1). there have been no cases identified in Canada (Figure 1). secondary cases generally present with milder disease or no symptoms. however severe illness, including death, has been observed in secondary cases including healthcare workers (HCWs) evidence from camel serology studies and genetic sequencing of the virus suggests that camels are likely a primary source for MERS-CoV infections in humans. the current risk to Canadians for acquiring MERS-CoV infections is considered low. no sustained human-to-human transmission has been observed. the primary route of transmission is still believed to be direct or indirect contact with camels or camel products. Canada and its PT partners have established robust surveillance and communications systems designed to detect and report emerging pathogens such as MERS -CoV. the PHAC-CIHR Influenza Research (PCIRN) Serious Outcome Surveillance Network consisting of 45 participating adult hospitals across Canada is designed to detect SARI hospital ICU admissions. there have been no reported confirmed cases of MERS-CoV associated with the 2012 and 2013 Hajj pilgrimages. the public health risk posed by MERS-CoV to Canada continues to be low based on available information at this time."}
