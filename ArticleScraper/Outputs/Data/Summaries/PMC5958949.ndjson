{"summary": "small molecules are conventional therapeutic candidates that can be easily synthesized and administered. many of these small molecules are not specific to their targets and may lead to side effects. however, many of these small molecules are not specific to their targets. peptidomimetic design can be a valuable solution to circumvent some undesirable properties of therapeutic peptides. peptidomimetics can mimic the biologic activity of parent peptides with the advantages of improving both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. the first generation of peptidomimetics (Type 1) mimics the local topography of amide bond. it includes amide bond isosteres,30 pyrrolinones31 or short fragments of secondary structure, such as beta-turns. a number of prosperous instances of Type 1 peptidomimetics have been reported. theoretical and computational techniques to design proteins, peptides and peptidomimetics are reviewed. however, the current review does not deeply highlight the computational aspects of amino acid-based therapeutic design. peptidomimetics known as hybrid peptides contain at least two dissimilar types of amino acids linked to each other via a peptide bond. the structures of three important amino acid-based therapeutics approved by the FDA are shown in the pie diagram. gene and nucleic acid-based therapies: 0.17% (n=6), vaccines: 2.64% (n=91), allergenics: 16.20% (n=557), cell transplant therapies: 0.14% (n=5), small-molecule drugs: 72.76% (n=2,501). template-based designing The problem of predicting the fold of an unknown sequence could be solved by utilizing templates. sequence search techniques sample different sequences and estimate their energies to gain the one owing the minimum energy. deterministic approaches focus on characterizing the sequence space probabilistically. deterministic approaches are perfect to design proteins with small sizes. the Monte Carlo algorithm performs iterative series of calculations. at the primary step of each search, both rotamer state and amino acid identity are adjusted and an efficient temperature controls the probable energy alterations. a variety of rotamer libraries have been developed for protein design. the effective rotamers can model cofactors, ligands, water and posttranslational modifications. a protein is selected so that it can adjust the energetic and geometric constraints enforced by the favorite fold. a retroaldol enzyme,43 the Kemp elimination enzyme,70 a novel protein,71 a redesigned procarboxypeptidase,72 a novel / protein structure and the TOP773 are shown in Table 1. the design of a novel / protein structure, TOP7 was experimentally found to be folded and extremely stable. the X-ray crystal structure of top7 was similar to the design model 73 Template-based designing The problem of predicting the fold of an unknown sequence could be solved by using templates. optimization processes may recognize candidate sequences using stochastic or deterministic methods. deterministic approaches focus on characterizing the sequence space probabilistically. the most widely used method for protein design includes Monte Carlo sampling. the Monte Carlo algorithm performs iterative series of calculations. at the primary step of each search, a partially accidental test sequence is generated, and its energy is calculated via a physical potential. the temperature gradually decreases and permits favorable sampling of lower-energy configurations. amino acids permitted at each position are defined as \"degrees of freedom for each amino acid\" a variety of approaches have been proposed to decrease the degrees of freedom for each amino acid. the template contains a group of backbone atom coordinates. the coordinates can be retrieved from an available X-ray crystal structure or cautiously from a nuclear magnetic resonance structure. this fold has been detected as one of the most shared structures in 21 distinct protein superfamilies. dee compares two amino acid rotamers and removes one with greater interaction energy. the situation is repetitively examined for total amino acid states as well as their rotamers. entropy-based formalism has been defined to predict amino acid probabilities for a certain backbone structure. the method employs concepts from statistical thermodynamics to assess the site-specific probabilities. the simplest amino acids including alanine and glycine have only one rotamer status. the bigger amino acids have >80 diverse rotamer statuses. a variety of rotamer libraries have been developed for protein design. deterministic approaches focus on characterizing the sequence space probabilistically. deterministic methods include dead-end elimination (DEE), 46 self-consistent mean field,47 graph decomposition and linear programming. a partially accidental test sequence is generated, and its energy is calculated via a physical potential. the temperature gradually decreases and permits favorable sampling of lower-energy configurations. the method employs concepts from statistical thermodynamics to assess the site-specific probabilities. monomers can be used to probe a protein structure59 and improve its function,60 other than the naturally occurring amino acids. simplest amino acids including alanine and glycine have only one rotamer status, while bigger amino acids have >80 diverse rotamer statuses. the results demonstrate the power of combining computational protein design with directed evolution for generating novel enzymes 70 A novel protein De novo design included a -sheet forming a tight core with the helix A stand-alone motif was de novo designed with a stable tertiary structure The designed small protein may provide a model system for a protein-folding study. 93-residue / protein named Top7 with a novel sequence and topology Top7 was experimentally found to be folded and extremely stable. the X-ray crystal structure of Top7 was similar to the design model 73 Peptide design Methods and tools Peptide design methods have been categorized as ligand- and target-based design methods. property-based design methods for peptides are in the early stages of development. a model was built to estimate peptide G values for binding to the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein HLA-A*0201.78. pharmacophore hypothesis was proposed to allow continuous attempts in the rational design of melanocortin-4 receptor isoforms. target-based design is initiated with the computer-aided survey of a ligand-bound or unbound protein target to recognize its potential binding sites. a curated database of 103 protein\u2013peptide complexes is curated. the abundance of the structural information specifically on monomeric proteins could be gathered to design protein\u2013peptide interactions with no requirement for their sequence homology. the program predicts anchoring origins on a protein surface. an assumed peptide conformation is refined using an anchor-constrained molecular dynamic process. the program uses ambiguous interaction restraints based on experimental information about intermolecular interactions. long-term molecular dynamic simulation was used and a two-state model was built. the second step was a slow modification phase, in which the water molecules were emptied out from the space between the peptide ligand and the receptor. the mentioned two-state model was verified to trace some oligopeptide routes for binding to various PDZ domains. the structure-based process takes the information derived from 3D structures of protein\u2013peptide complexes to predict the binding affinity. the quantitative structure\u2013activity relationships (QSARs) have been widely used to forecast the binding affinity of peptides and conclude the biologic function. the VitAL method pools verterbi algorithm with AutoDock to design peptides for the binding sites of a target. this approach was tested on three dissimilar peptide\u2013protein domains to assess its ability. peptide docking Ben-Shimon and Niv104 HADDOCK Protein\u2013peptide docking Trellet et al105 CABS-dock

bridging the side chains of cysteine residues in the Pl and P3 inhibitor subsites. two rounds of in silico screening were performed to discover potential peptidomimetics able to mimic a cyclic peptide (CPFVKTQLC) that is known to bind the anb3 integrin receptor. the most potent representatives were at least 2,000 times better than the original cyclopeptide (around 2 mM) the top-ranking drug matches were docked to the peptide-binding site. the majority of the top-ranking matches presented a negative free energy change upon binding that was comparable to the standard peptide. similarity of amino acid motifs to Compounds web server was developed to ease screening of identified motif structures against bioactive compound databases. motif matching can be full or partial that may decrease or enhance the number of potential mimetics, respectively. the database was used as a skeleton to develop pepMMsMIMIC. the 3D structure of a protein-bound peptide is used as an input. chemical structures able to mimic the pharmacophore and shape similarity of the original peptide are proposed to involve in the protein\u2013protein recognition. ligand- and target-based design methods have been categorized as ligand- and target-based design methods. ligand-based design is classified as sequence-based, 2) property-based and 3) conformation-based design. ligand-based design has been classified as follows: 1) sequence-based, 2) property-based and 3) conformation-based design. philicity, hydrophobicity and volume were used to model peptide binding to targets of interest. a model was built to estimate peptide G values for binding to the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein HLA-A*0201.78. atorial tetrapeptide library was screened, and ligand-derived pharmacophore templates were generated. target-based design is initiated with the computer-aided survey of a ligand-bound or unbound protein target to recognize its potential binding sites. traditional docking protocols, such as AutoDock, Vina92,93 and MOE-Dock,94 developed for docking of small molecules, were also used to dock a peptide to a protein receptor. however, comparative studies revealed that these techniques would face failure if the docked peptides were >3 residues long. ADDOCK has been recently expanded to run the flexible peptide\u2013protein docking. the novel HADDOCK strategy initiates docking computations from an ensemble of three dissimilar peptide conformations (eg, -helix, extended and polyproline-II) that are high informative inputs. the affinity of BH3 peptides to Bcl-2 protein was investigated. results showed that the highly structured peptides could increase their affinity through reducing the entropic loss associated with the binding. quantitative structure\u2013activity relationships (QSARs) have been widely used to predict the binding affinity of peptides and conclude the biologic function. the relationship between the biologic activity and molecular structure is an important issue in biology and biochemistry. ligand-based design has been classified as follows: 1) sequence-based, 2) property-based and 3) conformation-based design. sequence-based approach uses the information of conserved regions and analyzes the multiple sequence alignments. this method is directed by the hypothesis conserved regions are functionally and structurally significant. antimicrobial peptides were successfully analyzed by using the property-based approach. in a wide range of studies, antimicrobial peptides were successfully analyzed by using the property-based approach. e hypothesis was proposed to allow continuous attempts in the rational design of melanocortin receptor molecules. target-based design is initiated with the computer-aided survey of a ligand-bound or unbound protein target to recognize its potential binding sites, prospective specificity surfaces and other pharmacologic activity elements. 93 and MOE-Dock,94 developed for docking of small molecules, were also used to dock a peptide to a protein receptor. however, comparative studies revealed that these techniques would face failure if the docked peptides were >3 residues long. the novel HADDOCK strategy initiates docking computations from an ensemble of three dissimilar peptide conformations (eg, -helix, extended and polyproline-II) that are high informative inputs. the process is followed by replica exchange Monte Carlo dynamics. the affinity of BH3 peptides to Bcl-2 protein was investigated. results showed higher affinity of bound peptides occurred when the corresponding peptides were in a lower degree of disorder in unbound states. the relationship between the biologic activity and molecular structure is an important issue in biology and biochemistry. a combination of the QSAR method with a statistic-based technique may bring out the best in each other and can be a trend in future developments of drug discovery. a rise in the number of protein\u2013peptide 3D structures deposited in the PDB has assisted to search the molecular mechanism and structural basis of peptide recognition and binding. Dynamic data of the complexes can be partially extracted from the solution NMR structures deposited in the PDB. heuristic evolution procedures were applied to search the large conformational space of linear peptides before the binding. however, these procedures were not efficient and their use was limited. several illustrative approaches were proposed to balance between accuracy and efficacy of the flexible peptide docking. peptide docking tool runs a primary docking procedure. random conformations of a peptide are predicted and located around the protein target of interest. 10 models are selected for the last optimization using the Modeller tool to gain accurate scoring and ranking poses. these results showed that highly structured peptides could increase their affinity through reducing the entropic loss associated with the binding. the entropic effect and conformational flexibility could be willingly examined with atomistic simulations. a combination of the QSAR method with a statistic-based technique may bring out the best in each other. the significance of domain-peptide recognition has been recently illustrated in the metabolic pathway and cell signaling. this approach was tested on three dissimilar peptide\u2013protein domains to assess its ability. a brief list of available computational resources is presented in Table 2. some computational methods have been proposed to design peptidomimetics. these methods can be classified based on their specificity to translate peptides to peptidomimetics. virtual screening of 300,000 commercially available small molecules based on the RIP-based pharmacophore was used. the method is especially useful when the X-ray structures of protein\u2013protein complexes exist. the pharmacophore hypothesis was made based on a homology model of the protein cavity. two of the top scoring molecules were detected as micromolar inhibitors of HIV-1 replication. the pharmacophore-based screening was used to find the novel Alzheimer\u2019s therapeutics as mimetics of neurotrophins. the search process allows scanning a library of small molecules that mimic the tertiary structure of a query peptide followed by scanning a protein library where a query for small molecule can adopt into the backbone. the algorithm allows mapping the side chain-like substituents on every compound of a large chemical library. pepMMsMIMIC138 was developed to pool the conventional pharmacophore matching with shape complementarity. a library of 17 million conformers was extracted from 3.9 million commercially available chemicals. the database was used as a skeleton to develop pepMMsMIMIC. hypothesis When the structure of the host protein is only available Appropriate to a large-scale virtual screening campaign 3D pharmacophoric hypothesis is required. protein atom-type parameterization is necessary Sequence based Method is used to rank peptide\u2013compound matches that is limited to short linear motifs in proteins and compounds involving amino acid substituents. in recent years, there are growing examples on the approval of monoclonal antibodies (therapeutic antibodies) by the FDA. this important area of amino acid-based therapeutics has been covered in more depth elsewhere."}
