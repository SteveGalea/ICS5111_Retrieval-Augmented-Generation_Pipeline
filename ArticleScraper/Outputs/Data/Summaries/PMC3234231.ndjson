{"summary": "RNA viruses use a vast array of coding and gene expression strategies to maximize the utility and regulation of their genomes. recoding of stop codons as sense codons allows ribosomes to continue translating past the normal termination point of an open reading frame (ORF) event occurs inefficiently, thus the C-terminally extended, or RT, product is made at much lower levels than the pre-RT product [2], [5]. seven of these genera express their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) by RT, while one, Dianthovirus, uses translational frameshifting. frameshifting involves shifting a translating ribosome from the 0 reading frame to the -1 reading frame, where it resumes translation of the nascent polypeptide [13], [14]. base pairing interaction proposed to direct delivery of 3'CITE-recruited translational machinery to the 5'-proximal site of translation initiation [20] additional long-range RNA-RNA interactions have been identified in tombusvirus genomes that mediate other important viral processes such as, transcription of viral subgenomic (sg) mRNAs. arrows connect RNA sequences that base pair over long distances. an additional long-range RNA-RNA interaction, the UL-DL interaction, unites two important RNA replication elements, RII and RIV, so that replicase complex assembly can occur. wge translation system and subsequent sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were used to assess translational RT leading to production of p95 from the wt CIRV RNA genome. results are consistent with assigned identities of the major and minor bands generated from the wt CIRV genome as p36 and its RT product p95. deletion of the 3'CITE and RIV in mutant CIRV-dRIV resulted in retained RT, although at lower than wt levels. a long-range RNA-RNA interaction is required for RT Sequences and structures 3'-adjacent to RT sites are often instrumental in facilitating the RT process. the predicted SL-PRTE structure was consistent with the results of comparative RNA secondary structure analysis of sequenced species in the genus Tombusvirus (Figure S2). however, close analysis of RIV secondary structure revealed a 6 nt long sequence in a predicted single-stranded RNA region, termed the distal readthrough element (DRTE). the relative values for viral genome accumulation correspond to means ( standard error) from three independent experiments. two sets of CIRV genomic compensatory mutants were generated. the first set targeted a single pair in the proposed interaction. the second set targeted three pairs simultaneously. similar SHAPE analysis at the DRTE was not possible as it is located too close to the 3'-end to allow for oligonucleotide priming. similar SHAPE analysis at the DRTE was not possible as it is located too close to the 3'-end to allow for oligonucleotide priming. in vivo evidence for an RT defect in viral genomes containing a disrupted PRTE-DRTE interaction. however, we were not able to demonstrate that the PRTE-DRTE interaction was able to mediate RT in vivo. the wt and mutant combinations showed no evidence of an interaction. replication-defective versions of mutants B1 and B2, termed B1Rd and B2Rd, did not support efficient replication of DI-7 in trans. if inability of B1Rd and B2Rd to amplify DI-7 was based on an RT defect that caused insufficient levels of p95, then it should be possible to rescue DI-7 replication by providing p95 in trans from an alternate source. RT analysis using replication-defective genomes and a DI RNA replicon reporter. diagrams of non-replicating CIRV genomes used to assess p95 production. mutants Rd and B3Rd are RT-defective and can produce p36 and p95. RT needed to be uncoupled from the long-range interaction. the linear TMV readthrough element (RTE), CAAUUA, was inserted downstream of the p36 stop codon in RT-defective B2 and BS2. this led to relatively efficient recovery of RT in vitro. however, the level of viral genome accumulation was not restored to that of wt. wt and mutant CIRV genomes containing mutations disrupting the PRTE-DRTE interaction (B2 and BS2) and the mutated TMV RTE (B2T and BS2T) mutated wt TMV RTE (B2TN and BS2TN) and mutated wt TMV RTE (B2TN and BS2TN) were analyzed in wge. DI-8-B2 and DI-8-BS2 with substitutions in the PRTE showed 1.8- and 2.6-fold enhanced levels of accumulation. the enhanced levels observed for DI-8-B2 and DI-8-BS2 are consistent with an inhibitory role for the interaction. the results for DI-8-B1 and DI-8-BS1 suggest the opposite. DI-7 and DI-8 RNAs were analyzed 22 hr post-transfection. relative values below the lanes correspond to means ( standard error) from three independent experiments. Mutants DI-8-B1,-B2, -B3, -BS1, -BS2 and -BS3 contain the same substitutions as in genomic mutants B1, B2, BS1, BS2 and BS3 respectively. close examination of the structure of RIV revealed the possibility of an alternative central hairpin, termed SL-T. formation of either SL-T or replication-essential SL-2 would be mutually exclusive. this could provide a means to facilitate either RT via formation of SL-T or RNA replication via formation of SL-2. SL-2 is antagonistic to RT while SL-T is beneficial to replication. substitutions in RIV (in red) predicted to influence formation of SL-2 and SL-T. mutants in the two columns to the right of \"SL-2-preferential\" or \"SL-T-preferential\" are predicted to restore the balance of formation of \"SL-2 & SL-T\" the mutants containing preferentially-stabilized SL-2 accumulated between 50% to near wt levels. all were severely defective, while engineering a closer balance between SL-2 and SL-T efficiently restored DI-7 accumulation in all mutants. these results directly contrast those for RT, in that SL-2 formation was found to be compatible with replication while SL-T formation was inhibitory. mutant SL-2B-R showed a level of reactivity lower than its mutant SL-2B counterpart. this intermediate level of reactivity corresponded to partial recovery of RT (55%) for mutant SL-2B-R. mutant SL-TD-R directed an intermediate level of RT (50%) (Figure 7C, right panel) the UL-DL interaction facilitates RT Our inability to demonstrate RT using a dual luciferase reporter mRNA with relevant viral regulatory regions suggested that the viral genomic context may be important for RT activity. the multiple functional long-range interactions that occur in tombusviruses suggest that proper global folding of the viral genome is critical. non-replicating CIRV genomes cotransfected with DI-7 are indicated below each bar in the graph. a similar defect also occurred in vivo, an approach akin to that described in Figure 4 was used. SLs with the PRTEs in a bulge were similar in general structure. in turnip crinkle virus (TCV), the DRTE is predicted to reside in the apical loop of the 3'-terminal SL, termed Pr, which is the core promoter for minus-strand synthesis. however, for other carmoviruses, like Saguaro cactus virus, the DRTE is instead located in the apical loop the carmovirus TCV was selected as: carmovirus represents the largest genera in Tombusviridae. previous studies attempted, unsuccessfully, to define the RT elements in TCV [40], [41] and the 3'-terminus of TCV is well-defined structurally and functionally [42]\u2013[47]. in vitro translation in wge of wt and mutant TCV genomes containing mutations shown in panel A. the same gel was exposed for different times, as indicated, in order to better visualize bands corresponding to p88 and p28. RT efficiency fell to 6% when both the 3'CITE and RIV were deleted. deletion of the 3'-terminal RIV in mutant CIRV-dRIV resulted in retained RT, albeit at lower than wt levels. a long-range RNA-RNA interaction is required for RT sequences. the predicted SL-PRTE structure was consistent with the results of comparative RNA secondary structure analysis of sequenced species in the genus Tombusvirus (Figure S2). however, close analysis of RIV secondary structure revealed a 6 nt long sequence in a predicted single-stranded RNA region, termed the distal readthrough element (DRTE). the relative values for viral genome accumulation correspond to means ( standard error) from three independent experiments. the first set targeted a single pair in the proposed interaction. the second set targeted three pairs simultaneously (BS1, BS2 and BS3). more distal flanking residues that were not predicted to participate in the long-range interaction served as useful internal controls. similar SHAPE analysis at the DRTE was not possible as it is located too close to the 3'-end to allow for oligonucleotide priming. wt and mutant combinations showed no evidence of an interaction. in vivo evidence for an RT defect in viral genomes containing a disrupted PRTE-DRTE interaction. however, we were not able to demonstrate PRTE-DRTE-dependent RT in vivo. replication-defective versions of mutants B1 and B2, termed B1Rd and B2Rd, did not support efficient replication of DI-7 in trans. replication-defective versions of mutants B1 and B2, termed B1Rd and B2Rd, did not support efficient replication of DI-7 in trans. a replication-defective version of CIRV-RT (Figure 1B), RTRd, was created that would efficiently produce p95. diagrams of non-replicating CIRV genomes used to assess p95 production. mutants Rd and B3Rd are RT-defective and can produce both p36 and p95. additional modifications in the PRTE and DRTE in mutants B1Rd and B2Rd correspond to those in mutants B1, B2, and B3 respectively. RT needed to be uncoupled from the long-range interaction. the linear TMV readthrough element (RTE), CAAUUA, was inserted downstream of the p36 stop codon in RT-defective B2 and BS2. this led to relatively efficient recovery of RT in vitro. however, the level of viral genome accumulation was not restored to that of wt. wt and mutant TMV RTE sequences in corresponding genomic mutants are shown below. in vitro translation in wge of CIRV genomes containing mutations disrupting the PRTE-DRTE interaction (B2 and BS2) or the mutated TMV RTE (B2TN and BS2TN) DRTE showed reduced levels of accumulation, while DI-8-B2 and DI-8-BS2 with substitutions in the PRTE showed 1.8- and 2.6-fold enhanced levels of accumulation respectively. the enhanced levels observed for DI-8-B2 and DI-8-BS2 are consistent with an inhibitory role for the interaction. the results for DI-8-B1 and DI-8-BS1 suggest the opposite. DI-7 and DI-8 RNAs were analyzed 22 hr post-transfection. relative values below the lanes correspond to means ( standard error) from three independent experiments. Mutants DI-8-B1,-B2, -B3, -BS1, -BS2 and -BS3 contain the same substitutions as in genomic mutants B1, B2, BS1, BS2 and BS3 respectively. close examination of the structure of RIV revealed the possibility of an alternative central hairpin, termed SL-T. formation of either SL-T or replication-essential SL-2 would be mutually exclusive. this could provide a means to facilitate either RT via formation of SL-T or RNA replication via formation of SL-2. the results support the concept that SL-2 is antagonistic to RT while SL-T is beneficial to this process. in the structure on the left, the replication-essential SL-2 is formed. in the structure on the right the proposed SL-T is shown. s with wt CIRV genome, the mutants containing preferentially-stabilized SL-2 accumulated between 50% to near wt levels. three of the four mutants were severely defective (Figure 7D, right panel), while engineering a closer balance between SL-2 and SL-T efficiently restored DI-7 accumulation in all mutants. these results directly contrast those for RT, in that SL-2 formation was found to be compatible with replication while SL-T formation was inhibitory to this mutant SL-2B-R showed a level of reactivity lower than its mutant SL-2B counterpart. this intermediate level of reactivity corresponded to partial recovery of RT (55%) for mutant SL-2B-R. mutant SL-TD-R directed an intermediate level of RT (50%) (Figure 7C, right panel) the UL-DL interaction facilitates RT Our inability to demonstrate RT using a dual luciferase reporter mRNA with relevant viral regulatory regions suggested that the viral genomic context may be important for RT activity. the UL-DL compensatory mutants were generated and tested for their ability to amplify DI-7. the results support a role for the long-range UL-DL interaction in facilitating RT in vitro and in vivo. the DRTE is predicted to reside in the apical loop of the 3'-terminal SL. for other carmoviruses, the DRTE is located in smaller SLs. in other viruses, such as panicum mosaic virus (PMV), Maize chlorotic mosaic virus (MCMV) and Oat chlorotic stunt virus (OCSV), the DRTE is located in predicted smaller SLs. the carmovirus TCV was selected as: carmovirus represents the largest genera in Tombusviridae. previous studies attempted, unsuccessfully, to define the RT elements in TCV [40], [41] and the 3'-terminus of TCV is well-defined structurally and functionally [42]\u2013[47]. this correlation between maintaining the PRTE-DRTE pairing potential and RT was also supported by protoplast transfections. wt and mutant TCV genomes containing compensatory mutations shown in panel A. the same gel was exposed for different times in order to better visualize bands corresponding to p88 and p28. the DRTE in RIV is highly integrated with RIV at different structural levels. it represents a \u201clinear\u201d intervening sequence between SL-2 and the replication silencer element SL-3. deletion of this sequence from DI-7 results in severely reduced accumulation of this replicon. the 5'UTR-3'CITE interaction facilitates efficient initiation of translation. the AS1-RS1 interaction mediates sg mRNA1 transcription [22]. the UL-DL interaction facilitates replicase complex assembly [24] and RT. RT requires the UL-DL long-distance interaction that is important for RNA replication. this represents a second link between RT and RNA replication. the specific role of the UL-DL in facilitating RT will be investigated in detail in subsequent studies. cis-coupling may be important for efficient replication of invading genomes at low multiplicity of infection. cis-preferential replication would facilitate co-evolution of the RdRp with its cognate genome. a possible answer lies in the link between RT and RIV. the PRTE-DRTE interaction would stimulate RT in cis. subsequent translation of p95 from another genome would separate the SL-PRTE-RIV interaction. a third reason for the 3'-terminal location of the DRTE could be to coordinate translation with RNA replication. the latter step could be facilitated by a yet to be determined p95-mediated event that prevents the PRTE from re-pairing with the PRTE. the combination of multiple regulatory elements and the structural link of RT with replication elements likely provide the virus with benefits that include quality control of viral genomes. long-range RNA-RNA interaction proposed for RT of the coat protein in barley yellow dwarf virus suggests this phenomenon may also extend to different types of proteins and to viruses outside of the family Tombusviridae. these types of long-range interactions contrast the shorter-range interactions that have been described in retroviruses (spanning 8 nt), [59] and alphaviruses (spanning 100-150 nt) the proximal SL for both BYDV and RCNMV, similar to the SL-PRTEs in Tombusviridae, contain a bulge in the lower 3'-half of a long stem that pairs with a distal RNA element. the distal frameshifting elements reside in loop regions of stable SL structures [15], [16], suggesting a modular rather than integrated context with respect to replication elements. a base-pairing interaction spanning 3.5 kb between the PRTE and DRTE was necessary for efficient RT. as such, it represents the sixth functional long-range (i.e. 1 kb) RNA-RNA interaction to be identified in tombusviruses. the DRTE in RIV is highly integrated with RIV at different structural levels. SL-2 facilitates primarily RT while SL-2 mediates principally RNA replication. the inter-conversion of the two structures could provide a means to regulate these two processes. such RNA switches have been implicated in the regulation of a variety of processes in viruses [48] such as dengue virus [49], [50], coronaviruses [51], HIV [52] and satellite-C RNA of TCV [53], [54]. RT down-regulates RT and p95 production and allows RIV to adopt its replication-active conformation. UL-DL long-distance interaction is important for RNA replication. this represents a second link between RT and RNA replication. in relative RT to 37% that of wt when the 3'CITE was deleted. viruses have developed strategies to produce RdRp at appropriate times and in the required amounts. in tombusviruses, the production of RdRp is coordinated with the assembly of viral replication complexes and subsequent minus-strand synthesis of genomes. cis-preferential replication would facilitate the co-evolution of the RdRp. cis-preferential replication would facilitate the co-evolution of the RdRp. a possible answer lies in the link between RT and RIV. the subsequent dissociation of p95 from SL-PRTE would cause RT to be down-regulated, thereby providing an opportunity for the replicase to copy the genome free of ribosome traffic. the UL-DL interaction required for RT would have to reform following p95 synthesis, while the PRTE-DRTE interaction would need to be inhibited to prevent further RT. some aspects of the mechanisms proposed for CIRV likely also apply to these viruses. for this virus, direct RdRp binding may be the regulatory mechanism shutting down RT and allowing minus-strand synthesis to proceed unimpeded. however, each genus has probably evolved unique aspects dictated by its particular genomic context. production of a gag-pol fusion protein involves a local pseudoknot and a sequence surrounding the retrovirus stop codon (UAGGGGUGUGUGU) [58], [59], suggesting a different mode of action. the shorter-range interactions required for RT in alphaviruses form simple stem structures and involve a different stop codon and context. resemblance between structures and interactions of distal and proximal elements for RT and frameshifting is striking. the resemblance between the structures and interactions of the distal and proximal elements for RT and frameshifting is striking and suggests a common ancestry. DI-8 was made from DI-7 by replacing the internally-derived segment with nts 1067-1479 of the CIRV genome. the entire constructs were sequenced completely to confirm that the regions in the DI RNAs were correct. s were generated from DNA plasmids linearized with SmaI or PCR templates (small RNAs used for EMSA studies) using ampliCap T7-Flash transcription kits (Epicenter Technologies) 3105 cucumber protoplasts were transfected with RNA transcripts (3 g for genomic CIRV RNA; 5 g for non-replicating genomic RNA; 2 g of non-replicating genomic RNA; 2 g of non-replicating in vitro-generated transcripts analyzed were uncapped. in vitro translation products were then separated by SDS-10%PAGE. unlabelled RNAs were used and equimolar ratios of RIV and SL-PRTE RNAs were incubated. 30 L of 3.3X folding buffer, (333 mM NaCl, 16.5 mM MgCl2, 333 mM HEPES pH 8.0) was added, and samples were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. 45 L of refolded RNA was treated with 5 L of 50 mM 1-methyl-7-nitroisatoic anhydride (1M7) at 37\u00b0C for 4 min. for sequencing purposes, 20 L of refolded RNA was combined with primer (6 L containing 4 M WellRED D2 or 4 M IRDye 800), enzyme mix (6 L), ddGTP (1 L; 0.25 mM) or ddTTP (1 L; 10 mM), respectively, SuperScript III (1.5 L, 300 U) and primer extension was carried out. in vitro transcripts from the CIRV genomic construct containing the MluI site mediated efficient RT in vitro and replicated in protoplasts at levels comparable to the unmodified genome. PCR-derived regions containing the designed modifications that were introduced into constructs were sequenced completely to confirm that only the desired changes were present. construction of TCV mutants was performed using the genomic construct T1D1 [61] using standard PCR-based mutagenesis.
