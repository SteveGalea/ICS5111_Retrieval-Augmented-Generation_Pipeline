{"summary": "a novel coronavirus (CoV), the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, emerged in humans in the Arabian Peninsula in 2002/2003. this is highly pathogenic, as was the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV that has emerged in 2002/2003 in China, causing a worldwide outbreak with 774 deaths. in france, 34 bat species have been described and two species, Pipistrellus pipistrellus serotinus, are present in the whole territory. they have been considered as the natural hosts of many common animal and human viruses, such as measles or mumps. phylogeography has been defined as the field of study concerned with the principles and processes governing the geographical distribution of geographical lineages. study area and Sampling Samples were collected from seven distinct locations, each harboring a single bat species. roosts of bat colonies were mainly human dwellings, such as attics and barns. a total of 162 guano samples were collected from four bat species, Pipistrellus pipistrellus (118 specimens), Barbastella barbastellus (24 specimens), Myotis myotis (10 specimens) and Eptesicus serotinus (10 specimens) three days later fresh guano samples were collected and preserved in 250 L of RNAlater. RNA (5 L) was random primed reverse transcribed. nested PCR protocol, unmodified from Souza et al. [23], used 1 L of first round PCR product. gene sequences were initially aligned with homologous sequences of alpha-CoVs from humans, civet, camel, and bats. the aligned sequences were converted to distance matrix (% of differences) using PAUP 4.0b10 software. the appropriate model of sequence evolution was selected using PhyML with automatic model selection by Smart Model Selection (SMS) ale Bulgaria Reur2_BLG_2008 [17] FJ588686 Rhinolophus sinicus China Rsin_CHI_2006 [34] AY304488 Civet China Civ_CHI_2003 [35] KJ652334 Myotis daubentonii Hungary Mdau_HUN_2013 [19] KJ652333 Myotis nattereri Hungary Mnat_HUN_2013 [3] KJ652331 Myo HQ184058 Pipistrellus kuhlii Spain Pkuh_SP_2007 [16] HQ184057 Myotis myotis Spain Mmyo_SP_2007 [16] HQ184056 Myotis daubentonii Spain Mdau_SP_2007 [16] HQ184051 Nyctalus lasiopterus Spain Nlas_SP_2007 [16] GU190239 Nyctalus leisler phylogeographic analysis A minimum spanning network was constructed using the MINSPNET algorithm available in the ARLEQUIN 2.0 program. the genetic divergences between sample groups were estimated using a distance analysis (K2P, mega program) the colonies are numbered 1 to 7 and georeferenced as: 1 (02\u00b034\u203254\u2032\u2032 E; 47\u00b000\u203239\u2032\u2032 N), 2 (02\u00b031\u203202\u2032\u2032 E; 47\u00b004\u203259\u2032\u2032 N), 3 (02\u00b032\u203219\u2032\u2032 E; 46\u00b056\u203223\u2032\u2032 N), 4 (02\u00b033\u203238\u2032\u2032 E; 47\u00b002\u203239\u2032\u2032 N), 5 (02\u00b031\u203222\u2032\u2032 E; 47\u00b004\u203224\u2032\u2032 N), and 7 (02\u00b023\u203221 myotis myotis (10 specimens) and Eptesicus serotinus (10 specimens) were collected and preserved in 250 L of RNAlater (Applied Biosystems, Courtabuf, France) three days later fresh guano samples were collected and preserved in 250 L of RNAlater during shipment by mail. the nested PCR protocol, unmodified from Souza et al.
