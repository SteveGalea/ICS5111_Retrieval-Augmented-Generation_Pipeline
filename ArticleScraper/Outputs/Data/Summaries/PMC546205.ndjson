{"summary": "Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in 2003. it is a new epidemic form of life-threatening infection caused by a novel coronavirus. however, the immune-pathogenesis of SARS is poorly understood. hematological features of the disease are lymphopenia, transient thrombocytopenia, and normal neutrophil and monocyte counts. it has been shown that SARS coronavirus infects and replicates in a wide variety of host cells, including PBMCs, in susceptible animals and human beings. CD8+ cells have a direct effector role through cytotoxic T lymphocyte mediated lysis, and cytokine and chemokine production. the role of CD4+ T cells in antiviral immunity is highly dependent on production of cytokines, notably IFN- [15], and the cytolytic activity exerted by a subset of CD4+ T cells [16]. all four control arrays have Pearson correlation coefficients (r) of >0.95. this suggests an excellent reproducibility among individual arrays in the same experiment and between normal control experiments. genes coding for cytokines were completely absent in patients with SARS. genes coding for lactoferrin, S100A9 and Lipocalin 2 among others were highly up-regulated in PBMCs of patients with SARS.
