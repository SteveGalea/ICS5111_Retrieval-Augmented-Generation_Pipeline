{"summary": "coVs infect a wide range of mammalian and avian hosts, causing respiratory, enteric, hepatic, or neurological diseases of varying severity. the virus has the largest genomes among all RNA viruses, leading to an increased number of replication errors compared to the host genome. a virus would likely need to recognize receptor analogs in order to be transmitted between different host species. highly diverse MERS-related CoVs have been identified from a wide range of vespertilionid bats inhabiting africa, Asia, Europe, and North America (6\u201315) the spike proteins of these viruses do not use human or bat dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4 or bDPP4) which is the MERS-CoV receptor (9, 16, 17) lineage C BetaCoVs from vespertilionid bats are genetically similar to MERS-CoV and dependent on DPP4 for cell entry. we surveyed 1,059 bats belonging to 13 genera collected from Guangdong, Guangxi, and Sichuan provinces in china. we selected the two that were the most closely related to MERS-CoV for sequencing the entire full-length genome. the two were the most closely related to MERS-CoV for sequencing the entire full-length genome. myotis chinensis Large myotis 0/21 6, 9, 10 Myotis daubentonii daubenton's bat 0/57 4, 8, 9, 11 Myotis longipes Kashmir cave myotis 0/17 9, 11 Myotis ricketti Rickett's big-footed Myotis 0/47 6, 9 Myotis spp. 0/18 6, 9 Nyctalus plancyi phylogeny of lineage C betacoronaviruses and genomic organization of novel bat MERS-related coVs. the tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method. the tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method. the replicase ORF1ab is 21,300 nucleotides long and encodes a number of putative proteins, including Nsp3 (papain-like protease;

RNA was extracted from 200 l of sample using a high pure viral RNA kit. RNA was eluted in 50 l of RNase-free water provided by the viral RNA extraction kit. two pairs of previously described conserved nested primers were used for initial CoV screening. two novel MERS-related CoV strains, named BtCoV/Ii/GD/2013-845 and BtCoV/Ii/GD/2014-422, were selected for amplification of their genomes. the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the viral genomes were confirmed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using a 5\u2032/3\u2032 RACE kit (Clontech, Heidelberg, Germany) phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood method set as previously described (5). protein family analysis was performed using PFAM (28) and interProScan (29). the genome recombination bootscan plot was first scanned using the Recombination Detection Program (RDP; v4.94 Beta) and then generated using Simplot (v3.5.7) (25). GD/2014-422 (residues 357 to 592), and HKU5 (residues 375 to 586; GenBank accession no. ABN10875) were expressed in insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac expression system (Life Technologies Inc.), secreted into cell culture medium. purified sequentially on HiTrap protein G HP columns and Superdex 200 gel filtration columns (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) the mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 1 h and protected from light. the assay plates were read using an EnSpire plate reader (PerkinElmer) Tb1Lu cells expressing hDPP4, bDPP4, or no DPP4 were preincubated with goat anti-hDPP4 polyclonal antibody (R&D Systems) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and then infected by equal amounts of MERS-CoV or BtCoV/Ii/GD/2014-422 spike-pseudotyped retrovirus. the animal surveillance program was conducted from the summer of 2012 to the autumn of 2015 in three southern provinces. all specimens were collected using disposable swabs and protective gloves that were changed between samples for preventing cross contamination. the first round of screening PCR was performed with a superscript III one-step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq kit. the second round of screening PCR was performed with a Platinum Taq DNA polymerase kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) putative open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted using NCBI's ORF Finder. the nucleotide sequences and the deduced amino acid sequences of the ORFs were preliminarily compared to those of other CoV full-length genome sequences available from EMBOSS Needle. similarity plot (window size, 400 bp; step size, 40 bp) was generated with Simplot (v3.5.7) (25) the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) and the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (Ka) were obtained from the ATCC (www.atcc.org) these cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. pistrellus bat DPP4 (residues 36 to 760; GenBank accession no. KC249974), containing an N-terminal human CD5 signal peptide and an N-terminal His tag, were expressed and purified using the same procedure as that for CoV RBDs. the mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 1 h and protected from light. the membrane was washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST), incubated with anti-His6 mouse monoclonal IgG1 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. the bound proteins were detected using ECL plus (GE Healthcare) MERS-CoV or BtCoV/Ii/GD/2014-422 spike-pseudotyped retrovirus was preincubated with mouse serum or monoclonal antibody against MERS-CoV-spike. mixture was used to infect Tb1Lu cells expressing hDPP4, bDPP4 or no DPP4."}
