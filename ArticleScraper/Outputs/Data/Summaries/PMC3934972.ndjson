{"summary": "children aged 5 years in rural Bangladesh identified those with cough, difficulty breathing, age-specific tachypnea and/or danger signs in the community or admitted to the local hospital. a study physician collected clinical information and obtained nasopharyngeal swabs from all SARI cases. ARI and pneumonia accounted for hospitalization of 40% of 17,815 children aged 5 years in 1997\u20132001 at five primary level public health care facilities in rural Bangladesh. most of the known risk factors for pneumonia such as malnutrition, low birth weight, poor air quality, lack of exclusive breast feeding and crowding are prevalent in Bangladesh. study conducted in rural health and demographic surveillance site of icddr,b. it is unclear which viruses co-circulate during this time of high transmission. this information can help to determine the need for interventions. the icddr,b sub-centers served as the first level of referral. the icddr,b sub-centers served as the second level of referral. the icddr,b sub-centers served as the first level of referral. four children aged 5 years were cared for at home rather than being brought to a health care provider for pneumonia care. the study physician visited the patients within 48 hours or at the Matlab hospital within 24 hours of notification. the study physician collected nasopharyngeal swabs for viral testing from all the enrolled cases and 0.5\u20133 mls of blood samples. samples were placed in viral transport media, stored and transported at 2\u20138\u00b0C to the icddr,b virology laboratory on the same day of collection. we tested swabs for influenza A and B viruses, human metapneumoviruses, adenoviruses and human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) 1\u20133. the study team called the parents of all hospitalized cases 21 days after hospital discharge to determine the children\u2019s survival status. we then contacted all the hospitalized cases again at the end of November 2010 (30 days after last SARI case enrollment) to determine whether they had recovered completely from their SARI. review board reviewed and approved reliance on icddr,b IRB approval. study site was divided into two areas; an icddr,b service area in blocks A and an area with usual government health services. each block was comprised of 10\u201336 villages. the case definition for SARI was cough or difficulty breathing with age-specific tachypnea. we sought children with cough or difficulty breathing with age-specific tachypnea. children with cough or difficulty breathing with age-specific tachypnea. study physician collected 0.5\u20133 mls of blood samples from hospitalized cases within 24 hours of admission. swabs were placed in viral transport media, stored and transported at 2\u20138\u00b0C to the icddr,b virology laboratory on the same day of collection. agar plates were observed for the growth of Streptococcus species, Staphylococcus species, Hemophilus species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Acinetobacter species, Pseudomonas species and Candida species. acinetobacter species was identified using an analytical profile index (bioM\u00e9rieux, France) we report the annual incidence (person-years, py) of influenza-associated SARI from five months of data because we lacked a full year of data. we calculated incidences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incidences using Poisson distribution. the median age of the hospitalized cases was 9 months (interquartile range, IQR 3\u201315 months) and the median age of the non-hospitalized cases was 23 months (IQR 11\u201336 months). the median age of the non-hospitalized cases was 9 months (interquartile range, IQR 3\u201315 months). median number of household members per 100 sq ft was 2.2 in rural Bangladesh. at least one virus was detected in specimens from 34 of 65 (52%) hospitalized cases and 42 of 76 (55%) non-hospitalized cases. median age of hospitalized cases with RSV was lower than non-hospitalized cases. a pathogenic bacteria was isolated from blood cultures of 4 (6% CI 2%\u201315%]) of 64 hospitalized cases. a pathogenic bacteria was isolated from blood cultures of 4 (6% [95% CI 2%\u201315%]) of 64 hospitalized cases. cidences of severe acute respiratory virus infections among children aged 5 years in Matlab, Bangladesh, June\u2013October 2010. cidences of severe acute respiratory virus infections among children aged 5 years in Matlab, Bangladesh, June\u2013October 2010. one-fifth (15/76) of non-hospitalized SARI cases had not visited any health care provider when they were visited by the study physician at a median of 2 days after symptom onset (IQR 1\u20133 days) the remaining non-hospitalized cases had not visited any health care provider when they were visited. non-icddr,b qualified medical practitioner 0 (0) 1 (1) Unqualified provider 0 (0) 21 (28) Visited two health care providers 3 (5) 0 (0) Visited four health care providers 1 (2) 0 (0) *Community Health and Research Worker.
