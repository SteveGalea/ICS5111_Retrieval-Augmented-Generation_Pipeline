{"summary": "the current classification of animal viruses emphasizes the importance of virus genomic architecture and the host cell infection cycle. the current analysis explores how the virus molecular world and the macroscopic dimensions of the host environment are intertwined, integral to one and the same virus transmission ecology. infiltrative viruses establish in the inner-body environment and are expected to evolve towards a more intimate virus-host relationship. the virus organ system tropism is assumed to evolve in harmony with the virus cell tropism. the analysis focuses on the extent of virus host-body infiltration. the study describes the transmission ecology of the world main livestock viruses. the rationale for selecting the world main livestock viruses relates to the host damaging effects of these pathogens. the overt clinical signs and gross pathology translating in prominent virus shedding and obvious virus transmission modes. the length of the infection period appears to present a measure for the extent of virus host-body infiltration. the length of the infection period appears to present a measure for the extent of virus host-body infiltration. the 11 virus families in the study were grouped and ranked A\u2013D on the basis of the host-body infiltration scores allocated to the individual family viruses. for each grouping, the virus families and also the family viruses are shown in alphabetical order. one-to-four scores reflects, respectively, virus transmission strictly based on epithelial modes, primarily based on epithelial modes. TGEV, AEV, FMDV, and LSDV received a score of three for transmitting on the basis of the involvement of both epithelia and internal organs. both these viruses are persistently shed in feces, including in the absence of clinical signs, indicating a systemic infection component. the 36 viruses in the study lined up in ecological terms. the first panel concerns an outer- to inner-body alignment of organ systems and viruses. underscored are ruminant and equine viruses, so as to create a contrast with the remaining poultry and pig viruses, see text. the epithelial herpesviruses establishing latently in peripheral nerves and ganglia were found to cause a recurrence or persistence of the mucosal and/or skin infection. the epithelial herpesviruses establishing latently in peripheral nerves and ganglia were considered to feature a systemic component. the extent of virus inner-body infiltration correlated with a loss of virus robustness was applied in the virus ranking. the remaining 35 viruses formed part of either of the two host groupings. ruminant and equine viruses were matched. viruses gained prominence, with R = 0.40 and p 0.05, and infection severity level decreased, with R = 0.45 and p 0.01. ruminant and equine viruses were found to cause less severe infections than poultry and pig viruses, with Spearman R = 0.55 and p 0.01. the eleven virus families in the study were grouped and ranked A\u2013D. the length of the infection period scores yielded an R = 0.71 and p = 0. The result indicates that the interrelationships between virus families may be defined in ecological terms. for each grouping, the organ system tropisms of the viruses belonging to each family were collectively fitted and with the naked eye aligned with the Figure 1 A\u2013D line-up of viruses. for this, the within-group, alphabetical family order was adjusted to secure an optimal visual match. EV, AEV, FMDV, and LSDV received a score of three for transmitting on the basis of the involvement of both epithelia and internal organs. BHV-1, DEV, EHV-3, and GaHV1 were considered primarily epithelial while EHV-1, GaHV-2, and SHV-1 involved epithelia and internal organs. the 36 viruses in the study lined up in ecological terms. the first panel concerns an outer- to inner-body alignment of organ systems and viruses, plus also of virus genomes. underscored are ruminant and equine viruses, so as to create a contrast with the remaining poultry and pig viruses. inner-body Shifts Virus infiltration of the inner-body environment frequently implicated the genital tract or reproductive system in general. this was the case for the RNA, the DNA and for the retroviruses in the study. utmost deep-rooted viruses featured an absence of epithelial transmission modes and were environmentally labile. two-to-four Virus infiltration scores were matched to the one-to-three virus environmental survival rate scores, yielding an R = 0.59 and p = 0.0005. at least in broad terms the extent of virus inner-body infiltration correlated with a loss of virus robustness was applied in the virus ranking. utmost deep-rooted viruses were found to transmit on the basis of a fecal-oral cycle. the more infiltrative viruses affecting all layers of the skin caused slowly healing lesions. the transmission of these deep-rooted skin viruses was found to rely on abrasion or biting flies rather than on direct touch. the bluetongue virus, the sole arbovirus in the study, was considered somewhat atypical because the virus usually causes a transient infection in the ruminant host while in midges remains infective for life. the involvement of the biological vector complicates a direct comparison with the transmission ecology of the remaining 35 viruses. the extent of the host-body infiltration was found to increase from RNA to DNA to retrovirus, with R = 0.48 and p 0.005. from RNA to DNA to retrovirus the ruminant and equine viruses gained in prominence, with R = 0.40 and p 0.05. from outer- to inner-body, the virus genome type and host tropism appear to shift in concert. the pathogenicity level of the viruses evolves to match the dynamics in host abundance and contact rate. proliferative virus replication, generalized infection of respiratory plus enteric mucosae, profuse virus shedding, and swift onward transmission all go hand-in-hand. the rinderpest virus (RPV) in cattle and buffaloes primarily colonizes the alimentary tract and transmits on the basis of direct muzzle-to-muzzle contact. in small ruminants, the identical peste des petits ruminants virus affects also the respiratory tract and transmits also via aerosols. in sheep and goats, the virus (SGPV) causes transient lesions. an opportunistic, epithelial virus of wildlife origin is likely to be found circulating in livestock. this has been the case for influenza [23], Henipah [24] and MERS corona viruses [25] further, the SARS corona virus infected civet cats raised as food animals before appearing in humans as host. the pathogenicity level of the viruses evolves to match the dynamics in host abundance and contact rate. proliferative virus replication, generalized infection of respiratory plus enteric mucosae, profuse virus shedding, and swift onward transmission all go hand-in-hand. rinderpest virus (RPV) in cattle and buffaloes primarily colonizes the alimentary tract. the virus affects also the respiratory tract and transmits via aerosols. lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) in cattle causes persistent, deep, necrotic skin plugs and transmits via biting insects, mechanically. a subtotal of 23 livestock viruses of global animal health significance was extracted from the OIE-Listed diseases, infections and infestations in 2019 [30] the common livestock hosts comprise horses, donkeys, cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, swine, chicken, turkeys, ducks, and geese. the total of 36 livestock viruses belong to eleven different families. they form a mix of RNA (N = 19), DNA (N = 11) and retroviruses (N = 6). the total of 36 livestock viruses belong to eleven different families. one-to-three scores allocated to the 36 viruses for four ecological variables. variables comprise the extent of virus host-body infiltration, the length of the infection period, the infection severity level, and the virus environmental survival rate. also shown is a one-to-four virus infiltration score, an outcome of the iterative analysis process. for the virus host-body infiltration and for the length of the infection period were found to increase in value together. the eleven virus families in the study were grouped and ranked A\u2013D on the basis of the one-to-three infiltration scores allocated to the individual family viruses. for this, the organ system tropisms of the viruses belonging to each family were collectively fitted and with naked eye aligned with it. a re-examination of the relationship between virus host-body infiltration and virus environmental survival prompted a re-examination of the relationship between the extent of virus inner-body infiltration and virus environmental survival. RNA, DNA and retroviruses broadly line up in an outer- to inner-body fashion. ruminant plus equine viruses were contrasted to poultry plus pig viruses. the common livestock hosts, described in the colloquial OIE terminology, comprise horses, donkeys, cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, swine, chicken, turkeys, ducks, and geese. the selected viruses comprise, in alphabetical order: - infection with aujeszky disease; - avian infectious bronchitis; - avian infectious laryngotracheitis; - infection with bluetongue virus; - the total of 36 livestock viruses belong to eleven different families. equine herpesvirus-3; porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; swine vesicular disease virus. three viruses of international veterinary relevance were added. one-to-four virus infiltration score is an outcome of the iterative analysis process. the score for the length of the infection period reflects, respectively, acute, acute plus persistent, and persistent infections. the score for the infection severity level concerns a case fatality of less than one, one to ten, and above ten percent. system tropisms of the viruses belonging to each family were collectively fitted and with naked eye aligned with the A\u2013D family groups. for this, the alphabetical family order within the family groups was abandoned in order to obtain an optimal visual match. the result confirms that also the organ systems may be lined up in an outer- to inner-body fashion, virtually. ruminant plus equine viruses were contrasted to poultry plus pig viruses. RNA, DNA and retroviruses broadly line up in an outer- to inner-body fashion. additional correlations concerned virus host tropism and virus genome type."}
