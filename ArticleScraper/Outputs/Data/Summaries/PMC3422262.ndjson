{"summary": "children with defined clinical manifestations of ARIs were grouped into four clinical manifestations. human rhinovirus (HRV; 20.5%), metapneumovirus (HMPV, 13.8%), coronaviruses (HCoV, 12.5%), parainfluenza virus (HPIV, 11.8%) and respiratory syncytial virus A and B (RSV A/B, 11.8%) were the most detected. study describes for the first time the etiology of respiratory infections in febrile children under 5 years in a malaria rural area of Madagascar. it highlights the role of respiratory viruses in a well clinically defined population of ARIs. about 20% of child mortality (5 years) is due to pneumonia, bronchitis or bronchiolitis and 90% are attributed to pneumonia. malaria is endemic with stable transmission during all year on the east coast. recent studies on surveillance of fever among child result in malaria over-diagnosis with consequent under diagnosis of other fever-causing disorders such as pneumonia. a nasopharyngeal swab sample was performed on each child enrolled. the swab was placed in a universal transport medium (UTM, Copan) and stored at 4\u00b0C. a child with fever and at least one auscultator's signs including crackles, rhonchi and/or wheeze was considered in the group II (\u201cOther\u201d). ny nose or ear and/or nasopharyngitis related to group III (URTIs with cough) and to group IV (URTIs without cough) setting and study design This is a descriptive and prospective study performed on children under 5 years of age consulting at ampasimanjeva community hospital with clinical symptoms of ARIs. all PCR assays were performed with the AgPath-IDTM one-Step RT PCR kit (Ambion, cat#AM1005) for some analyses, the following pathogens were grouped: HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 in human coronaviruses (HCoV group); FLUAV, FLUBV, (FLUAV/H1N1/pd a nasopharyngeal swab sample was performed on each child enrolled. the swab was placed in a universal transport medium (UTM, Copan) the swab was stored at 4\u00b0C until sent to the centre d'infectiologie Charles M\u00e9rieux. setting and study design This is a descriptive and prospective study performed on children under 5 years of age consulting at ampasimanjeva community hospital with clinical symptoms of ARIs between February 2010 and February 2011. the proposed study covers both seasonal periods. PCR assays were performed with the AgPath-IDTM One-Step RT PCR kit (Ambion, cat#AM1005) for some analyses, the following pathogens were grouped: HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 in human coronaviruses (HCoV group); FLUAV, FLUBV, (FLUAV/H1N1/pdm 295 biological samples tested, 220 (75%) were positive for at least 1 respiratory pathogen. HCoV-OC43 and HPIV3 were the most detected. single detection was common in 160 specimens and caused by HRV. nasopharyngeal sample tested positive samples from children with ARIs. primary viral agent Associated respiratory pathogens n HBoV HRV 6 HCoV. 5 EV 4 HPIV 3 HAdV 3 HMPV 2 RSV A/B 1 Mpneu 1 Total 25 HCoV HPIV 9 HRV 6 HBoV 5 RSV A/B 4 EV 3 FLUV 2 Total 29 HRV EV 7 HBoV 6 HCoV 6 HPIV 5 RSV A/B 2 HMPV 2 HAdV 2 FLUV 2 Total 32 Total represents the number of co-detected pathogens from each primary viral agent all 295 acute respiratory infection episodes were classified in 4 clinical manifestation groups. the respiratory pathogens number upon the bar represents the percentage of the total pathogens identified in each clinical group. the dark grey bars correspond to the significant association (P = 0.05) between the pathogen and the clinical group.

HAdV infections were frequently associated with \u201cURTI without cough\u201d (8/45, P0.01). severe community acquired pneumonia represented 17% of the group I. 80% (n = 4/5) of Mycoplasma pneumoniae detected were associated with acute fever (P-value insignificant) the remaining respiratory pathogens were detected in patient with mild fever (Table 3). the remaining respiratory pathogens were detected in patient with mild fever (Table 3). the beginning of the cool and dry season represents the seasonality where we found the largest number of cases in each defined clinical group, except for the group III. HRV (data not shown) and HAdV circulated throughout the year without any epidemic peak. Figure 2. Seasonal distribution of acute respiratory infections in children, by type of the most frequently detected pathogens during one year. the human rhinovirus, HMPV A/B, HCoV, RSV A/B and HPIV were single detected while HCoV, HPIV and HBoV were most often co-detected. a comprehensive study on genotypes from HRV-positive samples would be interesting. we detected a low rate of M. pneumoniae (1.7%) and C. pneumoniae (0.7%) distributed in all four clinical groups. this could limit our interpretation to ascribe the etiological agents to the defined clinical groups. integrated management of childhood illnesses is presumptive and symptom-based. fever for malaria, fever/cough/difficult breathing for pneumonia. overlapping symptoms, compatible both with malaria and pneumonia, necessitating dual treatment, need to be evaluated in further studies."}
