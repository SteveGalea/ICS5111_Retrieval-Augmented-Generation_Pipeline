{"summary": "rabies is an ancient neurological disease caused mainly by the RABV. it is almost invariably fatal once clinical symptoms develop. rabies continues to pose a serious public health threat in most areas of the world. rabies-infected dogs are the major reason for the high incidence of human rabies. vaccination coverage of 70% of the canine population can efficiently reduce virus transmission and prevent human rabies. however, rabies still has a high death rate due to the cost and accessibility of proper PEP treatment. rabies is one of the oldest infectious diseases and has been known to mankind for more than 4000 years. but it was not until 1885 that Louis Pasteur developed the first RABV vaccine from the spinal cord of rabbits infected with rabies that was air-dried for inactivation. both Pasteur\u2019s vaccine and the Semple rabies vaccine are derived from nerve tissue. the first licensed human rabies vaccine developed from cell culture was the primary hamster kidney cell vaccine, which was created by cultivating viruses in primary hamster kidney cells. RABV is highly neurotropic, but can lose its tissue tropism and adapt to in vitro cultured cells, a feature that can be used to propagate RABV in many different cell types. live-attenuated viruses could be produced economically and trigger long-lasting immunity with a single dose. live-attenuated viruses could be produced economically and trigger long-lasting immunity with a single dose. rabies vaccines are designed to be prophylactic and administered primarily in a post-exposure manner. a list of viruses that have been engineered to express RABV glycoprotein (G) protein to act as vaccine candidates for protecting against lethal rabies. the virulent wild-type RABV can be attenuated through serial passages in cultured cells. infection with live-attenuated RABV initially stimulates expression of neuronal cytokines, such as CXCL10, which further attract infiltration of inflammatory cells into the CNS. this cascade eventually leads to down regulation of the expression of tight junction proteins of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) it has been demonstrated that enhancement of BBB permeability plays a crucial role in the immune clearance of RABV from the CNS. Strain Strategy Target HEP-Flury/SPBN Deletion of the P gene P RC-HL/SPBN Deletion of the M gene M SPBN Mutation of the PPEY motif M SPBN/Flury-LEP/HEP-Flury Overexpression of the G gene in the G and L gene interval. live-attenuated RABV vaccines are not only safe, even in immunocompromised mice, but also elicit high VNA titers and prompt early immune responses against RABV infection. a recombinant RABV expressing the granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene payload can prevent mice from developing rabies when administered intracerebrally, at a dose of 107.0 PFU, there is concern about the stability of live-attenuated RABV vaccines. there is a need for the development of appropriate stabilizers that can prevent the inactivation of these live-attenuated RABV vaccines. kennel cough vaccines containing live PIV5 have been used in dogs for over 40 years without significant safety concerns for animals or humans. rPIV5-RV-G showed a dose-dependent protection manner and a single dose of 106.0 PFU of rPIV5-RV-G was sufficient for 100% protection. rPIV5-RV-G showed a robust immune response that protects against a lethal RABV challenge. rPIV5-RV-G protected mice as late as six days after RABV challenge. 50% protection when inoculated with a single dose of 108.0 PFU of rPIV5-RV-G via the intramuscular route. results demonstrate that PIV5-G is a promising vaccine candidate for prevention and control of rabies. rL-RVG induced strong and long-lasting protective immune responses against rabies in dogs and cats. an NDV-vectored vaccine can be used to induce long-lasting systemic protective immunity against rabies in animals and humans in high-risk areas to control rabies infections. vaccinia virus is a large, complex, enveloped double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the Orthopoxvirus genus in the Poxviridae family. vaccinia virus replicates uniquely and exclusively in the cytoplasm of the infected cells. the most famous application of vaccinia virus is the successful use of vaccinia virus to eradicate smallpox. a recombinant MVA expressing the RABV G gene was shown to be less immunogenic than V-RG. other poxviral vectors, such as canarypox virus, raccoon poxvirus, capripoxvirus, and fowlpox virus, have also been used to generate recombinant live vaccines against rabies. human adenoviruses are by far the best characterized. most applications of adenoviruses have been carried out with vectors based on the replication-defective human serotype 5 (HAdV-5), with the essential E1 or E3 gene deleted. an E1-deleted HAdV-5 expressing the RABV G protein was constructed and tested in mice. avian adenovirus Celo virus [75] has also been investigated for use as rabies vaccines. recombinant adenovirus-based vectors warrant further consideration for human rabies control and particularly for the oral vaccination of wildlife animals. rPRV/eGFP/rgp was safe in dogs by oral and intramuscular routes of inoculation and induced protective immune responses against pseudorabies and rabies in dogs. PRV may serve as an alternative live vector for the development of an oral rabies vaccine for dogs. baculoviruses are probably the most beneficial viruses to humans. VG developed high levels of VNAs and were completely protected against lethal RABV challenge. baculovirus can be used as an alternative strategy to develop a safe and efficacious vaccine against rabies. virulent wild-type RABV can be attenuated through serial passages in cultured cells. a live replication-deficient RABV-based vaccine can induce both CD4+ T cell-dependent and independent B cell activation through the direct infection and stimulation of B cells. this could account for the rapid and potent induction of early protective immune responses by live RABV-based vaccines. several strategies have been employed to address the safety issues associated with a live RABV-based vaccine. gene in the G and L gene interval IFN- SPBN Insertion of a cytochrome c gene in the G and L gene interval cytochrome c HEP-Flury Insertion of a GM-CSF gene in the G and L gene interval Flagellin ERA Insertion of a GM-CSF gene in the G and L gene interval GM-CSF LBNSE Insertion of a GM-CSF gene in the G and a specific RABV strain correlates directly with the phylogenetic relationship of the vaccine strain with the street isolates circulating in a region. live-attenuated RABV vaccines are superior in efficacy and cost-effective for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis of rabies. there is concern about the stability of live-attenuated RABV vaccines. RABV is an arthropod-borne virus that causes fatal disease in humans and animals. most infections of wild-type VSV are non-lethal and only manifest mild symptoms. pre-existing immunity to VSV in humans is generally very low. rPIV5-RV-G showed a dose-dependent protection manner and a single dose of 106.0 PFU of rPIV5-RV-G was sufficient for 100% protection. rPIV5-RV-G protected mice as late as six days after RABV challenge. rPIV5-RV-G protected mice as late as six days after RABV challenge. recombinant NDV was constructed to evaluate its ability to serve as a vaccine against rabies. it was shown that rL-RVG grow to high titers in cultured cells. rL-RVG induced strong and long-lasting protective immune responses against rabies in dogs and cats. ORFV has emerged as a novel virus vector system for expressing different foreign antigens and as vaccine candidates for other pathogenic viruses. one single intramuscular inoculation of 107.0 PFU of D1701-V-RabG completely protected mice against an intracranial challenge with high lethal doses of the virulent RABV strain CVS-11. the first recombinant poxvirus licensed and used as a vaccine is the recombinant vaccinia virus Copenhagen strain. a recombinant RABV G gene was inserted into the poxvirus thymidine kinase gene (V-RG) it has been suggested that oral rabies vaccination may be the only effective strategy for rabies elimination programs. ant MVA required to elicit equivalent VNA response in dogs and raccoons. other poxviral vectors, such as canarypox virus, capripoxvirus, and fowlpox virus, have also been used to generate recombinant live vaccines against rabies. adenoviruses are a family of non-enveloped DNA viruses with an icosahedral nucleocapsid that are p induced high titers of VNA against rabies in dogs previously immunized with the conventional rabies vaccine. it was demonstrated that AdRG1.3 induced high levels of VNAs for protection against rabies. recombinant adenovirus-based vectors warrant further consideration for human rabies control and particularly for the oral vaccination of wildlife animals. PRV is the main cause of Aujeszky\u2032s disease in swine. it is endemic in most parts of the world. a recombinant PRV was constructed and analyzed for its efficacy. baculovirus\u2013insect expression system is one of the most popular and robust eukaryotic expression systems for heterologous gene expression in insect cells. a recombinant AcMNPV, expressing the RABV G gene, was constructed under the control of the AcMNPV polyhedrin and the immediate early CMV promoters. a baculovirus-expressed rabies G protein in insect cells was found to be antigenically conserved and immunogenic in mice. a baculovirus-expressed G protein in insect cells was found to be antigenically conserved and immunogenic in mice. edible vaccines are attractive and appealing options, but many limitations were obvious. a number of antigenic epitopes have been identified in RABV G protein. a peptide expressing a linear epitope of the G protein (named G5) induces a strong humoral immune response in the absence of a carrier protein in immunized goats. the antibody produced weakly neutralized RABV carrying the G5 epitope. the recombinant virus induced an immune response in mice. three of nine individuals showed detectable levels of RABV-neutralizing antibodies. but the high variability of the G protein would compromise these peptide vaccines that induce antibodies to specific epitopes. a plasmid pSG5rab.gp expresses the RABV G protein, under the control of the SV40 early promoter vector, was tested in mice for induction of rabies-specific immune responses. a pClneo plasmid encoding the RABV G protein under the control of the CMV promoter was constructed and tested in dogs [99]. recombinant rabies DNA vaccine induced apoptosis in transfected cells. recombinant replicon expressed rabies G protein efficiently and induced apoptosis in transfected cells. both replicon-based rabies DNA vaccines and commercial cell culture vaccines conferred complete protection against a lethal RABV challenge. the integration of plasmid DNA into a host chromosome could result in the potential risk of long-term or even uncontrolled expression of the transgene. however, the integration of DNA into the host genome may also modify the genetic information of the host and thus be tumorigenic. mRNA-based rabies vaccine elicited VNA levels comparable to those induced by full doses of commercial inactivated rabies vaccine. a recombinant SFV-RVGP induced high expression levels of functionally trimeric RABV G protein. a recombinant SFV-RVGP elicited comparable levels of antibodies to that of a commercial rabies vaccine, and was more effective than the protein vaccines in in RNA vaccines are directly translated into and transcribed within the nucleus to express the antigen, which is not only time-consuming but may be inefficient in some types of cells. RNA is a potent stimulator of innate immunity through signaling via pattern recognition receptors, such as the Toll-like receptors or the retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors. this adjuvant effect of RNA stimulates the host immune response. a liposome was used to deliver siRNA-encoding plasmid and significantly increased survival of RABV-infected mice compared to a non-liposome-mediated delivery method. a chimeric peptide, containing nonamer arginine residues added to the carboxy terminus of the 29-amino-acid peptide, enables the transvascular delivery of siRNA across the BBB to the brain. chimeric peptide\u2013siRNA complex did not induce inflammatory cytokines or anti-peptide antibodies. results showed that siRNAs-based approaches have the potential to be developed into new and effective anti-rabies therapy. a live-attenuated virus could transiently enhance the BBB permeability, although this raises safety concerns. in rats, the breakdown of BBB permeability using hypertonic arabinose prolonged the survival rate of infected rats. mAb 8-10E treatment alone partially increased the survival rate of infected rats. but precautions should be taken to preserve homeostasis and avoid new neuronal damage of the CNS. endogenous BBB receptors involved in normal receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) pathways that function to transport macromolecules such as insulin and transferrin into the brain are ideal targets. rabies VNAs can be delivered to the CNS without altering the normal function of the BBB. a case in point are rabies VNAs, which can be delivered without interfering with the normal function of the BBB. rabies G protein protected guinea pigs from a lethal RABV challenge when administered intramuscularly, but failed to protect mice via a lethal intracerebral challenge. a baculovirus-expressed G protein in insect cells was found to be antigenically conserved and immunogenic in mice [86], and provided protection against a lethal challenge with a street RABV. a peptide expressing a linear epitope of the G protein (named G5) induces a strong humoral immune response in the absence of a carrier protein in immunized goats. however, the antibody produced weakly neutralized RABV carrying the G5 epitope and failed to neutralize escape mutants carrying a single point mutation in this epitope. a case in point are peptides that mimic the RABV P protein. these peptides inhibit RABV but not VSV infection of BHK-21-T7 cells. these results implied that peptides that interfere with certain steps in viral replication hold promise as a therapeutic approach. mice intramuscularly immunized with the pSG5rab.gp vector developed RABV G-specific cytolytic T cells, lymphokine-secreting T helper cells of the Th1 subset, and rabies VNAs. a pClneo plasmid encoding the RABV G protein under the control of the CMV promoter (pGPV) was constructed and tested in dogs. s and commercial cell culture vaccines confer complete protection against a lethal RABV challenge. the slow onset and modest induction of protective immune responses upon DNA vaccination precludes their use for post-exposure immunization against rabies. improvements have been made to increase the safety and efficacy of DNA vaccines. the integration of DNA into the host genome may also modify the genetic information of the host and thus be tumorigenic. many studies have investigated the potential of vaccines based on RNA molecules for rabies treatment. conventional non-amplifying mRNA vaccines and self-amplifying mRNA vaccines have been developed. GP induced high expression levels of functionally trimeric RABV G protein. SFV-RVGP elicited comparable levels of antibodies to that of a commercial rabies vaccine. but much effort has been put into enhancing the delivery efficiency and potency of an RNA vaccine. small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based therapy siRNA is a class of double-stranded RNA molecules 21\u201323 bp in length. it functions within the RNAi pathway to interfere with the expression of specific genes with complementary nucleotide sequences by degrading mRNA after transcription. this leads to the disruption of protein translation and post-transcriptional gene silence. a liposome was used to deliver siRNA-encoding plasmid and significantly increased survival of RABV-infected mice compared to a non-liposome-mediated delivery method. a chimeric peptide containing nonamer arginine residues added to the carboxy terminus of the 29-amino-acid peptide enables the transvascular delivery of siRNA across the BBB to the brain. a recombinant monoclonal antibody targeting a specific epitope of the G protein is highly effective in neutralizing RABV in vitro or before the virus enters the CNS. it delivers passive immunity which is particularly important at early stages, before the host develops active immunity to the vaccine. however, once the virus accesses the CNS, these antibodies are restricted to crossing the immune-privileged BBB to neutralize virus infection. bi-specific antibody therapy BsAb is composed of two binding specificities for two different antigens, or two different epitopes of an antigen, in one antibody molecule. the purpose of BsAb is to recognize and target two different antigens simultaneously, thus realizing the desired therapeutic effects that cannot be achieved by a combination of two monospecific antibodies. rabies VNAs can be delivered to the CNS without interfering with the normal functionality of the BBB. targeting these receptors can act as a molecular Trojan horse to ferry biologics fused to the antibody into the brain via RMT. a BsAb for rabies treatment could be constructed with one arm targeting one of the endogenous BBB receptors while the other targets the RABV G protein. rabies is endemic to many parts of the developing world where resources of appropriate PEP are limited, the infrastructure and facility are inadequate. the most important and probably the only practical way to control rabies globally is the mass vaccination of dogs as well as wildlife reservoirs. there has been a consistent lack of interest in developing antiviral therapy for patients who have missed the deadline for valid vaccination. rabies vaccines based on live-attenuated RABV or HAdV-5 caused no adverse events or safety concerns. rabies vaccines based on live-attenuated RABV or HAdV-5 caused no adverse events or safety concerns. research on siRNAs targeting RABV essential genes has gained a lot of potential in terms of delaying the process of RABV infection and allowing PEP to take effect. a lot of interest has been focused on the development of monoclonal antibodies as potential alternatives for the limited and expansive RIG. recombinant viruses coding for the G protein of several lyssaviruses, RABV coding for additional Gs from different lyssaviruses, or chimeric G combined from different lyssaviruses, are thus expected to provide protection against other members of the lyssavirus genus. however, as RABV infection causes severe neuronal dysfunction and injury, it is equally important to ameliorate the neuronal damage induced by"}
