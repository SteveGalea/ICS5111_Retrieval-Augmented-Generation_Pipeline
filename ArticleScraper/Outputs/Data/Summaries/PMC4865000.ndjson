{"summary": "HBoV1 has been associated with respiratory infections, including acute otitis media (AOM) but the knowledge on the significance of HBoV1 in relation to other respiratory viruses is limited. the aim of this study was to compare the rate of detection of HBoV1 to that of other respiratory viruses. acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common infections in children. some respiratory viruses, eg, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and rhinovirus have commonly been associated with AOM. constitutionally healthy children were enrolled at the ages of 6\u201335 months. children were followed for 1 year for occurrences of URI and AOM. acute otitis media was considered to have complicated URI. enza viruses 1\u20133, and influenza viruses A and B were not targeted in the assay performed and reported in the original study. 707 frozen archived NPS specimens were available for testing by quantitative PCR (qPCR) for hMPV, HBoV, and RSV; these represent 81% of the URI samples collected for viral studies. a parallel qPCR reaction for GAPDH [17] was completed on every clinical sample. viral load analysis was available in NPSs from 649 URI episodes. new detection of RSV was made by qPCR in 71 URI episodes. study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of University of Texas Medical Branch, and informed consent was obtained from the guardians of all study children. acute otitis media was considered to have complicated URI if it occurred within 28 days of URI onset. the HBoV1 and human metapneumovirus were not targeted in the assay performed and reported in the original study. 707 frozen archived NPS specimens were available for testing by quantitative PCR (qPCR) for hMPV, HBoV, and RSV; these represent 81% of the URI samples collected for viral studies. quantitative PCR was completed in a thermocycler equipped with a CFX reaction module. fluorescent signal data were collected at the end of each annealing and extension step. hGAPDH at less than 500 copies/reaction from the NPS sample suggested inadequacy of the specimen. HBoV1 was detected more than once in 42 (45%) children during the year. of 94 children with HBoV1 infection, HBoV1 was detected more than once in 42 (45%) children. median age at enrollment (mo) 12 (range, 6\u201334) 12 (range, 6\u201335) Number of URI episodes/child year (median)b 2.1 0.4 URI episodes with 2 viruses/all URI episodesb 197 of 448 44 42 of 259 16 Race Asian 3 3 3 3 Black 28 30 29 27 Biracial 8 9 11 10 White 55 59 64 60 Ethnicity: Hispanic/Latino 37 39 52 49 Childcare arrangement Home 60 64 72 37% of all URI episodes, 39% of virus-positive URI episodes (single or multiple viruses) and 45% of HBoV1-positive episodes (single or multiple viruses) were complicated by AOM. in 44 URI episodes (35 children), 15 episodes were associated with previous shedding of HBoV1 10\u201389 days previously. previous data were not available in 14 episodes (first URI episode in the study) the rate of AOM after URI was 52% (15 of 29) in cases without documented previous HBoV1 detection and 40% (6 of 13) in cases in which available data excluded HBoV1 persistence. HBoV1-DNA can be detected in asymptomatic children [15] due to prolonged presence of the viral nucleic acids. detection of HBoV1-DNA alone in the NPS might not be sufficient to document active HBoV1 infection. the higher incidence of HBoV detection in longitudinal studies is likely from prolonged presence of the virus in the respiratory tract. the same reason may also explain high frequencies of concurrent detection of HBoV with other viruses."}
