{"summary": "plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a large multimeric glycoprotein that interacts with platelet surface receptors. the adhesive activity of VWF is positively correlated with the size of the multimers in plasma [1], [2]. the importance of VWF proteolysis by ADAMTS13 is demonstrated in two syndromes, i.e., thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and von Willebrand disease type 2A. mAb SZ34 significantly decreased the susceptibility of VWF to proteolysis by ADAMTS13 under shear stress, but not under static/denaturing conditions. the epitope of SZ34 was mapped to the amino acid residues between A1555 and G1595 in the central A2 domain of VWF. Purified pVWF (150 nM) was pre-incubated with SZ34 (0\u2013200 g/ml) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. after 5 min of vortexing at 2,500 rpm on a mini vortexer, the 350 kDa cleavage products were visualized by 5% SDS-PAGE. the decreased amount of the high and intermediate molecular weight multimers were dramatically reduced by mAb SZ34 in a concentration-dependent manner under shear stress. pVWF was pre-incubated with SZ34 (0\u2013200 g/ml) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, and then incubated with 50 nM rADAMTS13. purified pVWF (150 nM) pretreated with guanidine-HCl was incubated with SZ34 (0\u2013200 g/ml), then incubated with 25 nM rADAMTS13. after 1.5 h, the reaction was quenched by adding 20 mM EDTA. the 350 kDa cleavage products were analyzed by western blot. recombinant VWF-R1597W (150 nM) was incubated with 0 or 100 g/ml SZ34 at 37\u00b0C for 30 min and then for 18 h with 25 nM rADAMTS13 at 37\u00b0C. the binding epitope of SZ34 was much weaker than the native counterparts (Table 2). ADAMTS-13 cleaves the Y1605-M1606 peptidyl bond in the A2 domain (D1459-L1668). five different recombinant VWF domains with His-tags and 5 different recombinant proteins derived from the VWF A2 domain flanked with GST- and His-tags. a western blot in combination with ELISA based on polystyrene microspheres was performed to testify that SZ34 is a conformational mAb against VWF. compared with native pVWF, binding activity of SZ34 to native and denatured pVWF was significantly reduced. anti-VWF mAb SZ34 decreases the susceptibility of VWF to proteolysis by ADAMTS13 under shear stress. the 350 kDa cleavage product of VWF under shear stress was reduced in the presence of SZ34 in a concentration-dependent manner. the 350 kDa cleavage products were visualized by 5% SDS-PAGE. 1C1E7 (an anti-VWF D'D3 mAb), SZ129 (an anti-VWF A1 mAb) and SZ123 (an anti-VWF A3 mAb) were used as negative controls. purified pVWF (150 nM) was pre-incubated with SZ34 (0\u2013200 g/ml) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. then incubated with 50 nM rADAMTS13. after 5 min of vortexing at 2,500 rpm on a mini vortexer, VWF multimers were separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and immunologic analysis. the 350 kDa cleavage products were ted with 25 nM rADAMTS13. the reaction was quenched by adding 20 mM EDTA. changes in the cleavage product detected relative to that observed in the absence of SZ34 were determined by densitometry. agarose gel electrophoresis and immunologic analysis separated the binding epitope of anti-VWF mAb SZ34. we prepared a series of recombinant VWF fragments, including A1A2A3, A1, A2, A3 and D'D3. ADAMTS-13 cleaves the Y1605-M1606 peptidyl bond in the A2 domain (D1459-L1668). five different recombinant VWF domains flanked with GST- and His-tags. a western blot in combination with ELISA based on polystyrene microspheres was performed to testify that SZ34 is a conformational mAb against VWF. compared with native pVWF, binding activity of SZ34 to native and denatured pVWF was significantly reduced. mAb VP-1 inhibited native pVWF or wild-type recombinant VWF proteolysis by ADAMTS13. other mAbs against VWF exhibited no effects on ADAMTS13-mediated proteolysis. only two reports have been published showing the inhibitory effects of VWF antibodies on proteolysis. the mAb, SZ34, bound to native VWF better than pre-denatured VWF at the central A2 domain, and decreased the cleavage of native VWF under shear stress. the ADAMTS13 cleavage site (the Y1605-M1606 bond) in the VWF A2 domain is buried within the native, folded structure of VWF multimers. the epitope of SZ34, a mAb raised against native VWF multimers, is located within the A1555-G1595 region. it is possible that part or all of the 2-helix and 3-helix structure of A2 domain is constitutively exposed on the native VWF multimers. this monoclonal anti-VWF antibody may be useful tool for further investigating biological function of VWF in vivo. heparin-Sepharose 6FF (Pharmacia) affinity chromatography was performed. ADAMTS13 containing human full-length cDNA sequence was expressed in a stably transfected HeLa cell line. antibodies to VWF Eight murine mAbs against human VWF were used.

SZ129 and SZ130 recognize VWF A1 domain [26], whereas SZ123 and SZ125 interact with VWF A3 domain [27]. purified VWF (1.5 M) was pre-denatured with 1.5 M guanidine-HCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. after a 110 dilution with 20 mM Tris-HCl, the denatured VWF was incubated with anti-VWF mAbs at 37\u00b0C for 30 min and then treated with 25 nM rADAMTS13 that had been recombinant VWF-R1597W (150 nM) was incubated with 0 or 100 g/ml SZ34 at 37\u00b0C for 30 min and then for 18 h with 25 nM rADAMTS13 at 37\u00b0C. cleavage reactions measured by the distribution of proteolytic fragments (350 kDa) on a 5% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing condition. recombinant VWF D'D3, A1A2A3, A1, A2 and A3 all contained a 6His tag.
