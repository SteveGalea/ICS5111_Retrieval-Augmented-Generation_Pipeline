{"summary": "porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of the genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae (1). the virus contains at least 7 open reading frames (ORF) including ORF1a/1b, spike (S), ORF3, envelop (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) in a 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 order (2,3). demic G2a is distantly related to the classical PED vaccine strain (20) NB1 field strain was from a pig farm. age groups ranged from suckling to sow pigs. the thermal profile used in PCR reactions consisted of an initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 56\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. specific primers and PCR conditions reported previously were used for the detection of common pig diarrhea viruses including PDCoV (21), kobuvirus (22), and rotavirus (23). complete genome sequence of NB1 was registered under the GenBank accession number MF281416. the complete genome sequence of NB1 was registered under the GenBank accession number MF281416. total RNA was extracted using TRIzol LS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) the RNA was then converted into cDNA with the use of random hexamers and the RNA to cDNA EcoDry premix kit (Clontech, Otsu, Japan) for PEDV detection, the PEDV-specific primers PEDV-460F [5\u2032-AATGGCAACAACAGGTCC-3\u2032] and PEDV-947R [5\u2032- the lowest viral concentrations detected by RT-PCR were 101.0TCID50/mL for PEDV. non-specific reactions were not observed when other viruses, bacteria, and cells were used to access the specificity of RT-PCR. the antigenic index calculated for each amino acid site was plotted using computer software (Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Office 2016 version; Microsoft, Redmond, Washington, USA) the overall detection rate of PEDV was 6.70% (43 positive samples/642 tested samples) besides PEDV, 4 common enteric viruses of swine were found. the suckling group in this farm exhibits profuse diarrhea with mortality rates being approximately 100%. the complete genome sequence of NB1 (MF281416) is 28 005 nucleotides long. the genomic arrangement and nucleotide positions are as follows. the deduced amino acid sequence of NB1 differed from the 18 Korean PEDVs mostly in polyprotein (encoded by ORF1a, ORF1b), S protein, and N protein (Figure 3). NB1 had 81 unique amino acids distributed in order: ORF1a, 39; ORF1b, 13; S, 17; ORF3, 1; M, 0; and N, 9. amino acid substitution Y681Q was also found to alter antigenic indexes of 4 adjacent sites (inserted panel B) NB1 epitopes COE (aa 501\u2013640) and S1D (aa 638\u2013791) are indicated with empty arrows, while those with physical property changes are indicated with filled arrows. ine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), rotaviruses (RV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) and porcine kobuvirus (KV) samples were sorted into 7 groups including newborn ( 7 d), suckling (30 to 60 d), grower (60 to 90 d), finisher (90 d), gilt, and sow. the deduced amino acid sequence of NB1 differed from the 18 Korean PEDVs mostly in polyprotein (encoded by ORF1a, ORF1b), S protein, and N protein (Figure 3). NB1 had 81 unique amino acids distributed in order: ORF1a, 39; ORF1b, 13; S, 17; ORF3, 1; M, 0; and N, 9. 2 regions in the COE and S1D of NB1 had negative or lower antigenic index in comparison with the other PEDV. the amino acid substitution V635E significantly altered antigenic indexes of 4 adjacent sites. the 6.70% PEDV-positive pigs might include vaccinated pigs. but based on the following reasons, the percentage of PED vaccinated pigs could be neglected. since 2013, a mixture of classical genogroups (G1 and G2b) and pandemic G2a was detected. since 2013, a new pattern of PEDV emerged in Korea. mutant virus could escape neutralizing activities by single amino acid substitution in S1B (V638G, according to the position of GDU strain, KU985230) mutant mutant was not observed in NB1 strain."}
