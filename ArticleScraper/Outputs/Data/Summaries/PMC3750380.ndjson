{"summary": "bowel/colorectal cancer awareness measure questionnaire was used to assess level of colorectal cancer awareness among study population. bowel/colorectal cancer awareness measure questionnaire was used to assess socio-demographic variance of knowledge score on warning signs and risk factors. dietary fibre, high saturated fat intake, red meat consumption, excess alcohol, lack of physical activity and diabetes mellitus. the 5-year survival rate of CRC can be as high as 90% if the disease is detected early. it is therefore important to screen for those at risk of colorectal cancer. a rural-based cross sectional survey was carried out in perak state in Peninsular Malaysia in March 2011. the sample size was determined by using the OpenEpi programme. the survey recruited a population-representative sample using multistage sampling. there are 25 specific questions on bowel cancer awareness in original Bowel/Colorectal CAM. only one question concerning NHS bowel cancer screening programme was excluded. face validity was done with 30 participants before conducting survey. the \u201copen-ended\u201d question is designed to measure how many colorectal cancer risk factors a respondent can recall unaided. the knowledge scale of risk factors is phrased as: 'How much do you agree that each of these can increase the chance of developing bowel cancer' all interviewers were third year university students and fluent in both English and Malay. participation in the study was voluntary and the written informed consent for participation was obtained from participants. the survey recruited a population-representative sample using multistage sampling. the five districts of the perak state were selected. households were selected from villages with proportionate random sampling. the \u201copen-ended\u201d question is designed to measure how many colorectal cancer warning signs a respondent can recall unaided. the knowledge scale of warning signs is phrased as; \u201cThe following may or may not be warning signs for bowel cancer. we are interested in your opinion\u201d. self-rated confidence level of noticing bowel cancer (4 Likert score: \u201cnot at all confident: 1\u201d to \u201cvery confident: 4\u201d), health seeking behaviour and opinion on age related bowel cancer incidence. socio-demographic characteristics included age, gender, ethnicity, marital status (single, married, divorce and widow), education level (primary/secondary and post-secondary) the \u201copen-ended\u201d question is designed to measure how many colorectal cancer warning signs a respondent can recall unaided. the knowledge scale of warning signs is phrased as; \u201cThe following may or may not be warning signs for bowel cancer. we are interested in your opinion\u201d. self-rated confidence level of noticing bowel cancer (4 Likert score: \u201cnot at all confident: 1\u201d to \u201cvery confident: 4\u201d), health seeking behaviour and opinion on age related bowel cancer incidence. socio-demographic characteristics included age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, education level (primary/secondary and post-secondary) and monthly income. colorectal cancer awareness was only assessed in respondents aged 18 and above at the day of interview. out of the 3494 respondents, 2379 adults who fulfilled the age criteria were recruited in the study. the prompted awareness for all warning signs and symptoms was higher than unprompted. Approximately 77% percent of respondents could not recall any risk factors without aided. bowel cancer 3% 31.2% Older age 2.9% 33.6% Being overweight or obese 2.8% 32.5% Having other bowel disease 1.8% 41.2% Having diabetes 1.1% 21.8% Knowledge of age related incidence of colorectal cancer. 20% of Indian and others had anticipated delay for help seeking. Factors associated knowledge score on warning signs and risk factors were identified by ANOVA and presented in (Table 4). in the age group of 60 and above, there was a lowest knowledge score for both warning signs and risk factors. compared to single and married, divorce/separated and widowed, there was significantly lower knowledge score for both warning signs and risk factors. Having cancer in self/spouse/close family had significantly higher knowledge of warning sign but not for risk factors of CRC. Having cancer in other family member and friends had significant association for having better knowledge score compared to low income group. 5% of respondents could recall, followed by \u201cbleeding from back passage\u201d and \u201cblood in stool\u201d. 4% of respondent managed to recall \u201cchange in bowel habit\u201d and \u201ctiredness/anaemia\u201d. the awareness of risk factors measured by unprompted and prompted questions is summarized and presented in (Table 3). only 17% of the participants could give the right answer that a 60 year old is likely to develop colorectal cancer. 87.6% would seek help within one week if presented with warning signs of bowel cancer. the mean duration for seeking help was 1.51 (1.69) weeks. ethnic difference in anticipated delay in help seeking was found. female (n = 1349) 2.94 (2.78 \u2013 3.11) P > 0.05 3.46 (3.29 \u2013 3.63) P > 0.05 Ethnicity Malay (n = 1863) 3.09 (2.96- 3.23) F (21.77) 3.70 (3.55 \u2013 3.84) F (19.70) Chinese (n = 332) 2.32 (2.02 \u2013 2.62) P 0.001 2.62 (2.31 \u2013 2.94) P 0.001 Indian/O 0.001 4.24 (3.99 \u2013 4.49) P 0.001 In the age group of 60 and above, there was a lowest knowledge score for both warning sign and risk factors. compared to malay, Chinese and Indian participants had significantly lower knowledge score for both warning signs and risk factors. compared to single and married, divorce/separated and widowed had significantly lower knowledge score for both warning signs and risk factors. 63 (4.32 \u2013 4.94) F (54.96) No (n = 355) 2.69 (2.56 \u2013 2.81) 0.001 3.29 (3.15 \u2013 3.43) 0.001 Discussion Understanding public awareness regarding CRC may provide valuable information to incorporate the policy decision for prevention, early diagnosis and improvement of survival for CRC. the mean duration for seeking medical attention was 1.51 (1.69) weeks. this is within the acceptable range as seeking treatment more than two weeks after notice of warning sign was considered as delay. the rural population in Malaysia had minimal awareness about poor lifestyle behaviour as risk factors for CRC. bowel cancer was highest among the Chinese where the incidence rates were 23.8 per 100000 populations. lower in Indians and malays where the incidence rate was 9.1 per 100000 and 6.9 per 100000 respectively. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors contribute in data collection, analysis and write-up of manuscript. all authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
