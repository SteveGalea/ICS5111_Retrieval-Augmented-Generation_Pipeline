{"summary": "there is little information about the spatial-temporal dynamics of pandemic influenza in south America. quantitative description of age-specific morbidity pandemic patterns across administrative areas of Peru. results The national pandemic curve revealed a bimodal winter pandemic wave, with the first peak limited to school age children in the Lima metropolitan area. historical influenza pandemics have been characterized by a disproportionate impact on morbidity and mortality rates among young individuals, a feature that is in stark contrast with seasonal influenza epidemics. out-of-season influenza activity has been documented in spring and summer months in temperate countries during the 1918 influenza pandemic [3], [4], [5] and the recent 2009 influenza pandemic [6], [7]. the country is divided by the Andes Mountains in naturally distinct regions (highlands, coastal desert and jungle) all regions span the entire length of the country from latitude 3\u00b0S to latitude 18\u00b0S, and experience different influenza seasonal patterns in inter-pandemic years. we obtained patient age (years), date of symptoms onset, and reporting department (n = 24) and province (n = 134) for ILI and laboratory-confirmed influenza A/H1N1 cases reported between May 1 and December 31, 2009. we compiled age-specific time series of ILI and A/H1N1 influenza cases by day of symptom onset. for each spatial unit we recorded the cumulative number of cases and peak day, defined as the day with the maximum number of new cases. we then investigated geographic variation in the timing of pandemic onset across departments and provinces and their association with demographic factors and distance from Lima. the early ascending phase was determined as the period between the day of pandemic onset (as defined earlier) and the midpoint between the onset and peak days. the reproduction number was calculated by substituting the estimate for r into an expression derived from the linearization of the classical Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) transmission model. we also obtained an upper bound estimate for the extreme case of a fixed generation interval (delta distribution) demic and rapid depletion of susceptibles occurring in the first weeks of the outbreak, especially among highly connected individuals such as school-age children. we quantified the expected reduction in the final pandemic attack rate as a function of the reduction of the transmission rate among the student population associated with school closing. absolute humidity and temporal profile of the pandemic in the 134 provinces of Peru. for this purpose, we compared daily variation in number of new A/H1N1 influenza cases and average specific humidity in Peru weighted by the total number of A/H1N1 cases reported in each province from May 1 to December 31, 2009. the impact of the winter school vacation on the age distribution of cases and pandemic burden. we evaluated weekly trends in the ratio of incident A/H1N1 cases among the student population (ages 5\u201320 years) to incident cases among all other age groups in the Lima metropolitan area. daily timeseries of ILI and A/H1N1 influenza cases in the greater Lima metropolitan area and the rest of Peru were highly synchronized (Spearman rho = 0.8\u20130.9, P0.0001) Overall testing rates were higher in the greater Lima metropolitan area (86%) than in the rest of Peru (56%), and rates remained relatively stable over the entire pandemic period. there was an initial increase in average testing rates nationally from 60 to 80% during the first 6\u20137 weeks of the shaded area corresponds to the school closure period (07/16\u201308/06). the distribution of ILI and A/H1N1 influenza cases across the 24 Peruvian departments for the months of May, June, July, and August\u2013December, 2009. timing of pandemic onset at the province level was not associated with a decline in absolute humidity levels within 30 days of onset. at the department level, timing of pandemic onset was moderately and significantly correlated with population size (rho = 0.51, P = 0.03) and population density. the epidemic growth phase used to estimate the reproduction number consisted of 12 days for the greater Lima metropolitan area (May 31 to June 11) and 16 for the rest of Peru (June 10 to June 25). at the national scale, this ratio was significantly below 1.0 during the winter school vacations and exceeded 1.0 two weeks following the resumption of school activities. the grey shaded area indicates the winter school vacation period (July16th to August 6th) the average trend in ratio of student to nonstudent cases across departments was weighted by the total number of confirmed A/H1N1 cases. the average RT-PCR positivity throughout the pandemic was 49.6%. daily timeseries of ILI and A/H1N1 influenza cases in the greater Lima metropolitan area and the rest of Peru were highly synchronized. the average RT-PCR positivity throughout the pandemic was 49.6%. the daily curve of new cases peaked on September 22, 2009 in this region. the daily curve of new cases peaked on September 22, 2009 in this region. the shaded area corresponds to the 2-week winter school break. timing of pandemic onset was moderately and significantly associated with population density. timing of pandemic onset was not associated with a decline in absolute humidity levels within 30 days of onset. no significant association between timing of the pandemic and population size. ifference of 0.1\u20130.2 for the R estimates for the greater Lima metropolitan area and less than 0.05 for the R estimate for the rest of Peru. corresponding 95% confidence intervals in the greater Lima metropolitan area and the rest of Peru. the ratio was lower and stayed below 1 for longer in the Lima metropolitan area than in the rest of Peru. the ratio was consistent with the early pandemic wave changing the age structure of susceptible individuals in Lima in June 2009. transmission rate among the student population yields a 4\u201310% reduction in the pandemic attack rate when the 22-day school closing period takes place 5\u201320 days after the epidemic peak. a higher R0 value of 1.8 is associated with an even smaller reduction in the attack rate (4\u20137%) we found a significant reduction in the ratio of student to non-student cases during the winter school vacation period compared to the weeks before and after the winter break. the winter school vacation period coincided with the downward phase of the pandemic in Peru. higher estimates ranging from 2.3 to 3.3 have been obtained during school outbreaks [6], [30], [45]. variability in published estimates could be attributed to differences in estimation methods and assumptions. heterogeneity in timing and intensity of intervention strategies, school activity periods, and climatic conditions could have also contributed to differences in reproduction number estimates across locations. recent research has revealed that influenza circulation patterns differ across geographic regions in Peru in inter-pandemic periods. in the coastal region surrounding Lima, influenza circulates year round with particularly elevated numbers of cases in the winter time. the timing of the 2009 influenza pandemic and contemporaneous winter influenza epidemics in Lima is in contrast with the timing of the 1918\u20131920 influenza pandemic in this city. the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic in Peru exhibited a rich spatial-temporal pattern with two pandemic waves of varying timing and impact across age groups and geographic regions. larger population areas experienced earlier pandemic onset, suggesting a hierarchical influenza transmission pattern."}
