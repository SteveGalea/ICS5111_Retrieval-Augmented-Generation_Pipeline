{"summary": "female db/db mice (C57BLKS/JLepr) were used. their lean age-matched littermates (db/m) served as nondiabetic controls. streptozotocin (STZ)-treated mice were used to study effect of glycemic control by insulin on urinary ACE2. db/m and db/db mice (n = 10) were followed for several months to examine the effect of age on parameters such as urinary ACE2 and albumin/creatinine ratio. another group of db/m and db/db mice (n = 10) were followed for 4 wk the same way, and then were assigned to drink tap water with an ACE inhibitor, captopril (n = 7\u201310 in each group), at a dose pestle and the cell strainer was then washed with 5 ml of HBSS. the resulting cell suspension was centrifuged at 200 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. glomeruli were homogenized in a buffer for overnight at 4\u00b0C. 1% Triton-X-100 contains EDTA-free tablets (Roche) and 10 mol/l of a specific ACE2 inhibitor, MLN-4760. fluorescence was measured using an FLX800 microplate fluorescence reader (BIOTEK Instruments, Winooski, VT) at 320 nm excitation. urine samples were concentrated on centrifugal concentrators of 5-kDa cut off. proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. membranes were blocked in nonfat dry milk solubilized in saline solution containing 0.1% Tween 20 (7% wt/vol) the incubation was performed with or without addition of the specific ACE2 inhibitor, MLN-4760 (106 M). ANG II quantity in each sample was expressed as a percentage ratio of the ANG II remaining after a given incubation time to the initial ANG II load (100%). ANG III, ANG IV, and ANG-(4\u20138) exhibit 36%, 33% and 41% cross-reactivity. s between two groups were analyzed using a two-tailed Student's t-test. for nonnormally distributed data, values were expressed as means standard error of the mean (SE) for nonnormally distributed data, the median and interquartile range were used. male wild-type (WT) and ACE2 knockout mice on C57BL/6J background (6) were used to obtain urine for validation of urinary ACE2 activity. db/m (n = 10) and db/db mice (n = 10) were followed for several months to examine the effect of age on parameters such as urinary ACE2 and albumin/creatinine ratio. another group of db/m and db/db mice (n = mouse kidneys were perfused with 8 107 particles of Dynabeads M-450 (Invitrogen) diluted in 40 ml of PBS. they were minced into small pieces and digested in collagenase A (Roche) and deoxyribonuclease I (Sigma) solution at 37\u00b0C for 30 min with gentle agitation. the digested tissue was pressed through a 100-m cell strainer using a flattened the measurements were performed in black microtiter plates with a 100 l total volume. 2 l urine, 2 l serum or 1 g total protein from tissue homogenate was added to wells containing a buffer (50 mmol/l 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid, 300 mmol/l NaCl, 10 mol/l ZnCl2 and 0.01% Triton-X-100, pH 6.5) the range of ACE2 activity in urine from wild-type mice corresponded to concentrations of 454\u20131487 pg/ml urine. as little as 15.6 pg/ml of rACE2 was detectable in spiked urines from ACE2 knockout mice. urine samples were concentrated on centrifugal concentrators of 5-kDa cut off. urines collected from 16-wk-old female db/m and db/db mice representing equal creatinine concentration (10 g/ml) were individually incubated with 109 M ANG II (Sigma) for up to 4 h at 37\u00b0 C in PBS pH 7.4 containing 5 M ZnCl2. samples were diluted 1/5 in EDTA-containing buffer. blood was collected from tail vein (around 15 l) after rACE2 intraperitoneal bolus. urine was collected in metabolic cages over 3 h after rACE2 intraperitoneal bolus. STZ-treated mice were randomly divided into two groups. one group received insulin pellets for 12 wk. the other group did not receive insulin. blood was obtained from the tail vein and glycemia was assessed. spot urine was collected repeatedly every 1\u20134 wk, so that under control conditions and at each treatment period at least four spot urine collections were obtained. the effect of salt intake on urinary parameters was examined by providing high-salt (8% NaCl) and low-salt (0.1% NaCl) diets for several weeks to female db/m and db/db mice. ACE2 activity was measured in glomerular and tubular lysates corresponding to 1 g of total protein. urine, serum, and kidney ACE2 activity were determined following incubation. urine from ACE2 knockout mice was spiked with increasing amounts of purified soluble mouse rACE2 which resulted in an increase in fluorescence signal in a dose-dependent manner. the range of ACE2 activity in urine from wild-type mice corresponded to concentrations of 454\u20131487 pg/ml urine by the comparison with purified recombinant enzyme under identical conditions. urines collected from 16-wk-old female db/m and db/db mice representing equal creatinine concentration (10 g/ml) were incubated with 109 M ANG II (Sigma) for up to 4 h at 37\u00b0 C in PBS pH 7.4 containing 5 M ZnCl2. samples were diluted 1/5 in EDTA-containing buffer and immediately frozen. ANG III, ANG IV, and ANG-(4\u20138) exhibit 36%, 33% and 41% cross-reactivity. female db/m (n = 5) and db/db (n = 5) at 10 wk of age were used to study effect of rACE2 administration on serum and urinary ACE2 activity. before administration of rACE2, blood was collected from tail vein (around 15 l) urinary ACE2 activity/creatinine ratio in db/db mice increased over time. the increase in ACE2/creatinine ratio antedated the increase in albumin/creatinine ratio. 2\u20133 adjacent measurements were averaged each time to better show differences in urinary ACE2 activity/creatinine ratio (C) and albumin/creatinine ratio (D) between db/m and db/db mice. urinary ACE2 activity was also increased in urines from db/db mice of about 18 wk of age compared with age-matched db/m mice. Urinary angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activity in db/db mice was about 3-fold higher using both 12-h ACE2 excretion rates (A) and using ACE2 activity/creatinine ratio (B) a significant positive correlation between ACE2 activity/12 h and urine volume (D) and between ACE2 activity/creatinine ratio and urine volume (E) were also found. db/db had higher levels of urinary ACE2 activity than their age-matched db/m controls. low salt also reduced urinary ACE2 activity compared with a high-salt diet. differences in ACE2 activity between control and diabetic mice persisted during changes in dietary salt intake. urinary ACE2 activity was not significantly different between high- and low-salt diets. the difference between db/m and db/db mice persisted over the time course of the administration of captopril and telmisartan. urine ACE2 activity/creatinine ratio (A) and albumin/creatinine ratio (C) measured at 1- to 3-wk intervals 3\u20134 consecutive times. significant differences between db/db and db/m were observed by repeated-measures analysis using GLM during the control period. in/creatinine ratio was significantly higher in db/db mice compared with db/m before (P 0.01) and during captopril (P 0.05) and telmisartan administration (P 0.01). administration of both RAS blocking agents was associated with a significant decrease in albumin/creatinine ratio (P 0.05) kidney cortex ACE2 protein and ACE2 activity are increased in db/db mice of various age groups compared soluble recombinant (r)ACE2 acutely (1 mg/kg ip) administration of rACE2 resulted in a marked increase in serum ACE2 activity in both db/m and db/db mice. rACE2 administration resulted in a marked increase in serum ACE2 activity compared with the ACE2 activity in serum collected before rACE2 administration. ACE2 activity in db/db mice in isolated kidney tubules and glomeruli was significantly higher than in db/m mice. ACE2 activity in isolated glomeruli and kidney tubules was significantly higher than in db/m mice. tubular ACE2 activity in db/db mice was significantly higher than in db/m controls. glomerular ACE2 activity plotted against ACE2 activity measured in urines from the same mice obtained at the date animal was euthanized. urine ACE2 activity/creatinine ratio fell significantly in STZ-treated mice with insulin compared with STZ-treated mice without insulin administration. urine ACE2 activity/creatinine ratio fell significantly in STZ-treated mice compared with STZ-treated mice not treated with insulin. bars in B and C represent means of 3 consecutive spot urine collections 1\u20132 wk apart for each experimental group. ACE2 activity was not significantly reduced by insulin in STZ-treated mice at 5\u20137 wk of its administration but it fell significantly after 8\u201312 wk of its administration. urines from db/db mice (n = 11) degraded ANG II more rapidly than urines from db/db mice (n = 9). db/db mice showed markedly elevated levels of urinary ACE2 activity than db/m controls. db/db mice showed markedly elevated levels of urinary ACE2 activity. mouse urine contains enzymatically active ACE2 that significantly influences urinary ANG II-degrading capability. in concentrated urines from db/m and db/db mice of 20\u201324 wk of age two ACE2 immunoreactive protein bands (75 and 110 kDa) were observed. relative abundance of the ACE2 protein band at 110 kDa was significantly increased in urine from db/db (n = 16) compared with urine from urines from db/m and db/db mice showed an ACE2 immunoreactive band at around 100\u2013110 kDa and also a band at 75 kDa, which was variably seen. urines from db/m and db/db mice also showed an ACE2 immunoreactive band at around 100\u2013110 kDa and also a band at 75 kDa. db/m and db/db soluble recombinant mouse ACE2 (rACE2) was run in parallel (lane 1) and showed a main band at 100\u2013110 kDa as well as an additional band at a higher molecular size. at 7 wk of age, db/db mice have been diabetic for 2 years. urinary ACE2 activity/creatinine ratio in db/db mice increased over time. the increase in ACE2/creatinine ratio antedated the increase in albumin/creatinine ratio. urinary ACE2 activity was also increased in urines from db/db mice of 18 wk of age compared with age-matched db/m mice. ACE2 activity/creatinine ratio correlated well with ACE2 activity expressed per 12-h time unit. Urinary angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activity in db/db mice was about 3-fold higher using both 12-h ACE2 excretion rates (A) and using ACE2 activity/creatinine ratio (B) a significant positive correlation between ACE2 activity/12 h and urine volume (D) and between ACE2 activity/creatinine ratio and urine volume (E) were also found. db/db had higher levels of urinary ACE2 activity than their age-matched db/m controls. low salt also reduced urinary ACE2 activity compared with a high-salt diet. differences in ACE2 activity between control and diabetic mice persisted during changes in dietary salt intake. urinary ACE2 activity was not significantly different between high- and low-salt diets. the difference between db/m and db/db mice persisted over time course of administration of captopril and telmisartan. urine ACE2 activity/creatinine ratio (A) and albumin/creatinine ratio (C) measured at 1- to 3-wk intervals 3\u20134 consecutive times. significant differences between db/db and db/m were observed by repeated-measures analysis using GLM during the control period. atinine ratio was significantly higher in db/db mice compared with db/m before (P 0.01) and during captopril (P 0.05) and telmisartan administration (P 0.01) in db/db mice the administration of both RAS blocking agents was associated with a significant decrease in albumin/creatinine ratio (P 0.05) soluble recombinant (r)ACE2 acutely (1 mg/kg ip) administration to db/m mice resulted in a marked increase in serum ACE2 activity compared with the ACE2 activity in serum collected before rACE2 administration. soluble recombinant (r)ACE2 activity in urine, however, did not increase significantly after rACE2 infusion to db/m mice (9.5 2.9 vs. 5.7 0.3, P ACE2 activity in db/db mice in isolated kidney tubules and glomeruli was significantly higher than in db/m mice. ACE2 activity in isolated glomeruli and kidney tubules was significantly higher than in db/m mice. tubular ACE2 activity in db/db mice was significantly higher than in db/m controls. no correlation was found between glomerular and urinary ACE2 activity in 32-wk-old db/m and db/db mice. urine ACE2 activity/creatinine ratio fell significantly in STZ-treated mice with insulin compared with STZ-treated mice without insulin administration. urine ACE2 activity/creatinine ratio fell significantly in STZ-treated mice compared with STZ-treated mice not treated with insulin. bars in B and C represent means of 3 consecutive spot urine collections 1\u20132 wk apart for each experimental group. ACE2 activity was not significantly reduced by insulin in STZ-treated mice at 5\u20137 wk of its administration but it fell significantly after 8\u201312 wk of its administration. urines from db/db mice (n = 11) degraded ANG II more rapidly than urines from db/db mice (n = 9). db/db mice showed markedly elevated levels of urinary ACE2 activity. db/db mice showed markedly elevated levels of urinary ACE2 activity. mouse urine contains enzymatically active ACE2 that significantly influences urinary ANG II-degrading capability. in concentrated urines from db/m and db/db mice of 20\u201324 wk of age two ACE2 immunoreactive protein bands (75 and 110 kDa) were observed. relative abundance of the ACE2 protein band at 110 kDa was significantly increased in urine from db/db (n = 16) compared with urine from urines from db/m and db/db mice showed an ACE2 immunoreactive band at around 100\u2013110 kDa and also a band at 75 kDa, which was variably seen. urines from db/m and db/db mice also showed an ACE2 immunoreactive band at around 100\u2013110 kDa. in isolated kidney cortex plasma membranes from these younger db/m and db/db mice soluble recombinant mouse ACE2 (rACE2) was run in parallel (lane 1) and showed a main band at 100\u2013110 kDa as well as an additional band at a higher molecular size. at 7 wk of age, db/db mice have been diabetic for 2 wk of age. urinary ACE2 activity/creatinine ratio in db/db mice increased over time. the increase in ACE2/creatinine ratio antedated the increase in albumin/creatinine ratio. urinary ACE2 activity was also increased in urines from db/db mice of 18 wk of age compared with age-matched db/m mice. ACE2 activity/creatinine ratio correlated well with ACE2 activity expressed per 12-h time unit when data from db/m and db/db mice were pooled. inary angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activity in db/db mice was about 3-fold higher using both 12-h ACE2 excretion rates (A) and using ACE2 activity/creatinine ratio (B) a significant positive correlation between ACE2 activity/12 h and urine volume (D) and between ACE2 activity/creatinine ratio and urine volume (E) were also found. the low-salt diet ingestion in db/db mice caused urine ACE2 activity to fall below the level of the ACE2 activity measured at the time of normal salt intake (P 0.05). in db/m mice, low salt also reduced urinary ACE2 activity compared with a high-salt diet (P 0.05). urinary ACE2 activity was not significantly different between high- and low-salt diets. the difference between db/m and db/db mice persisted over time course of administration of captopril and telmisartan. blocking agents on urinary ACE2 activity/creatinine ratio were also observed when the values from four consecutive measurements were averaged for each experimental condition. neither form of RAS blockade altered urinary ACE2 activity and the large differences between db/m and db/db persisted throughout the control and treatment phases. ratio was significantly higher in db/db mice compared with db/m before (P 0.01) and during captopril (P 0.05) and telmisartan administration (P 0.01). administration of both RAS blocking agents was associated with a decrease in albumin/creatinine ratio (P 0.05) soluble recombinant (r)ACE2 acutely (1 mg/kg ip) administration of rACE2 resulted in a marked increase in serum ACE2 activity compared with the ACE2 activity in serum collected before rACE2 administration. soluble recombinant (r)ACE2 acutely (1 mg/kg ip) activity in urine, however, did not increase significantly after rACE2 infusion to db/m mice. ACE2 activity in db/db mice in isolated kidney tubules and glomeruli was significantly higher than in db/m mice. ACE2 activity in isolated glomeruli was not significantly different between the control and diabetic mice. tab ACE2 activity in kidney tubular preparations (A) and glomeruli isolated using Dynabeads (B) in 32-wk-old female db/m (white bars) and db/db mice (gray bars) no correlation was found between glomerular and urinary ACE2 activity in db/db mice (R = 0.079, P = NS, n = 14) db/db model used STZ-treated mice as a model to study whether insulin in itself influences levels of urinary ACE2 activity. urine ACE2 activity/creatinine ratio in STZ mice was not significantly different from STZ-treated mice without insulin administration in the initial 5\u20137 wk. bars in B and C represent means of 3 consecutive spot urine collections 1\u20132 wk apart for each experimental group. ACE2 activity was not significantly reduced by insulin in STZ-treated mice at 5\u20137 wk of its administration but it fell significantly after 8\u201312 wk of its administration. db/db mice consistently showed markedly elevated levels of urinary ACE2 activity than db/m controls. urines from db/db mice (n = 11) degraded ANG II more rapidly than urines collected from db/m mice (n = 9). half-life of ANG II calculated in urines from db/db mice was significantly lower than in urines from db/db mice. mouse urine contains enzymatically active ACE2 that significantly influences urinary ANG II-degrading capability. in concentrated urines from db/m and db/db mice of 20\u201324 wk of age two ACE2 immunoreactive protein bands (75 and 110 kDa) were observed. relative abundance of the ACE2 protein band at 110 kDa was significantly increased in urine from db/db (n = 16) urines from db/m and db/db mice showed an ACE2 immunoreactive band at around 100\u2013110 kDa and also a band at 75 kDa. urines from db/m and db/db mice also showed an ACE2 immunoreactive band at around 100\u2013110 kDa and also a band at 75 kDa, which was variably seen. db/m and db/db soluble recombinant mouse ACE2 (rACE2) was run in parallel (lane 1) and showed a main band at 100\u2013110 kDa as well as an additional band at a higher molecular size. it is abundantly expressed in the kidney, mainly in tubular epithelial cells and to a lesser extent in glomeruli and the renal vasculature (47, 48). levels of ACE2 activity in the various nephron segments govern the local levels of ANG II. the formation of ANG-(1\u20137) is also dependent on cleavage of ANG II by ACE2 (28, 37, 42, 46) the level of ACE2 activity in the urine could potentially serve as a biomarker of diabetic kidney disease. db/m mice were infused with soluble recombinant ACE2 to control and diabetic mice. a marked increase in circulating (serum) ACE2 activity was observed. this is in keeping with the high molecular weight of soluble ACE2. rACE2 administration to db/db mice failed to increase urinary ACE2 activity. an increase in ACE2 with a high-salt diet resulted in a sharp increase in urinary ACE2 activity in both diabetic and nondiabetic mice. an increase in ACE2 with a high-salt diet would reduce ANG II levels and therefore promote natriuresis. a decrease in ACE2 would increase it and promote sodium retention. pical membrane of proximal tubular cells (48) but is also present in parietal and visceral epithelial glomerular cells (48) ACE2 is increased in kidney cortex but decreased by immunostaining in glomeruli from young db/db mice (8 wk of age) kidney ACE2 activity was also reported to be elevated in kidney cortex (33, 35, 40, 43) studies in cultured human embryonic kidney cells and airway epithelial cells suggest ACE2 is proteolytically shed from the plasma membrane into the culture media at its carboxy terminus. renal ADAM17 is upregulated in ANG II-induced kidney injury (14), and de novo expression occurs in human kidney disease, in proximal tubule, podocytes, and mesangial cells (16). mouse ACE2 has been shown to have slightly lower molecular mass (110 kDa) than human ACE2 (120 kDa) by two independent groups. the lower ACE2 band (75 kDa) may be the result of degradation of the soluble ACE2 protein. ANG II degradation is increased by mice urine as previously reported in sheep urine (30) db/m and db/db urine degrading capacity were not significant in the presence of a specific ACE2 inhibitor. other peptidases, such as neprilysin, can also metabolize ANG II in the urine. urinary ACE2 activity is increased in diabetic mice and the source of this increase is of tubular rather than glomerular origin. the activity of ACE2 in the urine significantly influences ANG II degrading capacity and probably reflects protein shed from the tubular plasma membrane.
