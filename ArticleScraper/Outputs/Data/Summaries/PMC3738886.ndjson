{"summary": "genome ANNOUNCEMENT Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-strand RNA virus that causes severe diarrhea and dehydration in pigs. PEDV was characterized in feeder and fattening pigs and subsequently identified in Belgium, Hungary, Korea, Italy, Thailand, Japan, and china. complete genomic sequence of CO/13 is 28,038 nucleotides (nt) excluding the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. the genome arrangement and corresponding nucleotide positions are as follows. the complete genome of CO/13 has a nucleotide identity of 96.5 to 99.5%. PEDV USA/Colorado/2013 sequence data will further understanding of the genetic diversity of PEDVs."}
