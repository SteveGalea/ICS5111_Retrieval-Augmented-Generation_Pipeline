{"summary": "Rfam release 9.0 contains 603 families, each represented by a multiple sequence alignment of known and predicted representative members of the family. each Rfam covariance model is searched against a nucleotide sequence database, producing a list of putative hits. matches that score above a curated threshold are then aligned to the CM to produce a so-called FULL alignment. RFAMSEQ has been expanded to include the whole genome shotgun (WGS) and environmental sequence (ENV) divisions. these changes have increased the number of sequences in RFAMSEQ by more than an order of magnitude (2 225 030 sequences in Rfam 8.0 versus 29 574 458 sequences in Rfam 9.0) more than 370 families have been expanded by an \u2018iteration\u2019 process. sequences selected from FULL alignments must pass stringent quality control requirements and be manually approved by a curator. the sequence identity with existing SEED sequences falls within 60\u201395%. RFAMSEQ All Rfam models are searched against an underlying nucleotide sequence database, known as RFAMSEQ. prior to release 9.0, RFAMSEQ represented only the various species sections of EMBL. these sections contained only sequences considered to be of finished quality and excluded sequences from many important genomes. more than 370 families have been expanded by an \u2018iteration\u2019 process. the sequences selected from FULL alignments must pass stringent quality control requirements and be manually approved by a curator. the curator also ensures that the new sequences make phylogenetic sense before allowing them to be integrated into an updated SEED. large alignments and trees are problematic, both in terms of the computational cost of generation and the challenges of displaying them. the number of sequences in the alignment was greater than 1024, resulting in relatively sparse and easily presented trees that required relatively little computing power to generate. a new taxonomy search tool allows the user to find Rfam families that are specific to a given taxonomic level. the query \u2018Drosophila AND Caenorhabditis NOT Mammalia\u2019 returns the two Rfam families that contain sequences from both drosophila and caenorhabditis but no sequences from any mammalian species. the coronavirus 3\u2032-UTR pseudoknot is shown (Rfam Accession RF00165) we display coloured markups of sequence conservation (A), covariation (B), base-pair conservation also known as fraction of canonical base pairs (C) and CM scores (D). a new taxonomy search tool allows the user to find Rfam families that are specific to a given taxonomic level, or those found in a set of taxonomic levels that are specified by a complex, boolean query. for example, the query \u2018Drosophila AND Caenorhabditis NOT Mammalia\u2019 returns the two Rfam families that contain sequences from both drosophila and caenorhabditis but no sequences from the maximum covariance model score and corresponding nucleotide/base pair are computed for each node in the CM. the resulting sequence, structure and bit-scores are used to produce a marked up secondary structure. the coronavirus 3\u2032-UTR pseudoknot is shown (Rfam Accession RF00165) the next release of Rfam (version 9.1) will contain more than 700 entirely new families, bringing the total number of Rfam families to over 1300. v1.0 is faster and slightly more sensitive, whilst introducing for the first time E-values for hits returned from database searches. RNA bases that match the Rfam model are coloured according to the key given in the web page. in this structure, green represents a match to the eukaryotic SRP model, while those unmatched bases are coloured orange."}
