{"summary": "crosstalk between microglia and neurons:neurons as regulators of microglial activation 2. Cross talk between astrocytes and microglia: reciprocal influences 3. Microglia-T cell crosstalk:key determinants for the trend of immune response V. microglia are generally considered the immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) hypotheses for microglial origin have been held: \"neuroectodermal\" or \"myeloid-monocytic\" a rat model of optic nerve degeneration and optic nerve development found the cells to originate from neuroectodermal matrix cells. the hematopoietic origin of microglia also received a lot attention. neurotoxicity and neuroprotection Neuroinflammation has long been considered a mediator of secondary damage following a small injury to the CNS. the presence of activated microglia within injured brain regions and in post-mortem tissue from patients having various neurodegenerative disorders has led to the assumption that all reactive microglia contribute to an adverse and degenerative process. microglia activated in the substantia nigra region led to a progressive, preferential and irreversible loss of dopaminergic neurons. all of the evidence described above supports the hypotheses of the neurotoxic features of microglia. however, as the sentinel and essential cells of the CNS, it is unlikely that microglia would function to damage neurons in all scenarios. in neonatal mice administered MPTP, highly activated microglia show neurotrophic potential towards dopamine neurons [43] and after traumatic injury, clear glutamate without evoking inflammatory mediators [44] the benefits of microglial activation are further demonstrated by the exacerbation of neuropathology in inducible mouse models that are deficient in microglia [45,46], the finding of protective microglia in cases of cerebral ischemia [47] and multiple sclerosis igiwa et al., 2000 [51] tumor Bosco et al., 2011[52] Ischemic insult Hur et al., 2010 [53] Nerve injury Maeda et al., 2010 [54] Proteins -synuclein Lee et al., 2010; Su et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2005 [55-57] amyloid-beta Jana et al microglia function In steady state Healthy resting state Surveillance, homeostasis, fixed cell and motile processes, minimal expression of cell surface markers and release of cytokines and chemokines. neurotoxic Parkinson\u2019s disease Releasing various kinds of noxious cytokines, reactive oxygen species and generate toxic ROS. microglia must be variable, adaptive to their environment and capable of integrating various inputs and responding appropriately. polazzi hypothesized that activation of microglia as a consequence of neuronal injury is primarily aimed at neuroprotection. microglia exhibited an activated phenotype and were numerous upon facial nerve transaction. damaged CD200-deficient neurons elicited an accelerated microglial response. blockade of neuronal electrical activity by tetrodotoxin facilitated microglial activation. microglia activated earlier than astrocytes, promote astrocytic activation through IL-1 which is mostly from microglia. microglia activated earlier than astrocytes, promote astrocytic activation through IL-1 which is mostly from microglia. microglia activated earlier than astrocytes, promote astrocytic activation. activated-microglial-conditioned media increased astroglial proliferation [127], down-regulated the astroglial metabotropic glutamate receptor [128] and induced astroglial brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and IL-6 gene expression [129]. the importance of microglial activities lies in that they not only exert direct effects on neuronal survival, but also affect the responses of other supporting cells. a model for optic nerve injury found that the passive transfer of regulatory CD4 + CD25+ T cells was either destructive or beneficial depending on the genetic background of the mice tested. the entire scenario of crosstalk between microglia and microglia could be described as: microglia are initially activated by pathological stimuli during acute or chronic injury to the brain. CD200-CD200R is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is expressed on the neuronal membrane surface. the CD200 receptor (CD200R) is primarily present in the macrophage lineage, which includes microglia [97] the disruption of CD200-CD200R interactions results in an accelerated microglial response, while intensified CD200-CD200R interactions contribute to an attenuation in neurodegeneration [98] microglia are not only surveyors of brain tissue but also receive and actively respond to signals from neurons. the interactions between microglia and microglia are far from simple and crucial for our understanding of how microglia respond to their environment. microglia activated earlier than astrocytes promote astrocytic activation through IL-1 which is mostly from microglia. activated-microglial media increased astroglial proliferation [127], down-regulated the astroglial metabotropic glutamate receptor [128] and induced astroglial brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF and IL-6 gene expression [129]. monsonego et al. demonstrated that IFN-treated microglia serve as efficient A antigen-presenting cells (APCs) of both A1-40 and A1-42 mediating CD86-dependent proliferation of A-reactive T cells. the activated T cells then exert effects in the injured neural tissues by altering the reactive microglial phenotypes and inducing astrocytic expression of growth factors. studies have highlighted the beneficial and important roles of microglia in neuronal regeneration, repair and neurogenesis. these seemingly paradoxical results cannot be directly compared, because they come from different experimental sets that vary in terms of stimulus, timing of microglial activation and age of animals. senescence in microglia causes them to function abnormally and that the destructive roles of activated microglia may result from age-associated microglia senescence. microglial cells in rats exhibit significant telomere shortening and a reduction in telomerase activity during normal aging. the timing of microglial proliferation and presentation in the injured aged brain is distinct from that in the young brain. some critical questions remain unanswered. the young brain respond by releasing neurotrophic factors (small yellow dots) to support the endangered dopaminergic neurons. timing of microglial activation is an indispensible determinant of microglial function. timing of microglial activation leads to diverse trends and outcomes. the timing of microglial activation appears to be crucial to the outcome of the injury. the timing of microglial activation appears to be crucial to the outcome of the injury. the timing of microglial activation appears to be crucial to the outcome. microglia do not constitute a single, uniform cell population, but rather comprise a family of cells with diverse phenotypes. the first is the classical activation state of microglia, which is responsible for the pro-inflammatory milieu. the second is alternatively activated microglia, which are associated with the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. in AD, some levels of classical activation may be required to limit the brain levels of A despite the risk of self-damage [163]. alternative activation of microglia in AD may foster the protection of the surrounding tissue from immune damage even though it may facilitate A deposits. the recognition of heterogeneous phenotypes of microglia only raises questions. neurotoxic cytokines and ROS were released from microglia only in response to mild neuronal injuries. neurotoxic cytokines and ROS were released from microglia only in response to mild neuronal injuries. trophic microglial effectors such as BDNF and GDNF were up-regulated in response to all degrees of neuronal injury. microglial proliferation rates in the aged rat brain were significantly higher than in the young rat brain four days after axotomy of the facial nerve [148] the distinct pattern of the microglial response to injury in the aged brain has also been recorded in the model of controlled cortical impact (CCI) [154] and transient retinal ischemia [156]. the aging brain is concurrent with or secondary to microglial dystrophy. microglia functions differentially in the young and aged brain. oxidative stress and inflammatory factors (small yellow dots) damage dopaminergic neurons. timing of microglial activation is an indispensible determinant of microglial function. encephalomyelitis (EAE) [157], the inhibition of microglial activation through tPA knockout (tissue plasminogen activator, an essential element for microglia activation) leads to a delayed onset of the disease but increased severity and delayed recovery from the neurological dysfunction. these findings suggest different roles for microglial activation during various phases of the disease and that different timing of microglial activation dramatically affects whether microglia will be neuroprotective or deleterious phenotypes of macrophages have long been known to play different roles in the inflammatory context. classically-activated macrophages promote the release of various pro-inflammatory cytokines. however, activated macrophages predominate in the T Helper type 2 (Th-2) microenvironment. multiple activation states of microglia coexist in certain chronic inflammations due to parasitic disease [162], in which the balance between classical activation and alternative activation/acquired deactivation states is of \u201cbenefit\u201d to both host and parasite. the host benefits from reduced self-damage and the parasite eventually survives within the host. function In a neonatal mouse MPTP-induced brain injury model, microglia activated by systemic administration of LPS were shown to be neuroprotective. ethanol-injury model caused a marked increase both in the volume of necrotic lesions and in the number of degenerating neurons in the striatum. trophic microglial effectors such as BDNF and GDNF were up-regulated in response to all degrees of neuronal injury. the microenvironment or niche in which neural progenitor cells live critically influences the process of neurogenesis. microglia are increasingly implicated as a potential non-neural regulator of neurogenesis. however, whether microglia support or damage the survival and development of neural progenitor cells also remains controversial. microglia that are activated by anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4 or TGF- increase neurogenesis in vitro or differentiation of neural stem cells in vivo. if other cytokines exist simultaneously, the outcome will be determined by the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory secreted molecules. the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory secreted molecules influences the final effect of microglial activation. the same inflammatory scenario that induces neurodegeneration would also inhibit neurogenesis, while a situation that favors neuronal survival would also support neurogenesis. aging may also be involved in the downregulation of neurogenesis in the aged or diseased brain. immunodeficient mice show impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampus. but this deficiency was attenuated and neurogenesis boosted by T cells recognizing a specific CNS antigen [193]. it is reasonable to assume that the T cell-mediated immune response is an integral part of the regulation of microglial phenotype or function."}
