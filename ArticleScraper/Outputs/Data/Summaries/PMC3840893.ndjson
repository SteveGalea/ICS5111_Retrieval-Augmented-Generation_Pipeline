{"summary": "the first collection consisted of 158 serum samples taken from children hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infections. the samples came from 77 female and 81 male patients with a median age of 11.6 months (range 7.3 months to 9 years) the second collection consisted of 110 plasma samples from men with a median age of 28 years (range 19\u201352 years) who donated blood at the hospital during December 2012. none of the samples investigated contained neutralizing antibodies against MERS-S. entiviral vectors encoding luciferase were incubated with 1:20 dilutions of plasma from healthy adults. transduction efficiency was measured by quantification of luciferase activities in cell lysates. all 110 plasma samples available were tested for neutralization of MERS-S\u2013dependent transduction. subsets were also tested for neutralization of transduction driven by the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (V the estimated MERS-CoV seroprevalence in the area served by King Fahd Hospital was 2.3% in children during 2010\u20132011 and 3.3% in male adults in 2012. if they were hospitalized for MERS-CoV infection, a virus-specific antibody response might have developed after sampling."}
