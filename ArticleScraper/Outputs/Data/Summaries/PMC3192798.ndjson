{"summary": "a number of compounds have been identified that exhibit direct antiviral activity against these and related poxviruses in animal models. cidofovir, CMX-001, and ST-246 have all been used in emergency settings to treat vaccination complications [7], [8] vaccinia keratitis and vaccinia-induced skin lesions were treated with rIFN. pegylated rIFN has improved the in vivo half-life to allow for weekly injections, but results in a reduced activity of the protein. a single dose drug capable of achieving steady-state method of delivering interferon would maximize the therapeutic benefits of IFN. to this end, a replication-deficient adenovirus 5 (Ad5) vector containing the human consensus interferon alpha gene, called DEF201, has been developed. def201 treatment reduced yellow fever virus titers in liver and spleen. mDEF201 was evaluated for prophylaxis and therapy of WR strain respiratory infections in mice. increased lung weight and lung hemorrhage are hallmarks of vaccinia infection. mouse interferon alpha, subtype 5 construct mDEF201 was prepared at the Robert Fitzhenry Vector Laboratory (McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada) mDEF201 was cloned into a replication deficient Ad-5 vector, amplified in 293 cells and purified by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. mice surviving primary infection were re-infected on day 22 with 5105 PFU units of vaccinia virus in a 50-l volume. survival and body weights in these groups were determined over a 21-day period. groups of 5 infected mice per day were sacrificed for removal of tissues. adenovirus vectored mouse interferon alpha, subtype 5 construct mDEF201 was prepared at the Robert Fitzhenry Vector Laboratory. the mouse interferon alpha gene (subtype 5) was cloned into a replication deficient Ad-5 vector (deletions of E1 and E3 gene deletions) mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (50/5 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection. mice were initially infected intranasally with approximately 1\u20132105 PFU of vaccinia virus in a 50-l volume. age-matched normal control animals were infected for the first time with the same virus challenge. survival and body weights in these groups were determined over a 21-day period. groups of 5 infected mice per day were sacrificed for removal of tissues. mDEF201 was uniformly, 90\u2013100% protective from a lethal vaccinia challenge at doses of 105 to 107 PFU/animal. this protective effect can be attributed to the mIFN transgene because the empty adenovirus vector was not protective. cidofovir treatment caused nearly an 800-fold reduction in lung virus titer. mDEF201 was administered by intraperitoneal route once a day for two days. cidofovir group also received saline intranasally at 24 h. placebo groups were given single intranasal treatments. 107 PFU/mouse of mDEF201 was administered between 28 days and 1 day pre-virus exposure. all of the treatments with mDEF201 largely protected the animals against weight loss. seven placebo-treated animals survived the infection, differing from that of Table 1 where no animals survived. mDEF201 intranasal dose of 107 PFU/mouse was given only once. all animals not receiving mDEF201 on day -1 were treated intranasally with saline on that day. surviving mice from experiment 1 were re-infected with a 5-fold higher challenge of vaccinia virus than was originally given. infection of age-matched nave mice resulted in expected 100% mortality. weight loss occurred in all mDEF201 treated groups, but was much less severe than in nave, infected mice. infection of age-matched nave mice resulted in 100% mortality. weight loss occurred in all mDEF201 treated groups, but was minimal. body weights during the re-infection were similar for most mDEF201 groups. intranasal treatments with mDEF201 were given one time only on the indicated day prior to intranasal virus exposure (2.5105 PFU) there were no survivors in the placebo group on day 7 for data determinations. each data point represents the mean for five animals per group. Lung weights and lung hemorrhage scores were determined in infected mice. /mouse dose was 80\u201390% protective when given at 6 and 12 hours. survival time was significantly increased relative to the placebo control. mDEF201 was 100% protective when administered at 100 mg/kg/day for two days starting at 24 h. weight loss in mDEF201 treated mice increased with longer delay to commencement of treatment. all animals regaining their pre-challenge weight by day 18 of the experiment. mDEF201 prophylaxis is completely protective against lethal challenge. mDEF201 doses of 105 and 106 PFU/mouse reduced virus titers 8- and 125-fold. cidofovir treatment caused only a 40-fold reduction in virus titer. mDEF201 doses of 105 and 106 PFU/mouse reduced virus titers 8- and 125-fold. mDEF201 was administered by intraperitoneal route once a day for two days. placebo groups were given single intranasal treatments. mDEF201 was 100% protective when administered between 28 days and 1 day pre-virus exposure. mice at the time of infection were 28 days older, and susceptibility of the animals to infection diminishes with age. after that time, the seven animals that survived the infection began to recover body weight. the primary virus challenge dose for Experiment 2 was increased to 2.5105 PFU. reinfection of both sets of mice was performed intranasally with 5105 PFU of virus. c Uninfected, untreated for the primary infection, but infected at 22 days. mDEF201 was 90% protective when administered at -56 days. mDEF201 was 100% protective when given at all shorter time points. surviving mice that were treated with mDEF201 were re-infected with a 2-fold higher challenge of vaccinia. mDEF201 titers in mDEF201 treated groups were at least 100-fold less than in placebo treated mice. liver and spleen virus titers were below or near the level of detection in animals treated with mDEF201. the extent of inhibition of lung disease in the -28 days mDEF201 group was comparable to that seen in the -1 day mDEF201 group. mDEF201 has an extremely long-acting prophylactic activity against vaccinia virus infections in mice. mDEF201 (107) +6 h 9/10*** 8.0 Placebo +6 h 0/10 6.80.6 mDEF201 (108) +12 h 10/10*** 9.02.8 Placebo +12 h 0/10 7.10.3 mDEF201 (108) +24 h 9/9*** - mDEF201 (107) +24 h 3/10 9.62.8** Cidofovir (100) +24 h 10/10*** - Placebo a single intranasal dose of mDEF201 was found to exhibit a potent prophylactic activity that endured for at least 56 days. a single intranasal dose of mDEF201 was found to exhibit a potent prophylactic activity that endured for at least 56 days. mDEF201 was effective when given 7 days prior to infection but not at -21 days. this indicates that Ad5-vectored IFN induced a long-term antiviral state that was completely protective with a single dose. this extended prophylaxis appears to exist in the absence of measurable serum IFN levels. intranasal route of administration has been demonstrated to bypass pre-existing immunity to the adenovirus vector. intranasal delivery is also less invasive and easier to administer to large numbers of patients in the event of a mass infection due to a natural outbreak. both mDEF201 and DEF201 are effective as a treatment only when given within 1\u20132 days after virus exposure. this is the first study demonstrating that surviving mice treated with mDEF201 are protected against re-infection with the same virus. surviving mice treated with mDEF201 are protected against re-infection with the same virus. the intranasal method of delivery of DEF201 facilitates rapid prophylaxis in people entering a suspected poxvirus environment. def201 has the potential to treat a large number of unrelated viruses simultaneously, for which there are no current treatments."}
