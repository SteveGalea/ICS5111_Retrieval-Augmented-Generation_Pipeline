{"summary": "MERS-CoV is associated with high fatality rates (3, 4), and cases have increased to 909 laboratory-confirmed cases with 331 fatalities. MERS-CoV is the second emerging CoV with severe pathogenicity in humans within 10 years after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that infected approximately 8,000 people worldwide during its spread in 2003. the unusual tropism of MERS-CoV has been related to the wide tissue distribution of DPP4 on renal epithelial cells or leukocytes. innate immunity and IFN secretion are critical parameters for the outcome of MERS-CoV infection. pDCs produced large amounts of IFN- and IFN- and moderate amounts of IFN- upon contact with MERS-CoV without virus amplification. the observed IFN induction was dependent on the availability of the MERS-CoV receptor DPP4, endosomal maturation, or partially on PAMP recognition via toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) MERS-CoV (EMC/2012) (14) and SARS-CoV (27) were propagated in vero cells. titters were determined by 50% tissue culture infection dose (TCID50) titration on vero cells. 2 105 CD14+ monocytes were cultured in 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates using X-VIVO 15 medium (Lonza) for generation of GM-CSF-derived macrophages, monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 10 mM l-glutamine, 0.5 mM penicillin-streptomycin (PAA Laboratories, Egelsbach, Germany), 0.1 mM pDCs were seeded at a density of 2 104 pDCs/well in 96-well plates. pDCs were generated from bone marrow cells isolated from femurs and tibias of sacrificed 6- to 10-week-old C57BL/6N mice. pDCs were seeded at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 or 5. supernatants of human cells were analyzed using a human IFN- or mouse IFN- ELISA (R&D Systems), human IL-29 (IFN-1) ELISA (eBioscience, Frankfurt, Germany), or a human IL-6 DuoSet ELISA development system (R&D Systems) pDCs were preincubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with 5 M chloroquine (Sigma) or 5.6 M inhibitory oligonucleo Isolated RNA (10 l) was subjected to quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) using a superScript III Platinum OneStep qRT-PCR System (Invitrogen Life Technologies) with primers N2-Forward and N2-Reverse and probe N2-Probe. data were normalized to cellular glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA. 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 56\u00b0C for 1 min, 72\u00b0C for 30 s, and 95\u00b0C for 15 min. difference between threshold cycle numbers for qRT-PCR signals of viral RNA and cellular mRNA for a given sample. differences (n) between CT values were converted to x-fold ratios. Flow cytometry was performed on an LSRII-SORP fluorescence-activated cell sorter. data were analyzed using FACSDiva, version 6.1.3, or FCS Express, version 3 (De Novo Software, Los Angeles, CA) inactivated MERS-CoV was generated by UV inactivation (120,000 J/cm2 UV light [254 nm] for 90 min) titrated via plaque assay on vero cells as described previously. monocytes were cultured in 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates using X-VIVO 15 medium (Lonza) for generation of GM-CSF-derived macrophages, monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 10 mM l-glutamine, 0.5 mM penicillin-streptomycin (PAA Laboratories, Egelsbach, Germany) and 30 ng/ml M-CSF all pDCs were seeded at a density of 2.5 105 APCs/well. pDCs were seeded at a density of 2 104 pDCs/well. pDCs were seeded at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 or 5. pDCs were preincubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with 5 M chloroquine (Sigma) or 5.6 M inhibitory oligonucleotide (ODN) IRS661 (Invitrogen Life Technologies) in the presence of inhibitors. pDCs were preincubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with the recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) 104 pDCs were infected with MERS-CoV (MOI of 3) and washed once with medium at 1 hpi. total RNA of infected cells was isolated using an RNeasy Plus minikit. 50\u00b0C for 30 min and 95\u00b0C for 15 min followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 56\u00b0C for 1 min, 72\u00b0C for 30 s, and 95\u00b0C for 15 min. the lower the CT, the higher is the relative amount of vRNA in the sample. actin was detected by mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody (AC-15; 1:5,000) with HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (Invitrogen Life Technologies) Flow cytometry was performed on an LSRII-SORP fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS); data were analyzed using FCS Express, version 3 (De Novo Software, Los Angeles, CA) murine mDCs and pDCs were inoculated with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV. thOV(ML) served as a positive control for IFN secretion. cells were inoculated with MERS-CoV (MOIs as indicated), SARS-CoV, or the indicated positive controls. limits of detection were 12.5 pg/ml for IFN- and 15.6 pg/ml for IFN-. pDCs were inoculated with pDC-stimulating CpG oligonucleotide CpG2216 (41) untreated cells served as mock controls. human pDCs secreted large amounts of IFN-, IFN-, or IFN-. this did not correlate with rates of infection. human cells were inoculated with MERS-CoV (MOIs indicated), SARS-CoV (MOI of 1) or the indicated positive control (CpG 2006, VSV-M2, or CpG 2216) supernatants were sampled at 24 hpi, and secreted IFNs were determined by specific ELISAs. growth in human APCs (MOI of 0.01) or in human pDCs (MOI of 5) was determined. values are means of three independent experiments; error bars indicated standard deviation. human pDCs were inoculated with UV-inactivated MERS-CoV particles. UV-inactivated MERS-CoV induced secretion of similar amounts of IFN- (50 ng/ml) and IFN- (0.06 ng/ml) but significantly reduced amounts of IFN- (0.08 ng/ml) compared to untreated MERS-CoV. infection was performed in the presence of TLR7 inhibitor (IRS661). infection was performed in the presence of TLR7 inhibitor (IRS661) pDCs were stained with anti-DPP4 antibody and analyzed via flow cytometry. at 24 hpi, cells were stained for viability and analyzed via flow cytometry. the secretion of IFNs was reduced by factors of 11 for IFN- (5 ng/ml versus 55 ng/ml), 35 for IFN- (0.6 ng/ml versus 0.016 ng/ml) and 2.3 for IFN- (60 pg/ml versus 140 pg/ml) these data indicate that the endosomal route is critical for sensing of MERS-CoV infection by human pDCs. total RNA of human pDCs infected with MERS-CoV (MOI of 3) was isolated. amounts of MERS-CoV N RNA was quantified at 1 hpi and 6 hpi. relative amount of N RNA increased from 1 hpi to 6 hpi by 14-fold. cells were lysed at the indicated time points and subjected to analyses. expression of MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein in infected human pDCs. no coV N protein was detected in murine pDCs. innate immune cell subsets produce type I or type III IFNs upon contact with MERS-CoV. murine mDCs, pDCs, or pDCs were inoculated with THOV(ML) to test the cells' reactivity. cells were inoculated with MERS-CoV (MOIs as indicated), SARS-CoV, or the indicated positive controls. cells were inoculated with MERS-CoV (MOIs as indicated), or SARS-CoV, or the indicated positive controls. pDCs were inoculated with VSV-M2 (30), pDCs were inoculated with pDC-stimulating CpG oligonucleotide CpG2006 (41) untreated cells served as mock controls. human pDCs secreted large amounts of IFN-, IFN-, or IFN- (up to 40, 0.3, or 0.1 ng/ml, respectively) on contact with MERS-CoV. ng/ml IFN-, 600 pg/ml IFN-, and 80 pg/ml IFN- were less strong than to MERS-CoV. supernatants were sampled at 24 hpi, and secreted IFNs were determined by specific ELISAs. growth in human APCs (MOI of 0.01) or in human pDCs (MOI of 5) was determined. values are means of three independent experiments; error bars indicated standard deviation. TCID50s/ml was detected in the supernatant (Fig. 2C, panel ii) this indicates only inefficient replication of MERS-CoV in pDCs in our hands even after inoculation at a high MOI. this indicates only inefficient replication of MERS-CoV in our hands. infection was performed in the presence of chloroquine. infection was performed in the presence of TLR7 inhibitor (IRS661) IFNs were sampled at 24 hpi. the secretion of all IFNs was strongly reduced in the presence of RBD protein (1.5 ng/ml versus 150 ng/ml IFN-, 50 pg/ml versus 0.16 ng/ml IFN-), indicating general immune-suppressive properties of the RBD protein. pDCs were stained with anti-DPP4 antibody and analyzed via flow cytometry. pDCs were infected with MERS-CoV (MOI of 1) in the presence of chloroquine. secretion of IFNs was reduced by factors of 11 for IFN- (5 ng/ml versus 55 ng/ml), 35 for IFN- (0.6 ng/ml versus 0.16 ng/ml) and 2.3 for IFN- (60 pg/ml versus 140 pg/ml) onset of viral transcription was monitored by qRT-PCR. total RNA of human pDCs infected with MERS-CoV (MOI of 3) was isolated. relative amount of N RNA increased from 1 hpi to 6 hpi by 14-fold. relative amount of N RNA increased from 1 hpi to 6 hpi by 14-fold. cells were lysed at the indicated time points and subjected to analyses. expression of MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein in infected human pDCs. no coV N protein was detected in murine pDCs at 1 hpi. primary human pDCs produce large amounts of type I and type III IFNs in response to MERS-CoV infection. secretion of IFNs was exclusively found in pDCs (25), but the amounts of IFNs induced by MERS-CoV were significantly higher. chloroquine is an inhibitor of endosomal maturation and can inhibit IFN production induced by viruses (e.g., HIV) via PRRs within the endosome (46). the pattern of IFN- secretion by human pDCs after MERS-CoV inoculation followed that of IFN-, as expected. transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) has been shown to be responsible for cleavage during MERS-CoV entry into Calu-3 cells (49). lysosomal proteases such as cathepsin L are required to activate the MERS-CoV S protein (50), but their activity depends on endosomal maturation (51) a model explaining the mechanism how of MERS-CoV induces type I IFN in human pDCs may be proposed. a model explaining the mechanism how of MERS-CoV induces type I IFN in human pDCs may be proposed. this absence of significant MERS-CoV replication in pDCs is explained by the significant (biological and functional) differences between pDCs and other DC subsets. the figure schematically depicts the life cycle of MERS-CoV in human pDCs. the release of type I and III IFNs may protect against MERS-CoV-induced pathogenicity. it is counterintuitive that MERS-CoV induces significantly higher secretion of IFNs than SARS-CoV when infecting pDCs. but clinically recorded MERS patients having a worse prognosis than SARS patients. enhanced IFN type I secretion upon MERS-CoV infection compared to SARS-CoV infection might hint at overshooting immune reactions."}
