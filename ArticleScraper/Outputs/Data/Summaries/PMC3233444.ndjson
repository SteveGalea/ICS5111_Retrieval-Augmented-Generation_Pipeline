{"summary": "novel sequencing techniques, referred to as \u201cnext-generation\u201d sequencing (NGS), provide high speed and throughput that can produce an enormous volume of sequences. the most important advantage provided by these platforms is the determination of the sequence data from single DNA fragments of a library that are segregated in chips. synthesis for 454 pyrosequencing, Illumina GA, Ion Torrent PGM and Heliscope provide data suitable for de novo assembly and the relative long length of 454 FLX (and its smaller version GS Junior) reads allows deep sequencing of amplicons, with applications in microbial and viral metagenomics and analysis of viral quasispecies. s, phasing, nucleotide labeling, signal degradation, mixed beads, low coverage of AT rich regions Helicos 21,000\u201335,000 35 102 Non amplifiable samples Polymerase employed, molecule loss, low intensities Ion Torrent PGM 1,000 200 3 102 De novo genome sequencing and resequencing. the human population is exposed to an increasing burden of infectious diseases caused by the emergence of new previously unrecognized viruses. several clinical syndromes are suspected to be of viral etiology, but the causing agent cannot be recognized by traditional culture and molecular methods. traditional cloning and sequencing methods can be relatively simple and sensitive for the discovery of new viruses when used for the analysis of otherwise sterile samples. microarray-based diagnostic assays have also been used to characterize previously unknown viruses, such as SARS-CoVs [17], but require information on the genome of the virus. high throughput NGS techniques offer the advantage of higher sensitivity and the potential to detect the full spectrum of viruses, including unknown and unexpected viruses. unbiased high-throughput sequencing using 454 pyrosequencing for the direct diagnosis of viral infections in clinical specimens has been used in different diagnostic settings. the 454 system was implemented into a virus discovery assay based on an improved version of the VIDISCA protocol. the association of NGS techniques with rolling circle amplification (RCA), another method for virus discovery, could greatly increase its performance. the Illumina GA platform allowed to identify influenza A viruses from swab specimens and de novo assembly of its genome. it also led to the detection of viral pathogens in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from patients with acute lower respiratory tract infections. an approach of virus discovery was developed and applied to the analysis of contigs assembled from published small RNA libraries. five previously undescribed viruses from cultured Drosophila cells and adult mosquitoes were discovered. this strategy for virus discovery based on deep sequencing of small RNAs has been successfully used in plant virology. RNA was purified from MCC samples and analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing. digital transcriptome subtraction of all human sequences led to the detection of a fusion transcript between a human receptor tyrosine phosphatase and a Large T antigen sequence related to murine polyomaviruses. high throughput 454 pyrosequencing of amplicons generated by consensus PCR of a conserved region of viral genome was used to detect and genotype HPV in cervical cytology specimens. a similar approach was used to detect and genotype cutaneous HPV types in a large series of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and other skin lesions. a new method was developed for recovering sites of integrated DNA based on the bacterial transposase MuA. the transposase is used to introduce adaptors into genomic DNA. this method could avoid bias associated with restriction enzymes and recovered integration sites in a near random fashion. no conserved ubiquitous viral sequences are available for broad amplification of viral genomes. no conserved ubiquitous viral sequences are available for broad amplification of viral genomes. viral metagenomics analyses have been applied so far in environmental samples like fresh water, reused wastewater, and ocean water. the study of the human virome includes also the description of viral communities in human body and their relationship with health and disease. characterization of fecal viromes (mainly phages) and their relations with bacterial metagenome [72] and the characterization of the virome in the skin of healthy individuals [28] nucleic acids can be depleted by depletion of host nucleic acids by probing total RNA with labeled host nucleic acid. other approaches could be enrichment of dsRNA virus genomes or circular dsDNA viral genomes by RCA [28,29]. the most relevant application of NGS in HIV diagnostics is the detection of anti-viral drug resistant minor variants. the most relevant application of NGS in diagnostics is the detection of anti-viral drug resistant minor variants. human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), which establishes lifelong latent infections in humans, may reactivate and cause severe life-threatening disease in immunocompromised patients. high intra-host variability of HCMV genome was demonstrated in lung transplant recipients by deep sequencing of three variable HCMV genes. deep sequencing showed also variability of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) genome and allowed to demonstrate virulence genes. a frameshift mutation in the UL13 kinase could account for decreased neurovirulence of strain F. a major limitation of direct PCR sequencing is its inability to detect drug-resistant variants present in less than 20\u201325% of the heterogeneous virus population existing in a patient\u2019s plasma sample. data analysis issues discussed in section 2.9. several studies that employed 454 pyrosequencing demonstrated accuracy in detecting all drug-resistance mutations identified by population sequencing. several studies demonstrated that drug-resistance mutations detected by 454 had a significant impact on virological failure. detection of minority variants is lower than phenotypic assay (about 10\u201320%) and this represents a problem, since the proportion of CXCR4-tropic variants before initiation of therapy is generally very low. deep sequencing based on the 454 technology has been used in several studies to determine viral tropism. high throughput sequencing is being used to investigate the epidemiology of viral infections and viral evolution, addressing issues such as viral superinfection. deep sequencing was used to analyze lots of oral poliovirus vaccine and the detected neurovirulence mutations were identical to the mutation detected with the standard method based on PCR and restriction enzyme cleavage. the bioinformatics analysis and issues concerning sequencing output should not be neglected when dealing with NGS data. the main issue to be aware of is the homopolymer length due to signal thresholding of the incorporated nucleotides. a cluster of reads presenting the same mutation represents a haplotype and the size of the cluster is the haplotype frequency. global haplotypes are more difficult to be identified, since the reads must be assembled in larger contigs. the advantage of 454 platform for haplotype reconstruction studies is evident. techniques are poorly sensitive and time-consuming, and therefore are unsuitable for large scale analysis. traditional cloning and sequencing methods can be relatively simple and sensitive for the discovery of new viruses when used for the analysis of otherwise sterile samples. traditional cloning and sequencing methods can be relatively simple and sensitive for the discovery of new viruses when used for the analysis of otherwise sterile samples. RNA was purified from blood, cerebrospinal fluid and tissue specimens from transplant recipients. after digestion with DNase to eliminate human DNA, RNA was reverse-transcribed and amplified with random primers. a similar strategy has been used in different diagnostic settings. RCA uses the PhiX29 polymerase to selectively amplify small double stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecules. it is used to amplify circular genomes of DNA viruses and bacteria plasmids. RCA led to the identification and whole genome sequencing of novel human papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses. the feasibility of detecting arthropod-borne viruses was explored in aedes aegypti mosquitoes experimentally infected with dengue virus. total RNA was purified from mosquito pools, reverse-transcribed using random primers and subjected to 454 pyrosequencing. this led to the correct identification of infected mosquitoes. gastrointestinal tissue obtained from bats was analyzed by coronavirus consensus PCR and unbiased high-throughput pyrosequencing that revealed the presence of sequences of a new coronavirus, related to those of SARS-CoV. computational subtraction analysis of data obtained using conventional shotgun sequencing methods has been used to identify viral sequences. this approach has been used for the discovery of a new polyomavirus associated with most cases of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) characterization of a previously unknown polyomavirus that was called Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) the presence of the virus in 80% MCC tissues but only in about 10% of control tissues from various body sites, including the skin, strongly suggested the etiological role of the virus in the pathogenesis of MCC. the use of viral vectors that integrate in host genome may cause malignant transformation due to activation of host proto-oncogenes or inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes. the use of viral vectors that integrate in host genome for gene transfer may cause malignant transformation due to activation of host proto-oncogenes. the human microbiome is the entire population of microbes (i.e., bacteria, fungi, and viruses) that colonize the human body. metagenomics refers to culture-independent studies of the collective set of genomes of mixed microbial communities. metagenomic approaches could be used for systematic analysis of samples collected from patients with unexplained illness. applications of high throughput NGS methods in viral metagenomics can greatly enhance the chances to identify viruses in clinical samples. a simple shotgun sequencing DNA library results in a huge amount of host specific instead of a comprehensive representation of the viral sequences. the length of reads might be too short to allow de novo assembly of viral genomes and methods that provide longer reads, like 454 and Illumina technology, might be preferable. the use of deep sequencing data for mutation analysis in viral genomes has required the development of computational methods for estimation of the quality of sequences and for error correction. the use of deep sequencing data for mutation analysis in viral genomes has required the development of computational methods for estimation of the quality of sequences and for error correction. analysis of full-length viral genome and quasispecies applied to other RNA viruses. nucleotide heterogeneity on hemagglutinin as quasispecies. amino acid changes on antigenic sites could be relevant for antigenic drift. deep sequencing of long range, overlapping amplicons covering the entire HCMV genome. arbitrary criteria were used to estimate experimental error rate. deep sequencing showed variability of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) genome. a major limitation of direct PCR sequencing is its inability to detect drug-resistant variants present in less than 20\u201325% of the heterogeneous virus population. minor drug-resistant variants that are not detected by population-based sequencing are clinically relevant in that they are often responsible for the virological failure of a new antiretroviral treatment regimen. resistance mutations to integrase inhibitors occur in the integrase gene. these mutations were detected by deep sequencing at very low levels if at all prior to initiating therapy. resistance to integrase inhibitors, like maraviroc, occur by outgrowth of CXCR4-tropic HIV variants. deep sequencing of relatively long reads allows defining the contribution of multiple mutations in a single viral genome. this information could improve the performance of interpretation algorithms as compared with population sequencing. deep sequencing based on the 454 technology has been applied for the detection of rare HBV drug resistance mutations. high throughput deep sequencing methods have been proposed as tools for monitoring genetic consistency of live viral vaccines. deep sequencing was used to analyze lots of oral poliovirus vaccines. the detected neurovirulence mutations were identical to the mutation detected with the standard method based on PCR and restriction enzyme cleavage. a cluster of reads presenting the same mutation represents a haplotype. a cluster of reads presenting the same mutation represents a haplotype and the size of the cluster is the haplotype frequency. a cluster of reads presenting the same mutations represents a haplotype and the size of the cluster is the haplotype frequency. amplicon analysis present limitations or drawbacks [137] which require custom made scripting and in-house resolution of bioinformatics problems caused by specific needs. the direct consequence is that data analysis can be no more sustained by the wet-lab researcher alone, but requires the acquisition of computer skills and bioinformatics expertise."}
