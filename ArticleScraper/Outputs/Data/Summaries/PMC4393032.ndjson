{"summary": "the effect of heat stress on mammary epithelial cell (MEC) could be one of the prime factors responsible for lower milk production in animals. qPCR is a common tool to determine the expression level of any target gene. mammary epithelial cells are responsible for converting most precursors into milk constituents and transporting them to the mammary lumen. changes in their genes expression could provide an insight of the mammary gland mechanism. a total of 16 known reference genes were evaluated as reference genes. cytokine transporter ACTB -actin Cytoplasm Cytoskeletal structural protein, nucleotide, and ATP binding B2M Beta 2-microglobulin Golgi membrane, plasma membrane, early endosome membrane, extracellular region Cytoskeletal protein, immune response, protein binding EEF1A1 Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 Cytoplasm Translation elongation factor activity GAPDH Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate de five grams of tissue washed with PBS (Ca2+-, Mg2+-free) (Hyclone) for several times until the solution was pellucid and without milk. the smaller pieces of tissue were transferred to collagen-coated cell culture dishes (Corning, USA) the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 30 m to stabilize the culture. after completion of 1 h, the cells were allowed to recover at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 and harvested at different time intervals. the samples from control plates were also harvested at same time points corresponding to the treated plates. ng RNA, 1 L dT12\u201318 (Invitrogen Corp., CA), 1 L 10 mmol/L dNTP mix. mixture was incubated at 65\u00b0C for 5 min and kept on ice for 3 min. reaction was performed in an Eppendorf Gradient cycler using the program. primers were either selected from the literature or designed using Primer Express 3.0 software. gene name, GenBank accession numbers, primer sequences, annealing temperature (Ta), amplicon length, and PCR efficiency for the studied genes. genes Accession number Primers 5\u2032-3\u2032 (forward, reverse) T a. real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) qPCR reaction was performed using lightCycler 480 instrument (Roche, Germany) each reaction was comprised of 4 L diluted cDNA combined with 6 L of a mixture composed of 5 L 2X LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I master mix (Roche, Germany). qPCR expression data for each reference gene was extracted in form of crossing points. geneNorm [10], NormFinder [34], and Bestkeeper [35] evaluated expression stability. bestkeeper is based on pairwise comparisons of raw cycle threshold values of each gene. five grams of tissue washed with PBS (Ca2+-, Mg2+-free) (Hyclone) for several times until the solution was pellucid and without milk. the smaller pieces of tissue were transferred to collagen-coated cell culture dishes containing DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (PAA) cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 30 m to stabilize the culture. after completion of 1 h, the cells were allowed to recover at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 and harvested at different time intervals. cells were transferred to chilled Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Corp., CA) and stored at 80\u00b0C until RNA extraction. the mixture was incubated at 65\u00b0C for 5 min and kept on ice for 3 min. cDNA was then diluted 1 : 4 (v : v) with DNase-/RNase-free water. primers were either selected from literature or designed using Primer Express 3.0 software.

SD) for each gene analyzed through NormFinder revealed the stability order. the best correlation was observed for RPS9 (r = 0.983) and RPS23 (r = 0.840) followed by EEF1A1, RPL4, HMBS, and UXT. the best correlation was observed for RPS9 (r = 0.983) and RPS23 (r = 0.840) GM [CP]: geometric mean of cycling point; AM [CP]: arithmetic mean of CP; min [x-fold] and max [x-fold]: extreme values of expression levels expressed as absolute x-fold over or under coefficient. SD [x-fold]: standard deviation of the absolute regulation coefficients. the three different algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper) employed in the present study to identify best suitable reference genes lead to cumulative result. the three different algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper) employed in the present study to identify best suitable reference genes lead to cumulative result. the genes were ranked from the most stable to the least stable(highest M value): RPL4, EEF1A1 > RPS23 > GTP > UXT > RPS9 > RPS15A > HMBS > B2M > HPRT1 > UBC > RPS18 > GAPDH > A2M.
