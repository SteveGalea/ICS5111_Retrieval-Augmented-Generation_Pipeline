{"summary": "the study clinical symptoms and signs developed in the 193 healthcare workers working at the emergency department of NTUH from March 30 to June 30. two IFA methods (in-house and EUROIMMUN) for detecting IgG, IgM, and IgA, and a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were performed on serum specimens from all of these workers. control sera used 200 paired samples from patients with community-acquired pneumonia seen at NTUH from October 2001 to December 2002. 70 serum samples from hospitalized patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome treated in 2002. 10 serum samples from 10 pregnant women during routine pre-labor check-ups in 2002. 1%, 6/193) of these 13 patients met criteria for severe SARS caused by pneumonia, positive RT-PCR results for respiratory specimens and serum samples (5 patients), and positive antibody responses. two of the three physicians had positive results for both IgM and IgG, although they both had only transient fever (38\u00b0C for 1 day) and chills without any respiratory illness (rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, or diarrhea) a denotes the changes in IgG for two patients with mild SARS and one asymptomatic worker with SARS-CoV infection. the date of illness onset for patient C was assumed to be May 12, 2003. all but one of the 180 workers who were not admitted had negative ELISA and IFA test results. patients with mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV infection in this study had lower levels of IgG antibody and earlier seroconversion than those of patients with severe SARS. this finding partly supports the hypothesis that an upsurge of antibody response is associated with increased severity of pulmonary condition. disease requires meticulous preparation and vigilance by every worker in the emergency department."}
