{"summary": "smallpox, an acute human viral disease caused by variola virus, was one of the most devastating viral diseases known to have affected mankind and human ecology. the prevalence of smallpox around the previous turn of the 19th century was about 50 million people per year and the disease had a case\u2013fatality rate of approximately 30%. the prevalence of smallpox was reduced to 10 million people by the year 1967. in 1967, MARV was first identified in patients with a severe febrile syndrome, with signs of haemorrhage and shock. in 1976, EBOV was discovered as a second member of the family. in contrast to MARV, five subtypes of EBOV have been described. a summary of all filovirus outbreaks known to date is provided in Table 1 and Figure 1 depicts the locations in Africa from where filovirus outbreaks were reported. a summary of all filovirus outbreaks known to date is provided in Table 1 and Figure 1 depicts the locations in Africa. EBOV outbreaks are flagged in red and MARV in blue. cases of REBOV clearly illustrated that filoviruses could readily be imported into previously unaffected areas by means of international animal transports. a high percentage of children were infected, and the estimated incubation time was shorter with an even higher case\u2013fatality rate of up to 92%. these observations together with the increase in filovirus outbreaks in the last 15 years, point at a seemingly changing epidemiology. SARS\u2013corona virus emerged in 2003 as the cause of a fatal respiratory syndrome. the R0 for SARS was determined to be between 2 and 4 in community-based settings. the rapid spread of pandemic influenza in 1918 is more likely the result of a short generation time of influenza virus in humans. zoonotic infections with an R0 1 may adapt to the host population, resulting in an R0 >1. it is important to realize that when appropriate control measures are not activated, zoonotic infections with an R0 1 may adapt to the host population. the REBOV outbreak and experimental infections carried out with ZEBOV have raised concerns that EBOV may be naturally transmitted by aerosol. however, the primary mode of transmission is through direct or indirect contact with an infected body and thus transmission of filoviruses is an inefficient process. a filovirus may reach any place in the world within days through modern transportation. the actions to be implemented in an outbreak response plan include: (i) direct notification of a suspected case to the authorities, (ii) intensify surveillance to identify cases as early as possible, (iii) active listing, tracing and follow-up of contact cases, (iv) patient isolation and barrier nursing, (iv) inactivation of virus on contaminated materials with sodium hypochlorite and incineration of clinical waste, (viii) funerals to be performed by specialized teams. isolates from the same outbreak are almost identical in nucleotide sequences. viruses recovered from different outbreaks may vary up to 20%, the majority of the mutations being silent. genetic stability observed during the outbreak indicates that the outbreak was probably caused by a single introduction of the virus by one index case. RNA of ZEBOV was detected in rodents and shrews captured in the central African Republic. RNA of ZEBOV was detected in rodents and shrews captured in the central African Republic. RNA of ZEBOV was detected in rodents and shrews captured in the central African Republic. three species of fruit bats caught near the Gabon\u2013Congo border harboured RNA sequences of ZEBOV. the sequences recovered cluster with strains found during human outbreaks. it is not completely clear how humans and non-human primates may become infected by bats. epidemiological studies have suggested that EBOV has spread as a one-dimensional wave. this has prompted some scientists to propose that rivers pose a barrier to the spread of filoviruses rendering both birds and bats unlikely candidate reservoirs. this theory has been disputed by others. the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation might be crucial in the cascade of haemorrhagic complications produced by filovirus infections. the role of antibodies in protection and recovery of the host from a filovirus infection is controversial. the role of antibodies in protection and recovery of the host from a filovirus infection is controversial. different vaccine platforms have been investigated. several vaccines have failed to induce protective immunity in non-human primates. it remains unclear why inactivated vaccines or vectored vaccines failed to induce neutralizing antibody responses. despite numerous hypotheses on this theme, little is known about the animal reservoir for EBOV and MARV. it is unclear what role vectors play, if any, in the transmission cycle of filovirus infections. studies using viruses pseudotyped with different filovirus glycoproteins will help elucidate the role of several regions in virulence and pathogenesis. the emergence and re-emergence in the last few decades of a whole range of infectious diseases. emergence of HIV, SARS and avian influenza in humans are striking examples of this increasing trend. the lack of adequate laboratory facilities and integrated disease surveillance systems will largely prevent these regions from being monitored for disease trends and initiate the required actions. the international scientific and health communities must assist countries involved in building the appropriate infrastructure that will allow early detection of filovirus outbreaks and spark off an adequate and rapid response. contained preventing any secondary cases (Timen et al, 2008).
