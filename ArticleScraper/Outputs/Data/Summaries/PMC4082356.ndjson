{"summary": "phylogeny has become so popular that it's being used in almost every branch of biology. phylogeny is used to describe relationships between paralogues in a gene family. molecular phylogenetics is a tree containing vertices that are connected by branches. each branch represents the persistence of a genetic lineage through time. each vertex represents the birth of a new lineage. the method consists of searching the database for genes and pathways present in an organism and downloading the corresponding set of chemical reactions. the algorithm filters isosenzymes, or other repeated reactions, and may add missing reactions to a given pathway using a probabilistic criterion. the method described can, in principle, be used with any set of metabolic models given that the compound names in the models follow the same standard. a metabolic model comprises a set of chemical reactions. each chemical reaction associates a set of substrates with a set of products. the chemical reactions in the model will define the links of the network. we can consider the degree of vi when we restrict ourselves to the subnetwork generated by the node in (VAVB) we can also define and degBA(vi) with respect to the total number of connections of vi. this weighting of pAB,i with the inverse of deg(vi) will reduce the importance of very connected metabolites. the factor gives an average of the number of connections of the metabolites only present in A with respect to the whole network. this is done in order to normalize the parameter after the inverse weighting done by the factor deg(vi) for each metabolite in the set. in Table 1, we show the number of elements in each one of the three sets of the partition. pyruvate (PYR), glyoxylate (GXL) and 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-6-phospho-D-gluconate (6PDG) are very, medium, and poorly connected metabolites present in these three organisms. column i shows the contribution of these metabolites to the parameters. the comparison between the networks A and B is defined as: the parameters and are balanced since some organisms have much smaller metabolic networks than others. if this is not corrected, it results in a disproportionate size between subnetworks generated by VAB and VBA. the phylogenetic tree of the organisms represented by the models is generated using a binary tree. we are going to remove edges from following this order. the phylogenetic tree is generated taking into account how we divide. ices represents one of the two connected components of the network. if we are in case (a), one of the vertices represents the vertex A0. the other vertex, v2, represents the connected component of that contains. this procedure is repeated again with v1 and v2. the vertices in the phylogenetic tree can keep more information concerning the aforementioned minimum spanning tree. the vertices in the phylogenetic tree can keep more information concerning the aforementioned minimum spanning tree. we place the root of our phylogenetic tree at height y = w(e\u20321) now, two vertex are hanged from the root. if one is associated with a single vertex, for example, v1 in case (a) then we place this vertex at height y = 0.. after removing e\u20322, one of these connected components is split again into two smaller connected components. 38 organisms tree Mycoplasma genitalium (mge), Mycoplasma pneumoniae 309 (mpm), Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (syn), Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 (syf), Clostridium beijerinckii (cbe), burkhoderia cenocepacia J2315 (bcj), Escherichia coli K-12 MG16 in the first tree, the only organism displaced in relation to what is expected from standard methods of phylogenetic tree reconstruction is the tma. in both trees, mge diverges from other organisms at the beginning of the tree. this happens because of their minimalistic genomes, with only a couple hundred metabolites in their metabolomes. the present approach only considers genes (and proteins) associated with metabolic reactions and moreover, considers only the existence/absence of the enzymes (reactions) it was not our intention to build trees that would address properly minimal organisms' phylogenies, but to prove the feasibility of building trees using only reactome data. the results are shown in Tables 5 through 8.
