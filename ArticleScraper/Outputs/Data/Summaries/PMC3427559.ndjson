{"summary": "new species of human virus are still being identified, at a rate of three or four per year. viruses make up over two-thirds of all new human pathogens [2], a highly significant over-representation given that most human pathogen species are bacteria, fungi or helminths. this shift can occur rapidly, over time scales of decades, years or even months. a study of currently recognized \u2018species\u2019 is a natural starting point for attempts to characterize and interpret patterns of virus diversity. the list of viruses was updated if a new species that can infect humans had been described in the literature and also recognized by the ICTV. the year of discovery was taken to be the year of publication of the first report of human infection. as with all discovery curves, our curve reflects a number of different factors, including: (i) the technology available for detecting viruses; (ii) the effort invested in detecting new viruses; (iii) the \u2018visibility\u2019 of different virus species, e.g. as a function of how common they are and the nature of any disease caused. the only notable trend in the last 15 years has been a higher rate of discovery in australasia. the most notable trend is that only a single new pox virus has been discovered since 1972 (compared with 10 up to that date). x = xi, the number of viruses discovered over years 1 to k, is given by 2.2. we compared the model with the observed data by calculating the mean, trend in the mean and variance for the number of virus species discovered per year. the model reproduces the observed data well: observed mean and variance 3.37 and 3.35; fitted mean and variance 3.36 and 3.41, respectively. virus name family human bocavirus Parvoviridae parvovirus 4 Parvoviridae KI polyomavirus Polyomaviridae Melaka virus Reoviridae WU polyomavirus Polyomaviridae astrovirus MLB1 Astroviridae Bundibugyo ebolavirus Filoviridae human bocavirus 2 Parvoviridae human cosaviruses A-D Picornavirid the list of families containing human viruses may not yet be complete. we obtained a list of 219 ICTV-recognized virus species. 23 virus families were represented by species in this list.

here, a virus. level 4 represents the subset of viruses that are sufficiently transmissible between humans to cause major outbreaks. this equates with the epidemiological condition R0 > 1 [33], i.e. a single primary case generates, on average, more than one secondary case. from previous reviews of the literature, it is possible to put approximate numbers of virus species at each level of the pyramid. drivers of emergence Several reviews have listed so-called \u2018drivers\u2019 of the emergence of novel viruses or other pathogens. many drivers have only indirect effects on emergence (e.g. climate change), and often an emergence event has multiple causes (good examples would be the emergence of Nipah virus or SARS coronavirus). one recent study suggested that it increased during the first decade of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, but has decreased thereafter [9]. a slightly different way of thinking about drivers of emergence is to draw an analogy between emerging pathogens and weeds. this idea would imply that emerging pathogens possess different life-history characteristics to established, long-term endemic pathogens. most recently emerging pathogens are viruses rather than bacteria, fungi, protozoa or helmin an illustrative case study is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) 88 human virus species were identified for which at least one cell receptor has been identified. this is only 40 per cent of the species of interest, but 21 of 23 families were represented. two of the proteins were not entered in the UniProt database [40] on the basis of a previously published study of virus host ranges [26]. we determined whether the cell receptor protein was \u2018conserved\u2019 by quantifying the amino acid sequence homology between humans and mice. the most striking feature of the plot is that there are no examples of human viruses with broad host ranges that do not use highly conserved cell receptors. more than two-thirds of human virus species are zoonotic, i.e. they are capable of infecting vertebrate hosts other than Homo sapiens (disregarding invertebrate vectors) by far the most important non-human host taxa are other mammals, with rodents and ungulates most commonly identified as alternative hosts. pathogen pyramid is a useful conceptual framework for thinking about the emergence of novel viruses. each level represents a different degree of interaction between pathogens and humans. level 1 represents the exposure of humans to a novel pathogen;
