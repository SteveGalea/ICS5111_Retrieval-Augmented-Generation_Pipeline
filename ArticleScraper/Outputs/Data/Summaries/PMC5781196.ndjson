{"summary": "severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of the most severe primary immunodeficiencies. Depending on the genetic defect, B lymphocytes and natural killer cells may be present or absent. this feature constitutes the basis for the classical division into TB + SCID and TBSCID. a 15month-old girl was referred to the university hospital due to persistent fever and interstitial pneumonitis. she was the first child of young, nonconsanguineous parents born from the first pregnancy which was terminated in the 39th week of gestation using Cesarian section surgery. despite intensive pharmacotherapy with antibiotics, trimethoprime/sulfamethoxazole, acyclovir and antifungal agents, rapid deterioration of the child\u2019s clinical state and exacerbation of respiratory insufficiency accompanied by progression in radiological features of the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) a 15-month-old child with severe combined immunodeficiency and respiratory distress syndrome due to coronavirus HKU1 infection died because of multiorgan failure. Intensive therapy and mechanical ventilation conducted in the department of pediatric anesthesiology and Intensive Care did not contribute to clinical or radiological improvement. coronavirus respiratory infections have not been described in children with genetically determined immunodeficiencies thus far. this is the first report of a documented HCoVHKU1 related pneumonia with the RDS in a child with SCID. radiol Clin North Am 2011; 49:895\u2013920.
