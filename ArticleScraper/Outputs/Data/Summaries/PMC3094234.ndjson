{"summary": "bronchiolitis is the most common form of acute lower respiratory infections during infancy. compared with non-Indigenous Australian infants, Indigenous infants have greater bacterial density in their upper airways and more severe bronchiolitis episodes. thromycin in Indigenous infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis is designed to determine whether it can reduce short-term morbidity from respiratory illness. if azithromycin is efficacious in reducing the morbidity of Indigenous infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis, the intervention would lead to improved short term (and possibly long-term) health benefits. bronchiolitis is the most common acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) in infants. bronchiolitis is a clinical diagnosis characterised by tachypnoea, wheeze and/or crepitations in infants following a preceding upper respiratory illness. bronchiolitis is a clinical diagnosis characterised by tachypnoea, wheeze and/or crepitations in infants following a preceding upper respiratory illness. new treatable bacteria such as Simkania negevensis (a Chlamydia-like microbe) has been found indigenous infants have colonised nasopharynx very early in life. colonisation is dense with common respiratory bacterial pathogens, notably Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus infleunzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. a small Turkish study of 21 hospitalised infants with moderate to severe bronchiolitis reported contradictory results. 3-weeks of daily clarithromycin significantly reduced severity of illness and risk of hospital readmission for respiratory illness during the next 6 months. azithromycin will improve clinical outcomes of Indigenous infants hospitalised with bronchiolitis. primary research question is: does azithromycin (compared to placebo) improve clinical outcomes of Indigenous infants with bronchiolitis. admission into intensive care, macrolide therapy contraindicated (e.g. liver dysfunction, hypersensitivity), presence of diarrhoea (stools of increased watery consistency and more than two stools above usual stooling frequency), or clinical and radiological features consistent with a primary diagnosis of pneumonia. all infants are managed according to a standardised protocol. randomisation, allocation and blinding The randomisation sequence was computer generated and used permutated blocks (4 or 6 participants per block) an infant is assigned to the next number on the appropriate stratified list. treatment groups are stratified by age (6 or >6 months), site (Darwin or Townsville) and requirement for oxygen at point of randomisation. a single nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimen for respiratory virus and other potentially important respiratory pathogen (M. pneumoniae, Chlamydia spp) testing is collected from each subject at enrolment. the results of routine investigations (full blood count and chest radiographic findings) are recorded. four isolates each of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae per positive swab are tested for anti-microbial resistance. two isolates of M. catarrhalis per positive swab are tested for anti-microbial resistance. mono-specific PCR and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) method will be used to detect Mycoplasma pneumoniae, coronaviruses, bocavirus and human metapneumovirus. multiplex PCR and RT-PCR were used to detect adenovirus, parainfluenza (1, 2 3), influenza (A and B) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) we will also analyse all clinical outcomes in the following pre-determined sub-groups: (i) age 6-months; (ii) presence of bacterial respiratory pathogens that are resistant to macrolide antibiotics. we plan to enrol 200 Indigenous infants. children will be analysed according to allocation status (regardless of subsequent management) an interim analysis is planned and the data safety and monitoring committee will determine if the study should be ceased. primary outcomes will be compared between infants receiving placebo or azithromycin using unpaired Student's T-tests or Mann-Whitney tests. spp and M. catarrhalis before and after trial medications will be compared using ORs and 95% CI. Ethical approval The protocol has been granted full ethical approval from the respective Human Research Ethics Committees of all participating institutions. all infants are managed according to a standardised protocol. the protocol outlines when supplementary oxygen is prescribed (Sp0294%) and reduced. infants may receive additional therapies (other than macrolides) at the discretion of the attending paediatrician. a placebo medication ensures that all children, carers, researchers, hospital staff, and clinic staff are blinded to treatment group until analyses of the data. both the azithromycin and placebo are in identical opaque bottles and sealed with an aluminium foil. for both, equal volumes of water are added using a syringe and needle by punching the seal. the presence of cough, wheeze and auscultatory abnormality on clinical review are documented. on day-21, the presence of cough, wheeze and auscultatory abnormality on clinical review are documented. Adverse effects (vomiting, diarrhoea, rash) are also documented. susceptibility (CDS) disc diffusion method, azithromycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) will be determined using Etest (AB Biodisk, Sweden) if the azithromycin disc annulus is less than 6 mm. the ampicillin MIC is determined for isolates if the ampicillin disc annulus is less than 6 mm. swabs are stored in SMGGB at -80\u00b0C before being batch processed for typical respiratory pathogens. batches of swabs are thawed and 10 L aliquots cultured overnight on selective media at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. nucleic acids will be extracted from 0.2 ml of each NPS specimen. mono-specific PCR and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) method will be used to detect Mycoplasma pneumoniae, coronaviruses, bocavirus and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) the day-21 outcomes are: presence of cough, wheeze, abnormal auscultatory chest signs and suppurative otitis media. we will also analyse all clinical outcomes in the following pre-determined sub-groups: (i) age 6-months; and (ii) presence of bacterial respiratory pathogens resistant to macrolide antibiotics. primary outcomes (i) Length of stay (LOS) for respiratory illness in hospital- defined as time from admission to time'ready for discharge' the mean LOS in Indigenous infants with bronchiolitis was 96 (SD 24) hours. for a mean difference of 24-hours in LOS between groups the required sample size is 23 per group. a sample size of at least 100 in each sub-age group is also sufficient for an a-priori subgroup analysis based on age. an interim analysis is planned and the data safety and monitoring committee will determine if the study should be ceased. the primary outcomes (LOS and duration of supplemental oxygen requirement) will be compared between infants receiving placebo or azithromycin using unpaired Student's T-tests or Mann-Whitney tests. bronchiolitis is more severe than bronchiolitis in non-Indigenous infants. there are higher readmission rates and an increased risk of respiratory morbidity in Indigenous infants[7,41] there are no published prospective studies of this illness in Australian Indigenous infants. for the first time in this population, we will determine the nature and diversity of respiratory viruses, mycoplasma, Chlamydia and Chlamydia-like species in association with cases of bronchiolitis requiring hospital admission. the range of organisms includes newly discovered viruses,[44] and treatable bacteria that may contribute to chronic lung dysfunction. our study design minimises the impact of variable presentation by: (a) standardising our inclusion criteria; (b) limiting enrolment to within 24 hours of hospitalisation; (c) adopting a strategy that would theoretically distribute any effect equally between groups. in the event that differences in baseline data between groups are found, we will use statistical methods to adjust as required. authors' contributions AC conceived the study and participated in its design, analysis plan and submission to the NHMRC.
