{"summary": "the highest incidence of MERS-CoV infection occurs in elderly or immunocompromised individuals. the virus is suspected to persist in dromedary camels and cause sporadic zoonotic infections, followed by intrafamilial or health care-related transmission. antibody response induced after vaccination with recombinant MVA-MERS-S. a single subcutaneous (s.c.) immunization with a dose of 107 or 108 PFU of MVA-MERS-S elicited detectable MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies. a low dose of 106 PFU of MVA-MERS-S induced measurable neutralizing antibodies. a single primary intramuscular (i.m.) immunization resulted in MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies with all of the dosages of MVA-MERS-S used. repeated i.m. immunization further increased the levels of MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies to higher titers than those obtained upon s.c. immunization. however, the peak antibody titers elicited by s.c i.m. booster increased the level of MERS-S291-specific T-cell responses. i.m. booster increased the level of MERS-S291-specific T-cell responses about 3-fold. i.m. booster increased the level of MERS-S291-specific T-cell responses. MERS-CoV S-specific CD8+ T cells were stimulated with peptide S291. Peptide SPYAAGYDL (F2L) served for comparative analysis of MVA-specific CD8+ T cells. t test was performed with GraphPad Prism for Windows. BALB/c mice were infected with 7 104 TICD50 of MERS-CoV 45 days after immunization with 106, 107, or 108 PFU of MERS-CoV. number of viral genome copies per nanogram of RNA are shown for groups of animals (n, number of animals per group) immunized by the s.c. route with 106 (n = 5), 107 (n = 2), or 108 (n = 2) PFU of tissue of control mice revealed large areas of densely packed inflammatory cells. inflamed foci were seen mainly around larger bronchi. some bronchi were filled with cellular debris and inflammatory cells. antibody against the spike protein S1 (Abcam catalog no. 100208-RP) was used to monitor transduction. shown are the results of H&E staining (A to D, I) and immunohistochemical analyses for MERS-CoV spike protein (E, F, J) and mCherry (G, H) i.m. immunizations induced nearly equal amounts of MERS-S-specific CD8+ T cells across all of the doses used here and also in prime and prime-boost vaccination schemes. a single subcutaneous (s.c.) immunization with a dose of 107 or 108 PFU of MVA-MERS-S elicited detectable MERS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies. groups of BALB/c mice were immunized s.c. (A) or i.m. (B) with 106, 107, or 108 PFU of MVA-MERS-S, 108 PFU of nonrecombinant MVA (WT), or phosphate-buffered saline (Mock) to monitor antibody responses, we analyzed the MERS-CoV-neutralizing capacity of mouse serum samples taken at days 21 and 40 primary immunizations with MVA-MERS-S elicited CD8+ T cells specific for both MERS-S antigen epitopes S291 (KYYSIIPHSI) and S823 (EYGQFCSKI) primary immunizations with s.c. or i.m. elicited CD8+ T cells specific for both MERS-S antigen epitopes. splenocytes were immunized by single-shot and prime-boost vaccinations. mice were immunized by single-shot and prime-boost vaccinations. spleen cells were harvested at 56 days after prime or prime-boost vaccination. the animals were infected with 7 104 50% tissue culture infective doses (TICD50) of MERS-CoV 45 days after prime-boost immunization. adenoviral vector transduction levels were also monitored by real-time RT-PCR analysis for mCherry RNA. number of viral genome copies per nanogram of RNA is shown for groups of animals (n, number of animals per group) immunized by the s.c. route with 106 (n = 5), 107 (n = 2), or 108 (n = 2) PFU of MVA-MERS-S (MVA-S), nonrecombinant MVA (WT) (n = 1), or phosphate-buffered saline (Mock) (n = 4) mmunized animals showed minimal lesions, mostly mild hyperplasia of the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue, and little positive staining of virus-infected cells in lung tissues. small areas of inflammation resembling those prominently seen in tissues from control mice were also noted. the s.c. and i.m. routes were associated with comparable immune responses, particularly when using the standard dosage of 108 PFU of MVA-MERS-S in prime-boost applications. the results are in good agreement with other data in support of the licensing of MVA as a replacement smallpox vaccine. all immunized mice showed little or no replication of MERS-CoV. no evidence of increased inflammatory response or enhancement of MERS-CoV infection."}
