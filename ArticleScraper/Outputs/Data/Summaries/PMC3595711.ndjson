{"summary": "the ability to determine if an isolated viral outbreak could develop into a pandemic has been facilitated by efficient PCR and sequencing techniques. this determination is based on the early rate of infection, sequence data similarity, and virulence factor molecular markers. the CDC has estimated that the H1N1 pandemic infected between 47 to 81 million individuals. 2009 H1N1 virus was the result of multiple rounds of reassortment that actually combined portions of avian, swine and human influenza viruses. the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was not the only example of influenza spreading across the globe. other outbreaks include the mild, with regards to morbidity, but wide-spread 1964-1965 Hong Kong influenza, as well as the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. the main treatment and control measures implemented for SARS were simply isolation of infected individuals. this included quarantining infected individuals, limiting travel, avoidance of public places, and implementing strict hygiene practices in hospitals. the first line of treatment of the 2009 H1N1 was rather low technology and uninspiring. the first isolated strain of the 2009 H1N1 in the us was detected the week of august 2, 2009. current drug-based therapies may prove ineffective especially if resistant strains recombine with a more severe virus. rapid DNA synthesis may allow for an adaptable response and treatment that can change along with the mutating pathogen. new treatments that harness rapid de novo DNA synthesis may be the only means to combat emergent outbreaks as they arise. the cost of the outbreak ranged from $3 to $10 million per patient [29, 30]. the cost of the outbreak ranged from $3 to $10 million per patient. the estimated death total in the united states for these four scenarios would be 20, 201, 1,000.9, and 2,018.9 (in thousands), respectively. these estimates are multiplied by 2x to 10x if estimating mortality in developing countries. globally, a mild pandemic like the current 2009 H1N1 virus would cost USD $330 billion or 0.8% GDP. emergence of antiviral resistant strains indicates need for rapid targeted treatments. de novo DNA-based therapeutics could be customized to sequences as they are isolated in the field, allowing for adaptability of treatment. new field of synthetic biology has illuminated the possibility of rapidly generating therapeutic agents. the decrease of large-scale de novo DNA synthesis costs. it will also be cost effective to use synthetic DNA-based therapeutics. this is a brute force approach to drug development that could be waste of resources. the advent of de novo nucleic acid synthesis should allow for their rapid, targeted production. a single RNA molecule that would function as a treatment is unlikely. but being able to quickly generate genetic material now allows for the construction of inhibitory RNAs as their intended target mutates in the field. there have been advances using the peptides, for example, HP0245, as a protective peptide vaccine capable of protecting animals against the emerging zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus suis serotype 2 [47] there are still drawbacks to viral vector vaccines that require resolution, such as the possibility of preexisting immunity to the vector, in turn preventing immunization. synthetic biologists have been recoding viral pathogens (poliovirus and Influenza A virus) with synonymous codon-pairs as a means of attenuation. this recoding maintained the amino acid identity at the protein level, yet incorporated over 400 nucleotide level synonymous mutations. this recoding maintained the amino acid identity at the protein level, but incorporated over 400 nucleotide level synonymous mutations, which ultimately altered the genome's translation rate. these include responses that are rapid in nature, that are targeted, and that contain the spread of infection. the implementation of DNA synthesis-based therapeutics and strategies deserve serious consideration as treatments."}
