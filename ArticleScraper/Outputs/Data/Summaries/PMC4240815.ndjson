{"summary": "the release of sTLR2 and sTLR4 was studied in in-vitro stimulations, as well as in-vivo during experimental human endotoxemia. plasma concentrations peaked after 2 hours (sTLR4) and 4 hours (sTLR2) sTLR4 did not correlate with cytokines, but sTLR2 correlated positively with TNF (rs = 0.80, P 0.05), IL-6 (rs = 0.65, P 0.05 sTLR2 had a lower AUC: 0.60 (95% CI 0.54-0.66) [P = 0.0004], while sTLR2 had a lower AUC: 0.60 (95% CI 0.54-0.66) [P = 0.0004] Conclusions sTLRs are released into the circulation."}
