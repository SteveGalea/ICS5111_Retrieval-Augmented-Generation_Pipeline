{"summary": "the human paramyxovirus human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) was found in more than 50% of children under the age of 15 afflicted with pneumonia. at least 30 million children under the age of 5 become infected with hRSV per year, resulting in nearly 200,000 deaths worldwide. cytokines and stimulation of immune cell activation play prominent roles in the early antiviral inflammatory response that can damage pulmonary tissues. identifying the immune components that are required for the initiation and amplification of a cytokine storm is essential for developing therapeutics at various stop points to alleviate pulmonary injury. chemokine receptor CCR1 and its ligand CCL3 have been shown to exacerbate pulmonary injury following PVM infection (23, 24) inflammation was undetectable in mice until day 5 postinfection, at which time activated CD8+ T cells infiltrated into the lung and secreted tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) as well as IFN-. RP-002 (Receptos, La Jolla, CA, USA) was dissolved in sterile water at a concentration of 0.75 mg/ml. six mg/kg of body weight of RP-002 or equivalent volume of sterile water (vehicle) was administered orally 1, 25, and 49 h. tracheas of euthanized mice were exposed, transected, and intubated with a blunt 18-gauge needle. one milliliter of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with Complete Mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail was infused three times, and the fluid was then recovered. anti-CD8 (53-6.72; Bioxcell) antibodies were administered i.p. to mice 1 day before and 1 day after infection. mice perfused with 10 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) single-cell suspensions from the lung were obtained using the MACs tissue dissociator and lung dissociation protocol. NK cells and CD8+ T cells were stained for surface antigen. single-cell suspensions were suspended in culture medium at a concentration of 1 106 to 2 cells per well. intracellular proteins were stained with fluorescently labeled antibodies. intracellular FoxP3 staining was performed as stated above. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a digital LSR II instrument. data were analyzed using the software program FlowJo. an unpaired two-tailed Student t test was calculated using the program Excel. Plaques were visualized by immunostaining with rabbit antiserum raised against sucrose-gradient-purified PVM. bound antibodies were detected by incubation with a peroxidase substrate. stock virus titers were quantified by plaque assay using BSC-1 cells in the presence of 0.001% of -chymotrypsin. RP-002 was dissolved in sterile water at a concentration of 0.75 mg/ml. six mg/kg of body weight of RP-002 or equivalent volume of sterile water (vehicle) was administered orally 1, 25, and 49 h. tracheas of euthanized mice were exposed, transected, and intubated with a blunt 18-gauge needle. one milliliter of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with Complete Mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail was infused three times. anti-NK1.1 (PK136; Bioxcell) and/or 500 g of anti-CD8 (53-6.72; Bioxcell) antibodies were administered i.p. to mice 1 day before and 1 day after infection. mice perfused with 10 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) cells were washed twice with 200 l FACS buffer, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, washed again once with FACS buffer, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. NK cells and CD8+ T cells were stained for surface antigen, fixed, permeabilized with 2% saponin, and stained for intracellular proteins. staining was performed directly ex vivo in the absence of stimulation or incubation with brefeldin A. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a digital LSR II instrument. data were analyzed using the software program FlowJo. an unpaired two-tailed Student t test was calculated using the program Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA), when appropriate, to determine significance. a P value of 0.05 (95% confidence level) was deemed significant. the cytokines evaluated were CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-, IFN-, and IFN-. all except TNF- were at background levels until day 5 after infection. cytokine produced at the highest concentration at any time point was IFN-. innate immune cell recruitment was inhibited by anti-TNF- and/or anti-IFN- antibody administration. numbers of innate immune cells expressing activation molecules CD69 (Fig. 1G) were significantly reduced when TNF- and/or IFN- was neutralized. secretion of TNF- and IFN- is required and essential to commence the cytokine storm. the limit of detection was 1.7 log10 PFU per g of tissue. cytokines secreted into the BALF from infected mice. activated NK cells and CD8+ T cells produced TNF- and IFN- within the lungs on day 5 after infection. CD8+ T cell depletion abrogates TNF- and IFN- production and blunts the cytokine storm. pulmonary NK cells (D) or CD44+ CD8+ T cells (E) were determined. values within individual dot plots signify the average frequencies SEM. NK cells, CD4+ cells, and CD8+ T cells (E) were measured. depletion of CD8+ T cells significantly decreased the number of innate inflammatory cells. NK cell depletion reduced the recruitment of activated immune cells to a lesser extent than CD8+ T cell depletion alone. depletion of CD4 T cells had minimal effects on type I and II interferon production or morbidity following PVM infection. fewer activated CD44+ CD8+ T cells and CD69+ NK cells were retrieved from the lungs of RP-002-treated mice on day 5 postinfection. fewer activated CD44+ CD8+ T cells and NK cells from RP-002 recipients exhibited significantly diminished frequencies of cells positive for granzyme B. rPVM strain 15 was given orally vehicle or 6 mg/kg of RP-002 1, 25 and 49 h postinfection. mice were euthanized, and BALF as well as lungs were harvested for analysis. MLN were harvested, and single cell suspensions were cultured. numbers within individual panels represent the average frequencies SEM of gated cells positive for their respective activation molecules. bar graphs indicate the averages SEM where applicable. RP-002 treatment of PVM-infected mice significantly inhibited the secretion of TNF- and IFN-. the presence of RP-002 significantly decreased the infiltration of activated CD44+ CD8+ T cells into the lung compared to the values in vehicle recipients. IFN-+ CD8+ T cells from RP-002-treated mice showed increased frequencies of IFN-only producers, reduced percentage of TNF- and TNF-/IL-2-producing cells and fewer cells producing granzyme B. cells were incubated for 5 h and assessed for CD8+ T cell intracellular cytokine production. values for gated populations signify the average frequencies SEM of cells positive for their respective effector molecules. four to seven mice were used per group. S1P1R agonist inhibited CD8+ T cell differentiation and effector molecule generation within the MLN that preceded the diminished CD8+ T cell-mediated inflammation in the lung. last series of experiments tested whether RP-002 treatment would limit immunopathologic injury and promote host survival. uninfected mice given RP-002 infrequently displayed consolidation, and hemorrhage was not found. pulmonary injury and diminished infiltration of inflammatory cells into lungs correlated with significantly less exudate as measured by total protein. RP-002 limited immunopathologic injury within mice. data are representative of 3 independent experiments with 4 to 7 mice per group. mice were removed from the experiment at death or loss of >30% of their initial starting weight. RP-002-treated recipients replenished their lost weight to levels equal to or greater than their initial weight. the immune response was dampened, but administration of RP-002 did not significantly alter titers of PVM in the lungs on days 5 and 8 after infection. TNF- and IFN- are essential for initiating a cytokine storm during PVM infection. VM over the amount inoculated were detectable within the lung at day 3 postinfection. neutralizing antibodies to these cytokines were administered to mice on days 3 and 4 postinfection. blockade of TNF- and/or IFN- significantly inhibited the secretion of IFN- and other cytokines assayed. rPVM strain 15 (1.5 103 PFU) was instilled i.n. in C57BL/6 mice. kinetic analysis was performed for CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10, and IL-1. innate immune cells expressing activation markers (Fig. 2B) and effector CD44+ CD8+ T cells (Fig. 2C) were found in significantly greater numbers on day 5 after infection. both activated NK cells and CD8+ T cells produced TNF- and IFN- within the lungs on day 5 after infection. C57BL/6 mice were infected with 1.5 103 PFU of rPVM strain 15 i.n. Kinetic analysis of immune cell recruitment and activation marker expression was performed. antibodies used depleted >98% of NK cells and CD8+ T cells. antibody depletion of NK cells did not significantly reduce the cytokine content. depletion of CD8+ T cells provided the greatest blunting of all cytokines. S1P1R agonist inhibits PVM-induced cytokine storm. TNF-, IFN-, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells contribute to the intensity of the cytokine storm following PVM infection. previously, we demonstrated that the S1P1R agonist RP-002 inhibited production of TNF- and IFN- as well as the recruitment of activated, CD69+ NK cells 1 to 3 days following influenza virus infection (15). analysis of PVM-specific CD8+ T cells within the draining mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) in RP-002-treated mice on day 5 postinfection revealed significantly fewer PVM-specific CD8+ T cells after stimulation with the PVM immunodominant peptide (28) than for mice that received vehicle. further, after stimulation, IFN-+ CD8+ T cells from RP-002 recipients had fewer singly TNF--producing or dually TNF- values for gated populations signify the average frequencies SEM of cells positive for their respective effector molecules. for panels A to F, 4 or 5 mice were used per group. data are representative of 2 to 4 independent experiments. RP-002-treated mice showed increased frequencies of IFN-only producers. decreased percentages of TNF- and TNF-/IL-2-producing cells. fewer cells producing granzyme B. the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of TNF- from TNF-+ CD8+ T cells from RP-002 recipients was significantly lower than that for vehicle-treated mice. only a minor reduction was observed in the neutrophil population. RP-002-treated mice had fewer PVM-specific CD8+ T cells. RP-002 treatment resulted in significantly diminished IFN-, TNF-, IL-2, and granzyme B+ expression compared to results for vehicle-treated mice. lungs from BL/6 mice receiving either vehicle or RP-002 showed frequent consolidation, hemorrhage, destruction of alveolar air space structures, and heavy mononuclear lymphoid cell infiltration. the majority of their alveolar air sac retained normal morphology. pulmonary injury and diminished infiltration of inflammatory cells into lungs correlated with significantly less exudate as measured by total protein (Fig. 5B), LDH enzymatic activity (Fig. 5C) and IgM content in their BALF. RP-002 limited immunopathologic injury within PVM-infected mice. 002-treated mice, 1 mouse at day 11, 2 at day 12, and 1 at day 14. limit of detection was 1.7 log10 PFU per g of tissue. n = 5 mice per group per time point. type I IFNs are produced early during most viral infections. these cytokines stimulate proinflammatory gene expression as well as the secretion of cytokines. this late onset of the cytokine storm was revealed in the mouse model for hRSV, suggesting the need to reevaluate RSV infection in humans. NS1 and NS2 have potent anti-IFN activity (29), and innate inflammatory responses may be inhibited by PVM until day 5 after infection within C57BL/6 mice. deletion of NS2 induced transient, early upregulation of IFN-, IFN-, and CXCL10, which likely contributed to host control of PVM replication as well as enhanced survival. TNF-- and IFN--producing CD44+ CD8+ T cells appeared within the PVM-infected lung on day 5 after infection. accumulation of activated CD44+ CD8+ T cells in the lung coincided with upregulation of cytokine secretion and recruitment. NK cells also acted as an adjuvant to the PVM-induced cytokine storm. production by the innate immune system was essential for the initiation of the cytokine storm. CD8+ T cells are essential for PVM clearance but achieve this by lysing infected cells, thereby causing pulmonary injury. initiation is dependent on the virus-specific CD8+ T cell response. cells inhibited proliferation in response to antigenic challenge, mixed leukocyte reaction, or incubation with monoclonal antibodies against anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. administration of RP-002 may have disrupted the S1P-S1P1R-mediated CD8+ T cell localization within MLN, thereby hampering proliferation. both acute respiratory viral infections were successfully treated by blunting the cytokine storm through use of a specific S1P1R agonist. the mechanism of RP-002 inhibition of the cytokine storm resulted from the blunting of the later adaptive immune response."}
