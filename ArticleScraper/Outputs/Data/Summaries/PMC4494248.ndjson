{"summary": "first-generation smallpox Vaccines Smallpox was eradicated worldwide in the 1970s. serious public health concerns due to the threat of bioterrorism have highlighted the necessity for a vaccinia virus-based smallpox vaccine. existing vaccine stockpiles have not been updated since the 1970s. cfm571 DIs e Minute-pock-forming variant virus passaged in eggs Dairen I Fourth-generation LC16m8 Derived from LC16m8 by deleting the B5R gene LC16m8 NYVAC Attenuated clonal Copenhagen strain. some studies aimed to generate vaccines using a sterile cell culture technique to reduce the risk of contamination by adventitious agents (second-generation vaccines) second-generation vaccines were manufactured using first-generation vaccines or their isolates as seed viruses. their safety profiles were equivalent to those of the original lymph-derived vaccines, i.e., they caused the same adverse events [13,15]. developed countries began to raise concerns about the side effects associated with lymph-derived smallpox vaccines. the DIs strain originates from the Dairen I strain, a smallpox vaccine strain in japan. it was isolated as a small-sized pock forming variant on chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) after 13 passages in one-day-old eggs. LC16m8 forms minute pocks on CAM of embryonated eggs. LC16m8 induced a much weaker dermal reaction in rabbits and humans. LC16m8 was administrated to approximately 100,000 infants without any serious adverse reactions. LC16m8 was adopted as the favored vaccine strain in Japan. LC16m8 should be categorized as a fourth-generation vaccine. it was obtained from the parental smallpox vaccine strain (LC16m8) by deleting the B5R gene, which is responsible for the reversion of LC16m8. however, it retains its ability to replicate in mammalian cells [34] Ikeda Dairen I Lymph-derived Dairen I Second-generation ACAM1000 Clonal virus grown in MRC-5 cells Dryvax ACAM2000 Clonal virus grown in vero cells ACAM1000 Elstree-BN Lister/Elstree lymph-derived virus passaged in MRC-5 cells NYCBH Third-generation LC16m8 c Minute-pock-forming variant virus Lister/Elstree IMVAMUNE (MVA d) cell-cultured smallpox vaccine was also prepared in MRC-5 cells. CCSV was derived from a plaque-purified NYCBH strain. it was widely used as a lymph-derived vaccine in Europe, africa and Asia during the global smallpox eradication campaign. MVA was administered to about 120,000 individuals in western Germany and Turkey during the global eradication campaign. it showed an extremely attenuated phenotype in animals and humans [27]. the need for a smallpox vaccine meant that MVA was examined in a number of clinical trials [29,30,31,32,33] LC16m8 was isolated from the Lister original (LO) strain via intermediate strains. tests showed LC16m8 was markedly less neurovirulent than first-generation vaccine strains. LC16m8 induced a much weaker dermal reaction in rabbits and humans. LC16m8 and B5R Takahashi-Nishimaki et al. first identified the VV B5R gene. LC16m8 harbors a frameshift mutation due to a single base deletion in the middle of its open reading frame. this mutation results in the loss of B5R function. the IEV is transported along microtubules to the cell periphery [53,54], where it adheres to the cell membrane as a cell-associated enveloped virion (EEV) the B5 protein participates in the formation of actin-containing microvilli and the subsequent release of the CEV from the cell surface to form an extracellular enveloped virion. LC16m8 is a multi-clonal event and may occur frequently. the phenotype of LC16m8 (plaque size and dermal reaction in rabbits) was similar to that of LC16m8. genetic stability of LC16m8 was evaluated by serial passage in primary rabbit kidney cells. no detectable LPCs emerged from LC16m8 that was plaque-purified immediately before testing. LC16m8 was plaque-purified immediately before testing. LC16m8 elicited protective immune responses in cynomolgus monkeys. mice immunized with LC16m8 lost weight and, in some cases, died. m8B5R was significantly inferior to LC16m8 when compared at their minimal dose. crosses denote mice that either died or were sacrificed because they lost >30% of their body weight. phenotype of LC16m8 (plaque size and dermal reaction in rabbits) was similar to that of LC16m8. genetic stability of LC16m8 was evaluated by serial passage in primary rabbit kidney cells. LC16m8 was plaque-purified immediately before testing. no detectable LPCs emerged from LC16m8 that was plaque-purified. LC16m8 or Dryvax fully protected mice from lethal infection with WR. mice immunized with LC16m8, m8B5R or m8dTM lost weight. m8B5R was significantly inferior to LC16m8 (t-test, p = 0.005) LC16m8 as a Vehicle for Expressing Foreign Genes VV has been widely used as a vector for expressing foreign genes. concerns about the safety profile of VVs are a major barrier to developing recombinant VV vaccines for use in humans. a recombinant LC16m8 vaccine expressing the SARS-CoV spike protein elicited neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV in rabbits that generated a high titer of anti-LC16m8 antibodies. this suggests that LC16m8 would make a good vector virus for eliciting effective immune responses against foreign antigens in individuals pre-immunized with smallpox vaccines. LC16m8 is a better vector than non-replicating vaccinia virus for the expression of SIV Gag. the gag proteins of HIV-1 and SIV are major antigens that elicit cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses. the activity of anti-Gag CTL inversely correlate with the viral load in HIV-1-infected individuals. m8/p7.5/SIVGag was less pathogenic and elicited Gag-specific IFN-+, CD107+ and CD8+ T-cells more efficiently than m8/p7.5/SIVGag. LC16m8 that express SIV Gag under the control of the p7.5 promoter induced more efficient and long-lasting immune responses than m8/p7.5/SIVGag. LC16m8 is highly attenuated and shows no pathogenic effects in SCID mice. despite its replication-competent phenotype, LC16m8 is highly attenuated and shows no pathogenic effects in SCID mice. LC16m8 recombinants may be useful as a dual vaccine against smallpox and pathogens."}
