{"summary": "CDC BioSense system receives near real-time health care utilization data from number of sources, including doD and VA outpatient facilities, and nonfederal hospital EDs in the US to support all-hazards surveillance and situational awareness. however, the system lacks some critical functions such as creating ad hoc definition of syndrome or ad hoc query tool development. bioSense staff compiled the results and set up a weekly reporting system on MERS like syndrome cases to the CDC. reports included five case definitions and a table reporting jurisdiction name, date, number of MERS cases investigated and number of MERS cases ruled out. subject matter experts will help develop more comprehensive definitions to conduct enhanced surveillance at the national level using multiple syndromic surveillance systems."}
