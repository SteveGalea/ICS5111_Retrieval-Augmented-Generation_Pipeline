{"summary": "the world now has a clear picture of how prepared countries are for this potentially catastrophic event. when the international evaluation team left Haiti in July 2019, one hundred countries had completed a joint external evaluation of health emergency readiness. this milestone, in addition to the ongoing uncontrolled Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo, makes this an opportune time to take stock of both the status of the world\u2019s readiness and what needs to be done to make the world safer. the cost of the 2014\u20132016 Ebola epidemic alone is estimated at $53 billion. despite an estimated 25%\u201388% annual return on investment, preparedness rarely ranks high on political agendas. countries must ensure prioritisation of core capacities of laboratory, surveillance, workforce and emergency response operations. countries can use information collected from JEEs, annual self-evaluations of preparedness, risk assessments and evaluations of real and simulated events to identify specific vulnerabilities. use of after-action reviews and robust simulation exercises enables countries to strengthen systems for an unusual or larger event. reviews can also help identify bottlenecks to effective response, such as inadequate community engagement and geographic or demographic groups that distrust government action. many of these structures are not fully functional and lack key components, including information management systems and full-time, trained staff. the world has an in-depth understanding of how prepared most countries are to deal with epidemic diseases. funded, prioritised, well-planned actions must be implemented at scale as soon as possible, supported by a network of partners working together to support countries to step up their capacities to prevent, detect and respond to public health threats."}
