{"summary": "between 500,000 and 700,000 people die each year from chronic infection-related cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or from fulminant hepatitis B. transmission occurs via percutaneous and mucosal exposure to infectious body fluids. most common route of transmission is sexual transmission. allograft occurred in up to 80%, and infrequently was associated with an aggressive cholestatic variant that caused progressive graft dysfunction. the subsequent availability of safe and effective antiviral drugs led to additional survival benefits by improving prophylactic efficacy and preventing disease progression in those with recurrence. HBIG is a polyclonal antibody to HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) derived from pooled human plasma. the costs of HBIG treatment and prevention are not the only limitations to its use. it has also been proposed to abandon HBIG prophylaxis in favor of using antiviral drugs alone. Isolation of HBsAg specific B-cell clones Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from a healthy donor (ADRI) and from a person convalescing from acute hepatitis B (PK) both subjects showed high serum anti-HBs titers. supernatants were tested by ELISA using a recombinant HBsAg preparation. cultures exhibiting a 492 nm optical density >1 were cloned and subcloned by limiting dilution in complete media + 20 ng/ml IL-6 in the presence of irradiated feeder cells. human monoclonal antibodies ADRI-2F3, PK3D1 and PK10C7 were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. plates were washed with PBS + 0.05% Tween20, then 100 l of diluted HRP- AffiniPure- goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) were added. recombinant spent culture supernatant from recombinant ADRI-2F3 mAb was validated against HBsAg in ELISA in duplicate using supernatant from the original B-cell clone as comparator. HBsAg was coated in carbonate buffer in an ELISA plate O/N at 4 C\u00b0. recombinant ADRI-2F3-13132 culture sup., human mAb anti-HBs ADRI-2F3 and complete medium as negative control. participants were administered a written informed consent which they signed. 3 x 103 B cells in complete media were seeded in each well of a 96-well round-bottom plate (code n\u00b0 3799 Costar) after evident visual outgrowth of lymphoblastoid cells, supernatants were tested by ELISA for the presence of anti-HBV envelope antibodies using a recombinant HBsAg preparation. microtiter plates were coated with HBsAg at a concentration of 1 g of 0.05M bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) per ml at 4\u00b0C overnight. after saturation with 0.1M PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) human anti-HBs mAbs were preincubated with three different human mAbs ADRI-2F3, PK10C7, PK3D1, at dilutions ranging from 1:101 to 1:106. neutralization power of the human anti-HBs mAbs was directly compared with a well-characterized preS1-specific antibody (MA18/7). recombinant spent culture supernatant from recombinant ADRI-2F3 mAb was validated against HBsAg in ELISA in duplicate using supernatant from the original B-cell clone. recombinant ADRI-2F3-13132 culture sup., human mAb anti-HBs ADRI-2F3, and complete medium as negative control. mAb binding to HBsAg was not significantly affected by the same mAb. humAb ADRI-2F3, recADRI2F3, PK-10C7 and PK3D1 binding to HBsAg was not significantly affected by the same mAb. concentration in the supernatant was 27 g/ml it can be extrapolated that ADRI-2F3 efficiently neutralized HBV at concentrations of at least 2.7 ng/ml. PK10C7 did not neutralize infection of PTH while PK3D1 showed moderate neutralizing activity down to a dilution of 1:102 (about 200 ng/ml) n = 20 VH and n = 20 VL clones of the 5\u2032 RACE reaction on RNA isolated from human clone ADRI-2F3 yielded clear sequences for both the VH and the VL domains. only fulllength cDNAs with an obvious sequence were analyzed per clone. recombinant antibody ADRI-2F3 is about 10 times more reactive than the original human monoclonal antibody. titration curve shows that the recombinant antibody is about 10 times more reactive than the original human monoclonal antibody. humAb IgG showed strong binding to HBsAg in ELISA. humAb ADRI-2F3 supernatant showed strong neutralization activity up to 1:10,000 dilution. PK-10C7 (lane 3) and PK-3D1 (lane 4) showed strong neutralization activity up to 1:10,000 dilution. PK3D1 showed moderate neutralizing activity down to a dilution of 1:102 (about 200 ng/ml) which proved to be at least as good as the standard murine MA18/7 anti-pre-S1 mAb used as positive neutralization standard (1:100, corresponding to a concentration of 10 g/ml) it is shown that a dilution of 1:10,000 of monoclonal antibody supernatant ADRI-2F3 completely neutralizes the eukaryotic expression of ADRI-2F3 hIgG1 yielded a recombinant with specificity identical to the original clone. the recombinant ADRI-2F3 spent culture supernatant displayed a reactivity of approximately one log10 scale above the spent culture supernatant of the originating human clone. most mAb against HBV are of murine origin. such murine antibodies have the inherent disadvantage that they evoke an immune reaction in a human recipient when used in a therapeutic composition. the humAb is a dominant epitope which tends to monopolize the specificity of immune responses to a complex protein. the common determinant is a dominant epitope which tends to monopolize the specificity of immune responses to a complex protein. this can be achieved by maintaining a high titer of neutralizing antibody. ADRI-2F3 variable domains may advantageously be used to produce unlimited amount of humAb without relying on vaccinated donor plasma. it would be desirable that such mAb produced under GMP conditions be used in clinical trials of prophylaxis of HBV reinfection following liver transplantation."}
