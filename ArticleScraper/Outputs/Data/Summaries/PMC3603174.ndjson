{"summary": "the 11 laws of The Fifth Discipline are also applicable in many ways to problems of health and disease treatment. we are seeing growing incidences of autoimmune diseases, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. this fact makes logical sense when considering cancer and diseases such as Alzheimer disease. the cancer paradigm contributes to a greater understanding of how cells interact with their microenvironment and reveals a potentially clearer understanding of cancer. the purpose of this paper is to promote the importance of new ways of looking at things. discovery begins with the awareness of anomaly, i.e. with the recognition that nature has somehow violated the paradigm-induced expectations that govern normal science. but it closes only when the paradigm theory has been adjusted so that the anomalous has become the expected. inflammation is regarded as a key component of the immune system that ensures tissues of the body are free from invading organisms. many cells, including white blood cells, are better described as multifunctional. some new mental models will challenge established mental models. new mental models may provide a better understanding of how biological systems do what they do. AngII exerts its pressor effects on the cardiovascular and renal systems via interactions with its 2 receptor molecules, AngII type 1 receptor (AT1R) and AngII type 2 receptor (AT2R) the receptors are viewed as mutually antagonistic in the control of blood pressure, water, and electrolyte homeostasis. a mental model was established that the RAS controlled blood pressure with complementary effects in controlling thirst, salt retention, and fluid homeostasis. in the fable of the blind men who came across an elephant, each of them had a different perception of what the elephant was. the implications of this new understanding could revolutionize our approach to treating many chronic inflammatory diseases. the danger is that if we cannot adapt our thinking, then we will be slow, or worse still, will fail to take advantage of our new knowledge. knockouts of AT1a and AT2 were found to have contrasting effects in collagen deposition, cell infiltration, and expression of collagen and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1. another AT1a knockout model found reduced wound-induced angiogenesis and wound healing. in\u201d and \u201cdisease\u201d in PubMed from March 2012 showed that the RAS has been noted as a participant in a great variety of diseases. a central role for the RAS in most, if not all, chronic inflammatory diseases becomes evident. angiotensinogen, ACE, AngII, and the AT1 receptor were significantly upregulated by hyperoxia. a spectrum of important molecules involved in the cellular response to stress is induced by AT1R. cells respond to stress through angiotensin II type 1 upregulation. in disease conditions, the stress is not removed, the response continues unabated, and healthy tissue becomes subject to remodeling. adapted from this work, highlights some common defects in growth, antigrowth, and death controls that are necessary for normal cells to become cancerous and for tumors to form. microenvironment is ineffective against the cancer because those cells have developed resistance to death signals. inflammation exerts lethal effects (apoptosis and phagocytosis) on healthy tissue. this process promotes many essential environmental support processes. many studies concluded that ARBs carry no significant risk of worsening cancer incidence or progression. many studies concluded that ARBs carry no significant risk of worsening cancer incidence or progression. many studies concluded that ARBs carry no significant risk of worsening cancer incidence or progression,86-93. ARBs/ACEIs have many positive effects in advanced cancer, including increased survival,99-109 improved performance status,109 reduced reoccurrence,110-113 and reduced toxicity when used in conjunction with radiotherapy. a mental model provides an explanation of how cells interact with their tissue microenvironment. innate response forms the foundation for dealing with potential invaders and stress such as occurs with bacteriophages in bacteria. in the cell response model, 3 adaptive responses are envisaged that provide specialist means whereby cells can respond to changes in their environment. each of these responses involves a pressure, or force, that drives the response; an accelerator; and a brake for the process. in disease conditions, the source of cell stress is not resolved as a result of the wound response. the second of the adaptive responses is the growth response. the pressure behind this response is provided by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which is mainly secreted by the liver. a key step in the adaptive immune response is the conditioning or maturing of the APC so it develops the ability to train T cells to recognize antigens in the lymph nodes. many cytokines have wide-ranging properties that steer either the early (innate) or the adaptive (antigen-derived) response. adaptive immunity is designed to be suppressed so when dead and dying tissue is phagocytized, the development of self-antigens is suppressed to avoid genuine autoimmune reactions. the model further predicts infection as a causative factor in autoimmune diseases and suggests that we should look for and be more receptive to the wealth of evidence showing that dealing with the underlying ongoing chronic infection will lead to successful disease treatment. SYSTEMS THINKING AND ANGIOTENSIN Established thinking has confined the RAS to the control of blood pressure. but through a process of synthesis we are on the cusp of recognizing its fuller role in maintaining organism, organ, and tissue integrity."}
