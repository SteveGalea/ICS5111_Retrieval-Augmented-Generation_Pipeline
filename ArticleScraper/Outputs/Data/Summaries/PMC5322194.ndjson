{"summary": "invasive fungal infections are gaining growing importance and the medical community has placed increased emphasis on their impact in public health. it is estimated that the amount of life-threatening infections by opportunistic fungi exceeds 2,000,000 per year worldwide. this is accompanied by a high morbidity of patients and mortality rates of more than 40% in severely immunocompromised patients. the miRISC binds to a target mRNA in its 3\u2032-UTR. the binding can also happen in the 5\u2032-UTR or in the coding region. microRNAs contribute to the regulation of the immune system by influencing the function and differentiation of various immune cells of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. a previous study analyzed the regulation of microRNAs in murine macrophages when encountering C. albicans. in contrast, our study is directly based on human cells instead of model organisms. we apply next-generation sequencing of small RNA instead of microRNA microarrays, which allows studying microRNA expression at higher precision and depth. colonies were induced by culturing in M199 medium, pH 8 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. germ tubes were inactivated by washing them in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubation in PBS containing 0.1% thimerosal (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with shaking. four independent biological replica (no technical replica) were performed. Stimulation of DCs was monitored by flow cytometry. induction of DC surface markers CD83 and CD86 was significant for A. fumigatus, C. albicans and LPS after 6 and 12 h, respectively. quantification of secreted protein levels by multiplex ELISA assays demonstrated activation as well. the microRNA data has been deposited in the GEO NCBI database. short-read mapping and counting The sequenced reads were mapped to known microRNA precursors, downloaded from miRBase (version 20) using the tool \"bowtie\" Langmead et al. (2009) (version 0.12.9) RNA samples were hybridized to an Affymetrix HG-U219 array plate. images were subjected to visual inspection to control for hybridization artifacts. the files were imported into partek Genomics Suite. miRTarBase contains microRNA-target-interactions (MTIs) from manually curated literature search. the target genes are categorized into functional and non-functional. miRanda scans the 3\u2032-UTR sequences for possible binding sites. RNA was isolated by using miRVana microRNA isolation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) cDNA synthesis was performed with first Strand cDNA synthesis kit (thermo Fisher Scientific) western blotting Cells were re-suspended in lysis buffer (6.65 M Urea (Sigma), 10% Glycerin, 1% SDS, 10 mM Tris (Carl Roth GmbH), pH 6.8) cell lysates were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. anti-rabbit, anti-mouse (Cell Signaling) and anti-goat (R&D systems) antibodies were used as secondary antibodies. signals were visualized by ECL reaction with ClarityTM ECL Western Substrate (BioRad) or PierceTM ECL Western Blotting substrate (Thermo Scientific) predicted mature microRNAs were found at least in two time points or two different infections. we defined predictions as high-confidence, if the 3p as well as the 5p mature microRNA were found at least in two time points or two different infections. the counts of predicted mature microRNAs were determined for each sample. oligonucleotides with the respective sequence of the mature microRNA were used as forward primer. the sequences of the oligonucleotides are listed in the Supplementary Table 1. PBMCs were isolated from completely independent healthy volunteers by ficoll (Bicoll Seperation, Biochrom AG) density gradient centrifugation. magnetic activated cell sorting with paramagnetic CD14-beads was used to further separate monocytes. RNA samples had a RNA integrity number (RIN) of 8.9 0.9 determined by Agilent Bioanalyzer. 500 ng total RNA was used to generate small RNA sequencing libraries by TruSeq Small RNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) mRNA analysis DCs of four independent donors were harvested after 6 and 12 h co-culture with A. fumigatus, C. albicans and LPS. mRNA analysis DCs of four independent donors were harvested after 6 and 12 h co-culture with Affymetrix whole genome expression arrays. microarray data has been deposited in the GEO NCBI database. 2.7. Differentially expression analysis Differentially expressed microRNAs were determined using the R package \u201climma\u201d (Smyth, 2005) miRanda scans the 3\u2032-UTR of mRNA sequences for possible binding sites. it also calculates the free energy of the binding. miRanda uses the 3\u2032-UTR sequences as input. microRNA quantification was performed after stimulation with either A. fumgiatus, C. albicans or LPS. specific cDNA was generated from 100 ng template. quantification was performed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) with TaqMan probes. Western blotting Cells were re-suspended in lysis buffer (6.65 M Urea (Sigma), 10% Glycerin, 1% SDS, 10 mM Tris (Carl Roth GmbH), pH 6.8) membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-KLF4, anti-IFITM2 (Cell Signaling), goat anti-SPN and anti-FKBP1B (R&D systems) and mouse anti-Actin antibodies were used as secondary antibodies. miRDeep2 was run with the parameters -d -e -h -i -j -m -u -v to perform sequence preprocessing and to map the reads to the human genome (hg19). the input data were the precursor and mature microRNA sequences of Homo sapiens from miRBase, the mapping of the mapper module, and the mature microRNA sequences of the hominoids Gorilla gorilla, Pan paniscus, Pongo qRT-PCR was performed on a lightCycler480 System (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) using the miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen) for multiple sequence alignment, ClustalW (Larkin et al., 2007) was used with default parameters. microRNA signatures are specific for fungal infections. we simulated bacterial infection by adding lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to DCs. six hours post infection, we identified three, five, and five differentially expressed microRNAs. the 6 h samples of all three conditions are closer to the control samples. similar samples are close to each other, while different samples are distant. infection is different to control and bacterial infection is different to fungal. miRTarBase used miRanda and MirTarget2 to predict microRNA targets. with these three sources, we determined target genes for the fungal-specific DEMs. mRNA destabilization is the main mode of repression by microRNAs. the second filtering step comprises a correlation analysis. we calculated the Pearson correlation of the microRNA expression values. genes with a correlation coefficient of -0.5 or less were retained as high-confidence targets. miR-132-5p and miR-212-5p have the most immune-related target genes in their filtered lists. TRIM22 and IFITM2 play a role in the anti-viral immune response. microRNAs fine-tune gene expression in dendritic cells. d miR-132-5p and miR-212-5p in separate experiments. the regulatory effects of the microRNAs are weaker than suggested by the microarray data. however, an up-regulation of the target genes (BTN3A2, FKBP1B, KLF4, SPN, TRIM22, and IFITM2) is visible when the microRNAs are silenced. the infection with C. albicans led to a stronger up-regulation than the infection with A. fumigatus. further indication for microRNA-target-interactions were collected via western blots and silencing of the microRNAs. we identified 21 non-overlapping high-confidence predictions. for each of these predictions, we determined whether the 3p and/or the 5p mature microRNA has counts of at least ten in three or more samples. miR-378j has the smallest distance to novel_3-3p, indicating highest similarity. the microRNAs of the miR-378 family play a role in rhabdomyosarcoma, myogenesis, and apoptosis. miR-1260a/b was shown to be up-regulated in patients with pelvic organ prolapse. the seed sequence of novel_4-5p seems to be unique among the known microRNAs. BLAST results did not yield any major sequence similarities. we clustered the expression data of all 26 unique DEMs by using multidimensional scaling (MDS) the clustering is based on Spearman correlations, which means similar samples are close to each other. the 6 h samples of all three conditions are closer to the control samples, indicating higher similarities than the 12 h samples. miR-132-5p and miR-212-5p have been associated to different cancer types. the microRNA miR-129-5p has been associated to different cancer types. miRTarBase provides experimentally validated target genes. ization is the main mode of repression by microRNAs. we used microarray data of the same conditions and time points to determine which of the target genes are significantly down-regulated. all of the fungal DEMs are up-regulated in both time points. 88 BTN3A2 0.663 FAM46A 0.545 SP110 0.778 KLF4 0.748 SP110 0.799 FKBP1B 0.934 ADD3 0.588 MTMR1 0.863 DHTKD1 0.865 TTC39C 0.773 CASP6 0.606 DNPEP 0.828 CCDC170 0.516 SPN 0.772 TRIM22 0.690 IFITM2 0.795 The resulting set of target both TRIM22 and IFITM2 play a role in the anti-viral immune response. the regulatory effects of the microRNAs are weaker than suggested by the microarray data. a trend toward up-regulation on microRNA silencing can be found. the infection with C. albicans led to a stronger up-regulation than the infection with A. fumigatus. the up-regulation is stronger for the A. fumigatus infection compared to the C. albicans infection. miRDeep2 algorithm works in multiple stages. first, reads of the microRNA dataset are preprocessed and mapped to the genome. then, for each precursor sequence, the secondary structure and the energetic stability are predicted. BLAST results revealed a high similarity of novel_3-3p to the sequences of the miR-378 family. the microRNA miR-378j has the smallest distance to novel_3-3p, indicating highest similarity. the microRNA miR-378j has the smallest distance to novel_3-3p, indicating highest similarity. the phylogenetic tree of the miR-378 family was generated by ClustalW. it indicates that the newly discovered microRNA novel_3-3p is closest related to miR-378j. BLAST results further indicate a connection between miR-1260a/b and novel_4-5p. a possible reason for this observation is that microRNA expression has to be induced by a trigger event, which in this study is the treatment with a fungus or LPS. this induction may not be completed after 6 h and thus more microRNAs are up-regulated at 12 h. both of the above mentioned findings can be confirmed by the Venn diagrams. Das Gupta et al. (2014) showed an up-regulation of miR-132-3p in DCs in response to A. fumigatus stimulation. a stimulation with LPS had no effect on miR-132-3p. microRNAs may also serve as biomarkers. microRNAs miR-132-5p and miR-212-5p are not yet known to be of immunological significance. the regulatory patterns of the PCR experiments and the western blots are contrary for A. fumigatus and C. albicans. this finding indicates a considerable influence of post-transcriptional and/or translational regulation. expression of miR212-5p was significantly increased after 6 h of co-cultivation. this observation indicates the general relevance of miR212-5p in various cell populations of the innate immunity. in human primary monocytes miR-132 (and also miR-155) was differentially expressed after stimulation with A. fumigatus. KC and IL performed the validation experiments of the novel microRNAs. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
