{"summary": "the coVs belong to the Coronaviridae family of the order Nidovirales. they are distributed widely among animals, birds, and humans. HCoV-OC43 causes mild upper respiratory infection and is identified as a major etiological agent of the common cold (4). the E protein with M protein is sufficient to form virus-like particles (VLPs) in vitro. the major function of the N protein involves binding the viral RNA to form a helical nucleocapsid that is surrounded by the viral envelope. the HE protein is considered the fifth structural protein that incorporates into the viral envelope. the ns12.9 accessory protein encodes a potential protein with a molecular mass of 12.9 kDa. this protein is named ns12.9 (28) and facilitates virion morphogenesis. this is the first study to define the function of an accessory protein during HCoV-OC43-ns12.9 infection. ns12.9 remained very stable in vitro and in vivo. no changes were found in the ns12.9 gene during the course of experiments. ns12.9 remained very stable in vitro and in vivo. pYD-C191 plasmid was amplified with a pair of 70-nucleotide (nt) primers. the underlined 50-nt sequences were homologous to the viral genome sequences immediately upstream or downstream of the mutant nucleotide position (boldface) the cassette subsequently was recombined into the pBAC-OC43-WT cDNA clone by linear recombination in the anti-hemagglutinin (HA) mouse monoclonal antibody (MMS-101P) was purchased from Covance. anti-HA (H6908) and anti-Flag (F7425) rabbit polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma. nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) colocalization studies were examined using a leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope. transfected cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. gels or agaroses then were washed 5 times with RIPA buffer. ns12.9-HA cRNA was synthesized using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE high-yield capped RNA transcription SP6 kit from the pNWP-ns12.9-HA plasmid. the membranes were incubated for 1 h with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. the empty pYES2 or pYES2-ns12.9-HA vector were transformed into a potassium uptake-deficient yeast strain, W303 R5421 (ura3-52 his3200 leu21 trp11 ade2 trk1::HIS3 trk1::HIS3 trk2::HIS3). RD cells were seeded in 96-well plates and infected with each virus in a serial dilution of 101 to 107. titers of infectious HCoV-OC43 virions were determined by IPA as previously reported (30, 31) total RNA from virus-infected cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) RNA (1 g) then was used for reverse transcription using the ReverTra Ace qPCR RT kit (Toyobo) copies of genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) in infected cells were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using cDNA. RD cells were infected with recombinant WT or ns12.9 viruses at an MOI of 1 for 24 h. the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde overnight at 4\u00b0C. the cells then were dehydrated gradually through an ethanol series. hek293T, BHK-21, and RD cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. the recombinant wild-type HCoV-OC43 (HCoV-OC43-WT) and ns12.9 knockout HCoV-OC43 mutant (HCoV-OC43-ns12.9) were rescued from the infective cDNA clones pBAC-OC43-WT 12.9, influenza A virus (IAV) M2, hepatitis C virus (HCV) p7, and human enterovirus 71 (EV71) 2B were amplified by PCR. ns12.9-HA sequence was cloned into pNWP vector for cRNA in vitro transcription and cloned into a yeast expression vector, pYES2 for a yeast potassium uptake complementation assay. pBAC-OC43-ns12.9 cDNA clone contained a single-nucleotide mutation at position 12 of the ns12.9 gene. resulting 82-nt sequence consisted of one FRT site and an EcoRI restriction site. anti-hemagglutinin (HA) mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from Covance. the OC43-N mouse monoclonal antibody (MAB9012) was purchased from Merck Millipore. the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody were obtained from the antibody research center. immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA) cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. gels or agaroses then were washed 5 times with RIPA buffer and lysed in sodium dodecyl s the ns12.9-HA cRNA was synthesized using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE high-yield capped RNA transcription SP6 kit (Ambion, USA) oocytes in stages V to VI were injected with 30 ng of cRNA and incubated at 18\u00b0C in an ND-96 solution. the pYES2 vector contains a URA3 gene as a selectable marker for positive transformants in ura-negative hosts. the exogenous gene is controlled by the GAL1 promoter, and its expression was induced in the presence of galactose. the monoclonal mouse antibody specific for the HCoV-OC43 N protein and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody were used as primary and secondary antibodies. the viral antigens were visualized using TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL) for intracellular virions, cells were disrupted by three cycles of freeze-thawing in dry ice and a 37\u00b0C water bath. the copies of genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) in infected cells were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using SYBR green real-time PCR master mix (Toyobo) all of the primers are presented in Table 1. the infiltrated samples were polymerized at 60\u00b0C for 48 h. ultrathin sections were stained with 2% uranyl acetate and 1% lead citrate. mice were intranasally inoculated with 5 l of the HCoV-OC43-WT or HCoV-OC43-ns12.9 viral stock. ns12.9 accessory protein of HCoV-OC43 acts as a viroporin. ns12.9 contains a hydrophobic segment with 21 amino acids. the plasma membrane localization of ns12.9 then was tested with immunofluorescence staining. s12.9 in 293T cells transfected with pCAGGS-ns12.9-HA or pCAGGS-ns12.9-HA or empty vectors. cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-HA agarose or anti-Flag M2 affinity gel. yeasts transformed with empty or ns12.9-expressing vector were grown in parallel on plates supplemented with 100 mM or 0.2 mM KCl. plates were kept at 30\u00b0C for 3 to 4 days. we next sought to investigate whether ns12.9 could form homo-oligomers. the ns12.9 accessory protein acts as a viroporin in that it oligomerizes in the cell membrane to form ion channels. to investigate the function of ns12.9 during HCoV-OC43 infection, a recombinant mutant virus defective in the ns12.9 gene was rescued by reverse genetics. ns12.9-infected cells were slightly larger than that amplified from HCoV-OC43-WT-infected cells. these results suggest that the HCoV-OC43-ns12.9 virus was successfully rescued by the mutant cDNA clone. to construct the pBAC-OC43-ns12.9 clone, the G12A nucleotide was changed to a stop codon at Trp4. arrowheads indicate different fragments between the pBAC-OC43-WT and pBAC-OC43-ns12.9 plasmid. arrowheads indicate different fragments between the pBAC-OC43-WT and pBAC-OC43-ns12.9 plasmid. ns12.9 viroporin is important for HCoV-OC43 replication in vitro. cells were infected with HCoV-OC43-WT or HCoV-OC43-ns12.9 at an MOI of 0.1. supernatants were collected at the indicated times to determine viral titers using IPA. ns12.9 viroporin plays an important role in the production of infectious virus. cells were transfected with a vector expressing ns12.9-HA. expression levels of ns12.9-HA were determined at 48 h posttransfection by Western blotting. vectors expressing SARS-3a, 229E-ORF4a, and NL63-ORF3 were constructed. expression levels were detected by Western blot analysis. three well-researched viroporins, IAV-M2, HCV-p7, and EV71-2B, were selected. the expression levels of OC43-ns12.9, IAV-M2, EV71-2B, and HCV-p7 were determined at 48 h posttransfection by Western blotting. the M2 and 2B viroporins compensate for the production of HCoV-OC43-ns12.9 at an MOI of 1. Cell supernatants were collected at 72 hpi. production of HCoV-OC43-ns12.9 was compensated for in cells expressing M2 in trans. the transient expression of M2, but not the M229-31 mutant, complemented HCoV-OC43-ns12.9 in RD cells. ns12.9 does not affect viral entry, sgmRNA synthesis, and protein expression. ns12.9 accessory protein does not affect the early steps of HCoV-OC43 infection. RD cells were infected with HCoV-OC43-WT or HCoV-OC43-ns12.9 at an MOI of 1 and fixed at 0.5 and 1.5 hpi. cells were stained with an OC43-N mouse monoclonal antibody. coronavirus generates a series of smaller sgmRNAs that serve as the messenger RNAs for viral protein synthesis. to address whether the knockout of ns12.9 alters sgmRNA synthesis, all HCoV-OC43 sgmRNAs were measured by qRT-PCR. 12.9 was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of RD cells. ns12.9 was localized at ERGIC (Fig. 7, middle and lower) RD cells were infected with HCoV-OC43-WT or HCoV-OC43-ns12.9 at an MOI of 1. the number of virions in cells infected with wild-type virus was higher than that with the mutant virus. in HCoV-OC43-WT-infected cells, mature virions showed a dense core were abundant in vesicles. viral particles in HCoV-OC43-ns12.9-infected cells showed an aberrant pattern with a translucent central zone. the virions were found in the Golgi complex (circles) and secretory vesicles (asterisks) the thick arrows indicate the mature virions, and the thin arrows indicate the aberrant virions. the quantification of total numbers of virions (B) and the mature or aberrant virions (C) are shown. HCoV-OC43-ns12.9-infected mice were sacrificed every 2 dpi to measure the viral titers in brains. the wild-type viral titers were 10- to 100-fold increased compared to the mutant viral titers in brains. mice were intranasally inoculated with HCoV-OC43-WT or HCoV-OC43-ns12.9. the ns12.9 accessory protein acts as a viroporin in HCoV-OC43. ns12.9 contains a hydrophobic segment with 21 amino acids. the plasma membrane localization of ns12.9 was tested with immunofluorescence staining. ns12.9 accessory protein of HCoV-OC43 acts as a viroporin. the hydropathy plot was drawn with a window size of 19 using the Kyte-Doolittle method of hydrophilicity calculation. cells were fixed, nonpermeabilized, and subjected to incubation with anti-HA monoclonal antibody. d proteins were determined by Western blotting using polyclonal anti-Flag and anti-HA antibody. the monomer and oligomers are indicated with an arrowhead and arrows, respectively. oligomers of ns12.9 were separated by SDS-PAGE. to assess the ion channel activity of ns12.9, membrane currents of ns12.9 oocytes were recorded using a two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) the growth of ns12.9-expressing transformants could be rescued on the low-potassium medium, whereas empty transformants only grew on the high-potassium medium. the pBAC-OC43-ns12.9 mutant cDNA clone was engineered from the infective wild-type clone (pBAC-OC43-WT) by homologous recombination and examined by digestion with the EcoRI restriction enzyme and direct sequencing. supernatants from transfected cells were harvested and used to infect the RD cells. pBAC-OC43-ns12.9 clone was modified to a stop codon at Trp4. an 82-nt segment was inserted behind the mutant stop codon. arrowheads indicate different fragments between the pBAC-OC43-WT and pBAC-OC43-ns12.9 plasmid. recombinant HCoV-OC43-WT and HCoV-OC43-ns12.9 mutant viruses replicated efficiently and reached a maximum titer of approximately 108.0 TCID50/ml at 144 hpi. the peak titer of the HCoV-OC43-ns12.9 virus was approximately 106.6 TCID50/ml at 120 hpi. the reduced viral yield of HCoV-OC43-ns12.9 in cultured cell lines suggested that the ns12.9 viroporin is important for viral infection. an ns12.9 protein expression vector was constructed, and its expression level was detected by Western blot analysis. cells were infected with HCoV-OC43-WT or HCoV-OC43-ns12.9 at an MOI of 1, and the viral titers were determined by IPA. the expression levels of ns12.9, SARS-3a, NL63-ORF3 and 229E-ORF4a were determined at 48 h posttransfection. three well-researched viroporins, IAV-M2, HCV-p7, and EV71-2B, were selected and analyzed. these viroporins expressing vectors were transfected into RD cells followed by HCoV-OC43-ns12.9 infection. the p7 viroporin failed to compensate for HCoV-OC43-ns12.9 in replication. the expression levels of M2 and M229-31 mutant were determined at 48 h posttransfection. the mutant does not compensate for the production of HCoV-OC43-ns12.9. after 24 h posttransfection, RD cells were infected with HCoV-OC43-ns12.9 at an MOI of 1. ns12.9 viroporin does not affect the early steps of HCoV-OC43 infection. ns12.9 accessory protein does not affect the early steps of HCoV-OC43 infection. total RNA was extracted from the infected cells at 8 hpi. HCoV-OC43 sgmRNA levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR using the specific primers presented in Table 1. qPCR amplification efficiency of the ns12.9 gene was suppressed by the extended 82-nt segment in the ns12.9 gene. deletion of the ns12.9 protein may not influence viral protein synthesis. ns12.9 is involved in virion morphogenesis. cells were transfected with pCAGGS-ns12.9-HA. cells were fixed and examined by confocal microscopy analysis. ns12.9 was stained with anti-HA monoclonal antibody. a lower titer of intracellular infectious virions was measured in cells infected with HCoV-OC43-ns12.9 than with cells infected with HCoV-OC43-WT. this decrease in intracellular viral titers of HCoV-OC43-ns12.9 was consistent with the decreased viral titers observed in the supernatant. RD cells were infected with HCoV-OC43-WT or HCoV-OC43-ns12.9 at an MOI of 1. Cells were disrupted by three cycles of freeze-thawing in dry ice and a 37\u00b0C water bath. data represent the means SD and were generated from three independent experiments. ns12.9 is attenuated in growth and virulence in vivo. mice were intranasally inoculated with HCoV-OC43-WT or HCoV-OC43-ns12.9. weight variations (A) and survival curves (B) after infection are presented for each group. accessory protein 3a in HCoV and ORF4a in HCoV-229E function as viroporins during viral infection. ns12.9 is a viroporin in that it has all of the features of viroporins, such as membrane localization, self-oligomerization, and ion channel formation. ns12.9 is important for the production of infectious HCoV-OC43 particles. the ion channel activity of viroporins has been reported to associate with viral production, fitness, and pathogenesis (42). the picornavirus 2B is present primarily in the Golgi compartments and induces calcium efflux, which is important for virus release. ns12.9 may be involved in membrane scission and promote the budding of progeny virions. many viroporins are virion-incorporated proteins (36, 49, 50), but without an effective antibody, we cannot rule out the possibility that the ns12.9 viroporin is a structural protein. ns12.9 viroporin activates inflammasome in macrophages and dendritic cells. MHV 5a, a homologous accessory protein of HCoV-OC43 ns12.9, recently has been reported to be an antagonist of IFN-induced antiviral action."}
