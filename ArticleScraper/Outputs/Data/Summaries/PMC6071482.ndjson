{"summary": "translation initiation culminates with formation of an 80S initiation complex in which Met-tRNAiMet is bound in the P (peptidyl) site of the ribosome. the anticodon of the Met-tRNAiMet is base-paired with the start codon of the messenger RNA (mRNA), and the second codon of the open reading frame is in the A (aminoacyl) site of the ribosome. the aminoacyl-tRNA is accommodated into the A site. the eEF1A\u2022GDP is recycled to eEF1A\u2022GTP by the exchange factor eEF1B. following peptide bond formation, the eEF1A\u2022GDP is accommodated into the A site. the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) helix h44 residues A1824 and A1825 in mammalian (rabbit) ribosomes interact with the minor groove of the codon\u2013anticodon helix. the residues G626 in rabbit ribosomes (G577 in S. cerevisiae and G530 in E. coli) interact with the first two codon pairs in the codon\u2013anticodon duplex structures of eukaryotic ribosomal complexes have provided insights into GTPase activation of eEF1A as well as of eRF3 in termination complexes and of Hbs1 in ribosome rescue complexes. interactions between the sarcin-ricin loop of the large ribosomal subunit and the Switch 2 loop of the GTPase domains helps position the catalytic His residue to promote GTP hydrolysis. eEF1A and accommodation of aminoacyl-tRNA in the ribosome are conserved. the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) of the ribosome is well conserved between bacteria and eukaryotes. eIF5A, the ortholog of bacterial elongation factor P (EF-P), binds in the E site. in rotated-1 complexes, the newly formed peptidyl-tRNA is in the A site. in rotated-1 complexes, the deacylated tRNA adopts a hybrid P/E state. the peptidyl-tRNA is repositioned into a hybrid A/P state with the anticodon paired with mRNA in the A site. small subunit head and reverse rotation of the small subunit relative to the large subunit are thought to accompany movement of the tRNAs into the canonical P and E sites. following translocation, a deacylated tRNA occupies the E site and peptidyl-tRNA is positioned in the P site. release of the E-site tRNA from eukaryotic ribosomes is coupled to binding of the eEF1A\u2022GTP\u2022amino the ribosomal and translation factor contributions to translation elongation have focused on the bacterial system. the elongation factor eIF5A/EF-P is also conserved between eukaryotes and bacteria. in contrast, the ATPase eEF3 appears to be restricted to fungi. the catalytic eEF1B subunit forms a dimeric complex with eEF1B in yeast. overexpression of eIF1A or mutations in eEF1A that lower guanine nucleotide binding affinity bypass the essential requirement for eEF1B in yeast. mutations in eEF1A2 have been linked to a novel intellectual disability and epilepsy syndrome. eEF2 Translation elongation factor eEF2, like EF-G, is a structural mimic of the eEF1A\u2022GTP\u2022aminoacyl-tRNA ternary complex. eEF2 is posttranslationally modified to diphthamide (2-[3-carboxyamido-3-(trimethylammonio)propyl]histidine); this diphthamide modification is not present on bacterial EF-G. lack of diphthamide modification is lethal in mice as a result of significant developmental defects. mutations in DPH1/OVCA1 have been linked to ovarian cancer. both yeast and mammalian cells lacking diphthamide show increased levels of programmed 1 ribosomal frameshifting. diphthamide may increase the function of eEF2 in promoting precise ribosomal translocation. diphthamide residue directly interacts with the pseudocodon\u2013anticodon helix of PKI. it appears to disrupt the interaction of the ribosome decoding center h44 residues A1753 and A1754 (Kluyveromyces lactis 18S rRNA) with the PKI. loss of the interaction between diphthamide and the codon\u2013anticodon helix during canonical elongation might contribute to the increased ribosom eEF1 and eEF2 will only work with yeast ribosomes when eEF3 is added. eEF3 contains two ATP-binding cassettes (ABCs) and possesses ribosome-stimulated ATPase activity. eIF5A was considered an initiation factor with a critical role in first peptide bond formation. however, puromycin is a poor substrate because of unfavorable positioning in the PTC. the results of dipeptide synthesis assays using canonical aminoacyl-tRNA substrates argue strongly against a critical role for eIF5A. a separate study in yeast using a different degron to deplete eIF5A reported the maintenance of polysomes upon depletion of eIF5A, even in the absence of the elongation inhibitor cycloheximide. this latter study also reported that rapid inactivation of eIF5A mutants in yeast resulted in the accumulation of polysomes in the absence of cycloheximide. inactivation of eIF5A impaired translation of reporter genes containing runs of polyproline residues. eIF5A and its hypusine modification are required for the synthesis of polyproline peptides in vitro (Gutierrez et al. 2013; Li et al. 2014a). ribosomal profiling of bacteria lacking EF-P did not detect any impact on translation termination. differences between amino- and carboxy-terminal domains of eIF5A and EF-P are unclear. eIF5A/EF-P is modified by the addition of hydroxylated -lysine, 5-aminopentanol, or the sugar rhamnose in different species. posttranslational modification of eIF5A and EF-P is required for stimulation of methionyl-puromycin synthesis (Park et al. 1991, 2012), polyproline synthesis (Gutierrez et al. 2009), cryo-EM (Schmidt eIF5A is predicted to rapidly fill the E site following deacyl-tRNA release and contribute to each peptide bond and termination reaction. biochemical studies in both mammalian and yeast systems have revealed an interplay between eIF5A and polyamines. unhypusinated eIF5A can substitute for polyamines in the stimulation of general translation in vitro. eEF1A\u2013eEF1B The GTPase eEF1A binds aminoacyl-tRNA in a ternary complex with GTP. mutations in eEF1A that lower guanine nucleotide binding affinity bypass the essential requirement for eEF1B in yeast. eEF1A mutations increase nonsense suppression and show increased sensitivity to translation elongation inhibitors. mutations in eEF1A2 have been linked to intellectual disability and epilepsy syndrome. domain IV of eEF2 binds deep in the A-site decoding center to promote translocation of the tRNAs and mRNA on the ribosome. diphthamide modification is conserved in eukaryotes and archaea. mutations in DPH1/OVCA1 have been linked to ovarian cancer. despite its deep conservation, diphthamide is not essential in yeast. despite its deep conservation, diphthamide is not essential in yeast. eEF2 functions in a novel translocation reaction required for translation initiation on the internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) from the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) and the Taura syndrome virus (TSV) biochemical studies examining eEF2 function have provided additional insights into the function of the diphthamide modification on eEF2. it is tempting to speculate that loss of interaction between diphthamide and codon\u2013anticodon helix during canonical elongation might contribute to increased ribosomal frameshifting observed in cells lacking diphthamide. diphthamide functions to optimize the efficiency andfidelity of ribosomal translocation during translation elongation. eEF3 contains two ATP-binding cassettes (ABCs) and possesses ribosome-stimulated ATPase activity. Mutations in a chromodomain insert impair general translation. eEF3 contacts both the central protuberance of the 60S subunit and the head of the 40S subunit. the results of dipeptide synthesis assays using canonical aminoacyl-tRNA substrates argue strongly against a critical role for eIF5A in first peptide bond formation. the dipeptides Met-Phe and Met-Pro were efficiently synthesized in fully reconstituted yeast in in vitro translation assays lacking eIF5A. inactivation of temperature-sensitive eIF5A mutants in yeast resulted in accumulation of polysomes in the absence of cycloheximide. findings indicate a rate-limiting role for eIF5A in translation elongation rather than translation initiation or first peptide bond formation. polysome profile analyses in cells depleted of eIF5A revealed a pervasive elongation defect affecting a substantial fraction of cellular mRNAs. ribosomal profiling studies of cells depleted for eIF5A revealed a pronounced accumulation of ribosomes at stop codons. two isoforms of eIF5A are differentially expressed in both yeast and mammalian cells. the amino acid hypusine is formed posttranslationally on eIF5A by transfer of an N-butylamine group from spermidine to the -amino group of a conserved Lys residue forming deoxyhypusine. eIF5A bound to the yeast ribosome revealed the factor binding in the E site. the factor abuts the peptidyl-tRNA in the P site and the hypusine residue interacts with the acceptor arm of the peptidyl-tRNA. biochemical studies using misacylated tRNAs revealed that the imino acid proline rather than tRNAPro imposes the requirement for eIF5A. eIF5A is predicted to rapidly fill the E site following deacyl-tRNA release and contribute to each peptide bond and termination reaction. biochemical studies in both mammalian and yeast systems have revealed an interplay between eIF5A and polyamines. elongation is not clear, these results suggest that polyamines may interact with the peptidyl-tRNA to facilitate its proper and stable positioning required for peptide bond formation. mRNA elements were discovered that direct ribosomes to reassign the meanings of codons, induce ribosomes to slip into alternative reading frames, and even bypass long stretches of mRNA sequence (ribosome shunting) recoding elements involve complex mRNA topological features that induce ribosome pausing. these can be in cis (i.e., entirely composed of mRNA), in trans (i.e., composed of proteins and/or other RNAs that interact with specific mRNA sequences) the combination of the sequence at which the ribosome is paused plus the kinetic substep that is affected determines the functional output of the ribosome. mutant yeast ribosomes with altered affinities for tRNAs in the P site displayed changes in Ty1-mediated +1 PRF. these effects could be antagonized by sparsomycin, an antibiotic that increases the affinity of ribosomes for peptidyl-tRNA. +1 PRF requires skipping the first A of the 0 frame P-site codon and to instead recognize the +1 frame GUU codon. cis-acting mRNA structural elements are thought to direct ribosomes to pause at special slippery sequences. the nature of which allows re-pairing of tRNAs that are already within the ribosome to shift into a different reading frame. mRNA pseudoknot stimulation of recoding has been proposed to occur via a torsional restraint model. this model can account for how elongating ribosomes are directed to the slippery site but it does not address the actual mechanism of slippage. a mechanistic model of 1 PRF is based on observations that the mRNA pseudoknot region is \u201cpulled into\u201d the ribosome by one base during the process of aa-tRNA accommodation. tRNA unpairing and slippage of the mRNA into an alternative reading frame can be subsumed under the \u201ctension model\u201d. the downstream pseudoknot in the mRNA can impair the closing movement of the large subunit head, delaying dissociation of the translocase EF-G and the release of deacylated tRNA. cis-acting mRNA structural elements that attenuate 1 PRF activity have been described in coronaviruses. these consist of stem-loop structures located immediately 5\u2032 of the slippery site sequences. these hairpins are first unwound by elongating ribosomes as they approach the frameshift signal. trans-acting proteins stimulate translational recoding in all domains of life. synthesis of bacterial release factor 2 (RF2) requires a +1 PRF event. RF2 is required for decoding of the UGA stop codon. an additional protein, SECp43, methylates the 2\u2032-hydroxylribosyl moiety in the wobble position of the selenocysteyl-tRNA(Ser)Sec to enhance selenoprotein expression. in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, an unusual 1/2 PRF mechanism is stimulated in the absence of any apparent downstream RNA structural element. the spacing between slippery sites and downstream region of hybridization is important, supporting the idea of mRNA tension as causative. in live cells, the interaction of a microRNA (miRNA) with a 1 PRF-stimulating mRNA pseudoknot in the human CCR5 mRNA was shown to stimulate 1 PRF. many studies have shown that viruses have evolved to optimize recoding rates so as to optimize ratios of viral proteins. recoding is a potential target for antiviral therapeutics. frameshifts would direct elongating ribosomes to premature termination codons. this prompted the hypothesis that these elements might serve to limit gene expression through the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. translational recoding events are driven by cis-acting elements on mRNAs that alter the processivity kinetics of elongating ribosomes. these kinetic traps direct ribosomes to pause at a specific location on an mRNA. most studies suggest that directed pausing is critical. cis-acting mRNA structural elements contribute to defining the recoding signal. this term refers to recoding elements in which cis-acting mRNA structural elements do contribute to defining the recoding signal. for example, +1 PRF by the yeast Ty1 retrotransposable element is effected by the simple heptameric sequence CUU AGG C. +1 PRF requires skipping the first A of the 0 frame P-site codon. this is dependent on an unknown feature of the Ala-tRNAUGC. stop codons can also function as kinetic traps to drive recoding. mRNA pseudoknot stimulation of recoding has been proposed to occur via a torsional restraint model. this model can account for how elongating ribosomes are directed to the slippery site. mRNA pseudoknot stimulation of recoding has been proposed to occur via a torsional restraint model. this movement pulls the entire mRNA in the 5\u2032 direction (i.e., into the ribosome by this distance) this model is supported by ribosome toe printing studies showing that the lengths of reverse transcriptase primer extension products are reduced by one base after aa-tRNA accommodation. cis-acting mRNA structural elements that attenuate 1 PRF activity have been described in coronaviruses. cis-acting mRNA structural elements that attenuate 1 PRF activity have been described in coronaviruses. translational recoding via formation of a stem-loop after ribosome clearance is reminiscent of Rho-independent transcription termination in bacteria. the regulation of translational recoding via formation of a stem-loop after ribosome clearance is reminiscent of Rho-independent transcription termination in bacteria. prfB genes encoding RF2 in 87% of bacterial species harbor an in-frame codon located approximately 26 codons downstream from the AUG start codon. low RF2 levels enhance ribosomal pausing at the termination codon, and this kinetic pause enhances formation of a frameshift-inducing SD-like/anti-SD interaction between the ribosome and the mRNA. mRNA sequence CCCANCUCC located 11 nucleotides 3\u2032 of the GGGUUUUU shift site. a trans-acting protein binding to the mRNA impacts the output of gene expression through modulation of a frameshifting event. the proposed base-pairing interaction between the 1 PRF signal and miRNA provides the potential for sequence-specific regulation of 1 PRF. recoding is a potential target for antiviral therapeutics. drug development efforts must be tailored to specific recoding elements as opposed to a broad targeting of all recoding elements. mRNA destabilizing elements can cause elongating ribosomes to premature termination. mRNA decay (NGD) pathway was validated using endogenous 1 PRF signals in yeast. this strategy is used to control telomere maintenance in yeast. global dysregulation of 1 PRF may be linked to human diseases. high-copy episomal expression of this tRNA caused a 50-fold decrease in +1 PRF, while its deletion from the chromosome caused +1 PRF efficiency to approach 100%. biochemical studies further demonstrated that mutant yeast ribosomes with altered affinities for tRNAs in the P site displayed changes in Ty1-mediated +1 PRF. cis-acting mRNA structural elements are thought to direct ribosomes to pause at special slippery sequences. in PRF, both classes of elements are thought to direct ribosomes to pause at special slippery sequences. Shifting thus requires unpairing of the tRNAs from the initial reading frame. mRNA pseudoknot stimulation of recoding has been proposed to occur via a torsional restraint model. this model can account for how elongating ribosomes are directed to the slippery site. this model is supported by ribosome toe printing studies showing that the lengths of reverse transcriptase primer extension products are reduced by one base after aa-tRNA accommodation. this mechanism also applies to 1 PRF events that occur during translocation. the active stretching of the spacer region between the slippery site and downstream stimulatory element followed by tRNA unpairing and slippage of the mRNA into an alternative reading frame can be subsumed. cis-acting mRNA structural elements that attenuate 1 PRF activity have been described in coronaviruses. these consist of stem-loop structures located immediately 5\u2032 of the slippery site sequences. this structure can then resist the backward slippage of the ribosome caused by the 1 PRF signal. a growing list of trans-acting proteins that stimulate translational recoding in all domains of life. synthesis of bacterial release factor 2 (RF2) requires a +1 PRF event. RF2 is required for decoding of the UGA stop codon. an additional protein, SECp43, methylates the 2\u2032-hydroxylribosyl moiety in the wobble position of the selenocysteyl-tRNA(Ser)Sec to enhance selenoprotein expression. in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, an unusual 1/2 PRF mechanism is stimulated in the absence of any apparent downstream RNA structural element. hybridization of small synthetic nucleic acids to mRNAs 3\u2032 of canonical slippery sites has been demonstrated to trans-activate efficient frameshifting in vitro. the spacing between slippery sites and the downstream region of hybridization is important, supporting the idea of mRNA tension as causative. translational recoding is one solution to this problem. many viruses have evolved to optimize recoding rates. recoding is a potential target for antiviral therapeutics. analysis of 1 PRF signals located in chromosomally encoded mRNAs revealed the counterintuitive finding that >99% of all predicted frameshifts would direct elongating ribosomes to premature termination codons. this prompted the hypothesis that these elements might serve to limit gene expression through the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. elongation is critical for proper cellular function. recent studies have provided new insights into the general mechanism of translation elongation."}
