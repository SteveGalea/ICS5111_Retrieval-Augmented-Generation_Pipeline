{"summary": "the study of host-pathogen interaction is critical to the understanding of viral pathogenesis. it may shed light on the development of therapeutic approaches. viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that constantly evolve strategies to subvert their host cellular environment. cell cycle is a highly regulated process during which a cell undergoes duplication and division leading to the generation of two daughter cells. the eukaryotic cell cycle is generally divided into four stages: gap 1 phase (G1), synthesis phase (S), gap 2 phase (G2), and mitotic phase (M). a cell may enter a quiescent state called gap 0 phase (G0), during which cells are neither dividing nor preparing to divide. cytokinesis segregates the nuclei, cytoplasm, organelles, and cell membrane into two genetically identical daughter cells. cytokinesis segregates the nuclei, cytoplasm, organelles, and cell membrane into two genetically identical daughter cells. cytokinesis segregates the nuclei, cytoplasm, organelles, and cell membrane into two genetically identical daughter cells. the first cyclin-CDK holoenzyme known to be activated is composed of a D-type cyclin and either CDK4 or CDK6 depending on the cell type. the first cyclin-CDK holoenzyme known to be activated is composed of either CDK4 or CDK6 depending on the cell type. cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes phosphorylate Rb, which gets further phosphorylated by cyclin E-CDK2 complex at the mid-to-late G1 phase. hyperphosphorylation inactivates Rb and leads to the release of transcription factor E2F, which activates the transcription of other cell cycle promoting genes. further progression into S phase is driven by cyclin E-CDK2 and thereafter cyclin A-CDK2 promotes the completion cyclin B-CDK1 is one major component of the MPF complex. it can induce meiotic G2/M transition upon injection into immature oocytes. proteins that regulate chromosomal condensation, formation of mitotic spindles, and fragmentation of the golgi apparatus become the substrates of CDK1 during M phase. viral infections induce cell cycle arrest in lymphocytes to inhibit clonal expansion of anti-viral T or B lymphocytes. carcinogenic viruses are known to antagonize cell cycle checkpoints for neoplastic transformation of infected cells. elucidating mechanisms of virus-induced deregulation of host cell cycle bears both fundamental and translational relevance. et al., 2000 HIV-1/RNA plus Vpr Wee1, Cdc25C, SLX4, DDB1 G2/M arrest McGowan and Russell, 1993; Goh et al., 2004; Schr\u00f6felbauer et al., 2004; Schr\u00f6felbauer et al., 2007; Laguette et al., 2014 HBV/circular DNA HBx DDB1 Delayed S phase progression Leupin et ovirus/dsRNA p17 CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, Cyclin A1, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E1 Cell growth retardation, enhanced replication Chiu et al., 2018 Influenza A/RNA minus M2 Cyclin D3 Cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 He et al., 2010 Adenovirus/dsDNA E1A p27KIP1 Impairment of p27KIP1 inhibition on CDK2 Mal Binding of tax and HBx proteins to cyclin and/or CDK promotes cell cycle progression either by enhancing kinase activity and/or weakening the inhibitory effect of CKI. HTLV-1 Tax is also able to interact with p16INK4A and relieve p16INK4A-imposed blockage of G1 to S transition. p21WAF1/CIP1 can block the interaction between Cdc25C and PCNA. competition between core protein of hepatitis C virus and PCNA may disrupt PCNA-p21WAF1/CIP1 binding, leading to impaired cell cycle arrest in G2 and DNA repair. deficient in tax-binding exhibit much lesser thymidine incorporation. a binding-deficient Tax variant failed to stimulate CDK4-cyclin D complex formation. a binding-deficient Tax variant lost its ability to antagonize the inhibitory effect of CKI p21WAF1/CIP1. p30 blocks G1/S transition in contrast to the neoplastic effect of Tax. p30 expressing cells is hindered due to the interaction of p30 with both cyclin E and CDK2. infection of influenza A virus (IAV) has been reported to induce host cell cycle G0/G1 phase accumulation. the inhibitory effect of cyclin D3 on IAV infection is due to its interaction with viral M2 protein. cyclin D3-M2 interaction masks the domain on M2 mediating binding to M1 or has a higher affinity than that between M1 and M2. the virus evolved strategies to counteract the inhibition imposed by cyclinD3 resulting in hampered cell cycle progression. the adenovirus early region 1A protein displays the ability to bind multiple host factors for the manipulation of cell cycle progression. Binding of E1A to p27KIP1 blocks its inhibitiononCDK2 kinase activity. HTLV-1 Tax is also able to interact with p16INK4A and relieve p16INK4A blockage of G1 to S transition. tax directly antagonizes p16INK4A and p15INK4B through protein-protein interaction. it uses a different mechanism to repress p18INK4C transcription. p21WAF1/CIP1 could block the interaction between cell division cycle 25C (Cdc25C), a phosphatase of CDK1 that activates the CDK1/cyclin B1 complex. Retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, which serves as the guardian of restriction point, represents a non-redundant checkpoint that can be targeted by viruses to modulate host cell cycle under growth limiting conditions. adenovirus E1A also functions to dissociate E2F-Rb/p107 complexes owing to its interaction of its two conserved regions (CRs) with Rb. nuclear antigen 5 (EBNA-5), also known as nuclear antigen leader protein (EBNA-LP), of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) cooperates with its nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2) to prompt G0 to G1 progression during the immortalization of virus-infected cells. the carboxy-terminal 45 amino acids of EBNA-5 are crucial for B cell transformation. EBNA-5 binding inhibits EBNA-5-Rb complex formation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. however, inhibition of p53-EBNA-5 interaction by Rb was not observed in a reciprocal experiment. a correlation was still observed between the kinetics of BRLF1-Rb binding and the displacement of E2F1 from Rb. Park et al. showed that Cdc25A degradation and p53 phosphorylation were attenuated by Tax expression in a dose-dependent manner. the effect of Tax on the kinase activity of Chk2 is controversial. tax-induced constitutive signaling of the DNA-PK pathway impairs cellular response to new damage. delay and impairment of the cellular DNA damage response imposed by Tax appears to be regulated by molecular sequestration of DNA-PK by Tax through physical interaction. amphenicol (CAT) assay demonstrated that L-Tag inhibits the transactivation function of p53. complex formation between HPV E6 and p53 leads to a drastic reduction (more than 80%) in the level of p53-mediated transactivation. HCMV IE2-86 is able to repress p53 function via physical interaction. binding of NS3 to p53 interferes with the formation of p53 tetramer. this leads to impaired p53-dependent transcriptional activation. adenovirus E1A targets p53-mediated transcription through interacting with the transcriptional coactivators p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) of p53. wee1 blocks G2toM transition by phosphorylating CDK1, whereas Cdc25 triggers this transition and entry into mitosis by dephosphorylating the same residues on CDK1. this binding was mapped to a site that lies near but is distinct from the catalytic domain of Cdc25C (Goh et al., 2004). formation of a heterodimeric structure-specific endonuclease consisted of MUS81 and EME1. binding of Vpr to SLX4 activates the MUS81-EME1 endonuclease. simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Vprs fail to interact with SLX4. the association of Vpr with DDB1 disrupts complex formation between DDB1 and DDB2. it is a prerequisite for DNA repair. it will be of interest to investigate whether the association of Vpr with DDB1 could antagonize its role in the hydrolysis of p27KIP1 and other cell cycle effectors. HTLV-1 to cyclin D1/D3 was observed in transfected cells by co-immunoprecipitation. this interaction is implicated in the ability of Tax to promote progression through S phase. a binding-deficient Tax variant failed to stimulate CDK4-cyclin D complex formation. direct binding of the K-bZIP protein of KSHV to CDK2, cyclin A, or cyclin E has been demonstrated using purified proteins. these interactions impair the kinase activity of CDK2, leading to extended G1 duration. p30 blocks G1/S transition in contrast to neoplastic effect of tax. cyclin D3 restricts IAV production independent of its role in cell cycle. the biogenesis of viral particles involves proper packaging and assembly of viral proteins and RNA to form intact virions. cyclin D3-M2 interaction masks the domain on M2 mediating binding to M1 or has a higher affinity than that between M1 and M2. interaction of p17 with CDK1 inhibits the kinase activity of the latter. p17 could also suppress CKD4 and CDK2 kinase activities by direct binding to CDKs, partner cyclins, and CDK/cyclin complexes. p17 could also suppress CKD4 and CKD4 kinase activities. tax restores p16INK4A-CDK4 activity through interaction with p15INK4B, further contributing to the immortalization of T cells. p21WAF1/CIP1 could block the interaction between cell division cycle 25C (Cdc25C), a phosphatase of CDK1 that activates the CDK1/cyclin B1 complex. other examples of viral protein-mediated inhibition of CKIs include the E7 oncoprotein of HPV-16 and the immediate-early (IE) protein IE2-86 of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) the association of the SV40 large T-antigen (L-Tag) with Rb, p107, and p130 is attributed to the viral LXCXE residues. it was reported that the N-terminus of L-Tag, which shares sequence homology with the J domain of heat shock protein 40 (HSP40), is also required to disrupt the complex formation between the three \u201cpocket\u201d proteins of the Rb family with E2F. p53 competes with Rb for EBNA-5 binding as it inhibits EBNA-5-Rb complex formation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. however, inhibition of p53-EBNA-5 interaction by Rb was not observed in a reciprocal experiment. tax of HTLV-1 is also known to interact with Chk. expression of Tax inhibits the kinase activity of Chk1. effect of Tax on the kinase activity of Chk2 is controversial. tax-induced constitutive signaling of the DNA-PK pathway impairs cellular response to new damage. the delay and impairment of the cellular DNA damage response imposed by Tax appears to be regulated by molecular sequestration by Tax through physical interaction. p53 was first identified as a host protein that stably interacts with the L-Tag of SV40 (Lane and Crawford, 1979; Linzer and Levine, 1979; Tan et al., 1986). the use of chloramphenicol (CAT) assay demonstrated that L-Tag inhibits the transactivation function of p53, which is mediated through physical interaction. binding of NS3 to p53 interferes with the formation of p53 tetramer. adenovirus E1A targets p53-mediated transcription through interacting with the transcriptional coactivators p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) of p53. expression of influenza A virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) downregulates protein level and inhibits the function of the Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA), a small GTPase that, besides its primary involvement with formation of actin stress fibers and cytoskeletal remodeling, mediates cell cycle G1/S transition. wee1 blocks G2toM transition by phosphorylating the latter on Tyr15. Vpr targets CDK1 to mediate G2/M arrest acting on both Wee1 and Cdc25C. a scaffold for the formation of a heterodimeric structure-specific endonuclease consisted of MUS81 and EME1. binding of Vpr to SLX4 activates the MUS81-EME1 endonuclease, leading to replication stress. it is known that Vpr hampers the nuclear localization of DDB1 and interferes with the binding of DDB1 to damaged DNA as detected by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) the association of Vpr with DDB1 disrupts complex formation between DDB1 and DDB2, which is a prerequisite for DNA repair. Virus/Genome Viral protein Host protein Functional consequence References HIV-1/RNA plus Vpr Phosphorylation of ATM and Chk2 S phase arrest Baer et al., 2012 HBV/circular DNA Phosphorylation of ATM and Chk2 CDK1 inactivation with ensuing G2/M arrest Ahn et al., 2000. HCMV IE1-72 is a viral protein kinase able to directly and selectively phosphorylate transcription factors of the E2F family (E2F1,2, and3). expression of viral S1 gene-encoded 1s nonstructural protein during reovirus infection leads to G2/M arrest in host cells via 1s-mediated CDK1 hyperphosphorylation. HCMV UL97 protein is the first example of a virus-encoded functional ortholog of CDK. phosphorylation onThr172 is required to catalyze the process. kinase activity is required for IE1-72-mediatedformation. the kinase activity of IE1-72 resides in the portion encoded by exon 4. it is possible that this interaction functions as the first step to bridge IE1-72 to its target for later phosphorylation. IE1-72 can independently exert its role in cell cycle regulation. UL24 in herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), ORF20 in KSHV, and UL76 in HCMV. expression of UL24 proteins led to CDK1 phosphorylation at Tyr15. dephosphorylation required for the initiation of mitosis. ICP0 leads to CDK1 inactivation with ensuing G2/M arrest. ATM and Chk2 phosphorylation are required for RVFV-induced S phase arrest. infection of a hepatocyte cell line with HBV causes phosphorylation. the current model of CDK/cyclin activation posits two steps: formation of an intermediate complex composed by the PSTAIRE helix of CDK2 and helices 3 and 5 of the cyclin. CDK2/CDK4 phosphorylation at their respective Thr sites by CAK subunits, for example CDK7/cyclin H (Fisher and Morgan, 1994), is essential for both the stabilization of CDK/cyclin complexes. HCMV IE1-72 is a viral protein kinase. it is required for IE1-72-mediatedformation and/or dissociation of inhibitory complexes that lead to E2F-dependent transcriptional activation. it is possible that this interaction functions as the first step to bridge IE1-72 to its target for later phosphorylation, or that IE1-72 can independently exert its role in cell cycle regulation. CDK1/Cdc25 Reovirus infection and the sole expression of viral S1 gene-encoded 1s nonstructural protein could lead to G2/M arrest in host celosia 1s-mediated CDK1 hyperphosphorylation. human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6)-induced G2/M arrest correlate with enhanced phosphorylation of CDK1 at the Tyr15 inhibitory site. ICP0 activates Chk2, but not Chk1, through Thr68 phosphorylation. this activation relies on ICP0-dependent phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), an upstream effector kinase of Chk2. Activated Chk2 in turn phosphorylates Cdc25 on Ser216, which promotes binding of the molecule to 14-3-3 proteins. Chk1 phosphorylation on Ser345 is essential for the activation of checkpoint arrest in G2/M phase. phosphorylation at Ser345 is required in G2/M arrest induced by HIV-1 Vpr. phosphorylation-resistant Chk1 mutant fails to restore Vpr-induced G2/M arrest in Chk1-depleted cells. CDK2/CDK4 phosphorylation at their respective Thr sites by CAK subunits, for example CDK7/cyclin H (Fisher and Morgan, 1994), is essential for both the stabilization of CDK/cyclin complexes. overexpression of the ARV p17 protein inhibited CDK2 phosphorylation at T160, which was dependent on CDK7/cyclin H disassociation due to increased p53/cyclin H interaction. in G2 Izumi et al., 2010 HBV/circular DNA HBx Upregulation of USP37 transcripts Accumulation of cyclin A and acceleration of the G1/S phase transition Saxena and Kumar, 2014 HBV/circular DNA HBx Reduction of Notch cleavage Induction of G1-S cell cycle progression Wang et al., 2010 HSV-1/dsDNA ICP0 CENP-C, CENP-A proteasome the degradation of securin by the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is essential for the completion of mitosis. the oncoprotein Tax of HTLV-1 is able to promote securin and cyclin B1 degradation, leading to chromosome instability. p21WAF1/CIP1 RNA and protein levels were observed after HCMV infection. infection could induce sustained increase in calpain activity. the molecular mechanism by which p21WAF1/CIP1 is targeted by calpain is not clear. et al. showed that expression of Vif could directly interact with p53. this could lead to a partial blockage of p53-MDM2 binding. this could lead to cell cycle arrest in G2. the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) was characterized as a securin- and cyclin B-specific ubiquitin ligase, functioning mainly to trigger metaphase to anaphase transition by tagging these proteins for degradation. the degradation of securin by APC/C is essential for the completion of mitosis. tax stabilizes p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1 by targeting the E3 ligase of p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1 for degradation. HBx of HBV could upregulate USP37 transcripts in both hepatic and non-hepatic cells. HBx-mediated downregulation of presenilin 1, a catalytic subunit of the large protease complex -secretase which mediates the cleavage of Notch 1. viruses could also encode their own degradation enzymes. the zinc-binding RING finger domain of ICP0 of HSV-1 possesses a ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. acute japanese encephalitis virus leads to cell cycle G0/G1 arrest with elevated p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1 levels. however, expression of these CKIs and GSK-3, which mediates the degradation of cyclin D, is suppressed. Enterovirus 71 (EV71), the etiological agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease, was shown to prevent cell cycle transition from S to G2/M phase influenza A virus infection perturbs cell cycle progression by redistributing cyclin D3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. cyclin D3 needs to be imported into the nucleus to assist G0/G1 cell cycle progression. expression of HIV-1 Vpr induces localized-disruption in the lamin architecture, resulting in G2/M arrest that is dependent on cytoplasmic compartmentalization of Cdc25C, cyclin B1 and Wee1. viruses have also evolved mechanisms to deregulate cell cycle progression by targeting the localization of cell cycle regulators. the cell cycle perturbation effect results from NS1-mediated downregulation of activating E2Fs transcription factors (E2F1 to E2F3a) and upregulation of repressive E2Fs (E2F4 to E2F8) co-immunoprecipitation experiments in NS1 expressing cells identified NS1-E2F4 and NS1-E2F5 complexes. a reduction of p53 level in nuclear extracts of HCMV-infected human umbilical vein endothelial cells was observed. the reduced nuclear-translocation of p53 by HCMV provides a plausible explanation for the oncogenic potential of HCMV. HCMV could also inhibit the function of nuclear p53 through sequestering it into discrete foci. nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is associated with overexpression and accumulation of p53. the late membrane protein 1 (LMP1) of EBV upregulates expression and phosphorylation of p53 and survivin. expression of HIV-1 Vpr could induce localized-disruption in the lamin architecture. Vpr could mediate protein assembly among 14-3-3, Cdc25C, CDK1 and cyclin B1, leading to G2/M arrest by either sequestering Cdc25 in the cytoplasm or impairing the normal association of 14-3-3 with centrosomal proteins. HHV-6A and HHV-6B provide other examples of mislocalization coupled to cell cycle arrest. the relevance of E2F1 translocation in HHV-6-induced cell cycle arrest is not completely understood. it illustrates that viruses could also target E2F family of protein in this context. subversion by virus-encoded homologs of cell cycle regulators. several gammaherpesviruses encode viral-cyclins (v-cyclin) that display strong association with CDK6, leading to the phosphorylation of Rb and histone H1. failure or weak association of p21WAF1/CIP1, p27KIP1 and p16INK4A with v-cyclin likely defines inefficiency of these CKI to inhibit them. gammaherpesvirus saimiri (HVS) encodes the first reported viral-cyclin (v-cyclin) the gammaherpesvirus saimiri (HVS), a T-lymphotropic gamma-herpesvirus, encodes the first reported viral-cyclin (v-cyclin) Herpesvirus ateles (AtHV-2) causes lethal lymphomas in various new world primates. v-cyclins of HVS and KSHV bind almost exclusively to CDK6. ectopic expression of KSHV v-cyclin abolishes cell cycle arrest effect imposed by Rb. cyclin D1-CDK complexes are significantly more resistant to the inhibition imposed by p21WAF1/CIP1, p27KIP1 and p16INK4A than cyclin D1-CDK complexes in vitro. lack or weak association of p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1 with v-cyclin likely defines the inefficiency of these CKI to inhibit them. p27KIP1 phosphorylation on Ser10 by KSHV v-cyclin-CDK6 complex enhances its cytoplasmic dislocation. CDK2 associated with v-cyclin of MHV68 exhibits substantial resistance to both p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1. v-cyclin of MHV68 is only able to subvert p27KIP1-imposed arrest. walleye dermal sarcoma virus (WDSV) and WEHV are retroviruses that encode human D-type cyclin homologs. WDSV rv-cyclins induce cell cycle progression in cyclin-deficient yeast. other viruses have been shown to interact with subunits of the Mediator complex. alpha-herpes virus targets the MED25 subunit of Mediator through its major transactivator protein, immediate early gene 62 (IE62) herpes simplex virus utilizes VP16, which controls the transcription of immediate early genes, to activate transcription through a specific MED25-associated mediator deficient in CDK8. both crocodile and squirrel poxviruses encode a RING-H2 protein. poxvirus hinders normal cell cycle progression by encoding an inactive homolog of APC11. Virus/Genome Viral protein Host protein Functional consequence References Parvovirus minute virus of mice /ssDNA NS1 Chromatin Nicks affecting integrity, cell cycle arrest in S phase Op De Beeck et al., 1995; Op De Beeck and Caillet-Fauquet, 1997 HIV-1/RNA plus Vpr Chromatin Activation of it has been proposed that the activation of ATR-dependent DNA damage G2/M checkpoint by Vpr involves the direct binding of this viral protein to chromatin. it increases the association of replication protein A (RPA) with chromatin, an upstream event required for ATR activation. the NS1 of the autonomous parvovirus minute virus of mice is another example of viral protein that affects the integrity of chromatin. infection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) leads to accumulation of cells with 4N DNA content in p53-competent cells, whereas it induces apoptosis in p53-deficient cells. inoculation of UV-inactivated virus or a nonreplicative mutant virus phenocopied the G2/M arrest induced by MVC infection. however, the use of a series of mutant constructs indicated the terminal repeats of its genome are essential in the G2/M arrest feature of MVC. other than viral proteins and genome, virus-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated to play a role in regulating host cell cycle. MV HA or fusion protein (F) antibodies revealed that these viral proteins are responsible for the suppression of T-cell proliferation. MV takes a free ride on DCs to reach draining lymph nodes and subverts the normal function of DCs to inhibit T-cell proliferation. this infection-independent action in T cells results in accumulation of cells in G0/G1 owing to the inhibition of PI3K signaling. expression of membrane-anchored capsid anaC, structural envelope E, membrane M proteins, and nonstructural protein 4A (NS4A) could trigger G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. the NS4A induces growth restriction via the target of rapamycin (TOR) cellular stress pathway. a viral gene product with a host protein to disarm its function has been adopted by many viruses as a common strategy to exploit host cell cycle. viruses stop at nothing and use any means necessary to survive in a hostile environment by inducing posttranslational modifications and dislocating host restriction factors to modulate their function and/or degradation."}
