{"summary": "attenuated measles virus (MV) represents an attractive vector candidate for virotherapy and vaccination. many of the attenuated strains in use are derived from the MV Edmonston strain (MV-Edm) isolated in 1954 from the throat washings and blood of a child with measles, in a primary culture of human kidney cells. greb strain more attenuated than MV-Edm has fewer substitutions. despite their divergent passage histories, it is possible that similar cell culture conditions may have resulted in similar nucleotide substitutions. additional passages on CEF 42*Schwarz and Moraten strains have identical nucleotide sequences CD46 \u2013 CD150 \u2013 Nectin 4 1968Use as vaccine in the USA, Attenuvax\u00ae, M-M-R\u00ae II. ten\u00ae Berna vaccine, University of Zurich, Berna Biotech, Switzerland, can be applied parenterally or as aerosol vaccine Other measles vaccines were derived from wild-type progenitors isolated independently in Russia (Leningrad-4), Japan (CAM-70), and China (Shangai-191). activities involving manipulation of GM viral vectors in contained conditions may comply with Directive 2009/41/EC. activities involving their deliberate release into the environment require that a case-by-case environmental risk assessment (ERA) should be carried out before release according the principles defined in annex II of Directive 2001/18/EC. MV-infected lymphocytes migrate into the lung tissue from the blood vessels. this causes extensive epithelial damage and apical shedding of MV resulting in transmission to the next host. human primates can also be infected and are commonly used as model of infection. measles virus has a cytoplasmic replication cycle eliminating the possibility of integration into the host cell DNA and then a possible insertional mutagenesis. MV is susceptible to a variety of disinfectants (e.g., povidone iodine, 1% sodium hypochlorite, peracetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, 70% Ethanol) CD46 is ubiquitously expressed at low density by all normal human cell types except erythrocytes. high CD46 receptor density on tumor cells is a key determinant of oncolytic specificity of attenuated MV strains. the third MV receptor is expressed abundantly in placental trophoblasts, glandular cells of the stomach, and adenocarcinomas of the lung, breast and ovary. small amounts are expressed in the adherens junctions, on the basolateral side of epithelial cells in close contact to infected MV lymphocytes and dendritic cells. the MV vectors have been produced as reported by Radecke et al. Target disease Transgenic expressed proteins Administration route Measles dosage level Clinical trials Parental strain Reference(s) Recurrent ovariancancer CEA; NIS; NIS (MV-NIS transduced mesenchymal stem cells) the vectors used to develop attenuated recombinant MV for vaccination against infectious diseases have been engineered by reverse genetics from different measles vaccine strains. additional transcription units were introduced in the viral genome in order to construct the vector expressing the sequences corresponding to foreign antigens. monkeys Schwarz vector 63, 64 Nipah virus (NiV) NiV glycoprotein i.p.

HT studies with excess mortality rates showed increased female mortality rates that could be due to environmental or contextual conditions. encodes 8 proteins: 2 non-structural proteins (V and C), a phosphoprotein (P), the large polymerase protein (L), the large polymerase protein (L) and the nucleoprotein (N) forming the viral nucleocapsid which contains the viral RNA genome, the matrix protein (M), the hemagglutinin protein (H) and the fusion protein (F) responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion respectively. measles (Rubeola) is one of the most contagious viral diseases known. it is efficiently transmitted by aerosols entering the respiratory tract or by direct contact with respiratory secretions. one person infected with MV can infect 15 to 20 others (R0 = 11\u201318) attenuated measles virus generation Attenuation of MV strains is the result of adaptation of the virus to growth conditions in non-permissive cell culture. the use of CD46 by some MV strains may be considered as an in vitro adaptation rather than in vivo property of those strains. MV strains that have acquired the ability to use CD46 as a receptor may gain a growth advantage in vivo in human and monkey cells. in vitro, attenuated MV has a wider tropism than wt MV as it can use both CD46 and CD150 as cellular receptors to enter host cells. Nectin-4 is expressed abundantly in placental trophoblasts, glandular cells of the stomach, and adenocarcinomas of oncolytic activities of MV have been demonstrated for at least 12 different cancer types. attenuated MV has been used worldwide to vaccinate children with an excellent safety profile and with no reversion to the wt MV. attenuated oncolytic MV vectors retain some characteristics enabling them to replicate in the human host. compared to replication defective viral vectors, the likelihood of exposure of the patient is increased.

MV infects cells of the immune system, including macrophages and DCs, thus providing an opportunity to deliver antigens directly to the most effective antigen presenting cells, a major advantage for a vaccine vector. recombinant MV (MV1-F4) used to immunize healthy people against chikungunya virus is ongoing25 and the results of a phase I clinical trial with the vaccine candidate (MV-CHIK) are now available. risk assessment should also take into account potential risk associated with the transgene. MV-CHIK has been administered as vaccine candidate in healthy adults. the results of a phase I trial showed that MV-CHIK is safe and had an overall acceptable tolerability profile when administrated. expression of NIS allows cells to actively transport ions into the cell. it may be used as therapeutic transgene capable of further increasing the oncolytic potency of MV-NIS by facilitating intracellular entry of radioisotopes. in a phase I clinical trial, MV-NIS has been administered by intraperitoneal route in 16 patients and no dose-limiting toxicity was observed. negative for prior measles exposure received the highest feasible dose level (1011 TCID50, 50% tissue culture infectious dose) negative for prior measles exposure received the highest feasible dose level (1011 TCID50, 50% tissue culture infectious dose) they became febrile, tachycardic and hypotensive with severe nausea and vomiting. retargeted attenuated MV Edm vector lack neurotoxic activity even when administered directly to the CNS of measles-nave IFN type I receptor deficient. transgenic mice do not express human receptors. Intracerebral administration mice Edmonston vaccine lineage NSe strain CD20. 99 Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) Human IL-13, GFP Interleukin-13-receptor 2 (IL-13R2) 100 Glioblastoma multiforme a single chain antibody recognizing EGFR, GFP Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or EGFRvIII (the most common EGFR mutant) the virus was rescued using the pseudoreceptor STAR (6 His tagging and retargeting) system. the viral H protein contains the CD46-ablating mutation Y481A and the SLAM-ablatting mutation R533A. it also contains the GFP which facilitates viral rescue and allows visualization of infection in vitro and in vivo. the presence of maternal anti-MV antibodies has been shown to limit the induction of humoral but not CMI responses in immunized infants. in another study, mice with recombinant MV-SARS vector developed SARS-specific immune responses in the presence of anti-MV antibodies. recombinant vectors MV-CEA and MV-NIS should also be classified in class of risk 1 based on the class of risk of the recombinant virus. there is no reason to think that the presence of CEA and NIS could change the safety profile of the recombinant virus. the vaccine candidate MV1-F4 has been developed by reverse genetics from the cDNA of the Schwarz strain. protein alone has been administered as vaccine candidate by intramuscular route to healthy HIV seronegative adults. MV-CEA expresses the soluble N-terminal domain of human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) ed by intraperitoneal route in 21 patients and no dose-limiting toxicity was observed. CEA expression allows non-invasive monitoring of viral gene expression but does not provide any information about the anatomic localization of virally infected cells. MV has been modified to express another reporter protein, the sodium iodide symporter (NIS) no treatment-related lesions were seen in any of the animals at the time of necropsy. a phase I clinical trial was therefore initiated to determine the maximum tolerated dose of intravenously administrated MV-NIS in patients with advanced refractory multiple myeloma. single-chain antibody (single chain fragment variable, scFv) or naturally occurring ligand to the virus attachment H glycoprotein displayed on the virus surface allows entry only into cells expressing the receptor for the scFv or ligand linked to H. uPAR, CD46, CD150 98 Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) CD-20 targeted MV vector expressing the prodrug convertase purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) CD20 (B-cell specific antigen CD20) Intracerebral administration mice Edmonston vaccine lineage NSe strain IL-13R2. iv mice cDNAs of the virulent IC-B strain isolated in a lymphoid cell line, B95a2 CD46-CD150-EGFR 103 Ovarian cancer MV-FV: a single-chain antibody (scFv) specific for -folate receptor Folate receptor Sc, ip Mice Edmonston vaccine lineage NSe strain Folate receptor. the virus is derived from the Edmonston vaccine lineage NS MV vaccine strains demonstrate high genetic stability even after prolonged replication in human host. many studies have shown that revaccinating already immunized individuals results in a boost of anti-MV antibodies. however, the presence of maternal anti-MV antibodies has been shown to limit the induction of humoral but not CMI responses. recombinant vectors MV-CEA and MV-NIS should also be classified in class of risk 1 based on the class of risk of the Edm B strain used as vector backbone. there is no reason to think that the presence of CEA and NIS could change the safety profile of the recombinant virus. wild-type MV strains use the CD150 receptor expressed on lymphocytes, thymocytes, macrophages and mature DCs cells and Nectin-4 receptor expressed on epithelial cells. infection with wt MV has been thought to begin by infection of DCs in the respiratory tract followed by lymphoid organs. wt MV caused viremia and was disseminated to lymphoid tissues, the respiratory submucosa, and the skin. some mechanism must operate in vivo to suppress the growth of the virus capable of using CD46 as receptor. the standard route of administration of live-attenuated MV vaccine has not been evaluated in this study. MV viral RNA was only detected at day 11, the expected peak of viremia in some biological fluids samples from few immunized monkeys. however, none of these samples contained infectious virus. the introduction of HIV F4 fusion protein did not alter the tropism of the parental strain or its shedding capacity. MV-NIS is administered by intravenous route with or without pretreatment with cyclophosphamide. cyclophosphamide is an immunosuppressive agent. it can prolong and enhance viral dissemination and replication in the tumor. measles virus is very rapidly degraded in the environment. the consequences of dissemination will depend on the characteristics of the recombinant vector itself. direct exposure may result from accidental inoculation of personnel. wild-type MV strains use the CD150 receptor expressed on lymphocytes, thymocytes, macrophages and mature DCs cells. infection with wt MV has been thought to begin by infection of DCs in the respiratory tract followed by lymphoid organs. in natural infection, MV can also be isolated from urine up to 10 d after rash onset. intramuscular vaccination of macaques with a MV Edmonston-Zagreb strain showed that muscle cells were not infected. dendritic cells and macrophages were the predominantly target cells. shedding of MV vaccine strains is limited. the introduction of HIV F4 fusion protein did not alter the tropism of the parental strain or its shedding capacity. no alteration in tropism is expected for the same vector containing the genes coding for structural proteins from chikungunya virus. cyclophosphamide is an immunosuppressive agent. it can prolong and enhance viral dissemination and replication in the tumor. in two patients with advanced refractory multiple myeloma treated. measles virus is very rapidly degraded in the environment. the consequences of dissemination will depend on the characteristics of the recombinant vector itself. direct exposure may result from accidental inoculation of personnel during the treatment of the patient via droplets or aerosols. transduction of recombinant MV-NIS cells by recombinant MV-NIS should be carried out in a CL-2. the presence of adventitious contaminating agents constitutes the main hazard. personnel should wear protective clothing to prevent or manage risks. recombinant MV is a human virus with no known animal reservoir. there is no risk for animals and plants. attenuated MV is now widely used as recombinant vector. recombinant attenuated MV vectors belong to class of risk 1 for humans. these MV vectors belong to class of risk 1 for humans. authors thank Dr. Amaya Leunda, Dr. Katia Pauwels, Dr. Didier Breyer, Dr. Martine Goossens and Dr. Alexandre Dobly."}
