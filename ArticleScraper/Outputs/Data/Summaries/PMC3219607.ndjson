{"summary": "virus emergence is a complex, multilevel problem that results from a combination of ecological and genetic factors [5]\u2013[7]. a pre-requisite for viral emergence is the existence of standing genetic variation within the reservoir host that enables successful virus replication within nave hosts after spillover by chance. host-range mutants have high fitness in the new host but pay fitness penalties in the reservoir host [10]\u2013[13]. this fitness trade-offs should also preclude the evolution of generalist, multi-host viruses [11], [13]\u2013[15]. a mechanism promoting host specialization is the accumulation of neutral mutations in the genes that are not necessary in a given host but are essential in alternative hosts. DMFEs characterized are left-skewed (i.e., containing more negative values than the Gaussian distribution) and leptokurtic (i.e., comprising less central values than the Gaussian distribution) the probability density functions that better fitted the data were from the heavy-tailed family (Log-normal or Weibull) Remold and Lenski proposed using a collection of mutant genotypes that differ from the wildtype in a single and well defined mutation. GE interactions were quite common even for genotypes that differed by only one mutation and across environments that differed in a single component. the other three species belong to two plant families, the Asteraceae (Helianthus annuus) and the Amaranthaceae (Gomphrena globosa and Spinacea oleracea) both the Solanaceae and the Asteraceae are within the Asterids, while the Amaranthaceae are not [27] the average absolute fitness effect of all genotypes together was undistinguishable in these two hosts (Mann-Whitney test, P = 0.232) both distributions are significantly leptokurtic (e.g., Gaussian-like) DMFEs are more peaked than expected for a Gaussian distribution. a comparison of absolute fitness values between Solanaceae and non-Solanaceae hosts indicates that the difference is highly significant. negative skewness means that the tail of the distribution containing fitness effects higher than the mean is significantly heavier than the negative tail. Host species belong to the taxonomic families Solanaceae, Asteraceae and Amaranthaceae. the first two families belong to the Asterids class. 0.018 0.039 0.053 1.479** 1.915 0 0 17 3 t-test significance levels for skewness and kurtosis. compared the absolute fitness of each mutant to that of the wildtype TEV on each alternative host. mutations were classified into lethal, deleterious, neutral, and beneficial (i.e., significantly larger absolute fitness than wildtype) on each alternative host. in recent years, increasing evidence supports the notion that, for compacted RNA genomes, synonymous mutations are not necessarily neutral mutations [20], [28]. this observation is most likely due to the existence of secondary RNA structures essential for regulating gene expression, and the pressure for evading RNAi-based host defenses. out of 171 plants inoculated with viable viruses, 72 plants were infected. the failure rate was 1\u201372/171 = 0.579 per inoculation event. in a sample of 21 genotypes, we expect less than one case to be assigned to the category of lethal mutations. a weibull pdf is described by two parameters, the scale and the shape, related to the expected value of the distribution as, where ( is the gamma function evaluated at the given argument. however, the Akaike's weight for this pdf is 0.95 in all cases, suggesting alternative models can still contribute to better describe the observed distributions. annuum Laplace location = 0.2530.010 0.223 0.521 0.842 5.495 (Weibull) scale b = 0.1040.019 S. lycopersicum Weibull scale = 0.1040.019. ER measures how many times the best fitting model is more likely than the model ranked in second. we used an evidence ratio (ER) computed as the likelihood of the best model divided by the likelihood of the alternative model of interest. the weibull pdf is the best descriptor in five out of eight host species. in the case of C. annuum, the Weibull was ranked as the second best fitting, performing only 5.5 times worse than the Laplace pdf. the skewness of the DMFE shifts from negative to positive as hosts become more phylogenetically distant from the natural one. the phylogenetic distance did not significantly affect the variance and kurtosis of the distributions. only 2.76% of the observed variance remained unexplained by the model and was used as error variance in the computation of the different variance components. a maximum-likelihood estimator. a binary factor belongs to one of two classes (Solanaceae vs. non-Solanaceae) the GE component was evaluated by looking the significance of the interaction between hosts within classes and TEV genotype. the genetic component only explains a minor fraction of observed fitness variance. the difference in correlation signs among host classes was significant (P = 0.029) despite the small sample size. the shift from negatively skewed DMFE (excess of deleterious effects) in the non-Solanaceae to positively skewed distributions in the non-Solanaceae is also consistent with antagonistic pleiotropy. the most extreme cases of antagonistic pleiotropy are mutations that were viable in N. tabacum but le for each mutation on each host, we recorded whether fitness was lower (negative sign) or higher (positive sign) than the wildtype TEV. if a mutation has the same sign both in the primary and in the alternative hosts, it is considered not to be pleiotropic. if sign changes, it is considered as pleiotropic. lycopersicum hosts ranged from 0.051 to 0.115, with an average value of 0.083, and explaining >95% of the observed phenotypic variance. for these hosts only ca. 25% of phenotypic variance for absolute fitness was explained by genetic differences among TEV mutants. a collection of 21 TEV genotypes was drawn from a larger collection of mutants obtained by Carrasco et al. [20]. each mutant contained a single nucleotide change whose position and substitution were chosen at random. in 14 cases, the mutation resulted in an amino acid substitution. the average absolute fitness effect of all genotypes together was undistinguishable in these two hosts (Mann-Whitney test, P = 0.232) both distributions are significantly leptokurtic (e.g., Gaussian-like) DMFEs are more peaked than expected for a Gaussian distribution. negative skewness means that the tail of the distribution containing fitness effects higher than the mean is significantly heavier than the negative tail. this finding is particularly interesting when observed that the fitness of the wildtype is always in the negative tail of the distribution. the ancestral isolate used in this study was obtained from and passed in N. tabacum plants. the vertical dashed lines represent the fitness value of the wildtype genotype in each host. 1.915 0 0 17 3 t-test significance levels for skewness and kurtosis. we compared the absolute fitness of each mutant to that of the wildtype TEV on each alternative host. mutations were classified into lethal, deleterious, neutral, and beneficial (i.e., significantly larger absolute fitness than wildtype) on each alternative host. in recent years, increasing evidence supports the notion that synonymous mutations are not necessarily neutral mutations. this observation is most likely due to the existence of secondary RNA structures essential for regulating gene expression, and the pressure for evading RNAi-based host defenses. the above classification of viable mutants into deleterious, neutral or beneficial depends on whether their fitness values deviates significantly from that of the wildtype TEV. oculated with viable viruses, 72 plants were infected. the failure rate was 1\u201372/171 = 0.579 per inoculation event. in a sample of 21 genotypes, we expect less than one case to be erroneously assigned to the category of lethal mutations. FEs measured in N. tabacum, N. benthamiana, D. stramonium, S. lycopersicum, and G. globosa. a weibull pdf is described by two parameters, the scale and the shape. however, the Akaike's weight for this pdf is 0.95 in all cases. weibull scale = 0.3230.002 0.311 0.643 0.849 4.990 (Laplace) shape = 12.9922.317 C. annuum Laplace location = 0.2530.010 0.223 0.521 0.842 5.495 (Weibull) scale b = 0.1040.019 S. lycopersicum Weibull scale = 0.3240.004 0.300 0.479 0.873 2.514 (Normal) shape = 5.7740.785 H. the weibull pdf is the best descriptor in five out of eight host species. in the case of C. annuum, the Weibull was ranked as the second best fitting. in the case of S. oleracea, the Weibull pdf ranked in seventh position. the skewness of the DMFE shifts from negative to positive as hosts become more phylogenetically distant from the natural one. the phylogenetic distance did not significantly affect the variance and kurtosis of the distributions. two generalized lineal models testing the effect of TEV genetic background (G), host species (E) and their interaction (GE) were used as error variance in the computation of the different variance components. the GE component was evaluated by looking the significance of the interaction between hosts within classes and TEV genotype. the genetic component only explains a minor fraction of observed fitness variance whereas most of it is explained by the GE interaction term. the difference in correlation signs between host classes was significant (P = 0.029) despite the small sample size. the shift from negatively skewed DMFE (excess of deleterious effects) in the non-Solanaceae to positively skewed distributions is also consistent with antagonistic pleiotropy. this conclusion needs to be qualified because the most extreme cases of antagonistic pleiotropy are mutations that were viable in N. tabacum but lethal in if a mutation has the same sign both in the primary and in the alternative hosts, it is considered not to be pleiotropic. the number of observed mutations with putative pleiotropic effects was not significantly larger than expected by sheer chance. estimates of, of error variance and broad sense heritability (H2) show the percentage of total phenotypic variance explained by genetic differences among TEV genotypes. for the five host species, ranged from 0.051 to 0.115, with an average value of 0.083, and explaining >95% of the observed phenotypic variance. new tab a Lethal alleles were removed from the computations because they have absolute fitness. GE arises from the combined effect of antagonistic pleiotropy and reductions in genetic variance associated to the shift from hosts that belong to the same family as the natural host to hosts that do not belong to this family. the problem of viral emergence depends on the interaction between host's genetics, vectors' abundance, ecology, and virus evolvability. if the fitness of individual mutant genotypes is expressed relative to wildtype virus, the change in shape means that the number of (conditional) beneficial mutations increases as hosts become more phylogenetically distant from tobacco. if the fitness of individual mutant genotypes is expressed relative to wildtype virus, the change in shape means that the number of mutations that may potentially expand TEV host range is large. a third of mutations generated unviable viruses, whereas viable mutations reduced fitness, on average, by 10% [21]. in the case of DNA phages X174 [16] and f1 [17] the fraction of unviable mutations was lower (one fifth) but the average effect of viable mutations was almost identical to the one reported for RNA viruses. the fraction of lethal, deleterious, neutral and beneficial mutations radically depends on the host in which the fitness effects of mutations is evaluated. for host species belonging to the same family as the primary host, the weibull pdf fitted best (or second to best for C. annuum) model to describe DMFE. for hosts outside the family this model is the best only in one out of three cases. the more closely related the primary host and the new host are, the greater are the chances for a successful spillover. if the ability to recognize and infect a host cell is important for cross-species transmission, then phylogenetically related species are more likely to share related cell receptors and defense pathways. if the ability to recognize and infect a host cell is important, then phylogenetically related species are more likely to share related cell receptors and defense pathways. a large and unknown number of mutations [23], [36]\u2013[39], making unclear whether GE depended on single plasticity genes or on the quantitative contribution of multiple genes. mutations involved in significant GE were scattered along the genome and they were randomly chosen irrespective of their fitness effects. pleiotropy does not contribute significantly to GE when the novel host is closely related to the natural one, however, it becomes an important factor when hosts are distantly related. previous studies with E. coli showed that GE was mainly explained by changes in genetic variance but not by changes in the rank order of fitness effects across environments. mutations in eIF4E have been identified as the cause of the Potato virus Y (PVY) resistant phenotype of pepper cultivars. however, PVY overcomes the resistance by fixing amino acid changes in the central domain of VPg that reconstitutes the correct binding. these mutants pay a fitness cost in the non-resistant pepper. the fate of the viral population entering into the new host depends, in a first instance, on whether it contains genetic variants with a positive fitness value. a pre-requisite for predicting the ability of a virus to expand its host range is to have information about the distribution of fitness effects associated to mutations. the shape of DMFE is a critical component of many mathematical models of evolutionary dynamics, including the molecular clock, the rate of genomic contamination by Muller's ratchet, and the evolution of sex and recombination. despite differences in the genetic material of these viruses, their sizes and gene contents, the methodology applied has been similar in all cases. DMFE for viruses are highly asymmetric and can be reasonably well described by theoretical pdfs with heavy tails. despite being important for understanding the evolution of a virus in its natural host, these results were, even so, insufficient to understand the likelihood of a virus expanding its host range. normand [31] proposed three possible outcomes for the DMFEs measured in permissive vs. stressful environments. conditional expression means that some mutations have a detectable fitness effect in some environments but are neutral in others. stress conditions tend to inflate the variance of the DMFE while leaving the central value of the distributions almost unaffected. phylogenetic relatedness between reservoir and new hosts may be a factor for host switching. the rate and intensity of contact may be even more critical. a species might be exposed to a novel pathogen, but they might already posses a sufficient immune response. we can conclude that phenotypic plasticity of TEV is not associated to the expression of any particular gene but results from the contribution of different genes. the existence of a significant GE interaction means that by knowing the absolute viral fitness in the natural host informs us little about what it may be in an alternative one. the evolutionary implications for these two mechanisms are different. antagonistic pleiotropy observed between absolute fitness in the natural host N. tabacum and in the non-Solanaceae hosts suggests that TEV may be interacting with different host factors. the improved interaction with tobacco may lead to less efficient interaction with an orthologous factor, if available, in the alternative hosts. a subset of 20 mutants non-lethal in N. tabacum was randomly chosen from a larger collection used in a previous study. a plasmid containing the TEV genome, pMTEV [44], generously gifted by Dr. J.A. Dars, was used to generate both the wildtype virus and the mutant genotypes. the infectivity of each RNA genotype was tested by inoculating five plants. all TEV genotypes were confirmed to be infectious on N. tabacum. eight host species previously described as susceptible to TEV systemic infection. asymptomatic plants were subjected to RT-PCR for detection of infection. RNA concentration was measured spectrophotometrically and the samples were diluted to a final concentration of 50 ng/L. RT-qPCR reactions were performed in 20 L volume using a standard curve. the primers forward TEV-CP 5\u2032-TTGGTCTTGATGCGTG and reverse TEV-CP 5\u2032-TGTGTCTCCT amplify a 71 nt fragment within the TEV CP cistron. a subset of 20 mutants non-lethal in N. tabacum (Table 1) was randomly chosen from a larger collection used in a previous study. a plasmid containing the TEV genome, pMTEV [44], generously gifted by Dr. J.A. Dars, was used to generate both the wildtype virus and the mutant genotypes. both solanaceae and Asteraceae are classified as Asterids. the remaining two hosts belong to the family Amaranthaceae. the three plant families are Eudicots. RNAs were centrifuged at 14000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C, washed once with 70% ice-cold ethanol, dried in a SpeedVac (Thermo) and resuspended in 30 L of DEPC-treated ultrapure water. RNA concentration was measured spectrophotometrically and the samples were diluted to a final concentration of 50 ng/L. quantitative results were examined using SDS7000 software v. 1.2.3 (Applied Biosystems) Statistics Absolute fitness was estimated as Malthusian growth rate per day."}
