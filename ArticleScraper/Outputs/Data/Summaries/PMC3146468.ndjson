{"summary": "resistance traits are difficult or impossible to measure directly. potential indirect criteria are measures of immune traits. variation in ITs depends on genetic, environmental and probably epigenetic factors. selection for growth, carcass leanness, meat quality and prolificacy has been highly effective in pigs. since the early 2000's, prophylactic use of antibiotics has been forbidden by european legislation. since the early 2000's, prophylactic use of antibiotics as growth promoters has been highly effective in pigs. Adaptive immunity is antigen-specific and requires the recognition of specific \u201cnon-self\u201d antigens via a process of antigen presentation and results in an immunological memory. pigs selected for eight generations for high and low adaptive IR (HIR and LIR), respectively. several significant QTLs for total leukocyte count ([20], [21], mitogen-induced proliferation [20], antibody response [22], complement activity [22], and acute phase protein serum concentration [22] have been detected and mapped to different pig chromosomes. most of the results reported so far have targeted a limited number of traits and very few studies have combined innate and adaptive ITs. traits measured on each animal of the studied population are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Among the cell-mediated ITs evaluated after diverse stimulations, higher responses in cytokine levels were observed after phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-Ionomycin (PMAIONO) stimulation compared to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and concanavalin A (CONA) stimulations, except for IL2 production. 506.9 610.4 1.20 0.35 (0.19) [0.00 \u2013 0.72] Moderate IFNG-CONA 437 516.9 552.2 1.06 0.41 (0.19) [0.00 \u2013 0.78] Moderate IFNG-PMAIONO * 437 56799 79326 1.39 0.52 (0.20) [0.10 \u2013 0.91] High IFNG-LPS 438 530.4 692.6 1.30 0.00 (0.17) [0.00 \u2013 0.33] 0.56 0.68 (0.20) [0.20 \u2013 1.00] High IgG * 436 68.9 37.1 0.53 0.92 (0.21) [0.50 \u2013 1.00] High IgM* 441 74.3 55.6 0.74 0.31 (0.18) [0.00\u20130.66] Moderate & N = number of progeny measured for each IT.

IL2 production after PMAIONO, CONA and LPS stimulations gave high estimates of heritability not significantly different from zero. traits involved in humoral-mediated adaptive immunity, heritabilities for total IgG and IgA antibody levels were higher than for total IgM and specific antibodies. the number of positive genetic correlations (310) was higher than that of negative correlations (183), as already observed for phenotypic correlations. only 28 (2.7% of the total number of correlations) and five (0.4% of the total number of correlation estimates) were higher than 0.4 or lower than -0.4, respectively. ii) a group of nine cell response traits (IL12, IL4-PMAIONO, IL2-PMAIONO, TNF, PROLIF-PMA, HAPT, CRP, IL1B, IL8 and PHAG) in cluster A, values greater than 0.4 were estimated between i) TNF, IL8 and PHAG, and ii) CRP and HAPT. traits measured on each animal of the studied population (n = 383 to 442) are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

IL8 was the cytokine produced with the highest levels followed by IL1B, TNF, IL12 and lastly IL6. a kinetic study would help to improve comparison of cytokine production levels. differences could be related to different modes of action of these molecules. pro-inflammatory cytokines appear to show less heritable variation than adaptive system-related cytokines. pro-inflammatory cytokines appear to show less heritable variation than adaptive system-related cytokines. gG-Mh have lower heritability estimates (0.12, = 0.19) than previously reported. our estimated h2 for IFN production is moderate to high (0.60, = 0.23). differences could be due to differences in the pig breeds and in environment factors. large-scale estimation of phenotypic and genetic correlations among 32 ITs. no cluster of innate and adaptive ITs is revealed. innate immunity is in place or ready for activation prior to infection. the weak genetic correlations between most ITs suggest that it will be difficult to choose only a few ITs to select for immunocompetence. a major challenge will be to correlate variation in heritable ITs in healthy animals with inter-individual variability in response to various pathogens. al and cell-mediated adaptive ITs included in the Wilkie et al index induce the formation of immune complexes and/or the development of inflammatory responses. but it is important to remain cautious with high responder animals, which could develop autoimmune pathologies or pathological iummne responses. ematological traits (RBC, HT, RDW and PLT) included in cell-mediated immunity. cytokine production by different CD4+ T cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Th, Th17 and iTreg) is highly flexible. cytokine production by different CD4+ T cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Th, Th17 and iTreg) is highly flexible. innate immunity-related cytokines and IL12 are not expected to be expressed at all time points after stimulation compared to CONA or PMAIONO. the differences could be related to the distinct modes of action of these molecules. the combination of PMA and ionomycin induces a stronger stimulation that may be related to a higher production of cytokines. the lymphocyte proliferation induced by LPS is weaker than that observed with other stimulants, as expected. specific IgGs (IgG-Mh) have lower heritability estimates (0.12, = 0.19) than previously reported (range from 0.27 to 0.45) for specific antibodies directed against other antigens. differences could be due to differences in pig breeds and in environment factors. phenotypic and genetic correlations illustrate complementarity of 32 ITs. no cluster of innate and adaptive ITs is revealed. innate immunity is in place or ready for activation prior to infection. the weak genetic correlations between most ITs suggest that it will be difficult to choose only a few ITs to select for immunocompetence. a major challenge will be to correlate variation in heritable ITs in healthy animals with inter-individual variability in response to various pathogens. the levels of humoral and cell-mediated adaptive ITs included in the Wilkie et al index induce the formation of immune complexes and/or the development of inflammatory responses, central to the pathogenesis of mycoplasma hyorhinis-induced arthritis. pigs were born and weaned in 16 selection herds and arrived in the test station at five weeks of age with no prior vaccination. blood samples were collected via the external jugular vein into tubes with or without anti-coagulants, according to further use. total number of leukocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, erythrocytes, platelets and hematocrit. plasma samples were diluted 16000, 14000 and 160,000 to detect IgM, IgA and IgG. different subsets were detected with appropriate peroxidase anti-pig IgM, IgA or IgG.
