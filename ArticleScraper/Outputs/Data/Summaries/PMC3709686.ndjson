{"summary": "eight sporadic outbreaks of marburg haemorrhagic fever have been reported. MARV is one of the major pathogens posing a significant public health threat for imported infectious disease and bioterrorism. GP is thought to be the key factor in MARV growth, cell tropism, host range and pathogenicity. GP is proteolytically cleaved into two subunits, GP1 and GP2. the subunits GP1 and GP2 are covalently linked via a disulphide bond. cleavage is not essential for virus replication in vitro and pathogenicity in non-human primates. most of the O-linked glycans are concentrated in the middle one-third of GP (amino acid positions 289\u2013501), the region that is highly divergent among filovirus GPs. mucin-like region masks receptor-binding sites from neutralizing antibodies by steric shielding of the antibody-specific epitopes. passive transfer of anti-EBOV GP mAb 12B5-1-1 is protective in a mouse model of lethal EBOV infection. the possible mechanisms underlying evasion from antibody mediated inhibition of viral infectivity are not well understood. mAbs AGP127-8 (IgG1) and MGP72-17 (IgM) do not inhibit GP-mediated entry of MARV into host cells. two clones of MARV GP-specific mAbs, AGP127-8 and MGP72-17, were used in this study. previously, we reported that mAbs AGP127-8 and MGP72-17 had the potential to inhibit budding of MARV from infected cells. mAbs AGP127-8 and MGP72-17 had the potential to inhibit budding of MARV from infected cells. mAbs AGP127-8 and MGP72-17 are MARV GP specific. mAb APH159-1-3 was used as an irrelevant negative control. rVSVG/MARVGP plaques are shown relative to the plaque size and number of plaques in the absence of mAbs. mutants could form large plaques even in the presence of mAbs AGP127-8 or MGP72-17. the plaques were comparable in size to those formed in the absence of the mAbs. mutants acquired mutations at several different positions in the MARV GP sequence to evade the selective pressure of mAbs. position 435 and 432 were changed to Gln and Gly respectively. it is well established that the furin cleaves proteins just downstream of its recognition sequence Arg-X-Lys/Arg-Arg. rVSVG/MARVGP variants which escaped from mAb MGP72-17 selective pressure had extensive deletion in their GPs. mAbs AGP127-8 and MGP72-17 and anti-MARV GP rabbit serum (FS0505) were examined for their binding activities to HEK293T cells expressing WT or variant MARV GPs. mutations found in mAbs AGP127-8 and MGP72-17 were concentrated in the C-terminal region of GP1. mAbs AGP127-8 and MGP72-17 did not bind to recombinant MARV GP whose amino acids 410\u2013430 were artificially deleted. the data indicated that the specific, linear epitope of each mAb was located between aa 411 and 430. the furin-cleavage motif itself was not essential for epitope conformation. uncleaved GP was detected on VLPs bearing GP of A127 variant #1 and M72 variant #6, which had point mutations in the furin-recognition motif at positions 434 and 431, respectively. point mutations in the furin-recognition motif probably recessed the epitopes in the uncleaved GP molecule and contributed to rVSVG/MARVGP escape from antibody selective pressure. hek293T cells were co-transfected with pCAGGS expressing MARV GP and VP40. the uncleaved GP and the GP2 subunit were detected using mAb MGP14-22 that recognizes the epitope located in the GP2 subunit. rVSVG/MARVGP was inoculated onto confluent Vero E6 cells. incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 2 days with 1.0 % agarose in maintenance medium. mAb APH159-1-3 was used as an irrelevant negative control. rVSV replicates more rapidly in cultured cells than wild-type MARV. mutants could form large plaques even in the presence of mAbs AGP127-8 or MGP72-17. mutants could form large plaques even in the presence of mAbs AGP127-8 or MGP72-17. M72 variant #2 acquired a single amino acid substitution: Tyr at position 430 was replaced with Asp. Arg at position 434 mutated to Asn, and Arg at position 435 mutated to Gln. it is well established that the furin cleaves proteins just downstream of its recognition sequence Arg-X-Lys/Arg-Arg. mAbs mGP127-8 and mGP72-17 are shown in boldface and underlined. mAbs mAbs AGP127-8 and mGP72-17 are shown in boldface. mutant MARV GP rabbit serum (FS0505) was examined for binding activities. mutations found in mAbs AGP127-8 and MGP72-17 were concentrated in the C-terminal region of GP1. both mAbs bound strongly to a peptide corresponding to amino acids 411\u2013430, but not to any of the other peptides tested. reactivities of both mAbs to synthetic peptides derived from MARV GP were analysed. MARV GP2, but not uncleaved MARV GP, was detected in WT GP. a127 variant #5 acquired point mutations at three positions outside furin-recognition motif. uncleaved GP was detected on VLPs bearing GP of A127 variant #1 and M72 variant #6, which had point mutations in the furin-recognition motif at positions 434 and 431, respectively. aved GP was detected using mAb MGP14-22 that recognizes the epitope located in the GP2 subunit. point mutations in the furin-recognition motif probably recessed the epitopes in the uncleaved GP molecule and contributed to rVSVG/MARVGP escape from antibody selective pressure. some of the rVSVG/MARVGP variants selected in the presence of mAbs AGP127-8 and MGP72-17 acquired a point mutation that altered the optimal furin-recognition motif at the C terminus of GP1. however, the furin-recognition motif itself is unlikely to serve as the antibody-specific epitope sequence for both mAbs. MARV can lose the optimal furin-recognition motif in GP without changing their biological phenotype, at least in non-human primate hosts. alternative or additional mechanisms of virus escape from mAb pressure may also be considered. MARV GP has extraordinary flexibility and variability to evade antibody mediated immune pressure. the mucin-like region is dispensable for virus replication in vitro. but it still needs to be clarified by using a reverse genetics approach. rVSVG/MARVGP, recombinant replication-competent chimeric VSV, was generated as described previously. all infectious work with rVSVG/MARVGP was performed at the Integrated Research Facility in the Rocky Mountain Laboratories. IgM specific to influenza A virus haemagglutinin was used as an irrelevant control antibody. the animal protocol was approved by the Hokkaido University Animal Care and Use Committee. mutation at aa 435, Arg to Leu was introduced into the WT GP gene by site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) the binding activities of mAbs AGP127-8 and MGP72-17 to MARV GPs were tested using HEK293T cells grown on 96-well plates and transfected with pCAGGS expressing WT or mutant GPs. the reaction was stopped by adding 1 N sulphuric acid. the optical density (OD) at 450 nm was measured. similar expression levels of each mutant GP were confirmed with anti-MARV GP rabbit serum FS0505. bound antibody was detected with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. bound antibody was detected with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. rVSVG/MARVGP was recombinant replication-competent chimeric VSV. the animal protocol was approved by the Hokkaido University Animal Care and Use Committee. confluent Vero E6 cells infected with rVSVG/MARVGP mixed with or without a mAb were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 2 days with 1.0 % agarose in the presence of mAbs. the binding activities of mAbs AGP127-8 and MGP72-17 to MARV GPs were tested using HEK293T cells grown on 96-well plates. after 48 h incubation, cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 1 % Triton X-100. the reaction was stopped by adding 1 N sulphuric acid and the optical density (OD) at 450 nm was measured. similar expression levels of each mutant GP were confirmed with anti-MARV GP rabbit serum FS0505. rVSVG/MARVGP was recombinant replication-competent chimeric VSV. mAbs AGP127-8 (IgG1), MGP14-22 (IgG1) and MGP72-17 (IgM) were generated as described previously. confluent Vero E6 cells infected with rVSVG/MARVGP mixed with or without a mAb were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 2 days with 1.0 % agarose in maintenance medium. the cells were stained with crystal violet and then the number and size of rVSVG/MARVGP plaques were determined. the binding activities of mAbs AGP127-8 and MGP72-17 to MARV GPs were tested using HEK293T cells grown on 96-well plates. after 48 h incubation, cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 1 % Triton X-100. expression levels of each mutant GP were confirmed with anti-MARV GP rabbit serum FS0505 produced by immunization with a synthetic peptide corresponding to aa 67\u201381 (SKRWAFRTGVPPKNV) hek293T cells were co-transfected with pCAGGS expression plasmids encoding the WT or mutant MARV GP gene and major matrix protein VP40 gene."}
