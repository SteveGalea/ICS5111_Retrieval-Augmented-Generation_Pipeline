{"summary": "innate cytokine IFN- is inhibited and the adaptive arm of the immunity is delayed. in PRRSV-infected pigs, innate cytokine IFN- is inhibited. the innate immune system is an important arm of defense to prevent viral invasion and replication to initiate the adaptive arm of the immune system. the quantities of important cytokines secreted in pigs infected by PRRSV appeared to be significantly lower than pigs infected with a swine influenza virus. studies addressing cytokine profiles and NK cell cytotoxic functions have been performed in pigs from 1 week post-PRRSV infection. the cytokine profiles provide an elegant model of directed response to infectious pathogens. the role of IL-4 in the pig immune system appears to be different. PRRSV-infected and contact pigs suppressed NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. in each pen, only 2 pigs were studied, the pig infected and 1 of the other penmate (contact control) pigs were viremic with detectable RNA and viral titer. cytotoxicity was detected in 13 infected pigs and 12 contact control pigs. two days after infection, 10 of the 13 NK cell competent infected pigs had more than 50% reduction in NK cell cytotoxicity. only three of the 12 contact pigs had similar reduction in NK cell cytotoxicity.

Flow cytometric analysis detected an increased frequency of NK cells rich fraction at day 2 post-infection in both infected and contact pigs. day-2 infected 60.7 15.2 17.9 5.9 7.8 2.3#, $ 11.0 3.5#, $ Immune cells bNK cells c T cells dMyeloid cells eTregs Day-0 20.0 11.2 25.6 9.7 27.4 6.1 0.2 0.1 Day-2 contact 38.0 23.9* 15.6 7.9* 18.5 12.8* 1.0 0.6* Day-2 infected 31.1 18.7 27.2 7.2$ 11.3 8.9#, a 1-fold increase in IFN- production in 7 out of 25 PRRSV-infected pigs. plasma samples of 22 out of 25 infected pigs at day 2 post-infection had increased secretion of IL-4. production of IL-4 and IL-10 was statistically significant in infected animals at day 2 post-infection. plasma samples collected from pigs on day 0 pre-infection (n = 50) and day 2 post-infection of infected (n = 25) and contact (n = 25) pigs were analyzed by ELISA to determine cytokine levels: (A and C) IL-4; (B and D) IL-10 secreted by indicated pig groups at day 0 and day 2 post-infection. each bar represents the amount of cytokines secreted by each bar represents the amount of cytokines secreted by individual pigs. a paired t-test was performed by comparing day 0 and day 2 cytokine responses. the frequency of lymphoid and myeloid immune cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. 50% of pigs at day 0 (preinfection) did not have detectable NK cell cytotoxicity. in pigs with satisfactory NK cell cytotoxicity, PRRSV significantly suppresses the NK function by 50-80% from post-infection day 7-24 [10] pigs with reduced NK cell cytotoxicity were viremic with titers greater than 2 logs, suggesting replicating PRRSV mediated suppression of NK cell function. a slight increase in IFN- production early post-infection in greater than 50% of PRRSV-infected pigs. reduction in PRRSV-induced pig NK cell cytotoxicity is independent of NK cell population observed in this and earlier reports. studies have demonstrated the adjuvant role of IL-12 to live PRRSV vaccine in pigs by induction of IFN- production resulting in a protective immune response. secretion of IL-12 in PRRSV-infected pigs was detected early post-infection. PRRSV-induced upregulation of IL-12 might be involved in differentiation of macrophages which aids viral infection. pigs have abundant CD4+CD8+ T cells and these cells secrete IFN- and mediating pathogen-specific cytotoxicity. a rapid reduction in the total myeloid cell pool in PBMC of infected pigs indicates their migration to the lungs, a primary site of infection. a significant decrease in the frequency of Tregs in pigs vaccinated with a modified live PRRSV vaccine co-administered with a potent mucosal adjuvant has suggested the cross-protective immunity [11]. pigs have underdeveloped NK cell-mediated cytotoxic function. in pigs with satisfactory NK cell cytotoxicity, PRRSV significantly suppresses the NK function by 50-80% from post-infection day 7-24. this could be one of the innate immune evasion mechanisms of PRRSV. a slight increase in IFN- production early post-infection in more than 50% of PRRSV-infected pigs was reported. reduction in PRRSV-induced pig NK cell cytotoxicity is independent of NK cell population observed in this and earlier reports. IL-6 secretion suppresses the transcriptional activity of all the inflammatory cytokines. IL-4 plays an important role in regulation of inflammatory activity of pig alveolar macrophages in respiratory disease conditions. PRRSV-induced upregulation of IL-12 might be involved in differentiation of macrophages which aids viral infection. but targeted approach to investigate such a mechanism of action of IL-12 in PRRSV-infected pigs is important. PRRSV-mediated upregulation of Tregs bearing a natural Treg phenotype in infected pigs indicates the role of Tregs in viral pathogenesis. increased frequency of Tregs in unvaccinated pigs associated with increased secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-. experimental pigs were seronegative at the beginning of the experiment. in each pen, two pigs were selected at random and ear-tagged. PBMC were isolated from 100 samples; on day 0 (n = 50) and day 2, infected (n = 25) and contact (n = 25) as described previously. PBMC were used as the source of NK cells (effectors) and K-562 human myocytes. the percentage of NK cell-specific killing was calculated after subtracting the spontaneously released LDH due to nonspecific cell lysis of target cells. PBMC were treated with 2% pig serum to block Fc receptors. mAb was either directly conjugated to a specific fluorochrome or biotinylated. cells were surface stained for CD4 and CD25 as described above. cells were then stained with fluorochrome-conjugated pig Foxp3 mAb. analysis was performed using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) nursery pigs were from a herd free of PRRSV and experimental pigs were seronegative at the beginning of the experiment. in each pen, two pigs were selected at random and ear-tagged. the other pig was an uninoculated contact control. a commercial real-time PCR assay kit was used for the quantification of PRRSV. results of PRRSV qRT-PCR in each ml of plasma are reported as RNA copies in log10 values. NK cell assay to determine generic pig NK cell-mediated cyotoxicity was followed as described previously. the percent of NK cell-specific killing was calculated after subtracting the spontaneously released LDH due to nonspecific cell lysis of targets. plasma samples collected after centrifugation of unclotted blood were analyzed for the IFN-, Th1 (IFN-, IL-12), Th2 (IL-4) and immunosuppressive (IL-10) cytokines by cytokine sandwich ELISA as described previously. immunostained PBMC were acquired using a FACS AriaII flow cytometer. analysis was performed using a paired t-test or Wilcoxon t-test. , BB, and GJR performed the experiments and analyzed the data. authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
