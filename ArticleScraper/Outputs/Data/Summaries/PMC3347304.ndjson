{"summary": "Pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) is an enveloped nonsegmented negative-strand RNA virus of the genus Pneumovirus. the virus is a relative of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) the leading viral cause of severe respiratory infections in infants and also causes substantial morbidity and mortality in the elderly. the virus has now been eliminated from laboratory mice by specific-pathogen-free breeding methods and infection control measures. for animals kept without these measures, such as those in pet shops, evidence of PVM infection has continued to be reported. most surveys of wild rodents have failed to find such evidence (4, 22, 49, 52, 61) rPVM is based on a consensus sequence for virulent strain 15 (42) rPVM, rPVM expressing green fluorescent protein (rPVM-GFP) and rPVM mutants lacking the genes for nonstructural proteins NS1 and/or NS2 (rPVMNS1, rPVMNS2 and rPVMNS12) were propagated on BHK-21 cells (CCL-10; ATCC, Manassas, VA) or on Plaques were visualized by immunostaining with rabbit G-specific polyclonal antibody (PAb) raised against modified vaccinia virus Ankara-PVM G (42) or using a mixture of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 1129, 1269, and 1243 against the RSV F protein (5). bound antibodies were detected by incubation with a peroxidase substrate. four rhesus macaques were confirmed to be seronegative for PVM and RSV by plaque reduction assays. the animals were inoculated simultaneously intranasally and intratracheally with 1 ml of inoculum per site containing 106.8 PFU of rPVM in L15 medium. clinical observations were made on days 0 to 12 postinoculation. a protocol approved by the institutional review board of the Clinical Center at the NIH. written informed consent was obtained from all donors. all human sera were provided without patient identifiers. hexachlorofluorescein [HEX]-labeled probe) with -actin as the housekeeping gene (6-carboxyfluorescein [FAM]-labeled probe). CXCL10 primers (5\u2032-TGGCATTCAAGGAGTACCTCTC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CAAAATTGGCTTGCAGGAAT-3\u2032) were designed by using the website Primer 3. lysis buffer containing 1 protease inhibitor was applied to BSR T7/5 cells. cell lysates were diluted in 1 NuPAGE reducing buffer (Life Technologies) and 1 NuPAGE LDS sample buffer was applied to BSR T7/5 monolayers. goat anti-monkey IgG (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), donkey anti-human IgG IRDye 700DX (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA), goat anti-rabbit IgG IRDye 800 (Li-Cor) and goat anti-mouse IgG IRDye 800 (Li-Cor) were used at dilutions of 1:100, 1:1,000, and 1:5,000. goat anti-monkey antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IgG, and goat anti-mouse IgG were conjugated to Alexa 647 by the NIH NIAID Custom Antibody Conjugation Facility. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) compensation controls were automatically calculated using BD FACSDiva, version 6.1.3 (BD Biosciences) serum samples were electrophoresed on a 4-to-12% SDS-PAGE gel with MOPS electrophoresis buffer. human IgG was used as a positive control (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) band intensities were quantified using ImageJ software. BSR T7/5 cells were maintained in Opti-Pro medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 5% FBS and 4 mM l-glutamine. plaque assay on Vero cells under 0.8% methylcellulose overlay. Plaques were visualized by immunostaining with rabbit G-specific polyclonal antibody. four young adult africa green monkeys (AGM; Chlorocebus aethiops) and four rhesus macaques (RM; Macaca mulatta) were confirmed to be seronegative for PVM and RSV. the animals were inoculated simultaneously intranasally and intratracheally with 1 ml of inoculum per site containing 106.8 PFU of rPVM in L15 medium. serum samples were incubated for 30 min at 56\u00b0C to inactivate complement. total RNA was isolated from infected cells using an RNeasy total RNA isolation kit. one microgram of isolated RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript. two microliters of the cDNA mix was used for duplex quantitative reverse-transcription PCRs (qRT-PCRs) using a Brilliant QRT-PCR Plus core kit (Life Technologies) for human alpha and beta interferons (IFN- and -) (6-carboxy-2\u2032,4,4\u2032,5\u2032,7,7\u2032-hexachlorofluorescein [HEX]-labeled probe) with -actin as the housekeeping gene (6 VM were resuspended in TEN buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, and 100 mM NaCl) for electrophoresis, viral particles were prepared in 1 NuPAGE lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Life Technologies) the highest exposure temperature was 32\u00b0C. human sera from donors with known PVM-neutralizing titers were used at a dilution of 1:100. goat anti-monkey IgG (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), donkey anti-human IgG IRDye 700DX (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA), goat anti-rabbit IgG IRDye 800 (Li-Cor) and goat anti-mouse IgG IRDye 800 (L human and AGM sera with known RSV and PVM PRNT60 were used at dilutions of 1:100, 1:1,000, and 1:5,000. serum samples were incubated for 30 min at 56\u00b0C to inactivate complement. secondary antibodies included goat anti-monkey IgG (KPL), donkey anti-human IgG Alexa 647 (Life Technologies), goat anti-rabbit IgG (KPL), and goat anti-mouse IgG (KPL serum samples were electrophoresed on a 4-to-12% SDS-PAGE gel with MOPS electrophoresis buffer (Life Technologies) to confirm that IgG had been successfully depleted, serum samples were electrophoresed on a 4-to-12% SDS-PAGE gel with nonreducing and nondenaturing conditions. serum samples were stained with Coomassie blue (Life Technologies) to visualize IgG protein bands. nasopharyngeal swabs and tracheal lavage samples were collected over a period of 12 days using low-passage, cDNA-derived PVM (rPVM) that had previously been shown to be highly virulent in mice (9. from the lower respiratory tract, virus shedding was not detected in any AGM, and very low levels of shedding were detected in 2 of the 4 RM. monkeys were inoculated intranasally and intratracheally with 6.8 log10 PFU of PVM per site. the lower limit of detection was 0.7 log PFU/ml. \u2014, no detectable virus. rHDA4G \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 0.7 0 Mean 1.0 0.3 2.3 2.3 a In the experiment whose results are shown in Table 1, TLs were performed on the indicated days. a number of consecutive days starting 1 day before the first recorded titer and ending 1 day after last recorded titer. a serum sample was considered positive with a PRNT60 value of 5.3. rPVM NS2 protein was previously identified as an inhibitor of murine type I IFN induction. peak titers of rPVMNS1 (4.7 log10 PFU per ml on day 10) were a little higher than those of wild-type rPVM. peak titers for rPVM lacking NS2 (3.5 log10 PFU per ml), or both NS1 and NS2 (3.0 log10 PFU per ml), occurred earlier (day 4) and at lower levels than those for rPVM and rPVMNS1 0.7 log10 PFU per ml (dashed line) data are representative of two independent experiments. qRT-PCR and ELISA analyzed the type I IFN response in A549 cells infected with wild-type and NS deletion rPVM strains. qRT-PCR results are expressed as difference (fold) relative to values in cells 24 h after inoculation with UV-inactivated rPVMNS2. cells were harvested at the indicated time points, the medium supernatants were clarified and used for quantification of viral titers and secreted cytokines. IFN- and - gene expression was detected starting at 24 h postinfection, was maximal at 44 h, and decreased at 64 h. we also evaluated induction of IFN-stimulated genes by qRT-PCR (ISG56, IRF7, and CXCL10) and by ELISA (12, 29, 30, 36, 55) the four donors with the highest RSV-neutralizing activities had no or low PVM-neutralizing activities. this was investigated further using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. the observed PVM-neutralizing activity is unlikely to be due to cross-reaction by RSV-specific antibodies. apparent increase in PVM seroprevalence from early childhood into adulthood could be consistent with increasing exposure during life to a PVM-like virus. lack of cross-neutralization between RSV- and PVM-neutralizing antibodies suggested that the PVM-neutralizing activity was not due to cross-neutralization by RSV-specific antibodies. rPVM-GFP, which is slightly attenuated due to the presence of the GFP insert, was administered at the very low dose of 10 PFU/mouse. rPVMNS2, which is highly attenuated and apathogenic (9), was administered at a dose of 2,000 PFU per mouse. five mice of each inoculated group were sacrificed to evaluate virus replication. 5 animals from each group were challenged by intranasal administration of PVM (2,000 PFU) on day 28, 5 animals from each group were challenged by intranasal administration of PVM (middle) the remaining 5 animals in each group were challenged by intranasal administration of RSV (500,000 PFU) the RSV F and N proteins were identified in blots of sucrose gradient-purified rRSV preparations using nondenaturing and nonreducing conditions. the rabbit RSV-specific PAb also showed slight cross-reactivity with the PVM N protein. sera were used at dilutions designed to have PRNT60 similar to that of the human test sera. data are from one of three independent experiments with similar results. gradient-purified rPVM serum reacted with gradient-purified rPVM. rabbit antiserum against purified PVM (PVM-specific PAb) analysed blots of gradient-purified PVM using same antiserum. reactivity of the serum with the RSV N protein in purified rRSV. activity comparable to those of the human test sera was diluted 100-fold to an RSV PRNT60 of 9.4 log2. the PVM-specific serum was diluted 300,000-fold to a PVM PRNT60 of 6.6 log2. sera from the seven other PVM-infected AGM and RM also reacted predominantly with the PVM G protein. al log2 PRNT60 for RSV and PVM are noted. results are representative of three independent experiments. reactivity of RSV F-specific MAb 1169 and PVM G-specific polyclonal antibody is not shown. we evaluated the specificity of the human test sera for PVM and RSV. we evaluated reactivity against vero cells that had been infected with RSV or PVM, each of which expressed GFP from an added gene. the cells were then incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa 647. a preimmune AGM control serum showed little or no IgG antibody binding to cells infected with either virus compared to an antibody isotype control. binding to PVM-infected cells was only slightly greater than preimmune serum or an isotype antibody control. binding to RSV-infected cells was only slightly greater than that of preimmune serum or isotype control antibody. serum from an infant that lacked RSV- or PVM-neutralizing activity showed a level of binding to either RSV-infected cells or PVM-infected cells. the level of binding did not increase concomitantly with increased GFP expression. an adult serum with a substantial RSV PRNT60 and one of the highest observed PVM PRNT60 gave essentially the same results. a moderate level of background antibody binding was observed for most of the sera against both RSV- and PVM-infected cells. however, except in a single case, the level of antibody binding did not increase with increased GFP expression. the one exception was with AGM serum from an animal immunized with PVM (RSV PVM+; Fig. 6C), for which antibody binding increased, concomitant with increased GFP expression. commercially obtained purified human IgG was used as a marker. IgG has a molecular mass range of 150 to 170 kDa. 6%; 4, 45%; 5, 41%; and 6, 79%. ****, P 0.0001. first, we evaluated AGM sera specific for RSV or PVM as monospecific positive controls. this showed that the RSV-neutralizing activity of sera decreased below background levels following depletion of IgG. the posttreatment titers of PVM-neutralizing antibodies did not fall below background levels. colonies at Morgan Island, SC, and St. Kitts in the Caribbean lacked pre-existing immunity to PVM. four each of these PVM-seronegative AGM and RM were inoculated intranasally and intratracheally with the high dose of 6.8 log10 PFU of PVM per site (total dose, 7.1 log10 PFU per animal) a Monkeys were inoculated intranasally and intratracheally with 6.8 log10 PFU of PVM per site. the lower limit of detection was 0.7 log PFU/ml. \u2014, no detectable virus. 1.3 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 0.7 0 Mean 1.5 0.5 3.8 1.5 RM RHCL7C \u2014 \u2014 1.0 1.9 \u2014 0.7 0 RHDA4G \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 0.7 0 Mean 1.0 0.3 2.3 2.3 a In the experiment whose results are shown in Table 1, TLs were performed on the indicated days. a number of consecutive days starting 1 day before the first recorded titer and ending 1 day RM RHCL7C 3.5 12.2 RHCL7E 3.5 12.0 RHDA4G 3.8 16.1 RHDA43 3.9 15.3 Mean: 3.7 0.2 13.9 2.1 From the experiment described in Table 1 were collected 28 days postinfection. rPVM reached a peak titer of approximately 4.2 log10 PFU per ml on day 10. rPVM reached a peak titer of approximately 4.2 log10 PFU per ml on day 10. this titer is comparable to what we routinely obtain with RSV in A549 cells (62), showing that these human cells are similarly permissive for PVM and RSV. supernatant aliquots were taken at 24-h intervals postinfection and replaced with an equivalent volume of fresh medium. the limit of detection is 0.7 log10 PFU per ml (dashed line) triplicate cultures of A549 cells were mock infected, infected with sucrose gradient-purified rPVM, rPVMNS1, rPVMNS2, or rPVMNS12 at an MOI of 3 PFU/cell. cell cultures were harvested at the indicated time points, the medium supernatants were clarified and used for quantification of viral titers and secreted cytokines. rPVM and rPVMNS1 induced little or no IFN- or - detectable by qRT-PCR or ELISA at any time point. strong IFN- and - responses detected by both methods were induced by rPVM lacking NS2 or lacking both NS1 and NS2. this showed that NS2 is functional as an efficient inhibitor of type I IFN induction in human cells. the four donors with the highest RSV-neutralizing activities (Fig. 3, dots 1 to 4) had no or low PVM-neutralizing activities. the observed PVM-neutralizing activity is unlikely to be due to cross-reaction by RSV-specific antibodies. only one of the pediatric sera had detectable, but low, PVM-neutralizing activity (6.2 log2; 1:72), and this particular specimen was RSV seronegative. lack of cross-neutralization between RSV and PVM suggested that the PVM-neutralizing activity was not due to cross-neutralization by RSV-specific antibodies. groups of 15 mice each were infected intranasally with PVM and mock infected. rPVM-GFP, which is slightly attenuated due to the presence of the GFP insert, was administered at the very low dose of 10 PFU/mouse. rPVM-GFP was administered at 5.7 log10 PFU, which is a typical dose and well tolerated in mice. 5 mice from each group were euthanized, and virus titers in lung homogenates were determined by plaque assay. on day 28, 5 animals from each group were challenged by intranasal administration of PVM (2,000 PFU) the remaining 5 animals in each group were challenged by intranasal administration of RSV (500,000 PFU) human sera with PVM-neutralizing activity did not react with PVM proteins in Western blots. Western blot analysis used nondenaturing and nonreducing conditions to identify major RSV and PVM proteins. protein samples were subjected to 4-to-12% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. serum dilutions used and the RSV or PVM log2 PRNT60 of the undiluted sera are indicated above each membrane strip. data are from one of three independent experiments with similar results. rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against vaccinia virus expressing the PVM F protein reacted with gradient-purified rPVM. Lanes g to i, same PVM-specific PAb reacted with gradient-purified rPVM (h) and rRSV (i). rabbit antiserum against purified PVM (pVM-specific PAb) detected the PVM N and P proteins. sera from the seven other PVM-infected AGM and RM also reacted predominantly with the PVM G protein. sera from the seven other PVM-infected AGM and RM also reacted predominantly with the PVM G protein. infected cells were stained with selected human test sera or control antibodies, followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 647. the cells were then fixed and analyzed by flow cytometry. results are representative of three independent experiments. reactivity was evaluated against vero cells that had been infected with RSV or PVM, each of which expressed GFP from an added gene. reactivity was evaluated with intact, native cells in suspension. the cells were then incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa 647. rabbit PVM G-specific PAb did not react significantly with RSV-infected cells regardless of the amount of GFP expression. this assay provided a sensitive means to detect virus-specific antibodies by correlating antibody binding with the level of viral antigen expression as indicated by the GFP marker. serum from an infant that lacked RSV- or PVM-neutralizing activity exhibited a level of binding to either RSV-infected cells or PVM-infected cells that was moderately higher than that of the isotype antibody control. the level of binding did not increase concomitantly with increased GFP expression. the same absence of PVM-specific binding was observed with 3 additional adult sera with PVM PRNT60 of 8.6, 7.7, and 7.9 log2. the same set of aGM and human sera were evaluated using a secondary antibody specific to IgM. however, except in a single case, the level of antibody binding did not increase with increased GFP expression. serum samples from before and after treatment were electrophoresed on 4-to-12% SDS-PAGE gels. serum samples from before and after treatment were stained with Coomassie blue. representative RSV-positive AGM serum (Fig. 7A, lanes 1) had a reduction of 40%. the reductions in IgG band intensity for the numbered samples were as follows: 1, 80%; 2, 88%; 3, 76%; 4, 45%; 5, 41%; and 6, 79%. the reductions were as follows: 1, 80%; 2, 88%; 3, 76%; 4, 45%; 5, 41%; and 6, 79%. metapneumovirus (65), human bocavirus (1), and additional human coronavirus species (21, 43, 66, 68) lack an identified etiologic agent. previous studies indicated that a substantial proportion of human serum samples had PVM-neutralizing activity. however, there has never been a report of the isolation or direct detection of PVM in humans. in avian and RM with Newcastle disease virus, titers were detected when animals were sacrificed and respiratory tract tissue was assayed directly. however, the levels of shed virus were predictive. the permissiveness of primates for PVM is similar to that for avian Newcastle disease virus and bovine RSV (8). ulent in mice replicated in human airway epithelial A549 cells with an efficiency equivalent to what we typically observe with RSV. there is the caveat that infection of cell lines can be an unreliable predictor of host range. in some cases, virus entry in cultured cell lines can be mediated by alternative cellular receptors that are irrelevant in vivo. BPIV3, followed by evaluation of the chimeras in RM. each of the genes made a contribution to the host range restriction (60) restriction does not involve a single major block at any specific step in infection and replication but rather is the aggregate effect of suboptimal functioning of multiple viral components. Western blot analysis did not provide evidence of PVM-specific antibodies in human sera. a low level of cross-reactivity for the N protein was observed with rabbit antisera prepared by repeated immunization with purified virions. the idea that PVM might be an authentic human pathogen seems inconsistent with the lack of permissive infection in RM and AGM. the idea that PVM might be a cause of incidental infection in humans is inconsistent with the lack of reactivity with PVM proteins in Western blots. natural polyreactive and autoreactive antibodies are present at birth. they represent a contribution of IgG natural antibodies that are of maternal origin. this could explain why the low PVM-neutralizing activity of human sera seemed to develop with age."}
