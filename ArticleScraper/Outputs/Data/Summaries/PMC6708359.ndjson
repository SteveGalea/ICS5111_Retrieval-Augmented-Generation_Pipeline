{"summary": "shrews originated in Eurasia from where they populated Africa. we sampled 693 animals pertaining to the genera Sorex and Crocidura. 17 animals were PCR-positive, including 1 common shrew (Sorex araneus) shrew HBVs form separate species and Genotypes. complete genomes were recovered from 5 HBVs hosted by S. coronatus, 1 HBV hosted by S. araneus, and 4 HBVs hosted by C. olivieri. genomes encompassed 3,089 nucleotides for the crowned shrew HBV from Germany (CSHBV) and 3,172 nucleotides for the musk shrew HBV from Ivory Coast (MSHBVCIV) all shrew viruses comprised 4 predicted ORFs encoding the polymerase, surface, X, and core proteins. averaged over the full genome, CSHBV, MSHBVCIV, and the recently described Chinese musk shrews host at least 3 HBV species and 6 genotypes equaling primates in HBV species richness. shrew HBVs formed a distinct clade in distant sister relationship with the tent-making bat HBV (TBHBV) found in central American bats (17, 18) shrew HBVs were about equidistant from other orthohepadnaviruses along the complete genome ( SI Appendix, Table S3). similarity with the TBHBV was observed in a genome region encoding the N-terminal part of the polymerase ORF (cyan line, SI Appendix, Fig. S1G ). these data together suggested ancient evolutionary origins of shrew HBVs. calibration of the overall Orthohepadnavirus MRCA (node c) by a prior describing the rise of the order Chiroptera about 66 mya or by a prior describing the rise of the clade Laurasiatheria about 81 mya was most compatible with the data. shrew-associated calibration also favored a laurasiatherian MRCA, but yielded lower statistical support (BF, 1.75) a laurasiatherian host at the root of orthohepadnaviruses was confirmed independently in all 3 nonrecombinant datasets at similar or stronger statistical support. this interpretation was consistent with significantly higher HBV genetic diversity in laurasiatherian hosts compared with hosts representing Euarchontoglires and Chiroptera. only 1 of 9 sites under positive selection was predicted within the canonical HBV binding site in the eulipotyphlan Ntcp (K/L157; red arrows, Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Table S4) prevalence of both shrew and bat HBV is low, and whether other factors than HBV infection may shape Ntcp evolution remains to be determined. infection of primary human/tupaia hepatocytes by HDV pseudotypes. d.p.t, days posttransfection; GE, genome equivalent; Gt, genotype. functionality of the Sorex Ntcp was proven by taurocholate transport assay. the sorex Ntcp has a conserved glycine at position 158. this is essential for preS1 binding of HBV (28) the bat-borne TBHBV can infect human hepatocytes (17) the genetic relationship of shrew HBVs with TBHBV in some genomic domains prompted us to investigate zoonotic potential. the existence of the preC-encoding region is conserved among distantly related hepadnaviruses. both CSHBV and MSHBVCHN lack a methionine to initiate preC translation. however, alternative start codons hypothetically allowing translation initiation by leaky ribosomal scanning occurred. nonsense mutation followed preC start codon in preC region of MSHBVCHN. nonsense mutation also showed nonsense mutation following preC codon. conservation of arginine-rich region characteristic for posttranslational cleavage. in human HBV, genotype G infections usually occur as coinfections with another HBV genotype providing HBeAg in trans (30) high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of 10 CSHBV-positive and 5 MSHBVCIV-positive samples did not detect any additional divergent shrew HBV sequence. there was no detectable minority variant reverting the lack of methionine codons in both CSHBV genotypes and the presence of preC stop codons in both CSHBV and MSHBVCIV. low within-host variability of HBeAg-negative shrew HBV thus surprisingly resembled the immunotolerant phase of HBeAg-positive CHB in humans (32). 86 sera from Sorex and 57 sera from Crocidura were tested. antibodies were only detected in 1 german and 1 african shrew. shrew hepatitis B may lead to death of infected animals. ura infected with MSHBVCIV from Ivory Coast originated from one site only, sampled in the same year (site B; Fig. 4E ). the detection rate from this site was significantly higher compared with all other sites (Fisher exact, P 0.0001). 17 animals were PCR-positive, including 1 common shrew (Sorex araneus) and 12 crowned shrews (Sorex coronatus) sampled in Germany during 2008\u20132009 and 4 African giant shrews (Crocidura olivieri) sampled in Ivory Coast in 2004 and 1 large-headed shrew (Crocidura grandiceps) sampled in Sierra Leone in 2014. the genomes encompassed 3,089 nucleotides for the crowned shrew HBV from Germany (CSHBV) and 3,172 nucleotides for the musk shrew HBV from Ivory Coast (MSHBVC) shrew viruses comprised 4 predicted ORFs encoding the polymerase, surface, X, and core proteins, comparable to other HBVs. shrew viruses comprised 2 divergent lineages that differ from one another by 11.6\u201312.0% genomic sequence distance. shrews host at least 3 HBV species and 6 genotypes. shrew HBVs formed a distinct clade in distant sister relationship with the tent-making bat HBV. the long branches segregating both bat-borne and shrew-borne HBVs in phylogenetic reconstructions relying on the full genomes and the translated ORFs suggest ancient evolutionary relationships for both host orders with HBVs. sequence distance comparisons and divergent topology of shrew HBVs suggested recombination events during the genealogy of shrew HBVs. formal bioinformatic analyses strongly supported ancient recombination events between shrew HBVs and bat-, rodent- and primate-associated HBV ancestors. 81 mya was most compatible with the data. control runs excluding the shrew-associated calibration also favored a laurasiatherian MRCA, but yielded lower statistical support (BF, 1.75), highlighting the importance of including shrew HBVs. our analyses suggest an ancient laurasiatherian origin of orthohepadnaviruses. only 3 eulipotyphlan Ntcp sequences were available in public databases. this might hint at differences in receptor usage among HBVs infecting Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria. NTCP usage is known only for primate HBVs and the zoonotic TBHBV (17, 24, 28) shrew HBVs strongly differed from primate HBVs in the NTCP-binding preS1 domains. shrew HBV surface proteins do not interact with NTCP orthologs. myristoylated (myr) peptides comprising 48 preS1 residues are sufficient for highly specific NTCP binding and interfering with HBV infection. the homologous peptides of CSHBV and MSHBVCIV were unable to bind to either the human NTCP or the shrew Ntcp. infection experiments with pseudotyped HDV (psHDV) were performed to rule out that other domains of the surface proteins of shrew shrew HBVs with TBHBV in some genomic domains prompted us to investigate the zoonotic potential of shrew HBVs. first, we resurrected overlength CSHBV resembling the HBV pregenomic mRNA. the CSHBV was replication-competent in human hepatoma cells and could be blocked by reverse transcriptase inhibitor Entecavir. both CSHBV and MSHBVCHN lack a methionine to initiate preC translation. however, alternative start codons hypothetically allowing translation initiation by leaky ribosomal scanning occurred. resulting preC would be unusually long. despite low amino acid identity of 54.1\u201355.3% between predicted HBeAg sequences of shrew and human HBVs, their 3D structures were closely related. ASR supported the existence of a conserved preC-encoding region at the Orthohepadnavirus MRCA (BF, 2.67) HTS of 10 CSHBV-positive and 5 MSHBVCIV-positive samples did not detect any additional divergent shrew HBV sequence in any sample. in CHB, HBeAg loss is associated with increased HBV genomic variability within infected individuals. in humans, infections with HBeAg-negative HBV are associated with severe hepatitis (30). infections with primarily HBeAg-negative HBV strains are associated with high viral loads, while HBeAg loss during CHB is commonly associated with low viral loads. 86 sera from Sorex and 57 sera from Crocidura tested. antibodies were only detected in 1 german and 1 african shrew. shrew hepatitis B may lead to death of the infected animals. german strains sampled in site B in 2008 differed by up to 4.1% of their genomes. a genomic diversity of up to 4.6% was observed in HBeAg-negative HBV strains during outbreaks in humans. no significant differences of shrew HBV detection rates were observed between male (4 of 161) and female (8 of 159) shrews (Fisher exact, P = 0.26) shrews and bat HBVs are consistent with the evidence for recombination events between shrew and the TBHBV, a new world bat HBV. the ancestors of the Noctilionoidea likely immigrated about 52 mya from the Old World into the New World (35), while shrews immigrated into the New World much later, about 13 mya (16). a different set of receptors for shrew HBV and potentially other HBV species may diversity of HBeAg-negative HBVs in wild shrews seems to be conserved between humans and shrews. differences in viral infection patterns between humans and animal reservoirs are well documented, including persistent infection of rodents with arenaviruses and hantaviruses. woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) models are generally suitable to study CHB (1). keeping woodchucks is costly and naturally occurring HBeAg-negative WHV variants are unknown."}
