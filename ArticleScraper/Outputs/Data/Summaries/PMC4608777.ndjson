{"summary": "MERS-CoV has been associated with the ongoing reporting of a severe respiratory disease in humans in parts of the Middle East [1], [2]. Accumulating evidence points to dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius), with only mild clinical signs of short duration, as an important reservoir of the virus. understanding the epidemiology of MERS-CoV in dromedary camel populations is critical in assessing and managing the risk to humans posed by the circulation laikipia county covers 9,666km2 and is characterized by a rainfall gradient of 900 mm/yr at the equator to 400 mm/yr on the northern boundary. land use includes commercial livestock ranches, pastoralist communal lands and wildlife conservancies. herds were selected opportunistically based on ease of access and willingness of owners to participate in the study. a 4-8ml blood sample was collected from the jugular vein using an 18 g needle. no animals were sacrificed for this study. residues 1\u2013676) and human coronavirus-OC43 (residues 1\u2013760) spike domain S1 antigens using extensively validated protein-microarray technology. HCoV-OC43 S1 was used as proxy for bovine CoV (BCoV), known to circulate commonly in dromedary camels. compared to adults, there was no statistical effect based on herd management type. prevalence in commercial herds (43.6%; 35.8\u201349.6), commercial/pastoralist herds (51.9%; 37.6\u201366.0) and nomadic herds (56.8%; 44.7\u201368.2) (X 2; P = 0.1) corman et al. (2014) demonstrated a 10% (7.2\u201313.5) seroprevalence from archived samples from Laikipia camels collected from 1992\u20132013. the seroprevalence of 46.9% in the current study is either comparable or lower than other African countries were MERS-CoV exposure has been studied. the absence of known human MERS-CoV cases in the Horn of Africa may be due to a lack of studies. studies should also focus on exposure in humans with (e.g., consumers) and without camel contact, together with an attempt to isolate and characterize the virus."}
