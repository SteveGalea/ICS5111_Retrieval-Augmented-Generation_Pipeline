{"summary": "RVF is characterized by an acute febrile illness, hemorrhagic fever, neurological disorder or blindness in humans [1], [2], [3], [4] in ruminants, RVFV induces a high rate of abortion or fetal malformation as well as lethal hepatitis in newborn lambs [5]. the first recognized outbreak of RVF occurred in Kenya in 1930 [6], and RVFV has spread from endemic region in sub-saharan Africa n, and Gc proteins, and L-segment encode for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [20], [21], [22], [23] NSs inhibits host antiviral response by inhibiting the activation of interferon (IFN)- promoter. dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) degradation [17], [27], [28]. recombinant MP-12 virus encoding truncated NSs at aa.210 to 230 does not inhibit IFN- mRNA synthesis. recombinant MP-12 virus encoding truncated NSs at aa.210 to 230 (SAP30-binding domain) does not inhibit IFN- mRNA synthesis. truncation using reverse genetics for the RVFV MP-12 strain. 11 recombinant MP-12 viruses encode NSs protein with a 17 to 25 aa. NSs mutants exhibited different plaque phenotypes in plaque assay. s encode in-frame 25 or 17 amino acid truncations. other 11 NSs mutants encode in-frame 25 or 17 amino acid truncations. none of NSs mutants, including NS210\u2013230 lacking SAP30-binding domain, had inhibited IFN- mRNA synthesis. a series of MP-12 encoding partially truncated NSs gene does not degrade PKR and inhibit IFN- mRNA synthesis. 293 cells were mock-transfected or transfected with in vitro transcribed RNA encoding CAT (control) or NSs of MP-12 or NS249\u2013265. at 16 hpi, cells were fixed with methanol for 5 min, and stained with anti-RVFV antibody (1:500) at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr and Alexa Fluor 594, goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) at 37\u00b0C for 1 293 cells were mock-infected or infected with MP-12 or recombinant MP-12 encoding partially truncated NSs at an moi of 3. cell lysates were collected at 16 hpi and nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were separated as described in materials and methods. PKR was degraded in infected cells mock-transfected or transfected with CAT RNA.

NSs-E253-255A/D257-259A, NSsD257-259A or NSs-E253-255A could form filamentous inclusion bodies. NSs-E253-255A/D257-259A or NSsD257-259A did not accumulate in cells efficiently, and the NSs could not be detected with IFA. NSs-E253-255A/D257-259A or NSsD257-259A did not degrade PKR. glutamic acid at aa.253 to 255 can be replaced without affecting NSs functions. recombinant MP-12 encoding NSs mutations were recovered. 293 cells were mock-infected or infected with rMP12-NSs-Flag. co-expression of NSs did not inhibit PKR degradation by rMP12-NSs-Flag. co-expression of NSs-E253-255A/D257-259A or NSs-E253-255A did not inhibit PKR degradation by rMP12-NSs-Flag. PKR (anti-PKR antibody), CAT-myc (anti-myc antibody) and -actin (anti-actin antibody) were detected by Western blot. total RNA was extracted at 7 hpi, and IFN- mRNA, ISG56 mRNA and RVFV anti-viral-sense S-RNA/N mRNA were detected. total RNA was extracted at 7 hpi, and Northern blot was performed to detect IFN-, ISG56 or RVFV S-RNA/N mRNA. none of those mutants attenuated NSs-mediated IFN- mRNA synthesis suppression. co-expression of NS249\u2013265 can inhibit MP-12 replication. truncation using reverse genetics for the RVFV MP-12 strain. 11 recombinant MP-12 viruses encode NSs protein with a 17 to 25 aa. plaques of NS6\u201330 and NS56\u201380 were clear in neutral red stain. the rMP12-C13type (C13type) encodes an in-frame truncation of aa.16\u2013198. other 11 NSs mutants encode in-frame 25 or 17 amino acid truncations. we tested the ISG56 gene, one of the genes controlled under IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE), to confirm the inhibition of host transcription suppression including IFN- mRNA. none of NSs mutants, including NS210\u2013230 lacking SAP30-binding domain, had inhibited IFN- mRNA synthesis. a series of MP-12 encoding partially truncated NSs gene does not degrade PKR and inhibit IFN- mRNA 293 cells were mock-transfected or transfected with in vitro transcribed RNA encoding CAT or NSs of MP-12 or NS249\u2013265. NS249\u2013265 was also accumulated in cytoplasm. NS249\u2013265 was also accumulated in cytoplasm.

PKR was abundantly detected in cells infected with MP-12 and NSs mutants. 293 cells were mock-infected or infected with rMP12-NSs-Flag. rMP12-NSs-Flag encoded flag-tagged NSs in place of intact NSs. cells were collected at 16 hpi, and abundance of PKR and RVFV proteins were analyzed by Western blot. PKR (anti-PKR antibody), NSs (anti-RVFV antibody), NSs-Flag (anti-flag antibody), CAT-myc (anti-actin antibody) and -actin (anti-actin antibody) were detected by Western blot. total RNA was extracted at 7 hpi, and IFN- mRNA, ISG56 mRNA and RVFV anti-viral-sense S-RNA/N mRNA were 293 cells were infected with moi 3 of rMP-12-NSs-SF. newly synthesized host and viral proteins were labeled with [35S] methionine/cysteine for 4 hours. the expression of truncated NSs was lower than that of MP-12 NSs. the expression of NSs206\u2013230 was not detectable. 93 cells were mock-infected or infected with rMP12-NSs-SF at an moi of 3. newly synthesized proteins were then labeled with [35S] methionine/cycteine. after incubation, newly synthesized proteins were then labeled with [35S] methionine/cycteine. mutants infected with NSs-E253-255A degraded PKR. NSs-E253-255A/D257-259A or NSsD257-259A did not degrade PKR. glutamic acid at aa.253 to 255 can be replaced without affecting NSs functions. total RNA was extracted at 7 hpi, and IFN- mRNA, ISG56 mRNA and RVFV anti-viral-sense S-RNA/N mRNA were detected by Northern blot with specific RNA probe. representative data from at least 3 independent experiments are shown. co-expression of NSs-E253-255A/D257-259A, NSsD257-259A or NSs-E253-255A in in cells were collected at 16 hpi, and NSs-Flag/NSs (a-RVFV antibody), NSs-Flag (a-Flag antibody), PKR (anti-PKR antibody), CAT-myc (anti-PKR antibody) and -actin (anti-actin antibody) were detected by Western blot. total RNA was extracted at 7 hpi, and Northern blot was performed to detect IFN-, ISG56 or RVFV S-RNA/N mRNA. none of those mutants attenuated NSs-mediated IFN- mRNA synthesis suppression. co-expression of NS249\u2013265 NSs inhibited neither NSs functions nor RVFV replication efficiently. NSs-E253-255A facilitates RVFV replication by inhibiting IFN- and PKR in transfected cells. truncation of NSs causes mis-folding and/or mis-localization of protein. NS249\u2013265 could accumulate both in cytoplasm and nucleus. co-expression of NS249\u2013265 NSs did not result in a significant decrease of RVFV replication in vivo.
