{"summary": "protective immunity against the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) has been achieved using a transgenically modified Plasmodium berghei sporozoite (Tg-Pb/PfCSP) and a self-assembling protein nanoparticle (SAPN) vaccine presenting CSP epitopes (PfCSP-SAPN) sterile host protection against a transgenic P. falciparum sporozoite expressing the P. falciparum CSP. this significantly inhibits native P. falciparum sporozoites from invading and developing within cultured human hepatocytes. the results may indicate the type and mode of action of protective antibodies needed to control P. falciparum sporozoites. malaria vaccinology suffers from a lack of understanding of viable mechanisms by which the host\u2019s immune system is able to efficiently respond to such a highly polymorphic parasite. there is little evidence to support correlations of vaccine-induced human Plasmodium immunity. gy with adaptive immune responses can often outweigh the immunological importance of either in isolation [12]. this paper examines several interactions between innate and adaptive immunity following SAPN immunization. results show SAPN-induced antibodies exhibit an ability to inhibit motility and induce complement (C\u2019) lysis of malaria parasites prior to liver infection. the gold-encapsulating SAPN were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) the PfCSP-SAPN displayed the (NANP) central repeat peptide of the PfCSP. the PfCSP-KMY-SAPN also displayed the central repeat peptide. recombinant murine Flt3-Ligand, 200 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF, 20 ng/ml recombinant human GM-CSF and 20 ng/ml recombinant human IL-4. cells were kept and used on day nine or ten of culture and treated/handled as described for flow cytometry. -5-labeled SAPN or ovalbumin at ten-minute, two-hour and overnight time points. slides were washed, fixed with methanol or 4% PAF. analysis was performed using confocal microscopy. 1 105 sporozoites were placed in 80% of either: serum from PfCSP-SAPN immunized animals, PfCSP-SAPN immunized mouse serum containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to chelate Ca2+, heat inactivated PfCSP-SAPN serum (heated at 56\u00b0C for forty-five minutes) or in serum from saline immunized animals in pre-warmed 96 2.5 105 sporozoites were incubated at room temperature for twenty minutes with a 1:50 dilution of the indicated serum or with the positive control, a mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody to P. falciparum repeats. after the three-hour incubation period, CPHH were washed twice: once with fresh media and then with Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution. a low speed spin (1,200 rpm for two minutes) was performed between the monomers were diluted 20-fold into 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol. the final molar ratio of protein chains per gold nanoparticle was 420:1. the gold-encapsulating SAPN were characterized by transmission electron microscopy. all animal protocols were conducted following review and approval by the WRAIR IACUC. anti-PfCSP antibody profiles were determined using IgG1, IgG2c, IgG3 and IgE isotype-specific goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-tagged secondary antibodies. confocal microscopy BMDDCs were harvested from culture, transferred to eight-well chamber slides, and allowed to adhere overnight. slides were washed, fixed with methanol or 4% PAF and DAPI was added prior to coverslipping. all samples were post-stained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate for five minutes at room temperature. samples were then analysed by transmission electron microscopy on a Jeol 100CX Electron Microscope. 1 105 sporozoites were placed in either: serum from PfCSP-SAPN immunized animals. FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG was added at a 1:40 dilution in 1% Evans Blue solution and the slide was incubated for thirty minutes at 37\u00b0C. the slide was then washed again three times in 1 PBS as described previously and allowed to air dry. a quantitative real-time qRT-PCR was used to determine the invasion/development rate. the invasion/development rate of each test (IT) sample is compared to the invasion/development rate of the negative control to give a percent inhibition. antibodies that bind to the PfCSP repeat sequence expressed on the genetically modified P. berghei parasite showed a significant predominance of anti-CSP Th2-type IgG1 antibodies. it was important to determine if the antibodies induced by the SAPN vaccine also bound to CSP on native P. falciparum sporozoites. in sporozoite killing, the morphology of P. falciparum sporozoites was examined following co-incubation with or without serum containing CSP-specific antibodies. after five to twenty minutes of co-incubation there were obvious morphological changes between parasites treated with serum from PfCSP-SAPN immunized mice and control sera. if added to serum to chelate calcium ions, the normal parasite phenotype was maintained. sporozoites were incubated with either PfCSP-SAPN immunized serum taken two weeks post third immunization (Panel A) or serum from (Panel A) treated to remove Ca2+ ions (Panel B), serum from (Panel A) heat-inactivated in order to inactivate C\u2019 (Panel C), serum from (Panel D) or serum from mice immunized with PvC PfCSP-SAPN-induced antibody is able to deter sporozoite liver stage development in a concentration dependent manner. hepatocytes cultured in the presence of P. falciparum sporozoites and serum from either PfCSP-SAPN-immunized mice (at 1:20, 1:200, or 1:1,000 dilution) cal microscopy shows that SAPN have delayed processing in EE organelles. the timing is consistent with a cross-presenting mechanism for SAPN. the continuous recruitment of TAP to the EE indicates that SAPN are highly localized (with TAP) for extended time periods at the organelle membrane. TEM images taken at either ten minutes (Panels A, B) or twenty-four hours (Panels C, D) following co-culture of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and either ovalbumin (Panels A, C) or PfCSP-SAPN (Panels B, D), were possible to do in a murine model using a transgenic Plasmodium falciparum. ium berghei sporozoite has had the full-length circumsporozoite protein (csp) gene replaced with that of P. falciparum[22]. it was undertaken here to demonstrate if the SAPN-induced antibodies were of a particular isotype and if the classical pathway of C\u2019 was involved in protection. immunofluorescence assay of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites incubated with Pf CSP-SAPN immune sera at a 1:20 dilution. preimmune sera from the mice, sera from PvCSP-SAPN immunized mice, and secondary antibody only sera tests resulted in negative immunofluorescence. anti-PfCSP-SAPN antibodies are able to activate and induce changes in the morphology of P. falciparum sporozoites by the induction of the classical pathway of C\u2019. the classical pathway of C\u2019 present in sera was not able to affect these changes in morphology in the absence of PfCSP-SAPN-induced antibodies. a series of inhibition of liver stage development assays were performed using primary human hepatocytes. sporozoites were exposed to serum from PfCSP-SAPN-immunized mice. this inhibition was not observed when using serum from PvCSP-SAPN or PBS-sham immunized mice. results of confocal microscopy show that SAPN have delayed processing in EE organelles, which can last up to twenty-four hours. the timing is consistent with a cross-presenting mechanism for SAPN, which has the potential to enhance resulting cellular immunity. TEM images taken at either ten minutes (Panels A, B) or twenty-four hours (Panels C, D) following co-culture of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and either ovalbumin (Panels A, C) or PfCSP-SAPN (Panels B, D) in the case of malaria, the limited natural host immunity that is observed in endemic areas is short lived if the person leaves the exposure area. attempts to mimic natural immune responses to infection have had significant advances but limited overall success. a major hindrance to this work is a lack of knowledge of the specific correlates of immunity and mechanisms of protection required for malaria infection. this study indirectly demonstrates the role of C\u2019 the use of specific inhibitors of C\u2019 activation [30] would be important to further corroborate the importance of the classical pathway in this process of C\u2019 action. this effective concert between innate and adaptive immune responses has the potential to eliminate the majority of sporozoites as they migrate from the site of injection by mosquito to the liver. anti-CSP monoclonal antibodies work without C\u2019 in the process. the requirement for cross-presentation of proteins is not absolute. the classical processing of SAPN could be accounted for by presence of the universal pan CD4 helper epitope, PADRE. cross-presentation goes against the dogma that primarily endogenously derived protein epitopes are loaded to MHC class I molecules. cross-presentation of exogenously-delivered peptides has been one of the great enigmas of immunology. segregated SAPN processing, as well as recruitment of TAP to early endosome organelles is a mechanism of cross-presentation taken by SAPN. this enabled slow and continuous presentation of antigen to the adaptive immune system. this model of peptide processing promotes induction of long-lived cellular responses to vaccine-delivered peptides.
