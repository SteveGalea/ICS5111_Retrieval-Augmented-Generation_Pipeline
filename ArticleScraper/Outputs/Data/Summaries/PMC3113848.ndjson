{"summary": "an AMA1 vaccine was tested in a malaria nave population. it induced functionally active antibodies judged by growth inhibition assay. however, the same vaccine failed to induce higher growth-inhibitory activity. anti-malaria IgGs induced by natural exposure may interfere with the biological effect of an AMA1-based vaccine in the target population. a passive transfer study has shown the importance of gamma-globulin against blood-stages of P. falciparum. a high level of AMA1 antibodies is associated with a reduced risk of malaria [11]. multiple AMA1 Phase 1 trials [14]\u2013[24] and a Phase 2 field trial [25] have been conducted and published. however, no significant protective effects have been shown in the target population of African children. -AMA1 IgG which can bind to malaria extract reduced the functional activity of the AMA1 antibodies from U.S. vaccinees. the AMA1 vaccine did not induce higher growth-inhibitory activity in the malian adults in the vaccine trial. the non-AMA1 IgGs showed an interference effect on growth-inhibitory activity. adults 18\u201345 years of age were enrolled and immunized on days 0 and 28 either with 80 g of AMA1-C1 on Alhydrogel\u00ae or a comparator vaccine (Hiberix\u00ae) both trials were conducted under Investigational New Drug Applications reviewed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. individual informed consent was obtained after oral translation of consent form into local language. parents or guardians unable to read placed an imprint of his/her finger in place of a signature; an independent witness also signed all consent forms. total IgGs were purified from individual plasma samples from the u.s. trial (n = 5) and normal U.S. sera (n = 2) using Protein G columns as described previously [14].

GIA The standard methodology for the GIA has been described previously [14] adults 18\u201345 years of age were enrolled in the trial. they were immunized on days 0, 28 and 56 with 20 or 80 g of AMA1-C1. blood samples were collected on days 0 and 42. both trials were conducted under investigational new drug applications. total IgGs were purified from individual plasma samples from the trial. all of the total IgGs were dialyzed against RPMI 1640. total IgG was prepared from each plasma sample collected on days 0 and 42 from the trial.

GIA The standard methodology for the GIA has been described previously [14]. the assay was performed with purified IgGs at indicated concentrations against the 3D7 or FVO strain of P. falciparum parasites. the concentration of US-total IgG was determined at which the IgG was expected to give 60% inhibition. the antibody levels of each total IgG pool and non-AMA1(3D7)/AMA1(FVO) IgG were measured by ELISA. the non-AMA1 IgGs had less than 10% of AMA1 antibody levels compared to the original total IgG pools. symmetrical sigmoid curve (r2 = 0.99 for 3D7, 0.94 for FVO) results indicate there was no obvious difference in biological activity of antibodies among AMA1-specific IgGs induced by an AMA1 vaccination (IgGs from U.S. vaccinees), by natural infection (IgGs from D0-1, 2, 3 & 4 and Hib-1, 2 & 3 pools) non-AMA1 IgGs show comparable levels of growth-inhibitory activity. non-AMA1 IgGs were tested against P. falciparum 3D7 (A) or FVO (B) parasites at 10 or 20 mg/ml in GIA well. AMA1 IgGs and US-total IgG showed lower inhibition for 3D7 and FVO parasites compared to the US-total IgG alone. the difference between US-total IgG alone and the mixture was calculated (delta % inhibition) or anti-AMA1(FVO) (B) antibody levels (g/ml) in the original total IgG pools (x-axis) are plotted against delta % inhibition of each non-AMA1 IgG (y-axis) tested with P. falciparum 3D7 (A) or FVO (B) parasites. the same assay was conducted using total IgG from another U.S. vaccinee and also showed no competition. therefore it does not appear that the interfering effect is due to direct inhibition of the anti-AMA1 antibodies binding to the plate antigen. the AMA1-specific IgGs from malian children showed almost the same level of growth-inhibitory activity at the same level of antibody in the GIA well. there was no obvious difference in biological activity of antibodies among AMA1-specific IgGs induced by an AMA1 vaccination. each AMA1-specific IgG was tested at three (for U.S. IgGs) or two (for Mali IgGs) different concentrations. each AMA1-specific IgG was tested at three (for U.S. IgGs) or two (for Mali IgGs) different concentrations. non-AMA1 IgGs interfere with AMA1 IgG activity in GIA. non-AMA1 IgGs were tested either by themselves or in the presence of total IgG from a U.S. vaccinee against homologous strain of parasites. non-AMA1 IgGs from malian children reduce growth-inhibitory activity of US-total IgG. four mg/ml of non-AMA1(3D7) IgGs were tested either by themselves (left side) or with US-total IgG (left side) using P. falciparum 3D7 parasites. competition ELISA was performed to test whether the interfering effect of non-AMA1 IgGs was due to the blocking of binding between AMA1 antigen and anti-AMA1 antibody. the mixtures were applied to AMA1(3D7) or AMA1(FVO)-coated ELISA plates as primary antibodies and the amount of antibodies which bound to AMA1 protein was measured. study was performed using non-AMA(FVO) IgGs and an AMA1(FVO)-coated ELISA plate. the non-AMA1 IgGs interfere with the growth-inhibitory activity of anti-AMA1 antibodies obtained from malaria nave U.S. volunteers vaccinated with AMA1. non-AMA1 IgG is the only reported antibodies which have been shown to interfere with the growth-inhibitory activity induced by human antigen-specific polyclonal antibodies. however, it is not clear whether such \u201cblocking\u201d antibodies interfere with the activity of anti-MSP1 antibody, especially the activity of polyclonal antibodies, in a biological assay. the amount of anti-AMA1 antibody coming from the non-AMA1 IgG was less than 5% compared to the one from US-total IgG. the results suggest that either binding between AMA1 protein and non-AMA1 IgGs was too weak to detect by conventional ELISA. the interference effect of non-AMA1 IgG from malian children is relatively low. we found that the higher AMA1 titer reflects more malaria exposure. the correlation between anti-AMA1 antibody levels in the original total IgG pool and the strength of interference effect in non-AMA1 IgG suggests that the interference effect is due to antibody against a malaria antigen other than AMA1. if we use non-AMA1 IgGs at 10 or 20 mg/ml, several of them show >20% inhibition by themselves. the mixture cannot show lower inhibition than non-AMA1 IgG alone. it is reasonable to assume that non-AMA1 IgGs interfere with growth-inhibitory activity of AMA1-specific IgG at physiological ratio. non-AMA1 IgGs from children immunized with the AMA1 vaccine showed the same interference (AMA1-3) or less (AMA1-2) interference than those from children without AMA1 vaccination with the same AMA1 levels in the original total IgG pools. polymorphism is one of the major obstacles to make a broadly effective vaccine [11] anti-AMA1 antibodies induced both by malaria infection [26], [27] and by an AMA1 immunization in malaria nave individuals [14], [16], [19], [21]\u2013[23] show growth-inhibitory activity. a recent clinical challenge trial with AMA1 vaccine in a malaria nave population has shown that there is a significant correlation between in vivo parasite multiplication-rate and growth-inhibitory activity. anti-AMA1-specific IgGs were separated from total IgG pools of malian children. the AMA1-depleted IgG showed the same level of inhibition as the original total IgG pool. however, the AMA1-depleted IgG showed the same level of inhibition as the original total IgG pool. inhibitory activity measured by the GIA reflects some mechanism of protection in vivo. the results suggest that pre-existing anti-malaria immunity may modulate the efficacy of the AMA1 vaccine."}
