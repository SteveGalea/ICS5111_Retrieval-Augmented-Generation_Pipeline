{"summary": "west Nile virus (WNV) is the most widespread flavivirus present in all continents except Antarctica. up to 9 different genetic lineages have been described so far. most human infections are asymptomatic, but approximately 20% develop a febrile illness with flu-like symptoms. re-examination of the sample was performed at the department of Virology of the Medical University of Vienna, the Austrian National Reference Laboratory for Flavivirus Infections. the results were confirmed by the Austrian Federal Office for Safety in Health Care (BASG) and the Austrian Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) the original plasma sample was independently investigated in the Czech laboratory for the presence of neutralizing antibodies against WNV strain Eg-101. it was also used for virus isolation attempts. the mosquitoes investigated in this study were collected on public land. sample screening was performed with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA) for nucleic acid extraction 140 l of each sample was used. RT-qPCR targeting the highly conserved 5 non-coding region (NCR) was performed. the RT-PCR assays were carried out using one step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, USA). the purified PCR fragments were then premixed with the corresponding individual PCR primers (concentration of 2 M each) the obtained WNV sequences were manually verified and compiled to continuous sequences. phylogenetic analysis For phylogenetic analysis, nucleic acid sequences which encode the entire polyproteins but represent unique genomes were selected. for better resolution only WNV lineage 2 sequences were chosen, altogether 36 sequences were excluded from the analysis. n european cluster all new Austrian viruses and isolates and the nine most closely related viruses were subjected to detailed genetic distance analysis. for confirmation of the morphologic typing, WNV-positive samples were investigated by a PCR assay within the mitochondrial 12S rDNA gene recommended for molecular determination of widely divergent arthropods. this case was also reported to the ECDC (http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/west_nile_fever/West-Nile-fever-maps/pages/index.aspx). this investigation was part of a non-research public health emergency response and therefore exempt from the Institutional Review Board process of the City of Vienna. the mosquitoes investigated in this study were collected on public land as part of the Austrian mosquito surveillance program. a RT-qPCR targeting the highly conserved 5 non-coding region (NCR) was performed for confirmation and lineage determination. RT-PCR, sequencing and sequence alignment All positive samples and isolates were identified by various RT-PCRs targeting the complete WNV genome by employing published primer pairs specific for WNV lineage 2 [12], as well as self-designed primers specific for the Austrian WNV strains. the purified PCR fragments were then premixed with the PCR fragments. the obtained WNV sequences were manually verified and compiled to continuous sequences. nucleotide sequences of the new WNVs were submitted to BLAST. all complete genomic WNV sequences were downloaded individually in FASTA format. phylogenetic analysis For phylogenetic analysis, nucleic acid sequences which encode the entire polyproteins but represent unique genomes were selected. for better resolution only WNV lineage 2 sequences were chosen, altogether 36 sequences were selected. the newly described Austrian complete WNV sequences are available from GenBank under accession numbers KP109691 (WNV lin. 2, blood donor/Vienna/2014) the 388 bp long 12S rDNA gene sequence of the WNV-positive Cx. pipiens is available in GenBank under accession number KP109692 (WNV lin. 2, blood donor/Vienna/2014) oculated mice died after 6\u201311 days (AST = 8.5 days), and s.c. inoculated mice died after 10 and more days. the obtained isolates are named SPF i.c. and SPF i.p. pipiens P 15 500 15 FH Ottakring 08.09.14 Cx. pipiens P 15 500 16 FH Ottakring 08.09.14 Cx. pipiens P 15 500 18 FH Ottakring 08.09.14 Cx. pipiens P 15 500 20 FH Ottakring 08.09.14 Cx. pipiens P 15 500 22 FH Ottakring 08.09.14 Cx. pipiens P 15 500 25 FH Ottakring 08.09.14 Cx pipiens L 15 500 37 Sch\u00f6nbrunn 02.09.14 Cx. pipiens L 20 600 38 Sch\u00f6nbrunn 02.09.14 Cx. pipiens A 1 300 42 Sch\u00f6nbrunn 02.09.14 An. plumbeus A 1 300 43 Sch\u00f6nbrunn 10.09.14 Cx. pipiens A 15 500 The two WNV-positive samples are marked with (+) a total of 4 different mosquito species were identified: Cx. pipiens (41 pools, n = 595), anopheles (An.) maculipennis group (2 pools, n = 6), Culiseta (Cs.) annulata (1 pool, n = 1), and An. plumbeus (1 pool, n = 1);
