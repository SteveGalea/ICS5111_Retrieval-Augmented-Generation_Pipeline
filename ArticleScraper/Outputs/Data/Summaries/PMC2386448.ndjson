{"summary": "a time periodic geographical disease surveillance system based on a cylindrical space-time scan statistic has been used extensively for disease surveillance along with the SaTScan software. some spatial scan statistics are aimed at detecting irregularly shaped clusters which may not be detected by the circular spatial scan statistic. a spate of recent interest in the development of geographic surveillance systems that can detect changes in spatial patterns of disease. the circular spatial scan statistic has been used extensively for the detection and evaluation of purely spatial disease clusters along with the SaTScan software. the flexible spatial scan statistic is based on the flexible purely spatial scan statistic [16] and the prospective space-time scan statistic [10] in order to evaluate its performance we propose a space-time power distribution by extending the purely spatial bivariate power distribution [16]. the cylindrical space-time scan statistic uses a cylindrical window in three dimensions where the base of the cylinder represents space and the height represents time. the cylindrical space-time scan statistic imposes a circular base Z on each centroid of regions for each of T time intervals. a flexible space-time scan statistic proposes a three dimensional prismatic window with an arbitrarily shaped base Z. for any given region i, we create the set of arbitrarily shaped bases consisting of k connected regions (1 k K) including i. the connected regions are restricted as the subset of the K-nearest neighbors to the region i. for the Poisson model, let nW be the expected number in window W under the null hypothesis, so that G = N for G, the entire study space in three dimensions. it can then be shown that L ( W ) L 0 = ( n W W ) n W (5) if nW > W, and L(W)/L0 = 1 otherwise. the data are geographically aggregated to ZIP codes. i1 and i2, i2 and i3 are adjacent each other, but i1 and i3 are not adjacent. if the data of i2 does not exist, then it is assumed that i1 and i3 are not directly connected. the clusters detected by both tests from august 8 to 10 are not signals of an outbreak because the number of cases on August 8 must be 0, and on August 9 and 10, the number of cases of the cluster was decreasing. the flexible scan statistic detected significant clusters with larger RIs, 333 days and 250 days respectively, while the cylindrical scan statistic detected a cluster with a temporal length of 6 days. flexible Aug.07 01951 Aug.02\u201307 7 0.0427 27.949 2.7 years(0.001) Aug.08 01951

located cases of a hypothetical disease or syndrome, generated either under the null model with no outbreaks or under one of eight different alternative models with an outbreak in one of four different locations. for each of the null and alternative models, three different sets of data sets were generated, with 31, 32, and 33 days. clusters (i) cluster A, (ii) cluster A5, (iii) The Rockaways, and (iv) Hudson River. a period of T = 3 days was used as the maximum temporal length of the cluster. a period of T = 3 days was used as the maximum temporal length of the cluster. calculated is the proportion of the 1,000 random data sets that had a higher log likelihood ratio than the critical value obtained from the null data sets. the cylindrical space-time scan statistic has higher power for the three more compact clusters, while the flexible space-time scan statistic have higher power for the long and narrow the Hudson River cluster. 610 0.845 0.782 0.803 Space-time

is again more likely to include all the five areas in the true cluster (667 + 4 + 1 = 672 versus 1 + 0 + 1 = 1). will compute the extended power of spatial cluster detection tests. we can consider two types of spatial misclassifications. one is a false negative test result (FN) in which the CDT misses a region in the true cluster. another is a false positive test result (FP) in which the CDT incorrectly detects a region that is not present in the true cluster. the power for which the MLC includes all the regions within the true cluster as I(1, 0). the power for which the MLC includes all the regions within the true cluster as I(1, 0). we define sensitivity of cluster detection tests as probability of detecting the regions that actually constitute the cluster, i.e. proportion of the number of regions correctly detected from the true cluster, s/s*. sensitivity of cluster detection tests is defined in a similar manner as the proportion of the number of true regions in the detected cluster, i.e., s/l under l > 0,. the same is true for the Rockaway cluster. the flexible scan statistic has higher PPV than the cylindrical. this difference in sensitivity is less than the difference in PPV that goes the other way. day 32 flexible (K = 20) 0.994 92.22 70.17 92.94 76.73 cylindrical (K = 20) 0.996 88.78 85.14 90.86 89.41 cylindrical (50% pop) 0.996 88.96 84.81 91.05 89.11 Day 33

regions (for example, counties, ZIP codes, enumeration districts, etcetera) each region is periodically reporting the number of cases of a disease or syndrome under study. cylindrical space-time scan statistic imposes a circular base Z on each centroid of regions for each of T time intervals. for each centroids, the radius of the circle is varied from zero up to a pre-set maximum radius, so that the window never includes more than 50% of the total population at risk. all the windows to be scanned are the prisms whose base is included in the set Z 2 = Z i k ( j ) | 1 i m, 1 k K, 1 j j i k (3) with height in the set Y. the cylindrical scan statistic consider K concentric circles plus all the sets of connected regions including the single region i. the window for which the likelihood ratio is maximized identifies the most likely cluster (MLC) [8]. p-value of the test is based upon the null distribution of LLR with large number B of Monte Carlo replications of data sets generated under the null hypothesis. data for over a year in MA, the expected number of cases were calculated as the predicted means from a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) we set K = 20 as the maximum length of the geographical window, and the maximum temporal length to be T = 7 days. the number of replications for the Monte Carlo procedure was set to B = 999. the flexible scan statistic detected significant clusters with larger RIs, 333 days and 250 days respectively. the cylindrical scan statistic also detected a cluster on August 15 (RI = 1.4 years) with a temporal length of 6 days, while the cylindrical scan statistic detected a cluster with a temporal length of 5 days (RI = 200 days) 0.0545 21.562 2.7 years(0.001) Aug.10 01951 Aug.04\u201310 5 0.0545 17.315 2.7 years(0.001) Table 2.
