{"summary": "the application of immunosuppressive drugs has contributed significantly to the success of allograft survival. side effects resulted from immunosuppression or drug toxicity also markedly impact the quality of life of recipients [2], [3]. there is emerging evidence that other than mediation of allograft rejection, DCs also possess the capability to induce allograft tolerance. autophagy in eukaryotic cells is a cellular quality control process to deliver cytoplasmic constituents for lysosomal degradation. in the steady state, autophagy-mediated antigen processing in thymic epithelial cells could have a crucial role in the induction and maintenance of CD4+ T-cell tolerance [12], [13]. recipients treated with Flt3L doubled allograft MST (13.11.287 days, Fig. 1A) a significant enhanced graft survival was observed in mice treated with Flt3L and low-dose of Rapa. about 20% of recipients showed long-term graft survival (MST>100 days, Fig. 1A) a significantly higher proportion of splenic CD8a+ DCs in flet3L or flet3L/Rapa treated mice. our data suggest that Flt3Lcombined with Rapa could induce the expansion of regulatory DCs in the recipient mice. Flt3L combined with Rapa significantly blocked CD11c+ DC maturation as manifested by decreased CD40, CD80 expression. recipients treated with Flt3L and low-dose of Rapa displayed a significant increase for CCR9+ pDCs as compared with those treated with Flt3L or Rapa alone or other groups. the expression of Foxp3 by CD4+ CD25+ and CD8+ CD25+ Foxp3+ T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. the bar graph was a summary of percentages of CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ and CD8+ Foxp3+ T cells in the recipients. t3L/Rapa therapy favors anergic induction in alloreactive T cells. cells originated from cardiac allograft recipient mice at the time of rejection or at study endpoint (POD 100) were used as responder cells for MLR assay with donor-derived DCs. naive recipients were transplanted with cardiac allograft. the survival time of cardiac allografts was monitored. treatment with Flt3L/Rapa enhances the autophagy in the cardiac allograft. cytoplasmic extracts of cardiac allograft tissue were subjected to Western blotting for evaluating the expression level of Beclin-1 and LC3B. about 20% of recipients showed long-term graft survival (MST>100 days, Fig. 1A) in contrast, a significant enhanced graft survival was observed in mice treated with Flt3L and low-dose of Rapa. a significant reduction for inflammatory infiltration was observed in the allograft sections. pDCs from recipients treated with Flt3L/Rapa display a tolerogenic phenotype. pDCs were stained with PE-cy7-labeled anti-mouse CD11c mAb, Per-cy5.5-labeled anti-mouse CD8a mAb, FITC-labeled anti-mouse CCR9 mAb. recipients treated with Flt3L and low-dose of Rapa showed a significant increase for CCR9+ pDCs. splenic T cells isolated from each group of recipient mice were stained for intracellular Foxp3 after co-staining with anti-CD4/CD25 antibodies or anti-CD3/CD8/CD25 antibodies. the expression of Foxp3 by CD4+ CD25+ and CD8+ CD25+ T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry after intracellular staining. the data are representative of three independent experiments that yield comparable results (* P0.05). allograft recipient mice at the time of rejection or at study endpoint (POD 100) were used as responder cells for MLR assay with donor-derived DCs (DC: T ratio of 15) the culture supernatants were harvested and cytokine IL-10 levels were quantified by ELISA. the survival time of cardiac allografts was monitored. treatment with Flt3L/Rapa therapy mediated protection against allograft rejection. extracts of cardiac allograft tissue were subjected to Western blotting for evaluating the expression level of Beclin-1 and LC3B. the cardiac allograft survival time in recipients treated with Flt3L/Rapa and 3-MA (24 mg/kg, i.p, 5, 10, 15 days) was significant shorter than that of the recipients treated with Flt3L/Rapa. several DC subsets have been reported to promote tolerance induction. the CD11c+ CD8a+ DC subset could promote peripheral self-tolerance and prolong survival of cardiac allografts in rodents. infusion of rapamycin with Rapa and Rapa alone enhances production of CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ Tregs. splenic CD8+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells have been found to inhibit antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses by cell contact inhibition. autophagy delivers self-proteins for MHC class II loading. peptidic fragments are essential for the deletion of self-reactive T cells in the thymus. autophagy plays a role in removal of apoptotic cell corpses. mouse CD4 (L3T4) MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, CA), Mouse CD8a (Ly-2) MicroBeads were derived from Miltenyi Biotec, CA. Rapamycin was purchased from Wyeth, USA; 3-Methyladenine was purchased from Sigma. antibodies for beclin-1,and LC3B were purchased from cell signaling. plasmid was cloned into a pGEX-4T3 vector with a glutathione S-transferase tag. recombinant Flt3L expression was induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG. rGST and rGST were stored in aliquots at 80\u00b0C until use. Graft Histology Allograft samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. serial sections (5 m in thickness) were prepared using a microtome and stained with hematoxylin/eosin for the analysis of pathological changes. Flow Cytometric Analysis Spleen cells isolated from mice treated with Flt3L/Rapa were incubated with anti-CD16/CD32 monoclonal antibody to block FcR. c mice were kept at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. supernatants were recovered after 7 days for determination of IL-10 production. blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence. pDCs were isolated using a mouse Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Isolation Kit II. the purified CD4+ T cells (5106), CD8+ T cells (5106), pDCs (5105) and total splenocytes (5106) originated from recipients with long-term survival allograft were then adoptively transferred into naive recipients. one day after the adoptive transfer, the mice were transplanted with cardiac allografts. anti-Mouse CD11c (clone N418), Per-cy5.5-labeled anti-Mouse B220 (clone RA3-6B2), FITC-labeled anti-Mouse CCR9 (clone CW-1.2), PE-labeled anti-rat CD3 (clone G4.18), PE-cy7-labeled anti-Mouse CD3 (clone 145-2C11), APC- t3L expression was induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG. a GST vector protein was also expressed and purified to homogeneity. the proteins were passed over polymyxin B columns (PIERCE) to remove any contaminated LPS. mAb, per-cy5.5-labeled anti-mouse B220 mAb, FITC-labeled anti-mouse CCR9 mAb, FITC-labeled anti-mouse CCR9 mAb, FITC-labeled anti-mouse CD40 mAb. splenocytes were isolated from the recipient mice and subsequently co-stained with CD4, CD25 or CD3. cells were blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) the membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies for Beclin-1, LC3B and GAPDH. the non-specific proteins were blocked with 5\u201310% goat serum for 10 min.
