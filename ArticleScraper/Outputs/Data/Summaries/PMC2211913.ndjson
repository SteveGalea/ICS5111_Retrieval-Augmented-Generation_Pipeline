{"summary": "secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) was originally identified as a serine protease inhibitor at portals of pathogen entry and in mucosal fluids (1). SLPI has been associated with multiple functions relevant to innate host defense (2\u20139). a cell surface receptor for SLPI has remained elusive. annexin II exists as a monomer (p36) or a heterotetramer constructed of two p36 and two p11(S100A10) subunits, and traffics to the cell surface by an unknown mechanism (18). annexin II has not previously been linked to HIV-1. 40 medium containing 2 mM l-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 g/ml streptomycin and 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. rhSLPI and NHS-LC-biotin were diluted in PBS on ice and incubated for 2 h. 106 cells cultured in four-chamber glass slides (Nunc) were incubated with biotinylated rhSLPI from 5 s to 60 min at 37\u00b0C, washed, and neutravidin-FITC in PBS was added for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. monocytes were plated on glass coverslips in 24-well plates (2 106 per well) and cultured as described above for 7\u201310 d. ethanol permeabilized at 20\u00b0C for 5 min, blocked in 10% donkey serum for 30 min. 2 g/ml of primary antibody was added in 2% donkey serum in PBS. cells were washed twice in PBS, twice in dH2O, mounted using fluormount G. Membrane protein fractions were sonicated and proteins were quantitated. beads were pelleted for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. supernatant was incubated with rhSLPI for 5\u201310 min on ice. the gels were stained with colloidal blue, destained, photographed, and the desired protein band(s) was marked before storage at 4\u00b0C. cDNA was amplified for 25 cycles with following settings: 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 68\u00b0C for 30 s. xin II siRNA 1 and 2 were synthesized based on sequence r(GCACUGAAGUCAGCCUUUUUU)/r(AAUAGGCCCAAAAUCACCGUC; QIAGEN) the cells were incubated 6 d before analysis of annexin protein by Western blot. macrophages were pretreated for 1 h with 25 g/ml rabbit anti\u2013annexin II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), 25 g/ml rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), or 10 g/ml SLPI before the addition of virus. after coculture for 2 h, virus and/or added reagents were removed by washing cells with DMEM and fresh complete medium was added. 96-well plates were coated with 60 g/ml BSA (Sigma-Aldrich), annexin II tetramer, IgG, or gp120 (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) overnight at 4\u00b0C, washed with PBS, and blocked or not with 1% BSA for 1\u20132 h. after multiple washes with PBS, 100 l of lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X- first 35-cycle round of amplification used primers corresponding to the env gene. each cycle consisted of denaturation for 1 min at 94\u00b0C, annealing for 1 min at 55\u00b0C, and elongation for 1 min at 72\u00b0C. PCR reactions from the first amplification were then subjected to a second 30-cycle amplification round. rhSLPI was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mM l-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 g/ml streptomycin, and 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. to remove unreacted biotin, the mixture was centrifuged using centricon filters (YM-3; Millipore) 106 cells cultured in four-chamber glass slides were incubated with biotinylated rhSLPI from 5 s to 60 min at 37\u00b0C. monocytes were plated on glass coverslips in 24-well plates (2 106 per well) before staining, coverslips were washed in PBS, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. 2 g/ml of primary antibody (mouse anti\u2013annexin II; Transduction Labs) was added in 2% donkey serum in PBS. cells were washed twice in PBS, twice in dH2O, mounted using a microscope. cells were stained with 1 M carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester. Membrane protein fractions were sonicated and proteins were quantitated. beads were pelleted for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. supernatant was incubated with rhSLPI for 5\u201310 min on ice. the gels were stained with colloidal blue, destained, photographed, and the desired protein band(s) was marked before storage at 4\u00b0C. total cellular RNA was extracted using the RNeasy minikit (QIAGEN) annexin II siRNA 1 and 2 were synthesized based on the sequence r(GCACUGAAGUCAGCCUUUUU)/r(AUAAGGCUGACUUCAGUGCUG) and r(AAUAGGCCCAAAAUCACCGUC; QIAGEN). an unrelated control siRNA was also purchased from QIAGEN. cell/virus mixture was diluted to 30 ml with complete media (RPMI 1640, 10% FCS, 1% gentamycin, and 5% IL-2) on days 2, 4, 6, and 8 after infection, cells were pelleted, the media was replaced, and day 6 and 8 culture supernatants were tested for p24 and RT activity. macrophages were pretreated for 1 h with 25 g/ml rabbit anti\u2013annexin II (Santa Cruz Bio natants were collected every 2\u20133 d for p24 ELISA. 96-well plates were coated with 60 g/ml BSA (Sigma-Aldrich), annexin II tetramer, IgG, or gp120 (NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) overnight at 4\u00b0C, washed with PBS, and blocked or not with 1% BSA for 1\u20132 h. after multiple washe first 35-cycle round of amplification used primers corresponding to the env gene. each cycle consisted of denaturation for 1 min at 94\u00b0C, annealing for 1 min at 55\u00b0C, and elongation for 1 min at 72\u00b0C. PCR reactions were then subjected to a second 30-cycle amplification round. hSLPI\u2013biotin\u2013neutravidin\u2013FITC complexes were evident within 1 min, peaked at 15\u201330 min (Fig. 1 B) and frequently appeared to polarize before emerging in the cytosol. annexin II was confirmed with monoclonal anti\u2013annexin II and rhSLPI coimmunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting. SLPI membrane\u2013binding protein band was identified by mass spectrometry as actin. actin does not interact with rhSLPI directly, but rather associates with annexin II as part of a trimolecular complex. the absence of fluorescence staining of annexin II on CD4+ blood mononuclear cells was confirmed by their lack of detectable annexin II membrane protein by Western blot. annexin II mRNA expression was higher in macrophages than freshly isolated blood monocytes. annexin II is a cofactor for HIV infection. infection was monitored by HIV-1 p24 antigen levels and by ultrastructural evidence of viral replication. decreased expression of annexin II using RNAi was not absolute. suppression of annexin II protein by RNAi was likely related to inability to transfect all cells. ants were removed, replaced with fresh medium, and tested for p24 antigen. ants were treated with anti-annexin, IgG, or SLPI for 60 min. supernatants were removed, replaced with fresh medium. annexin II appears to play no role in infection of cells with either Ebola virus or with SARS coronavirus. annexin II appears to selectively contribute to the pathway by which HIV-1 infects human macrophages. immunoplates coated with indicated proteins overnight at 4\u00b0C. 100 l HIV-1 (104/ml) was added for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. data represent mean and SEM (n = 2). blockade of annexin II on macrophages did not significantly interrupt HIV-1 binding to the cells. anti\u2013annexin II was incorporated into a fusion assay in which effector cells expressing recombinant Env were cocultured with target cells expressing recombinant CD4 and coreceptors. annexin II was ineffective in interrupting this fusion process. the presence of anti\u2013annexin II during the virus inoculation period dramatically inhibited subsequent viral DNA synthesis. interference with macrophage membrane annexin II inhibits infectivity after binding, but pre-reverse transcription, consistent with a stranglehold on the viral entry/fusion step. inylated rhSLPI detected with streptavidin-FITC fluorescence. left curve represents staining with streptavidin-FITC only. SLPI membrane\u2013binding protein identification by LC-MS/MS. annexin II was detected in whole cell lysates of epithelial (A431), but not on a monocytic cell line (U937) the detected binding between annexin II and rhSLPI was typically higher on differentiated macrophages than on freshly isolated blood monocytes. annexin II mRNA expression was higher in macrophages than freshly isolated blood monocytes. by RT-PCR, annexin II mRNA expression was higher in macrophages than freshly isolated blood monocytes. suppression of annexin II protein by RNAi was not absolute. reduced levels of annexin II were sufficient to interrupt the infection process. annexin II levels were specific to annexin II levels. no substantive change in these viral recognition and binding receptors was evident. the cells were incubated 6 d before analysis of annexin protein by Western. supernatants were assayed for HIV-1 p24 10 d after infection (n = 5) macrophages treated with siRNA as indicated in C were analyzed for annexin II, CD4 and CCR5 protein by Western blot. antibodies to annexin II were not effective in blocking the virus. annexin II appears to play no role in infection of cells with either Ebola virus or with SARS coronavirus. annexin II appears to contribute to the pathway by which HIV-1 infects human macrophages. nonadherent virus was removed, macrophages were cultured, and day 10 supernatants were assayed for p24 levels. cells were immediately washed and lysed, and bound p24 was assayed by ELISA. annexin II is Associated with Entry/Fusion of HIV-1 in Macrophages. anti\u2013annexin II was incorporated into a fusion assay in which effector cells expressing recombinant Env were cocultured with target cells expressing recombinant CD4 and coreceptors (23). in the absence of PS, anti\u2013annexin II was ineffective in interrupting this fusion process (not depicted), ruling out a specific interaction with Env, CD4 and/or coreceptors. this data emphasize the potential unique constraints of macrophag annexin II blockade inhibits infectivity after binding, but pre-reverse transcription, consistent with a stranglehold on the viral entry/fusion step. annexin II appears to be significant in mediating its anti\u2013HIV-1 activity. annexin II reportedly is found in caveolae and lipid rafts in association with cholesterol (27) and mediates interactions between cholesterol-rich membrane domains and the actin cytoskeleton (28, 29) annexin II may represent a molecular pathway exploited by HIV-1 unique to macrophage hosts and thus, a potential target to block their virus susceptibility. annexin II is a membrane-associated protein known as a docking station for tissue plasminogen activator/plasminogen (16) it is unclear if it transduces a signal because it lacks a hydrophobic signal sequence, but conceivably, may serve as an adaptor in a signaling cascade. annexin II can be phosphorylated at key residues by several kinases, including the src oncogene (17) and Py annexin II/PS may also contribute to the host cell-derived cloak of hypothetical Trojan exosomes that subversively deliver retroviral particles to nearby cells. annexin II/PS may also contribute to the host cell\u2013derived cloak of the hypothetical Trojan exosomes that subversively deliver retroviral particles to nearby cells. annexin II, a host cell molecule that the virus has appropriated for easing its entrance into the host cell, represents a likely candidate. annexin II, or other annexin II\u2013specific blockades, may represent a therapeutic impediment to the infection process. viral pathogens other than HIV-1 also take advantage of target cell annexin II to enhance their infectivity and/or dissemination."}
