{"summary": "we investigated the bactericidal and virucidal efficacy of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) 7.5% scalp and skin cleanser, chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) 4% hand cleanser and the reference hand wash (soft soap) in 15 healthy volunteers following European Standard EN1499. log10 RFs with CHG (0.90\u20131.34) were lower than for soft soap across all tests. Conclusion PVP-I 7.5% cleanser showed superior efficacy against MNV compared to soft soap. both PVP-I and CHG were superior to soft soap against E. coli."}
