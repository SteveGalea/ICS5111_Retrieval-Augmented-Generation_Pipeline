{"summary": "transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is a highly contagious infectious disease of pigs. it is caused by the TGE virus (TGEV) which infects the gastrointestinal tract. glucose is among the nutrients absorbed in the intestinal epithelium. a recent study suggested that EGFR may act as another receptor for TGEV. IPEC-J2 and HEK293T cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. the complete genome sequence for this virus is available at the GenBank database. the complete genome sequence for this virus is available at the GenBank database. TGEV release was assessed by measuring levels of viral nucleoprotein (N) gene expression via quantitative RT-PCR using a TaKaRa SYBR Green qPCR Kit (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) the primer sequences were as follows: N-F (sense), 5'-CAATTCCCGTGGTC GGAAGA-3', N-R (antisense), 5'-TTTACGTTGGCCCTACCA-3' PCR products proteins in the supernatant (15\u201350 g protein) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on 10\u201312% gradient gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. membranes were blocked for 2 h in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. the best silencing efficiencies were observed with clones NM_214007 (porcine EGFR) and NM-001012297.1 (porcine SGLT1) the shRNA for EGFR, three shRNAs for SGLT1 and overexpression plasmid for EGFR were designated as shEGFR, shSGLT1-1, shSGLT1-2, shSGLT1-3, and pLVX-EGFR. cells were gently washed twice with uptake buffer at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. cells were incubated in uptake buffer containing 2-DG at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. IPEC-J2 cells were resuspended in PBS (0.1% BSA) at 2 106 cells/mL. cells were washed and resuspended in culture medium for 15 min to stabilize CFSE staining. CFSE-labeled cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. RPMI and Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with HEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. cDNA was generated by reverse transcription using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) PCR products were purified using a Gel Extraction Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Inc., Norcross, GA, USA) and cloned into the pJET1.2 vector. the initial copy number of the TGEV N gene was calculated using a formula: X0 = -K log Ct + b. anti-p-EGFR antibody (D7A5; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), anti-SGLT1 (ab14686; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-GLUT2 (sc-7580; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA), anti-tubulin (E12-043; Enogene Biotech, New York, NY, USA) HEK293T cells were transfected with 1 g of specific expression plasmid per 106 cells using the X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent. phlorizin was the inhibitor of EGFR and SGLT1 from NCBI. cells were washed three times with ice-cold uptake buffer and dissolved in 1 mL of 0.1% SDS. the level of intracellular 2-DG uptake was determined by measuring the radioactivity of a 900-L aliquot of each sample using a liquid scintillation counter (LS 6500; Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA, USA) RAW264.7 cells were plated at a density of 1 104 cells/well in 96-well plates in 100 mL Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium. twenty microliters of cell counting kit-8 reagent was then added to each microwell, and plates were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. whole-cell extracts were prepared from mock-infected (control) and TGEV-infected (TGEV) IPEC-J2 cells at (D) 24, (E) 48, and (F) 60 hpi. protein expression levels of SGLT1, GLUT2, -tubulin, and TGEV N protein were determined by western blot analysis. CCCP is known to reduce cell viability and proliferation. TGEV infection had no significant effect on proliferation and viability of IPEC-J2 cells. TGEV infection increases EGFR protein expression. EGFR regulates glucose uptake via interaction with SGLT1 in mock-infected cells. we choose AG1478 as EGFR inhibition because it can inhibit the EGFR tyrosine kinase activity and total EGFR [16, 17] culture medium from each group and from mock-infected cells was assayed. expression levels of p-EGFR, EGFR, SGLT1, GLUT2 and -tubulin proteins were evaluated. each experiment was performed separately three times. transfection with shEGFR and pLVX-EGFR resulted in decreased and increased SGLT1 protein expression. in contrast, GLUT2 protein expression was unaffected by either treatment. EGFR and p-EGFR regulate glucose uptake in mock-infected IPEC-J2 cells by modulation of SGLT1 protein expression. TGEV infection-activated EGFR results in increased glucose uptake. western blot analysis of p-EGFR, EGFR, SGLT1, GLUT2 and -tubul showed that EGFR mediates glucose uptake in TGEV-infected cells. protein expression of p-EGFR, EGFR, SGLT1, GLUT2 and -tubulin was determined. each experiment was performed separately three times. TGEV replication are affected by intracellular glucose concentrations. flow cytometric analysis of CFSE-labeled cells was performed in the presence of 0.1, 1, 10, and 25 mM glucose. TGEV infection triggered a significant increase in glucose uptake in IPEC-J2 cells at 48 and 60. TGEV infection promotes glucose uptake in IPEC-J2 cells. total RNA expression levels were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. total RNA was isolated at 24, 48 and 60 hours post-infection. Fig 1B\u20131F shows the mRNA and protein levels of SGLT1 and GLUT2. differences were considered significant at (*) 0.01 p 0.05 or (**) p 0.01. blot analysis was performed to determine levels of EGFR (A) and p-EGFR (B) in mock-infected cells. EGFR regulates glucose uptake via interaction with SGLT1 in mock-infected cells. EGFR influences glucose uptake levels in mock-infected IPEC-J2 cells. expression levels of p-EGFR, EGFR, SGLT1, GLUT2 and -tubulin were quantified. western blot analysis of the expression levels of SGLT1, EGFR, and -tubulin. each experiment was performed separately three times. pLVX-EGFR transfection resulted in significantly increased EGFR and p-EGFR protein expression and glucose uptake. western blot analysis showed that IPEC-J2 cells treated with phlorizin showed downregulation of SGLT1 expression without inducing cell death. in conclusion, inhibition of SGLT1 by shRNA or phlorizin treatment disrupted EGFR expression. notably, these treatments also resulted in decreased glucose uptake. transfection with pLVX-EGFR resulted in increased SGLT1 and GLUT2 protein expression. EGFR influences glucose uptake in TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells. TGEV contains a 27.6\u201331.3-kb single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. the virion RNA functions as an mRNA and is infectious. western blot analysis showed that TGEV N protein was more abundant when TGEV-infected cells absorbed more glucose. total RNA was extracted from culture medium supernatants. RT-PCR analysis of cells cultured in medium containing 0.1, 1, 10, or 25 mM glucose. all CCK-8 assays were performed using six parallel samples. increased glucose absorption stimulated TGEV replication in vitro. this suggests that glucose may be transformed into glutamine in infected cells. SGLT1 and GLUT2 have been shown to mediate intestinal glucose uptake. TGEV infection significantly increased glucose uptake at 48 h, indicating accelerated glucose absorption. TGEV infection may promote glucose trafficking through GLUT2. previous studies have shown that glucose transport plays an important role in viral invasion. EGFR and p-EGFR promote glucose uptake in IPEC-J2 cells during TGEV infection. previous studies have shown that EGFR is a target receptor for viruses and bacteria, including TGEV and Escherichia coli."}
