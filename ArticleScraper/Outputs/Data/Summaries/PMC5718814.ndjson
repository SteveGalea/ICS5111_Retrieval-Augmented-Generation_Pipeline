{"summary": "nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) vaccines have characteristics that meet these challenges, including ease of production, scalability, consistency between lots, and safety. modern DNA vaccine design generally relies on synthesis of the nucleic acid and possibly one-step cloning into the plasmid vector, reducing both the cost and the time to manufacture. gene sequences are inserted into a plasmid backbone and then delivered to the host via one of several delivery methods. the cell provides endogenous post-translational modifications to antigens, producing native protein conformations. improved delivery technologies have been used to facilitate transport of DNA into cells. electroporation-enhanced DNA vaccination resulted in increased polyfunctional antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in patients receiving a HPV DNA vaccine expressing the genes of HPV16 and HPV18 respectively. liposomes are spherical vesicles composed of phospholipids and cholesterol arranged into a lipid bilayer. this facilitates delivery of the DNA vaccine plasmid into the cells. liposomes are spherical vesicles composed of phospholipids and cholesterol. this facilitates delivery of the DNA vaccine plasmid into the cells. liposome encapsulated influenza A virus M1 induced humoral and cellular immune responses that protected against respiratory infection. liposomes have also been shown to be an effective delivery method for intranasal DNA vaccination, conferring protective immune responses against infection. the use of liposomes or nanoparticles appears to be safe and well tolerated in clinical studies. microparticle-based delivery systems can increase gene expression, as well as, DNA vaccine immunogenicity. more recent studies highlighted herein yielded promising clinical data. a more comprehensive list of molecular adjuvants is included in Table 1. Molecular adjuvants tested in vivo. the most extensively studied molecular adjuvant is interle. IL-2 plays an essential role in the immune response by promoting the differentiation of nave T cells into effector T cells. it is also required for the proliferation of natural Killer (NK) cells. a therapeutic vaccine encoding for the BCR/ABL-pIRES genes of myeloid leukemia and IL-2 also demonstrated enhanced immune responses. hesus macaques vaccinated with IL-15 exhibited increased T cell proliferation compared with those receiving the antigen plasmid alone. IL-12 is another pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted by both dendritic cells and monocytes. inclusion of IL-12 expression plasmids can improve weakly immunogenic vaccines. the final immunomodulatory cytokine that has received considerable focus as a molecular adjuvant is granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor. GM-CSF recruits antigen presenting cells to the vaccination site and promotes DC maturation. high levels of GM-CSF can expand myeloid suppressor cell populations. lack of improved immunogenicity seen in clinical trials may be due to lack of GM-CSF receptors on rhesus and human APC. molecular adjuvant-encoding plasmids express protein for the same duration as the antigen, stimulating the immune system for a greater length of time. homologous recombination between plasmid-encoded cytokines and host gene sequence does not appear to be a significant concern. many current plasmids have been optimized to improve gene expression in mammalian cells. IL-15 is a cytokine that induces NK and T cell proliferation. it also plays a substantial role in establishment of memory CD8+ T cell populations. a synergistic effect was seen when IL-15 and IL-21 were co-delivered with a DNA vaccine against Toxoplasma gondii infection. 79-83 IL-12 signaling supports the secondary expansion of activated T helper 1 (Th1) cells,79,82,84-86 resulting in high levels of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. inclusion of IL-12 expression plasmids in the vaccine formulation enhances Th1 immune responses. a bicistronic DNA vaccine encoding GM-CSF recruited inflammatory cellular infiltrates and elicited a potent CD4+ T cell response. co-administration of GM-CSF plasmid with an antigen-encoding DNA vaccine can have deleterious effects. the increased understanding of immune signaling pathways has led to the development of adjuvant plasmids encoding adhesion molecules, chemokines, costimulatory molecules, and toll-like receptor ligands. these molecular adjuvants have had some success in small animal models. similar results were seen in studies encoding the dsRNA receptors MDA5 and RIG-I. chromosomal plasmid DNA has been identified following intramuscular injection. many current plasmids have been-codon optimized to improve gene expression in mammalian cells. this has resulted in changes to the cytokine gene sequence. immunostimulatory RNA expressed from the vector backbone may be used to activate alternative RNA sensing innate immune receptors. addition of optimized immunostimulatory motifs in the vector backbone may be used to increase TLR9 activation. some bacterial region protein marker genes have been shown to dramatically reduce vector expression. region mediated repression of transgene expression can be alleviated by replacing the kanR gene with either a tRNA RNA selection marker, the RNA-OUT antisense RNA selection marker or the endogenous pUC origin RNAI antisense RNA selection marker. bacterial regions larger than 1 kbase silenced transgene expression in quiescent tissue such as the liver. large pUC bacterial replication origin is replaced by a small R6K bacterial replication origin. the 500 basepair (bp) bacterial region separates the polyA signal and the eukaryotic promoter. an alternative strategy is to encode immunostimulatory RNA within the plasmid to increase innate immune activation. this approach has the potential advantage that additional innate immune pathways not normally stimulated by DNA alone are activated. this approach has the potential advantage that additional innate immune pathways not normally stimulated by DNA are activated. a DNA vaccine vector that co-expresses with antigen a RIG-I dsRNA agonist in a vector backbone encoded RNA polymerase III transcription unit enhanced the humoral and CD8+ T cell response after DNA vaccination. innovations that increase transgene expression may be used to improve the performance of immunomodulatory molecular adjuvant plasmids, in addition to traditional antigen expressing DNA vaccine plasmids. new formulations exploiting sustained vaccine delivery methods are on the horizon. the strong appeal of needle-free injection and mucosal delivery suggests this approach is on the precipice of redefining the field of vaccinology."}
