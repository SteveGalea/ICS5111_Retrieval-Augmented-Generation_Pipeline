{"summary": "the Waldeyer lymphatic ring is formed by a conglomerate of lymphoid structures including the pharyngeal tonsils (adenoids) and palatine tonsils. it is strategically located at the entrance of the respiratory and digestive systems and is exposed to a wide variety of antigens present in air and food. there is no certainty about what determines the onset of chronic infection. aims to identify and determine the prevalence of major respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal secretions collected pre- and postoperatively and adenoid tissue of children undergoing adenoidectomy. a prospective observational study was performed in 36 patients under 12 years of age with upper airway lymphoid hypertrophy undergoing adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy. the swab was homogenized in microtubes containing sterile Ringer lactate solution. the adenoid tissue was obtained by cold adenoidectomy. small fragments of adenoid tissue were stored in microtubes. 108 pre- and postoperative nasopharyngeal specimens and adenoid tissue samples were removed surgically from these 36 patients. at least 1 viral agent was isolated in any of the samples collected in 58.3% of 36 children (n = 21) of the 21 patients with positive results for any respiratory virus, 6 (28.6%) were isolated in children under 7 years of age. in only 13.9% of samples (n = 5) was a respiratory virus isolated. coinfection in 60% (n = 3) and single virus infection in 40% (n = 2; Table 1). bocavirus (n = 7), present in 19% of 36 samples. nasopharyngeal secretions collected after surgery, only 8 respiratory viruses were identified. the main agent isolated was rhinovirus (27.8%), followed by bocavirus (22.2%). other viruses isolated with a lower frequency were adenovirus (11.1%), enterovirus (8.3%), parechovirus (8.3%), coronavirus HKU (5.6%), parainfluenza virus 4 (5.6%), influenza A (2.8%), coronavirus 43 (2.8%) 58.4% of patients (n = 21) and 25.9% of samples (n = 28) were positive for at least 1 respiratory virus. at least 1 respiratory virus was identified in 97% of 52 samples. the authors identified 84 samples (72.4%) positive for adenovirus. 28.6% (n = 6) of patients with positive results presented coinfection with 2 viral agents, and 2 patients had viral coinfection in 2 samples. bocavirus was isolated in 75% (n = 6) of the coinfections. in only 13.9% of patients (n = 5) was at least 1 viral agent isolated in the sample. in the postoperative secretions, 8 respiratory viruses were detected, and adenoviruses were identified in 2 patients. this suggests a decrease in the prevalence of the virus after surgery. the rhinovirus was the most frequently found virus in all samples. after removal of adenoid tissue, there was a decrease in the prevalence of viruses in nasopharyngeal secretions."}
