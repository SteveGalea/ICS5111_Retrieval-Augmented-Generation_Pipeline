{"summary": "rheumatic fever (RF) is an autoimmune disease which may follow group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) pharyngitis [1,2]. Repeated RF episodes may cause rheumatic heart disease (RHD) public health surveillance is vital for supporting infectious disease prevention. surveillance activities can be broadly categorised into two types: control-focused and strategy-focused. control-focused surveillance aims to identify affected individuals to enable treatment. surveillance sector review framework contains seven stages, described in Figure 1. it covers all stages of the disease pathway (Figure 2). thirty-six people indicated they would like to participate and were interviewed. interviews were recorded on a Dictaphone. KIs were asked what RF surveillance information they and their agencies required. the proportion who responded in the same way was recorded in a semi-quantitative manner, using a scale with seven levels. all surveillance gaps identified were identified in each set of interview notes. interviews with key informants (KIs) considered to have experience and expertise in RF prevention, control or surveillance were a major information source. an initial list of potential KIs and important surveillance sector roles was first devised during meetings with senior MoH staff in the Communicable Diseases team. additional KIs were identified by reading RF reports and asking other KIs whether they knew of anyone else who should be interviewed. KIs were asked what RF surveillance information they and their agencies required. future requirements were discussed. ideas for closing gaps were discussed. a third show card outlining major categories of surveillance gaps. the researchers noted which major category each gap fell under, according to whether it concerned a surveillance system\u2019s leadership or resourcing, design or structure. more consideration was given to gaps that many KIs had identified as being high-priority problems. primary healthcare providers and clinicians expressed a need for information on RF and GAS pharyngitis rates in their localities. strategic information users needed information on national and regional disease rates and intervention strategies so they could rapidly assess and compare progress. around half of all patients hospitalised for RHD had not been previously hospitalised with RF. a lack of information on GAS pharyngitis and carriage rates was a common concern. a lack of information on the significance of GAS pharyngitis in areas considered high risk for RF was a common concern. a lack of control sites to compare intervention areas with was commonly identified as a gap limiting the ability to monitor the effect of throat swabbing programs. the effectiveness of secondary prophylaxis programs is not monitored. the effectiveness of secondary prophylaxis programs is not monitored. most KIs with local-level roles felt gaining access to RF surveillance information is, \"Complicated and ineffective\" support for a national register was overwhelming, on the grounds that it would improve the ability to treat patients. primary healthcare providers, surveillance system operators and strategic information users were included. the RF surveillance sector has a strong emphasis on control-focussed surveillance. notification and register data were the most commonly identified control-focussed surveillance systems. an absence of systems to monitor general practitioner\u2019s delivery of secondary prophylaxis was considered a gap. the key strategy-focused surveillance gap was the inability to generate consistent national and regional case totals. a common theme was that the Ministry of Health needs to decide on one surveillance platform. most thought protocols should be clarified and standardised. a lack of control sites to compare intervention areas with was commonly identified as a gap. the effectiveness of secondary prophylaxis programs is not monitored. most KIs felt gaining access to RF surveillance information is \"Complicated and ineffective\" a national register was overwhelming, on the grounds that it would improve the ability to treat patients. rheumatic fever surveillance improvements identified by the surveillance sector review High priority recommendations Medium priority recommendations. Establish systematic surveillance for GAS pharyngitis to characterise the epidemiology and microbiology of this condition. there is a clear need for a well-run online national RF register. this tool has potential to close many of the surveillance gaps we noted. the RF notification dataset is effectively operating as a national register already. surveillance sector review identified a 'grey' boundary between surveillance and research. some end-users with policy roles had a great need for strategy-focused information that might be better met by specific research studies. surveillance sector review approach could be equally effective in resource poor countries where disease such as RF have a particularly high health burden. there is a clear need for a well-run online national RF register. this tool has potential to close many of the surveillance gaps we noted. the RF notification dataset is effectively operating as a national register. surveillance sector review identified a 'grey' boundary between surveillance and research. some end-users with policy roles had a great need for strategy-focused information. surveillance sector review approach could be equally effective in resource poor countries where disease such as RF have a particularly high health burden. JO collected and analysed the data. MB and NP critically reviewed successive versions of the draft. all authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
