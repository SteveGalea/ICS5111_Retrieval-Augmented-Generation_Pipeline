{"summary": "in the uk, the NHS Direct telephone service was used by many of these patients. we used qualitative interviews to identify the main reasons why people approached NHS Direct with concerns about swine flu. all patients had telephoned NHS Direct between 11 and 14 May with concerns about swine flu. in the first month of the swine flu outbreak, only 185 cases of swine flu were confirmed across the uk. a common assumption is that this group consists of worried patients who require reassurance. a common assumption is that this group consists of worried patients who require reassurance. some people who spoke to NHS Direct or the health protection agency by telephone reported that this contact added to their confusion or made them suspicious as to why they had been asked to contact these services at all [14]. this study used qualitative interviews with patients who contacted NHS Direct about swine flu during the early stages of the outbreak to assess whether the advice and reassurance given to them adequately met their needs. participants were asked to verbally confirm their consent to take part in the interviews. they were informed that all data would be anonymised by the removal of any personally identifiable material from our transcripts and publications. participants were then guided through a semi-structured interview lasting 10 to 15 minutes. participants were eligible for this study if they had contacted NHS Direct between 11 and 14 may 2009 to discuss swine flu. they were 18 years or older, spoke English and had received only information or treatment at home advice. our intention was to interview 30 to 40 patients who met these criteria. two researchers re-examined each transcript and identified how many participants explicitly mentioned each sub-theme to ensure that they reflected general experiences among our participants. 45% reported that when they had called NHS Direct they were 'not at all' worried about swine flu. two participants were asymptomatic when they initially sought information about swine flu. the main motivating factor for seeking advice was a desire to discuss prophylaxis. some participants said they wanted information about any distinguishing characteristics of swine flu. swine flu is not a flu virus, but it's not a flu virus. swine flu is not a flu virus, but it's not a flu virus. swine flu is not a flu virus, but it's a risk factor. a lack of trust in the initial source was important for some participants. some participants were informed that NHS Direct was the most appropriate place to get help. others commented that using a telephone service would reduce their chances of giving swine flu. the likelihood that I had caught swine flu was probably extremely small. for some, confusion still existed about their potential for having been exposed. some participants reported seeking additional advice about swine flu. 45% of participants reported that when they had called NHS Direct they were 'not at all' worried about swine flu. eight were'somewhat' worried, seven were'moderately' worried and three were worried'very much. the main motivating factor was a desire to discuss prophylaxis. some participants sought advice due to concerns they might expose others. for some, pressure came from friends or family and was not always well-received. others sought \"peace of mind,\" \"confirmation,\" or \"reassurance\" that they did not have swine flu. a lack of trust in the initial source was important for some participants. a lack of trust in the initial source was important for some participants. a lack of trust in the source was important for some participants. reassured patients that they were only at risk of catching swine flu if they had been in close contact with a known case. confusion still existed about their potential for having been exposed. for others, confusion still existed about their potential for having been exposed. participants were able to identify any aspect of their call that had caused them concern or worry. the employer of this participant had asked her to re-check the cause of her symptoms. the early stages of the swine flu outbreak was no exception. perceptions about an emerging infectious disease are a strong predictor of intentions to seek medical advice during a hypothetical outbreak of that disease [23]. external pressure from friends, family members and employers was another key reason cited by patients for contacting NHS Direct. understanding motivations for health care use is a useful first step in providing unexposed yet concerned patients with appropriate care. the most pragmatic way to obtain sufficient participants for our analysis was to ask call centre staff to recruit up to five participants each. it is not clear how many participants were asked to participate in the study, but declined. however, the themes we identified reflect the key variables that were important in causing people to seek advice from NHS Direct and to find their contact reassuring or useful. the most pragmatic way to obtain sufficient participants for our analysis was to ask call centre staff to recruit up to five participants
