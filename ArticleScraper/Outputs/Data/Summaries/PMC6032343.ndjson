{"summary": "more than 8000 phenolic compounds have been found from natural sources. they are classified into phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes, coumarins, lignins, and tannins. they play a crucial role in plants by controlling their growth as an internal physiological regulator. the differentiation is in the substitution and functional groups, namely hydroxyl and methoxy groups, which decide the individual differences of each phenolic acid. the ingested phenolic acids are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and then circulate in the blood system after methylation, sulfation, and glucuronidation in the liver. this conjugation process increases the hydrophilicity of the phenolic compounds and helps remove them via the biliary or the urinary route coumarins are referred to as benzopyrones with a C6\u2013C3 skeleton and an oxygen heterocycle in the C3 unit. coumarins are present as the metabolites of microorganisms such as Streptomyces and Aspergillus species, namely novobiocin and coumermycin. coumarin is also used as an anticoagulant for the treatment of thrombotic phlebitis and pulmonary embolism. lignins are the polymers of monolignols such as p-coumaric acid and sinapic acid. phenolic compounds may occur in the polymeric type in plants. phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydrolxylase, p-coumarate-3-hydroxylase, and o-methyl transferase are involved in the biosynthesis of phenolics. phenylalanine, which is synthesized via the shikimate pathway, and to a lesser extent tyrosine, are the primary precursors for the biosynthesis of different classes of phenolics flavonoids\u2019 biosynthesis starts with a combination of three molecules of malonyl coenzyme A (CoA) and p-coumaroyl CoA, leading to the formation of naringenin chalcone with the aid of chalcone synthase. flavonone is converted into different classes of individual flavonoids such as flavone, flavonol, flavononol, flavanone, isoflavone, and antho the phenolics synthesized are transferred to the vacuole, in which they co-exist with other organic acids. 80% of phenolics are localized in the vacuole. phenolics are referred to as insoluble-bound phenolics because they are not isolated by the commonly used extraction media due to the covalent bonds to the insoluble macromolecules. more than 8000 phenolics have been found from natural sources. they are classified into phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes, coumarins, lignins, and tannins. phenolics from blueberries suppress the growth of cancer cell lines. hydroxycinnamic acids include p-coumaric, caffeic, ferulic and sinapic acids. hydroxybenzoic acids include p-hydroxybenzoic, protocatechuic, vanillic, syringic and gallic acids. flavonoids, another class of phenolics, constitute different sub-classes of compounds. Stilbenes, also known as 1,2-diphenylethene, possess a C6\u2013C2\u2013C6 carbon skeleton and show potent bioactivities such as antibacterial effects. Stilbenes are also known as an active inhibitor of topoisomerase II, which causes unwinding of coiled DNA during cellular transcription. coumarins are present as the metabolites of microorganisms such as Streptomyces and Aspergillus species. biosynthesis pathway of phenolic acids and stilbene from phenylalanine. coumarin possesses anti-coagulant activity, which inhibits blood coagulation. biosynthesis of phenolics takes place at the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in plant cells. phenylalanine and tyrosine are precursors for the biosynthesis of different classes of phenolics. phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes, coumarins, lignins, and tannins are also involved. p-coumarate-3-hydroxylase generates caffeic acid from p-coumaric acid. two enzymes, hydroxylase and o-methyl transferase, are involved in the substitution of a methoxy group for the biosynthesis of sinapic acid. benzoic acid is formed by losing two carbon atoms from phenylpropanoids. phenolics synthesized in the ER transfer to other organs via membrane transporter proteins and vesicles. the phenolics secreted from the ER after biosynthesis move to the target organs and enter them through ABC (adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) binding cassette) phenolics also transfer to other organs through the vesicles. the small intestine absorbs only a small portion of free phenolics in the food matrices and only 5\u201310% of them are incorporated into the plasma. the remaining 90\u201395% are directly transferred to the colon. the phenolics reaching the large intestine undergo fermentation by the versatile colon microbiota. phenolics stimulate the expression of tumor-suppressing proteins such as p53, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), p21, and p27. ferulic acid has shown significant anticancer activity in many studies by attenuating the growth of different types of cancer cells. p-coumaric acid suppressed penetration, migration, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lung cancer cells. flavonoids such as troxerutin, apigenin, kaempferol, and myricetin have proven their excellent anticarcinogenic capacity. phytochemicals from plant-derived formulations have been extensively used to treat inflammation and related disorders from the ancient time. inhibition of overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines is vital in order to prevent related ailments. the potent anti-inflammatory activity of p-coumaric acid was found by lowering the expression of inflammatory mediator TNF-. the treatment of those phenolic acids decreased the expression of inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, IL-1-, tumor necrosis factor (TNF). all compounds listed above suppressed iNOS protein by inhibiting nuclear factor-B (NF-B), which is a main transcription factor for iNOS. phenolics have also been shown to be potent antibacterial and anti-viral agents. phenolics such as stilbenes, tannins, and isoflavones inhibited the growth of fungi, yeasts, and viruses. ferulic acid reduces the incidence of type 2-diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative diseases of the rat. kaempferol is a potent neuroprotection agent by attenuating caspases cleavage and apoptotic nuclei, followed by guarding SH-SY5Y cells and important neurons from rotenone toxicity [53] kaempferol is a potent neuroprotection agent by attenuating caspases cleavage and apoptotic nuclei, followed by guarding SH-SY5Y cells theaflavin\u2013digallate and theaflavin\u2013gallate prevented Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus by inhibiting the chymotrypsin activity that plays a significant role in viral multiplication. anthocyanidins showed strong potential for reducing obesity, inhibiting dysfunction of fat cells, and attenuating fat accumulation in adipose cells. ferulic acid shows anticancer effect by influencing cell cycle, invasion, and apoptotic behavior of MIA PaCa-2. ferulic acid inhibits homologous recombination (HR) repair of DNA and RAD 51 (eukaryotic gene) formation in breast cancer cells. flavonoids such as troxerutin, apigenin, kaempferol, and myricetin have proven their excellent anticarcinogenic capacity. apigenin showed a radiosensitizing effect in human tumor cells. apoptosis-inducing potential of kaempferol may be due to alteration in apoptotic markers including caspase-3 (caspase-dependent) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF, caspase-independent) anti-inflammatory activity Inflammation is an essential biological response to tissue damage. the immune system responds to stimuli such as infection, injury, or irritation. inhibition of overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines is vital in order to prevent related ailments. da Cunha et al.
