{"summary": "72% of emerging zoonotic disease events originate from wildlife. trade that brings wildlife into close proximity with humans and domestic animals provides an interface for pathogen transmission. the 2003 SARS outbreak may have been facilitated by wildlife markets in china, as animal traders were found to have higher levels of exposure to SARS-coronavirus than control populations. the high volume of wildlife and diversity of species traded in lao PDR markets has been documented [11\u201314] but no studies have evaluated the human health risk posed by such trade. we assessed Factor 1 \u2013potential for wildlife and human contact (based on observed volume of wildlife in markets), Factor 2 \u2013potential for traded wildlife to carry a zoonotic pathogen. market surveys were conducted at 44 markets from february to April 2012. Detailed market surveys were conducted over a minimum of two days. to assess Factor 1, the potential for wildlife and human contact was recorded during the basic market surveys. the number of whole carcasses of wildlife species or estimated weight of body parts being sold was recorded during the basic market surveys. a carcass was recorded as fresh if no early signs of decomposition were observed and had no evidence of freezing. taxonomic family, order or class was recorded and a photo was taken to aid identification later. mammalian taxonomic families were analysed for their ability to host zoonotic pathogens that can cause significant human illness or death (hereafter termed \u2018significant zoonoses\u2019) practices of good hygiene during butchery were defined as cleaning of instruments and butcher\u2019s table after each animal. data were collected during the detailed markets survey on whether the market was located in a city, town or village. local visitors were defined as having license plates from within province, regional as license plates from outside the province and foreign as license plates from outside the province. 97.7% of fresh dead mammals were sold whole, 2.3% cut into pieces. average daily counts of alive or fresh dead animals in these markets ranged from 22 to 931 wild animals per day. the volume of wildlife for sale varied greatly between surveys at these seven markets. order was observed Family % of individuals by family Common name of most frequently observed species Passeriformes 2,714 109 7 14 Hirundinidae 85 martin species Pycnonotidae1 14 bulbul species Rodentia 1,698 625 7 20 Sciuridae2 83 tree squirrels and flying squirrel species Muridae3 12 rat species Spalacidae4 4 bamboo rat species Squamata 1,508 800 5 11 Aga taxonomic families listed make up 98% or more of each order. non-mammalian orders seen in very small volumes (less than 10 individual animals) are excluded. five mammalian families seen in large volumes (greater than 100 individuals or kg per family) capable of hosting a high number (7 to 26) of significant zoonoses: Sciuridae, Pteropodidae, Muridae, Cervidae and Viverridae. a potential wildlife host was identified in lao. diseases considered as significant zoonoses are based on total live and fresh dead mass (A) and individual animal count (kg) observed for seven markets over 21 visits on a log scale are shown. only families capable of hosting one or more zoonosis are represented. the presence of wildlife butchering was only observed in four of the seven markets. the risk of contaminated fomites was increased, as only four of the seven markets had running water. chering presenta Location of market in town (T), on major road (R) or neither (N) Local (L), other regions in lao PDR (R), foreign (F) license plates Mean SD Mean SD A 931 1190 436 469 NA N NA N Y N L B 135 93 51 24 N N Y Y,N,N,N,N,N N L,R C 98 118 26 22 Y N Y N Y R L,R D there were 382 Category I animals, species classified as being currently rare or near extinct, and 6,070 Category II animals for which, if management is neglected, they will become extinct. fresh dead wildlife was consistently more expensive than fresh dead domestic pork. the average price recorded for pork in early 2012 was 34,000 Kip/kg (SD 28,000) the average daily counts of alive or fresh dead animals in these markets ranged from 22 to 931 wild animals per day. of the fresh dead mammals, 97.7% were sold whole, 2.3% cut into pieces. the average daily counts of alive or fresh dead animals ranged from 22 to 931 wild animals per day. in the seven high volume markets, a range of 1\u201323 genera/day (mean 9 genera) were observed. most to least commonly observed mammalian orders (by individual animals) were Rodentia, Chiroptera, Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Lagomorpha, Scandentia, Primates and Dermoptera. leopard cat Lagomorpha 24 55 2 4 Leporidae16 100 burmese hare Psittaciformes 19 1 2 2 Psittaculidae17 100 parakeet species Anseriformes 16 10 2 2 Anatidae18 100 duck species Columbiformes 15 3 5 7 Columbidae19 100 dove and pigeon species Scandentia 15 3 5 7 Tupaiidae20 the 12 wildlife families were Muridae (rat species;

[44] who detected retroviruses (simian foamy virus) and herpesviruses (cytomegalovirus and lymphocryptovirus) in non-human primate samples being imported into the us. trade has led to significant declines of wildlife populations and endemic biodiversity in lao PDR. trade of artiodactyla (muntjac, sambar, mouse deer) threatens survival of iconic species like the tiger. the average GNI per capita in lao PDR is US$1,460 [48] the average daily counts of wildlife in markets in lao PDR ranged from 22 to 931 wild animals per day. the average daily counts of alive or fresh dead animals in the seven high volume markets ranged from 22 to 931 wild animals per day. the average daily counts of alive or fresh dead animals in the seven high volume markets ranged from 22 to 931 wild animals per day. this is similar to those found in the two most prolific wildlife market towns in Equatorial Guinea. trade of mammals (21 genera from 12 families) that are capable of hosting 36 significant zoonoses has the potential to pose significant public health risk. the trade of mammals (21 genera from 12 families) that are capable of hosting 36 significant zoonoses has the potential to pose significant public health risk. high prevalence of fruit bats recorded in trade in lao PDR was similar to our findings in markets in lao PDR. study highlighted the risk such trade could pose for zoonoses, such as henipaviruses, lyssaviruses and Ebola virus. in all seven high volume markets, poor biosafety enhanced the opportunities for pathogen transmission from infected wildlife to humans. lack of hand washing and cleaning of tables and generally poor market cleanliness, combined with the practice of selling wildlife alongside other fresh produce, presents risks for food contamination. the trade of artiodactyla (muntjac, sambar, mouse deer) threatens the survival of iconic species like the tiger. the average GNI per capita in lao PDR is US$1,460 [48], equating to a daily income of US$4. volume, scale and diversity of wildlife moving through markets in lao PDR also represent a serious threat to wildlife conservation. markets have and will likely continue to play a role in disease emergence if wildlife trade is not controlled and market management practices are not improved. paulin et al. and Levison et al. [23] are marked with a P. if a pathogen had previously been found in a different genus from the one we observed being traded, the genera was recorded as a potential host [24]."}
