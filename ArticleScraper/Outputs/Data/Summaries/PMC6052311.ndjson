{"summary": "interferon-stimulated gene 15 encodes a ubiquitin-like protein that is covalently conjugated to lysine residues of a substrate protein. ligases for ISGylation in human cells include the HERC domain- and RCC1-like domain-containing protein 5 (Herc5), estrogen-responsive finger protein (EFP) and a human homolog of the Drosophila ariadne gene product (HHARI) studies on the antiviral mechanisms of ISG15 have demonstrated that ISGylation regulates various steps of the virus life cycle. ISGylation of the influenza A virus (IAV) NS1 protein inhibits its binding to importin-, blocking NS1 nuclear import (17), while ISGylation of the influenza B virus (IBV) NP protein inhibits its oligomerization, inhibiting the formation of the viral ribonucleoprotein complex (18). RNA (miRNA) functions (22) and the formation of autophagic clusters. ISGylation affects the early steps of the virus life cycle. reactivation of virus in immunocompromised individuals can result in severe disease. HCMV expresses proteins that counteract IFN production and subsequent ISG activation. IE2 and pp65 inhibit IFN production (30\u201332), whereas IE1 directly interacts with STAT2 and PML to suppress the IFN response. stability and phosphorylation of STAT proteins are modulated during HCMV infection. pUL50-pUL53 heterodimers assemble to form hexameric ring-like structures. pUL50 acts as a scaffold for binding of further NEC proteins (50) HCMV-encoded transmembrane protein pUL50 acts as a negative regulator of protein ISGylation. recombinant HCMV strain expresses pUL50 with a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag. the pUL50-HA protein expressed from the recombinant virus was localized normally at the nuclear rim. in HF cells infected with this UL50-HA virus, immunoprecipitation of pUL50 with anti-HA antibody coprecipitated UBE1L and ISG15, while immunoprecipit pUL50 protein in total cell lysate was also determined by immunoblotting. HF cells in 150-mm dishes were infected with recombinant HCMV. pUL50 inhibits ISGylation and causes proteasomal degradation of UBE1L. pUL50 expression effectively reduced UBE1L in a dose-dependent manner. pUL50 alone did not downregulate UbcH8 expression. pUL26, which inhibits ISGylation, did not reduce the level of UBE1L. 293T cells in six-well plates were cotransfected with a plasmid expressing HA-UBE1L (A and E), HA-Herc5 (B), Flag-UbcH8 (C), or Myc-ISG15AA (D) as for panel A. cells were left untreated or treated with MG132 (20 M) for 24 h. levels of -actin are shown as a loading control. control HF cells and cells expressing pUL50-HA were produced by use of retroviral vectors. the half-life of pUL50-HA became shorter in pUL50-HA-expressing cells than in control cells. pUL50 expression downregulates the expression of endogenous UBE1L in HF cells. control and pUL50-HA-expressing HF cells produced by retroviral vectors were left untreated or treated with IFN- (1,000 U/ml) for 48 h. the levels of UBE1L, pUL50-HA, and -actin were detected by immunoblotting. pUL50 requires the TM domain in its C-terminal region for ISGylation inhibition. both the TM and 1-358 mutants did not inhibit ISGylation or cause the loss of UBE1 and Herc5. both mutants failed to accumulate in the nuclear rim of HF cells as expected. pUL50 binds to UBE1L independent of its membrane targeting. plasmids encoding pUL50-HA (wild type or mutant) (1 g) and Myc-UBE1L (0.5 g) were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. the expression level of each protein in total cell lysate was also determined by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. MG132, UBE1L and pUL50 were colocalized largely in the nuclear periphery and within the nucleus. when cells were cotransfected with MG132, the proteins were only partly colocalized within the nucleus. pUL50 expression causes UBE1L degradation in a manner dependent on its membrane targeting through the TM domain. peptides from ubiquitin E3 ligases, such as RNF170, were found to be associated with the NEC. expression of RNF170 variant 1 (RNF170v1) and variant 3 (RNF170v3) promoted pUL50-mediated UBE1L degradation. expression of RNF170 proteins alone, without pUL50 coexpression, did not affect the UBE1L level. levels of -actin are shown as a loading control. cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing pUL50-HA (0.5 g) and RNF170v1-3Flag or RNF170v3-3Flag (2 g) twenty-four hours after transfection, cell lysates were prepared. st dye was used to stain cell nuclei. twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were mock infected (a) or infected with UL50-HA virus at an MOI of 3 (b) for 120 h. double-label IFA was performed as described for panel A. pUL50, encoded by HCMV UL50, is a potential UBE1L-binding protein. pUL50 interacted strongly with UBE1L and to a lesser extent with ISG15AA. a recombinant HCMV strain expresses pUL50 with a HA tag. 50-HA protein expressed from the recombinant virus was localized normally at the nuclear rim. immunoprecipitation of pUL50-HA with anti-HA antibody coprecipitated UBE1L and ISG15, while immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody did not. the results of these co-IP assays confirmed the specific interaction of pUL50 with UBE1L and ISG15. the expression level of each protein in total cell lysate was also determined by immunoblotting. pUL50 inhibits ISGylation and causes proteasomal degradation of UBE1L. pUL50 expression effectively reduced UBE1L in a dose-dependent manner. treatment of cells with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, largely restored the loss of UbcH8 expression. pUL26, which inhibits ISGylation, did not reduce level of UBE1L. cells were left untreated or treated with MG132 (20 M) for 24 h. levels of -actin are shown as a loading control. cells were cotransfected with plasmid expressing HA-UBE1L. the half-life of pUL50-HA was shorter than that of UBE1L. the reduction of pUL50-HA expression from 8 h after CHX treatment restored UBE1L levels. pUL50 expression downregulates the expression of endogenous UBE1L in HF cells. pUL50 requires the TM domain in its C-terminal region for ISGylation inhibition. pUL50 consists of the conserved N-terminal globular domain, including the pUL53-binding region, and a C-terminal region containing the transmembrane (TM) domain. 293T cells in six-well plates were cotransfected with plasmids encoding pUL50-HA (wild type or mutant) (1 g) and Myc-UBE1L (0.5 g), as indicated. forty-eight hours after transfection, immunoblotting was performed with anti-Myc or anti-HA antibody. HF cells in chamber slides were transfected with UL50 plasmids. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with anti-HA antibody. the activity of pUL50 in binding to and degrading UBE1L was further investigated by indirect immunofluorescence assay. the ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF170 is involved in pUL50-mediated UBE1L degradation. the ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF170 is involved in pUL50-mediated UBE1L degradation. pUL50 expression is dependent on its membrane targeting through the TM domain. expression of RNF170 proteins alone, without pUL50 coexpression, did not affect the UBE1L level. in co-IP assays, RNF170 proteins were found to interact with pUL50. in co-IP assays, RNF170 proteins were found to interact with pUL50. pUL50-HA proteins were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody. the expression level of each protein in total cell lysate was determined by immunoblotting. the amounts of pUL50-HA proteins coimmunoprecipitated relative to the input amounts of proteins were quantitated. we found that pUL50 effectively increased UBE1L ubiquitination by UL50. we found that RNF170 promoted the pUL50-mediated ubiquitination of UBE1L. results suggest that RNF170 is involved in pUL50-mediated ubiquitination. pUL50 expression in HCMV-permissive cells reduced the UBE1L level that was induced by IFN- treatment or UV-HCMV infection. studies on the mechanism underlying this pUL50 activity revealed that although the C-terminal TM domain is not essential for UBE1L binding, it is required for UBE1L degradation. pUL50 recruits UBE1L to the ER membrane. pUL50 was colocalized with UBE1L at the nuclear periphery. an ER-associated ubiquitin E3 ligase was found to bind to pUL50. this activity of pUL50 may also be related to the high level of pUL50-induced loss of Herc5, which is associated with polyribosomes. oform was expressed earlier than pUL50 in virus-infected cells. abundantly expressed viral proteins may often be subjected to ISGylation in virus-infected cells. pUL50 interacts with UBE1L and ISG15. ISGylation of endosomal proteins was recently shown to promote the fusion of multivesicular bodies with lysosomes or autophagosomes. pUL50 targets the ER, is associated with ER-resident E3 ligase. it is tempting to study a regulatory role for pUL50 in these vesicle-related events. HCMV (AD169 strain)-GFP UL50-HA (52) was grown in IE1-expressing HF cells. UV-inactivated viruses were produced by irradiating the virus stock with UV light three times at 0.72 J/cm2 using a model CL-1000 cross-linker. retroviral vectors expressing pUL50-HA (pMK85) were produced in pAD/CMV/V5-DEST (Invitrogen) by using Gateway technology. 293A cells were transfected with retroviral vectors and packaging plasmids pHIT60 and pHIT60.

FITC-conjugated anti-HA antibody was also used at a 1:100 dilution. cell lysates were diluted 10-fold with co-IP buffer and sonicated. cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. cell culture, transfection, and reagents were performed. HCMV (AD169 strain)-GFP UL50-HA (52) was grown in IE1-expressing HF cells. plasmids for myc-UBE1L (pMK86), Myc-UbcH8 (pMK92), Myc-Herc5 (pMK89) and SRT-UL50 (pMK55) were previously described. pcDNA3.1 derivative was provided by Cheol-Sang Hwang (Pohang University of science and technology) to create plasmids expressing C-terminally Flag-tagged RNF170 proteins. the plasmid expressing HA-ubiquitin (HA-Ub) was previously described (62). retroviral vectors were produced in pAD/CMV/V5-DEST (Invitrogen) by using Gateway technology. PCR was performed using the following primers: UBE1L forward, 5\u2032-AGGTGGCCAAGAACTTGGTT-3\u2032; UBE1L reverse, 5\u2032-CACCACCTGGAAGTCCAACA-3\u2032; -actin forward, 5\u2032-AGCGGGAAATCGTGCGTG-3\u2032; and -actin reverse, 5\u2032-CAGGGTGGTGCC-3\u2032. the relative DNA levels in agarose gel images were quantitated using ImageJ (NI e-buffered saline (PBS) and total cell lysates were prepared by boiling the cell pellets in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) loading buffer. equal amounts of the clarified cell extracts were separated in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. the blots were blocked with PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) containing 5% nonfat dry milk by primary antibodies (anti-HA at a 1:200 dilution; anti-Myc and anti-Flag at a 1:2,000 dilution) in PBS for 1 h at 37\u00b0C followed by incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies at a 1:100 dilution for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. mounting solution containing Hoechst dye and an antifade reagent (Molecular Probes) was used. 93T cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing target (Myc-UBE1L) or effector proteins and a plasmid expressing HA-Ub. cell pellets were resuspended with 2% SDS lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (Sigma) and boiled for 10 min."}
