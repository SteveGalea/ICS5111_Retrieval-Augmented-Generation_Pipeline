{"summary": "astroviruses have been found in numerous other mammalian and avian species. the best known clinical manifestation of astroviral infection in mammals is diarrhea. the domestic cat (Felis catus) is a relatively well-recognized host. astroviruses are difficult to isolate in culture; they often require trypsin concentrations toxic to host cells. they enhance epithelial permeability of the gut without inducing cell death. astroviruses are morphologically similar to a number of other viruses, including caliciviruses. mamastrovirus 2 in domestic cats will provide a more efficient and economical test option. it will provide quantitative information essential for further investigation of this virus. subsequent products underwent electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel. bands of interest at 150 bp and 450 bp were cut from the gel and extracted. RT-qPCR was used in lieu of a direct RT-qPCR. previously mentioned negative control extraction samples from RNA extractions were also converted to cDNA and subjected to qPCR. primer and probe sequences were created for the RT-qPCR assay. 20-L solution containing 1 L of forward primer, reverse primer, and probe. 4 L of sample (at 25 ng/L cDNA), 10 L of sample (at 25 ng/L cDNA) a third well of each sample was run with Eukaryotic 18S rRNA endogenous control (VIC/MGB probe, Life Technologies) in order to confirm the presence of cDNA. RT-qPCR amplifications were performed on 10 replicates of a single known-positive sample on a single reaction plate at a consistent concentration. results Sequence analysis confirmed the presence of mamastrovirus 2 within 29 of the 120 samples. the remaining 91 samples were negative for mamastrovirus 2. the range of threshold cycle values spanned from 16 cycles for 108 copies to 42 cycles for 10 copies. the reliable limit of detection was set at a concentration of 100 copies per well. the average viral load of RT-qPCR\u2013positive samples was much higher, at almost 400,000 copies. us 0 1 Total 91 5 86 Non-feline mammalian species Dolphin astrovirus 1 & 2 1 Tursiops truncatus 0 1 Minke whale astrovirus 1 & 3 1 T. truncatus 0 1 Minke whale astrovirus 2 1 B. acutorostrata 0 1 Squirrel astrovirus 2 Sciurus carolinensis 0 2 Total 6 0 6 RT-q ified copies were detected, with a standard error of 37,819 copies and a 95% CI of 85,553 copies. the sample used for repeatability analysis had a consistent copy quantification of approximately half its original detected quantity 2 y prior, consistent with degradation during storage. the RT-qPCR assay produced positive results for 5 of the 91 consensus RT-PCR\u2013negative samples. however, additional validation RT-PCR testing identified 4 of these samples to be true positives. if not for a conservative determination of analytic sensitivity threshold, the RT-qPCR assay would have achieved 100% diagnostic sensitivity. the RT-qPCR assay detects cDNA sequences specific to the virus, rather than actual virions. fecal samples commonly contain PCR inhibitors and nucleases, which may hinder amplification."}
