{"summary": "the world population has grown to 7.6 billion people in 2018, more than half of which live in densely populated urban settings. the number of people traveling by plane is growing each year and amounted to a total of 3.7 billion in 20161. this pandemic risk is further increased by the climate change that influences the distribution, abundance, and prevalence of pathogen-bearing vectors. Currently licensed seasonal influenza vaccines are specific for pre-defined viral strains. new vaccine technologies able to induce broad protection against influenza A viruses are urgently required. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first occurred in china in 2002. the 2013\u20132016 Ebola crisis represented the first epidemic caused by an Ebolavirus with 28,616 cases and 11,310 deaths reported. at late stages of the epidemic, several vaccine candidates were tested in clinical trials. the most advanced of which (rVSV-ZEBOV) showed clinical efficacy in a clinical trial (7). the list of multi drug resistant (MDR) organisms is ever-growing, favored by misuse and overuse of antibiotics. this holds true for the use of antibiotics in both humans and in animals. the solution to this growing threat could be the development of efficient vaccines to prevent MDR organisms from further spread. outbreak scenarios may limit conventional vaccine development in terms of producibility. the unpredictable nature of emerging pathogens represents one of the pivotal problems for pandemic preparedness. the risk of such events is highest for RNA viruses, whose high mutation rates favor adaptability. potential production capacity for pandemic influenza vaccines in 2015 could in theory support the vaccination of 43% of the population with two doses of vaccine. but the global distribution of vaccine production is far from equal between industrial nations and the developing world. most currently licensed vaccines would take 5\u20133 months between identification of a pandemic influenza and vaccine distribution. we will focus on the discussion of viral vector and nucleic acid based vaccines that have shown promise for offering solutions to the challenges of vaccine development. Figure 1 depicts an overview of the most important pandemics in relation to the start of clinical trials using different viral vector and nucleic acid based vaccines. for HIV, only select studies that represent major advances are shown. research conducted since the 1980s has established a variety of viruses as vaccine vectors by engineering them to encode for heterologous antigens. Upon delivery, antigens are expressed and the host is able to induce immune responses against the respective target pathogen (22). 57 identified human adenoviruses are classified into seven species A\u2013G. adenoviral receptors are expressed on the surface of most human cells. the vector is easily manipulated by insertion of a transgene cassette into the viral backbone via homologous recombination. the widespread pre-existing immunity to this virus in the human population hampers its clinical use. MV vaccine induces extremely durable responses with both antibodies and CD8+ cell persisting as long as 25 years post vaccination. adenoviral vectors of non-human origin have been developed. transgene cassettes can be inserted at different positions in the viral genome. MV vaccines can be grown in chick embryonic fibroblasts or cell lines such as vero or MRC-5 cells. MV vaccines can be grown in chick embryonic fibroblasts or cell lines. the resulting low risk of pre-existing immunity and lack of a DNA intermediate during viral replication makes VSV attractive as a safe vaccine for applications in humans. the establishment of a reverse genetic system for VSV in 1995 has allowed manipulation and propagation of the virus (39) the route of administration affects the quality of the induced immune response and the choice of application route thus depends on the target pathogen. the route of administration needs to be reliable and easy to perform in an outbreak situation, arguing for established routes of vaccination such as oral or intramuscular administration (47). the use of viral vector based vaccines raises safety concerns for use in humans, such as potential integration into the host genome or too high replication of attenuated vaccines. despite many advantages, several aspects have to be considered when developing a viral vector based vaccine. several examples for contaminants in viral vaccines have highlighted the reality of this risk. production of viral vector based vaccines is a highly complex and comparatively cost-intensive process. the effect of pre-existing immunity on vector immunogenicity has to be addressed. the first adenovirus based vaccine against Ebola, replication defective Ad5 expressing EBOV GP, was described in 2000 and tested in combination with DNA vector vaccination in non-human primates (NHPs) the first adenovirus based vaccine against Ebola, replication defective Ad5 expressing EBOV GP, was described in 2000 and tested in combination with DNA vector vaccination. a clinical trial (NCT00374309) was initiated in 2006. this study showed safety as well as the induction of antibody and T cell responses, but no significant generation of virus neutralizing titers. this finding might compromise the use of Ad5 for the development of human vaccines. study start N Vaccine and delivery Outcome NCT00374309 Phase I Sept 2006 31 Ad5 IM 2 109 or 2 1010 VP Antigen: GP EBOV and SUDV Safety: Acceptable safety profile Immunogenicity: - Antibody responses in 100% (SUDV GP) and 55% (EBOV GP) of subjects in the higher dose group.

DNA vaccines have successfully been employed for prime-boost regimen in combination with other vaccine technologies. the use of nucleic acid based vaccines offers advantages in different aspects of vaccine development and production. however, employing DNA as a basis for vaccination also implicates some disadvantages. a concern in this context is the long-term persistence of DNA plasmids upon injection. the WHO recommends monitoring the persistence of a cytokine expressing plasmid to ensure vaccine safety. no DNA based vaccine is licensed for human use as yet, but several DNA based vaccines have been licensed for veterinary applications, such as an equine vaccine against west Nile Virus. studies established protection induced by a trivalent DNA vaccine encoding for GP of two Ebolaviruses and a Marburgvirus (94) and protection from lethal challenge against an Ebolavirus upon DNA vaccination in combination with adenoviral vectors in non-human primates. first phase I clinical trial (NCT00072605) using a DNA vaccine against Ebola was started in 2003, well before the Ebola crisis in 2014 (95) a clinical trial was initiated in early 2015 (NCT02464670) the study assesses vaccine safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the components with and without an IL-12 encoding plasmid.

IM 4 mg in week 0, 4, 8 Antigen: HA of A/California/04/2009 Safety: Acceptable safety profile Immunogenicity: - HI titers 40 in 30% (6/20) of DNA vaccinated subjects. a large number of preclinical and clinical studies have assessed the ability of DNA vaccines to mediated protection against influenza viruses, either alone or as part of prime boost strategies. the vaccine targets the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza endemic in poultry. the virus is not able to spread efficiently and sustainably from human to human. the virus has caused the death of 453 people worldwide until 2017. clinical trials testing DNA vaccines in combination with the lipid-based adjuvant Vaxfectin\u00ae were initiated in 2007. a large number of doses could support the use of DNA-based vaccines for controlling a potential influenza pandemic by employing DNA as an initial priming agent, followed by boosting with conventional influenza vaccines upon availability. the first approach developed by Inovio employed a consensus prM-E derived from africa and more recent Asian and American strains modified to contain an IgE signal peptide with a putative glycosylation site removed. both vaccine candidates are evaluated in clinical studies by the Vaccine Research Center (VRC), national Institute of allergy and infectious diseases (NIAID) both vaccine candidates are evaluated in clinical studies by the Vaccine Research Center (VRC), national Institute of allergy and infectious diseases (NIAID) conventional non-replicating mRNA is obtained by in vitro transcription of a cDNA template, typically plasmid DNA (pDNA) produced in E. coli. the pDNA template is linearized using restriction enzymes and is transcribed into mRNA in a mixture containing recombinant phage DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (typically derived from T7 or T3 or Sp6 phage) self-amplifying mRNA vaccines are most commonly based on the alphavirus genome. the full length mRNA of the self-amplifying mRNA vaccines is substantially larger (9\u201310 kb for alphavirus systems) but contains the same essential elements such as a cap, 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs, and poly A tail (128) RDRP produces a negative-sense copy of the genome. this sub-genomic mRNA is transcribed at very high levels. this enables the amplification of mRNA encoding the antigen of choice. this allows the amplification of mRNA encoding the antigen of choice. recombination or co-packaging of replicon and helper RNAs VRPs could lead to the generation of infectious viruses. delivery of mRNA vaccines In order to act as a vaccine, exogenous mRNA has to enter the cytoplasm where protein expression can take place. the induction of an effective immune response requires stimulation of the innate immune system. CV7201, a candidate vaccine against rabies, was investigated as the first ever prophylactic mRNA-based vaccine in healthy human volunteers. subjects received 80\u2013640 g of the mRNA vaccine three times by conventional needle-based injection or needle-free injection devices. antibody responses waned one year after first vaccination but could be boosted to 05 IU/mL or higher in 57% of subjects using 80 g of mRNA delivered ID. mRNA (Micrus Bio LLC) or Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) are efficient transfection reagents for mRNA in cell lines and primary cells (110, 127) their use for in vivo mRNA delivery is limited due to high toxicity and low efficacy of transfection. lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the most promising and frequently used class of agents for in vivo delivery of mRNA vaccines. the route of mRNA administration has a crucial impact on the quality and strength of the induced immune response. the route of mRNA administration has been shown to effectively induce a balanced immune response including antibodies as well as Th1 type and cytotoxic T cells for mRNA vaccines. potent IM mRNA vaccines must allow high antigen expression and presentation. they must simultaneously induce strong immunostimulatory signals to recruit immune cells to injection site. single IM immunization of NHPs with LNP-formulated mRNAs encoding rabies or influenza antigens induced protective antibody titers. protamine-formulated non-replicating sequence optimized mRNA vaccines are taken up by non-leukocytic and leukocytic cells. mRNA was then transported to the draining lymph nodes (dLNs) by migratory dendritic cells. the encoded protein was expressed and efficiently presented by APCs within the dLNs as shown by T cell proliferation and immune cell activation. the innate immune activation was transient and resulted in priming of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells exclusively in the vaccine-draining LNs. mRNA-based vaccines induce type-I IFN-polarized innate immunity and lead to generation of potent vaccine-specific responses. non-replicating mRNA vaccines potently induce immunological repertoire associated with the generation of high magnitude long-lived antibodies. mRNA is highly unstable under physiological conditions and due to the hydrophilicity and strong net negative charge of RNA not taken up efficiently by cells after application in vivo. pepini et al. report that a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine elicits an inflammatory response within a few hours indicated by the upregulation of several IFN-stimulated genes. antigen expression and immunogenicity were both enhanced in the absence of IFN-/ signaling. mRNA vaccines are able to induce humoral and cellular immune responses. they encode any antigen of choice and allow a high degree of adaptability. mRNA vaccines are able to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses. self-amplifying mRNA vaccines encoding various influenza antigens complexed with LNP or oil-in-water cationic nanoemulsions were immunogenic in ferrets. a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine encoding an HIV-1 clade C envelope glycoprotein formulated in CNE induced potent cellular as well as binding and neutralizing antibody responses in NHPs. however, so far, self-amplifying mRNA vaccines a phase I/II, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of this ZIKV mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1325) was initiated in December 2016 with an estimated primary completion date in September 2018 (NCT03014089) no clinical studies employing mRNA vaccines in the context of Ebolavirus have been initiated. no clinical studies have been initiated using mRNA vaccines in the context of Ebolavirus vaccines. both H10 and H7 mRNA vaccines tested at doses ranging from 200 to 400 g generated robust HI titers after a single IM or ID immunization. however, upon both H10 and H7 immunization, NHPs that received the 400 g dose experienced some systemic symptoms which resolved within 2\u20133 days. Viral vector based vaccines rely on the delivery of one or more antigens encoded in the context of an unrelated, modified virus. this technology either employs live (replicating but often attenuated) or non-replicating vectors. this technology either employs live (replicating but often attenuated) or non-replicating vectors. adenoviridae are non-enveloped viruses with an icosahedral capsid and a linear double-stranded DNA genome. the vector is easily manipulated by insertion of a transgene cassette into the viral backbone via homologous recombination or through a direct cloning step in vitro. adenoviral vectors are able to induce potent antibody as well as T cell responses with variations in the immune response depending on the serotype employed (28). the widespread pre-existing immunity to this virus in the human population hampers its clinical use (30) the ability to accept relatively large transgenes offers the opportunity to generate multi-pathogen or multivalent vaccines. however, the need to rescue the negative-sense RNA genome by reverse genetics renders manufacturing of the virus more complex compared to other viral vectors. MV vaccines can be grown in chick embryonic fibroblasts or cell lines such as vero or MRC-5 cells. the virus naturally infects livestock with sporadic infections found in humans. the resulting low risk of pre-existing immunity and the lack of a DNA intermediate during viral replication make VSV attractive as a safe vaccine for applications in humans. intranasal (43), intradermal (44, 45), and oral vaccination (46) have been tested for different viruses in clinical studies. the route of administration affects the quality of the induced immune response and the choice of application route thus depends on the target pathogen. the route of administration needs to be reliable and easy to perform in an outbreak situation. viral vector based vaccines can be delivered without additional adjuvants. high yield production processes with means of upscaling have been established. despite many advantages, several aspects have to be considered when developing a viral vector based vaccine. the presence of adventitious agents, i.e., microorganisms that may have been unintentionally introduced into the manufacturing process, needs to be assessed vigorously during vaccine manufacturing. the need to exclude contaminants requires extensive testing during various steps of the manufacturing process. several examples for contaminants in viral vaccines have highlighted the reality of this risk. first studies employing viral vector based approaches to develop vaccines against Ebolaviruses started as early as the 1990s. but most approaches were still in preclinical stages when the 2014 pandemic emerged. clinical trials were conducted for VSV-EBOV, ChAd3 vaccine, Ad26-EBOV, Ad5-EBOV, HPIV3, and MVA-vector vaccine (54) a clinical trial (NCT00374309) was initiated in 2006. this study showed safety as well as the induction of antibody and T cell responses, but no significant generation of virus neutralizing titers. this finding might compromise the use of Ad5 for the development of human vaccines. a phase II clinical study (NCT02575456) testing the Ad5 viral vector was initiated in Sierra Leone in October 2015. results are not yet publicly available. antibody titers in all participants by day 28 - Increased levels of total and VNTs upon delivery of higher doses NCT02231866; NCT02240875* Phase I Aug 2014\u2013Aug 2017 325 ChAd3, replication deficient Single dose IM 1 1010, 2.0 1010, 2.5 1010, 5 1010, 1 1011, 2.0 1011 VP Antigen: GP EBOV (1976) Safety: Acceptable safety profile, mild to moderate adverse events 0.8 and 63.5% of the participants at 1 and 12 months, respectively (83.7 and 79.5% for VSV-ZEBOV) NCT02283099; NCT02296983; NCT02287480 Phase I; Phase I/II Nov 2014 158 VSV, attenuated single dose IM 3 105, 3 106, 1 107, 2 107, 5 107 PFU Antigen: GP EBOV (1995) Safety: Acceptable, one GP, Glycoprotein, ICS, intracellular staining; IM, intramuscular; N, number of study participants; PFU, Plaque Forming Unit; SUDV, Sudan virus; VNT, virus neutralization titers; VP, viral particles. two vaccines developed by the NIAID VRC, i.e. replication defective ChAd3 encoding for EBOV GP alone or in combination with SUDV GP, were tested in preclin rVSV-ZEBOV currently represents the most promising candidate for the development of an effective vaccine against Ebolaviruses. the vaccine was tested in ten completed phase I clinical trials with the earliest study having been initiated in October 2014 (71). doses of 1 107 PFU or higher were associated with the development arthritis lasting a median of 8 days. some participants experiencing arthralgia developed a maculopapular rash indicative of VSV replication and dissemination. after this, the study was suspended and resumed one month later using a lower dose of 3 105 PFU. a wide array of different viruses has been employed as a basis for constructing viral vector based vaccines (23) these vectors include adenoviruses, parvoviruses (e.g., adeno-associated viruses, AAV), togaviruses (e.g., Semliki Forest virus), paramyxoviruses (e.g., semliki forest virus), rhabdoviruses (e.g., adenoviral vectors are able to stably express inserts of up to 8 kb. the vector is easily manipulated by insertion of a transgene cassette into the viral backbone via homologous recombination or through a direct cloning step in vitro. the vector is easily manipulated by insertion of a transgene cassette into the viral backbone via homologous recombination. MV is an enveloped virus with a non-segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of 16 kb. a lyophilization process for MV vaccine has been established, increasing the thermostability of the naturally unstable virus. MV vaccine induces extremely durable responses with both antibodies and CD8+ cell persisting as long as 25 years post vaccination. MV is able to infect cells of the immune system, including macrophages and dendritic cells, thus supporting delivery of target antigens directly to antigen-presenting cells. pre-existing immunity to MV as a viral vector has been raised as a concern. but studies in mice and macaques showed no impact of previous exposure on transgene immunity. introducing mutations in the viral matrix (M) protein, rearranging order of the viral protein, insertion of non-viral proteins and partial or complete deletion of the viral glycoprotein (G), the determinant for viral infectivity (40). attenuation is essential for vaccine safety, since neurovirulence of the wild-type VSV has been detected upon intracranial inoculation in animal models (41). viral-vectors are complex vaccines that induce strong immune responses. but the use of additional adjuvants is generally not required. some clinical studies have tested recombinant viral vaccines in combination with additional immune-stimulating components (48, 49) but found no increase in immunity in the adjuvanted group (49) production processes with means of upscaling have been established, supporting the use of viral vector based vaccines for pandemic settings. the use of viral vector based vaccines raises safety concerns for use in humans, such as potential integration into the host genome or too high replication of attenuated vaccines. the effect of pre-existing immunity on vector immunogenicity has to be addressed. if the viral vector is derived from a virus able to infect humans, the effect of pre-existing immunity on vector immunogenicity may or may not hamper immune responses. this effect may necessitate time and cost intensive screening procedures before clinical trials. clinical trials were conducted for VSV-EBOV, human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), recombinant cytomegalovirus (rCMV) and recombinant rabies virus (RABV) these vaccines rely on vector based expression of the viral glycprotein (GP), the only surface protein and single target of neutralizing antibodies alone or in combination with additional viral proteins. clinical trial (NCT00374309) was initiated in 2006 (Table 1). this study showed safety as well as the induction of antibody and T cell responses, but no significant generation of virus neutralizing titers. this study also showed that the induction of antibodies was reduced in participants with pre-existing immunity against Ad5. 55% (EBOV GP) of subjects in the higher dose group- No significant induction of VNTs - T cell responses in 82% (SUDV GP) and 64% (EBOV GP) of subjects in the higher dose group- No significant induction of VNTs - T cell responses in 82% (SUDV GP) antibody responses in almost all subjects; indications for durability (significant antibody titers detectable up to 48 weeks post vaccination) - VNTs in some subjects - Antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in some subjects. antibody responses in all subjects persisted for 6 months. no cases of Ebola virus disease with symptom onset at least 10 days after randomization (immediate vaccination), 16 cases from seven clusters (delayed vaccination) two vaccines developed by the NIAID VRC showed complete protection in NHPs for both vaccines 5 weeks after single injection, using 1010 viral particles. however, immune responses waned several months after prime vaccination which could be prevented by boosting with MVA encoding for GPs from EBOV and SUDV. rVSV-ZEBOV is the most promising candidate for the development of an effective vaccine against Ebolaviruses. the vaccine consists of a live attenuated VSV in which the VSV glycoprotein is removed and replaced with the GP from a 1995 EBOV strain. the vaccine was tested in ten completed phase I clinical trials. the frequency of GP specific antibody induction remained similar to cohorts vaccinated with higher doses (94%), levels of antibody responses were reduced. rVSV-ZEBOV demonstrated dose-dependent induction of GP reactive antibody titers in all participants but only mild adverse events without further cases of arthritis. development of different vaccines can take place without the need to establish new production, purification and validation methods. nucleic acid based technologies support fast and flexible vaccine development and production. synthesis mostly relies on chemically synthesized material. the most common route of administration was intramuscular injection using a conventional needle. however, vaccination with a DNA vector alone generally leads to relatively low immunogenicity. additional methods have been developed that are able to enhance DNA uptake, expression and immunogenicity. -12, are co-delivered with the encoded antigen. strategies to direct the antigen to certain cellular compartments or specifically target antigen presenting cells (APCs) to enhance immune responses have been established. DNA vaccines have successfully been employed for prime-boost regimen. a concern is the long-term persistence of plasmids upon IM injection. the presence of foreign genetic information in the nucleus of transfected cells poses the additional risk of genomic integration into the host's chromosomes. the FDA recommends integration studies to be included whenever plasmid DNA exceeding 30,000 copies per g persists in any tissue by study termination. the WHO recommends monitoring the persistence of a cytokine expressing plasmid to ensure vaccine safety. no DNA based vaccine is licensed for human use as yet, but several DNA based vaccines have been licensed for veterinary applications, such as an equine vaccine against west Nile Virus. the first phase I clinical trial (NCT00072605) using a DNA vaccine against Ebola was started in 2003, well before the Ebola crisis in 2014 (95) results demonstrated safety and tolerability of this vaccine as well as specific antibody responses to at least one of the three antigens. however, no detectable virus neutralizing responses were elicited in this trial. ovio is developing and testing their GP encoding DNA vaccine candidate INO-4212. a clinical trial was initiated in early 2015 (NCT02464670) preliminary results have shown a favorable safety profile. 90% of participants generated an Ebola-specific antibody immune response.

RNA in a mixture containing recombinant phage DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (typically derived from T7 or T3 or Sp6 phage) and nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) (108) purification of in vitro transcribed mRNA seems crucial for the amount of immunogen produced in target cells. up to 1,000-fold increased protein production in primary human DCs transfected with HPLC purified compared to unpurified the sequence of the ORF can be optimized using either enrichment of the GC content (123\u2013125) or by replacing rare codons by frequently used synonymous codons leading to increased protein production from mRNA (126). using chemically modified nucleosides can decrease innate immune activation and increase translation of the mRNA (127). despite these gene deletions, the viral RNA is replicated and transcribed by the viral RNA polymerase. micro mRNA is transcribed at very high levels, allowing the amplification of mRNA encoding the antigen of choice. mRNA encoding firefly luciferase induced protein expression lasting almost two months upon IM delivery. luciferase expression from protamine-formulated, non-replicating mRNA administered ID was usually detected for several days. exogenous mRNA has to enter the cytoplasm where protein expression can take place. induction of an effective immune response requires stimulation of the innate immune system by the mRNA vaccine. several methods to increase both cell delivery and adjuvanticity of mRNA vaccines have been developed. the candidate vaccine against rabies was investigated as the first ever prophylactic mRNA-based vaccine in healthy human volunteers. the vaccine was generally safe with a reasonable tolerability profile and led to the induction of neutralizing antibody titers. antibody responses waned one year after first vaccination but could be boosted to 05 IU/mL or higher in 57% of subjects using 80 g of mRNA delivered ID. lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the most promising and frequently used class of agents for in vivo delivery of mRNA vaccines. most LNPs rely on ionizable amino lipids which complex the negatively charged mRNA. phospholipids, cholesterol and lipid-anchored polyethylene glycol (PEG) are the most commonly used components for LNP formulations. the total amount of protein produced was largest for IV administration. duration of luciferase expression was the longest for ID followed by IM injection (161). intramuscular injection of mRNA vaccines is the most commonly practiced route of administration in humans. single IM immunization of NHPs with mRNAs encoding rabies or influenza antigens induced protective antibody titers. mRNA is immunostimulatory, as it is recognized by a variety of cell surface, endosomal and cytosolic innate immune receptors. mRNA vaccines upregulates the expression of chemokines and cytokines. the encoded protein was expressed and efficiently presented by APCs within the dLNs. the immunostimulation was limited to the injection site and lymphoid organs. no proinflammatory cytokines were detected in the serum. mRNA-based vaccines induce type-I IFN-polarized innate immunity. transfected DCs express the mRNA-encoded antigen in the native form. expressed proteins are processed into antigenic peptides. a non-replicating sequence optimized mRNA vaccine induced long-lived functional antibody responses against influenza A H1N1pdm in NHPs which persisted for one year (141) mRNA vaccines potently induce immunological repertoire associated with the generation of high magnitude long-lived antibodies. mRNA alone is not applicable for broad use as a prophylactic vaccine. mRNA vaccines, like DNA vaccines, are able to induce humoral and cellular immune responses, encode any antigen of choice and allow a high degree of self-reactive antibodies. mRNA vaccines are able to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses, encode any antigen of choice and allow a high degree of self-reactive antibodies in humans. production of mRNA vaccines is based on in vitro systems and does not require amplification in bacteria or cell cultures. mRNA vaccines represent a minimal vector containing the ORF encoding the antigen of choice flanked by specific regulatory elements. they do not induce anti-vector immunity as observed for certain viral vector-based platforms. a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine encoding an HIV-1 clade C envelope glycoprotein formulated in CNE induced potent cellular as well as binding and neutralizing antibody responses. a modified dendrimer nanoparticle (MDNP)-based RNA replicon vaccine platform provides protection against lethal influenza and Ebola virus infections and elicits antibody and CD8+ T cell responses against Zika virus.

HI titers were generated after a single IM or ID immunization. however, upon both H10 and H7 immunization, NHPs that received the 400 g dose experienced some systemic symptoms which resolved within 2\u20133 days. interim results from a phase I first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of the H10N8 mRNA vaccine administered IM at a dose of 100 g in healthy eukaryotic expression cassette is comprised of a 5\u2032 promotor, typically derived from cytomegalovirus (CMV) that supports high transcription levels, the gene of interest and a 3\u2032 polyadenylation (poly A) signal. vaccination with a DNA vector alone generally leads to relatively low immunogenicity, especially in large animal models and humans. different formulations of DNA have been tested, i.e., encapsulation in lipid nanoparticles, containing cationic lipids and cholesterol, adsorption to polymers such as polyethyleneimine and adsorption or encapsulation in biodegradable nanoparticles. different approaches to modify and improve DNA mediated immune responses have been developed. several studies have established a role for bone marrow derived APCs in the activation of MHCI restricted CD8+ T cells upon DNA vaccination. but the most likely mechanism in this scenario seems to be cross-priming and presentation of both MHCI and MHCII restricted antigens upon DNA vaccination. the FDA recommends integration studies to be included whenever plasmid DNA exceeding 30,000 copies per g of host DNA persists in any tissue by study termination. the FDA recommends integration studies as part of the preclinical safety program of DNA vaccines9. no anti-DNA antibodies have been detected in mice, rats, rabbits or non-human primates. preclinical experiments employed DNA vector based antigen expression. these approaches relied on expression of the viral glycoprotein (GP) to induce neutralizing antibodies as well as nucleoprotein (NP) as a target for antibody as well as T cell responses. induction of humoral and T cell-mediated immunity was demonstrated. 80% of subjects were found to elicit specific antibody responses against one of the GPs. a phase Ib study (NCT00997607) was conducted in Uganda in 2009 (97) no detectable virus neutralizing responses NCT00605514 EBOLA Phase I Jan 2008 20 DNA, mono or bivalent; NF inj.dev.

Vical Inc. has developed and tested a vaccine that targets the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza endemic in poultry. its ability to cross the species barrier, that was first discovered in 1997 and caused rising numbers of human infections between 2003 and 2008, renders this virus a high pathogenic risk. so far, the virus is not able to spread efficiently and sustainably from human to human. based approach encoding hemagglutinin protein of A/California/04/2009(H1N1pdm09) whose GMP production was finalized 2 months before licensed monovalent influenza vaccines became available. but 4 weeks after the last vaccination, only 30% of subjects had developed positive HI responses that increased to 72%. preclinical results from NCT02809443 (103) demonstrated the induction of neutralizing antibodies and protection from challenge infection in 17 of 18 NHPs upon two IM vaccinations using a needle free injection device. both vaccine candidates are evaluated in clinical studies by the Vaccine Research Center (VRC), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) eukaryotic expression cassette is comprised of a 5\u2032 promotor, typically derived from cytomegalovirus (CMV) that supports high transcription levels, the gene of interest and a 3\u2032 polyadenylation (poly A) signal. vaccination with a DNA vector alone generally leads to relatively low immunogenicity, especially in large animal models and humans. oration is among the most widely used and has been shown to yield promising results in both preclinical and clinical trials (79, 80) different formulations of DNA have been tested, i.e., encapsulation in lipid nanoparticles, containing cationic lipids and cholesterol, adsorption to polymers such as polyethyleneimine and adsorption or encapsulation in biodegradable nanoparticles. several studies have established a role for bone marrow derived APCs in the activation of MHCI restricted CD8+ T cells upon DNA vaccination. however, IM vaccination with DNA vectors mostly results in transfection of myocytes (84). a concern in this context is the long-term persistence of DNA plasmids upon injection. the FDA recommends integration studies to be included whenever plasmid DNA exceeding 30,000 copies per g of host DNA persists in any tissue by study termination. the WHO advises integration studies as part of the preclinical safety program of DNA vaccines9. s against Ebolaviruses developed in preclinical experiments employed DNA vector based antigen expression. these approaches relied on expression of the viral glycoprotein (GP) to induce neutralizing antibodies as well as nucleoprotein (NP) as a target for antibody as well as T cell responses. induction of humoral and T cell-mediated immunity was demonstrated in guinea pigs and mice. two different DNA vaccines encoding for GPs of two species of Ebolavirus were administered. 80% of subjects were found to elicit specific antibody responses against one of the GPs. both vaccines were well tolerated but immune responses remained poor.

Vical Inc. has developed and tested a vaccine that targets the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza endemic in poultry. its ability to cross the species barrier, that was first discovered in 1997 and caused rising numbers of human infections between 2003 and 2008, renders this virus a high pathogenic risk. so far, the virus is not able to spread efficiently and sustainably from human to human. a gene based approach encoding hemagglutinin protein of a/California/04/2009(H1N1pdm09) whose GMP production was finalized 2 months before licensed monovalent influenza vaccines became available. but 4 weeks after the last vaccination, only 30% of subjects had developed positive HI responses that increased to 72%, 4 weeks after boosting with a licensed influenza vaccine. preclinical results from NCT02809443 (103) demonstrated that the vaccine was well-tolerated and induced neutralizing antibodies in 62% of the participants. a preclinical study published in October 2016 demonstrated the induction of neutralizing antibodies and protection from challenge infection in 17 of 18 NHPs upon two IM vaccinations using a needle free injection device. non-replicating mRNA contains the sequence of the antigen of choice flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) the advantages of using non-replicating mRNA vaccines are rooted in the simplicity of the construct, the small size of the RNA, and the absence of additional encoded proteins that could induce unintended immune responses. the 5\u2032 cap is vital for the creation of stable mature mRNA. it increases protein translation via binding to eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E. the cap can be added during the transcription by inclusion of a cap analog or anti-reverse cap (ARCA) in the reaction (115), or using the vaccinia virus capping complex (116). additional mRNA contains a sub-genomic promoter and a large ORF encoding for non-structural proteins. RDRP produces a negative-sense copy of the genome which serves as a template for two positive-strand RNA molecules. this sub-genomic mRNA is transcribed at very high levels, allowing the amplification of mRNA encoding the antigen of choice. alternative method is packaging and delivery in virus-like replicon particles (VRPs) produced by a helper cell line that provides the capsid and glycoprotein genes in trans (134) the lack of structural protein genes contained in VRPs prevents production of further viral particles and cell-to-cell spread. this technology requires the use of electroporation into cell culture cells during the manufacturing process. al and cellular immune responses induced by naked mRNA remain low compared to LNP-formulated mRNA (141). mRNA vaccines that likely increase vaccine release into the cytoplasm have been shown to induce immune responses in mice upon administration of non-replicating mRNA and self-amplifying mRNA using a gene gun and in vivo electroporation. efficacy of mRNA vaccines can benefit significantly from complexing agents such as lipid- and polymer-based nanoparticles. lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the most promising and frequently used class of agents for in vivo delivery of mRNA vaccines. lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the most promising and frequently used class of agents. the route of mRNA administration has a crucial impact on the quality and strength of the induced immune response. the route of administration has been shown to effectively induce a balanced immune response including antibodies as well as Th1 type and cytotoxic T cells for mRNA vaccines formulated in protamine. potent IM mRNA vaccines must allow high antigen expression and presentation and simultaneously induce strong immunostimulatory signals to recruit immune cells to the injection site. the IM administration of non-replicating nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccines against the Zika virus and influenza A H10N8 and H7N9 viruses proved to be immunogenic. ID immunization with mRNA vaccines upregulates expression of chemokines. protamine-formulated non-replicating sequence optimized mRNA vaccines are taken up by non-leukocytic and leukocytic cells. mRNA was then transported to the draining lymph nodes (dLNs) by migratory dendritic cells. mRNA vaccine resulted in spontaneous uptake of the mRNA by cells surrounding the injection site and strong expression inside transiently transfected cells. mRNA vaccines containing modified nucleotides induced rapid and local infiltration of neutrophils, monocytes, and DCs. this coincided with upregulation of type I IFN-inducible genes, including Mx1 and CXCL10. replicating mRNA encoding influenza A H10 HA encapsulated in LNPs showed that both ID and IM administration induced titers considered to be protective. the memory B cell pool waned over time but remained detectable throughout the 25-week study. a self-amplifying mRNA vaccine elicits an inflammatory response within a few hours indicated by the upregulation of several IFN-stimulated genes. antigen expression and immunogenicity were both enhanced in the absence of IFN-/ signaling, suggesting that reduction of early type I IFN responses could improve RNA vaccine potency (169). mRNA vaccines, like DNA vaccines, are able to induce humoral and cellular immune responses, encode any antigen of choice and allow a high degree of adaptability. mRNA vaccines are based on in vitro systems and does not require amplification in bacteria or cell cultures. preclinical studies have shown promising results for both self-amplifying and non-replicating mRNA vaccines to confer protection against various pathogens. self-amplifying mRNA vaccines encoding various influenza antigens complexed with LNP or oil-in-water cationic nanoemulsions (CNE) were immunogenic in ferrets, facilitating containment of viral replication in the upper respiratory tract upon influenza infection. mRNA vaccines induce immune responses and confer protection against pathogens with pandemic potential such as ZIKV, EBOV and influenza. some of these approaches are currently being tested in clinical trials. some of these approaches are currently being tested in clinical trials. mRNA encoding EBOV GP delivered IM was shown to induce EBOV-specific IgG and neutralizing antibody responses and protected guinea pigs against lethal infection and signs of clinical illness (175) no clinical studies employing mRNA vaccines in the context of Ebolavirus have been initiated. IM as LNP formulation elicited functional antibody responses in NHPs. a single low dose (0.4\u201310 g) of H7N9 mRNA vaccine applied ID or IM protected mice from a lethal homologous challenge and reduced lung viral titers. non-replicating mRNA vaccines can induce functional antibody titers at levels associated with protection with acceptable tolerability profiles upon parenteral administration. mRNA is an intermediate carrier of genetic information used as template for endogenous protein production in the vaccinated subject. purification of in vitro transcribed mRNA appears crucial for the amount of immunogen produced in target cells. the in vitro transcribed mRNA product contains a protein-encoding open reading frame (ORF) flanked by elements essential for the function of mature eukaryotic mRNA. the 5\u2032 cap is vital for the creation of stable mature mRNA. self-amplifying mRNA vaccines are most commonly based on the alphavirus genome. the genes encoding the structural protein have been replaced with the antigen of choice. the full length mRNA of the self-amplifying mRNA vaccines is substantially larger (9\u201310 kb for alphavirus systems) mRNA vaccine will be amplified many times, resulting in high levels of antigen expression from relatively low doses of the vaccine. self-amplifying mRNA is most commonly delivered with synthetic delivery vehicles. alternative method is packaging and delivery in virus-like replicon particles (VRPs) produced by a helper cell line that provides the capsid and glycoprotein genes in trans (134) mRNA is a small arginine-rich nuclear protein that stabilizes nucleic acids. mRNA has to enter the cytoplasm where protein expression can take place. mRNA has some intrinsic innate stimulation function. this effect can be increased by different ways of mRNA formulation. subjects received 80\u2013640 g of the mRNA vaccine three times by needle-free injection. the vaccine was generally safe with a reasonable tolerability profile. antibody responses waned one year after first vaccination but could be boosted to 05 IU/mL or higher in 57% of subjects using 80 g of mRNA delivered ID. LNPs are the most promising and frequently used class of agents for in vivo delivery of non-viral mRNA vaccines. most rely on ionizable amino lipids which complex the negatively charged mRNA. phospholipids, cholesterol and lipid-anchored polyethylene glycol are the most commonly used components for LNP formulations. LNP-formulated mRNA coding for luciferase showed that the total amount of protein produced was largest for IV administration. duration of luciferase expression was the longest for ID followed by IM injection (161) IM injection delivers mRNA vaccines directly into the skin, an organ densely populated with professional APCs. mRNAs encoding rabies or influenza antigens induced protective antibody titers. exogenous mRNA is immunostimulatory, as it is recognized by a variety of cell surface, endosomal and cytosolic innate immune receptors. mRNA vaccines upregulates expression of chemokines and cytokines. the immunostimulation was limited to the injection site and lymphoid organs. no proinflammatory cytokines were detected in the serum of the immunized mice. mRNA-based vaccines induce type-I IFN-polarized immunity. transfected DCs express the mRNA-encoded antigen in the native form. expressed proteins are subsequently processed into antigenic peptides. antigen expressed in the correctly folded native form can be recognized by B cells that in response produce antibodies against the antigen. non-replicating mRNA vaccines potently induce immunological repertoire associated with the generation of high magnitude long-lived antibodies. mRNA alone is not applicable for broad use as a prophylactic vaccine. unprotected mRNA is highly unstable under physiological conditions. mRNA vaccines, like DNA vaccines, are able to induce humoral and cellular immune responses, encode any antigen of choice and allow a high degree of adaptability. mRNA vaccines, like DNA vaccines, are able to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses, encode any antigen of choice and allow a high degree of adaptability. mRNA vaccines do not interact with the host-cell DNA. they do not induce anti-vector immunity as observed for certain viral vector-based platforms. mRNA vaccines offer a flexible one-for-all large-scale, rapid and cost-effective manufacturing process. RNA replicons encoding the glycoprotein complex of the Lassa virus encapsulated into VRP particles were immunogenic and protective in mice. a modified dendrimer nanoparticle-based RNA replicon vaccine platform provides protection against lethal influenza and Ebola virus infections. however, so far, self-amplifying mRNA vaccines have not been tested in clinical studies. Vaccine and delivery Outcome NCT03014089 ZIKA Phase I/II Dec 2016 90 mRNA 1325, modified nucleotides; LNP-formulated, Antigen: HA of H10N8 A/Jiangxi-Donghu/346/2013 Interim results published for 100 g IM (N = 23) vs. placebo. mRNA vaccines encoding influenza HA were protective in mice on homologous challenge with influenza H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1. a single low dose (0.4\u201310 g) of H7N9 mRNA vaccine applied ID or IM protected mice from a lethal homologous challenge and reduced lung viral titers. a phase I first-in-human, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of the H10N8 mRNA vaccine administered IM at a dose of 100 g in healthy adult subjects showed high seroconversion rates. Adverse events were mild or moderate with only few severe and non-serious events. no details of these studies are available as yet. a number of clinical trials have demonstrated that viral vector based vaccines show great promise for inducing protective responses in humans. however, antigen delivery in the context of an unrelated virus renders this technology relatively complex in terms of manufacturing. the presence of immune targets other than the target antigen can lead to unfavorable effects. RNA vaccines represent the most recently developed technology described here. their use in humans is less well characterized than for viral vector or DNA based vaccines. clinical studies conducted so far have yielded overall encouraging results in terms of safety and immunogenicity."}
