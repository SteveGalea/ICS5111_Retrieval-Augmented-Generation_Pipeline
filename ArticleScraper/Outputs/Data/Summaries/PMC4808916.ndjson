{"summary": "the traditional deterministic compartmental models usually assume homogeneous mixing, which means that each individual has the same probability of contact with all of the others in the population. this assumption is not the case in reality, because heterogeneity can arise due to many sources [5], including age, sex, susceptibility to disease, position in space and the activities and behaviors of individuals. X i represents the number of effective contacts that the i-th susceptible individual makes with infectious individuals per unit time. i are the mean of the number of effective contacts that the i-th susceptible individual makes with infectious individuals per unit time. in reality, individuals typically come into contact with only a small, clustered, subpopulation [20] the conditional distribution of X i given i = is: P ( X i = x | i = ) = e - x x!, x = 0, 1, 2, We obtain the marginal distribution of X i : P ( X i = x ) = 0 g ( ) P ( X i = x ) d = x + k - 1 x ( m m + 1 ) k the difference equation relating S t and I t at successive time steps t and t + 1 is: S t + 1 = S t ( 1 + I t k N ) - k = S t - [ 1 - ( 1 + I t k N ) - k. k is the risk of a susceptible individual becoming infected between time t and t + 1. the author used the transmission function, k ln ( 1 + I k ) to model a possum-tuberculosis (TB) system. the influence of different transmission functions on a simulated pathogen spread was studied in [29]. the NBD transmission function used in [28] can be regarded as a generalized density-dependent transmission function. a susceptible individual in compartment S is infected after effective contact with an infectious individual in compartment I and then enters the exposed compartment E. when the latent period ends, the individual enters the recovered class R and will never be infected again [4,22]. the parameter is the rate at which individuals in the exposed category become infectious per unit time, and its reciprocal is the average infectious period. the parameter refers to the birth and death rates. it is irrelevant to k, which means that it does not depend on the level of heterogeneity. X i represents the number of effective contacts that the i-th susceptible individual makes with infectious individuals per unit time. i are the mean of the number of effective contacts that the i-th susceptible individual makes with infectious individuals per unit time. in reality, individuals typically come into contact with only a small, clustered, subpopulation [20] the probability density function of an NBD with mean k m and variance k ( 1 + m ) m2 can be represented by the zero term of the NBD. p = P ( X i = 0 ) = ( m m + 1 ) k = ( 1 + 1 m ) - k = ( 1 + 1 m ) - k. steps t and t + 1 are: S t + 1 = S t ( 1 + I t k N ) - k = S t - [ 1 - ( 1 + I t k N ) - k. r i s k = 1 - e r a t e, we obtain the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected at time t. lim k k ln ( 1 + I k ) S = S I (3) when k, the NBD transmission function we derived here approximates the frequency-dependent transmission function of the homogeneous-mixing model. therefore, it can be regarded as a generalized density-dependent transmission function [1,4]. a susceptible individual in compartment S is infected after effective contact with an infectious individual in compartment I and then enters the exposed compartment E. the individual enters the recovered class R and will never be infected again. death induced by the disease is not considered here. this is identical to that of the homogeneous-mixing model with a frequency-dependent transmission function. the parameter refers to the birth and death rates. it is irrelevant to k, meaning it does not depend on the level of heterogeneity. a low level of heterogeneity results in dynamics similar to those predicted by the homogeneous-mixing model with a frequency-dependent transmission term, S I N. this is consistent with the conclusion inferred in Equation (2). the disease persists over a long term in the population. a proportion of the susceptible individuals come into contact with infectious individuals and become infected. k drops to a very small value, there will be no disease outbreak. k = 10 - 4, 1 = 7 days, 1 = 5 days and 1 = 70 years. initial conditions are S ( 0 ) = 99, 999, E ( 0 ) = 0, I ( 0 ) = 1 and R ( 0 ) = 0. the circle markers denote the daily reported SARS cases. the parts of the curve to the left and right of the vertical line are the infectious curves before and after the control strategies were taken. we calibrated the NBD model to the data of the daily cases. the birth and death rate was assumed to be 1 / 70 y e a r - 1. the starting points of the parameters for the calibration procedure were selected randomly between the bounds of the parameters shown in Table 1. the infectious curves with fixed, but different values of k achieve a peak after a period that is almost the same in duration. a low level of heterogeneity results in dynamics similar to those predicted by the homogeneous-mixing model. the top curve in (A) is the infectious curve of the homogeneous-mixing model with a frequency-dependent transmission term. it is compared to the infectious curves of the NBD model with k = 0. 0001 and k = 0. 001. at the overall level, the heterogeneity slows the transmission speed and decreases the peak sizes. it is shown that contact patterns exhibit more heterogeneity than that assumed by homogeneous-mixing models. but they do not appear extremely heterogeneous. we only show the results for a relatively small value of k = 10 - 4. for larger values of, the infectious curves reach their peaks earlier. in total, 2048 confirmed cases were reported during the entire outbreak period. on 20 April, a larger number of cases were reported, and the Chinese government canceled the May Day holiday in an effort to reduce the mass movement of people [43] a general increase in SARS awareness played an important role in controlling the outbreak [42] in order to compute the NRMSE, we solved the set of differential equations (Equation (4)) with unknown parameters, and k = k 1 from 7 March to 20 April. the initial conditions were set as follows: S ( 0 ) = 1. 4564 10 7, which was the size of the permanent population in Beijing in 2003 [47]. assumed 1 / Latent period ( 2, 7 ) days [48] 1 / Infectious period ( 2, 10 ) days [48] 1 / Expected human lifetime 70 years Assumed Because of the stochasticity of the GlobalSearchalgorithm [44,45], the results varied slightly every time. we ran the procedure 100 times. the developed NBD model can be regarded as a generalized homogeneous-mixing model with a frequency-dependent transmission function. the higher is the level of heterogeneity in contact rates, the greater is the difference in the disease dynamics observed from those predicted using the homogeneous-mixing models. in recent years, several network-based models have been developed to study the influence of contact heterogeneity on disease transmission. this is because our approach belongs to the mean-field class of approaches and considers a large population at the overall level. the work in [51,52] applied \"edge-based compartmental modeling\" the developed model considers the heterogeneity of contact rates in the population. a low level of heterogeneity results in dynamics similar to those predicted by homogeneous mixing models."}
