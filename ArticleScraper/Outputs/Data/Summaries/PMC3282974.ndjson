{"summary": "clinical manifestations of KD include prolonged fever (1-2 weeks, mean 10-11 days), conjunctival injection, oral lesions, polymorphous skin rashes, extremity changes, and cervical lymphadenopathy. some more severely affected patients show cardiac complications, particularly coronary artery lesions (CALs), which develop in approximately one quarter of untreated children. clinical data suggest that KD is an immunological reaction to infectious triggers occurring in genetically susceptible children. inflammatory indices change throughout the disease process; elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), leukocyte count with neutrophilia (lymphopenia), platelet count, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and other inflammation associated enzymes. epidemiological studies in far East Asian countries have revealed that KD is a new disease with similar epidemiologic patterns in these countries. after the initial appearance of KD, the incidence of KD showed a gradual increase for a decade up to a nationwide occurrence (becoming an endemic disease) the appearance and subsequent incidence of KD may be associated with the time of industrialization and westernization of these countries. the age of around 5 years old in childhood is the turning point of immune maturation of the host. phenotypes of some infectious diseases are age-dependent. younger children (5 years of age) show less severe clinical symptoms and signs. molecular genetics has become an area of interest for the study of KD. many genetic studies have evaluated variants in candidate KD genes. a number of variants, including inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate 3-kinase (ITPKC) and caspase-3, have been implicated. etiologic agents were variants of normal flora produced by environmental changes. microflora in infants are nearly identical except for tiny genetic variations. environment factors and possibly genetic factors can affect the distribution of microflora and induce the variants of normal flora. the levels of white blood cells (WBC) and neutrophil counts and CRP levels were highest, while the albumin and HDL-cholesterol levels were lowest, at the sixth day. the findings suggest that the inflammatory processes of KD progress to a peak, then regress to a convalescent stage during the febrile period. the immune cells involved in tissue destruction have a predominant role in the early stages of KD. inflammatory intensities of mildly affected patients (a), moderately affected patients (the average of the patients) and severely affected patients (c) the severely affected patients reach the threshold line earlier, and before the peak in inflammation. laboratory findings are now mandatory for diagnosis of incomplete KD. patients who fulfill more than 3 of these complementary indices can be treated with IVIG as having incomplete KD followed by echocardiography. cals begin at the point where the threshold line and the curve of inflammation intersect, and more severely affected patients reach the threshold line earlier before the peak stage of inflammation. early IVIG treatment before the peak stage is mandatory to reduce the risk of CALs and the progression of CALs. IVIG has a potent anti-inflammatory effect on KD although its mode of action is unknown. approximately 10-15% of KD patients are IVIG non-responders. some study groups have tried early aggressive treatment for CALs with IVIG (2 g/kg), aspirin, and methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) or infliximab. this treatment policy also has some obstacles such as overtreatment of patients with mild clinical course. IVIG non-responders generally have persistently elevated inflammatory parameters, such as neutrophil counts and CRP. the cut-off values of >13000/L for total WBC count, >51% for neutrophil differential and 7.2 g/dL for total protein had reasonable sensitivity. clinicians can use these parameters easily and quickly for the evaluation of the severity of inflammation in KD. the dose of the second IVIG infusion (1 or 2 g/kg) was assessed on a case-by-case basis. patients who failed to respond received a further dose of 1 g/kg. those whose WBC count and/or CRP decreased following the initial IVIG treatment received a second dose of 2 g/kg. re-infusion of IVIG (2 g/kg), methylprednisolone pulse therapy (30 mg/kg, for 3 days), infliximab (anti-TNF- antibodies) and more powerful immune-modulators such as cyclophosphamide or methotrexate have been tried. a brief review of resembling diseases may be helpful. acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) are well-documented after GAS infections. the majority of GAS infected patients recover uneventfully. only some patients who have genetic susceptibility may be affected with ARF. the immunopathogenesis of KD is closer to that of scarlet fever than scarlet fever. the causes of death in both acute KD and ARF are extensive carditis. there are also rare incidences of a sepsis-like syndrome with multiple organ failure. an organ specific cell produces its own specific proteins. some proteins are produced only during the embryonic stage. some proteins are produced in later stages of the life cycle of mammals. pathogenesis of these genetic diseases may be associated with transformed proteins, including prions. a systemic infectious disease may be defined as the state in which etiologic agents and inflammatory mediators from pathogens have been completely removed by immune cells. a strict protein control system controls the balance of proteins and removes the pathogenic proteins at a molecular level in humans. the immune system of the host is one of the protein homeostasis systems in vivo. pathogen recognition receptors (TLRs) induce the production of anti-agent proteins (in case of viruses and interferons) these proteins may affect the function of adaptive immune reactions such as control of expression of co-stimulatory receptors. RNAs may also be controlled by proteins, including DNA polymerases and nucleases, suggesting complex mechanisms of protein homeostasis at a cell level. superantigens can induce activation of many T-cell clones which have specific V chains. in any human disease including KD, clinical implications of polyclonal activation of T cells have not been clearly explained. more T cells subtypes, which produce different cytokines, may exist in different pathogenic lesions in vivo. the functions of T cells are more diverse and complex than we have previously known. pathogenic proteins responsible for KD or ARF are unknown. specific immune cell clones produce various inflammatory cytokines and counter-inflammatory cytokines. a cytokine imbalance may be associated with endothelial cell injury in KD. the substances from the injured cells recruit more immune cells with more cytokine production. immunopathogenesis of acute lung injury in mycoplasma pneumoniae and influenza virus infections. the severity of pneumonia was correlated with lymphocyte counts at presentation. early immune-modulators (corticosteroids or IVIG) induced dramatic recovery of severe pneumonic consolidations within a day.99,100. study group of Yeung15 presented an interesting model for the pathogenesis of KD using a mouse model of KD. they created experimental mice which were able to develop coronary arteritis in response to intraperitoneal injections of lactobacillus casei cell wall extract (LCWE) adaptive immune deficiency mice and TCR -chain deficiency mice cannot produce vasculitis. in these infections, T cell deficiency mice or T cells depressed mice had less severe pneumonia with prolonged survival time and little pathologic findings compared to control mice. iology of KD remains unknown, the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of KD suggest that etiologic agent(s) are associated with environmental changes of improved public hygiene and/or industrialization. CALs in KD may occur in the early stages of systemic inflammation."}
