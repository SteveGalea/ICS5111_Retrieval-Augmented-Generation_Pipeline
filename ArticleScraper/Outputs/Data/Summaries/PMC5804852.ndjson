{"summary": "microbial etiology of community-acquired pneumonia is often unclear in clinical practice. population-based studies examining etiology and incidence are lacking. incidence of CAP requiring hospitalization was 20.6 cases per 10000 adults/year. the LUH provides secondary care for the inhabitants of Reykjavik and nearby towns. it also provides 90% of all intensive care in the country. inclusion criteria were a new chest x-ray infiltrate and 2 additional symptoms. an oropharyngeal swab was collected for culture prior to in-hospital antimicrobial treatment. results from physician-ordered etiological diagnostic testing were also included. urine antigens were tested using commercially available tests. data were compared using 2 and Fisher\u2019s exact test as appropriate. risk factors were examined in conjunction with specific etiologic results. variables included were age, sex, any underlying disease, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2. data collection Potential participants were approached within 24 hours of admission and underwent a structured interview. results were: length of stay (LOS), admission to intensive care units (ICUs), assisted ventilation, and in-house mortality. results of real-time PCR for S pneumoniae and H influenzae were considered positive at a cycle threshold of 35 or less to exclude false-positive results due to carriage. informed consent was obtained from individual participants or proxy included in the study. 511 cases approached with suspected pneumonia, 15 (3%) chose not to participate and 496 gave consent. 123 cases did not meet criteria for pneumonia, and exclusion criteria were present in 63 cases. 310 admissions were included in this study or 95% of all potential cases. 2 (6) 3 (14) 1 (13) 2 (29) 0 4 (14) 1 (17) 1 (17) 7 (15) 3 (7) 5 (17) COPD 80 (26) 19 (31) 5 (14) 4 (18) 5 (63) 4 (57) 0 2 (7) 2 (33) 1 (17) 7 (15) 6 (14) 7 (23) Ischemic heart disease 63 (20) 9 (15) 5 (14) 2 (9) 2 (25) 3 (43) 1 (20) 3 (11) 0 1 (17) 6 (13) 8 (19 0 2 (40) 14 (43) 0 4 (67) 16 (34) 28 (65) 2 (27) Influenza vaccinationd 125 (40) 19 (31) 10 (28) 10 (46) 4 (50) 4 (57) 3 (60) 3 (11) 2 (33) 5 (83) 16 (34) 11 (26) 12 (40) Prior Pneumococcal vaccination 43 (14)e 7 (12) 1 (3) 5 (23) 0 4 (57) 1 (20) 2 (7) 0 2 (33) 7 (15 eOf 168 patients 65 years of age, 32 (19%) had received pneumococcal vaccination. overall incidence of CAP requiring hospital admission was 20.6 cases per 10000 adults per year. one pathogen detected 2.0 1.0 1.5 6.8 7.8 aPopulation statistics derived from publicly available official data. multiple agents were detected in 30 cases (10%; Table 3), and the most commonly identified organism was S pneumoniae, (61 cases, 20%). a respiratory virus was recovered in 47 cases (15%), and an atypical bacterial agent was recovered in 43 cases (14%). a complete set of samples was available in 58 cases (19%), an etiological agent was detected in 45 cases (78%), and multiple pathogens were identified in 15 cases (26%). a complete set of samples was available in 58 cases (19%), an etiological agent was detected in 45 cases (78%), and multiple pathogens were identified in 15 cases (26%). aTests performed were cultures of sputum and blood, antigen testing of urine, and PCR analysis of upper airway swabs. the different detection rates of M pneumoniae among those with and without prior antimicrobial was statistically significant. dThe different detection rates of S pneumoniae among those with and without prior antimicrobial use were statistically significant when PCR results were excluded. viral activity was stable during the study period. however, viral activity had 2 separate peaks. the later peak coincided with the 2009 influenza pandemic. the likelihood of identifying influenza was higher amongst those not vaccinated against influenza when compared directly. all influenza cases with hemoptysis were caused by A(H1N1)pdm09 (n = 22), and the association with hemoptysis was significant for these cases when compared with other participants.

LOS and rates of ICU admission and need for assisted ventilation were similar regardless of microbial etiology."}
