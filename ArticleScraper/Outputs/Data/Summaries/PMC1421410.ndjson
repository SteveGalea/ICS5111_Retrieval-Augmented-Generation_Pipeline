{"summary": "a one-step reverse-transcription PCR assay was developed to detect the H5N1 avian influenza A virus. the specificity of the assay was shown by testing sub-types of influenza A virus and other viral and bacterial pathogens. Detection was 100% from allantoic fluid in H5N1 positive samples, suggesting it was a reliable sampling source for accurate detection. influenza A viruses can be classified into subtypes based on antigenic differences in the two surface glycoproteins. other viral proteins include the nucleoprotein (NP) which is the main structural protein, membrane proteins (M1 and M2), polymerase proteins (PA, PB1 and PB2), and non-structural proteins (NS1 and NS2). the pathogenic H5N1 subtype of avian influenza A has been reported to cross the species barrier and infect humans. RNA isolation Extraction of total RNA was performed following manufacturers' protocol from QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) and TRIZOL (invitrogen, USA) using all necessary safety precautions. resultant RNA was dissolved in 20 l of RNase-free water. PCR 2 l of RNA was used in 25 l reaction mixtures using the one-Step reverse transcription (RT)-PCR system (Qiagen, Germany) with H5N1 specific primers (forward primer: 5'-ACTATGAAGAATTGAAACACCT-3' and reverse primer: 5'-GCAATGAAATTTCCATTACTCTC-3') the size of this PCR product was resolved in 1.2 % agarose gels. amplification of in vitro-transcribed single-stranded RNA measured by RiboGreen RNA quantitation reagent and H5N1 RNA extracted from allantoic fluid of infected egg. viral load is indicated by the number of copies per reaction, (lane 2) 1 109 copies per reaction, (lane 3) 1 108 copies per reaction, (lane 4) 1 107 copies per reaction, (lane 5) 1 106 copies per reaction, (lane 7) 1 a panel of avian and human subtypes (H1 to H16) of Influenza A virus was screened. results showed that there was reactivity only against the H5 subtypes. the matrix gene from these samples was amplified in parallel. samples ranged from homogenized pooled organs and tissues, allantoic fluid, cloacal and tracheal swabs. all showed positive results with 100% positive detection for allantoic fluid, 67% for cloacal and tracheal swabs. a variation in detection could be due to different efficiencies in viral RNA recovery from the different samples. lu\"-like pneumonia 1 Streptococcus pneumoniae \"Flu\"-like, pneumonia 1 Mycoplasma pneumoniae \"Flu\"-like, malaise 1 Mycobacterium Fever, malaise, dyspnea 1 Figure 2. Specific detection of H5N1 avian influenza A virus from archived human and avian samples. positive H5N1 RNA sample from in vitro-transcribed single-stranded RNA was used (lane 2). the same set of RNA samples were tested against the matrix gene. human 3028 (A/Vietnam/3028/2004, lanes 3 to 11); Avian 933 (lA/Chicken/Vietnam/933/2004, lanes 15 to 23) and Avian 949B (lA/Chicken/Vietnam/933/2004, lanes 24 to 32) were tested in parallel with an existing H5 primer set (lanes 67 to 71) and the new H5N1 primer set (lanes primers were designed at conserved regions of the viral HA gene. this allows the detection of a broad range of isolates and variants of the H5N1 subtype. sensitivity of the assay was found to be less than 1 103 copies. copies per reaction, (lane 4) 1 107 copies per reaction, (lane 5) 1 106 copies per reaction, (lane 6) 1 105 copies per reaction, (lane 7) 1 104 copies per reaction, (lane 8) 1 103 copies per reaction, (lane 9) 1 102 copies per reaction, (lane 10) 10 copies per reaction, and (lane11) 1 copy per reaction. RNA extracted from healthy individual (lane 18) was also performed. a panel of avian and human subtypes (H1 to H16) of Influenza A virus was screened. results showed that there was reactivity only against the H5 subtypes with this primer set and no reactivity against the other subtypes. the matrix gene from these samples was amplified in parallel. detection could be due to different efficiencies in viral RNA recovery. allantoic fluid fractions have the highest efficiency for H5N1 RNA recovery and detection among the samples. two human archived RNA samples were tested positive. positive H5N1 RNA sample from in vitro-transcribed single-stranded RNA was used. the same set of RNA samples were tested against the matrix gene. the sensitivity of this H5N1 primer set was also evaluated against the currently recommended WHO H5 primer set. three different strains were used \u2013 one human archived RNA and two freshly extracted avian strains. a RNA dilution series was done on the three samples from 10-1 to 10-8. in all the three strains, the H5N1 primer set described here gave 1 to 2 logs better performance compared to the recommended WHO primer set. the 219 bp fragment amplified using the WHO H5 primer set was also performed in parallel as indicated. only three out of five samples were detected by the H5 primer set (lanes 67 to 71) and the new H5N1 primer set (lanes 73 to 77) authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions LFPN, IB, RSPT, ECR conceived the study, its design and coordination, and results analysis."}
