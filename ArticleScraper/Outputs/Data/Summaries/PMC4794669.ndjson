{"summary": "human syncytial virus (RSV) is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus whose genome of 15.2 kb contains 10 genes encoding a total of 11 proteins. they comprise three glycoproteins (F, G, and SH) inserted in the viral envelope, four proteins (N, P, L, and M2-1) associated with the ribonucleoprotein that are required for RNA synthesis, an additional protein (M) that forms the NS1 and NS2 proteins inhibit both IFN production and signaling. infected cells express high levels of ISGs, including ISG15 (20) ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like protein encoded by the interferon-stimulated gene 15. viruses have evolved mechanisms to counteract the ISG15 antiviral role. vaccinia virus E3 protein and influenza B virus NS1 protein bind ISG15. despite intensive research, neither a vaccine nor an effective antiviral therapy against RSV is currently available. hep-2 cell monolayers were infected with RSV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3 PFU per cell. cells were incubated with the viral inoculum in DMEM, 2% FBS (DMEM2) for 90 min at 37\u00b0C. after that time, the inoculum was removed and fresh DMEM2 was added. total RNA from mock-infected or infected cells was purified with the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) and was reverse transcribed with the High-Capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems) gene expression was measured by quantitative RT-PCR with a step one instrument. ISG15 (H150sc-50366; Santa Cruz), -actin (8224-100; Abcam), RSV phosphoprotein (67P), RSV fusion protein (67P), and RSV nucleoprotein (79N) were used as secondary antibodies. total RNA from A549 RSV-infected cells was reverse transcribed with the High-Capacity cDNA Archive kit. cell supernatants for viral titration and cell pellets for RNA and protein extraction were collected at different times postinfection. cell supernatants for viral titration and cell pellets were collected at different times postinfection. two clones of ISG15 knockout (ISG15/) cells were generated using the transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) technology. cells were transfected with purified plasmids Human-H36698_TALEN_L1 and Human-H36698_TALEN_R1. cells were trypsinized and cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well plates. human bronchial epithelial cells were obtained from normal tissue. samples were mock infected or infected with RSV at 7 106 PFU/cm2. RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and further purified. all the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. to generate viral stocks, the RSV Long strain was propagated in HEp-2 cells. the cells were purified from clarified culture supernatants by polyethylene glycol precipitation and centrifugation in a discontinuous sucrose gradient. e IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody (Abcam) and 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) were purified with the RNeasy minikit. total RNA from mock-infected or infected cells was purified with the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) and was reverse transcribed with the High-Capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems) primary antibodies for detection of the following proteins were used. ISG15 (H150sc-50366; Santa Cruz), -actin (8224-100; Abcam), RSV phosphoprotein (67P), RSV fusion protein (67P), and RSV nucleoprotein (79N) were visualized by chemiluminescence using a gel Logic 1500 Imaging System instrument (Kodak) o-ISG15-LRAA from pCMV6-Neo-ISG15 was performed by directed mutagenesis using the Phusion site-directed mutagenesis kit (Thermo Scientific) 5 104 cells were plated in each well of a 12-well plate and incubated for 60 h before transfection. the cells were then transfected with 1 g of purified plasmid (EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit; Qiagen) two clones of ISG15 knockout (ISG15/) A549 cells were generated using the transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) technology. this technology allows generation of knockout cells by using sequence-specific DNA-cleaving enzymes against specific target genes (51) cells were transfected as described above with purified plasmids Human-H36698_TALEN_L1 and Human-H36698_TALEN_R1. the cell supernatants were collected for virus titration at 48 h postinfection (hpi) bronchial epithelial cells were obtained from normal tissue and differentiated into multilayered epithelia. samples were mock infected or infected with RSV at 7 106 PFU/cm2, and cells were collected at different times postinfection. the increase started between 6 and 16 hpi, reaching the maximum level 48 hpi. a high correlation between ISG15 and nucleoprotein RNA expression was observed. arrowheads indicate treatment-specific ISGylation patterns. RSV nucleoprotein started to be detected 4 hpi and increased continuously until 48 hpi. the increase of free ISG15 conjugates was time dependent, becoming apparent 16 hpi. a decrease in viral titer was observed in IFN--treated cells compared with nontreated controls. however, an increase of 2.9 times in the virus titer was observed in the ISG15-silenced cells with respect to control cells. panels A and C represent the means and standard deviation from at least three independent experiments. the amounts of viral nucleoprotein and RNA were quantified at 24 and 48 hpi in control and ISG15-silenced cells previously stimulated with IFN-. two ISG15-knockout A549 cell lines (lanes 4 and 5) were generated by using TALENs. ISG15 expression was checked by Western blotting using specific antibodies. uncloned wild-type cells and two wild-type cell clones (lanes 2 and 3) were included as controls. SG15 induced by RSV infection had no antiviral effect. however, the antiviral effect was revealed when ISG15 was overexpressed. a549 cells were transfected either with a plasmid overexpressing ISG15 or with the same empty vector as a negative control and then infected with RSV. protein extracts from a representative experiment were collected at 24 and 48 hpi. the proteins were quantified, and normalization was carried out using an anti-actin antibody. the data represent the percentage of expression of RSV nucleoprotein RNA in ISG15-transfected cells. a significant decrease (3.9-fold) was found in the viral titer of cells overexpressing wild-type ISG15 compared with control cells transfected with the empty vector. however, no differences were found between these control cells and cells transfected with the nonconjugative ISG15 plasmid. untreated and IFN--treated A549 cells were transfected with either control siRNAs or specific UbE1L siRNAs prior to RSV infection. the cell supernatants were collected 48 hpi, and virus titers were determined by plaque assays. no differences were found between the UbE1L-silenced cells and control cells in the absence of IFN- stimulation. a significant increase (3.9-fold) in viral titer was observed in the UbE1L-silenced cells treated with IFN- compared with control cells (Fig. 5D, +IFN-). ISG15-, UbE1L-, and USP18-silenced cells were transfected with either control siRNAs or ISG15 (A), UbE1L (B) or USP18 (C) siRNAs and then infected with RSV. the results showed significant RNA reduction in the ISG15-overexpressing cells compared to control cells starting between 8 and 15 hpi. the anti-RSV activity of ISG15 affects a postentry stage of infection before virus release. cells were transfected with either an ISG15-overexpressing plasmid or a control plasmid. the data represent the percentages of expression of RSV nucleoprotein RNA in ISG15-transfected cells compared with cells transfected with a control plasmid (100%). ISG15 expression correlates with RSV infection in pseudostratified respiratory epithelia and in nasopharyngeal washes from infants. a preliminary step to investigate the role of ISG15 in the anti-RSV response in vivo was used for RSV infection. nasopharyngeal washes from 19 young infants infected with RSV were obtained at admission and discharge (solid circles) after RNA extraction, RSV nucleoprotein and ISG15 RNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR. SV infection of A549 cells enhances ISG15 expression and protein ISGylation. the data represent the fold increase of ISG15 RNA in infected cells compared with mock-infected cells. protein ISGylation patterns obtained after 48 h of RSV infection or IFN- stimulation were compared by Western blotting. results revealed common bands being labeled, but also specific bands appearing only in RSV-infected cells or IFN-stimulated cells were apparent. a549 cells were transfected with either control siRNAs or ISG15 siRNAs. the culture medium was replaced 4 h after transfection with fresh medium. the virus titer was determined by plaque assays. protein extracts from IFN--treated cells were collected 24 or 48 hpi. ISG15-silenced cells showed an increase in the amount of RSV nucleoprotein at 24 and 48 hpi compared with control cells. a significant increase in the amount of RSV nucleoprotein RNA was observed in ISG15-silenced cells compared with control cells at the same time postinfection. similar experiments were carried out at MOI of 0.3 and 30 in clones 3 (WT) and 5 (ISG15/) similar experiments were carried out at MOI of 0.3 and 30 in clones 3 (WT) and 5 (ISG15/) a significant reduction of the viral titer was observed in the ISG15-transfected cells compared with control transfected cells at 48 hpi. Western blotting analysis of four viral proteins revealed decreased accumulation in the ISG15-transfected cells. this decrease was observed at 24 and 48 hpi, with the most evident effect at 24 h. RNA was quantified by qRT-PCR at 24 and 48 hpi. the data represent the percentage of expression of RSV nucleoprotein RNA in ISG15-transfected cells compared with cells transfected with a control plasmid (100%). antiviral activity of ISG15 against RSV is due to protein ISGylation. cells were transfected with either control plasmid, a plasmid overexpressing ISG15, or a plasmid overexpressing nonconjugative ISG15 (ISG15-LRAA) and infected 24 h later with RSV at an MOI of 3. a second approach to inhibit the formation of ISG15 conjugates was knocking down the only identified E1 enzyme for ISG15, UbE1L (24) no differences were found between the UbE1L-silenced cells and control cells in the absence of IFN- stimulation. a slight increase in the expression of IFIT1 and RIG-I mRNAs was observed in cells silenced for ISG15, UbE1L, or USP18. in IFN--treated cells, USP18 silencing increased protein ISGylation, decreased RSV nucleoprotein accumulation and reduced virus titers. IFIT1 and RIG-I mRNAs were quantified by qRT-PCR at the indicated times postinfection in silenced cells. the data represent the means and standard deviations from three independent experiments. the titer in the culture supernatant or associated with cells was determined by plaque assay at 48 hpi. for cell-associated virus, cells were washed with DMEM2, scraped off into fresh DMEM2 and disaggregated by thorough pipetting and brief sonication in an ultrasonic bath. the virus in the clarified supernatant was titrated. differentiated cultures from six donors were infected. the viral yield and ISG15 expression were quantified by qRT-PCR. a high positive correlation between viral infection and the ISG15 expression level was observed. RNA extraction, RSV nucleoprotein and ISG15 RNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR. similar to the pseudostratified epithelia, a high positive correlation was observed between RSV nucleoprotein and ISG15 expression. this suggests that ISG15 may play an antiviral role after natural infection. it has been claimed that ISG15 exerts its antiviral activity by conjugation to either viral or cellular proteins. it is possible that the ISG15 anti-RSV activity is mediated by direct ISGylation of viral and/or cellular proteins essential for virus replication. vaccinia virus E3 or influenza B virus NS1 proteins antagonize its antiviral effect. the same reasoning would apply if an RSV protein antagonizes any enzymes involved in ISGylation instead of ISG15 directly. the lack of ISG15 would destabilize USP18, leading to an increased response to type I IFN and viral resistance. ISG15 and UbE1L silencing had no effect on USP18 stabilization (55) but increased virus titers in IFN--treated cells. both increased RSV replication (Fig. 2A and 5D) while ISG15 and UbE1L silencing had opposite effects on RSV titers. positive correlation between RSV infection and ISG15 expression in human pseudostratified epithelia and in nasopharyngeal washes from infected children point to a role in RSV infections in vivo. in this setting, uninfected respiratory epithelial cells might acquire an antiviral status, which includes high levels of ISG15. in this scenario, ISG15 would play an important role in hindering RSV dissemination. to monitor RSV-induced inflammation, it is important to stress that ISG15 levels decreased between admission and discharge for every infant, reflecting the reduction in virus load and inflammation. in addition, data from nasopharyngeal washes from infants infected with RSV suggest that ISG15 may play an important role in RSV infection in vivo."}
