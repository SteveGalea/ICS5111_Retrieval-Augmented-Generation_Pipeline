{"summary": "106 air samples collected from 30 ambulances before patient services. 212 air samples collected during patient services to assess bacterial and fungal counts at the two time points. bacterial and fungal counts in ambulance air showed a significantly positive correlation with the bacterial surface contamination on medical instruments. further studies should be conducted to determine the optimal intervention to reduce microbial contamination in the ambulance environment. a cross-sectional study of 30 ambulance runs was conducted to assess microbial air quality (total bacterial and fungal counts) and bacterial surface contamination on medical instruments and surrounding areas. the study was performed over a two-month period. air, 120 air samples (60 for bacterial counts and 60 for fungal counts) were included. air samples for bacteria were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 hours. those for fungi were incubated at room temperature for five days. the correlation between bacterial and fungal counts in air samples was analyzed using paired t-test or proportional Z test. the significance level was set at p0.050. the mean bacterial and fungal counts during patient services were significantly higher than those of bacterial and fungal counts at the start of the runs, p=0.005 and p=0.030. the data are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Distribution of microbial counts (cfu/m3) of air samples collected from 30 studied ambulance runs. 17.0% of air samples collected at the start of ambulance runs (9/53 samples) and 26.4% of samples collected during patient services had bacterial counts more than the recommended level (>500cfu/m3) both bacterial and fungal counts in air samples collected during patient services showed significantly higher percentages of high levels than those of air samples at the start of ambulance runs. the distribution of genus or groups of isolated bacteria and fungi from in-ambulance air was similar proportion with that from outdoor air. the majority (81\u201386%) were Staphylococcus aure. the meanSD of overall bacterial surface counts before and after patient services was 0.80.7cfu/cm2 and 1.31.1cfu/cm2 respectively, respectively, p0.001. however, no surface swab samples had bacterial counts more than the recommended count (5cfu/cm2) bacterial and fungal counts in ambulance air revealed a significantly positive correlation with the bacterial surface contamination on medical instruments and allocated areas. surface swab counts on medical instruments and surrounding areas were significantly higher than those before patient services. study in german ambulances found methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) contamination in 18 sampling surfaces of 11 ambulances out of a total 150 studied ambulances. a preliminary investigation in Welsh ambulances found that most sites within ambulances were contaminated with several species of bacteria before cleaning. air-conditioned buses with open exhaust ventilation fans had significantly lower bacterial and fungal counts than those without open exhaust ventilation fans. most isolated bacterial colonies from air samples were Staphylococcus spp., and most of the majority (81.6%) were Staphylococcus aureus. studies on the application of ATP-activity for monitoring microbial loads in environmental samples were evaluated. the intervention program should emphasize the need for a ventilation improvement strategy, and improvement in the cleaning program of the ambulance environment. the use of standard precautions, including hand hygiene, will prevent cross infection and save ambulance personnel\u2019s lives."}
