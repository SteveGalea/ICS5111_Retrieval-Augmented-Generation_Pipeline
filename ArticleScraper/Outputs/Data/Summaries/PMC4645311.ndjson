{"summary": "the subfamily Coronavirinae contains four genera called Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronavirus. mammals are predominantly infected by alpha- and betacoronaviruses. gamma- and deltacoronaviruses mainly infect avian hosts (1, 2). four human coronaviruses (HCoVs) circulate in the human population. the evolutionary origins of HCoV-229E are uncertain. a lack of specimens containing high CoV RNA concentrations has so far prevented a more comprehensive characterization of those bat viruses. a lack of specimens containing high CoV RNA concentrations has so far prevented a more comprehensive characterization of those bat viruses. bats were caught in the Ashanti region, central Ghana, during 2009 to 2011 as described previously (21) Archived anonymized respiratory specimens derived from patients sampled between 2002 and 2011 were obtained from Hong Kong/China, Germany, The Netherlands, Brazil, and Ghana. RNA purified from approximately 20 mg of fecal material suspended in 500 l RNAlater stabilizing solution. coV quantification relied on cRNA in vitro transcripts generated from TA-cloned periamplicons using the T7-driven MEGAscript (Life Technologies, Heidelberg, Germany) kit. partial RdRp gene sequences from real-time RT-PCR-positive specimens were obtained as described previously (34). related bat coronavirus and HCoV-229E sequences determined in this study were submitted to GenBank under accession numbers KT253259 to KT253323. Archived anonymized respiratory specimens derived from patients sampled between 2002 and 2011 were obtained from Hong Kong/China, Germany, The Netherlands, Brazil, and Ghana. RNA purification, coronavirus detection, and characterization. cRNA in vitro transcripts generated from TA-cloned periamplicons were obtained as described previously (34) full coV genomes and spike gene sequences were generated for those specimens containing the highest CoV RNA concentrations using sets of nested RT-PCR assays. sequence islets were connected by bridging long-range nested PCR using strain-specific primers. RESULTS Specimens from 2,087 bats belonging to 11 species were available for PCR testing. only bats belonging to the family Hipposideridae tested positive in 81 of 1,853 specimens (4.4%). the 816-nt RdRp gene fragment was sequenced from 23 HCoV-229E strains from patients sampled between 2002 and 2011. in analogy to the official taxonomic designation SARS-related CoV, including human SARS-CoV and related CoVs from other animals, we here restrict usage of the term HCoV-229E to the human virus. the HCoV-229E data set used for comparison was sampled over 50 years. the human-associated viruses showed 5- to 10-fold less genetic diversity than bat viruses. the neighbor-joining phylogeny shown in Fig. 1B represents the high sequence identity between all HCoV-229E strains. the novel bat 229E-related CoVs are shown in boldface and red. Branches leading to the outgroup were truncated for graphical reasons. values at nodes show support of grouping from posterior probabilities. the two other bat viruses were less related to HCoV-229E. the patristic distance within HCoV-229E was 5.5% on the amino acid level. topologies of the Bayesian phylogenetic reconstructions of RdRp and spike genes from bats and the alpaca were not congruent. all bat 229E-related CoVs and HCoV-229E form a single species. the amino acid sequence of the partial RdRp gene of Kwamang8 differed by only 3.3% from those of other bat viruses and HCoV-229E. this CoV species would also include the recently described alpaca 229E-related CoV (32) KW2E-F56 First to last amino acid Protein size (amino acids) First to last amino acid Protein size (amino acids) First to last amino acid Protein size (amino acids) NSP1 Met1\u2013Gly111 111 Met1\u2013Gly111 111 Met1\u2013Gly111 111 Met1\u2013Gly109 109 NSP2 Asn112\u2013Gly897 786 Asn112\u2013Gly897 786 Asn110\u2013Gly89 109 Asn3832\u2013Gln3940 109 Asn3830\u2013Gln3938 109 NSP10 Ala3944\u2013Gln4078 135 Ala3941\u2013Gln4075 135 Ala3939\u2013Gln4073 135 NSP11 Ser4079\u2013Glu4097 19 Ser4079\u2013Glu4094 19 NSP12 Ser4079\u2013Gln5005 927 Ser4079\u2013Gln5005 927 Ser4076\u2013 alpaca CoV vs bat 229Ec KW2E-F56 AT1A-F1 KW2-F151 F01A-F2 ADRP 75.6\u2013100 75\u201375.6 91.1\u201392.9 84.5\u201385.1 84.5\u201385.1 76.8\u201390.5 NSP5 (3CLpro) 90.7\u2013100 90.4\u201390.7 97.4\u201397.7 96.4\u201396.7 97.4\u201397.7 90.4\u201397.4 N c Including bat CoV KW2E-F56, AT1A-F1, KW2E-F151, and F01A-F2. all seven open reading frames (ORFs) known from HCoV-229E were found in bat 229E-related CoVs in the sequence ORF1a/1b-spike-ORF4-envelope-membrane-nucleocapsid.

Branches leading the outgroup HCoV-NL63 were truncated for graphical reasons. the HCoV-220E inf-1 strain was used with animal 229E-related viruses as indicated. the extended ORF4 of the alpaca 229E-related CoV would be most closely related to bat viruses from lineage 1 with 5.5% amino acid sequence distance, compared to at least 8.8% distance from HCoV-229E strains. the second difference was a considerably longer S1 portion of the bat 229E-related CoV spike genes compared to HCoV-229E. no ORF in the 3\u2032-terminal genome region is known from HCoV-229E. the putative TRS context preceding ORF8 was conserved in all bat 229E-related CoVs and in the alpaca 229E-related CoV. this was supported by the existence of a conserved octanucleotide sequence. bioinformatic analyses provided evidence for the presence of two transmembrane domains in the predicted proteins 8 of the alpaca and the genetically related bat 229E-related viruses. this may imply a role of the predicted protein 8 in coronaviral interactions with cellular or viral membranes. only the central parts of these ORFs contained a stretch of 46 more conserved amino acid residues showing up to 39.1% sequence identity and 47.8% similarity (Blosum62 matrix). the origin and function of the divergent ORF8 thus remain to be determined. spike deletion in HCoV-229E compared to ancestral bat viruses is thus noteworthy. deletions in this protein have been associated with changes in coronaviral tissue tropism. one could hypothesize that adaptation of bat 229E-related CoV lineage 1 both to nonchiropteran hosts and to respiratory transmission may have been easier than for other bat 229E-related CoV lineages. the virus-host association between 229E-related CoVs and the bat genus Hipposideros is strengthened by our virus detections in Hipposideros species in Ghana and in Gabon. the observed link between 229E-related alphacoronaviruses and hipposiderid bats is parallel by the detections of genetically closely related betacoronaviruses in different Hipposideros species from Ghana, Nigeria, Thailand, and Gabon. alpaca 229E-related CoV was reported only from captive animals in the united states. the apparent intraspike recombination event may speak against a role of the alpaca virus as the direct ancestor of HCoV-229E. a hypothetical direct transfer of old world bat viruses to new world alpacas appears to be geographically unfeasible. alpaca 229E-related CoV and HCoV-229E represent two independent zoonotic acquisitions from 229E-related CoVs existing in hipposiderid bats. the most closely related bat 229E-related CoV lineage showed 8.4% amino acid sequence distance in the translated spike gene from HCoV-229E. this was comparable to 7.8 to 18.6% amino acid distance between FIPV, TGEV and canine CoV. the other bat 229E-related lineages and HCoV-229E were comparable to the distance between HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E. the other bat 229E-related lineages may form different serotypes. lack of bat sera and absence of bat 229E-related CoV isolates prevented serological investigations."}
