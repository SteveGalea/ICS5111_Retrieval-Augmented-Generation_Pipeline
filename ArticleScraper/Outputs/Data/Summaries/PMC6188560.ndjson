{"summary": "gene overlap occurs when two or more genes share the same region of a nucleotide sequence in a genome. this occurs frequently in viruses, especially those with RNA genomes. this occurs frequently in bacteria and in eukaryotes including humans. 174 overlapping genes exceeded the length of the genome (Barrell et al. 1976). overlapping genes still largely relies on laboratory methods that isolate, sequence, and align individual proteins to reference genomes. overlapping genes are costly and time intensive, making large scale screening and identification of overlapping genes expensive. the method estimates the theoretical expected length of ORFs before a stop codon is reached in all reading frames within an established gene. overlapping ORFs with functional benefit will result in negative selection against nucleotide substitutions that introduce stop codons within that gene. codons that preserve the original amino acid sequence are randomly generated and the length of ORFs on alternative reading frames measured for each permutation. the third test requires both the codon permutation test and the synonymous mutation test P values to be below some cut-off value. the actual ORF lengths on frames +1 and +2 on the unpermuted I870_gp2 gene are represented by black dots on top of the theoretical distribution. for frame +1, we observe 37 ORFs, all of which have lengths within expected ranges. codon permutation, synonymous mutation and combined test all rely on detecting overlapping ORFs that are larger than expected by random chance. the sensitivity and false discovery rate of these tests will depend on how much of a gene is overlapping (denoted as overlap length) the three test (codon permutation, synonymous mutation, and combined) have similar sensitivities for P value cut-offs between 0.001 and 0.10. the synonymous mutation generally has the highest sensitivity, followed by the codon permutation test and then the combined test (fig. 3, Table 1). sensitivities are generally insufficient when the overlapping length is below 50 nucleotides in length (17 codons), but improve considerably as the overlapping length increases above 50 nucleotides our method requires only a single sequence to robustly detect overlapping genes. this validation consists of 21 gene overlaps with a minimum overlap length of 108 nucleotides. the results are in agreement with previous sensitivity estimates. combined approach will have 50% sensitivity for overlaps of at least 100 nucleotides when a P value cut-off of 0.01 is used. comparison of the codon permutation, synonymous mutation and combined methods to Synplot2 for the Synplot2 validation data set.

Bovine Respirovirus Virus 3 A 173 codon long ORF was detected within the phosphoprotein P coding gene of Bovine respirovirus virus 3 (single-stranded negative-sense RNA virus, family Paramyxoviridae) the 26th codon in this ORF is a methionine (a common start codon) suggesting that a large component of the 708 codons may be transcribed. these ORFs had lengths 105, 91, and 87 codons, and were in frames +1, +2, and c2 respectively. this suggests that the reference gene may be entirely located within the ORFs discovered by this method. the method assumes functional ORFs are longer than expected by random chance. the combined test is advantageous as true positives are readily detected by both tests, so the constraint of requiring both tests to detect the ORF does not impact the sensitivity. however, the combined test does substantially reduce the false positives rate, as false positives detected by one test are frequently excluded by the other. antisense ORF in a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus from the family Flaviviridae is the exceptionally long (708 codons) antisense ORF in a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. this suggests that this virus may employ a novel method of transcription and clearly merits further investigation. the detection of 17 antisense ORFs is notable. a 96 aa overlapping antisense hypothetical protein in -ssRNA (-ssRNA) and a possible 167 aa overlapping antisense ORF called \u201cNEG8\u201d in human influenza A virus. a further frameshift of 1 nucleotide would make ORFs of such lengths much more likely. synonymous mutations in frame +0 impact reverse complementary frame (specifically frame c2) much less than other reading frames. codon permutation test could be used in isolation when specifically screening for antisense ORFs. 20,000 new coding sequences were created by either randomly permuting codons in frame +0 or for each amino acid in reading frame +0. lengths of ORFs over all 20,000 randomly generated coding sequences were pooled to calculate a theoretical distribution of the length of ORFs. the original unpermuted coding sequence calculates the probability of observing a length as large or larger by random chance alone. the value 1 C(L) has an interpretation similar to that of a P value testing whether or not the length L is sampled from the theoretical distribution of lengths calculated earlier. this adjustment is analogous to a Bonferroni adjustment of P values. sensitivity is measured as the proportion of known overlapping genes within the downloaded reference genomes that are detected using our method. an ORF identified with our method was considered a true positive if it was located on the same reading frame and overlapped with a gene already annotated. alignments were filtered to include only alignments with similarity 90% and length 90% of the corresponding ORF sequence. a score of 0 indicates no similarity between lineages while a score of 1 indicates both sequences have the same NCBI lineage. +c0, +c1 or +c2 are a frameshift of 0, 1 or 2 nucleotides, respectively, on the complement and reversed coding sequence (5\u2032 to 3\u2032 transcription). c0, c1 or \u2013c2 are considered the only viable reading frames as transcription on these frames occur in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction. the value 1 C(L) has an interpretation similar to that of a P value testing whether or not the length L is sampled from the theoretical distribution of lengths calculated earlier. small P values for an ORF are interpreted as evidence that the ORF in question is larger than expected by random chance alone. sensitivity is measured as the proportion of known overlapping genes within the downloaded reference genomes that are detected using our method. an ORF identified with our method was considered a true positive if it was located on the same reading frame and overlapped with a gene already annotated. taxmax.py was developed to compare the NCBI lineage from each ORF and its aligned sequence. a score of 0 indicates no similarity between lineages while a score of 1 indicates both sequences have the same NCBI lineage."}
