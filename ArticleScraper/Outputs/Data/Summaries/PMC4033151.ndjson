{"summary": "enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of the pathogens associated with hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) it was responsible for large HFMD outbreaks in Taiwan (1.5 million cases) and Malaysia (Sarawak, 2628 cases) vsicular lesions usually occur on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, but all parts of the limbs, including groins and buttocks may be affected. there is clinical overlap with herpangina, an illness characterised by high fever, sore throat and oral ulceration. transmission is thought to occur primarily through the faecal-oral route. virus has also been detected in respiratory secretions and skin lesions. initial viral replication is presumed to occur in lymphoid tissues of the oropharyngeal cavity (tonsils) and small bowel (Peyer's patches), giving rise to mild viraemia. children aged less than 6 months had the highest risk for severe and fatal disease. of the 1.1% that had neurological or cardiopulmonary complications, 3% died. humans are the only known hosts for HFMD associated EV infections. reticuloendothelial system (liver, spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes), skin and mucous membranes coincide with the onset of clinical symptoms. patients with central nervous system involvement typically present with features of brainstem encephalitis, including myoclonus and autonomic dysregulation. a small proportion of these patients may progress to develop cardiopulmonary failure, which may be fatal. many countries have experienced large outbreaks (Taiwan, China, Vietnam) have developed their own guidelines. most describe a staging system with uncomplicated febrile HFMD designated as Grade 1, high or prolonged fever and/or neurological manifestations such as myoclonus, aseptic meningitis or encephalitis designated as Grade 2. placebo controlled trial of magnesium sulfate in children with autonomic dysfunction is in progress in Vietnam to address the potential benefit of this cheap, accessible therapy. outbreak control measures are targeted at interrupting virus transmission from person to person, as well as through contact with contaminated surfaces. EV71 HFMD outbreaks have not spread beyond south-east Asia. monitoring viral genetic and antigenic evolution, cross protection and waning of immunity will inform vaccine development and implementation. EV71 and HFMD will continue to be a serious public health issue in south-east Asia."}
