{"summary": "canine coronavirus (CCoV) was first recognized as a pathogen of dogs in 1971. CCoV is a member of the family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae, genus Alphacoronavirus, species Alphacoronavirus-1 (2). infection with CCoV is common in young dogs, particularly those housed in large groups, such as in kennels, shelters, and breeding facilities (3\u20137) CCoV-II viruses use aminopeptidase N (APN) as the receptor (25) CCoV-II viruses are classified into at least two subtypes, namely CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb. CCoV-IIa viruses exist as two biotypes that differ in pathogenicity and tissue tropism. CCoV-IIb spike gene has a TGEV-like NTD (15, 30), and causes enteritis in neonatal animals. a third CCoV-II variant with a CCoV-I NTD has been reported in both the united states and Sweden. all cases were processed for complete necropsy, including the collection of multiple segments of gastrointestinal tract. bacteriological culture of intestinal specimens, including CCoV, group A rotavirus, and canine parvovirus were performed on all cases. dogs with respiratory signs or lesions were examined for the presence of canine distemper virus. ten percent tissue pools of lung, liver, spleen, and intestine from puppy 2 were prepared in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 10 g/ml ciprofloxacin. supernatants from puppy 8 were inoculated onto monolayers of canine fibroblast-like A-72 cells. supernatant from puppy 8 was inoculated onto immortalized canine kidney cells. the extract was allowed to remain on the monolayer for 1 to 2 h. cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in MEM-E containing 10% gamma-irradiated fetal bovine serum. at 5- to 7-day intervals, monolayers were disrupted with trypsin. new monolayers established at a 1:3 split ratio. PCR was performed using platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers' instructions. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. the products of the RT-PCR assays were sequenced by using the Sanger dideoxy sequencing method. the CCoV RNA extracted from clinical samples was classified as CCoV-I or CCoV-II based on RT-PCR and sequencing of the spike S1/S2 and S2\u2032 cleavage sites. nucleotide sequences of CCoV spike genes have been deposited in the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Archives. the partial nucleotide sequences of CCoV spike genes have been deposited in the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Archives under the accession numbers LN624642 to LN624663. dogs with respiratory signs or lesions were examined for the presence of canine distemper virus, canine parainfluenza virus, and canine adenovirus. sections of brain, thymus, heart, trachea, lungs, liver, gallbladder, tongue, stomach, pancreas, small and large intestines, mesenteric lymph node, spleen, kidneys, adrenal glands, urinary bladder, skeletal muscles, and bone ten percent tissue pools of lung, liver, spleen, and intestine from puppy 2 were prepared in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM-E) supernatants from puppies 2, 4a, and 4b were inoculated onto monolayers of canine fibroblast-like A-72 cells. supernatant from puppy 8 was inoculated onto immortalized canine kidney cells. RNA was extracted from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues. RT reaction was primed with random hexamers. PCR was directed to a conserved region of the 3\u2032 untranslated region. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. products of the expected size were purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit. the products of the RT-PCR assays were sequenced by using the Sanger dideoxy sequencing method. the CCoV RNA extracted from clinical samples was classified as CCoV-I or CCoV-II based on RT-PCR and sequencing of the spike S1/S2 and S2\u2032 cleavage sites. PCR-amplified CCoV gene-specific sequences were performed on the N terminus of the S gene using Clustal X (Conway Institute, UCD, Dublin, Ireland) Neighbor-joining trees were constructed in Clustal X using 10,000 bootstrap trials and viewed in FigTree v1.4.0. puppy with 4-day history of vomiting and diarrhea died during surgery for jejunoileal intussusception. 1 littermate with intussusception and 2 others ill 4a 09-107207 KS Maltese 8 weeks Distributor with 800 puppies with history of respiratory signs, vomiting, and diarrhea. 100 puppies with 20% mortality when 6 to 8 weeks old 6b 10-51534B Mixed 8 weeks 1 to multiple puppies per litter died within 3\u20134 days of showing anorexia, vomiting, infection with CCoV extended from the villus-crypt junction to the tip of villi diffusely along the small intestine in puppies 5, 7, 8, and 9. only puppies 8 and 9 showed CCoV antigen within epithelial cells along the surface and crypts of the colon. none of the 10 puppies where lymphoid tissues were examined by IHC showed positive staining for the presence of CCoV antigen. fecal samples confirmed the presence of Isospora species and Cystoisospora ohioensis in puppies 2 and 5 respectively. the small intestine of puppy 2 also showed multifocal crypt ectasia. a finding associated with protein-losing enteropathy in this breed of dogs. rosis in puppies 8 and 9 were considered incidental findings. none of the lung sections taken from the remaining 10 puppies were positive for the presence of CCoV antigen by IHC staining. lung AEEC, bronchopneumonia, bone marrow depletion, thymic, MLN and peyer's patch lymphoid depletion 7 12-120628 Pos.

Neg. Neg.: lung, MLN Trichomoniasis, bronchointerstitial pneumonia 5 09-123567 Pos. Neg. Neg.: thymus, lung, stomach, pancreas AEEC, aspiration pneumonia, bone marrow depletion, thymic and MLN villus epithelial cells are diffusely disorganized, attenuated, and low cuboidal (arrows) the space between the epithelial cells and the lamina propria is an artifact of processing (hematoxylin and eosin stain; bar, 100 m). CCoV was isolated from puppy 4b, and canine parvovirus was isolated from puppy 4a. CCoV-infected cell culture monolayer (A) and CCoV-infected cell culture monolayer (B) characterized by rounding and death of individual cells (B) RT-PCR, genotyping, and comparative sequence analysis revealed CCoV-II in all 9 cases. the CCoV-IIb from puppy 9 clustered with CCoV-IIb from the EU. the reference CCoVs are: CB/05, pantropic CCoV-IIa (AAZ91437.1); 1-71, enteric CCoV-IIa. c Basic residues suspected to be important for cleavage activation of the spike protein are in boldface. c ND, not determined. NA, not applicable. previous work on pantropic CCoV has relied mainly on RT-PCR. replication or infection is present in individual tissues cannot be conclusively confirmed by this method alone. previous reports with FCoV have confirmed viral RNA by RT-PCR in tissues obtained from otherwise healthy cats (41) viremia is associated with low-level virus replication within tissues of healthy animals. lymphoid depletion of the thymus, mesenteric lymph nodes, or intestinal Peyer's patches was present in eight out of 10 puppies that had lymphoid tissues available. similar lymphoid depletion was found in two puppies with fatal CCoV-associated enteritis previously described in the united states. the clinical significance of intestinal infection with AEEC in four puppies is unclear. however, the presence of small intestinal epithelial colonization by these organisms likely contributed to clinical signs of intestinal dysfunction. the pathogenesis of intestinal intussusception associated with enteric viral infection is not well understood. however, in human infants, intestinal intussusception has been associated with adenovirus and enterovirus infections as well as vaccination with a discontinued live-attenuated rotavirus tetravalent vaccine (50\u201352) CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb could cause morbidity and mortality in puppies. CCoVs should be considered a differential diagnosis and specifically sought in outbreaks of severe enteritis."}
