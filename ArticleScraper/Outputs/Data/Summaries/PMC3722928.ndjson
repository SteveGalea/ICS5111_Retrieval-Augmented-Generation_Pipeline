{"summary": "the direct lung injury type of ARDS was reported to occur during infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus 3 or the highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 virus 4,5. the serum levels of interferon (IFN)-, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- and interleukin (IL)-6 were elevated in fatal human influenza infections 7. high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) also has potent proinflammatory properties. exposure of neutrophils or macrophages to HMGB1 induces nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) and enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines. HMGB1 has been proposed recently to be one of the late mediators in LPS-induced sepsis lethality 17\u201320. Treg cells exert suppressive effects in an increasing array of pathophysiological events 29,30, including regulation of immune responses in some inflammatory conditions 31\u201333. we hypothesized that HMGB1 was involved in the inflammatory response and clinical course in ARDS mice. all mice used in the experiments were 7\u20138 weeks of age. all experimental protocols described in the present study were approved by the ethics review committee for animal experimentation of tohoku university. mice were administered rTM at a dose of 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally every 12 h, beginning 12 h before LPS injection. the lung specimens obtained from mice were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. sections were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) mice were deparaffinized and rehydrated after paraffin-embedded blocks had been cut into 5-m sections. high-temperature antigen retrieval involved boiling the slides in citrate buffer (10 mM per litre, pH 60) for 5 min followed by blocking with 2% rabbit serum. the lungs were homogenized and centrifuged at 450 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. the supernatants were stored at 80\u00b0C until cytokines were measured. each cell pellet was re-suspended in 4 ml of 40% percoll. cells were stained using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD4 (clone GK1.5; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and Pacific Blue-conjugated CD25 (clone PC61; BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), then stained with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated FoxP3 mAb (clone FJK-16S; cells using forward- (FSC) and side-scatter (SSC) parameters were measured. detection limits were 15 pg/ml and 5 pg/ml. mice were bred in a pathogen-free environment at the institute for animal experimentation. all mice used were 7\u20138 weeks of age. all experimental protocols described in the present study were approved by the Ethics Review Committee for animal experimentation of tohoku university. treatment with rTM rTM was provided by asahi Kasei Pharma (Chiba, Japan) mice were administered rTM at a dose of 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally every 12 h, beginning 12 h before LPS injection. the time\u2013course of rTM administration is illustrated in Fig. S1. lung tissues from -GalCer/LPS-treated mice were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. paraffin-embedded blocks had been cut into 5-m sections and mounted onto slides. high-temperature antigen retrieval involved boiling the slides in citrate buffer (10 mM per litre, pH 60) followed by blocking with 2% rabbit serum. lung homogenates were killed at various intervals after LPS exposure. their chests were opened, their tracheae were cannulated and 1 ml of PBS was infused intratracheally and withdrawn. this procedure was performed three times. cells were stained using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD4 (clone GK1.5; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and Pacific Blue-conjugated CD25 (clone PC61; BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) after centrifugation at 450 g for 20 min at room temperature, the cells at the interface were collected, washed three times and counted using the stained cells were analysed using a flow cytometer (FACS Canto II; BD Biosciences) data were collected from 30 000 individual cells using forward- (FSC) and side-scatter (SSC) parameters to limit the lymphocyte population. HMGB1 secretion in lungs was increased threefold at 6 h and sixfold at 12 h in mice treated with -GalCer/LPS. dPBS/LPS-treated mice showed a gradual increase in the HMGB1 levels at 6, 12 and 24 h. in dPBS/LPS-treated mice, the HMGB1 levels were increased at 6 h at an equivalent level to those in -GalCer/LPS-treated HMGB1 concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids was measured at 0, 6, 12 and 24 h after treatment with LPS or PBS. the data are shown as the median and interquartiles and each dot represents an individual mouse. HMGB1 expression was detected in the cytoplasm of neutrophils and macrophages infiltrating into alveolar spaces and intra-alveolar septa. in contrast, HMGB1 was stained positively in the bronchial and alveolar epithelial cell nuclei in -GalCer/LPS-treated mice. this results suggest that neutrophils and macrophages accumulating at the inflammatory sites may contribute to the secretion of HM dPBS/LPS-treated mice showed similar TNF- production kinetics in the BAL fluid and lung homogenate. rTM administration at a dose of 10 mg/kg, but not 3 mg/kg, increased the survival of -GalCer/LPS-treated mice significantly compared to those that received PBS treatment. mice were treated intraperitoneally with 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg rTM or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) every 12 h, beginning 12 h before LPS administration. each group consists of five mice. rTM treatment did not show any significant effect on the production of IFN- and TNF- in the BAL fluids and lung homogenates at 6, 12 and 24 h after LPS treatment. this results suggest that rTM attenuated the development of severe ARDS in a different manner than by suppressing IFN- and TNF-. bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids (pg/mg protein) and lung homogenates (pg/ml) were measured at 6, 12 and 24 h after LPS treatment. each value represents the median (interquartile range) of four or five mice. administration of rTM resulted in a significant increase in Treg cells in the lung lymphocytes from -GalCer/LPS-treated mice compared to those from dPBS/LPS-treated mice. results suggest recovery of reduced Treg cells in the lungs of severe ARDS mice may be related to the beneficial effect of rTM treatment. dPBS/LPS/PBS treated with PBS in dPBS/LPS-treated mice. galCer/LPS/rTM treated with rTM in -GalCer/LPS-treated mice. rTM administration increased the level of these cytokines significantly in the lung homogenates from -GalCer/LPS-treated mice compared to that of those receiving PBS. HMGB1 secretion kinetics in severe ARDS mice. dPBS/LPS-treated mice showed a gradual increase in HMGB1 levels. dPBS/LPS-treated mice showed a gradual increase in HMGB1 levels. mice received intratracheal administration of -galactosylceramide (-GalCer) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 24 h after administration of -galactosylceramide (-GalCer) or DMSO-containing phosphate-buffered saline (dPBS) via the same route. the HMGB1 concentration in the BAL fluids was measured at 0, 6, 12 and 24 lung homogenates were measured at 0, 6, 12 and 24 h after treatment with LPS or PBS. the data are shown as the median and interquartiles and each dot represents an individual mouse. an immunohistochemical analysis was performed on the lung sections from -GalCer/LPS-treated mice that received LPS after 12 h. dPBS/LPS-treated mice showed similar TNF- production kinetics in the BAL fluid and lung homogenate. rTM administration at a dose of 10 mg/kg, but not 3 mg/kg, increased the survival of -GalCer/LPS-treated mice significantly compared to those receiving PBS treatment. rTM-treated mice were treated intraperitoneally with 3 mg/kg rTM or 10 mg/kg rTM or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) every 12 h, beginning 12 h before LPS administration. rTM effectively inhibited the development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) effects of rTM on IFN- and TNF- production in severe ARDS mice. rTM treatment did not show any significant effect on the production of IFN- and TNF- in the BAL fluids and lung homogenates at 6, 12 and 24 h after LPS treatment. bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids (pg/mg protein) and lung homogenates (pg/ml) were measured at 6, 12 and 24 h after LPS treatment. each value represents the median (interquartile range) of four or five mice. the proportion of Treg cells was significantly lower in the lung lymphocytes from -GalCer/LPS-treated mice than in those from dPBS/LPS-treated mice. in addition, administration of rTM resulted in a significant increase in Treg cells in the lung lymphocytes from -GalCer/LPS-treated mice compared to those that received PBS. these results suggest that recovery of the reduced Treg cells in the lungs of severe ARDS grey, isotype-matched control immunoglobulin (Ig)G; black, anti-FoxP3 mAb. dPBS/LPS/PBS, treated with PBS in dPBS/LPS-treated mice. galCer/LPS/rTM, treated with rTM in -GalCer/LPS-treated mice. HMGB1 level in BAL fluids began to increase at 6 h and peaked at 12 h after exposure to LPS in ARDS mice. the HMGB1 level was higher in ARDS mice than that in ALI mice. HMGB1 levels in BAL fluids were higher in ARDS mice than in mice with ALI caused by LPS alone. NK T cells rapidly produce a large amount of IFN- 39\u201341. this suggests that robust secretion of HMGB1 may contribute to the severe lung injury and fatal outcome. HMGB1 is present in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of alveolar macrophages in mice with severe ARDS caused by -GalCer/LPS treatment. rTM is known to bind HMGB1 at an N-terminal lectin-like domain and suppress the inflammatory response 24. rTM reduced serum IL-1 and TNF- levels in a mouse model of ARDS-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome. this treatment did not affect the production of IFN- and TNF-. this played a critical role during the development of severe lung injury in our model 13. IL-10 and TGF- possess potent regulatory activities in the immune and inflammatory responses 37,38. these cytokines have been reported to play a critical role in the suppression of inflammation and immune responses mediated by Treg cells 44\u201346. results suggest that rTM may exert beneficial effects against the development of severe lung injury. mice received intraracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 24 h after administration of -galactosylceramide (-GalCer) or 04% dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO)-containing phosphate-buffered saline (dPBS) via the same route."}
