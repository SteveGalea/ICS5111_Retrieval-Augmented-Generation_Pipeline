{"summary": "background mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) is a betaretrovirus that infects rodent cells. it uses mouse tranferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) for cell entry. there have been reports that the continued passage of MMTV in heterologous cell lines gives rise to novel variants that can infect naive non-murine cells with higher efficiency than the parental virus. our data explain the mechanism enabling MMTV to form \u2018host-range variants\u2019 in non-murine cells that has been known for a long time. our findings may expand our understanding of how viruses gain capability to cross species-specific barriers to infect new hosts."}
