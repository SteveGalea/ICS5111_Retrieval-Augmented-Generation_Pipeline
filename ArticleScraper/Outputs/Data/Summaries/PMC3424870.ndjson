{"summary": "swine flu pneumonia cases of varying severity have been reported from many parts of the world during the last epidemic. since the first report of pneumonia caused by the H1N1 virus in Mexico, several severe cases have been found throughout the world. swine flu pneumonia has developed interstitial lung disease (ILD) during recovery. RT-PCR was done with a kit (Qiagen kit, Hildane, Germany) the patient was diagnosed as a case of H1N1 community acquired pneumonia. she was put on empirical antibiotics, oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily for 15 days) and oxygen supplementation. eruginosa was discharged on the 64th day of admission. the patient was put on the synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation. the ICD was also removed and tracheostomy was closed. a chest X-ray showed bilateral lower zone reticulonodular shadows. the dominant picture was reticulonodular shadowing. there were areas of honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis. findings remained unchanged even in a prone position. a new tab HRCT on follow up after 2 years in supine (a) and prone (b) position shows ground glass opacities, interstitial fibrosis and traction bronchectasis in bilateral lung fields. the opacities do not change in prone position. chiectasis were observed in the HRCT scan done 1 year after the onset of the illness. findings along with histopathology were compatible with the development of pulmonary fibrosis. clinicians should be vigilant for such complications. patients need to have an adequate follow-up even after clinical recovery."}
