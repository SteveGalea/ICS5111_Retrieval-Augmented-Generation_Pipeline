{"summary": "ferrets were anesthetized by intramuscular injection with a ketamine-acepromazine-xylazine cocktail prior to all procedures. transponder chips (BioMedic Data Systems) were subcutaneously implanted for identification and temperature monitoring. animal studies were completed under biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) biocontainment at the Galveston National Laboratory. results were approved by the UTMB Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee. animal studies were completed under biosafety level 4 biocontainment. OV strain Kikwit (n = 5), SEBOV strain Gulu (n = 5), and BEBOV (n = 5) respectively. the initial experiment had 3 animals, followed by a repeat confirmatory study with 2 additional ferrets per virus group. animal studies were completed under biosafety level 4 biocontainment. analysis of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-), nitrite (a marker for nitric oxide production), and coagulation parameters measured in serum or plasma specimens was performed. Virus Isolation Determination of infectious virus in plasma, spleen, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, pancreas, lung, and brain was performed using conventional plaque assays. evidence of hemorrhage was evident at the pyloric/duodenal junction, spleen, urinary bladder, and lymph nodes. all represented lesions were from Zaire ebolavirus\u2013infected ferrets. however, gross pathology severity was comparable across ebolavirus species. ing of viral antigen was seen in hepatic sinusoidal mononuclear cells, sheets (ZEBOV) or small clusters (BEBOV) of hepatocytes. Striking increases of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling in the spleen was noted in all infected ferrets as compared to the control ferret spleens. viremia was not detected in any Ebolavirus group at day 2 after infection. a mean of 4 log10 PFU/mL, 3 log10 PFU/mL, and 2 log10 PFU/mL was first detected for ZEBOV, SEBOV, and BEBOV. ferrets died at a mean of 6, 7 and 9 days after infection for ZEBOV, SEBOV, and BEBOV. common clinical signs included worsening depression, diarrhea, dehydration, nasal and ocular discharge, labored breathing, hunched posture, and altered gait. remarkably, ferrets died at a mean of 6, 7 and 9 days after infection. the most significant lesions noted on hematoxylin-eosin staining were marked lymphohistiocytic and neutrophilic necrotizing hepatitis and necrotizing splenitis. both SEBOV- and BEBOV-infected animals also had marked hepatic vacuolar degeneration. all experimental histopathologic findings were compared against historical control tissue from Ebolavirus-naive ferrets. evidence of multiorgan failure was noted in terminal serum samples. progressively increasing levels of the circulating proinflammatory markers TNF- and nitric oxide were also recorded in all animals beginning on day 4. progressive increases in levels of circulating fibrinogen were also noted beginning on day 4. no virus was isolated from the pancreas of ZEBOV- or SEBOV-infected animals. peak titers were noted in typical target organs such as liver and spleen. rodent models for ZEBOV (Mayinga strain) and SEBOV (Boniface strain) have been described. these models require serial passage to achieve uniform lethality. we report 3 ferret models of infection with phylogenetically distinct Ebolaviruses. they recapitulated hallmark pathologic processes of Ebolavirus infection in primates. these models have potential utility for dissecting key events in the pathogenesis of several Ebolaviruses. _index.html (1.5KB, html)."}
