{"summary": "toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite of the apicomplexan phylum. it is capable of infecting a wide range of mammals, including humans. the parasite avoids phagocytosis and instead actively invades its host cell. parasite resides in a stable parasitophorous vacuole (PV) where it replicates. the major differences in mouse virulence among these strain types have been mapped to a polymorphic family of rhoptry kinases including ROP18 and ROP5 (16) these determinants have been shown to play a major role in combating host defense in gamma interferon (IFN-)-activated cells. deletion of the GBP cluster of chromosome 3 makes mice more susceptible to T. gondii infection. mice lacking NLRP1B (37) or NLRP3 or caspase-1 (38) are more susceptible to type II parasite infection. NADPH oxidases (Nox) are multimeric enzyme complexes that generate superoxide free radicals upon activation. gp91phox (Nox2) and p22phox subunits that reside in the plasma membrane recruit other cytosolic subunits to convert NADPH to NADP+ and hence generate superoxide radicals (41). Upon activation, nox rapidly generates elevated production of ROS (defined as respiratory burst) in naive macrophages with avirulent type III T. gondii, parasites induced Nox-dependent ROS production and Gbp5 expression. both factors are involved in clearance of type III parasites from naive macrophages independent of prior activation with IFN- and independent of classical inflammasome activation that can be primed by LPS. findings reveal novel roles for cell-intrinsic factors in controlling intracellular pathogens T. gondii is generally regarded as a pathogen that survives in naive macrophages. intracellular survival of GT1 (type I) and CTG (type III) parasites in naive bone marrow-derived macrophages at 20 h expressed as percentage of initial infection at 0.5 h. macrophages were challenged with parasites at an MOI of 0.5, washed, fixed, and stained with SAG1 to detect images were costained with host cell markers LAMP1 (MAb ID4B, green), LAMP2 (rat MAb GL2A7, green), autophagy adapter p62 (rat MAb GL2A7, green), or ubiquitin FK2 (MAb FK2, red). images were analyzed using custom-designed cellProfiler project template. GT1 and CTG strains suggest clearance of CTG was not due to phagocytosis in naive BMDMs. autophagy has also been implicated in growth restriction of susceptible T. gondii strains. ubiquitination of the vacuole membrane was very low on both parasite strains. a majority of parasitophorous vacuoles at early time points revealed normal cellular architecture of both the vacuole membrane and the parasite residing within. however, at no stage did we observe the scalloped appearance of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane that accompanies Irg-mediated clearance. BMDMs from mutant mice lacking factors involved in intracellular pathogen clearance were examined. survival at 20 h was assessed relative to infection at 0.5 h. BMDMs lacking nitric oxide production (Nos2/), Irg-mediated defense (IrgM3/), or autophagy protein Atg5 (Atg5f/f LysMCre) failed to reverse clearance. atg5 represents Atg5f/f crossed with LysMCre mice. each symbol represents an independent biological experiment. NADPH oxidases in phagocytes are well known to produce ROS. samples were incubated with zymosan A (50 g/ml, black) or zymosan A with diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 10 M) (gray) or infected with CTG parasites (red) or GT1 parasites (green) at an MOI of 10. values represent mean intracellular CellROX intensity (Cy5 channel) standard errors of the means from at least 1,500 cells per sample normalized to uninfected/ unpaired Student\u2019s t test was used to compare ROS levels in uninfected and CTG-infected RAW 264.7 macrophages. the sample was incubated with zymosan A (50 g/ml, black) or zymosan A with DPI (10 M, gray) or infected with GT1 (green) strain parasites. nox1/ and Nox2/ mice are susceptible to CTG infection. our findings thus far suggest that increased clearance of CTG is due to elevated ROS production. reversal of CTG clearance was also evident in wild-type BMDMs at 9 h postinfection. untreated (UI, black) or infected with CTG (red, MOI of 3) or GT1 (green, MOI of 3) parasites and analyzed at 9 h postinfection. unpaired Student\u2019s t test was used to compare ROS levels in CTG-infected wild-type and Nox1/ (magenta) BMDMs. wild-type (WT) mice were infected with 106 parasites by i.p. injection. cells were harvested 2 days later for staining. the increased expansion of CTG in inflammatory macrophages from nox-deficient mice also led to different outcomes of infection. nox1/ and Nox2/ mice were significantly more susceptible than wild-type mice to i.p. infection with CTG. Gbp5 mRNA increased up to 40-fold upon T. gondii infection. Gbp2 and Gbp7 mRNA showed an 10-fold increase. specificity of the 65-kDa band of Gbp5 was confirmed by its absence in cell lysates of Gbp5/ BMDMs. significant difference at P 0.05 between CTG-infected wild-type and Gbp5/ BMDMs at 20 h using Student\u2019s t test. inflammasome activation occurs upon T. gondii infection of naive macrophages. treatment with nigericin was able to elicit caspase-1 release in naive macrophages. this effect was partially abrogated in Gbp5/ macrophages. infection with T. gondii alone is not sufficient to induce inflammasome activation because priming signals are needed for IL-1 mRNA expression. but when combined with LPS, it provides a signal that drives IL-1 release. mRNA levels were quantified with respect to actin as an internal control. cleaved caspase-1 in supernatants of LPS (10 ng/ml)-preactivated wild-type and Gbp5/ BMDMs infected with CTG or GT1 for 20 h. treatment with 0.1% saponin for 10 min was used as a positive control. values represent mean SD of percentage of dead cells measured in triplicate. significant difference at P 0.05 between groups using Student\u2019s t test. unactivated macrophages were infected with type I (GT1 strain) or type III (CTG strain) parasites at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. the cells were fixed at 30 min and 20 h postinfection. the percentage of infected cells was calculated by automated plate-based imaging. macrophages were challenged with parasites at an MOI of 0.5, washed, fixed, and stained with SAG1 to detect parasites and LAMP1 to detect host cell lysosomes. values represent means standard errors of the means from three independent replicates with at least 50 fields per replicate. toxoplasma gondii is known to actively invade host cells, including macrophages, and to avoid lysosomal fusion (7). this difference in survival might reflect altered uptake and delivery of parasites to lysosomes. the autophagy-associated marker LAMP2 was not elevated on CTG-containing vacuoles in naive BMDMs. previous studies on clearance of T. gondii in IFN--activated macrophages have demonstrated that the clearance mediated by IRGs and GBPs occurs in the first few hours after infection. naive BMDMs remained infected at 4, 8, 12, and 24 h compared to 0.5 h. values represent means standard errors of means for percentage of infected cells compared to 0.5 h with at least 100 fields per time point. nitric oxide production, Irg-mediated defenses, and Atg-related pathways are unlikely to explain the increased susceptibility of CTG in naive mouse macrophages. BMDMs lacking gp91 (Nox2/; NADPH oxidase) showed significant loss of CTG clearance compared to wild-type cells. mouse macrophages with T. gondii have been shown to produce early ROS (48) neither CTG nor GT1 produced ROS as defined by classical respiratory burst in naive RAW 264.7 macrophages. however, incubation of macrophages with zymosan A (ZymA; 50 g/ml) produced the expected ROS burst within a few minutes of incubation. cells were stained with CellROX (5 M) for 30 min before fixation in 4% formaldehyde. values represent mean intracellular CellROX intensity (Cy5 channel) standard errors of the means from at least 1,500 cells per sample normalized to uninfected/untreated cells (gray line) at each respective time point. this content is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. to test whether infection induced delayed production of intracellular ROS, we infected RAW 264.7 macrophages with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled parasites. we monitored intracellular ROS levels by staining with CellROX deep red. CTG infection was significantly rescued in BMDMs infected with CTG. both nox isoforms are involved in ROS production in BMDMs. this finding suggested that both Nox isoforms are involved in ROS production in wild-type cells. BMDMs from wild-type (WT, ), Nox1/ (), and Nox2/ () mice were infected with CTG parasites. cells were harvested 2 days later for staining. the loss of CTG clearance in Nox-deficient macrophages in vitro suggested that this response might also be responsible for control of parasites in vivo. wild-type C57BL/6, Nox1/, and Nox2/ mice were challenged by intraperitoneal infection and monitored over time. we sought other explanations for enhanced susceptibility of CTG in naive macrophages. induction of Gbp1 (31) and Gbp2 (32) during T. gondii infection is associated with their recruitment onto the PVM and parasite damage. however, some Gbps, including Gbp3 and Gbp5, can be expressed in macrophages to a significant level independent of IFN- (32) real-time PCR showing fold induction of mRNA transcripts in wild-type (WT) and nox2/ BMDMs at 20 h compared to uninfected cells at 4 h. Western blot of cell lysates from uninfected naive BMDMs (4 and 20 h) probed for Gbp5 (green) and actin (red) infected wild-type (WT), nox2/, and Gbp5/ BMDMs infected at 20 h compared to 0.5 h. previous studies have implicated Gbp5 in promoting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and control of intracellular bacteria. the increase was significantly reduced upon NAC pretreatment of wild-type macrophages or in Gbp5/ and Nox2/ macrophages. treatment with nigericin was able to elicit caspase-1 release in naive or LPS-primed macrophages. this effect was partially abrogated in Gbp5/ macrophages. transcript levels were quantified with respect to actin as an internal control. the transcript levels are shown as fold difference compared to uninfected (UI) and untreated (UT) BMDMs. values represent mean SD for an experiment done in triplicate. values below the immunoblot correspond to the levels of caspase-1 in the supernatant normalized to amount loaded and compared to uninfected (UI) wild-type BMDMs. this content is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. despite evidence that Gbp5 contributes to clearance, we observed only modest evidence for its recruitment to parasitophorous vacuoles containing CTG. however, Gbp5 recruitment was absent (0%) in either GT1 or CTG parasites expressing the type I ROP18 allele (CTG.ROP18) naive macrophages cleared avirulent type III T. gondii parasites via induction of cellular ROS. infected cells did not undergo caspase-1 cleavage or pyroptosis. infected cells did not undergo caspase-1 cleavage or pyroptosis. recruitment of Irgs to the PVM is dependent on a noncanonical autophagy pathway. the enhanced clearance of type III parasites was unaltered in Atg5/, IrgM3/, or Nos2/ cells. this outcome differs morphologically and kinetically from previously described pathways for clearance of T. gondii in macrophages. the role of NADPH oxidase was also seen in vivo where nox1/ and nox2/ mice showed increased infection of inflammatory macrophages during early infection with CTG. previous studies have suggested a role for NADPH oxidase during acute infection of mice with type I parasites that elicited ROS production. expression of Gbp5 was strongly induced upon infection with T. gondii. expression of Gbp5 was strongly induced upon infection with T. gondii. no significant change was seen in Gbp1 or Irga6. expression of ROP18 reversed enhanced clearance seen in naive macrophages. this protective effect is thought to occur at the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. expression of ROP18 in the type III strain reversed enhanced clearance. we did not detect cleavage and release of caspase-1 or activation of pyroptosis in cells that have previously been primed (52). however, we did not detect cleavage and release of caspase-1 or activation of pyroptosis in T. gondii-infected cells even following LPS priming. the susceptibility of type III strains to clearance in naive cells contributes to their profound avirulence in the murine system. type II strains, which have intermediate virulence in mice, were not susceptible to clearance in naive cells. chronic granulomatous disease patients are not known to be more susceptible to toxoplasmosis. pyroptosis is an autonomous system for cell-intrinsic control of intracellular infection. cellROX deep red, goat anti-mouse IgG, goat anti-rat IgG, goat anti-rabbit, or goat anti-guinea pig secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 594 or Alexa 488 were obtained from Life Technologies. mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) anti-caspase-1 (p20) was obtained from Adipogen Life Sciences ( MAb DG52 was labeled with Pacific Blue (Pac Blue) dye using a protein labeling kit (Invitrogen) to generate Pac Blue-labeled antibody for parasite detection by flow cytometry. mouse MAb FK2 against polyubiquitin and monoubiquitin was obtained from Abcam.
