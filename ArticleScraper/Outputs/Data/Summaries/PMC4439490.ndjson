{"summary": "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects over 10% of the population between 40 and 80 years of age. acute exacerbations of COPD play a crucial role in the course of the disease, having a negative impact on morbidity, mortality, healthcare costs, and health-related quality of life. in 2009, the world experienced the first pandemic of influenza A virus in 40 years, and this pathogen is now known as the H1N1pdm09 pandemic virus. this virus spread worldwide, causing high infection rates but low mortality compared with previous pandemics. in 2009-10, this virus spread worldwide, causing high infection rates but low mortality compared with previous pandemics. a retrospective observational study was done at the clinic university hospital of Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain. Respiratory samples from 195 AE-COPD patients hospitalized in Castile and Le\u00f3n Hospital Network (Spain) were sent to the microbiology laboratory for viral molecular diagnosis between October 2009 and September 2012. Influenza Sentinel Surveillance Network (ISSN) of Castile and Le\u00f3n defined six study periods (Table 1) following the World Health Organization guidelines [25]. a set of molecular diagnostic techniques were implemented during the 2009 pandemic. Influenza B lineages Victoria and Yamagata were identified using a real-time RT-PCR as previously described [26]. Detection probability of the different respiratory pathogens involved in this work was calculated using odds ratio (OR) adjusted by demographic and epidemiological characteristics such as sex, age, and the influenza circulation periods included in the study. this inclusion criterion was established by the chief pulmonologist of our hospital network following the anthonisen criteria [24] in which one of the following symptoms were present. the clinical chart of each of the potentially included patients was checked for the presence of at least one of the cited symptoms. Demographic data such as age and sex were also obtained from the order slips. primary screening was by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for 17 different respiratory viral targets (influenza virus A/H3, A/H1, A/H1N1pdm09 and B); respiratory syncytial viruses A and B (RSV A and RSV B); HREV; coronavirus OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63. t-test adjusted by age with 95% confidence interval ( = 0.01). results Of the 195 patients included in the study, 94 (48.2%) were between the ages of 30 and 64 years and 101 (51.8%) were 65 years. influenza A/H1N1pdm09 was the most frequently detected respiratory virus during this period. the highest number of AE-COPD episodes (n = 124; 63.6%) was recorded for the pandemic, followed by FLUEP1 (n = 40; 20.5%) and FLUEP2 (n = 25; 12.8%). only 6 AE-COPD episodes occurred during any of the interepidemic periods, and none of them were diagnosed with respiratory viral infection. whole period studied Pandemic INEP1 FLUEP1 INEP2 FLUEP2 INEP3 2010 2010-11 2011 2011-12 2012 AE-COPD cases 195 124 0 40 4 25 2 Mean Age (SD) 63.9 (13.1) 62.7 (13.1) 0 (0) 61.1 (14.2) 66.5 (2.1) 67.9 (12.6) 69.5 (2.1) Males (%) 136 (69.7) 85 (68.6) 0 (0) 25 (62.5) influenza viruses were the most detected respiratory pathogens in AE-COPD patients during the pandemic and following epidemics. influenza A/H1N1pdm09 was detected in 35 cases (28.2%) during the pandemic and following epidemics. HREV and RSV were the second and third most diagnosed viruses during the pandemic. coinfections were more common in AE-COPD cases from the pandemic. the OR for detecting influenza in the 30\u201364-year age group was 2.78-fold greater than for the 65-year old group. the probability for detecting influenza virus in the first epidemic was significantly lower than in the second epidemic. viral etiology increased from 47.6% in the pandemic to 64.0% in the FLUEP2. viral infections are associated with higher frequencies of AE-COPD than bacterial infection or air pollution. this suggests there exists a balance between bacterial and viral infections which promotes these exacerbations. the virus most frequently detected in AE-COPD patients during the study period was influenza A/H1N1pdm09, followed by HREV and RSV. despite that, HREV remained as the second most frequent cause of AE-COPD episodes in the patients included in this work. there were 2.78-fold more influenza virus detections in adults aged 30\u201364 than in the elderly patients aged 65. most of the other viruses were subtyped as A/H1N1pdm09 influenza strain. this viral strain has strongly affected younger individuals since its emergence in 2009. the early use of antiviral drugs against influenza viruses in hospitalized patients results in better management of AE-COPD episodes. the high percentage of negative samples diagnosed showed the need for improved diagnostics to identify the role of bacterial infections in the AE-COPD in our sanitary area. the new influenza pandemic virus A/H1N1pdm09 caused influenza A viruses to be the main pathogens that affected COPD patients during the period studied. however, A/H1N1pdm09 did not change the global role of respiratory viruses as the primary cause of COPD exacerbations during the pandemic and following two influenza epidemics."}
