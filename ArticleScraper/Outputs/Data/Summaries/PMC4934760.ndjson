{"summary": "PRRS virus is an enveloped positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales, along with equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) the PRRSV genome is approximately 15 kb in length and includes at least 10 open reading frames (ORFs) the nucleocapsid (N) protein is translated from the last ORF (ORF7) to encapsidate the viral RNA genome (9. PRRSV RdRp is considered to be a core component of the viral replication and transcription complex (RTC) that is crucial for virus replication (11) the nucleocapsid protein of bunyavirus was reported to interact with its L polymerase and mediate the switch from capped RNA-primed transcription to unprimed viral RNA replication. the nucleocapsid protein of hantavirus was also shown to interact with its RdRp, and their association was required for viral RNA synthesis. a role in viral RNA synthesis has also been postulated for the N protein of coronavirus the PRRSV nucleocapsid protein interacts with Nsp9 and its RdRp. DHX9 also recruits the cellular helicase DHX9 during virus infection. these proteins play an important role in the regulation of arterivirus PRRSV RNA synthesis to balance the production of viral sgmRNAs. the N proteins from PRRSV strain NVSL 97-7895 were predicted by the I-TASSER server online tool (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/) the structure files were analyzed using PyMOL software (PyMOL v1.0) the cells were incubated with rabbit anti-DHX9 polyclonal antibodies (Proteintech, USA) at room temperature for 1 h. after three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. the fluorescence signals were recorded by confocal microscopy. pBiFC-Nsp9-VN173 and pBiFC-VC155 were digested with restriction enzymes. hek 293T cells were cotransfected with the two constructs using calcium phosphate. the supernatant was replaced with fresh medium at 8 h posttransfection. the fluorescence was examined 24 h later using a microscope. the purification was preformed using his-Bind Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (CWBIO) Sepharose. the protein was eluted in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.9), 0.5 M NaCl, and 200 mM imidazole. protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE or Tricine\u2013SDS-PAGE gels. the membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% skimmed milk. the membranes were then incubated with the indicated primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight. the infected cells were harvested at 0, 24, and 48 hpi. the total RNAs were extracted and the mRNA levels for N and Nsp1 were quantified by real-time RT-PCR. luciferase reporter gene was also cloned as a control (pTriEx-shCT) for DHX9 overexpression, a construct of pTriEx-DHX9 was generated in two steps due to the limited available restriction sites in the vector. the 3\u2032 part of DHX9 was amplified using the primer pair BamHIDHX9r1-F/EcoRIDHX9r1-R. quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed in a CFX96 Real-Time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) the following cycling conditions were used for real-time PCRs: 95\u00b0C for 30 s and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 5 s and 60\u00b0C for 30 s. a pair of internal primers in the N gene were used to measure viral total RNA. human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells and Marc-145 cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. growth media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone), 0.1 mM sodium pyruvate, and penicillin (100 U/ml)-streptomycin (100 g/ml) transfections of HEK 293T cells in 100-mm plates were performed with 1 g of plasmids per well using calcium phosphate (35). cells were cotransfected with constructs expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)- and mCherry-tagged proteins. cells were fixed and permeabilized with precooled isometric methyl alcohol and acetone for 10 min. yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay, the Nsp9 and N genes of strain NVSL 97-78975 were amplified by PCR using the corresponding primers listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material. the truncated fragments and site-directed mutants of Nsp9 were cloned into plasmid pGBKT7, the same vector as for the full-length Nsp9, and the mutants of primer pairs NcoINsp9-F/XhoINsp9-R and EcoRIN-F/BamHIN-R were used to amplify Nsp9 and N fragments from NVSL 97-78975 and TA-12. the N genes were inserted into pTriEx-1.1 to make pTriEx-Nsp9 constructs, and the N genes were cloned into pGEX-2T. GST was added to the mixtures to a final concentration of 10 g/ml. proteins bound with the beads were eluted with elution buffer. eluates were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue or detected by Western blotting. the primary antibodies used in this study included mouse anti-His (1:5,000; CWBIO), anti-GST monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and rabbit anti-DHX9 polyclonal antibody (1:5,000; Proteintech) the membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000; CWBIO) at 37\u00b0C for 2 h for 2 h. shRNA knockdown of DHX9 was selected according to the method of a previous study. the forward and reverse oligonucleotides encode a hairpin structure within a 19-nucleotide (nt) stem and a 9-nt loop (5\u2032-TCTCTTGAA-3\u2032) in the middle. the 3\u2032 part of DHX9 was amplified using the primer pair EcoRIDHX9r2-F/HindIIIDHX9r2-R and cloned into the pTriEx-1.1 plasmid. the 5\u2032 part of DHX9 was amplified using the primer pair BamHIDHX9r1-F/EcoRIDHX9r1-R and cloned into the construct between the BamHI and HindIII sites a forward primer in the 5\u2032 leader and a reverse primer in the ORF were used for the PCR. the cellular GAPDH was quantified as the internal control to normalize the cDNA amounts. the 2CT method was used to calculate relative levels of viral genomic and subgenomic RNAs. empty vectors pGADT7 and pGBKT7 were cotransformed into the yeast strain Gold. pGBKT7-Nsp9 and pGBKT7-N were cotransformed as negative controls. yeast cells were cotransformed with the indicated constructs. the fusion proteins Nsp9-His and GST-N were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 2 h. GST was purified and used as the control protein for binding of GST-N to Nsp9-His. coli purified the proteins for pulldown assays. the protein was expressed as five BD-fused fragments containing amino acid residues 1 to 180, 181 to 452, 453 to 646, 1 to 452, and 181 to 646 for yeast two-hybrid assays. the results showed that the N protein clearly bound to Nsp9 with or without RNase treatment. fragment 453 to 646 was split in two, 453 to 551 and 552 to 646. it was shown that the N protein bound to the 552-to-646 polypeptide. further truncation of the fragment 552 to 646 (552 to 598 and 599 to 646 in Fig. 2B) positioned the N protein binding site in the 599-to-646 region. vectors expressing N-GFP and Nsp9599\u2013646-His were cotransfected into HEK 293T cells. the cells were grown on selective medium in decreasing densities. thirty-six hours after transfection, the cell lysate was harvested and purified using Ni-NTA beads. mCherry fused to full-length Nsp9 and the Nsp9599\u2013646 and Nsp91\u2013551 segments. the results showed that Nsp9599\u2013646 and Nsp91\u2013551 segments colocalized with the N protein in the cytoplasm. the N protein could enter the nucleolus while Nsp9 resided only in the cytoplasm. the sequence similarity between the low-virulence European strain Olot/91 and the two American strains was only about 60% for the N protein and 70% for Nsp9. the protein expression level of Nsp9-His from strain TA-12 was low, the protein degraded rapidly during the pulldown assay. the pulldown assays were carried out under the same conditions as for strain NVSL 97-7895. the residues shaded in yellow were conserved among all three strains. those shaded in cyan were identical in two of the three strains. hek 293T cells were cotransfected with vectors expressing N-GFP. PRRSV Nsp9 interacted with the N protein through its C-terminal domain. this interaction existed in the low-pathogenic european strain. a series of residues exposed on the contacting surface of Nsp9 were chosen for mutagenesis analysis. protein docking was carried out with a simulated-interaction online server (PRISM 2.0) the residues probably involved in the N-Nsp9 interaction, according to predicted binding models. -GFP antibodies, and the proteins eluted from protein A beads were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-His MAb. the results showed that replacement of single amino acids had little effect on the N-Nsp9 interaction. however, the E611A/E611A double mutant lost the ability to interact with the N protein. predicted three-dimensional structure of the N protein of strain NSVL 97-7895 is shown in surface (top) and cartoon (bottom) formats. residues probably involved in the N-Nsp9 interaction, according to the predicted binding models. expression of Nsp9599\u2013646 significantly inhibited the synthesis of viral gRNAs compared to the control transfected with an empty vector. qRT-PCR data showed that expression of Nsp9599\u2013646 inhibited the synthesis of both viral gRNA and viral total RNAs compared to the control transfected with an empty vector. iters at 48 hpi were determined by limiting-dilution analysis. the data from three independent experiments were averaged and used to calculate the standard deviations. the phosphorylated N protein has been found to recruit the RNA helicase DDX1. this can facilitate the synthesis of longer viral sgmRNAs. both studies have identified DHX9 as a potential cellular partner for the N protein. DHX9 and N-His were coexpressed in HEK 293T cells. Nsp7-His was coexpressed with DHX9 as a control. at 36 h posttransfection, the cells were harvested. lysates were incubated with anti-DHX9 antibody and protein A beads. fluorescence was detected by confocal microscopy. arrows indicate redistribution of endogenous cellular DHX9 to the cytoplasm. hek 293T cells were transfected with vector expressing N-GFP for 48 h. replication of PRRSV RNAs is carried out in the cytoplasm of the host cells. if DHX9 is recruited by the PRRSV N protein, it will require the redistribution of the protein into the cytoplasm. if DHX9 is recruited by the PRRSV N protein, it will require the redistribution of the protein into the cytoplasm. DHX9 knockdown in Marc-145 cells was knocked down by transfection of a RNA interference vector expressing a short hairpin RNA targeting the DHX9 gene (shDHX9). expression of shDHX9 reduced the level of DHX9 protein by about 60% compared to the controls transfected with the empty vector or plasmid expressing interfering RNA of the luciferase reporter gene. the levels of viral RNAs were monitored at 48 hpi by quantitative RT-PCR. the levels of shCT treatment were normalized to a value of 1. (C) Detection of overexpression of DHX9 protein by Western blotting. knockdown of DHX9 expression inhibited the production of progeny viruses. overexpression of DHX9 prominently increased virus production compared with the control group. p9-BD activated the reporter in yeast cells. Yeast cells were cotransformed with the indicated constructs. pGADT7-T/pGBKT7-p53 was set up as a positive control. pGADT7-T/pGBKT7-Lam was the negative control. 93T cells, the cell lysate was incubated with purified Nsp9-His. a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay was then applied. to confirm the interaction of Nsp9 with the N protein, a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay was then applied. the full-length Nsp9 of PRRSV is a large protein that harbors 646 amino acids. the protein was expressed as five BD-fused fragments containing amino acid residues 1 to 180, 181 to 452, 453 to 646, 1 to 452, and 181 to 646. truncation of the fragment 552 to 646 (552 to 598 and 599 to 646 in Fig. 2B) positioned the N protein binding site in the 599 predicted 3D structure of Nsp9 of PRRSV strain NVSL 97-7895. full-length Nsp9 was truncated into five fragments in the first stage. fragment Nsp9453\u2013646 was split into fragments Nsp9552\u2013646 and Nsp9552\u2013598. constructs expressing N-GFP and His-tagged Nsp9599\u2013646 were cotransfected into 293T cells. N-GFP was pulled down by Nsp9599\u2013646-His, but not by the control protein, Nsp7-His. this result verified that the N protein binding domain of Nsp9 was located in the cytoplasm. two PRRSV genotypes are represented by the North American prototype strain VR-2332 and the European prototype strain Lelystad virus (LV) the above-mentioned data demonstrated the interaction between the Nsp9 and N proteins of PRRSV isolate NSVL97-7895, a highly virulent North American strain isolated in the united states in 1997 (31). TA-12 and a low-virulence European strain, Olot/91, were used in this study. Nsp9-His and GST-N were purified using Ni-NTA or GST-Bind Sepharose. the pulldown assays were carried out under the same conditions as for strain NVSL 97-7895. a coimmunoprecipitation assay was carried out to validate the interaction domain on Nsp9 of strains TA-12 and Olot/91. a series of residues exposed on the contacting surface of Nsp9 according to the binding models were chosen for mutagenesis analysis. compared with the WT Nsp9599\u2013646, replacement of amino acids E608, E611, E639, and E646 with alanine effectively weakened but did not abrogate the association of the N protein with the N protein. the mutants showed growth ability on the selective media similar to that of the single mutants. HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with vectors expressing N-GFP. precipitated proteins and input cell lysates were examined by Western blotting. cellular -actin was detected as an internal control. amino acids R13, T81-Q85-F104, and T101 on the N protein could bind to the residues E608, E646, and E611, respectively, on Nsp9. constructs expressing the five site-directed mutants of the N protein were generated for Y2H assay. the rest of the mutants displayed no difference from the WT N protein in the Y2H assay. p9 (E608, E611, and E646) involved in the N-Nsp9 interaction were identified. further studies are needed to investigate the actual roles of these amino acids in N-Nsp9 binding. the vector expressing the polypeptide Nsp9599\u2013646, which had been determined by pulldown and co-IP assays to be able to bind to the N protein, was transfected into Marc-145 cells. the expression of Nsp9 fragments in the transfected cells at 16 h posttransfection was detected by Western blotting using anti-His monoclonal antibody. tubulin was detected as an internal control. the GAPDH level was monitored as an internal control for qRT-PCR. 646A double mutant exhibited no activity inhibitive to the synthesis of viral RNAs compared to the empty vector. interfering with the N-Nsp9 interaction suppressed the synthesis of viral RNAs. replacing critical residues in the interfering fragments to relieve the inhibition of the N-Nsp9 interaction could also relieve the suppression effect on viral RNA production. DHX9 and N-His were coexpressed in HEK 293T cells. DHX9 and N-His were coexpressed with DHX9 as a control. western blotting of the input lysates and precipitated proteins was performed. Marc-145 cells were infected with PRRSV at an MOI of 1, and the cells were lysed at 48 hpi. the coimmunoprecipitation assays were carried out using anti-DHX9 antibody. purified N protein was also immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-DHX9 antibody. fusion proteins N-GFP and mCherry-DHX9 were coexpressed in HEK 293T cells. in transfected cells, the majority of the overexpressed mCherry-DHX9 entered cell nuclei, and N-GFP localized in both the cytoplasm and cell nuclei. the localization of DHX9 in cell nuclei is consistent with the function of the protein in transcription regulation. DHX9 localized to the nucleus in uninfected Marc-145 cells. DHX9 was knocked down by transfection of an RNA interference vector. he reduced the level of DHX9 protein by about 60% compared to controls transfected with the empty vector or plasmid. the relative levels of the shortest viral sgmRNA, sgmRNA7, had no significant differences. this result suggested the positive role of DHX9 in the process of synthesizing long subgenomic mRNAs and genomic RNA. titers produced in DHX9 knockdown and overexpressing cells at 48 and 72 hpi were determined by endpoint dilution assay. the data shown are averages of the results of three independent experiments. PRRSV can be successfully rescued by reverse genetics without the preexisting N protein (30, 31), suggesting that N protein is also dispensable for the initiation of PRRSV RNA synthesis. however, whether N protein of PRRSV is involved in the regulation of the viral RNA synthesis process has remained obscure. in this study, we detected only the interaction of tagged N protein with Nsp9 due to the lack of appropriate antibodies for co-IP assays. in minus-strand RNA viruses, the N protein has been well known to play important roles in viral RNA transcription and replication. in hantavirus, the interaction of N with its RdRp has been reported to be required for viral RNA synthesis. the production of PRRSV genomic RNA was reduced more severely than that of the total viral RNAs by inhibition of the N-Nsp9 interaction. in coronaviruses, the N protein has been reported to be required for efficient replication of the viral genome (44, 45). if the N and RdRp interaction also exists in coronaviruses and participate in RNA synthesis regulation remains to be determined. DHX9 acts as a bridging factor between CREB-binding protein (CBP) and RNA polymerase II. it was also found to be incorporated into HIV virions (48). nidoviruses contain a positive-strand long genomic RNA. the model does not explain how the virus can control the balance between the synthesis of shorter and longer sgmRNAs and gRNA. in coronaviruses, the phosphorylated N protein recruited RNA helicase DDX1 to facilitate template readthrough and enable synthesis of longer sgmRNAs. the phosphorylation of the N protein is unlikely to be involved in the N-Nsp9 and N-DHX9 associations. cellular RNA helicases other than DHX9 are involved in the regulation of the discontinuous minus-strand RNA synthesis process during PRRSV infection. viral biosynthesis starts with the translation of polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. the nonstructural proteins, including Nsp9, are proteolytically processed by virus-encoded proteinases. the body TRSs can lead to premature termination of negative-strand RNA synthesis. V RNA and offer a new potential anti-PRRSV strategy. further studies are ongoing to investigate by reverse genetics."}
