{"summary": "osteoporosis is a common skeletal disorder characterized by a decrease in bone mass and density. women, especially postmenopausal women, are more susceptible to osteoporosis comparad to other groups. the findings are expected to provide effective insights for further exploring the molecular mechanisms of osteoporosis and developing control strategies. the findings are expected to provide effective insights for further exploring the pathology mechanisms of osteoporosis and obtaining better treatment strategies. module-identification algorithm was used to identify modules from PPINs. each side of the constructed PPIN was assigned with absolute value of Spearman correlation coefficient of every interaction according to gene expression data. we found all maximal cliques from low and high PBM PPIN. network entropy was detected in osteoporosis (20) the local network entropy of a node i, denoted Si, is defined as (equation 3): S i = - 1 log k j j N ( i ) p i j is the degree of node j, N(i) is the set of neighbor nodes of node i. entropy of low and high PBM networks was significantly different (20) we first permutated sample labels and recalculated the global entropy of the low and high PBM network. the significance level (P-value) of the tests was calculated by #l|SIl SNo bs for l =l,...,L/L. dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to detect bone density of right femur and third lumbar vertebra. total RNA was extracted by TRIzol RNA kit (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) the human PPIN was collected from the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING; version 9.0) (22). only edges whose correlations are greater than the threshold were chosen, and set at 0.8. module-identification algorithm was used to identify modules from PPINs. we found all maximum cliques from low and high PBM PPIN. the nodes 4 or >20 were filtered out. then 8,002 maximum cliques in osteoporosis were obtained. kj is the degree of node j, N(i) is the set of neighbor nodes of node i and pij defines a stochastic probability matrix on the PBM network. the global entropy of destination networks, denoted S, is defined as follows (equation 5): S = i = 1 n C i S i n is the total number of nodes in the destination networks. entropy of the low PBM network at the 1st time-point and of the high PBM network before this test. all rats were housed at room temperature with 12 h light-dark cycle, and fed with normal chow diet and free access to water. rats were separated into 2 groups in which rats were ovariectomized and sham operated at the age of 6 months. the concentration and purity of total RNA were measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometer. reverse transcription into cDNA was then conducted by a reverse cDNA transcription kit (Takara Bio, Inc., Otsu, Japan) there were 12 monocyte low PBM samples and 11 high PBM samples in the total 23 samples. the platform is A-AFFY-44-Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0. a predefined overlap-threshold t0=0.5 was set to go through the list repeatedly. we ranked these cliques in descending order of their score (C) the global entropy of destination networks, denoted S, is defined as follows (equation 5): S = i = 1 n C i S i n is the total number of nodes in the destination networks, and Ci is the degree centrality of node i. SNi is the local network entropy of node i in low and high PBM networks. all rats were ovariectomized and sham operated at the age of 6 months. three months after surgery, bone mineral density examination was used to verify if the model was successfully established. the primer sequences for the amplification of target genes were shown in Table I. GraphPad Prism version 5 software was used for statistical analyses. the network entropy was ranged from 3.09 to 0.87 and the max value of network entropy of PBM was 0.87 in network 11. Fig. 1 shows the differential PBM network with 8 nodes and 28 edges. 39161 0.104 13 0.049041668 0.440 29 0.010982264 0.054 14 0.034142173 0.594 30 1.195662489 0.753 15 0.034142173 0.594 31 1.195662489 0.753 16 0.054693437 0.838 32 0.058539161 0.104 Figure 1. a total of 66 modules were identified by modeling it as a maximum weight bipartite matching. the characteristics of 32 destination networks are shown in Table II. 0.054693437 0.838 7 0.315852579 0.621 23 0.010982264 0.054 8 0.712615159 0.874 24 0.036448373 0.578 9 0.002127065 0.529 25 1.187984011 0.590 10 0.628285421 0.749 26 0.005631988 0.564 11 0.87169601 0.047 27 0.002146052 0.601 12 0.039361424 0.342 expression of target genes in osteoporosis models compared with sham controls.
