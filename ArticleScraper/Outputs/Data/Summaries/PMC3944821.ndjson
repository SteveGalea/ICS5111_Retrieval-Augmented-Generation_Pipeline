{"summary": "Background Canine parvovirus 2 (CPV 2) is a major infectious cause of mortality in puppies. the characteristic symptom of CPV 2 disease is intestinal hemorrhage with severe bloody diarrhea. CPV 2 was first identified in the late 1970s. the original virus, CPV 2, was replaced in the canine population. single-stranded DNA virus with a genome of approximately 5 kb. it belongs to the genus Parvovirus, along with FPV, mink enteritis virus, raccoon parvovirus, and porcine parvovirus. hypotheses for how this may have occurred have been suggested, including direct mutation from FPV. CPV 2a and 2b isolates are common in the united states. CPV 2a and 2b is the predominant variant in Asian countries. a few CPV 2c strains have been isolated in india [26]. the genotypes of 28 canine parvovirus type 2 isolates collected from Taiwanese dogs Strain * Sampling time County (Region) Age ** Vaccination Genotype Accession number 176R 2008/JUL Taipei (North) NA 2b KF906327 177R 2008/OCT Taipei (North) NA 2b KF906328 178R 2009/JAN Taipei (North) 6Y Yes 2a KF906329 181BR chung (Central) 1Y No 2b KF906338 104R 2012/NOV Taichung (Central) 4 M No 2b KF906339 105R 2012/NOV Taichung (Central) 10 M No 2b KF906341 107R 2012/NOV Taichung (Central) 1Y No 2b KF906342 117R 2012/DEC Taichung (Central) 6 M No 2a KF906343 118R 2012/MAR Pingtung ( homology of local new CPV 2a and 2b isolates and reference strains appeared to be much higher. homology levels between our analyzed CPV 2a and our CPV 2a (99.7-99.8%) and Korean CPV 2 K026 (EU009204) appeared to be much higher. amino acid comparisons among the 28 isolates and the 12 reference strains revealed a major region of great diversity at amino acids 297\u2013324. the amino acid Glu426, which is unique to strain CPV 2c, was no observed in any strain in this study. PCR amplification and genotype analysis A total of 28 cases from 144 dogs showed positive results for CPV 2. of the 28 Taiwanese CPV 2 strains, 15 were identified as new CPV 2a, and 13 were identified as new CPV 2b.

CPV 2c was not observed in this study. samples were collected from 144 dogs in northern, central, and southern Taiwan between 2008 and 2012. CPV 2a (AY742953, AB054213, AB054215, DQ340434, EF011664, EF189717, EU009204, EU145955, FJ005259, FJ197841, FJ197842, FJ435343, FJ435345, FJ435346, FJ435347, FJ435347, GQ379048, GU569942, HQ602978) all of the clinical specimens were screened for CPV 2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the partial VP2 gene of CPV 2 was amplified by PCR as described by Buonavoglia et al. multiple alignments of the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences were performed using the maximum likelihood method. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
