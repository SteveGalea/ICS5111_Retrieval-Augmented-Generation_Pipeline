{"summary": "international travel, representing 684 million passengers in 2009, adds complexity in preventing and reducing rapid transmission of infectious diseases across borders. rapid travel has intensified the need for consistent application of infection control principles to ensure the safety of patients, hospital visitors and health workers. a study of 1,290 workers across sixteen hospitals in British Columbia found that health workers who rated the environmental protective measures highly at their institutions were 12 times more likely to report a high level of compliance. a questionnaire completed by healthcare workers was compared with on-site observational audits in facilities in British Columbia and Ontario. there was a discrepancy between health workers\u2019 perception of what was available and what is actually accessible in facilities. team collaborated with the pan American health organization on a project related to the prevention of occupational transmission of infectious diseases among health workers. the team adapted the Canadian workplace assessment tool and questionnaire to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices in three hospitals in Ecuador. the questionnaire includes a list of occupational hazards, including physical, chemical, biological, ergonomic, safety, and psychological hazards. the Occupational Health and Safety Information System (OHASIS) is a web-based health information system. it tracks incidents, exposures, risk factors, immunizations and occupational injury and diseases. PAHO invited our team to assist in preparing health workers for the global summit and the pan American games in Trinidad and tobago. the online course and tools, such as the workplace assessment, have been presented at various regional and national trainings such as the PAHO train-the-trainer workshops. the workshops were held in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Trinidad and tobago and Belize. the tools developed have since been revised and are now being used to train health and safety committees in Canada. we created training tools to address the organizational, environmental and individual factors we identified as important determinants of infection control compliance. we then found that providing time to take the course on work time was significantly associated with higher intention to comply with safety precautions compared to promoting the course on a voluntary basis [22]. a new partnership was forged between the combined Canadian occupational health and infection control team and their South African counterparts. a new partnership was being forged between the combined Canadian occupational health and infection control team and their South African counterparts. a new partnership was being forged between the combined Canadian occupational health and infection control team and their South African counterparts. a major impact of our work to date has been the demonstration of the benefits of close collaboration between infection control and occupational health. a major impact of our work to date has been the demonstration of the benefits of close collaboration between infection control and occupational health, which in most jurisdictions, was weak. a key lesson to note is the importance of thinking about scale-up and sustainability from the start. the pilots were successful, but resources are not in place to continue the efforts at the desired intensity. by working closely with the WHO, the International Labour Office, the International Commission on Occupational Health, and a world-expert on scaling up[42] we are now optimistic that the tools produced will be successfully used not only in local pockets, but on national and international scale. authors' contributions AY and EAB conceived these projects and created the first draft of this manuscript.
