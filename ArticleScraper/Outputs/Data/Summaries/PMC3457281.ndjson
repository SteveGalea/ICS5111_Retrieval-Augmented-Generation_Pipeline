{"summary": "hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive-strand RNA virus that establishes a chronic infection in 85% of infected individuals. the 9.6-kb genome is translated into a single polyprotein that is then cleaved into 10 structural and nonstructural proteins. the recent development of an infectious cell culture system for HCV has allowed detailed analyses of the molecular mechanisms of virus replication. mechanistic link between induction of the UPR and induction of autophagy has not yet been defined. the induction of autophagy by HCV is independent of the induction of the UPR, suggesting that these processes are mechanistically distinct. 105 cells seeded into a 12-well plate were transfected with 1 g RNA. luciferase activity was measured by lysing cells in passive lysis buffer (PLB; Promega) and analyzing them by using a luminometer following the manufacturer's instructions. a total volume of 30 l was amplified using a TaqMan reverse transcription kit. the products were denatured at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. 10 l of product was amplified by PCR under standard conditions. 105 cells seeded into a 12-well plate were transfected with 1 g RNA. luciferase activity was measured by lysing cells in passive lysis buffer (PLB; Promega) and analyzing them by using a luminometer following the manufacturer's instructions. the products were denatured at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, and 10 l of product was amplified by PCR. for virus infection, medium removed from cells previously transfected with appropriate in vitro-transcribed virus RNA was clarified by centrifugation at 2,000 g for 5 min. induction of the UPR was measured by two assays: first, Western blotting of the transcription factor CHOP. second, an RT-PCR assay for the splicing of xbp1 mRNA by the ER membrane-anchored endoribonuclease Ire1. spliced xbp1 mRNA was also robustly detectable at both 48 and 72 hpi. mock-infected cells were treated with tunicamycin (Tm) for 4 h prior to harvest. a mutant form of this RNA showed a marked reduction in the ability to induce the UPR, while fully retaining the ability to induce the UPR. both JFH-1 (lane 3) and FK5.1 (lane 5) SGR-harboring cells exhibited an accumulation of LC3-II. however, neither SGR cell line exhibited any detectable UPR. this was judged by a lack of both CHOP expression and xbp1 mRNA splicing. neomycin phosphotransferase or RT-PCR analysis of the GBV-B sequence. we compared LC3-II abundances in FK5.1 SGR-harboring cells and in nave Huh7.5 cells in which autophagy was induced by a physiological stimulus, i.e., amino acid starvation. PCR detection of GBV-B RNA correlated with an elevation of LC3-II levels. the cells were either mock transfected or transfected with wild-type or GND SGR-luc-JFH-1 (38) RNA (2 g) by use of lipofectin. LC3-II did not accumulate significantly in cells transfected with the GND SGR. neither CHOP expression nor xbp1 mRNA splicing was observed in any of the cells at any time point. treatment with tunicamycin was able to effectively induce the UPR. inhibition of the UPR does not block HCV genome replication. we did not expect to see a complete abrogation of CHOP expression following Ire1 silencing. we used a bicistronic JFH-1 SGR expressing a neomycin phosphotransferase-luciferase fusion protein (JFH-1-Feo) (43) to assess the effect of Ire1 ablation on HCV RNA replication. both NS5A and luciferase expression were judged by reductions in both NS5A and luciferase expression. inhibition of cyclophilins would likely result in accumulation of unfolded proteins within the cell. the induction of autophagy by HCV is independent of Ire1 and the UPR. the induction of autophagy by HCV is independent of Ire1 and the UPR. luciferase expression and E2 expression were reduced. ectopic expression of GFP-LC3 has been reported to lead to incorporation of the fusion protein into insoluble cytoplasmic aggregates (17, 19), potentially confounding any interpretation of the data. we analyzed subcellular distribution of autophagosomes and HCV replication complexes by an indirect coimmunofluorescence assay using antibodies to endogenous LC3 and NS5A. a major increase in expression of core, E2, and NS5A was observed between 24 and 48 h postinfection (hpi) the induction of the UPR was measured by two assays: first, Western blotting of the transcription factor CHOP, and second, an RT-PCR assay. spliced xbp1 mRNA was also robustly detectable at both 48 and 72 hpi. mock-infected cells showed no evidence of either autophagy or the UPR at 72 hpi. tunicamycin treatment also induced LC3-II accumulation. mock-infected cells were treated with tunicamycin (Tm) for 4 h prior to harvest. lane 9 cells electroporated with JFH-1 RNA or the E1-E2 derivative were harvested at 72 hpt. mRNA splicing was not due to an SGR-induced inhibition of UPR induction or a defect resulting from the selection of SGR-harboring Huh7 cells. treatment with tunicamycin resulted in both CHOP and spliced xbp1 mRNA. LC3-II levels were significantly higher in FK5.1 SGR-harboring cells than in starved Huh7.5 cells. leupeptin treatment resulted in a further increase in LC3-II abundance. this suggests that the accumulation of LC3-II in both cases was most likely due to stimulation of autophagosome generation rather than to a block to autophagic flux and protein degradation. hepaciviruses transfected Huh7.5 cells with a luciferase-containing SGR (SGR-luc-JFH-1) or a replication-defective GND mutant derivative. in our hands electroporation alone resulted in an elevation of basal LC3-II accumulation as early as 4 h postelectroporation (hpt) treatment with tunicamycin was able to effectively induce the UPR. inhibition of the UPR does not block HCV genome replication. siRNA-mediated ablation of LC3, ATG4B, ATG7, or Beclin-1 expression results in a reduction of virus RNA accumulation. a bicistronic JFH-1 SGR expressing a neomycin phosphotransferase-luciferase fusion protein (JFH-1-Feo) was transfected with either a scrambled control or an Ire1-targeted siRNA. there was no effect on either NS5A or luciferase expression, even under conditions of efficient ablation of Ire1 expression. inhibition of cyclophilins would likely result in accumulation of unfolded proteins within the cell. the activation of both UPR and autophagy was not dependent on the presence of the SGR, as it was also seen in nave Huh7 cells. re1 silencing resulted in a modest reduction of both luciferase expression and E2 expression. however, despite this reduction, the induction of autophagy by HCV does not involve the UPR. NS5A staining revealed an extensive punctate distribution throughout the cytoplasm. LC3 puncta were more numerous in Huh7 cells either stably harboring the SGR or infected with JFH-1 than in the parental or uninfected cells. a time course analysis of virus infection revealed that autophagy was a very early response, occurring within 4 h, whereas the UPR was apparent only at 48 h or more postinfection. a time course analysis of virus infection revealed that autophagy was a very early response, occurring within 4 h, whereas the UPR was apparent only at 48 h or more postinfection. NS4B expression alone is able to induce autophagy via interactions with the early endosome-associated GTPase Rab5 and a class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Vps34 (34); additionally, NS5B has been reported to interact with ATG5 (12). however, our observation that autophagy is induced very early after infection (4 h), at least 20 h prior to the detectable expression of the nonstructural proteins. TRIF and MAVS (21, 23), NS4B, NS5B, and/or other nonstructural proteins could act to maintain autophagy. an additional question relates to why HCV might induce autophagy. a number of recent studies have alluded to a role for the induction of autophagy in the suppression of the innate immune response. a more detailed analysis is warranted and most likely should involve electron microscopic visualization of autophagosomes and sites of HCV replication. the precise mechanisms by which this induction is effected and the implications of autophagy for the virus life cycle remain to be elucidated."}
