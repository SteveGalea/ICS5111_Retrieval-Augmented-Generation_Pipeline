{"summary": "VTE is a common medical condition which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) PE is a major public health problem with a high incidence, mortality, misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis rate. inherited risk factors for VTE are rare and mainly consist of loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding anticoagulant proteins. infection is a risk factor for VTE, raising the possibility that disordered immune function may be a contributory factor by facilitating infection. an A/H1N1 influenza infection model was established to compare the pulmonary thrombosis in 6 groups of infected mice with different immune statuses. chromosomal location and genomic structure of the exons encoding the open reading frame of PRF1 and HTR2A mutations of the VTE family. a. the genealogical tree of the VTE family. + indicates family members. the proband\u2019s mother (I:2) died of natural causes at the age of 80. the proband\u2019s older brother (II:1) died of cerebral infarction at the age of 37. sequence reads which could not be aligned to target regions were filtered out and duplicate reads were further removed by SAMtools software. Variations including single nucleotide variation (SNV) as well as small insertion and deletion (Indel, 10 bp) were called. CAT (Reverse) for PRF1, TGGACACGGGCATGACAAGGA (Forward), and AGCTCAACTACGAACTCCCTACCTT (Reverse) for ABCC8, respectively. examination of differentiation antigens on immune cells 2 ml of fasting venous blood was obtained from 8 members in the morning. chromosomal location and genomic structure of the exons encoding the open reading frame of PRF1. the PRF1 R357W mutation locates in the MACPF domain of protein. the mutated sequence is shown in white. the proband\u2019s older sister (II:3) presented with right leg swelling at the age of 58. the other older sister (II:7) presented with left lower extremity edema at the age of 56. the variations should meet the following criteria: mapping quality 40, SNV quality 20, Indel quality 50 and 5 reads covered. the SNVs identified were further filtered by dbSNP 137, HapMap database and 1000 Genomes databases. to remove known SNVs and variants remained were considered to be \u2018novel\u2019 SNVs. examination of differentiation antigens on immune cells 2 ml of fasting venous blood was obtained from 8 members in the morning, and then the sample was added into the ET tube. the differentiation antigens on the immune cells including CD3 +, CD4 +, CD8 +, CD19 and CD16 + 56 + in 8 members of the VTE family. only 15 SNVs were shared by 3 affected patients (II:3, II:7 and II:9). mutations of PRF1, HTR2A, and ABCC8 predicted to be functionally damaged to their encoded proteins. a CLUSTALW analysis was performed on orthogous of the PRF1 of different mammal species. a CLUSTALW analysis was performed on orthogous of the PRF1 of different mammal species. the conclusion drawn is that the R357 residue is conserved in evolution and has never been observed to be mutated. exome sequencing was performed on 3 affected individuals (II:3, II:7 and II:9) and 5 unaffected members (II:5, III:1, III:2, III:3 and III:4) in the VTE family. an average of 5.5 Gb (110-folds of the target region) raw sequencing data was generated per individual. mutation annotation databases identified ABCC8 R298C mutation in one of 100 ethnically matched control individuals, suggesting it is unlikely to be a pathogenic mutation of VTE. mutations in 3 genes predicted to be damaging shared by 3 affected individuals. expression of differentiation antigens on immune cells and complements was detected in 8 members of the VTE family. it showed that the number of NK cells was decreased, the levels of CD8, C3 and C4 were in the normal range, and the level of CH50 was significantly increased in these members. PRF1 R357W mutation PRF1 gene encodes a protein of 555 amino acids. the protein is a key effector molecule for T-cell- and killer-cell-mediated cytolysis. exome sequence of 8 members from a four-generation Han Chinese family with VTE. mutations of PRF1 gene located in chromosome 10 and HTR2A gene located in chromosome 13 predicted functional derangement of their encoded proteins. the R357W mutation of PRF1 gene and the V95I mutation of HTR2A were detected in the 3 affected members but not in another 5 normal members of the family. the risk of VTE significantly increased after acute infection, and infection might be the trigger of VTE. this raises the question of what determines whether any given infection will result in VTE. the HTR2A encodes one of the receptors for 5-HT. it consists of 3 exons encoding 471 amino acids. 90% of the human body\u2019s 5-HT is produced and distributed in enterochromaffin cells."}
