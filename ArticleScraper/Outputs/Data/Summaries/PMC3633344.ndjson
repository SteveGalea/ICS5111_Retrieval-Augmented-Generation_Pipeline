{"summary": "endothelial cells (ECs) are mesoderm-derived cells that form the luminal surface of the cardiovascular system. ECs are always polarised with a specialised apical, luminal surface covered by a glycocalyx. they are basally anchored to the basement membrane. in human ECs, the presence of von Willebrand factor is the most unique feature of ECs. but the vital importance and disseminated structure of the circulatory system means virtually any disease involves the EC to some extent. a number of viral infections have been found. infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) replicates mainly in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) ECs and attaches to RBC surfaces, causing severe anaemia, ascites, haemorrhages and high cumulative mortality in farmed Atlantic salmon. ISAV-infected ASK-II cells in 96-well plates were used for primary screening of hybridoma supernatants using indirect immunofluorescent (IFAT) labelling. cells were given a dose resulting in 20% infected cells. nes were immediately subcloned twice by the limited dilution method in 96-well culture plates. monoclonal antibody class and subclass were determined by an ELISA-based mouse Ig Isotyping Kit. HI test was performed as previously described. heparinised blood from Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout and cow was centrifuged at 1400 g for 10 min. heparinised blood from 71 other species including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and several different fish species were isolated. immunohistochemical labelling was performed on formalin-fixed tissue sections. sections were de-waxed in xylene and hydrated in graded alcohols. non-specific blocking was performed by incubation with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; pH 7.6) for 20 min. cell cultures on 13-mm coverslips, cytospot preparations, cryostat sections and RBC-preparations were fixed in either 80% acetone in ddH2O or 10% buffered formalin for 10 min. labelling was performed on ISAV-infected cell cultures or cryostat sections from ISAV-infected salmon. labelling was performed with ISAV HE antigen (100 HAU mL1), MAb to ISAV HE (Falk et al. 1998) and an HRP-conjugated, anti-mouse, Ig-amplified detection system (EnVision) with DAB substrate. tissue sections were pre-incubated with MAb 10E4 for 30 min, followed by modified virus histochemistry using MAb to ISAV HE. BS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (pH 7.6) for 30 min. incubation with rabbit anti-mouse Ig/HPR (DAKO) diluted 1/1000 for 60 min and DAB substrate (Sigma), resulting in brown-coloured precipitate at the binding site. primary screening of hybridomas was performed using indirect immunofluorescent (IFAT) labelling. positive clones were immediately subcloned twice by the limited dilution method in 96-well culture plates. the slides were air-dried for 2 h at room temperature and stored at 80 \u00b0C until assayed. all fish were anaesthetised with methane tricaine sulphonate (MS222, Sigma, 0.1 mg mL1) before handling. archived, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues collected from ISAV-infected Atlantic salmon. the solution was centrifuged at 1400 g for 2 min and the supernatant saved. the pellet was dissolved in a small volume of MET buffer and frozen at 80 \u00b0C. immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemical labelling was performed on formalin-fixed tissue sections. the sections were subjected to combined treatment starting with saponification followed by sialidase, which will enable the sialidase to remove O-acetylated sialic acids. the preparation was centrifuged prior to being overlaid the tissue sections. e IgM and Alexa Fluor\u00ae 596 anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit Ig were used for detection. labels were performed with ISAV HE antigen (100 HAU mL1), MAb to ISAV HE (Falk et al. 1998) and an HRP-conjugated, anti-mouse, Ig-amplified detection system. PVDF membranes were immunolabelled immediately after blotting. non-specific binding sites were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk (Nestl\u00e9) for 30 min. MAb was added and incubated for 60 min, followed by incubation with rabbit anti-mouse Ig/HPR (DAKO) diluted 1/1000 for 60 min and DAB substrate (Sigma) the endothelium of the central vein, the hepatic artery and the portal veins in the liver were positive, as were the sinusoids, whereas the bile duct epithelium and the hepatocytes were negative. the haematopoietic tissue in the anterior kidney and the scavenger ECs labelled positive with a reticular labelling pattern. liver with labelled vessel endothelium and sinusoidal walls (arrow) Gills with labelled endothelial cells (ECs) including pillar cells (arrow); F = filament, L = lamella. anterior kidney with labelled vessel endothelium, glomerular (G) (arrow) capillaries and peritubular ECs; T = tubuli. labelling of cell cultures investigated with a fluorescent microscope shows the ISAV-permissive cell cultures SHK-1, ASK-II and TO positive to MAb labelling. the labelling appears to be associated with the surface; however, cytoplasmic, nuclear or Golgi labelling cannot be excluded. other cell cultures tested (i.e. BF-2 and CHSE) were negative. the MAb with ASK-II cell culture suspension almost abolished the labelling reaction. pre-incubation of sections with ISAV HE-antigen followed by MAb immunohistochemistry resulted in a normal labelling pattern. other cell cultures (i.e. CHSE, BF-2 and EPC) were negative. the sections were subjected to a combined treatment of saponification followed by sialidase treatment. this saponification renders the O-acetylated sialic acids susceptible to sialidase treatment. the combined treatment abolished the labelling. reticular labelling pattern seen with virus histochemistry in the gill ILT and the thymus is not visible with MAb labelling. immunohistochemistry with MAb 10E4 (A\u2013D) and ISA virus histochemistry (E\u2013H) shows co-localisation of MAb marker and ISAV receptor in heart (A,E) and anterior kidney (B,F) large flat cells labelled strongly positive for the MAb did not initially become infected by ISAV. however, at 48 h p.i. the smaller, rounder cells had also become infected by ISAV. the MAb was determined to be IgM and (kappa) chain-positive. it binds to Atlantic salmon ECs, RBCs and a small fraction of Percoll gradient isolated cells. epithelial cells and parenchymal cells were negative. bile duct epithelium and hepatocytes were negative. other organs tested showed the same endothelial and RBC labelling pattern. these included gonads, brain, skin, muscle, pseudo branch and eye. cytospots (isolated blood leucocytes) were investigated using immunofluorescent labelling. all RBCs tested positive. Approximately 3\u20135% of the leucocyte-like cells in cytospot preparations tested positive for the MAb. 71 other species tested positive for the MAb on ECs and RBCs. only Grayling (Thymallus thymallus) and Spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) tested positive for the MAb. pre-incubation of sections with ISAV HE-antigen followed by MAb immunohistochemistry resulted in a normal labelling pattern. MAb 10E4 binds to an epitope linked to a 4-O-acetylated sialic acid species. a combined treatment abolished the labelling, indicating that the MAb binding epitope is associated with a 4-O-acetylated sialic acid species. 0.1 N NaOH and 0.1 N NaOH co-localise with expression of the ISAV receptor. the receptor expression pattern closely mirrored the pattern seen with the MAb. MAb 10E4-positive cells co-localise with ISAV-infected cells. in the cryostat sections we found that all infected cells were MAb-positive. in the ISAV-infected ASK-II cell cultures, at 24 h post-infection, the large flat cells labelled strongly positive for the MAb. study characterises novel monoclonal antibody (MAb 10E4) that binds to a carbohydrate epitope related to a 4-O-acetylated sialic acid species. the MAb bound to all types of endothelium in the circulatory system including arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules and veins as well as endocardial cells covering the lumenal surface of the heart muscle. haematopoietic stem cells develop from haemogenic endothelium of the embryonic dorsal aorta. this could explain why ECs and RBCs share the epitope of the MAb. however, the ontogeny of haematopoietic cells and endothelium has been elusive due to its stepwise and complex nature. the labelling pattern in lymphoid organs such as thymus and gill ILT supports the notion that the labelled cells in the cytospots are not necessarily leucocytes. in contrast, extensive labelling was demonstrated by virus histochemistry detecting 4-O-acetylated sialic acids in both thymus and gill ILT. this suggests that the virus histochemistry may detect different 4-O-acetylated species in comparison with the ECs and RBCs are the main target cells of ISAV in Atlantic salmon. the same study showed that ECs, RBCs and some epithelial cells expressed the ISAV receptor molecule, 4-O-acetylated sialic acid, on the cell surface. the MAb can be used for immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis. the epitope of the MAb is associated with the ISAV receptor. the MAb may enable the separation and further analysis of existing cell cultures from Atlantic salmon. authors declare that they have no conflict of interest. 1.docx (19.2KB, docx)."}
