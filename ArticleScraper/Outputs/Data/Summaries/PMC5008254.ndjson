{"summary": "neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common cancer in the first years of life. the survival of patients with high-risk disease has not improved. the survival of patients with high-risk disease has not improved. some c-myc-amplified cancer cell lines are highly susceptible to VSV-induced cell killing. c-myc negatively regulates type I IFN signaling through STAT-1. this is one of the mechanisms of pathogenesis in burkitt\u2019s lymphoma and uveal melanoma. we first used human-derived high-risk NB cell lines consisting of N-myc-amplified neuroblastic (N) cells (IMR-5, IMR-32, and LAN-1) and non N-myc-amplified substrate-adherent (S) cells (SK-N-HS, SK-N-AS, and SH-EP) to test this hypothesis. after infection with VSVM51 (MOI of 0.5) for 1 hour at RT, cells were washed five times with serum-free medium followed by incubation in modified Eagle\u2019s medium. titers were expressed as numbers of pfu/1 105 cells (y axis) (a) NB cell lines are well known to differ genetically, phenotypically, biochemically and in their tumorigenic capacity. TET-21N cells express nearly undetectable levels of N-myc in the presence of doxycycline (low N-myc), while withdrawal of this antibiotic induces its overexpression (high N-myc) TET-21N (high N-myc) had significantly faster cell killing kinetics than TET-21N (low N-myc) cell killing kinetics did not change in TET-21C (dox +, Figure 1f) these data suggest that N-myc expression can further sensitize NB cells to virus-induced cell killing. IFN- levels increased in the TET-21 cells in response to infection, except for TET-21C (dox -) however, the increased levels of this cytokine did not differ significantly to basal levels (P > 0.05) in contrast, endogenous levels of IFN- significantly increased in TET-21N (low N-myc) and TET-21C (dox -/+) did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) scription of type I IFNs was detected upon infection and stimulation with extracellular poly I:C in TET-21N (high and low N-myc) but not in TET-21C cells (Dox-/+) cells were seeded in 24-well plates and either treated or not with 1 g/ml doxycycline (dox) for 48 hours. NB cell lines were either infected with VSVM51 at MOI of 0.1 for 12 hours or treated with exogenous (200 U/ml) for 16 hours (d). Error bars indicate mean standard deviation of the mean from three replicates. intracellular poly I:C was not included in the analysis due to its poor induction of the Jak/STAT signaling in TET-21 cells. basal levels of STATs 1 and 2 and their phosphorylated forms, before infection, were similar between TET-21N (high N-myc) and TET-21N (low N-myc) levels of IRF-9, on the other hand, were slightly lower in TET-21N (high N-myc) virus infection did not cause significant changes in expression of STATs 1 and 2. levels of IRF-9 slightly increased in IMR-32 (N-myc-amplified) and SH-EP (non-N-myc-amplified) in response to infection. TET-21 cells were either pretreated or not with 1 g/ml doxycycline (Dox +/-) and incubated for 48 hours. cells were then treated with either 200 U/ml IFN- (a,b) or extracellular poly I:C (c,d) for 6 and 12 hours, respectively, followed by virus infection at multiplicity of infection. conditioned media from SK-N-AS cells infected with VSVM51 at 18 hpi. extracellular poly I:C activated the Jak/STAT signaling more efficiently than intracellular poly I:C. cells were incubated in modified Eagle\u2019s medium (reduced serum) for 6 hours. cells were then incubated in fresh DMEM medium without serum for another 12 hours. concentrated conditioned media from infected TET-21N did not protect SK-N-AS from virus-induced cell killing. these findings further support the negative role of N-myc on the establishment of the antiviral state. infections at MOI of 0.5 for 18 hours were most suitable for microarray analysis. a total of 60 and 670 probe sets were identified in TET-21N (low N-myc) and TET-21N (high N-myc), respectively, in response to infection. these data suggest that the higher number of changes in TET-21N (high N-myc) in response to infection seems to correlate to the increased susceptibility to virus-induced cell killing. al IRF-9 was slightly lower in TET-21N (high N-myc) than TET-21N (low N-myc), which is consistent with the microarray data. other ISGs that are negative regulators of IFN signaling with potential proviral functions were also found downregulated such as NMI and IFI-35. al58 IFNAR1 IFN receptor 1 1.5 Antiviral59 IFI27L2 Interferon, -inducible protein 27-like 2 1.9 Probably antiviral c-myc v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (avian) 18.8 Antiviral60; proviral17 N-myc-independent regulation of ISGs upon infection Infection of cells with VSVM51 up and downregulated the expression of 2 and function for KRT1761 BANF1 Barrier to autointegration factor 1 1.8 1.5 Proviral62 BTN3A1 /// butyrophilin, subfamily 3, member A2 1.8 1.6 Unknown STK35 Serine/threonine kinase 35 1.9 1.7 Unknown DDR1 Discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 1 2.0 1.5 Unknown SPP1 Secreted phosphoprotein 1 4.0 2.0 Antiviral63 Virus 2 1.5 Unknown ZNF230 Zinc finger protein 230 1.5 Unknown PTCH1 Patched 1 1.6 Proviral66 IDS Iduronate 2-sulfatase 1.7 Unknown TET21N (high N-myc) DDIT-3/CHOP DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3 7.2 Antiviral35 and proviral36 IFNA1 IFN-1 3.5 Antiviral10 IFNA13 IFN-13 3.5 Antiviral10 CR 121 probe sets for ISGs were up- and downregulated. most of the identified ISGs have unknown roles on virus replication. DDIT-3/CHOP was the most highly upregulated ISG in response to infection. DDIT-3/CHOP protein was detected at 24 hpi in TET-21N (high N-myc) while undetected in TET-21N (low N-myc) and TET-21C (dox -/+) Tunicamycin treatment robustly induced DDIT-3/CHOP in all cells regardless of N-myc expression status. RNA was extracted and the expression of DDIT-3/CHOP was analyzed by RT-PCR (b). dox (-), no doxycycline added. dox (+), doxycycline added. c-amplified cells (SK-N-SH, SK-N-AS, and SH-EP) were seeded in 35 mm cell culture dishes. the number of cells for each cell line was calculated to achieve 80\u201390% confluency. cells were washed five times with serum-free medium followed by incubation in modified Eagle\u2019s medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. NB cell lines are well known to differ genetically, phenotypically, biochemically and in their tumorigenic capacity. the effects of N-myc on virus replication may have been obscured by cell-type specific differences. we used an isogenic cell system (TET-21C) that allows the exquisite regulation of N-myc by tetracycline addition/removal. TET-21N (high N-myc) had significantly faster cell killing kinetics than TET-21N (low N-myc) cell killing kinetics did not change in TET-21C (dox +, Figure 1f) this data suggest that N-myc expression can further sensitize NB cells to virus-induced cell killing. Detection and quantitation of secreted IFN- was performed at 6, 12, and 18 hpi. IFN- levels increased in the TET-21 cells in response to infection, except for TET-21C (dox -) however, the increased levels of this cytokine did not differ significantly to basal levels. IFN- transcript levels were lower in TET-21N (high and low N-myc) than those in TET-21N (low N-myc) but not in TET-21C cells (Dox-/+) transcript levels were cell-type specific regardless of N-myc amplification status. cells were either infected with VSVM51 at MOI of 0.1 for 12 hours or treated with exogenous (200 U/ml) for 16 hours. phosphorylation status of STAT-1 and -2 was analyzed. intracellular poly I:C was not included in the analysis due to its poor induction of the Jak/STAT signaling in TET-21 cells. basal levels of STATs 1 and 2 and their phosphorylated forms, before infection, were similar between TET-21N (high N-myc) and TET-21N (low N-myc) levels of IRF-9, on the other hand, were slightly lower in TET-21N (high N-myc) lative to TET-21N (low N-myc) and TET-21C (dox-/+) were slightly lower in TET-21N (high N-myc) after treatment with IFN- or poly I:C. these observations suggest that the Jak/STAT signaling is functional regardless of N-myc expression status. TET-21N (low N-myc) and TET-21C (dox -/+) established a robust antiviral state that fully protected cells from virus-induced cell killing. similar effects on the antiviral state in TET-21 cells were observed when treated with poly I:C. conditioned media from poly I:C-treated TET-21 cells infected with VSVM51 at 18 hpi were used as indicators due to their ability to establish a robust antiviral state. extracellular poly I:C activated the Jak/STAT signaling more efficiently than intracellular poly I:C. cells were incubated in DMEM medium with or without poly I:C (10 g/ml) for 6 hours. concentrated conditioned media from poly I:C-treated TET-21N (low N-myc) and TET-21C (dox -/+) established a robust antiviral state. conditioned media from infected TET-21 cells did not protect SK-N-AS from virus-induced cell killing. these findings further support the negative role of N-myc on the establishment of the antiviral state. a total of 60 and 670 probe sets were identified in TET-21N (low N-myc) and TET-21N (high N-myc), respectively, in response to infection. these data suggest that the higher number of changes in TET-21N (high N-myc) in response to infection seems to correlate to the increased susceptibility to virus-induced cell killing. basal IRF-9 was slightly lower in TET-21N (high N-myc) than TET-21N (low N-myc), which is consistent with the microarray data. other ISGs that are negative regulators of IFN signaling with potential proviral functions were also found downregulated such as NMI and IFI-35. e 1 1.8 Antiviral,56 IRF-9 IFN regulatory factor 9 1.8 Antiviral10 NMI N-myc (and STAT) receptor 1 1.5 Antiviral59 IFI27L2 Interferon, -inducible protein 27-like 2 1.9 Probably antiviral c-myc v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (avian) 18.8 Antiviral60; proviral17 N-myc- 575.4 1,048.0 Probably antiviral34 JUP /// KRT17 Junction plakoglobin /// Keratin 17 1.9 1.6 Unknown for JUP. pro- and antiviral functions for these ISGs have been reported. homolog, subfamily B, member 14 1.5 Proviral65 SH3BGRL2 SH3 domain binding glutamic acid-rich protein like 2 1.5 Unknown ZNF230 Zinc finger protein 230 1.5 Unknown PTCH1 Patched 1 1.6 Proviral66 IDS Iduronate 2-sulfatase 1.7 Unknown TET21N (high N-myc) DDIT-3/CHOP DNA-damage-inducible transcript 3 7.2 Antiviral35 and pro antiviral74 TRIM-32 Tripartite motif containing 37 1.7 Antiviral74 TRIM-32 Tripartite motif containing 32 2.1 Antiviral69 TRIM-13 Tripartite motif containing 13 2.3 Proviral and antiviral75 MAT2A Methionine adenosyltransferase II. proviral role on VSV replication76 Virus-mediated regulation of ISGs in TET-21N (high N DDIT-3/CHOP protein was detected at 24 hpi in TET-21N (high N-myc) and undetected in TET-21N (low N-myc) Upon virus infection, DDIT-3/CHOP protein was detected at 24 hpi in TET-21N (high N-myc) and TET-21C (dox -/+) NB cell lines were either infected at MOI of 0.1 or treated with tunicamycin for 15 hours. RNA was extracted and the expression of DDIT-3/CHOP was analyzed by western blot (a). RNA was extracted and the expression of DDIT-3/CHOP was analyzed by RT-PCR (b). dox (-), no doxycycline added. SK-N-AS cells were not protected by conditioned media from infected TET-21C cells. some validated hits such as c-myc45 and some Wnt signaling pathway genes46 were consistent with our microarray data. little is known about the role of MYC oncoprotein family on susceptibility of cancer cells to OVs. treatment with exogenous IFN- or poly I:C caused significant changes in the expression and phosphorylation levels of these proteins regardless of N-myc expression status. however, our western blot and microarray data suggest that N-myc overexpression does not affect the IFN signaling through Jak/STAT pathway directly but rather the expression of some ISGs stimulated by this pathway. significant changes in global gene expression were observed in TET-21N (low N-myc) differential changes in global gene expression driven by N-myc are likely to occur during the whole replication cycle and virus spread. DDIT-3/CHOP was the most highly upregulated ISG in TET-21N (high N-myc) in response to infection. non-ISGs consisted on genes that were not found in the interferome database. we decided to focus our analysis on these genes. the observed differences in virus replication and virus-induced cell killing can also be attributed to non-ISGs with various cellular functions. cell lines IMR-5, IMR-32, LAN-1, SK-N-SH, SK-N-AS, SH-EP, TET-21N, and TET-21 control cells (TET-21C) were maintained in DMEM tissue culture medium (Life Technologies), supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technologies), 1% L-glutamine (Life Technologies) at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. TET-21C harbor the same repressible system except that exogenous N-myc gene is not present. transfections with poly I:C above 10 ng/well had toxic effects for TET-21N. NB cells were treated with 10\u201320 g/ml extracellular poly I:C. non-N-myc-amplified cells were transfected with 0.1 g poly I:C. transfections beyond 0.1 g poly I:C had toxic effects on these cells. all protein preparations were quantified (BCA protein assay, Biolynx, Brockville, ON, Canada), run in 10% polyacrilmyde gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. membranes were incubated with monoclonal antibodies to N-myc (EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), STATs 1 and 2, phospho-STAT-1 Y701 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), actin (EMD Millipore), RIG- supernatants were removed and replaced with 10 g/ml poly I:C. cells were incubated for another 12 hours. supernatants were harvested, centrifuged and either four times concentrated or not. RNA for each sample with a RIN higher than 9 was labeled with 3\u2019 IVT Express Kit (Ambion) and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Human PrimeView Arrays at 45 \u00b0C for 16 hours. Arrays were stained and washed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G System. doxycycline at 1 g/ml was added to culture medium for TET-21N and TET21C cells. VSVM51, a genetically modified VSV strain derived from the Indiana serotype of VSV, was propagated on BHK cells. doxycycline were infected with VSVM51 at MOI of 0.1 for 6, 12, and 18 hpi. transfections with poly I:C above 10 ng/well had toxic effects for TET-21N (low N-myc) cell culture supernatants were harvested, pulsed to remove cell debris. non-N-myc-amplified cells were transfected with 0.1 g poly I:C. transfections beyond 0.1 g poly I:C had toxic effects on these cells. cells were incubated with extracellular (10 g/ml in reduced serum medium) for 12 hours. monoclonal antibodies to N-myc (EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), STATs 1 and 2, phospho-STAT-1 Y701 (Abcam, Cambridge, Germany), actin (EMD Millipore), RIG-I (Novous Biologicals, Littleton, CO) and polyclonal antibodies to IRF-9, phospho-STAT-1 (S727) and phospho-STAT-2 (Y690) were used as secondary antibodies. SK-N-AS was cultured in conditioned media or regular DMEM medium (10% FBS) overnight followed by infection (MOI of 5 for 48 hours) before use, conditioned media from virus-infected cells (18 hpi, MOI of 0.5) were UV-irradiated for 5 minutes to inactivate virus. analysis of variance, P 0.05, was applied as statistically significant. ISGs were identified using the interferon database V2.32 Differential expression of DDIT-3/CHOP Cells were infected with 0.5 for 12, 18, and 24 hours."}
