{"summary": "intracellular concentration of free Zn2+ is maintained at a relatively low level by metallothioneins, likely due to the fact that Zn2+ can serve as intracellular second messenger. in cell culture studies, high Zn2+ concentrations and the addition of compounds that stimulate cellular import of Zn2+, such as hinokitol (HK), pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and PT, were found to inhibit the replication of various RNA viruses zinc-ionophore pyrithione (PT) in combination with Zn2+ is a potent inhibitor of the replication of SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and equine arteritis virus. nidoviruses include major pathogens of humans and livestock. the common ancestry of nidoviruses is reflected in their similar genome organization and expression strategy. nidovirus RTC subunits and RNA synthesis are directly affected by Zn2+. we used in vitro recombinant RdRp assays to directly study the effect of zinc ions on the RdRps of SARS-CoV and EAV. PT and Zn2+ have similar effect on nidoviruses in nidoviruses. reporter viruses express green fluorescent proteins (GFP), i.e., EAV-GFP [29] and SARS-CoV-GFP. the zinc ionophore pyrithione inhibits nidovirus replication in cell culture. the zinc ionophore pyrithione inhibits nidovirus replication. the zinc ionophore pyrithione inhibits nidovirus replication. one hour post infection (h p.i.), between 0 and 32 M of PT and 0, 1, or 2 M ZnOAc2 were added to the culture medium. at 17 h p.i., a time point at which GFP expression in untreated infected cells reaches its maximum for both viruses, cells were fixed, and GFP fluorescence was quantified. this effect was significantly enhanced when 2 M of Zn2+ was added to the medium. 59 and 164 were calculated for SARS-CoV and EAV respectively. Zn2+ inhibits the RNA-synthesizing activity of isolated nidovirus RTCs. RTC reactions were started in the presence of 500 M Zn2+. after 30 min, these reactions were split into two aliquots. magnesium-saturated EDTA (MgEDTA) was added to one of the tubes to a final concentration of 1 mM. this effect was not due to chelation of the Zn2+ already present in the post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) of SARS-CoV-infected cells. this increase was not observed when MgEDTA was added to a control reaction without additional Zn2+. mer polyU template incorporated [-32P]AMP into RNA products of up to 18 nt in length. initiation was de novo, which is in line with previous observations. in vitro activity of the SARS-CoV RdRp nsp12 - which lacks a priming loop - was shown to be strictly primer-dependent. SARS-CoV nsp12 RdRp assays were performed with an RNA duplex with a 5\u2032 U10 overhang as template. Error bars represent standard error of the mean (n = 3) addition of ZnOAc2 to RdRp assays resulted in a strong dose-dependent inhibition of enzymatic activity for both the EAV and SARS-CoV enzyme. inhibition of the SARS-CoV RdRp was reversible as well. nsp12 incorporated 405% of the label during a standard 60-min reaction. this was slightly lower than expected yield and may be caused by elevated Mg2+ concentration. close inspection of the RdRp assays revealed a less pronounced effect of Zn2+ on the generation of full-length 18-nt products. this suggests that Zn2+ specifically inhibited the initiation step of EAV RNA synthesis. this suggests that Zn2+ does not affect the elongation phase of EAV RNA synthesis. an in vitro RTC assay with isolated EAV and SARS-CoV RTCs was allowed to initiate with unlabeled NTPs (initiation) after 30 min, [-32P]CTP was added (pulse), the reaction was split into two equal volumes, and Zn2+ was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM to one of the tubes. a pulse with a low concentration of [-32P]ATP was followed by a chase in the presence of 50 M of unlabeled ATP. this increased processivity and allowed us to study elongation. the results of these experiments were in accord with those obtained with isolated RTCs. absence of Zn2+ no longer occurred (Fig. 7D, right panel) an EAV RdRp reaction was initiated in the presence of [-32P]ATP. after 20 min, the reaction was split into two equal volumes. a chase with 50 M unlabeled ATP was performed on both reactions. electromobility shift assays performed in the presence and absence of Zn2+. to measure binding affinity of the RdRp for the template, we determined the fraction of bound template at various protein concentrations. we also observed a 3\u20134 fold reduction in RNA binding when Zn2+ was present in the assay. nsp8 has demonstrated RNA and DNA binding activity [32] using this assay. it remains unclear why we are not able to detect binding of recombinant EAV nsp9 to an RNA template. nidovirus replication in vivo Zinc ions are involved in many different cellular processes. treatment with PT of concentrations up to 32 M in combination with 4 M ZnOAc2 did not reduce the viability of mock-infected cells after 18 h. incubation of cells for 18 h with the combinations of PT and Zn2+ mentioned above, followed by a 2-h metabolic labeling, revealed no change in overall cellular protein synthesis. effect of PT and Zn2+ on the GFP fluorescence in vero-E6 cells infected with a reporter strain at 17 h p.i. data were normalized to GFP expression in untreated control cells (100%). a time point at which GFP expression in untreated infected cells reaches its maximum for both viruses, cells were fixed. the combination of 2 M PT and 2 M ZnOAc2 resulted in a 981% and 853% reduction of the GFP signal for EAV-GFP and SARS-CoV-GFP respectively. no cytotoxicity was observed for this combination of PT and ZnOAc2 concentrations. a dose-dependent decrease in the amount of RNA synthesized was observed when ZnOAc2 was present. for both viruses, a more than 50% reduction of overall RNA-synthesis was observed at a Zn2+ concentration of 50 M. less than 5% activity remained at a Zn2+ concentration of 500 M. compared to the untreated control, the EAV RTC assay produced approximately 30% less RNA. this was consistent with the 30% shorter reaction time after the addition of the MgEDTA. this effect was not due to chelation of the Zn2+ already present in the post-nuclear supernatant of SARS-CoV-infected cells. nidovirus RdRp activity affects in vitro activity of recombinant nidovirus RdRps. nidovirus RdRp activity may be due to a direct effect of Zn2+ on nidovirus RdRp activity. in vitro activity of the nsp12 mutant was shown to be primer-dependent. EAV and SARS-CoV RdRp assays with wild-type enzyme and active-site mutants showed greatly reduced [-32P]AMP incorporation in our assays. both mutants showed greatly reduced [-32P]AMP incorporation in our assays, confirming once again that the radiolabeled RNA products derived from nidovirus. ted with 6 mM Zn2+, a concentration that consistently gave >95% inhibition. after 30 min, 8 mM MgEDTA was added to both a control reaction and the reaction inhibited with ZnOAc2. the inhibition of the SARS-CoV RdRp could be reversed by chelation of Zn2+. reactions containing 6 mM Zn2+ (samples 3 and 4) were incubated for 30 min. both reactions were split into two aliquots and 6 mM MgEDTA was added. all reactions were incubated for an additional 30 min. the effect of Zn2+ on RNA synthesis by SARS-CoV RTCs was not limited to initiation, but appeared to impair the elongation phase. the addition of Zn2+ completely blocked further incorporation of [-32P]CMP when added 40 min after the start of the reaction. nsp12 mainly produced very short (2\u20133 nt long) abortive RNA products and only a fraction of full length products. this allowed us to separately study the effect of Zn2+ on initiation and elongation. reactions shown in Fig. 7B, the low processivity of the EAV RdRp, and the substrate competition between the remaining [-32P]ATP and the unlabeled ATP were small. the addition of Zn2+ to a SARS-CoV RdRp reaction also blocked elongation, since extension of the radiolabeled primer no longer occurred. reaction products formed at the chase times indicated above the lanes in the presence and absence of Zn2+. the length of the reaction products in nt is indicated next to the gel (p is the primer length) the length of the reaction products in nt is indicated next to the gel. nsp12 revealed a 3\u20134 fold reduction in the percentage of bound RNA in the presence of zinc ions (grey) relative to the percentage of bound RNA in the absence of zinc ions (black) Error bars represent standard error of the mean (n = 3). nsp9 did not bind RNA in pull-down experiments with Talon-beads, His6-tagged nsp9, and various short RNA templates including polyU. PT and PDTC have previously been described as potent inhibitors of various RNA viruses. the combination of 2 M PT and 2 M Zn2+ effectively inhibited their replication, while not causing detectable cytoxicity. the inhibitory effect of Zn2+ on the replication of picornaviruses appeared to be due to interference with viral polyprotein processing. addition of Zn2+ following initiation of EAV RNA synthesis had little or no effect on NTP incorporation in molecules whose synthesis had already been initiated in the absence of Zn2+. therefore, Zn2+ appears to be a specific inhibitor of the initiation phase of EAV RNA synthesis. however, Zn2+ inhibited SARS-CoV RdRp activity also during the elongation phase of RNA synthesis. inhibition of nidovirus RTCs and RdRp activity by Zn2+ was even observed at low concentrations and in the presence of a more than 25-fold excess of Mg2+. a predicted structure for nsp12 is presently unavailable, but a predicted structure that represents the C-terminal two-thirds of the enzyme has been published [31]. the zinc-ionophore PT effectively inhibits nidovirus replication in cell culture. the combination of zinc ions and the zinc-ionophore PT effectively inhibits nidovirus replication in cell culture. this provides an interesting basis for further studies into the use of zinc-ionophores as antiviral compounds. BHK-21 or Vero-E6 cells were seeded in transparent or black (low fluorescence) 96-well clusters at 10,000 cells per well. the next day, cells were seeded in transparent or black (low fluorescence) 96-well clusters at 10,000 cells per well. RNA duplex SAV557R/SAV481R was purified from 7 M Urea/15% PAGE gels. oligonucleotides were mixed in annealing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl and 5 mM EDTA) to assess the effect of Zn2+, 1 l of a ZnOAc2 stock solution was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. expression and purification of nidovirus RdRps SARS-CoV nsp12 and EAV nsp9 were purified essentially as described elsewhere [27], [28], but with modifications for nsp9. in short, E. coli BL21(DE3) with plasmid pDEST14-nsp9-CH was grown in auto-induction medium ZYM-5052 [47] for 6 hours at 37\u00b0C and plasmid pASK3-Ub-nsp12-CHis6 with oligonucleotides 5\u2032-CCTTATGGGTTGGGCTTATCCAAAATGTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CACATTTTGGATAACCCATAAGGA-3\u2032 were purified parallel to the wt enzymes. 0.5 l of a dilution series of 0\u201380 mM ZnOAc2 was added to the 5 l reaction p12 electrophoretic mobility shift assay SARS-CoV RdRp was incubated with 0.2 nM 5\u2032 32P-labeled SAV557R/SAV481R RNA duplex, for 10 minutes at 30\u00b0C either in presence or absence of 6 mM ZnOAc2. all procedures involving live SARS-CoV were performed in the biosafety level 3 facility at Leiden University Medical Center. cells were exposed to 0\u201332 M PT and 0\u20138 M ZnOAc2 after 18 h incubation. cell viability was determined with the Cell Titer 96 AQ MTS assay (Promega) EC50 and CC50 values were calculated using the nonlinear regression model. magnesium-saturated EDTA (MgEDTA) was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. after RNA isolation, the 32P-labeled reaction products were separated. expression and purification of nidovirus RdRps SARS-CoV nsp12 and EAV nsp9 were purified. RdRps with a D618A (SARS-CoV) or D445A (EAV) mutation were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of the wild-type (wt) plasmid pDEST14-nsp9-CH [28] with oligonucleotides 5\u2032-TACTGCCTTGAAACAGCCCTGGAGAGTTGTGAT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-ATCACAACTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCT -HCl, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MnCl2, 4 mM MgOAc2, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton-X100, 1 mM DTT and 0.5 units RNaseOUT. to chelate Zn2+, MgEDTA was added to a final concentration of 8 mM. purified recombinant EAV nsp9 was incubated with a U18 template in the presence of [-32P]ATP, ATP, 4 mM Mg2+, 1 mM Mn2+, and 1 M ApA. a non-specific band, unrelated to RdRp activity, between A2 and A3 is indicated with an asterisk. the coronavirus RdRp sequences were aligned with Muscle 3.6. the aligned sequences and NCBI accession numbers are: mouse hepatitis virus strain A59. the positions of the conserved cysteine and histidine residues indicated in panel A (C799-H810-C813-H816) close to motif E (depicted in red) and RdRp active-site residues (D618, D760 and D761) are indicated. the spatial arrangement of these residues in this model strikingly resembles the positioning of the metal ion-coordinating residues of Zn-binding pocket Zn2 in the Dengue virus Rd"}
