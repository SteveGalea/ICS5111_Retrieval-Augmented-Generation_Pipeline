{"summary": "inhalation anthrax is the most lethal form of the disease associated with high fatality rate. spores germinate into vegetative bacilli, disrupt phagocytes and penetrate into the circulatory system where high levels of the toxin are secreted. anthrolysin O (ALO), a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) secreted by B. anthracis, is a potent agonist of TLR4. adaptor proteins MyD88 and TRIF are recruited to the receptor, resulting in the activation of transcription factors NF-B and interferon regulatory factor-3. primary AMs infected with Sterne spores exhibit delayed expression of COX2 gene which in turn correlates with a delay in production of PGE2 expression. primary AMs from rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) were harvested by flushing lungs with cold PBS/EDTA/gentamicin solution. ifugation at 240g for 5 min, washed once in PBS/EDTA/gentamicin solution. cells were allowed to adhere for 2 h in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. cells were removed and adherent cells were further incubated overnight. infected macrophages were fixed at indicated times (1 h, 2 h and 6 h), stained with Hoechst 33342 (Life Technology #H3570) and Cell Mask Deep Red (Life Technology #H32721) images were acquired by leica SP5-STED confocal microscope with 63X water objective. adherent AMs or murine J774A.1 macrophages were uninfected or infected with Sterne spores at an MOI of 10. cells were resuspended in cDMEM with 1% penicillin/streptomycin. cell viability measured by adding 50 l of 1500 diluted SYTOX green dye. pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were quantified by using human 25-Plex Panel. gentamicin (50 g/ml) was added 4 h post infection to kill the extracellular bacteria. mRNA was purified and reverse transcribed using high Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits (Life Technology) the quality and concentration of RNA were verified. mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA and hybridized to the NHP genome array. rhesus macaque entrez gene IDs were also mapped to human orthologs via their rhesus macaque gene IDs. the process described above resulted in 913 unique differentially expressed rhesus macaque genes and 528 unique differentially expressed human genes. primary AMs from rhesus macaque were harvested by flushing lungs with cold PBS/EDTA/gentamicin solution. cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 240g for 5 min, washed once in PBS/EDTA/gentamicin solution, and centrifuged again. the anti-MEK1 N-terminus (NT), p44/p42, phospho-p44/p42, and phospho-p38 antibodies were obtained from Millipore. anti-GAPDH antibody was obtained from Life Technology. TEM samples were stained en bloc with 0.5% uranyl acetate in ethanol and dehydrated in graded ethanol and propylene oxide. ultra-thin sections were placed on 200-mesh nickel grids and stained with 5% uranyl acetate and 0.2% lead citrate. Immunoblot Analysis Purified AMs were either left untreated/uninfected or treated with LPS (100 ng/ml), latex beads (LB) or infected with Ames or Sterne spores at an MOI of 10. cells were washed with PBS and transferred into tubes following scraping. mRNA was purified and reverse transcribed using high Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kits (Life Technology) mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA and hybridized to the NHP genome array (Affymetrix, Inc.) probe sets with P-value 0.05 and fold change more than cutoffs were considered as differentially expressed genes and were retained. only probe sets that could be mapped to rhesus macaque Entrez Gene IDs were retained. a housekeeping gene was purchased from SABioscience Corporation. the catalogue numbers for GAPDH and COX-2 are PPQ00249A. GO groups with P-value 0.01 were retained. AMs phagocytose and kill B. anthracis spores. AMs were infected for indicated time points with unlabeled Ames spores. bacterial viability was determined using colony forming assay. the Sterne strain replicated more robustly by 6 h post-infection. the continuous decline in the viability of Ames strains could be due to anti-phagocytic capsule. Sterne B. anthracis mediated MEK1 degradation does not impair AM survival. AMs were left uninfected, incubated with 100 ng/ml of E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Latex beads (LB) or infected with B. anthracis Sterne spores at an MOI of 10. supernatants were collected at indicated time points and cytokine/chemokines levels were quantified. compared to uninfected controls, AM infected with Sterne showed significantly increased levels of TNF- (p0.05) at 4 h and IL-8 (p0.05) at 18 h post-infection. multiple receptors of the innate immune system can detect the presence of a pathogen. both TLRs and NOD like receptors (NLRs) have been reported to detect B. anthracis components. anthrolysin O is a potent agonist of TLR4 [3], [20]. rhesus macaque non-human primate gene chip arrays were used to compare gene expression patterns in AMs infected with either wild type Ames or Sterne spores. a total of 913 unique differentially expressed rhesus macaque genes were identified in the study. gene ontology (GO) analyses revealed enrichment of pathways and cellular processes associated with inflammatory response, regulation of T cell proliferation and TLR signaling pathways. pathways that are not well characterized in response to B. anthracis spore infection were also identified in the study. pathogens # of overlappinggenes Cells used in the study Selected overlapping genes P-value of the overlap P-value of the overlap PMID ID orGEO ID Genes preferentially upregulated in Sterne infected AMs Francisellanovicida 166.

Genes preferentially upregulated in Ames infected AMs EbolaVirus 67 NHP PBMC CACNB4; two well characterized chemokines CCL5 and CCL3 are crucial for immune responses towards infection and inflammation. these two chemokines were differentially expressed after Ames and Sterne infections. a time-dependent expression of certain chemokines may govern the immune response upon B. anthracis infection. our gene expression data showed increased levels of CCL5, CCR7 and COX-2 in Sterne-infected AMs than Ames-infected AMs. the mRNA expression measured by real-time PCR confirmed the microarray analysis data. a statistically significant difference (p0.05) in PGE2 production was observed between Sterne and Ames at 4 h post-infection. the time-dependent kinetics of PGE2 production in Ames infected AMs correlate to that of the COX-2 mRNA expression. p38 dependent transcription factors and NF-B are able to up-regulate the anti-apoptotic genes that are expressed at early and late time points. it is unclear how 13 anti-apoptotic genes are regulated in the absence of p38 activity at later stage of infection. the ability of B. anthracis to activate multiple innate immune receptors may govern the downstream pro-inflammatory cytokine production. differential expression of apoptotic versus anti-apoptotic genes may contribute to the survival of AMs in response to B. anthracis infections. all three strains of B. anthracis were phagocytosed by AMs following infection. engulfment of Sterne spores and subsequent outgrowth into vegetative bacilli was observed as early as 2 h post-infection. AMs have the ability to phagocytose both Ames and Sterne spores. bacterial viability was determined using the colony forming assay. the data represents averages from three independent NHP AMs SEM. the data represents averages from three independent NHP AMs. AMs infected with Sterne spores showed normal MEK1 expression. a greater than 90% cell survival rate was observed in Sterne infected AMs. less than 10% viability was observed in J774A.1 macrophages, an LT-susceptible cell line. AMs or J774A.1 macrophages were either not infected or infected with Sterne spores at an MOI of 10. cell viability of AMs was determined by the uptake of the membrane impermeable SYTOX green dye using flow cytometry analysis. cytokine and chemokine secretion were induced following infection. AMs infected with either Ames or Sterne spores show differential pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine protein expression patterns. the experiment was performed at least three times and data for three rhesus macaque donors were shown. NF-B signaling pathway is activated after infection with both Ames and Sterne spores. IL-1 secretion was up-regulated in AMs infected for 18 h with Ames. this is measured by the production of TNF- and IL-8, which are NF-B dependent genes. microarray analyses identified 528 human orthologs which were differentially expressed between Ames and Sterne infected AMs. AMs obtained from five rhesus macaque donors were infected with Sterne spores at an MOI of 10 for indicated time points. the most significant overlaps were between B. anthracis and other bacterial infections (F. novicida, S. aureus) Interestingly, the most significant overlaps were between B. anthracis and other bacterial infections (F. novicida, S. aureus) humancytomegalovirus 83 human monocyte IL6; IL12B; TNFAIP6; PTGS2; TNF; ITGB8; ADORA2A; TRAF1 8.30E-17 18566437/20173022 SARScoronavirus 156 human Lung Tissue SLAMF7; CCL3; SOCS1; CLEC4E; NCF1; MASTL; IRAK2; SLAMF7;TNFSF15; HIV two well characterized chemokines CCL5 and CCL3 are crucial for immune responses towards infection and inflammation [23]. a time-dependent expression of certain chemokines and cytokines may govern the outcome of the immune response upon B. anthracis infection. homoming of macrophages to draining lymph nodes is mediated by the proinflammatory chemokine receptor, CCR7. activated macrophages also release CCL5 and CCL20 that recruit immature DC and T cells to the inflammatory site [28]\u2013[30]. time-dependent kinetic difference in induction of COX-2 and PGE2 expression (A) AMs were infected with either Ames or Sterne spores for 90 min, 4 h or 18 h. mRNA was purified and quantified by real time PCR. our microarray data identified 24 anti-apoptotic genes that are preferentially up-regulated in Sterne infected AMs. 11 and 13 of these genes were expressed at early (up to 120 mins post-infection) and late (from 120 to 360 mins post-infection) stages. the expression of these anti-apoptotic genes may contribute to the survival of AMs after Sterne infections. the distinct differences in apoptosis regulation further delineate the differences in pathogenicity between Ames and Sterne strains. this study presents evidence that infection of AMs with either Sterne or Ames spores results in time-dependent quantitative differences in gene expression. diagram is based on the observed differences in the cytokine/chemokine and host responses in AMs infected with either Ames or Sterne spores. AMs obtained from five rhesus macaque donors were infected with either Ames or Sterne spores at an MOI of 10 for indicated time points. the GO term belongs to base on Figure 4; GO Term: the description of the biological processes; P-value: the P-value of the overlap; Gene Symbol: the gene symbol of the corresponding gene ID."}
