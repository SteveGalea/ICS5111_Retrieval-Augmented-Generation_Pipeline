{"summary": "men enlisted in basic military training between December 2009 and December 2014 were recruited, with the first FRI as the study entry point. ResPlex II assays and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect viral pathogens. survival analyses were performed to determine whether infection with particular viruses conferred short-lived relative cross-protection against FRI. the study covered recruits undergoing BMT between 15 December 2009 and 31 December 2014. the inactivated influenza vaccine was routinely administered to recruits who did not have contraindications. the study was reviewed and approved by the national university of Singapore. the first FRI episode (FRI-1) for a given participant served as the point of entry into the study (t0) individual participants then accumulated follow-up time, with subsequent FRI episodes being the event of interest. participants with no further episodes accumulated follow-up time until their exit date from BMT. interval B has 3 subintervals (weeks 13\u201314, 15\u201316, and 17\u201318) interval B has 3 subintervals. additional definitions for events of interest were episodes positive for any of the respiratory viruses tested and specific groups of etiological agents. exposure to prior infections was regarded as cumulative. potential confounders included the year of the surveillance program, participant\u2019s age and ethnicity, type of BMT intake, history of smoking and asthma (including childhood asthma), and receipt of influenza vaccine before the FRI episode. Statistical Analysis We present simple tabulations and visualizations of the data at the participant and episode levels. we then investigated how FRI caused by specific virus families affected the subsequent risk of FRI episodes relative to those who were unexposed, through Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank tests. only 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus (A[H1N1]pdm09), for recruits who enlisted between 11 December 2009 and 4 October 2010. the study was reviewed and approved by the national university of Singapore\u2019s joint medical committee for research. participants with 2 episodes contributed additional follow-up intervals after each subsequent episode. in scenario 1, follow-up time accrues between the first (FRI-1) and second (FRI-2) episodes. in scenario 2, follow-up time accrues between the first (FRI-1) and second (FRI-2) episodes. etiological agents included adenoviruses (AdVs)\u2014species B, E, and others for which the type was undetermined; coronaviruses (CoVs); enteroviruses and rhinoviruses (ERVs); human metapneumovirus (hMPV); influenza virus (FluV)\u2014influenza A(H3N2) virus; human parainfluenza virus (hPIV)\u2014types 1 observation time was split into subintervals if the observation period straddled different BMT phases. model 1 omitted the subintervals used to adjust for FRI incidence. model 3 stratified subintervals by whether they ended 4 weeks or 4 weeks after the initial episode. study included 6138 FRI episodes among 5677 participants. median age was 20.1 years (IQR, 19.0\u201320.9 years) and 99.9% were male. 83.6% received influenza vaccine in the past 1 year.

FluV infections were concentrated between June 2011 and February 2013 (Figure 2A), with a sharp decline following routine administration of TIV. however, considerable influenza A(H3N2) virus and influenza B virus activity was observed from April 2013 through October 2014. ERV infections were concentrated in earlier BMT phases, while CoV and AdV infections circulated mostly during weeks 3\u20138 and weeks 5\u201312 after enlistment. all 3 results were statistically significant at P.001. no significant relationships were observed for CoV, ERV, hMPV, hPIV, and RSV. hazard of subsequent FRI episode was significantly lower in subintervals ending 4 weeks after the initial episode.

DISCUSSION Our study provides evidence on how having a FRI episode due to respiratory viruses reduced the risk. observations positive for a specific virus group are essentially being compared against those negative for all viruses we tested for. this analyses does not assess whether, for example, infections by the ERV group confers any protection relative to individuals who did not recently have any viral infection. cross-protection is triggered by interferon-stimulated genes and cytokines. transient cross-protection could result from infection-induced behavioral changes. other proposed mechanisms, such as competition for the same receptor-binding sites, are more applicable to protection against coinfections but not against sequential infection. our study population largely comprises healthy young adults. key circulating viruses in this group differ somewhat from those observed in the general population in Singapore [28] also excluded respiratory illness episodes that did not meet our inclusion criteria of having a temperature 37.5\u00b0C.
