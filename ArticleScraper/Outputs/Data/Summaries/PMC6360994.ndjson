{"summary": "the majority of microorganisms of the human ecosystem act as symbionts that co-evolve and co-adapt with their human host according to their diet, life-style, human genetic characteristics, immune modulation, or environment parameters. the variability in bacterial composition between individuals has been described to be so high that a core microbiome could not be defined at the species level. studying the bacterial community structures in the respiratory tract could be important to understand susceptibility to chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or to pulmonary infections like pneumococcal pneumonia. the degree of stability of the microbiota depends partly on the first colonization by keystone species in the first days of life. the nasopharyngeal microbiota plays a risk or protective factor in the development of invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae. a series of epidemiological, microbiological, and clinical variables related with major risk of developing IPD were considered to compare microbiota profiles in the two groups. the study was performed following the guidelines of the Ethics Committee of Hospital Sant Joan de Deu. all information collected has been treated confidentially and in accordance with applicable laws on personal data. samples collected in sterile plastic tubes were eluted with 0.5 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) they were extracted and stored at 80\u00b0C until further genomic/microbial analysis. all pneumococcal isolates were identified by standard microbiological methods, including the optochin sensitivity test. the measure of human DNA load was then used to normalize by potential differences in sample amount and avoid potential bias between samples. DNA was measured prior to PCR and concentrations adjusted to minimize amplification bias. PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene was performed using high fidelity extensor long range PCR Enzyme. the primers amplified the variable regions 1 to 4 (V1\u2013V4) of 16S rRNA gene. the amplicons were pyrosequenced using a 454 GS FLX Titanium chemistry. negative controls (PBS) were extracted by the same method of the studied samples. 16S rRNA gene and human Rnase P gene were analyzed by PCR. DNA concentrations for negative controls were also below the quality control thresholds required at Macrogen Inc. (Republic of South Korea) rarefaction curves (Mean S.E.) were calculated by including 1,000 random selected reads per sample. beta diversity was also calculated with the rarefied 1,000 reads per sample. analysis was performed by the R software ade4 package (Dray and Dufour, 2007) using the Chi-squared distances-based function CCA. Adonis tests were performed with the R library \u201cvegan\u201d to determine corrected p-values. study was performed following the guidelines of the Ethics Committee of Hospital Sant Joan de Deu which approved the study. all information collected has been treated confidentially and in accordance with applicable laws on personal data. serotypes were classified according to the studies of Brueggemann et al. (2003), Sleeman et al. (2006), and del Amo et al. (2014). serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9A, 9V, 12F, 14, 18C, and 19A were considered high-attack rate or highly-invasive serotypes. all pneumococcal isolates were identified by standard microbiological methods. a duplex real-time PCR also included as target the Rnase P human single-copy gene to detect and measure the number of human cells. -Time PCR assay performs simultaneous amplification, detection and differentiation of DNA/RNA of Adenovirus (AdV), Influenza A virus (FluA), Influenza B virus (FluB), Parainfluenza virus 1 (PIV1), Parainfluenza virus 2 (PIV2), Parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3), Parainfluenza virus 4 (PIV4) Rhinovirus A/B/C (HRV), Respir as target the Rnase P human single-copy gene to detect and measure the number of human cells. Absolute quantification of RNAseP using PCR can be used to estimate the number of human cells present in the clinical samples. DNA was measured prior to PCR and concentrations adjusted to minimize potential bias between samples. microbiota analysis DNA extraction of nasopharyngeal aspirates was performed by Nuclisens\u00ae EasyMag\u00ae according to manufacturer instructions. only samples with a 260/280 absorbance ratio between 1.8 and 2 were processed for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) amplicons were pyrosequenced using a 454 GS FLX Titanium chemistry. negative controls were extracted by the same method of the studied samples. a negative control (water) was included in each sequencing run. only the OTUs representing over 0.1% of total sequences of each sample were considered for further statistical analysis. low-frequency reads, including singletons, are more likely to represent sequencing errors, contaminants, or transient organisms without a biological role. a thousand permutations were performed to obtain a P-value, using Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons. we also performed Constrained Correspondence Analysis (CCA) which emphasizes variation, and tests whether the factor provided can explain part of the total variability. a total of 53 patients were diagnosed of IPD in hospital Sant Joan de Deu (n = 38), Hospital de Nens (n = 6), Hospital de Mataro (n = 5), Hospital de Vic (n = 2) and Hospital de Calella (n = 2). no significant differences of total human DNA load was found between samples of cases and controls. a total of 11 PCV13 serotypes were identified among carriers in the case group, specifically serotype 1 (n = 2), serotype 3 (n = 3), serotype 14 (n = 2), serotype 19A (n = 3), and serotype 19F (n = 1). the differences between groups did not reach statistical significance. there was a significantly higher proportion of PCV13 pneumococcal serotype carriers in cases compared to controls (61.1 vs. 12.5%, p = 0.004) and significantly higher number of high-attack rate serotypes. 0.45 Shared bedroom (cases: 27) 13 (61.9) 12 (44.4) 0.23 Parental smoking (cases: n = 26) 11 (42.3) 13 (46.4) 0.76 Vaccinated against influenza 1 (3.6) 0 (0.0) 1.00 Vaccinated against pneumococcal disease 17 (60.7) 19 (67.9) 0.58 PCV13 vaccinated 14 (82.4) 17 (89.5) 0.42 Respiratory infection in the previous 30 days (Controls: n the bold values means statistically significant associations with p-values 0.05. 201.888 reads >500 bp (500\u2013780 bp) with an average of 2.549 reads of the 16S rRNA gene. the taxonomic assignment of the 16S rRNA reads revealed that the most common phyla in IPD patients were Firmicutes (50.9% of the total number of reads), Proteobacteria (41.4%), Bacteroidetes (5.0%), Actinobacteria (2.2%), and a lower proportion of Fusobacteria. in the control group, the most common phyla were Proteobacteria (66.0% of the the mean proportions were calculated based on 1,000 sequences per sample. those bacteria at a proportion lower than 1% are indicated as \u201cOthers\u201d and were particularly abundant in cases. a linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis shows those bacteria with significantly different levels ( = 0.05) between cases and controls. all Haemophilus species in controls would correspond to H. influenzae. in the cases, 18% of the reads in this genus would correspond to uncultured or unknown species. ella catarrhalis 94.89% 79.71% lincolnii 2.93% 8.30% nonliquefaciens 2.14% 4.46% caprae 0.04% 0.40% lacunata \u2013 7.14% Prevotella uncultured sp 34.54% 60.00% histicola 15.70% \u2013 sp 12.80% 20.00% sp. oral clone 12.32% \u2013 pallens 9.90% microbiota nasopharyngeal-types in health and disease were analyzed by two-dimensional principal coordinates analysis (2D PCoA) samples appeared to cluster in three different groups, corresponding to three different types of respiratory tract microbiota. the microbiota A was mainly composed of reads assigned to the genera Streptococcus (36.9%), Staphylococcus (29.3%), Veillonella (9.8%) p-values for significant hyperbolic regressions were, respectively, 0.029, 0.011, and 0.029 for comparisons between dolosigranulum and Streptococcus. data include IPD patients (red-dots) and healthy controls (blue dots). nasopharyngeal-type A was detected only in 17.9% of children with IPD. nasopharyngeal-type B was only detected in 3 controls (10.7%). nasopharyngeal-type B was only detected in 3 controls (10.7%).
