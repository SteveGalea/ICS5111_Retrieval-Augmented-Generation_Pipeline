{"summary": "the LTs are a group of lipid mediators associated with acute and chronic inflammatory diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, psoriasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and atherosclerosis [2]\u2013[13]. Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) hydrolyzes the ester bond present in sn-2 position of phospholipids and yields lysophospholipids and free fatty acid this enzyme is composed of three domains, a fully beta N-terminal domain, a mixed alpha/beta catalytic domain, and a fully alpha-helical C-terminal domain. this residue belongs to the peptide K21 (L365\u2013K385) segment identified by Lys-specific peptide mapping of suicide inactivated LTA4H. mutagenic experiments have reported the critical role of R563 residue in epoxide hydrolase reaction by positioning the carboxylate tail along the catalytic elements of the active site [28], [34] mutagenic experiments have also reported the critical role of R563 residue in epoxide hydrolase reaction by positioning the carboxylate tail along the catalytic elements of the active site. a binding pocket for a protein receptor to a ligand is usually defined by those residues that have at least one heavy atom. such a criterion was originally used to define the binding pocket of ATP in the Cdk5-Nck5a* complex [48] that has later proved quite useful in identifying functional domains and stimulating the relevant truncation experiments. the results from this study provide valuable information over the way the two functions of the enzyme are exerted over two substrates of diverse nature. the structural information obtained from this study can be used in structure-based hLTA4H inhibitor design as inhibition of the hydrolase and aminopeptidase functions will lead to the development of anticancer and anti-inflammatory drugs. the active site was defined with a 10 radius around the bound inhibitor. the ten top-scoring conformations of every ligand were saved at the end of the calculation. early termination option was used to skip the genetic optimization calculation. the MD simulation is one of the feasible tools. initial coordinates for the protein atoms were taken from the wild type (WT) and mutant forms of both L-LTA4 and L-RAR complexes. a time step of 2 fs at constant pressure (1 atm), temperature (300 K) was used for long-range interactions. a twin range cutoff was used for long-range interactions. the GOLD program from Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, UK uses a genetic algorithm to dock molecules into the protein active site. one of the crystal structures of hLTA4H bound with most active inhibitor (PDB ID: 3FUN) solved at high resolution was used in molecular docking experiments. Arg-Ala-Arg (RAR) in a solved X-ray structure of hLTA4H with a mutation E271Q (PDB ID: 3B7T) was used to copy the 3D coordinates of this tripeptide into the representative structure of LTA4H picked from the 5 ns MD simulation by superimposition. this complex was subjected to energy minimization using Energy Minimization protocol of DS before considered further in this study. a 100 ps position restrained MD simulations were performed for every system followed by 5 ns production MD simulations with a time step of 2 fs at constant pressure (1 atm), temperature (300 K). a twin range cutoff was used for long-range interactions including 0.9 nm for van der Waals and 1.4 nm for electrostatic interactions. the enzyme catalyzes hydrolase and aminopeptidase functions over fatty acid and peptide substrates utilizing the same active site. a set of MD simulations were performed with WT and mutated enzyme-substrate complex structures. the fatty acid substrate LTA4 of arachidonic acid pathway was selected as fatty acid substrate to investigate the hydrolase function of the enzyme. E271 acts as the N-terminal recognition point in stabilizing the peptide substrates in terms of aminopeptidase reaction of the enzyme. all mutations of R563 including R563K, which preserved the positive charge, have resulted in complete loss of catalytic functions. the overall stability analyses are considered important to note that the systems did not undergo unusual changes during the time scale of simulation because of erratic system preparation. root mean square deviation (rmsd), root mean square fluctuation (rmsf) and intra-molecular hydrogen bonds were used in analyzing and comparing the stability of the systems under study. in mutant systems, the average rmsd value of K565A (0.212 nm) was higher than other systems. the other two systems, WT and E272Q, have shown the same average rmsd value (0.168 nm) this distance in E271Q and K565A systems has reduced close to the distance of WT but R563A has maintained higher distance until the end. the distance between the same metal ion and carbonyl oxygen atom of N-terminal peptide bond was measured and compared between the L-RAR WT and mutant systems. the other mutant systems R563A and K565A have shown the average hydrogen bond values of 4.3 and 3.9 respectively. the high number of observed hydrogen bonds in E271Q system does not correlate with the observed loss of catalytic activity due to the mutation of E271. the metal ion has slightly moved towards the carboxylate group of LTA4. this movement of carboxylate group of LTA4 has also mutually moved towards the metal ion. this change in the E271 and distance between Zn2+ and epoxy group (0.69 nm) can be directly correlated with the loss of activity. binding mode of LTA4 in (A) WT (grey), (B) E271Q (wheat) (C) R563A (deep teal) and (D) K565A (pink) systems. the amino acid residues and LTA4 are shown in think stick and ball-stick forms. the strength of the hydrogen bonds with R563 and K565 has become weak in this system because of conformational changes of both carboxylate of substrate and R565 residue. the metal ion located in the active center was thrown away from its initial position because of the absence of negatively charged E271. the observed binding mode of this system is similar to that of E271Q system. the binding mode of RAR at the active site of the enzyme in L-RAR systems. the amino acid residues and RAR are shown in think stick and ball-stick forms. the metal ion present at the active site is shown in sphere form. the K565 residue present in the loop has become a part of the long helix formed by T567-A575 residues during the simulation of E271Q system. this change slightly drew back the K565 residue from the active site. the other positively charged residue did not show any structural changes during the simulation. the short helix of V306-N308 disappeared during the simulation of K565A system. the helix of Y378, one of the oppositely located pair of tyrosine residues, has fluctuated highly in this system. the binding mode of LTA4 was quite similar to that of WT except its carboxylate group, which moved back because of the missing hydrogen bonds. the helix containing Y383 was extended during the simulation. this movement of Y383 has formed -cation and a hydrogen bond interaction with the N-terminal amino group. the other tyrosine residue Y378, which was found to be guiding the substrate along with the carboxylate recognition site residues, has formed hydrogen bond with the carboxylate of RAR. the absence of negatively charged E271 residue also played a major role in observed loss of catalytic activity. the mutation has caused a high fluctuation of E271 that moved far from the N-terminal amino group of RAR and makes it impossible to act as N-terminal recognition site. the carboxylate group of RAR has moved back from its original position and formed -interactions with Y378 and completely lost interactions with R563. this observation completely correlates with the observed activity and the reported statement that K565 assists R563 to act as carboxylate recognition site in aligning the substrate along the catalytic elements. both substrates bind perpendicular to each other occupying majorly the different portion of the active site. the long alkyl part of LTA4 was snuggly bound into the hydrophobic pocket formed by a mixture of aliphatic and aromatic residues. the side chain of C-terminal Arg residue of RAR was fit into the small cavity formed by F356, Y378, S379, M564, K565, and R568 residues. complexes including two WT, enzyme-LTA4 and enzyme-RAR complexes were simulated in this study. the observed hydrogen bond interaction network and distance between the catalytically important atoms have correlated well with the experimental results. both the E271Q and K565A systems have lost the expected binding mode of the substrates for the successful catalysis. binding mode has lost both the N-terminal and C-terminal recognitions leading to the loss of activity. results obtained from this study can be effectively used in designing future hLTA4H inhibitors as anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer therapeutics. metal (Zn2+) ion present close to the epoxide moiety of LTA4 acts as a weak Lewis acid to activate and open the epoxide ring of LTA4. the positively charged residues R563 and K565 were predicted as the carboxylate recognition sites for both the substrates of the enzyme. the results of MD simulations of mutant enzyme-substrate complexes discussed in this study will provide a deeper insight from the structural perspective. root mean square deviation (rmsd) and root mean square fluctuation (rmsf) were used in analyzing and comparing the stability of the systems under study. the average number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds were calculated for all the systems and plotted. the average number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds were calculated for all the systems. this result has confirmed the stability of the systems despite small differences between systems. the average distance value observed in WT system (0.56 nm) was lower compared to the mutant systems. E271Q and K565A systems have shown similar average distance value of 0.69 nm and 0.63 nm. a system has shown an average number of hydrogen bonds of 5.0. E271Q and R563A systems have formed only 1.7 and 1.8 average number of hydrogen bonds with the bound ligand. this reduced number of hydrogen bonds correlate well with previously reported loss of hydrolase activity of the enzyme. the distance between the carboxylate of E271 and metal (Zn2+) ion was maintained in close vicinity for the reported acid-induced catalytic reaction. the other residue Y378 has also formed a hydrogen bond interaction with the carboxylate group of LTA4. in E271Q system, the binding mode of LTA4 is so different from that of WT system. the distance between Zn2+ and epoxy ring of LTA4 was higher (0.68 nm) in this mutant system. the hydrogen bond between LTA4 and Y378 was also maintained. a -cation interaction was formed between the side chain of Arg residue and Y378, which was found highly fluctuating in rmsf analysis. the binding mode of the substrate in E271Q system was different to that of WT system. the strength of the hydrogen bonds with R563 and K565 has become weak in this system because of the conformational changes of both carboxylate of substrate and R565 residue. no hydrogen bonds were formed with R563 residue, which is one of the positively charged carboxylate recognition site residues. residues are important for recognizing the carboxylate group and aligning the peptide substrate along the catalytic elements as reported. this movement of carboxylate group of LTA4 has moved the central epoxy group of LTA4 further down and made it inaccessible by the catalytic metal ion. this change in the E271 and distance between Zn2+ and epoxy group (0.69 nm) can be directly correlated with the loss of activity. binding mode of LTA4 in (A) WT (grey), (B) E271Q (wheat) (C) R563A (deep teal) and (D) K565A (pink) systems. metal ion (zinc) present at the active site is shown in sphere form. the strength of the hydrogen bonds with R563 and K565 has become weak in this system because of the conformational changes of both carboxylate of substrate and R565 residue. the metal ion located in the active center was thrown away from its initial position because of the absence of negatively charged E271. the observed binding mode of this system is similar to that of E271Q system. binding mode of RAR in (A) WT (cyan), (B) E271Q (light orange) (C) R563A (sand) and (D) K565A (blue white) systems. amino acid residues and RAR are shown in think stick and ball-stick forms. the loop containing G269 has shown slight fluctuation only at the location of G269 because of the hydrogen bonds formed between the carboxylate of LTA4 and G269. the lower part of the loop was stable unlike E271Q system. the helix of F314 was extended as seen in R563A system. the helix of Y378, one of the oppositely located pair of tyrosine residues, has fluctuated highly in this system. the binding mode of LTA4 was quite similar to that of WT except its carboxylate group, which moved back because of the missing hydrogen bonds from K565 residue. the uncharged nature of the mutant residue Q271 the metal ion has lost the important interaction and moved far away from its original location. the distance between the Zn2+ ion and the oxygen atom of the N-terminal peptide bond was so high compared to the WT system. the catalytic aminopeptidase reaction becomes impossible in E271Q system. the mutation has caused a high fluctuation of E271 that moved far from the N-terminal amino group of RAR. the interacting distance between Zn2+ and E271 was maintained in this mutant system. the other tyrosine residue Y378 was highly fluctuating in this mutant system compared to any other systems. K565 assists R563 to act as carboxylate recognition site in aligning the substrate along the catalytic elements of the enzyme. the overlay of all L-RAR systems revealed that along with E271, R563, K565 residues, Y378 and Y383 were also important in keeping the substrate aligned within the active site. the carboxylate group of LTA4 and terminal NH2 of R563 moved away from each other. a short beta sheet formed by the residues V306-N308 of HEXXH-(X)18-E motif disappeared in E271Q system. another helix followed by this short beta sheet was extended by four amino acids W311-F314 making the important F314 slightly backward from the active center. a mixture of aliphatic and aromatic hydrophobic residues (W311, F362, K364, L365, V366, V367, and V381) was observed because of the missing interactions with R563 residue. the missing R563 led to the loss of correct alignment of LTA4 along the catalytic elements and severe instability of the binding mode of LTA4. WT, E21Q, R563A, and K565A systems are shown in grey, wheat, deep teal, and pink colors. the metal ion (zinc) present at the active site is shown in sphere form. the other tyrosine residue Y378, which was found to be guiding the substrate along with the carboxylate recognition site residues, formed hydrogen bond with the carboxylate of RAR. the binding mode of RAR observed in E271Q system has shown only weak hydrogen bonding interactions with R563 as it was moving away from it. but this residue has maintained hydrogen bond interactions with the peptide substrate through its carboxylate group. the short helix (V306-N308) that has shown structural changes in L-LTA4 system disappeared in K565A system. the extension of helix has drawn F314 residue back from the active site center. a folded binding mode of RAR was observed in K565 system much different from that of WT and other mutant L-RAR systems. the amino acid residues and RAR are shown in grey, wheat, deep teal, and pink colors. the metal ion (zinc) present at the active site is shown in sphere form. this part of the study has documented various structural changes. this adds explanation to the importance of K565 residue in assisting R563 residue in aligning the peptide substrate. this residue is not required in aligning fatty acid substrate. this residue is not required in aligning fatty acid substrate. this difference in binding mode of LTA4 was completely because of the loss of hydrogen bond interaction with R563 residue. the same mutation has affected the binding mode of RAR and N-terminal recognition through E271 residue in peptide binding."}
