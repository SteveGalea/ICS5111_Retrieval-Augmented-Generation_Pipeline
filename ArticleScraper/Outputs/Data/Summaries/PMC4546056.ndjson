{"summary": "objective of this study was to estimate the disease burden associated with influenza-like illness (ILI) in the united kingdom stratified by age, risk and influenza vaccination status. results Data were included from 156,193 patients with 1 general practitioner visit with ILI. influenza is an acute self-limiting viral disease which, in the majority of cases, is inconvenient but generally not serious. seasonal influenza can cause severe illness, hospitalisations and deaths, especially in those who are at \u2018high risk\u2019 due to age or underlying chronic health problems. influenza is responsible for seasonal epidemic and occasional pandemic activity. this is the first study to use linked hospital and general practice databases to assess the burden of illness in both primary and secondary care in the UK. to our knowledge, this is the first study to use linked hospital and general practice databases to quantify primary and secondary resource use and costs. the proportion of patients in the GPRD with linked data in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) dataset is 58.8%, and the linked patients are representative of the whole GPRD population [13] since this study was initiated, the GPRD has changed its name and is now known as The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). data on patients who had at least one GP consultation with a READ code describing influenza, acute upper or lower respiratory tract infection, or ILI were extracted from the linked GPRD data on GP consultations and hospital admissions were extracted from the linked GPRD and HES dataset (S1 File) only the first episode of each hospitalisation was retained in the dataset. mortality was recorded by the GP or at hospital discharge. all costs were expressed in \u00a3 (pounds sterling) using 2011 costs. data analysis was used to estimate proportion of GP consultations, hospitalisations and deaths potentially attributable to each pathogen. multivariate analysis was used to assess the relationship between burden and the degree of mismatch between the influenza vaccine and the circulating influenza virus strains in each year. a similar analysis was undertaken in patients categorised as not high-risk, using age as the test variable. the proportion of patients in the GPRD with linked data in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) dataset is 58.8%, and the linked patients are representative of the whole GPRD population [13] since this study was initiated, the GPRD has changed its name and is now known as The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). data on patients who had at least one GP consultation with a READ code describing influenza, acute upper or lower respiratory tract infection, or ILI were extracted from the linked GPRD if there were two GP consultations recorded for a patient on the same day, only one was counted. only the first episode of each hospitalisation was retained in the dataset. mortality was recorded by the GP or at hospital discharge. all costs were expressed in \u00a3 (pounds sterling) using 2011 costs. data analysis Regression analysis was used to estimate proportion of GP consultations, hospitalisations and deaths potentially attributable to each pathogen. a multivariate analysis was used to assess the relationship between burden and the degree of mismatch between the influenza vaccine and the circulating influenza virus strains in each year. a similar analysis was undertaken in patients categorised as not high-risk, using age as the test variable.
