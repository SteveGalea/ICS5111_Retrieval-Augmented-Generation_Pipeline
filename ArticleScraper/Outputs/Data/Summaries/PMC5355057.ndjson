{"summary": "TMPRSS11D belongs to the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) family. it is the largest group of pericellular serine proteases. the TTSP family is the largest group of pericellular serine proteases. TMPRSS11D was originally purified and cloned from the sputum of patients with chronic airway disease [13, 14] it is highly expressed in respiratory epithelium, and its expression has also been detected in cervix, esophagus, prostate, trachea, and lung tissues [15]. potential substrates of TMPRSS11D include fibrinogen [16], protease activated receptor (PAR)-2 [17], uro TMPRSS11D mRNA expression level was normalized to the expression of housekeeping gene GAPDH. TMPRSS11D protein level was significantly higher in NSCLC tumorous tissues than adjacent normal tissues. high TMPRSS11D expression was detected in 48.50% of tumorous tissues. TMPRSS11D staining Association of TMPRSS11D expression with NSCLC clinical characteristics. high TMPRSS11D protein expression was significantly associated with TNM staging (Pearson 2 = 10.913, P = 0.004). present in 60.00% of stage III and IV patients, 57.14% of stage II patients, and 40.23% of stage 0 and I patients. unknown 4 3 1 T 1.400 0.497 Tis + T1 140 77 (55.00) 71 (45.00) T2 167 81 (48.50) 86 (51.50) T3,4 23 11 (47.83) 12 (52.17) Unknown 4 3 1 N 7.428 0.024* N0 203 116 (57.14) 87 (42.86) N1 74 31 (41.89) 950.00) 43 (58.11) N2 53 22 (41.51) 31 (58.49 1.617, 95% CI: 1.356\u20131.929; P 0.001) remained significantly associated with poor overall survival. similar results were shown by the Kaplan-Meier survival curve. LC patients with high TMPRSS11D expression (green line, 1) had significantly worse overall survival than male NSCLC patients with low or no TMPRSS11D expression (blue line, 0); stage III-IV NSCLC patients had worst overall survival (grey line, 3), than stage II NSCLC patients (green line, 2) and stage 0-I NSCLC patients (blue line, 1) TMPRSS11D mRNA level was significantly higher in NSCLC tumorous tissues adenocarcinoma tissue strong positive for TMPRSS11D staining. squamous cell carcinoma tissue strong positive for TMPRSS11D staining. adjacent normal alveolar epithelium tissue negative for TMPRSS11D staining. 147 73 (49.66) 74 (50.34) Histological type 0.357 0.550 Adenocarcinoma 173 92 (53.18) 81 (46.82) SCC 111 55 (49.55) 56 (50.45) Others 50 25 25 Differentiation 0.146 0.702 Low grade 90 49 (54.44) 41 (45.56) Middle and High grade 219 114 (52.05) 105 (47.95) Others 25 9 16 TNM stage 10.913 0.004* 0 high TMPRSS11D expression (HR, 2.246, 95% CI: 1.646\u20133.065; P 0.001), sex (being male) and TNM staging (HR, 1.617, 95% CI: 1.356\u20131.929; P 0.001) remained significantly associated with poor overall survival. similar results were shown by the Kaplan-Meier survival curve. 0.001* 1.428\u20132.018 N0 vs. N1 vs. N2 TNM stage 1.755 0.001* 1.477\u20132.085 1.617 0.001* 1.356\u20131.929 0\u2013I vs. III\u2013IV * p 0.05. TMPRSS11D is highly expressed in respiratory epithelium, localized in the suprabasal layer of bronchial epithelium. TMPRSS11D protein is localized on the surface of differentiated epithelial cells in cervix and esophagus. TMPRSS4 is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer when compared to healthy tissue. TMPRSS11D can promote tumorigenesis through cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis, and inflammation. through PAR-2, TMPRSS11D can activate the MSP-RON signaling pathway in the respiratory tract [19] through amphiregulin (AR), TMPRSS11D can activate regulatory T lymphocytes and suppresses CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor response. study demonstrates that TMPRSS11D could play an important role in the development of NSCLC. TMPRSS11D overexpression is an independent prognostic marker for NSCLC. future clinical studies should investigate the role of other HAT/DESC subfamily members in NSCLC. TMPRSS11D protein expression in tissue blocks was determined using tissue microarray immunohistochemistry (TMA IHC) the continuous TMPRSS11D protein expression data were converted into dichotic data (low vs high) using specific cutoff values, which were selected to be significant in terms of overall survival (OS) data were analyzed using SPSS 20.0 statistics software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and STATA 12.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA) 20 patients were consented and enrolled before surgery. 24 pairs matched tumorous and normal fresh tissue samples were collected and frozen at the time of surgery. the TMPRSS11D IHC data were scored using the semi-quantitative H-score method. the continuous TMPRSS11D protein expression data were converted into dichotic data (low vs high) using specific cutoff values."}
