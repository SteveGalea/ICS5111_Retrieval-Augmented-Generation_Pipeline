{"summary": "emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are defined as newly appearing infections in a population or diseases that have previously existed, but are rapidly emerging in incidence or geographic range. new human pathogens are especially likely to continue emerging, mainly from mammals and birds, for the foreseeable future. an effective global surveillance system for novel pathogens is needed. systemic approaches are required to predict protective immune responses from high throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. new advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) and high-throughput technologies have enabled researchers to comprehensively assess whole genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes of cells and tissues. major pathogens include highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus (SFTSV), ZIKV, dengue virus (DENV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). such diseases pose a major threat to public health and have the potential to cause a high incidence of fatality among the global community. microbial adaptation is driven by the evolution of microbes to survive in diverse environments. RNA viruses carry RNA as their genetic material and can quickly adapt to and exploit different hosts because of the high error rates of the viral enzymes. 186 cases were reportedly infected with MERS-CoV during the 2015 outbreak. this number was the highest among MERS non-endemic areas. climate change can contribute to ecological changes and contribute to the emergence of EIDs. the HPAI virus can undergo rapid evolution by gene mutation, reassortment, and homologous recombination in avian species and vertebrate reservoir hosts. concerns remain due to the potential for avian influenza viruses circulating in poultry to become transmissible between species and directly infect humans. human-to-human transmission is considered very rare. it is urgently necessary to develop effective diagnostic and preventative tools to protect against SFTSV. the virus is thought to spread via blood or mucosal secretions. dengue fever is a major public health concern in many parts of the tropics and subtropics. four different serotypes are currently co-circulating in most dengue-endemic areas. pathogenesis of dengue fever is very unique in regards to antibody-dependent immune enhancement associated with DENV. pti-transmitted diseases, the first patient infected with ZIKV, was reported in south Korea in 2016. the patient had stayed in Brazil for 3 weeks, and upon arrival in south Korea complained of various symptoms, including fever, eyeball pain, and maculopapular rash. the world is unprepared to detect local outbreaks and respond quickly enough to prevent them from becoming global pandemics. in february 2013, cases of human infection with a novel, lowly pathogenic H7N9 virus were reported in the Anhui and Shanghai regions of eastern China. as of April 2017, the total number of H7N9 cases has exceeded 1344. SFTS infection is an emerging tick-borne hemorrhagic fever that was first described in rural areas of China. dromedary camels were found to carry MERS-CoV without any respiratory symptoms. the fatality rate of MERS-CoV infection in humans is approximately 20\u201350%, and its symptoms include fever, cough, and breathing difficulties. the unique complexity of DENV pathogenesis and its effect on immune enhancement pose a great challenge to the development of a safe and effective DENV vaccine. however, there have been many imported DENV infection cases in South Korea, and their number is increasing due to increased traveling to Southeast Asia. the world is unprepared to detect local outbreaks and respond quickly enough to prevent them from becoming global pandemics. the ability to rapidly develop and deliver vaccines when new \u2018unknown\u2019 diseases emerge offers our best hope to outpace outbreaks, save lives, and avert disastrous economic consequences. RNA-seq technology has the potential to reveal the dynamics of pathogen genome alteration and systemic changes in host and pathogen gene expression during the process of infection. if applied to EID research, information can help to accelerate uncovering the pathogenesis of novel infections and the interaction mechanism of emerging pathogens. the eradication of smallpox is one of the many successes of global immunization programs. many vaccine challenges remain, especially for the design of effective vaccines for major killers, such as AIDS, dengue fever, and malaria. et al.71 compared transcriptomic data for those given either the trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) or the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) both vaccines induced the expression of genes involved in innate immune pathways, although LAIV induced higher expression of several interferon-related genes. older adults and children are most vulnerable to severe and often lethal influenza virus infection. the latest research by Dr. Pulendran's group analyzed vaccine-induced immunity in multi-scale ways in different age groups of healthy adults immunized with shingles vaccine, Zostavax. the authors presented an integration data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) transcriptomics, flow cytometry of blood cells, plasma cytokine analysis, and metabolomics. high-throughput data thus generated can be integrated using bioinformatics tools. such hypotheses can then be tested with animal models or in vitro human systems. insights gained from experimentation can then guide identification of biomarker and the design and development of new vaccines. systems vaccinology approaches can provide translational solutions for novel and enhanced vaccine development. single-cell sequencing allows researchers to examine the genomes or transcriptomes of individual cells. this technique can be used to assess the individual contribution of single cells in complex tissues by profiling the transcriptome in an unbiased manner. a reverse vaccinology process was recently applied, based on the notion that protective antigens could be identified by determining the antibody repertoire from infected or vaccinated individuals. reverse vaccinology tools are a rational approach to design vaccines and will ultimately lead to more effective vaccines for EIDs. the protective epitope can be structurally characterized and used to predict the protective epitope using crystallography. the protective epitope can then be engineered to produce an optimized immunogen with enhanced delivery format. this new reverse vaccinology-based antigen can be tested in humans."}
