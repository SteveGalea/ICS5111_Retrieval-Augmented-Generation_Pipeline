{"summary": "the current regimen is restricted to extracellular targets due to the inability of proteins to enter cells. the concept of using exosomes for protein delivery has been attempted, but remains to be fully exploited. exosomes are lipid bilayer-enclosed extracellular vesicles that transport proteins, nucleic acids and lipids between cells. this method allows one to select viral envelope proteins to alter host tropism. most retroviruses approved for clinical trials are pseudotyped with VSVG. VSVG is incorporated into the viral envelope during the budding of microdomains at the plasma membrane. human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were purchased from Alstem (Richmond, CA, USA) all cells were maintained in high-glucose Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM GlutaMax. fusion constructs were configured 5\u20323\u2032 as per the following. a constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter, the signal peptide (SP), an in-frame insertion of red fluorescent protein (RFP) or Gaussia luciferase (Gluc), the stem sequence, transmembrane helix, the cytosolic tail, and a stop codon. the matured fVSVG is a single transmembrane protein without the SP. the large N-terminal ectodomain (black line) with a short stem region (green line) is situated at the outer surface of the plasma membrane or the luminal side of the endosome. membrane topology of VSVG (black), loaded protein cargo GFP (green) or RFP (red) and exosome markers (CD63/CD81, blue) are indicated. fVSVG, full-length VSVG, mVSVG, minimal VSVG, multiple-vesicle body; SP, signal peptide. exosome pull-down assay was conducted using an Exo-Flow kit (System Biosciences) 20 L of streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads was mixed with 15 L of biotin-labeled CD81 antibody for 2 hours at 4\u00b0C. the beads were then washed and 50 g of pseudotyped exo-somes was incubated overnight with the antibody-captured beads. loaded iPS cells were imaged at 10 magnification using an Evos FL autofluorescence microscope. hek293 or U87A cells were sorted and quantified using flow cytometry. events (10,000\u201330,000) were recorded for each sample using an FL3A channel. human iPS cells (iPS11 and iPS15) were purchased from Alstem. they were preadapted to feeder-free conditions and maintained in serum-free mTeSR1 medium. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. to display an RFP, GFP, or Gluc inside exosomes, these sequences were inserted at the end of the cytoplasm tail of VSVG. a positive exosome tracer, XPack-GFP, was purchased from System Biosciences. all final constructs were confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing. a proposed model illustrating how VSVG participates in exosomes in a mammalian cell. the first inward budding begins to form endosomes. the second inward budding from the endosome forms exosomes stored in a MVB. the enriched exosome pellet was resuspended in a phosphate buffer. the protein concentration of prepared exosomes was measured by NanoDrop Lite. iPS cell lines were cultured on a Matrigel-coated plate and loaded with exosomes in serum-free mTeRS1 medium. cells were then imaged at 10 magnification using an Evos FL autofluorescence microscope. events were recorded for each sample using an FL3A channel. hypothesized that the preferred topology of VSVG on the exosome would be one where the VSVG protein is retained in the membrane by the interaction of its hydrophobic tail with the bilayer membrane. this anchoring strategy would position the ectodomain of fVSVG to the outer surface of the exosome for pseudotyping. exosomes are believed to form these domains in two sequential inward-budding processes. the first generates an endosome, while the second leads to the formation of multiple-vesicle bodies that eventually release individual exosomes into the extracellular space. the expression and subcellular localization of fVSVG-GFP are shown in red (E\u2013H) fVSVG-RFP and Rab5A-GFP (an endosome marker) for 3 days, images show the expression and cellular distribution of fVSVG (I, red), Rab5A (J, green), or colocalization of both (K, yellow). fVSVG-RFP and CD63-GFP (an exosome marker) resulted in similar patterns of fluorescent endosomal vesicles were components of the exosome biogenesis pathway. we cotransfected HEK293 cells with fVSVG-RFP (red) and CD63-GFP (green), a validated marker of exosomes. results confirm the expectation that fVSVG participates in the biogenesis of the endocytic compartment as presecreted exosomes. the red fluorescence localized to the same type of puncta we found for mVSVG fusion proteins that were identified as potentially endocytic compartments. we found extensive overlap of the red and green fluorescence signals in cells cotransfected with RFP-mVSVG and each of the fluorescent fusion proteins fVSVG-GFP. fVSVG and XPack-GFP were transfected with fVSVG-RFP or XPack-GFP. fluorescence of fVSVG and XPack-GFP was recorded as a function of time in live cells. the incorporation of fVSVG into exosomes was monitored and compared with that of XPack. cells were cotransfected with fVSVG-RFP and XPack-GFP for 3 days. fVSVG localizes to punctate structures in all three cell types. mVSVG and fVSVG fusions of the highly luminescent luciferase from Gaussia princeps. if the pseudotyped exosomes are released from transfected cells, high levels of luciferase activity could be expected from the conditioned medium. fVSVG-RFP/RFP-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG-mVSVG. a key question is whether the ectodomain of VSVG may modulate the binding and uptake of exosomes. a key question is whether the ectodomain of VSVG may modulate the binding and uptake of exosomes. cultured cells were treated with either fVSVG-RFP or RFP-mVSVG in a 96-well plate. Enhanced uptake of fVSVG was evident (A\u2013C and G\u2013K) compared to mVSVG (D\u2013F and H\u2013L) images were taken after exosome incubation for 48 hours at 10 magnification (scale bar 10 m) iPS cells were loaded with either fVSVG-RFP or RFP-mVSVG pseudotyped exosomes for 48 hours, then washed and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis. the plots in Figure 7A and B show the population of cells emitting RFP fluorescence shifted slightly to higher numbers for exosome types A and B compared to the control group. fVSVG, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein; fVSVG, full-length VSVG; mVSVG, minimal VSVG. experimental design and pseudotyping strategy First, we developed a strategy to repurpose exosomes as vehicles for in vivo targeted delivery and imaging. fVSVG fusion proteins were left intact in all fusion proteins. this strategy would limit the synthesis of VSVG to the surface of the rough ER. the SP sequence is removed and the remaining VSVG molecules concentrate in tetraspanin-enriched microdomains of the plasma membrane. escence was consistent with that expected for endocytic structures. the intracellular puncta represent endosomes and are formed by the inward budding of the plasma membrane. fusion expressed in HEK293 cells colocalized to endocytic compartments by comparing distributions of VSVG fluorescence with validated fluorescent markers of the endosome. the results confirm the expectation that fVSVG participates in the biogenesis of the endocytic compartment as presecreted exosomes. the ectodomain of fVSVG recognizes specific proteins on the surface of recipient cells. the fusion protein contained the N-terminal SP (54aa) and the C-terminal domain (70aa) we recorded images of the red fluorescence of RFP-mVSVG. expression and subcellular distribution were shown for mVSVG (D, G; red), Rab5A (E, green) and colocalization of both in overlay (F, yellow) similar results were obtained to show expression and subcellular distribution of exosome marker CD63 (H) and its colocalization with mVSVG (I, yellow) hek293 cells were transfected with fVSVG-RFP or XPack-GFP alone (an exosome tracer) for indicated periods of time. the incorporation of fVSVG into exosomes was monitored and compared with that of XPack. fusion protein localizes to punctate structures in all three cell types. fVSVG and mVSVG are capable of targeting and introducing functional fusion proteins into exosomal membranes. if the pseudotyped exosomes are released from transfected cells, high levels of luciferase activities could be expected from the conditioned medium. gaussia luciferase activity was assayed using conditioned media from HEK293 cell culture on day 2 posttransfection. conditioned media from HEK293 cell culture assayed activity. fVSVG-GFP and CD81 confirmed exosomes were fVSVG-GFP. the presence of CD81 confirmed they were exosomes. a key question is whether the ectodomain of VSVG may modulate binding and uptake of exosomes. exosome delivery to recipient cells is enhanced by fVSVG pseudotyping. second the ectodomain of fVSVG plays an important role in binding and subsequent uptake of exosomes by recipient cells. d exosomes for 24 hours showed strong intracellular fluorescence in 50%\u201360% of iPSC11 and 40%\u201350% of iPSC15 cells. highest levels of exosome uptake were found in cells at the periphery of stem cell colonies. mVSVG-loaded exosomes were found to be taken up at low levels in iPS cells. fVSVG-RFP or RFP-mVSVG pseudotyped exosomes were loaded for 48 hours. fVSVG-RFP and mVSVG (B) exosomes were then washed and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis. fVSVG-RFP and mVSVG (B) exosomes are shown in comparison to negative control (A) in panel (D) VSVG-modified exosomes were shown to form efficiently in host cells. they were secreted to the extracellular space with the same physical properties as natural exosomes. in both cases, both VSVG and a viral protein were included as components of the exosome-based vaccination material. exosomes are cell-derived nanoparticles with a diameter of 30\u2013200 nm. they are recognized as \u201cself\u201d by the host and present a repertoire of intrinsic surface proteins that allow them to gain access to tissues and tumor microenvironments. exosomes are capable of transporting specific proteins on their surfaces or within their internal cavity. studies demonstrate the feasibility of using VSVG pseudotyping to engineer targeted exosomes for delivery. fVSVG coding sequences and protein sequences follow wild-type vesicular stomatitis virus. gtgatttcgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctg cctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctc cultured cells were cotransfected with either fVSVG-RFP or RFP-mVSVG for 3 days in U87, HEPG2, and L292 lines. images of fluorescence signal and phase contract of the same field were taken to show the expression and subcellular localization of fVSVG (A) or mVSVG (B). cells at 30% confluence were loaded with pseudotyped exosomes in a six-well plate. after 48 hours of incubation, cells were washed and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis. attg caagttcaccatagttttttttccacacaaccaaaaaaaaaggaaaaaaattggcataatgacttaatag gcacacagcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc aggcaaggctgcaaat gcaatactgcaaat gcaatactgcaaat gcaatactgcaaat gcaatactgcaaat gcaatactgcaaat gcaatactgcaaat gctgctctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgctgc cultured cells were cotransfected with fVSVG and exosome marker CD81-GFP for 3 days. cell images of the same field were taken to show expression and subcellular localization of mVSVG (A, red), CD81 (B, green), and colocalization of both. images of fluorescence signal and phase contract of the same field were taken to show expression and subcellular localization of fVSVG (A) or mVSVG (B) Arrows and overlay indicate endosome/exosome/MVB structures inside cells. caagtttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt aaggtcaaagggctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctctc cultured cells were cotransfected with fVSVG and exosome marker CD81-GFP for 3 days. cell images of same field were taken to show expression and subcellular localization of mVSVG. cultured cells were transfected with either fVSVG-RFP or RFP-mVSVG for 3 days in U87, HEPG2 and L292 lines. images of fluorescence signal and phase contract of the same field were taken to show the expression and subcellular localization of fVSVG (A) or mVSVG (B) full-length VSVG;
