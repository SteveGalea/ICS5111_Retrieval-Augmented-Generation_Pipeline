{"summary": "search question Do children with croup (patient group) develop re-emergence of stridor, worse than the initial baseline presentation (comparison) medLINE was searched via PubMed using following terms Croup and Adrenaline OR Epinephrine. 15 children randomised to nebulised racemic adrenaline 0.5 mL in 2.5 mL of normal saline for 3 h. 14 children randomised to 3 h of Heliox (blend of 70% helium and 30% oxygen) gas therapy for 3 h. nebulised saline as placebo. no statistically significant improvement in the group treated with dexamethasone. 16 children randomlyised to receive racemic nebulised adrenaline and 15 nebulised l-adrenaline. randomised double blind clinical trial Highly significant reduction in croup score (p0.001) in both groups at 30 and 60 min, but no significant difference at 90 and 120 min. no deterioration of croup score to above the score at presentation. nebulised adrenaline was advocated only in children with impending airway obstruction. the benefit of steroids in the management was not clearly established. most early studies compared treatments of nebulised adrenaline with placebo. three small studies involving 48 children showed significant initial improvement using nebulised adrenaline compared to placebo with some return of symptoms but no rebound reported. nebulised adrenaline is effective for the treatment of acute mild to moderately severe croup and in 25% of children receiving placebo. re-emergence of symptoms is less marked in studies when children received concurrent steroids. key points Children with croup who are treated with nebulised adrenaline may develop re-emergence of symptoms, but they are not worse than baseline."}
