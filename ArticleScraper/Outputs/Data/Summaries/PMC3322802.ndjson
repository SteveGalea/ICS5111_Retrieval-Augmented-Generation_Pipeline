{"summary": "new information arising during the outbreak may undermine the study hypothesis. a trial of corticosteroids appears to be a rational direction for future treatment trials, given their widespread use in the treatment of SARS. however, a trial of ribavirin appears to be a rational direction for future treatment trials. a trial of ribavirin therapy should be deferred and its resources allocated to trials testing agents that cannot be evaluated by other means. the hypothesis that steroids can improve outcome in SARS by preventing or abrogating immune-mediated lung injury will be difficult to disprove by any means short of a trial. a trial without a specific diagnostic test may result in the inclusion of patients without the condition of interest. inclusion of patients without the disease of interest will bias the study towards the null hypothesis. clinical trials require that the intervention used be defined explicitly. dose, frequency, duration, and route of administration must be predetermined. in an outbreak involving an unknown or novel pathogen, these data will be unavailable. the initial dose of ribavirin was based on limited clinical experience. trials require ongoing communication with trial participants and timely disclosure of emerging information about efficacy and safety. the ultimate size of the outbreak will dictate enrollment. concerns that the trial will be underpowered are likely to arise. in the first Toronto outbreak, SARS developed in 249 patients between the time the outbreak was recognized on March 13, 2003, and the end of the outbreak on April 25. the decision to conduct a trial was made on March 23, 10 days after the recognition of the first cases of SARS. the decision to conduct a trial was made on March 23, 10 days after the recognition of the first cases of SARS. network would facilitate rapid initiation of trials during an outbreak through advanced preparation of study protocols and by providing urgent assistance in the design and implementation of trials after recognition of an outbreak. a major role of the network would be to establish a communication system to connect front-line clinicians and network collaborators at multiple sites to facilitate an exchange of clinical information. a contingency fund for urgent clinical trials should be established nationally or internationally. trial of ribavirin in SARS treatment was approved at several university-affiliated teaching hospitals involved in caring for patients during the first SARS outbreak in Toronto. when a second outbreak occurred, it was centered at a hospital where ethics approval had not been obtained. a national or regional emergency ethics review board could be created with the authority to override the need for local institutional approval. researchers may become vectors of disease, placing patients, colleagues, family members, and institutions at risk. investigators and ethics boards will need to expand their horizons to consider the risks and benefits of trials as they apply to participating clinicians, researchers, and the public. this would reduce transmission risk and also allow the participation of multiple international sites in a single trial. the unpredictable nature of outbreaks poses many challenges to the successful design and implementation of such trials."}
