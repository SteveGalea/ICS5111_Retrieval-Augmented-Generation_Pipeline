{"summary": "GpSGHV is a dsDNA virus whose 190 kb genome encodes more than 60 confirmed proteins. the family consists of only one other member, the housefly Musca domestica (Diptera; Muscidae) hytrosavirus (MdSGHV; Coler et al., 1993) the only available method to multiply GpSGHV is via intra-hemocoelic injections of virus suspension in G. pallidipes. a mature GpSGHV virion contains 61 virally-encoded proteins. asymptomatic infection state can convert to a symptomatic state. the pathobiology of GpSGHV in species other than G. pallidipes has not been investigated. males are more susceptible to infections compared to females. the pathological, morphological and ultrastructural effects of GpSGHV infection in G. pallidipes SGs have been studied to considerable length. however, no such studies have been performed in other Glossina species. experimental flies were reared at 23 1\u00b0C, 75\u201380% relative humidity, 12 h scotophase and fed on defibrinated bovine blood meals. males were used because they are significantly more susceptible to expression of SGH symptoms than the females. all the treatments described here were replicated at least three times. s displaying overt SGH symptoms were dissected from an adult (10-day old) male G. pallidipes fly and stored in 1 ml of sterile saline (pH 7.4) the supernatants were sterilized by passing through a 0.45-m filter unit and the virus titters present in the filtrate were estimated by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) genomic DNA was extracted from one intermediate excised leg of individual flies using DNeasy Tissue Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) PCR amplifications were performed using primers and conditions previously described (Abd-Alla et al., 2007, 2011b), and the PCR products analyzed on 1% agarose gels. the flies had their last blood meals to allow for full digestions. the dissected SGs were preserved (at 4\u00b0C) in 150 l sterile saline. each of the pool of 10 pairs of SGs was homogenized using a glass/Teflon homogenizer and ultra-sonicated (Sonifier cell disruptor, Branson, CT, USA) tryptic peptides were analyzed using a tsetse fly database, a GpSGHV database, a contaminant database containing sequences of common contaminants. a maximum false discovery rate was set at the peptide and protein levels. logarithms (Log10) of normalized LFQs were used to compare abundances of different proteins between controls and virus-infected samples. proteins were considered to be up- or down-regulated when their Log10 protein abundance ratios were larger or smaller than zero. males were used because they are significantly more susceptible to expression of SGH symptoms than the females. males were reared for 4 weeks (equivalent to 12 blood meals) under the same insectaria conditions and handled as the parents. teneral (newly eclosed; non-fed) females were inoculated with either 2 l of the virus inoculum or 2 l of filter-sterilized PBS (mock infections) the females were then separated from the males and maintained in the insectary until they produced the F1 progenies as described above. qPCR data were normalized against the tsetse -tubulin gene. the samples with high virus infections were then used for mass spectrometry measurements as virus-infected samples. for negative controls, samples from 4-week-old male flies were selected for subsequent SG dissections. the supernatants were pooled and the proteins quantified using bio-Rad. equal quantities (600 ng) of the proteins were electrophoresed using 12% SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen) the gels were stained with colloidal CBB stain (NuPAGE Novex; Invitrogen) each of the gel lanes was divided into eight slices (equal portions) each of which was cut into approximately 1 mm3 pieces. a maximum false discovery rate was set at the peptide and protein levels. de-amidated peptides were allowed to be used for quantification. a maximum false discovery rate was set at the peptide and protein levels. qPCR analysis of the samples in the \u201chighly infected\u201d category revealed high virus genome copies in G. m. morsitans. qPCR analysis of the samples in the \u201chighly infected\u201d category revealed high virus genome copies in G. pallidipes. virus density levels in the virus-infected G. m. morsitans progenies were significantly higher (P = 0.0014) than the levels in the virus-infected G. pallidipes. the values in the parentheses (C) indicate the virus density levels. letters a and b represent significant differences between the samples. a cohort of SG proteins were detectable in the proteome of GpSGHV infected G. pallidipes, but were hardly detectable in the proteome of the mock-infected flies. the majority of the SG proteins in G. m. morsitans had less than 10-fold up- or down-regulation compared to the mock-infected controls. the proteins that were up-regulated and down-regulated in GpSGHV-infected SG are shown on the right and left sides of the Y-axis. dotted red lines represent 10-fold protein regulation. iBAQ denotes intensity-based absolute quantification. the first category consisted of proteins that were down-regulated or up-regulated in either or both G. m. morsitans and G. pallidipes proteomes. the second category consisted of the proteins that were detectable in one of the two Glossina species and in not the other. the figure shows a log-log PLOT of the host, viral and endosymbiont proteins. 23 of the 57 proteins showed more than 100-fold up-regulation in G. pallidipes proteome and they were all down-regulated in virus-infected G. m. morsitans. 134 proteins were up-regulated in both virus-infected G. pallidipes and SG proteomes compared to mock-infected counterparts. ubiquitin/SUMO activating enzyme uBA1 567 64.293 Alters protein function, location, trafficking, or targeting to 26S proteasome for degradation.

GpSGHV in other Glossina species is almost always asymptomatic. we have previously demonstrated the dynamics of the development of virus-induced SGH symptoms and trans-generational transmission of the virus in other species. however, the case of GpSGHV infection in other species has not been investigated. the comparable virus titters between the virus-infected G. m. morsitans and the mock-infected G. pallidipes suggest that the virus may be undergoing only partial replication in adult cells to maintain steady-state titters throughout the adulthood. this is in agreement with previous studies in G. pallidipes whereby, using a diagnostic PCR, detected GpSGHV PCR positives in 100% of colonized G. pallidipes GpSGHV-induced differential modulation of SG protein expression in Glossina raises the question of what host pathways are potentially globally regulated to facilitate successful virus infection. so far, we have not been able to elucidate the precise mechanism(s) through which GpSGHV induces overt SGH symptoms. some viruses attach to host cell receptors. this is followed by delivery of the viral nucleocapsids into the cellular cytoplasm and uncoating of the viral genome. a critical phase in viral pathogenesis is intracellular trafficking of viral nucleocapsids. some viruses activate GTPase-mediated pathways to facilitate intracellular trafficking. in the absence of Rab 1a/b, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) was unable to traffic from the ER to cytoplasmic viral assembly complexes, leading to a build-up of un-enveloped viral particles. GpSGHV genome is A+T-rich (72%; Abd-Alla et al., 2008), implying virus-modulation of Glossina mitochondrial transport machinery is a good possibility. the mitochondrial oxoglutarate/malate carrier protein is important for the tricarboxylic acid cycle, gluconeogenesis and nitrogen metabolism. proteasome -4 (D3TP07; Table 1) is a key protein in the ATP/ubiquitin-dependent non-lysosomal proteolytic pathway. eIF3m (D3TMN6; Cheshenko et al., 2010), molecular chaperones (e.g., hsp90; D3TS03; Kariithi et al., 2011) and 26S proteasome regulatory complex proteins (D3TN our data provide potential targets for future investigations of how GpSGHV replicates and is disseminated in the host. viruses must evade host's immune responses Upon successful cellular entry, a process for which the host's ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) has significant roles. a group of host antiviral defense proteins detected in this study were the V-ATPases (D3TLI6; D3TSC7; D3TLR6; and D3TLB1; Table 2). this leads to acidification of intracellular compartments necessary for multiple cellular processes. this could have been due to the presence of parasites in the mosquito. mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP; D3TRB1; Table 2) are homologous to the core 2 and core 1 proteins of the bc1 complex. their up-regulation in G. m. morsitans may be an adaptive antiviral host resistant response. some viruses induce cellular proliferation via modulation of specific signaling pathways. adenoviruses, adenoviruses, influenza A viruses (IAV) and HIV manipulate mRNA splicing by phosphorylating SRps. SRp 55 (D3TN12) was up-regulated in GpSGHV-infected G. pallidipes. a gene similar to ATPase 3 was found to be down-regulated more than 10-fold in the rice stripe virus infected small brown plant hopper. induction of the SGH symptoms is possibly a reflection of active production of viable progeny virus particles. this imposes a tremendous protein load in the ER, leading to ER stress. TKTL pathway may also be involved in the expression of overt SGH symptoms in G. pallidipes. current data provide potential targets for development of rationally designed antiviral strategies in large tsetse fly rearings for sterile insect technique. newly larvipositioned third-instar larvae of two Morsitans groups resulted in varying prevalence of SGH-like symptoms in developed adults. this ranged from 1.1% (Jura et al., 1993) to 4.0% (Kokwaro et al., 1990) in G. m. morsitans, and up to 100% in G. m. centralis (Sang et al., 1997). imply that either G. m. morsitans, at least in the SGs, is far less permissive to virus replication or that the virus undergoes limited replication in G. pallidipes. the difference in GpSGHV replication, i.e. partial replication or latency in G. m. morsitans, explains the differences in the repertoire of proteins detected in the SG proteomes of the two Glossina species. proteins that showed significant differential expression patterns in virus-infected flies are particularly interesting because they potentially reflect involvement in GpSGHV pathogenesis. also important were the nine proteins found to be up-regulated in proteome of G. morsitans but down-regulated in that of G. pallidipes. the GpSGHV SGHV038 protein was detected in the current study. it contains an arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid motif that may interact with the host's ILKs. a critical phase in viral pathogenesis is intracellular trafficking of viral nucleocapsids. the virus genome shares at least 28 putative homologs with the above-mentioned large dsDNA viruses, including HSV and whispoviruses. the precise virus replication and dissemination mechanisms are unknown. some viruses modulate the mitochondrial transport machinery to provide energy necessary for replication. TKTL protein is up-regulated more than 100-fold in G. pallidipes. this is of particular interest in this case of induction of the SGH symptoms in G. pallidipes. the hypothetical conserved protein (D3TRX7; Table 2) is 100% identical to the M. domestica anoxia up-regulated 1-like protein and its expression in our case is virus-induced. the authors made this observation prior to viral replication before any detectable disease symptoms. DNA viruses are known to be under host RNAi surveillance. these include invertebrate iridoviruses, baculoviruses, densoviruses, and plant viruses. asymptomatic infections rarely result in SGH symptoms in nature and in laboratory-bred Glossina species. ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase iron-sulfur subunit/bc1 was down-regulated during white spot syndrome virus infection in shrimps. the up-regulation of bc1 in these two cases could have been due to the presence of the parasites in the mosquito. some viruses use various approaches to hijack the G-protein-coupled receptors. other viruses such as KSHV encode potent and constitutively active GPCR homologs that modulate cellular proliferation. it is interesting to validate whether these virus and/or host proteins are actually involved in the development of SGH in Glossina. infected G. pallidipes (active viral replication), but down-regulated in G. morsitans (less permissive to viral replication) another host protein involved in viral assembly is tailless-complex polypeptide protein-1 (TcP-1; D3TP27 and D3TMK9; Table 1). ER stress results in the induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR), an evolutionary conserved prosurvival pathway that signals the nucleus to induce the expression of various chaperones. in some cases, interaction between the induced chaperones and viral proteins is critical for processing of viral proteins and assembly of mature virions. envelop glycoprotein B (gB) hijacks ILKs to induce the FAK-Src-PI3K-RhoGTPase signaling pathway. a critical phase in viral pathogenesis is intracellular trafficking of viral nucleocapsids. GpSGHV up-regulated in shrimps infected with whispovirus. the virus genome shares at least 28 putative homologs with the above-mentioned large dsDNA viruses. the precise virus replication and dissemination mechanisms are unknown. TKTL protein up-regulated more than 100-fold in G. pallidipes. TKTL provides a link between the glycolytic, pentose-phosphate, and nucleotide synthesis pathways. TKTL pathway allows synthesis of ribose without need of oxygen. eIF3m (D3TMN6; Cheshenko et al., 2010), molecular chaperones (e.g., hsp90; D3TS03; Kariithi et al., 2011) and 26S proteasome regulatory complex proteins (D3TRZ3) were detected in the current study. the hypothetical conserved protein (D3TRX7; Table 2) is 100% identical to the M. domestica anoxia up-regulated 1-like plant RNA viruses encode viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) that hijack the UPS components to promote degradation of key components of the host's RNA-interference (RNAi) system. DNA viruses are known to be under host RNAi surveillance. these include invertebrate iridoviruses (Bronkhorst et al., 2012), baculoviruses (Jayachandran et al., 2012), V-ATPase up-regulated in SG proteome of G. m. morsitans as opposed to that of G. pallidipes. mitochondrial ATP synthase down-regulated during white spot syndrome virus. protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A; D3TLN8; Table 1) is critical in regulation of cell proliferation, signal transduction, cytoskeletal dynamics, and apoptosis. some viral proteins such as the small T antigen of SV40 specifically target and displace PP2A's scaffolding B subunit thereby inducing cellular proliferation. SRp 55 (D3TN12) was up-regulated in GpSGHV-infected G. pallidipes (active viral replication), but down-regulated in G. m. morsitans (less permissive to viral replication) another host protein involved in viral assembly is tailless-complex polypeptide protein-1 (TcP-1; D3TP27 and D3TMK9; Table 1). enveloped viruses depend on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for maturation of viral envelope glycoproteins and proteins involved in the formation of replication complexes, assembly, envelopment and genome packaging. this imposes a tremendous protein load in the ER, leading to ER stress. ER stress results in the induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) RNAi bioassays to further investigate how asymptomatic GpSGHV infection is maintained in tsetse mass rearing facilities. we have designed RNAi bioassays to further investigate how asymptomatic GpSGHV infection is maintained. HK and HK analyzed the proteomics data sets. HK and EM annotated/characterized the proteins."}
