{"summary": "acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is an acute widespread demyelinating condition usually affecting young adults and children. it usually follows an infection or vaccination causing demyelination in brain and spinal cord. failure to identify a viral agent suggests that the inciting agents are unusual or cannot be recovered by standard laboratory test. magnetic resonance imaging brain showed ill-defined T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyper intensity predominantly involving the subcortical white matter at the gray-white matter junction in the right frontal, bilateral parietal lobes. there was no blooming or parenchymal enhancement associated with these lesions. a serial MRI brain showed increase in lesional size and extent with widespread edema, increase in hyperintensities on T2 and FLAIR in the right frontal, left temporoparietal, and bilateral occipital lobes. a trephine biopsy of the brain was done from her lesion in the left parietal area on day 7. cyclophosphamide IV (60\u2013120 mg/m2/day) (1\u20132.5 mg/kg/day) was given to her. the patient did not recover and became vegetative and succumbed to her illness. only 5% of the ADEM cases are attributed to be due to immunization. AHLE is a rare and fulminant demyelinating disease considered to be the most severe form of ADEM. the closest differential diagnosis of white matter involvement is multiple sclerosis is being ruled out on evaluating the clinical profile. a group from mayo Keegan et al. recently reviewed 59 consecutive patients with plasma exchange for acute disease. a group from mayo Keegan et al. recently reviewed 59 consecutive patients with plasma exchange for acute disease. the mortality varies between 10% and 30%, with complete recovery in 50%. poor prognosis is correlated with severity and abruptness of onset of the clinical syndrome as in our case who has fulminant course."}
