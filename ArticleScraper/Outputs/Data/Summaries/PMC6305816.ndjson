{"summary": "the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is an infectious viral agent that gradually extinguishes the immune system, resulting in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) the aim of this study was to construct an RNA-positive control based on armored (AR) RNA technology, using HIV-1 RNA as a model. the accurate evaluation of HIV type 1 RNA levels is the most important factor for understanding the natural history of HIV infection. PCR-based assays are common methods for the evaluation of viruses and the related transcripts in biological samples. controlling the reverse transcription step in PCR reaction and especially applying a control similar to the template sequence are critical requirements of this method. almost any exogenous RNA in an appropriate size can be integrated into downstream of the Pac site of MS2 phage genome. maturase protein protects the phage particle from degradation by ribonuclease enzyme. PCR was then performed at 94 \u00b0C for the synthesis of cDNA. for HIV-1 pol gene amplification, the cDNA synthesis step was carried out at 45 \u00b0C for 30 min. 38 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 64 \u00b0C for 35 s, extension at 68 \u00b0C for 2 min, and a final extension temperature of 68 \u00b0C for 5 min. plasmid was propagated in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and extracted with Qiagen miniprep plasmid extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany) each DNA fragment described above was verified by direct DNA sequencing before digestion with restriction enzyme. precipitation of AR-MS2 + HIV-1 The supernatant was collected and transferred into a 50-ml conical tube, followed by the slow addition of NaCl up to a final concentration of 2%. the precipitate was collected by centrifuging at 15,000 g at 4 \u00b0C for 20 minutes. the intact AR was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) primers and probes design and RT-PCR detection of AR-MS2 + HIV-1. RT reaction lasted 35 min at 50 \u00b0C, followed by a denaturation step for 15 min at 50 \u00b0C and 12 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u00b0C, 35 s at 62 \u00b0C, and 35 s at 72 \u00b0C. amplification of MS2 RNA was done at 45 \u00b0C for 1 h for the synthesis of cDNA. PCR was then performed at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 38 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 64 \u00b0C for 35 s, extension at 68 \u00b0C for 40 min and a final extension temperature of 68 \u00b0C for 5 min. plasmid pET32a-MS2 was recombinant in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and extracted with Qiagen miniprep plasmid extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany), as per manufacturer\u2019s instruction. the digested product was first digested by HindIII (Fermentase, USA) and notI (Takara, Japan) restriction enzymes. pET32a-MS2-HIV was cultured in 1 L LB broth medium containing 50 g/ml of ampicillin. protein expression was then induced by adding 1 mM of isopropyl-L-thio-D-galactopyranoside. cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 g at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. the AR was purified by a Sephacryl S-200 resin in TES buffer (10 mM of Tris, pH 7.2, 0.002 M of EDTA, and 0.15 M of NaCl) the intact AR was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), followed by negative staining with gel red dye. RNA molecule was first released by incubation at 80 \u00b0C for 5 min. RT reaction lasted 35 min at 50 \u00b0C, followed by 12 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u00b0C, 35 s at 62 \u00b0C, and 35 s at 72 \u00b0C without fluorescent collection. transmission electron microscopy of AR-MS2 + HIV-1 AR particles was precipitated with PEG 6000 and negatively stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid. the TEM image confirmed that AR particles had icosahedral shape and a 30-nm diameter. SDS-PAGE analysis of induced BL21 (DE3)/pET-32a MS2-HIV confirmed the expression of an 14-kDa protein. this 14-kDa expressed protein was close to the reported size of 14 kDa capsid protein of the MS2 phage. this indicates the successful expression of designed MS2-HIV in the MS2 phage. MS2 maturase, coat protein gene, and HIV-1 pol gene (336 bp) were obtained by RT-PCR from MS2 RNA (Roche, Germany) using superscript\u00ae III One-Step RT-PCR system with Platinum\u00ae Taq high-fidelity DNA polymerase kit. RT-PCR and PCR with 1% agarose gel analysis. the AR RNA was stable in +4 \u00b0C, although naked RNA was rapidly degraded. the concentration of naked and AR RNA was estimated by measuring the OD absorbance at 260 nm (Thermo ScientificTM NanoDropTM). RT-PCR was first performed on standard to obtain the limit of detection (LoD) of the assay. amplification plot of HIV-1 pol gene in armored RNA-MS2 phage was prepared by real-time PCR. RNA molecules are unstable in hard conditions such as high pH and high temperatures. the aim of current study is the constructing the positive-control RNA based on AR RNA technology, using HIV-1 RNA as a model. the recombinant plasmid was cloned into pET32a plasmid. 336 bp of pol conserved region of the HIV-1 genome was ligated downstream of MS2 gens. a part of the HIV-1 virus genome was packed in the MS2 phage capsid. the cyber green dye was used to perform PCR reaction. in the present study, we used the TaqMan method. positive control can be used as a basis for launching an in-house HIV-1 virus assay. it can be made available to laboratories and HIV research centers."}
