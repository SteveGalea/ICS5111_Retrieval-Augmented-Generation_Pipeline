{"summary": "most RTIs are caused by viruses. common respiratory viruses include influenza virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and rhinovirus. rapid and accurate identification of the causative pathogens of RTIs can help guide treatment decisions. xTAG RVP is a recent new qualitative multiplex molecular test for the detection of nucleic acids from multiple respiratory viruses and bacteria. it detects 22 viral and bacterial targets including influenza A virus, influenza A virus subtype seasonal H1, influenza A virus subtype seasonal H3, influenza B virus, RSV A and B, parainfluenza viruses types 1 to 4, adenovirus, hMPV, rhinovirus/enterovirus, human coronavirus- (HCoV nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples obtained from patients with RTIs and culture isolates of different swine and avian-origin influenza A subtypes. Viruses NxTAG RPP xTAG RVP Fast v2 FilmArray RP Influenza A virus Subtype (H1, H1pdm09, H3) (H1, H3) Influenza B virus Respiratory syncytial virus (A, B single RT-PCR for detection of human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus- (HCoV-) 229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, human bocavirus, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila was used as positive reference. a sufficient quantity of the samples was used for further testing with xTAG RVP and Film the viruses were cultured for 2 days in madin-darby canine Kidney (MDCK) cells with tosyl sulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone- (TPCK-) treated trypsin (2 g/ml) as previously described. serial tenfold dilutions of the virus stock with serum-free minimal essential medium (MEM) were tested in NxTAG RPP, xTAG RVP, a reference standard plasmid was prepared by cloning the target M gene amplicon into pCRII-TOPO vector (TOPOTM TA CloningTM Kit, Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) the copy number of the standard plasmid was determined based on molar concentration of the plasmid. the limit of detection of the M gene qRT-PCR is 10 copies per reaction at 95% confidence level. nucleic acid extraction, PCR, and detection were performed in filmArray according to manufacturer's instructions. the 133 NPA specimens were selectively collected from patients with symptoms and signs of RTIs. single RT-PCR for detection of human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus- (HCoV-) 229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, human bocavirus, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila was used as positive reference. the remaining samples were then recruited for NxTAG RVP evaluation. yl sulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone- (TPCK-) treated trypsin (2 g/ml) were frozen at 80\u00b0C until use. serial tenfold dilutions of the virus stock were tested with serum-free minimal essential medium (MEM) the target M gene amplicon was cloned into pCRII-TOPO vector (TOPOTM TA CloningTM Kit, Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. a series of 6 log10 dilutions, equivalent to 1 101 to 1 106 copies per reaction, were then prepared from the reference standard plasmid to generate calibration curves. PP incorporates multiplex Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) with the Luminex proprietary universal tag sorting system. the reaction product undergoes bead hybridization within the sealed reaction well. the hybridized, tagged beads are then sorted and read on the MAGPIX instrument. all 133 specimens were evaluated by NxTAG RPP. 153 pathogens were identified by NxTAG RPP. sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 95.2% compared with positive reference.

NxTAG RPP, xTAG RVP, and filmArray RP assays had high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of respiratory diseases. awareness should be raised that H3N2 could not be distinguished from H3N2v by NxTAG RPP. further investigation should be performed if H3N2v is suspected to be the cause of disease."}
