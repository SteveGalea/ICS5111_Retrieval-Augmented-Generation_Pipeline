{"summary": "introduction Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a positive single stranded RNA virus belonging to the family of Picornaviridae. it can lead to the development of severe neurological diseases including aseptic meningitis, cerebellar encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis. the first EV71 infection was recorded in California in 1969 [6], and then opened an outbreak in Bulgaria in 1975 resulted in 44 fatal cases. different EV71 strains are classified into PSGL-1-dependent and PSGL-1-independent strains. SK-EV006 (genogroup B3), C7/Osaka (B4), KED005 (C1), 1095 (C2) and 75-Yamagata (C4) are PSGL-1-dependent strains. some EV71 strains such as BrCr (A), Nagoya (B1), and Isehara (C) have clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a well-characterized process. dynamins are involved in the budding and scission of nascent vesicles. dynamins have been implicated in the budding of caveolin, phagocytosis and vesicle cycling. EV71 binds to SCARB2 and triggers a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis for its entry into 3T3-SCARB2. both viral infection and replication were well supported in 3T3-SCARB2 and RD cells, while SCARB2-independent EV71 susceptibility was observed in Vero cells. NIH3T3, RD and A549 cells were grown and maintained in modified Eagle's medium (Hyclone) plus 10% FBS, and 1% P/S. NIH3T3 cells at 80% confluency were transfected with pCMV-SCARB2 plasmid by cationic polymer-DNA transfection method. 2106 cells cultured in a 10-cm dish were infected with live EV71/E59 virus at a MOI (multiplicities of infection) of 1103. the culture supernatant was harvested 5 days after infection and passed through a 0.45 m filter (Sartorius) to remove the cell debris. 3T3-SCARB2 cells stained only with FITC-streptavidin were used as conjugate control for deducting the background. cells cultured at a density of 104 per well were incubated with varied MOIs of EV71 in 100 L of serum-free DMEM medium for one hour at 37\u00b0C. after one hour of infection, the cells were washed three times with 1PBS (pH = 7.2) and then cultured in 1s the reaction was stopped by adding 70 L 2N H2SO4 to each well. the absorbance was recorded at OD 450 nm using an ELISA reader. antibodies and western blot Anti-VP2 specific monoclonal antibody, MAB979, was obtained from Millipore-Chemicon International. membrane was incubated with 1: 5000 diluted MAB979, or 1: 2000 diluted anti-SCARB2 antibody, for 14\u201316 hours at 4\u00b0C. washed 5 times with 15 mL of assay buffer followed by incubation with horse radish peroxidase conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at a dilution of 1 in 5,000 (for MAB979). 20 L of protein G agarose beads and 1 g of anti-SCARB2 antibody were resuspended in 50 L SDS loading buffer, boiled for 5 min and then 10 uL of samples were subjected to western blotting. each experiment has been repeated at least two times independently. individual test wells were then washed 3 times with 0.5 mL of assay buffer. 100 L of an anti-mouse IgG-HRP (horse radish peroxidase) conjugated antiserum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1 in 5,000 dilution prepared in assay buffer was added to each test wells. the plates were blotted dry on paper towel, 100 L of TMB substrate (KPL) was siRNAs specific to mouse clathrin light chain B (Gene bank Accession No. M20469), mouse dynamin 2 (Gene bank Accession No. L36983), mouse caveolin-1 siRNA (Invitrogen) and negative control siRNA were purchased from Invitrogen. ization of cholera toxin subunit B (CT-B), 1105 3T3-SCARB2 cells were grew on a coverslip one day and then washed to remove any serum prior to the treatment with filipin. cells were cooled to 15oC and then incubated with 5 g/mL alexa fluor 594 CT-B conjugate (dissolved in 0.1% DMSO) a human lung adenocarcinoma lines were purchased from ATCC. the original NIH3T3 cell lines were purchased from ATCC. the original NIH3T3 cell lines were purchased from the company. esized commercially by GENEART, Germany and inserted into pcDNA3.1(-) vector (Invitrogen) containing enhancer/promoter of cytomegarovirus (CMV), simian virus 40 (SV40) poly A tail, and neomycin-resistant gene. EV71/E59 strain was propagated in vero or 3T3-SCARB2 cells. 1 mL of 1 to 1000 dilution of biotinylated anti-SCARB2 antibody (R&D) was added and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 hour. cells were stained with 12000 diluted fluorescence isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated streptavidin. 100 L of HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted at 1 in 5,000 in assay buffer was then added to each well. 70 L of TMB peroxidase substrate (SureBlueTM, KPL) was added to each well and allowed to react for 30 min at room temperature. cell lysate was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) after electrophoresis at 100 V for 90 minutes in 1X Tris-glycine SDS-running buffer, the resolved proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. membrane was incubated with 1: 5000 diluted MAB979, or 1: 2000 diluted anti-SCARB2 antibody, for 14\u201316 hours at 4\u00b0C. co-Immunoprecipitation 400 g of cell lysates from 3T3-SCARB2 and parental 3T3 cells were mixed with 3106 pfu of EV71. after five washes with lysis buffer, beads were resuspended in 50 L SDS loading buffer, boiled for 5 min and then 10 uL of samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blotting with anti-EV71 MAB 979 antibody assay plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37oC for antibodies to bind to the viral VP1 capsid protein, expressed on EV71-infected cells. 100 L of an anti-mouse IgG-HRP (horse radish peroxidase) conjugated antiserum at 1 in 5,000 dilution prepared in assay buffer was added to each test well. cells were infected with EV71 (MOI = 0.04) in serum-free culture medium. after 24 or 48 hours of incubation, cells lysates were prepared for western blot. blots were quantified using Image \u2013Pro Plus 6.0software. cells were washed and then followed cell culture until 72 hours. without infection with lentivirus-eGFP of A549 cells were included as GFP negative control. the same field of fluorescent and visible pictures was taken under the UV-fluorescent microscopy. monium chloride (NH4Cl) was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals. EV71 virus was cultivated in RD and vero cells that already express SCARB2. NIH3T3 cells which are naturally not susceptible to EV71 were transfected with pCMV-SCARB2 plasmid. RT-PCR analysis also revealed that NIH3T3, Vero and RD cells did not express PSGL-1. expression of SCARB2 in RD, vero, NIH3T3, and 3T3-SCARB2 cells. expression of EV71 capsid proteins namely VP2 and VP4 in infected cells was demonstrated by western blot using a VP2-specific monoclonal antibody. multiple capsid proteins of VP0, VP1 (36 KDa), VP2 (28 KDa), VP3 (25 KDa) and VP4 (8 KDa) were detected in the EV71-infected cells. RD, and Vero cells, were infected with two different MOIs of EV71. they were then cultured for 48 hours using anti-capsid MAB979 antibody. ELISA assay was performed in four different cells infected with 10-fold serial diluted 108 pfu/ml stocks of EV71. 3T3-SCARB2 cells expressed the highest EV71 capsid protein was detected in a dose-dependent manner. no EV71 capsid protein was detected in NIH3T3 cells which do not express SCARB2. lysate-viruses mixtures from 3T3-SCARB2 and NIH3T3 cells were blotted. the same membrane was stripped and then re-blotted with anti-SCARB2 antibody. the same membrane was stripped and then re-blotted with anti-SCARB2 antibody. cells were transfected with SCARB2 siRNA followed by 24 or 48 hours of incubation (t24 or t48) expression level in siRNA-transfected cells was monitored at 24 or 48 hours after transfection by Western blot using anti-SCARB2 antibody. expression of EV71 capsid protein in infected RD cells was completely inhibited upon transfection with 100 pmoles of SCARB2 siRNA. changes in SCARB2 protein levels compared to expression levels in 48 hours transfection of the cells with 100 pmoles control siRNA (Mock) as 1.0 were quantified using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software. transfection with 50 or 100 pmoles of SCARB2 siRNA had no inhibitory effect on the synthesis of EV71 capsid proteins. findings suggest that SCARB2 is the major receptor for EV71 infection in RD cells but not in vero cells. clathrin-mediated endocytosis played a crucial role in EV71 entry. 3T3-SCARB2 cells were pretreated with different doses of CPZ for one hour prior to the addition of MOI = 0.04 of EV71. downregulation of cellular 30 KDa of CLTB expression was observed at 24 and 48 hours after transfection with 100 pmoles of clathrin-specific siRNA. 100 pmoles of clathrin siRNA was sufficient to block EV71 capsid protein synthesis at 48 h post transfection. dynamin family proteins have been reported to tabulate and save membrane-coated vesicles and plays a role in membrane fission. dynamin plays a crucial role in EV71 endocytosis through clathrin-mediated pathway. 3T3-SCARB2 cells were treated with 100 and 200 pmoles of dynamin-2 siRNA or 200 pmole of control siRNA (MOCK) after 24 or 48 hours of transfection, the detection of dynamin-2 by western blot was conducted. ine kinase inhibitor, can interrupt caveolae-mediated endocytosis [58], [59], [60], and filipin, a cholesterol-binding agent, is capable of disrupting the caveolar structure and function [61], [62], [63]. 3T3-SCARB2 cells were treated with genistein prior to the infection with EV71. 3T3-SCARB2 cells pre-treated with CAV-1 siRNA did not resist from EV71 infection. EV71 entry using SCARB2 receptor is through clathrin- but not caveolae-dependent endocytosis. cells lysates were analyzed by western blot using MAB979 antibody. antibody was used to detect EV71 capsid protein. internal cellular -actin was also detected by blotting same membrane. virus containing early endosmoes are configured to form acidic (pH 6.0 to 6.5) vesicles and become more acidic as they mature to form late endosomes. progressive acidification of endosomes is required for the internalized viruses to establish their infection [65], [68] clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis require intact membrane cholesterol and are perturbed by methyl -cyclodextrin (MCD), an agent that removes cholesterol from the plasma membrane. cytotoxicity was observed at MCD concentration of 8 mM. NIH3T3 cells which are naturally not susceptible to EV71 were transfected with pCMV-SCARB2 plasmid and selected with G418 to establish a stable SCARB2-expressing cell line, 3T3-SCARB2. the expression levels of SCARB2 in vero, RD and 3T3-SCARB2 cells were examined by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody specifically against the cytosolic domain of SCAR expression of SCARB2 in RD, vero, NIH3T3, and 3T3-SCARB2 cells. the protein has molecular size of 80 KDa. the internal cellular -actin was detected by blotting the stripped membrane with monoclonal anti-actin antibody. 3T3-SCARB2, Vero and RD cells infected with EV71 were able to express capsid proteins with molecular weights in the range of 38 KDa (for VP0), 28 KDa (for VP2), and 25 KDa (for VP3) in NIH3T3 cells, neither the cytopathic effect nor the expression of viral capsid proteins was seen. NIH3T3 or SCARB2-expressing NIH3T3, RD, and Vero cells cultured in 96-well plate were inoculated with various MOI of EV71 for one hour at room temperature. after incubation, cells were washed three times with PBS and then cultured for another 24 hours before fixed by methanol. EV71 capsid protein was detected by ELISA assay as described in the materials and methods. EV71 virions were precipitated from 3T3-SCARB2 cells. but not from control NIH3T3 cells that corresponding EV71 capsid protein were observed. despite low levels of SCARB2 expression, vero cells possess other binding proteins to support EV71. 3T3-SCARB2 and NIH3T3 cells were mixed individually with EV71 particles. lysate-virus mixtures were then precipitated by protein G-conjugated anti-SCARB2 antibody. the same membrane was stripped and re-blotted with ant-SCARB2 antibody. expression of EV71 capsid protein in infected RD cells was completely inhibited upon transfection with 100 pmoles of SCARB2 siRNA. capsid protein expression was significantly reduced in cells transfected with 50 pmoles of siRNA. expression of capsid protein was not affected in mock-transfected cells. dynamin SCARB2 is known to induce clathrin-, but not caveolae-, mediated endocytosis in the internalization of HCV into target cells [51], and in HDL endocytosis [23]. clathrin- and caveolin-mediated endocytosis were used to annotate the pathway involved in EV71 entry. 50 or 100 pmoles of siRNA specific to clathrin or 100 pmoles of control siRNA were transfected to 3T3-SCARB2 cells. after 24 or 48 hours of transfection, cells were following lysed and detected the content of clathrin light chain B (CLTB) by Western blot using anti-clathrin antibody. dynamin family proteins have been reported to tabulate and save membrane-coated vesicles. expression of dominant-negative dynamin mutants (dynaminK44A) has been shown to block formation of clathrin-coated pits and vesicles. dynamin-2 expression could be inhibited after 24 and 48 hours. dynamin-2 was detected by western blot using anti-dynamin antibody. cells transfected with 200 pmoles control siRNA (Mock) as 1.0. cellular -actin was detected by blotting the same membrane with monoclonal anti-actin antibody. max dose of 20 g/mL genistein had no inhibitory effect on endocytosis of EV71 in infected 3T3-SCARB2 cells. similar result was observed in 3T3-SCARB2 cells pre-treated with the same dose of filipin that had no inhibition in EV71 entry into 3T3-SCARB2 cells. pretreatment of 3T3-SCARB2 cells with 20, 10, and 5 g/mL of genestin for one hour before MOI = 0.04 of EV71 infection was conducted. cells lysate were further prepared and subjected to western blot using MAB979 antibody to detect EV71 capsid protein. internal cellular -actin was detected by blotting the same membrane with monoclonal anti-actin antibody. DMSO was conducted following the protocol described in the Materials and Methods. transfection of 3T3-SCARB2 cells with 100 pmoles of caveolin (CAV-1) siRNA or control siRNA or control siRNA (Mock) prior to the infection of EV71. expression of CAV-1 in specific siRNA-treated cells compared to protein levels in 48 hours of cells transfected with 100 pmoles control siRNA (Mock) as 1.0. 3T3-SCARB2 cells were treated with varied concentrations of NH4Cl or chloroquine prior to EV71 infection. NH4Cl was able to inhibit EV71 capsid protein synthesis at concentration as low as 5 mM. chloroquine showed a dose-dependent inhibition at the concentration of 5 M with the maximum effect seen at 80 M compared to untreated cells. clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis require intact membrane cholesterol and are perturbed by methyl -cyclodextrin (MCD), an agent that removes cholesterol from the plasma membrane. cytotoxicity was observed at MCD concentration of 8 mM. 3 cells cultured with EV71 for a long time (>5 days) showed some non-specific infection and replication of the virus. this might be due to either mouse SCARB2 or some other cell surface protein functioning as a receptor for EV71. this may be due to low affinity of the experimental-used anti-SCARB2 polyclonal antibody towards green monkey SCARB2. SV enters target cells through both clathrin-dependent and -independent pathways of endocytosis. it has been reported that upon endocytosis, the native viral particles form subviral \u201cA-particles\u201d sedimenting at 135S. release of viral RNA from the protein shell of \u201cB-particles\u201d facilitates viral replication [55], [83], [84]."}
