{"summary": "the time-scale of epidemic spread usually provides ample time for rapidly evolving viruses to accumulate informative mutations in their genomes [1]. spatial diffusion can leave a measurable footprint in sampled gene sequences from these viruses. phylogenetic analyses are a common approach in molecular ecology, connecting historical processes in evolution with spatial distributions that traditionally scale over millions of years. minimizing the number of state exchanges over a phylogeny is misleading when rates of evolution are rapid and when the state exchange probabilities are unequal [14] Probabilistic methods draw on an explicit model of state evolution. this allows the ability to glimpse the complete state history over the entire phylogeny and conveniently draw statistical inferences [15]\u2013[17]. phylogeographic analysis would benefit even more from fully integrating spatial, temporal and demographic inference. we implement ancestral reconstruction of discrete states in a Bayesian statistical framework for evolutionary hypothesis testing that is geared towards rooted, time-measured phylogenies. phylogenetic analysis has revealed several genotypes of lyssaviruses (family Rhabdoviridae); genotype 1 has been found responsible for classical rabies, a fatal disease in terrestrial mammals throughout the world. rabies is endemic in Asia and Africa, where the primary reservoir and vector for RABV is the domestic dog. both datasets contain whole gene sequences from 192 A-H5N1 strains sampled from 20 localities across Eurasia. [22] explore these genes individually, as well as concatenated together, through a strictly parsimony-based ancestral reconstruction method. our Bayesian approach builds upon stochastic models. a white arrow indicates the A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 sequence. a filled white circle identifies the most recent common ancestor of the Gs/GD lineage named after this strain. the root lies considerably deeper in the NA tree resulting in a time scale that spans about twice the time of the HA tree. the NA tree results in significantly lower KL divergence than the HA tree. however, lack of phylogeographic structure in the data does not contribute to this difference because the NA trees return a lower association index (AI) HA C, BSSVS 1.7895 1.4383 0.24 (0.19\u20130.29) NA C, BSSVS 0.5660 1.1185 0.20 (0.14\u20130.26) HA D, BSSVS 1.7861 1.4059 0.25 (0.20\u20130.30) NA D, BSSVS 0.5811 1.1889 0.23 (0.17\u20130.29) Shared C. inferring the root locations for both the HA and NA root nodes is unsurprising. this finding is unsurprising as physical distances can be poor proxies for inverse-diffusion rates when dispersal results from a heterogenous mix of migratory birds. we also investigated the uncertainty that is accommodated by averaging over plausible trees by analyzing the HA data. the posterior support for Guangxi increases under BSSVS at the expense of Guangdong in the HA phylogeny. this may be an artifact of the reversible CTMC assumption we enforce. the posterior probabilities are shown for different expectations, for the gamma priors on the rates. a truncated Poisson prior with was used in the Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) procedure. by specifying a prior on the number of non-zero rates, we are able to construct Bayes factor (BF) tests for significance of individual rates. only rates supported by a BF greater than 3 are indicated. thin white lines and thick red lines suggest relatively weak and strong support respectively. a major advantage of the current phylogeography implementation is the ability to infer the migration process in natural time scales. the panels in Figure 5 summarize the temporal dynamics of A-H5N1 spatial diffusion inferred using the shared rate matrix. the lines connecting different locations represent branches in the MCC tree on which state exchanges occur. location circle diameters are proportional to square root of the number of MCC branches maintaining a particular location state at each time-point. the white-green and yellow-magenta color gradients inform the relative age of the transitions for HA and NA respectively (older-recent). phylogeny and the absence of sequences sampled closer to the root hamper precise inference of the location state at the root. the root state posterior probabilities for all locations range between 0.059 and 0.125, with Chad and Guinea receiving the highest probability (0.115 and 0.124 respectively) these two locations are geographically distant from each other, but they both host viruses from the most basal lineage in the phylogeny. panel B projects each branch into a geographic link that connects the branch's most probable starting and ending location states. the height represents the relative length of the time elapsed on the link's corresponding branch, while the color gradient reflects the relative age of the migration. the panels represent temporal projections of reconstructed migration events every 15 years. each MCC branch is translated into a geographic link that connects the branch's most probable starting and ending location states. the panels only show migration events or partial migration events that have occurred up to a particular date. an MCC tree is a point-estimate characterizing the posterior distribution of trees. branch lengths in these MCC trees are posterior median estimates. we color branches according to the most probable location state of their descendent nodes. despite different time scales for HA and NA, most probable location states agree on Guangdong as the predominant location of these sequences throughout their evolutionary history. in the HA tree, Guangdong and Hong Kong share a vast majority of the posterior mass, neighboring locations in which surveillance efforts report early Avian influenza cases [33],[34]. we list uncertainty measures for the marginal posterior distribution of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the Gs/GD lineage, named after the A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 strain very close to this node. the difference is not as pronounced as for the root node. HA (fixed) C 1.5030 2.5626 0.18 HA (fixed) C, BSSVS 1.7578 1.7026 0.18 HA (fixed) DI, BSSVS 1.7235 1.7364 0.18. we compared the KL divergence between the posterior and prior location distributions of the root and the GsGD most recent common ancestor. sensitivity analysis with respect to larger Poisson prior means reinforces that the data prefer a minimal number of rates. sensitivity analysis with respect to larger Poisson prior means reinforces that the data prefer a minimal number of rates, as increasing the mean leads to lower overall marginal likelihoods. a truncated Poisson prior with was used in the Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) procedure. by specifying a prior on the number of non-zero rates, we are able to construct Bayes factor (BF) tests for significance of individual rates. we can, however, not confirm epidemiological linkage directly between Guangdong and Indonesia. despite having more supported rates by this Bayes factor test, it remains difficult to univocally identify the pathways seeding remote localities as Japan and Indonesia. enables a flexible combination of the data without having to specify a single phylogeny for both segments. without BSSVS, sharing the rate matrix results in slightly higher KL divergences for both the root node and the Gs/GD node in the HA and NA phylogenies. by may 2001, the virus appears to have spread to Guangxi, Fujian, Shanghai and Hebei in the north of china. this is known as \u2018wave 1\u2019 in Southeast Asia resulting in severe A-H5N1 outbreaks in 2003. migratory birds could play a prominent role in this dissemination pathway. the location-annotated MCC phylogeny and demographic history for the african dog rabies lineages. we make this initial inference without either BSSVS or a distance-informed prior on the rates. we assume a piece-wise constant multiple change-point model on the effective population-size with 20 coalecent-interval groups. inferred phylogeny with branches colored according to the most probable posterior location of their child nodes. root location posterior probabilities are shown for the standard discrete model (opaque) and for the BSSVS extension with, in addition, distance-informed priors on the infinitesimal migration rates (transparent) the distance-informed priors in the latter had little impact on the results. maps are based on satellite pictures made available in google Earth. the maps are based on satellite pictures made available in google Earth. the maps are based on satellite pictures made available in google Earth. elucidating the phylodynamics of viral epidemics has important implications for public health management. we selected the Avian influenza A-H5N1 example to allow a convenient comparison of Bayesian ancestral state inference with the previous parsimony analysis. likelihood-based probabilistic methods consider branch lengths in ancestral reconstructions. the impact of the tree depth on root state reconstructions for the A-H5N1 genome segments clearly illustrates the importance of branch lengths. probability-based probabilistic methods allow for estimating the relative posterior probability of each location state at any position. our primary motivation for exploiting BSSVS to select among all possible migration graphs is to elucidate the limited number of epidemiological links that appropriately explain the viral diffusion process. this set both informs major modes of migration and reduces the high statistical variance that burdens estimation of all pairwise transition rates. rabies phylogeographic analysis confirms a longstanding presence of this viral lineage in west africa [28]. rabies phylogeographic analysis confirms a longstanding presence of this viral lineage in west africa. the ability to draw migrations over time promotes a more precise dissection of local and temporal RABV movement. after migration, the virus appears to establish local populations maintaining the viral lineage for at least a limited amount of time. rabies cycles and traveling waves have been well documented in wildlife across Europe and North America. the rate of dispersal is probably not sufficiently high to explain the short epidemic cycles as suggested by [47]. we hope to have demonstrated that Bayesian phylogeographic framework can contribute significantly to evolutionary hypothesis testing. using geographically-informed priors delivers a first step in incorporating GIS information. rate matrix contains non-negative off-diagonal entries and all rows sum to 0, yielding a stochastic matrix upon exponentiation. in matrix form, (1) Determining the finite-time transition probabilities involves matrix exponentiation, generally accomplished through an eigen-decomposition of. infinitesimal rate matrices of this form generate reversible Markov chains. vertices are those for which a single edge connects them. the graph must remain \u201cconnected\u201d so it remains possible to walk between any two vertices on. most transitions have non-neglible probability of occurring. deterministic model search strategies tend not to find the optimal set of predictors unless one explores all possible subsets. this exploration is generally computationally impractical as there exist such subsets and completely fails for. sites may expound spatial preference over the long-run. such preference can relate to known or unknown quantities such as population-size or geographic size of the site. we assume that all unnormalized rates in are a priori independent and Gamma-distributed with prior expectation and variance. the posterior probability that rate is non-zero, in this case the posterior expectation of indicator. we use a truncated Poisson prior with mean that assigns 50% prior probability on the minimal rate configuration. we consider rates yielding a BF3 as well supported diffusion rates constituting the migration graph. a model of low statistical power makes poor use of the information in the data. a successful model exploits this information to generate posterior distributions that are maximally different from prior beliefs. to calculate KL divergence, we employ a uniform discrete distribution as reference distribution. we annotate nodes in the MCC tree with the modal location state for each node using TreeAnnotator. to provide a spatial projection, we convert the tree into a keyhole markup language (KML) file suitable for viewing with Google Earth. deterministic model search strategies tend not to find the optimal set of predictors unless one explores all possible subsets. the approach augments the model state-space with a set of binary indicator variables and imposes a prior on the regression coefficients that has expectation and variance proportional to a diagonal matrix. this prior conveniently collapses to (4) where is the prior expected number of edges in graph. one natural choice says that there exists no spatial preference over the long-run. sites may expound spatial preference over the long-run. we explore the utility BSSVS and distance-informed priors in our phylogeographic models. we consider rates yielding a BF3 as well supported diffusion rates constituting the migration graph. deterministic model search strategies tend not to find the optimal set of predictors unless one explores all possible subsets. in the first step, the approach augments the model state-space with a set of binary indicator variables. in the second step, MCMC explores the joint space of simultaneously. this prior conveniently collapses to (4) where is the prior expected number of edges in graph. one natural choice says that there exists no spatial preference over the long-run and fixes for all. sites may expound spatial preference over the long-run. we consider rates yielding a BF3 as well supported diffusion rates constituting the migration graph. we take a standard statistical phylogenetic approach and assume that a separate CTMC characterized by generates. the joint model posterior distribution is characterized by generates. in many situations, inference on the posterior distribution of the root and internal node states is of paramount interest. we implement a pre-order, tree-traversal algorithm in BEAST that allows researchers to generate realizations of the root and internal node states following [20] and produce posterior summaries. each internal node, (10) where counts the number of sampled locations descendent to and is the frequency of the highest frequency location amongst these descendents. we report the posterior distributions and the AI compare these distributions to those obtained by random permutation of the tip locations. for a given phylogeny and tip locations, we obtain the association value by summing over each internal node, (10) where counts the number of sampled locations descendent to and is the frequency of the highest frequency location amongst these descendents. to provide a spatial projection, we convert the tree into a keyhole markup language (KML) file suitable for viewing with Google Earth. supporting
