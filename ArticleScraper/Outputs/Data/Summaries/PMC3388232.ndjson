{"summary": "TLR9 triggering alters gene expression and activates Akata cells in a myD88-dependent manner. most of the 2-fold changes in gene expression were upregulation and only few downregulation. most of the 2-fold changes in gene expression were upregulation and only few downregulation. TLR9 agonists induce CD40 expression in Akata cells in a MyD88-dependent manner. after 6, 24 and 48 h, 105 cells were harvested, washed with PBS and stained with PE-Cy5-conjugated mouse anti-human CD40 antibody. triggering with ODN CpG-2006 activates Akata cells to induce CD40 and STAT3 expression. results indicated that the ODN lacking CpG motifs activates Akata cells to a similar extent as the ODN containing CpG motifs. TLR9 triggering by CpG ODN does not impact on the cell cycle of Akata cells. trypan blue exclusion assay and PE-Annexin V/7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD) staining showed that treatment of DN-MyD88 Akata cells reduced the survival of cells within 48 h to below 50% of not treated cells. survival of DN-MyD88 Akata cells was not reduced by treatment with any of the three ODNs for 72 h. 105 cells were stained with PE-Annexin V/7-AAD and analyzed by flow cytometry. the double-negative population represents viable cells whereas PE-Annexin V-positive or double-positive populations represent non-viable cells. 106 Akata cells were treated with the TLR9 ligands ODN CpG-2006, ODN GpC-2006 and ODN CpG-2216 without or without z-VAD-FMK. cells were incubated with the Caspase-Glo luminogenic substrate to detect activated caspases. results represent the relative light units generated by active caspases 3 and 7. independent of the presence of EBV ODN CpG-2006 suppresses EBV lytic gene expression in Akata cells and primary B cells promoting latent EBV that may provide cell survival signals. treatment with ODN CpG-2006 or ODN GpC-2006 strongly decreased the percentages of surviving Akata cells or Akata 31 cells between 24 and 72 h compared with untreated cells. 106 cells were treated with the TLR9 ligands ODN CpG-2216, ODN CpG-2006 and ODN GpC-2006. survival of untreated, ODN CpG-2006-treated Akata cells and Akata 31 BL cells was assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay. hIL-10 does not prevent ODN CpG-2006-induced cell death. however, the same treatment resulted in drastic Akata cell death. treatment with recombinant hIL-10 (rhIL-10) reduced viability of Akata cells to 20%. rhIL-10 did not counteract treatment-induced reduction of BL cell viability. DN-MyD88 Akata cells were not affected by any of the treatments. rhIL-10 did not change the number of viable Akata cells. hIL-10 does not influence ODN CpG-2006-induced cell death. hIL-10 mRNA expression levels in BL cells treated with ODN CpG-2006. hIL-10 mRNA expression levels varied from 1.3 transcripts over HMBS in Ramos BL cells to 48 transcripts in Mutu-I BL cells. TLR9 triggering results in a wide range of hIL-10 mRNA expression levels. TLR9 mRNA expression levels differ between BL cell lines by up to sixfold. hIL-10 mRNA peak expression responses to ODN CpG-2006 did not correlate with the relative TLR9 mRNA expression levels. single-nucleotide polymorphism BL cell Epstein-Barr rs5743836 rs352140 line virus 1237 T/C 2848 G/A (P545P) Akata Positive T/T G/A Akata 31 Negative T/T G/G Mutu-I Positive T/C G/G BJAB Negative T/C G/G Next, we analyzed TLR9 SNPs in genomic DNA from primary BL single-nucleotide polymorphism rs5743836 1237 T/C rs352140 2848 G/A (P545P) BL cell lines N BL tumors N (%) Healthy individuals N (%) T/T G/G 1 4 (27) 178 (44) T/T G/A 2 5 (33) 165 (41) T/T A/A \u2014 2 (13) \u2014 1 (0) T/C G/A 2 1 (7) 55 function, showed downregulation following ODN CpG-2006 treatment. TLR9 triggering of Akata cells with ODN CpG-2006 increases hIL-10 expression. after 48 h, CD40 expression on ODN CpG-2006-treated cells was increased 2.7-fold compared with untreated cells. treatment with ODN CpG-2006 or ODN GpC-2006 induced increased CD40 expression in DN-MyD88 Akata cells. however, neither ODN CpG-2006 nor ODN GpC-2006 significantly induced an increase in CD40 expression in DN-MyD88 Akata cells. triggering with ODN CpG-2006 activates Akata cells to induce CD40 and STAT3 expression. ODN-induced cell death of BL Akata cells is MyD88-dependent Treatment with ODN GpC-2006 unexpectedly induced CD40 upregulation in Akata cells in a MyD88-dependent manner similar to treatment with ODN CpG-2006. we determined whether treatment with distinct TLR9 ligands would similarly result in a MyD88-dependent effect on cell survival. treatment of DN-MyD88 Akata cells with ODNs triggers TLR9 signaling via MyD88. cell death induced by TLR9 agonists is MyD88 dependent. 105 cells were stained with PE-Annexin V/7-AAD. this increase was abolished by treatment with the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK. findings were corroborated using PI staining. 106 Akata cells were treated with the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK. treatment of 106 Akata cells with or without z-VAD-FMK induces PARP cleavage. lymphates from 106 cells 48 h after incubation with the TLR9 ligands were analyzed by immunoblotting for PARP cleavage. treatment with class A ODN CpG-2216 showed almost no negative impact on cell survival compared with treatment with the class B ODNs CpG-2006 and GpC-2006. 106 cells were treated with the TLR9 ligands ODN CpG-2216, ODN CpG-2006 and ODN GpC-2006. the survival of untreated, ODN CpG-2006 or ODN GpC-2006-treated Mutu-I, BJAB and Ramos BL cells was evaluated by Trypan Blue exclusion. to this end, we used EBV-positive BL cells Mutu-I and EBV-negative BL cells BJAB and Ramos. the concentration of rhIL-10 was based on the peak hIL-10 protein concentration induced by ODN CpG-2006 treatment in Akata cells. treatment with ODN CpG-2006 for 72 h reduced viability of Akata cells to 20% but did not reduce viability of DN-MyD88 Akata cells compared with no treatment. 0.5 M ODN CpG-2006, 900 pg/ml rhIL-10 or combination of ODN CpG-2006 and rhIL-10 were added again after 48 h. 105 cells were stained with PE-Annexin V/7-AAD and analyzed by flow cytometry. the distinct survival of BL cells following TLR9 triggering with ODN CpG could be because of distinct magnitudes of ensuing cellular responses. similar variation of results was observed when analyzing hIL-10 protein levels. treatment of BL cell lines with TLR9 agonists induces distinct hIL-10 mRNA and hIL-10 expression levels. the magnitude of the level seemed independent of EBV status. distinct BL cells showed up to sixfold different relative TLR9 mRNA expression levels. TLR9 triggering in distinct BL cells resulted in distinct hIL-10 mRNA expression, not linked to presence or absence of EBV, and not correlated to TLR9 mRNA expression levels. positive T/T G/A Akata 31 Negative T/T G/G Mutu-I Positive T/C G/G Mutu-I Positive T/C G/G Mutu-I Positive T/C G/G BJAB Negative T/C G/G Next, we analyzed TLR9 SNPs in genomic DNA from primary BLs or blood from healthy individuals. Importantly, the TLR9 SNP frequencies were statistically not significantly different between BL cell lines, primary BL cells of different origin show distinct cell survival following TLR9 triggering. we previously demonstrated that TLR9 triggering counteracts lytic EBV reactivation in BL cells and promotes latent EBV associated with B-cell lymphoproliferation. pG type B ODN-induced hIL-10 expression in BL cells seems to considerably differ from that in chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells that were reported to undergo hIL-10-mediated apoptosis. pG type B induced cell death to the same extent as ODN CpG-2006. the association of the C allele rs5743836 with lack of cell death upon TLR9 triggering observed here in the Mutu-I and BJAB BL cell lines is striking. the presence of the C allele seems to result in enhanced NF-B activation following TLR9 triggering. this may lead to protection of ODN CpG treatment-induced apoptosis that can be observed in BL cells without the C allele.
