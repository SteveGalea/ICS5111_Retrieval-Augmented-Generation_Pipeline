{"summary": "emergency physicians are the front-line healthcare workers who are at risk for exposure to airborne and aerosolized infectious hazards during invasive and emergent procedures. a direct laryngoscope is used as a first-line airway device during endotracheal intubation. the risk of infection can increase during endotracheal intubation using a direct laryngoscope. no studies have examined the effect of motion during endotracheal intubation on respirator fit and increase the risk of infection. the study aimed to determine whether endotracheal intubation using a direct laryngoscope affected the protective performance of various respirators. quantitative fits of respirators were tested using the portaCount\u00ae Plus 8038 (TSI Inc., St. Paul, MN) the fit factor is calculated using the ratio of measured ambient particles to the intrarespirator particles. a size 4 curved blade with a Satin Slip Stylet (Mallinckrodt Medical, St. Louis, MO) and a 8.0 mm internal diameter (Lo-Contour Murphy; Mallinckrodt Medical, Athlone, Ireland) were used in this study. a manikin was placed on a bed and the bed's height was adjusted to approximately the height of the participant's midchest level. the fit factor for all three respirators was measured at two phases: (1) at baseline before the intubation and (2) during the intubation. all participants were provided with 10-minute breaks between each test. the primary outcomes were the fit factors for the three respirators. the Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for continuous variables to compare the fit factors before and during the intubations. differences with a P value of 0.05 were considered statistically significant. quantitative fits of respirators were tested using the portaCount\u00ae Plus 8038 (TSI Inc., St. Paul, MN) the fit factor is calculated using the ratio of measured ambient particles to the intrarespirator particles. the tubes are supported by a wire hanging around the participant's neck to support the weight of the tubes. the laryngoscope has a size 4 curved blade with a Satin Slip Stylet (Mallinckrodt Medical, St. Louis, MO), and the airway management trainer (Laerdal, Athlone, Ireland) all 24 participants completed a questionnaire regarding their demographic information. each participant completed the quantitative mask fit testing using N95-companion mode for each respirator type. the fit factor was measured during a period of 2 min with normal breathing after the user sealed the respirator based on the manufacturers' instructions. all participants were given 10-minute breaks between each test. the primary outcomes were the fit factors for the three respirators. continuous data were reported as median and interquartile range (IQR) because the data were not normally distributed. a post hoc analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and Bonferroni correction. Baseline phase Fit factor 200 (200-200) 200 (200-200) 200 (179\u2013200) 0.107 0.015 0.225 0.009 Adequate protection (percent) 100 (78.61\u2013100) 100 (100-100) 100 (76.1\u2013100) 0.081 0.031 0.266 0.104 Intubation phase Fit factor 200 (102.75\u2013200) 200 (200-200) 142.5 (63.5\u2013200) 0.001 0.001 0.048 0.001 Adequate protection both the cup-type and the valve-type respirators provided lower adequate protection rates during the intubation (both P 0.001) there was a marginally significant difference in the adequate protection rates for the fold type before and during intubation using a direct laryngoscope (P = 0.053) fit factor of valve type was decreased during intubation. 119.78 (9.59) Categorical variables are given as numbers (percentage) continuous variables are given as median (IQR) 3.2. Fit Factors during the baseline phase. all three respirator types provided similar fit factor values, with a median value of 200 (P = 0.107) continuous variables with a normal distribution are given as mean (SD). cup type: 3M 1860. Fold type: 3M 1870. Valve type: 3M 9332. success rate is the percentage of fit factor greater than or equal to 100. no studies have examined the protective performances of respirators during intubation using a direct laryngoscope in the emergency room. a component analysis of respirator user training revealed that adequate knowledge alone did not ensure proper respirator use in clinical practice. leakage can occur through three pathways: filter penetration, face-seal leakage, and (3) through the exhalation valve [27]. fold-type and valve-type respirators have flexible sealing surfaces, while cup type does not. fold-type and valve-type respirators have similar face-seal areas. compared to fold-type and valve-type respirators, cup-type respirators are rigid and have higher pressure that is generated by the head strap. the changes of the respiratory rate and intensity could influence the result of respirator fit from the present study. the times and motions needed to perform intubation may vary for each device, which could have different effects on respirator fit. a direct laryngoscope may not reflect real-life clinical situations, despite it being a high-fidelity manikin."}
