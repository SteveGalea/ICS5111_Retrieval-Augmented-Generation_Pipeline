{"summary": "RNA pseudoknots play an important role in many biological processes. they build the catalytic core of some ribozymes (1,2) and stimulate efficient programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF), a mechanism used by a wide range of RNA viruses to encode two proteins within one genomic region. pknotsRG offers three basic methods: standard MFE folding with pseudoknots. this method returns the structure of minimum free energy (MFE) containing a pseudoknot or not. the best structure in the folding space that contains at least one pseudoknot is reported. pknotsRG web server integration offers an easy and comfortable way to use the pknotsRG algorithm. input has to be provided in a FASTA format containing one single RNA sequence. the default window increment is set to one, unless otherwise specified. a 2D visualization is generated using the PseudoViewer Web service (10). RNAmovies displays the individual suboptimal structures one after another with an adjustable number of intermediate transition steps. RNAmovies displays the individual suboptimal structures one after another with an adjustable number of intermediate transition steps. the interface is accessible from any computer in any programming language implementing the SOAP protocol. several software development environments can automatically generate program code from the WSDL file for the integration of a Web Service into a local application. the list of suboptimal solutions is displayed as an RNAmovie (12) RNAmovies displays the individual suboptimal structures one after another. this allows for a smooth morphing from one structure to the next. there is currently no vizualization provided, when using the window mode. the interface is accessible from any computer in any programming language implementing the SOAP protocol. several software development environments can automatically generate program code from the WSDL file for the integration of a Web Service into a local application. rule 1: The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 part of each pseudoknot helix must have the same length and must not have an interruption. rule 3: If due to Rule 2 the helices would overlap, the first helix (a) is prioritized and the second one is shortened. 80% of these are simple recursive pseudoknots. IMPLEMENTATION We will briefly sketch the way we implemented these ideas as an extension of the usual dynamic programming (DP) scheme for RNA folding [5,6] -dimensional pseudoknot matrix competes with values of unknotted foldings for the interval (i, j) all suboptimal structures having an energy not more than thr larger than the optimal structure are backtraced. the backtrace procedure is called recursively on the substructures of s, yet with a smaller threshold."}
