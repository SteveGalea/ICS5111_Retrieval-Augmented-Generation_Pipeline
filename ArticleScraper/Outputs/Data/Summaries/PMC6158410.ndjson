{"summary": "mutagenic and nonmutagenic base and nucleoside analogues are among the most effective antiviral agents to control RNA viral diseases. ribavirin (1--d-ribofuranosyl-1-H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide) is mutagenic for poliovirus (3), ribavirin and other purine analogues have proven to be mutagenic for several RNA viruses and be able to lead the mutant enzymes displayed as a shared feature local alterations at the polymerase N terminus (residues 14 to 18) and loop 9-11 at polymerase motif B. a replacement by a smaller amino acid might not compromise viral infectivity. the results have identified the conformation of loop 9-11 as a molecular determinant for ribavirin incorporation. multiple-site effect on a phenotype is in line with increasing evidence that RNA viruses can often use alternative molecular pathways to respond to the same selective constraint. RESULTS Construction of a viable NLS mutant of FMDV. titers of FMDV C-S8c1 and FMDV-3D(M16A) determined by plaque assays. progeny from each infection was used to infect fresh cells. discontinuous arrows point at the passage number at which FMDV is considered extinct. ribavirin-mediated increase of Mfmin and Mfmax was higher for FMDV C-S8c1 and FMDV-3D(M16A) infectivity was lost at earlier passages than FMDV C-S8c1 infectivity. viral RNA was negative by passages 9 and 12 in the infections with FMDV C-S8c1. the expansion of its mutant spectrum attributable to ribavirin mutagenesis was more limited than the expansion of FMDV C-S8c1. despite FMDV-3D(M16A) being more vulnerable to ribavirin mutagenesis, the expansion of its mutant spectrum was more limited than the expansion of FMDV C-S8c1. the regions analyzed comprise residues 7160 to 8019 of the 3D-coding region for passage 1 and residues 6610 to 7051 and 7160 to 8019 of the 3D-coding region for passage 4. the origins of FMDV CS8-c1 and FMDV-3D(M16A) and the passage (p) conditions in the absence or presence of ribavirin are described in the legend to Fig. 1 and Materials and Methods. mutants exhibited similar poly(A)/oligo(dT)-dependent poly(U) synthesis (P = 0.33; Student's t test), RNA binding (P = 0.35 for sym/sub-AC, where \u201csym/sub\u201d is a symmetrical primer-template substrate, and two-way ANOVA) and template copying processivity (P = 0.83; Student's t test). the amount of [-32P]UTP incorporated, determined as previously described (70), is expressed as a percentage of the activity of 3D-wt. values are the averages from at least seven determinations, and standard deviations are given. similar results were obtained with sym/sub-AU. the kinetics of incorporation of the complementary nucleotide and of ribavirin monophosphate was calculated at position +1 of sym/sub primers UA and CA. for RMP incorporation onto sym/sub-CA, the kobs values were (18 3.2) 104 s1 for 3D-wt and (21 3.0) 104 s1 for 3D(M16A) 3D-wt and 3D(M16A) are more efficient in RMP incorporation than 3D-wt. the results indicate that 3D(M16A) is more efficient in RMP incorporation than 3D-wt. ribavirin-monophosphate was incorporated into sym/sub template primers. otide sequence of sym/sub-AU and sym/sub-AC indicates the UMP to be incorporated at the first position (U and dashed arrow) and RMP to be incorporated at the second position (circled R). nucleotide incorporation was performed as described for panel A. minimal alterations of kinetic parameters for nucleotide incorporation in FMDV 3D may suffice to increase RTP incorporation and facilitate virus extinction. 3D(M16A) was crystallized in the absence and presence of the oligonucleotide 5\u2032-CUCCCGGG-3\u2032. 41212 and P3221, were obtained, but only in the trigonal form was the RNA incorporated. tries to obtain ternary complexes by soaking 3D(M16A)-RNA crystals in a solution that contained RTP were unsuccessful.

Interestingly, structural comparisons of all FMDV polymerase complexes solved to date show two preferred conformations of the loop 9-11 that appear to be directly associated with the two different types of mutations. in/down conformation, where S298 is pointing to the active site, represented by wild-type 3D-wt-RNA complex in green (PDB iID 1WNE [36]), 3D(M16A)-RNA complex colored in dark green (PDB ID 6GVY) and 3D(K20E)-RNA complex colored in light green (PDB ID 4WZQ [32]. the central panel shows a cartoon representation of 3D (gray) with the ases that increase the RTP or FU incorporation adopt an in-down conformation, where S298 flips the side chain pointing now up and away from the active site. an FMDV that includes M16A in its 3D was engineered in molecular clone pMT28. infectious FMDV-3D(M16A) was rescued by RNA transfection of BHK-21c2 cells. the progeny from each infection was used to infect fresh cells. discontinuous arrows point at the passage number at which FMDV C-S8c1 and FMDV-3D (M16A) are considered extinct. the failure to detect intracellular viral RNA was confirmed by the failure to detect intracellular viral RNA using a highly sensitive reverse transcription (RT)-PCR amplification protocol. viral RNA was negative by passages 9 and 12 in the infections with FMDV C-S8c1 and by passages 6 and 8 in the infections with FMDV-3D(M16A) the regions analyzed comprise residues 7160 to 8019 of the 3D-coding region for passage 1. residues 6610 to 7051 and 7160 to 8019 of the 3D-coding region for passage 1. the origins of FMDV CS8-c1 and FMDV-3D(M16A) and the passage conditions in the absence or presence of ribavirin are described in the legend to Fig. 1 and Materials and Methods. the number of haplotypes represents the number of different RNA sequences. RNA binding and ribavirin monophosphate incorporation by 3D(M16A) were studied both enzymatically and structurally. the results are in contrast to those obtained with previous NLS KD mutants at 3D positions 18 and 20, which exhibited impaired RNA binding and processivity. the indicated concentrations of 3D were incubated with labeled sym/sub-AC (UGCAGGGCCC) RNA. the retardation of bound RNA by 5% PAGE was determined. similar results were obtained with sym/sub-AU (data not shown) the kinetics of incorporation of the complementary nucleotide and of ribavirin monophosphate was calculated at position +1 of sym/sub primers UA and CA. for RMP incorporation onto sym/sub-UA, the observed burst rate constant for incorporation (kobs) mean and standard deviation values were (9.3 1.4) 104 s1 for 3D-wt and (16 3.3) (104 s1) for 3D( incorporation of ribavirin-monophosphate into sym/sub template primers by 3D-wt and 3D(M16A). top, nucleotide sequence of sym/sub-UA and sym/sub-CA. middle,

substrate concentrations and incubation times,. attempts to obtain ternary complexes were unsuccessful, despite the use of different substrate concentrations and incubation times. the X-ray structure of the unbound 3D(M16A) was solved to 2.35. a detailed comparison of polymerase domains revealed an important distortion at the N-terminal region. residues R8 to K18 moved 8 toward outside the polymerase, compared with the wild-type enzyme. the side chains of residues R7 to R17 are shown in atom type representation. panel A shows the distinct interactions established between the RNA template and residues from V15 to K20. the RNA is shown as a green cartoon, and the active site is marked as red spheres. structural comparisons show that in all wild-type complexes R17 interacts with nucleotide t + 2. both nucleotides are oriented toward the active-site cavity. t + 1 and t + 2 overhang nucleotides were disordered and not visible. the B-loop can adopt different conformations when it binds to different templates and incoming nucleotides. the key residue of this flexible region is a strictly conserved glycine. poliovirus evidenced the direct involvement of the conserved B-loop sequence S-G-C in polymerase translocation. structural comparisons of all FMDV polymerase complexes solved to date. the 9-11 loop adopts mainly an in/down conformation. in mutant polymerases showing a decrease in RTP incorporation, the 9-11 loop adopts mainly an in/down conformation. complex colored in dark green (PDB ID 6GVY) and 3D(K20E)-RNA complex colored in light green (PDB ID 4WZQ [32]) the central panel shows a cartoon representation of 3D (gray) with the protein surface displayed as semitransparent. mutations involved in decrease or increase of RTP or FU incorporation are drawn as red and slate blue spheres. mutant spectrum complexity of RNA viruses has consequences for viral fitness, virulence, adaptability, and response to enhanced mutagenesis (40\u201350) in ribavirin-resistant mutants of FMDV of serotype C, the conformation of the N-terminal region of FMDV 3D was altered by replacements located elsewhere in the molecule. mutant spectrum compression is suggested by the average 200-fold-lower infectivity of viable clones retrieved from an FMDV population subjected to ribavirin mutagenesis. mutant polymerase incorporated RMP more efficiently than the wild-type enzyme, with minimal effects on the basal kinetic parameters for standard nucleotide incorporation. at least 18 different amino acid replacements at 9 separate structural elements in 3D of FMDV serotype C, A, or Asia 1 have been involved in significant alterations of copying fidelity. the distinction is also valid for 5-fluorouridine-triphosphate incorporation (27). significant examples are the different effects of polymerase replacement G64S on poliovirus versus its equivalent G62S on FMDV (33, 40, 41) the fact that some polymerase substitutions that increase fidelity in FMDV Asia 1 decrease it in FMDV O (59) oxycholate for 5 min at 25\u00b0C to minimize particle aggregation. the average genomic nucleotide sequence of FMDV C-S8c1 is identical to that of plasmid pMT28. cytotoxicity by ribavirin does not contribute significantly to FMDV extinction. an FMDV molecular clone with mutations A6655G, U6656C, and G6657C (genome residue numbering according to reference 65) was constructed using plasmid pMT28, which encodes an infectious transcript of FMDV C-S8c1 (64) the mutations were introduced into DNA by two PCRs with mutagenic oligonucleotide primer pair M16Aplus. plasmid encoding FMDV-3D(M16A) was linearized at the NdeI site and transcribed by SP6 polymerase, as previously described (66). to rescue infectious virus, 70% confluent BHK-21c2 cells were transfected with 0.1 mg of RNA using Lipofectin (Invitrogen), and at 72 h posttransfection the culture supernatant was used to infect a BHK-21c2 cell monolayer to produce the initial virus quantification was relative to a standard curve obtained with known amounts of FMDV RNA, synthesized by in vitro transcription of DNA plasmid pMT28 (64) the limit of detection was about 50 genomic RNA copies (67) negative controls

unlabeled sym/sub was added prior to the addition of the NTP. polymerization products and percentages of elongated RNA were analyzed and quantified as indicated for the standard 3D polymerization assays. kobs values were plotted against the reaction time for each NTP concentration tested and fit to a single exponential equation. sym/sub-UG solution was incubated with sym/sub-UG (sequence, 5\u2032-ACGUGGGCCC-3\u2032) and 2 mM ATP at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. incorporation rates at different RNA concentrations were plotted and adjusted to a quadratic equation to obtain X-ray data for both unbound and RNA-bound 3D(M16A) were collected at 100 K using synchrotron radiation. diffraction images were indexed and integrated using program XDS (74) and scaled, merged, and reduced with SCALA (ccp4i [75]. rigonal crystal form were obtained using the P3221 coordinates of the wild-type 3Dpol-RNA complex (PDB ID 1WNE) as a starting model. the weighted 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc difference maps clearly allowed to rebuild the mutated residue and other local conformational changes. ne C-S8c1 obtained by three successive plaque isolations of a sample of natural isolate C-Santa Pau Sp/70 (subtype C1). the average genomic nucleotide sequence of FMDV C-S8c1 is identical to that of plasmid pMT28, which was constructed with cDNA copied from FMDV C-S8c1 RNA. avirin concentration was the same as that used to select high-level ribavirin-resistant FMDV mutants. an FMDV molecular clone with mutations A6655G, U6656C, and G6657C was constructed using plasmid pMT28. the mutations were introduced into DNA by two PCRs with mutagenic oligonucleotide primer pair M16Aplus. plasmid encoding FMDV-3D(M16A) was linearized at the NdeI site and transcribed by SP6 polymerase. to rescue infectious virus, 70% confluent BHK-21c2 cells were transfected with 0.1 mg of RNA. viral RNA was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced to ascertain the presence of the triple mutation that encodes M16A. quantification was relative to a standard curve obtained with known amounts of FMDV RNA, synthesized by in vitro transcription of DNA plasmid pMT28

studies. cloning, expression, and purification of FMDV polymerase 3D-wt and 3D(M16A) were introduced in pET-28a3Dpol. genemic mutations A6655G, U6656C, and G6657C (that give rise to substitution M16A) were introduced using the Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) polymerization assays were carried out using sym/sub RNAs (71), as previously described (30, 32, 72) 1 M 3D (concentration as active-site equivalents) was mixed with 0.5 M sym/sub RNA, in the presence of 15 mM Mg(CH3COO)2, 30 mM MOPS (morpholinepropanesulfonic acid) (pH 7.0), 33 mM NaCl, and 1 U/ m/sub and 10 M the NTP for incorporation at the first position of the 3D-sym/sub elongation complex. incorporation of nucleotide at the second position was performed at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. 1 M the 3D solution was incubated with sym/sub-UG (sequence, 5\u2032-ACGUGGGCCC-3\u2032) and 2 mM ATP at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 50 mM HEPES (pH
