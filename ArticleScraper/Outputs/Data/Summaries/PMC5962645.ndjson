{"summary": "HF was the most active to inhibit the procoagulant activity of adherent human monocytes stimulated by endotoxin and interleukin-1b in vitro. HF was the most active to inhibit the procoagulant activity of adherent human monocytes stimulated by endotoxin and interleukin-1b. the most common use of the saponin Glycyrrhizin (GL) is in the treatment of liver disease. GL prevents hepatic steatosis possibly by protecting mitochondria against oxidative stress induced by HCV proteins and iron overload. GL and omega-3 fatty acids combination protected the liver from TAA hepatotoxic effects. benzoic acid, 2-thiobarbituric acid and paraffin were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA. all solvents used were of analytical grade. animals were housed under controlled laboratory conditions. group VII received 12 mg and 84 mg/kg body weight of HF and GL respectively. animals were sacrificed using ether anesthesia after 24 h. serum was separated for evaluating biochemical parameters. NP-SH tissue homogenate was mixed with 4 mL distilled water and 1 mL of 50% trichloroacetic acid. mixtures were shaken for 10\u201315 min and then subjected to centrifugation for 15 min at 3000 rpm. 2 mL of the supernatant were mixed with 0.1 mL of 0.01 M DTNB. the liver and kidney samples were fixed, placed in cassettes and mounted into automated vacuum tissue processor. the samples were embedded and blocked in paraffin wax. sections were stained with Mayer\u2019s hematoxylin solution and counterstained in eosinphloxine solution. decenyl Succinic Anhydride (DDSA) (Product 13710, EMS), 8 mL of Methyl-5-Norbornene-2,3-Dicarboxylic Anhydride (NMA) and 0.66\u20130.88 mL of 2,4,6-Tri(dimethylaminomethyl) phenol (DMP-30) were drained of most of the propylene oxide, leaving a little so the tissue did not dry out Statistical analysis Results are expressed as mean standard error (SE) of mean. Statistical analysis was performed, using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) the experimental protocol of the current study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the College of Pharmacy, Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, al-Kharj, KSA. group I served as control and received normal saline (1 mL, p.o.) group II received a single dose of CCl4 without any other treatment. serum creatinine and blood urea were determined using Randox Diagnostic kits. aliquots of homogenate were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 3 h. 1 mL of the supernatants were mixed with 1 mL aqueous solution of 0.67% 2-thiobarbituric and heated in a boiling water bath for 10 min. after cooling the mixtures were diluted with 1 mL distilled water and the absorbance's were measured at 535 nm. Tissue samples of 2\u20133 mm thick were fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde (Product 16210, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA) for 2 h followed by 1% osmium tetroxide (Product 19100, EMS) for 1 h. samples were dehydrated using 70% ethanol for 10 min, 100% ethanol for 10 min, and 100% propylene oxide (Product 8.07027.1001, Merck ultra thin section of 100\u2013200 nm were produced using ultramicrotome. sections were loaded on grid and stained manually in 1% uranyl acetate. results are expressed as mean standard error (SE of mean) a significant increase in the levels of transaminases (AST and ALT) alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and serum bilirubin was observed in the control group treated with CCl4. treatment with10 mg/kg (20.7 mol/kg) of SI resulted in a significant decrease (p.001) in the elevated AST, ALT, GGT, ALP and bilirubin levels in rats.
