{"summary": "discovery of oligomannosyl moieties as targets of bnAbs against HIV-1 has stimulated substantial interest in carbohydrate moieties as vaccine candidates. the heavy glycosylation of the HIV envelope with oligomannoses appears to be a defense mechanism for the virus to evade host immune recognition of protein-based neutralizing epitopes. the potential of viral carbohydrates as immunological targets for other viral pathogens warrants exploration. the targeted carbohydrates are tri-antennary type II (Gal14GlcNAc) or multi-valent type II (Tri/m-II) sugar moieties. the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV has 23 potential N-linked glycosylation sites. the two probes represent distinct classes of virus-neutralizing agents. the latter is \u201cmono-specific\u201d for HIV-1; the latter is \u201cpauci reactive\u201d being a potent neutralizer for several viruses, including at least HIV-1, HCMV, and SARS-CoV. ensine (2 g/mL), a potent -mannosidase I inhibitor, was used following the previously described procedures. the use of the -mannosidase I inhibitor allows the enrichment of high-mannose type (Man9) glycoform through blocking further glycosylation processing to complex carbohydrates. this allows the enrichment of high-mannose type (Man9) glycoform through blocking further glycosylation processing to complex or hybrid carbohydrates. ELISA results were presented without background subtraction in A\u2013C or with background subtraction in D and E. Lectins were applied at the concentrations (g/mL) as specified. the ELISA data shown here are representative results of multiple assays. ELISA plates were coated with native antigens expressed by Vero E6 cells. they were treated with a disinfecting fixing agent and gamma-irradiated to inactivate infectious virus particles while preserving antigenic structures of SARS-CoV. other Gal/GalNAc-reactive lectins were only marginally reactive with SARS-CoV antigens. GNA is specific for the Man1,3Man and Man1,6Man moieties of oligomannoses. Con A recognizes terminal Man1moieties that are more broadly expressed by mannose-containing antigens. GNA-positive staining of HCMV without parallel Con A reactivity suggests an alternative possibility, i.e., presence of other carbohydrate moieties that are negative or weakly reactive with Con A but strongly reactive with GNA. a carbohydrate antigen with such differential reactivity between GNA and Con A is a yeast-derived phosphomannan polysaccharide (P-Man), which is nevertheless not present in the viral glycome. carbohydrate microarrays reveal distinct models of glycan recognition by GNA and 2G12. antigens spotted include carbohydrates (1\u201339), lipids/liposomes (40\u201391), and proteins (92\u2013104). microarray detections shown as mean fluorescent intensities (MFIs) of triplicate microspots for arrays stained with PHA-L, GNA, and 2G12. results were compared using overlay plots of the MFIs of staining signal (blue bars) versus those of local backgrounds surrounding the antigen microarrays (red bars) GNA and 2G12 show minimal or no cross-relativities with irrelevant antigens. 2G12 is \u201cmono-specific\u201d for Man9-clusters (9 and 11) as expected. GNA is \u201cpauci reactive\u201d with a number of glycan targets. hek293 cells in the presence of kifunensine (2 g/mL), a potent -mannosidase I inhibitor, following the previously described procedures. the use of the -mannosidase I inhibitor allows the enrichment of high-mannose type (Man9) glycoform through blocking further glycosylation processing to complex carbohydrates. Bal-gp120-Man9 was produced to resemble the native envelope spikes of HIV, which are almost entirely coated with ELISA results were presented without background subtraction in A\u2013C or with background subtraction in D and E. Lectins were applied at the concentrations (g/mL) as specified. a comparative microarray analysis of the glyco-epitopes that are recognized by PHA-L, GNA, and 2G12. ELISA plates were coated with native SARS-CoV antigens. they were treated with a disinfecting fixing agent and gamma-irradiated to inactivate infectious virus particles. this assay shows that GNA is strongly positive with SARS-CoV. GNA is specific for the Man1,3Man and Man1,6Man moieties of oligomannoses. Con A recognizes terminal Man1moieties that are more broadly expressed by mannose-containing antigens. the relative binding activity of GNA is markedly higher than the Con-A activity in the HCMV-ELISA assay. the selective GNA-positive staining of HCMV without parallel Con A reactivity suggests an alternative possibility. a carbohydrate antigen with such differential reactivity between GNA and Con A is a yeast-derived phosphomannan polysaccharide (P-Man), which is nevertheless not present in the viral glycome. microarrays reveal distinct models of glycan recognition by GNA and 2G12. antigens spotted include carbohydrates (1\u201339), lipids/liposomes (40\u201391), and proteins (92\u2013104). microarray detections are shown as the mean fluorescent intensities (MFIs) of triplicate microspots for the arrays stained with PHA-L, GNA, and 2G12. results were compared using overlay plots of the MFIs of staining signal (blue bars) versus those of local backgrounds surrounding the antigen microarrays. GNA and 2G12 show minimal or no cross-relativities with irrelevant antigens. 2G12 is \u201cmono-specific\u201d for Man9-clusters (9 and 11) as expected. liposomes and proteins were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and saline (0.9% NaCl), respectively. printed microarrays were air-dried and stored at room temperature without desiccant before application. microarray data-Processing and Statistical Analysis Fluorescence intensity values for each array spot and its background were calculated using SAS Institute\u2019s JMP-Genomics software package (Cary, NC, USA) microarray detections are shown as the mean fluorescent intensities (MFIs) of triplicate detections captured by ScanArray 5000A for arrays stained with PHA-L, GNA, or 2G12. anti-glycan antibodies or biotinylated lectins were pre-titrated in 1% BSA, PBST for ELISA. the bound antibodies were revealed by an alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugate of goat anti-human anti-human IgG-Fc-specific antibody. stained microarrays were rinsed five times with PBS, pH 7.4, with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. then blocked by incubating the slides in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS containing 0.05% (w/v) NaN3 at room temperature (RT) for 30 min. stained slides were air-dried and stored at room temperature without desiccant. Array 5000A for the arrays stained with PHA-L, GNA, or 2G12. the whole microarray datasets for PHA-L, GNA, and 2G12 were presented in Supplementary Table S2. lated lectins were pre-titrated in 1% BSA, PBST for ELISA. the bound antibodies were revealed by an alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugate. the biotinylated lectins were quantified by AP-streptavidin-conjugate. is unlikely suitable for anti-virus therapy in vivo. effort must also be made to establish GNA-like potent and virus-neutralizing antibodies."}
