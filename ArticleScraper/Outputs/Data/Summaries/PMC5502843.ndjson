{"summary": "GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that causes watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and high mortality in suckling piglets (1, 2). the virus is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that causes watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and high mortality in suckling piglets. the complete genome of PEDV strain 750A has a high nucleotide identity of 98.2% to 99.8% with other PEDV strains circulating in Asia, North America, and Europe in recent years. 750A has a relatively low nucleotide identity (96.8% to 97.7%) with classical strains and vaccine strains (CV777 and DR13) in Asia. complete genome sequence of PEDV strain CH/GX/2015/750A has been deposited in GenBank under the accession no. KY793536."}
