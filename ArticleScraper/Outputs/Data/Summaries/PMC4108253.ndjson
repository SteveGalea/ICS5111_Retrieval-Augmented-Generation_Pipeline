{"summary": "live cell imaging techniques are of great interest for biomedical researchers. advances in optical methods, in vitro culture systems and molecular biology led to the advent of live cell imaging techniques. the technique provides better insight into the biological role of target molecules by allowing researchers to investigate the dynamic processes occurring in living cells in real time. live cell imaging has taken a leap in understanding the complex cellular dynamics. the technique of live cell imaging has taken a leap in understanding the detailed and complex cellular dynamics. it has been employed to study functional genetics of liver specific diseases including steatosis. the luciferase from Renilla sp. (RLuc) uses a different substrate \u201ccoelenterazine\u201d. it produces a higher and stable luminescent signal as compared to the FLuc. this led to the development of a more photostable and robust luciferase. the luciferase localizes in nucleus, cytosol and in peroxisomes. the luciferase was tested in cell lines such as NIH/3T3 using various promoters. it was shown that the luciferase localizes in nucleus, cytosol and in peroxisomes. additional mutants were generated replacing the Serine65 with threonine, alanine, glycine, cysteine or leucine leading to a protein with a single absorbance peak at 489 nm. enhanced GFP (EGFP) was developed with the modification and mutations described above at various positions of wtGFP. Sapphire S72A, Y145F, T203I 399 511 ++ 78 [20] Emerald F64L, S65T, S72A, N149K, M153T, I167T 487 509 +++ 116 [21] Superfolder S30R, Y39N, F64L, (S65T/G65T), F99S, N105T, Y145F, M153T, V163A, I171V, A206 several fluorescent proteins from different species have been discovered with various excitations and emission spectra. a major drawback of BFP was its low intensity and faster photobleaching [33]. EBFP was developed by the dauherty\u2019s group. it was reported to be 40-fold more photostable and brighter than the conventional BFP. further modifications of EBFP 1.2 led to the development of EBFP 1.5 which was more photostable than its predecessor EBFP 1.2. mTagBFP was mutated at I174A to give rise to mTagBFP2. a 1.5 fold more photostable BFP with a similar spectral profile and maturation half time as that of the parent protein. CFP was also brighter and more photostable when compared to BFP. monomeric RFPs have been developed from DsRed through a series of mutations. resultant proteins exhibited different maturation rate as well as fluorescent properties, i.e. mOrange, mKO, mStrawberry, mCherry, Tag RFP, mPlum and tdTomato. multi-color live cell imaging is an effort to observe multiple organelles, their spatial organisation, interactions between organelles and their constituent components. the successful application of the technique demands FPs and dyes with non-overlapping emission spectra. lipid droplet staining has been done since a long time but only with organic dyes such as oil red. the use of larger FPs such as GFP in reporter assays hinders the function of the fusion proteins in the cells. small tag systems such as tetracysteine motif (CCXXCC) were genetically inserted into the target proteins that can bind with high specificity to biarsenical dyes, Resorufin Arsenical Helix binder (ReAsH) and FIAsH (Fluorescein Arsenical Helix bin maxima of 593 nm and 608 nm, respectively, was successfully tested for FRET studies with GFP and YFP probe pairs in HeLa cells. similar protein-ligand complexes were synthesized and used to improve the quantum yield, tetracysteine binding affinity and reduce the cytotoxicity of these complexes. the MG-ester signal was detected from the plasma membrane while MG-11p emitting fluorescence inside the cells suggested a localization near endoplasmic reticulum. MG-Ester, an organic dye and its membrane impermeable variants (MG-11P) are used in FAP imaging. the transfer of genes in the mammalian cells requires much more sensitive approaches, and several methods have been developed for effective transfer and stable expression of genes in these cells. the introduction of a selection marker (antibiotic resistance gene) allows greater control over the expression of foreign genes. pCNS and pCNS-D2 vectors were reported to express cloned genes in cell lines. luciferase expression was higher in HepG2, Hep3B, HeLa, SNU638 and SNU668 cells. a 5\u2019 Untranslated Region (5\u2019 UTR) was identified. viral vectors have been developed including the recently explored corona virus of the SARS virus family. this RNA based vector provides a stable and prolonged expression for more than 30 passages in different cell types. the later is the most frequently used method for gene transfer. pCNS/pCNS-D2 hCMV/T7 nil stable/transient nil stable nil [62,63] pSV2Cat SV2 stable/transient nil stable/transient stable/transient [60] PCMVcat CMV stable/transient nil stable/transient stable/transient [60] Puast SV 40 expressed genes in yeast [60] ral vectors have been modified to infect mammalian cell lines. the whole plasmid was packed into the baculoviral vector Bac-B4. the transfected cells showed a 100-fold increase in the vector titer. the transfected cells showed a transfection efficiency of 60%. bactofection is considered to be hazard free and is employed for a variety of cell lines. further methods of nonviral based gene transfer have been developed for higher efficiency and less toxicity to cells. lipofection is the safest method to transfer genes into mammalian cells. it involves formation of a positively charged lipid-nucleic acid complex. the positive charge facilitates attachment to the cell membrane and entry via endocytosis. chloroquine and polyvinylpyrolidone have been used effectively to increase transfection efficiency of different delivery methods by reducing the lysosomic degradation of the transfected nucleic acid. but the cytotoxicity of these agents raises concerns against their use. a recent study showed the improved transfection efficiency and low cytotoxicity of an anionic glycopolymer derivative of PEI in HepG2 and HEK 293 T cells. different ratios of nucleic acid and lipids were tested ranging from 1:1 to 9:1 and the ratio of 3:1 was found to be optimum in terms of cell viability and transfection efficiency. adenoviral vectors have been used in hepG2 cells to study the function of genes such as the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in drug induced hepatotoxicity. adenoviral vectors are capable of transfecting primary hepatocytes stimulated by mitogens. hepatocytes can produce lipid droplets leading to pathological conditions like fatty liver disease. hepatocytes can also produce lipid droplets leading to pathological conditions. oil red O staining requires cell permeable dyes/fluorochromes. dansyl Pentane (MDH) was developed for lipid droplet staining with excitation and emission in the range of 405 and 480 nm. such an approach allowed the study of perlipin 2 interactions on the lipid droplet as defined by the MDH stain. the use of MDH as a mean to study lipid droplets was reported. FRET and FRAP methods were used as a means to study complexes. MDH stain provides an efficient stain for lipid droplets. it allows proteins to interact with the droplets to be tagged with longer wavelength fluorescent proteins. the mouse perilipin 2 gene was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pECFPN1 and was stably expressed in mouse L fibroblast cells. a confocal microscopy based FRET assay was employed to determine the interaction between lipids and proteins in the cell. FRAP studies Fluorescent Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) uses the concept of activating a fluorescent protein observing its intensity and subsequent bleaching by excess light to measure the bleached region for binding activity to the surface of the secondary structure or membrane. plin5 interacts with ATGL but not plin1 [27] FP-mADRP was detected from the surface of spherical intracellular structures while EGFP was seen throughout the HuH-7 cells. adenovirus mediated transfer of Cav1-GFP in NIH3T3 cells demonstrated that caveolins are found on lipid droplets. proximity ligation assay is a relatively inexpensive quantitative technique with high sensitivity. the technique is developed on the principles of antibody targeted assay, split reporter assay and polymerase based amplification of oligonucleotides. luciferase (FLuc) emits luminescence (up to 560 nm) without the requirement of external light excitation and uses ATP for the conversion of its substrate luciferin to oxyluciferin in a luciferase enzyme catalyzed oxidation reaction. luciferase has been isolated from members of the coelenterazine species. the luciferase from Renilla sp. (RLuc) uses a different substrate \"coelenterazine\" and produces a higher and stable luminescent signal as compared to the FLuc. however, a major limitation of FLuc and RLuc is their short life span. this led to the development of a more photostable and robust luciferase. wild type GFP (wtGFP) is a 26.9 kDa protein with a major and a minor excitation peak. the protein is formed by three amino acid residues consisting of ser65-tyr66-gly67 and held by a single -helix surrounded by 11 -barrel sheets. a single point mutation at the S65T residue resulted in enhanced fluorescence at the same emission spectra. several mutants of wtGFP including Enhanced GFP (EGFP) and Emrald GFP were generated which retained its fluorescent properties. new mutant of Sapphire called Turbo Sapphire has better pH-stability with UV excitation and thus has a larger separation between excitation and emission wavelengths. protein BFP Y66H, Y145F 360 442 + EBFP BFP + F64L, S65T 380 440 + 27 [16] EBFP 1.2 EBFP + S30R, Y36N, T65S, S72A, N105T, N105T, N198S, A206V 379 446 ++ 53 [23] EBFP2 EBFP1.2 + F145H, H148N, M153A 381 449 blue fluorescent proteins development of different variants of GFP with different absorption and emission spectra provided the opportunity for simultaneous multi-color staining of the cells. early variants included the blue fluorescent protein (BFP), developed by introducing a point mutation (Y66H) to shift the absorbance and emission spectra to 384 nm and 448 nm, respectively, and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) which was discovered from mutants of A.victoria[17]. EBFP2 was reported to be 4-fold brighter and 550-fold more photostable than EBFP and 1.4-fold brighter than Azurite. both EBFP2 and Azurite tend to dimerize when expressed in cells at higher concentrations. this was overcome by replacing the alanine residue at position 206 by valine. three variants of Enhanced Yellow FP were developed. citrine (monomer), Venus - a fast maturing FP at 37\u00b0C. yellow fluorescent protein for energy transfer (YPet) used in FRET along with cyan FPs. live cell imaging has advanced mainly due to the advent of FPs tagged biomolecules with specific functions in the cell. FPs have successfully been cloned into bacteria to mammalian cell lines either alone as a marker or along with a gene of interest as a fusion protein. elles of a live cell are listed in Table 2. elles of a live cell are listed in Table 2. elles of a live cell are listed in Table 2. mercuri) fluorescein is a cell permeable non-toxic ligand that binds specifically to four cysteine residues (I, i + 1, i + 4 and i + 5) of the target proteins helical structure to emit fluorescence. out of the fourteen different FlAsH ligands screened, FlAsH-EDT2 showed strong affinity for hexamer peptides. membrane permeable and impermeable MG FAPs were developed by screening a library of human single-chain antibodies using derivatives of thiazole orange and malachite green. the screened clones have comparatively smaller size (the smallest being 110 amino acids long that is almost half the size of GFP) and thousands-fold higher brightness as compared to the typical FPs. membrane bound proteins tagged with both FAP and fluorescent proteins are useful in studying protein positioning across the membrane. these genes were designed to study plasma membrane and transporter proteins such as the insulin regulated glucose transporter (GLUT4) and 2 adrenergic receptor (2AR) stable transfection vectors facilitate the integration of the transgene in the host cell genome. the transient expression vectors reside in the cytosol without replicating. stable transfection vectors facilitate the integration of the transgene in the host cell genome. incorporation of UTR regions in promoter of viral vectors boosted expression of genes of interest in host cells such as CHO or HepG2. the UTR regions were found to be the Internal Ribosome Entry Sequence being responsible for uninterrupted expression of genes. plasmid expressing fusion protein (target protein and fluorophore) under a common promoter (P) in host cells. incorporation of a selection marker (SM) in the plasmid provides opportunity for controlled expression of the cloned genes. a variety of methods have been developed for a robust and efficient gene transfer without causing toxicity to the host cell. more advanced methods have come into place for gene transfer according to the need for expression as a plasmid entity or as an integrated system in genome which also can be used for gene knockouts. the metallothione promoter (Bac-ME) vector showed a transfection efficiency of 90%. the baculoviral vectors were successfully used for gene transfer experiments in several mammalian cell lines. non-viral vectors were developed for transfection of viral sensitive mammalian cell lines. a modified T-Rex plasmid system is first transfected into the cell line using a lipid based method with an efficiency of 70% and is activated by tetracycline. after 18 days of initial transfection a second plasmid can be introduced with 40% efficiency that permits the study of complex biochemical reactions involving different factors. lipofection involves formation of a positively charged lipid-nucleic acid complex. the positive charge facilitates attachment to the cell membrane and entry via endocytosis. different commercially available kits with a broad range of efficiency on different cell lines are available. no toxicity has been reported using sucrose as lysosomotropic agent. no toxicity has been reported using sucrose as lysosomotropic agent. a concentration range of 5 to 500 mM was safe in various cell lines. different ratios of nucleic acid and lipids were tested ranging from 1:1 to 9:1 and the ratio of 3:1 was found to be optimal in terms of cell viability and transfection efficiency. polyspermine Imidazole-4, 5-amide complex (PSIA) was employed with HepG2 as well as Cos 7 cell lines for gene targeted therapy. ant adenoviral vector with a transfection efficiency of approximately 70%. some viral vector-based methods have been used successfully. the murine retroviral vector can transfect primary hepatocytes stimulated by mitogens (epidermal or hepatocyte or keratinocyte growth factors) cultured human hepatocytes treated with palmitic acid (PA) and oleic acid (OA) and the cardiovascular drug amiodarone are known to cause steatosis and steatohepatitis. a long wavelength FP and a short range dye Monodansyl Pentane (MDH) were developed for lipid droplet staining with excitation and emission in the range of 405 and 480 nm [106] lipid droplets interact with other organelles in the cell. adipocyte Differentiation-Related Proteins (ADRP also known as perilipin 2/plin2) and Perilipins (Plins) also interact with other organelles. confocal microscopy based FRET assays have been employed to study co-localization of lipid droplets and mitochondria in porcine oocytes. perilipin 2 gene was tagged with CFP and followed by cyan fluorescence. two ECFP molecules were fused. the result was a further decrease in intensity due to multiple excited states. this was resolved by site directed mutagenesis of the His148 residue to aspartate. adipocyte triglyceride lipase (Adipocyte Triglyceride Lipase) activates activator --hydrolase domain-containing 5. plin5 interacts with ATGL but not plin1 [27]. fusion products were transfected in HuH-7 cells. results in both live cells and paraformaldehyde fixed cells showed localization of GFP-mADRP at the surface of lipid droplets stained with the BODIPY dye. EGFP fused to the N terminus of human and mouse forms of ADRP/plin2 was used in further studies. caveolins are found on lipid droplets, but the functional significance of this association is poorly understood. the amplified product can be ligated by addition of complementary oligonucleotide and ligase enzyme. this leads to the formation of more than 1000 copies of the complement of 100 bp in one hour using the phi29 polymerase. this highly versatile technique can also be adapted to detect post-translational modifications. perilipin 2 was tagged with CFP and followed by cyan fluorescence. perilipin 2 was stably expressed in mouse fibroblast cells. a confocal microscopy based FRET assay was employed to study co-localization. YFP has the disadvantage of having low quantum yield and poor signal to noise ratio hampering the process of individual CFP intensity measurement. the modified ECFP is known as Cerulean and is proved to be a better FRET donor than the conventional ECFP [111]. CFP and YFP have been used to study the interactions of perilipin 1 (plin1) and perilipin 5 (plin5) with Adipocyte Triglyceride Lipase (ATGL) and its corresponding activator --hydrolase domain-containing 5 (Abhd5) the dye was selected because of its spectral properties which allow differentiation from EGFP and a better cell permeability as compared to Oil red O. results showed localization of GFP-mADRP at the surface of lipid droplets stained with the BODIPY dye. oligonucleotides can be ligated by addition of complementary oligonucleotide and ligase enzyme. this leads to the formation of more than 1000 copies of the complement of 100 bp in one hour using the phi29 polymerase. the availability of a wide range of fluorescent proteins and organelle specific stains provides unprecedented opportunities for microscopic studies of diverse cellular processes including protein-protein interactions. however, for the visualization of certain cell components in live cells such as lipid droplets options are currently limited to organic dyes, i.e. BODIPY, Nile red and oil red O. this publication was covered by the DFG sponsorship \"open access publication\""}
