{"summary": "CDC developed real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) assays for detection of MERS-CoV (10) a total of 47 states and the district of Columbia had MERS-CoV testing capability. the assay kit is intended for detection of MERS-CoV RNA in respiratory, serum, and stool samples. a total of 490 PUIs were reported to CDC from 45 states and the district of Columbia. a total of 381 (78%) reported traveling from the Arabian Peninsula to the united states within 14 days before illness onset. the most common contacts were with persons from Saudi Arabia (55/113 [49%]), United Arab Emirates (10/113 [9%]) and Qatar (9/113 [8%] algia 140 (32.1) sore throat 134 (27.4) Headache 106 (24.3) Diarrhea 58 (13.3) Abdominal pain 34 (7.8) Hospitalized 292 (59.6) Intensive care unit 112 (38.4) Mechanical ventilation 61 (20.9) Clinical finding Pneumonia 236 (48.2) Acute respiratory distress syndrome 48 (9.8) Renal failure 22 (4.5) Died 11 (2.2) Underlying condition Immunosuppression 55 (12 etiologic pathogen not reported for 359 (73%) PUIs; >1 pathogen identified for some PUIs. countries from which 381 PUIs for MERS-CoV infection had traveled within 14 days of symptom onset. the most commonly detected pathogens among the 490 PUIs were influenza A and rhinovirus/enterovirus. for 359 PUIs (73%), other pathogen testing was not performed or detected pathogens were not reported. the preferred method for detecting MERS in PUIs with recent symptom onset is to test lower respiratory, naso-oropharyngeal, and serum specimens by using the rRT-PCR assay. additional MERS cases, including mildly symptomatic cases, are being identified. CDC plans to revise MERS-CoV guidance as needed."}
