{"summary": "the virus has now been identified in 20 other countries of the world. it has led to the infection of 965 individuals with 357 deaths worldwide. studies have indicated bats and camels as the natural reservoirs. 588, 367\u2013606, and 377\u2013588 of MERS-CoV S protein fused with Fc of human IgG. we found that S377-588-Fc induced the highest antibody responses and neutralizing antibodies in immunized animals. we have further compared the effects of several commercially available adjuvants such as Freund's, aluminum, Monophosphoryl lipid A, Montanide ISA51, and MF59. 2 doses of MF59 adjuvant formulated with MF59 adjuvant are sufficient to induce strong antibody responses. as expected, only a background level of IgG antibody response was induced in the adjuvant only group (S377-588-Fc at 0 g) mice receiving adjuvant only (S377-588-Fc at 0 g) failed to induce MERS-CoV S1-specific IgG antibody response. titers of IgG1 (Th2) and IgG2a (Th1) antibodies were induced by 1, 5, and 20 g of S377-588-Fc at 5 and 20 g. however, 5 g of S377-588-Fc appears to elicit stronger IgG2 significant differences were noted in the IgG1 responses between groups immunized with 5 or 20 g, respectively, and 1 g of MERS-CoV RBD (*) the results suggest that 1 g of S377-588-Fc is sufficient to induce high titers of total IgG and IgG1 subtype. MF59 adjuvant, while the sera from the adjuvant control mice showed no neutralizing activity. these data suggest that S377-588-Fc at 1 g is capable of inducing strong IFN--expressing T cells in immunized mice. the adjuvant control group (S377-588-Fc at 0 g) induced a background level of specific T cell responses. the results suggest that 1 g of S377-588-Fc is sufficient to induce potent IFN--expressing T cell responses in immunized mice. 2 doses of S377-588-Fc formulated with MF59 adjuvant are sufficient to induce strong antibody responses. as expected, only a background level of IgG antibody response was induced in the adjuvant only group (S377-588-Fc at 0 g) mice receiving adjuvant only (S377-588-Fc at 0 g) failed to induce MERS-CoV S1-specific IgG antibody response. titers of IgG1 (Th2) and IgG2a (Th1) antibodies were induced by 1, 5, and 20 g of S377-588-Fc. however, 5 g of S377-588-Fc appears to elicit stronger IgG2a antibodies than either 1 or unization were tested for MERS-CoV S1-specific IgG1 and IgG2a subtypes. the titers were expressed as the endpoint dilutions that remained positively detectable. significant differences were noted in the IgG1 responses between the groups immunized with 5 or 20 g, respectively, and 1 g of MERS-CoV RBD (*) va from adjuvant control mice (S377-588-Fc at 0 g) showed no neutralizing activity. these data suggest that S377-588-Fc at 1 g concentration is able to induce sufficient MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in the immunized mice. 77-588-Fc at 1 g was capable of inducing strong IFN--expressing T cells in both CD4+ and CD8+ populations. S377-588-Fc at increased doses (5 or 20 g) failed to elicit strong IL-2-expressing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. oviruses encoding full-length S protein or S1 subunit induced neutralizing antibodies in mice or rabbits. the nanoparticle-conjugated full-length S protein elicited neutralizing antibodies in mice. recombinant protein containing residues 377-588 of MERS-CoV RBD elicited the highest neutralizing antibodies among the 5 RBD fragments tested against MERS-CoV infection. this protein at 1 g induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies against infections of both MERS pseudovirus and live MERS-CoV. this protein at 1 g was able to elicit strong humoral and cellular immune responses in the immunized mice. this protein at 1 g induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies against infections of both MERS pseudovirus and live MERS-CoV. study provides important information for rational design of optimal dosages of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. animal studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals of the national institute of health. ELISA plates were precoated with MERS-CoV S1-His protein overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by addition of serially diluted sera and incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. splenocytes were collected to assess MERS-CoV S1-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies. 293T cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 genome (pNL4-3.luc.RE) and a plasmid encoding MERS-CoV (EMC-2012 strain) S protein. cells were changed into fresh DMEM 8 h later, and pseudovirus-containing supernatants were harvested 72 h post-transfection for single-cycle infection of Huh intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometry analysis were evaluated in immunized mice. mice were stimulated with MERS-CoV S1-His protein for 5 h at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 in presence of GolgiPlugTM containing brefeldin A (1 l/ml; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) the recombinant S377-588-Fc containing residues 377-588 of MERS-CoV spike plus a C-terminal Fc tag was used as the antigen to optimize antigen doses for RBD-based subunit vaccines. the construction, expression and purification of the S377-588-Fc were described previously by fusing the RBD gene with human IgG Fc. splenocytes were collected to detect MERS-CoV S1-specific antibodies. ELISA plates were precoated with MERS-CoV S1-His protein overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by addition of serially diluted sera and incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the pseudovirus was incubated with serially diluted mouse sera at 37\u00b0C for 1 h before adding to the cells preplated in 96-well culture plates. twenty-four hours later, cells were refed with fresh medium, followed by lysing cells 72 h later using cell lysis buffer. the cells were stained with conjugated anti-mouse-CD4 and -CD8 antibodies for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. after washes, the cells were fixed using the Cytofix/CytopermTM Kit (BD Biosciences) and stained with anti-mouse-IL-2 (FITC) and -IFN- (PE) antibodies for 30 min at 4\u00b0C."}
