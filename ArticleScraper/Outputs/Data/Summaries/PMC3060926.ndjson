{"summary": "the 2009 swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV) caused the first global influenza pandemic in recent decades. global concerns have been raised about an increasing threat of an influenza pandemic. current treatment strategies for influenza-A viruses, such as vaccines and drugs, have not provided broad and lasting protection. short defined or random peptides with a narrow length range are used to screen against monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. the peptide library is generated by random digestion of the gene encoding the target viral protein. this is followed by a PCR-based reassembly step that results in fragments with controllable lengths. the full length HA gene of the pandemic 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus was digested and re-assembled by PCR. the fragment library was ligated into the yeast display vector pCTCON-T (derived from the yeast surface display vector pCTCON-2 [23] shown in Fig. 1). the theoretical yield for cells expressing in-frame peptides is 1/3. vectors pCTCON-HA1 and pCTCON-HA2 created by inserting HA1 and HA2 genes between the Nhe I, BamH I sites of pCTCON-2 were used as positive controls in FCM detection. in step 3, the cell library was incubated with antisera, labeled with secondary fluorescent antibody and subjected to FACS in step 4. the coordinates of the whole HA protein are indicated by the bars. the borders of the HA1 and HA2 regions (residue 345) are indicated by dashed lines. the HA polypeptide is cleaved into two subunits linked by a disulfide bond, HA1 and HA2, to form the mature HA trimer. the majority of the HA1 subunit forms the viral membrane-distal globular head responsible for receptor binding, whereas the HA2 subunit together with the N- and C- termini of HA1 forms the membrane-proximal stem region that plays a major role in membrane fusion. 82 (82%) were picked randomly and sequenced, of which 82 contained in-frame inserts. the random library contained only 1/6 (16.7%) in-frame inserts efficiently. 56 positive clones with a RAYS ratio 2 were considered antigenic. a major peak with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) from residues 387\u2013480 is revealed. residue frequency map is then overlaid onto the crystal model of the trimeric HA of the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus. no distinct antigenic region is identified because of limited number of peptides (7) with relatively longer lengths (all >200 aa), which are insufficient to form peak areas. HA monomer surface view is shown on the left and colored to illustrate the five dominant antigenic regions. genic peptides are located in the HA1 region and have shorter lengths (5432 aa), while only 9% are in the HA2 region (9619 aa) representative antigenic clones were subjected to FCM. clones G-15 (residues 38\u2013136 of HA) and G-29 (residues 70\u2013162) in the HA1 region, G-46 (residues 308\u2013 region of the medium peak (residues 303\u2013350) consists of the C- terminal extension of HA1 designated as R4 (indicated by faint red within the stem region), designated as R4 (indicated by faint red within the stem region) the antigenic peptides recognized by the goat antisera are different from those recognized by the mouse antisera. a clone expressing H-1 harbored the Sa antigenic site in RBD of the HA protein. the binding affinities of these displayed peptides were generally weaker than the whole HA1. the residue frequency map also reveals a major peak (FWHM at residues 392\u2013480) cells containing pCTCON2 were used as absorbent controls for evaluation of background IC50 values. HA1 and HA2 were also used to determine the ability of the globular head and stem regions to absorb antibodies in the antisera. the peptides were expressed as C- terminal fusions to the thioredoxin (Trx) tag. the y-axis shows the absorbance at 450 nm after development with the substrate 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) pCTCON-T was derived from pCTCON-2 [23] by inserting an assistant sequence with two Xcm I sites at both ends between Nhe I and BamH I sites. the random peptide library was expressed under the control of the galactose inducible GAL 1/10 promoter. the cells harboring antibody-binding peptides were distinguished from those with non-binding peptides. in step 5, we isolated plasmids directly from the pool of yeast cells containing positive peptide sequences. this reduced laborious plasmid extraction from individual yeast clones. the designation of clones follows the same order indicated in Fig. 2. the corresponding HA residues for each clone are illustrated. the majority of the HA1 subunit forms the viral membrane-distal globular head responsible for receptor binding. the HA2 subunit together with the N- and C- termini of HA1 forms the membrane-proximal stem region that plays a major role in membrane fusion. so two plasmids were constructed to display the HA1 subunit of 328 aa (residues 17\u2013344 of the HA protein) and the HA2 the ratio of recombinant antigen expressed on the yeast surface (RAYS) was determined by dividing mean fluorescence intensity of peptide expressing yeast cells by the mean fluorescent intensity of the non-expressing yeast cells. 56 positive clones with a RAYS ratio 2 were considered antigenic and analyzed at both the sequence and structural level. a major peak with the full width at half maximum (FWHM) from residues 387\u2013480 is revealed (Fig. 4, panel A). residue frequency map is then overlaid onto the crystal model of the trimeric HA of the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus (PDB ID: 3LZG) the HA monomer surface view is shown on the left and colored to illustrate the five dominant antigenic regions. the HA monomer is shown on the right and follows the same coloring scheme, with the third monomer shown in the back and colored in grey. clones G-15 (residues 38\u2013136 of HA) and G-29 (residues 70\u2013162) in the HA1 region, G-46 (residues 308\u2013339) near the HA1-HA2 cross region, and G-55 (residues 413\u2013479) in the HA2 region, all shorter than 100 aa, demonstrated strong antigenicity (RAYS ratio >5) the antigenic peptides recognized by the goat antisera are different from those recognized by the mouse antisera. 74 peptides were found to be in-frame, and 51 were confirmed to be antigenic (RAYS ratio 2). it is interesting to see that the distribution of theses peptides is similar to that obtained using the mouse antisera. residue frequency map also reveals a major peak (FWHM at residues 392\u2013480) this peak position is similar to that obtained using the mouse antisera (FWHM at residues 387\u2013480) this peak position is similar to that obtained using the mouse antisera (FWHM at residues 387\u2013480) all single clones reduced the IC50 of the corresponding antisera. binding affinities of these peptides to the mouse, goat and human antisera were characterized by the method of ELISA, with thioredoxin as the control. the coordinate of the HA protein is indicated by the grey bar. the peptides were expressed as C- terminal fusions to the thioredoxin (Trx) tag. the peptides were expressed as C- terminal fusions to the thioredoxin (Trx) tag. antibodies to the 2009 A(H1N1) viral protein HA appear to vary significantly depending on the species. the goat response is strikingly different from those of mouse and human. the antigenic peptides obtained from the screening against the mouse or human antisera are predominantly located in the HA2 region. the monoclonal antibodies used in these previous studies were obtained from murine hybridoma cells by radioimmunoassay (RIA) or hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays favored isolation of antibodies that bound predominantly to the globular head of the virus and inhibited binding of the virus to the host cells. however, complex antisera were used, which should contain antibodies recognizing other regions of the HA protein. the critical sites in helix A fall within the R2 region identified in this study. the hydrophobic interaction sites in the adjacent HA1 region fall into regions R3 and R4 of this study. vaccination in mice using a HA2-based synthetic peptide mimicking the 12D1 epitope was shown to provide protection against influenza viruses of H3N2, H5N1 and H1N1 subtypes. our approach presents two advantages: first, technically we adopt an easy-to-implement scheme for generating a controllable size of peptides. our screening typically involves only one round of FACS-based sorting. but the latter results in many repeat sequences, we argue that much information is lost in the enrichment process. a mixture of 9 samples with the highest activity among 110 samples as judged by ELISA. the protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Shenzhen East Lake Hospital. all viral strains are closely related.
