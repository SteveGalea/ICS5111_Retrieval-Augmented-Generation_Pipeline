{"summary": "the first recognized outbreak of HPS occurred in the spring of 1993 (CDC 1993, Nichol et al. 1993), killing 11 people during an 8-week period in May and June. death often occurred just hours after the onset of pulmonary edema (CDC 1993). parmenter and colleagues (1993) and Yates and colleages (2002) proposed a bottom-up precipitation-driven trophic cascade to explain the HPS outbreaks. the proposed cascade involved increased primary and secondary productivity (measures of deer mouse resources) during spring\u2013summer, followed by increased deer mouse abundance, infection prevalence, and ultimately, HPS cases. Intensive studies are mostly limited to the Southwest and Montana. the prevalence of SNV appears greatest among deer mice in Montana. longitudinal data from several sites remains unpublished. infection with SNV may influence weight gain (Douglass et al. 2007) and survival (luis et al. 2012), but see previtali and colleagues (2010). this may be a delayed response to increased population density the previous autumn. long-tailed survivorship decreases the average age of infection. age-dependent contact rates appeared more important for increasing prevalence than susceptibility or amplitude of population oscillations. negative relationships of SNV prevalence with spatial and temporal have also been demonstrated. human exposure results from activities that aerosolize infected deer mouse excreta. peridomestic studies are restricted to Montana, which has a semiarid climate. deer mice in peridomestic environments frequently enter man made structures. peridomestic deer mice can spend the majority (65%) of their time within man made structures. deer mouse excreta likely accumulate and SNV survives longer in peridomestic settings. persistence of infectious SNV is likely longer and the risk of exposure for humans greater in peridomestic locations. deer mice often enter peridomestic structures, but frequent movement into and out of buildings is unlikely to result in significant accumulation of deer mouse excreta. studies suggest that the arid and semiarid environments of the southwestern United States are normally \u201cmarginal\u201d for deer mouse survival. the subsequent transition of temporarily suitable environmental conditions for deer mice back to a normal arid/semiarid state may further promote the prolonged occupancy of structures in peridomestic environments by deer mice. we predict that these patterns of expansion and local die-off/die-back or increased occupancy of peridomestic structures would be observed to a lesser extent. there has been no extensive exploration of climate, deer mice, and SNV across the contiguous united states to examine broader determinants of human exposure risk. there are good surveillance data on HPS cases in the united states, and previous investigators have adjusted the cumulative case data against total and rural census data. we used linear models, which were ranked using information-theoretic approaches and multimodel selection, and calculated variable importance weights. results indicated that these relationships were strongest during spring\u2013summer months (when HPS cases predominate) and weakest during fall\u2013winter months (results are not presented) this result was based on all available deer mouse abundance and SNV prevalence studies. deer mouse abundance (F(11,1) = 0.32, p =.58, regression coefficient = \u201315.16, standard error (SE) = 26.81) and (b) Sin Nombre virus (SNV) infection prevalence among US states (F(10,1) = 0.07, p =.79, regression coefficient = \u20134.56, SE = 16.75) the relationship of per-capita cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) among US states with (a) mean daily precipitation and (b) mean daily temperature. supplemental appendix S1 for data and citations and table 3 for models. ated Place in northwestern new Mexico has been a focus of HPS research in the united states. it is the only site with published temporal data on \u201cnatural\u201d deer mice abundance and SNV at a local geographic scale, matched with an analyzable number of HPS cases. cross-correlation analysis was valuable because it enabled us to identify and evaluate time-lagged relationships among covariates and optimal time lags in such relationships. correlation analyses evaluating time-lagged relationships in Zuni, new Mexico. deer mouse abundance best predicted by precipitation and, to a lesser extent, by the temperature 9 months earlier. climatic factors, deer mouse abundance, and number of infected deer mice as predictors of the number of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases. the predictors within these hypotheses were modeled as direct and indirect to represent the differential effects of environmental variables. in hypotheses H2\u2013H6, we considered the effects of deer mouse infection as a driver of human cases. effect of number of infected deer mice (natural and presumably peridomestic) is indirectly determined by deer mouse abundance twelve months prior HPS = 1IPm + 1.

IPm denotes the estimated number of infected deer mice by deer mouse abundance 12 months prior. hypotheses containing indirect effects of climatic variables on deer mouse abundance include the term. the hypotheses were fit to the full data set and also to data restricted to spring\u2013summer. cross-correlation analyses demonstrate that deer mouse abundance is best predicted by temperature and precipitation approximately 9 months earlier. cases of HPS, however, tended to increase 3 months after deer mouse abundance increased. three hypotheses were supported as most parsimonious (a AIC of less than 4; Burnham and Anderson 2002), with the top model explaining 43% of the observed variation in HPS case numbers. the top model suggests that natural deer mouse abundance 3 months earlier predicts spring\u2013summer human exposure to SNV.

IPm denotes the estimated number of infected deer mice by deer mouse abundance 12 months prior. cross-correlation analyses demonstrate that deer mouse abundance is best predicted by temperature and precipitation approximately 9 months earlier. cases of HPS, however, tended to increase 3 months after deer mouse abundance increased (figure 4d), not immediately following increases in SNV activity among deer mice. the top model suggests that natural deer mouse abundance predicts spring\u2013summer human exposure to SNV (hypothesis H7). the following two most parsimonious hypotheses included deer mouse abundance and added the direct effects (environmental effects modeled to represent their influence on particle aerosolization) of temperature and precipitation, respectively. 38 6.490 0.024.454 H12 4 123.426 132.855 3.123 0.052.305 H12 4 62.249 73.885 6.737 0.021.431 H10 4 123.647 133.076 3.344 0.047.297 H2 2 69.658 74.581 7.433 0.015.126 H2 2 128.935 133.335 3.603 0.041.117 H1 1 74.124 76.409 9.261 0.006.000 H3 136 0.003.296 H6 6 69.612 90.945 23.797 0.000.130 H5 8 125.088 147.088 17.357 0.000.223 H5 8 67.774 104.345 37.197 0.000.218. three similar models selected as the most parsimonious. prolonged peridomestic occupancy by deer mice and associated SNV transmission may primarily be a functional response to natural deer mouse abundance 3 months prior. we propose that in arid and potentially semiarid regions, environmental conditions led to the local amplification and dispersal of deer mice to these normally suboptimal areas. peridomestic structures in arid environments are cooler and more humid than the natural environment. no published study has made temporally paired comparisons of deer mouse abundance between natural and peridomestic habitats. a proposed set of mechanisms linking climate, resources, North American deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) transmission among deer mice, and human exposure in the southwestern united states. deer mice are borne (b) and die (d) in both natural and peridomestic environments. deer mice become infected (IPm) at rate (Sy Pm) in natural environments and at rate (Pd h) in peridomestic environments. deer mice may be more inclined to enter peridomestic structures. possible threshold relationship at 1.5 millimeters of average daily precipitation. deer mouse abundance best predicted by temperature and precipitation 9 months earlier. the classification of these processes will help determine the force of infection for humans. this can be characterized as the inhalation of aerosolized excreta (contact rates between humans and deer mice) and the probability of becoming infected given inhalation of infectious particles (the transmission probability of SNV to humans; figure 7). the eight states in the united states with the highest cumulative rural HPS incidence include increased frequency and length of heatwaves, increased \u00adfrequency and duration of precipitation events, and, importantly, increased frequency of extreme precipitation events. the importance of a deepened understanding of the drivers of zoonotic disease risk is not limited to SNV and extends to other epidemiologically important hantaviruses. reservoir\u2013human interactions for most epidemiologically important hantaviruses are less broadly understood than those for SNV. this is exemplified by Puumala virus, for which evidence is similarly supportive of the climatic drivers of peridomestic occupancy by reservoir hosts being important for reservoir\u2014human interactions. org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/biosci/biv047/-/DC1."}
