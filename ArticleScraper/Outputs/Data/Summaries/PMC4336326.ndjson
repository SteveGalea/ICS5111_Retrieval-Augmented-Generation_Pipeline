{"summary": "new taxonomy divides the Coronavirinae subfamily into four genera. only the alpha and beta species infect humans [1]. HCoV-NL63 is the major etiological factor of croup in young children. the HCoV-NL63 protein encodes the viral replicative machinery within the 5\u2019 part and the structural proteins within the 3\u2019 part. the protein forms a ribonucleoprotein together with genomic RNA. it is then inserted into a lipid envelope carrying other structural proteins responsible for membrane curvature formation, vesicle scission, and interaction with cellular receptors. NL63-N shares characteristics with homologous proteins encoded by other coronaviruses. it forms oligomers via its C-terminal domain (CTD) and binds nucleic acids via its N-terminal domain (NTD) fetal bovine serum (FBS; PAA Laboratories, Austria), penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 g/ml) cells were cultured on T75 flasks (TPP, Switzerland) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. at 24 h post-transfection, the cells were washed with sterile 1 PBS. a with pronase E were expanded on collagen-coated plastic in bronchial epithelial growth media (BEGM) to generate passage 1 cells. cells were plated at density of 3105 cells per well on permeable Transwell supports (6.5-mm-diameter; Corning Transwell-Clear) in BEGM. cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in presence of 5% CO2 until confluence. pmaxFP-Green-N/NL63-N was cloned into the pmaxFP-Green-N plasmid. the fragments were synthesized by a third party (Genomed, Poland) procNL63-N, procNL63-20/144-N (for expression of the N terminal\u2014domain) and procNL63-221/340-N (5\u2019- CAT AGG ATC CAG AAA ACC TGT ATT TTC AGG AGC GAT CCT CAA ACT CAA C-3\u2019) plasmids were cloned into the pET Duet 1 plasmid (Clonetech, USA) maxFP-Green-N/NL63-N encoding RNA was prepared based on the original plasmid. the plasmid was used as a template with primers SP6_NEGFPmRNA (5\u2019- ACT GAC TGA TTT AGG TGA CAC TAT AGA AGN GAA GCT TGC CAC CAT GGC TG -3\u2019) Primers SP6_NmRNA (5\u2019- TCG GCC TCG TAG ATT TAG GTG ACA CTA TAG AAG NCT GAG AGA ACC CAC TTG AC -3\u2019) were used, where the 5\u2019 primer carries the SP6 promoter. cells were incubated in staining solution (50 g/ml propidium iodide and 10 g/ml RNase A in sterile 1 PBS; Sigma\u2013A cells were incubated in blocking buffer (10% of BSA; BioShop, Canada, 0.1% Tween 20; BioShop, Canada in 1 PBS) for 60 minutes. fluorescent images were acquired with leica TCS SP5 II confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Germany) PDB ID Uniprot ID Source polyprotein Description Reference 2bxx P69596 Avian IBV (strain Beaudette) Nucleocapsid NTD [50] 2c86 P69598 Avian IBV (strain Beaudette US) Nucleocapsid NTD [56] 2gec P32923 Avian IBV (strain Grey) Nucleocapsid NTD [56] 2ge7 P32923 Avian IBV ( cells were pelleted by centrifugation and suspended in lysis buffer. the buffer was supplemented with 5 mM -mercaptoethanol. cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. proteins of interest were recovered by affinity chromatography. differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) experiments were performed on a Calorimetry Sciences Corporation 6100 nano II differential scanning calorimeter with a cell volume of 0.3228 ml. heat capacity of 1 mg/ml protein solution in 50 mM NH4HCO3, pH 7.8 was recorded relative to pure buffer at a scan rate of 1 K/min. electrophoretic separation was carried out at 75 V (stacking) / 135 V (separation) protein visualized using Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. 10 g of RNA or DNA corresponding in sequence to the N-NL63 gene. cells were cultured on T75 flasks (TPP, Switzerland) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. 293T cells (ATCC CRL-3216) were transfected with the pLKO.1.-TRC-ACE2 plasmid. tracheobronchial epithelial cells were obtained from airway specimens resected from patients undergoing surgery. cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in presence of 5% CO2 until confluence. all cell cultures were routinely screened for mycoplasma spp. contamination. infected cells were lysed 6 days post-infection by two freeze-thaw cycles. the virus-containing fluid was cleared by centrifugation, aliquoted and stored at -80\u00b0C.

NL63-N fragment encompassing its CTD was chosen exclusively on the basis of sequence alignment and structural analysis. fragment 221\u2013340 contains full, structurally stable CTD. the sequences and structures of N proteins used in above analysis are listed in S1 File. NL63-N underwent irreversible denaturation and showed a broad transition curve. the denaturation temperature was estimated at 45.7\u00b0C, with an enthalpy change of approximately 80 kcal/mol. however, due to low signal to noise ratio the baseline was variable. the coronaviral nucleocapsid forms a protective scaffold around the viral RNA [52\u201354] the N protein forms oligomers via specific interactions between different regions within the protein. similar results were obtained for the CTD but not NTD, suggesting that CTD harbors the sites responsible for N protein dimerization. NTD complexes were stabilized by means of protein crosslinking and analyzed with SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (Coomassie brilliant blue staining) the CTD was analyzed with size exclusion chromatography; two peaks visible on the chromatogram (a and b) represent dimeric and monomeric forms of the CTD respectively. subcellular localization of the N protein Coronaviral N proteins localize to the cytoplasm, where they are involved in virus replication and assembly. however, the N proteins of almost all coronaviruses localize to the nucleus or to micronuclei [58\u201361] plasm may be attributed to vast overexpression of the protein. similar patterns were previously seen for other coronaviruses. fected LLC-MK2 and 293T cells with RNA encoding NL63-N. analysis was performed using LLC-MK2 cells (A.) and 293T cells (B.). no significant difference in cell cycle progression in NL63-N-expressing and non-expressing cells. NL63-N fragment encompassing its CTD was chosen exclusively on the basis of sequence alignment and structural analysis. fragment 221\u2013340 contains full, structurally stable CTD. the sequences and structures of N proteins used in above analysis are listed in S1 File.

TD H kcal/mol 81.05 143.6 104.4 Tt (\u00b0C) 45.7 55.7 45.0 S kcal/K*mol - 0.44 - Oligomerization of the N protein is mediated by the CTD The coronaviral nucleocapsid forms a protective scaffold around the viral RNA. similar results were obtained for the CTD but not NTD. analyzed with SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (Coomassie brilliant blue staining) the CTD was analyzed with size exclusion chromatography. two peaks visible on the chromatogram represent dimeric and monomeric forms of the CTD respectively. micrographs were prepared using scanning electron microscope JSM-5410. subcellular localization of the N protein Coronaviral N proteins localize to the cytoplasm. however, the N proteins of almost all coronaviruses localize to the nucleus or to micronuclei. cells infected with HCoV-NL63 did not result in formation of such structures. similar patterns were previously seen for other coronaviruses. NL63-N is a basic protein comprising of 377 aa. only cells expressing NL63-N were used for subsequent analyses. no significant difference in cell cycle progression in NL63-N-expressing cells. in general, H represents the energy amount of non-covalent bonds occurring within native protein. this is consistent with our finding that the N protein rapidly degrades in aqueous solutions. Obtained results are consistent with previous reports [55,66,67]. however, the CTD was surprisingly stable. the existence of the exotherm on the downhill part of endotherm DSC peak is the obvious evidence for the presence of association-aggregation processes. lower stability of NTD and the complete N protein could be attributed to the distinct structural flexibility of these proteins. in turn, higher flexibility allows NTD to bind nucleic acids which has obvious biological relevance for NTD and complete N protein function. oligomerization of the 229E-N protein is most likely also mediated by the CTD. NL63-N strongly binds nucleic acids during formation of the ribonucleocapsid. this interaction may be important for stabilizing and shaping the ribonucleocapsid. we tested a fully differentiated human airway epithelium cultures. the NL63-N protein does not localize to the nucleus. it is possible that the lack of nuclear staining may be due to poor antibody staining. polypeptide sequence encompassing the N-terminal domain of N protein from HCoV-NL63 was based on the sequence alignment with homologous N proteins together with the structural comparative analysis. the sequence of HCoV-NL63 N protein predicted to constitute the structurally stable N-terminal domain is colored blue. sequences of N proteins were aligned: Q6Q1R8, HCoV NL63; P69596, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, strain Beaudette), sequence referring to the 2ca1 crystal structure; P32923, IBV (strain Gray), sequence referring to the 2ge7 crystal structure; P59595, human SARS coronavirus. sequence of HCoV-NL63 N protein predicted to constitute the structurally stable C- analysis was carried on with confocal microscopy using leica TCS SP5 II confocal microscope.
