{"summary": "the effectiveness of the current tri- or quadrivalent influenza vaccine is limited to approximately 60% in adults and only 40% in the elderly. no active vaccination is currently available to protect against RSV infection. an estimated $300,000 cost to prevent a single RSV hospitalization is prohibitive to broad application. therapeutic targeting of host factors recruited for virus replication has attracted renewed interest in the past decade due to the combined promise of expanding the antiviral indication range. the approach has yet to deliver approved therapeutics with safety profiles acceptable for human use against viral diseases such as seasonal influenza and RSV disease (19). ribonucleoside analog ALS-8176 was found to be efficacious in a human RSV challenge study (28), providing an important proof of concept for the treatment of influenza-like diseases with competitive polymerase inhibitors. but ALS-8176 did not inhibit influenza virus (29) we have established and validated a replication-competent dual RSV and influenza A virus reporter virus-based high-throughput screening (HTS) assay. the ribonucleoside analog NHC blocks negative-strand RNA viruses associated with influenza-like diseases. ea pig IAV transmission model assembled an in-house library of 102 ribonucleoside analog candidates. this campaign yielded three hit candidates that consistently blocked both viral targets in the primary assay. titration was performed by a plaque assay. Efficacy of NHC against IBVs representing both currently circulating lineages on MDCK cells. a subset of avian influenza viruses was tested in ovo (Table 1). the antiviral activity of NHC against both RSV and influenza virus was unchanged in these disease-relevant human primary cells compared to immortalized cell lines. ifornia/7/2009 (H1N1) pdm09 TCID50-HA assay, MDCK cells 3.1 (1.49\u20136.23) 98 Human pdm09 A/Georgia/M5081/2012 (H1N1) TCID50-HA assay, MDCK cells 3.4 (2.92\u20133.9) 171 Human pdm09 A/duck/Alberta/35/76 (H1N1) HA the potency of NHC against different IAVs, IBVs, and RSVs was determined in cultured cells or embryonated chicken eggs. EC50s were determined through four-parameter variable-slope regression modeling. -triphosphate form of the compound, NHC-TP, was previously observed for positive-strand RNA virus replicons. the inhibition of RSV and influenza virus by NHC can be reversed by the addition of exogenous pyrimidines but not purines. we used a biochemical assay of RSV polymerase activity that uses purified viral phosphoprotein (P) and large protein (L) RSV polymerase components. MDCK cells were infected with IAV-WSN-nanoLuc and treated with 10 M NHC, 50 M T-705 (positive-control influenza virus RdRp inhibitor) or 10 M GRP-71271 (positive-control IAV-WSN entry inhibitor) at different times relative to infection. reporter activity is expressed relative to values for vehicle-treated control infections. in vitro polymerase assays were carried out in the presence of a range of NHC-TP concentrations or aphidicolin for reference. values were normalized to the values for vehicle-treated controls and show means of data from three biological repeats SD.

Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc test. source animals were infected i.n. with 104 PFU of IAV-NL/09. virus loads in nasal lavage fluids were determined on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 postinfection. analysis was done with two-way ANOVA and Dunnett's post hoc test. in the oseltamivir group were not significantly different from those in vehicle-treated animals. treatment with NHC caused a significant and sustained reduction in the virus load. the time window provided by the mouse model to assess the efficacy of NHC is narrow. treatment was initiated prophylactically at the 400-mg/kg dose level. both lung and central nervous system (CNS) viral loads were determined at day 6 postinfection. virus was undetectable in the CNS in four out of five animals that had received NHC. transmitted virus was first detected at day 4 postinfection. low-dose NHC treatment of source guinea pigs delayed transmission by approximately 1 day. titers peaked at approximately 106 PFU/ml of nasal wash fluid on day 6. N1 and emerging H7N9 avian IAVs (AIVs), and IBVs representing both circulating lineages (35), Victoria and Yamagata (Fig. 1F) a subset of avian influenza viruses was tested in ovo (Table 1). the antiviral activity of NHC against both RSV and influenza virus was unchanged in these disease-relevant human primary cells compared to immortalized cell lines. 50-HA assay, MDCK cells 1.1 (0.86\u20131.22) 275 Human A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) pdm09 TCID50-HA assay, MDCK cells 3.1 (1.49\u20136.23) 98 Human pdm09 A/Georgia/M5081/2012 (H1N1) TCID50-HA assay, MDCK cells 3.4 (2.92\u20133.9) 171 Human pd the potency of NHC against different IAVs, IBVs, and RSVs was determined in cultured cells or embryonated chicken eggs.

MDCK cells were infected with IAV-WSN-nanoLuc and treated with 10 M NHC, 50 M T-705 (positive-control influenza virus RdRp inhibitor) (57), or 10 M GRP-71271 (positive-control IAV-WSN entry inhibitor) at different times relative to infection. reporter activity is expressed relative to values for vehicle-treated control infections. in vitro polymerase assays were carried out in the presence of a range of NHC-TP concentrations or aphidicolin for reference. Symbols represent mean values SD of data from 3 biological repeats each. at least 7,737 nucleotides were determined per virus and exposure condition.

Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc test. source animals were infected i.n. with 104 PFU of IAV-NL/09. virus loads in nasal lavage fluids were determined on days 1, 3, 5 and 7 postinfection. treatment was initiated prophylactically at 2 h preinfection and continued b.i.d. to end of day 3 postinfection. eltamivir delayed viral replication in the first 2 days after infection. but peak lung titers in the oseltamivir group were not significantly different from those in vehicle-treated animals. treatment with NHC caused a significant and sustained reduction in virus load. mice were infected i.n. with 6 PFU of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1). treatment was initiated prophylactically at the 400-mg/kg dose level. both lung and central nervous system viral loads were determined at day 6 postinfection in comparison with vehicle- and SOC-treated animals. transmitted virus was first detected at day 4 postinfection. low-dose NHC treatment of source guinea pigs delayed transmission by 1 day. titers peaked at approximately 106 PFU/ml of nasal wash fluid. the broad indication spectrum of NHC is reminiscent of those described for T-705 (favipiravir) and ribavirin. the compounds act after phosphoribosylation (T-705) and phosphorylation as purine analogs. they are believed to interfere with RNA virus replication through pairing with either cytidine or uridine (49, 50) recognition of NHC-TP by RSV and IAV polymerases is comparable to that of CTP. at least equimolar concentrations of exogenous cytidine were required to reverse NHC-mediated inhibition despite the micromolar levels of endogenous ribonucleosides naturally present in the cells. mutagenesis studies have shown that viral tolerance for an increased mutation frequency is limited (50, 54\u201356) the anticipated treatment time for influenza and RSV disease is short. the recommended course of oseltamivir is 5 to 7 days (14) and prolonged exposure to NHC was well tolerated by both mice and guinea pigs. the lung viral burden represents the most relevant readout to assess treatment efficacy in these models. the observed significant lung virus load reductions were consistent with efficient NHC uptake and anabolism in primary cells, the antiviral activity of the compound in native cell cultures and in ovo. the reduced IAV transmission success under NHC generates high promise that human therapy with NHC may accelerate the silencing of virus outbreaks. the compound was highly bioavailable, efficiently converted to the active NHC-TP form in disease-relevant respiratory tissues. normal human bronchial tracheal epithelial cells (HBTECs) were grown in bronchiaLife cell technology. immortalized cell lines used in this study are routinely checked for microbial contamination. influenza viruses A/duck/Alberta/35/76 (H1N1), A/swine/Spain/53207/2004, and A/chicken/Potsdam/178-4/83 (H2N2) were propagated all experiments using live, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses were reviewed and approved by the institutional biosafety program at the university of Georgia. virions were titrated by standard plaque assays, hemagglutination assays (80), 50% tissue culture infective dose assays, or TCID50-hemagglutination (TCID50-HA) assays in MDCK cells.
