{"summary": "the Seeplex Meningitis ACE Detection kit is a newly developed multiplex PCR kit for diagnosing acute meningitis. the kit uses reference strains for each pathogen targeted by the kit. the kit may be useful for rapid identification of important acute meningitis-causing pathogens. alternative methods of molecular identification, including 16S/23S rRNA gene amplification followed by sequencing and real-time PCR, have been developed. however, the clinical application of such techniques is limited because of the presence of interfering bacterial or viral DNA. these limitations can be overcome by the use of multiplex PCR methods, which enable the rapid and accurate identification of up to 9 bacterial and viral pathogens in clinical samples. Seeplex Meningitis-B and V1 assays amplify DNA, whereas the Seeplex Meningitis-V2 assay amplifies cDNA reverse-transcribed from viral RNA. target genes used in the Seeplex Meningitis ACE Detection kit Abbreviations. the cloned plasmids were harvested, DNA concentrations were measured, and the numbers of target copies were calculated. sensitivity was defined as the lowest template copy number for which amplified products were consistently detected in triplicate samples. 196 clinical CSF samples were collected from 78 patients (27 women, 51 men) diagnosed with acute meningitis. the median patient age was 27 yr (range, 1 month to 72 yr) for the verification study, we tested only the 78 samples collected at the time of diagnosis. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using RevertAidTM First Strand cDNA Synthesis kits (Fermentas, Ontario, Canada) and used for Meningitis-V2 testing. RNA was also extracted from each CSF supernatant. target genes amplified from the 12 strains are shown in Table 1. multiplex PCR conditions Each amplification was performed using 5 L of isolated nucleic acid solution, 2 L of 10primer mixture, and 10 L of 2Multiplex Master Mix. the amplified PCR products were electrophoresed in 2% (w/v) agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. reference strains used for the 5 bacteria and 7 viruses were as follows: SP ATCC BAA-255D, HI ATCC BAA-1416, NM ATCC 700532D, GBS ATCC BAA-611D, LM ATCC 19114D-5, CMV ATCC VR-807, EBV Korean isolate, HSV-1 ATCC VR-260, HSV-2 ATCC VR-734, VZV Korean isolate, and HEV ATCC VR-836/VR-784. median patient age was 27 yr (range, 1 month to 72 yr) for the verification study, we tested only the 78 samples collected at the time of diagnosis, i.e., before antibiotic therapy was initiated. 118 samples were used to assess discrepancies in positive results. 196 clinical CSF samples were collected from 78 patients (27 women, 51 men) diagnosed with acute meningitis. the median patient age was 27 yr (range, 1 month to 72 yr) ous encephalitis, 2, mumps; and 1 each, Cryptococcus neoformans infection, clinically suspected meningitis due to Candida, and rickettsia. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription using RevertAidTM First Strand cDNA Synthesis kits. HSV-1, and LM were 10, 11, 11, 12, 12, 13, 16, 19, 38, and 51 genomes/mL. no cross-reaction was evident with human genomic DNA and other reference strains. the Seeplex Meningitis-V2 ACE Detection kit successfully differentiated all the 19 HEV species from the other strains. single viral infections were evident in 16 patients with HEV, 9 with VZV, 3 with HSV-1, and 1 each with HSV-2 and EBV. single viral infections were evident in 16 patients with HEV, 9 with VZV, 3 with HSV-1, and 1 each with HSV-2. conventional diagnostic tools, including culture, and antigen analysis, have limited diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. the Seeplex Meningitis ACE detection kit, which employs a DPO method, can identify the 12 most common bacterial and viral agents that cause meningitis. only 6 of the 44 pathogens identified using the Seeplex Meningitis ACE Detection kit were identified by other laboratory methods. the pathogen was HEV in 4 cases and HSV-1 and LM in the remaining 2 cases. the Seeplex Meningitis ACE Detection kit showed high sensitivity and specificity for the 12 most common bacterial and viral agents causing acute meningitis."}
