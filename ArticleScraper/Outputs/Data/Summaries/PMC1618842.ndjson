{"summary": "centralized collection of potentially identifiable, individual, identifiable personal health information (PHI) records are essential for conditions for which there is mandated reporting, such as tuberculosis or sexually transmitted diseases. alternative methods that do not rely on centralized identifiable PHI databases are increasingly desirable. many syndromic surveillance systems gather potentially identifiable, individual patient-level encounter records. these records are typically collected without name or address, but they do contain enough identifiers to allow re-identification in some circumstances. the risk of disclosing sensitive information that can be linked to the individual also increases when the health care facility provides more than occasional care. in the united states, there is a potential problem with statistical inference if multiple records from the same individual are not distinguished. the problem arises because many statistical analysis techniques depend on the assumption that observations are statistically independent. in more than half of individuals with multiple lower respiratory syndrome encounters over a four year period from one large ambulatory care practice. centralized aggregation and processing of PHI for surveillance is a common risk with centralized systems. only aggregate data are transferred to the central datacenter for statistical processing, signal detection, display and distribution. the risk of inadvertent disclosure becomes very small, and may prove acceptable to data custodians and individual patients. a distributed system moves some of the initial data processing to the site where the data is being collected. this aggregation minimizes the number of individuals who have access to PHI. the focus of this report is on the model used to collect surveillance data while providing maximum protection for PHI. data is transferred to the datacenter (synthetic data) syndrome Encounter date Organization Zip code Town Date of receipt Count GI:lower 2/1/2006 KPNC 94565 Pittsburg CA 2/2/2006 7 GI:lower 2/1/2006 KPNC 95209 Stockton CA 2/2/2006 3 GI:lower 2/1/2006 KPNC 95632 Galt CA 2/2/2006 2 GI:lower 2/1/2006 KPNC 94112 San all syndromes except influenza-like illness and SARS-like illness were defined by a working group led by a working group led by CDC and the department of defense. the definitions (ICD9 code lists) of 11 of these syndromes are available. the distributed software requires the data providers to extract information about encounters of interest (daily, in our case) and convert it into the uniform format used by our distributed software. this kind of uniform representation is required for any multi-source surveillance system and is not peculiar to the distributed model we have adopted. data transmission is one of the least problematic aspects of maintaining this system. we provide automatic installation software and it runs more or less instantaneously and transparently, without intervention in our experience. no training is needed as the process is fully automated. two versions are available, one with and one without the most specific identifying details. current capacity of the NDP to respond to public health needs When unexpectedly high counts of particular syndromes are detected in geographically defined areas, the datacenter automatically generates electronic alerts. the original, full line lists are created in two forms. the fully identified version contains all elements deemed of possible utility to the responder. the \"narrow\" version provides each patient's five-year age group instead of date of birth. 14/06/1999 E126 2623357 Diplopia None 51 Fever 2/17/2006 Last Visit 01/31/2006 1 to 4 F North Reading 01864 Visit 98.9 6/1/2003 11646 70462348 Viral Infections Unspecified;Unspecified Viral Infection CSF 52 Fever 2/17/2006 New!! 60 to 64 M Arlington 02476 Visit 97.4 14/01/1942 P036 70394015 Viral Infections Unspecified 63 P326 392719 Mononucleosis, Infectious None Note: This report is kept by the health-care organization. some or all records can be shared with the health department when a cluster requires follow-up of individual cases.

ICD9 codes are used to aggregate encounters into one of these 13 syndromes. the definitions of 11 of these syndromes are available [7]. we define a new episode to begin at the first encounter after at least a 42-day encounter-free interval for that specific patient and that specific syndrome. if there has been any encounter for that specific syndrome within the previous 42 days, the current encounter is regarded as part of the usual ongoing care for that individual patient. PHINMS is a freely available, secure, data transfer software suite developed by the CDC. a PHINMS server operates at the datacenter and each data provider operates a PHINMS client. PHINMS is reasonably robust to temporary connectivity problems. the datacenter is a language with extensive support for standards such as XML. it is also a language with extensive support for standards such as XML. it is also a language with extensive support for standards such as XML. electronic messages are automatically sent to the Massachusetts Alert Network within minutes of detection. they are automatically and immediately forwarded to the appropriate public health personnel. the alerting system is independent of our distributed system, but in practice, the ready availability of reports in electronic format. the clinician finds the medical record number by looking up the date and index number in the wide line list. the clinician finds the medical record number by looking up the date and index number in the wide line list and then accesses the record itself. no 378 Neurological 2/17/2006 Last Visit 02/10/2006 40 to 44 M Wilmington 01887 Tel. call 0 1/8/1961 18503 70458803 Convulsions, Other None 379 Neurological 2/17/2006 New!! 55 to 59 M Lowell 01854 Visit 0 29/05/1947 F609 1635454 Headache None 411 Rash 2/17/2006 New!! 50 to 54 M Weymouth 02188 Tel. call 0 15/11/19 Infections Unspecified; Unspecified Viral Infection Other cultures 52 Fever 2/17/2006 New!! 60 to 64 M Arlington 02476 Visit 97.4 Viral Infections Unspecified; Unspecified Viral Infection None 107 GI:lower 2/17/2006 New!! 1 to 4 M Ayer 01432 Tel. call 0 Abdominal Pain, unspecif.; Shortness of Breath None 108 GI:lower 2/17/2006 participating health plans prefer to have an on-site clinical responder participate in the initial case evaluation with the public health agency. it would also be simple to allow designated public health personnel to initiate requests for specific line lists. this type of direct query capability is currently used at some of the same participating health plans to support the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink project. the distributed architecture currently in use by the NDP allows clinical facilities to provide the aggregated information needed to support rapid and efficient syndromic surveillance. the system provides support for the clinical providers to respond quickly to public health requests for detailed information when this is needed. the system provides adequate support for public health with minimal risk of inadvertent disclosure of identifiable PHI. the aggregation software can be exhaustively tested on synthesized data. the software can be exhaustively tested on synthesized data. the third disadvantage is the technical challenge of maintaining distributed software that must reliably process data. author's contributions RL wrote the first draft of the manuscript.
