{"summary": "human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a negative strand RNA virus belonging to the family Pneumoviridae. it is a major cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections in the pediatric population. no approved vaccine or effective antiviral therapy is available. TLR2, -3, and -6, for example, have been implicated in the production of cytokines and chemokines upon RSV infection. a role for a TLR4-mediated immune response upon RSV infection is currently debated. there is no evidence for a role of the CDSs (marked in purple) kinases IKK and TBK1 are activated, which phosphorylate and activate the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7. the adaptors can signal via TRAF3 or TRAF6. the transcription factors activated by PRR signaling ultimately induce expression of cytokines, chemokines, and IFNs. retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I receptors are important for the induction of type I and possibly type III IFNs upon recognition of RSV. retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) are important for the induction of type I and possibly type III IFNs upon recognition of RSV. nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) can be activated by intact genomic single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and is involved in the induction of IFN- in mice in a MAVS-dependent way. a contribution of CDSs in innate sensing of RSV replication has not been reported. NS1 and NS2 are the most abundantly transcribed viral genes. the 3D structure of NS1 is very similar to the N-terminal domain of RSV M. both NS1 and NS2 strongly reduce the induction of type I and III IFNs upon RSV infection. NS1 binding to the PRY-SPRY domain suppresses K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I by TRIM25. TRIM25 highlights evolutionary importance of TRIM25 in mammalian antiviral defense. NS1 protein of influenza A virus and nucleocapsid protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome virus also counteract TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination. NS1 and NS2 inhibit the interaction of RIG-I with MAVS. NS1 and NS2 can form a complex that is stabilized by mitochondria via MAVS. NS1 prevents the TRIM25-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I. NS1 reduces IRF3 and IRF7 protein expression and prevents the interaction between IRF3 and CBP. NS1 induces miR-29a expression, which targets the mRNA coding for IFNAR1. NS1 and NS2 also suppress type I and III IFN receptor-mediated signal transduction. NS1 and NS2 interfere with signaling downstream of MAVS Association of RLRs with MAVS leads to the recruitment of adaptors tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) and -6 (TRAF6). kinase subunit epsilon (IKK) activates downstream kinases IKK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) the effect of NS1 and NS2 on TRAF3, IKK, and TBK1 is currently inconclusive. NS1 and NS2 suppresses TRAF3 expression and enhances IKK and TBK1 expression. some evidence indicates that RSV may indeed affect TRAF6 expression. NS1 and NS2 interfere with interferon regulatory factor and nuclear factor-kappa B transcription factors. NS1 and NS2 suppress the induction of type I and III IFNs by targeting multiple proteins of the signaling cascade that leads to type I or III gene activation. NS1 and NS2 suppress the induction of type I and III IFNs by targeting multiple proteins of the signaling cascade. NS1 and NS2 suppress type I and III IFN receptor\u2013mediated signal transduction Binding of type I and III IFNs to their heterodimeric receptor complex induces a Janus kinase (JAK) signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling cascade. compared with wild-type RSV strains that lack NS1 and/or NS2 are more sensitive to type I IFN treatment. NS1 and/or NS2 may regulate expression of SOCS1 and/or SOCS3. phosphorylation and total protein levels of Tyk2 are not altered by expression of NS1 and/or NS2. infection with RSV slightly increases total STAT1 protein levels. NS1, NS2, or both reduce STAT2 levels in vitro. recombinant coexpression of NS1 and NS2 reduces STAT2 levels stronger than NS2 alone. NS1 and NS2 interfere with ISG products. NS2 in HEK293-derived cells has been shown to degrade certain ISG products. NS1 and NS2 affect the induction of apoptosis and cell shedding NS1 and NS2 individually and cooperatively delay apoptosis in RSV-infected cells. NS1 and NS2 may facilitate prolonged RSV replication with increased viral yields. recombinant virus constructs that NS2 is necessary and sufficient to induce shedding of infected epithelial cells. shedding of infected epithelial cells coincided with reducing viral titers. NS1 and NS2 counteract the anti-inflammatory activity of the glucocorticoid receptor. one group demonstrated that RSV blocks glucocorticoid-mediated GR activation in A549, BEAS-2B, and primary human small airway epithelial cells but not in the monocytic THP-1 cell line. further mechanistic analysis in A549 cells suggested that NS1 and NS2 reduce the binding of the GR to GR-responsive promoters, without affecting GR total protein levels and nuclear translocation. no difference in total GR protein levels or nuclear translocation were observed upon RSV infection. blocking ALK5 with the selective inhibitor SB431542 and reducing TGF- activity by tranilast could subvert the RSV-mediated suppression of glucocorticoid activity. inhibition of miR-24 was shown to actually repress RSV replication in A549 cells. NS1 suppresses the RSV-induced up-regulation of miR-24 within 24 hours post infection. later on, miR-24 expression may be up-regulated to enhance viral replication. NS protein-mediated suppression of let7i and miR-30b favors or counteracts RSV replication. NS proteins also play a role in the development of adaptive immune responses during RSV infection. NS1 and NS2 interfere with the adaptive immune response. deletion of NS1 was found to promote proliferation and activation of CD103+ CD8+ T cells and T-helper 17 cells. none of these effects on T cells appeared to depend on type I IFN. NS2 and not NS1 suppresses CD8+ T-cell responses in a type I IFN. a strain with only NS2 deleted was insufficiently attenuated. 2 other NS2 deletion strains with additional mutations were found to be over-attenuated. the primary endpoints of these ongoing phase I trials are measures for safety, vaccine virus infectivity and the induction of RSV-neutralizing titers. NS2 mainly localizes to mitochondria and seems to recruit NS1 towards the mitochondria. NS target proteins relocate from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria upon expression of NS1 and NS2. NS protein\u2013induced STAT2 and OASL degradation appears insensitive to MG132 [52] STAT2 degradation is nearly equally attenuated as an NS2 deletion strain. this suggests that NS2 and NS1 may induce ubiquitination of host proteins. it is currently not known if NS1 and NS2 selectively mark innate immune proteins for degradation. in HEp-2 cells and A549 cells overexpressing NS1, NS1 was shown to interact with MAVS [42\u201345] by binding to MAVS, NS1 could dose-dependently prevent the interaction between RIG-I and MAVS. ectopically expressed NS1 in HEK293T cells interacts with the PRY-SPRY domain of TRIM25. overexpressed NS2 disrupts binding of RIG-I with MAVS. however, NS1 may also influence RIG-I expression in A549 cells. this is surprising, because RIG-I is itself an ISG. NS1 and NS2 prevent the interaction of RIG-I with MAVS. NS1 binds to the PRY-SPRY domain of TRIM25. NS1 directly interacts with RIG-I (2) and NS1 interacts with MAVS (3) to suppress binding of RIG-I to MAVS. NS2 inhibits JAK1/TYK2-mediated activation of STAT1/2 by reducing STAT2 protein levels (10) and by reducing STAT1 phosphorylation (11) some groups reported that STAT2 expression can also be reduced by NS1. NS1 and NS2 interfere with signaling downstream of MAVS Association of RLRs with MAVS leads to the recruitment of adaptors tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) and -6 (TRAF6). NS1 and NS2 activate downstream kinases IKK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) overexpression of NS2 in HEK293T cells modestly reduces and slightly enhances TRAF3 and IKK expression levels. no data have been published on the possible effect of NS1 on the expression of TBK1. some evidence indicates that RSV may indeed affect TRAF6 expression. interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF)-3 and IRF7 induce conformational changes that allow the formation of homo- and heterodimers of IRF3 and -7 that translocate to the nucleus. the IRF and NF-B transcription factors are essential for the induction of type I and III IFNs. NF-B activation involves p65Ser536 phosphorylation via the RIG-I/MAVS/TRAF6/IKK signaling pathway. NF-B also strongly induces the expression of anti-apoptotic genes. NS1 and NS2 suppress the induction of type I and III IFNs. NS1 induces the expression of the miRNA miR-29a. it targets the mRNA coding for interferon alpha/beta receptor 1 (IFNAR1) by an unknown mechanism. induction of an antiviral state by type I and type III IFNs requires the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 proteins. both STAT1 and 2 are targets for RSV. infection with RSV slightly increases total STAT1 protein levels. both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated STAT2 protein levels are clearly reduced. NS1 and NS2 interfere with ISG products. ectopic expression of NS1 and NS2 in HEK293-derived cells has been shown to suppress antiviral activity of at least some ISG products. the early expression of NS1 and NS2 after infection activates the anti-apoptotic 3-phophoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK)-RAC serine/threonine-protein kinase kinase (AKT)-glycogen synthase kinase kinase kinase (GSK) pathway. later in infection (>24 hours), activation of this pathway drops, and NS1 and NS2 counteract the anti-inflammatory activity of the glucocorticoid receptor. the use of anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids has shown no clinical benefits against (severe) disease. the exact mechanism that accounts for this inhibition is debated. NS1 and NS2 may indirectly suppress GR activation through inhibition of MAVS. Xia and colleagues used BEAS-2B and primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells grown at an air\u2013liquid interface to demonstrate that RSV suppresses glucocorticoid-induced GR activation. NS1 and NS2 interfere with induction of miRNAs miR-24, let-7i, and miR-30b. inhibition of miR-24 represses RSV replication in a549 cells. NS1 suppresses miR-24 expression within 24 hours post infection. NS proteins suppress type I IFN response. miR-30b promoter can be activated by NF-B family member p65. p65 is activated during an RSV infection through a RIG-I/MAVS signaling pathway. in vivo pulmonary conventional DC activation was strongly hampered in RSV-infected mice that are deficient for RSV-induced type I IFN production. the pleiotropic effector functions of NS1 and NS2 to counteract the production of type I IFNs likely account for the reduced DC maturation by NS1 and NS2. a small residual population of CD86-positive pulmonary DCs was still present in these mice that could migrate to the draining mediastinal lymph node to activate naive CD8+ T cells. a strain with only NS2 deleted was insufficiently attenuated, but 2 other NS2 deletion strains with additional mutations were found to be over-attenuated. NS1 and NS2 affect the induction of apoptosis and cell shedding NS1 and NS2 individually and cooperatively delay apoptosis. early expression of NS1 and NS2 after infection activates the anti-apoptotic 3-phophoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK)-RAC serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT)-glycogen synthase kin shedding of infected epithelial cells reduces viral spread. changes in cell morphology may facilitate RSV production and spreading. NS1 and NS2 counteract the anti-inflammatory activity of the glucocorticoid receptor. NS1 and NS2 may indirectly suppress GR activation through inhibition of MAVS. a model was proposed in which viral infection is sensed by TLR3, which induces TGF- that subsequently activates the type I TGF- receptor activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5). expression of GR and importin-13 was reduced at the mRNA and protein level in mouse lungs. NS1 and NS2 interfere with the induction of miRNAs. NS1 suppresses miR-24 expression by up-regulating the transcription factor. let7i and miR-30b expression is up-regulated during an RSV infection by a type I IFN and NF-B-dependent mechanism. the NS proteins suppress the type I IFN response and further increased in the absence of NS1 or NS2. the NS proteins may dampen this pathway, leading to reduced activation of p65. NS1 and NS2 suppress the maturation of human DCs by using an IFNAR2-blocking antibody. this suppression was shown to partially depend on the capacity of the NS proteins to counteract the production of type I IFNs. in vivo pulmonary conventional DC activation was strongly hampered in RSV-infected mice that are deficient for MAVS. a small residual population of CD86-positive pulmonary DCs was still present in these mice that could migrate to the draining mediastinal lymph node to activate naive CD8+ T cells. a strain with only NS2 deleted was insufficiently attenuated, while 2 other NS2 deletion strains with additional mutations were found to be over-attenuated. the primary endpoints of these ongoing phase I trials with the live-attenuated RSV strains NS1 and NS2 form a large (300 to 750 kDa) degradative complex. this complex could selectively degrade particular innate immune signaling proteins. NS target proteins relocate from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria upon expression of NS1 and NS2. NS protein\u2013induced STAT2 and OASL degradation is blocked by proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin [51, 60, 61, 73, 75] proteasome-like activity of the NSD complex is further supported by the identification of NS1 and NS2 as potential inducers of host protein ubiquitination. NS2 does not contain an Elongin C binding consensus sequence. helix 3 is important for at least some NS1-mediated effector functions. NS1 and NS2 may be attractive targets for antiviral therapy. NS1 and NS2 exert additional functions, such as delaying cell apoptosis. large-scale protein\u2013protein interaction screens will generate a more comprehensive list of host proteins that interact with NS1 and/or NS2. such new knowledge, combined with co-crystal structure analysis of RSV NS1 and NS2 in complex with host protein factors, will be instrumental to design antiviral drugs that impact on the RSV\u2013host interface."}
