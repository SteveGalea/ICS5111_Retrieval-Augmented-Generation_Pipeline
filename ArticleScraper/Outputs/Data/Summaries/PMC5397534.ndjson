{"summary": "emotions are categorized dichotomously, as negative or positive, unpleasant or pleasant, activated or deactivated, and so on. in this paper, we argue that each emotion contains some degree of both negativity and positivity. if this conceptualization is supported, it would facilitate more parsimonious explanations of several findings related to emotion. the current dominant models are the circumplex model (Russell, 1980; Plutchik and Conte, 1997; Remington et al., 2000); the vector model (Bradley et al., 1992); and the positive Activation \u2013 Negative Activation (PANA) model (Watson and Tellegen, 1985). in most (if not all) of these models, valence is one important dimension, along which a specific emotion is categorized as either positive or negative happiness is considered as a positive and desirable emotion, but research has revealed a darker side of happiness. people who pursue happiness strongly tend to be more depressed, miserable, and unhappy. participants primed with happy emotions displayed significantly more selfishness. cross-cultural research casts doubt on the classification of emotions as strictly positive or negative, because an emotion that is considered negative in one culture can be considered positive in another. individualistic cultures tend to consider pride as a desirable emotion, and collectivist cultures tend to consider guilt a desirable emotion. the affective component is related to our immediate response to stimuli (feelings), while the cognitive component is our more controlled, conscious evaluation after the immediate response (thinking). the affective process is more immediate and provides a strong subjective sense of feeling that is prominent to oneself. experience of feeling states, but concern their reflective experience. the regulatory process of the reflective experience is under individual\u2019s control. some cultures focus on hedonic pleasures (e.g., Western cultures) while others focus on peace and harmony (e.g., Eastern cultures). dialectical thinking is thought to drive the more predominant emotional complexity of East-Asians relative to Westerners. dialectical thinking involves a greater expectation of change, it is likely that any thought about emotion will be less extreme. if something is expected to change or fluctuate, it would not be taken in the extreme view. et al. (2016) reported evidence that people differ in negative affect valuation. the extent to which negative affective states are valued as pleasant, useful/helpful, appropriate, and meaningful experience, which has implications for the links between affective experience and psychological well-being. six basic emotions (sadness, fear, disgust, anger, anger, surprise, and happiness) have been identified as universal. in another early attempt to understand emotion, Wundt (1897) proposed that all emotions can be described by three dimensions: pleasurable to non-pleasurable, arousing to subduing, and strained to relaxed. itivity and Negativity in Emotion Research First, research suggests that there are simultaneous positive and negative outcomes associated with specific emotions. a positive emotion can lead to a negative consequence, and a negative emotion can lead to a positive consequence. cross-cultural research casts doubt on the classification of emotions as strictly positive or negative, because an emotion that is considered negative in one culture can be considered positive in another. individualistic cultures tend to consider pride as a desirable emotion, and collectivist cultures tend to consider guilt a desirable emotion. Emotional Components Research has indicated that emotion has affective and cognitive components. the affective component is related to our immediate response to stimuli (feelings), while the cognitive component is our more controlled, conscious evaluation after the immediate response (thinking) moods have at least two components: the direct experience of a mood, and a meta level of experience that consists of thoughts and feelings about the mood. they are called meta-moods because they do not concern the immediate experience of feeling states, but concern their reflective experience. the regulatory process of the reflective experience is under the individual\u2019s control. dialectical thinking is thought to drive the more predominant emotional complexity of East-Asians relative to Westerners. if something is expected to change or fluctuate, it would not be taken in the extreme view. if something is expected to change or fluctuate, it would not be taken in the extreme view. cross-culturally, Miyamoto et al. (2014) found that Asians were less likely than Euro-Americans to engage in hedonic emotion regulation after experiencing a negative event or feeling a negative emotion. this was especially true for adolescents and younger adults. based on research that the affective component of emotion is more intense and extreme than the cognitive component, we hypothesized that the positivity and negativity ratings would be more divergent for affective than cognitive components. sadness, which is salient in negativity, should be rated more negatively on the affective than the cognitive component, and relatively less positively on the affective than cognitive component (H2). study was conducted in a lab setting, with all measures presented on a computer monitor. participants thought about each basic emotion (presented in a random order) and then responded to two questions measuring the affective positivity and negativity, and cognitive positivity and negativity of each emotion in a random order. sample included a total of 458 undergraduate students (166 men and 292 women) recruited in four countries: 147 South Koreans (61 men and 86 women, mean age 20.51, SD = 2.04), 90 Chinese (44 men and 46 women, mean age 18.87, SD = 1.06), 109 Euro-Canadians (15 men and 94 women, mean age 19.11, SD = 6.96), and 112 Americans (46 men and 66 women, mean age 21.39, SD = 5.76 we asked two questions to measure sadness\u2019s affective positivity. affective negativity, cognitive positivity, and cognitive negativity. the correlations ranged from 0.58 to 0.78 for affective positivity ratings. the coexistence of Positivity and Negativity To test hypothesis 1, we compared the average positivity and negativity ratings of the affective and cognitive components to zero (which means \u201cnot at all\u201d positive or negative) further analyses showed that the ratings of positivity and negativity ratings were most divergent for happiness, followed by disgust, anger, sadness, fear, and surprise. surprise is a much more ambivalent emotion than happiness, with anger, disgust, fear and sadness in between. sadness, fear, surprise and happiness were more ambivalent to Chinese/Koreans than to Canadians/Americans, Fs 3.65, ps 0.013. this between-emotional and cross-cultural differences cannot be explained by random responding. the intensity of the weaker rating in valence, is a \"more appropriate statistic (p92)\" to test whether positivity and negativity are mutually exclusive. we computed MIN value as the lower of the two valence ratings (i.e., I[V] = MIN[I[P],I[N] the ratings of positivity and I[N] the ratings of negativity) post hoc analyses showed that the MIN scores for anger and sadness did not differ from each other. the main effects were qualified by a significant two-way interaction between country and emotion. a higher MIN score than the other three groups (ps 0.042)2. the other three groups did not differ from one another (ps > 0.352) for sadness, each country was significantly different from any other country (ps 0.038)3. positive components (both affective and cognitive) loaded on one factor, and negative components (both affective and cognitive) on the other. for all six emotions, the two-factor model was a better fit than the one-factor model based on several fit indices. the majority in the basic emotions are more negative than positive (e.g., sadness, fear, disgust, and anger) american and Canadian ratings would be higher for the salient valence and lower for the less salient valence (e.g., negativity for sadness) valence emotion country interaction was significant, F(15,1356) = 16.38, p = 0.001, p 2 = 0.15. valence emotion country interaction was significant, p = 0.013, p 2 = 0.02. sadness To test H2 that the positivity and negativity ratings would be more divergent for affective. simple effect analyses revealed that Canadians (MCanada & negativity = 5.03, se = 0.10) and Americans (MUS & negativity = 4.52, se = 0.10) rated sadness to be more negative than Chinese (MChina & negativity = 4.07, se = 0.11), and Koreans (MKorea & negativity = 3.55, se = 0.10), Fs > 43.42, ps 0.017, whereas Chinese (MKorea & positivity = 2. Chinese (MChina & negativity = 4.45, se = 0.12), Canadians (MCanada & negativity = 4.23, se = 0.11) and Americans (MUS & negativity = 4.16, se = 0.11) rated fear to be more negative compared to Koreans (MKorea & negativity = 3.90, se = 0.09) and Chinese (MChina & positivity = 1.55, se = 0.11) and Chinese (MChina & positivity = 1.46, the 2 (valence) 2 interaction was significant for Koreans, F(1,146) = 18.31, p 0.001, p 2 = 0.11, and Chinese, F(1,89) = 9.25, p = 0.003, p 2 = 0.09, but not for Canadians, F(1,108) = 0.00, p = 0.976, p 2 = 0.00, nor Americans, F(1,111) = 11, p = 0.739, p 2 = 0.00 we examined H3 within affective and cognitive components separately. the simple effect analyses revealed that Canadians (MCanada & affective & negativity = 5.02, se = 0.11) rated strongest affective negativity for disgust followed by Koreans (MKorea & affective & negativity = 4.83, se = 0.10), Chinese (MChina & affective & negativity = 4.71, se = 0.12), and Americans (MUS & affective & negativity = 4.42 americans (MCanada & cognitive & negativity = 4.73, se = 0.11), and americans (MUS & cognitive & positivity = 0.93, se = 0.11) rated disgust less positively than did Koreans (MKorea & cognitive & positivity = 1.44, se = 0.10), and Chinese (MChina & cognitive & positivity = 1.46, se = 0.12), Fs > 10.84, ps 0.009. cognitive negativity (MKorea & cognitive & negativity = 4.11, se = 0.10; MChina & cognitive & negativity = 4.38, se = 0.13) stronger compared to cognitive negativity (MKorea & cognitive & positivity = 2.07, se = 0.11; MChina & cognitive & negativity = 1.63, se = 0.14) stronger than affective positivity (MKorea & cognitive & positivity = 1.34, se = 0. only the difference between Americans and Canadians was significant, F = 2.83, p = 0.031. there were no significant differences between the four countries on affective positivity for anger. happiness was rated more negatively on the cognitive component (Mcognitive & negativity = 0.54, se = 0.04) than the affective component (Maffective & negativity = 0.65, se = 0.04), t = 2.37, p = 0.18. a significant two-way interaction between country and valence was not qualified by a 3-way interaction. surprise The interaction between valence and component, F(3,454) = 0.15, p = 0.703, was not significant, neither was the three-way interaction, F(3,454) = 0.82, p = 0.486. surprise was also rated more negatively on the cognitive (Mcognitive & negativity = 2.26, se = 0.06) than affective (Maffective & negativity = 2.18, se = 0.06) component, t = 1.85, a one-way ANOVA on each of the four pooled response types across all emotions revealed significant differences for three of the pooled variables. affective, cognitive, negativity, and positivity, with culture as the predictor. results revealed significant differences for three of the pooled variables. the correlations ranged from 0.59 to 0.73 across emotions for affective positivity ratings, and from 0.46 to 0.76 for affective negativity ratings, ps 0.001. the correlations ranged from 0.58 to 0.78 for cognitive positivity ratings, and from 0.65 to 0.80 for cognitive negativity ratings. ps 0.041.1 If less divergent ratings of positivity and negativity indicate ambivalence, the results showed that surprise is a much more ambivalent emotion than happiness, with anger, disgust, fear and sadness in between. however, these between-emotional and cross-cultural differences cannot be explained by random responding.

Canadians showed the same pattern of results for negativity as Koreans and Chinese (MCanada & affective & negativity = 4.87, se = 0.12), t = 4.01, p 0.001. however, they showed no significant differences between cognitive positivity (MCanada & cognitive & negativity = 1.36, se = 0.12) and affective positivity (MCanada & affective & positivity = 0.98, se = 0.11), t = 1.26, p = Canadians (MCanada & cognitive & negativity = 4.74, se = 0.12) and americans (MUS & cognitive & negativity = 4.50, se = 0.11) rated anger more negatively than did Koreans (MKorea & cognitive & negativity = 4.11, se = 0.10), Fs > 5.97, p 0.001 and p = 0.057, respectively. happiness was rated equally positively on the affective component (Maffective & positivity = 5.47, se = 0.04) and the cognitive component (Mcognitive & positivity = 5.46, se = 0.04) so, H2 was partially supported. a significant two-way interaction between country and valence, F(3,454) = 15.54, p 0.001, p 2 = 0.10, not qualified by a 3-way interaction supported H3. surprise was rated more negatively on cognitive (Mcognitive & negativity = 2.26, se = 0.06) than affective (Maffective & negativity = 2.18, se = 0.06) component, t = 1.85, p = 0.066. in support of H3, we found a significant two-way interaction. results revealed significant differences for three of the pooled variables. affective, F(3,454) = 6.86, p 0.001, p 2 = 0.04 (Koreans and Canadians scored higher than Chinese and American); and positivity, F(3,454) = 6.74, p = 0.001, p 2 = 0.04 (Koreans and Canadians scored higher than the other three groups); and positivity, F(3,454) = 5.46, p = 0.336, the results for most emotions partially or fully supported our hypotheses. Easterners (Koreans and Chinese) reported stronger positivity of sadness compared to Westerners (Canadians and Americans), while Westerners reported stronger negativity of sadness compared to Easterners. only americans reported a stronger level of cognitive disgust relative to others. this suggests that culture affects how people face and deal with disgust. this may be due to Easterners\u2019 dialectical thinking style. happiness is considered to evoke less arousal in Easterners compared to Westerners. happiness contains possibly more negativity for Easterners. this suggests happiness may be experienced differently across cultures. implication of this study is that the cognitive processes that arise from culture affect how people feel. this may stem from differences in thinking styles, such as dialectical and linear thinking. Westerners tend to focus more on one pattern\u2014things will tend to stay as they are, good or bad. limitation and Future Directions There are some limitations to the present research. first, participants were all students. the american sample had a higher percentage of Hispanics compared to Caucasians. acquiescence and extremity are valid representations of cultural differences. acquiescence and extremity are valid representations of cultural differences. conducted the project across four countries while she was in canada, analyzed the data, and wrote the paper. MM conducted the project in the us, and contributed to writing the paper."}
