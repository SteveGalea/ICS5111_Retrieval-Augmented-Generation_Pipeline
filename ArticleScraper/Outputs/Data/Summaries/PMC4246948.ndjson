{"summary": "compared the composition of TCRB gene rearrangements at the level of TCRBV and TCRBJ gene segment use and the features of the CDR3-encoding junctional nucleotides. Approximately 1.5\u20133 million sequence reads were obtained for each T-cell subset of each donor. the Chao2 estimator requires only a binary characterization of presence or absence of each clone in each replicate library. it circumvents the challenges that arise in experimental designs using only a single library. the lower bounds on TCRB gene richness obtained with this approach yield higher estimates than previous studies. increase in age is associated with a decline in richness of nave CD4 and CD8 memory T cells. richness in CD4 and CD8 memory T cells markedly differed. richness showed negligible contraction with age. CD8 memory T cells were 5- to 10-fold less diverse than CD4 memory T cells. estimates of clonal size distributions are only reliable for clones above a clonal size threshold. clonality scores were compared by Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney test. the observed increase indicate inequality in clonal sizes in the elderly nave T-cell repertoire with age with increasing number of large clones. increased clonality in the nave T-cell compartment is not caused by an enrichment in public TCRB sequences CD4 nave T-cell clones (n = 483) CD8 nave T-cell clones (n = 878) Age, y Public Unique Public Unique 20\u201335 92 (19%) 391 (80.9%) 129 (14.7%) 749 (75.3%) 70\u201385 23 (4.8%) 460 (95.2%) 81 (9.2%) 797 (90.8%) Effect of age on Clo nondetectable clonal sizes were set at the minimal frequency of 1 in 106 (A) large clonal expansions were more frequent in CD8 than in CD4 T cells with only minor influence of age on clonality in both compartments. clonally expanded CD4 and CD8 TCRB sequences were determined. each row represents one sequence and each lane an independent library of nave or memory T cells. TCRB sequences originally identified in the nave compartment were virtually absent in memory cell pools. TCRB sequences from cultured T cells were analyzed for their presence in the replicate libraries of unstimulated nave T cells. large clones are enriched compared with small clones (P 0.001) compared the composition of TCRB gene rearrangements at the level of TCRBV and TCRBJ gene segment use and the features of the junctional nucleotides. Approximately 1.5\u20133 million sequence reads were obtained for each T-cell subset of each donor. the lower bounds on TCRB gene richness obtained with this approach yielded higher estimates than previous studies. age is associated with a modest decrease in diversity of the TCRB repertoire. ve TCRB repertoire richness declined significantly in the 70- to 85-y-old adults. richness in CD4 and CD8 memory T cells markedly differed. the impact of age was negligibly small. clonality scores in the elderly are approximately >100-fold higher for nave CD8 T cells and >10-fold higher in CD4 T cells compared with younger individuals. clonality scores in the elderly are approximately >100-fold higher for nave CD8 T cells. nondetectable clonal sizes were set at a frequency of 1 in 107. clonality scores were compared by Wilcoxon\u2013Mann\u2013Whitney test. increased clonality in the nave T-cell compartment is not caused by an enrichment in public TCRB sequences CD4 nave T-cell clones (n = 483) there was little effect of age on the clonality of memory CD4 or CD8 T cells. large clonal expansions were more frequent in CD8 than in CD4 T cells. effector T cells can revert to a phenotype sharing cell surface markers with nave cells (23). clonal expansions in the nave compartment of elderly individuals were not contaminating memory cells. each row represents one sequence and each lane an independent library of nave or memory T cells. TCRB sequences originally identified in the nave compartment were virtually absent in memory cell pools. clonal expansions originated from nave cells and maintained nave phenotype. the fastest-proliferating cultured T cells show enrichment of large clones found in four replicate libraries from the blood. large clones are enriched compared with small clones (P 0.001) thymic involution is the most dramatic age-related change in the human immune system. thymic activity may not play a significant role in the maintenance of TCR diversity in adult life. the use of multiple replicate sequencing libraries generated from independent samples of T cells enabled us to identify the rare sequences that are critical for estimates of the number of unobserved species. we corrected for sequencing errors by excluding sequences related to detected peaks in sequence space. clonal clonality increased by a factor of >100 for nave CD8 and >10 for nave CD4 T cells compared with young adults. clonal clonality increased by a factor of >100 for nave CD8 and of >10 for nave CD4 T cells compared with young adults. nave CD8 T cells had a much higher clonality score than nave CD4 T cells. richness in both compartments was very similar, suggesting a higher variance in clonal sizes in CD8 T cells. inequalities in clonal sizes with some large and many very small clones may generate a less complex T-cell response. in vitro culture of nave T cells in presence of homeostatic cytokines. but absence of foreign antigens, selected for TCR sequences clonally expanded in vivo. this may explain why lymphopenia-induced homeostatic proliferation confers an increased risk for autoimmunity. TCRB repertoire richness was determined by applying the Chao2 nonparametric estimator of the lower bound of species richness in a population after correcting for possible sequencing errors and eliminating TCRB sequences that are close to peaks in sequence space."}
