{"summary": "in a cross-sectional study, 135 children, 5 years of age who presented with ARTIs were included. a single viral pathogen was detected in 76 patients, viral coinfections in 9 and mixed viral and bacterial pathogens in 15. children 5 years of age presented with signs and symptoms of upper and/or lower respiratory tract infection seen in the pediatric emergency room. written consent was obtained from their parents. diagnosis for each patient was performed by the attending pediatrician based on the world health organisation (WHO) standard clinical criteria. asopharyngeal samples were tested using QIAamp viral mini kit. the sample cDNAs were tested in a 3-tube reaction following the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. the type of respiratory virus was identified by comparison with the reference band size provided by the manufacturer. Statistical significance was defined as a p-value less than 0.05. all analyses were performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 15.0. tube-1 contained primers set A targeting AdV, hCoV 229E/NL63, and PIV1-3. tube-3 contained primers set C targeting hBoV 1/2/3/4, IBV, hMPV, and hEV. negative control contained only double distilled water. a single viral pathogen was detected in 76 (56.3%); viral co-infections in 9 (6.7%); and mixed viral and bacterial pathogen in 15 (11.1%) patients. children were divided into 5 age-groups: 12 months (n=73; 54.1%), 13-24 months (n=32; 23.7%), 25-36 months (n=9; 6.7%), 37-48 months (n=9; 6.7%), and 49-60 months (n=12; 8.9%). median age of children with hMPV was significantly higher than that of children infected with the other viruses (p=0.005) mainly RSV (p=0.01) Table 2. Demographic and clinical presentations of the studied patients. hRV was the most frequent respiratory virus detected, followed by hRV. most hRVs (17/22; 77.3%) were associated with URTI's. most hRVs (17/22; 77.3%) were associated with URTI's. the hMPV is one of the causes of upper and lower RTI's. in a previous study,14 hMPV was identified in 8.3% of 489 children with ARTI's. almost half of the cases (7/13; 54%) were co-infected with other viruses. clinical manifestations of other viral infections were nonspecific with fever and cough as the main symptoms. one limitation of this study is the inability to describe the seasonal distribution of respiratory viruses due to the short duration of the study. molecular-based studies of longer surveillance duration are necessary to elucidate seasonal patterns and disease burden associated with respiratory viral pathogens."}
