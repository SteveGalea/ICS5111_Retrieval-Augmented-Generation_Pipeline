{"summary": "some ncRNAs, such as ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and those well-studied ones including microRNAs (miRNAs) are recognized as functional molecules, but the majority of ncRNAs and their biological roles in mammals are underappreciated. accumulating evidence has exhibited a remarkable degree of their involvement in many biological events including cell proliferation. sncRNAs are capable of mediating both transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing. the most extensively studied among them are miRNAs that regulate target mRNAs post-transcriptionally in animals and plants [8,9,10] another class of sncRNAs is siRNAs that are closely related to miRNAs. there are more than 600 tRNA genes in humans, which are far more than needed for at most 64 anticodons and 20 amino acids. tRNAs were recently identified as a new class of sncRNAs fragmentized from tRNAs and shown to be important in regulating cell proliferation, stress-induced translational suppression, stress granule (SG) assembly, and virus replication. 'CCA' acceptor stem must be added to the 3'-end as this is not encoded in eukaryotes. multiple groups have cloned and sequenced shorter tRNA fragments. tRF-5 series whose 5'-end is aligned to the 3'-end of mature tRNA. the tRF-1 series are undoubtedly the RNase Z cleavage product of a pre-tRNA. their 5'-ends begin immediately after the 3'-terminus of the mature tRNA. their 3'-ends are a series of U residues that are residual from RNA polymerase III transcription run-off. tRFs are very much structure-dependent, suggesting they are not randomly degraded products. tRNA-derived RNA fragments (tRFs) are indispensable components of translational machinery. tRNA halves generated by ANG during stress play an active role in inhibiting protein synthesis. tRNA halves generated by ANG during stress play an active role in inhibiting protein synthesis. a 26-nt long tRF-5 originating from tRNAVal in a stress-dependent manner was shown to directly bind to the small ribosomal subunit and reduce protein synthesis by interfering with peptidyl transferase activity. a similar mechanism of translation inhibition by a tRF-5 was also observed in human cells. tRF5-GluCTC is induced robustly and plays a gene-silencing role on a target mRNA with a reverse complementary target sequence. the 3'-portion of tRF5-GluCTC is critical for its gene silencing function, in contrast to miRNAs whose 5'-portion is the key determinant in target recognition. the role of tRFs in cancer was first reported by Lee et al3. tRFs in metastatic tissues were 18 nucleotides long. tRFs in metastatic tissues were 27 nucleotides long. tRFs re-program translation and promote assembly of stress granules. kinase-dead mice accumulate 5'-leader-exon-tRFs that sensitize cells to oxidative stress and promote cell death in a p53-dependent fashion [56] kinase-dead mice accumulate 5'-leader-exon-tRFs that sensitize cells to oxidative stress and promote cell death in a p53-dependent fashion. some strategies involve viral-derived or endogenous cellular ncRNAs that interact with host immune responses. some of these strategies involve viral-derived or endogenous cellular ncRNAs that interact with host immune responses. tRF5-gluCTC is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in babies. tRFs may be targets for the development of new drugs to control viral replication. human metapneumovirus, a negative-sense single stranded RNA virus, did not induce tRFs but gradually enhanced the expression percentage of miRNAs in a time-dependent fashion. tRFs regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional stages in the cytoplasm. tRFs can repress target mRNAs by inhibiting their translation or facilitating their decay. tRFs can repress target mRNAs by inhibiting their translation or facilitating their decay. some tRFs are bound to Argonaute/Piwi proteins, well-known components of the RNA-induced silencing complex. expression of tRFs does not usually affect mature tRNA pools."}
