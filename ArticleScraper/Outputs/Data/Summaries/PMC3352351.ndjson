{"summary": "RUBV is the only member of the genus Rubivirus of the family togaviridae. RUBV causes a mild disease in children and adults, but operates as an extremely efficient teratogen when fetal infection occurs. RUBV genome was reported to be mediated by a CP protein-binding site between nt 347 and 375 in the viral genome and a RNA-binding domain on CP comprising aa 28\u201356. CP negatively regulates RNA binding of CP and influences rate of RNA replication. a packaging cell line expressing the RUBV structural protein ORF was transfected with in vitro replicon RNA transcripts of replicons. replicons are cDNA constructs in which the structural protein ORF has been replaced with a reporter gene. they lack the means for cell-to-cell spread or virion formation because they do not encode the structural proteins. 106 infectious GFP transducing units (GTU) ml1 were similar, i.e. 106 infectious GFP transducing units (GTU) ml1. replicon constructs, mutagenesis of the putative PS and packaging efficiencies. gRNA, sgRNA and 18S rRNA co-migrate with the sgRNA of these constructs. above the complete blot is the portion of the blot containing the gRNA exposed for twice as long. we previously reported that synonymous mutations in this region could dramatically alter replication by most of the mutants. modPS-5 exhibited both a replication and packaging efficiency approaching the non-mutant parent replicon. if nt 347\u2013375 were the PS, it would be expected that packaging efficiency would be uncoupled from replication efficiency in that some mutants would exhibit no packaging. some of these fragments, including the 200 bp fragments, were inserted in either orientation into a StuI site within the 3\u2032 UTR of the SINrep RNA. the complete NS-ORF scan was also inserted into an XbaI site upstream of the reporter GFP gene. the insertion of the neighbouring 200 bp fragment lacking or comprising the putative PS failed to increase packaging above the background level. a pair of in-frame AUGs were separated by seven codons at the beginning of the CP gene. a BHK/CE2E1 cell line expressing a CP with a deletion of the first AUG and the next seven codons (C8) was generated following transfection of both cell lines with RUBrep\u2013GFP transcripts. the titre of infectious VRPs produced was almost 2 logs higher from the wild-type (wt) cells than from the C8 C-Vero cells have been shown to potentiate replication of transfected replicon transcripts. CP protein lacking the first eight amino acids was not able to participate in early post-entry steps in virus replication. the number of produced VRPs was titrated on both vero and C-Vero cells. the packaging efficiencies given are the means of duplicate independent experiments. vero and C-Vero cells were transfected with equal aliquots of RUBrep/GFP transcripts or infected with equal aliquots of packaged RUBrep/GFP replicons produced in BHK/CE2E1 cells. a large (500 bp), lethal, in-frame deletion between two NotI sites in the P150 gene can be rescued by CP. VRPs with packaged RUBrep/GFP\u2013RFP replicons were prepared in BHK/CE2E1 cells. the only source of CP in the infected vero cells is from the infecting VRPs. this result proves that CP in the virus particle plays a function in early post-entry replication. both enhanced GFP expression and RFP expression are observed in both vero and C-Vero cells 48 h post-infection with packaged RUBrep/GFP\u2013RFP replicons. both enhanced GFP expression and RFP expression are observed in both vero and C-Vero cells. the trans-encapsidation system employed consisted of a BHK cell line stably expressing the RUBV structural proteins, BHK/CE2E1. third codon mutagenesis using a degenerate primer was used to produce eight mutations in the putative PS between nt 347 and 374 in RUBrep/C\u2013GFP\u2013E1 (termed modPS 1\u20138). relative GFP expression in transfected Vero cells and GTU produced following transfection of BHK/CE2E1 cells. replicon derived from a naturally selected defective-interfering (DI) RNA that encodes a fusion protein consisting of the N-terminal part of CP, GFP and the C-terminal part of E1 was used to analyse the PS proposed by Liu et al. (1996) between nt 347 and 375 of the RUBV genome. mutagenesis using degenerate primers was applied to introduce synonymous third codon mutations into this region the NS-ORF including the 5\u2032 UTR was divided into six segments of about 700\u20131200 nt. two 200 bp fragments comprising nt 320\u2013514 and 488\u2013691, either contained or lay downstream of the PS between nt 347 and 375 proposed by Liu et al. insertion of the first 1000 nt of the RUBV genome at the StuI site increased packaging about 15\u201320-fold. all except nt 926\u20131669 enhanced encapsidation between 20- and 50-fold. lines expressing wt or mutant CPs were used to assess the effect of these mutations on packaging. a pair of in-frame AUGs separated by seven codons at the beginning of the CP gene. the downstream AUG is in a better Kozak context for initiation of translation. CP in the virus particle plays a role in an early post-entry replication event. the mutant CP lacking the N-terminal amino acid is deficient in this event. both cell lines were radiolabelled and the amount of virus protein was determined. thionine for 24 h and radiolabelled proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and cell medium and resolved by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. the migration of each of the structural proteins is indicated (note that the CP from BHK/C8E2E1 cells migrates more rapidly than CP from BHK/CE2E1 cells due to the amino terminal deletion) a large (500 bp), lethal, in-frame deletion between two NotI sites in the P150 gene can be rescued by CP. this rescue occurs at an early stage in replication because in the absence of CP no RNA accumulation in cells transfected with replicons bearing the notI deletion is detected. vero and C-Vero cells were transfected with equal aliquots of RUBrep/GFP\u2013RFP transcripts or infected with equal aliquots of packaged RUBrep/GFP\u2013RFP replicons produced in BHK/CE2E1 cells. both enhanced GFP expression and RFP expression are observed in both vero and C-Vero cells 48 h post-infection. efficient trans-encapsidation systems have been put to use to gain knowledge about virus functions, but also to develop transport/entry vehicles and single cycle vaccine vectors. in the case of the alphaviruses, the other genus of the family Togaviridae, efficient trans-encapsidation systems have been put to use to gain knowledge about virus functions. nt 164\u2013165 of the RA27/3 vaccine strain resulted in attenuation of replication efficiency of the resulting virus. however, packaging efficiency of these mutated replicons correlated with replication efficiency. inclusion of the CP gene in the SINrep did not increase packaging efficiency, indicating a modicum of specificity. encapsidation involves a ribonucleoprotein complex besides recognition of a specific PS by the CP. in poliovirus-infected cells RNA packaging and replication seem to be connected through colocalization of RNA replication complexes. the deletion led to a 100-fold reduction in VRP titre, indicating that the full-length protein initiated at the first AUG is necessary for encapsidation. however, the titre exhibited by VRPs containing this mutation could be increased by CP provided in trans in the target cells. the defect in part exhibited by the C8 mutant involved early replication in the target cells. CP could replace the NotI region of P150 in replicons with maintenance of viability. a chaperone activity within CP would also explain the potentiation of wt replicon replication in transfected C-Vero cells. RUBV infectious cDNA clone Robo502 (Tzeng & Frey, 2003), the RUBV replicons RUBrep/GFP, RUBrep/C\u2013GFP and RUBrep/C\u2013GFP\u2013E1 (Tzeng & Frey, 2003, 2006; Tzeng et al., 2001) were cultured similarly except that the medium contained 400 g G418 ml1. PCR amplification was used for the cloning of fragments from the RUBV genome into SINrep at either the XbaI site at the 5\u2032 end of the GFP gene. oligonucleotides contained nucleotides at either end of the fragment to be amplified plus suitable restriction enzyme sites for introduction into the SINrep vector. supernatants were collected 48 h post-transfection, clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 1500 g and filtration through 0.45 m-pore-size membranes. cells were infected with 10-fold serial dilution of VRP stocks made in DMEM with 2 % FBS. monolayers of BHK/CE2E1 and BHK/C8E2E1 cells were 35S-methionine labelled for 24 h. after removal of supernatant, the cells were lysed. proportional aliquots of both lysates and supernatant was incubated. a three-round asymmetrical PCR amplification strategy was used to create the PS with synonymous third codon position mutations inserted between nt 347 and 375 of the genome. PCR amplification was used for the cloning of fragments from the RUBV genome into SINrep at either the XbaI site at the 5\u2032 end of the gene. single cells were picked, subcultured and selected for their level of protein expression by Western blot analysis. CHO24S cells were named according to the expressed protein(s) transfected cells were lysed 3 days post-transfection and analysed by Northern blot using a 32P-labelled nick translated GFP gene probe. the protocols for immunoprecipitation have been described previously. the RUBV replicons RUBrep/GFP, RUBrep/C\u2013GFP and RUBrep/C\u2013GFP\u2013E1. a three-round asymmetrical PCR amplification strategy was employed. a three-round asymmetrical PCR amplification strategy was used. the BHK21 cell line was cotransfected with pTK-Hygro (Clontech) containing hygromycin resistance gene and pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) expressing the SP-ORF (CE2E1) or the SP-ORF containing a CP truncated by eight amino acids at its N terminus (C8E2E1) cotransfection followed by hygromycin selection (Invitrogen) at a concentration of all cells were analysed using an Axioplan 2 microscope (Zeiss) with epifluorescence capacity. for detection of replicon RNA synthesis, transfected cells were lysed 3 days post-transfection."}
