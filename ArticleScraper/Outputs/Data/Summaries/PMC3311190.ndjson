{"summary": "EC/REC of various degrees of severity was described in the herds. the samples were sent to the laboratories of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell\u2019Emilia Romagna, Brescia, Italy. 139 fecal samples were collected from postweaning rabbits (30\u201335 days of age) from 15 herds. the animals were overtly healthy at the time of sampling. RNA Extraction and Screening for AstVs by Reverse Transcription PCR RNA extracts were prepared from 10% homogenates in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3. the samples from collection A were used for an initial screening with a broadly reactive primer pair targeted to the ORF1b region of AstV (13). the sequences displayed the highest identity (69.0%\u201371.3% nt) to an AstV from a California sea lion the ORF1b amplicon (409 bp) of the rabbit AstV strain Nausika/08/ITA was cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector (TOPO TA cloning, Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) the detection limit was 10 genomic equivalents (GEs)/50 L-reaction (cycle threshold = 42.67), corresponding to 3.6 102 GE/g of fecal sample. the feces were diluted 1:10 in distilled water, vortexed, and centrifuged for 20 min at 4,000 g. the supernatant was then ultracentrifuged for 15 min at 82.000 g. a 3.4-kb region at the 3\u2032 end of the genome was amplified by RT-PCR. analysis of RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase (ORF1b) and Capsid Protein (ORF2) of Strain Nausika/08/ITA Pair-wise identity in the ORF1b and full-length capsid protein of strain Nausika/08/ITA was determined by using multiple alignments generated with Bioedit software package version 2.1 (24) the values were calculated by using amino acid sequence alignment without removing the gaps. a total of 23 pooled (2\u20135 animals) and single samples were used to calculate identities. full-length aa capsid sequence and partial (245-aa residues) RdRp at the at the C-terminus were used to calculate identities. EC/REC of various degrees of severity was described in the herds, with animals ranging in age from 35 to 55 days. samples were sent to the laboratories of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell\u2019Emilia Romagna, Brescia, Italy. occidia 4 Nuoro 1.0 108 Rotavirus +/- NA Catarral enteritis E. coli Coccidia 5 Brescia 9.7 107 Rotavirus +/- Coronavirus+ Age 51 d, enteric syndrome, high mortality Enterocolitis with swollen colon E. coli Negative 8 Padova 7.3 103 Rotavirus +++ NA Typhlitis and colitis, swollen tracts of the gut with fluid content E. coli (gut RNA was extracted by using the QIAamp viral RNA kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) samples from collection A were used for an initial screening with a broadly reactive primer pair targeted to the ORF1b region of AstV (13). sequences displayed the highest identity (69.0%\u201371.3% nt) to an AstV from a California sea lion (GenBank accession no. FJ890353), thus confirming AstV infection. usika/08/ITA was cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector (TOPO TA cloning, Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) the transcribed RNA was quantified and used to generate an RNA standard curve. the detection limit was 10 genomic equivalents (GEs)/50 L-reaction (cycle threshold = 42.67), corresponding to 3.6 102 GE/g of fecal sample. the supernatant was then ultracentrifuged for 20 min at 4,000 g. the supernatant was then ultracentrifuged for 15 min at 82.000 g. a 3.4-kb region at the 3\u2032 end of the genome was amplified. analysis of RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase (ORF1b) and Capsid Protein (ORF2) of Strain Nausika/08/ITA was determined by using multiple alignments generated with Bioedit software package version 2.1 (24) the values were calculated with the uncorrected distance method by using amino acid sequence alignment without removing the gaps. rabbit AstV was detected by RT-qPCR in 10 (43.49%) of 23 samples from collection A and 25 (17.98%) of 139 from collection B. Rabbit AstV was detected in 12 (80%) of the 15 rabbit herds sampled. GE/L RNA extract in collection A ranged from 2.0 101 to 3.8 107. in collection B from 1.2 101 to 1.7 106. positive rates differed significantly between groups A and B. identity to other mammalian AstVs ranged from 50.9% to 61.4% aa. identity to avian AstVs ranged from 31.0% to 37.5% aa. the highly conserved nt stretch upstream of ORF2 was nearly completely conserved. black circles indicate strain identified in this study. the trees were constructed by using a selection of astrovirus (AstV) strains. country names are abbreviated. titers of group A and B were compared by the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. EM Observation Upon EM observation, none of the samples contained SRV-like particles. AN5\u20138ATGNC was nearly completely conserved in the sequence of strain Nausika/08/ITA. it was encoded for a capsid protein of 852 aa, with a predicted molecular mass of 84.7 kDa. by pair-wise comparison, the highest identity (23.7%) was found to a canine AstV, strain Dog/Italy05 and to a bottlenose dolphin AstV. Rabbit EC/REC syndrome is a multiform enteric disease characterized by a variety of symptoms. the syndrome may be multifactorial with several microorganisms acting in synergy and with environmental factors also altering or influencing rabbit physiology, metabolism, and immune response. astV RNA was detected in 43.49% (10/23) of the samples tested. the mean titer in the AstV-positive samples from collection A was 4.3 106 GE/L RNA extract, corresponding to 1.5 109 GE/mL feces. the rate of detection of enteric viruses (noroviruses) in humans is significantly higher for symptomatic (37.2%) than asymptomatic patients (14.1%). increased viral load in the feces has been associated with greater severity of gastroenteric disease in children infected by group A rotavirus. the exact role of this sequence is not known, but it may be a regulatory element of the subgenomic RNA that encodes for ORF2. the highly conserved motif SRGHAE at the C-terminus of the capsid protein (27) was not found in strain Nausika/08/ITA."}
