{"summary": "doctors will have a pivotal role in a successful response to a pandemic. a commitment by physicians is needed to ensure that this role will be fulfilled despite the presence of an elevated level of personal risk arising from exposure to contagious influenza patients. the obligation to render treatment in the presence of increased risks needs to be justified as legitimate. the number of people needing hospitalization would rise to nearly 10 million. the number of people needing hospitalization would rise to nearly 10 million. the international experience of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak suggests worldwide public expectation is that doctors will respond by continuing to provide care in a pandemic even if this involves elevated risks. an era of successful antibiotic development, effective public health measures and the relatively long time gap since the last pandemic have resulted in a generation of physicians entering the profession with little thought about work-related risks and mortality. the issue of having to provide care for patients with contagious diseases for which there is limited treatment was put sharply back in focus during the early years of the HIV epidemic and during the 2003 SARS outbreak. a 1957-like moderate pandemic estimates 45 million people seeking outpatient care in the united states and 865,000 requiring hospitalization. the number of people needing hospitalization would rise to nearly 10 million, with about 1.5 million in an intensive care setting. if influenza does strike in pandemic proportions, this need is likely to be tremendous. free choice of the medical profession implies free choice of accepting occupational hazards. a generation of physicians entering the profession with little thought about work-related risks and mortality. contract with society bestows upon the medical profession prestige and guild-like powers. Intensivists, emergency physicians, anesthesiologists and pulmonologists would therefore be obligated to face higher risks than other specialists because their expertise will afford better protection to cope with these increased risks. the true level of risk in pandemic influenza is unknown. the estimated case fatality in the 1918 spanish flu pandemic was 2.5%, which is more than 20-fold higher than seasonal outbreaks. the nature of the risk spans more than personal morbidity and mortality, but also includes transmission to family members. the nature of the risk spans more than personal morbidity and mortality, but also includes transmission to loved ones. survey data suggest 24% of physicians find it acceptable to abandon their workplace during such a pandemic in order to protect themselves and their families. these risks must therefore be significantly mitigated and compensated for by societal and institutional support to ensure adequate turnout of the medical workforce. the degree of institutional preparedness for a potential pandemic is a strong predictor of individual healthcare professional preparedness. the ability to perform emergency medical procedures such as endotracheal intubation will also be hampered by the cumbersome nature of such protective equipment. the degree of institutional preparedness for a potential pandemic is a strong predictor of individual healthcare professional preparedness. the need for triage and resource allocation will inevitably strain the doctor\u2013patient relationship. the need for triage and resource allocation will inevitably appear more pressing than the obligations to the yet to be admitted patient waiting at the emergency department. SARS = severe acute respiratory syndrome. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
