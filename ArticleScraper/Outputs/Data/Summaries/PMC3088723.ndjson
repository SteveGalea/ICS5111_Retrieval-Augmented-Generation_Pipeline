{"summary": "gene variation is generated primarily by inaccurate replication of genomes due to mutation and recombination. this is particularly true for viruses, which are characterized by high mutation rates [1], [2] leading to populations appearing rapidly as mutant swarms. recombination can generate theoretically countless combinations of available mutations. the artificially-created recombinants were derived mostly from the exchange of specific, previously delimited, regions or genes suspected to be involved in known biological traits of the virus [9], [10], [11], [12], particularly when their genetic identity was below 90% [10], it was suggested that as with mutations, most recombination events create deleterious or even lethal genomic combinations. recombination events between two viral genomes diverging by more than 10% are mostly deleterious or a huge bank of viral recombinants was generated randomly in vitro. the results provide information on all recombinants, regardless of whether or not they resemble those found in natural populations. we selected model viruses whose genomes are small enough to be shuffled throughout their entire length using a random gene shuffling technique. recombinants infected their host plant and accumulated in systemically colonized leaves at a level equal or intermediate to that of the parents. the parental genomes, designated Tyx and Tox (2791 and 2765 nt in size respectively) exhibit 82% overall nucleotide identity. the two sequences differ at about 500 nucleotide positions distributed throughout the genome. a total of 47 randomly selected shuffled genomes were fully sequenced. only 1 nt position in one genome differed from both parents. none of the other recombinants encoded a non-parental nucleotide or amino acid. breakpoints were generated in all ORFs. 44 of the 47 recombinant genomes encode at least one hybrid protein. recombinants \u201c7\u201d and \u201c10\u201d encode 100% Tox proteins. recombinant \u201c55\u201d encodes 100% Tyx proteins. two recombinants were significantly less infectious than Tyx at 15 dpi. three were significantly less infectious at 22 dpi. recombinant 104 was the only clone for which no plant was positive for virus detection at 15 dpi. white boxes correspond to recombinants that are not significantly different from either parent. no recombinant had an infectivity significantly different from that of both parents. recombinants with a high proportion of genome derived from Tox accumulated within the infected plants at a low level similar to the accumulation of Tox. a good linear correlation was obtained between the average virus accumulation of each clone at 15 dpi and 22 dpi across the three experiments conducted at both time points. the logarithm of the Calibrated Normalized Relative Quantity (logNRQ) reflects virus accumulation. the blue box at the left end corresponds to the parental genome Tox. the distribution of the effect of recombination on infectivity was unimodal. the effect on the phenotype was assessed through infectivity (A) and virus accumulation (B), at 22 days post inoculation. the estimated effects correspond to the coefficients of the recombinant clones in the linear model. each circular genome is presented in linear form beginning with the cloning site XhoI. the 6 ORFs encoded by both parental genomes are presented above the aligned genomes. a total of 47 randomly selected shuffled genomes were fully sequenced. the majority (29) of these breakpoints were found only once, but several (18) were found in more than one recombinant (Figure S1B) the size of the fragments generated by L-DNA-shuffling ranged from a few nucleotides to 2450 nt; the exchange of some short fragments resulted in a single nucleotide change. all 47 recombinants were detected in systemically infected leaves in at least some of the inoculated test plants. the proportion of lethal recombinants lies between 0 and 0.062. recombinant 104 was the only clone for which no plant was positive for virus detection. infectivity was determined on plant samples collected at 15 (A) and 22 days (B) post-inoculation. infectivity was defined as the proportion of infected plants (virus detected in systemic leaves) of the total number of virus-inoculated plants. recombinants exhibiting the highest virus accumulation were most often the recombinants with a higher proportion of their genome derived from Tyx. a good linear correlation was obtained between the average virus accumulation of each clone at 15 dpi and 22 dpi across three experiments conducted at both time points. librated Normalized Relative Quantity (logNRQ) reflects virus accumulation. recombinant genomes are ordered from left to right by increasing nucleotide identity with Tyx genome. white boxes correspond to recombinants that are not significantly different from either parent, light red boxes to recombinants that are significantly less infectious than Tyx. the number of recombinants that differ significantly from Tyx and Tox are represented in light red and light blue, respectively. recombinant 104 was not detectable at 15 dpi. recombinant 104 was not detected at 15 dpi. recombinant 104 was not detected at 15 dpi. recombinant genomes detected in field populations or in artificially co-infected plants exhibit very specific recombination patterns, leading to the suggestion that other possible patterns were not fit enough to emerge [13], [15], [16]. recombinants with potential breakpoints in cold spots are maladapted and thus rarely or never isolated. gene folding [21], 53 of 54 generated breakpoints were within coding regions. 44 of the 47 recombinant genomes encode at least one hybrid protein. virus load comparisons in singly infected plants were insufficiently discriminative to distinguish small fitness differences. phenotype of non-directed homologous recombinants was tested [12]. 13 out of 15 recombinants exhibited additional changes inherent to the RT-PCR-technique with which they were produced. this hypothesis suggests that the relatively low accumulation of some recombinants resulted from a selective cost induced by host-specific mutations. the recombinant viral genome library generated here could be used in the future to test this prediction. data generated in this paper address fundamental questions regarding recombination. the probability of emergence of recombinants with altered phenotypes is now very high. both parental clones were originally cloned individually into pGEMT. a unique XhoI site was generated in both pGEMT clones. cloned parental genomes Tyx and Tox were released from pCambia0380 using two unique restriction sites. recombinant viral genomes were produced using the patented L-DNA-shuffling technology. it does not include any PCR amplification step that could induce additional mutations in the generated recombinants. the technology has been used successfully to shuffle long genes with high or low nucleotide identity. plasmid pCambia0380 plasmids containing the recombinant genomes were purified from E. coli and introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 MP90 by electroporation. a total of 48 recombinant genomes had to be sequenced because two of them were identical. plants were irrigated with 151030 NPK+ oligoelements. in the same growth chamber, 47 recombinant clones, the two parental clones Tyx and Tox, and a clone containing an empty pCambia0380 plasmid were inoculated on the same day. the whole experiment was repeated four times, each repeat representing an independent test. total DNA from each leaf disk was extracted with the QuickExtract kit from Epicentre Biotechnologies (Madison, WI, USA) the amplification reactions were run in 384-well optical plates in the LightCycler 480 (Roche) inter-plate calibrator was prepared from a single extraction of a Tyx-infected plant. the highly concentrated extract was split into multiple aliquots conserved at 20\u00b0C. each aliquot being used for one qPCR run only. corresponding generalized linear model (GLM) indicated that both the experiment and the clone had a very significant effect at 15 dpi. the model residuals did not show any pathological behavior. parental viruses are members of the genus Begomovirus, family Geminiviridae. one of the parental genomes, the \"Mild\" strain of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus, was isolated from tomato plants. the other parental genome, Tomato leaf curl mayotte virus, was isolated from tomato plants. the two parental genomes Tyx and Tox were released from pCambia0380 using two unique restriction sites (SacII and BglII) recombinant viral genomes were produced using the patented technology. the technology has been used successfully to shuffle long genes with high or low nucleotide identity. long and short incubations were mixed before proceeding to steps (ii), (iii) and (iv) the endonuclease products of the long and short incubations were mixed before proceeding to steps (ii), (iii) and (iv) a sample of the final shuffled products was digested with SacII and BglII (NEB) tomato plants of the susceptible cultivar Monalbo (INRA) were grown in containment growth chambers under 14 h light at 26\u00b0C, and 10 h dark at 24\u00b0C. seeds were initially grown in batches and were transplanted to individual pots after 7 days. in the same growth chamber, 47 recombinant clones, the two parental clones Tyx and Tox, and a clone containing an empty pCambia0380 a relevant and reliable estimation of the accumulation of both Tyx and Tox within each plant could be obtained. from each infected plant, we collected a 5 mm-diameter leaf disk from the youngest leaf for which five leaflets were visible. total DNA from each leaf disk was extracted with the QuickExtract kit. et al. (2009) assesses PCR efficiency in each well. a plant was defined as infected when its log(CNRQ) value was above the 95%-quantile of the distribution of log(CNRQ) values corresponding to 92 samples from mock-inoculated plants. the cloneexperiment interaction was not included because it would have resulted in an overparameterized model. the cloneexperiment interaction was not included because it would have resulted in an overparameterized model. the model residuals did not show any pathological behavior. z-tests for the GLM, t-test for the LM, followed by the Holm multiple-testing correction. all statistical analyses were performed using R version 2.8.1 [39]. positions of the 6 ORFs encoded by the parental genomes are indicated below the graph. the red and blue horizontal arrows represent recombination hot and cold spots, respectively. the red and blue numbers indicate the number of distinct breakpoints that were detected within these regions in the 47 randomly selected recombinants. sequences to create a common stem loop and a cloning site are indicated. the stars indicate the origin of the rolling circle replication of the viral genomes."}
