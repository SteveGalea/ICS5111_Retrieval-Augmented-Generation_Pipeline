{"summary": "the largest RNA genomes known to date (1, 2). Coronaviruses (CoVs)9 are respiratory and enteric pathogens of humans and domesticated animals. all endemic human CoVs are thought to have been transmitted from animal hosts at some point in the past. pp1a and pp1ab precursors yield two large polyprotein (pp) precursors. the latter is derived from extension of pp1a with the ORF1b-encoded sequence after a 1 ribosomal frameshift near the 3\u2032 end of ORF1a. the replicase polyproteins are cleaved into a total of 16 functional proteins. the coV genome encodes proteins required for the formation and modification of the cap structure present at the 5\u2032 end of all coronaviral mRNAs. in eukaryotic cells most mRNAs of invading viruses and the host itself are modified by the addition of such a cap. the cap protects from degradation by 5\u2032-3\u2032 exoribonucleases, ensures efficient translation, and in the case of viral mRNAs helps to prevent recognition by the host innate immune positive-stranded RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm and are presumed not to have access to the host cell capping machinery. nsp10-nsp16 complex exhibits a potent MTase activity specifically converting cap-0 (7MeGpppN) into cap-1 structures (34). nsp10, nsp14, and nsp16 were implicated in the formation of the CoV replication-transcription complex (39), a process likely based on a large repertoire of specific interactions of nsps with other nsps and with viral RNA sequences. nsp10-nsp16 interaction was characterized biochemically and structurally to decipher the molecular basis of nsp10 function in activating the nsp10-nsp14 ExoN activity was shown to degrade double-stranded (ds) RNAs with a preference for substrates carrying a single non-hybridized nucleotide at their 3\u2032 end. nsp10 does not show any effect on nsp14 (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase activity in vitro. plasmid constructions are described in Lugari et al.

SSION SARS-CoV nsp14 activity was recently shown to be strongly stimulated by the presence of its interaction partner nsp10 (47) this feature is likely to be highly relevant for the unique RNA proofreading mechanism that is thought to allow coronaviruses to reliably replicate their long RNA genome (60). nsp10 residues involved in the interaction with nsp14 are conserved across all four genera of the Coronaviridae subfamily (41) nsp10-nsp14 and nsp16 complexes may coexist, possibly as part of larger nsp assemblies engaged in different steps of viral RNA synthesis. nsp10 levels in infected cells are substantially higher than those of nsp14 and nsp16. one nsp10 residue, Tyr-96, plays a crucial role in the nsp10-nsp16 interaction and in the activation of the nsp16 2\u2032-O-MTase activity. the aromatic nature of Tyr-96 plays a crucial role in the nsp10-nsp16 interaction. nsp10 Y96F mutation interferes with nsp14 binding and decreases ExoN activity in vitro. this may explain why a tyrosine residue has been selected in the course of SARS-CoV evolution. phenotype of the nsp10 Y96F mutant virus was found to be similar to that of the wild-type virus. the non-viable phenotype of several SARS-CoV nsp10 mutants in the present study could be attributed to critically influencing one or more of these as yet poorly defined additional nsp10 functions. many of the nsp10 residues found to affect the nsp10-nsp14 interaction and viral replication correspond to residues that localize within the core of nsp10. p10 core can be targeted to disrupt nsp10-nsp14 interactions and inhibit nsp14 ExoN activity. residues are highly conserved across coronaviruses, including the recently emerged and potentially life-threatening MERS-CoV."}
