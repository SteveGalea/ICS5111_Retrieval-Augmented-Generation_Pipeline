{"summary": "TTF-1 is a tissue-specific homeodomain transcription factor expressed only in lung, bronchi, thyroid grand and forebrain. NKX2-1 regulates expression of genes that encode surfactant proteins. TTF-1 is thus thought to be the master regulator of lung epithelial differentiation1. transforming growth factor- (TGF-) is a multifunctional cytokine with bidirectional roles in cancer progression15,16. TGF- binds to type II and type I receptors, resulting in phosphorylation of the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads): Smad2 and Smad3 bind directly to chromatin. TTF-1 regulates TGF--Smad signaling by competing with Smad4. TTF-1 regulates expression of certain genes in a Smad4-independent manner. TTF-1 disrupts the complex formation of Smad3 with or without TGF- stimulation. TTF-1 interacts with Smad3 independently of TGF- and inhibits Smad3-Smad4-induced transcription of target genes. at 24 h post-infection, cells were treated with TGF- for 1.5 h. nucleic and cytoplasmic fractions of the cells were obtained 2 h after TGF- stimulation. a ChIP assay was performed to analyze the binding of Smad3 to the PAI-1 and SMAD7 promoter regions. a549 cells were transfected with the TTF-1-expression vector or control vector and treated with TGF- for 12 h or SB431542 for 12 h. we then performed in situ PLA assays using H441 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. TTF-1 inhibits binding of Smad3 to chromatin TTF-1. it is possible that Smad3 is present in the nucleus but fails to bind to target genomic regions in presence of TTF-1. we performed qPCR analysis using a Smad3-specific antibody. RNA for TTF-1 (siTTF-1) or control siRNA (siControl) stimulated the cells with TGF-. the same sample set also yielded 21 292 and 31 083 TTF-1-binding peaks. the enrichment of Smad3 in the PAI-1 promoter region was validated. the number of Smad3-, Smad4- and TTF-1-binding regions in H441 cells obtained from ChIP-seq analyses. blue circle represents Smad4-binding regions in siControl- and siTTF-1-transfected H441 cells treated with TGF- (FDR = 0.1) blue circle represents the Smad4-binding regions as shown in A-ii. peaks f and g indicate Smad3-TTF-1 common regions. cells were stimulated with TGF- for 1.5 h and fixed. eluted after anti-Smad3 ChIP followed by secondary ChIP as indicated. 80% (7 201/8 941) of the Smad3-binding peaks in H441 cells treated with siControl were also observed in cells treated with siTTF-1. more than 85% (7 839/8 941) of the Smad3-binding peaks were common to the TTF-1-binding peaks. more than 80% of the top 2 000 binding peaks have TTF-1-binding regions within 200 bps of their binding summits. TTF-1 binds to only 8% of the bottom 2 011 peaks (Figure 2C) the inhibitory effect of TTF-1 on Smad3 does not appear to be induced by competition in chromatin binding. compared with cells treated with siControl, read counts increased more than two-fold in siTTF-1-treated cells. we compared binding strengths of Smad3 and Smad4 in each Smad3-binding peak. binding strength of Smad4 may be weaker in presence of TTF-1 than in its absence. chromatin regions represent Smad3-TTF-1 common regions or Smad3-only regions. TTF-1 suppresses expression of EMT-related genes and regulates that of apoptosis-related genes. knockdown efficiency of TTF-1 by siRNA was confirmed. expression microarray data of H441 cells transfected with siControl or siTTF-1 were evaluated by comparing the enriched gene ontology clusters obtained by DAVID. if a Smad complex binds to multiple sites in the promoter, interaction between multiple binding sites can be detected. some of the Smad3-binding peaks around these genes represented Smad3-only regions. some of the binding strengths of Smad3 were strongly affected by TTF-1 expression. we also analyzed TTF-1-regulated genes in the absence of TGF-. probes and primers were designed in two target gene regions, PAI-1 and ITGA5. one of the Smad3-binding sites is common to TTF-1 where Smad3 can bind to chromatin regardless of TTF-1 expression. the other is Smad3-only region(s) where Smad3-binding strength is weak in presence of endogenous TTF-1. regulated by TGF- signaling, we performed ChIP-qPCR analysis at these loci in the presence of TGF- or the TGF- type I receptor inhibitor SB431542. knockdown of Smad4 did not attenuate binding to these loci, suggesting that Smad3 binds to these loci independently of Smad4. H441 cells were treated with control or Smad4 siRNAs for 48 h without TGF- stimulation. RT-PCR analyses were performed using primers specific for LMO3, SDPR or FBP1. regions were observed at STRL in H441 cells which express TTF-1. only 1% of them were observed at STRL in A549 cells treated with TGF-1. read counts of Smad3 were obtained at the STRL in A549 cells treated with TGF-. TGF- stimulation and formation of the Smad3 and Smad4 complex induced by TGF- was strongly inhibited by TTF-1 overexpression. pSmad3 was detected in the nucleus upon TGF- stimulation. TTF-1 overexpression did not suppress either phosphorylation of Smad3 or nuclear translocation of Smad4. -1) (C) and H441 cells transfected with control siRNA (siControl) or TTF-1 siRNA (siTTF-1) (D) were treated with TGF- for 1.5 h. the Smad3-Smad4 complex was detected using anti-Smad3 and anti-Smad4 antibodies. the nuclear complex containing Smad2 and Smad4 disappeared in the presence of TTF-1. most of the nuclear complex was decreased by TTF-1 overexpression. we then performed in situ PLA assays using H441 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. r activity of PAI-1-luc induced by TGF- but did not affect that of 9 CAGA-luc. treatment with the TGF- type I receptor inhibitor SB431542 effectively reduced TGF-induced activation of both reporters. findings suggest certain cis-regulatory element(s) other than the canonical SBE might be required for TTF-1 to inhibit Smad-induced transcription. we performed de novo motif prediction in the TTF-1 ChIP-seq data using the CisGenome Gibbs motif sampler. one of the obtained motifs was very similar to the TTF-1-binding motif reported by others14. the read count ratio of each binding region was obtained by calculating the normalized read counts of siControl/siTTF-1. the frequency of Smad3-binding sites common to TTF-1 was calculated in two groups: the top 2 000 and bottom 2 011 regions with high and low siControl/siTTF-1 ratios. read counts of Smad3 and Smad4 were compared in each region. 80% (7 201/8 941) of the Smad3-binding peaks were also observed in cells treated with siTTF-1. 80% of the top 2 000 and bottom 2 011 peaks have TTF-1-binding regions within 200 bps of their binding summits. TTF-1 binds to only 8% of the bottom 2 011 peaks. anti-Smad4 ChIP-qPCR at peak e in Figure 2D. binding strength increased when TTF-1 was knocked down. read counts in most of the Smad3-TTF-1 common regions did not increase more than two-fold in siControl- and siTTF-1-treated cells. the read count ratios of Smad4/Smad3 decreased in peaks where TTF-1 strongly bound to chromatin together with Smad3 in H441 cells treated with siControl. however, there is no correlation between TTF-1-binding strengths and Smad3 read count ratios observed in siTTF-1-treated cells. TTF-1 suppresses expression of EMT-related genes and regulates that of apoptosis-related genes. genes expressed in H441 cells and induced by TGF- stimulation are selected and arranged with respect to siTTF-1/siControl ratios. effect of knockdown of TTF-1 on TGF-induced changes in gene expression was evaluated by comparing the enriched gene ontology clusters obtained by DAVID. we chose genes whose expression levels were increased upon TGF- stimulation in cells transfected with siControl or siTTF-1 without TGF- stimulation. knockdown of TTF-1 increased expression of many genes, including cell migration- and locomotion-related genes. one Smad complex may bind to multiple sites through the MH1 domains of Smad3 and Smad4 or indirectly through other proteins. if each Smad complex can bind to only one SBE, such interactions cannot be observed. we designed probes and primers in two target gene regions. these Smad3-binding peaks were common to TTF-1 binding. we identified the genes nearest to these loci, and compared their expression in the presence and absence of TGF-. expression levels were reduced by more than half after 24 h of TGF- stimulation. expression levels of those genes in A549 cells were comparable to those in H441 cells treated with TGF- for 24 h. binding of TTF-1-Smad3 complex to these target regions is important for regulating expression of these genes in H441 cells. read counts of Smad3 at the STRL of H441 cells were obtained. comparison was made in each region between a549 cells and siControl. compared binding regions of Smad3 with those in H441 cells treated with siControl. TTF-1 inhibits both Smad3 and Smad4 binding to chromatin, but in different ways.

TTF-1 regulates transcription of certain target genes, including PAI-1 and ITGA5, leading to induction of EMT. TTF-1 regulates specific genes in alveolar epithelial cells, while TGF- induces EMT. the balance between TTF-1 expression and TGF- signaling may be very important for differentiation of lung epithelial cells. expression levels of other genes that are known to be involved in EMT are regulated by TGF- and TTF-1. integrin 5 (encoded by ITGA5) interacts with the extracellular matrix and enhances cell migration36. some genes shown in Supplementary information, Table S7, have been reported to promote EMT in some carcinomas37,38. ectopic expression of TTF-1 inhibited expression of cell motion-related genes induced by TGF-. but did not enhance that of pro-survival-related genes, including LMO3. cell growth assay revealed that TTF-1 inhibits proliferation of A549 cells.

TTF-1, a lung epithelial-specific transcription factor, co-occupies with Smad3 on chromatin. these tissue-specific factors seem not only to enable Smad3 to bind to specific regions, but also to inhibit Smad3 binding to certain regions. understanding the underlying regulatory mechanisms may help to elucidate the differences in progression and therapeutic response of cancers.
