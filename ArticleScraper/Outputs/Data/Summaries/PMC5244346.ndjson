{"summary": "norovirus and Sapovirus in the family Caliciviridae cause 200,000 deaths per annum in children 5 years of age (2, 3). despite their socioeconomic impact, the fastidious nature of viruses within these genera has significantly hindered our understanding of their life cycles and the development of vaccines and therapeutics (4, 5). COX-1 is constitutively expressed and is known to synthesize various PGs, including PGE2, that participate in a diverse range of normal physiological processes. in contrast, COX-2 is rapidly induced by various stimuli, including viral infection, and catalyzes the synthesis of various PGs. RESULTS PSaV infection induces COX expression and leads to the production of PGE2. COX-2 mRNA and protein levels were markedly elevated at 24 and 36 h postinfection (hpi), concomitant with the increase in PSaV viral RNA and protein levels. the level of PGE2 in the infected cell culture supernatant was also significantly elevated from 12 hpi. expression levels were normalized to -actin compared with that of the mock-inoculated cells. all the studies were performed at doses of inhibitors shown not to affect cell viability under the experimental conditions used. the nonselective COX-1/2 inhibitor indomethacin and the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 both inhibited PSaV-mediated PGE2 production in a dose-dependent manner. similar results were obtained with a range of other COX inhibitors. confluent LLC-PK cells were transfected with siRNAs against COX-1, COX-2, or scrambled siRNA (Scram-siRNA) prior to infection with PSaV. the levels of PGE2 in the supernatants were compared between mock- and siRNA-transfected groups. cells were either treated with inhibitors (selective or nonselective) or transfected with siRNAs specific for COX-1 or COX-2. there was no significant effect of COX inhibitors on PSaV replication when cells were pretreated but the inhibitors were removed prior to infection (pretreatment) however, the inclusion of COX inhibitors following the removal of the virus inoculum (posttreatment) or during the entire course of infection (pre/posttreatment) resulted in LLC-PK cells were transfected with siRNAs against COX-1, COX-2, or scrambled siRNA before inoculation with PSaV. samples were harvested at 36 hpi, and levels of viral RNA (I and K) and the titer (J and L) were determined by quantitative real-time PCR and TCID50. the effects of COX-2-specific siRNAs on PSaV replication were also examined. transfection of COX-2-specific siRNAs had a more substantial effect on PSaV replication than that of COX-1 siRNAs. either treatment of cells with NS-398 or transfection with COX-2-specific siRNAs resulted in a significant decrease in the number PSaV antigen-positive cells. PK cells were infected with PSaV (MOI = 1 FFU/cell) after 36 h postinfection, cells were harvested. levels of viral RNA synthesis (A and C) and the titer (B and D) were determined by quantitative real-time PCR and TCID50. COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 reduced expression of COX-2 and PGE2 and replication of PSaV. bile acid GCDCA does not influence expression of COX-2 during PSaV infection. infected cells were harvested at 36 h postinfection. transfected cells were harvested after 6 days posttransfection. hemagglutinin (HA) tag fused to the N terminus of each protein. western blotting and quantitative-PCR (qPCR) analysis of the levels of COX-1 and COX-2 demonstrated that VPg or ProPol expression significantly enhanced the expression of COX-2 and led to an increase in PGE2 production. NO is a key molecule involved in the host defense mechanism against various pathogens, including protozoans, parasites, fungi, bacteria, and viruses (19). to determine if the PGE2 produced during PSaV replication impacted NO production, we first examined the level of NO produced during PSaV replication. NS-398 on NO production during PSaV replication was also examined. inhibition of COX-2 activity was found to lead to a concomitant increase in NO production during PSaV replication. reversal of the effect of COX-2 inhibition by L-NAME also resulted in the subsequent restoration of PSaV infectivity levels. expression levels were normalized to -actin and are depicted as the fold induction compared with that of the mock-inoculated cells. the levels of PGE2 in the supernatants harvested at 36 hpi from PSaV-infected LLC-PK cells were determined by ELISA. LLC-PK cells were treated with selective COX-2 inhibitors (NS398 and celecoxib), a nonselective COX inhibitor (indomethacin) and a selective COX-1 inhibitor (SC-560) the levels of PGE2 in the supernatants harvested at 36 hpi were determined by ELISA. the levels of PGE2 in the supernatants of virus-infected cultures were compared between the mock- and chemical-treated groups COX-1- or COX-2-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were also examined. the effects of COX-1- or COX-2-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were also examined. in contrast, the COX-2-specific inhibitors NS-398 and celecoxib showed more significant effects, typically leading to an 1,000-fold decrease in virus yield and RNA synthesis. other COX-2-specific inhibitors (SC-58125, SC-236, and nimesulide) were also tested. however, less robust inhibition of PSaV replication was observed. LLC-PK cells were pretreated (Pre), posttreated (Post) or pre/posttreated (Pre-Post) with noncytotoxic doses of NS-398, indomethacin, celecoxib, and SC560. at 36 hpi with PSaV (MOI = 1 FFU/cell), cells were harvested and the levels of viral VPg were determined by Western blot analyses. supplementation of PGE2 relieves COX inhibition of PSaV replication. if the proviral effect of COX gene induction was due solely to the production of increased PGE2, then the addition of PGE2 would be expected to reverse the inhibitory effect of COX inhibitors on PSaV replication. odeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) does not influence the expression of COX-2 during PSaV infection. infected cells were harvested at 36 h postinfection. bile acids function to promote virus uncoating (16) ected cells were harvested after 6 days posttransfection and subjected to Western blot analysis to assess viral protein production (A), as well as to qPCR for viral RNA (B) and COX-2 (C). supernatants were also collected for ELISA to quantify levels of PGE2. the levels of PGE2 in the supernatants were compared between vehicle- and PSaV gene-transfected groups. the data are presented as means and standard errors of the mean from three independent experiments. LLC-PK cells were infected with PSaV (MOI = 1 FFU/cell) and subsequently treated with the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 or the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME. the effect of inhibitor treatment on nitric oxide production was then determined as described for panel A. host inflammatory responses are induced, leading to the production of cellular effectors and soluble factors, such as IFNs, PGE2 and NO (21, 22). pathogens have evolved a wide variety of mechanisms that enable the control of cellular pathways, evade the host immune response, and hijack signaling pathways to facilitate viral replication and pathogenesis. rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4) (28\u201330) may cause diarrhea by elevating intestinal permeability (31, 32) and regulating intestinal motility (33) and intestinal ion transport (34, 35) little NO production was observed during PSaV replication in LLC-PK cells, possibly due to the synthesis of PGE2. in the present study, the levels of COX-1-specific, COX-2-specific, and nonselective COX-1/2 inhibitors were increased in response to PSaV infection. we evaluated the effects of COX-1-specific, COX-2-specific, and nonselective COX-1/2 inhibitors on PSaV replication. pharmacological targeting of COX-2 could provide a potential targeting strategy for the control of sapovirus infection. further studies are required to determine if targeting the COX/PGE2 pathway in vivo has a negative impact on PSaV pathogenesis. the anti-PSaV capsid MAb and the anti-PSaV VPg polyclonal antibody were previously described (41) the secondary antibodies used were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat immunoglobulin against rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA) and mouse IgG (Santa Cruz) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat immunoglobulin against rabbit IgG ( LLC-PK cells were pretreated with different concentrations of the inhibitors for 24 h. the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and inoculated with PSaV. each amplicon was purified with PuriGel (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) cells were harvested at different posttransfection points and subjected to quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis using the anti-HA antibody. cells were subjected to quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis using the antibody. 855 R ttt gctagc TCA CTC GCT AAG CGT GTT TTC 2811\u20132794 VPg pUNO-HA-VPg F ac gtcgac atg TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCT GCG AAA AAC AAA CGC GGA CGT 2812\u20132838 338 R gctagc TCA CTC ACT GTC ATA GGT GTC capped in vitro transcripts were derived from the full-length PSaV cDNA clone pCV4A (44) with the mMessage mMachine kit. capped in vitro transcripts were derived from the full-length PSaV cDNA clone pCV4A (44) with the mMessage mMachine kit.
