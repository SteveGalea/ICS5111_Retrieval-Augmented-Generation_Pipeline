{"summary": "influenza A viruses are enveloped, single-, negative-stranded and segmented RNA viruses belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family. all 16 known hemagglutinin (HA) and 9 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes of influenza A viruses have been isolated from wild waterfowl and seabirds. prevailing scientific view regarding a possible H5N1 epidemic is that sustained human-to-human transmission will occur at some unknown future date. avian influenza virus transmitted via pigs poses significant risk to cause a new influenza pandemic, possibly on the disturbing scale of the human influenza pandemic experienced during 1918-1920. the changing role of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 subtype in both wild and domestic ducks has recently been documented as a potential public health hazard. commercial poultry farms, backyard poultry farms, commercial and family poultry slaughtering facilities, swine farms, human dietary habits and the global trade in exotic animals have all been implicated in the spread of influenza A viruses. an avian influenza virus transmitted via pigs poses a significant risk to cause a new influenza pandemic, possibly on the disturbing scale of the human influenza pandemic experienced during 1918-1920 (H1N1 \u201cSpanish Flu\u201d). this review will conclude that an avian influenza virus transmitted via pigs to humans poses a significant risk to cause a new influenza pandemic. there is reasonable evidence suggesting that influenza A viruses are not becoming less virulent, nor has modern medicine been able to prevent either the beginning of a pandemic or its immediate spread. the recent development of prepandemic influenza vaccines for the vaccination of individuals and communities is encouraging. 90% of human cases with confirmed H5N1 HPAIV infection have been in only five countries: Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt, Thailand and China. human-to-human transmissions of HPAIV H5N1 have been found within individual families in Thailand, Indonesia and most probably China. the epidemic situation in these countries has come close to a Phase 4 Pandemic Alert. the WHO has not raised the alert level. the presently observed 63% mortality rate for H5N1 HPAIV in humans (as estimated by WHO-confirmed cases) is not substantiated. avian influenza infections of commercial poultry already represent the largest incidence of an animal disease ever recorded. the major attention has focused on the capacity of H5N1 HPAIVs to infect and kill humans. the major attention has focused on the capacity of H5N1 HPAIVs to infect and kill humans. the crucial issue is whether a human influenza virus and an avian or animal virus might reassort to create a novel reassortant virus with the capability of sustained human-to-human transmission. reassortment between human and avian influenza viruses can occur when these viruses co-infect an individual pig. the double (avian/human; human/swine) and triple (human/avian/swine) reassortant influenza A viruses isolated from pigs in the united states or China provide supportive evidence for the \u201cmixing vessel\u201d theory. et al (2006) acknowledge that phylogenetic analysis alone is not sufficient to answer the question of the origin of the 1918 virus. they believe that adaptation of the virus occurred within a human source. the viruses that caused the 1957 Asian and 1968 Hong Kong influenza pandemics are reassortant viruses of human and avian origin viruses. pigs have been shown to transmit reassortant influenza viruses to humans. wild aquatic birds are the natural reservoirs for influenza A virus subtypes. pigs are postulated as the intermediate host for influenza A viruses. an H1N1 AIV that was first detected in european swine in 1979 is still circulating in European swine populations. a different H1N1 AIV was found to have been transmitted to pigs in china in 1993. swine can serve as direct and intermediate hosts for many subtypes of AIVs. human-like H3N2 viruses have been found in pigs from southern china. serological surveillance suggests that the prevailing human H1N1 viruses are readily transmitted to pigs. pig-to-pig transmission of human H1N1 viruses has been demonstrated. genes (HA and NA) and avian genes (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M and NS) have emerged in pigs in china. genetic reassortment allows for the generation of novel influenza viruses. pigs can serve as intermediate hosts and therefore as \u201cmixing vessels\u201d for influenza A viruses. triple reassortant H3N2 viruses isolated from pigs in Minnesota, Iowa and Texas contained gene segments from the classical swine virus (NS, NP and M), a recent human virus (HA, NA and PB1) and an avian virus (PB2 and PA) the triple reassortant H3N2 viruses evolved through genetic drift and reassorted with classical H1N1 swine viruses to produce novel reassortants. triple reassortant H2N3 influenza viruses with leucine at position 226 and glycine at position 228 of HA were isolated in 2006 from pigs in Missouri. if able to transmit to humans, H2 influenza viruses would pose a substantial risk because they have been absent from mammalian species since 1968. human swine influenza virus infections without direct swine contact are possible. most patients (61%) with zoonotic swine influenza infections reported recent exposure to pigs. farmers, meat processing workers and veterinarians were found to have significantly elevated serologic titers against pigs. there is no direct evidence that reassortment events leading to previous pandemic viruses occurred in pigs. reassortment of avian, human and swine viruses in the pig and subsequent molecular adaptation of the reassortant swine influenza viruses have been described. there is no direct evidence that reassortment events leading to previous pandemic viruses occurred in pigs. the writing committee of the second WHO Consultation on Clinical Aspects of Human Infection with H5N1 AIV (2008) acknowledged that H5N1 viruses are entrenched among poultry in parts of Asia, Africa, and perhaps the Middle East. authors: the exact mode and sites of influenza A (H5N1) virus acquisition in the human respiratory tract [of humans] are incompletely understood. pigs can generate novel influenza viruses capable of infecting humans. a southeast Asian \u201cwet market\u201d is most likely to be the locale in which the next pandemic virus is generated. pigs have been experimentally isolated with the H1-H13 subtypes of AIVs. swine can serve as direct and intermediate hosts for many subtypes of AIVs. domestic pigs show only low susceptibility to H5N1 HPAIV. human-like H3N2 viruses have been discovered in swine populations. pig genetic reassortment among avian, human and/or swine viruses has been documented in pigs. double reassortant H3N2 viruses containing human genes (HA and NA) and avian genes (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M and NS) have emerged in pigs in china. double (human/swine, subtype H3N2) and triple (avian/swine/ human, subtypes H3N2, H1N2, H1N1 and H3N1) reassortant swine influenza viruses have emerged in the united states and Canada. triple but not double reassortant swine influenza viruses have spread widely within swine across the US and Canadian swine herds. triple reassortant H3N2 viruses evolved through genetic drift and reassorted with classical H1N1 swine viruses. the triple reassortant H3N2, H1N2 and H3N1 viruses are the predominant subtypes circulating in the US swine population. the double reassortant H3N2 viruses did not spread efficiently among swine. human swine influenza viruses have been absent from mammalian species since 1968. people born after 1968 have little pre-existing immunity to the subtype. the transmission of swine influenza viruses to humans has been well documented. farmers, meat processing workers and veterinarians were found to have significantly elevated serologic titers against H1N1 and H1N2 swine influenza viruses compared to control subjects. the transmission of influenza viruses from swine to humans is not a rare event. the transmission of influenza viruses from swine to humans is not a rare event. reassortment of avian, human and swine viruses in the pig and subsequent molecular adaptation of the reassortant swine influenza viruses have been described. some scientists suggest that the danger of sudden appearance of a wholly avian influenza virus with pandemic potential is most likely overestimated. pigs are a \u201cmixing vessel\u201d and pose a high probability of being the source of a pandemic. pigs are a \u201cmixing vessel\u201d and pose a high probability of being the source of a pandemic. influenza is and will continue to be a serious threat to the health of many species including humans. pigs can generate novel influenza viruses capable of infecting humans. a southeast Asian \u201cwet market\u201d is most likely to be the locale in which the next pandemic virus is generated. recent events resulting in the establishment and isolation of a reassorted, mammalian-adapted H2N3 viruses from pigs in the us should remind scientists, medical doctors, veterinarians and farmers that the creation of novel swine influenza viruses with zoonotic and pandemic potential could"}
