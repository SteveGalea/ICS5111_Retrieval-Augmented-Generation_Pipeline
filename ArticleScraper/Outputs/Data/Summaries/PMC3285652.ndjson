{"summary": "the use of traditional nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for detection of HIV-1 DNA or RNA has been restricted to laboratory settings due to time, equipment, and technical expertise requirements. the availability of a rapid NAAT with applicability for resource-limited or point-of-care settings would fill a great need in HIV diagnostics. as 35 to 50% of individuals with an initial positive test result will not return for a confirmatory diagnosis if follow-up laboratory testing is required. rapid HIV antibody-based tests are currently a key component of HIV screening at the point-of-care (POC), significantly expanding the diagnostic capabilities of testing sites in developed countries, as well as resource-limited settings. a rapid NAAT that can be performed with minimal training, limited equipment, and a relatively short turnaround time (1 hour) is the only FDA-approved NAAT for the diagnosis or confirmation of HIV-1 infection. the development of a rapid NAAT has proven to be especially challenging since the technology involved in simplifying the test procedure often equates to increased equipment and material costs. the RT-LAMP assay was evaluated using portable, non-instrumented nucleic acid amplification devices that generate heat from the exothermic reaction of calcium oxide and water. the heating devices were designed using thermally insulated, stainless-steel canisters with plastic screw-top lids. the lids were modified to contain three sample wells that fit standard 200 l PCR tubes. linearity panels and clinical specimens DNA and RNA linearity panels were prepared to determine the sensitivity of the HIV-specific RT-LAMP assay. an RNA linearity panel was obtained commercially (PRD801; SeraCare Life Sciences, Milford, MA) positive samples were confirmed using the following tests: genetic systems HIV-1/HIV-2 plus O EIA (Bio-Rad Laboratories), GS HIV-1 Western blot (Bio-Rad Laboratories), Aptima HIV-1 RNA assay (Gen-Probe, Inc., San Diego, CA) and Amplicor HIV-1 DNA assay (Roche Diagnostics, Branchburg, NJ) the samples were tested with qualitative, nucleic acid-based assays. the quencher probe consisted of the complementary sequence of the loopF primer with black Hole Quencher-1 (BHQ-1) added to the 3\u2032 end. the HIV-1 RT-specific primers and quencher are listed in Table 1. whole blood was added directly into the reaction at a total volume of 40 l. the reaction mixture was incubated at 60\u00b0C for 60 minutes. an additional two minute heating step of 80\u00b0C was added to terminate the reaction. all reactions were carried out in a temperature-controlled laboratory with an ambient temperature of 28\u00b0C. after each amplification cycle, the samples were incubated for two minutes in a heat block set to 80\u00b0C. after each amplification cycle, the temperature profile of each device was analyzed. linearity panels and clinical specimens DNA and RNA linearity panels were prepared to determine the sensitivity of the HIV-specific RT-LAMP assay. an RNA linearity panel was obtained commercially (PRD801; SeraCare Life Sciences, Milford, MA) all HIV-positive samples were confirmed using the following tests: genetic systems HIV-1/HIV-2 plus O EIA (Bio-Rad Laboratories), GS HIV-1 Western blot (Bio-Rad Laboratories), Aptima HIV-1 RNA assay (Gen-Probe, Inc., San Diego, CA) and Amplicor HIV-1 DNA assay (Roche Diagnostics, Branchburg, NJ. the quencher probe consisted of the complementary sequence of the LoopF primer with black Hole Quencher-1 (BHQ-1) added to the 3\u2032 end. the sequences of the HIV-1 RT-specific primers and quencher are listed in Table 1. a 100 l reaction volume was used to facilitate visual detection of amplified products. whole blood was added directly into the reaction at a total volume of 40 l. the reaction mixture was incubated at 60\u00b0C for 60 minutes. the temperature profile of each device was analyzed by placing the canisters in a refrigerator set to 4\u00b0C or a 37\u00b0C incubator during the length of the amplification reaction. the temperature profiles were recorded and compared to those of reactions that occurred at the laboratory room temperature of 28\u00b0C.

During the 60 minute incubation, the average temperature for each device was 60.2, 59.8, and 59.7. 28\u00b0C* 4\u00b0C 37\u00b0C 1 2 3 1 2 3 Mean 60.2 59.7 59.7 58.3 58.1 58.0 59.8 59.6 59.3 SD 0.4 0.5 0.4 1.0 0.7 1.0 0.7 0.5 0.4 Median 60.3 59.7 59.7 58.8 58.4 58.4 60.0 59.7 59.5 Minimum 58.4 56.9 57.1 55.1 55.9 individuals were added directly into the RT-LAMP reaction and tested in the NINA heaters. amplification consistency was most evident with two of the patient samples that were only positive in one of the three replicates. all HIV-negative blood samples, included in each reaction, were negative. the temperature of the sample wells remains relatively stable at the desired reaction temperature of 60\u00b0C throughout the amplification reaction. the temperature profiles at a representative cold temperature of 4\u00b0C indicated a loss in reaction temperature towards the end of the 60 minute incubation. however, the temperature fluctuations were not significant enough to affect the amplification reaction. a second temperature-moderating compartment can be added to the alternate end of the canisters. a second temperature-moderating compartment can be added to the alternate end of the canisters. the samples can be removed from the amplification compartment and reinserted into the 80\u00b0C compartment. isolates, including non-B subtypes, identification of the optimal primer set/sets is a key step in the development of the RT-LAMP assay. future studies will include large-scale evaluation of clinical specimens with the optimized RT-LAMP assay and NINA device."}
