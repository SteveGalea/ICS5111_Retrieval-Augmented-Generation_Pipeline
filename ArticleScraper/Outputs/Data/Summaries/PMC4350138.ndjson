{"summary": "non-specific disease syndromes such as brucellosis (Brucella species), Q fever (Coxiella burnetii), leptospirosis (Leptospira species), rickettsioses (Rickettsia species), plague (Yersinia pestis), Rift Valley fever and Chikungunya pose considerable challenges for clinicians in both human and animal health. hepatomegaly and splenomegaly are often reported in cases of human brucellosis. in northern Tanzania, 18.8% of patients with a confirmed diagnosis also had hepato- or splenomegaly on physical examination. in northern Tanzania, only 13.5% of confirmed cases of acute Q fever presented with respiratory symptoms. zoonotic parasitic diseases include echinococcosis and trichinosis. non-parasitic zoonoses, such as leptospirosis and borreliosis, also have the potential to cause a range of CNS signs. challenge of non-specific presentation of many zoonoses also applies to diagnosis of animal infection. 2.9 per cent of female domestic ruminants have history of at least one abortion. infection with several of the priority zoonoses of the world organisation for animal health (OIE), including Brucella, Leptospira and Streptococcus species can cause abortion in livestock species and other animals. serological diagnostic tests are more widely available and safer to conduct. but many rely on rising antibody titres for definitive diagnoses. high levels of \u2018background\u2019 exposure in some populations can complicate the interpretation of serological data. the use of culture and molecular methods for pathogen detection in animals has also been limited by many of the infrastructure and logistical restrictions that affect human disease diagnostics. the use of culture and molecular methods for pathogen detection in animals has also been limited by many of the infrastructure and logistical restrictions that affect human disease diagnostics. endmic zoonoses remain widely neglected in many low-income settings. impact is borne largely by impoverished and marginalised communities. inequalities in access to healthcare facilities are also likely to be major contributing factor to underdiagnosis. DALYs do not include any measure of the impact of zoonoses on animal health either directly or through the costs of lost animal productivity. frameworks exist for economic evaluation of zoonoses (Narrod and others 2012) there are currently no standardised metrics equivalent to the DALY that integrate the multiple impacts of zoonoses on human and animal health. malaria was the clinical diagnosis in the majority of cases (60.7 per cent), but was the actual cause of fever in very few (1.6 per cent) malaria was the clinical diagnosis in the majority of cases (60.7 per cent), but malaria was the actual cause of fever in very few. bacterial zoonoses were not initially considered by clinicians in any cases. many endemic zoonoses should be considered in the list of possible aetiologies for relevant human disease syndromes in most, if not all parts of Africa. however, there is considerable local variation in prevalence and incidence in both human and animal populations globally. exposure to T gondii occurs throughout africa, with some indication of decreasing prevalence from north to south, and from west to east. the specific risk factors underlying these geographic trends remain unknown about epidemiological risk factors in Africa. there is great scope to develop syndromic approaches to disease detection and diagnostics in animal populations. for example, livestock abortions are often noticed by the farmer. laboratory testing of diagnostic material from abortion events has great potential for enhancing our understanding of epidemiology of many infections in livestock populations. effective livestock vaccines are available for the control of brucellosis, Q fever, leptospirosis, anthrax (Bacillus anthracis) and toxoplasmosis (T gondii) the rationale for livestock vaccination tends to be argued only from the perspective of the livestock sector and in terms of private good to the livestock owner. the diagnosis of many endemic zoonoses will remain challenging. improved front line diagnostic capacity alone cannot be the only measure taken to effectively tackle the multiple impacts of these diseases. there is a need to implement preventive and control measures that tackle these diseases in a much more fundamental way."}
