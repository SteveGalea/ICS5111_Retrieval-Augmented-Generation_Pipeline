{"summary": "angiotensin II-induced, renal mesangial cell gene 52 showed 53% amino acid identity and 73% amino acid similarity to the Nipah virus matrix protein. the protein, called Angrem52, displays 53% amino acid identity and 73% amino acid similarity over 337 amino acids (aa) to the Nipah virus matrix protein. the full-length F ORF was obtained by making 5 changes to the reported Angrem52 sequence. putative gene-end, intergenic (IG) and gene-start transcription regulatory signals lie between OPmV M and F genes are shown aligned to the corresponding signals from Nipah and Hendra virus. the sequences surrounding the F protein cleavage sites, including most fusion peptides, of several paramyxoviruses, including putative OPmV, were an A at position 2110 was deleted; a T at position 2155 was deleted. a pairwise alignment of the resulting protein with the F protein of Nipah virus shows 32% identity and 53% similarity over 509 aa. the reported angrem52 cDNA sequence has an acidic glutamic acid at this position. a potential signal sequence from residues 1 to 23 and a potential transmembrane domain is found between residues 497 and 516. the putative OPmV F has heptad repeats in positions expected for a paramyxovirus F protein (residues 108\u2013190 and 428\u2013481) a possible RNA editing signal similar to that found in the P gene of other paramyxoviruses is present. a possible RNA editing signal similar to that found in the P gene of other paramyxoviruses is present. phylogenetic comparison of the putative OPmV P, M, and F proteins suggests that the putative OPmV belongs to a previously uncharacterized genus in the paramyxovirus family. the putative OPmV M is found to be slightly more similar to the Henipah virus genus than to other paramyxoviruses. Phylogenetic tree showing the relationship of the putative OPmV F protein to the F proteins of other representative paramyxoviruses. trees were generated from these alignments by using neighbor-joining methods through the computer program MEGA version 2.1. the apparent presence of viral genes in a primary human cell culture system is intriguing. the presence of these genes could reflect the presence of a virus in any of several states. we obtained a human 12-tissue, multiple tissue, Northern blot from Clontech. we also screened 4 lots of Clonetics primary human mesangial cells for the presence of the putative OPmV mRNAs and products. RT-PCR analysis using a number of primer sets for each of the putative OPmV genes yielded consistently negative results. the source of OPmV remains unclear. exploring."}
