{"summary": "the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small, arboreal nonhuman primate. it is native to the Atlantic Coastal Forest in northeast brazil and parts of south east brazil. in recent years the common marmoset has become more widely used in applied biomedical research. the utility of marmosets to assess medical countermeasures has also been demonstrated. a vaccine has been tested for Lassa fever [18], and the efficacy of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin has been tested as postexposure therapies for anthrax and tularemia respectively [19, 20]. a high level of gene homology between humans and NHPs underlies physiological and biochemical similarities. the work focuses on understanding the immune profile of the naive marmoset as well as identifying and quantifying the immune response to infectious disease. the aim of this work is to determine key changes and identify correlates of infection or protection. samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 hrs at 4\u00b0C. samples were analysed by flow cytometry (FACScanto II BD) within 72 hours of staining. levels of circulating cytokines and chemokines were also quantified. all animal studies were carried out in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986 and the Codes of Practice for the Housing and Care of Animals used in Scientific Procedures 1989. animals were challenged with an intracellular pathogen by either the subcutaneous or inhalational route. BD cytokine flex beads and the Luminex system show significant cross-reactivity with the marmoset suggesting a high degree of conservation between the two species. but for other cytokines that are pivotal in the innate response, TNF and IFN reagents were obtained from U-CyTech Biosciences and Mabtech AB. single cell suspensions of lung and spleen tissue were also examined in conjunction with the traditionally used blood cells. neutrophils were stained as CD11c dim CD14 and macrophages as CD11c + CD14+ regardless of tissue origin. Flow cytometry plots showed the difference in size (FSC) and granularity (SSC) of the basic cell types. a ratio of 2 to 3 B to T cells in the spleen and 1 to 6 B to T-cells in the lungs was observed compared to a ratio of 3 to 2 B to T cells in mouse spleens [30]. the percentage of the total leucocyte count for various cell types identified in naive marmosets (a) cells in nave blood, (b) in naive spleens, and (c) in naive 3Monocytes CD11c dim CD14 3 (1\u201310) nd 1-2 nd nd 1Reported as percentage of lymphocytes. 4Recalculated as average mouse values from reported strains. a cross-species comparison suggests that monocytes comprise 3% of leukocytes. none of these cytokines were detected in blood samples from uninfected animals. however low levels of MIP-1, MCP-1, and Rantes were found in spleen and lung tissue. a rapid decline in the number of macrophages in the lungs and blood was observed by 46 hours after challenge. the levels of various cell types and cytokines were also measured in the blood of animals following inhalational challenge with marburg virus. animals were challenged with bacteria at a comparable dose either by inhalation (n = 22) or by a systemic route (n = 12) and humanely killed once they had reached a humane endpoint (between day 4 and day 5 after challenge) the activation markers provide more detailed information. the spleen was chosen as a representative organ of systemic disease. the immune response in marmosets to infectious disease can be characterised in terms of the phenotype and activation status of all the major immune cells and key cytokine and chemokine expression. the marmoset is an appropriate animal model for biodefense-related pathogens. the authors declare there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper."}
