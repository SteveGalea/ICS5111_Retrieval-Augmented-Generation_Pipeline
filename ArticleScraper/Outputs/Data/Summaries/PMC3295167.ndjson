{"summary": "the rRT-PCR protocol for detection and characterization of swine influenza virus (rRT-PCR swine flu panel) was approved by the fda for diagnosing human influenza virus infections and H5N1 viruses in 2008. a combination of the seasonal flu panel with the swine flu panel was cleared by the FDA in September 2011 (8). the size of the minipools differs from country to country. each sample in a positive pool is retested individually. pooling of specimens has also been evaluated for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. clinical NP/throat swab specimens used in this study were negative for seasonal influenza viruses (A/H1, A/H3, and B) and 15 additional respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus types A and B; parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3, 4a, and 4b; human metapneumovirus subgroups B, C, and E; coronavirus subgroups OC43, NL63, and 229E; and human rhino qMan probes for seasonal influenza viruses (InfA), universal swine influenza virus A (swInfA), the swine influenza virus H1N1 subtype, and the swH1 subtype. the RP primer and probe are designed to detect all influenza A viruses, that for swInfA to detect all swine influenza A viruses, and that for swH1 to specifically detect the 2009 H1N1 virus. CDC influenza virus reference strain with negative clinical specimens spiked into six pools of unique negative clinical specimens. the reference strain was spiked into VTM, as a control in the experiment. each pool was extracted once, and PCR was performed. the human seasonal influenza virus A/H1N1 strain A/South Dakota/06/2007 was provided by the CDC as a representative influenza virus A strain. the clinical NP/throat swab specimens used in this study were previously tested by PCR for the presence of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus. extractions using both kits were performed according to manufacturer's instructions. for use with the large-volume TNA kit, 1-ml volumes were extracted and eluted into 100 l of elution buffer. Detection of the 2009 H1N1 virus and seasonal influenza viruses A and B was performed using the CDC rRT-PCR swine flu panel. one hundred microliters of clinical specimen was mixed with 900 l VTM. another 100 l of the same clinical specimen was also extracted for nucleic acid using the large-volume TNA kit. swInfA and swH1 markers were individually re-extracted and retested by PCR. one hundred microliters of the specimen was diluted in 900 l of VTM. a pool, dilution, or sample was considered positive if the CT values of two out of the three replicates were less than 37. the CDC seasonal A/H1N1 reference strain was mixed with negative clinical specimens. instead of VTM, the influenza virus reference strain was mixed with negative clinical specimens. the PCR results showed that samples of the 104.2 EID50 reference strain spiked into pools of negative clinical specimens were within one CT value of each other. three unique clinical specimens (CS1, CS2 and CS3) positive for the 2009 H1N1 virus were each spiked into five pools of negative specimens. each pool and specimen in VTM was extracted once, and PCR was performed in triplicates. pools containing multiple positive specimens were shown to have no effect on the detection of a positive pool. the required number of negative specimens was mixed with positive specimens. these pools generated CT values similar to those of the specimen in the pool with the lowest CT value. higher concentrations of viral nucleic acid from the presence of seasonal influenza viruses also did not inhibit detection by PCR. infA, influenza A virus matrix (M) gene target for detecting any influenza A virus; swInfA, influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP) gene from swine for detecting swine influenza virus in the genetic lineage of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1). swH1, highly conserved region of hemagglutinin (HA) gene for detecting the 2009 pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1), subtype H onavirus OC43, one for human metapneumovirus, one for rhinovirus, one for seasonal influenza A/H3 virus, and three for seasonal influenza A/H1 viruses. PCR was performed in triplicate for the pool sample. data are the mean CT values of the pool with the standard deviation of the triplicate PCR results. Specimens from pools positive for the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus were individually extracted. PCR was performed using the InfA, swInfA, swH1 and RP markers. all three sites correctly identified the negative specimens from positive pools. samples 9 and 10 were negative for influenza A virus (infA), swine influenza A virus (swInfA), and swine influenza virus H1 (swH1). samples 41 and 45 from pool E were positive for influenza A, but negative for the swInfA and swH1 markers. the average CT values obtained with testing specimens extracted with the MagNA Pure TNA kit were compared to that of the MagNA Pure TNA kit. s were within one or two CT values (Table 1). This result suggested that the pooled specimens did not exceed the capacity of the extraction method. the results showed differences of one to two CT values for the InfA, swInf. infA swInfA swH1 RP CS1 20 1 21 2 25 1 25 1 Spiked pools 20 1 21 2 24 1 22 1 CS2 20 1 20 3 24 1 24 1 Spiked pools 20 1 21 2 24 1 22 2 CS3 26 1 26 1 29 0 26 1 24 2 a negative clinical specimens and one positive for the 2009 H1N1 virus were spiked into five pools. pool of 10 specimens each containing two, five, seven, and eight positive specimens were tested. pools containing multiple positive specimens generated CT values similar to those of the specimen in the pool with the lowest CT value. a pool lacking the 2009 H1N1 virus but containing a seasonal influenza A virus, the CT values for the influenza B virus target were unaffected. pool containing eight specimens positive for the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus yielded negative PCR results for all influenza virus targets. swInfA, influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP) gene from swine for detecting swine influenza virus in the genetic lineage of 2009 pandemic influenza A. pool contains one positive for 2009 A/H1N1, one for human coronavirus OC43, one for human metapneumovirus, one for human metapneumovirus, one for seasonal influenza B virus, one for seasonal influenza A/H3 virus. pool D was positive for just the influenza A virus marker as it contained seasonal influenza viruses A/H1 and A/H3. PCR was performed using markers for influenza A virus (InfA) (A), swine influenza A virus (swInfA) (B) and swine influenza virus H1 subtype (swH1) (C) from the CDC rRT-PCR protocol for detection and characterization of swine influenza virus. each site tested the five pools three times on three different days. the error bars denote standard deviation of PCR results performed on three separate days. samples 9 and 10 from pool A were negative for influenza A virus (infA), swine influenza A virus (swInfA), and swine influenza virus H1 (swH1) and were positive for RNase P (RP). samples 41 and 45 from pool E were positive for influenza A, but negative for the swInfA and swH1 markers. a strategy of pooling specimens can be used to test for the presence of influenza virus using the CDC rRT-PCR swine flu panel (24). the results showed that the increase in cellular material, including nucleic acid, due to pooling of multiple specimens did not affect detection of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus by rRT-PCR. the large-volume TNA kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) allowed for processing of sample volumes up to 1 ml on the MagNA Pure LC instrument. sensitivity of the large-volume TNA kit was similar to that of the small-volume MagNA Pure TNA kit (Table 1). Detection of a specimen with a CT value in the high 20s was not compromised when mixed with four or nine negative specimens. manual extraction methods can be used to extract and concentrate pools of specimens. but manual extraction methods can be more labor intensive than automated systems. additional studies need to be performed in order to determine whether manual extraction methods will provide similar results using a pooling protocol. the decision to implement a pooling protocol should take into consideration the current positivity rate. NP/throat swab specimens can be pooled and tested without sacrificing sensitivity. pooling scheme can increase testing capacity if used in combination with an automated extraction method."}
