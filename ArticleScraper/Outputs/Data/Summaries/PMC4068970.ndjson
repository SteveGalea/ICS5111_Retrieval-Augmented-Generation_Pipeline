{"summary": "as of June 3, 2014, MERS CoV has reportedly infected 688 people and killed 282. the epidemiology of MERS-CoV, with many sporadic cases and a few hospital outbreaks, yet no sustained epidemic, suggests a low reproductive number. a decade prior, a pandemic of SARS, a related coronavirus, caused 8,273 cases and 775 deaths in only 8 months. a decade prior, a pandemic of SARS, a related coronavirus, caused 8,273 cases and 775 deaths in only 8 months. the epidemiology of MERS-CoV is more sporadic than the classic epidemic pattern of SARS. male predominance of MERS-CoV may reflect higher likelihood of exposure to infectious agents for males than females in Middle Eastern cultures. most males who tested positive for the virus and died also had underlying medical conditions. there has been no clear animal source of infection, nor consistent history of animal contact in a majority of the reported cases. study sequenced complete MERS-CoV isolates from five camels in saudi arabia. the same study found that viral particles from individual camels contained more genetic variation than MERS-CoV isolates from humans. this pattern is suggestive of a sporadic rather than epidemic source of infection in humans. phylogenetic analysis of patient samples showed multiple different strains. at least three transmission events could not be explained by human-to-human transmission within the hospital. camels suggested as the most likely source of transmission. human to human transmission is apparent in some clusters of individuals in close contact and in the hospital setting, but does not appear frequent, supporting a low infectivity of the virus. it is possible that cases have been either asymptomatic or escaped detection, as cases with mild or no symptoms do appear to occur. a protocol has been adopted by WHO with the primary purpose of determining the non-human source of infection and corresponding route and mode of transmission to humans. genetic testing over time should be conducted to determine if the virus is evolving. the outbreak in al Ahsa may reflect such a change, as could the spike of cases observed in April, 2014. any grant."}
