{"summary": "vaccines are amongst the most cost-effective approaches available to prevent infection. vaccines that target rapidly-evolving and genetically-diverse disease agents have often failed to generate long lasting protection for human populations. vaccines that target rapidly-evolving and genetically-diverse disease agents often failed to generate long lasting protection for human populations. we will explore the role of computational vaccine design to improve the identification of pathogen antigens and key components for designing and evaluating a universal vaccine design. we will discuss the potential of incorporating interactions of virus-host-environment to develop models that allow for precise prediction for viral evolution. the HA undergoes rapid antigenic drift that accumulates from point mutations under immune selection pressure in the major antigenic sites. despite significant efforts of continuous surveillance and vaccine strain updates, vaccine mismatches have occurred many times. studies investigating the impact of vaccine mismatch have reported broad ranging vaccine efficacy (10% to 60%) for these annual vaccines. universal vaccine design focuses on conserved antigens that have been experimentally identified on M2 protein. low immunogenicity and epitope density has been a fatal limit to make cross-protection from M2 being effectively applied into vaccine design [24] the annual influenza virus vaccines contain H1N1 (phylogenetic group 1 hemagglutinin), H3N2 (phylogenetic group 2 hemagglutinin) and two influenza B virus components (Victoria-like and Yamagata-like) the vaccine candidates from natural influenza virus strains are recommended by the world health organization (WHO) based on the characterization and prediction of circulating strains likely to dominate in upcoming epidemic seasons. studies investigating impact of vaccine mismatch have reported broad ranging vaccine efficacy (10% to 60%) for these annual vaccines. vaccines offer little or no protection to emerging zoonotic influenza viruses with pandemic potential, as many species are recognized as the natural reservoir of all subtypes of influenza A viruses. HA-stalk design tries to elicit the conserved and cross-reactive protection from the membrane-proximal stalk domain. despite the potential for both M2 and HA-stalk design vaccines to elicit broadly reactive immune response, a number of challenges remain. computational approaches that go beyond circulating strain prediction are needed for universal vaccine design [24,25,26] hemagglutination inhibition assay is a poor approximation for the average immune response that does not account for heterogeneity of immune responses between hosts and pathogens. traditional design inefficiently captures few pathogen features based on a limited input that does not account for the high diversity of pathogen and high heterogeneity of host\u2019s immune responses. the ultimate goal is to generate high-quality information and broad-reactive components for a universal vaccine of influenza viruses. huge amount of data generated by the high-throughput technologies are currently available with more data regularly being made available. maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches are the most commonly used statistical phylogenetic methods to reconstruct ancestral sequence at the ancestral node [46,47,48] Maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches are the most commonly used statistical phylogenetic methods to reconstruct ancestral sequence at the ancestral node. all outputs from these three approaches, like epitopes, peptides, proteins or virus-like particles, will be tested at in-vitro and/or in-vivo models to evaluate their immunogenicity. the proposed concept is based on HA gene sequences, but these approaches should be used for all the gene segments of influenza viruses to generate a full profile of viral immunogenicity. immunoinformatics research focuses on study and design of high-throughput in-silico approaches to explore the immune system at genome level. these technological developments coupled with pathogen genomes have tremendously contributed to the selection process of optimal vaccine antigens. two distinct subsets, CD4+ T-cells (helper T cells) and CD8+ T-cells (cytotoxic T cells) recognize epitopes when they bind with MHC class II and MHC class I. a workshop on the B-cell epitope prediction tools reported that the prediction performance of B-cell epitope prediction tools is far from reality due to a lack of high-quality experimental datasets. the efficacy of epitope-based vaccines can be limited due to variability of MHC alleles among different ethnicities. this may reduce the maximum population coverage of epitope-based vaccine. the current tools, IEDB population coverage [64] and EPISOPT [65], are used to predict the population coverage. scaffold selection and design include single algorithm-based tools like MAMMOTH or meta-servers like TM-align and consensus-based designs. first criterion is flexibility of scaffold with a possible positive correlation between flexibility and immunogenicity. third criterion is the structural environment of the graft.

2) the assumption of nucleotide site independence in the model cannot capture the biological reality that some sites are linked due to shared function. some modeling approaches with a protein structure scoring system or partitioning schemes on the protein sequence [98,110,111] can potentially overcome these challenges. phylogenetic models can integrate and evaluate impacts of environmental determinants. phylodynamics has been used to study factors of interest on some viral phenotypes, including virulence, viral transmissibility, cell or tissue tropism, and antigenic phenotypes. potential predictors and consequent mutations computed by models can enhance our understanding on viral characteristics, potential immune escape, or influenza antiviral drug resistance [128]. challenges for this area are how to get accurate and sufficient information on the epidemiological, immunological and ecological factors, how to expand, integrate and enhance phylodynamic models. phylogenetic modeling is to understand the evolutionary history and patterns of viral genetic and phenotypic characteristics. phylodynamic modeling, generalized linear model (GLM) and other more advanced models are critical to identify important epidemiological and ecological determinants that affect viral evolution. computational approaches to identify candidates for universal influenza vaccine design have been used with a variety of novel vaccine production strategies in development. these approaches focus on the \u2018unnatural immunity\u2019 [40] induced by more conserved or less immune-dominant domains in the surface proteins, internal proteins or both, to tackle with the high degree of variability in influenza viruses. current rational vaccine design uses comparative genomic methods to identify conserved regions. the predicted T-cell epitopes that are evolutionarily conserved and common across or within subtypes will be constructed into peptides or proteins. the proposed concept is based on HA gene sequences but these approaches should be used for all the gene segments of influenza viruses to generate a full profile of viral immunogenicity. large efforts on surveillance data required Pre-clinical tests on H1, H3 and H5 HA [28,41,42,43,45] Ancestral sequence reconstruction Figure 2B Pre-clinical (1) Induce broad cross-reactive protection within highly diverse influenza subtype. study of immunomes coined as a new discipline \u201cimmunomics\u201d. tools mimic the diverse molecular pathways of adaptive immune system that accounts for humoral immunity (B-cells) and cellular immunity (CD4+ T-cells and CD8+ T-cells) to predict potential epitopes. key limitations include availability of experimental datasets essential in training and developing any epitope prediction tool. selection of epitope prediction tools may also introduce discrepancy in identification of potential T-cell epitopes due to methodological differences. a major challenge in the design of epitope-based vaccines is to focus immune response onto multiple well-conserved epitopes. epitope grafting or scaffolding, has been proposed as a solution for epitope-based vaccine design. a well-defined structural boundary between protein scaffold and epitopes enhances the specificity of immune responses.

participants. bnAbs and bioinformatics tools can be applied to influenza virus vaccine design. library can be used in computational approaches to quantitatively measure the immune responses and further to predict the effects of vaccine candidates without completely relying on animal tests. consensus sequences for NA protein of H1N1 and several influenza proteins of H5N1 have elicited broadly-reactive immune response. however, the nature of consensus-based antigen design determines that it is highly influenced by the input sequences. if samples from one location or one host are overrepresented in the sequences used to generate consensus, then it can bias the output consensus sequence. the ideal CORBA HA protein should contain all the conserved information present in multiple subtypes. the conserved immunogenic profile of consensus sequences from COBRA approach is dependent upon the sharing of epidemiological and genetic data collected during public health investigations and surveillance of outbreaks. ancestral sequence reconstruction method for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 surface proteins HA and NA. ancestral sequences were synthesized into attenuated influenza viruses. cross-reactive protection against H5N1 morbidity and mortality have been confirmed in preclinical experiments with ferret models. hypothesis of nucleotide site independence in the model cannot capture the biological reality that some sites are linked due to shared function. some modeling approaches with a protein structure scoring system or partitioning schemes on the protein sequence can potentially overcome these challenges. but some studies have incorporated protein structural information into evolutionary analyses. consensus sequences for NA protein of H1N1 and several influenza proteins of H5N1 have elicited broadly-reactive immune response. however, the nature of consensus-based antigen design determines that it is highly influenced by the input sequences and thus subject to sampling bias. the critical step in designing COBRAs is to use multiple rounds of consensus generation. coBRAs-based designed HA protein of H1, H3 and H5 have been tested with in-vitro assays and animal models. the ideal CORBA HA protein should contain all the conserved information present in multiple subtypes. phylogenetic evolutionary models have been used to infer influenza viral evolutionary history for decades with molecular data. phylogenetic algorithms have been developed to reconstruct ancestral sequences for broadly-reactive vaccine design. phylogenetic algorithms have been developed to reconstruct ancestral sequences for broadly-reactive vaccine design. the integration of protein functions and structures into evolutionary models has two main challenges: (1) published viral protein structural and functional information may not be available or sufficiently resolved based on current studies. the assumption of nucleotide site independence in the model cannot capture the biological reality that some sites are linked due to shared function [113] deep mutational scanning is used to quantify the impacts of codon changes to several proteins or functional domains. this information of protein function from rapid high-throughput experiments may greatly improve the precision of ancestral sequence reconstruction. phylodynamic modeling and experimental testing can be integrated together to improve prediction on influenza virus evolvability. potential predictors and consequent mutations computed by models can enhance our understanding on viral characteristics, potential immune escape, or influenza antiviral drug resistance [128]. challenges for this area are how to get accurate and sufficient information on the epidemiological, immunological and ecological factors. phylodynamics have been used to study factors of interest on some viral phenotypes, including virulence, viral transmissibility, cell or tissue tropism, and antigenic phenotypes that can facilitate immune escape. phylodynamic modeling and experimental testing can be integrated together to improve prediction on influenza virus evolvability. influenza viruses have established an excellent global network of sentinel institutions to monitor outbreaks and collect human samples. the imbalanced sampling efforts on different hosts and geographical regions are caused by global and local resource allocation. the unequal sampling of geographical regions is caused by global and local resource allocation. the sharing of viral sequence data is often long after the outbreaks. a standardized protocol should be established for sharing more complete viral and host-related information. computational models that fully integrate multiple sources of information, including experimental evidence, could aid in the identification of critical components for vaccine design. machine learning can incorporate different modeling steps and all available surveillance, genetic and experimental data to keep updating information and make predictions for computational vaccine design. machine learning can incorporate different modeling steps and all available surveillance, genetic and experimental data to keep updating information based on known information. more sampling efforts are definitely necessary in animal hosts, especially wild aquatic birds [129] Olson et al. examined 11,870 GenBank records and reviewed 50 non-overlapping studies. there are a high proportion of non-tested samples globally. the affiliated sequence meta-data records have been improved with samples from recent years. machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence in the field of computer science, which usually uses statistical techniques and mathematical models to make computers \u201clearn\u201d with data without being explicitly programmed. the next step would be to introduce and apply machine learning to the computational process for vaccine design. vaccines do not offer any immunological protection against potential pandemic zoonotic strains. recent decades have witnessed technological advancements in the viral genetic sequencing and computational modeling."}
