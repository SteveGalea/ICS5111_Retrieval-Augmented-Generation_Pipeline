{"summary": "anxin-A1 (AnxA1) is one mediator of endogenous anti-inflammation. it affords regulation of leukocyte trafficking and activation in many contexts. but its role in lung pathologies has been scarcely investigated. pathological events leading to pulmonary fibrosis have been attributed to overproduction of interstitial collagens by cytokine-activated fibroblasts. however, a paramount causative role for transforming growth factor (TGF)-1 has emerged. anti-inflammatory drugs do not improve lung function or life expectancy and their use may also be associated with harmful side effects. annexin A1 (AnxA1; 346 amino acids long; 37 kDa protein) is a potent modulator of leukocyte trafficking/transmigration in acute and chronic inflammation. it is highly expressed in the airways, both in human/animal alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells [16-18], a finding explained by constitutive gene promoter activity. bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis was induced by intratracheal (i.t.) administration of bleomycin. mice were anesthetized with ketamine (Dopalen, Vetbrands, Brazil, 60%) and xylazine (Anasedan, Vetbrands, 40%) solution. animals were perfused with 20 mL of PBS to remove blood contents from tissues. animal survival was monitored daily up to 21 days post-bleomycin. mice were treated daily with 1 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) of peptide Ac2-26 (ac-AMVSEFLKQAWFIENEEQEYVQTVK; obtained from Tocris, Huissen, The Netherlands) samples of lung homogenate (500 L) were added to 1 mL of 6 N hydrochloric acid for 8 h at 120\u00b0C. resulting samples were incubated at room temperature for 20 min before addition of 100 l of chloramine-T solution. chloride containing 2.6 mM EDTA with a 1 mL syringe was centrifuged. cell pellets were re-suspended and an aliquot (190 L) was diluted 20:1 in Turk's solution. total and differential counting was obtained with a Neubauer chamber. al rabbit anti-AnxA1 antibody (Zymed Laboratories) added (1:200 in 1% PBSA) overnight at 4\u00b0C. samples were stained with 5 mM potassium ferricyanide and 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide. western blotting Lung from control or experimental groups of wild type mice were homogenized in EDTA free protease inhibitor (Roche, UK) protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Sigma), mixed 1:1 with Laemmli sample buffer [28]. the survival rate was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier cumulative plots. animals were housed at a density of five animals per cage in a room. the temperature was maintained at 21-23\u00b0C. mice were treated daily with 1 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) of peptide Ac2-26 (ac-AMVSEFLKQAWFIENEEQEYVQTVK; obtained from Tocris, Huissen, The Netherlands) mice received the same dose and route of peptide Ac2-26 from day 14 to day 21 post-bleomycin. samples of lung homogenate (500 L) were added to 1 mL of 6 N hydrochloric acid for 8 h at 120\u00b0C. resulting samples were incubated at room temperature for 20 min before addition of 100 l of chloramine-T solution. cell pellets were re-suspended and an aliquot (190 L) was diluted 20:1 in Turk's solution. cells were separated in polymorphonuclear (PMN), mononuclear phagocytic cells (monocyte/macrophages - MPC) and lymphocytes (LY) sections of lungs were incubated with non-immune rabbit serum (1:200 working dilution; Sigma-Aldrich) instead of the primary antibody. a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to 5 nm colloidal gold (1:100; British BioCell International) was then added. densitometric analysis for X-Gal staining was performed densitometricaly with the Software AxiovisionTM (Zeiss) in lung leukocytes and epithelial cells. values generated varied from 0 to 255 arbitrary units. Western blotting Lung from control or experimental groups were homogenized in EDTA free protease inhibitor (Roche, UK) anxA1 protein expression and gene promoter activity in lung fibrosis was analyzed in wild type mice at 0, 7 and 21 days. anxA1 protein expression was analyzed in wild type mice lung at 0, 7 and 21 days. values (densitometric units) are mean SEM of 10 histological tissue sections analyzed from five mice per group. X-Gal staining was done as described in Material and Methods section. all cells were positive for AnxA1 under basal conditions. at day 7 post-bleomycin, an increment of AnxA1 expression was observed in the bronchiolar epithelium (Figure 1C), PMN and MPC of wild type mice. an intense positive reaction was attained (K-N) on day 7 and 21 post-bleomycin administration. basal Anxa1 gene promoter activity could be detected in the bronchiolar epithelium (Figure 1I), PMN and MPC. lack of AnxA1 exacerbates inflammatory cell recruitment in lung fibrosis. wild type and anxA1 null mice were analyzed at 0, 7 and 21 days post-bleomycin i.t. administration. data are mean SEM from 5 mice per time point. bleomycin administration caused marked leukocytosis at day 21. administration of saline to either wild type or AnxA1 null did not lead to abnormal deposition of collagen around the bronchiole, vessels or alveoli. wild type mice showed no significant increase in the connective tissue (Figure 3B), with signs of severe fibrosis evident at day 21. anxA1 null bleomycin-treated mice had significantly higher fibrosis scores than saline-treated corresponding mice. there was a statistically significant difference (+23.5% at day 7; +20% at day 21) between wild type and anxA1 null bleomycin-treated mice, indicating induction of a higher degree of pulmonary fibrosis. higher serum TGF-1 and TNF- levels were measured at day 7 in anxA1 null mice. similar changes were seen in samples taken from anxA1 null mice. a control group treated daily with peptide Ac2-26 i.p. and given saline i.t. did not show significant morphological changes in the lung tissue. a group of mice were daily treated i.p. with the peptide Ac2-26. western blotting analyses confirmed these histological results. augmented AnxA1 in lung protein extracts prepared from mice treated with peptide Ac2-26 over 21 days or only for the 14-21 day period. anxA1 protein expression was monitored in wild type mice lung at 0, 7 and 21 days post-bleomycin i.t. administration. a group of mice were daily i. values (densitometric units) are mean SEM of 10 histological tissue sections analyzed from five mice per group. # P 0.05 versus sham group values. bronchiole epithelial cells (Figure 1A), mononuclear phagocytic cell (MPC) and circulating polymorphonuclear (PMN) all cells were positive for AnxA1 under basal conditions. no immunogold staining could be detected in absence of the primary antibody. an intense positive reaction was attained (K-N) on day 7 and 21 post-bleomycin administration. basal Anxa1 gene promoter activity could be detected in the bronchiolar epithelium (Figure 1I), PMN and MPC. lack of AnxA1 exacerbates inflammatory cell activation in lung fibrosis. wild type and anxA1 null mice were analyzed at 0, 7 and 21 days post-bleomycin i.t. administration. bleomycin administration caused marked leukocytosis at day 21. wild type and anxA1 null mice showed no significant increase in the connective tissue. at day 7 post-bleomycin, wild type mice showed no significant increase in the connective tissue. these changes were also evident in anxA1 null mice lung. wild type and anxA1 null mice received 0.15 U/Kg bleomycin i.t. at time 0. survival rate was monitored daily up to 21 days. cytokine levels were a possible cause behind increased signs of fibrosis. levels were measured at day 7 in anxA1 null mice. a clear reduction in connective tissue deposition around the bronchiolar epithelium was observed. a control group treated with peptide Ac2-26 i.p. and given saline i.t. did not show significant morphological changes in the lung tissue. a group of mice were daily treated i.p. with the peptide Ac2-26. al cell and the expressions were higher than sham group (saline treated) western blotting analyses confirmed these histological results. augmented AnxA1 in lung protein extracts prepared from mice treated with peptide Ac2-26 over 21 days or only for the 14-21 day period. studies using animal models afford a well-defined means of addressing this problem since provide the opportunity to target each of these putative mediators using immunological and genetic approaches. a novel approach - exploiting the functions of homeostatic and tissue protective mediators - could provide novel clues to harness the host response during lung fibrosis [30] at day 21 post-bleomycin, the X-Gal staining detected higher Anxa1 gene promoter activity in leukocytes and epithelial cells compared to day 0 lung tissue samples. we wish to postulate that reduction in AnxA1 protein may be associated with a post-transcriptional mechanism(s) which could lead to anxA1 proteolysis or leakage from the cells. a lung fibroblast cell line derived from the AnxA1 null mouse was refractory to growth inhibition by dexamethasone. an abnormal growth formation in the AnxA1 null mice skull, probably caused by increased extracellular matrix and a delay in the bone mineralization [43]. inflammatory response and ii) greater destruction of alveolar architecture. absence of AnxA1 is conducive to increased leukocyte infiltration leading to a more severe inflammatory reaction. studies have associated inflammatory cell recruitment and lung damage with fibrosis formation. helial cells, endothelial cells and macrophages induce fibrosis and TNF- expression even in the absence of inflammation. this association of AnxA1 with TNF- expression is not totally unexpected as previously reported in a model of systemic endotoxemia induced by LPS. phenotype indicates that endogenous and exogenous AnxA1 affects selective aspects of the process of fibrosis development in the lung. authors declare that they have no competing interests. wild type and AnxA1 null mice received bleomycin i.t. at time 0. at different time points, blood aliquots were collected for lymphocyte (LY), peripheral blood monocyte (PBMN) and polymorphonuclear (PMN) quantification. data are mean SEM from two separate experiments with 5 mice each.
