{"summary": "influenza a 2009 H1N1 virus pandemic was important for monitoring the outbreak. zanamivir or a combination of oseltamivir and rimantadine are more appropriate options than oseltamivir alone. real-time PCR is multiplexed to detect six targets. za virus A matrix gene [FluA M], influenza virus B matrix gene [FluB M], the hemagglutinin genes of types H3N2 [H3], H1N1 seasonal [H1], and an extraction control. the number of clinical specimens that can be tested on a daily basis may be insufficient due to the limited multiplexing capacity of real-time PCR. the 2009 influenza pandemic prompted our investigation of multiplexing technologies that would provide influenza a 262-base RNA transcript derived from jellyfish DNA was spiked into the lysis buffer at a final concentration of 1,000 copies/PCR (18) a mixed positive control containing 200 to 1,000 copies/PCR of each influenza virus harvested from cell culture and diluted in minimal essential medium. a negative control consisting of cultured, uninfected human epithelial cells was processed with each batch of clinical specimens. Specimens with PCR threshold cycle (CT) values of 40 were considered positive. the assay limit of detection was 1,000 viral RNA copies/ml of specimen. the fluA M/Flu B M assay demonstrated excellent performance compared to the results of 1,180 nasal wash specimens tested by using fluorescent antibodies (9). the 2009 H1 assay was validated by testing a panel of FluA-positive and -negative specimens by an fda-approved influenza virus A subtyping assay performed at the Washington State Public Health Laboratory. single-stranded target was produced by adjusting the melting temperatures of the forward and reverse primers to approximately 52 and 68\u00b0C. RT and two-stage PCR are performed in a single reaction vial using an Invitrogen UltraSense One-Step RT-PCR System. probes modified with an amino-C12 linker at the 5\u2032 end were coupled to Luminex carboxylated microspheres (beads) by a carbodiimide-based procedure. 1 l of each reaction was transferred to 40 l of tetramethyl ammonium chloride (TMAC) hybridization buffer (3 M TMAC, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 4 mM EDTA, 0.1% Sarkosyl) containing 3,000 probe-coupled beads for each target. median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of at least 100 beads was reported for each target. total nucleic acid extracted using a MagNA Pure LC. sample and elution volumes were 200 l. mixed positive control containing 200 to 1,000 copies/PCR of each influenza virus harvested from cell culture. target genes, amplicon sizes, final reaction concentrations, 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 probe labels, and sequences of primers and probes used in the laboratory-developed real-time RT-PCR assay. each reaction mixes in each PCR run included nucleic acid extracted from the positive mix and negative controls. Specimens with PCR threshold cycle values of 40 were considered positive. the fluA assay was validated by testing a panel of fluA-positive and -negative specimens by an fda-approved CDC influenza virus A subtyping assay. the 2009 H1 assay was validated by testing a panel of fluA-positive and -negative specimens by an fda-approved CDC influenza virus A subtyping assay. the results of both tests agreed for all samples tested. one-tube asymmetric multiplex RT-PCR. the design of the primers and probes was based on those used in the real-time RT-PCR assay. a matrix 83 Forward TGGARTGGCTAAAGACAAGAC Reverse* CACTGGCTAAAGACAAGAC Probe CACCTCTGACTAAGGGRATTT FluA hemagglutinin H3 98 Forward CTGGAGAACCAACATACAATTG Reverse*. probe modified with 5\u2032 amino-C12 linker coupled to Luminex carboxylated microspheres. for each combination of probe and bead set, 5.0 million beads were resuspended in 0.1 M MES (morpholineethanesulfonic acid) buffer (pH 4.5), with 0.2 nmol probe, and treated twice with 25 g of 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]-carbodiimide hydrochloride. RESULTS Clinical performance of the Luminex assay. we compared the results to those of the real-time RT-PCR assay. sensitivities of the FLULUM for each viral target were as follows. sensitivity and specificity of the FLULUM assay for 806 specimens submitted in the 2010-2011 seasona Target Sensitivity Specificity TP/(TP+FN) % TN/(TN+FP) % FluA matrix 89/89 100.0 717/717 100.0 2009 H1 62/69 89.9 743/743 100.0 H3 27/28 96.4 784/784 100.0 FluB matrix 107/112 95.6 694/694 100.0 the Luminex assay assessed the relative analytical sensitivity (limit of detection) of FLULUM by testing in duplicate 10-fold serial dilutions of specimens with high viral loads. influenza virus A and B copy numbers in the samples were determined by using the real-time FluA M and FluB M RT-PCR assays.
