MSD assays provide a rapid method for measuring the levels of multiple protein targets within a single volume sample. the mouse Th1/Th2 9-Plex Assay detects capture antibodies on spatially distinct spots with an electro chemiluminiscent compound MSD SULFO TAG label. differentially expressed gene list was loaded into ingenuity pathway analysis software. results RSA59 induces acute neuropathology in mice Four week old C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with RSA59 or mock-infected with PBS as controls. three mice were sacrificed 6 days later, the time previously noted to result in peak CNS inflammation. affymetrix gene chip array analysis of spinal cord RNA reveals differential expression of 822 genes in RSA59-infected mice using a 1.5-fold cut for changes in expression. out of these 822 genes, 681 genes were upregulated and 141 genes were down regulated in infected mice. 493 genes were upregulated and only 41 genes were down regulated in infected mice. heat map of the 822 genes shown in red shows 681 genes are up-regulated. only 141 genes are down-regulated in RSA59 infection (DM) in mice. upregulated genes belong to several gene families known to be involved in apoptosis, microglial activation, complement signaling. Detailed differential expression levels of individual genes are presented in Table S1. expression of inflammatory mediators like CXCL10, CXCL9, CCL 5 and CCL12 is upregulated. RSA59 infection of the mouse spinal cord is further marked by increased expression of genes involved in IFN signaling. the color coding dendrogram represents the expression of individual genes which increases from blue (lowest expression) to red (highest expression). the genes selected are immunity related GTPases (IRGM1, IRGM2), guanylate binding proteins (GBP2, GBP10) and Interferon-gamma inducible GTPase 1 (IIGP1), CXCL9 and CXCL10 (B); and CD molecules including CD8b, CD19, CD11b, CD74 validation was performed for CD molecules, CXCL, IRGM and GBP genes; IFN induced genes IRGM1, IRGM2, GBP2, GBP10, Iigp1; and CXCL molecules CXCL9 and CXCL10 which were highly upregulated (Figure 2B). there was no upregulation of CD4 (data not shown) or CD19 (0.9905), and little expression of CD8a and CD8b which is also associated with upregulation of granzyme these molecules influence canonical pathways like antigen presentation pathway, multiple sclerosis, hypercytokinemia/Hyperchemokinemia, granulocyte and Agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis. top disease pathways that are influenced by these genes are endocrine system disorders, gastrointestinal and immunological diseases, metabolic disorders and infectious diseases. IPA analysis also identified five molecules (ifnar, ifng, TRIM24, STAT1 and ifn astrocytes, can bind to CXCR3 expressing microglia in the demyelinating plaque while CCL2 can induce the recruitment of microglia in MS lesions. top disease pathways influenced include infectious and hematological diseases, respiratory diseases and skeletal and muscular disorders. real time PCR analysis of the Aif1 gene expression showed that there is approximately four fold up regulation in RSA59 infected mice brain compared to mock infected control. mRNA expression and protein expression in RSA59 (DM strain) compared to mock infection. mKC is produced by activated microglia/macrophages and plays an important role in inflammation. IL-10 is also upregulated, and helps virus evade the immune system. results consistent with prior evidence that a Th1-biased cytokine/chemokine response accompanies persistent MHV infection when antigen presentation is ongoing. RNA was extracted from spinal cords of the same RSA59-infected and control mice. RT-PCR was performed using primer/probe designed specifically from MHV nucleocapsid. no amplification was observed in control mice and very little amplification was observed in control mice. genes upregulated in RSA59-infected spinal cords include numerous genes involved in innate immune inflammation. upregulated genes belong to several gene families known to be involved in microglial activation. Detailed differential expression levels (fold changes) of individual genes are presented in Table S1. list of upregulated genes previously not known to be associated with MHV infection and inflammation. MHC-Class\u2013II, Irf1, Irf7 and Stat1 are also upregulated in the spinal cord of RSA59 infected mice. conventional T cell (CD4, CD8) and B cell (CD19) transcripts also show upregulation in microarray analysis. there is significant upregulation of CD74, CD11b (ITGAM) and CD52. microglia specific CD molecules CD74, CD11b and Aif1 are highly up-regulated. DM signifies an average of two RSA59 infected mice. RT-PCR validated microarray data for all upregulated genes examined. most differentially expressed genes are involved in classical innate immune signaling. RSA59 activates the classical M1 microglial activating pathway Biological network and functional pathways analysis of. top molecules involved in M1 microglial activation pathways are chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11), TNFAIP3, IL-1A, IL-1B, and IL-12rb1. top disease pathways influenced include infectious and hematological diseases, respiratory diseases and skeletal and muscular disorders. inflammatory responses include changes in microglia morphology-from ramified (resting) to amoeboid (active) in the mock infected brains, most Iba-1 stained cells show ramified morphology characteristic of resting microglia. some cells in the vicinity of the inflamed regions are CD4+, CD8+ or CD19+. analysis of acute inflamed brain and spinal cord tissue from RSA59-infected mice reveals robust IFN-, IL-12, IL-10 and mKC protein expression. expression levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines reveals up-regulation of proteins involved in innate immune responses, including IFN-, IL-12, IL-10. current mRNA profiling data demonstrates significant upregulation of genes involved in innate immune responses during acute MHV infection. results consistent with prior studies that have examined the role of specific proteins, including some of the cytokines, chemokines and signaling molecules. the majority of the inflammatory cells are microglia. direct virus induced neuroinflammation due to the activation of CNS resident microglia may induce virus-specific CD8 and CD4 T cell responses in the CNS which may play a role in the augmentation of inflammation. CXCL9 and CXCL10 are known to provide antiviral immune response in MHV infection. the IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) are expressed in very low basal levels. they are the most strongly induced ISGs during many viral infections [27], [28], [29], [30] ation observed in early MHV infection is similar to its importance in other neurotropic virus infections such as HIV induced dementia [32], [33], [34], Cytomegalovirus infection [35], [36], herpes simplex Virus (HV) infection [37], [38], as well as in other neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's [39], [40], [41]. the activation of microglia and related upregulation of genes expressed by activated microglia observed in acute MHV infection is consistent with conserved mechanisms of viral mediated pathology in other infections. this suggests acute MHV infection can drive innate and conserved antiviral responses similar to those seen in other viral infections. macrophages are among the first cells in any organ to be exposed. it can further self-activate microglia, promoting phagolysome maturation and phagocytosis of the myelin sheath. this mechanism involves macrophage-mediated myelin stripping through an autophagy pathway without involving conventional cells. RSA59 infected mice show encephalitis (D), diffused staining of Iba-1 (F) and wide spread distribution of viral antigen (H) in control mock infected mice there were no encephalitis was observed (C), resting ramified microglia was observed in E and there were no viral antigen staining as expected (G)."}
