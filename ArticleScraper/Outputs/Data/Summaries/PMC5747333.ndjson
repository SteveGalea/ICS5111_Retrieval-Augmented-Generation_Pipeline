{"summary": "introduction and Methods section presents 3 hypotheses about mechanisms of Zika-virus induced microcephaly and host-invasion by the virus. we have added 2 new authors, Kalyani B. Karunakaran and Josefina Correa-Men\u00e9ndez who contributed to this revision. microcephaly results in reduced head circumference measurement in infants. of particular concern is the attribution of microcephaly to infection with ZIKV. evidence linking ZIKV to microcephaly includes detection of ZIKV RNA in tissue such as the placenta and amniotic fluid of pregnant women with ZIKV. IFITMs are located at the cell plasma and endosomal membranes. they are the means of entry and fusion from late endosomes 26. this protein family protects the host against viral infection by directly restricting entry and fusion from late endosomes 26. IFITMs have been found to restrict virus replication among other flaviviruses, including west Nile virus and Dengue virus 23, 37, 38. the role of IFITM3 as an antiviral protein against lethal virus has been explored in vivo. OASL interacts with retinoic acid inducible gene I product (RIG-I) to activate the RIG-I immunity pathway during influenza viral infection. boosting OASL can help inhibit viral infection 40. novel PPIs predicted by our method revealed a molecular basis for the negative association between schizophrenia and rheumatoid arthritis 43. IFITM interactome figure was created using Cytoscape 47. pathways associated with proteins in the interactome were collected using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis\u00ae suite. pathways associated with IFITMs and their interactor were computed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Suite\u00ae. novel interactions are shown in bold. SPTA1 Sertoli Cell Junction Signaling TLR7 Role of Macrophages Fibroblasts and Endothelial Cells in Rheumatoid Arthritis Colorectal Cancer Metastasis Signaling Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Signaling NF-B Signaling Role of pattern recognition Receptors in recognition of Bacteria and Viruses phagosome formation Communication between Innate and Adaptive Immune Cells Cross gene-templated Embryonic Skeletal System Development NME5 Nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity SPTA1 Structural constituent of cytoskeleton TLR7 siRNA binding UIMC1 K63-linked polyubiquitin binding VKORC1 Oxidoreductase activity, acting on the CH-OH group of donors, disulfide as acceptor Vitamin-K-epoxide reductase (warfarin-insensitive it is a molecular scaffold protein that is involved in linking the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton. it is also involved in neural functions of actin filament organization, neurite outgrowth and axon guidance. other predicted interactors include TSSC4, TLR7, and ARPC1B. a study that presents altered gene expression under ZIKV infection is available in Gene Expression Omnibus 16. the study showed that the infection of human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) with the virus caused increased cell death and cell-cycle dysregulation 16. cilia dysfunction in ependymal cells may be associated with microcephaly induced by Zika virus IFITM1 and three of the novel interactors (NME5, UIMC1 and DYNLT3) were found in cilia interactome (i.e. interactome of proteins of the organelle cilia) the fact that multiciliated ependyma is infected by a wide variety of viruses. glial cells (RGCs), that give rise to ependymal cells, are more susceptible to infection by Zika virus than neurons 60. astrocytes constitute a barrier between brain parenchyma- a site of Zika infection- and ventricles from the embryonic stage 61. genes implicated in microcephaly may also influence hydrocephalus. the mechanism allowing IFITM1 to regulate assembly of tight junctions may be related to endosomal trafficking. it was speculated that the mechanism allowing IFITM1 to regulate assembly of tight junctions may be related to endosomal trafficking. receptors that recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) 76, 77. VP26 interacts with DYNLT3 which is a component of the motor protein, cytoplasmic dynein 1, mediating retrograde movement of vesicles and organelles along microtubules. FITM1 opens up the possibility that the inhibitory action of IFITM1 on Zika virus may be mediated by effector functions of natural killer (NK) cells. the novel interactions of TLR7 and CD81 with IFITM1 may also serve as potential targets of Zika virus by which it suppresses immune responses. FNDC3B- a novel interactor of IFITM3 promotes cell migration by cooperating with ANXA2 96. FNDC3B has been found to be upregulated in samples of hepatocellular carcinoma infected with HBV (Hepatitis B virus) or HCV and overexpressed in normal liver tissue infected with viral hepatitis 97. cilia dysfunction in ependymal cells may be associated with microcephaly induced by Zika virus IFITM1 and three of the novel interactors (NME5, UIMC1 and DYNLT3) were found in cilia interactome (i.e. interactome of proteins of the organelle cilia) the fact that multiciliated ependyma is infected by a wide variety of viruses, possess motile cilia, micro villi radial glial cells (RGCs), that give rise to ependymal cells, are more susceptible to infection by Zika virus than neurons 60. astrocytes are more susceptible to infection by Zika virus than neurons 60. a role for IFITM1 in formation of stable contacts between cells during lumen formation. intercellular vacuoles failed to fuse and form a multicellular lumen due to the mislocalization of OCLN (occludin) it was speculated that the mechanism allowing IFITM1 to regulate assembly of tight junctions may be related to endosomal trafficking since internalized OCLN is returned to the plasma membrane. VP26, the capsid surface protein of HSV, interacts with DYNLT3. it is a component of the motor protein, cytoplasmic dynein 1, mediating retrograde movement of vesicles and organelles along microtubules within cells 78. novel interactions of TLR7 and CD81 with IFITM1 opens up the possibility that the inhibitory action of IFITM1 on Zika virus may be mediated by effector functions of natural killer cells. the novel interactions of TLR7 and CD81 with IFITM1 may also serve as potential targets of Zika virus by which it suppresses immune responses of the host. FNDC3B promotes cell migration by cooperating with ANXA2 96. FNDC3B has been found to be upregulated in samples of hepatocellular carcinoma infected with HBV (Hepatitis B virus) or HCV and overexpressed in normal liver tissue infected with viral hepatitis 97. novel interactor of IFITM1and antagonist of AGTR1 influences angiogenesis induced by VEGF 103. vascular lumen formation may contribute to the development of microcephaly 104."}
