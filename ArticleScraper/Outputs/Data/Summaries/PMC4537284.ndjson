{"summary": "avian influenza virus has been one of the most important zoonotic viral infections of humans in the last decade. human fatality rates more than 50 percent in some areas of 15 affected countries where outbreaks continue. virus belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae, of which the H5N1 type has a broad range of hosts. infected human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) with H5N1 avian influenza virus. we examined virus-cell interactions, induction of cellular mediators and phenotypic characterization of hNPCs following H5N1 virus infection in vitro. the hNPCs were cultured on matrigel-coated dishes in a culture medium. hNPCs were infected with either H5N1 or ultraviolet (UV)-inactivated H5N1 virus. the hNPCs were infected with either avian influenza virus (A/Chicken/Thailand/CUK2/04) the cells and supernatants in 24 wells-microtiter plates were collected for RNA isolation and viral growth kinetic study. the cells were graded for the CPEs compared to the medium alone infected groups, which served as mock-infected control. the data were obtained from the experiments performed in triplicate. cells were incubated in propylene oxide and embedded in resin. ultra-thin sections were cut and stained with toluidine blue. electron contrasted with uranil acetate and lead citrate. the secondary antibodies were incubated for 45 min at RT with one of the following antibodies. the nuclei were counterstained using bisbenzimide (0.01% in ethanol, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 10 min at RT.

PCR conditions were 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 sec, 60\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 72\u00b0C for 30 sec. the threshold cycles (Ct) of all genes were normalized to that of GAPDH gene at the corresponding time points compared to mock-infected groups. hNPCs showed morphology of spindle, bi- to multi-branch processes. mRNA expressions of Nestin, Pax6 and Sox1 genes indicated their neural progenitor phenotypes. hNPCs showed a bi- to multipolar morphology (A) the pronounced CPEs of infected cultures were up to 50% at 48 hpi, and 70% at 72 hpi. the detachment of h5N1-infected hNPCs was indicated by an observed significant decrease of average cell number per field at 24\u201372 hpi compared to the UV-inactivated cells or mock-infected controls. 5N1-infected hNPCs were observed by the significant decreased of average cell number per field at 24\u201372 hpi compared to the UV-inactivated H5N1- and mock-infected controls (C). hNPs support H5N1 virus infection. hNPs were distributed within the cytoplasm and the nucleus of the infected hNPCs. a statistical significant increase of virus titers from 102 TCID50/mL at 6 hpi reached a maximum titer of 107 TCID50/mL at 48 hpi. it subsequently declined to about 104 TCID50/mL at 72 hpi. results were obtained from three separate experiments. data are expressed as mean fold changes with standard error compared to untreated controls after normalization with GAPDH mRNA expressions. Asterisks indicated statistically significant differences (p-value0.05) hNPCs showed morphology of spindle, bi- to multi-branch processes. mRNA expressions of Nestin, Pax6 and Sox1 genes indicated their neural progenitor phenotypes. hNPCs showed bi- to multipolar morphology (A) -PCR revealed strong positivity for Nestin (lane 2) and Pax6 (lane 3), slight positivity for Sox1 (lane 4) genes, compared to that of GAPDH gene (Lane 1). Characterization of the cells with antibodies against Nestin, Pax6 (F-H) and Sox1 (I-K) revealed more than 85% were immunostaining positive for the Nestin (C-E), Pax6 (F-H) and Sox1 (I-K transmission electron micrographs showed changes in hNPC induced by H5N1 virus by shrinkage and condensation of the nucleus and chromatin, disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane and increased in cellular vacuolation (N = nucleus; V = vacuolation; M: mitochondria). hNPCs support H5N1 virus infection. peak percentage of virus-positive cells about 75% at 24 hpi, then declined to about 30% at 72 hpi (D). data represented are the mean standard error. hNPCs supported H5N1 virus infection as determined by a statistical significant increase of virus titers. mRNA levels of IFN-2, IFN-1, IFN-, TNF-, and IL-6 were not significantly difference. mRNA level expression of TNF- was observed to be significantly up-regulated at 48 hpi, compared to that of the control groups. hNPCs at 72 hpi with antibodies against Nestin, GFAP and -III tubulin in the H5N1-infected, UV-inactivated H5N1-infected, and mock-infected groups indicated more than 80% of the cells were expressed Nestin, while stained negative for GFAP and -III tubulin (B, C) these neural stem/progenitor cells can be classified in vitro or in vivo by stage-specific markers, such as NG2, Nestin, Pax6 and Sox1 [22,32]. differentiation of these progenitor cells into mature neurons is usually limited. inflammatory mediators secreted by other CNS tissues, such as microglia, astrocytes, and even the neural progenitor cells themselves may also play roles in this limited regeneration. the impairment of interferon production caused by H5N1 infection of the hNPCs in the present study suggests an underlying role of H5N1 virus in acute neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. a previous study also demonstrated that BDV infection decreases cell numbers during neural differentiation. hNPCs support H5N1 virus infection in vitro. infection resulted in significant cell losses and up-regulation of inflammatory cytokine. phenotypic characterization of hNPCs was unaltered."}
