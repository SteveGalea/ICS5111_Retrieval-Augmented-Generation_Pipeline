{"summary": "the aim of the present study was to describe changes in hospice inpatient utilization during and after the SARS epidemic in 2003 in Taiwan. the data sources were the complete datasets of inpatient admissions during 2002 and 2003. the first inpatient hospice ward in Taiwan was established in 1990. by the end of 2004, there were 26 hospice wards with 424 beds and 42 units for hospice home care. a universal health insurance program started in 1995 and now covers nearly all inhabitants. dozens of extracted datasets have been available to researchers. the identification numbers of persons and healthcare facilities in the datasets have been encrypted to protect privacy. no linkage with external databases and medical records was possible. the analysis was limited to those hospitals that offered hospice inpatient services throughout the whole of 2002 and 2003. we extended the before-and-after comparison to the totality of hospital beds within the national health insurance to contrast with the utilization of hospice wards. dozens of extracted datasets have been available to researchers. the identification numbers of persons and healthcare facilities in the datasets have been encrypted. the analysis was limited to those hospitals that offered hospice inpatient services throughout the whole of 2002 and 2003. the claims for the final month of the available datasets contained no data for patients who were still hospitalised at the end of that month. Pearson's chi-square test used one-way analysis of variance to compare the age distributions of those admitted in may/June 2003 to hospice wards of different accreditation levels and locations. results Only 15 hospitals in Taiwan offered hospice inpatient services throughout the whole of 2002 and 2003. of the SARS epidemic on hospice utilization varied widely among the 15 wards studied (Table 1). even during the peak period of the epidemic, three wards showed growth and one was unchanged, while two seemed temporarily to cease operating. two months after the epidemic, four wards still showed a reduction in utilization of more than 20%. n (%) Admission in may/juune 2003 (N = 566), n (%) P value Gender 0.669* Female 352 (43.0) 249 (44.0) Male 465 (56.8) 317 (56.0) Unknown 1 (0.1) Age in years 64.6 (SD 14.6) 64.6 (SD 15.0) 0.946** Primary diagnosis 0.981* Ca of trachea, bronchus, & lung 147 (18.0) 98 (17.3) Ca of hospice wards in academic medical centres were affected more severely than those in metropolitan hospitals (-60.4% vs. -38.4% in May 2003) whereas the one in a local community hospital was only slightly affected (-3.2% in May 2003) the gender and age distributions did not differ among patient groups in academic medical centres, metropolitan hospitals or the local community hospital. 42.7) 75 (45.5) 15 (51.7) Male 213 (57.3) 95 (54.5) 14 (48.3) Age in years 65.2 (SD 15.2) 64.3 (SD 14.3) 59.0 (SD 15.2) 0.091** Primary diagnosis Ca of trachea, bronchus, & lung 63 (16.9) 30 (18.2) 5 (17.2) Ca of liver & intrahepatic bile ducts 58 (15.6) 31 (18.8) 4 (13.8) Ca of trachea, bronchus, & lung 42 (18.7) 5 (14.3) 43 (17.3) 8 (13.8) Ca of liver & intrahepatic bile ducts 38 (16.9) 4 (11.4) 42 (16.9) 9 (15.5) Ca of female breast 17 (7.6) 20 (8.1) 3 (5.2) Ca of stomach 13 (5.8) 1 (2.9) 15 (6.0) 1 (1.7) Ca of pancreas 7 (3.1) 4 (11.4) 10 (4.0) the number of admissions to the 15 hospice wards in our study decreased to 69% of those in the previous year, and the utilization in patient-day units to 54%. it remains unknown whether the decrease of utilization was due to patients' voluntary decisions or to manoeuvring by the hospitals. hospices in middle taiwan were most severely affected; only the hospice in eastern Taiwan was negligibly affected. probable cases of SARS appeared mainly in Taipei city (in northern Taiwan), Taipei county (northern), Taoyuan county (northern), Kaohsiung city (southern) and Kaohsiung county (southern) our claims-based study could not determine whether the needs of patients with terminal illnesses were met during the epidemic. the lessons might be to distribute services into well-balanced networks. a seamless continuity of care between facilities should be ensured at all times."}
