{"summary": "endophytes are an endosymbiotic group of microorganisms that colonize the inter- and/or intracellular locations of plants. for these organisms, all or part of their life cycle occurs within their hosts, without any apparent symptoms of disease. they are ubiquitous in nature and exhibit complex interactions with their hosts, which involve mutualism, antagonism and rarely parasitism. endophytic microorganisms play an important role in this search for natural bioactive compounds, with potential use in the health sector and in drug discovery. study highlights various sources of endophytes, their secondary metabolites and role as source of drugs. de bary (1866) provided the first definition of an endophyte. it means any organism that grows within plant tissues is termed endophytes. however, the definition continues to change as per various researchers. endophytes are associated with plants in various forms, including bacteria (actinomycetes or mycoplasma) or fungi that have been colonized inside the plant tissues. more than 200 genera from 16 phyla of bacterial species have been reported to be associated with endophytes. most of the species belong to the phyla Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes. actinomycetes are prokaryotic microorganisms that belong to the phylum Actinobacteria. most of their properties are similar to those of bacteria but unlike bacterial cells, the cells of actinomycetes are thin with a chromosome. tes are paclitaxel extracted from Kitasatospora sp. associated with Taxus baccata. tyrosol from Emblica officinalis is suggested to inhibit food-borne microbes. mycoplasma species are also reported as plant endophytes. ae is the most effective and successful anticancer drug extracted from endophytic fungi to date. pestacin, isolated from P. microspora, has excellent antioxidant properties. many that inhabit inside the plants are often recognized as symbionts. the type of plant tissues, the environmental condition of the soil in which it is grown, the sampling season, the surface sterility, selective media and culture conditions as well as different agricultural practices. a particular type of endophytic bioactivity with the greatest potential for bioprospecting can also provide the best clue for targeting a particular type of endophytic bioactivity. the production of bioactive substances by endophytes has been directly associated with the evolution of the host microorganisms. the production of bioactive substances by endophytes has been directly associated with the evolution of the host microorganisms. some of the commonly found secondary bioactive compounds from endophytes are described below. as oxacillin, ampicillin, catechin, gallic acid, and cefalexin are known to possess bactericidal activities. the endophytic fungus, Cytonaema sp., produces triterpenoid helvolic acid with strong antibacterial activity. natural sources have been proven as the best source for drug discovery. active compounds, such as camptothecin, diosgenin, hypericin, paclitaxel, podophyllotoxin, and vinblastine, have been commercially produced by different endophytic fungi present in respective plants. they are analogs of various types of phytohormones, essential oils etc. isolated from various endophytes.
