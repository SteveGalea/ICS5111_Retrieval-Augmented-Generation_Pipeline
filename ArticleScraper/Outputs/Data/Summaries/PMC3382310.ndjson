{"summary": "influenza is the leading cause of hospitalizations of children in the united states. influenza accounts for the highest incidence of infection in children under 2 years of age. influenza is the leading cause of hospitalizations of children in the united states. in 2008, it was estimated that there were 28,000\u2013111,500 deaths attributable to influenza in children 5 years of age globally. in the united states, annual influenza epidemics account for an estimated $10 billion (12% of the total economic burden) in direct medical costs. in the united states, annual influenza epidemics account for an estimated $44\u2013$163 million in hospitalization costs for children. in children, the most common secondary bacterial infections lead to acute otitis media, which is found in 50% of patients with symptomatic influenza infection. approximately one-third of fatal infections are associated with bacterial coinfection [31, 32], but this number includes cases where respiratory support is needed, adding to the risk of secondary infections. the world health organization and CDC recommend that children and adults over the age of 6 months receive an influenza vaccination annually. influenza vaccines work to induce memory recall responses, primarily via humoral immune responses against the HA and NA surface glycoproteins. HA inhibition antibody responses following immunization correlate with level of protection elicited by immunization. influenza vaccines are effective, and studies in healthy children 15 years of age have shown TIV efficacies ranging from 31% to 90%. universal influenza vaccination is recommended for all individuals at least 6 months of age. but traditional efforts remain focused on those individuals at greatest risk of serious disease. vaccine programs also elicit indirect benefits, including herd immunity. this effect was observed in a retrospective epidemiological study in Japan and the united states examining mortality and influenza vaccination rates between 1949 and 1998. antigenic shift remains a chief concern in that highly pathogenic influenza viruses could gain efficient human-to-human transmission. a desirable vaccine candidate would be able to induce highly specific, cross-reactive antibodies and T cell responses. fluad has been used in Europe since 1997 and was recently approved for use in Canada in adults 65 years and older. the concept of a universal influenza vaccine is becoming a reality. one vaccine elicits protection against multiple influenza subtypes. it has a conserved ectodomain (M2e) that is 24 aa in length. central findings obtained from human influenza challenge studies, natural infections, and ex vivo characterization of human immune cells. Figure 1 indicates where questions remain for the human immune response to infection. INNATE IMMUNITY Effective control and clearance of influenza infection can involve most components of the innate and adaptive immune responses. in mammals, the innate immune system acts as a first-line defense consisting of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells that differentiate into NK cells, mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils. abundant inflammation often has a role in creating immunopathology and can contribute to diverse inflammatory diseases, including asthma. influenza contains ligands that activate several PRR signaling pathways. ligands include TLR3 and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), which recognize dsRNA. ligands mediate expression of more than 300 ISGs via the JAK/STAT pathway. human cathelicidin 18, the active form of which is LL-37, is found in diverse cell types, including neutrophils, NK cells, monocytes, B cells, T cells, mast cells, as well as epithelial cells lining the lungs. LL-37 shows antiviral activity against influenza and can reduce viral titers in in vitro studies. human blood monocytes can be divided into three populations based on cell surface expression of CD14 (LPS receptor) and CD16 (FcRIII) the first subgroup consists of \u201cclassical monocytes\u201d, characterized by CD14 expression and lack of CD16 expression (CD14+CD16) the second subgroup is defined by high expression of CD14 and CD16 (CD14+CD16+) and release TNF following LPS stimulation. increased numbers of total CD14+ cells are observed in the blood of influenza-infected individuals. decreased blood myeloid DCs and pDCs were observed in nasal secretions compared with healthy controls within this cohort. NS1 protein from influenza B virus inhibits ISGylation, an important host antiviral effector mechanism, by interfering with the N-terminal domain of ISG15 [156] the lack of clear correspondence between murine and human monocytic subsets has made the application of these data to the human situation difficult. innate immune cells, particularly monocytes, have at least two roles during influenza infection: to boost the innate immune response by producing proinflammatory cytokines and to enhance influenza-specific T cell responses. influenza infection of neutrophils resulted in increased internalization of Escherichia coli. chemotaxis assays during experimental influenza infection showed impaired chemotaxis of monocytes and granulocytes. lungs, chemoattractants of monocytes and macrophages were found to be elevated in the serum of influenza-infected individuals. peripheral (or local) hypercytokinemia likely contributes to enhanced immunopathogenesis during influenza disease. the history of respiratory virus challenge studies dates back to the 1918 influenza pandemic [173] early studies in humans infected with influenza identified the principal correlate of protection against influenza infection as strain-specific, virus-neutralizing antibodies directed against the HA. antibodies specific for the NA have been shown to reduce disease severity by restricting virus release from infected cells and enhancing viral clearance. the HA of A(H1N1)pdm09 contains sequences homologous with that of A/H1N1 (1918) mAb 2D1. this particular antibody can neutralize HA activity in vitro. mAb-treated mice show reduced viral titers when challenged with A(H1N1)pdm09 [90] human DCs and macrophages undergo maturation, secreting type I IFN. cellular immune responses (CD8+ CTLs and CD4+ Th cells) are important for virus clearance. human lung contains resident respiratory virus-specific CD8+ memory T cells [182], which can effectively kill virus-infected cells. patients with a memory CD45RAmedCD62 ligandloCCR7 phenotype do not have lasting antibody or CD4+/CD8+ memory responses following natural A(H1N1)pdm09 infection [185]. despite being such a critical target population, there are relatively few neonatal models of respiratory infections. young murine neonates (7 days) develop an immune response characterized by increased eosinophil and T cell recruitment to the lungs. older mice (4 weeks) develop an immune response characterized by decreased eosinophil and eosinophil recruitment to the lungs. a neonatal mouse model of influenza A virus showed early infection was associated with decreased CD8+ T cell recruitment and function and enhanced airway inflammation. ated memory T cells from older individuals are in a higher state of differentiation than those of younger individuals. fewer senescent, influenza-specific T cells, characterized as killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1 (KLRG1)hiCD57hi, are associated with a more robust antibody response following TIV delivery. pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections in infants may be associated with absence of immunological memory or failure to develop an appropriate, well-regulated T cell response. mouse models have provided some clues regarding the role of the host genetic component on the inflammatory response in the respiratory tract. the presence of low-avidity antibodies and subsequent formation of immune complex-mediated complement activation in the lungs of patients with severe influenza infection are associated with severe disease following influenza infection. innate immune responses to influenza virus infection have been restricted primarily to animal models of disease and inflammation."}
