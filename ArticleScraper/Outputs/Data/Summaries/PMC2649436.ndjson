{"summary": "the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is considered the most endangered felid species in the world. the spanish authorities implemented a captive breeding program recruiting lynxes from the wild. in this context, a retrospective survey on prevalence and importance of selected feline pathogens in free-ranging lynxes was initiated. the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is considered the most endangered felid species in the world. the species is confined to two isolated populations in southern Spain. only 40\u201350 and 150\u2013200, respectively, are estimated to remain. bovine tuberculosis was reported as the cause of death for five Iberian lynxes between 1998 and 2007 [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. a retrospective study, aimed to systematically analyze the prevalence and importance of known feline pathogens in free-ranging Iberian lynxes, was initiated. lynxes were found dead after being stuck by vehicles, one due to illegal hunting, and eight died for reasons presumed to be related to infectious diseases. one of the latter eight lynxes exhibited high viral loads of CDV, suggesting that CDV infection was the cause of death. in another, young animal, M. bovis was found in the tracheal wash. frames with dashed lines indicate FeLV-infected animals. gray shading indicates the FeLV variant most distantly related to the other FeLV found in these lynxes. the names of lynxes having close contact are positioned in close vicinity. provirus positivity was less frequent in lynxes that died from traumatic reasons than in the total population of the Doana area. four animals tested positive in only one of the three assays used. one was positive for the enU3-1, enU3-2 and env assays. the predicted amino acid sequences of the SU glycoprotein from animals infected in 2007 presented an identity/similarity of 97.3\u201397.6%/98.6\u201398.9% to FeLV-A/61E and 95.9\u201396.2%/97.6\u201397.8% to FeLV-A/Rickard. the identity/similarity of the sequence from the animal infected in 2004 was 97.3%/98.6% to FeLV-A/61E, 96.2% 0/30 0 Protozoan infections Cytauxzoon felis n.a. n.a. 0/45 0 n.a. 24/32 75 Bacterial infections M. haemofelis n.a. n.a. 16/45 35.6 n.a. n.a. 9/32 28.1 C.M. haemominutum n.a. 13/45 28.9 n.a MP tree length = 643, consistency index = (0.744726), retention index = (0.827143), composite index = 0.671491 (0.615995) for all sites and parsimony-informative sites. there were a total of 1424 base positions in the final dataset, of which 311 were parsimony-informative. 'Candidatus M. haemominutum' in 27/77 (35.1%), 'Candidatus M. turicensis' in 10/77 (13%), 'Candidatus M. turicensis' in 1/75 (11.3%), and B. henselae in 16/75 (21.3%) samples. PCR of all blood samples did not detect FIV, FCoV, FHV, FCV, or A one of the animals struck by a vehicle had been found to be FeLV provirus-positive in 2004. the remaining six dead lynxes were all positive for FeLV provirus and FeLV p27 antigen. all died within six months during the spring-summer of 2007 in the northern part of the doana area. five of these 15 lynxes died in 2007. all five were positive for FeLV provirus and FeLV p27. the majority of the remaining lynxes were clinically healthy. FeLV provirus was amplified and sequenced from 11 positive lynxes. the sequences clustered with and were 97.9\u201398.2% identical to the FeLV-A/61E strain. the identity/similarity of the sequence from the animal infected in 2004 was 97.3%/98.6% to FeLV-A/61E, 96.2%/97.8% to FeLV-A/Rickard. no sequences showing mutations that could suggest a close relationship to FeLV-A/61C were found. no sequences showing mutations that could suggest a close relationship to FeLV-A/61C were found. 0 3/30 10 0/30 0 B. henselae n.a. 6/45 13.3 n.a. 0/45 0 n.a. n.a. 0/45 0 n.a. n.a. 1/30 3.3 FeLV: feline leukemia virus; FIV: feline coronavirus; FPV: feline parvovirus; FPV: feline parvovirus; FPV antibodies to FCV were detected in 29/74 (39.2%), to FPV in 22/74 (29.7%), to FCoV in 19/74 (25.7%), to CDV in 12/74 (16.2%), to FHV in 9/74 (12.2%), and to A. phagocytophilum in 4/74 (5.4%) animals. PCR of blood samples detected FeLV in 14/77 (18.2%), FPV in 2/75 (2.7%), only six fecal samples from the 14 FeLV provirus-positive animals were available. five fecal samples originating from antigenemic animals tested positive for FeLV DNA. one sample from a p27-negative animal tested negative by PCR. six of 21 lynxes sampled between 1993 and 2003 were found to be FeLV provirus-positive, but not antigenemic. there was no indication that FeLV infection would represent a major risk for the lynx population. there was no indication that FeLV infection would represent a major risk for the lynx population. lynxes showed clinical signs and/or hematologic abnormalities. the rapid onset of the clinical signs leading to death are not a typical feature of FeLV-A infection in cats. the presence of co-infections could also have contributed to the high pathogenicity of FeLV in the cats. conjunction with FeLV-A/61C was found to cause severe immunodeficiency in domestic cats. but the presence of additional FeLV variants in different organs cannot be excluded. in domestic cats with FeLV-FAIDS, the second virus variant (FeLV-A/61C) was found in the intestines. endogenous FeLV-related sequences (enFeLV) exist as multiple, nearly full-length proviral sequences (1 to 100 copies/cell) in domestic cats. only 5 of the 77 lynxes tested displayed weak signals by quantitative real-time PCR, which is not compatible with presence of enFeLV sequences. absence of enFeLV in the Iberian lynxes is also in agreement with the absence of enFeLV in the the mechanisms inducing disease in lynxes must be distinct from those in FeLV-B-infected cats. most likely originates from domestic cats, which are increasingly frequent in doana. conservation authorities have started to vaccinate lynxes against FeLV infection using a canarypox-based FeLV vaccine. EDTA-anticoagulated blood, serum, and fecal samples from 77 free-ranging lynxes were collected in both the Doana (n = 45) and Sierra Morena (n = 32) areas in the south of Spain. only samples collected at the time of capture (free-ranging status) were included in this study. RNA specific for FCV and FCoV was detected and quantified by real-time TaqMan RT-PCR. the presence of C. felis was detected by conventional PCR using the forward primer Cytfelis.203f (5\u2032-AGA CCY YAA ACC ATC CCG CT-3\u2032) and reverse primer Cytfelis.423r (5\u2032-CCT GCT GCC TTC CTT AGA TG-3\u2032) real-time PCR and RT-PCR were performed using an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system.

Boostrap support (% of 1,000 bootstrap replicates) was calculated using neighbor-joining, minimum evolution, and maximum parsimony methods. trees were obtained using the Close-Neighbour-Interchange algorithm [77] with search level 3 [76], in which initial trees were obtained by random addition of sequences (10 replicates) all alignment gaps were treated as missing data. infection frequencies were compared using the Fisher's exact test. nucleic acids were extracted from 200 l of EDTA-blood, serosanguineous fluid, or fecal samples using the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) the presence of antibodies against FHV, FCV, FPV, FCoV, and CDV was determined by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and antibodies to FIV were detected by ELISA and western blot. the PCR reactions contained 2.5 units of Taq DNA Polymerase (Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland), a final concentration of 500 nM of each primer, 200 M dNTPs (Sigma), 2.5 l of 10 PCR Buffer (Sigma), and 2.5 l of template in a final volume of 25 l. an initial denaturation of 5 min at 95\u00b0C was followed by 35 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 70\u00b0C for 45 s, and 72 real-time PCR and RT-PCR were performed using an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system. the presence of antibodies against FHV, FCV, FPV, FCoV, and CDV was determined by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and antibodies to FIV were detected by ELISA and western blot.
