{"summary": "the global investment made in research is wasted. researchers have published their findings in journals where peer review process ensures authenticity and accuracy. research communities everywhere need freedom to access the global knowledge pool as their research needs dictate. the urgency of climate change and environmental concerns supports the importance of sharing research findings with those unable to afford ever growing subscription costs and permission barriers. a physician in southern africa whose primary access to information was to abstracts posted on the internet altered a perinatal HIV prevention program based on his reading of a single abstract. the importance of open access to both publications and data came to light at the conference Berlin 5 Open Access: From Practice to Impact: Consequences of Knowledge Dissemination. a solution appears on the horizon since 2001, the global scholarly community has begun to take corrective measures. self-archiving is accepted by some 63% of journals registered on the SHERPA database of publishers\u2019 copyright policies. it is important to note that self-archiving is accepted by some 63% of journals registered on the SHERPA database of publishers\u2019 copyright policies. the registry of open access IRs lists 1396 open access repositories as of June 17, 2009. of these, about 16% have been established in institutes and universities in developing countries. the directory of open access journals now lists 4228 open access journals. bioline international is a Canada-Brazil partnership providing a distribution mechanism for publishers from 17 developing and transitional countries. the Medknow publishing house in Mumbai, India, similarly provides free access to about 80 journals that are published primarily in India. visibility leads to increased submissions, increased citations and even subscription growth for the printed versions of their publications. the number of articles downloaded from an information resource is a measure of future citation and, by extension, of impact. the number of articles downloaded from an information resource is a measure of future citation and, by extension, of impact. in india, the Medknow publisher of biomedical journals reports an increase in subscriptions since the online versions of the journals were made available on an open access basis. the quality of local journals has improved as a result of increased visibility, with increased submissions, impact factor and international contributors being recorded. the serendipitous benefits of re-established links between researcher and user are largely immeasurable. a number of large-scale open access infrastructure projects are underway. in the area of health, WHO has a leading role to play in supporting the establishment of open access repositories. mobile communications and other technologies are starting to have an impact on the transmission of information to remote areas. the communications infrastructure is an ongoing priority in the developing world. 750 million Indians live in suburban and rural areas where you just don't have specialists."}
