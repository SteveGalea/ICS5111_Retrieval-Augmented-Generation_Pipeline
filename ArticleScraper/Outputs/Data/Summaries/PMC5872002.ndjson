{"summary": "pupillary light reflex (PLR) describes the constriction and subsequent dilation of the pupil in response to light. the pupil has a large dynamic range, typically from 7.5\u20138 mm diameter at full mydriasis to 1.5\u20132 mm diameter at full miosis. it is controlled by the antagonistic actions of the iris sphincter and dilator muscles. pupillogram (blue line) and associated PLR parameters. the light stimulus at time zero results in a rapid reduction in pupil diameter. the pupil rapidly constricts (maximal constriction velocity; MCV) from the baseline pupil diameter to the minimum (Dmin) pupil diameter. the pupil quickly redilates or \u201cescapes\u201d to a partially constricted state during a prolonged light stimulus lasting from 1\u20132 up to 100 s, before slowly redilating to the initial size. both outer and inner photoreceptors contribute to the early sustained post-illumination pupil response (PIPR; 1.7 s post-stimulus) parasympathetic neurons integrate the light stimulus to produce a pupil contraction. the response latency, maximum constriction and pupil escape are dependent on the actions of the sphincter muscle. both MCV and RCA parameters are dependent on the baseline pupil diameter in healthy individuals. the somata of the neurons are in three cellular layers. the horizontal cell, bipolar cell and amacrine cell somas are located in the inner nuclear layer (INL) there are also ON and OFF bands of melanopsin dendrites from the ipRGCs. retinal ganglion cell subtypes synapse with the corresponding retinal ganglion cell (RGC) in the non-cholinergic regions of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) neurotransmission also occurs within the IPL and outer plexiform layer (OPL) via amacrine and horizontal cells, respectively, and is critical in shaping the spatial and temporal aspects of photopic and scotopic vision. parasympathetic nervous system is the main system responsible for pupil constriction in response to light. the integrated afferent input is transmitted along the axons of the retinal ganglion cells (RGC), which contribute to the optic nerve. at the optic chiasm, nerves from the nasal retina cross to the contralateral side. pretectal nuclei project to either the ipsilateral or contralateral Edinger\u2013Westphal (EW) nucleus within the oculomotor nuclear complex. they contain pre-ganglionic parasympathetic parasympathetic neurons that control the iris sphincter. unilateral light stimulation causes an equal direct and consensual pupillary constriction. parasympathetic innervation of pupil sphincter is suppressed by supranuclear inhibition via central sympathetic neurons. iris dilator muscle contracts via excitation of the 1-adrenergic sympathetic pathway. sympathetic influence on iris dilator muscle consists of a paired three-neuron arc. post-ganglionic neuron ascends from the ciliospinal centre of Budge to synapse with the post-ganglionic neuron at the superior cervical ganglion. long ciliary (post-ganglionic) nerves innervate the contraction of the iris dilator muscles via a release of noradrenaline at the neuromuscular junction, resulting in pupil dilation. the sympathetic influence on the iris dilator muscle consists of ympathetic neurons that integrate the light stimulus to produce a pupil contraction are dependent on the actions of the sphincter muscle and on the function of retinal photoreceptors. both MCV and RCA parameters are dependent on the baseline pupil diameter in healthy individuals. the horizontal cell, bipolar cell and amacrine cell somas are located in the inner nuclear layer (INL), while the ganglion cell somata are located in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) the axon terminals of the bipolar cells stratify at different depths of the inner plexiform layer, which is subdivided into the OFF outer sublamina (where OFF bipolar cells terminate) and the ON inner sublamina (where ON bipolar cells the third photoreceptor, ipRGC, accounts for approximately 1% of the total RGCs [28,29,30] these cells have a role in non-image-forming visual processes, such as circadian photoentrainment, as well as in the PLR [31,32,33]. ipRGCs regulate pupil size through the integration of extrinsic signals from rods and cones but also through intrinsic (melanopsin) phototransduction [12]. axons of the retinal ganglion cells contribute to the optic nerve. at the optic chiasm, nerves from the nasal retina cross to the contralateral side. pretectal neurons are projected either ipsilaterally or contralaterally to the Edinger-Westphal nucleus. pre-ganglionic parasympathetic neurons control the iris sphincter. the bilateral neuron projection results in a double decussation of pupillary fibres, first at the optic chiasm and then within the pretectal area. unilateral light stimulation causes an equal direct and consensual pupillary constriction. the parasympathetic innervation of the pupil sphincter is suppressed by supranuclear inhibition via central sympathetic neurons. these sympathetic neurons primarily originate in the reticular activating formation in the brainstem. iris dilator muscle contracts via excitation of the 1-adrenergic sympathetic pathway. this peripheral sympathetic nerve activation greatly enhances the dynamics of pupil dilation in terms of speed and maximum pupil diameter attained. ciliary nerves travel to and innervate the contraction of the iris dilator muscles via a release of noradrenaline (NA) at the neuromuscular junction, resulting in pupil dilation. the sympathetic influence on the iris dilator muscle consists of a paired, three-neuron arc on both the right and left side of the central and peripheral nervous system. cholinergic hypofunction is a significant component of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases, which are due to ACh and dopamine deficiencies. cholinergic hypofunction is a significant component of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases, which are due to cholinergic hypofunction. the MCV are the best PLR predictors to discriminate between healthy individuals and patients with Alzheimer\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s disease [57,72]. a significant increase in latency has been observed for subjects with Parkinson\u2019s disease [57,58,59], however, this was not observed consistently in those with Alzheimer\u2019s disease [54,56,72]. manual examination using a penlight is subject to large inter-examiner discrepancies that can be as high as 40%, particularly when pupils are constricted. this may be further confounded by alcohol, narcotics or hypothermia, common to many trauma patients. a light stimulus wavelength of 530 nm and a duration of 100 ms with a light intensity of 63.1 cd/m2 are used. the differences are characterised by longer latency, reduced constriction amplitude and reduced constriction velocity [61] compared to children with a sibling with ASD. pupillometry may provide a rapid and non-invasive diagnostic tool for infants and children with a high risk of ASD or other cholinergic-dependent neurological development disorders. 5.4. Alcohol and Recreational Drugs Pupillometry offers a reliable and convenient tool for illicit drug and alcohol screening [110,111,112]. prolonged latency and decreased constriction velocity parameters were described for participants undergoing alcohol withdrawal. reduction in parasympathetic innervation likely to be due to increased activation of the locus coeruleus, as previously described during alcohol withdrawal. botulinum toxins block the release of ACh at neuromuscular junctions, post-ganglionic parasympathetic nerve endings, and post-ganglionic sympathetic nerve endings that release Ach. this may result in transient pupil dilation and attenuation of the PLR by uptake of BTx into the parasympathetic ciliary ganglion or the parasympathetic neuromuscular junctions at the iris sphincter muscle. sarin and cyclosarin required to produce miosis were up to 30 and 135-fold lower. the threshold dose required to attenuate the PLR is similar to that required to produce miosis. however, the recovery of pupil size is attributed to desensitisation of muscarinic receptors rather than reactivation of cholinesterases within the eye. organophosphates inactivate cholinesterases at both muscarinic and nicotinic receptor sites. pupil dilation or mydriasis may occur in certain circumstances due to dominant nicotinic effects at the pre-ganglionic fibres of the sympathetic nervous system. the brain monitors and modulates immune status through both humoural and neural pathways. changes to cholinergic signalling are likely to influence the PLR both directly, through ACh receptors located on iris sphincter muscles and indirectly, through altered parasympathetic nervous system function. cholinergic hypofunction is a significant component of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases, which are due to ACh and dopamine deficiencies. the MCA and secondarily the MCV are the best PLR predictors to discriminate between healthy individuals and patients with Alzheimer\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s disease [57,72]. a significant increase in latency has been observed for subjects with Parkinson\u2019s disease [57,58,59]. however, this was not observed consistently in those with Alzheimer\u2019s disease [54,56,72]. cholinergic system is key to normal pre- and postnatal neurodevelopment. cholinergic system is key to normal pre- and postnatal neurodevelopment. cholinergic system is key to normal pre- and postnatal neurodevelopment. cholinergic system is key to normal pre- and postnatal neurodevelopment. an atypical PLR is reported in both children and adults with ASD [60,98,99,100]. the differences are characterised by longer latency, reduced constriction amplitude and reduced constriction velocity [61] compared to children without ASD. pupillometry may provide a rapid and non-invasive diagnostic tool for infants and children with a high risk of ASD or other cholinergic-dependent neurological development disorders. 5.4. Alcohol and Recreational Drugs Pupillometry offers a reliable and convenient tool for illicit drug and alcohol screening. the reduction in parasympathetic innervation of the pupil is likely to be due to increased activation of the locus coeruleus. the reduction in parasympathetic innervation of the pupil is likely to be due to increased activation of the locus coeruleus, as previously described during alcohol withdrawal. chromatic pupillometry studies showed a significant increase in pupil diameter and peak constriction amplitude following a 600 nm wavelength light stimulus at exhaled breath alcohol concentrations of 0.25 mg/L. however, following a high dose of alcohol the opposite was observed, with significant decreases in pupil diameter, constriction amplitude and velocity compared to control groups. this suggests inhibition of parasympathetic nerve activity during alcohol withdrawal. riasis and a reduction in the PLR recovery time are conflicting reports. for cannabis intoxication there are conflicting reports regarding the effect of the drug on baseline pupil diameter. however, for cannabis intoxication there are conflicting reports regarding the effect of the drug on the PLR. mydriasis with an attenuated PLR is a consequence of ingesting contaminated food. organophosphates inhibit cholinesterase activity, resulting in increased levels of ACh at the nerve synapses. the majority of cholinesterase inhibition observed within the eye is a result of the nerve agent vapour acting directly on the ocular tissues. the recovery of pupil size is attributed to desensitisation of the muscarinic receptors rather than reactivation of cholinesterases within the eye. oximes, which reactivate acetylcholinesterase, had no effect on sarin-induced miosis in animal models. however, organophosphates inactivate cholinesterases at both muscarinic and nicotinic receptor sites. the locus coeruleus exerts a dual influence on the PLR, ultimately leading to pupil dilation [157,158] changes to cholinergic signalling are likely to influence the PLR both directly, through ACh receptors located on iris sphincter muscles and indirectly, through altered parasympathetic nervous system function. limiting factors should be considered as covariates or exclusion criteria in PLR studies to enable inter-study comparisons. however, the ease of use, non-invasive nature and low cost mean pupillometry is well-placed for inclusion in early diagnostic screening assessments."}
