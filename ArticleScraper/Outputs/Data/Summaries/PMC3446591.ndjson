{"summary": "a new human coronavirus of zoonotic origin emerged in southern china in 2003. the new virus, called SARS-coronavirus (CoV), exhibited extraordinary pathogenicity with a high mortality rate. the virus, which normally causes slight diseases of the upper respiratory or gastrointestinal tract, is capable of crossing species barriers. the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is part of the cellular degradation machinery. degradation via the proteasome is highly regulated and for recognition, substrates must be covalently modified with multiple molecules of the small 76-amino-acid protein ubiquitin (6). for this reason, viruses have evolved mechanisms to exploit the UPS for viral benefit. replication of another coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus, is impaired if the proteasome is inhibited. a general dependence of coronaviral replication on a functional ubiquitin proteasome pathway was suggested. however, in vivo studies showed that treatment with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib of mice infected with MHV-A59 actually led to increased viral titers and pathology. inhibition of calpain, a protease which is inhibited by MG132, impaired viral replication. m-calpain knockdown experiments further confirmed that loss of m-calpain activity strongly reduces production of SARS-CoV particles.

MG132 treatment impairs initial steps of viral replication in cells without harming viral particles before adsorption. MG132 treatment induces autophagy in vero E6 cells. DMSO, 2.5m MG132, and imatinib, a known inducer of autophagy, were treated for 16 h. MG132 induced the formation of LC3-II nearly to the same extent as the positive-control imatinib (8-fold) values represent the means SEM of two independent experiments performed in triplicate. MG132 and imatinib were pretreated with DMSO (mock), 2.5 M MG132 or 10 M imatinib for 1 h and were inoculated with SARS-CoV. wild-type (wt) and ATG5/ huACE2 MEFs were left untreated. after 1 h, cells were infected with SARS-CoV and incubated for 16 h. this was the case for transfected Atg5/ huACE2 MEFs. this was also the case for transfected Atg5/ huACE2 MEFs. equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE. LC3-I/II signals were determined by immunoblotting using an anti-ACE2 antibody. values represent means SEM of one experiment performed in triplicate. MG132 has been described to impair the cysteine protease m-calpain (64). this assumption is affirmed by the fact that MG132 also affects m-calpain (64). vero E6 cells were pretreated with DMSO (mock), 2.5 M MG132, 5 M CI VI, or 10 MDL28170 for 1 h and then inoculated with SARS-CoV (MOI, 0.001) in FCS-free media. after removal of inocula, cells were incubated in growth medium supplemented with FCS and the respective compounds for 16 h. transfected Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV. siRNA knockdown of the cysteine protease m-calpain reduced titers more than 90%. ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is of superior importance for eukaryotic cells operating as a major protein degradation machinery. vero E6 cells were treated with DMSO (mock) or 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5 M MG132 for 1 h. cells were treated in media with FCS for 16 h before cell-free viral supernatants were collected. values represent the means standard errors of the means (SEM) of two independent experiments performed in duplicate. DMSO (mock), 2.5 M MG132, 5 or 10 M lactacystin for 1 h and inoculated with MHV-JHM. cells were treated in media with FCS for 16 h before cell-free viral supernatants were collected. titers were determined by plaque assay as described for SARS-CoV experiments. treatment with proteasomal inhibitors significantly induced BiP expression compared to mock-treated cells. polyubiquitinated proteins were induced with a 2.5- to 3.5-fold increase. it has been demonstrated that replication of MHV is dependent on proteasome function (72) viral particle production was determined in time course experiments. infected cells were lysed to determine intracellular levels of viral nucleocapsid protein. MG132 treatment strongly induced BiP expression during infection. vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV at an MOI of 0.001 for 10 min in media without FCS. after removal of inocula, cells were grown in normal growth medium and viral supernatants were collected at 0, 8, and 16 h p.i. treatment with DMSO or MG132 was continued for 15 min. cells were washed with PBS, triedpsinated, and disrupted. previous experiments had revealed that virus is internalized within 15 min. a replication cycle from adsorption to release of infectious progeny takes 7 to 8 h. iter production, treatment during later steps of the viral life cycle (2 to 4 h) had a much weaker or even no effect during the latest time frame of 4 to 6 h. we incubated virus with cell-free medium alone or with MG132. subsequent titer analysis revealed no differences. reduction of viral titers is caused by rapid degradation of virus upon fusion of endosomes with autophagosomes. vero E6 cells were treated for 16 h with DMSO, MG132, and imatinib, a known inducer of autophagy, as a positive control. MG132 treatment induces autophagy in vero E6 cells. equal amounts of total protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE. LC3-I and -II signals were determined using an anti-LC3 antibody. values represent the means SEM of one experiment performed in triplicate. effective transfection and expression was confirmed by immunoblot analysis 24 and 48 h after transfection. wild-type (wt) and ATG5/ huACE2 MEFs were left untreated. after 1 h, cells were infected with SARS-CoV and incubated for 16 h. this was the case for transfected Atg5/ huACE2 MEFs. LC3-I/II signal in wild-type (wt; right side) and ATG5/ (left side) MEFs were treated with DMSO, 2.5 M MG132, or 10 M imatinib for 16 h. equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE. MG132 has been described to impair the cysteine protease m-calpain. despite effective impairment of proteasomal activity, only MG132 had a strong inhibitory effect on viral titer. vero E6 cells were pretreated with DMSO (mock), 2.5 M MG132, 5 M CI VI, or 10 M MDL28170 for 1 h. after removal of inocula, cells were incubated in growth medium supplemented with FCS and the respective compounds for 16 h. viral supernatants were collected. transfected vero E6 cells were transfected with siRNA targeting m-calpain or nonsilencing siRNA. siRNA knockdown of the cysteine protease m-calpain reduced SARS-CoV titers more than 90%. MG132 does not impair viral particle production by affecting the ubiquitin-proteasome system. inhibition of m-calpain rather than inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is responsible for inhibition of SARS-CoV replication. MG132 strongly inhibits early steps of SARS-CoV replication independent of proteasomal impairment. the ubiquitin-proteasome system, with its degradative and regulatory responsibilities, is essential for cell function. effects on this recombinant SARS-CoV were less prominent than effects on MHV or FIPV. at similar BZ concentrations, we found a reduction of SARS-CoV titers of 0.5 log, which correlate with a 50% reduction of PFU/ml. discrepancy between the former study (46) and our results might be explained by the different viruses used (SARS-CoV-GFP with deleted ORF7a/b [56] versus MG132 is a process shared by all eukaryotic cells by which long-lived proteins, aggresomes, or whole organelles are engulfed by double membrane vesicles. autophagy is a process shared by all eukaryotic cells by which long-lived proteins, aggresomes, or whole organelles are engulfed by double membrane vesicles. induction of autophagy with imatinib (13) did not affect SARS-CoV replication. both wild-type and autophagy-deficient (ATG5/) huACE2 MEFs (31) were equally susceptible to SARS-CoV infection. a lack of autophagy is not beneficial for viral replication. m-calpain is associated with cellular membranes, vesicles, subcellular organelles, or lipid rafts. formation of the echovirus 1 RC strongly depends on m-calpain activity. formation of the echovirus 1 RC might also depend on m-calpain activity. calpain inhibitors represent a promising tool to fight SARS-CoV infection. MG132 strongly inhibits early steps of SARS-CoV replication independent of proteasomal impairment. several proteasome inhibitors, including Lac, had similar effects on viral replication. MHV-A59 strain led to an increase of viral titers and enhanced disease. some strain differences in the effects of proteasomal inhibition on MHV replication in vitro have been discussed. MG132 exerts unparalleled capability among tested proteasomal inhibitors in impairing early steps of SARS-CoV replication. MG132 does not inhibit SARS-CoV replication by induction of ER stress, the unfolded protein response, or autophagy. y facilitates antigen presentation, type I interferon production, or xenophagy (29) work by Lai's group had shown that upon treatment with MG132, MHV virions were retained in endosomes and possibly degraded by fusion of these endosomes with lysosomal vesicles (72). however, induction of autophagy with imatinib (13) did not affect SARS-CoV replication, and both wild- MG132 blocks SARS-CoV replication because it inhibits m-calpain. m-calpain is associated with cellular membranes, vesicles, subcellular organelles, or lipid rafts. MG132 and MDL28170 also inhibit cathepsin L-mediated processing of viral glycoproteins. inhibition of cathepsin L by the chemical inhibitors, in addition to inhibition of m-calpain, may increase their significant effect on SARS-CoV replication. results obtained upon m-calpain knockdown indicate an important role of m-calpain for SARS-CoV replication."}
