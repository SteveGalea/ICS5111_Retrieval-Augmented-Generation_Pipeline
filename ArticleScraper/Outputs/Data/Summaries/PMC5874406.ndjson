{"summary": "positive-strand RNA viruses rearrange the membranes of intracellular organelles. they rearrange the membranes of intracellular organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the ER-Golgi apparatus, the ER-Golgi apparatus intermediate compartment, endosomes, and mitochondria. this process involves viral and host proteins, as well as cellular lipids (1\u20133) a model is proposed in which the viral protein 3A binds to brefeldin A resistance guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1)/ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) to recruit PI4KB to the Golgi/trans-Golgi network. PI4P binds to viral RNA polymerase 3D to initiate and facilitate viral RNA synthesis. ACBD3 interacts with PI4KB to form a viral protein/ACBD3/PI4KB complex that produces PI4P at the sites of RNA replication (23). ACBD3 is not necessary for CVB3 and rhinovirus RNA replication (26, 30), while it facilitates enterovirus 71 replication (27). OSBP transfers cholesterol from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and transfers PI4P back at the membrane contact sites (MCSs) PITPNB binds to the PI and transfers it from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (39). PITPNB binds to the PI and transfers it from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (25). PITPNB has been reported to be involved in rhinovirus infection (25). depletion of OSBP decreased AiV RNA replication to 18% of control levels at 9 h after transfection. depletion of VAPA and VAPB decreased AiV RNA replication to 54 and 90%, respectively, of control levels at 9 h after transfection. Knockdown of SAC1 also decreased AiV RNA replication, albeit less effectively than that of OSBP or VAP-A/B. maximum value obtained for nontargeting control siRNA-treated cells was taken as 100%. the experiment was repeated at least three times. the error bars indicate standard deviations (SD) OSBP, VAP-A/B, and SAC1 were colocalized with viral proteins 2B, 2C, and 3A (Fig. 2A, B, D, and E). OSBP and VAP-A/B were colocalized with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) calnexin and calregulin are not recruited to viral RNA replication sites. we tested whether OSBP, VAP-A/B, and SAC1 interact with the AiV proteins 2B, 2BC, 2C, 3A, and 3AB. both VAPA and VAPB could interact with 2B, 2BC, 2C, 3A, and 3AB, but not with L, an AiV nonstructural protein not localized at RNA replication sites. proteins were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-FLAG antibody or control IgG. resulting immunoprecipitates and whole-cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting. resulting immunoprecipitates and whole-cell lysates were detected by anti-HA antibodies. coimmunoprecipitation of VAP-A/B, SAC1, and OSBP with ACBD3 was not detected. previous studies have demonstrated that the AiV proteins 2B, 2BC, 2C, 3A, and 3AB bind to ACBD3. the cell lysates were analyzed as described for Fig. 4D to F. ACBD3 induces Golgi apparatus localization of VAP-A/B or SAC1. the localizations of tagged VAP-A/B and ACBD3 were reminiscent of those of endogenously expressed proteins. OSBP can be recruited to AiV RNA replication sites independently of PI4P. at AiV RNA replication sites, a viral protein/ACBD3/PI4KB complex is formed to produce PI4P. colocalization of OSBP with the viral proteins is independent of PI4K-produced PI4P. OSBP can be recruited to AiV RNA replication sites in a PI4P-independent manner. 2B, 2C, 3A, or ACBD3 were expressed in vero cells individually. cells coexpressing FLAG-OSBP with HA-ACBD3 and 2B, 2C or 3A were triple stained with anti-FLAG, anti-HA, and anti-2B, or anti-3A antibodies. CERT also binds to VAP and PI4P and transfers ceramide from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. CERT lacked definite ability to bind to the viral proteins and ACBD3. CERT was not recruited to the AiV RNA replication sites. the results are represented as described for Fig. 4A to C. replicon-transfected cells were stained with filipin, a fluorescent cholesterol-binding polyene antibiotic, for cholesterol and with various antibodies. filipin could clearly form foci with ACBD3 and OSBP in AiV RNA-replicating cells. similar observations were made with VAPA and VAPB. vero cells cultured in lipid-free FBS-supplemented medium with (F) or without (E) 25-HC were mock transfected or transfected with pCMV-polyprotein. after 24 h, the cells were fixed and stained with filipin III and the indicated antibodies. membrane flotation analysis of replicon-transfected cells in presence of nonidet P-40. NP-40-treated homogenate of replicon-transfected cells shifted to soluble fraction. viral proteins 2B, 2BC, 2C, and 3A are associated with detergent-resistant membrane. the typical Golgi apparatus cisternae were not found in replicon-transfected cells at 6 h. we observed two types of structures in the cytoplasm in RNA-transfected cells. the first type of AiV-induced structure was single-membrane vesicle-like structures 200 to 400 nm in diameter. the second was 150- to 200-nm vesicle-like structures with unclear shapes. mediated cholesterol transport pathway operates between the ER and AiV ROs. clusters of AiV-induced membrane structures are boxed. higher-magnification images of areas in box 1 and box 2 are shown. iV RNA replication to 18% of control levels at 9 h after transfection. silencing of VAP-A/B decreased replication to 7%. Knockdown of PITPNB also decreased AiV RNA replication to 49% at 10 h after transfection. Western blots for levels of OSBP (A), VAP-A/B (B), SAC1 (C) or PITPNB (D) and -tubulin in vero cells treated with the indicated siRNAs for 72 h. for detection, rabbit antibodies against OSBP, VAP-A/B, SAC1, and PITPNB and mouse antibody against -tubulin were used. OSBP, VAP-A/B, and SAC1 are present at AiV RNA replication sites. calnexin (A) and calregulin (B) are not recruited to viral RNA replication sites. OSBP, VAP-A/B, and SAC1 are colocalized with dsRNA. hybrid analyses revealed that both VAPA and VAPB could interact with 2B, 2BC, 2C, 3A, and 3AB. but not with L, an AiV nonstructural protein that is not localized at RNA replication sites. 2B, 2BC, 2C, 3A, and 3AB, but not L, were associated with VAP-A/B. whole-cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting (IB) with anti-HA antibodies. resulting immunoprecipitates and whole-cell lysates were detected by anti-HA and anti-HA antibodies. SAC1 was also revealed to interact with the viral proteins by M2H analysis. the interactions of OSBP, VAPA, VAPB, and SAC1 with ACBD3 caused 30-, 277-, 241-, and 171-fold increases. the results suggest interactions of OSBP, VAP-A/B, and SAC1 with ACBD3. HA-ACBD3 was expressed individually in vero cells and immunostained with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies. the localizations of tagged VAP-A/B and ACBD3 were reminiscent of those of endogenously expressed proteins (Fig. 2). a viral protein/ACBD3/PI4KB complex is formed to produce PI4P. OSBP can be recruited to RNA replication sites in a PI4P-independent manner. vero cells were mock transfected or transfected with pCMV-polyprotein. they were then cultured in medium with or without 5 M T00127-HEV1. at 24 h after transfection, the cells were fixed and stained with the indicated antibodies. 2C were expressed individually and then immunostained with anti-FLAG, anti-HA, and anti-2B, or anti-3A antibodies. a similar analysis was performed on CERT, which also binds to VAP and PI4P and transfers ceramide from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. CERT is not recruited to the AiV RNA replication sites. a mammalian two-hybrid analysis was performed to determine interactions between CERT and 2B, 2BC, 2C, 3A, 3AB, or ACBD3. the results are represented as described for Fig. 4A to C. filipin could clearly form foci with ACBD3 and OSBP in AiV RNA-replicating cells. similar observations were made with VAPA and VAPB. after 24 h, the cells were fixed and stained with filipin III and the indicated antibodies. the culture medium was treated with 25-HC, a high-affinity ligand of OSBP that inhibits cholesterol transfer by OSBP. the addition of 25-HC significantly reduced the replication of the AiV replicon by 92% at 6 h after transfection. homogenate of replicon-transfected cells was treated or not with 1% NP-40 for 1 h on ice. fractions were subjected to immunoblotting to analyze indicated proteins. aiV-induced membrane structures are located in the vicinity of the ER membrane. the typical Golgi apparatus cisternae were not found in replicon-transfected cells at 6 h. we observed two types of structures in the cytoplasm in AiV RNA-transfected cells. the first type of AiV-induced structure was single-membrane vesicle-like structures 200 to 400 nm in diameter. the second was 150- to 200-nm vesicle-like structures with unclear shapes clusters of AiV-induced structures are boxed. higher-magnification images of areas shown in panels B and C. the cholesterol transport pathway works at the RO-ER MCS. it is known for picornaviruses and HCV that cholesterol is accumulated at viral RNA replication sites by hijacking the OSBP-mediated cholesterol transport pathway. the new protein-protein interactions recruit not only OSBP to PI4P on the RO, but also the components of the system, VAP-A/B and SAC1. PI4P-independent and protein-protein interaction-based recruitment of OSBP to viral RNA replication sites will promote the selective recruitment of OSBP, among PI4P-binding proteins, to PI4P on ROs to facilitate cholesterol accumulation. the recruitment of OSBP to viral RNA replication sites is dependent on PI4K activity or PI4P (25, 37, 38, 48) interactions between OSBP, VAP-A/B, and SAC1 have previously been shown. in uninfected cells, ACBD3 forms a giantin/ACBD3/PI4KB complex. ACBD3 plays a critical role in the Golgi apparatus recruitment of PI4KB. the previous study of rhinovirus demonstrated involvement of VAP-B in viral RNA replication by analysis using siRNA (25) the present study is the first one exploring in detail the involvement of VAP-A/B in picornavirus RNA replication. PI4P may recruit some PI4P-binding proteins, but 2B (and possibly 2BC) enables the PI4P-independent recruitment of OSBP. the viral proteins and ACBD3 facilitate the recruitment of VAP-A/B to OSBP. PI4P production by PI4K at the Golgi apparatus, PI4P dephosphorylation by SAC1 at the ER, and PI transport by PITP provide the energy driving the OSBP-mediated cholesterol transfer. both VP and ACBD3 can directly interact with OSBP, VAP-A/B, and SAC1. further research is required to clarify the alteration of intracellular membranes that occurred in enterovirus-infected cells. the local lipid composition generates membrane curvature (55). Accumulation of cholesterol and PI4P may be involved in membrane curvature. the plasmid pCI-HA-ACBD3 was constructed by replacing the FLAG tag sequence inserted into the NheI/MluI sites of pCI-FLAG-ACBD3 (23) with the HA tag sequence. pACT- and pBIND-ACBD3 and pBIND-PI4KB were described previously (23). the coding regions of VAPA and VAPB cloned were 249 and 243 amino acids (aa), respectively, in length. pACT- and pBIND-VAPA and pBIND-VAPB were obtained by PCR using pCI-FLAG-VAPA and pBIND-VAPB. the amplicon was digested with MluI and SalI and then cloned into the pCI vector containing a FLAG tag sequence. the 3\u2032 half of the OSBP-coding sequence (the XbaI-BamHI [blunt ended]-XbaI fragment of pLEGFP-N1-hOSBP) was cloned to the EcoRV-XbaI sites of pACT and pBIND the amplicon was digested with XbaI and cloned into the XbaI-SmaI sites of the pCI mammalian expression vector (Promega) containing a FLAG tag sequence between the NheI and MluI sites, generating pCI-FLAG-CERT. the coding sequence of SAC1 was amplified by PCR using following primer pair: Mlu-SAC1-Fw (5\u2032 CI-FLAG-cassette was digested with MluI and NotI and cloned into the corresponding sites in pACT-SAC1. rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-ACBD3 antibody, and mouse monoclonal IgM anti-PI4P were described previously. aa 132 to 225 were amplified from pACT-VAPB using the primers Bam-VAPA-415Fw (5\u2032-AAGGATCCTTGAATGATATGGAACCTAGC-3\u2032) and Sal-VAPB-696Rv (5\u2032-AAAGTCGACTTAAAGAGAGAGG-3\u2032) and cloned into pGEX-6P3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) was used to transfect siRNA-treated cells with the replicon RNA. control siRNA (On-Target Plus nontargeting siRNA 1) and siRNAs (On-Target Plus Smart Pool siRNA) were purchased from Dharmacon. cells were grown in medium with 3.1 M 25-HC for 24 h prior to and after transfection with pCMV-polyprotein. all images were acquired using a fluorescence microscope (Keyence BZ-8000) cell viability was determined using the cellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) plasmid pCMV-polyprotein expresses the AiV polyprotein under the control of the CMV promoter in mammalian cells. plasmids pCI-HA-L, -2B, -2C, -2BC, -3A, and -3AB were described previously (23). plasmid pCI-HA-ACBD3 was constructed by replacing the FLAG tag sequence inserted into the NheI/MluI sites of pACT- and pBIND-ACBD3 and pACT- and pBIND-PI4KB were described previously (23). pCI-FLAG-VAPA and pBIND-PI4KB were described previously (23). pCI-FLAG-VAPA and pCI-FLAG-VAPB-coding regions were amplified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. the amplicon was digested with MluI and cloned into the pCI vector containing a FLAG tag sequence, generating pCI-FLAG-OSBP. the 3\u2032 half of the OSBP-coding sequence (the XbaI-BamHI [blunt ended] fragment of pLEGFP-N1) was cloned into the XbaI-NotI sites of pACT and pBIND. sacI [blunt ended]-XbaI fragment of pLEGFP-N1-hOSBP was cloned to the EcoRV-XbaI sites of pACT and pBIND. the resultant fragment containing the human CERT (hCERT)-coding sequence was cloned between the BamHI and KpnI sites of pACT and pBIND, generating pACT- and pBIND-CERT pCI-FLAG-ACBD3 (23) was digested with MluI and NotI and then cloned into the corresponding sites in pACT-SAC1, generating pCI-FLAG-SAC1. pCI-FLAG-cassette was digested with pACT and pBIND, yielding pACT- and pBIND-SAC1. pCI-FLAG-cassette was digested Rabbit polyclonal anti-OSBP, anti-VAPA, and anti-VAPB antibodies were purchased from Atlas Antibodies. rabbit polyclonal anti-PITPNB antibody (ab102983) was purchased from Abcam. rabbit polyclonal anti-CERT antibody was purchased from Sigma. the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli cells as described in the manufacturer's protocol. antibodies against these proteins were raised in guinea pigs. coimmunoprecipitation assays and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (23, 29). for filipin III staining, vero cells were cultured in medium containing 5% lipid-free fetal bovine serum for 24 h, followed by electroporation with replicon RNA or transfection with pCMV-polyprotein. vero cells were mock transfected or transfected with AV-FL-Luc-5\u2032rzm RNA. the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2), incubated for 15 min on ice, and then passed through a 26-gauge needle 15 times. each aliquot was mixed with sample preparation and electron microscopy were performed as described previously (65)."}
