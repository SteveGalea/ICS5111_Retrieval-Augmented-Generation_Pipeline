{"summary": "samples from patients included plasma, throat swab, sputum, and stool. the samples were stored at \u201370\u00b0C for extraction of viral RNA. a total of 64 RNA samples from 28 SARS-CoV\u2013positive patients were initially used in S-gene amplification. RNA extraction was performed in a biosafety level 3 (P3) laboratory. RNA was extracted directly from plasma samples. sputum samples were shaken for 30 min with equal volume of 1.0% acetylcysteine. of primers were designed by using macVactor computer software (Accelrys Inc, San Diego, CA) based on the BJ01 strain of SARS-CoV. six pairs (sense/antisense: S1bF/S1bB, S2bF/S2bB, S3bF/S3bB, S4bF/S4bB, S5bF/S5bB, S6bF/S6bB) were thermal cycling consisted of 30 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 25 s, 54\u00b0C for 25 s, 72\u00b0C for 50 s. transcript III RNase H\u2013 Reverse Transcriptase was used for reverse transcription. reaction condition was set as above, with a twofold elongation at 68\u00b0C instead of 72\u00b0C. the recombinant plasmids for sampling sequence analysis were screened by electrophoresis in 1% agarose containing 0.5 g/mL of ethidium bromide. to verify variations, 5\u201350 additional clones generated from independently prepared, RNA-derived RT-PCR products were sequenced in two to four independent experiments. 29 RNA samples from 20 patients were included in the study. all patients had received ribavirin and steroid combination therapy. all patients had received ribavirin and steroid combination therapy. RNA extraction was performed in a biosafety level 3 (P3) laboratory. RNA was extracted directly from plasma samples. sputum samples were shaken for 30 min with an equal volume of 1.0% acetylcysteine. the sequences covering the full-length S gene were amplified separately as six overlapping fragments (F1b, F2b, F3b, F4b, F5b, and F6b) the one-step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) was used for reverse transcription. TA-Cloning RT-PCR products were purified by QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) the reaction condition was set as above, with a twofold elongation at 68\u00b0C instead of 72\u00b0C. all reactions were carefully carried out to avoid contamination. analysis and comparison of nucleotide and amino acid sequences were carried out with the DNASTAR computer software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI). the S gene sequence of BJ01 strain was taken as the reference for variation analysis. the occurrence indicates the frequency of the variant nucleotide at the given site of the identified 29 entire S genes. the occurrence indicates the frequency of the variant nucleotide at the given site of the identified 29 entire S genes. a replicating RNA virus expresses a range of genetic and phenotypic variants and has the potential to generate novel virions. sequences with and without substitutions were simultaneously detected in the sequences from seven samples. this suggests the existence of SARS-CoV quasispecies. a dynamic mutational process may exist in vivo. results were determined by analysis of cloned sequences. + represents that nucleotide substitution at the variant site is detected. \u2013 represents that the nucleotide at the site is identical to the one of BJ01 reference sequence in all analyzed sequences. 23G is within the heptad repeat domains, which is thought to be important for virus entry. previous study on MHV showed that it would have some effect on virus infection. however, further experiments need to be addressed in the near future. sites in the S gene of coronavirus and possible existence of SARS-CoV quasispecies in some patients. this knowledge furthers our understanding of this emerging virus."}
