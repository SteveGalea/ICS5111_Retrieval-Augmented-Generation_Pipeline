{"summary": "meningitis can present acutely or chronically with less severe symptoms over a prolonged period. it can present acutely or chronically with less severe symptoms over a prolonged period. the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) often presents with leukocytosis. most common causes in healthy adults are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcal disease) and Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcal disease) in neonates, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS) Listeria monocytogenes and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are the prevalent pathogenic serogrouping of most meningitis-associated strains is conducted using a range of methods e.g., culture, serology and immunological tests at reference laboratories [14] and more latterly sequencing [32], however there is still a need for harmonization of methodologies between laboratories [33]. microarrays are highly amenable to multiplexing, obviating the need for multiple tests per patient [37,38], with the potential for saving time and cost. groups developed low-complexity diagnostic microarrays for identification of microorganisms in water and food samples. they have also been developed for detection of pathogens in clinical material based on genus and/or species-specific oligonucleotide probes designed from database gene sequence alignments. similar methodologies have been used by these and other groups to identify meningitis-associated and emerging pathogens. colonies were cultured overnight on 5% horse blood/brain heart infusion agar plates at 37 \u00b0C. colonies were isolated and resuspended in 200 L Tris EDTA Glucose buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 2% glucose), then 500 L guanidine hydrochloride lysis buffer (8 M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.2% sodium sarkinosate) was added the pellet fraction was resuspended in 200 L of TE buffer prior to further processing. nucleic acids from each pellet and supernatant fraction were then purified using the Qiagen QIAamp DNA mini kit. oligonucleotides probes with greater than 90% sequence identity with other closely-related bacterial gene sequences were excluded. the relative melting temperatures (Tm) of each probe was calculated and those with a Tm of 60 8 \u00b0C were selected. the suitability of the selected probes for their use as discriminatory probes was assessed. slides were diluted to a final concentration of 20 M in 1.5 saline-sodium citrate buffer (SSC) 25% dimethyl sulfoxide and 0.005% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulphate. the slides were then air-dried, baked at 80 \u00b0C for 2 h and stored with desiccant prior to use. etix Inc., Wallsend, UK), then incubated at 50 \u00b0C for 16 h. the slides were then washed once in each of the following buffers for two minutes. labelled targets DNAs denatured at 95 \u00b0C for 3 min, then diluted to a final concentration of 120 g/mL in 5 SSC, 0.1% SDS, 4 Denhardts solution, 16% formamide at 50 \u00b0C. using this platform, the slides were incubated at 50 \u00b0C for six hours, at a maximum mixing power of 27. samples were sorted lowest to highest p-value and those with less than a user-defined cut-off were considered positive. pathogen species and serogroups assignations were given to each test target based on the number of significant generic, species-specific and/or serogroup-positive probes. all DNA probe sequences were synthesised and printed in ArrayTubeTM format by Alere Technologies GmbH, Jena, Germany. software provides a means for in silico modelling of multiplex amplification steps. dNTPs (excluding dUTP), 75 M dUTP and 75 M Biotin-16\u2013dUTP (New England Biolabs, USA), 0.5 L Phusion Taq, Primer Mix (0.5 M each Primer final concentration), DNA Template 5.0 L in a final volume of 50 L. labelled target hybridizations were conducted in printed ArrayTubesTM using the Alere hybridization protocol. real-time PCR assays to the meningococcal capsular transport gene ctrA were used for N. meningitidis, as previously described. these assays had previously been run in singleplex. probe fluorescence was detected in the 530 nm channel, the assay was completed at 50 cycles. all bacterial species and strains used in this study are shown in Supplementary Material S1, Table S1. purified nucleic acid samples from other nonmeningococcal bacteria were obtained from coworkers at public health England, Southampton, UK (PHES) seven CSF samples were collected initially at Public Helath England for routine testing for meningitis pathogens. phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Sigma, Dorset, UK) was added to low volume samples below the minimum extraction volume. nucleic acids were then purified using the QiaSymphony automated DNA extraction platform and the QiaSymphony virus/pathogen mini-kit. each probe was calculated and those with a Tm of 60 8 \u00b0C were selected. the suitability of the selected oligonucleotides for their use as discriminatory probes was assessed. slides were prehybridized in 5 SSC, 0.1% SDS and 4 Denhardts solution. washed in sterile, nuclease-free water, followed by 100% isopropyl alcohol. slides were then washed once in each buffer for two minutes. nonmanual hybridizations were conducted using a Advalytix SlideboosterTM hybridization (Beckman Coulter UK, High Wycombe, UK) and wash station. microarray slides were prehybridized as described for manual hybridizations then placed array side up into a Slidebooster hybridization chamber containing sonic agitation chips. lifter-slips were then placed on the slide, gasket side down and the slide left to preheat to slides were prehybridized in 5 SSC, 0.1% SDS and 4 Denhardts solution. washed in sterile, nuclease-free water, followed by 100% isopropyl alcohol. ucleotide probes were conducted using pathogen and nonpathogen labelled nucleic acids. microarray slides were prehybridized as described for manual hybridizations. they were placed in a Advalytix Slidebooster hybridization chamber containing sonic agitation chips. data was log-transformed log2() function in \u201cR\u201d. [74] to identify probes with significantly higher Fluorescence a Z-score analysis was undertaken [75] to identify probes with significantly higher Fluorescence. a selection of our preferred best performing validated detection probes were chosen for transition onto the ArrayTubeTM system. a more focused bacterial meningitis array probe set was constructed for evaluation of this form set. all DNA probe sequences were synthesised and printed in ArrayTubeTM format. control probes were uploaded into the program and modelled using default settings. final select primer pairs were assessed for specificity by comparison with database sequences using the BLAST algorithm. target nucleic acids were labelled using a targeted, noncompetitive amplification system. ArrayTubeTM incubations were performed on a Thermomixer Comfort Microtube shaking heater block. a final hybridization volume of 200 L was read immediately after incubation with substrate using an ATR03 ArrayTubeTM analyser. mean intensities from each probe spotted in duplicate were used. real-time PCR primers and probes were synthesised by Eurofins MWG Operon (Germany) all assays were validated using purified, species-specific nucleic acids, prior to use on clinical samples. significance values were calculated using the t-test function in Excel. most amplified bacterial genomic targets showed good specific binding to their relevant species-specific probes. some rogue nonspecific binding of bacterial DNAs to unrelated probes was also observed. cross-hybridization with most rogue probes was consistent. but some minor variation in cross-hybridization to nonspecific probes. all probes for nucA and cpdB exhibited good species specificity. ingococcal meningitis-associated pathogens exhibited target-specific hybridization profiles. other probes showed minimal binding or cross-hybridization with unrelated DNA targets. other probes exhibited minimal binding or cross-hybridization with unrelated DNA targets. six of nine probes specifically designed for serogroup A exhibited group serospecificity, all designed to the sacB gene. the remaining probes exhibited some cross-reactive binding to other Neisseria spp. but not other non-Neisserial species bacterial DNA targets. the human DNA control showed a high degree of cross-reactive binding to serogroup W probes NsMW1, NsMW3 and NsMW4. the majority of N. meningitidis strains exhibited a characteristic binding profile indicative of their serogroup, which may be useful for diagnostic identification. nonmeningococcal Neisseria strains were amplified, labeled, and hybridized to the pan-pathogen array. binding to generic probes Neiss 2, Neiss 1, NsMA5 and NsMB4 was observed with the N. lactamica and N. flavescens isolates. pathogen and serogroup-specific hybridization profiles could be identified using our pan-pathogen array probe set, using highly pure pathogen DNAs as template. we therefore sought to test the method on culture negative CSF samples from patients with suspected meningitis. ascribed to these samples with some degree of confidence. other samples produced data of low fluorescence binding intensity and good confidence. no pathogen-specific signals could be assigned. the results were confirmed for N. meningitidis using real-time PCR assay for the ctrA gene. the data obtained are shown in Figure 3 and Supplementary Material S7.

ND: not detected. data of low fluorescence intensity and reasonably good confidence were obtained with other samples e.g., CSF3S, CSF4P, CSF6S, CSF6P and CSF7P. pathogen-specific signals could be tentatively ascribed to these samples with some degree of confidence. eighteen CSF samples out of one hundred and forty-six tested were found to be positive for bacterial pathogens by RT-PCR. only 3/18 were positive by bacterial culture, samples 14, 90 and 145 which also showed low Ct values. haemolytic Streptococcus not isolated 21 F 22 July 2011 Ent, HSV1/2, VZV-ve N/A N/A 24 29 F 21 July 2011 Ent, HSV1/2, VZV-ve N/A N/A 34 M 28 July 2011 Ent, HSV1/2, VZV, N. meningitidis-ve no growth 18.6 1 headache, photophobia, recent trip to Gambia 61 * M 13 April 2011 AdV, RotaVirus, meningitidis-ve no growth 1 7 CRP: C-reactive protein, N/A: not available, * repeat sample from same patient. we therefore reprinted the best performing probes on the Alere ArrayTubeTM system. this was evaluated using amplified, labelled bacterial pathogen DNA targets. singleplex amplification and microarray hybridization of select, biotin-labelled amplified pathogen DNA targets. no template control singleplex amplification, no template control singleplex amplification. x hybridizations again revealed nonspecific binding to rogue probes. a number of these nonspecific hybridization events were seen previously using the glass slide printed arrays. this appears to be a technical issue as function of multiplex amplification of targets. the signal was not detected using RT-PCR, but a clear signal could be seen using microarray hybridization. the microarray may be detecting pathogen signals in the samples not detected using RT-PCR and vice versa.

ArrayTubeTM multiplex amplification hybridization image is depicted alongside the RT-PCR trace. hybridization patterns were as expected for each pathogen for both single and multiplex hybridizations, revealing nonspecific binding to rogue probes. hybridization targets were amplified from all bacterial RT-PCR-positive clinical CSFs from Table 2. a hybridization pattern was not detected using RT-PCR, but a clear signal was seen using microarray hybridization. the microarray may be detecting pathogen signals in the samples not detected using RT-PCR and vice versa. the microarray may be due to sampling errors.

ArrayTubeTM multiplex amplification hybridization images for real-time-PCR positive patient CSF samples. we previously developed a pan-pathogen microarray based on conserved and species-specific bacterial and viral sequences. we have now designed a probe set for detection of five of the most significant ABM pathogens. we included probes which would discriminate between the serogroups A, B, C, W, X, Y and Z. pathogen-specific profiles were obtained for H. influenzae, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, L. monocytogenes and all N. meningitidis strains tested. most serogroup-specific probes were highly discriminatory and were found to correctly identify all previously serogrouped strains. nonpathogenic Neisseria spp. including the commensal N. lactamica, showed binding profiles to the Neisseria generic 16S rRNA probes. these nonpathogenic Neisseria spp therefore share gene similarities with pathogenic N. meningitidis strains. randomly-amplified, labelled targets from purified nucleic acids were hybridized to the array using formamide-free manual hybridization methods. patients with suspected meningitis have been re-amplified and hybridized on a number of occasions with similar results being consistently obtained. a number of hybridization refinements were evaluated experimentally. they included prehybridization and hybridization blocks using tRNA, salmon-sperm, mouse or human DNA and two-colour hybridizations using either human or mouse amplified DNA targets. none of these treatments had the desired effect of improving the pathogen-specific signal. pathogen-specific signals were detected in ten out of 14 pellet or supernatant CSF samples tested. despite overall lower signal intensities, hybridization methods appear to reduce nonspecific binding and improve signal-to-noise ratio. hybridization specificity was improved using formamide-based buffers and the Advalytix Slidebooster hybridization station. the array was transferred to the ArrayTubeTM platform (Alere Technologies GmbH, Jena, Germany) to evaluate its use for development of high throughput front-line diagnostics. the colorimetric detection protocol is also faster and more efficient [113] and would allow for higher-throughput sample processing and detection [109]. use of this pan-bacterial meningitis array could facilitate simultaneous detection of diverse targets, negating the use of multiple separate assays. however, there are some limitations and the outputs do not correspond precisely with those obtained by RT-PCR. random-amplification method was used to reduce bias in generating targets from material which may contain unknown pathogens. but the method amplifies all nucleic acids in the sample as well as those of any pathogen present. it was less efficient using clinical CSF sample material due to technical limitations. repurposing the array onto the Alere ArrayTubeTM format was fruitful and clear pathogen-specific signals could be seen with pathogen DNA and clinical CSF sample hybridizations. this would lend itself useful as a routine diagnostic tool in a laboratory setting using purified pathogen nucleic acids."}
