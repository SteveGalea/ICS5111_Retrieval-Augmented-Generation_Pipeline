{"summary": "antibody repertoires of phage-displayed library are conventionally created by harvesting mRNAs from peripheral blood lymphocytes, spleen, bone marrow, tonsil or similar sources. the heavy and light chains are then randomly combined and cloned to construct a combinatorial scFv library. potential Ig genes may not be recovered from antibody cDNA library due to reading frame shifted or the presence of stop codon(s) recombinant antibody repertoires of a cDNA-derived antibody library are limited. antibodies encoded by a very limited VH and VL genes of inbred mice were found to react with different haptens, polysaccharides, and even protein antigens. the potential use of rearranged germline Ig genes as source of antibody repertoires has never been explored. oligos and primers were custom synthesized by Invitrogen. the sequences and the relative position with respect to an scFv of various oligos and primers were detailed in Table 1 and Figure S1 respectively. spleens were resuspended in an ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for isolation of CD19+ cells. spleens were squeezed out and resuspended in an ice-cold phosphate buffered saline. labeled cells were resuspended in 5 ml of RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) the CD19+ splenocytes were sorted and captured using a cell sorter (Becton Dickinson) samples were subjected to 20 amplification cycles each consisting of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, a touch up annealing step from 40\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C at a rate of 0.5\u00b0C/cycle for 1 min. the reaction mixture was further subjected to a post-extension step at 72\u00b0C for 2 min. the first stage is composed of 5 amplification cycles each consisting of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30s, annealing at 65\u00b0C for 30 s and extension at 72\u00b0C for 30s. the second stage was composed of 25 amplification cycles each consisting of a denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 30s, a touch-down annealing step from 65\u00b0C to 55\u00b0C at a rate of 0.4\u00b0C/cycle for 30 s 25 fsPCR cycles were carried out in a geneAmp\u00ae 9700 PCR thermocycler with 96-well aluminum plate. each fsPCR cycle consisted of a denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, an annealing step at 20\u00b0C for 2 min and an extension step with temperature ramping up from 20 to 94\u00b0C. the reaction was carried out in a reaction volume of 50 l containing 1X PCR buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP, 2.5 U non-proof reading Taq polymerase, 5 l of PCR products of the 1st-stage oePCR (both VH and VL) the mixture was pre-denatured at 94\u00b0C for 2 min, then subjected to 20. each cycle consisted of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 62\u00b0C for 30s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 90s. scFv library was constructed by electroporation of the ligated products into competent TG1 E. coli. phages were rescued at 30\u00b0C overnight with gentle shaking. eluted phages were detected with anti-M13 peroxidase-conjugated antibody. bound phages were detected by incubation with 100 l of scFv-phages at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. scFv clones were subcloned into pCantab His vector, transformed into E Coli HB2151, and periplasmic His-tagged scFvs were purified using Ni-NTA agarose beads. oligos and primers All oligos and primers were custom synthesized by Invitrogen. frame-shifting primers RFSH 5\u2032-gAcDgTgASHRDRgTBcccccccccANNNNNN-3\u2032 F.

ELISA plate (96-well) was pre-coated with 50 l of phOx-BSA (1 g/l) overnight. freshly prepared phages were PEG-precipitated and then resuspended in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) cross-reactivity of selected scFv clones was examined using phageELISA against different antigens. phOx-BSA conjugate, insulin, thyroglobulin, Ang II-BSA conjugate, LPS, ssDNA as indicated. scFv library derived from a single scFv library. a new scFv library was constructed using a single scFv clone L3G7C. the clone exhibited a moderate phOx-specific binding and a noticeable non-specific binding towards LPS. two rounds of panning were carried out and 48 candidate clones were randomly picked for sequence determination. sequences of the (B) heavy- and (C) light-chain CDR3 (H3 and L3, respectively) were aligned. lack of consensus antibody FR4 was noted in some of the phage clones. fsPCR could be used for optimizing binding selectivity of antibody. scFv clones were subcloned into a pCantab His vector for adding a His6 tag at the C-terminus of scFv. the protein blot was probed with an anti-His antibody. gene expressed in phage-display system [39], [40], sequence analysis indicated that some of the selected clones contained stop codon or displayed a frame-shift in the coding region. the clones were bacterially expressed and the periplasmic proteins were collected. six strong binders for SCoV-N protein were identified from naive (L4A3A; L4A3B, L4A8B) and immunized (L9A6B, L9A11B, and L9N01) libraries. it is of interest to note that not only a larger number of phage clones were isolated, but 9 clones with identical sequence were found from immunized library L9. cross-reactivity of selected anti-N scFv clones was evaluated using phageELISA against different antigens, including BSA, SCoV-N, insulin, thyroglobulin, Ang II-BSA conjugate, ssDNA. semi-nested PCR generated DNA fragments that displayed a size corresponding to VH (lanes 2 and 5) and VL (lanes 4 and 6) variable segments. the PCR products deriving from splenocytic genomic DNA of nave non-immunized mice were gel-purified and then cloned into vectors. 92.0% (96/104) and 100% (84/84) of clones were found to be murine Ig VH, and a total of 59 unique VL clones were identified as members of the VL 21 subfamily. the estimated germline Ig gene number of the VL 21 subfamily is 6-13. retrieved Ig genes may have derived from both rearranged germline and hypermutated Ig genes. fsPCR generated DNA fragments that spread around 220-396 bp for VH and 250-344 bp for VL Ig genes. the random hexamer portion of the frame-shifting primer allowed base pairing in CDR3 and subsequent nucleotide extension (step 2). fsPCR products were gel-purified, subcloned and sequenced. multiple sequence alignment of the derived VH and VL sequences indicated a significant sequence variation within the CDR3. phage-displayed scFv library was panned against immobilized phOx-BSA conjugate. after 5 rounds of panning, 288 clones were randomly picked. phOx-selective phage clones bound phOx-BSA in concentration-dependent manner. some of the identified scFvs shared conserved CDR motifs with previously characterized phOx-binders in the Ig database. others showed conservative amino acid substitutions (Figure 4, panels D and E, Table S2). selective scFv-phages were resuspended at a fix concentration (2.81014 cfu/ml) and incubated with immobilized phOx-BSA. results were normalized in percentage of saturation. Error bars represent SEM of three separate experiments each performed in duplicate. scFv library derived from a single scFv template was constructed using a single scFv clone L3G7C that exhibited a moderate phOx-specific binding. two rounds of panning were carried out and 48 candidate clones were randomly picked. clones L10D5A and L10D10A gave a significant lower binding than the parental L3G7C to the unrelated antigens insulin, angiotensin and ssDNA. fsPCR could be used for optimizing binding selectivity of antibody. scFv clones were evaluated using phageELISA against different antigens. phOx-BSA conjugate, insulin, thyroglobulin, Ang II-BSA conjugate, LPS, ssDNA. clones were subcloned into a pCantab His vector for adding a His6 tag at the C-terminus of. expressions of scFv proteins were examined by Western protein analysis. the protein blot was probed with an anti-His antibody. the clones were bacterially expressed and the periplasmic proteins were collected. 2100 and 96 specific anti-N scFvs were isolated from both the immunized and nave libraries. it is of interest to note that not only a larger number of phage clones were isolated, but 9 clones with identical sequence were found from immunized library L9. Purified His6-SCoV-N recombinant protein was separated on gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate (5% - 20%) polyacrylamide gel. stripes were probed with different anti-N scFv-phages, including L9A6B, L9A11B, L4A3A, L4A3A, L4A8B, and M13KO7 helper phage (negative control) as indicated. degenerate primers were used to retrieve the rearranged variable region genes from genomic DNA. the use of family-specific primers assures less change in nucleotide sequences. cross-family amplification cannot be avoided if all primers are used at the same time. more VL and 7 VH subfamilies were retrieved than that of VLk (4 out of 19) using present strategy. but when comparing distributions of Ig clones in each V genes subfamily, distributions of Ig clones were different from that of target-specific Ig clones. light chain CDR3 length was smaller than that of heavy chain and ranged from 8 to 18 residues with a peak value at 9 residues. similarity in CDR3 length distribution between native and recombinant antibodies suggested hypervariable regions that derived from germline rearranged Ig genes were folded into the canonical structure of immunoglobulins [27] anti-phOx scFvs were 8-11 amino acid residues in length. the heavy chain CDR3 consisted of the sequence motif Asp-X-Gly-X-X. other clones were not. a germline scFv library derived from splenocytic DNA of mice immunized with heat-inactivated SARS-coronavirus has identified an anti-N scFv that cross-reacts with interleukin 11 [34] some selected anti-phOx scFvs exhibited noticeable binding to unrelated antigens. clones with identical sequence were enriched in the immunized library. riving from phOx scFvs, we found CDR sequences that had been reported previously, and we also identified new CDR motifs. however, in order to evaluate the repertoire diversity of the germline antibody library, the germline antibody library should be panned against a panel of antigens. insertions and deletions of CDR3 nucleotides have recently been shown to be an additional mechanism how immunoglobulin V region genes are diversified [29], restriction sites for cloning in the primers are underlined and restriction enzymes are indicated. table S1 Analysis of immunoglobulin clones derived from mouse genomic DNA."}
