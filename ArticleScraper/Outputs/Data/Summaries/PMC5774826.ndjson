{"summary": "cryptosporidiosis was previously recognized as a major contributor to diarrhea in endemic areas. a recent multicenter study in africa and Asia found that cryptosporidium infections are the third most common cause of severe diarrhea in young children. cryptosporidium infections are also strongly associated with malnutrition and delayed development. MMV665917 is a piperazine-based compound with high selectivity for the blood stages of malaria parasites and for Cryptosporidium species. it reduces parasite shedding to below detectable limits in a highly immunocompromised mouse model of chronic C. parvum infection. the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) of the national Institutes of Health complies with the guidelines of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. the university complies with the Animal Welfare Act and its associated regulations (USDA-APHIS \"Blue Book\" oral electrolytes, intravenous fluids, and flunixin meglumine were suspended for dosing in 1% hydroxypropyl methyl-cellulose in water at a final volume of 10 mL per dose. daily fecal samples were collected from collection bins located under each pen. fecal mMV665917 was measured by homogenizing feces in PBS (0.1 g/mL) in a polypropylene tube and then further dilution prior to addition of an internal standard (enalapril) and acetonitrile protein precipitation. samples were then resuspended and analyzed using LC/MS/MS. the university of Vermont has an Animal Welfare Assurance with the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare. uninfected animals were group-housed and infected at 24\u201348 hours of age. salmonella culture, aerobic bacterial culture with E. coli genotyping, and rotavirus and coronavirus testing were performed on all calves at the onset of diarrhea. animals with severe diarrhea and other symptoms were supported aggressively, including administration of oral electrolytes, intravenous fluids, and flunixin meglumine. some loss of interest but eats 25\u201375% of meal 3 Severe diarrhea: part or all of feces is very watery; flows down a surface, while leaving no residual Severely depressed: lethargic, must be coaxed to get up, anorexia, requires supportive treatment. fecal oocyst shedding per gram of fecal dry matter vs. time. p values were determined using the unpaired one-way student\u2019s t test. results Pharmacokinetics of MMV665917 in dairy calves. calf fecal (circles) and serum (squares) MMV665917 concentrations vs. time for calves administered 22 mg/kg once daily for seven days, beginning 4 days after infection with the C. parvum Iowa isolate. the mean and SD (n = 3 calves) are shown. newborn dairy calves were infected with the C. parvum Iowa isolate. treated orally with either MMV665917 22 mg/kg once daily or drug vehicle alone from days 4\u201310 after infection. data are the means and SEMs of the log10 (oocysts/gram fecal dry matter) data are the means and SEMs of the log10 (oocysts/gram fecal dry matter) the lines indicate the approximate qPCR assay limit of detection (LOD) overall health, hydration, and appetite were assessed twice daily on days 4\u201311 after infection. the area under the curve (AUC) for each metric was determined for each animal\u2019s average daily score plotted vs. time using a baseline score of 1 (normal) calf fecal (circles) and serum (squares) MMV665917 concentrations vs. time following a single oral dose of 22 mg/kg given to healthy newborn calves. data points are the means and SDs (n = 2 calves). infected calves received either MMV665917 (22 mg/kg once daily for seven days) or vehicle alone (negative control) beginning on day four after infection. oocyst shedding continued despite ongoing treatment and complete resolution of diarrhea. newborn dairy calves were infected with the C. parvum Iowa isolate. treated orally with either MMV665917 22 mg/kg once daily or drug vehicle alone from days 4\u201310 after infection, following development of severe diarrhea. the effect of MMV665917 treatment on overall health, dehydration, and appetite of C. parvum infected calves was quantified using a standardized scoring system. all calves received aggressive supportive care in an attempt to mitigate unnecessary suffering, which limited the magnitude of differences that might be observed between the experimental groups. our data show that MMV665917 is both clinically and microbiologically effective for treatment of cryptosporidiosis in new-born calves. this data represent a key step for drug development directed towards treatment of both calves and people afflicted with cryptosporidiosis. a-go-go potassium channel by physiologically relevant concentrations of MMV665917 indicates the possibility of cardiac toxicity. additional safety studies are therefore needed to assess the possibility of cardiotoxicity. medicinal chemistry optimization to increase potency and selectivity is likely warranted."}
