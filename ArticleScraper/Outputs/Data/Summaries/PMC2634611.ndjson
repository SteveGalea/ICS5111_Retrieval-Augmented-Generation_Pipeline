{"summary": "DMU 452 is the historic core bovine TB\u2013endemic area. prior carnivore surveillance conducted by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) had detected M. bovis in 18 of 249 sampled coyotes. a large proportion of land in the study area was privately owned (e.g., commercial hunting clubs, agricultural operations, residential development), landowner permission to access property dictated trap placement. traps were checked daily, and trapping was terminated when 10 coyotes were collected. a large proportion of land in the study area was privately owned. the solid media tubes were incubated at 37 2\u00b0C in a 10% CO2 incubator and examined weekly until colonies were observed or until an incubation period of 8 weeks was complete. we then used niacin and nitrate biochemical tests to distinguish M. bovis from M. tuberculosis isolates (21,23). bacterial cultures isolated M. bovis from fresh tissues and/or fixed tissues had acid-fast bacilli that were PCR positive for IS6110. animals were considered positive if bacterial cultures isolated M. bovis from fresh tissues. all control coyotes were negative for M. bovis, and they were not included in subsequent analyses or summary statistics. percent prevalence of M. bovis was highest for coyotes sampled from Alpena County, followed by alcona, Oscoda, and Montmorency Counties. valence estimates for white-tailed deer are expressed as a mean calculated from discrete sampling periods conducted in 2003, 2004 and 2005. estimates of M. bovis prevalence for white-tailed deer were not available for individual townships; standard errors were not calculated for counties. microscopically, both lesions and the number of acid-fast bacilli within lesions were variable. most common microscopic lesion was a granuloma in the cortex of lymph nodes with large central areas of acellular, eosinophilic debris. mycobacterium bovis in a coyote (Canis latrans) was caused by mycobacterium bovis in a coyote (canis latrans) small, poorly delineated aggregates of primarily macrophages within the lymph node cortex. by focusing on coyotes rather than deer, we sampled 97% fewer animals and detected a similar number of M. bovis\u2013positive animals. we found no evidence of physical debilitation positively or negatively influencing capture probability. we found no evidence of physical debilitation positively or negatively influencing capture probability. we found no evidence of physical debilitation positively or negatively influencing capture probability. lesions predominantly localized to the lymphoid tissue of the gastrointestinal tract. only 1 animal had evidence of advanced disease, as evidenced by lesions in the lung and liver. the spectrum and locations of lesions led us to postulate that coyotes may acquire M. bovis orally. the disparity in prevalence relative to sampling effort between coyotes and deer is strong evidence that coyotes could be useful for monitoring M. bovis occurrence in Michigan (4). the disparity in prevalence relative to sampling effort between coyotes and deer is strong evidence that coyotes could be useful for monitoring M. bovis occurrence. negative results could be due to the fact that coyotes overlapped cervid ranges. coyotes not being likely to prey on elk, if they scavenge kills of other predators. sentinel-based surveillance programs could facilitate adaptive monitoring of disease occurrence. wildlife can serve as effective biologic sensors and satellites of some infectious disease epidemics and bioterrorism that threaten human health."}
