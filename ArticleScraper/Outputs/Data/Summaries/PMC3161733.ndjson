{"summary": "phage library consists of billions of heterologous peptides that can be produced by the fusion of random nucleic acid sequences to the N terminus of one of the capsid protein genes of a filamentous bacteriophage. this technology has been applied successfully in numerous aspects, including antibody engineering [10], peptide discovery and manufacture [11], diagnostic analysis [12] and vaccine development [13]. 96-well plates were coated with the H5N1 viruses at a concentration of 14 g/well in 0.1 M NaHCO3 buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. the next day, the plates were blocked for 1 h with 5% skimmed milk diluted in 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 20. the phages were amplified in Escherichia coli ER2738 and purified by polyethylene glycol precipitation. the fourth and third rounds of panning were repeated under similar panning conditions. the coated viruses were replaced by the supernatant form MDCK culture. a concentration of 21011 in 0.1 M NaHCO3 (pH 8.6) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the wells were incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. the color was developed using o-phenylenediamine (OPD) the H5N1 viruses were serially diluted in DMEM medium. they were coated into ELISA plates overnight at 4\u00b0C. the next day, the wells were blocked with 5% skimmed milk for 3 h. the selected phages and phage complex from the phage display library (control phage) were used as primary antibody. 3 ml of the viruses were subjected to viral RNA extraction using a RNA extraction kit (Fastgene, China) the reverse transcription system included 5 l of viral RNA (1 g), 7.5 l of sterile water, 1 l of M-MLV reverse transcriptase. the reaction was performed at 42\u00b0C for 30 min, 99\u00b0C for 5 min and 5\u00b0C for 5 min. specificities of selected phages were evaluated by using them as diagnostic reagents. these viruses included duck plague virus (DPV) a vaccine strain, avian bronchitis virus (IBV) strain Beaudette, fowlpox virus (FPV) isolate HH2008, avian infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) strain UK661, avian infectious laryngotracheitis virus (AILV) strain K317 and newcastle disease 96-well plates were coated with the H5N1 viruses at a concentration of 14 g/well in 0.1 M NaHCO3 (pH 8.6) buffer overnight at 4\u00b0C. the next day, the plates were blocked for 1 h with 5% skimmed milk diluted in 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBST) titer of the phages in input, elute buffer and that after amplification in E.coli were determined to evaluate the enrichment efficiency. ELISA plates were coated with H5N1 viruses diluted in 0.1 M NaHCO3 (pH8.6) at a concentration of 10 g/well. the color was developed using o-phenylenediamine (OPD) and the optical density (OD) value was read using an ELISA plate reader at a wavelength of 405 nm. each phage clone DNA was purified using a plasmid extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany) the OD405 value of detected phage wells (P)/negative control (N)>2 was judged as positive results. for conventional ELISA, the H5N1 viruses were serially diluted in DMEM medium. after triple washes with TBST, the wells were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. reaction was performed at 42\u00b0C for 30 min, 99\u00b0C for 5 min and 5\u00b0C for 5 min. cDNA was serially diluted and subjected to PCR. authenticity of the PCR product was confirmed by sequencing. castle disease virus (NDV) strain La Sota was coated in 0.1 M NaHCO3 (pH8.6) on ELISA plates overnight at 4\u00b0C. at least three independent experiments were carried out, each data point was presented as mean SD. the phage display technology has become an increasingly attractive molecular tool to researchers in biotechnology related fields [17]\u2013[19]. the phage display technology has become an increasingly attractive molecular tool to researchers in biotechnology related fields. the individual phage and controls are indicated in the x axis. the controls 1\u20136 are phage library coating group, phage-free group, secondary antibody-free group, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus coating group, avian infectious bronchitis virus coating group. recombinant Fab monoclonal antibodies specific to the HA of H5N1 virus have also been characterized. this is the first time to report the peptide sequences that can bind to the HPAI H5N1 viruses. further experiments are needed to analyze the function of the peptides/motifs in the context of H5N1 infection. the minimum quantity of the H5N1 viruses for phages 1 to 3 was 0.1 g, 0.5 g and 0.8 g respectively. the phage 1 was the most sensitive reagent used in the phage-based ELISA. the minimum quantity of H5N1 viruses required for the ELISA was determined as 0.3 g. the experiment was performed in triplicate and the P/N value was from three independent assays. the concentration of the viruses is indicated in the x axis. the avian viruses selected in this study are very common in china. the three identified phages were capable of recognizing H5N1 viruses specifically rather than other control viruses (p0.01) at the same time, the low reactivity of the control, the phage complex from the phage library to the targets in the ELISA excluded any artifact clearly. the viruses were diluted in 0.1 M NaHCO3 (pH8.6) to a final concentration of 15 g/well in ELISA plates followed by incubation with phages 1\u20133, anti-M13 antibody and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. the name and OD405 value of individual phage are indicated in x and y axis, respectively. ltamivir appears to be very time dependant, where treatment started later than 24 hours post infection is much less effective. influenza viruses undergo antigenic drift and antigenic shift, resulting in new virus strains that may not be recognized by earlier influenza strains. effective diagnostic tests for viruses screening prior to application of drugs and vaccines are widely accepted. ten phage clones that specific binding to H5N1 viruses were identified. no positive results were found in the control, confirming binding specificity of the phages to the H5N1 viruses. the individual phage and controls are indicated in the x axis. the role of the identified peptides/motifs in H5N1 virus infection needs to be investigated in the future. this is the first time to report the peptide sequences that can bind to the HPAI H5N1 viruses. age 5 HAWDPIPARDPF Phage 6 ATSHLHVRLPSK Phage 7 HAWDPIPARDPF Phage 8 ATSHLHVRLPSK Phage 9 ATSHLHVRLPSK Phage 10 ATSHLHVRLPSK a Ten selected phages (phages 1 to 10) were subjected to phage DNA extraction and PCR. the deduced amino acid sequences are shown. serially diluted H5N1 viruses were coated into ELISA plates. serially diluted virus were coated with antigens followed by successive incubation with identified phages 1 to 3, anti-M13 antibody and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. cDNA was ten-fold serially diluted and subjected to PCR.
