{"summary": "both viruses can infect a broad range of mammalian species causing severe and often-lethal disease in humans and animals. extensive laboratory studies on the host cell infection stage of HeV and NiV have been hampered by their pathogenic nature and restriction to biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) containment. a specific henipavirus entry assay has been developed using NiV or HeV F and G glycoprotein pseudotyped reporter-gene encoding retrovirus particles. this assay can be conducted safely under BSL-2 conditions and will be a useful tool for measuring henipavirus entry and studying F and G glycoprotein function. every outbreak of HeV has involved horses as the initial infected host, causing lethal respiratory disease and encephalitis. there have been more than a dozen occurrences of NiV emergence since its initial recognition, most appearing in Bangladesh and india. a total of seven human cases arising from exposure to infected horses have been fatal and the most recent in 2009. NiV and HeV possess two envelope glycoproteins anchored within the viral membrane, a trimeric fusion (F) and a tetrameric attachment (G) glycoprotein (reviewed in [26]). the F glycoprotein is initially synthesized as a precursor F0 which is cleaved into the disulfide-linked F1 and F2 subunits by cathepsin L within the host cell. the henipavirus F and G glycoproteins the envelope glycoproteins of one virus are incorporated into the progeny virions of another that lacks its own envelope glycoprotein(s), effectively changing the host range and tropism of the virus. lentiviral vectors have emerged as promising tools for gene-delivery studies and can efficiently transduce proliferating as well as quiescent cells. lentivirus-based henipavirus glycoprotein pseudotyped particles exhibited the same cellular tropism characteristics as authentic NiV and HeV. the pseudotyped particles could be readily concentrated by ultracentrifugation without any loss of infectivity. the pseudotyped particles could be readily concentrated by ultracentrifugation without any loss of infectivity. henipavirus glycoprotein pseudotyped virus particles and control virus particles lacking the glycoproteins were normalized for p24 content by ELISA. the preparations of henipavirus glycoprotein pseudotyped virus particles and control virus particles lacking the glycoproteins were normalized for p24 content. pCAGGs expression vectors encoding the NiV or HeV F and G glycoproteins were consistently non-functional as measured by luciferase activity. analysis of the HeV G gene cloned in pCAGGs using splice site prediction software from EMBL-EBI http://www.ebi.ac.uk/asd-srv/wb.cgi\"method=7 revealed 3 possible splice sites within HeV G coding region. none were present in the NiV G glycoprotein pCAGGs construct. cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase reporter gene activity. splice donor sites are presented as black triangles and the splice acceptor site as grey squares. a series of pseudotyped virus particles were prepared using HeV F along with each of the seven HeV G splice site mutants. the splice site removal by mutation in HeV G-SM7 restores the ability of HeV G to be expressed in the context of pCAGGs. the heterotypic pseudotyped particles yielded reporter gene activity essentially equivalent to the HeV G-SM7 and HeV F particles. supernatants were collected 36 hr post-transfection and processed as detailed in the methods. henipavirus specific reagents capable of blocking virus infection were tested for their ability to inhibit the infection of the henipavirus pseudotypes. henipavirus specific peptide fusion inhibitor NiV-FC2 completely blocked the entry of the henipavirus pseudotypes. the m102.4 mAb neutralizes henipaviruses by specifically binding and blocking the ephrin-B2 and -B3 receptor-binding region on the henipavirus G glycoprotein. the binding and infection of the henipavirus pseudotypes to target cells could be blocked by recombinant, soluble ephrin-B2 and -B3 receptors. a series of seven cytoplasmic tail truncation mutations were generated by introducing translational stop codons into the coding sequence of the NiV and HeV F gene. the constructs differ by only one additional deleted valine residue to better ensure complete removal of the cytoplasmic tail domain. cytoplasmic tail truncations of membrane anchored proteins could affect proper folding and transport. the series of truncated mutants and each wild-type F were expressed by plasmid transfection in HeLa-USU cells. the wild-type NiV F0 precursor was cleaved and detected. the cytoplasmic tail truncation mutants were transfected into HeLa-USU cells. at 24 hr post transfection, cell surface proteins were biotinylated and precipitated with Avidin agarose beads. the precipitated proteins were processed for Western blot analysis. the coexpression of the cytoplasmic tail truncation mutants did not significantly alter the HeV F expression and cleavage patterns observed in cell surface biotinylation assays. membrane fusion was assessed using the well-characterized vaccinia virus-based, reporter-gene, cell-cell fusion assay. truncation mutants were assayed for their ability to mediate cell-cell fusion when co-expressed with their partner G glycoprotein in a quantitative vaccinia virus-based cell-cell fusion assays. each truncation mutant was tested in triplicate wells in three independent experiments. seudotyped lentivirus particles were prepared as before using the series of cytoplasmic tail truncation mutants along with their partner G glycoprotein. three types of control virus particles were also prepared using either empty vector (pCAGGs) or each species of wild-type F glycoprotein alone or each species of G glycoprotein alone. removal of the endocytosis motif from the fusion protein prevents its transportation to the endosome and subsequent cleavage of F0 into F1 and F2 by Cathepsin L. the higher infectivity of the FCt1, FCt2 and FCt3 bearing pseudotypes in comparison to wild-type was notable. the reason for this later observation is unclear at present. preparations of pseudovirions normalized by assaying p24 content. then used to infect permissive 293T target cells. lentivirus-based pseudovirions were lysed and subjected to Western blot analysis. the preparations of henipavirus glycoprotein pseudotyped virus particles and control virus particles lacking the glycoproteins were normalized for p24 content by ELISA. pCAGGs expression vectors encoding the NiV or HeV F and G glycoproteins were consistently non-functional as measured by luciferase activity. pCAGGs is a mammalian expression vector with the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early enhancer linked with the analysis of the HeV G

HeV G-SM7 restores the ability of HeV G to be expressed in the context of pCAGGs. the heterotypic pseudotyped particles yielded reporter gene activity essentially equivalent to the HeV G-SM7 and HeV F

blocking virus infection were tested for their ability to inhibit the infection. mAb m102.4 neutralizes henipaviruses by specifically binding and blocking the ephrin-B2 and -B3 receptor-binding region on the henipavirus G glycoprotein. the binding and infection of the henipavirus pseudotypes to target cells could be blocked by recombinant, soluble ephrin-B2 and -B3 receptors. a series of seven

fusion protein prevents its transportation to the endosome and subsequent cleavage of F0 into F1 and F2 by Cathepsin L. in both the NiV and HeV F glycoprotein mutant series, the higher infectivity of the FCt1, FCt2 and FCt3 bearing pseudotypes in comparison to wild-type was notable. lentivirus-based pseudotyping system uses functional F and G envelope glycoproteins of the henipaviruses; NiV and HeV. henipavirus pseudotyping system faithfully recapitulated the natural NiV or HeV cell attachment and viral glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion stages of infection. the receptor-induced triggering event is presumed to involve direct contacts between an attachment and fusion glycoprotein. this activation process facilitates a series of conformational changes in F and the glycoprotein transitions into its post-fusion, six-helix-bundle conformation concomitant with the merging of the viral membrane envelope and the host cell plasma membrane. however, all of the details of the entire receptor binding and fusion activation process have yet to be defined. henipavirus G glycoprotein (sG) inhibited the infection of either HeV or NiV pseudotypes by blocking receptor binding. henipavirus-mediated membrane fusion and live virus infection assays could also be completely blocked using a cross-reactive human mAb (m120.4) that is specific for the henipavirus G glycoprotein. studies with human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) envelope (Env) glycoproteins have shown that cytoplasmic domain truncation mutants exhibit significantly enhanced Env fusogenic activity. studies with murine leukemia virus have demonstrated that naturally occurring late cleavage of a small carboxy terminal sequence, designated as the R peptide or p2E, results in significantly enhanced cell-to- henipavirus pseudotyping system described here offers a useful tool to explore the possibility of a productive early endocytic route of henipavirus infection. henipavirus pseudotyped particles could be readily produced, concentrated by ultracentrifugation and stored frozen without loss of infectivity. ism characteristics as authentic NiV and HeV could be inhibited by various antiviral agents that target the henipaviruses. this new henipavirus pseudotyping system will be a useful tool for measuring the viral glycoprotein function in the context of virus particle. pNL4-3-Luc-E-R+ or pNL4-3-GFP-E-R+ backbone plasmids encoding the luciferase (Luc) [40] or green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter gene were provided by Dr. R.
