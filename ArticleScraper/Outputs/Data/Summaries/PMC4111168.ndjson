{"summary": "serum samples from 358 dromedaries raised for meat production were collected at abattoirs in 4 provinces. the ages of the animals ranged from 4 to 15 years. the abattoirs also served the neighboring countries of Chad, Niger, and the central African Republic. serologic results are indicated in each province as percentage seropositive for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (total no. dromedaries tested) serum samples were tested for presence of IgG antibodies reactive with S1 antigens against MERS-CoV (residues 1\u2013747), severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (residues 1\u2013676) and human CoV OC43 (residues 1\u2013760) serum samples from 72%, 82%, and 67% of the dromedaries reacted with the OC43 antigen, confirming common circulation of CoV in camelids (7,12) all samples tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV. 1996 6 (A) 100 (9) 1994 123 (A) 93 (9) 1993 2 (A) 100 (9) 1992 1 (A) 100 (9) Tunisia 2009 46 (J) 30 This study 2009 158 (A) 54 This study *Camel age range indicated where known: J, juvenile 2 y of age ; A, adult >2 y of age. as determined by: recombinant spike IFA.
