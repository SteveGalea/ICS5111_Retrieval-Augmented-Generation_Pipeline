{"summary": "PRRS virus (PRRSV) is an enveloped single-stranded positive sense RNA virus. it is classified into the genus Arterivirus, family Arteriviridae, order Nidovirales. the genome is approximately 15.4 kb in length and contains 10 open reading frames. nsp4 serine protease is responsible for most of the nonstructural protein processing. it folds into three domains including two chymotrypsin-like -barrel domains and an extra C-terminal / domain. there are two apoptosis pathways: the extrinsic pathway (death receptor pathway) and the intrinsic pathway (the mitochondria pathway) nsp4-induced cell apoptosis was dependent on its 3C-like serine protease activity. nsp4-induced cell apoptosis was dependent on its 3C-like serine protease activity. nsp4-induced cell apoptosis was dependent on its 3C-like serine protease activity. viruses Marc-145 cells (ATCC No. CRL-12231), a PRRSV-permissive cell line subcloned from MA-104 cells, were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. COS-1 cells (ATCC No. CRL-1650) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. name Sequence N69 forward 5'-GCGTCGACAATGTGCCCGAATTGGCAAG-3' N69 reverse2 5'-ATTTGCGCGCTCATTCCAGTTCAGGTTTGGCA-3' MID forward-3 5'-GTGGCTTCACAGTCCACC-3' MID reverse-3 5'-GTGAAGCCCATCAAG-3' C157 forward1 5'-GCGTCGACCATGGGTGCTTTCAGAACTCAA-3' C157 reverse 5'-ATTT construction, expression, and purification of PRRSV pT7His-nsp4, H39A, D64A, S118A and pET32a-NSP3\u20194 Genes encoding the wild-type 3C-like protease were amplified by PCR from nsp4 and single-point mutant plasmids. the resultant plasmids were designated as pT7His-nsp4, H39A, plasmids pT7His-nsp4, H39A, D64A, S118A, and pET32a-NSP3\u20194 were transformed into E. Coli BL21 (DE3) plasmids pT7His-nsp4, H39A, D64A, S118A, and pET32a-NSP3\u20194 were cultured at 37\u00b0C until the concentration at A600 reached 0.6-0.8. TUNEL assay Detection of cell apoptosis was performed using the TUNEL technique following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Roche) cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. after rinsing with PBS, cells were permeabilized using 0.3% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate for 4 min. 106 cells were harvested, lysed, and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. a 20 g aliquot of proteins was incubated with colorimetric substrate DEVD-pNA for caspase-3 assay, IETD-pNA for caspase-8 assay and LEHD-pNA for caspase-9 assay. Statistical analysis All experiments were performed with at least three independent replicates. results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. differences were evaluated by Student\u2019s t test. PRRSV strain, CH-1a (the first type 2 PRRSV strain isolated in China) and HV (a highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP\u2013PRRSV) isolate) were propagated in PAMs. nsp4 expression plasmid was constructed by cloning the coding sequence of nsp4 from HP\u2013PRRSV strain into the pcDNA3.1 (+) and pCMV-Myc.

FITC-positive and DAPI-positive cells were counted. the amount of DAPI-positive cells were regarded as the total cells number. results were expressed as percentages of FITC-positive cells. 106 cells were harvested, lysed, and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. a 20 g aliquot of proteins was incubated with the colorimetric substrate DEVD-pNA for the caspase-3 assay, IETD-pNA for the caspase-8 assay, and LEHD-pNA for the caspase-9 assay. analysis by flow cytometry showed that the percentage of apoptotic cells infected with PRRSV was remarkably higher when compared to mock-infection. apoptosis (green), PRRSV N protein (red) and nucleus (blue) were detected. nsp2 and nsp4 induce apoptosis in Marc-145 cells. nsp4 could induce apoptosis in various cell lines. nsp2 accounts for major genetic differences between PRRSV strains. PRRSV nsp4 caused apoptosis in various cell lines. cells were transfected with nsp4 expression plasmid or pcDNA3.1 (+) as control. at 48 hours post transfection, cells were collected, stained, and analyzed by flow cytometry. PRRSV and nsp4 activate caspase-3, -8 and -9 PRRSV. caspase-3, -8, and -9 activity in PRRSV-infected PAMs was significantly higher than that in control cells. nsp4-transfected cells showed a similar increase in their activities in nsp4-transfected cells. enzymatic activities of caspase-3, -8, and -9 were examined using colorimetric assays. at 48 hours post transfection, activated caspase 3 (17 kDa), cleaved PARP, and nsp4 were analyzed. apoptosis-inducing abilities of wild-type and mutant nsp4 were nearly abolished when compared to wild-type nsp4 (Figure 5F). apoptosis-inducing abilities of N69, MID, and C157 were nearly abolished. his39, Asp64, and Ser118 are essential for nsp4 to induce apoptosis. nsp4-induced apoptosis is dependent on its 3C-like serine protease catalytic activity Truncation of proteins may compromise nsp4 overall structure. nsp4-induced apoptosis was dependent on its 3C-like serine protease activity. cells were transfected with wild-type nsp4, H39A, D64A, or S118A point mutant proteins. at 48 hours post transfection, cell lysates were prepared and examined. the genes encoding wild-type and mutant 3C-like proteases were cloned and expressed with His6-tag at N-terminus. nsp3'4 mutant protein was used as the substrate, which included the last 8 residues of nsp3 and the whole amino acid sequence of nsp4 with Ala substitution for Ser118. if the substrate had been cleaved at the nsp3 and nsp4 junction (E we infected PAMs with HP\u2013PRRSV HV strain at an MOI of 0.5. we then examined apoptosis using TUNEL assay at 24 h post infection. more apoptotic cells were observed in Marc-145 cells infected with PRRSV. cells were collected, stained with Annexin V/PI, and analyzed by flow cytometry. nsp2 and nsp4 induce apoptosis in Marc-145 cells. PRRSV nsp4 caused apoptosis in various cell lines. nsp4 protein also caused apoptosis in mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells. cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 (+) as control. nsp4-induced apoptosis in Hela cells. cells were transfected with pCMV-Myc control or nsp4-expressing plasmid. after 48 hours, cells were collected, stained, and analyzed by flow cytometry. PRRSV-infection and nsp4-transfection activated caspases. enzymatic activities of caspase 3 (17 kDa), cleaved PARP, and nsp4 were examined using colorimetric assays. the apoptosis level declined remarkably in N69, MID, and C157-transfected cells compared to that in wide-type nsp4-transfected cells. however, apoptosis-inducing abilities of N69, MID, and C157 were nearly abolished when compared to wild-type nsp4. nsp4 is a 3C-like serine protease that contains the canonical catalytic triad of His39\u2013Asp64\u2013Ser118. nsp4-induced apoptosis is dependent on its 3C-like serine protease catalytic activity. double-labeling assay showed similar results. His39, Asp64, and Ser118 were critical for nsp4 to induce apoptosis. nsp4-induced apoptosis was dependent on its 3C-like serine protease activity. mutant nsp4 proteins were incubated with the substrate NSP3\u2019 4 (Ser118Ala) for 24 h. nsp4 3C-like proteases were cloned and expressed with His6-tag. nsp4-induced cell apoptosis was dependent on its 3C-like serine protease activity. nsp4-induced cell apoptosis was dependent on its 3C-like serine protease catalytic activity. nsp4 could activate caspase family, which is in coincident with PRRSV infection. recently, apoptotic cells were found in lymphoid organs of infected pigs. apoptosis was detected both in PRRSV-infected and the neighboring cells. apoptosis could be induced by the local release of cytokines such as TNF- from infected cells. PRRSV nsp4-induced apoptosis represents the first report of 3C-like protease-mediated apoptosis in the genus Arterivirus, family Arteriviridae. apoptosis can be initiated by extrinsic and intrinsic pathways characterized by caspase-8 and caspase-9 activation. blocking caspase-8 activation led to nearly complete inhibition of PRRSV-induced or nsp4-induced apoptosis. further study is necessary to uncover the mechanisms. nsp4 protein is a 22.4 kDa protein, which contains three domains. nsp4 could induce cell apoptosis and all the three domains of nsp4 were essential for it to cause apoptosis. the ability of nsp4 to trigger apoptosis was proved to be dependent on its protease activity."}
