{"summary": "we immunized mice with purified PEDV strain FJzz1/2011. we acquired hybridoma cells by fusing SP20 cells and the spleen cells. the hybridoma cell lines that survived culture in HAT and HT media were screened by IFA against the PEDV strain FJzz1/2011. MAb PN-D4 and PN-D6 recognized only GST-N1, whereas MAb PN-D6 recognized GST-N2. the results showed that the minimum antigenic epitopes that MAbs could recognize were N1-10 (residues 18\u2013133) and N2-10 (residues 252\u2013262). pig TGEV hyperimmune antisera was used as primary antibodies in membranes a,b,c,d and e. pig TGEV hyperimmune antisera was used to test GST-TGEV-N protein and GST tag. pig TGEV hyperimmune antisera was used as primary antibodies. the TGEV strain SH/2012 was detected by the MAb anti-TGEV N protein. the epitopes are highly conserved and specific. the epitopes are highly conserved and specific. residues 18\u2013133 and residues 252\u2013262 of 21 PEDV strains. corresponding antigenic positions of NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 of all strains are colored green and red, respectively. epitopes NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 are highly specific to PEDV. the homology of these two regions between PEDV and all other members of Coronavirinae remains very low (44%) cross-reactivity analysis. peptide was recognized by anti-GST antibody but not by MAb PN-D4. the intrinsically disordered proteins have a high proportion of solvent-exposed residues. the intrinsically disordered proteins have a high proportion of solvent-exposed residues, making them highly accessible to protease. samples were analyzed by Western blotting using PN-D4. to rule out interference of disulfide bridges, reduced and non-reduced GST-NEP-D4 were analyzed using PN-D4. PIDR3127\u2013133 are colored blue, magenta and red. the sequence of N protein with alpha helixes, beta strands and PIDRs. we immunized mice with purified PEDV strain FJzz1/2011. two mutually overlapping GST-fusion-truncated constructs were expressed for detection by MAbs using ELISA. MAb PN-D4 recognized only GST-N1, whereas MAb PN-D6 only recognized GST-N2. pig TGEV hyperimmune antisera was used as primary antibodies in membranes a,b,c,d and e. pig TGEV hyperimmune antisera was used to test GST-TGEV-N protein. the PEDV strain HLJ/2011 was detected by MAb PN-D4. the TGEV strain SH/2012 was detected by the anti-TGEV N protein. the epitopes are highly conserved and specific. amino acid sequence analysis of the two identified epitopes. residues 18\u2013133 and residues 252\u2013262 of 21 Alphacoronavirus strains. corresponding antigenic positions of NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 of all strains are colored green and red. HLJ/2011 could be recognized by both PN-D4 and PN-D6. this suggests these substitutions do not alter the antigenicity of epitopes NEP-D4 and NEP-D6. epitopes NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 are highly conserved. purified GST-tagged NEP-D4 was treated with trypsin and used for detection against PN-D4 or anti-GST antibody by Western blotting. results showed that the treated peptide (up to 5 and 10 cycles) could be recognized by MAb PN-D4 but not by the anti-GST antibody. four additional samples were treated with freeze (80 \u00b0C) and thaw (room temperature) cycles. the reduced and non-reduced GST-NEP-D4 were analyzed by Western blotting using the same antibodies above. conformation of the epitope NEP-D6 is displayed with all residues indicated in the corresponding positions. the predicted disordered regions are colored green and tertiary structures showing PIDR118,19,20,21,22, PIDR2107\u2013116 and PIDR3127\u2013133 are colored blue, magenta and red. the sequence of N protein with alpha helixes, beta strands and PIDRs is represented by orange. u18 and Ile133 were the essential amino acids of the epitope NEP-D4. the deletion of either of these amino acids stopped the recognition between NEP-D4 and PN-D4. Arg252 and Lys262 are crucial amino acids for the binding of epitope NEP-D6 with MAb PN-D6. epitopes NEP-D4 and NEP-D6 were highly conserved and immunogenic. both MAbs PN-D4 and PN-D6 and epitopes NEP-D6 and PN-D6 have the potential for use as effective tools in the serological diagnosis of PEDV during early stages of infection. the homology of NEP-D6 between PEDV and the other three viruses (TGEV, PRCV, and PDCoV) remained at zero. the results showed that neither PN-D4 nor PN-D6 recognized TGEV. the epitope NEP-D6 has 11 amino acids and can be recognized by PN-D6 using Western blotting. the residues 18\u2013133 were constructed based on five templates at nearly 100% confidence. therefore, NEP-D4 is more likely to be a conformational epitope than a linear epitope. this possibility was ruled out by the ability of PN-D4 to react with dithiothreitol (DTT)-treated NEP-D4 in a Western blotting assay. the antibody binds to the first or last residue of the epitope NEP-D4. it may trigger the disordered domain to fold completely to form a conformational site, which could, in turn, be recognized by MAb PN-D4. the complex mechanism remains unclear47. all experiments underwent scrutiny and approval by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the Shanghai Veterinary Research Institute, China. the currently circulating PEDV strain FJzz1/2011 and classical PEDV strain HLJ/2011 were isolated and passaged in vero cell lines supplemented with 5 g/ml trypsin. the purified PEDV suspension was mixed 1:1 with Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant. five BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally (ip) injected with the emulsified PEDV particles at a concentration of 50 g per mouse. spleen cells were removed and fused with SP20 cells. recombinant plasmid was processed by restriction endonucleases BamH1 and Xho1. was cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-6p-1. was expressed at 37 \u00b0C for 5 h in the presence of 1 mM isopropyl -D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) ACAATCTCAACTACGCT N1-5 N1-5U CGGGATCCATGGCTTCTGTCAGCTTTCAGG 1\u2013133 N1-5L GCCCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCT CCAAACAGGAAAGGTCTGACAGCAGCGGCAAAAATACACCTAAGAAGC 241\u2013263 N2-4L TCGAGCTTCCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTGG N2-6 N2-6L TCGAGCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTGG N2-8 N2-8U GATCC GST fusion N protein was coated onto ELISA plates at 0.5 g/well. plates were washed three times with PBST, and ascites fluids raised against PEDV were added as primary antibodies to each well. Western blotting was used to further confirm the minimal antigenic regions targeted by MAbs PN-D4 and PN-D6. the expressed N protein-truncated constructs were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels and were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. after blocking with 5% skimmed milk for 2 h at room temperature, membranes were exposed to primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. MAbs PN-D4 and PN-D6 (1:200) were added to the cells as primary antibodies for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. the cells were then rinsed with PBS three times and stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) after incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 5 min, the cells were rinsed five times and analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy.
