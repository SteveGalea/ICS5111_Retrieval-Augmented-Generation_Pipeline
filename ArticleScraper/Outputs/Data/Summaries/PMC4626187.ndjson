{"summary": "chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1) is a protein of 215 amino acids. it stabilizes nucleosomes and facilitates DNA replication, recombination, repair and gene transcription. HMGB1 exerts actions, which are distinctly different compared with its intracellular functions. each domain contains 80 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 10 kDa. each domain contains 80 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 10 kDa. the HMGB1 B box competes with HMGB1 for receptor activation. SUMO family proteins function as post-translational modifiers by making covalent and reversible connections with other proteins. SUMO-fusion proteins may be cleaved by SUMO proteases. target protein is obtainable with its native N-terminus intact. the expression vector, pSumo-Mut, was modified and obtained from Novobio Scientific (Shanghai, China) Escherichia coli and ArcticExpressTM competent cells (DH5 and DE3 cells, respectively) were also obtained from Novobio Scientific. each PCR reaction mixture (100 l) contained 10 l 10X buffer, 20 M dNTP, 2.5 l Taq DNA polymerase, 1.5 mM Mg2+, 1 l sense and antisense primers (2.5 M), and 2 g cDNA. accuracy of the inserted DNA segment was confirmed by DNA sequencing at Genewix (Suxhou, China) Isopro pyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd.) was added into the culture at a final concentration of 0.2 mM. cells were collected by centrifugation at 95 g for 5 min at room temperature. purified fusion protein was dialyzed overnight with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer. a total of 2 units SUMO protease/50 g fusion protein was added. the mixture was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 30 min. 264.7 cell suspension was seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1105/ml.

SDS-PAGE analysis of purified HMGB1-A-BOX protein. lane 1, purified SUMO-HMGB1-A-BOX fusion protein. lane 2, digested mixture using SUMO protease at 30\u00b0C for 30 min. HMGB1-A-BOX fusion protein was released by cleaving the purified SUMO-HMGB1-A-BOX with SUMO protease. the digested mixture was reloaded onto the Ni2+-IDA-Sepharose CL-6B affinity column for further purification. the purified HMGB1-A-BOX protein was dialyzed overnight with PBS. the HMGB1-A-BOX protein at final concentrations of 100 and 200 g/ml were added into the experimental groups. the control groups demonstrated an impaired cell viability throughout the duration of the experiment. the cell viabilities at 48 h were 79.330.49% for the Control group. the level of TNF- and IL-1 in the control group reached a maximum at 48 h. the level of IL-1 peaked at 12 h (Table II) the level of TNF- was reduced immediately following a 2 h incubation with HMGB1-A-BOX. the maximum inhibition of TNF- was achieved following 48 h incubation. group N levels of IL-1 in the supernatant (pg/ml) are expressed as the mean standard deviation from 20 samples per group. restriction enzyme sites Xbal I and Xhol I were located at the ends of the sequence of the fusion protein. the construct of pSumo-Mut-HMGB1-A-BOX was obtained. the vector map of pSumo-Mut-HMGB1-A-BOX is shown. lanes 2 and 3, supernatant of ArcticExpressTM (DE3)/pSumo-Mut-HMGB1-A-BOX induced at 11\u00b0C with 0.2 mM IPTG for 4 h. lane 2, supernatant of ArcticExpressTM (DE3 cells)/pSumo-Mut-HMGB1-A-BOX induced at 11\u00b0C with 0.2 mM IPTG for 4 h. the SUMO-HMGB1-A-BOX fusion protein was expressed in the precipitate and in the supernatant of ArcticExpressTM DE3 cells/pSumo-Mut-HMGB1-A-BOX induced at 11\u00b0C with 0.2 mM IPTG for 4 h. the supernatant was loaded onto an Ni2+-IDA-Sepharose CL-6B affinity column pre-equilibrated with Ni2+-IDA binding buffer ved fusion protein, SUMO fragments and SUMO protease possessed a His-tag. the purified HMGB1-A-BOX protein was dialyzed overnight with PBS. the final concentration of purified HMGB1-A-BOX protein was determined to be 0.72 mg/ml. HMGB1-A-BOX protein at two concentrations (100 and 200 g/l) was used to investigate effect on cell viability of LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells. HMGB1-A-BOX protein attenuates levels of TNF- and IL-1 TNF- and IL-1 are released at an early stage during the onset of systemic inflammatory responses (16). the levels of IL-1 observed upon incubation with HMGB1-A-BOX were inhibited, reaching the maximum at 24 h. this was postponed compared with the control group, using Student's t-test. HMGB1-A-BOX is a low-molecular-weight protein of 10 kDa. SUMO proteases have been observed to successfully cleave a wide range of sizes (6\u2013110 kDa) of partner proteins fused to SUMO. the yields of the HMGB1-A-BOX fusion protein obtained with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag were acceptable, although removal of the GST tag affected the activity of the target protein. SUMO fusion was reported to enhance protein expression, solubility and purification in prokaryotes (22) this fusion technology is able to improve the expression of the recombinant proteins by protecting them from degradation. recombinant HMGB1-A-BOX protein is considered to compete with HMGB1 for receptor activation. truncation of HMGB1 into individual structural domains revealed that HMGB1-A-box specifically antagonizes the activity of HMGB1 and rescues mice from lethal sepsis (9)."}
