{"summary": "systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by a wide variety of manifestations and a great morbidity and mortality associated with its unpredictable course, uncontrolled activity, organ damage, and adverse side effects produced by its treatment. many studies have been conducted to find an effective biological agent to treat SLE. but most of them have not achieved their primary endpoint and force physicians to use biological drugs as off-label agents when trying to control a re 1982 criteria include arthritis, photosensitivity, oral ulcers, presence of antinuclear antibodies, anti-ds-DNA antibodies (ab) and lymphopenia 1500/mm3 on at least two occasions. she started treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 400 mg/12 h combined with LEF 20 mg/day and low-dose prednisone with an irregular control. a chest computed tomography scan was performed to confirm the presence of a pneumonic consolidation in the left lower lobe, as well as mild bilateral pleural and pericardial thickening. both tests ruled out pulmonary thromboembolism and a fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed without any signs of infection or malignancy. the patient remains asymptomatic with subcutaneous belimumab 200 mg/week and without prednisone. all markers of SLE activity remain low, with ESR 14 mm Hg, CRP 0.82 mg/dL, and anti-ds-DNA ab 2 UI/mL, and the SLEDAI score has decreased to 0. Pleuropericarditis is a relatively frequent manifestation of SLE. serositis appears to be associated with nephropathy, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, hypocomplementemia, leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased anti-ds-DNA ab in the first study mentioned and with active lupus disease, fever 38 \u00b0C, and high D-dimer in the second study. belimumab acted as a corticosteroid-sparing agent, with the ability to reduce corticosteroid intake to half its original dose and later in combination with MTX, to none (2). the immunosuppressant therapy with MTX was discontinued when starting the biological treatment. after 4 months of treatment, the patient went into remission, and MTX was stopped again. belimumab was used as a first biological treatment option in SLE pleuropericarditis. it could have a great effect in controlling SLE activity and in allowing a reduction in corticosteroid intake. despite the need for further studies to confirm our results, belimumab could constitute an effective alternative in the treatment of active SLE with predominant musculoskeletal manifestations."}
