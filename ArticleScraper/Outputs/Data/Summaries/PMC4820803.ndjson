{"summary": "the most effective RNA interference fragments of the S and M genes were constructed in pSilencer-3.0-H1 vectors and designated pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M. the antiviral effect of pSilencer-S/M against HTNV was evaluated in both HTNV-infected Vero-E6 cells and mice. Hantaviruses are one of the important emerging and re-emerging viral groups. they lead to two severe febrile diseases worldwide, ie, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia due to old world hantavirus and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the Americas due to new world hantavirus. RNA interference (RNAi) is a short, double-strand RNA induced-process that can target the mRNA of a specific sequence for degradation9,10. RNAi technology is recognized as a promising, novel nucleic acid-based tool for use against various diseases. RNAis has also been reported to potently and specifically inhibit the replication of different viruses. the stocks of Hantaan virus strain 76\u2013118 were obtained from the Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (Beijing, China) HTNV titration was performed regularly based on indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) as described previously. the shRNA was generated using the MessageMuterTM shRNA production kit (Qiagen) as described previously12. the cells were grown in 24-well plates to 80%\u201390% confluence. at 24 h after transfection, the cells were infected with 100 TCID50 HTNV 76\u2013118 (100 L per well) the viral titers were determined at 96 hpi. the plasmids were identified as pSilencer-S and pSilencer-3.0-H1. the oligonucleotides were inserting into pSilencer-3.0-H1 vector. the 80%-90% confluent cells were then transfected with 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 g of the pSilencer-S, pSilencer-M or pSilencer 3.0 antigen slides were prepared to detect the HTNV protein expressions by IFA. at 5 dpi, the cultures were subjected to two cycles of freezing and thawing followed by centrifugation at low speed (1000g) the supernatants were then serially diluted, inoculated on the cells, and finally titrated by IFA. the brains, lungs and kidneys were dissected from the sacrificed animals (n=4) at the experimental point of 5 dpi, the brains, lungs and kidneys were harvested, weighed and homogenized into a 10% (weight/volume) suspension in test medium. the homogenates were frozen and thawed twice and centrifuged at 3000 rounds per minute for 10 min. HTNV, pGEM-T/human GAPDH, and pGEM-T/mouse GAPDH were stored in our laboratory and used to generate the standard curves. the absolute quantification of the HTNV viral gene was performed as previously described20. the stocks of Hantaan virus strain 76\u2013118 were obtained from the Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (Beijing, China) HTNV titration was performed regularly based on indirect immunofluorescence assay. the TCID50 was determined to be 106/0.1 mL. the cells were grown in 24-well plates to 80%\u201390% confluence. at 24 h after transfection, the cells were infected with 100 TCID50 HTNV 76\u2013118 (100 L per well) the viral titers were determined at 96 hpi. the shRNA S1 and shRNA M2 were found to be the most effective shRNAs in terms of the inhibition of HTNV. clone PCR and enzyme digestion, the identified shRNA expression plasmids were sent for sequence analysis for further confirmation. the oligonucleotides inserting into pSilencer-3.0-H1 vector were then designated pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M. the cells from individual wells (2-g plasmid transfection groups) were collected at 2 dpi. at 5 dpi, the cultures were subjected to two cycles of freezing and thawing followed by centrifugation at low speed. the supernatants were then serially diluted, inoculated on the cells, and finally titrated by IFA. at 8 dpi, the brains, lungs and kidneys were dissected from the sacrificed animals (n=4) at the experimental point of 5 dpi, the brains, lungs and kidneys were harvested, weighed and homogenized into a 10% (weight/volume) suspension in test medium. the homogenates were frozen and thawed twice and centrifuged at 3000 rounds per minute for 10 min. the plasmid pGEM-T/HTNV, pGEM-T/human GAPDH, and pGEM-T/mouse GAPDH were stored in our laboratory. the absolute quantification of the HTNV viral gene was performed as previously described20. the data are presented as vRNA copies/ng of GAPDH mRNA. the transfections of the 4 shRNAs resulted in the inhibition of viral RNA transcription at 24 hpi of 65.72%1.7% (S1), 56.8%4.8% (S2), 55.17%6.9% (M1) and 64.9%5.7% (M2) (P0.05 vs the virus group) no protective effect was observed in the cells treated with shCRK. the four shRNAs reduced the HTNV yields by approximately 4 log10 (S) and 2 log10 (M) compared with the control (Figure 1C) the shRNAs that targeted the S and M segments of the HTNV gene were able to inhibit RNA transcript and virus production in the HTNV-infected cells. shRNA-S1 and shRNA-M2 were further selected for insertion into the pSilencer-3.0-H1 of the RNAi vector protein staining in the 2-g pSilencer-S treatment group compared to 56.8%3.21% in the pSilencer-blank treatment group. corresponding glycoprotein G2 positive staining rates were 14.8%2.41% and 58.33%6.24% in the 2-g pSilencer-M treatment group (Figure 2I). these results indicate that the 2-g plasmid transfection achieved the most effective inhibition of viral protein synthesis. slides were prepared at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 dpi to detect the viral antigens. the greatest inhibitory rates were noted at 3 dpi. vero-E6 cells were transfected with 2.0 g of pSilence-S, pSilence-M or pSilence-blank. the cells were harvested for RNA purification and real-time PCR at 48 hpi (A) the viral titers of the frozen-thawed culture samples were measured at 5 dpi. pSilence-S and pSilence-M treatments in lethal HTNV challenge model. for each group, 8 mice were monitored for survival (A), 4 mice per group were sacrificed. on 8 dpi, the viral loads in the lungs, kidneys and brains were determined by viral titration (B) pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M treatments decreased the severities of the viral lesions in the brain, lung and kidney tissues. the suckling mice were infected with lethal doses of HTNV 76\u2013118 and treated with pSilence-S or pSilence-M. no protective effect was observed in the vero-E6 cells treated with shCRK. the cells were transfected with 60 nmol/L shRNA-S1, -S2 (A), -M1, -M2 (B) or shCRK as a control. the cells were harvested for RNA purification and real-time PCR. pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M were designated pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M. the resultant vectors were designated pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M. the transfection efficiencies were evaluated according to the GFP expression of the co-transfected plasmid pEGFP-C1. the cells were transfected with 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 g of pSilencer-S (A\u2013E), pSilence-M or pSilence-blank (F) followed by infection with HTNV 76\u2013118. the samples were fixed at 72 hpi and stained with the monoclonal antibody A35 targeting the nucleocapsid (A\u2013G, green color) the greatest inhibitory rates were noted at 3 dpi (76.1%1.3% for pSilencer-S and 78.2%2.4% for pSilencer-M, Figure 2J). the antiviral effect lasted at least 7 d (43.5%3.4% for pSilencer-S and 46.7%3.2% for pSilencer-M at 7 dpi). pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M significantly reduced viral RNA transcripts, viral antigen synthesis and progeny virus production in the HTNV-infected Vero-E6 cells. compared with the pSilencer-blank group, the pSilencer-S- and pSilencer-M-treated animals died later and exhibited reduced clinical signs including weight loss. HTNV RNA profiles in the brains were determined by viral titration (B) no infectious viral particles were detected in the lungs, kidneys, or brains of the survivors at 15 dpi. the dynamic viral loads in the brains were analyzed by qRT-PCR. hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of the lungs, kidneys and brains collected from each experimental group at 8 dpi are shown. we demonstrated that vector-based shRNAs targeting specific sequences in the S and M segments of HTNV inhibited expression and replication of HTNV in vitro and in vivo. ribavirin can induce an up to 3.6-fold decrease in the vRNA level in HTNV infection at 4 dpi20. this is equivalent to the in vitro effects of pSilencer-S and -M. the RNAi plasmid treatments increased survival rate to 27.3% in a lethal HTNV-infected suckling mouse model. the transfection of shRNA-encoding plasmids is probably best-suited for treatment of acute viral infections. a number of barriers to medical application remain to be solved, eg."}
