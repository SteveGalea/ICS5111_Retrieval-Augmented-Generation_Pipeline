{"summary": "respiratory tract infections are a major cause of hospital admission in infants and young children. they are caused by a broad spectrum of established respiratory tract pathogens, particularly by viruses including the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the most important cause of severe respiratory tract infections in young children. studies investigating the entire spectrum of established respiratory tract pathogens are rare. the first polyomaviruses were isolated in 1971 and named JC virus and BK virus. in 2007 and 2008 3 further viruses of this particular family were described for the first time. no system for in vitro or in vivo propagation has been discovered, neither a cell line nor an animal model. novel virus has a 5229 bp dsDNA genome with a GC-content of 39%. the genome contains an early coding region encoding the T-antigens, a late coding region encoding structural proteins, and a non-coding control region. the sequence identity of WUPyV at the amino acid level to all of the well-known polyomaviruses ranged from 15% \u2013 49%. the genome of members of both subclasses is divided into three regions. the early coding region encodes at least the small T-antigen and the large T-antigen. both are binding partners of the RB-protein and p53. infection with BKV takes place in early childhood; 90% of 5\u20139 years old children are seropositive. the incubation period of WUPyV infections is unknown. the viral entry route for WUPyV is not completely defined. JC virus is made responsible for upper and lower respiratory tract diseases, e.g. bronchiolitis, croup, and pneumonia. so far, sites of persistence have not been identified. the virus has not been detected in urine. direct detection of viral protein or viral nucleic acids is the mode of choice for respiratory virus diagnostics. less time consuming methods have been developed, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), antigen-specific ELISA, antigen-specific IFA, and very fast immunochromatographic assays. the PCR displays the highest sensitivity. the age of WUPyV infected patients ranged from a few weeks to 53 years. infections were predominantly detected in late winter, spring, and early summer. high infection rates were reported for study populations preselected for lack of immunocompetence. therapy To this time there are no studies available concerning therapeutic interventions. no causal association between WUPyV and respiratory disease has been shown. studies on therapeutic interventions are not to be expected in the near future. the association of mouse pneumotropic polyomavirus with intestinal pneumonia and significant mortality [48] indicates that polyomaviruses have the capacity to be respiratory tract pathogens. many studies correlating the detection of WUPyV with the incidence of respiratory symptoms argue for this hypothesis. the association of WUPyV with other diseases, particularly tumour diseases, has not been sufficiently investigated yet. the currently available data neither prove nor deny WUPyV to be a respiratory tract pathogen. to be investigated."}
