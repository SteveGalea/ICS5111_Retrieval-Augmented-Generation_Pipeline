{"summary": "hantaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses belonging to the family of Bunyaviridiae. in humans, they give rise to a spectrum of illnesses called hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in the Americas. HCPS carries a mortality rate of 40%, whereas the mortality in HFRS is lower (0.4%\u201315%), but the incidence of HFRS is substantially higher. study was carried out at Tampere University Hospital and University of Tampere School of Medicine, Finland. all patients came from Pirkanmaa region and were hospitalized because of serologically confirmed PUUV infection. nine of the patients also participated in a previous study determining platelet indices and functions during acute PUUV infection. one patient had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 1 patient had undergone splenectomy because of hereditary spherocytosis. the measurement of procoagulant activity of MPs and coagulation variables was all collected at the same time, median 7 days (range 1\u201312 days) from the beginning of fever. blood samples were collected and centrifuged at 1700g for 15 minutes. plasma was then separated, further centrifuged at 13,000g for 2 minutes, and frozen at 700C. lipid concentration reflects the amount of thrombin generation. concentration of MPs in normal plasma is usually 5 nmol/L (expressed as phophatidylserine equivalent) study group consisted of 33 prospectively collected consecutive adult patients (22 males), median age 45 years (range 21\u201367 years) twenty-nine of the patients also participated in a previous study determining platelet indices and functions during acute PUUV infection. serum TPO level and procoagulant activity of plasma MPs were collected. blood samples were centrifuged at 1700g for 15 minutes. plasma was then separated, further centrifuged at 13,000g for 2 minutes. circulating MPs in the plasma sample bind to Annexin V on the microplate surface. exposed phospholipid concentration reflects the amount of thrombin generation. concentration of MPs in normal plasma is usually 5 nmol/L. clinical and basic laboratory findings in 33 patients with acute Puumala hantavirus infection. eighteen (55%) of the patients were smokers. 10 (30%) of the patients had signs of bleeding tendency, mostly mild mucosal bleeds. large MPV and IPF% coincided with elevated serum TPO level. large MPV and IPF% coincided with elevated serum TPO level. association was noted between serum TPO level and IPF%. high serum TPO associated with impaired aggregation triggered with all 5 agonists (for adrenalin, r = 0.69, P 0.001; for adenosine diphosphate, r = 0.77, P 0.001; for arachidonic acid, r = 0.67, P = 0.001; for collagen, r = 0.63, P =.002; for ristocetin, r = 0.50, P =.03; for ristocetin, plasma coagulation variables d-dimer was 7-fold higher acutely compared with the value measured at control visit in this group of PUUV-infected patients. both d-dimer and F1 + 2 associated with minimum platelet count (r = 0.48, P = 0.01 and r = 0.46, P = 0.02, respectively) patient 1 was a 61-year-old previously smoking male who needed intensive care treatment. patient 2 was a 28-year-old smoking male with a need of temporary hemodialysis treatment. both patients had very low platelet count minimum, high acute TPO and IPF%, and prolonged closure times measured with PFA-100. median creatinine value of patients was 167 mol/L (range 68\u2013983 mol/L) in the control (recovery phase) sample, the platelet count of all patients had recovered. in all patients, the platelet count exceeded the lower limit of reference range 150 109 cells/L. serum thrombopoietin median 258 pg/mL, range 74\u20131258 pg/mL vs. median 133 pg/mL, range 56\u2013336 pg/mL, P = 0.02. high serum TPO level coinciding still with thrombocytopenia associated with impaired platelet functions studied by both PFA-100 and Multiplate. no association was found between serum acute-phase TPO level and plasma creatinine, minimum or maximum daily urinary output, gain of weight, or need of transient hemodialysis. d-dimer was 7-fold higher acutely compared with the value measured at control visit in this group of PUUV-infected patients. both d-dimer and F1 + 2 associated with minimum platelet count. MPs\u2019 activity in the acute phase of the disease did not differ from the activity observed at the recovery when patients were divided into 2 groups based on the platelet count. both patients had a very low platelet count minimum, high acute TPO and IPF%. TPO did not associate with AKI, the major outcome of HFRS. the markedly increased F1 + 2 and d-dimer further support the idea of platelet consumption in the vasculature. antiretroviral therapy corrects both plasma TGF level and platelet count. high plasma IL-6 increases TPO production both in vitro and in vivo. high plasma level of TPO is suggested to predict sepsis severity. Flow cytometry is the most widely used method to study MPs. increased thrombin formation (F1 + 2) and fibrinolysis (d-dimer) associated with the severity of AKI could plausibly explain our observation. plasma level of TPO or MPs\u2019 activity could not predict severe hantavirus disease in the 33 patients of this study. the 2 severely ill patients had particularly high TPO level and percentage of young platelets. the finding regarding MPs\u2019 activity on these 2 individual patients was inconsistent."}
