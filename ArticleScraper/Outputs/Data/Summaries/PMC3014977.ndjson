{"summary": "lectin DC-SIGN (CD209) is the major dengue receptor on human dendritic cells. a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region of CD209 is susceptible to many infectious diseases. variations in the DC-SIGN gene might have a broad influence on viral replication and host immune responses. dengue viruses are arthropod-borne flaviviruses that cause dengue fever (DF) with significant morbidity and mortality in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. a more severe form of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), has been recognized worldwide. the CD209 molecule plays an important role in the early interaction of a pathogen with a dendritic cell [6]\u2013[8] and has a key role in DC-T cell interaction [9], DC migration [10], [11], and pathogen uptake [12]. the CD209 gene is located on chromosome 19p13.2\u20133 and is highly polymorphic. the rs4804803 SNP in the promoter region of CD209 was associated with the susceptibility to DF and/or DHF in Taiwanese. we aimed to test whether the rs4804803 SNP in the promoter region of CD209 was associated with the susceptibility to DF and/or DHF in Taiwanese. HF criteria include a reduced platelet count (100,000/mm3), petechiae, hemorrhagic manifestation, and plasma leakage showing hemoconcentration. patients with DF were defined by detectable DEN-2 RNA by RT-PCR or DEN-specific IgM, but without evidence of DHF. the PCR was conducted in total volume of 15 L using the following amplification protocol: denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 20 s, followed by annealing and extension at 60\u00b0C for one minute. the genotype of each sample was determined by measuring the allele-specific fluorescence in the ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detection System. monocyte-derived dendritic cells were infected with DEN-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 for 2 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. cells were washed twice to remove cell-free virus, and cultured in complete RPMI medium (without cytokines) cells and supernatants were removed and analyzed at 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection. RT-PCR products were visualized on ethidium bromide-stained 1.5% agarose (Pierce Co., Rockford, IL, USA) gel with a 100- bp ladder. to measure the CD209 cell surface expression, MDDCs were stained with FITC-conjugated mAbs specific for DC-SIGN (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) differences between patients with DEN, DF, DHF, OFI and population controls were determined using two-sided Chi-Square test or Fisher exact test. the Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical comparison of continuous variables. a clinical diagnosis of DHF was assigned according to the DHF criteria of the world health organization (WHO) patients with DF were defined by detectable DEN-2 RNA by RT-PCR or DEN-specific IgM. patients with other non-dengue febrile illnesses were defined by febrile illness. the probe sequences were 5\u2032-TACCTGCCTACCCTT G-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTGCCCACC CTTG-3\u2032. the probes were labeled with the TaqMan fluorescent dyes VIC and FAM. the PCR was conducted in total volume of 15 L using the following amplification protocol. monocyte-derived dendritic cells were infected with DEN-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 for 2 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. cells were washed twice to remove cell-free virus, and cultured in complete RPMI medium (without cytokines) cells and supernatants were removed and analyzed 24 h post-infection. PCR cycling parameters were 40 cycles of PCR reactions at 94\u00b0C for 20 s, and 60\u00b0C for one minute. the results were detected in real-time and recorded on a plot showing fluorescence vs. time. Alleles and genotypes distribution of rs4804803 are presented as numbers (percentages) differences between patients with DEN, DF, DHF, OFI, and population controls were determined using two-sided Chi-Square test or Fisher exact test. a patient manifested with abdominal pain had ascites as evidenced by abdominal ultrasonography was classified as DF because the patient revealed no thrombocytopenia (100,000/mm3), petechia or hemorrhagic manifestation during the admission period. the patient revealed no thrombocytopenia (100,000/mm3), petechia or hemorrhagic manifestation during the admission period. genemic DNA obtained from DEN patients, OFI patients and population controls was genotyped for rs4804803 SNP. GG/AG genotypes in 16.0% of the DEN patients were significantly higher than OFI patients (5.6%, OR = 3.23, p = 0.002) and population controls (7.5%, OR = 2.36, p = 0.020; Table 2). analysis of the allele distribution between DEN and OFI patients showed that the G allele frequency was higher in DEN patients (8.4%), compared with OFI patients (2.8%, OR = 3.17, p = 0.002) or population controls (3.8%, OR = 2.34, p = 0.018; Table 3). no association of CD209 336 A/G polymorphism (rs4804803) with primary and secondary dengue infection. rs4804803 GG/AG genotypes were found in 12.5% of patients with primary DEN infection and 16.3% of patients with secondary DEN infection. dengue infection is defined by detectable DEN-specific IgM and IgG, respectively, within one week of the illness. a significant increase in CD209 mRNA expression was detected in the MDDCs from individuals with AG genotype. the results are shown as mean s.e.m. from subjects with rs4804803 or AG genotype. the surface CD209 expression declined along with infection in subjects with both genotypes. DEN-2 replication was significantly higher in MDDCs from individuals with rs4804803 AA genotype than those with AG genotype at 48 h post-infection. the results are shown as mean s.e.m. from subjects with AA genotype in three independent experiments. cytokines TNF, IL-12p40, and chemokine IP-10 production in DEN-infected MDDCs with AG genotype of rs4804803. results showed that MDDCs with AG genotype had significantly higher TNF production than those with AA genotype at 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection. 620.60175.56 pg/mL vs. 243.0241.64 pg/mL, 889.9291.46 pg/ml vs. 168.0224.02 pg/mL, and 614.4449.16 pg/mL vs. 322.3269.62 pg/mL; p = 0.034, 0.009 and 0.010. IP-10 production by MDDCs involved in viral replication of DEN infection is a potent chemoattractant for activated T and NK cells [26], and the modulation of adaptive immune response [27]. DEN-infected MDDCs with AG genotype produced higher levels of IP-10, which might block viral entry or viral replication in MDDCs. the percentage of viral replication (A) and the production of IP-10 levels (B) following DEN-2 infection were significantly higher by MDDCs from individuals with AG genotype than from individuals with AA genotype. the results are shown as mean SEM from three independent experiments (n = 7). the patient revealed no thrombocytopenia (100,000/mm3), petechia or hemorrhagic manifestation during the admission period.

DEN-2 replication was significantly higher in MDDCs from individuals with AA genotype than those with AG genotype at 48 h post-infection. cytokines TNF, IL-12p40, and chemokine IP-10 production increased in DEN-infected MDDCs with AG genotype of rs4804803. results showed that MDDCs with AG genotype had significantly higher TNF production than those with AA genotype at 24 and 48 hr post-infection. the MCP-1 levels peaked at 48 hr in subjects with both genotypes', but there was no significant difference between AA genotype and AG genotype. the production of TNF (A), IL-12p40 (B) and IP-10 (C) levels after DEN-2 infection was significantly higher in MDDCs from individuals with AG genotype. -infected bystander DCs in response to DEN infection, is a potent chemoattractant for activated T and NK cells [26], and the modulation of adaptive immune response [27]. cells from individuals with AG genotype showed an augmented innate immune reaction, showing higher levels of IP-10 production, post-infection. the percentage of viral replication (A) and the production of IP-10 levels (B) following DEN-2 infection were significantly higher by MDDCs from individuals with AG genotype than from individuals with AA genotype. the results are shown as mean SEM from three independent experiments (n = 7) rs4804806 SNP was associated with DHF vs. OFI control. GG genotypes of rs4804803 were associated with protection against DHF. DF was defined by criteria of severe dengue fever syndrome with hemorrhage but no plasma leakage. the difference between these two studies might be due to different cell types and ex vivo culture systems. in the study, it was found that MDDCs from subjects with rs4804803 AG genotype had higher surface DC-SIGN expression with higher production of chemokines such as IP-10, which could limit DEN-2 replication. rs4804803 SNP was involved in the DC-SIGN expression associated with augmented immune response, such as the increase in the production of IP-10 that repressed the replication of DEN. this is supported by the fact that altered immune response, but not viral load, was observed in DHF patients."}
