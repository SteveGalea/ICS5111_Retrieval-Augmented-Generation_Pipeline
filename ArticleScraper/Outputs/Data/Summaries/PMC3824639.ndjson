{"summary": "a classification system named PIRO was developed to stratify patients on the basis of their predisposition, the nature and extent of insult/infection, nature and magnitude of response, and degree of concomitant organ dysfunction. the integrity of the human body and its close interaction with the environment are emphasized in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Zheng diagnosis. study applied TCM Zheng diagnosis in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock to see if such diagnosis can be adopted as an early predictor of mortality. we also wanted to probe for significant differences between septic patients with and without this predictive TCM Zheng. pathogen excess () and human body deficiency () were finalized. the pathogen-excess type manifests in early phases of sepsis. the human body-deficiency type manifests in late phases of sepsis. TCM Zheng Diagnostic criteria Type Zheng Body temperature Signsa Pulse Tongue Pathogen-excess type Qi-phase heat Fever (BT > 38\u00b0C) Sweating Thirsty Nausea/vomiting Abdominal distension Abdominal pain Constipation Diarrhea With yellowish coating Nutrient-phase heat Delirium Rapid (HR > 100 beats/min) sample size was calculated based on our pilot study. 35 patients in the group with and 53 in the group without Yang-Xu Zheng had to provide a power of 90% and 5% of two-sided type 1 error for prevalence of Yang-Xu Zheng. this was calculated by a two-sided proportion test on the assumption that there was a 40% survival rate in the group with versus 75% survival rate in the group without Yang-Xu Zheng. signs to diagnose TCM Zhengs were examined by only one attending physician (YYC) with both western and Chinese professional training and medical licenses. patient's survival or death in MICU was assessed during a follow-up of a 28-day interval. two major theories of infectious disease in TCM, treatise on cold damage diseases, and treatise on warm heat disease, became central topics. pathogen excess () and human body deficiency (25\u201327) were finalized in the pathogen-excess type. pathogen-excess type manifests in early phases of sepsis, while host inflammatory reaction is very active. Qi-, Blood-, Yin-, and Yang-Xu (,,,,) were the four TCM Zhengs finalized in human body-deficiency type. experts' opinions on the hypothesis of pathogenesis reached consensus. aEach Zheng was diagnosed when either sign appeared. bBleeding in any part of the body was included, except the skin. informed consent was obtained from patients or their family members. prevalence of Yang-Xu Zheng was calculated by a two-sided proportion test (z test) on the assumption that there was a 40% survival rate in the group with versus 75% survival rate in the group without Yang-Xu Zheng. age, gender, TCM Zheng diagnosis, and clinical and laboratory measurements were collected. 126 sepsis patients were consecutively enrolled: 71 survivors and 55 non-survivors (43.7%) who died within 6.6 5.7 days after MICU admission. APACHE II score significantly higher among non-survivors. is at ICU admission Severe sepsis 12 (16.9%) 4 (7.3%) NSa Septic shock 59 (83.1%) 51 (92.7%) NS Severity scoring APACHE II 28.5 7.6 31.6 7.7 0.02 Source of infectionb Respiratory tract 38 (53.5%) 26 (47.3%) NS Urogenital tract 39 (54.9%) NS Liver and biliary tract 2 (2.8%) 4 (7.3%) NSa Intra-abdomen 0 ( only 6.3% and 4.8% of patients had blood-Xu Zheng and Yin-Xu Zheng. there was no significance with regard to frequency of all TCM Zhengs between patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Survivors and nonsurvivors Among three pathogen-excess types, only frequency of Nutrient-phase heat Zheng was significantly higher in the non-survivor group. incidence of both Qi- and Yang-Xu Zheng was higher in non-survivors. multivariate logistic regression was performed by including age, gender, APACHE II score, Nutrient-phase heat, and Yang-Xu Zheng in the model. only Yang-Xu Zheng proved statistically significant in the full model, which had a prediction rate of 70.6%.

Diagnostic signs of Yang-Xu Zheng as independent predictors of sepsis mortality. both theories originate from Huangdi's Internal Classic (25\u201327) and (2) manifestations of septic patients cover signs and symptoms described in treatise on cold damage diseases (Shanghanlun) results show complexity of disease progress and TCM Zheng transitions in septic patients. patients with Yang-Xu Zheng had significantly higher APACHE II scores and host response cytokine values. cool extremities and weak pulse, both diagnostic signs of Yang-Xu Zheng, were found significant prognostic predictors of sepsis mortality. the first 24 hours after admission to MICU was the \u201cDay 1\u201d in our study. it was to be expected that there would be inherent lead-time bias in this study. this study can be criticized for potential observer bias, but is supported by other factors. highly variable signs and symptoms of sepsis emanate from the complex immune reaction and host response. Yang-Xu Zheng serves as independent and significant prognostic predictor."}
