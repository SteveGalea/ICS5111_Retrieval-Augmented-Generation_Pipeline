{"summary": "influenza is a serious respiratory illness that is caused by the influenza virus, a negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae. the virus leads to seasonal epidemics as well as global pandemics. in the united states alone, the virus is responsible for more than 35,000 deaths and 200,000 hospitalizations each year. nanotrap particles are a versatile technology that can address these critical diagnostic challenges. nanotrap particles are capable of concentrating analytes of interest from large volumes of complex biological fluids (such as nasal aspirates) into a significantly smaller volume (as low as 25 L) nanotrap particles can be used at both ambient and elevated temperatures. this novel sample preparation methodology has been used for the concentration and enhanced detection of infectious disease proteins. the nanotrap particles were originally designed to specifically harvest proteins and other small molecules. recent findings by Shafagati et al have shown that the nanotrap particles can also be used in the capture and detection of virions. the nanotrap particles were incubated with one milliliter of Influenza A/California/04/09 (IA H1N1) at 5E+05 pfu/mL. viral RNA was extracted and the amount of virus captured was determined using qRT-PCR. NT46 provided a 10-fold increase in detection compared to samples without Nanotrap particles. one milliliter of Influenza A/California/4/2009 (IA H1N1), Influenza A/Brisbane/10/2007 (IA H3N2), or Influenza B/Taiwan/2/62 (Influenza B) were diluted to 1E+05 pfu/mL in PBS. samples were centrifuged, unbound material removed, and the pellet was washed one time with 200 L distilled water nanotrap particles bind and captured influenza A hemagglutinin proteins. NT46 was the most efficient at capturing HA protein from IA H1N1 (HA1). hemagglutinin protein was captured by western blot. his-HA proteins (1 g/mL) from H1N1, H5N1, and H7N7 were incubated with 100 L NT46 for 30 minutes at room temperature. samples in panels A-D were analyzed for the presence of Influenza HA by western blot. in 1 mL PBS, the swab head was cut and placed in a spin basket on top of the microcentrifuge tube containing the sample. the sample transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube and 100 L of NT46 or NT46V was added to each sample. n.s. is not significant. nasopharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates and washes, deep nasal swabs, throat swabs, and saliva swabs and aspirates. the next set of experiments set out to demonstrate that reactive red particles enrich virus in these clinically relevant matrices. the capture efficiency of NT46 and NT46V was then tested in a swab scenario. the swab was suspended in 950l saline solution, the swab heads spun down to remove all fluid. the nanotrap particles were able to concentrate IA H1N1. NT46 enhanced influenza A virus detection at both high and low titers. the goal of the next set of experiments was to utilize the nanotrap particles to concentrate virus and increase the lower limit of detection. IA H1N1 was diluted from 1E+05 pfu/mL to 1E+01 pfu/ml in saline (panel A), 1E+05 pfu/ml to 1E+01 pfu/ml in nasal wash (panel B), or 1E+05 pfu/ml to 1E+00 pfu/ml in 10% human saliva (panel E) and incubated with NT46 nanotrap particles enhanced detection of multiple respiratory pathogens. RT-PCR and 2E+01 pfu/ml for plaque assays. n.s. is not significant. nanotrap particles enhanced detection of respiratory viruses in a coinfection scenario. it is important for a nanotrap particle to enrich virus not only in the presence of other host and viral analytes, but also in the presence of other infectious pathogens. ifornia/4/2009 (IA H1N1), Influenza A/Brisbane/10/2007 (IA H3N2) or a combination of the two viruses were diluted to 1E+05 pfu/mL in PBS and incubated with NT46. samples were processed and analyzed for qRT PCR with viral-specific primers. a decrease in IA H1N1 detection in the presence of IA H1N1 fell from 9-fold for IA H1N1 alone to 7-fold in the coinfection scenario. the results indicate that NT46 can capture and concentrate a variety of different viruses in a coinfection scenario. however, while enrichment with NT46 remained high, various viruses may be competing with each other for NT46 binding. no NT samples (at 100 L volumes) were processed in parallel. discussions have traditionally been used for the capture and enrichment of proteins. nanotrap particles can dramatically concentrate Lyme disease antigens in urine. NT46 contains a reactive red dye. it has a negative charge and has been used for protein purification via affinity chromatography. it is possible that triazine dyes may bind to molecules involved in infection mediated by viral envelope proteins. nasopharyngeal and saliva samples contain viscous analytes that non-specifically bind to antibodies and can significantly decrease detection. molecular assays and RIDTs allow testing of only 50\u2013120 L of sample. the nanotrap particle can be coupled to a multiplex assay that allows for the testing of various pathogens in one panel. it has previously been shown that nanotrap particles work in a mixed infection scenario with RVFV and HIV coinfection. the nanotrap can successfully capture and detect multiple viral pathogens in one sample. there is no published data on the capture of bacteria with Nanotrap particles. the nanotrap particles have been used for the capture of influenzae. affinity baits are being consistently tested to determine if there are any baits that can substitute to generate a particle with capture and recovery performance to the particles that are in limited supply. the nanotrap particles will be coupled to point-of-care diagnostic devices (RIDTs) that can rapidly (30 minutes) detect various respiratory pathogens. viral RNA was extracted and the amount of virus captured was determined using qRT-PCR. all 5 Nanotrap particles successfully captured and enriched the virus. NT46 provided a 10-fold increase in detection compared to samples without Nanotrap particles. samples were centrifuged, unbound material removed, and unbound material was discarded. NT46 was the best performer, providing an 8-fold increase in detection compared to the no Nanotrap control. NT46 was the most efficient at capturing HA protein from IA H1N1 (HA1). NT46 was able to capture as little as 10 ng/mL of HA1 protein. this yielded approximately 100 fold enrichment compared to the no NT control. g/mL from H1N1, H7N2, and H7N7 were incubated with 100 L NT46 for 30 minutes at room temperature. control samples are His-HA at 100 g/mL and/or 10 g/mL. no NT (1 g/mL of His-HA) sample at a volume of 10 L processed in parallel. samples were processed for qRT-PCR as described in Figure 1. no NT samples (at 100 L volumes) were processed in parallel. n.s. is not significant. nanotrap particles with an outer shell surrounding the particle core have previously been shown to function well in serum. it was speculated that the incorporation of an outer shell would deter viral and host proteins in nasal fluid and saliva from binding to the nanotrap particles. in parallel to NT46, two additional red particles with different architectures were tested for Influenza capture. IA H1N1 was spiked into nasal fluid and 50l of the spiked samples were added onto a swab. both nanotrap particles were able to concentrate IA H1N1. NT46V resulted in a 5-fold increase in detection compared to NT46. NT46 enhanced influenza A virus detection at both high and low titers. viral shedding is highest by 48 hours after infection with Influenza. IA H1N1 was diluted from 7.5E+05 pfu/ml to 7.5E+02 pfu/ml in saline solution (panel D) or diluted from 2.0E+04 pfu/ml to 2.0E+02 pfu/ml in 10% human saliva (panel E) and incubated with NT46. two enveloped RNA viruses were tested with and without nanotrap particles. four out of the five Nanotrap particles captured and enriched RSV. NT46 once again was the best performer for both viruses. a mock coinfection scenario was performed by incubating NT46 with a sample containing both IA H1N1 and IA H3N2 at 1E+05 pfu/mL in saline solution. there was no significant change in detection for the no Nanotrap samples in the presence of multiple viruses. IA H1N1, Influenza B/Taiwan/2/62 (IB) or a combination of the two viruses were diluted to 1E+05 pfu/mL (for IA) or 1E+05 genomic copies/5L (for CoV) in PBS. samples were processed and analyzed for qRT PCR with viral-specific primers. a decrease in RSV detection was seen in the presence of IA H1N1. NT46 can capture and concentrate a variety of different viruses in a coinfection scenario. however, while enrichment with NT46 remained high, various viruses may be competing with each other for NT46 binding. nanotrap particles rapidly capture influenza A virus. the nanotrap particles can dramatically concentrate Lyme disease antigens in urine and enhance detection at previously undetectable concentrations. most recently, a 2011 paper by Douglas et al demonstrated that the nanotrap particles can also be used for the enrichment and protection of viral antigens such as RVFV NP. the structure of the triazine dyes mimics the structure of substrates that bind to the active sites of different proteins. it is possible that triazine dyes may bind to molecules involved in the infection mediated by viral envelope proteins. s and RIDTs allow testing of only 50\u2013120 L of sample with nanotrap particles. there is significant enrichment of both saliva and nasal aspirate samples with NT46. NT46V contains an outer polymer shell functionalized with sulfonic acid groups. the nanotrap particle can be coupled to a multiplex assay that allows for the testing of various pathogens in one panel. it has previously been shown that nanotrap particles work in a mixed infection scenario with RVFV and HIV coinfection. nanotrap particles have been used for the capture of virus. there is no published data on the capture of bacteria with nanotrap particles. future studies will investigate the enrichment capability of the nanotrap particles with bacteria causing respiratory disease. nanotrap particles will be coupled to point-of-care diagnostic devices (RIDTs) nanotrap particles are environmentally-responsive hydrogel particles that are based on crosslinked poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) chains. QA/QC tests are conducted on each newly synthesized lot/batch of nanotrap. the nanotrap storage solution was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in 400 L distilled ultrapure water at a final concentration of 5 mg/mL. the cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% glutamax (supplemented DMEM) cell culture medium was collected from the cells when 80% cytopathic effect was observed. cell free-viral supernatants were then filtered using a 0.22 M filter and viral titers determined by plaque assays. genome copies of the viruses were determined by extracting viral RNA from cell free viral supernatants. Plaque assays MDCK cells were plated in 6 well plates at 1.0E+06 cells/ml. the pellet was resuspended in 100 L of distilled water. serial dilutions were performed on a starting volume of 100 L. 375 L TRIzol LS\u00ae Reagent (Life Technologies) was added to the +NT and \u2013NT samples, vortexed for 10 seconds. a volume of 100 L chloroform was then added to the sample and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes. after a five minute incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 4\u00b0C and at a speed of 12,000 g for 15 minutes. the samples were heated at 50\u00b0C for 3 minutes hold, 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes hold, and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds and 49\u201352\u00b0C for 30 seconds. qRT-PCR analysis was performed using the StepOne Plus Real Time PCR System (Applied biosystems) nanotrap pellets containing captured Influenza HA proteins were resuspended in 25 L of blue lysis buffer. the nanotrap samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm. the supernatant was saved into a new microcentrifuge tube. diluted 1:2,000 in 3% milk for 1 hour and then washed 4 times with PBS-T for 5 minutes. differences were deemed statistically significant if the p-value was 0.05. nanotrap particles are environmentally-responsive hydrogel particles. the pellet was resuspended in 400 L distilled ultrapure water at a final concentration of 5 mg/mL. the cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% glutamax. the genome copies of the viruses were determined by extracting viral RNA from cell free viral supernatants and performing qRT-PCR with viral specific primers. samples were sonicated using the MISONIX Ultrasonic Liquid Processor (XL-2000 Series model) for 3 10-second pulses at 600 W. for the \u2013NT samples, serial dilutions were performed on a starting volume of 100 L. a volume of 400 L of the serial dilution was added to each well in duplicate. the primary overlay consisted of equal parts 0.9% agarose in distilled water. the samples were centrifuged at 4\u00b0C and at a speed of 12,000 g for 15 minutes. the colorless upper aqueous phase (200 L) was removed and saved for downstream analysis. qRT-PCR was performed using either the Superscript\u00ae III Platinum\u00ae SYBR\u00ae green One Step qRT-PCR Kit. the RNA UltraSense kit was used according to a standardized protocol using 20 L of master mix containing enzyme mix, 5X reaction mix, ROX reference dye, 10 M TaqMan fluorogenic probe, 40 M forward primer and 40 uM reverse primer added to 5 L of extracted RNA. samples were heated at 50\u00b0C for 30 minutes, 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes, and 95\u00b0C and 55\u00b0C for 45 cycles. nanotrap pellets containing captured Influenza HA proteins were resuspended in 25 L of blue lysis buffer. no control samples were resuspended in 10 L of lysis buffer. samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm to ensure all nanotrap particles were pelleted. a bio-Rad Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS system (Bio-Rad) statistical significance was determined using either student's unpaired t test to compare the mean or fold enrichment values of the two sample sets. differences were deemed statistically significant if the p-value was 0.05. Influenza A /Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) (FR-8) and human Coronavirus, Strain 229E (ATCC\u00ae VR-740TM) were also obtained through the Influenza Reagent Resource.
