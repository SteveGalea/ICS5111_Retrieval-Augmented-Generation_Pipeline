{"summary": "the J subgroup Avian Leukosis Virus (ALV-J) is a subgroup of retrovirus that was first reported and isolated from broiler chickens in the early 1990s (1). however, numerous cases of ALV-J infection and tumors in commercial layer chickens and broiler breeders have emerged in recent years (2\u20135). this resulted in serious economic losses to breeding farms, including growth retardation, high mortality, tumor production and cost for eradication. the recombinant L. plantarum harboring pMG36e-pgsA-gp85 was constructed using genetic engineering technology. the live recombinant L. plantarum was then used to vaccinate chickens. viremia was detected to assess the effect of the recombinant. pMD18T-env recombinant vector, gp85-specific mouse monoclonal anti-body, gp85-specific mouse monoclonal anti-body (MAb JE9) and ALV-J antibody test kit were donated by Prof. Zhizhong Cui. the pgsA gene and purified gp85 protein were stored in our laboratory. the primers were designed according to the Bacillus subtilis pgsA genes. the forward and reverse primer of the pgsA gene was 5\u2032-CGAGCTCGCGAACTGAGCTTTCATGAAAAG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTAGTCTAGACTATGAACGTCA-3\u2032. the gp85 gene was amplified using the forward primer (5\u2032-TCATCTAGGGAGTTCATCTGTTG-3\u2032) and the reverse primer (5\u2032-TC vette was subjected to one electric pulse (2.0 kV/cm, 200, 25 F) using a Gene Pulser. recombinant strains were selected on MRS medium plates with 5 g/ml of erythromycin (Ery; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), which was incubated anaerobically at 37\u00b0C for 36 h. western blotting was developed using the gp85-specific mouse monoclonal antibody each group contained 40 chickens kept in separated isolators receiving filtered positive-pressure air. the recombinant L. plantarum group was immunized intragastrically with recombinant strains of L. plantarum (harboring plasmid pMG36e-pgsA-gp85) the control and negative control group received equal doses of sterile PBS and natural L. plantarum. a 30 L volume of 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the supernatants before they were vortexed and spun at 27,000 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. a further 20 L of PMSF, 100 L of fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 20 L of 1% sodium azide (Sigma) were added to the supernatants before they were dispensed into aliquots and then stored the OD of the IgA was measured at 450 nm and determined by the Critical value (CUT OFF) method following the formula below: CUT OFF = (mean of OD450nm of sample) + 0.15. indirect ELISA assay was used to assess the titers of anti-gp85 protein antibody. all of the chickens were challenged intraperitoneally with 3 103 TCID50 of the ALV-J NX0101 strain at Day 50. plasma samples from the chickens were aseptically collected and then inoculated into the CEF cells in 24-wells plates. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions L. plantarum HQ542228 was grown anaerobically at 37\u00b0C without agitation in MRS broth medium (250 g, Hopebiol, Qingdao, China) each chicken was confirmed negative for the ALV-J antibody and virus by ALV-J-antibody ELISA initiation of the experiment. PCR amplification was performed as follows: 95\u00b0C for 5 min, 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 72 s, and 72\u00b0C for 5 min of final extension. the gp85 gene was amplified using the forward primer (5\u2032-TCATCTAGAGGGAGTTCATCTGTTG-3\u2032) and the reverse primer (5\u2032-TCCAAGCTCTGTTGCTAC-3\u2032) western blotting was developed using the gp85-specific mouse monoclonal antibody JE9 as the primary antibody. horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma, 1:5,000) was used as the secondary antibody. 3 104 cells were analyzed with a FACS Calibur platform. the control group and negative control group received equal doses of sterile PBS and natural L. plantarum. the immune protocol was administered on five consecutive days (days 1\u20135). a booster immunization was given between days 15 to 19. ELISA The anti-ALV-J antibody in serum, bile and duodenal lavages were analyzed. the titers of IgG were tested using an ALV-IgG ELISA kit. the optical density (OD) of the IgG was measured at 450 nm. a 96-well ELISA plate was coated overnight with gp85 protein of appropriate concentration (4 g/mL) and kept at 4\u00b0C. after blocking the plates, the samples of serum, bile and duodenal lavages were used as the primary antibody. after blocking the plates, the samples of serum, bile and duodenal lavages were used as the primary antibody and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. licate, and plasma samples with S/P ratios higher than 0.2 were considered virus-positive. one-way ANOVA was used to identify the significant values. all values were expressed as mean standard error of the mean. the cell surface-displayed pgsA-gp85 was performed using mouse JE9 antibody as primary antibody and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG as the secondary antibody. the cells harboring the plasmid pMG36e-gp85 showed a significantly greater intensity of fluorescence signals than the control cells. recombinant pMG36e-pgsA-gp85 L. plantarum significantly triggered specific IgG and IgA antibodies against ALV-J. levels of IgG and sIgA increased significantly after oral inoculation. a low level of IgG titers was detected after the primary immunization. peak IgG titers were reached after the third booster immunization on Day 35 (5 weeks, P 0.05) no significant specific antibodies were observed in the negative L. plantarum group until Day 49 the virus was challenged. results of the sIgA levels in bile showed that, compared to the control groups (groups 1 and 3), the immunized group started to increase rapidly after 7 days of the first immunization (P 0.01). the profile showed a steady increase before Day 21 (3 weeks) and achieved the highest level on the 35th day after the 3rd booster immunization (5 weeks, P 0.01). group ALV-J positive ratio (%) 1st week 2nd week 3rd week 4th week Natural L. plantarum+ALV-J 16.7% (2/12)a 25.0% (3/12)ac 41.7% (5/12)a Recombinant L. plantarum+ALV-J 8.3% (1/12)a 8.3% (1/12)ab 25.0% (3/12)ab 16.7% (2/12)ab PBS+ALV-J 33.3% (4/12)a 50. recombinant pgsA-gp85 protein (unpurified) expressed in L. plantarum (pMG36e) by SDS-PAGE (A) and Western blot (B) identification of location of the recombinant fusion protein Flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell surface display of L. plantarum. the recombinant pMG36e-pgsA-gp85 L. plantarum significantly triggered specific IgG and IgA antibodies against ALV-J. the control group indicates the levels of IgA antibody in the chickens vaccinated with the recombinant pMG36e-pgsA-gp85 L. plantarum. levels of sIgA antibody in bile samples increased significantly after oral inoculation. levels of systemic IgG in serum increased significantly after oral inoculation. serum samples were taken at random intervals each weekly after day 1 (pre-immune). results of the sIgA levels in bile showed that, compared to the control groups (groups 1 and 3), the immunized group started to increase rapidly after 7 days of the first immunization (P 0.01) the profile showed a steady increase before Day 21 (3 weeks) and reached the highest level on the 35th day (5 weeks, P 0.01). Viremia Viremia were determined weekly after challenge until the 77th day. positive viremia ratios in the natural L. plantarum+ALV-J and PBS+ALV-J groups were obviously higher than those in the recombinant L. plantarum+ALV-J group. lactic acid bacteria have been proposed as a live vehicle for the delivery of exogenous antigen proteins for mucosal immunization or for other therapeutic molecules. the biological functions of lactic acid bacteria are effectively combined with the immunogenicity of exogenous antigen genes. lactic acid bacteria can be used as a probiotic for animal gastrointestinal tracts. body weight in the recombinant L. plantarum group was significantly higher than that in the control group at 49, 63, 70, 77, 84 d. recombinant pMG36e-pgsA-gp85 L. plantarum effectively enhanced the sIgA. recombinant L. plantarum is the main antibody produced by the humoral immune response. it plays an important role against infection, including neutralizing toxins. some researchers have succeeded in detecting the specificity of IgG by using recombinant lactic acid bacteria. authors reviewed results and approved final version of the manuscript. conflict of interest The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
