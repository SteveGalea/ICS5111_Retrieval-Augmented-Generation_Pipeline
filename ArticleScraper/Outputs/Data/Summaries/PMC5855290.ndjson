{"summary": "piglets from a farrow-to-finish multiplier farm with a high health status were submitted for postmortem examination. the clinical history was of congenital tremor. the herd was negative for the infectious agents porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), influenza, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus. the average litter size was slightly smaller in congenital tremor-affected litters. mortality rate in congenital tremor-affected litters had reached an average of 24.6% (15/61) at 3 wk of age, there were no stillborns in the litters. fresh specimens of lungs, ileum, and spiral colon from piglets with congenital tremor were submitted for aerobic culture. pools of tissues were frozen at \u201320\u00b0C and later tested by reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) FB stain in the white matter of the spinal cord of piglets with congenital tremor appeared normal. no changes were noted in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and brainstem of affected piglets. the clinical signs, postmortem and histopathology findings in the 2 pigs are consistent with CT type AII caused by APPV infection. pestiviruses are enveloped, highly variable RNA viruses belonging to the family Flaviviridae (19) a distant genetic relationship was also noted between APPV and Bungowannah virus and the bat pestivirus. reports of these strains in commercial pig populations indicate it is widely distributed (12\u201318,26) a strong association between CT type AII and APPV was observed. the intensity of signs of congenital tremor can be variable (12,14,17), and mild tremor could be unnoticed or mistaken for shivering from cold. some authors report the persistence of mild tremor of ear tips and flank for up to 14 wk, after which it disappears completely. tremors are increased or induced by stress. thymus of piglets with congenital tremor type AII (13) has also been identified by PCR from peripheral nerves, heart, lungs, liver, kidney, bladder, pancreas, small intestine, colon, salivary glands, skeletal muscle, umbilical blood, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, nasal swabs, rectal swabs, and even semen (12\u201314,16,18,32) asymptomatic viremic piglets are reported (17) and persistent shedding of the virus after the resolution of clinical disease is observed. the high prevalence of APPV in tonsils or serum from apparently healthy pigs supports the presence of persistently infected animals. in such cases, congenital tremor will usually reappear after the introduction of new gilts, allowing clinically healthy but chronically or persistently infected pigs to infect nave subjects. the diagnosis of APPV is particularly important because CSFV is a clinical differential diagnosis for congenital tremor in piglets. there is no evidence of cross-reactivity with diagnostic tests routinely used for the diagnosis of classical swine fever (32)."}
