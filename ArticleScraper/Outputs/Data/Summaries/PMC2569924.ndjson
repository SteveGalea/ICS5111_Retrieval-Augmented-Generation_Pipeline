{"summary": "the apathogenic Tula hantavirus induces apoptosis in vero E6 epithelial cells. to assess molecular mechanisms behind the induced apoptosis we studied the effects of hantavirus infection on cellular signaling pathways which promote cell survival. hantaviruses are negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with a tripartite genome of large (L), medium (M) and small (S) segments encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. the multi-organ hantaviral disease is characterized by local induction of cytokines. cell death occurs via the cleavage of procaspase-8 to its active form. TULV infection induces apoptosis in vero E6 cells and that externally added TNF- enhances the cell death process. results and discussion TULV inhibits ERK1/2 activity in vero E6 cells. the cells were collected at 11 days post infection (p.i.) when cell death with the highest MOIs was evident. increased MOI resulted in higher degree of apoptosis. ERK1/2 inhibition correlated directly with increasing MOI and apoptosis. TULV inhibits ERK1/2 cell survival pathway in vero E6 cells. error bars for virus-titer measurements represent standard deviation. error bars for virus-titer measurements represent standard deviation. virus replication was relatively high already at 4 days p.i. (108 FFU/ml) replication efficiency correlated with the magnitude of ERK1/2 inactivation. pathogenic hantaviruses have same capability as TULV to inhibit ERK1/2 activity. all hantaviruses had a minor or indiscernible negative effect on ERK1/2 activity at 14 days p.i. ERK1/2 activity was almost totally abolished in TULV-infected cells. ERK1/2 inhibition increased with simultaneous decrease in virus production. only in case of TULV was ERK1/2 inhibition increased with simultaneous decrease in virus production. hantaviruses do not have the same capability as TULV to inhibit ERK1/2 activity. hantaviruses and TNF- act synergistically to inhibit ERK1/2 activity. the additional effects of TNF- on ERK1/2 inhibition were from 2- to 20-fold. despite our efforts, these cells produce high amounts of virus. hantaviruses and TNF- synergistically inhibit ERK1/2 activity in vero E6 cells. TULV inhibits ERK1/2 activity in hantavirus-infected cells. ERK1/2 proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine-204 by immunoblotting. cells were infected with multiplicity of infection (MOI) between 1 and 0 of TULV or a cell death-inducing concentration of TNF-. increased MOI resulted in higher degree of apoptosis. activity compared to cells infected with 0.5 MOI of TULV. this suggests higher level of ERK1/2 inactivation was not only due to viral replication but also due to induced apoptosis. TULV inhibits ERK1/2 cell survival pathway in vero E6 cells. vero E6 cells were infected with non-treated or UV-inactivated TULV (MOI 0.1) for 4 and 10 days. we could confirm that TULV inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation as compared to UV-inactivated virus at both time points. HFRS-causing hantaviruses do not have the same capability as TULV to inhibit ERK1/2 activity. hantaviruses replicate slowly in cell cultures, which might reflect long incubation times of the virus seen also in HFRS patients. the amount of released virus correlated with the respective levels of ERK1/2 inhibition at 14 days p.i. for TULV, TOPV and SEOV. at 25 days p.i. the amount of released virus was generally lower than at 14 days p.i., possibly reflecting the deteriorated state of Vero E6 cell culture. cell lysates were immunoblotted for detection of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) or total ERK1/2 (A) bands were subjected to intensity analysis (ImageJ software; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij) and the amount of p-ERK1/2 related to mock sample at 14 and 25 days post infection. despite our efforts, even though these cells produce high amounts of virus, we could not detect any cleaved PARP by immunoblotting. this result implies that TULV-induced apoptosis is not directly associated with viral replication but is a consequence of a high MOI applied on cell culture. however, obtaining such high MOIs with pathogenic viruses was not feasible. ERK1/2 inhibition was induced by TNF- also in PUUV-infected cells. ERK1/2 pathway is activated in many types of cancer. it promotes cell survival, i.e. it induces anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2. ERK1/2 activity in infected vero E6 cells promotes cell survival even in the presence of sustained TNF- treatment. but in the infected cells ERK1/2 activity is reduced, which might at least render these cells sensitive to external TNF-mediated apoptosis. it would be of interest to understand the role of ERK1/2 activity in terms of viability of hantavirus-infected cells in more detail. hantaviral antigens have been detected in the renal tubular epithelial cells of HTNV- [33] and PUUV-infected patients. viral replication in renal tubular epithelial cells could be the direct cause of renal epithelium dysfunction through virus-induced inhibition of signaling pathways necessary for cell viability. vero E6 cell monolayers were grown to confluence, virus adsorbed for one hour at 37\u00b0C. UV-inactivation was achieved using a stock of virus on ice in a lid-less 3 cm diameter culture dish. cells were scraped off into medium, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM Na3VO4, 20 mM NaF and UV-inactivation was achieved using a stock of virus on ice. the medium of infected and mock-infected cultures was changed once a week. diluted supernatants were grown in vero E6 cells on a 10-well microscopic slide. lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 20 mM NaF and EDTA-free cocktail of protease inhibitors. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
