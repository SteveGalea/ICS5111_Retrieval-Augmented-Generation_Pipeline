{"summary": "in the past decade, a number of paramyxoviruses in the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, as well as their natural hosts, have been discovered. in the past decade, there are five genera within the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, namely Respirovirus, Rubulavirus, Morbillivirus, Henipavirus, and Ferlavirus. 31 green anaconda juveniles from HKSAR died over a 12-month period. a FDLV-like virus could be the cause of the cluster of infections. we propose to be named anaconda paramyxovirus (AnaPV) all 31 green anaconda juveniles died during a 12-month period. samples were collected from lungs, brain, heart, spleen, liver, kidney, gallbladder, thyroid, intestine, pancreas, skin, stomach, subcutaneous necrotic tissue, esophagus, trachea, urine, feces, and pericardial fluid. RNA was eluted with 50 l of RNase-free water. RT-PCR of L gene of reptilian paramyxovirus was performed using a QIAamp viral RNA minikit. the sequences of the PCR products were compared with known sequences of the L genes of paramyxoviruses in the GenBank database. total RNA was extracted from samples with RNeasy mini spin columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and was reverse transcribed and amplified. the 5\u2032 ends of the viral genomes were confirmed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using the 5\u2032/3\u2032 RACE kit (Roche, Germany) Sequences were assembled and manually edited to produce final sequences of the viral genomes. cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 50\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min, with a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min, with a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. the products were then purified and cloned using the TOPO TA cloning kit. twenty-seven cell lines derived from different tissues or organs and host species were prepared in 24-well plates and inoculated with AnaPV at a multiplicity of infection of 1 for 1 h. nonattached virus was removed by washing the cells twice in serum-free MEM. total nucleic acids were extracted on days 1, 3, and 5 from culture supernatants from the 27 cell lines infected by AnaPV. conda juveniles arrived at the park from Japan in June 2011. samples were collected from lungs, brain, heart, spleen, liver, kidney, gallbladder, thyroid, intestine, pancreas, skin, stomach, subcutaneous necrotic tissue, esophagus, trachea, urine, feces, and pericardial fluid. samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histological processing. RNA was eluted with 50 l of RNase-free water. RT-PCR of L gene of reptilian paramyxovirus was performed by amplifying a 178-bp fragment of FDLV. both strands of the PCR products were sequenced twice with an ABI Prism 3700 DNA analyzer. the sequences were compared with known sequences of the L genes of paramyxoviruses in the GenBank database. total RNA was extracted from samples with RNeasy mini spin columns. cDNA was amplified with degenerate primers designed by multiple alignments of the genomes of FDLV and closely related paramyxoviruses. additional primers were designed from the results of the first and subsequent rounds of sequencing. the 5\u2032 ends of the viral genomes were confirmed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using the 5\u2032/3\u2032 RACE kit (Roche, Germany) the mixtures were amplified with 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 50\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min, with a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. the products were then purified and cloned using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) twenty-seven cell lines derived from different tissues or organs and host species were prepared in 24-well plates and inoculated with AnaPV at a multiplicity of infection of 1 for 1 h. nonattached virus was removed by washing the cells twice in serum-free MEM. green anaconda juveniles died of dermatitis, pan-nephritis, pneumonia, hepatitis, pancreatitis, and gastritis. dermatitis and subcutaneous cellulitis, severe pan-nephritis, or severe systemic necrotizing inflammation in multiple organs. the most severe lesions occurred in the kidneys of all green anaconda juveniles. there was acute/subacute, severe, multifocal/diffuse, necrotizing, heterophilic inflammation. similar lesions occurred in other organs but were often less severe and extensive than the renal lesions. 001 19/10/2011 1110RN041/stomach mucus 19/10/2011 1110RN041/lung/liver/kidney/spleen + 1.34 106 002 19/10/2011 1110RN043/liver 19/10/2011 1110RN043/kidney + 4.48 104 19/10/2011 1110RN043/spleen 003 31/10/2011 1110RN047/kidney 31/10/2011 1110RN047/gal art 27/12/2011 1112RN058/lung + 1.26 105 27/12/2011 1112RN058/liver + 1.29 106 27/12/2011 1112RN058/spleen 27/12/2011 1112RN058/spleen 27/12/2011 1112RN058/pancreas + 3.03 105 27/12/2011 1112RN058/spleen 27/12/2011 1112RN058/pancreas + 3.03 105 27/12 1112RN053/intestine + 3.37 107 15/12/2011 1112RN053/liver + 8.23 105 15/12/2011 1112RN053/lung + 1.24 107 15/12/2011 1112RN053/skin 15/12/2011 1112RN053/stomach 15/12/2011 1112RN053/stomach 15/12/2011 1112RN053/trachea 573 5/5/2012 1205RN015/colon + 4.70 106 5/5/2012 median of 5.11 106 copies of AnaPV RNA per mg of tissue was observed in the necropsy specimens positive for AnaPV. median of 5.11 106 copies of AnaPV RNA per mg of tissue (range, 2.33 104 to 1.05 108 copies per mg) was observed in the necropsy specimens positive for AnaPV. the genome of AnaPV conforms to the rule of six, as in other paramyxovirus genomes. it contains a 55-nucleotide complementary 3\u2032 leader and a 36-nucleotide 5\u2032 trailer sequence. the sequences were identical except at three positions. single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the five AnaPV genomes are shown. as in FDLV, a unique gene, U, is present between the N and P/V/I genes in the genome of AnaPV. this is the gene in the AnaPV genome that possesses the lowest amino acid identity to that of FDLV. a cellular trypsin-like protease cleaves the F protein into F1 and F2 before cell fusion occurs. two heptad repeat sequences were identified in the F protein of AnaPV. a small cDNA fragment including the UC-rich region was amplified, cloned, and sequenced using mRNA extracted from AnaPV-infected BHK21 cells. phylogenetic trees constructed using the predicted amino acid sequences of the N, U, P, V, M, F, HN, and L genes of AnaPV and other members of Paramyxoviridae are shown in Fig. 2. in all eight trees, AnaPV was clustered with FDLV and other reptilian paramyxoviruses, with high bootstrap supports, forming a distinct group in Paramyxoviridae (Fig. 2).

RT-PCR for AnaPV using the culture supernatants and cell lysates showed positive results. real-time quantitative RT-PCR showed significant replication of AnaPV in 25 of the 27 cell lines. minimal replication was observed in the HEK and C6/36 cell lines. cluster of fatal infections was associated with a >90% mortality rate among the 33 anaconda juveniles that were progeny of the female parent that the facility purchased from Japan. anaconda juveniles infected by AnaPV showed the most serious pathologies in the anaconda juveniles. the organs that were most severely affected by FDLV were the kidneys, whereas the organs that were most severely affected were the lungs (18, 31, 32) RT-PCR results for the surveillance samples collected from the other snakes were negative. however, no clinical samples from the anaconda mother were obtained during the perinatal period. the genomic organization of AnaPV is identical to that of FDLV. the peptide of AnaPV does not possess a potential N-glycosylation site. the putative proteins encoded by the U, P, V, and I genes of AnaPV possess only 75.6% to 87.2% amino acid identities with respect to those of FDLV."}
