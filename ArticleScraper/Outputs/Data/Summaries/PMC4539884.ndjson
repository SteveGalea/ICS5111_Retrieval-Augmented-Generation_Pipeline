{"summary": "porcine small intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) were used as the infection model in vitro to identify possible molecular mechanisms of PEDV-inhibition IFN- production. PEDV failed to induce IFN- expression, but also inhibited dsRNA-mediated IFN- production in IECs. PEDV infection of target cell line inhibited dsRNA-mediated IFN- production by blocking the activation of IPS-1 in RIG-I-mediated pathway."}
