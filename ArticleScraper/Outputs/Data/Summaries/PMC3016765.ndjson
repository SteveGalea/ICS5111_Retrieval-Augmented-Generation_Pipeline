{"summary": "the mechanism of transmission of the agent or agents causing SARS is not yet fully understood but is probably mainly by droplet secretions, fomites, or person-to-person contact, as much of the transmission in Hong Kong has been limited to healthcare workers and family members. the virus has been reported to be stable in feces and urine at room temperature for at least 1\u20132 days. aerosolization of fecal waste contaminated with the SARS agent has also been proposed to have contributed to transmission. the virus has been reported to be stable in feces and urine for at least 1\u20132 days, and up to 4 days in stool from patients experiencing diarrhea (5). the emergence of SARS is unique in its propensity to infect healthcare workers. in china approximately 20% of cases are in healthcare workers, and early in the outbreak the rate was closer to 90% (14,15) simple measures such as hand washing after touching a patient may have reduced transmission. the nonspecific disease signs and symptoms, long mean incubation period (6.4 days), long time between onset of symptoms and hospital admission (from 3 to 5 days) may also contribute to the spread of SARS. as with other diseases, misdiagnosis can have fatal consequences. lack of information led to misconceptions over community preventative strategies, government and institutional procedures, and the magnitude of the outbreak. lack of information led to the development of public myths, with people in Guangdong believing boiling white vinegar would protect them from infection and leading to carbon monoxide poisoning from charcoal burning. strict quarantine procedures should be implemented if a patient with a fever is suspected of having SARS. a negative test does not always exclude a disease, and discharging patients later diagnosed and readmitted could have serious consequences. a reduction in exposure to animal viral reservoirs should reduce the occurrence of such events. timely communication and exchange of complete, accurate information are important during any epidemic. a reduction in exposure to animal viral reservoirs should reduce the occurrence of such events. the current outbreak has had a significant impact on the local healthcare system. a high proportion of patients require intensive care, coupled with prolonged hospitalization, overloading the system. establishing an outbreak response unit within the healthcare sector should be a priority with appropriate resources."}
