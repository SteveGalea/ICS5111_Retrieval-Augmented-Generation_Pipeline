{"summary": "no systematic study has been done to reveal the host protein composition for virions of VSV or any other member of the order Mononegavirales. no systematic study has been done to reveal the host protein composition for virions of VSV or any other member of the order. mononegavirales contains four families (Rhabdoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Filoviridae and Bornaviridae) they include many lethal human pathogens (e.g. rabies, Ebola, and Hendra viruses); highly prevalent human pathogens (e.g. rabies, Ebola, and Hendra viruses); potential ethological agents of some neurobehavioral abnormalities and psychiatric disorders in humans ( a proteomics approach utilizing mass spectrometry (MS) has been used to identify cellular proteins in a number of enveloped viruses including poxviruses [11-13], herpesviruses [14-20], orthomyxoviruses [21], coronaviruses [22], and retroviruses [23-25]. this method has been used to identify cellular proteins within purified VSV virions, thereby creating a \"snapshot\" of one stage of virus the use of different cell lines allowed us to compare viral host protein content across species and cell types. in addition, the A549 and 4T1 cell lines were included to allow identification of cellular proteins potentially lacking sufficient homology to human or mouse proteins to be recognized from a hamster source. VSV HR1 is a well characterized mRNA cap methylation defective VSV (Indiana serotype) host-range (hr) mutant. it has a delay in replication but achieves wild type titers in BHK21 [26-29] VSV HR1 was chosen for BHK21 infection as the milder cytopathic effect in BHK21 cells compared to VSV-wt. virion appears to have been broken in half. this is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that VSV virions can easily undergo morphological changes when processed by EM. some of the membranous structures present may represent the viral membranes dissociated from the nucleocapsids. s containing viral genomic RNA is supported by lack of detection of any histone or ribosomal proteins in the A549 and 4T1 samples by MS. together, the Northern blot (Fig. 2C) and Coomassie staining (Fig. 2D) data suggest the observed visual differences between samples are at least in part due to differences in particle stability/infectivity rather than simply sample purity.

RNA was extracted from uninfected (mock) or infected BHK21 cells or from purified virion samples containing 25 g of protein. VSV HR1 was chosen for BHK21 infection as the milder cytopathic effect in BHK21 cells compared to VSV-wt aid exclusion of cellular debris. however, replication of VSV-wt was more inhibited in these two cell lines than in BHK21 due to its host-range growth phenotype. virions were purified using a discontinuous sucrose gradient purification protocol. virion preparations from 4T1 and 4T1 showed fewer intact virus particles. some of the membranous structures present may represent the viral membranes dissociated from the nucleocapsids. but the possibility of them being cellular vesicles cannot be ruled out. the Northern blot and Coomassie staining data suggest the observed visual differences between samples are at least in part due to differences in particle stability/infectivity rather than simply sample purity.

VSV infection did not appear to induce Hsp72 expression at the time point analyzed. immunoblotting also confirmed the presence of cyclophilin A (Fig. 3D) in virions derived from 4T1 cells. five proteins [tubulin alpha, annexin A2, EF1a, ubiquitin and integrin 1] were identified in all three samples. tubulin beta, cytoplasmic actin and translation elongation factor 2 were identified only in the 4T1 and A549 derived preparations. some of the cellular proteins normally present within viral particles were \"leaked out\" during virus purification from A549 and 4T1 cells. differences in virion properties may have also impacted some of the other assays used in this study. in some cases, host cell protein expression may affect incorporation of cellular proteins into virions. we were unable to detect at least three proteins previously shown to be associated with VSV virions. failure of our analysis to detect some of these proteins does not challenge their potential role in VSV replication. annexin 2 and integrin 1 confirmed their presence in our virion preparations by immunoblotting. annexins bind phospholipids in a calcium dependent manner. actin has previously been shown to be incorporated into Sendai [48], measles [49] and rabies [50] virions. a proteomic approach is being conducted in our laboratory to identify cellular proteins in virions of other members of the order Mononegavirales. this is the first systematic study of the host protein composition for virions of VSV (or any other member of the order Mononegavirales) BHK21 cells were infected with VSV HR1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.005. A549 and 4T1 cells were infected with VSV wild type (VSV-wt, Indiana serotype) at an MOI of 0.1 and 0.5. this mutation eliminates viral mRNA cap methylation at both the guanine-N7 and 2'-O-adenosine positions. the viral pellet was resuspended in ET buffer (1 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA) with 10% DMSO and centrifuged in a 7-60% discontinuous sucrose gradient composed of steps of 2 ml of 60% (w/w) sucrose, 3 ml of 45% sucrose, 4.5 ml of 25% sucrose. n microscopy Virions were absorbed to carbon-formvar coated grids. grids were blotted dry and stained with 2% uranyl acetate in water for 30 seconds. excess stain was removed and the grids allowed to air dry. northern blot analysis Total RNA was extracted from purified virion samples containing 25 g of protein. ethanol precipitated and resuspended in 30 l of RNase-free water. half of this material was separated on a 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. uninfected cells were incubated at 43\u00b0C for 4 h and immediately harvested. protein concentrations of cellular lysates and purified virions were determined by Bradford assay. 50 g of purified virions and 10 g of cellular lysates were separated on gradient 8-16% or 15% SDS-PAGE gels. infectivity was calculated by standard plaque assay on BHK21 cells. cells were infected with wt or mutant VSV and incubated at 34\u00b0C. VSV HR1 is a well characterized mRNA cap methylation defective mutant. the viral pellet was resuspended in ET buffer (1 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA) with 10% DMSO and centrifuged in a 7-60% discontinuous sucrose gradient. the virus containing band was removed from the gradient and diluted with ET buffer. a portion of the treated virions from 4T1 cells were centrifuged through a 20% sucrose cushion at 173,000 g and 4\u00b0C for 2.5 h using a Beckman SW40 Ti rotor. the pelleted virus was resuspended in ET buffer. a parent ion mass tolerance of 2.0 Da, fragment ion mass tolerance of 1.0 Da, and a 16 Da differential modification for methionine oxidation were used for search parameters. protein identifications were accepted when the peptide probability was greater than 95.0% [54], the protein probability was greater than 99.0%. immunoblot analysis Cellular lysates were prepared by mock infecting 4T-1, A549 and BHK cells or by infecting them with VSV-wt at MOIs of 0.5, 0.1 and 0.05 respectively. cells were harvested at 18 h p.i. and lysed in RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% Sodium deoxycholate and 0. authors' contributions MM conducted all experiments except for the MS analysis. SIH provided virion MS analysis and sequence matching to mouse and human databases."}
