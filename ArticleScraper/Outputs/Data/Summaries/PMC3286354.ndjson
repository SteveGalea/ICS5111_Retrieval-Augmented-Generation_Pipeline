PBMCs were distributed at 2500 to 10 000 cells per well in 96-well u-bottom plates. levels of total IgM were measured using an IgM-specific ELISA. RNA was extracted from hetero-hybridoma cell lines in bulk culture using an RNA extraction kit (QIAGEN) all PCR products were purified using PCR purification kit (QIAGEN) and sequenced in forward and reverse directions using an instrument and BigDye sequencing kit. s within exons 2 and 3 were normalized with the SETDB1 gene. forward primer for SETDB1 was: 5\u2032-AATTTGCACGGACAGGCATT-3\u2032. reverse primer was 5\u2032-CAGAGGGTTCTTGCCGGT-3\u2032. transcripts were normalized to SETDB1. LMP1 was detected using the S12 antibody (1:10 dilution of hybridoma supernatant, kind gift of E. Kieff, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) electrofusion K6H6/B5 myeloma partner cells and EBV-transformed B cells were washed twice with an electrofusion medium (Cyto Pulse Sciences) before fusion. PBMCs were isolated by density-gradient centrifugation (Ficoll-Paque; Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology) and cryopreserved with a programmable cell-freezing machine. the IGHV-D-J rearrangements of these cases were amplified and sequenced as described. IGHV mutation (%) was compared with germline according to IMGT.27 HCDR3 length indicates number of amino acid residues in the HCDR3. the culture supernatants were analyzed for IgM production in 100% of the wells tested with an average IgM level of 6.7 g/mL.

ELISA plates were coated with 5 g/mL of goat anti\u2013human Ig (reactive with all isotypes; BioSource International) in 0.1M sodium bicarbonate buffer. after incubating overnight at 4\u00b0C, plates were blocked with PBS containing 15% goat serum, 4% whey protein, 0.5% Tween-20, cell sorting was performed on a BD FACSAria (BD Biosciences) RNA was also extracted from hetero-hybridoma cell lines in bulk culture using an RNA extraction kit (QIAGEN) the genes encoding IGHV and IGKV chains were amplified by RT and nested PCR using a previously reported method. EBNA2 mRNAs were detected by TaqMan using a forward primer spanning the Y2/YH exon junction (5\u2032-GCTTAGTAACCCAGCACT-3\u2032) and a reverse primer within YH (5\u2032-TGCTTAGAAGGTTGTTGGCATG) transcripts were normalized to SETDB1. all samples were run on Novex 4%-12% Bis-Tris gels. cells were fused with a single square-wave direct current voltage of 300 V for 0.04 ms. postfusion dielectrophoresis was performed with an alternating current voltage of 75 V at 0.8 MHz for 15 seconds. cells were harvested and distributed into 96-well flat-bottom plates at 4000 B cells per well. culturing the same number of PBMCs with ODN2006 produced minimal levels of IgM (mean = 0.1 g/mL, P.0001, Student t test) after EBV infection, 5000 PBMCs were incubated in. each data point represents the level of IgM in each well. total of 100 000 PBMCs were plated in total of 20 wells. to determine the optimal number of irradiated J774A.1 cells needed for B-CLL cell activation.

PBMCs from all patients produced detectable levels of IgM in more than or equal to 50% of the wells tested. a total of 66 PBMC samples (47 U-CLL and 19 M-CLL cases) were infected with EBV. 25 IGHV1-69 (67.6%), 4 IGHV2 (36.4%), and 12 IGHV3 (66.7%) samples were transformed into IgM-producing B cells in more than or equal to 50% of the wells tested. higher transformation frequencies were obtained from cases expressing IGHV3-11 (3 of 3, 3 U-CLL), IGHV3-30 (2 of 2, 1 U-CLL and 1 M-CLL), and IGHV2-05 (4 of 7, 1 U-CLL and 3 each PBMC sample produced at least 1 cell line with all matched IGHV sequences. 9 of 11 IGHV1-69 (81.8%), none of 2 IGHV2 and 4. of 8 IGHV3 (50.0%; IGHV3-11, 3-13, 3-23, and 3-74) samples had been transformed by EBV. 12 of 15 U-CLL cases (80.0%) produced B-cell lines with matching IGHV sequences, contrast to only 1 of 6 M-CLL cases. 3-1 EBV-B cells 1-69 0.0 GGTFSSYA IIPIFGTA ARDGTNLRGWIQLWPGAYFDY 1-33 0.0 QDISNY DAS QQYDNLPYT CLL526 B-CLL PBMCs 1-69 0.0 GGTFSSYA IIPIFGTA ARVGYYDFWSGYYPNYYYYGMDV 3-9 0.0 NIGSKN RDS QVWDSSTV CLL526-G10 E BV-B cells 1-69 0.0 GGTFSSYA IIPIFGTA AREASYGSGSYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY IGHV and IGKV/IGLV mutations (%) were compared with germline according to IMGT.27 ND indicates not determined. 10 cell lines that contained the leukemic Ig sequences were selected and expanded for 2 to 4 months. of the 10 cultures, 6 retained viable cells in the presence of irradiated J774A.1 feeder cells. uninfected PBMCs from patients CLL246 and CLL698 expressed undetectable or more than 100-fold lower levels of LMP1 or EBNA2. however, the low level of expression might be the result of the lower amount of protein available for extraction from this sample. mRNA levels of EBNA2 (A) and LMP1 (B) were subtracted by the Ct values of SETDB1 RNA. the 2 (viral RNA Ct SETDB1 Ct) values were then normalized so that EF3D (an LCL) was 100%. Ig DNA sequencing demonstrated that 6 cell lines (5 IGHV1-69 and 1 IGHV3-07) had IGHV sequences that matched those of the known B-CLL IgM sequences from the same patient samples. the remaining hetero-hybridoma cell line did not have the matching B-CLL IGHV sequence. stable hetero-hybridomas were generated from 60% of B-CLL EBV-transformed B-cell cultures. 8 B-CLL PBMCs 1-69 0.0 GGTFSSYA IIPIFGTA ARGDLPYYDFWSGYHYYGMDV 1-5 0.4 QSISSW KAS QQYNSYST CLL698-A11 Hybridoma 1-69 0.3 GGTFSSYA IIPIFGTA ASNAAPLRFLEWSYYTEMGGDY ND CLL821\u20131 Hybridoma 1-69 0.0 GGTFSSYA IIPIFGTA ASN the IGHV and IGKV/IGLV sequences were obtained from RNA extracted from 6 cultured B-CLL hetero-hybridoma cell lines. the mouse macrophage cell line, J774A.1, enhances the outgrowth of EBV-transformed B cells from CpG oligonucleotide-stimulated B-CLL cells by more than 30-fold. the leukemic origin of the cell lines was documented by IGHV-D- scavenger receptors of oxidized phosphatidylserine may be a mechanism of apoptotic cell clearance by J774A.1 cells. recognition by scavenger receptors of oxidized phosphatidylserine may be a mechanism of apoptotic cell clearance by J774A.1 cells. our B-CLL cells expressed both LMP1 mRNA and protein while cultured on macrophages. when the feeder cell support was eliminated, the B-CLL cells died. this suggests that extracellular signals produced by the feeder cells induced LMP1 expression and cell proliferation. this combined approach has been used to generate potentially therapeutic human mAbs. oligonucleotides, such as thioredoxin, and IL-2, also aid EBV infection of CLL cells. 80% (12 of 15) of U-CLL samples gave rise to transformed B-CLL cells. hetero-hybridomas were generated at an efficiency of 60% (6 hetero-hybridoma clones of 10 EBV-transformed B cell lines used) this was somewhat lower than more than the 80% efficiency we have previously achieved with normal human B cells using the same methods. the availability of DNA and RNA from B-CLL\u2013derived cell lines will enable the determination of specific genetic abnormalities that might represent initiation or progression factors in the disease. authors declare no competing financial interests. authors declare no competing financial interests."}
