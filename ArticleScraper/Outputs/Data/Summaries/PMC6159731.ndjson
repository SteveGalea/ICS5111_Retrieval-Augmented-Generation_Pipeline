{"summary": "meta-analysis studies have reported the association of AD with spirochetal (Odds ratio (OR) = 10.61) or Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) infection (OR = 5.66) [1] and association of herpes simplex (HSV-1) infection with AD, which is augmented by possession of the APOE4 allele (OR = 2.71) [2] and is associated with increased amyloid- (A) load in patients in vivo many viruses can enter the brain via olfactory neural pathways to the basal forebrain [14], a route also employed by C. pneumoniae [15] and the cerebral entry of pathogens may also be facilitated by disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in AD. the BBB is also damaged by systemic inflammation [23], or by systemically administered bacterial cell wall components. the control of the BBB, the routes of pathogen entry and immunosenescence are covered in greater detail in a later section. pathogens that have been detected in the AD brain include HSV-1, C. Pneumoniae, B. Burgdorferi, and many other spirochetes. lternaria, Botrytis, Candida, Cladosporium, and Malassezia species have been identified. a pilot next-generation sequencing study has also identified several bacterial species in both control and AD brains with an overall higher bacterial load in AD. the involvement of pathogens in AD has been strengthened by the observations that A is an antimicrobial peptide active against bacteria and fungi. many AD genes encode proteins that physically interact within a defined protein/protein interaction network. many AD genes are also expressed in microglial cells, the resident macrophage/immune cells of the brain. selection for pathogen resistance was proposed as one possible explanation. the proteins found in plaques and tangles also contain many related to the immune system, inflammation and autophagy, all of which play a general role in pathogen defense. previous studies have shown that the host genes involved in the life cycles of several pathogens implicated in AD relate to AD susceptibility genes. the host genes of the 17 pathogen interactomes were also compared with the combined up anddown-regulated genes from a transcriptome study of the AD hippocampus, postmortem [83] and to the proteins found in plaques or neurofibrillary tangles. the upregulated genes from this AD hippocampal study were also compared with upregulated genes from numerous infection microarray datasets. the hippocampal transcriptome genes and the proteins found in plaques and tangles in AD relate to the life cycles and effects of these diverse pathogens. many AD susceptibility genes are also concentrated in immune-related locations and in the BBB. this barrier is defective in AD and it is deleteriously affected by pathogens. the exosomal pathway is hijacked by several viruses, contributing to intercellular spread and immune evasion. genes related to pathogen diversity, protozoan and viral diversity and to the immune response to parasitic worms are from a series of papers concerning evolutionary selection pressure relevant to pathogen resistance. a literature survey was undertaken to analyze the gene or protein expression profiles of components more specifically related to pathogen defense in the AD brain, blood, or CSF. many of these are endowed with relative specificity against viruses, bacteria or fungi and where possible their known effects were matched to the pathogens used in this study. a human genome of 26846 coding genes and a gene set of N genes would expect N/26846 to exist in the comparator dataset. for example, when comparing 2879 misregulated AD hippocampal genes against any pathogen interactome one would expect 2879/26846 (10.7% ) to figure in the pathogen interactome. AD genes act as primary receptors for pathogens. these include the poliovirus receptor PVR, the HSV-1 receptor PVRL2 and complement receptor CR1. others bind bacterial LPS (APOC1, TREM2) or the Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (BCAM) exosomes are prevalent in plasma [111] and are the means by which intracellularly generated A is conveyed to the extracellular space [112] the bone marrow is the hematopoietic source of red and white blood cells and platelets [113], and bone marrow B cells rapidly respond to infection. other immune related areas enriched in AD genes include the appendix, spleen, tonsils, the lymph nodes, and the bronchus and neutrophils AD genes are also enriched in a separate BBB dataset from mouse cerebral arteries. barriers in intestinal and pulmonary tissues, also enriched in AD genes, might also be considered as potential sites of pathogen entry. retrovirus were significantly enriched in AD genes (FDR p 0.05) pathogen interactomes of these five pathogens were significantly enriched in AD genes. the highest ranked pathogens in terms of the significance of the interactome/AD gene overlaps related to fungi. all pathogen interactomes were significantly enriched in proteins found in plaques. the top agents relating to plaques were predominantly viral, while those relating to tangles were mostly viral. AD genes overlap with those implicated in pathogen, protozoan, or viral diversity or with the immune response to parasitic worms. AD genes overlap with those implicated in pathogen, protozoan, or viral diversity or with the immune response to parasitic worms. APOE4 variant is also associated with enhanced immune/inflammatory responses. TLRactivation in microglia induces cyclo-oxygenase-2 (PTGS2), microsomal prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES) and prostaglandin E2 an effect exaggerated in APOE4 (+/+) mice. effect was independent of the APOE4 variant [138] suggesting other AD genes are endowed with gain of function in relation to the immune/inflammatory system. AD monocytes stimulated with LPS also show a higher induced expression of the pro-inflammatory ICAM1 adhesion molecule than controls. oformans, and Hepatitis C were highly enriched in genes relating to this microarray dataset. the significance level of the interactome enrichment for most pathogens was several orders of magnitude below the Bonferroni cut off. bronchopneumonia, often caused by influenza, is a common final cause of death in dementia patients [147] upregulated genes in the AD hippocampus are enriched in genes upregulated by viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens or TLR ligands. upregulated genes from these datasets were compared with the upregulated genes (n = 1,690) from the AD hippocampal study. genes upregulated by viruses, interferon gamma or the viral mimic poly(I:C) in immunocompetent cells (MSigDB or GEO data) x axis = virus| celltype|N upregulated genes from MSigDb or Geo. ai, Sendai, HCoV, human coronavirus; IFNG, interferon gamma; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; MCMV, mouse cytomegalovirus; Dhori, Dhori, Dhori virus; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; KSHV, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus; HSV-1, herpes simplex; norwalk, norwalk genes upregulated in the AD hippocampal transcriptome and those upregulated by bacteria, fungi, nematode (B. malayi)/trematode (S. mansoni), protozoan, LPS and TLR ligands in immunocompetent cells. diversse pathogen sensors and defenders relating to bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi are upregulated in the AD brain, blood, or CSF. the misregulated genes include many related to inflammation, complement activation and the immune system that could relate to many pathogens. IDO1 upregulation is an important defense mechanism against pathogenic bacteria, many of which rely on host tryptophan. this response is also deleterious to other pathogens and parasites. 99 antimicrobial/pattern recognition, antiviral and related defensive genes were identified that were upregulated in the AD brain, blood, or CSF. no single pathogen or group of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or fungi) accounted for all of these changes. a number of misregulated sensors and defenders have been detected in the AD brain. these effects are matched to the effects of HSV-1, C. albicans, or B. burgdorferi as viral, bacterial and fungal representatives. these effects are matched to the effects of HSV-1, C. albicans, or B. burgdorferi as viral, bacterial and fungal representatives. defs or defs, unspecified alpha or beta defensins: CAMP, cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (LL-37); CHI3L1, chitinase 3 like 1 (aka YKL-40); Defensins, DEFA\u2019s, DEFB\u2019s: ELANE, elastase; HAMP, hepcidin; HTN1, histatin 1; IAPP, islet more selective antiviral agents (HSV-1) include oxysterols, 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterol and their synthesizing enzymes (CH25H and CYP17A1), DDX58/RIG-1, EIF2AK2 and sirtuins. the antimicrobial alerts in AD reflect a polymicrobial origin. this analysis suggests that the antimicrobial alerts in AD reflect a polymicrobial origin. it should be recognized that such specificity is not absolute for other viral, fungal, or bacterial species. these include influenza, bacterial pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections, intra-abdominal infections, gram-negative bacteremia, and pressure ulcers[161, 162]. these are caused by more common bacteria, fungi, and viruses, rather than by more exotic species such as the Bornavirus or T. cruzi. most BBB expressed genes interact with none or few pathogens. this suggests a subdivision of mainly BBB and mainly pathogen related. this might be confounded by missing data, as several of these genes are poorly characterized in terms of function. the effects of aging and its control by the basal forebrain and locus coeruleus Aging result in a loss of BBB integrity [165] and in immune function (immunosenecence) these two factors would be expected to favor blood-borne pathogen survival and cerebral pathogen entry. in normal human aging, loss of barrier integrity appears to begin in the hippocampus, a crucial area in AD and in learning and memory. use of the olfactory route to the basal forebrain and locus coeruleus by herpes simplex leads to viral migration into the amygdala and hippocampus via the olfactory nerve and the locus coeruleus. a deposition and tau pathology can be observed in the nasal epithelium in the majority of AD cases. pathogen related damage to the basal forebrain/locus coeruleus contributes to subsequent cerebrovascular and BBB defects. this could create a feed-forward effect whereby pathogen-induced A production produces further BBB damage. some pathogens can also circumvent the BBB by direct attack. ains have been detected in the hippocampal microvasculature of APOE mice. this is a factor that would limit effects on BBB function to the aged. any pathogen that so disrupts the BBB might be expected to influence invasion by others. autoantibodies may well be derived from antibodies raised to pathogens via antigen mimicry. cross-reactivity between antibodies to HSV-1 and synuclein (another antimicrobial peptide) has also been experimentally demonstrated. naso-cerebral pathogen entry in the elderly would be met by a vigorous pro-inflammatory response that likely plays a major role in the degenerative process. other environmental risk factors in AD disrupt the BBB and BBB integrity is maintained by beneficial factors. benefits include the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) or histamine H2 receptor blockers [227\u2013 229], and the early use of statins [230\u2013232]. the environmental risk factors associated with AD disrupt the BBB, and BBB integrity is maintained by the beneficial factors. aluminum aluminum increases BBB permeability in rats [286] A disrupts BBB integrity in mice. traumatic brain injury produces early disruption of the BBB in animal models and in human [287, 288] physical activity counters the negative influence of PICALM, BIN1 and CLU risk alleles on episodic memory functioning in a dementia-free population [301] Poor sleep Sleep disruption or sleep apnea are both associated with impaired BBB function[306, 307] Smoking Nicotine and smoking disrupt brain microvasculature and the BBB [308] Viruses capable of disrupting the BBB Viruses infecting humans known to cause disruption of the BBB or end chocolate (caffeine, theobromine, and resveratrol) is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. theobromine downregulates PDE4 in a glioma cell line. vitamin B12-B6-folate treatment improves BBB function in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia and mild cognitive impairment. Resveratrol, a component of grape and red fruit skins, maintains the integrity of the BBB after cerebral ischemia reperfusion in rats [333] Statins have been reported to ameliorate BBB dysfunction produced by high cholesterol [295], oxidized low-density lipoprotein [334], sepsis, intracerebral hemorrhage [335, 336], or cerebral malaria [337] in rats Borna virus infection decreases choline acetyltransferase activity in the cerebral cortex, horizontal diagonal band of Broca, hippocampus and amygdala [255] but the inflammation and microglial activation it produces can also reduce A immunoreactivity in the brain parenchyma of Tg2576 mutant A mice. Activated microglia were also seen in perivascular areas and the brain parenchyma [257] HIV-1 is immunosuppressant and has been associated with many opportunistic pathogens including tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus encephalitis and Cryptococcal brain invasion. the success of most pathogens depends on their ability to subvert the defensive armory of the host in some way. the relationship of AD to pathogens is supported by experimental observation and by the antimicrobial effects of A. this study relies on multiple and diverse bioinformatic analyses linking AD GWAS genes, plaques and tangles, and the hippocampal transcriptome to multiple pathogen interactions. interferon signaling (CD2AP, CELF1, MEF2C, MMP12, PTK2B, TREML2, ZNF224), TLR signaling (DISC1, PVR, HSV-1 receptor PVRL2, and complement receptor CR1. CD33 binds to the HIV-1 gp120 protein and to diverse forms of sialic acid which coats many pathogens. others bind bacterial LPS (APOC1, TREM2) or the Escherichi exosomes are hijacked by many viruses for intercellular spread. the bone marrow is the hematopoietic source of red and white blood cells and platelets. other immune related areas enriched in AD genes include the appendix, spleen, tonsils, lymph nodes, bronchus and neutrophils. hippocampus bulges into the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle [122] and this area is thus in close proximity to a major site of cerebral pathogen entry. other barriers in intestinal and pulmonary tissues, also enriched in AD genes, might also be considered as potential sites of pathogen entry. omes except those of the Borna virus, Ebola virus, and the HERV-W retrovirus significantly enriched in AD genes. pathogen interactomes of these five pathogens were significantly enriched in AD genes (p = 7.3E-6) the Borna virus and HIV-1 ranked highly in both cases. the top agents relating to plaques were predominantly viral. the top agents relating to plaques were mostly viral. tau inhibits the motility of the kinesin-1 motor protein that transports cellular organelles (or viruses) along the microtubules and tau phosphorylation counteracts this inhibition. it is not clear whether this benefits or deleteriously affects the pathogens. AD genes overlap with those implicated in pathogen, protozoan, or viral diversity or with the immune response to parasitic worms. the APOE4 variant is also associated with enhanced immune/inflammatory responses. APOE4 is also associated with enhanced in vivo immune responses in human subjects. monocyte-derived dendritic cells from AD patients also produce more interleukin-6 than those from healthy controls. other AD genes are also endowed with gain of function in relation to the immune/inflammatory system. all pathogen interactomes relating to influenza, C. neoformans, and Hepatitis C were highly enriched in genes relating to this microarray dataset. significance level of the enrichment for most pathogens was several orders of magnitude below the Bonferroni cut off (p = 1.74E-05) bronchopneumonia, often caused by influenza, is a common final cause of death in dementia patients [147] upregulated genes in the AD hippocampus are enriched in genes upregulated by viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens or TLR ligands. the hippocampal genes upregulated in AD were significantly enriched in upregulated genes in datasets from multiple viral species. the viruses ranged from the benign (e.g., the rhinovirus that causes the common cold) to the highly malignant (e.g., the ebolavirus, rabies virus or HIV-1) overlaps between genes upregulated in the AD hippocampal transcriptome and those upregulated by viruses, interferon gamma or the viral mimic poly(I:C) in immunocompetent cells (MSigDB or GEO data) the upregulated hippocampal genes in AD were also enriched in infection datasets for numerous bacteria as well as to fungi (C. albicans and C. neoformans) and in those related to bacterial endotoxin or sepsis and nematode/trematode or protozoan infection datasets. /TLR8 recognize RNA released from pathogens that enter the cell by endocytosis. genes upregulated in the AD hippocampal transcriptome and those upregulated by bacteria, fungi, nematode. diversse pathogen sensors and defenders relating to bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi are upregulated in the AD brain, blood, or CSF. the misregulated genes include many related to inflammation, complement activation and the immune system that could relate to many pathogens but also other neurotoxic promoters. IDO1 upregulation is an important defense mechanism against pathogenic bacteria. this response is deleterious to other pathogens and parasites, including T. gondii. 99 antimicrobial/pattern recognition, antiviral and related defensive genes were identified that were upregulated in the AD brain, blood, or CSF. no single pathogen or group of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or fungi) accounted for all these changes. the relative selectivity relating to three pathogens that have been detected in the AD brain is shown in the Venn diagram. the effects are matched to the effects of HSV-1, C. albicans, or B. burgdorferi as viral, bacterial and fungal representatives. these effects are matched to the effects of HSV-1, C. albicans, or B. burgdorferi as viral, bacterial and fungal representatives. rocidin, amyloid-; APCS, amyloid-; chromogranin-; CHGA, chromogranin-A; CHI3L1, chitinase 3 like 1 (aka YKL-40); defensins, deFB\u2019s, DEFB\u2019s: ELANE, elastase; HAMP, hepcidin; HTN1, histatin 1; IAPP, islet amyloid complement receptor 2 (integrins: ITGAM/ITGB2); CR4, complement receptor 4 (Integrins: ITGAX/ITGB2); MAC, membrane attack complex (complement components C5b-C9) type lectin CLEC7A, the mannose receptor MRC1, CD36, and antimicrobial peptides, chromogranin A, dermcidin, histatin, and synuclein. this analysis suggests that the antimicrobial alerts in AD reflect a polymicrobial origin. it should, however, be recognized that such specificity is not absolute for other viral, fungal, or bacterial species. those relevant to most AD cases will presumably relate to the most common infections in the elderly. these include influenza, bacterial pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections, intra-abdominal infections, gram-negative bacteremia, and pressure ulcers[161, 162]. these are caused by more common bacteria, fungi, and viruses. the list below indicates the 30 BBB genes, annotated with the number of pathogen interactomes with which they overlap. most BBB expressed genes interact with none or few pathogens. this suggests a subdivision of mainly BBB and mainly pathogen related. the effects of aging in relation to the BBB and the immune system and to routes of pathogen entry are discussed below. aging and its control by the basal forebrain and locus coeruleus Aging results in a loss of BBB integrity [165] and in immune function (immunosenecence) these two factors would be expected to favor blood-borne pathogen survival and cerebral pathogen entry. damage to the olfactory bulb and the olfactory tracts and system are also early characteristic features of AD[172, 173]. Anosmia/olfactory impairment are early and predictive signs of mild cognitive impairment and progression to AD. use of the olfactory route to the basal forebrain and locus coeruleus by herpes simplex and other pathogens. pathogen related damage to the basal forebrain/locus coeruleus contributes to subsequent cerebrovascular and BBB defects. pathogen-induced A production produces further BBB damage. some pathogens can also circumvent the BBB by direct attack. integrins have been detected in the hippocampal microvasculature of APOE mice. the prevalence of periodontitis increases with age. any pathogen that so disrupts the BBB might be expected to influence invasion by others. a number of studies have reported the presence of autoantibodies to A in the serum of the elderly [197] and in AD [198, 199]. they are also observed in mild cognitive impairment patients with higher plasma levels in those who progressed to AD [200]. it has been suggested that these autoantibodies may well be derived from antibodies raised to pathogens via antigen mimicry. bacterial and fungal pathogens have different ways of circumventing or damaging the BBB. naso-cerebral pathogen entry in the elderly would be met by a vigorous pro-inflammatory response. other environmental risk factors in AD disrupt the BBB and BBB integrity is maintained by beneficial factors. factors reported to be of benefit, or that reduce the incidence of AD include the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) or histamine H2 receptor blockers. factors reported to be of benefit include caffeine [219], chocolate (versus cognitive decline in the non-demented aged) [233] and the Mediterranean diet [234\u2013 236]. air pollution disrupts the BBB in children and young adults and causes neuroinflammation, an altered brain innate immune response, and accumulation of A and alpha-synuclein starting in childhood. traumatic brain injury produces early disruption of the BBB in animal models and in human [287, 288] physical activity counters negative influence of PICALM, BIN1 and CLU risk alleles on episodic memory functioning in a dementia-free population [301] Poor sleep Sleep disruption or sleep apnea are both associated with impaired BBB function[306, 307] Smoking Nicotine and smoking disrupt brain microvasculature and the BBB [308] Viruses capable of disrupting the BBB Viruses infecting humans known to cause disruption of the BBB or endo receptors and H2 receptor antagonism attenuates increased BBB permeability caused by hyperthermia in rats [314, 315] chocolate (caffeine, theobromine, and resveratrol) theobromine is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and downregulates PDE4 in a glioma cell line. adenosine receptor antagonists block the entry of inflammatory cells and soluble factors into the brain. amelioration of BBB disruption has already been proposed as a potential therapy in AD. several drugs including angiotensin receptor blockers, etodolac (NSAID), granisetron (5HT3 serotonin receptor antagonist), or beclomethasone (corticosteroid) may be considered suitable candidates. the Bornavirus is capable of promoting hippocampal degeneration in Man [11]. in rats, infection decreases choline acetyltransferase activity in the cerebral cortex, horizontal diagonal band of Broca, hippocampus and amygdala [255] but the inflammation and microglial activation it produces can also reduce A immunoreactivity in the brain parenchyma of Tg2576 mutant A mice. HIV-1 is immunosuppressant and has been associated with many opportunistic pathogens including tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus encephalitis and Cryptococcal brain invasion[270, 271]. diverse pathogens have been detected in the AD brain. all of the bioinformatics data presented above implicate multiple species of pathogens across viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan classes. a correction for false discovery followed by the Bonferroni correction has been conservatively applied. the AD genes are localized in the bone marrow and other immunocompetent tissues. they are also localized in the lateral ventricle and the hippocampus. they are also localized in the lateral ventricle and the hippocampus. this is a prime site of pathogen invasion via the choroid plexus. the relationship between pathogens and AD has a long history. a polymicrobial involvement seems likely given the multiple species detected in the AD brain. this places pathogens upstream of A and logically as causal. eradication in AD patients with peptic ulcer was also associated with a decreased risk of AD progression in a study in a Taiwanese study [281]. a study has shown that antibiotic treatment (doxycycline and rifampin) reduced the rate of cognitive decline in mild to moderate AD in mild to moderate AD [282] docx, docx and docx."}
