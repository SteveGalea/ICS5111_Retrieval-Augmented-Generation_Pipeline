{"summary": "the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is classified in the order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae and genus Arterivirus. the virus is classified in the order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae and genus Arterivirus, with the prototype virus Equine Arterivirus (EAV) and two other members, lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV) ribosomal frameshift (RFS) products pp1a-nsp2N, pp1a-nsp2TF are autoproteolytically cleaved into at least 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) associated with virus replication and transcription. nsp1 (papain-like cysteine protease), nsp2 (chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease) and nsp the characterization of nsp11 immunogenicity remains unclear. nsp11 can induce humoral immune response in PRRSV infected pigs. nsp11 is also responsible for different expression level of TNF-. the Laboratory Animal Ethical Committee of China Agricultural University has approved this research protocol. Virus, plasmids, cells and serum samples PRRSV genotype 1 strain GZ11-G1 and genotype 2 strain JXwn06 were used for cell inoculation in IFA and WB tests. pig serum samples collected from PRRSV inoculation trial or from pig farms were confirmed to be PRRSV positive or negative. the constructed His-fused nsp11 expressing plasmid pET28a-nsp11 was validated by DNA sequencing. nsp11-F GC GGATCC ACCCAGAACAATGAAAGGTGG nsp11-R GG GTCGAC TTCAAGTTGAAAATAGGCCGT nsp11-T1 F GCCTCGAGATGTCATACTATCTCACAAAATTTG nsp11- GGAGACAGTCTTCGCCACCATGGTGAGCAAGGGC nsp11-T2-3 R GGCGCGCTTTACTTGTACAG nsp11-T2-3 R GGCGCGCTTTACTTGTACAG nsp11-T2-5 R GGCGCGCTTTACTTGTACAG nsp11-T2-6 R GGCGCGCTTTACTTGTACAG nsp11-T2-7 F GGTGAGCAAGGGC nsp11-T2-6-1 R GGCGCTTTACTTGTACAG nsp11-T2-6-2 F GCCTTTACTTGTACAG nsp11-T2-6-2 F GCCTTTACTTGTACAG nsp11-T2-6-2 F GCCTTTACTTGTACAG nsp11-T2-6-4 F GCCTTTACTTGTACAG nsp11-T2-6-4 plasmid pET28a-nsp11 was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells (Transgens) for protein expression. pellets were washed twice by using 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by centrifugation for harvest. recombinant nsp1140-223aa protein emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant. booster vaccinations carried out twice via peritoneum at 3 and 6 weeks. mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation and spleen cells fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells using polyethylene glycol (PEG 1450) 96-well plate (Costar, Corning Incorporated) coated overnight with the purified His-nsp1140-223aa protein (0.4ug/well) were blocked for 2 h with 5% (wt/vol) skim milk in PBS at 37\u00b0C followed by three times wash with PBST. the plates were then incubated with 100 uL diluted nsp11 mouse antisera or supernatants of hybridoma at 37\u00b0C e with the amino acid sequence of DCREY were cross-linked to 96-well Maxisorp plates. peptides were coated with 50 g/ml poly-L-lysine using 0.1% glutaraldehyde. plates were blocked with 1 mol/L glycine at room temperature for 1 h. screened PRRSV positive or negative serum samples were diluted with blocking buffer.
