{"summary": "despite the availability of vaccines, the disease has broken out frequently in many swine-raising countries. evidence suggests PEDV encodes a defensive mechanism(s) to evade the antiviral activities of IFN. IFN regulatory factor-3 (IRF3), nuclear factor B (NF-B) and ATF-2/c-jun are activated. type I IFNs induce the activation of STAT transcription factors. dsRNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. our previous work found that human NL63 CoV (HCoV-NL63) also encodes a papain-like protease, termed PLP2, which has deubiquitinase (DUB) activity and antagonizes IFN induction. a recent study also showed that both arteri- and nairovirus DUBs inhibit RIG-I mediated innate immune signalling. PEDV infection fails to activate IFN- and interrupts poly(I : C)-mediated IFN- induction. the results indicated that PEDV infection interrupts dsRNA-mediated IFN- induction. vero E6 cells were infected with PEDV at an m.o.i. of 0.1. cells were cotransfected with IFN--Luc and an internal control plasmid pRL-TK. followed by PEDV infection at an m.o.i. of 0.1 or 1. vero E6 cells were transfected with IRF3 expression construct. another 12 h later, cells were mock-transfected with poly(I : C) fluorescence was examined by a confocal microscope. in Fig. 1f, IRF3 was located exclusively in the cytoplasm in mock-infected cells. but it rapidly translocated to the nucleus when those cells were transfected with poly(I : C) PEDV prevented the nuclear translocation of IRF3 induced by poly(I : C) HEK293T cells were co-transfected with either PLP1 or PLP2 at amounts of 200 ng, IFN--Luc and pRL-TK. PEDV PLP2 showed negligible inhibition activity of the IFN- promoter. PEDV PLP2 or catalytic mutants of PLP2 (C1729A, H1888A, D1901A) were transfected with the IFN- Luc and pRL-TK plasmids. HEK293T cells were then infected with Sendai virus to activate IFN- promoter activity. PLP2 exhibits a clear dose-dependent inhibition of IFN promoter activity. PEDV PLP2 has DUB activity that is dependent on its catalytic activity. the level of ubiquitin (Ub)-conjugated proteins was reduced dramatically in the cells infected with PEDV. HEK293T cells were transfected with HA-tagged Ub and either PEDV PLP1 or PLP2. HCoV NL63 PLP2 was used as a positive control of coronaviral DUB activity. ubiquitin lysine 48 (K48) and lysine 63 (K63) are linked through ubiquitin lysine 48 (K48) and lysine 63 (K63) the two most common types of ubiquitinated protein are linked through ubiquitin lysine 48 (K48) and lysine 63 (K63) HEK293T cells were transfected with PEDV PLP2 or the corresponding catalytic mutants (C1729A, H1888A, D1901A) together with Flag-RIG-IN, the N-terminal helicase domain of RIG-I as its constitutively active mutant, or Flag-STING. NL63 PLP2 was used as a positive control for IFN antagonist. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with increasing amounts of PEDV PLP2 along with reporters of IFN--Luc and STING for activation of IFN- expression. PEDV PLP2 inhibits STING-activated IFN expression which is dependent on its protease activity. PEDV PLP2 is detected in association with RIG-I, as well as STING. the results show that PEDV PLP2 is detected in association with RIG-I, as well as STING. HEK293T cells were transfected with PEDV PLP2. PEDV PLP2 interacts with and deubiquitinates RIG-I and STING. HEK293T cells were transfected with flag-tagged RIG-I (a) or STING (b) with V5-tagged PLP2. co-immunprecipitates were blotted with anti-V5 for RIG-I or STING detection. PEDV infection fails to activate IFN- and interrupts poly(I : C)-mediated IFN- induction. luciferase activity was barely detectable in PEDV-infected cells. luciferase activity was barely detectable in PEDV-infected cells. PEDV does not induce IFN- production and blocks dsRNA-induced IFN- promoter activation. vero E6 cells were cotransfected with IFN--Luc and an internal control plasmid pRL-TK followed by PEDV infection at an m.o.i. of 0.1 or 1. luciferase activities were measured as described in (a) f) PEDV inhibits dsRNA-induced IRF3 nuclear translocation. another 12 h later, cells were transfected or mock-infected with poly(I : C) PEDV prevented the nuclear translocation of IRF3 induced by poly(I : C) PEDV infection inhibits the activation of IRF3, but not NF-B and AP-1. this suggests PEDV suppresses IFN- transcription by interfering with the IRF3-mediated IFN expression signalling pathway. the cells were then mock infected or infected with Sendai virus to activate the IFN expression pathway. the core domain of PEDV PLP1 showed negligible inhibition activity of the IFN- promoter. PEDV PLP2 or catalytic mutants of PLP2 (C1729A, H1888A, D1901A) were co-transfected with 200 ng of PEDV PLP2 and catalytic mutants C1729A, H1888A and D1901A, with IFN--Luc and pRL-TK. the assay was performed similarly to that in (b) cells were cotransfected with increasing amounts of PEDV PLP2 (a) and the catalytic mutants C1729A (b), H1888A (c) and D1901A (d), followed by the assay which was performed similarly to that in Fig. 2(b, c). we asked if PEDV infection exhibits any DUB activity against host cellular proteins. HEK293T cells were transfected with HA-tagged Ub and either PEDV PLP1 or PLP2. HCoV NL63 PLP2 was used as a positive control of coronaviral DUB activity. PEDV PLP2 exhibits strong global DUB activity with significant reduction in the level of Ub-, K48- and K63-conjugated proteins. however, the catalytic mutants of PLP2 completely lost DUB activity against all types of ubiquitinated proteins. human coronavirus (NL63 and SARS) PLPs negatively regulate innate antiviral immune response by disrupting STING-mediated IFN induction. we hypothesized that PEDV PLP2 inhibits the IFN expression pathway through a similar mechanism. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with increasing amounts of PEDV PLP2 along with reporters of IFN--Luc and STING. PEDV PLP2 inhibits STING-activated IFN expression which is dependent on its protease activity. HEK293T cells were transfected with PEDV PLP2 together with Flag-RIG-I or Flag-STING for 24 h. the interaction of PLP2 and RIG-I or STING was assessed. the results show that PEDV PLP2 is detected in association with RIG-I, as well as STING. PEDV PLP2 interacts with and deubiquitinates RIG-I and STING. HEK293T cells were transfected with Flag-tagged RIG-I (a) or STING (b) with V5-tagged PLP2. the input lysates were blotted with anti-V5 for RIG-I or STING detection. immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-HA to detect Ub-K63-conjugated RIG-I (c) or STING (d) the input lysates were blotted with anti-V5 to detect PLP2 and the catalytic mutants (third panel) and anti-Flag to detect RIG-I and STING (bottom panel) we previously found that HCoV-NL63 PLP2 can antagonize type I IFN induction which is independent of catalytic activity. the underlying mechanism(s) that lead to the difference of IFN antagonism profile of PLP2 from different CoVs was not completely clear. the transmembrane domain downstream of CoV PLP2 has an essential effect on PLP2 DUB and IFN antagonistic activity. many cellular DUBs were identified as negative regulators of innate immunity. a central gatekeeper in inflammation and immunity, A20, has DUB activity and removes K-63 linked polyubiquitin lines from RIP1, TRAF6, RIP2 and NEMO. cells DUBA and CYLD also negatively regulate the innate immune response. human coV NL63 and SARS PLPs were found to be co-immunoprecipitated with STING, block STING dimer formation and negatively regulate assembly of STING-MAVS-TBK1/IKKe complexes. three catalytically inactive mutants of PEDV PLP2 failed to inhibit virus-induced IFN- activation. PEDV PLP2 is a viral DUB that cleaves ubiquitin chains from RIG-I and STING, thereby inhibiting the activation of type I IFN signaling. these characteristics reveal the multilayered counteracting of host defence by PEDV and suggest the possibility of developing effective new strategies. HEK293T cells were transfected with pRL-TK, IFN--Luc, PRD(III-I)4-Luc, pNF-B-Luc or pAP-1-Luc using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. HEK293T cells were transfected with PEDV PLP1, PEDV PLP2 and specific mutations in the PLP2 catalytic residues. the effect of PEDV PLP2 on ubiquitinated proteins in cultured cells was then assessed as described previously. vero E6 and HEK293T cells were transfeced with 2.0 g IRF3 expression construct. cells were then mock-infected or left untransfected with PEDV.
