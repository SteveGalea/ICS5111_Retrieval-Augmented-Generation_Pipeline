{"summary": "fecal samples were collected with plastic foil under trees occupied by Eidolon helvum bats (estimated colony size 300,000) for all capturing and sampling, permission was obtained from the Wildlife Division of the Ministry of Lands, Forestry, and Mines in Ghana. sequences were submitted to geneBank under the listed accession numbers. sequences were derived from this study and were submitted to geneBank under the listed accession numbers. Phylogenetic analysis Nucleic acid alignments were conducted based on amino acid code by using the ClustalW algorithm. two gap-free nucleotide alignments (817 bp and 1,221 bp) were generated. tree topologies were determined on both datasets by using MrBayes version 3.1 (20) location of Kwamang caves near village of Kwamang. Booyem caves A (7\u00b043\u203224.9\u2032\u2032N, 1\u00b016\u2032W) and B (7\u00b043\u203225.7\u2032\u2032N, 1\u00b059\u203233.5\u2032\u2032W) are located near remote small settlements in the vicinity of Booyem, Brong-Ahafo region. two gap-free nucleotide alignments (817 bp and 1,221 bp) were generated. two gap-free nucleotide alignments (817 bp and 1,221 bp) were generated. the analysis used a general time reversible (GTR) substitution model with 6 rate categories to approximate a gamma-shaped rate distribution across sites. two Metropolis-coupled chains of 107 iterations were sampled every 500 generations. chain lengths in BEAST were at least 20,000,000 generations with sampling every 500 generations. two morphotypes were observed in insect-eating leaf-nosed bats of the genus Hipposideros. the species could be discriminated unambiguously by morphology. both morphotypes belonged to phylogenetic lineages distinct from H. caffer and possibly represented 2 distinct species. a fraction of 15.4% of H. cf. ruber specimens yielded CoV, without a difference between sexes. 5 different nested RT-PCRs were designed and the RdRp fragment could finally be extended by 441 bp to the 5\u2032 end, providing an 817-nt fragment for phylogenetic analysis. all methods of phylogenetic inference placed this virus next to a common ancestor with human coronavirus 229E, which circulates worldwide in humans. a group 2 CoV was initially found in the Kwamang cave. the secondary group-specific PCR identified 4 additional samples of this virus. nucleotide identity among these sequences was 97.2%\u2013100%. phylogenetic analysis with different methods of inference yielded variable tree topologies suggesting basal associations with either the 2a, 2d, or 2b subgroups. a first analysis was conducted on the 1,225-bp dataset that did not include the novel GhanaBt-CoVGrp1. the resulting MRCA date of the hCoV-NL63/229E pair was 816 ad. the diversification estimate for the novel group 1 bat-CoV and hCoV-229E then was 1803 ad. c\u20131324) \u2013 817 2.1 10\u20134 (1.5\u20132.7 10\u20134) Constant size, nucleotide (GTR + G + I) 2053 (3433\u2013731 ) 1852 ad (1612\u20131852) 348 (119

substitution model in BEAST. this analysis did not yield a different substitution rate, but resulted in older resulting MRCA dates. the constant population size assumption used in all analyses was exchanged against expansion growth or exponential growth assumptions. phylogenetic placement of nucleocapsid gene of the GhanaBt-CoVGrp2 was not successful when we used 15 nested RT-PCRs designed on alignment of all available CoV 2b nucleocapsid sequences. amplification with above mentioned nested RT-PCRs for CoV group 1 was also unsuccessful. two morphotypes were observed in insect-eating leaf-nosed bats of the genus Hipposideros. the species H. abae could be discriminated unambiguously by morphology. a fraction of 15.4% of H. cf. ruber specimens yielded CoV, without a difference between sexes. only adult males and nonlactating adult females, but no lactating females, juveniles, and subadults of H. cf. ruber. all methods of phylogenetic inference placed this virus next to a common ancestor with human coronavirus 229E. the most closely related member of the GhanaBt-CoVGrp1 clade shared 91.90% nucleotide identity with hCoV-229E in the analyzed fragment. the secondary group-specific PCR identified 4 additional samples of this virus, 1 from Booyem Cave B and the remaining from Kwamang. nucleotide identity among these sequences was 97.2%\u2013100%. phylogenetic analysis with different methods of inference yielded variable tree topologies suggesting basal associations with either the 2a, 2d, or 2b subgroups. all methods of phylogenetic inference placed this virus next to a common ancestor with human coronavirus 229E. the most closely related member of the GhanaBt-CoVGrp1 clade shared 91.90% nucleotide identity with hCoV-229E in the analyzed fragment. the most distant member was 86.50% identical. nucleotide identity among these sequences was 97.2%\u2013100%. phylogenetic analysis with different methods of inference yielded variable tree topologies suggesting basal associations with either the 2a, 2d, or 2b subgroups. based on alignment of prototype group II viruses, 8 additional nested RT-PCR primer sets were designed and 2 of the samples could be amplified. the resulting MRCA date of the hCoV-NL63/-229E pair was 816 ad. the diversification estimate for the novel group 1 bat-CoV and hCoV-229E then was 1803 ad. estimates of the year of the most recent common ancestor of extant CoV. all years AD except as indicated. a Bayes factor test conducted in TRACER yielded a strong estimate of superiority of the codon-based model over the GTR + 4 + I model. both assumptions were predicted to fit the data better than the constant size model (Bayes factors 13.5 and 13.9) the nucleocapsid gene of the GhanaBt-CoVGrp2 was not successful. we used 15 nested RT-PCRs designed on alignment of all available CoV 2b nucleocapsid sequences. amplification with above mentioned nested RT-PCRs for CoV group 1 was unsuccessful. s in stool, up to 1012 RNA copies/mg, e.g., for different picornaviruses (30\u201332) it would be difficult to postulate that humans can acquire CoV from bat feces. future studies should investigate whether insects might constitute a source of CoV infection for bats. long sequences from novel bat CoV are tedious and technically demanding. some published phylogenies of bat CoV are based on short datasets. for molecular clock dating, we have therefore relied on reference viruses mainly from other mammals that covered our 1,221-bp fragment. all CoVs in our study were found in members of the genus Hipposideros. the genus Rhinolophus from the sister family Rhinolophidae was found to host SARS-like viruses in several studies in china. existence of the same virus clade in bats other than those of the family Hipposideridae may entail speculations about a possible origin of the SARS-like group of CoVs in Africa rather than in Asia. despite the statistical limitations of our rather small sample size, the absence of CoV in bats of the closely related species H. abae speaks in favour of tight host restriction. sub-saharan Africa (23) will be difficult to reconstruct if host transition event might have been associated with human epidemic disease."}
