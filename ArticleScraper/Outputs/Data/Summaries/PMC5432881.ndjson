{"summary": "MGs vary greatly in nature and include music festivals, sporting events, and spiritual or religious gatherings. the nature of infectious disease outbreaks associated with specific events is dependent on the type, location, and timing of the gathering. MGs where sanitation is inadequate may result in outbreaks of fecal-oral pathogens. more than 400 cases, originating from the strain circulating at the hajj, were later reported from 16 countries in both infected pilgrims and their close contacts. the outbreak strain (serogroup W) was identified to have evolved from endemic strains circulating in Algeria, Mali, or Gambia in the 1990s (14). this outbreak highlighted the threat both to those attending MGs and to their home communities. of the 25 complete genomes characterized here, seven were subtyped as A(H1N1/09) and 18 were characterized as A(H3N2) of the 25 complete genomes characterized here, seven were subtyped as A(H1N1/09) of the 25 complete genomes characterized here, seven were subtyped as A(H1N1/09) and 18 were characterized as A(H3N2).

gatherings were interspersed throughout the global diversity. each proposed introduction is labeled as a group in Fig. 3 and 4. despite the small sample size in this year, we were able to infer that

nucleotides in the NP gene, at positions 752 and 758, resulted in a 251V and I253T amino acid changes. at both positions a U nucleotide was fixed in sample AU/15/2015(H3), while in sample AU/24/2015(H3) a C nucleotide was dominant (at frequencies of 98.4% and 98.5%), with minor U variants present at frequencies of 1.6% at position 752 the samples SA/20/2015(H3) and SA/29/2015(H3) were from pilgrims who stayed in the same tent. the pilgrim who was the source of SA/28/2015(H3) stayed in an adjacent tent. a mixed population at position 890 in the M gene was transmitted from SA/20/2015(H3) to SA/28/2015(H3) and SA/29/2015(H3). a total of five nucleotide differences were present between AU/11/2015(H1) and SA/22/2015(H1) alone. a minor variant at the site of a nucleotide change suggests that samples SA/22/2015(H1) and SA/23/2015(H1) could potentially represent a transmission cluster. the final two groups, H3N2-2013 and H3N2-2014, consisted of samples that differed from each other at the genome level by 17 and 20 nu the fixed G nucleotide at position 661 in the NA gene of sample AU/6/2014(H3) was present in sample AU/7/2014(H3) at a 21.8% frequency with a dominant A nucleotide. the shared minor variant is therefore more likely to have evolved convergently, to have been present as a minor variant that circulated at subconsensus levels in the Hajj population. 74% of influenza virus infections were caused by A(H3N2) viruses. 65% in 2013, 86% in 2014, and 83% in 2015 were caused by A(H3N2) viruses. phylogenetic analysis indicates much of the influenza A virus diversity in the Hajj pilgrimages resulted from multiple introductions. but it was difficult to determine the country or area of origin due to the lack of phylogenetic resolution, inadequate sampling, and lineage mixing observed at the global level. the introduction of such diversity is unsurprising, especially with foreign pilgrims making up two-thirds of the participants. some studies of seasonal human influenza virus have revealed relatively loose transmission bottlenecks. some studies of seasonal human influenza virus have revealed relatively loose transmission bottlenecks such that multiple variants can pass between hosts. a low-frequency minor variant in the PB1 gene encoded a conservative amino acid change, K360R. it is therefore possible that this PB1 variant evolved convergently in these two hosts or circulated at low levels in the wider Hajj population. the only additional positive sample of influenza A virus collected in 2014 was from a Saudi pilgrim. RNA was extracted from all samples and multiplex reverse transcriptase PCRs (RT-PCRs) were performed to test for influenza A and B viruses, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 3, human coronaviruses (OC43, 229E, and NL63), human metapneumovirus, enterovirus, and adenoviruses. genome libraries were produced using a NexteraXT DNA sample preparation kit ( sequences were then trimmed to remove poor-quality data according to their quality scores using the modified Mott algorithm. at least 15 bp and 2 bp at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends were discarded. the remaining reads were initially mapped to randomly selected seasonal isolates from the influenza A subtypes. sequences were aligned using Mafft (version 7.271) (43) and inspected manually. phylogenetic trees of these data were estimated using the maximum likelihood (ML) procedure. a combination of subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR) and nearest-neighbor interchange (NNI) branch swapping was used. phylogenetic trees were estimated as above but with bootstrap support values generated using 100 replicates. a large data set of HA sequences from the A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) subtypes from 2013, 2014, and 2015, again with duplicate sequences removed. sequence alignments were performed as described above, again resulting in HA data sets of 1,698 bp in length. haplotype reconstruction was not undertaken due to its reported poor performance in phasing haplotypes using short reads. we called minor variants with the same stringent criteria but using a more liberal frequency cutoff of 1%. 4 5,305.6 15,092.2 3,432.9 A/Saudi Arabia/06/2014 (H3N2) A(H3N2) AU/6/2014(H3) 534,829 501,038 93.7 3,243.5 3,217.3 2,573.5 6,888.8 8,491.7 3,166.1 13,631.4 2,815 A/Saudi Arabia/07/2014 (H3N2) A(H3N2) AU/7/2014(H3) 608,425 552,302 86,569 99.8 3,997.6 4,168.2 3,539.1 7,258.6 8,056.2 7,353.7 13,729.4 1,980.5 A/Saudi Arabia/16/2015 (H3N2) A(H3N2) AU/16/2015(H3) 569,629 387,758 68.1 2,067.8 2,004.4 2,171 4,796 5,869.3 3,896.1 3,941.3 2,342.3 A/Saudi Arabia/18 A(H3N2) AU/24/2015(H3) 361,703 89,999 24.9 698.5 605.8 672 1364.6 1242.4 964.2 1529.7 277.4 A/Saudi Arabia/25/2015 (H3N2) A(H3N2) SA/25/2015(H3) 512,023 508,588 99.3 4,053.7 3,627.6 3,964.6 5,822.5 7,096.4 4,695.9 11, all consensus sequences generated here have been submitted to GenBank and assigned accession numbers KY681478 to KY681677. all intrahost sequence data have been submitted to the Sequence Read Archive under BioProject accession number PRJNA377792. the study design and sample collection procedures have been described previously.
