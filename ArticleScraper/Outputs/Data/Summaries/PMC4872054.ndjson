{"summary": "agrotransformant CPKO was constructed by substituting the translation initiating methionine codon with a stop codon. agrotransformant CP13aa was designed to express the CP devoid of the first 13aa by engineering a stop codon at the translation initiation site and a start codon at aa14. the positively charged arginine (R) and lysine (K) residues are highlighted in red. the hatched region indicates a previously identified RNA-binding domain. aa having a score equal or above 0.5 and below 0.5 are considered to be disordered and ordered respectively. the numbers shown in parentheses are the numbers of non-viral RNA nucleotides left after self-cleavage by the ribozyme (R) each of the above-mentioned agrotransformants was mixed with agrocultures of pRP to provide the HV-RdRp. plants co-infiltrated with pSTMV and pRP served as positive controls. at five days post infiltration, total RNA and protein preparation only the N-terminal 13aa motif had no detectable effect on plus-strand accumulation. a 4-fold increase in minus-strand accumulation was observed. a detectable level of a faster migrating CP was accumulated for variant 13aa. virions of wt STMV, CPKO, CP 13aa and CP13aa are shown. production of a truncated form of STMV RNA is associated with STMV replication in N. benthamiana9. production of STMV150 is linked to HV-dependent replication. the terminal 13aa motif of STMV CP is shown in Fig. 1C. the location of the positively charged amino acids is indicated by an underline. the nomenclature used to designate each variant is exemplified by 13aa. CPKO, CP13aa and 13aa were co-expressed with agrotransformant pRP. plants co-infiltrated with pSTMV and pRP served as positive controls. those infiltrated only with empty vector served as negative controls. a 3-fold increase in minus-strand accumulation was observed for the remaining four variants. production of STMV 150 was found associated with all variants except for 13aa/3A (Fig. 3B) production of STMV 150 was found associated with all variants except for 13aa/3A (Fig. 3B) phenotypes of full-length STMV CP bearing each of the five N-terminal alanine substitution variants (Fig. 3A) were engineered into the CP ORF of the full-length STMV agrotransformant. effect on replication, translation, virion assembly and genome packaging was evaluated. rRNA represents loading controls for Northern blots. Accumulation of (+) and ()-strand progeny was quantitated as described in the Fig. 2 legend. accumulation of (+)-strand was observed (Fig. 4B, lanes 2\u20135) contrary to the accumulation level seen with the same variants engineered in the CP 13aa construct. results of RT-PCR assays used to evaluate the production of STMV 150 are similar to those shown in Fig. 3B. CP production was more prominent with variant 7A than others. Icosahedral virions of 18 nm were detected in wt as well as in variants 5A, 7A, 10A and 11A but not in variant 3A. only virions of wt contained full-length STMV RNA as well as truncated STMV (i.e. STMV 150), a characteristic feature of STMV in N. benthamiana9. wt CP, variants 5A and 7A, but not 3A, were co-precipitated with HV-RdRp (i.e. anti-126 kDa), suggesting that RNA is not involved in promoting the interaction between HV-RdRp and STMV CP. expression of HV-RdRp, STMV CP and its variants in total protein extracts was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-126kDa and anti-STMV CP antibodies. total protein extracts from each sample were incubated first with anti-126kDa antibody followed by complex precipitation with protein-G agarose. a Northwestern analysis was performed using in vitro translation products of wt and four CP variants (CPKO, 3A, 5A and 7A) and 32P-labeled STMV RNA as a binding probe. interaction between STMV RNA and CPs of wt, variants 5A and 7A was detectable. HV-RdRp (183 kDa) or, BMV RdRp (109 and 94 kDa) and BMV CP (19 kDa) were fractionated by either 8% (panel i) or 10% SDS-PAGE (panels ii and iii) blot represents input control analyzed using a mixture of antibodies raised against TMV-RdRp, BMV-RdRp, BMV CP and STMV agrotransformant CPKO was constructed by substituting the translation initiating methionine codon located at nucleotides 162\u2013164 with a stop codon. agrotransformant CP13aa was designed to express the CP devoid of the first 13aa by engineering a stop codon at the translation initiation site. CP variant CP13aa was engineered to express CP lacking the N-terminal 13aa motif due to the presence of a stop codon between nt 162\u2013164 (162UAG164) each agroconstruct contains in sequential order (L to R), double Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoters (indicated by arrowheads), a ribozyme (R, indicated by a bent arrow) quantitative analysis of progeny RNA with respect to the wt control is tabulated and shown in Fig. 2B. CP decreased the plus-strand accumulation by 90% while minus-strand accumulation was not affected. expression of only the N-terminal 13aa motif had no detectable effect on plus-strand accumulation. RT-PCR assays of wt STMV and indicated CP variants were performed using total RNA isolated from leaves harvested at 4 dpi. data was quantitated and compared internally with each levels of (+) and ()-strands to that of wild type. production of STMV150 was associated with either wt STMV (Fig. 2A, lane 1 in RT-PCR panel) but not with variants defective in expressing the 13aa. expression of the 13aa plays a crucial role in STMV replication9. agrotransformants of CPKO, CP13aa and 13aa were co-expressed with agrotransformant pRP in N. benthamiana leaves. virions were purified, negatively stained and examined by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) no virions were detected in leaves infiltrated with any of the three CP variants. alanine residue was substituted singly for each arginine or lysine residues normally located within the N-terminal 13aa motif. each of these agrotranformants was co-infiltrated with pRP into N. benthamiana leaves. progeny were evaluated using Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses. production of STMV 150 was found associated with all variants except for 13aa/3A. RT-PCR analysis suggested that arginine and lysine residues at the N-terminus play a significant role for maintaining wild type replication of the STMV RNA. total RNA and protein samples were isolated from leaves harvested at 4 dpi. panel C summarizes the absolute values of accumulated (+) and ()-strand progeny RNA. positions of STMV and STMV150 are indicated to the left. wt STMV was inoculated with helper virus TMV-U5 and virion RNA of wt and indicated STMV variant samples. despite near wt levels of ()-strand accumulation, a >90% reduction in the accumulation of (+)-strand was observed for variant 3A (lane 1; Fig. 4C) virions of 18 nm were detected in wt as well as in variants 5A, 7A, 10A and 11A but not in variant 3A. virions of all four variants contained only the truncated STMV 150 but not full length. inability to induce infection in plants mechanically inoculated with virions of HV and each of the four CP variants confirm that CP variants are incompetent to package full length STMV RNA. results show that STMV CP has a regulatory role in replication. a direct or indirect interaction exists between HV-RdRp and STMV CP. the arginine residue located at position 3 is obligatory in promoting this interaction. RNA is not involved in promoting the interaction between HV-RdRp and CP. CP was expressed either independently or co-expressed with HV-RdRp in N. benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration. one batch was treated with RNase (+RNase) and the other remained untreated (-RNase). CP Northern blot results demonstrate the importance of CP in STMV replication. blots containing in vitro translation products were generated following 12% SD-PAGE analysis. the first blot (i) was subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-STMV CP antibody. the second (ii) and third (iii) blots were respectively subjected to hybridization. CP-regulated viral RNA synthesis occurs via CP-RNA interactions as in the case of Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV)13,14 or CP-RdRp interactions as in the case of member viruses of the Coronaviridae15 and rubella virus16 or CP functioning as an RNA chaperone11,17,18. a positive residue at the third position in the N-terminal 13aa region promotes the interaction between HV-RdRp and ST STMV CP (Fig. 2) actively participates in modulating (+) an/or ()-strand synthesis. the critical role played by the CP is exemplified when the replication profile of wt and mutant CPKO is compared. this is exemplified by increased accumulation of (+)-strands over the ()-strands. these observations suggest that (+) and ()-strand accumulation is regulated by the context of the N-terminal 13aa motif. substitution of an alanine residue for an arginine at position 3 had very little effect on ()-strand synthesis. production of 150 is linked to HV-dependent replication since it was not detected in plants infiltrated with replication defective variants of STMV. many in vitro viral self-assembly studies show that RNA packaging can be largely explained through electrostatic interactions24. the in the figure corresponds to the charge density of the inner wall of the capsid. it is 0.24 electron/nm2 for the capsid constructed by mutated coat proteins. blue dots and orange squares represent the encapsidation free energy of STMV150 RNA. wt RNA gets encapsidated much less efficiently than STMV150 RNA. wt RNA gets encapsidated much less efficiently than STMV150 RNA. electrostatics clearly explains the results corresponding to variants 5A, 7A, 10A and 11A presented in Fig. 5C. an amino acid residue (i.e. arginine) at a specific site is crucial for successful packaging. identification and disruption of contacts between particular CP residues and RNA could contribute to our knowledge of developing novel antiviral drug strategies for RNA viruses pathogenic to pathogenic to humans and animals. resulting PCR products were gel purified and used as mega primers in a PCR reaction. resulting PCR products were digested with HindIII and SalI and sub-cloned into a similarly treated pSTMV. the nature of all recombinant clones was verified by DNA sequencing.
