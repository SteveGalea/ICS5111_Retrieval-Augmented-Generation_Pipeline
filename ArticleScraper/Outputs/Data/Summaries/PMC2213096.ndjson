{"summary": "infection, immunity, and aging Immune aging manifests itself at several levels. age-associated increase in susceptibility to infectious diseases is well established. pathogens use distinct ports of entry and induce distinct pathologies that affect numerous organ systems. macrophage activation, DC migration, follicular DC function, and toll-like receptor\u2013mediated activation were all found to be impaired or dysregulated to some degree. antigen presentation, although still insufficiently investigated, has been reported to be decreased (8). major advances made in the last couple of years have helped define many of the age-related defects in the T and B cell compartments. one study showed that transfer of young T cells into aged mice largely normalizes antibody production. one suspect in this decline appears to be diminished expression of CD40 ligand. in a steady-state situation, new (naive) T cells are constantly produced by the thymus. the same number of T cells needs to be lost on a daily basis to make space for the newcomers. if not all, cells dying in this situation would also be naive. both memory and naive T cells sense the void and begin proliferating. changes in supply and demand of naive T cells set the stage for most profound changes in aging. fewer naive RTE will mean higher proliferation of the remaining naive T cells. thymic function, lymphocyte turnover, and T cell repertoire are a testament to the resilience of homeostasis. in humans, the age of 65 is usually taken as the beginning of senescence. in humans, the age of 65 is usually taken as the beginning of senescence. compensation for naive T cell loss occurs at the level of cell populations and individual cells. cell division is one of the main causes of mutations, which can lead to cancer (22) or to less severe transformation as in the case of T and B cell clonal expansions. the results were confirmed in both the TCR transgenic and wild-type mouse models. if confirmed, these results would bode well for the attempts to increase thymic production and/or improve survival and maintenance of naive T cells. aging treatment targets Result (reference) deglycosylation of T cell surface molecules in mice CD43, CD45 and other surface molecules Improved signaling, proliferation and cytokine secretion in both old and young. a fundamental question whether some vaccines need to be reengineered, and whether others can be modified, still needs to be answered."}
