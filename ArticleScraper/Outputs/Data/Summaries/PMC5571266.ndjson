{"summary": "alphaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses belonging to the family togaviridae together with rubella virus, the only member of genus Rubivirus. some new world alphaviruses can cause serious nervous system infections, while others are associated with fever, rash, and arthritis. the alphavirus genome is translated to yield polyprotein P1234, which is the precursor of viral nonstructural proteins nsP1 to nsP4. all four nsPs are required for RNA synthesis (10\u201312), and they all are found at replication spherules (2, 3). the processing of P1234 takes place in a defined sequence of steps, and it has been established that the different processing intermediates play a critical role in the strand specificity of the RESULTS Expression and activity of partially cleaved SFV replicases. we proposed that alphavirus RNA synthesis and spherule formation take place concomitantly. a mutant replicase called P1234 was capable of efficient minus-strand synthesis and spherule formation. in the present experiments, we provided polyproteins starting with nsP2 as ubiquitin fusions. in the replicase, we included enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP; denoted as G in polyproteins) fused to nsP3 for detection of transfected cells in correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) experiments. luciferase activity in cell extracts 16 h after transfection of polypeptides. a representative experiment is shown, and the constructs are shown in the same order in the three panels. luciferase activity in cell extracts 16 h after transfection. the cleavage of nsP4 is essential for RNA synthesis and virus replication. luciferase levels were intermediate between wild-type replicase and negative controls. a three-construct combination, 1+2CA3G+4, mimicked this behavior (lane 9) spherule structures were more heterogeneous in size and irregularly shaped. we cannot exclude that cellular or plasmid-derived RNAs could be unspecifically recruited to the invaginations in the absence of the viral template. some alphavirus replicase proteins can give rise to spherules in the absence of RNA. uncleaved P123 (P12CA3G) without the core polymerase subunit nsP4 was not sufficient for spherule formation even if provided with a template. however, P12CA3G+4 readily gave rise to spherules in the absence of template. however, the combination of 1+2CA3G+4 yielded spherule structures. large areas of the plasma membrane are devoid of spherules even in replication-positive or transfection-positive cells. large areas of the plasma membrane are devoid of spherules even in replication-positive or transfection-positive cells. however, extensive efforts have been made to examine samples reported as spherule negative. nsP2 and nsP3 are no longer suitable for assembly. cells were transfected with the constructs indicated on the left. protein localization was detected at 16 h posttransfection. nsP2 has a nuclear localization signal, but remains cytoplasmic in a fraction of the cells, whereas nsP3 localizes to aggregations coopting some of the components of cellular stress granules. nsP2 has a nuclear localization signal, but remains cytoplasmic in a fraction of the cells, whereas nsP3 localizes to aggregations. a selected set of constructs were built for SINV. they included P123 with protease-inactivating CA substitution in nsP2 and eGFP fused to nsP3. nsP4 was usually produced as a separate protein utilizing ubiquitin fusion. nsP1 to -3 were expressed as an uncleavable polyprotein, P12CA3G. when the polyprotein was cleavable, nsP2 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm. nsP3 was found exclusively in granules in spite of possible presence of multiple forms of nsP3. EM images of thin sections from cells transfected with the indicated constructs are shown. expression and activity of partially cleaved SFV replicases. mutant replicase called P1234 was capable of efficient minus-strand synthesis and spherule formation. cleavage-defective replicase constructs in which the cleavage sites have been destroyed. the nsP2 protease has been inactivated by mutating the active site cysteine to alanine. in some experiments, the replicase is provided as multiple fragments from separate plasmids. insertion of eGFP (denoted \u201cG\u201d in polyprotein constructs) into nsP3 is indicated. the template Tshort (14) contains the regions of viral RNA necessary for replication and expresses the Renilla luciferase enzyme. P12CA3G4, a totally uncleaved polyprotein, could not be detected in Western blotting. the protein was expressed as evidenced by immunofluorescence staining with antibodies against the nsPs and by eGFP autofluorescence utilized in CLEM experiments. luciferase levels were intermediate between wild-type replicase and negative controls. the wild-type replicase can only form spherules in the presence of an RNA template but not in its absence. we initially observed that P123G4GAA was capable of forming spherule structures both in the presence and in the absence of RNA template. however, the appearance of these spherules was distinct from those seen under replicating conditions. Totally cleavage-defective P12CA3G4 did not yield spherules in extensive searches made with this construct expressed at low levels. nsP4 was not sufficient for spherule formation even if provided with a template. however, the presence of individual nsP4 was required for spherule formation. nsP4 needs to be cleaved off the remainder of the polyprotein. it can be provided as uncleaved P123 or as the combination of nsP1 plus uncleaved P23. the former leads to more efficient spherule formation. spherules in a cell expressing the three-protein combination 1+2CA3G+4 together with the template did not replicate to any extent (Fig. 1C and D, lane 10). altogether this indicates that the three replication proteins nsP1, P23, and nsP4 constitute the minimal viral requirements for efficient assembly of replication complexes. nsP3 localized in granules, whereas nsP2 was found diffusely in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm. nsP2 localized to aggregations coopting some of the components of cellular stress granules. nsP2 has a nuclear localization signal, but remains cytoplasmic in a fraction of the cells. nsP4 had only a minor effect on the fractionation of P23G. nsP4 was recruited to membranes in the presence of nsP1 and nsP4. partially uncleaved Sindbis virus nonstructural proteins generate spherules. a selected set of constructs were built for SINV. a sample with template was included, verifying the efficient active spherule formation with the uncleaved P123 together with nsP4. the analysis of protein localizations showed similar behavior as with SFV. nsP2 and nsP3 were detected diffusely and were to some extent seen on the plasma membrane. the expected sizes of nsP3-containing bands are marked on the right. there is a prominent unspecific band present in all samples. nsP2 and nsP3-containing proteins are detected in cells transfected with the indicated construct combinations. the 1a protein contains RNA capping enzyme and RNA helicase domains corresponding to alphavirus nsP1 and the N-terminal domain of nsP2. specific mutations in 1a can alter the size and abundance of the spherules. the size of alphavirus spherules is determined by the length of the RNA template (20) nsP4 may facilitate the proper interactions of other domains within the alphavirus replicase that are not found in BMV proteins. in the absence of RNA, uncleaved P123+nsP4 generated spherules more efficiently than nsP1+uncleaved P23+nsP4. in the absence of RNA, the latter combination still efficiently assembled replication complexes, but cleavable P23 did not. spherule sizes are dependent on the template length (20) replicase proteins are able to interact with cellular factors that are present at the replication complexes. the current results provide the means to specifically assay spherule formation independently of RNA replication. postnuclear supernatant was prepared by removing nuclei and intact cells by centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min. the postnuclear supernatant was further centrifuged at 15,000 g for 20 min. ubi-nsP23G and ubi-nsP2CA3G were constructed by cloning a fragment of ubi-nsP2 containing a similar ubiquitin fusion to nsP4 (14), with NcoI and SacI into P123G and P123Z4GAA. nsP1-expressing construct was created using a PCR amplification. plasmid expressing wild-type P1234 under control of bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter was constructed as described for the equivalent chikungunya virus construct (42) the sequence was not codon optimized and sequences from human -actin, hepatitis delta virus ribozyme, or T7 terminator were not included. plasmid was designated P1234-SINV. the basic expression cassette was obtained as synthetic DNA (Genscript) and consisted of the following parts: (i) a promoter for bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase followed by 257 5\u2032 residues of SINV genome, (ii) a fragment corresponding to the SINV subgenomic RNA promoter (residues 76 to 63, with respect to beginning of subgenomic RNA), and (iii) the 3\u2032 untranscribed region Filters were blocked against nonspecific binding using 5% nonfat dry milk powder and probed with antibodies specific for individual SFV or SINV nsPs. signals were obtained by incubating the filters with secondary antibodies IRDye800CW-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Li-Cor Biosciences) and Alexa Fluor 680-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) cells were grown either on MatTek or Ibidi dishes with a glass bottom and grid. all CLEM samples were transfected with the indicated combinations of SFV or SINV constructs. the fluorescence mode was used to obtain images from transfection-positive cells. two micrograms of total RNA was fractionated on a denaturing 1% agarose gel.
