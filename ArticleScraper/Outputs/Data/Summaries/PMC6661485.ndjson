{"summary": "a total of 371 swabs and organ samples were collected from four types of chicken including layer, sonali (local), broiler, and broiler breeder under eight districts (Rangpur, Bogura, Tangail, Dhaka, Gazipur, mymensingh, Jamalpur, and Cumilla) the overall prevalence was 17.52% recorded and among the selected types of chicken, the highest prevalence of IBV was found in layer that was 42.22% followed by 17.24% in the three isolates from different places in Bangladesh were identified for the 1st time as which will help for IBV control strategy. the poultry industry in Bangladesh has grown leaps and bound since the past two decades. IBV is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. the spike (S) glycoprotein is cleaved into two smaller proteins, namely S1 (amino-terminal component) and S2 (carboxy-terminal component) mortality rates as high as 40%-90% were observed in affected chicks. the present study was aimed to determine the prevalence of IBV as well as virus isolation, identification, and molecular characterization of various strains circulating in Bangladesh. a total number of 371 swab and organ samples were collected from the respective farm. the chickens were vaccinated with IBV vaccine against MA5, H120, and IB 4/91 strain. RT-PCR of the extracted RNA was conducted using the commercially available AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen, USA) thermocycler used for PCR was Applied Biosystem 7500 by Life Technologies. sequences of the S1 gene of the Bangladeshi IBV isolates were compared with published IBV sequences deposited in the GenBank database using a BLAST. phylogenetic tree of amino acid sequences of S1 genes of isolated infectious bronchitis virus was constructed using R version 3.4.0 and under package phangorn version 2.4.0. the organ samples were taken into sterile pestle and homogenized with the help of sterile scissors and mortar and added 20% phosphate-buffered saline to make a suspension. supernatant fluid was taken by syringe for RNA extraction. RNA extraction was done with Purelink RNA Mini Kit, P/N: 12183018A. 94\u00b0C for 15 min; 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 min followed by 60\u00b0C for 60 s 2 25RT-enzyme 1.0 3 Forward primer 1.25 4 Reverse primer 1.25 5 Probe 0.25 6 Nuclease-free water 3.75 7 Template RNA 5.0 Total 25.0 RT-PCR=Reverse transcriptase chain reaction Propagation and isolation of virus Samples that were found high positive in IBV RT-PCR (Ct 30) the highest prevalence of IBV was found in commercial layer chicken that was 42.22% (19/45) and the lowest prevalence was showed broiler chicken as 11.94% (16/134) the prevalence of 17.24% (10/58) and 14.93% (20/134) was shown in Sonali and broiler breeder chicken, respectively. total 371 65 17.52 Three years (2014-2016) were observed during the study period, among three seasons, highest 22.67 (34/150) and lowest 11.58% (11/95) prevalence was found in winter and summer season correspondingly. in rainy season, 15.87% (20/126) prevalence was found. the identified IBV samples were inoculated into 9-day-old SPF ECE through chorioallantoic membrane route. the chicken embryos were shown characteristic lesions of growth such as curled and dwarfed embryos with covered by a thickened amnion after the third passage propagation. a total of 79.38% sera samples of chickens of selected four districts of Bangladesh were seropositive. commercial layer chickens were the highest (42.22%) prevalence of IBV and lowest prevalence was in broiler chickens. mortality increased in young chicken than older due to respiratory distress and kidney manifestation. incidence of IBV increased during winter season due to cold weather is more favorable to IBV for survival. study was collected from eight districts of Bangladesh.
