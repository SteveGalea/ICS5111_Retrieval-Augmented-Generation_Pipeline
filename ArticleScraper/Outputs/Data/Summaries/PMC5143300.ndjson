{"summary": "NAFLD is a condition where fat accumulates in the hepatocytes of patients who have not consumed excessive amounts of alcohol. estimates of the prevalence range from 6.3% to 33%, depending on the population (5,6). there is an increased prevalence of NAFLD in T2D patients (7). TZDs are potent peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists that lower blood glucose levels by ameliorating systemic insulin sensitivity and inflammation. lobeglitazone is currently being prescribed for T2D in Korea (14) erum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL for males and 1.4 mg/dL for females were excluded. subjects with a history of corticosteroid treatment for at least 14 days within the two-month period prior to screening were excluded. those with NAFLD, as confirmed by a CAP value 250 dB/m, were enrolled in this study. alanine transaminase [ALT], gamma glutamyl transferase [GTP] and gamma glutamyl transferase [GTP] were used as secondary endpoints. alterations from baseline in the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMAIR) were used as secondary endpoints. a fibroscan 501\u00ae placed the tip of the M probe on the skin between the ribs, over the right lobe of the liver. a success rate of 60% and a ratio for the interquartile range (IQR) to the median value of LSM (IQR/MLSM) of 30% were considered reliable and used for the final analysis. s and Pearson\u2019s 2 tests were used for continuous and categorical variables. a responder to lobeglitazone was defined as any individual who showed a decrease in CAP after treatment. changes in CAP values and clinico-laboratory parameters were evaluated using a paired t-test. subjects with a history of renal dysfunction (serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL for males and 1.4 mg/dL for females), heart failure (NYHA) class III and IV), uncontrolled heart arrhythmia, or cardio-cerebral events (unstable angina, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, cerebral infarct, or hemorrhage) were also excluded. alterations from baseline in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance were used as secondary endpoints. patients visited the clinic for initial screening and baseline measurement. at the baseline visit, CAP and liver US were performed again. a fibroscan 501\u00ae (Echosens) placed the tip of the M probe on the skin between the ribs, over the right lobe of the liver. a success rate of 60% and a ratio for the interquartile range (IQR) to the median value of LSM (IQR/MLSM) of 30% were considered reliable and used for the final analysis. a responder to lobeglitazone was defined as any individual who showed a decrease in CAP after treatment. changes in CAP values and clinico-laboratory parameters were evaluated using a paired t-test.
