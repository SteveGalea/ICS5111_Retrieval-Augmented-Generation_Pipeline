{"summary": "initIAL MERS DIAGNOSIS A 27-year-old expatriate female was tested for MERS-CoV. she was found to be positive by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of a nasopharyngeal swab. she was admitted to a referral hospital in Riyadh on October 10. the red circle at day 36 of the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health (MoH) real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) results represents a probable positive result. only 1 of 2 rRT-PCR assays was positive; cycle threshold (Ct) values not available. the dashed line represents the limit of detection. 16 NP swabs were collected for MERS-CoV diagnostic testing. rRT-PCR assays targeting MERS-CoV upE and ORF1a genes. swabs collected during 10\u201332 days after illness onset tested positive. RNA was extracted from 200-L sample aliquots on a NucliSens EasyMAG. stool extracts were also diluted 1:5 in nuclease-free water to remove potential stool inhibitors. 1.0 104 genome copies/gm of stool from day 15 were obtained from the 2 sequential NP swabs. they showed 99.9% similarity and closest phylogenetic clustering with sequences from 4 severely ill MERS patients. the cells were observed daily between days 3 and 7 postinoculation. antibody Responses Sera collected at days 13 and 15 after onset were examined for the presence of MERS-CoV-specific antibodies against the nucleocapisd (N) and S proteins. both specimens were below the limit of detection for both N and S enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RNA was extracted from 200-L sample aliquots on a NucliSens EasyMAG. RNA was extracted from 200-L sample aliquots on a NucliSens EasyMAG. results for the remaining 2 were not available (Figure 1A). 4.8 106 and 9.6 105 genome copies/mL in the NP specimens collected on days 13 and 15, respectively, and 1.0 104 genome copies/gm of stool from day 15. they showed 99.9% similarity and closest phylogenetic clustering with sequences from 4 severely ill MERS patients. the variant alleles of the isolate would predict amino acid changes (N>D in spike [S] protein and V>L in ORF4a) the variant alleles of the isolate would predict amino acid changes (N>D in spike [S] protein and V>L in ORF4a) that may reflect adaptation in culture. the patient was admitted to the hospital for isolation following MERS-CoV detection. home isolation may be considered for mildly ill patients who test positive for MERS-CoV [18] but this case patient resided in shared accommodation, and home isolation was not practical."}
