{"summary": "the antelope Arabian Oryx was extirpated from the wild as a result of massive hunting during early 1970s. fortunately, the efforts of captive breeding programs succeeded to preserve the Arabian Oryx, which was later reintroduced in certain protected areas. the emergence of sophisticated evolutionary models has placed a burden on researchers to select the model most appropriate for their data. an inappropriate choice of evolutionary model can affect the outcome of any phylogenetic analysis by incorrectly estimating tree topologies. the choice between them has been contentious at times but often give similar results. somaculatus were used as outgroup due to its close relationship to Oryx yet representing a separate sister taxa. the gene-bank accession numbers and the number of nucleotides for the partial sequences of 16S rRNA, cyt-b and d-loop of the four taxa are: Oryx leucoryx (U87021, 342; AF036286, 1143; AJ235326, 1253), Oryx dam the gamma-corrected Bayesian inference of phylogeny was conduced using MrBayes software. the phylogenetic analyses were performed using the evolutionary distances computed by maximum composite likelihood method. both UPGMA and MP analyses were performed using MEGA4 software. the results of Tajima\u2019s neutrality are given in Table 1. both the number of segregating sites (S) and nucleotide diversities () were directly correlated. the test of homogeneity of substitution patterns showed certain identities and certain variations in disparity index as well as Monte Carlo probability for different mitochondrial markers. the estimates of the disparity index per site are shown for each sequence pair above the diagonal. the topologies of all the Bayesian trees were identical irrespective of the marker type. the UPGMA trees resulting from 16S rRNA and d-loop sequences were also identical (Oryx dammah grouped with Oryx leucoryx) to Bayesian trees. maximum composite likelihood method for inferring phylogenetic relationship among various Oryx species using Addax as an outgroup. the bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates was obtained using the close neighbor interchange algorithm. cyt-b was lowest in d-loop region whereas the converse was true for the substitutions. most of the substitutions were transitional indicating a recent species history. the possibility of reduced phylogenic information due to back mutations may not be ruled out. changing the outgroup species or the length of d-loop segment can significantly alter the topology of phylogenic trees."}
