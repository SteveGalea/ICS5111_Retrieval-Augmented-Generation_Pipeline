{"summary": "direct WGS of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) has been reported. viral RNA amounts in clinical samples are usually too low for direct WGS. RT-PCR is a common method for amplifying viral RNA. a flocked eSwabTM (Copan Diagnostics, CA, USA) was swept inside the calf\u2019s nostril and kept frozen in 1 ml transport medium at -80\u00b0C until analysis. a supernatant (140 l) was treated with 2.8 g RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) and 6 Units Turbo DNase (Ambion, MA, USA) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. the RNA containing aqueous phase was mixed with 70% ethanol (1:1) and added to an RNeasy mini kit column (Qiagen) the RNA concentration (3\u20135 ng/l) and purity were measured by Nanodrop (thermo Scientific, DE, USA) the RNA was kept at -80\u00b0C until further use. aliquots of 6 l tagged dsDNA were amplified using primer FR20. the amplification steps were 95\u00b0C for 20 s followed by 30 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 90 s. the PCR products were purified with the NucleoSpin\u00ae Gel and PCR clean-up kit. 40 l of amplified dsDNA was purified with Qiaquick PCR purification Kit (Qiagen) and eluted in 30 l of buffer. libraries were validated by quantification using Qubit\u00ae 2.0 Fluorometer and Qubit\u00ae dsDNA HS Assay kit (Invitrogen) Sequencing was performed using a MiSeq (Illumina) and 600 Cycles MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 in a paired-end mode. raw data from the miSeq run were quality checked and trimmed. the supernatant (140 l) was treated with 2.8 g RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) and 6 Units Turbo DNase (Ambion, MA, USA) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. the RNA containing aqueous phase was mixed with 70% ethanol (1:1) and added to an RNeasy mini kit column (Qiagen) three aliquots of 6 l tagged dsDNA were amplified using primer FR20. the amplification steps were 95\u00b0C for 20 s followed by 30 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 90 s. cDNA was produced using oligo dT and random hexamers. dsDNA was purified using oligo dT and random hexamers. library concentration was measured by nanodrop (104\u2013108 ng/l) Sequencing was performed using a MiSeq (Illumina) and 600 Cycles MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 in a paired-end mode. raw data from the miSeq run were quality checked and trimmed. results Sequence data The majority of reads from all four datasets remained after quality trimming. reads to the BCoV reference revealed a clear difference between the datasets originating from the two amplification methods. only 0.07% of reads from the SISPA datasets mapped to BCoV compared to 42\u201347% of the reads from the Ovation datasets. in O1 and O2 between 9 000\u201311 000 reads were identified covering most of the BRBV genome. in S1 and S2, only 3 and 10 sequences were identified. the BRBV identified has been genetically characterised. for both SISPA sets, only 0.07% of reads mapped to the reference genome and sequence depth varied between 0\u2013208 for S1 and 0\u2013249 for S2. in contrast, 42.34% (O1) and 47.87% (O2) of the reads from samples prepared by the Ovation protocol mapped to the BCoV genome. reads Data sets Raw O1 O2 S1 S2 Total reads 9 231 412 6 353 426 6 930 526 6 271 024 Average length (nt) 216,4 228,6 246,5 256,6 Trimmed Total reads 9 190 660 6 325 015 6 907 172 6 258 362 Average length (nt) 175,0 183,6 175,8 182,2 Mapped to BCoV total reads 3 891 3 the BRBV identified has been genetically characterised [19]. the difference in overall viral content between the data sets generated with the two amplification methods was obvious. the lowest sequence depth for the Ovation samples was comparable to the highest depth for SISPA. for the Ovation samples a peak showed at 6 kb (ORF1a), while in the SISPA samples there was a peak just after 20 000 bp (end of ORF1/b and covering the NS2 gene) direct WGS of the FMDV has been performed on samples containing 1 x 107 genome copies per ul RNA. however, as BCoV has a larger RNA genome (32 kb compared to 8.5 kb for FMDV) amplification of the RNA was considered a necessity. the benefit of the amplification method is not restricted to deep sequencing of BCoV. this protocol also gave roughly 1000 times more BRBV reads than the SISPA protocol. the lower sequencing depth of BRBV was probably due to the lower number of BRBV genomes. the results on two technical replicates show a clear difference between the two methods regarding efficient amplification of the RNA genome from two different viruses. the results on two technical replicates show a clear difference between the two methods regarding efficient amplification of the RNA genome from two different viruses."}
