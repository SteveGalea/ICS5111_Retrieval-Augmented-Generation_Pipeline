{"summary": "the viral protein interaction maps have been generated until now only for a limited number of viruses, including vaccinia virus [1], potato virus A [3], pea seed-borne mosaic virus [3], pea seed-borne mosaic virus [3], wheat steak mosaic virus [4], hepatitis C virus [5], [6], porcine teschovirus [7], and very recently severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [9], [10]. the genome of SARS-CoV contains a single-stranded, plus-sense RNA of approximately 29.7 kb in length. fourteen open reading frames (ORFs) have been identified. the two large ORFs in the 5\u2032-proximal two-third of the genome encode the viral replicase. hexadecamer of nsp7 and nsp8 may possess dsRNA-binding activity. nsp9 is a single-stranded RNA-binding protein. nsp13 is shown to be RNA helicase and 5\u2032-triphosphatase. the 3\u2032 one-third of genome encodes 12 viral proteins including the structural and accessory proteins. proteins S, E, M, and N are four well described structural and accessory proteins, and 3a, 6, 7a, and 7b are also reported to be virion-associated proteins. these proteins are not essential for viral replication and transcription at least in cell culture and tested animal models. all known ORFs were amplified by PCR from viral cDNAs of SARS-CoV isolate WHU [51] and cloned into pGEM-T vector. the large polyprotein encoded by ORF 1a/b was split into 18 domains according to the proteinase cleavage sites, except for nsp3 which was divided into 3 parts based on predicted functional domains. 85\u20139984 K2741- Q3240 500 TM nsp5 9985\u201310902 S3241- Q3546 306 3CLpro nsp7 10903\u201311772 G3547- Q3836 290 TM nsp7 11773\u201312021 S3837-Q3919 83 dsRNA-binding nsp8 12022\u201312615 A3920-Q4117 198 dsRNA-binding & n/a 221 membrane 6 27074\u201327265 n/a 63 antagonist of IFN 7a 27273\u201327641 n/a 122 7b 27638\u201327772 n/a 44 8b 27864\u201328118 n/a 422 Nucleocapsid, antagonist of IFN 9b 28130\u201328426 n/a 98. a quantitative assay for a typical positive interaction exemplified by nsp10\u2013nsp14 and various controls were shown. the co-expressed partner proteins interfered with the nsp10\u2013nsp14 interaction, leading to reduced reporter activity. the same proteins with different fusion domains competed with each other and impaired the specific interactions needed for activation. a typical interaction inhibition assay performed to confirm that the interaction was not resulted from self-activation. a typical interaction inhibition assay performed to confirm that the interaction was not resulted from self-activation. nsp11 is a small polypeptide containing only 13 amino acids. pET30a (His-tagged), pGEX-6P-1 (GST fusion) and pMAL-c2X (MBP fusion) proteins that were related to the interactions not reported previously were expressed in different bacterial systems. nsp12, nsp3.2 and nsp3.3 could not be confirmed. the proteins indicated on the left side of the vertical line were MBP fusions and that on the right are GST fusions with \u201c-\u201d indicating non-fused GST as negative control. the star signs indicate the expected bands for MBP-fusion proteins. luciferase activity assays of the reporter replicons. 2105 BHK21 cells were transfected with the three kinds of replicon plasmids (0.4 g each), respectively, and pRL-TK plasmid (0.1 g) as an internal control. luciferase activity assays were performed 24 h post transfection. the identity of the luciferase mRNA was sequenced. a low level of luciferase mRNA was generated either by cryptic promoters or by splicing of cryptic introns within the replicon transcripts in nucleus. to study the effect of SARS-CoV proteins on replication and transcription, individual viral proteins were co-expressed in trans with the replicon. nucleocapsid protein, nsp3 and RNA polymerase may possess a dominant function in trans. PL proteinase is involved in important cis functions like cis-processing of the large viral polyprotein. 2105 cells were transfected with pBAC- Rep-SCV-luc/neo. 2105 BHK21 cells were transfected with pRL-TK plasmid (0.1 g) and pBAC-Rep-SCV-luc/neo (0.4 g) after transfection, the cells were harvested for luciferase assays at different time points (6 h to 72 h) ratios of luciferase activities with and without co-expression of N protein at different time points post transfection were shown in Fig. 5C. the ratios became lower step by step from over 50 times at 16 h post transfection to around 4 times at 38 h post transfection. corresponding ratios for nsp3.2, nsp3.1 and nsp12 were also investigated. all the primers used for amplification were designed by inserting appropriate restriction sites which could be used for subcloning all the fragments from pGEM-T cloning vectors into mammalian two-hybrid vectors pM (bait) and pVP16 (prey) and other protein expression vectors in correct reading frames. 82 13 nsp12 13372\u201316166 S4370-Q5301 932 RdRp nsp13 16167\u201317969 A5302-Q5902 601 Hel, NTPase nsp14 17970\u201319550 A5903-Q6429 527 ExoN nsp15 19551\u201320588 S6430-Q6775 346 XendoU nsp16 20589\u201321482 A67 in total, 1024 interactions between all SARS-CoV proteins were examined in a pairwise matrix. as a result, 40 different interactions were detected using the mammalian two-hybrid assays. a quantitative assay for a typical positive interaction exemplified by nsp10\u2013nsp14. interactions of SARS-CoV detected by mammalian two-hybrid assays. grey squares indicate the novel interactions detected in this work. black squares represent interactions which have also been reported previously. self-interactions of nsp3, nsp5, nsp8, nsp15 and N were observed. these proteins could form dimeric or multimeric complexes by interacting with themselves. one interaction between non-structural protein nsp16 and structural protein N was detected. these interactions could have a minor effect on modulating virus replication. the two test proteins were fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST) and maltose-binding protein (MBP), respectively. the protein mixture was pulled down with glutathione-Sepharose that binds GST and GST fusion proteins. for every assay, GST protein was used as a negative control. the effects of individual proteins or protein domains provided in trans on the replication/transcription of the replicon were evaluated. any effect of the protein provided in trans on the luciferase expression levels could in principle be due either to changes in the extent of the replication, the transcription, or a combination of both. the luciferase gene is located in the 3\u2032-end of the genome. it can only be expressed from subgenomic RNAs but not from the viral genome. expression of luciferase was expected to reflect the genome replication and transcription of SARS-CoV replicon. individual viral proteins were co-expressed in trans with the SARS-CoV replicon. nsp3.1 containing X and SUD domains increased the luciferase activity. nsp3.2 containing the papain-like (PL) proteinase domain reduced the viral replication and transcription. the luciferase activity was measured 24 h post transfection. luciferase activity was detected 13 h post transfection. the highest value of activity was reached around 32 h post transfection. the cells were harvested for luciferase assays at different time points (6 h to 38 h) the ratios of luciferase activities of Rep-SCV-luc/neo in presence of N protein related to that in absence of N protein. luciferase activity became detectable at 7 h post transfection. a mammalian two-hybrid system was used to determine the genome-wide matrix-based protein-protein interactions of SARS-CoV. in total, 40 different interactions for 28 predicted mature proteins were observed, and most of them have not been previously reported. this is the first genome-wide protein-protein analyses for an intact viral ORFeome by using mammalian two-hybrid system. there are 9 pairs of interactions found in our work that are overlapping with that of von Brunn et al. they are nsp5 with nsp5, nsp7 and nsp8, nsp7 with nsp7, nsp8 and nsp9, nsp8 with nsp8, nsp9 and 9b. mammalian two-hybrid system may provide more reliable assays for detecting human viral protein interactions. overlapping interactions of different systems may generate false positive and false negative interactions. overlapping interactions of different systems may be complementary to each other. interactions between 3b with nsp8, nsp12, nsp13 or nsp14 were confirmed by pull-down assays. previous studies showed deletions of ORFs 3b, 7b, 8b and 9b did not significantly influence the level of viral RNA and replication efficiency in cell culture and mouse models. sp10 could play an important role in the formation of replication complex bound to RNA. nsp11 was predicted to be small polypeptide with 13 amino acids. nsp11 could act as a cofactor for nsp10 and the predicted cleavage site between nsp10 and nsp16 may be inefficient in vivo. however, such speculation needs to be confirmed by further investigations. nsp3 was found to associate with itself, nsp4 and nsp12 in this work. nsp3.1 covers domains predicted for adenosine diphosphate-ribose 1\u2032\u2032-phosphatase [12] and methyltransferase [35] could enhance the reporter activity. nsp3.2 was found to associate with itself, nsp4 and nsp12 in this work. the intraviral protein interactions identified in this study could serve as a basis for further studies of viral protein functions and molecular mechanisms of the genome replication/transcription processes of coronaviruses. cDNAs encoding individual SARS-CoV ORFs were generated and described in our previous work. the sequences of positive clones examined by restriction and PCR analyses were confirmed by DNA sequencing on ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) and CEQTM 8000 Sequencer (Beckman Coulter) the sequences were cut from pGEM-T constructs with appropriate restriction enzymes and cloned into the mammalian two-hybrid vectors pM and pVP16 (Clontech) 293T cells were seeded in 24-well plate with 1105 cells per well. on the following day, the DNA of specified amount and 2.5 l of 2.5 M CaCl2 were diluted with deionized H2O to reach a final volume of 25 l. 25 l of 2HBS solution was added dropwise to the cell culture medium. the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. the resin of glutathione-Sepharose was precipitated by brief spin. the resin was re-suspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. reporter replicon construct pBAC-Rep-SCV-luc/neo. reagents for PCR were 0.2 M dNTPs, 0.4 M forward and reverse primers. PCR fragments were cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) after agarose gel electrophoresis. pG5-luc was reconstructed from pG5CAT (Promega) by replacing chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene with luciferase gene sequence. 293T cells were seeded in 24-well plate with 1105 cells per well. one day before transfection, the DNA of specified amount and 2.5 l of 2.5 M CaCl2 were diluted with deionized H2O. the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. the resin of glutathione-Sepharose was precipitated by brief spin and washed by PBS at least for 5 times. the luciferase-neomycin gene sequence was fused with and controlled by the transcription regulation sequence (TRS) of SARS-CoV M gene. the fused sequence containing TRS/M-luciferase-neomycin cassette was inserted between AscI and BamHI sites in pBAC-SARS-CoV-REP."}
