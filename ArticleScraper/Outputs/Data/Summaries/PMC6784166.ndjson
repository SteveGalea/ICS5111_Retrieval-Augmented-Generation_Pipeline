{"summary": "there are currently six known, genetically distinct, species of Ebolavirus. EBOV is categorized among the deadliest viruses, with mortality rates up to 90%. the 2013\u20132016 outbreak is the largest (both by number of cases and geographical extension) ebolavirus outbreak ever reported. despite almost 40 years of research, filovirus transmission remains incompletely understood. in humans, EBOV has been found in a variety of body fluids, including blood, stool, breast milk, semen, urine, and saliva. defining the modes of transmission would greatly increase the ability of public health structures to limit the disease. the airway epithelium of the respiratory system is central to the defense of the lung against pathogens. despite these defense mechanisms, viruses have found ways to evade the immune system. despite these defense mechanisms, viruses have found ways to evade the immune system. EBOV infection is acquired through direct contact with bodily fluids. virus enters blood circulation through breaks in the skin and mucosa and spread to different organs, causing systemic manifestation of cardiovascular, coagulation, or inflammatory disturbances. EBOV in vitro infection of monocytes and macrophages triggers the robust expression of inflammatory mediators. dysregulation of immune mediators in humans has been associated with the secretion of other inflammatory mediators. inflammatory cytokines/chemokines may spill over into the circulation. ebola Virus Disease EVD is a viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) characterized by acute systemic manifestations with vascular damage, plasma leakage, severe inflammation, and disruption of the immune system. a high-level of EBOV replication, associated with systemic dissemination to multiple cell types, results in a complex pathogenesis, which is linked to an increased risk of infection transmission. a key question to ask is whether primary pulmonary infection of EBOV could be a potential scenario for the future. a fair amount of studies, based on animal experiments (Table 1) suggest that pulmonary infection may be a possibility. this possibility will be fully investigated below. pigs RESTV (co-infection with PRRSV, China) Spleen Natural infection Positive for RESTV RT-PCR Typical clinical signs of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome Pan Y, et al. an increase in respiratory rate as well as difficult abdominal breathing, inappetence, weakness and reluctance to move. an increase in respiratory rate as well as difficult, abdominal breathing, inappetence, weakness and reluctance to move. in 208 deceased patients, 18% in 34 serogically confirmed patients Clinical evidence WHO.

RESTV was detected in domestic swine in the Philippines in a co-infection with the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV, family Arteriviridae, genus Arterivirus) and Porcine Circovirus type 2 (PCV-2; family Circoviridae) the virus was first isolated in lung and lymphoid tissues in the original disease investigation. RESTV has not been seen to result in any human disease, even if there is concern that its passage through swine may allow RESTV to diverge and shift its potential for pathogenicity. researchers reviewed the different animal models and offered an overview regarding the possibilities of Ebola viruses causing aerosol infections in non-human primates. viral antigens were detected within alveolar and septal macrophages, pneumocytes, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and other interstitial cells of the respiratory tree. guinea pigs exposed via aerosols to a guinea pig-adapted EBOV strain showed infection signs. autopsies were performed on a limited number of humans (about 30 cases), primarily during the 1976 SUDV and 1995 EBOV EVD outbreaks. a possible pathogenetic role of the virus in the respiratory tract was suggested by the fact that viral inclusions within alveolar macrophages and free viral particles within alveolar space were found in the lungs. cough and dyspnoea were present at admission in seven (30%) and five (22%) EVD patients. 14 patients (52%) experienced hypoxemia while they were breathing ambient air. 12 patients (44%) had pulmonary oedema, 12 patients (26%) had pneumonia, 39 patients (33%) had respiratory failure, and six patients (22%) had a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) negative and positive sense RNAs: neg-RNA and pos-RNA, respectively, suggest that EBOV may replicate in the lungs for up to five days after the EBOV viral load in blood was already undetectable. however, the detection of pos-RNA together with neg-RNA in the sputum supports the concept of active viral replication within the respiratory tract. there could be multiple contributing factors, including vascular leak from endothelial infection. the risk of infection via inhalation of contaminated aerosols from exposed individuals has not been documented. droplets containing EBOV that have become aerosolized may have the potential to come into contact with a person\u2019s mucous membrane in their nose or mouth. RESTV was detected in domestic swine in the Philippines in a co-infection with the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus. RESTV was identified to cause asymptomatic infections with mild respiratory symptoms. the virus was first isolated in lung and lymphoid tissues in the original disease investigation. the massive presence of the virus in the lungs may be due to the fact that RESTV infection in pigs has been mostly associated with other infections of the respiratory tract. experimental studies analyzed the respiratory tract involvement in filovirus infections when the animals were exposed to the virus through different aerosol routes. piglets inoculated oro-nasally with EBOV and then transferred to a different room housing macaques in an open inaccessible cage system resulted in EBOV infection of all macaques. viral antigens were detected within alveolar and septal macrophages, pneumocytes, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and other interstitial cells of the respiratory tree. a guinea pig-adapted EBOV strain is commonly caused by aerogenous viral infections. the pathophysiological mechanism of pulmonary disease in patients with EVD is unknown. a study of 27 EBOV-positive patients of the 2013\u20132016 outbreak in Western Africa found that cough and dyspnoea were present at admission in seven (30%) and five (22%) EVD patients. at symptom onset, only a cough was reported in one patient. 14 patients (52%) experienced hypoxemia while they were breathing ambient air. four patients (15%) received non-invasive mechanical ventilation. seven patients (26%) received invasive mechanical ventilation. the first EBOV-positive patient treated in Italy had high levels of EBOV RNA. the pathophysiological mechanisms of pulmonary disease in patients with EVD are still uncertain. there could be multiple contributing factors, including vascular leak from endothelial infection, cytokine dysregulation, or direct damage to EBOV-infected cells. the number of past outbreaks and associated epidemiological studies hat carefully examine transmission patterns is small. the risk of infection via inhalation of contaminated aerosols from exposed individuals has not been documented. however, droplets containing EBOV that have become aerosolized may have the potential to come into contact with a person\u2019s mucous membrane in their nose or mouth or non-intact skin. epidemiologic and viral evidence of EBOV detection and replication in the respiratory tract raise concerns on the need of strict application of cough etiquette for patients. herpesviridae Cytomegalovirus Cytomegalovirus Interstitial pneumonitis, Intra-alveolar damage, DAD, Cytomegaly, Eosinophilic intranuclear Cowdry type-B inclusions Bronchiolitis, Pneumonia * Falsey AR et al., Semin Respir Crit Care Med. 2007 [86], Pierangeli A Minerva Pediatr. 2018 [87] Flaviviridae Flavivirus Yellow fever virus Dengue virus Alveolar oedema, Interstitila pneumonitis, DAD, DAH # Pneumonia Paessler S Annu Rev Pathol. 2007 [92] Arenaviridae Arenavirus Lassa virus Machupo Virus Guanarito Virus Alveolar oedema. EBOV may be able to cause primary pulmonary infection. there is no evidence of aerosol transmission in EVD. there is no evidence of aerosol transmission in EVD. respiratory symptoms were present in both patients, in the absence of other common respiratory pathogens. one case required mechanical ventilation and the other presented EBOV replication markers in the lungs. the INMI experience suggests a direct role of the virus in lung pathogenesis."}
