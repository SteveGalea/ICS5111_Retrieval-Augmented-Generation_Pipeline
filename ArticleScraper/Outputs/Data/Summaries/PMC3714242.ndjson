{"summary": "as of July 12th 2013, 81 cases of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have been confirmed worldwide. 1, 2 Among confirmed infections, MERS has a mortality rate exceeding 50%. 3, 4, 5, 6 appears to cause more severe disease in individuals with underlying medical comorbidities. 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 has demonstrated its potential for community and hospital based human-to-human transmission. IATA captures 93% of the world\u2019s commercial air traffic data. each flight itinerary encompassed data on the city where each traveler initiated their trip along with all connecting flights en route to their final destination. all confirmed MERS-CoV cases in international travelers have been linked back to these four countries. a large proportion of foreign Hajj pilgrims travel to and from Saudi Arabia via unscheduled charter flights. we multiplied the total number of foreign Hajj pilgrims in 2012 13 by the proportions of pilgrims originating from individual countries. we then compared these values with the world bank economic classifications of countries and estimates of national healthcare expenditures per capita 18 as simplified, albeit imperfect surrogate markers. 3% upper-middle income, 7.6% high income. 60.7% of foreign pilgrims originated from just eight countries. estimated number of foreign pilgrims performing the Hajj in 2012. assuming the same number of foreign pilgrims in 2013 compared with 2012 World Bank 2011 World Bank 2013. assuming the same number of foreign pilgrims in 2013 compared with 2012 World Bank 2011 World Bank 2013. 921 $101 Ukraine 56,163 177 $263 Uzbekistan 20,494 5,625 $88 Djibouti 15,334 1,369 $105 Viet Nam 12,512 No Data $95 Ghana 11,939 2,580 $75 Armenia 11,775 No Data $142 Senegal 11,348 8,139 $67 Georgia 10,802 5,587 $328 South Sudan 5,441 No Data** $32 Cote D'Ivoire 4,148 3,786 $79 Cameroon the destinations of international travelers departing Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar and UAE have shown a consistent seasonal pattern from 2007-2012. our findings suggest that India, Egypt, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, Kuwait, Bangladesh, Iran and Bahrain will likely account for more than half of the world\u2019s air traffic out of the aforementioned Middle Eastern countries. two-thirds of all hajj pilgrims will be returning to low or lower-middle income countries where medical and public health capacity will be limited. rigorous efforts in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East are ongoing to identify the presumed animal origins of this novel human coronavirus. a study evaluating the evidence for traveler health screening worldwide during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic indicated that the effectiveness of screening can vary depending upon a number of factors related and unrelated to the pathogen of interest. this study indicated that for a pathogen such as MERS-CoV with a median incubation period of 5 days and an upper limit of 14 days, 2, 10 effective exit screening would preclude the need for entry screening elsewhere in the world. gastrointestinal symptoms may lead clinicians down alternate diagnostic pathways. 2, 3, 4 Among returning Hajj pilgrims, undifferentiated respiratory infections are common27, 29, 30, 31, 32. there are significant practical challenges to rapidly establishing MERS-CoV diagnostic capacity at a global level, especially in high-risk, resource poor countries. we categorized countries by their world bank economic status and per capita healthcare expenditures as crude surrogate markers of their ability to detect MERS-CoV in a timely manner. we produced tabular information at a national level to enable the integration other potential indicators of interest. the four countries with confirmed cases in returning travelers account for an estimated 7.1% of the final destinations of all international travelers departing the source countries since September 2012. the emergence of MERS-CoV requires an internationally coordinated effort to mitigate its potential global health and economic consequences. understanding the most probable pathways for international spread of MERS-CoV could help medical and public health providers worldwide operate in a far more anticipatory and less reactive manner than occurred during SARS."}
