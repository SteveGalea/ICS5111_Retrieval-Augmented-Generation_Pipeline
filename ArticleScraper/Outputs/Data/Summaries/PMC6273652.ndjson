{"summary": "inflammation is an innate immune response by various immune cells, such as macrophages, to protect against harmful stimuli. dsRNA induces the production of inflammatory mediators, such as NO, interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- in macrophages. dsRNA activates nuclear factor kappa beta and the calcium signaling pathway. quercetin lowered levels of IL-1, C-reactive protein, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in a rat model of adjuvant arthritis. recently, Chiow et al. have reported that quercetin could inhibit both mouse hepatitis virus and dengue virus (type 2) [13] the results show that quercetin significantly inhibited excessive production of NO in the cells at concentrations of 5, 10, 25, and 50 M. the inhibitory effect of 50 M quercetin stronger than that at 5 and 10 M was chosen for the multiplex cytokine assay. quercetin inhibited calcium release from poly(I:C)-induced RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages at concentrations of 5, 10, 25, and 50 M. no significant association was found between quercetin concentration and intracellular calcium level. ulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in dsRNA-induced RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages. effect of quercetin on production of cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6 (A); tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- (B) dsRNA-induced RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages were incubated with molecules for 18 h. the cells were incubated with poly(I:C) and/or quercetin for 18 h. the results show that quercetin significantly inhibited STAT1 and STAT3 mRNA expression. dsRNA-induced RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages were incubated with poly(I:C) and/or quercetin for 24 h. 100 L of supernatant from each well was mixed with 100 L Griess reagent. no association was found between quercetin concentration and NO level. significant differences were examined using one-way analysis of variance test. calcium release from RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages can be determined by the Fluo-4 assay. quercetin significantly reduced excess production of IL-6, TNF-, MCP-1, interferon gamma-induced protein-10 (IP-10) regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), lipopolysaccharide-induced CXC chemokine (LIX), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and vascular endothelial growth quercetin significantly inhibited STAT1 and STAT3 mRNA expression in poly(I:C)-induced RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages at concentrations of 25 and 50 M. quercetin significantly inhibited STAT1 and STAT3 mRNA expression. the normal group (Nor) was treated with media only. the control group (Con) was treated with 50 g/mL of the dsRNA synthetic analog polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) macrophages and monocytes are of great importance for normal host defense. recruitment of macrophages to specific sites is important for normal host defense. NO is a membrane-permeable signaling molecule involved in a broad array of biologic processes. dysregulation of NO has been implicated in pathogenesis of many disorders. quercetin may alleviate poly(I:C)-induced inflammation by decreasing levels of inflammatory mediators, such as NO, cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, in RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages. quercetin may modulate poly(I:C)-induced inflammation by decreasing levels of inflammatory mediators, such as NO, cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. quercetin has anti-inflammatory effects related to inhibiting NO, IL-6, TNF-, MCP-1, IP-10, RANTES, LIF, LIX, G-CSF, GM-CSF, and VEGF production in poly(I:C)-induced macrophages. further study is needed to evaluate the clinical utility of quercetin for viral inflammation. cDNA was synthesized from 1 g total RNA using the iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) cDNA was synthesized from 1 g total RNA using the iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) the GAPDH gene was used for RNA normalization. 96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). a correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between quercetin concentration and the levels of NO and/or intracellular calcium. a p-value 0.05 was considered significant. 100 L of supernatant from each well was mixed with 100 L Griess reagent. the cells were incubated with poly(I:C) and/or quercetin for 24 h. after 15 min incubation, optical density was determined at 540 nm. RNA quantity and quality were confirmed using the NucleoSpin RNA kit. cDNA was synthesized from 1 g total RNA using the iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) the GAPDH gene was used for RNA normalization. way analysis followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison test with SPSS 11.0 software. a correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between quercetin concentration and the levels of intracellular calcium."}
