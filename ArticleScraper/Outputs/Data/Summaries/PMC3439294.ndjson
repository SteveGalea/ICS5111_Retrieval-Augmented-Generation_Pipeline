{"summary": "150 plant extracts with nutritional applications were screened in vitro. one extract (Aspalathus linearis) was also tested for its effect on the loss of transepithelial resistance (TER) of Caco-2 cells caused by simian rotavirus (SA-11) infection. R.Dahlgren, Urtica dioica L., Glycyrrhiza glabra L. and Olea europaea L. may be useful in the treatment of diarrhea caused by rotavirus infection. rotavirus is still one of the leading causes of severe dehydrating diarrhea in children under the age of five. clinical trials are being undertaken and early results found that the vaccine significantly reduces severe diarrhea episodes due to rotavirus. rotavirus vaccines are expensive and may not be affordable for the developing world at present, compromising full vaccine coverage. many natural compounds have known antirotavirus effects in clinical studies [7-9], in animal experiments [10] and in vitro[11-14]. the results of 150 aqueous plant extracts on their antiviral action against rotavirus are presented in a search for novel agents for the treatment of human diarrhea caused by rotavirus infection. the viruses selected were the simian rotavirus SA-11 strain (ATCC) and the rhesus rotavirus strain (RRV) 150 plant extracts were selected from an \u2018in house\u2019 herbal extract collection. all plant extracts were tested as a first screening in an antiviral titration assay with MA104 cells in the concentrations of 400 and 500 g/ml in medium. extracts that reduced the rotavirus infection were appointed an arbitrary IC50 of 1000 g/ml. infection of MA104 cells with rotavirus induces syncytium after 3-4 days. a titration of RRV on MA104 was used as a measure of maximum infection. maximum of infection and each concentration of the plant extract were tested in duplicate. the background reading of a control filter was measured in every experiment. all measurements were done at various time points post infection. the permeability of Caco-2 cell monolayer was also determined by measuring the paracellular passage of HRP or FITC-dextran. the viruses were grown in MA104 cells and concentrated by ultracentrifugation. the titers were determined using a titration assay. a 50% cell culture infective dose (CCID50) of 1x108 of both SA-11 and RRV. 18\u00df-glycyrrhetinic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) was tested in the concentrations of 10-20-30-40-50-50-100 M in medium. combination a mixture was of the IC25 concentration of both extracts. the caco-2 cells were apically infected with an inoculum of activated rotavirus (1*106 CCID50) in the presence of the extract. the integrity of the confluent polarized monolayer was checked by measuring TER with a volt-ohmmeter. X-values (i.e. dosage) corresponding to the maximum y-value divided by 2, are calculated from the mathematical regression curve formula. the hyperimmune colostrum (HIC) is used as a positive control. the concentration of 1 g/ml showed an inhibition of infection with 50% compared to the maximum infection with RRV. the decline in TER of Caco-2 cells by SA-11 and the effect of the HIC (100 g/ml) on the TER during SA-11 infection is depicted in Figure 1B. 11 extracts strongly inhibited the rotavirus infection of MA104 cells with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) 300 g/ml. five strong (IC50 300 g/ml) and eleven moderate (IC50 between 300 and 550 g/ml) inhibitory plant extracts. only four compounds showed an inhibitory effect. 18\u00df-glycyrrhetinic acid from Glycyrrhiza glabra was found to have the strongest antiviral activity. no positive effect on the maintenance of the TER was measured. Urtica dioica L. (230 g/ml) inhibited infection with 57%. Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. (150 g/ml) showed inhibition of 86% of the infection. bars represent average of triplicate values + SD. the black line depicts the cell control with no infection but in the presence of HIC (100 g/ml) the effect of two rotavirus strains on the transepithelial resistance (TER) with Caco-2 cells was first determined. only the SA-11 rotavirus strain, and not RRV, showed a decrease in TER. the most potent extract of each plant together with eleven moderate (IC50 between 300 and 550 g/ml) inhibitors of rotavirus infection are depicted in Figure 3. no positive effect on the maintenance of the TER was measured. the combined action of two or more extracts is greater than the sum of the individual effects of each extract. a combination of the IC25 showed an inhibition of 89% of the infection. the 150 plant extracts used in the screening here were selected because of their known nutritional uses. the nutritional applications and antiviral activities of the five strongest rotavirus inhibitors are discussed. the root extract is used as flavoring in sweets, baked goods, ice cream and soft drinks. Olea europeae fruit (olive) exhibits antiviral activity against viral haemorrhagic septicaemia rhabdovirus (VHSV) for these nutritional ingredients we have demonstrated antirotavirus activity in vitro. only 4 compounds showed antiviral activity against rotavirus in the antiviral titration assay. luteolin, vitexin and apigenin 7-O-glucoside have antiviral activity in vitro. this is a first step in a potential wider, more pharmacological use of these nutritional ingredients. this is a potential wider, more pharmacological use of these nutritional ingredients. natural extracts were tested for their antiviral capacity. a crude extract reaching the IC50 of 0.3 mg/ml was regarded as a strong inhibitor. a titration assay using MA104-cells has proven to be a useful assay. but assessment of TER did not reveal inhibitory compounds. extracts of Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn., Aspalathus linearis and Olea europaea L. have in vitro antiviral activity against rotavirus. none of these plants have been reported before as having antiviral action against rotaviruses. was performed within the frame work of TIpharma project D1-101."}
