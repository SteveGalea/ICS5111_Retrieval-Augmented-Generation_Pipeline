{"summary": "influenza has been described to be one of the most important causes for hospitalization of children with an ARI. acute respiratory infection (ARI) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Cambodia [1]. influenza has been described to be one of the most important causes for hospitalization of children with an ARI. antigenic sites are five somewhat overlapping regions. 11 antigenic clusters emerged during the 35-year period following the introduction of the A/H3N2 virus in humans in 1968. no data existed about circulating influenza strains along the Thai-Cambodia border. a subset of outpatients presenting with influenza-like-illness (ILI) at four sentinel sites-located in five health centers and hospitals in battambang, Oddar Meanchey, Pailin and Banteay Meanchey provinces in Cambodia. a cross-section of data distributed over time and space was collected. patients who met the case definition for ILI defined as persons of 1 year of age or older, arriving at the health center or hospital within 5 days of fever onset with a fever (axillary 38.1\u00b0C or oral 38.6\u00b0C) and cough or sore throat in the absence of other diagnoses. Demographic data included gender, occupation, presenting signs and symptoms, self-reported influenza vaccination history, medication use and travel within the last 7-days. influenza virus RNA was extracted from 140 l of each combined nasal and throat specimen using Qiagen Viral RNA mini kits. samples positive for influenza A and/or B were further tested to confirm influenza A and/or B positivity and to determine influenza A subtypes. initial reverse transcription at 50\u00b0C for 30 min followed by denaturation and PCR activation by Taq inhibitor activator at 95\u00b0C for 2 min and 45 cycles of PCR amplification. after influenza typing by rRT-PCR, two 500 l aliquots of every influenza-positive specimen was transferred into cryogenic vials for transport in liquid nitrogen to IPC in Phnom Penh. outliers of more than 2 standard deviations from the overall mean were retested twice. the typical range of IC50 was calculated as the mean IC50 3 standard deviations using a panel of well-characterized reference strains. ML phylogenies were annotated using MEGA version 5 and FigTree version 1.4.0 [23]. all influenza sequences used in analysis have been deposited into Genbank. a covering nucleotides 22\u20131683 of the HA gene. b Covering nucleotides 97\u20131396 of the NA gene. c As determined by jmodeltest2 version 2.1.4. PCR-products positive for enterovirus or rhinovirus were sequenced for nucleotide analysis. other specific for enterovirus 71 (EV71) detection included single-step first-round RT-PCR and semi-nested PCR. single-step first-round RT-PCR was performed in following mix: 5 l RNA suspension, 5 l of 10x PCR buffer II supplied with AmliTaqTM DNA polymerase. the reverse transcription step was performed at 42\u00b0C for 60 min, followed by 35 cycles of thermocycling 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 50\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds. the RT step was performed at 42\u00b0C for 60 min, followed by 35 cycles of thermocycling 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 50\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. the reaction was further incubated at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. a negative control of RNA-free water and a positive control of cDNA template from the EV71 reference strain were included in each experiment. study was approved by AFRIMS in Thailand, the Institutional Review Boards at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) in the united states and the national ethics committee for health research (NEHCR) in Cambodia. written informed consent was obtained from volunteers or parents or legal guardians of children enrolled in the study. 5 to 10 ILI specimens were collected each week (Monday to Friday) for 52 weeks per year. largely from the first two subjects meeting the predefined inclusion criteria. demographic data included gender, occupation, presenting signs and symptoms, self-reported influenza vaccination history, medication use and travel within the last 7 days. influenza RNA was extracted from 140 l of each combined nasal and throat specimen using Qiagen Viral RNA mini kits. samples positive for influenza A and/or B were further tested to confirm influenza A and/or B positivity and to determine influenza A subtype pH1 detection. thermocycling reaction conditions for influenza typing were as follows: initial reverse transcription at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by denaturation and PCR activation by Taq inhibitor activator at 95\u00b0C for 2 min and 45 cycles of PCR amplification. after influenza typing by rRT-PCR, two 500 l aliquots of every influenza-positive specimen was transferred into cryogenic vials for transport in liquid nitrogen to IPC. the concentration of drug required to inhibit 50% of the NA activity (IC50) was calculated using the non-linear curve-fitting function in the Graphpad Prism 4 package. the average IC50 (nM) (standard deviation) of two independent determinations was calculated for each virus. outliers of more than 2 standard deviations from the overall mean were retested twice. Sequences for pH1N1 and H3N2 sequence datasets respectively were combined with references available from the Influenza Viral Resource at Genbank [17] and the GISAID EpiFlu database [18] representing global diversity of pH1N1 from 2009\u20132013. best models were determined from alignments using jmodeltest2 version 2.1.4 [21] ML phylogenies were annotated using MEGA version 5 and FigTree version 1.4.0 [23] d H3N2 HA Full 10 2 1 1 5 1 0 0 0 103 GTR+G+I 8028.8 H3N2 NA Full 10 2 1 1 5 1 0 0 0 103 GTR+G 4569.2 H3N2 MP Full 10 2 1 1 5 1 0 0 0 122 GTR+G 3156.4 H3N2 NS Full 10 2 1 1 5 1 0 0 0 122 GTR+G polio enteroviruses in children less than 5 years old were tested by two separate nested RT-PCR methods.

Cambodia were almost exclusively seen in the rainy season (June to November), with almost no influenza detected in the dry seasons (December to May) no human influenza A/H5N1 cases were detected. all IC50-values of influenza A and B isolates tested from 2011 were within the susceptible range for both oseltamivir and zanamivir. all IC50-values of influenza A and B isolates tested from 2011 were within the susceptible range for both oseltamivir and zanamivir. at least 1 respiratory virus was detected in 258 out of 586 (44%) ILI-specimens. most were influenza (168, 29% of ILI-cases), followed by rhinovirus (33, 6%), adenovirus (24, 4%), non-polio enterovirus (17, 3%) and parainfluenza virus (PIV (16,3%). the 528 bases obtained from sequencing were found to be 99% identical to the Enterovirus A71/Homo sapiens/VNM/208/2011 strain. 131 bases were obtained when the 227 bp PCR product obtained from EV71 nested RT-PCR was sequenced using the EV71 inner primers. no evidence for amino acid substitutions leading to changes in glycosylation was seen in the HA dataset. for the NA gene, several amino acid substitutions resulted in addition/loss of glycosylation sites. for the MP gene,

Victoria 2011 vaccine clusters. unique sample that did not fall within vaccine clades highlighted in yellow with percent nucleotide identity indicated in bottom right table. at least 1 respiratory virus was detected in 258 out of 586 (44%) ILI-specimens collected between May 2010 and December 2012. a single specimen was found to be negative during the first round of RT-PCR but positive by second round pan-EV/RV and EV71 nested RT-PCR. the 528 bases obtained from sequencing were found to be 99% identical to the Enterovirus A71/Homo sapiens/VNM/208/2011 strain. a total of 50 (17 EV and 33 RV) positive samples were highly related. no more than 1.67% divergence between the strains detected in the study and respective seed viruses included in the vaccine composition. all Cambodian viruses on average had 11 amino acid changes within the HA segment. selection pressure was determined using the dN/dS statistic. values of dN/dS > 1 are indicative of positive or adaptive selection. values 1 are indicative of purifying or negative selection. a value = 1 indicates neutral or no selection ongoing. n = 10 NA K258E, T329N G401S (1) D151N (1), D402N (1) BTB: Battambang, OM: Oddar

contained the most amino acid substitutions. there were several amino acid substitutions within the HA amino acid analysis that were unique relative to the global sequences. seasonal influenza virus was most commonly detected respiratory virus in this predominantly pediatric population of subjects who presented with ILI. despite detection of human highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in western Cambodia since early 2011 [36\u201338], H5N1 was not found at our sentinel sites. valent seasonal vaccine in 2009, 2010 and 2011 in the private sector. if vaccination is to be implemented, the quadrivalent influenza vaccine that contains the two influenza B lineages may be more suitable. all strains we detected were susceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors. single amino acid substitutions occurred at only seven out of 131 possible amino acid positions in HA at antigenic sites immediately adjacent to the receptor binding site (RBS) these substitutions were located in antigenic sites A (position 145) and B (positions 155, 156, 158, 159, 189, and 193), with none in sites C, D, or E. culture yield was low in our dataset (10%) with isolation of only adenovirus and parainfluenza. previous work has shown presence of human coronavirus, human bocavirus, HMPV and RSV in Cambodia. however, the number of non-influenza viruses in our population is possibly underestimated. the most common enteroviruses found among children under 5 years old in our population were coxsackieviruses (7.3%) and echoviruses (3%) coxsackievirus A16 is known to cause either an atypical rash resembling eczema herpeticum or chickenpox. we did not have EV71 test results from specimens collected during the peak of the outbreak. but our data suggests that EV71 virus was not present in the border areas of western Cambodia before April 2012, the time that the first cases were found elsewhere in Cambodia. ope sites require further investigation in light of the increasingly important role of permissive mutations in the evolution of influenza virus. further research to clarify the burden of adenovirus and non-polio enteroviruses as etiologic agents in acute respiratory infections in Cambodia is needed. Vaccine strains are highlighted in red. node support was calculated with aLRT and was >0.70 for all major nodes. 2011 samples fell within the same clade and 2012 samples fell within a different clade. the primers for simultaneous detection of enteroviruses and rhinoviruses were designed in the polyprotein gene between 5\u2032 non-coding region (5\u2032NCR) and VP4/VP2 regions. EV/RV-2n was modified from primer 2-EV/RV [29] for using in nested PCR reaction. AA substitution nomenclature is as follows; reference amino acid (A/California/7/2009), amino acid site, sample amino acid. amino acids are numbered from the start codon of the segment (ATG:Methionine). pH1N1 sample amino acid substitution summary and selection analysis by group per segment analyzed.
