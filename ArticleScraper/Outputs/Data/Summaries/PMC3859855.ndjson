{"summary": "study aimed to identify association between social network characteristics and body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) in an elderly Korean population. network size is a count of the number of friends. average frequency of communication measures how often network members communicate (or meet) each other. evidence suggests emotions and related behaviors are also associated with social networks. obesity is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases [6]. 814 people responded to the social network survey (response rate 94.7%) potentially confounding factors were assessed as well. age, education, smoking status (never or ever smoker), alcohol drinking status (non-drinker or drinker), depression score (CES-D) and self-reported comorbidity (hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and arthritis) density of communication network (or density) is calculated as: node nj and nk represent the adjoined nodes connected to node ni and 'e' represents the number of adjoined nodes connected to ni. if node nj and nk are connected, d(nj, nk) becomes 1 and if not, it becomes 0.. drew a histogram and calculated the minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, maximum, and mean values. drew a histogram and calculated the minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile, maximum, and mean values. network size The egocentric network was composed of rosters A and B. p-values 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. communication frequency indicates how often network members communicated. the average frequency of meeting (or \"meeting frequency\") was likewise calculated to determine how often network members met. statistical tests were performed with SAS version 9.2 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA) all analyses were two-sided and p-values 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. RESULTS The characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table 1. the group of social network structure and the communication frequency as an index of network activation were further analyzed for the association with BMI in the men and women. after adjusting for age, education, smoking, alcohol drinking, depression score, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and arthritis. a study has linked unhealthy weight-control behaviors among adolescent girls to dieting behaviors of their peers. the men's BMI was more strongly associated with network structure than communication frequency as an index of network activation. we postulate a possible explanation for the association between social network structure and the men's BMI. studies have been mainly interested in the peer effect on obesity. this study could not establish a temporal relationship between BMI and social network characteristics. a low BMI can be an indicator of certain other chronic medical conditions. structure and activation (communication frequency and meeting frequency) are associated with obesity among the elderly. lower density of communication network and higher network size may be associated with higher BMI in men, while lower frequency of communication may be associated with higher BMI in women."}
