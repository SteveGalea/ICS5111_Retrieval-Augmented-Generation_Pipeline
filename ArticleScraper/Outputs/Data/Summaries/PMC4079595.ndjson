{"summary": "the virions of coronaviruses are enveloped, roughly spherical particles that possess a linear, nonsegmented, positive-sense RNA genome of up to 32 kb [2], [3], which is the largest genome among all known RNA viruses. the other four common and epidemic HCoVs are HCoV-229E (an Alphacoronavirus), HCoV-OC43 (a Betacoronavirus), HCoV HCoV-OC43 has a high frequency of mutation using both base substitution and homologous RNA recombination. spike (S) protein is used for receptor binding and viral entry. the spike (S) protein has the most variable sequence within the coronavirus genome [24]\u2013[27]. this is the first report of the molecular prevalence and genetic diversity of HCoV-OC43 variants among adult patients with ARI in Beijing. this is the first report of the molecular prevalence and genetic diversity of HCoV-OC43 variants among adult patients with ARI in Beijing. sopharyngeal swab specimens were retrieved from a QIAamp viral RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) to design primers for RT-PCR to detect HCoV-OC43, S and N gene sequences. all PCR products were run on agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide. most amplicons were purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit. Specimens positive for HCoV-OC43 were tested for coinfection with other respiratory viruses. nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from adult patients with acute respiratory tract infections. all patients over 14 years of age were selected to enroll according to criteria that included respiratory symptoms, body temperature above 37.5\u00b0C, and a normal or low leukocyte count (1010/L). al swab specimens using a QIAamp viral RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. to design primers for RT-PCR to detect HCoV-OC43, S and N gene sequences were retrieved from GenBank. all PCR products were run on agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide. most amplicons were purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (QIAGEN) Specimens positive for HCoV-OC43 were tested for coinfection with other respiratory viruses. HCoV-OC43 prevalence and coinfection Patients over 14 years old (range, 14\u201389 years; average, 33.43 years) were enrolled in this study. statistical analysis showed no significant difference in detection rates between the S- and N-targeting assays. coinfection with HCoV-OC43 was found in 25 patients (25/70; 35.71%; 95% CI: 24.49\u201346.93%) the predominant viruses found in coinfections with HCoV-OC43 were rhinovirus and flu A. logistic regression analysis showed that HCoV-OC43 infection was not specifically associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. only nasal stuffiness differed significantly between HCoV-OC43 positive and negative groups. seven HCoV-OC43 strains from Beijing (LY1, LY82, LY84, XH1316, XH1327, XH1400, and XH1444) along with five reference strains from genotype A belonged to Cluster B. nineteen clinical isolates from Beijing patients formed a novel unique cluster and showed high similarity with isolates from Japan (AB695079) and France (DQ355408). sequences of reference strains cut from partial S or N gene of HCoV-OC43 in GenBank. cluster A comprised only one clinical strain from Beijing patient (LY373) and four reference strains from genotype A.

HCoV-OC43 detection status Positive Number (%) Different targeting assays (from total 559 samples) Either S or N target detected 70 (12.52) Only S target detected 50 (3.58) Total Coinfection 25 (5.71) Coinfection with (from 70 samples) Rhinovirus 6 (8.57) Flu A 4 (5.71) Coxsackie virus 3 (4.29) HCoV-HKU1 2 (2.86) RSV 2 (2.86) hMPV 2 (2.86) Echovirus 2 logistic regression analysis showed that HCoV-OC43 infection was not specifically associated with gastrointestinal symptoms. only nasal stuffiness differed significantly between the HCoV-OC43 positive and negative groups. nasopharyngeal swabs of patients with ARI were amplified and sequenced. partial S gene from 50 amplicons from Beijing patients was compared with those from porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and 19 reference strains of HCoV-OC43 found in GenBank (Table S1 in File S1). logenetic analysis of partial S and partial N gene sequences of HCoV-OC43 isolates was performed with MEGA 5.05 using neighbour-joining. the outgroup comprised BCoV (AF391542) and PHEV (AY078417) AY391777) showed a characteristic four-amino-acid deletion at the same location (amino acids 263\u2013266) each other cluster also showed unique amino acid substitutions at different sites. similar cluster-specific markers were found among the partial N protein sequences of HCoV-OC43 isolates when amino acids were aligned.

Summary on consensus amino acid changes for each cluster among N coding region of HCoV-OC43. only few of 20 clinical variants belonged to same phylogenetic clusters based on either the S or N gene. phylogenetic tree analysis based on partial S or N gene sequences in this study showed the presence of at least three clusters (A, B, and C/D) in total, 50 amplicons from the S gene and 40 amplicons from the N gene of HCoV-OC43 isolates were sequenced. the HCoV-OC43 detection rate was enhanced significantly when the results from the two assays were combined. previous reports have shown that infection with HCoV-OC43 was more common amongst elderly persons [18], [34], [41] but the HCoV-OC43 detection rates were similar among the different age groups of adults enrolled in our study. partial S gene represents the major diagnostic antigen and more conserved transcripts of the HCoV infection. some of HCoV-OC43 isolates from our patients with ARI showed discrepancies between the S- and N-based phylogenetic trees. RNA recombination is an important mechanism for the natural evolution of coronaviruses. at least three distinct clusters (A, B, C/D) of HCoV-OC43 strains are circulating among adults with ARI in 2010. some novel unique clusters (UNT) of HCoV-OC43 was found."}
