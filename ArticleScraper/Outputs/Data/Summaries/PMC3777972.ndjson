{"summary": "circulating strains predominantly the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (70%) and unsubtyped influenza A, 5% and 3% respectively. in the pandemic year, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominated over other influenza viruses (95%) sporadic viruses were sub-typed as A/H3N2 and unsubtyped influenza A, 5% and 3%. virological surveillance of influenza provides a basis for selection of the virus strains to be included in the annual formulation of influenza vaccines [1]. the primary objective of this study was to develop or strengthen influenza sentinel surveillance systems in line with WHO standards in selected North African countries. in the past decade, information of epidemic strains from Tunisia was unknown due to lack of any systemic study. physicians sent specimens for influenza testing and basic demographic data from a subset of patients with ILI each year during October through May. the number of consultants is 10% above the total number of consultants in the sentinel centre. severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) related to influenza viruses has been added to existing outpatient surveillance systems. oro-pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs collected from same patient were placed in one cryovial, stored at 4\u00b0C at the sentinel site. samples taken from severe cases were from children and/or adult hospitalised in the care unit or patients hospitalized with severe acute respiratory infection were additionally tested for other respiratory viruses. samples were analysed for diagnostic purposes using the real time PCR CDC protocol [8] for detection of influenza viruses and using xTAG\u00ae Respiratory Viral Panel Fast (Abbott Molecular, Germany) all influenza positive samples were sub-typed using specific real-time PCRs for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A/H3N2 and for influenza B viruses. the nucleotide sequence data reported in this work were deposited in the GenBank nucleotide sequence data-base with accession numbers JN037697 to JN037779. influenza viruses peaked during 4 weeks 5\u20136\u20137\u20138/09 (January 27th, 2009 and 24 February, 2009) and concerned 67.7% of cases. the number of influenza viruses declined to baseline levels in 28 April 2009 (0%) in 2009\u20132010 pandemic, the first case of pandemic influenza in the country was laboratory confirmed on 18 June 2009. four confirmed cases were identified in June, but in late July and August (week 28 to 35) a decrease was observed in week 40 in the number of respiratory samples collected. influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, followed by influenza B, have been the predominant influenza viruses circulating in the community through the entire season. a prolonged tail to the season was noted, as indicated by continued swab positivity for influenza B. the curve of cases of influenza viruses spread out over 11 weeks (from Wk 1 to Wk 11) influenza activity in Tunisia in 2010\u20132011 reached a level higher than that seen in the winter of the 2008\u20132009 season, but lower than during the first wave of the pandemic in the summer of 2009. the percentage of consultants in the sentinel centres in Tunisia in 2010\u20132011 season was lower (8.3%) than the percentage of consultants in the next year of the pandemic. a total of 3865 out of 7350 respiratory specimens were positive for influenza. of those positive specimens, 3836 were sub-typed as influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (95%), influenza B virus 8 (0.1%) and influenza A/H3N2 (4.28% were influenza A unknown subtype) influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza type B continue to predominate among circulating influenza viruses in Tunisia. a noticeable difference from the 2009\u20132010 season has been the relatively high proportion of type B viruses among circulating influenza viruses. in season 2008\u20132009, 2009\u20132010 and 2010\u20132011, other respiratory viruses were identified among sentinel specimens negative for influenza viruses. a total of 27 HA genes of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were sequenced and analysed resulting into three groups. a total of 27 HA genes of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses regardless of whether they were from 2011 from mild, severe cases and from influenza cases admitted to intensive care units were also sequenced. the tree was rooted with the vaccine strain A/California/07/2009 (boxed) as outgroup. signature amino acid changes (H1 numbering) are annotated at the nodes of each cluster. additional substitutions in position 222 of HA gene were found in 4 Tunisian sequences out of 50 viruses (8%) most of viruses with this mutation were found in severe cases (2/3), one from a fatal case [21]. four of the representative strains from Tunisia, isolated in 2011 clustered with B/Victoria/2/87-the oldest strain of Victoria lineage (23.5%). the strains of the Yamagata lineage predominated (13/17; 76%) over those of the Victoria lineage (4%). influenza viruses were isolated from week 45/08 (fin August, 2008) to week 16/09 (April, 2009) and peaked during 4 weeks 5\u20136\u20137\u20138/09 (January 27th, 2009 and 24 February, 2009) the number of influenza viruses peaked during 4 weeks 5\u20136\u20137\u20138/09 (January 27th, 2009 and 24 February, 2009) the phase of ascent of the epidemic curve lasted 5 weeks, from week 45 to week 49 (from November 17th until December 15th, 2009) and concerned 23% of the cases. the peak of the epidemic was reached in the week 37 (56.5%), then in the week 51 (56.8%) of the evolution of the epidemic. the pandemic virus has been the predominant strain for the most of the winter season 2009\u20132010. the curve of cases of influenza viruses spread out over 11 weeks (from Wk 1 to Wk 11) there is a decrease during two weeks (in January 24\u201330th and January 31st- February 6th) two peaks have been reported in the Wk 4 and Wk 9 (58.3% and 69.2%) ity indicators suggested a higher level of morbidity in terms of the daily number of cases of confirmed or suspected influenza in critical care in pandemic year. total excess deaths, however, were lower than seen in the 2009\u20132010 pandemic. influenza activity in Tunisia in 2010\u20132011 reached a level higher than that seen in the winter of the 2008\u20132009 season. a total of 3865 out of 7350 respiratory specimens were positive for influenza. of those, 80 (19%) were positive for influenza viruses. influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 33 (22%) influenza A/H3N2 and 3 (3%) unsubtyped influenza A. a noticeable difference from the 2009\u20132010 season has been the relatively high proportion of type B viruses among circulating influenza viruses in season 2008\u20132009, 2009\u20132010 and 2010\u20132011. the identification of these respiratory viruses was undertaken in children admitted to the hospital with acute respiratory infection (Table 2). all viruses characterised in Tunisia during season 2009\u20132010 were outside the seven genetic groups described in the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) report. HA sequences from severe and fatal cases were interspersed with sequences from mild cases in 2009\u20132010 and 2010\u20132011 seasons. all Tunisian 2010 viruses cluster in three main clades. nineteen isolates gathered from 2010 to 2011 clustered with HA of clade A/St. Petersburg/27/2011 viruses characterized by D97N and S185T. one out of 50 viruses studied showed the presence of D222G substitution. the role of D222E in virulence has been ruled out. the clinical significance of D222E mutation is still unclear. strains from Tunisia clustered with B/Victoria/2/87-the oldest strain of Victoria lineage (23.5%) in 2011. all strains (B/Tunisia/8340/2009 and B/Tunisia/8348/2009) were phylogenetically similar to those of the Victoria lineage. most of influenza B viruses circulating in the world during season 2010\u20132011 belong to the B-Yamagata lineage not included in the 2010\u20132011 vaccine. a virus strain belonging to the B-Yamagata lineage was indeed recommended for the vaccine composition of the northern Hemisphere for the season 2012\u20132013."}
