{"summary": "a total of 10,624 clinical samples from 23 states across the united states were submitted to Diatherix Laboratories. the respiratory infections panel detects bacterial and viral pathogens associated with respiratory infections. targets specific for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus were developed, validated, and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Authorization provisions. PCR amplification and Luminex (Austin, TX, USA) liquid suspension detection methods were based on internally validated protocols. of the 10,624 samples studied, 4,690 (44.1%) were negative for all pathogens detectable with the assay. no bacteria detected in samples from 23 states for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus and respiratory pathogen gene targets, may\u2013October 2009*. no.
