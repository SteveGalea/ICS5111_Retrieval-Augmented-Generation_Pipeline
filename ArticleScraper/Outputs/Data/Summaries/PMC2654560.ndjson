{"summary": "health workers (HCWs) will play a key role in any response to pandemic influenza. the ability to cope during an influenza pandemic will depend, to a large extent, on the number of HCWs who are able and willing to work during an influenza pandemic. if generalisable, there are barriers to willingness and to ability. the world health organisation describes an influenza pandemic as an event in which a new influenza virus appears against which the human population has no immunity. in the united kingdom, up to half of the population could become infected with up to 750,000 deaths under the reasonable worst case scenario. Influenza Advisory Committee Subgroup on Modelling estimates staff absenteeism at between 30\u201335% at peak. it may not be reasonable to assume that HCWs will be willing to work even if they are able to do so. a survey of clinical and non-clinical HCWs in the US estimated that up to 50% would be unwilling to work. research on attitudes of HCWs towards working during an influenza pandemic. it is important to have data that will help us understand the 'why' as well as the 'what' and 'how many'. focus groups are a recognised qualitative tool, suitable for research that aims to explore how people think and feel. participants were asked to discuss the things that would worry them about working during an influenza pandemic. the aim of a focus group is not to gather data that is statistically significant or generalisable to the wider population. the results are not presented numerically, as in this context frequency has little meaning and detracts from the qualitative presentation style. participants were recruited from three NHS Trusts in the west Midlands, one acute teaching, one rural district general, and one primary care trust. participants for focus groups were purposively selected from this database according to job category with a view to getting as wide a range of roles as possible. participants for focus groups were purposively selected from this database according to job category. focus groups are a recognised qualitative tool, suitable for research that aims to explore how people think and feel. focus groups are a recognised qualitative tool, suitable for research that aims to explore people's opinions, experiences, wishes and concerns. focus groups are a recognised qualitative tool, suitable for research. 'significance' in qualitative research cannot be determined by the frequency with which a view or opinion is raised, but rather in the manner in which it is raised, discussed, and negotiated by the group. the results are not presented numerically, as in this context frequency has little meaning and detracts from the qualitative presentation style. n = 64 participants, n = 32 were male, n = 31 female, and n = 1 undisclosed. results Of n = 14 were aged 21\u201330, n = 12 were aged 31\u201350, n = 23 were aged 41\u201350, and n = 14 were aged 51 and over. eight main themes emerged relating to the 'duty to work' and 'barriers to working' participants seemed to feel a strong sense of duty to work regardless of the circumstances and displayed a general willingness to work during an influenza pandemic. this sense of duty was found across all categories of workers. duty to work extends to all roles. some people argue that health workers have a duty to tend to the sick and do their job no matter what. some people argue that health workers have a duty to tend to the sick. others argue that being in a position to help another person is a sufficient motivator. the duty to help was constructed as an individual and a social requirement to contribute to the common good. some HCWs had specific skills that would make them particularly useful, and this seemed to make them feel they had a special responsibility where others might not. if you can help, you should help. a simple work ethic and confederate loyalty may be related to or reinforced by, a complex sense of loyalty and obligation to workplace confederates, in this case colleagues and patients. this account tended to emerge from a belief that, as both colleagues and patients depend upon you doing your job, by refusing to work. HC3: You're not a nurse just when everything's okay, do you know what I mean. HC3: You're not just your patients. it's your colleagues as well. there were a number of perceived barriers to working during an influenza pandemic. women with young children tended to regard it as an insurmountable obstacle. women with young children tended to regard it as an insurmountable obstacle. women with young children tended to regard it as an insurmountable obstacle. duties to family were more important than any duty to work. childcare functioned as a barrier to willingness, where a choice puts family before work. some barriers to ability were concrete like being ill oneself and transport problems. if the schools were closed there's no way I'd be able to come in because you can't [Laughs] You'd have other outside influences wouldn't you. if you had children, if the schools were closed there's no way I'd be able to come in because you can't [Laughs] You know your first duty is to their care so you would have to think about them before you could come in. if I'm infected and if I'm isolated then I wouldn't be able to work. negotiation risk and duty GP5: if there is a substantial risk that you yourself may succumb. GP5: I think most of us would go in, even me who's raising all these concerns, but there's a little bit of me that says that I'd tell you on the day. the whole point about a pandemic is it affects the whole herd, the whole tribe and why should I worry about taking it home when they're more likely to catch it from school or shopping or. participants were reluctant to say outright that personal risk concerned them. many stressed the importance of being provided with effective PPE. participants did not believe that the relationship between HCW and employer is not reciprocal. the majority of participants said they had been given neither information about pandemic influenza, nor made aware of what would be expected of them during such a crisis. lack of information was a key theme across all groups, with the majority finding the lack of information a demotivator to work. this was in direct contrast to the views expressed by the majority of other groups, who wanted information immediately and to be involved in the planning effort. if you think about giving information down to that level, it so rarely gets down there. both clinical and non-clinical participants were worried about being asked to perform a role they had not been trained for. there was also a belief that there would be less support during a pandemic. medical staff fear they'll be litigated two years down the line because they rationed and denied services to people because there weren't enough beds or because they chose one patient over another. a further, connected, issue was that of the general erosion of morale and goodwill in the NHS as whole. some participants believed that staff felt so under-valued and under-appreciated. some would be unlikely to report for work if they thought they were at personal risk. if they just show they're grateful for what you did, that's when morale goes down. participants felt a strong sense of duty to work regardless of the circumstances. this sense of duty was found across all categories of workers, but was justified in a variety of ways that can be brought under three headings. some felt the duty to work is a professional duty that entails an obligation to work even in difficult and dangerous circumstances. duty to work extends to all roles. some people will argue that health workers have a duty to tend to the sick and do their job no matter what. some people will extend that to just doctors, some to doctors and nurses. duty to work extends to all roles confined to doctors. some people argue that health workers have a duty to tend to the sick and do their job no matter what. some people argue that health workers have a duty to tend to the sick and do their job no matter what. the duty to help was constructed as an individual and a social requirement to contribute to the common good. some HCWs had specific skills that would make them particularly useful, and this seemed to make them feel they had a special responsibility where others might not. if you can help, you should help/The obligation to help. N1/3: Spirit of the Blitz: I think it would depend on what help was required. if it was to administer medicines, it's obvious which one would be needed more. if it was to sit there and just chat, support, wash then the nursing skills might be in use somewhere else so it's a really hard question to answer. spirit N1/5: We're British, Dunkirk spirit. N1/5: Absolutely. I think it would depend on what help was required. if it was to administer medicines or injections, it's obvious which one would be needed more. if it was to sit there and just chat, support, wash then the nursing skills might be in use somewhere else. if you were fit and well during an Influenza pandemic, how likely do you think it is that you would work as normal\" C3: Yeah, so I mean can you expand on that by 'part of the role' HC3: You're not a nurse just when everything's okay, do you know what I mean. you're not a nurse just when everything's okay, do you know what I mean. you're not a nurse just when everything's okay, do you know what I mean? the 'childcare' barrier is age and gender related. women with young children tended to regard it as an insurmountable obstacle. women with young children tended to regard it as an insurmountable obstacle. childcare functioned as a barrier to willingness, where a choice puts family before work. participants recognised that they could not work if incapacitated by illness. participants also anticipated that in the event of an influenza pandemic transport infrastructures might be affected. family comes first N2/1: but it's not just people with children, it's people with old parents or you know it's home situations isn't it. if you'd got nobody to look after your children you would have to think about them before you could come in. if you'd got nobody to look after your children you would have to think about them. if I'm infected and if I'm isolated then I wouldn't be able to work. if I'm not infected and I need to come to work it would pose a question in my mind whether I'm going to get infected if I come to work. if I'm personally infected then clearly there's going to be the issue of isolation. concerns about taking the virus home and infecting one's family were not perceived as a barrier to ability when participants believed they were in a position to negate or mitigate the risk. some groups felt that anyone who thought that absenteeism would reduce the risk had failed to appreciate that 'pandemic' meant the virus was endemic in the community. a pandemic affects the whole herd, the whole tribe and why should I worry about taking it home when they're more likely to catch it from school or shopping or. it's probably a false assumption that you're gonna keep them safe by not going to work. if you're gonna be there you ought to be very well co-ordinated nationally so you know what you're doing. a pandemic affects the whole herd, the whole tribe and why should I worry about taking it home when they're more likely to catch it from school or shopping or. the risk to self GP2: Okay, can I be honest\" if there was an outbreak I don't think I'd come in. if there was an outbreak I don't think I'd come in...if I put my life and my family's life at risk it's easier to say you would come in but then when you see your colleagues dying I think it's a different thing if you're taking it back to your family because you love them don't you. if there was an outbreak I don't think I'd come in. the belief that the relationship between HCW and employer is not reciprocal was one of the most significant barriers to willingness. participants did not believe that the efforts of HCWs would be reciprocated or rewarded. this was expressed in a variety of different ways, including expectation that HCWs would get no thanks or recognition for their efforts. the majority said they had been given neither information about pandemic influenza, nor made aware of what would be expected of them during such a crisis. the need for information N1/1: It's giving people information as well. it's still very difficult given that we don't know when or what to give information. it's not about keeping ignorant, it's about informing people when you know. if I'm called in to help, clinical-wise and I make a gaffe, and the relatives take me to court who's gonna protect me. there's a big fear amongst medical staff that you know, two years down the line they'll be litigated against because they rationed and denied services to people because there weren't enough beds or because they chose one patient over another. a further, connected, issue was that of the general erosion of morale and goodwill in the NHS as a whole. some participants believed that staff felt so under-valued and under-appreciated that some would be unlikely to report for work if they thought they were at personal risk. the majority seemed to feel that their sense of obligation to patients would overcome their generally low morale. the need for information N1/1: it's giving people information as well, if you're more informed about something you're more likely to do it than if you get up and you're not told anything, why should I put myself at risk if I don't have all of the information\" but it's still very difficult given that we don't know when or what to give information. participants tended to feel they would need more support than usual from their managers. there was also a belief that there would be less support during a pandemic. there was also a belief that there would be less support during a pandemic. a further, connected, issue was that of the general erosion of morale and goodwill in the NHS as a whole. some participants believed that NHS staff felt so under-valued and under-appreciated that some would be unlikely to report for work if they thought they were at personal risk. a single mention that's gonna be soul destroying Erosion of goodwill/morale N2/4: they beat it out of you don't they. they badger you and badger you until...I mean it's a caring profession. it's not a job you do because you want to do it but there is a limit... some people will not work CH5. a decision to work is likely to be the result of a combination of motivations and beliefs, which interact with both genuine and constructed barriers to ability. the key to the efficacy of this remedial action may be to effect changes that prevent barriers to willingness from becoming insurmountable barriers to ability. the key to the efficacy of this remedial action may be to effect changes that prevent barriers from becoming insurmountable barriers to ability. key to effective mitigation is taking steps to tip the scale so that more barriers than not are experienced as barriers to willingness. one concern prominant in all groups was that participants felt they were not being told what was expected of them. if this is a widespread problem, one effective strategy may be to have a policy of education and communicating emergency plans to staff. a more promising avenue may be to encourage team cohesion in small units. it has been observed that soldiers on active duty may be motivated more by feelings of in-group loyalty than by commitment to abstract ideals. current UK planning assumes that up to 50% of the NHS workforce may require time off at the peak of a pandemic. current UK planning assumes that up to 50% of the NHS workforce may require time off at the peak of a pandemic. if people feel they have no choice but to stay away, they will stay away. other factors such as perceptions of duty or peer pressure may provide the motivation to make the choice in favour of working. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
