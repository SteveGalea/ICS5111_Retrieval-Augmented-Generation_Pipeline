{"summary": "autophagy is an umbrella term for a broad family of trafficking pathways. it involves the formation of a double-membrane vesicle (the autophagosome) that sequesters cytoplasm and delivers it to the lysosome by vesicle fusion. the first factors identified in autophagosome biogenesis, the so-called autophagy-related (ATG) factors, were originally identified by genetic screens in yeast [1\u20133] PI3P effectors such as WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide interacting 2 (WIPI2) are then elongated concurrent with lipid conjugation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3) family proteins (autophagy-related protein 8 [Atg8] in yeast) lipidation of specific cell material within autophagosomes is mediated by autophagy receptors. we performed genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screens to identify selective autophagy factors in mammalian cells. we recovered virtually all known ATG factors and uncovered several uncharacterized proteins for further study. we validated our list using quantitative cell microscopy and biochemical analyses. corresponding changes in the observed Red:Green ratio of tfLC3 and tfReceptors provided strong evidence for both basal and induced autophagy in K562 cells. we obtained similar results using adherent human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells (S1B Fig) K562 cells expressing the indicated tf proteins from the AAVS1 locus were analyzed by flow cytometry. values for each reporter were normalized to BafA1 treatment. genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (MAGeCK) [26,27] includes a beta score as a proxy for its strength as an autophagy effector. to facilitate public mining of these data, we have made them freely available using an interactive interface at http://crispr.deniclab.com. ing read counts and beta scores are presented in S2 Data and S3 Data. an interactive interface for data is also available online at http://crispr.deniclab.com. sgRNAs targeting uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase were spurious hits. tfNBR1 flux in K562 cells was largely independent of ATG factors required for LC3 lipidation. novel screen hits robustly yield autophagy phenotypes in single gene knockout experiments. the red dotted line across all samples corresponds to the ratio observed under maximally inhibited conditions (sgATG9A) the median red:green ratio of each population was used to calculate the fold repression according to the following formula: (ratiosgGene ratiosgATG9A) TMEM41B is a conserved ER membrane protein required for autophagy. it is predicted to span the membrane 6 times and carry a di-lysine, C-terminal Golgi-to-ER retrieval signal. unbiased proteomic analysis of subcellular fractions previously assigned TMEM41B\u2019s residence to the ER. TMEM41BKO cells were treated with 250 nM BafA1 for the times indicated. tfLC3 and tfSQSTM1 flux were strongly repressed in TMEM41BKO cells. TMEM41B is required for autophagic flux. the accumulation of lipidated LC3 in TMEM41BKO cells is inconsistent with an initiation defect. to further support this view, we analyzed the kinase activity of unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1), a component of the RB1CC1 complex that regulates phagophore nucleation. TMEM41B is required for phagophore maturation. protease protection assay for detecting closed autophagosomes. targets are protected from proteolysis by trypsin when sequestered by properly sealed vesicles. TMEM41BKO cells showed approximately 5.5-fold more LC3+ punctae. torin treatment induced an approximately 4-fold increase in the level of LC3+ punctae in wild-type cells while having no effect on TMEM41BKO cells. TMEM41BKO cells accumulate unresolved intermediates in autophagosome biogenesis. wild-type and indicated HEK293T knockout cells were treated with 250 nM torin for the indicated times prior to analysis by confocal microscopy. gene ablation of RB1CC1 abolished accumulation of LC3+ or WIPI2+ structures in TMEM41BKO cells. the majority of LC3+ structures in TMEM41BKO cells colocalized with WIPI2. the majority of LC3+ structures in TMEM41BKO cells colocalized with WIPI2. analysis by TEM revealed the accumulation of single-membrane vesicles in TMEM41BKO cells but not in wild-type cells. correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) demonstrated that fluorescent LC3 punctae did not correlate with these vesicles but rather with a distinct population of smaller (approximately 50 nm) vesicles. TMEM41B is functionally related to VMP1. we looked for increased association of certain ATG factors with ER membranes in the absence of TMEM41B, a hallmark of arrested autophagosome biogenesis in VMP1KO cells. TMEM41B shares structural homology and functional redundancy with VMP1. tfEmpty, tfVMP1, or tfTMEM41B expression constructs integrated at the AAVS1 locus in WT and HEK293T knockout cells. adeno-associated virus integration site 1; autophagy-related; BafA1, Bafilomycin A1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEK, human embryonic kidney; IB, immunoblotting; LC3, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B; ns, not significant; RB1CC1, RB1 Inducible Coiled-Coil 1; SQSTM1, sequestosome 1; Sup, supernatant; TA tfLC3 encodes an N-terminal, tf (RFP-GFP) fusion with LC3B, 4 (tfSQSTM1, tfNDP52, tfTAX1BP1 and tfNBR1) with N-terminal fusions to SQSTM1-related autophagy receptors, and 1 (tfEmpty) as a negative control. torin-induced increases in Red:Green ratio were due to selective GFP quenching (S1C Fig) both basal and induced autophagy were dependent on the known autophagy-related factors RB1CC1 and ATG13 (S1D and S1E Fig). a series of genome-wide, pooled CRISPR knockout screens were performed in K562 cells co-expressing CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) with each of our autophagic flux reporters. to this end, we used the Brunello single guide RNA (sgRNA) library containing 76,441 sgRNAs covering 19,114 genes. sgRNA sequences from collected cells were obtained by Illumina sequencing and analyzed by MAGeCK. sgRNAs listed under \u201cenhancer sgRNAs\u201d target the 6 genes that scored better than the highest-scoring known autophagy regulator, MLST8. sgRNAs targeting uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) were spurious hits that modified the Red:Green ratio by drastically enhancing RFP fluorescence. tfNBR1 flux in K562 cells was largely independent of ATG factors required for LC3 lipidation (e.g., ATG7). novel screen hits robustly yield autophagy phenotypes in single gene knockout experiments. K562 cells co-expressing Cas9 and tfSQSTM1 were transduced with individual sgRNAs against the indicated genes. cells were pretreated with torin to maximize the dynamic range of tfSQSTM1 signal. TMEM41B is a conserved ER membrane protein required for autophagy. it is predicted to span the membrane 6 times and carry a di-lysine, C-terminal Golgi-to-ER retrieval signal (S3A Fig) tfLC3 and tfSQSTM1 flux were strongly repressed in TMEM41BKO cells. tfLC3 and tfSQSTM1 flux were strongly repressed in TMEM41BKO cells. TMEM41B is required for autophagic flux. all samples were normalized by total protein using a BCA assay prior to loading. p-values were determined using a one-sample t test. the accumulation of lipidated LC3 in TMEM41BKO cells is inconsistent with an initiation defect. to further support this view, we analyzed the kinase activity of Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1), a component of the RB1CC1 complex that regulates phagophore nucleation. we obtained similar results when we analyzed protease protection of LC3-II (S4B and S4C Fig) in sum, these data suggest that TMEM41B is required for phagophore maturation. TMEM41BKO cells showed approximately 5.5-fold more LC3+ punctae than wild-type cells under basal conditions. torin treatment induced an approximately 4-fold increase in the level of LC3+ punctae in wild-type cells. confocal micrographs of wild-type and indicated single and merged channels of IF against indicated proteins. LC3, magenta; WIPI2, green; merged, white; Hoechst, blue. sample size (n) for each sample is indicated. genetic ablation of RB1CC1 abolished accumulation of LC3+ or WIPI2+ structures in TMEM41BKO cells. this analysis did not find appreciable amounts of STX17 on the LC3+ structures that accumulate in TMEM41BKO cells (S5D and S5E Fig) rudimentary collection of membranous sheets, tubules, and vesicles revealed. LC3 punctae correlated with structures resembling fully-fledged autophagosomes. TMEM41BKO cells expressing tfLC3 were grown under basal conditions. we hypothesized that TMEM41B and VMP1 have related activities. we looked for increased association of certain ATG factors with ER membranes in the absence of TMEM41B. TMEM41B shares structural homology and functional redundancy with VMP1. LC3-II levels in each lane were normalized to tubulin. p-values were determined using a student t test. bar graphs show the mean SD of each sample. tfTMEM41B and tfVMP1 complemented TMEM41BKO phenotypes. both tfTMEM41B and tfVMP1 complemented TMEM41BKO phenotypes. tfVMP1 was able to suppress VMP1KO phenotypes. TMEM41B is an ER integral membrane protein critical for autophagic flux in multiple human cell lines. TMEM41B contains a conserved transmembrane domain (pfam09335) also found in VMP1. two groups independently reported TMEM41B as a novel modifier of mammalian autophagy [53,54] on the basis of these phenotypic similarities, both observed similarities between TMEM41B and VMP1 deletions. TMEM41B has been implicated in diverse pathologies, including spinal muscular atrophy [63], pulmonary carcinoid tumors [64], and coronavirus infection [65]. the identification of TMEM41B as a novel ATG factor is one facet of this work. other aspects of our data remain to be explored. this includes novel inducers of autophagy, receptor-specific modulators, and additional putative ATG factors. secondary antibodies for IB include goat anti-mouse IgG HRP (#170\u20136516, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP (#170\u20136515, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP (#170\u20136515, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP (#1 secondary antibodies include goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 568 (A11036, Thermo Fisher Scientific), goat anti-mouse IgG Cy5 (A10524, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 546 (A32723, Thermo Fisher Scientific). secondary antibodies include torin1 (sc-396760, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX), BafA1 (tlrl-ba pHR-SFFV-GFP1-10 and pCDNA CMV mCherry-GFP-11 were gifts from Bo Huang. human Brunello CRISPR knockout pooled library was a gift from David Root and John Doench (Addgene #73178). lentiCRISPRv2 puro was a gift from Brett Stringer (Addgene plasmid #98290). vector backbones were linearized by restriction enzyme and dephosphorylated by calf intestinal phosphatase (M0290S, NEB, Ipswich, MA) before assembly, all DNA fragments were gel purified. assembled product was transformed into NEB Stable competent cells. single isolates were grown in LB broth + antibiotics. oligos were boiled for 5 min at 95\u00b0C and slow cooled (0.1\u00b0C/s) to facilitate annealing. oligos were diluted 1:100 and 2 l of insert was ligated into 20 ng digested vector.
