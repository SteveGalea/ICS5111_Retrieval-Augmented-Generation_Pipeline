{"summary": "asymptomatic shedding of human rhinovirus (HRV; 1, 2), and human coronavirus (hCoV; 3) has been documented in immune competent children and in adult hematopoietic cell transplant recipients 4. a prospective longitudinal cohort study of children undergoing allogeneic HCT between January 2008 and March 2011. the reaction products were hybridized to a microsphere-based array. this assay has shown an analytical limit of detection of 2.5 copies per reaction using cloned target sequences for all assayed respiratory viruses 5. sensitivity in clinical samples exceeding that of conventional culture and antigen detection methods 6. a total of 33 (42%) of 78 eligible asymptomatic patients consented for study participation. 14 (42%) only had the baseline sample collected preHCT. acute leukemia 24 (73%) was the most common diagnosis. patients with human rhinovirus (HRV), human adenovirus (hADV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human coronavirus (hCoV) showed no relationship between transplant variables and respiratory virus detection. follow up samples were obtained in eight patients for a median of 6 (range 2\u201312) weeks. the use of NPW has been shown to increase the sensitivity of detection of respiratory viruses, compared to nasal swabs 10. the small numbers of patients further precluded correlation of URTI or duration of shedding with transplant associated variables. this underscores the need for subsequent studies with sequential collection of samples to determine the course of asymptomatic shedding in HCT patients."}
