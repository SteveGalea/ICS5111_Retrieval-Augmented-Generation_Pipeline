{"summary": "this study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of Cryptosporidia, Eimeria, Giardia, and Strongyloides in calves on smallholder dairy farms in Mukurwe-ini district, Nyeri County, Kenya. these infections have been associated with economic losses by decreased growth rates, decreased productivity, and increased susceptibility to other diseases. GI diseases in calves can be caused by protozoa such as Cryptosporidium, Coccidia, and Giardia; bacteria such as Escherichia coli; and viruses such as rotavirus and coronavirus. GI nematode infections in cattle are widespread in the world [9], including herds in Kenya [8], causing constraints to productivity through decreased growth rates. the prevalence of Strongyloides has been reported elsewhere in the developing world. 52% in south africa [22], 48% in argentina [23], 50% in india [24], and 51.8% in china [25]. assemblage E is known to infect livestock [6,28,29], and assemblage E is known to infect livestock. study was carried out in mukurwe-ini district, Nyeri County, Kenya. Nyeri County is one of the 47 counties in Kenya, and one of the five counties of the former central province. farm and calf selection and study design Dairy farms used in this study were selected from Mukurwe-ini Wakulima Dairy Limited (MWDL) the dairy company was queried to identify farms with dams due to calf in the months of June and July 2013. analysis Analysis of Cryptosporidia, Eimeria, Strongyloides, and Giardia Sheather\u2019s sucrose floatation method was used to harvest the Cryptosporidium oocysts. slides were subsequently stained using modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain as described by Pfukenyi et al. the parasite concentration technique was used to harvest Giardia cysts. the sediment content was placed on a microscope slide and examined under the microscope at 100 magnification. the presence of one Giardia cyst in a sample was reported as an infection. the study area is characterized by steep ridges and valleys, especially the southern part of Mukurwe-ini. the study area receives adequate equatorial rainfall, making it suitable for the crop (coffee and tea farming) 109 farms were selected into the study with a total of 110 calves. each calves was allocated a study number and ear tagged for identification. subsequent visits were made at 4 and 6 weeks of age for fecal sampling. both compartments of the McMaster counting chamber were filled with the sub-sample then allowed to stand for 5 min. all eggs and Eimeria oocysts within the engraved area of the chamber were counted. the number of eggs per gram was calculated as the number of eggs within the grid of each chamber multiplied by a factor of 50. the McMaster technique was used for determining the number of nematode eggs and Eimeria oocysts per gram of feces. all eggs and Eimeria oocysts within the engraved area of the chamber were counted. the number of eggs per gram was calculated as the number of eggs within the grid of each chamber multiplied by a factor of 50. there were 110 calves enrolled in the study (48 females and 62 males) there were no Giardia cysts detected in the fecal samples of the calves. there were no Giardia cysts detected in the fecal samples of the calves. the prevalence of Eimeria, Cryptosporidia, and Strongyloides was numerically but not statistically significantly higher at 4 weeks than at 6 weeks of age. only 7.3% (8/109), 0.9% (1/107) and 0.9% (1/109) of the study calves were infected at both 4 and 6 weeks of age. eria, Cryptosporidia, and Strongyloides 1.7% (1/58) all mixed infections occurred with Eimeria and one or more of the other parasites. prevalences were higher at 4 weeks of age compared to 6 weeks of age. our study shows the overall infection prevalence of the calves at 4 or 6 weeks by Eimeria was 42.7%. this prevalence is lower than previous reports in Kenya of 67.4% by [58] and other reports in Ethiopia, [54] and (47.1%) in China [25]. Conversely, our prevalence was higher than reports in other regions: 19.8% in Zimbabwe [45], 22.7% [59] and 31.9% [60] in Ethiopia. the overall prevalence of Cryptosporidia in the study calves during the study period was 13.6%. the prevalence was similar to other reports of 18% in Kenya [17], 13.2% in Turkey [61], 17.1% in Argentina [63], but higher than the 3.1% found in beef calves in Canada [66]. strongyloides papillosus appears to infect mainly calves with its excretion diminishing by 6-8 months of age. a relatively high prevalence of Giardia cysts has been detected in dairy calves elsewhere, with the cysts being detected as early as 1 month of age. this is contrary to other studies that reported existence of this protozoan. study has shown that Eimeria, Cryptosporidia, and Strongyloides in calves are prevalent among SDF in the study area. the overall prevalence, and a number of multiple and mixed infections appeared to be higher at 4 weeks than 6 weeks, this difference was not statistically significant. a number of multiple and mixed infections appeared to be higher at 4 weeks than 6 weeks. that they have no competing interests."}
