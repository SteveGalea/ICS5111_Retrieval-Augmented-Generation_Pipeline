{"summary": "amotosalen is a synthetic psoralen compound found in fruit and vegetables like limes and celery. it has the potential to penetrate into cells, cross the nuclear membrane, and reversibly intercalate into helical regions of nucleic acid. exposure to a long-wave-length ultraviolet light leads to covalent crosslinks between amotosalen molecules and pyrimidine bases. non-enveloped viruses showed a variable sensitivity to inactivation. parvovirus B19 and human adenovirus 5 were inactivated to the limit of detection. non-enveloped viruses were resistant to inactivation. ens suggests that this treatment has the potential to reduce the incidence of leukocyte mediated adverse immune reactions associated with platelet transfusion like transfusion associated graft-versus-host disease and platelet related febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction. patients who received photochemical treated platelets received more platelet transfusions than conventional platelets. studies performed in animals and humans reported no evidence for a toxicity of psoralen treatment. Riboflavin is a natural component found in food (milk, beer, eggs, yeasts, leafy vegetables) it interacts with nucleic acids after exposure to UV light (280\u2013360 nm) and causes irreversible damage to DNA/RNA. a compound adsorbing device removal process may not be necessary. goodrich et al. reviewed Mirasol\u00ae PRT performance and concluded that platelet cell quality was maintained after treatment and during storage. this data suggested a significant reduction of the risk of platelet related bacteria transmission. the authors established a list of existing criteria and procedures that should be changed in case of implementation. Riboflavin is a natural component found in food (milk, beer, eggs, yeasts, leafy vegetables), and is classified as a \u201cGenerally-Regarded-As-Safe\u201d compound by the FDA. the method is able to inactivate viruses and bacteria in platelet concentrates. the authors noted that the platelet pH and lactate production rate were predictive of recoveries in 50.8\u201359.8%. thus, they used platelet pH and lactate production rate as platelet quality indicators. they concluded that platelet cell quality was maintained after treatment and during storage. gamma irradiation of blood components performed to eliminate the risk of transfusion associated graft-versus-host disease could be eliminated. authors conclude that an inactivated agent should not require screening tests unless of an unusually high infectious titer."}
