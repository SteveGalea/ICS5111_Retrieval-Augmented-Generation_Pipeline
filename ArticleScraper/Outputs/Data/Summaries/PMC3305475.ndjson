{"summary": "encephalitis virus(JEV), tick-borne encephalitis virus(TBEV), sindbis virus(SV) and dengue virus(DV) are arboviruses and cause symptoms of encephalitis, with a wide range of severity and fatality rates. ELISA and IFA are clinically-available for the detection of encephalitis viral antigens, but they could only detect one pathogen in one assay simultaneously. monoclonal antibodies were prepared from hybridoma cell lines constructed by Prof. Zhu et al. all of the antibodies were raised according to standard procedures. antibody spotting and optimization Antibodies were spotted using a BIODOT machine (BD6000;California, USA) on ELISA plates (30 nl/dot) plates were blocked with 3% BSA-PBS in 37\u00b0C for 1 h. plates were dried, sealed, and stored at 4\u00b0C before use. signal intensity and background of each spot was read out and recorded. the positive signals were defined as a signal value > 400 and a signal value (sample)/signal value (negative) > 2. Conventional ELISA The identical antibodies used in the ELISA-array format were also tested in a conventional ELISA format. PCR was conducted with a Quti-teck q-RT-PCR Kit. reaction consisted of 10 L of 2 reaction buffer(0.2 L reverse transcription enzyme, and 250 nmol/l primers and probes) RNA and deionized water were added to a final volume of 20 l. DV and SV were conducted in biosafety level 2 facility. all cultures were inactivated by 0.025% -propionolactone at 4\u00b0C overnight, then 37\u00b0C for 1 h to decompose -propionolactone. antibody spotting and optimization Antibodies were spotted using a BIODOT machine. tion of ELISA plates with biotinylated detecting antibody cocktails was performed in PBS (containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 5% FCS) at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. specific binding of the detecting antibodies was reported by streptavidin-HRP and stained with super signal ELISA Femto Maximum sensitive substrate. the identical antibodies were also tested in a conventional ELISA format. the real-time RT-PCR was conducted with a RNeasy mini kit. the reaction consisted of 10 L of 2 reaction buffer(0.2 L reverse transcription enzyme, and 250 nmol/l primers and probes) RNA and deionized water were added to a final volume of 20 l. spotting buffer containing PBS with 20% glycerol produced tailed spot morphology. buffers containing PBS with 20% glycerol and PBS with 20% glycerol+0.004% Triton-X100 gave good spot morphology (round and full) sensitivity of ELISA-array and the identical conventional ELISA were compared. the detection limit of the two methods was compared and demonstrated. the results showed that neither the ELISA-array nor traditional ELISA displayed cross-reactivity. ELISA array detection results for multiplex encephalitis virus. b:Tick born encephalitis virus(TBEV); c:Sindbis virus(SV); d:Dengue-4 virus(DV-4);F:Eastern equine encephalitis virus(EEEV). validation by mock clinical samples Chicken eggs inoculated with infected human serum were used for validation. the spotting concentration of the capture antibodies varied from 0.2 to 0.0125 mg/ml. the proper spotting concentration was determined by a combination of minimized cross reaction and higher signal intensity. cross reaction detection was also conducted by applying JEV, YF, and DV cultures. spotting concentration optimization of other capture antibodies (4D5, 1F1, 4E11, and 2B8) demonstrated that 0.05 mg/ml was also suitable(data not shown). the optimized array layout, spot volume = 30 nl. SV 2.5 106 1.25 106 Single and multiplex detection of TBEV, JEV, DV, SV, and EEEV. two or three cultures were mixed for multiplex detection. ELISA array detection results for single encephalitis virus. RNA extracted from chicken eggs was applied to a real time RT-PCR assay. consensus detection results confirmed that the ELISA-array assay was reliable. the detection system should be easy to use and can be performed by untrained staff with little laboratory and experimental experience. six antibodies were selected as capture antibodies. another monoclonal antibody, 2A10, could specifically react with all viruses in the genus Flavivirus. for the detection of DV, JEV, and TBEV, the antibodies produced excellent positive signals. however, we suspect that the antibodies both target the surface of the virions. the sensitivity limit assay suggested that virus treated by -propiolactone retains better antigenicity than the heat-inactivation method. the advantage of the ELISA-array was evident with comparable specificity and higher sensitivity than conventional ELISA. 1171663) and National Key Research Special Foundation of China (Grant no. 2011ZX10004-001)."}
