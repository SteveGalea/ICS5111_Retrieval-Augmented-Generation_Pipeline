{"summary": "effective initiation of specific anti-tumor immunity in vivo or in vitro has been investigated by many scientists. most of their research has focused on the induction of adequate tumor antigen-specific effector cells. many studies revealed promising results for inhibiting tumor growth inhibition and elongation of animal survival. tumor lysate-induced anti-tumor immunity is not associated with presumed cell-associated phase but requires a delivery signal, such as the TLR ligand CpG. agonists of toll like receptor 9 (TLR9) have displayed potential as an adjuvant for various vaccines due to their strong immune stimulating activity22-27. human PBMCs were isolated from buffy coats by Ficoll_Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. the viability of the PBMCs was 95-99% as determined by trypan blue exclusion. the CpG 685 sequence (5'-TCGTCGACGTCGTTCTC-3') was diluted in TE buffer (10 mML-1 Tris, 1 mML-1 EDTA, pH 7.0) was tested for endotoxin using pyrogen-free reagents. tumor cells were harvested and rinsed three times in PBS. mice were injected with PBS, lysate, CpG ODN, and lysate plus CpG ODN on days 0, 7 and 14. splenocytes were prepared and cultured for 5 days with mitomycin C-treated B16 cells in a modified Dulbecco's medium. the target cells were labeled with PKH-26 (final concentration of 2.510-6M) the labeling was stopped by incubated with an equal volume of heat-inactivated FBS for 1min at room temperature. after being washed with 10ml PBS, the target cells were added to the target cell suspension. in vitro experiments were performed at least three times. non-parametric analysis was used to analyze the data shown as median. survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. cell lysate were prepared by five cycles of freezing (at -70\u00b0C) and thawing (at 37\u00b0C) cell lysate supernatant and precipitate were separated by centrifugation (1000g for 60 min) precipitate was diluted in the same volume of supernatant in PBS. mice challenged with 2105 B16 tumor cells through subcutaneously inoculation into the right hind leg or 7.5104 B16 tumor cells through intraperitoneally inoculation into abdomen. in the therapeutic protocol, mice were injected s.c. with 2105 B16 tumor cells per mouse (s.c tumor burden model) on day 0 and then immunized with 4106 tumor cell lysate, 50 g CpG ODN, and 4106 tumor cell lysate splenocytes were prepared and cultured for 5 days with mitomycin C-treated B16 cells in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. the ratio of splenocytes to mitomycin C-treated B16 cells was 30: 1. PKH-26 positive cells were gated and same cell numbers were acquired for each sample. the percentage of specific cell lysis in the target cell population was determined by the disappearance of the antigen labeled targets from the CFSEHi population. lysate plus CpG ODN-685 could significantly elongate mice survival time than other groups. results signified that the tumor had spread throughout the abdominal cavity including the greater omentum, mesentery and diaphragm in mice injected with PBS. two mice in each group were sacrificed for observing the tumor metastasis in abdominal cavity. the black mass represents B16 melanoma. the omenta isolated from mice were sectioned for HE staining. mice were immunized with tumor lysate, CpG ODN 685, PBS or tumor lysate plus CpG ODN 685 for three times in a 7-day interval. splenocytes were isolated from spleens of the mice and used as effector cells for killing B16 melanoma cells, L929 cell as nega. DN plus lysate immunization three times from day -16, -9 and -2 before B16 cell inoculations. both experimental and nave mice were used as negative control. results showed that all nave mice died on day 33 after B16 cells. no mice died in lysate plus CpG ODN-685 group. mice treated with CpG ODN-685 plus lysate treated for 100 d were injected with tumor lysate in left hind foot pad once and with PBS in right hind foot. the results showed that mice treated with CpG ODN-685 plus lysate have the antigen specific to lysate. lysate immunized mice showed significantly higher CD4/CD25 positive cells compared to spleens from mice immunized with PBS. the proportion of NK 1.1+ cell and CD4/CD25 positive cells in mice immunized with CpG 685 plus lysate was lower than that of PBS group at 72h. NK1.1+ cells in splenocytes were stained with different fluorescence-labeled antibodies. cells from peritoneal lavage were stained with different fluorescence-labeled antibodies. the proportion of CD4+ T cell was much higher in mice immunized with lysate+CpG685 than the control group at 2448h. mice immunized with tumor lysate plus CpG ODN 685 s.c. for three times in a 7-day interval. the mice were sacrificed for collecting lavages of omentum and peritoneum by rinsing with PBS. tumor growth in mice immunized with lysate + CpG ODN-685 was significantly inhibited compared to mice immunized with either PBS or lysate. tumor growth in mice immunized with lysate + CpG ODN-685 was significantly inhibited compared to mice immunized with either PBS or lysate. mice were injected with B16 tumor cells s.c. on 0d and then immunized with tumor cell lysate with CpG ODN-685 on day 2, 9 and 16. results show that immunization of lsyate+ CpG ODN-685 didn't protect mice from tumor growth and didn't extend survival time. a large number of melanoma cells were detected in the omentum of mice injected with PBS. in contrast, mice administrated with lysate plus CpG ODN 685 showed significantly less changes in their omentum tissue. the results signified that the tumor had spread throughout the abdominal cavity including the greater omentum, mesentery and diaphragm. arrow indicated the melanoma cells in omentum. CpG ODN-685 assists tumor lysate to initiate specific anti-tumor responses in mice. mice were injected with lysate only, lysate plus CpG ODN-685, or PBS for three times weekly. splenocytes were isolated from spleens of the mice. the nave mice were used as negative control. both experimental and nave mice were re-challenged with B16 cells. all nave mice died on day 33 after B16 cells. no mice died in the lysate plus CpG ODN-685 group. survivals of mice ever challenged with B16 melanoma cells were re-challenged i.p. mice treated with CpG ODN-685 plus lysate showed noticeable swelling. tumor lysate in left foot showed noticeable swelling. but right foot with PBS did not exhibit noticeable swelling. the proportion of NK 1.1+ cell and CD4/CD25 positive cells in mice immunized with CpG 685 plus lysate was lower than that of PBS group at 72h. in contrast, the number of CD4+ cells in the spleens did not change at 24h, 48h and 72h. the proportion of CD4+ T cell was much higher in mice immunized with lysate+CpG685 than the control group at 2448h. this number decreased at 72h and eventually became lower than that of the PBS group. for NK1.1+ cells, the cell number increased at 24h but decreased in 48h. the mice were sacrificed for collecting lavages of omentum and peritoneum by rinsing with PBS. the lavage cells were then stained with different fluorescence-labeled antibodies for analyzing CD4, CD8, NK1.1 and CD4CD25 positive cells. tumor growth in mice immunized with lysate + CpG ODN-685 was significantly inhibited compared to mice immunized with either PBS or lysate. there was no tumor growth in 4 mice that were immunized with lysate+CpG ODN-685 for 20 days after anti-tumor immunity. the rate of tumor growth was 100% in the group of CpG ODN-685. unized with tumor cell lysate with CpG ODN-685, or tumor cell lysate + CpG ODN-685 on the day 2, 9 and 16. results show that immunization of lsyate+ CpG ODN-685 didn't protect mice from tumor growth and didn't extend the survival time. NK cells activated by a-class CpG ODN could induce tumor rejection in a variety of mouse tumors, especially weakly immunogenic tumors such as melanoma and fibrosarcoma38-40. it is important for the antigen to be presented efficiently to Th cells. both IFN- and IFN- directly induce cytostatic effects on tumor cells. both CpG ODN-685 and tumor cell lysate play a role in this immune response. this suggests that CD4+/CD8+ T-cells increase within 2448 h. however, there was little change in NK cells or Treg cells. 26 and peptide vaccine caused by CD8+ T cell response is not dependent on the aid of CD4+ T cells. soluble protein vaccines plus CpG ODN did not require the helper T cell pathway41,42."}
