{"summary": "toxicity of ionizing irradiation is caused by total- or partial-body exposure to a high dose of penetrating ionizing radiation over a short period of time. in clinical medicine, ARS often exists as the adverse side-effect of radiation therapy for cancer and other diseases. administration of medicine for radiation damage control is one of the most effective and direct approaches to protect and treat the injuries caused by ionizing radiation. toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) plays a pivotal role in the natural immune system. it is expressed in epithelial cells, mononuclear cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. it mediates immune response and inflammation formation, and activates downstream NF-B signaling pathways. the high-density ionic charge of PEI activates the hTLR5 receptor-mediated NF-B pathway, and provides an anti-radiation effect. there have been no reports published investigating the protective effects of PEI against radiation injury. d goat anti-mouse IgG, goat anti-rabbit IgG, MTT cell proliferation and cytotoxicity detection kit, and dual luciferase assay kit were purchased from beyotime Institute of Biotechnology. Restriction enzymes, DNA ligase and Taq enzyme were purchased from TaKaRa Bio INC.

Branched PEI with a molecular weight of 25 000 by LS, Cat No. 408727 and Flag antibody were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) the positive control drug, amifostine (AMI), was purchased from Merro Pharmaceutical Company (Dalian, China) HEK-293 cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in air and 5% CO2atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. CaCo-2 cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, 4.5 g/l glucose, 2.292 mg/ml glutamine, 10 nmol/l pyruvic acid sodium, = and 1% unsaturated amino acid in air. the sequence of hTLR5 in pcDNA3.1-V5/HisB recombinant was confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing. the sequence of hTLR5 in pcDNA3.1-V5/HisB recombinant was confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing. hTLR5-mediated NF-kB signaling was assayed by treatment of flagellin. cells were lysed in buffer containing 0.5% TritonX-100, 150 mM NaCl, 12.5 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM EGTA, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4and 2 mM DTT plus protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) protein concentration of lysate was determined using bio-Rad. blots were incubated with goat-anti-rabbit-HRP (Beyotime, China) HEK 293T cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 8 103for 24 h. cells were incubated at various concentrations of PEI in DMEM for 48 h. ten microliters of MTT was added to each well and incubated for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. animals were intra-peritoneally injected with different agents 30 min before an 8-Gy 60Co -ray total body irradiation (TBI) daily weights of survival mouse and observations were performed over a period of 30 days. Statistical difference between groups was determined using the unpaired two-tailed ttest. luciferase activity was significantly activated by flagellin at concentrations ranging from 1.0 to 10.0 g/ml. cell-based model was used to assess whether PEI is a novel TLR5 agonist that targets the hTLR5-mediated NF-B pathway. luciferase activity was increased just like the TLR5 agonist, flagellin. PEI is a novel agonist of TLR5 that activates the NF-B intracellular signaling pathway mediated by TLR5. there was no significant cytotoxicity when PEI concentration was below 0.5 mol/l. there was no significant cytotoxicity when PEI concentration was below 0.5 mol/l. animal survival time and survival rate significantly improved in mice that received a low dose of PEI (P= 0.019), or high dose of PEI (P 0.001). compared with the radiation protection positive control (150 mg/kg of AMI, 8.8 0.9), animal survival rate was higher in mice that received a high dose of PEI (9.1 1.8), but lower for the low dose PEI group. protection positive control was found to increase with time over a period of 30 days. animal body weight in the irradiation control declined with time over a period of 30 days. the correlation coefficient was 0.42 (P 0.02), 0.72 (P 0.0001) and 0.95 (P 0.0001). polyethylenimine (PEI) is a novel TLR5 agonist activating the hTLR5-mediated NF-B pathway. the cell-based system has potential application for screening of new TLR5 agonists that target the hTLR5-mediated NF-B pathway. cytotoxicity of PEI was assessed at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 5 mol/l by MTT assay. cytotoxicity of PEI was measured by MTT assay. there was no significant cytotoxicity when PEI concentration was below 0.5 mol/l. PEI (0.2\u20131.0 mol/l) can activate the NF-B intracellular signaling pathway. without radiation, C57BL/6J mice received an intra-peritoneal injection of 70 mg/kg PEI causing no sign of stress or body weight loss. animal survival rate was higher in mice that received a high dose of PEI (9.1 1.8), but lower for the low dose PEI group (6.7 2.2, P 0.001) animal body weight in IR mock declined with time. the correlation coefficient (r) is 0.42 (P 0.02), 0.72 (P 0.0001) and 0.95 (P 0.0001). results demonstrate that PEI has radiation protective activity in an animal model when administered prophylactically. branched PEI can activate the hTLR5-mediated NF-kB signaling pathway in a dose-dependent manner in a cell model. this finding is in agreement with a previous study using linear PEI that activated murine TLR5-mediated NF-B signaling pathway in a separate study. the 50% and 36% mortality rates in low- and high-dose PEI groups are most likely due to insufficient radiation protection provided by the dose of PEI administrated. the dose might have been too low to provide complete radiation protection. polyethylenimine is a new human TLR5 agonist with potential application in radiation protection."}
