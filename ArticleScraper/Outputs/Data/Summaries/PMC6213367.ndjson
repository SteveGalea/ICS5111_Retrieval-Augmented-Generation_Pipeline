{"summary": "HSV infections are acquired at mucosal surfaces where initial epithelial cell infections can lead to disease manifestations that include herpes labialis, genital herpes, gingivostomatitis, encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, neonatal herpes, and stromal keratitis. HSV-1 and HSV-2 share common structural features, including a large double-stranded DNA genome. anti-HSV DAAs acyclovir and foscarnet offer examples of the hazards of drug resistance. these drugs interrupt HSV genome replication by different mechanisms of action. acyclovir is a nucleoside analogue prodrug that selectively targets HSV infected cells. photodynamic effect has been exploited in photodynamic therapy (PDT) [11,12] for treatment of cancers [13] and age-related macular degeneration [14]. photodynamic effect has been exploited in photodynamic therapy [11,12] for treatment of cancers [13] and age-related macular degeneration [14] orthoquin has been shown to have bacteriocidal properties and to disrupt bacterial biofilms without causing overt inflammation [17]. sub-cytotoxic doses reduced HSV-1 and HSV-2 plaque formation in a light-dependent manner. the largest signals at these wavelengths were due to polydatin (63 g mg1), resveratrol (60 g mg1), anthraglycoside B (12 g mg1), rhein (5.6 g mg1), emodin (50 g mg1), and physcion (10 g mg1). cells, Viruses, and Reagents HeLa, HEK293A, and Vero (African Green Monkey kidney) inoculum was generated by infecting a monolayer of Vero cells with a low MOI and harvesting cell-associated virus three days post-infection. cells were dissociated from the plastic by pipetting and were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation. the cell pellet was resuspended in serum-free media and lysed with three freezethaw cycles. LED lamp for 30 min at room temperature was 37.8 J cm2 at a rate of 21 mW cm2. plates were placed back in the incubator for 3.5 h. fluorescence was recorded using a Tecan microplate reader. inoculum was rinsed off with 1 mL PBS and 500 L of 1.2% Avicel overlay was pipetted into each well. cells were left to plaque for four days post-infection. cells were seeded at a density of 4.5 105 cells/mL in 12-well plates. the following day, the medium was removed and cells were inoculated with 100 L PDI- or mock-treated AdV-GFP. inoculum was rinsed off with 1 mL PBS, and 1 mL of pre-warmed 0.4% agarose overlay was pipetted into each well. se K and 200 L Buffer AL master mix were added to each sample. samples were mixed by vortexing and incubated at 56 \u00b0C for 10 min. resulting mixture was processed according to manufacturer's instructions. or HSV-1 infected cells were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min. samples were treated with 50 g/mL DNase I for 30 min on ice. any pelleted material was resuspended in serum-free DMEM. significant statistical differences between light and dark treatments were determined by two-way ANOVA. p-values 0.05 are depicted on the graph by an asterisk (*) 93A, and Vero (African Green Monkey kidney) cells were cultured in modified Eagle\u2019s medium. they were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 g/mL streptomycin, and 20 mM l-glutamine. hTert-BJ cells were maintained at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. denovirus 5 vector (AdV-GFP, Clontech, San Diego, CA, USA) lacks the essential E1 early genes, which can be complemented in trans by generating the virus in HEK293A cells. cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 20,000 and 5000 cells per well, respectively, in duplicate plates. HSV-2 and VSV inocula were exposed to light for only 5 min because they were photosensitive. the temperature of the inoculum under these lighting conditions did not exceed 30 \u00b0C. VSV Plaque Assay Vero cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 105 cells/mL in 12-well plates. media was removed and cells were inoculated with 100 L of PDI- or mock-treated VSV (in serum-free media) for 1 h with shaking every 10 min. inoculum was then rinsed off with 1 mL PBS and 1 mL of 1.2% Avicel overlay (1:1 of 2.4% Avicel and 2 MEM, -1 and HSV-2 Plaque Assay Vero cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 105 cells/mL in 12-well plates. the following day, media was removed and cells were inoculated with 100 L of PDI-treated or mock-treated VSV. cells were then rinsed off with 1 mL PBS and 1 mL of 1.2% Avicel overlay. cells were inoculated with 100 L PDI- or mock-treated AdV-GFP (in serum-free medium) for 1 h with shaking every 10 min. inoculum was rinsed off with 1 mL PBS, and 1 mL of pre-warmed 0.4% agarose overlay was pipetted into each well. 20 L Proteinase K and 200 L Buffer AL master mix were added to each sample. samples were mixed by vortexing and incubated at 56 \u00b0C for 10 min. resulting mixture was processed according to manufacturer's instructions. extracellular virus was obtained following a modified version of the virus purification protocol published by Loret et al. [20]. cells were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min to remove cells and large debris. any pelleted material was resuspended in serum-free DMEM. blots were developed using Clarity Western ECL Blotting Substrate (BioRad) and proteins were visualized using a ChemiDoc Imaging System (BioRad). 2.8. Statistics All normalization and data management was performed with Microsoft Excel for Mac (Microsoft, version 16.17, Redmond, WA, USA) the largest identifiable signals based on reference standards were due to polydatin (63 g mg1), resveratrol (60 g mg1), anthraglycoside B (12 g mg1), rhein (5.6 g mg1), emodin (50 g mg1), and physcion (10 g mg1). cell viability assays were performed to identify phototoxic threshold concentrations of Orthoquin on transformed HeLa epithelial cells. alamarBlue\u00ae cell viability assay performed 48 h post-treatment. n = 3 SEM independent biological replicates. HSV-1 and HSV-2 incolula were mixed with the indicated concentrations of Orthoquin and exposed to light for 10 min and 5 min respectively. a significant light-dependent reduction in plaque formation was observed at 0.05 and 0.1 g/mL doses of Orthoquin for HSV-1. but doses of 0.5 and 1 g/mL of Orthoquin potently inhibited HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection in a light-independent manner. orthoquin PDI inactivates HSV-1 across a 100-fold range of inoculum titer. four 10-fold dilutions of HSV-1 virion stocks were mixed with 0.1 g/mL Orthoquin. the samples were either treated with light or kept in the dark. the antiviral effect of Orthoquin was due to PDI effects on virions. orthoquin was exposed to light before combining with HSV-1 incolula. this treatment would allow us to determine whether Orthoquin antiviral activity was due to a photoproduct not acting through PDI. a 10-fold difference in viral gene amplification was observed between each 10-fold HSV-1 dilution, indicating that the assay reliably amplified viral DNA. a 10-fold difference in viral gene amplification was observed between \u201clight\u201d and \u201cdark\u201d treatments. four 10-fold dilutions of HSV-1 inocula were mixed with 0.1 g/mL Orthoquin and exposed to a 65 W LED light in clear (light) or black (dark) tubes for 10 min. samples were treated with DNase I for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. treatment with the higher 0.1 mg/mL dose of Orthoquin caused a dramatic loss of detection of certain antigens in the 80\u2013135 kDa range. this 0.1 mg/mL dose far exceeds the effective dose previously established in Figure 3. however, these findings suggest that Orthoquin PDI can physically disrupt HSV-1 structural proteins. VSV and AdV inocula were incubated with 0.01 to 1 g/mL Orthoquin. light exposure did not improve antiviral activity at any concentration. a sharp decrease in VSV plaque formation was observed starting at 0.05 g/mL Orthoquin. however, light exposure did not improve antiviral activity at any concentration. Plaques were counted using a fluorescent microscope. n = 4 SEM from four independent biological replicates. ns = non-significant by two-way ANOVA. nd = none detected. the largest identifiable signals based on reference standards were due to polydatin (63 g mg1), resveratrol (60 g mg1), anthraglycoside B (12 g mg1), rhein (5.6 g mg1), emodin (50 g mg1), and physcion (10 g mg1). marBlue\u00ae cell viability assay performed 48 h post-treatment. n = 3 SEM independent biological replicates.
