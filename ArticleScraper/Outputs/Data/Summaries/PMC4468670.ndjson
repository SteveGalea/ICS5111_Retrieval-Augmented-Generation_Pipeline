{"summary": "inhibitors targeting the matrix protein 2 (M2) or neuraminidase (NA) protein of influenza virus have been applied in clinical treatments (5). however, the emergence of drug-resistant mutants remains a substantial concern. the polymerase complex of influenza virus serves as the center of viral replication and transcription. PA plays the role of an endonuclease, cleaving host mRNAs downstream of their mRNA cap structures. however, few studies have been carried out to target the functional PAN domain directly. a single-stranded DNA library targeting the PA or PAN domain of an H5N1 influenza virus was screened by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) we selected a DNA and not an RNA library for screening antiviral aptamers, based on several rationales. the price of RNA synthesis is higher than that for DNA, particularly on an industrial manufacturing scale. arby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and human embryonic kidney 293T (293T) cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM) (Gibco) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 g/ml streptomycin at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. the cDNA fragment of the PA endonuclease domain of the same virus strain was amplified by PCR. a truncated construct of PAN with a 3-residue linker was cloned into the pET-32a(+) expression vector (Novagen) between the KpnI and NcoI sites. sDNA library was chemically synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. it was composed of 30 random nucleotides flanked by two conserved sequences. forward primer 5\u2032-CCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGGGAGCTCGGTACCGAATTC-3\u2032 and reverse primer 5\u2032-AAGGATCCTCTCTGCAAAGCTT-3\u2032. 280 streptavidin beads (Invitrogen) were applied to separate ssDNA from the amplified PCR product. the incubation lengths of matrix and the ssDNA library from the last round were gradually reduced from 60 min to 30 min and the protein amount from 30 g to 5 g. individual 5\u2032-biotinylated aptamer was denatured, and 100 l of serial dilutions was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. after washing, 100 l of streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Invitrogen) was applied to each well and incubated for another 30 min at 37\u00b0C. in a 10-l reaction volume, 100 nM or 10 nM denatured aptamers were incubated with 1 M enzyme for 1 h, followed by 3 h of incubation with 0.2 g of substrate M13mp18 (NEB) the final products were loaded for agarose electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. 10 l of freshly prepared 5 mg/ml MTT solution was added to each well. 100 l of 10% SDS with 0.01 M HCl was added to each well. the mixture was incubated overnight. secondary structures of selected aptamers predicted by Mathews Lab Web Servers. simulated flexible docking of aptamer binding nucleotides (CCGG) was carried out using the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software. transfection complex was added to 25 l of Opti-MEM containing 1 l of Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) the cells were lysed at 24 h post-secondary transfection. eGFP fluorescence was first determined by the use of a Victor X3 multilabel plate reader. strains, A/HK/415742/09 (H1N1), A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1), A/Netherlands/219/2003 (H7N7), and A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) were propagated in MDCK cells. all viruses were cultured in the presence of 1 g/ml tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated tryps pET-32a(+) expression vector (pET-blank) was cloned into the pET-32a(+) expression vector (Novagen) between the KpnI and NcoI sites. plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and overexpressed in LB medium. aptamer selection relied on a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) magnetic agarose bead (Qiagen) purified PA or PAN (30 g) was first immobilized on the magnetic bead to form a protein-bead matrix. the denatured oligonucleotides were then incubated with the matrix for 1 h. antigen-coated plates were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline. individual 5\u2032-biotinylated aptamer was denatured. 100 l of serial dilutions was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. 100 l of 3,3\u20325,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Pierce) was added to each well and incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. the reaction was stopped by adding 50 l of 1 M H2SO4. aptamers with both binding and endonuclease inhibitory abilities were further tested for antiviral effect. in 96-well plates, MDCK cells (4 104 cells/well) were transfected with aptamers at concentrations of 12.5, 6.25, 3.13, 1.56, 0.78, 0.39, and 0 nM by the use of X-tremeGENE HP DNA transfection reagent (Roche) 2 M PAN was incubated with 20 nM 5\u2032 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled aptamer for 30 min at room temperature in the binding buffer (20 mM HEPES, 40 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT], 1 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol) polymerase activity analysis upon PAN-2 aptamer transfection was carried out by a previously described minireplicon assay (48), with some modifications. 293T cells were seeded into a 24-well plate at the density of 2 105 cells per well. nescence was measured upon adding substrate (Promega) at 12 or 24 h post-secondary transfection, total RNAs of each sample were extracted from the cell lysate using the RNeasy minikit. the cDNA was synthesized using influenza universal primer Uni12 (5\u2032-AGCAAAAGCAGG-3\u2032) and PrimeScript II reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa) lane 1, cell lysate before IPTG induction; lane 2, cell lysate after IPTG induction; lane 3, purified PAN. in vitro selection of DNA aptamers targeting PA or PAN. sequences with multiple copies (more than three identical copies) are listed in Table 1.

PAN-1, PAN-2, PAN-3, and PAN-4 were tested by MTT assay. notably, >90% of the MDCK cells survived the incubation period. the 50% cytotoxicity concentration was >10 M and was >1,000-fold higher than their corresponding IC50s. residues 16 to 19 (CCGG) of PAN-2 were essential for the binding of the PAN domain. the results predicted that the binding site of PAN-2 was well exposed on the surface of the stem-loop structure formed by base pairs T14-A24, C15-G23, C16-G22, and C17-G21. aptamer PAN-2 harbored an enzyme active cavity coordinated by the conserved amino acids His41, Glu80, Asp108, Glu119, and Lys134 (49) the binding site of PAN-2 directly occupied this enzymatic pocket by forming hydrogen bonds with the surrounding amino acids. mer PAN-2 inhibited PA endonuclease activity in vitro. a minireplicon assay was performed in the mock-treatment wells. a decrease in luciferase activity was observed in the PAN-2-transfected cells. mRNA transcription of the PA gene of each treatment was quantified by reverse transcription-qualitative PCR (RT-qPCR) at the indicated concentrations and time points. the data are represented as the means + standard errors of the means (SEM) of triplicate data. aptamers were enriched at as early as the 5th or 10th round. the most potent aptamer, PAN-2, disappeared after the 10th round. the most potent aptamer, PAN-2, exhibited a cross-subtype antiviral effect. aptamers that survived until the last round of selection should have the highest binding affinity. aptamers that survived until the last round of selection should have the highest binding affinity. aptamers that survived until the last round of selection should have the highest binding affinity. endonuclease cavity was fully occupied by the hairpin structure formed by nucleotides CCGG. magnesium ions and water molecules were competitively engaged by a backbone phosphate group and the C17 nucleobase. however, accommodation of the PAN endonuclease pocket and interactions with metal ions and water molecules may impair the enzyme activity. the anti-influenza A aptamers discovered in this study may have high clinical potential. the fact that aptamers are liable to nuclease degradation and renal filtration in vivo limits their application in clinical therapy. the application of antiviral-effective aptamers in the therapy of influenza diseases will be increasingly feasible."}
