{"summary": "reoviruses are internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis (7). the first disassembly intermediate, called the infectious subvirion particle, is characterized by the loss of 3, the cleavage of 1, and a conformational change in the 1 protein. ISVPs are stable particles, which can be internalized by either endocytosis or direct penetration of the plasma membrane. a hydrophobic core formed within a helical bundle usually accounts for most intersubunit interactions and provides the largest contribution to overall. the predicted coiled-coil domain of the 1 protein is followed by two domains, termed the body and head. the body encompasses 140 amino acids that fold primarily into triple -spiral repeats (5). this motif has been observed for only a limited number of viral fiber proteins. structures of the head and parts of the body domain have been determined for T1L and T3D 1 proteins. the structures reveal previously unidentified features, including bound chloride ions at the center of the T1L 1 coiled-coil domain. the native crystals of T1L 1cc diffracted to a resolution of 1.43. the structure of this fragment was determined with experimental phasing. the model was used for molecular replacement to determine the crystal structures of T1L 1cc_body and T3D 1cc_body. 99.9 (99.7) 99.9 (99.8) Total no. of reflections 445,146 (63,117) 503,646 (33,260) 1,039,304 (18,914) 223,136 (14,337) 343,646 (24,014) No. of unique reflections 67,336 (10,431) 76,273 (5,563) 25,687 (1,566) 35,260 (2,552) 50,259 (3,674) Redundancy values in parentheses are for the highest-resolution shell. RMSD, root mean square deviation; CC1/2, Pearson correlation coefficient calculated between two subsets of unmerged experimental data. overall structures of the T1L and T3D 1 tails connected to adjacent -spiral repeats. helical bundle of T3D 1 is formed by 20 heptad repeats (residues 27 to 168) the -spiral repeats (1 to 4) and part of the short body domain coiled-coil insertion are present in the electron density map. 1cc_body structures show a direct connection of the coiled-coil tail and the body domain, with no intrinsically flexible interdomain region. an asparagine side chain from the body domain forms hydrogen bonds with carbonyl groups located at the most C-terminal coiled-coil turn. a second body domain residue interacts with a carbonyl group of the coiled-coil end. coiled-coil domains of T1L and T3D 1 proteins are stabilized by a number of intersubunit salt bridges, which are distributed over the length of the helical bundles. in each coiled coil, some hydrophilic residues are located at usually hydrophobic heptad repeat positions (\u201ca\u201d and \u201cd\u201d), with side chains pointing toward the trimer core. the trimeric 1 protein is shown in blue, red, and yellow. a third chloride ion is bound in a hydrophobic pocket inside the structure. no asparagines are located at \u201cd\u201d positions, and no chloride ions are present in the interior. a discontinuity of the heptad repeat pattern in the form of a 4-amino-acid insertion (stutter) is present near the C terminus of the coiled-coil region in all 1 serotypes. the motif \u201cabcd\u201d (T1L 1 residues 147 to 150 [VTTE] and T3D 1 residues 151 to 154 [VTSI]) is present between two \u201cabcdefg\u201d repeats the carboxyl group of E150 forms a salt bridge with R153. in the case of T3D 1, residue I154 at the \u201cd\u201d position of the stutter is shifted toward Q155, which leads to hydrophobic interactions with the C and C atoms of Q155. the mutant viruses were recovered by using plasmid-based reverse genetics. titers of the three coiled-coil-to-body transition mutants were substantially lower than those of the parental rsT3SA+ virus after two passages in L cells. 1 coiled-coil-to-body transition mutants showed highly impaired replication kinetics in comparison to those of T3SA+. titers of rsT1L 1 R161A and rsT3SA+ 1 N182A were reduced by 48 h postinfection. these findings indicate that stabilizing interactions at the coiled-coil-to-body domain boundary are required. rsT3SA+ 1 R161A, rsT3SA+ 1 N182A, and rsT3SA+ 1 R161A,N182A exhibited markedly reduced infectivity. mutations destabilizing the coiled-coil-to-body junction do not impair binding to JAM-A and sialic acid. the reduced sensitivities of all mutants to NA and rsT3SA+ do not impair binding 1 coiled-coil-to-body transition mutant reoviruses were treated with the indicated concentrations of NA to remove sialic acid or J10.4 to block binding to JAM-A. rsT3SA+ or 1 coiled-coil-to-body transition mutant reoviruses were incubated with polyclonal antireovirus serum as a positive control. NH4Cl (25 mM) was added to L cells at rsT3SA+ 1 N182A virus was less sensitive than rsT3SA+ to neutralization by 9BG5 at the lowest antibody concentrations, but it was still neutralized efficiently. rsT3SA+ and all of the coiled-coil-to-body transition mutants were equivalently sensitive to NH4Cl at all times of addition. reovirus variants and mutants with polymorphisms encapsidate different amounts of 1 fibers. mutant viruses encapsidate approximately 50% (rsT3SA+ 1 R161A and rsT3SA+ 1 N182A) or 30% (rsT1L 1 R161A,N182A) of the amount of 1 encapsidated by the parental rsT3SA+ virus. purified reovirus particles (1 1010) were resolved by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel and visualized by colloidal Coomassie staining. individual bands on the gel correspond to particles that differ in the numbers (0 to 12) of encapsidated 1 trimers. idated 1 for coiled-coil-to-body transition mutant viruses. the small amount that is encapsidated appears to be capable of forming trimers, binding to carbohydrate receptors and JAM-A, and mediating pH-dependent entry. rsT3SA+ and 1 coiled-coil-to-body transition mutant reoviruses can undergo conformational rearrangements during virion-to-ISVP conversion. equal numbers of particles of purified reovirus virions (V) or ISVPs (I) were serially diluted, incubated with a 1% suspension of human erythrocytes at 4\u00b0C for 4 h. results are expressed as mean log2 HA resulting model was used for molecular replacement to determine the crystal structures of T1L 1cc_body and T3D 1cc_body at resolutions of 2.10 and 2.15 respectively. resulting model was used for molecular replacement to determine the crystal structures of T1L 1cc_body and T3D 1cc_body at resolutions of 2.10 and 2.15. 67,336 (10,431) 76,273 (5,563) 25,687 (1,566) 35,260 (2,552) 50,259 (3,674) Redundancy 6.6 (6.1) 6.6 (6.0) 40.5 (12.1) 6.3 (5.6) 6.8 (6.5) Rmeas (%) 12.3 (71.4) 10.9 (87.6) 7.0 (14.4) 16.9 (11.7) CC1/2 (%) 99.9 (96.4) 99.9 (72.3) 10 the structures of T1L 1cc_body and T3D 1cc_body reveal an elongated, rodlike homotrimer consisting of two structural domains. a long N-terminal -helical coiled coil and a C-terminal region formed by -spiral repeats. the helical bundle of T3D 1 is formed by 20 heptad repeats (residues 27 to 168), resulting in a domain that is approximately 205 long. the -spiral repeats (1 to 4) and part of the short body domain coiled-coil insertion are present in the electron density map. an asparagine side chain from the body domain forms hydrogen bonds with carbonyl groups located at the most C-terminal coiled-coil turn. a second body domain residue interacts with a carbonyl group of the coiled-coil end. residues involved in interactions between the two domains are conserved in all three serotypes. the coiled-coil domains of T1L and T3D 1 proteins are stabilized by a number of intersubunit salt bridges, which are distributed over the length of the helical bundles. in each coiled coil, some hydrophilic residues are located at usually hydrophobic heptad repeat positions (\u201ca\u201d and \u201cd\u201d), with side chains pointing toward the trimer core. a third chloride ion is bound in a hydrophobic pocket inside the structure. a serine (S39), two histidines (H42 and H123) and an arginine (R67) are present at typically hydrophobic core positions. d\u201d is present between two \u201cabcdefg\u201d repeats. this stutter leads to local unwinding of the coiled coil. in a d-a layer, the residues at the \u201cd\u201d position of the stutter are shifted outside the core toward the following \u201ca\u201d position, causing a ringlike interaction around the central core. residue I154 is shifted toward Q155, which leads to hydrophobic interaction with the C and C atoms of Q155. interactions at the coiled-coil-to-body domain boundary are required for efficient reovirus replication. mutant viruses were recovered by using reverse genetics. the chloride-binding-deficient virus rsT1L 1 N38V,N94V as well as the stutterless rsT3SA+ viruses (rsT3SA+ 1 VTSI and rsT3SA+ 1 +QST) produced titers comparable to those of the parental viruses after two passages in murine L929 fibroblasts (L cells) rsT3SA+ 1 N182A and rsT1L 1 R161A,N182A were reduced by 48 h postinfection. these findings indicate that stabilizing interactions at the coiled-coil-to-body domain boundary are required for efficient reovirus replication in L cells. al antibody (MAb) J10.4 blocks reovirus binding to JAM-A. we found 40% inhibition of rsT3SA+ infection and 20% inhibition of rsT3SA+ 1 R161A, rsT3SA+ 1 N182A, and rsT3SA+ 1 R161A,N182A at the highest NA treatment concentration. rsT3SA+ 1 R161A and rsT3SA+ 1 R equivalently infectious concentrations of rsT3SA+ or 1 coiled-coil-to-body transition mutant reoviruses were incubated with polyclonal antireovirus serum as a positive control. NH4Cl (25 mM) was added to L cells at the indicated times after adsorption with equivalently infectious concentrations of rsT3SA+. rsT3SA+ 1 N182A virus was less sensitive than rsT3SA+ to neutralization by 9BG5 at the lowest antibody concentrations. rsT3SA+ and all of the coiled-coil-to-body transition mutants were equivalently sensitive to NH4Cl at all times of addition. mutant viruses encapsidate 50% (rsT3SA+ 1 R161A and rsT3SA+ 1 N182A) or 30% (rsT1L 1 R161A,N182A) of the amount of 1 encapsidated by the parental rsT3SA+ virus. agarose gel separation of reovirus particles found that the majority of rsT3SA+ particles encapsidate 8 to 12 1 trim purified reovirus particles (2.5 1011) were resolved by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel and visualized by colloidal Coomassie staining. individual bands on the gel correspond to particles that differ in the numbers (0 to 12) of encapsidated 1 trimers. expression levels of the mutants were substantially reduced in comparison to those of the wild-type construct. chymotrypsin treatment of T3D increases its capacity to agglutinate red blood cells. this phenotype likely results from increased accessibility of the carbohydrate-binding site in the 1 body domain following conformational rearrangement, which would enhance red blood cell cross-linking. virions (V) or ISVPs (I) were serially diluted, incubated with a 1% suspension of human erythrocytes at 4\u00b0C for 4 h, and scored for HA. results are expressed as mean log2 HA titers for two replicates from each of two independent experiments. a kink of up to 90\u00b0 near the midpoint corresponds to the transition between the coiled-coil and body domains. the conformational heterogeneity of the protein was therefore attributed to a high degree of flexibility at the midpoint, with implications for function. we think that these kinks are most likely caused by the relatively harsh sample preparation. coiled-coil-to-body transition mutants display increased resistance to NA treatment of L cells. mutations do not preclude 1 conformational rearrangement during virion-to-ISVP conversion, at least not when they are introduced individually. it is unclear whether the chloride ions and the conserved stutter contribute to 1 conformational rearrangements that occur during entry. based on a lack of severe replication defects observed for reoviruses with alterations in these features, they appear to be nonessential for the function of 1 in viral infection, at least in cell culture. the structure of the avian reovirus functional equivalent to 1, the C protein, has been resolved but lacks more than 100 N-terminal residues. the structure of the coiled-coil and the triple -spiral repeats of C is separated by a zinc ion-containing flexible linker. the adenovirus fiber does not contain any -helical coiled-coil motifs. the adenovirus fiber is hypothesized to undergo a large conformational change, from a more contracted to a fully extended trimer, during virus entry. cDNA encoding amino acids 29 to 159 of T1L 1 was cloned into pET16b using the NcoI and BamHI restriction sites. two additional amino acids (Met and Ala) are present at the N terminus due to the cloning procedure. cDNA encoding amino acids 25 to 291 of T3D 1 was cloned into pET28b (Novagen) using the NheI and HindIII restriction sites. a stop codon was introduced via site-directed mutagenesis. the protein was purified by Ni affinity chromatography (His-Trap FF column; GE Healthcare), followed by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200; GE Healthcare) in a solution containing 40 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and 150 mM NaCl. plasmids of the T1L 1cc_body and T3D 1cc_body genes, respectively, were altered by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis crystals of T1L 1cc, T1L 1cc_body, and T3D 1cc_body were obtained in 35% (vol/vol) 1,4-dioxane at 4\u00b0C by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. the protein crystallized as small needle clusters in a solution containing 40% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) and 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.0) at 4\u00b0C Molecular replacement with coordinates of T1L 1cc was used to solve the phase problem of T1L 1cc_body and T3D 1cc_body with Phaser (CCP4 suite) manual model building and structural refinement were conducted in alternating cycles by using COOT (46), PHENIX (47), and autoBUSTER (48). d was used as a template to engineer pBacT7-S1T1L N38V,N94V. pBacT7-S1T3SA+ S1 VTSI, pBacT7-S1T3SA+ S1 +QST, pBacT7-S1T3SA+ S1 R161A, pBacT7-S1T3SA+ S1 N182A recombinant virus strain was purified by a plaque assay using L cells. titers were determined by a plaque assay using a plaque assay using L cells. inocula were removed, and cells were washed and incubated in fresh medium at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. reovirus proteins were detected by incubation with polyclonal reovirus antiserum at a 1:500 dilution in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 at 37\u00b0C, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled secondary IgG and 4\u2032,6-diamidin reovirus particles were boiled in sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE in a 4 to 20% mini-Protean TGX precast protein gel (Bio-Rad) membranes were blocked in Odyssey blocking buffer for >1 h at room temperature and then incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight in Odyssey blocking buffer. membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit IRDye680LT antibodies and anti-mouse IRDye800CW antibodies diluted 1:15,000 in PBS-T plus 5% nonfat dry milk at room temperature for >1 h. the integrated protein band fluorescence for 1 was divided by that for 1C to normalize the results. cDNA encoding amino acids 29 to 159 of T1L 1 was cloned into pET16b using the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. two additional amino acids are present at the N terminus due to the cloning procedure. a cDNA encoding amino acids 25 to 291 of T3D 1cc_body was cloned into pET28b (Novagen) the protein was purified by Ni affinity chromatography (His-Trap FF column; GE Healthcare) crystals of T1L 1cc were obtained in a solution containing 20% polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000), 0.1 M N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid (CAPS) and 0.2 M NaCl at 4\u00b0C by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. for an experimental phasing approach, the protein was denatured and refolded in an iodide-containing buffer to exchange ( three-dimensional crystals grew after several weeks in a solution containing 40% MPD, 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.0) and 3% (wt/vol) 1,6-diaminohexane. SDS-PAGE analysis of dissolved crystals revealed that the protein was partly degraded over time. 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) and 25 ng/ml amphotericin B (Sigma-Aldrich) were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (Gibco) supplemented to contain 10% FBS (Gibco), 2 mM l-glut pBacT7-S1T3SA+ S1 R161A,N182A, and pBacT7-S1T3SA+ S1 R161A,N182A were cotransfected with 1.8 g each of nine plasmid constructs representing the T1L reovirus genome. recombinant viruses were isolated by plaque purification using L cells. monoclonal antibodies specific for T1L (5C6) (52) and T3D (53) 1 proteins were obtained and purified as described previously (30). chymotrypsin (Sigma) (51) was obtained and purified as described previously (30) images were captured for four fields of view per well by using an ImageXpress micro XL automated microscope imager (Molecular Devices). total numbers and percentages of infected cells were quantified by using MetaXpress high-content image acquisition and analysis software (Molecular Devices). effect of receptor blockade on reovirus infectivity was tested by incubating virions at particle concentrations that yielded approximately 80% infected cells per well. virus virions (2.5 1011) were diluted into 2.5% glycerol and 0.025% bromophenol blue in TAE buffer (40 mM Tris acetate, 1 mM EDTA [pH 8.0]) reovirus particles containing between 0 and 12 1 trimers were visualized by staining with PageBlue protein-staining solution (Thermo Scientific) purified virions or ISVPs were distributed into wells of 96-well U-bottom microtiter plates (Costar) at an initial concentration of 2.5 1010 particles/well and serially diluted 1:2 in 50 l PBS. type O human erythrocytes were washed twice with PBS, resuspended as a 1% suspension in PBS."}
