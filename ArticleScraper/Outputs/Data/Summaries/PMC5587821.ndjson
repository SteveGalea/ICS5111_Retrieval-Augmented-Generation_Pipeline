{"summary": "powerChek MERS (upE & ORF1a) real-time reverse transcription (rRT)-PCR assays are the method of choice for diagnosis of MERS. 100 clinical specimens were simultaneously tested by using the powerChek MERS and sequencing assays. MERS cases are routinely confirmed based on the detection of unique MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) RNA sequences by real-time reverse-transcription (rRT)-PCR, with confirmation by nucleic acid sequencing when necessary. the WHO recently published updated interim recommendations for MERS-CoV laboratory testing. 100 clinical respiratory specimens were collected from 100 different individuals from June to July 2015. 50 specimens were obtained from symptomatic MERS-positive patients. the remaining 50 were obtained from asymptomatic MERS-negative healthcare workers. the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene was amplified as a heterologous internal control to monitor PCR inhibition and specimen quality. a positive test result was defined as a well-defined exponential fluorescence curve that crossed the threshold 37 cycles, 38 cycles, and 35 cycles for the upE, ORF1a, and GAPDH genes. repeatability was calculated by testing duplicates of each concentration in a single run for five days using three different lots. assay specificity was evaluated with nucleic acids obtained from a diverse collection of 16 respiratory virus-positive clinical specimens and 14 other respiratory bacterial isolates. positive results in two respiratory virus panel assays: the AdvanSure RV real-time PCR Kit and the Allplex Respiratory Panel 1, 2, and 3. diagnostic performance of the PowerChek MERS assay and the RdRp and N gene sequencing assay was compared by measuring the positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) values. nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 100 different individuals from June to July 2015. 50 specimens were obtained from symptomatic MERS-positive patients. the remaining 50 were obtained from asymptomatic MERS-negative healthcare workers. the first round of RT-PCR was performed by using the primer sets described in the previous report. a second round was conducted if no product was visible by agarose gel electrophoresis after the first round.
