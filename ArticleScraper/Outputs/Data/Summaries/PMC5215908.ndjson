{"summary": "toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) infects mammals including rodents, cats, and humans. infection can be acquired by eating raw meat containing tissue cysts. acute infection can result in pregnant women transplacental transmission to the fetus and severe damage to the fetus. sfactory because serological methods are time-consuming, and false-positive results may occur due to extra-parasitic materials during parasite antigen preparation [11], and sometime cannot differentiate early infections [12]. PCR-based techniques are limited due to long reaction time and the expensive cost of the apparatus. we obtained the optimal reaction condition as the temperature of 64\u00b0C, reaction time for 1 hour, the Mg2+ and betine concentration of 3.0\u20136.0mM and 1.0 mM respectively. the method was proved to be very specific and sensitive in detecting T. gondii in DNA samples. four primers were used for the LAMP assay targeting six conserved region of the AF146527 sequence. the outer forward primer (F3), outer backward primer (B3), forward inner primer (FIP) and backward inner primer (BIP) were designed using the Primer Explorer program. plasmids were diluted 10-fold serially as 109 copies to 1 copy. tachyzoites of T. gondii RH strain harvested from the cell culture were counted on a hemocytometer and diluted as 40, 20, 15, 10, 5 and 1 tachyzoite(s) genomic DNA was extracted from 200 L sample solution with a DNA Extraction Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) the reactions were performed at least twice. 1 tachyzoite in PBS was used as a template of LAMP assay. tachyzoites were purified with a 27-gage needle syringe and a 5.0 m pore filter. tachyzoites were stored at -70\u00b0C for further use. two sets of the four primers are listed in Table 1. The LAMP reactionmixture (25 L) contained 2Lof the extracted DNA, 1.6M of primers FIP and BIP, 0.2 M of primers B3 and F3, 1 Lof BstDNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), 1.0 M betaine (Sigma-Aldrich), 1.6mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), and 2.5 L of 10buffer (New England primer sequences 529F (5\u2019-CGCTGCAGAGGAAGACGAAAGTTG-3\u2019) and 529R (5\u2019-CGCTGCAGACACAGTGCATCTGGATT-3\u2019) were selected to specifically amplify the AF146527 DNA sequence in T. gondii genome. the plasmid was inserted into pEASY-T1 Simple Cloning Plasmid (Transgene Co., China) spora caninum and Trypanosoma evansi were used to check the specificity of T. gondii LAMP assay. the reaction was set up at different temperatures from 59 to 70\u00b0C. the strongest signal was obtained when the reaction system was incubated at 63 to 64\u00b0C. the optimal temperature of LAMP reaction was selected as 64\u00b0C. the reaction needed at least 45 min, and the product reached maximum when lasted for 60 min. the proper reaction time would be 1 hour. target fragment was clearly seen (Fig 2, lane 2). it is suggested that LAMP assay with target specific primers showed high specificity in detection of T. gondii. sensitivity of the LAMP assay was analyzed by detecting the DNA amplification in conditions containing different copies of the recombinant plasmid. the turbidity increased at late as 42 min in the condition of only 10 copies of the recombinant plasmid as the template. there was no increase in turbidity even after 1h when only 1 copy of the recombinant plasmid was in the reaction system. the sensitivity of the LAMP method was also checked in conditions that the template was the genomic DNA extracted from different numbers of tachyzoites. 97.5%) of the samples were judged to be positive and negative with T. gondii. the previous 5 positive samples were all proved to be positive with Toxoplasma via AF-LAMP, RE-LAMP and Xuan-LAMP assays. fewer positives were detected via LAMP with other LAMP primers. toxo B1 primersb No. (%) with SAG1 primersb No. (%) with SAG2 primersb + + + + + + + + No. (%) with PCR + 5 (2.5) 0 5 (2.5) 0 3 (1.5) 2 (1) 1 (0.5) 4 (2) 3 (1.5) 2 (1) 3 (1.5) 2 (1) - 170 (85) 25 (12.5) 8 (4) 187 (93.5) 9 (4.5) 186 (93) 0 195 (9 LAMP reaction was lasted for different times from 15 min to 90 min. the reaction needed at least 45 min, and the product reached maximum when lasted for 60 min. the correct reaction time would be 1 hour. LAMP reaction was monitored for DNA amplification of Eimeriatenella (lane 1), toxoplasma gondii (lane 2), trypanosoma evansi (lane 3),Cryptosporidium parvum (lane 4) and Neosporacaninum (lane 5) by gel electrophoresis. only 10 copies of the recombinant plasmid as the template, the target DNA fragment would be amplified in high efficiency. the turbidity increased at late as 42 min in the condition of only 10 copies of the recombinant plasmid as the template. there was no increase in turbidity even after 1h when only 1 copy of the recombinant plasmid was in the reaction system. the sensitivity of the LAMP method was also checked in conditions that the template was the genomic DNA extracted from different numbers of tachyzoites. the PCR products of the 5 positive samples were sequenced and showed 100% identity with the target sequence. the previous 5 positive samples were all proved to be positive with Toxoplasma via AF-LAMP, RE-LAMP and Xuan-LAMP assays. however, fewer positives were detected via LAMP with other LAMP primers. the detection rate using other LAMP primers was lower than the conventional PCR. toxo B1 primersc No. (%) with SAG1 primersb No. (%) with PCR + 5 (2.5) 0 5 (2.5) 0 3 (1.5) 2 (1) 1 (0.5) 4 (2) 3 (1.5) 2 (1) 3 (1.5) 2 (1) - 170 (85) 25 (12.5) 8 (4) 187 (93.5) 9 (4.5) 186 (93) 0 195 (97.5) 0 195 (97.5) 0 195 (97.5) 0 LAMP is used for detection of toxoplasma by amplification of various T. gondii genes, as toxoplasma, as TOXO B1, TgOWP, SAG1, SAG2 and AF146527 fragment. however, almost the same reaction conditions were used for these genes or fragments except a little variation with the reaction temperature as 65\u00b0C. the lower sensitivity of B1/SAG1/SAG2-LAMP might be caused by the LAMP reaction efficiency. Xuan-LAMP showed higher sensitivity (78/91) than the conventional PCR (70/91) in the detection of T. gondii."}
