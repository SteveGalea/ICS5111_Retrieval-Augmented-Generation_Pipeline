{"summary": "Isatidis Radix (root of Isatis indigotica Fort.) is one of the most commonly used traditional Chinese medicines in China. chirality also exists in natural products, such as pestilence and seasonal toxin. enantiomers of chemical drugs may evince very different bioactivities and/or biotoxicities, so do natural products. enantiomer may be antagonistic, antagonistic or even reverse effect. enantiomers need to be prepared for tests in vivo and in vitro. all the solvents were HPLC grade and were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) all the solvents were HPLC grade and were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). for milligram SFC, ratio of modifier and flow rate were reexamined to get the best preparative efficiency. for linearity test, stock standard solution was prepared by dissolving 20.0 mg of (R)-goitrin and (S)-goitrin in 10 mL methanol. Optical rotation of the separated enantiomers was measured by a Rudolph Autopol IV polarimeter. 2.3. Chiral Stationary Phases (CSPs) were purchased from Daicel Chiral Technologies (Shanghai, China) three replicates were performed for each concentration. the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were separately determined at a signal to noise ratio (S/N) of 3 and 10. Results and Discussion 3.1. the peaks were identified by running the (R)-goitrin and (S)-goitrin standard. the elution order of (R)-goitrin and (S)-goitrin was reversed on the same column in SFC and HPLC. Chiralpak IC 4.6 250 mm column, 5 m; n-hexane/isopropanol (90 : 10, v/v); 0.8 mL/min, 20\u00b0C, UV detection 245 nm. the RSD values for intraday and interday variation were all below 3.0%. the LOD and LOQ reached ng degree, much lower than those of the NPLC method. this improvement benefited from reference wavelength compensation technique we used in data acquisition. methanol dissolved solutes into pressurized collection vessels. each was found to be greater than 99.0% pure by diode array detection. yield of the SFC preparation exceeded 90%, based on total amount of the two isomers. column temperature, flow rate, and back pressure were chosen as optimization factors. a new chiral analytical method was obtained. the total analysis time represented a tenfold increase in speed. temperature (\u00b0C) Retention time (min) Resolution S-goitrin R-goitrin 35 3.03 3.50 3.74 40 2.96 3.43 3.32 45 3.21 3.75 3.05 Table 3. Chromatographic data for separation of (R,S)-goitrin on Chiralpak IC column with different flow rate (column temperature: 35\u00b0C, concentration of ACN: 15%, and back pressure: 100 bar) linearity of calibration graphs and adherence of the system to Beer's law were validated by high value of correlation coefficient. the repeatability of sample application and measurement of peak area were expressed in terms of relative standard deviation. the RSD values for intraday and interday variation were all below 3.0%. 0.69% 0.77% Interday (n = 3) 2.49% 1.62% 1.89% 2.67% 1.71% 1.49% LOD (ng/mL) 91 97 LOQ (ng/mL) 91 97 LOQ (ng/mL) 279 313 3.3. (R)-goitrin and (S)-goitrin could be separated within 5 min, 10 times faster than the previous established NPLC method. excellent precision, linearity, LOD, and LOQ were achieved."}
