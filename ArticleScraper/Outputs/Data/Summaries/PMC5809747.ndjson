{"summary": "the Coronaviridae family is classified into the Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronavirus genera (-CoVs, -CoVs, -CoVs, and -CoVs, respectively) (2, 3). coVs have attracted widespread attention since the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) nsp1 exists only in -CoVs and -CoVs. betacoronavirus nsp1 inhibition of host gene expression has been extensively studied. but study of the mechanism of TGEV nsp1 regulation of host translation is still in its infancy. length PEDV nsp1 (residues Met1 to Gly110) was obtained. the crystal structure was determined using the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) method. each asymmetric unit contained two subunits, and the solvent content value was 36%, which might explain the good crystal diffraction. the secondary structure of PEDV nsp1 consists of two -helices (1 and 2) and six -strands (1 to 6) the six -strands form a -barrel fold flanked by -helices. the 2-helix is composed of six amino acids, making it longer than other reported coV nsp1 helices. glu14, Glu58, Lys70, and Arg107 exhibit conformation in the A chain that is different from that in the B chain. the positions of the side chains determine the size of the cavity opening toward the solvent. the cavity is also conserved in TGEV nsp1 (42). the amino acid sequence of PEDV nsp1 shared only 23% and 12% sequence identity with those of TGEV nsp1 and SARS-CoV nsp1 respectively. the sequence of PEDV nsp1 shared low homology with those of TGEV nsp1 and SARS-CoV nsp1 in this study. the sequences were aligned with ClustalW2, and the figure was prepared with ESPript3.0. despite lack of sequence homology, we sought to determine the level of similarity among the secondary structures of these nsp1 proteins. the loop between 3 and 4 is significantly shorter in the PEDV nsp1 structure. the loop between 3 and 4 is significantly shorter in the PEDV nsp1 structure. the loop between 3 and 4 is significantly shorter in the PEDV nsp1 structure.
