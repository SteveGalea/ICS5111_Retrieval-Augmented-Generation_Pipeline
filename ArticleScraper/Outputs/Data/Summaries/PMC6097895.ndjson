{"summary": "schizophrenia is a polygenic psychiatric disorder defined by a complex of positive, negative and cognitive symptoms. negative symptoms reflect the absence of an expected response such as blunted affect, anhedonia or loss of social drive. schizophrenia is thought to be a product of gene and environmental factors interacting during critical neurodevelopmental time points. atypical antipsychotics bind dopamine receptors but with less affinity and with additional blockade of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptors (Seeman, 2002). the second-generation atypical agents generally overcome some of the extrapyramidal motor side effects associated with the typical antipsychotics, but themselves can produce metabolic side effects including diabetes mellitus, weight gain and hyperlipidemia. GWAS studies identified the 6p21-6p22 chromosomal portion that houses the major histocompatibility complex/human leukocyte antigen MHC/HLA and complement C4 loci as one of the most important genetic susceptibility regions for schizophrenia. the complement C4 association is interesting because its variation in gene copy numbers may cause abnormal synaptic pruning in schizophrenia. this genetic information, coupled with decades of evidence for environmentally triggered immune risk factors and newfound functions in the brain by classic peripheral immune pathways, all point to an integral immune system role in schizophrenia. we will present the basic tenets of autoimmunity in a context that is relevant to our subsequent evaluation of autoimmunity in schizophrenia. immune system is activated, including complement and cytokine production pathways. this inflammation may contribute to a compromised BBB and allow gut-derived products, peripheral immune factors and autoantibodies access to the brain. autoimmunity is a complex condition that reflects the inability of a host to differentiate self from non-self. the autoimmune pathophysiology can occur systemically (systemic lupus erythematosus) or in organ-specific patterns (Hashimoto's thyroiditis \u2013 thyroid; type 1 diabetes mellitus \u2013 pancreas; rheumatoid arthritis \u2013 connective tissue) an imbalanced immune system where over-activated pro-inflammatory effector T cells outnumber the immunosuppressive Tregs can result in autoimmune pathologies. autoantibodies can be pathogenic through binding and inactivation of cell surface receptors and extracellular molecules and the formation of immune complexes that collect and cause tissue damage. autoantibodies generated by the mother also have the potential of affecting fetal development as part of antibody transfers across the placenta. microbial control of inflammation shifts toward a pro-inflammatory Th1, Th2 and Th17 dominance and suppression of anti-inflammatory Treg cells. microbial control of inflammation shifts toward a pro-inflammatory Th1, Th2 and Th17 dominance and suppression of anti-inflammatory Treg cells. autoimmune dysbiosis has a hypothesized role in the etiology of autoimmune-based human inflammatory bowel disorders including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. a GI disorder with an autoimmune mechanism directed against food antigens is celiac disease. autoimmune conditions of the brain can arise via injury-induced cytokine release, pathogen- and tumor-directed antibodies that are cross-reactive to brain proteins, and genes that confer a susceptibility to immune dysfunction. in spite of a varied etiology, many GI inflammation in individuals with psychiatric disorders can arise via such varied means as injury-induced cytokine release. encephalopathies are similarly characterized by an inflammatory state and the presence of antibodies directed against such brain structures as neuronal surface receptors and synaptic proteins. the CNS has long been considered an immune-privileged organ and thus impervious to processes involving peripheral immune cells. the absence of gut microbes was associated with a dysfunctional BBB. it altered myelination of cortical neurons, cognitive deficits and behavioral changes. the immune system response can take the form of adaptive immunity. the complement pathway bridges innate and adaptive immunity. C1q is a first-line antigen recognition protein that forms immune complexes with antigens bound to antibodies. C4 is found further downstream from C1q in the classic pathway and also as part of the PAMP- or DAMP-initiated lectin pathway. complement proteins functioned in synapse formation and elimination during neuronal development. autoimmunity is a complex condition that reflects the inability of a host to differentiate self from non-self. tolerance is a highly regulated process that is dually created centrally and peripherally. auto-reactive lymphocytes can escape into the systemic circulation. peripheral tolerance refers to inactivation of mature auto-reactive cells. autoimmune diseases ensue when immune tolerance is disrupted. new antigenic epitopes can be generated when pathogen-derived proteins bind to a host's cell or tissue or when self-entities undergo post-translational or pathogen-elicited modifications. autoantibodies can be pathogenic through binding and inactivation of cell surface receptors and extracellular molecules and the formation of immune complexes that collect and cause tissue damage. gut microbiome includes bacteria, viruses, archaea and fungi. bacteria, viruses, archaea and fungi comprise a functional system. microbes and downstream products also have important immune-modulatory roles. dysbiosis has a hypothesized role in the etiology of autoimmune-based human inflammatory bowel disorders including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. microbial control of inflammation shifts toward a pro-inflammatory Th1, Th2 and Th17 dominance and suppression of anti-inflammatory Treg cells. celiac disease is characterized by a hypersensitivity autoimmune reaction directed against a wheat gluten antigen combined to an enzyme necessary for its metabolism, tissue transglutaminase, in individuals with a genetic predisposition. a psychiatric comorbidity is being recognized in individuals with autoimmune GI disorders. autoimmune encephalopathies are similarly characterized by an inflammatory state and the presence of antibodies directed against such brain structures as neuronal surface receptors and synaptic proteins. the CNS has long been considered an immune-privileged organ and thus impervious to processes involving peripheral immune cells. lymphatic vessels lining the dural sinuses and connecting the CSF with deep cervical lymph nodes were found in these vessels. inflammation renders the BBB more permeable and therefore, there are likely numerous autoimmune conditions that are accelerated when a BBB has been inappropriately breached. systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by systemic autoimmune symptoms that result from tissue injury in multiple organs due to high levels of immune complex deposits. C1q is a first-line antigen recognition protein that forms immune complexes with antigens bound to antibodies. complement proteins functioned in synapse formation and elimination during neuronal development. the subsequent identification of C4-related polymorphisms as genetic risk factors for schizophrenia has potentially important implications for autoimmune studies of schizophrenia. the subsequent identification of C4-related polymorphisms as genetic risk factors for schizophrenia may represent a nexus molecular pathway by which genetic and environmental etiologies for the disorder can be reconciled. a similar dysregulation of adaptive and cellular immunity is increasingly demonstrated in schizophrenia. early records examining the associations between autoimmune disorders and schizophrenia document the discovery of an inverse correlation in prevalence between rheumatoid arthritis and schizophrenia. this relationship was also more recently replicated. autoimmunity can occur at least in part when the gut is dysbiotic. an intestinal origin for autoimmunity also reconciles numerous risk factors for the development of schizophrenia, which in turn supports the existence of a gut-brain connection. pathogen exposures have been posited as an autoimmune risk factor for the development of schizophrenia. pathogen exposures were associated with a decrease in cognitive function and progressive gray matter loss. the focus of this review is on identifying autoimmune conditions in people with schizophrenia with a direction toward identification of new treatments. however, there is also a large literature base about prenatal exposures to specific microbes and to the infectious disease process as a risk factor for the future development of schizophrenia. only in recent years has this connection been regarded in the context of the parasitic pathogen, T. gondii. in a mouse model, we demonstrated extensive T. gondii-generated complement activation in brains in the vicinity of the parasite. in a recent translational study, we found parallel increases in mice and humans of autoantibodies directed against the NMDA receptor in those who had been exposed to the parasite. in most cases, the source of this inflammation in these studies is not known. it is evident in the form of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine dysregulation, disrupted tryptophan and kynurenine metabolism, exposure to microbial pathogens and antigens. a study of twins with schizophrenia implicated peripheral expression of complement genes C5 and SERPING1 with cortical thinning. chronic peripheral inflammation also has brain effects and was associated with cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. a logical source of this inflammation derives from a gut microbiome that is imbalanced. people with celiac disease have an intolerance to wheat gluten. when ingested causes the body to launch an autoimmune attack. gluten antibodies have also been shown to bind synapse-related brain proteins. antigliadin antibodies were found to predict brain inflammation as measured via proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. GI disturbances related to mental illnesses are recorded as early as the first and second centuries. GI disturbances related to mental illnesses are recorded as early as the first and second centuries. a pre-antipsychotic era study of post mortem tissue reported 50\u201392% of the schizophrenia group had extensive bowel inflammation. in our studies, food antigen exposures, yeast exposures and bacterial dysbiosis are all entities that contribute to GI-related inflammation in individuals with schizophrenia. in the oropharyngeal microbiome, species of lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacilli and Bifidobacterium, were more abundant in schizophrenia compared to controls. levels of the viral phage, Lactobacillus phage phiadh, were also altered in schizophrenia compared to controls. autoantibodies generated in the inflammatory gut environment may predispose to autoimmunity. an intestinal system in flux may predispose to autoimmunity by means of a wide array of neurotransmitter targets found in the enteric nervous system that are identical to those found in the brain. pamine D2 receptors, mu-opioid receptors, serotonin receptors, AMPA receptors, glutamate receptors, gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, glutamate receptors, gamma-Aminobutyric acid decarboxylase, and potassium channel receptors. these studies also highlight other brain-related entities that may be regulated by autoantibodies including neuregulin-2, human end anti-NMDA receptor antibodies and other brain-directed antibodies were found to be present in multiple non-psychiatric control groups. infection may be a potent agent of both barrier permeabilization and autoantibody generation. the enteric nervous system is equipped with much the same extensive array of neurotransmitter receptors that are found in the brain. a large repertoire of work in rodents documents the role of maternal immune activation as detrimental to fetal brain biochemistry. q levels were significantly correlated with gluten, HSV-2 and adenovirus. autoantibodies to contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) have been isolated from mothers of children with neurodevelopmental disorders. the presence maternally of autoantibodies to important brain proteins may be a very tangible threat to the developing fetus. the focus of this review is on identifying autoimmune conditions in people with schizophrenia with a direction toward identification of new treatments. there is also a large literature base about prenatal exposures to specific microbes and the infectious disease process as a risk factor for the future development of schizophrenia. ka et al., 2008; Ellman et al., 2009; Estes & McAllister, 2009; Mortensen et al., 2010; Xiao et al., 2009; Xiao et al., 2009; Xiao et al., 2009; Xiao et al., 2009; Xiao et al., 2009; Xiao inflammation Just as schizophrenia is not a classic autoimmune disorder, it is also not a classic inflammatory disorder. in most cases, the source of this inflammation in these studies is not known, but it is evident in the form of pro- and anti-inflammatory dysregulation. regulation of proinflammatory cytokines associated with schizophrenia and particularly of IL-6, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha compared to controls. those patients receiving antipsychotic medication showed significantly decreased levels of IL-6 and IFN gamma suggesting an immunosuppressive effect of these drugs. a study of twins with schizophrenia implicated peripheral expression of complement genes C5 and SERPING1 with cortical thinning. chronic peripheral inflammation also has brain effects and was associated with cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. a logical source of this inflammation derives from a gut microbiome that is imbalanced. ivassiliou et al. hypothesized this connection between gluten exposure and psychiatric disorders. psychiatric hospitalization rates in Europe strongly correlated with the amount of wheat consumption, which varied considerably during and immediately after World War II. GI disturbances related to mental illnesses are recorded as early as the first and second centuries when Hippocrates and later Galen advocated the practice of treating the gut in order to improve brain function. interest in this topic has resurfaced periodically, especially starting in the 19th century. GI inflammation produces an environment that has deleterious effects on the gut vasculature barrier. gut-derived inflammation can be the product or source of a gut microbiome that is out of balance. the gut microbiome itself has not been extensively studied in schizophrenia. a study of the fecal microbiome also pointed toward elevations of Lactobacillus bacteria in individuals with first episode psychosis compared to controls. these levels were related to the severity of psychotic symptoms and response to treatment. microbial dysbioses are putatively prevalent in schizophrenia. a recent meta-analysis recorded a significant elevation of 20 different autoantibodies in schizophrenia compared with controls. autoantibodies directed to a number of brain proteins have been examined, and particularly but not exclusively, the target has been the neurotransmitter receptors. NMDA receptor hypofunction has been a longheld hypothesis for schizophrenia etiology. positive associations of NMDA receptor autoantibodies and schizophrenia have not been uniformly replicated suggesting the possibility that autoantibody presence may not be solely disease associated. infection may be a potent agent of both barrier permeabilization and autoantibody generation. other infectious disease agents may also produce autoantibodies, including HIV. the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor represents an interesting target. a study of the birth registry showed elevated gluten antibodies in mothers whose children went on to develop psychosis as adults. maternal C1q levels were significantly correlated with gluten, HSV-2 and adenovirus. findings support a neurodevelopmental role for maternal immune activation. ed in offspring with significant microglial activation, synaptic loss, structural insufficiencies of the cortex and hippocampus and behavioral abnormalities. the presence maternally of autoantibodies to important brain proteins including complement and neurotransmitter receptors may be a very tangible threat to the developing fetus. the immune system has many complexities that when dysregulated can result in an autoimmune state. the effects of minocycline in schizophrenia may not be solely a result of its direct anti-microbial activity. other antibiotics such as azithromycin and d-cycloserine have been tested. anti-protozoal agents No clinical trials have demonstrated a change in psychiatric symptoms or cognition with therapy aimed to treat T. gondii infections. anti-inflammatories Because inflammation has been documented in many individuals with schizophrenia, it is possible that anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapy may be beneficial. celecoxib administered as an adjunct to antipsychotic agents also resulted in improvement of symptoms/cognition compared to risperidone alone. this benefit was not confirmed in two meta-analyses of anti-inflammatory agents (Nitta et al., 2013; Sommer et al., 2014), but appeared efficacious in improving psychotic symptoms in first-episode schizophrenia. anti-inflammatory properties were found with some variation to significantly improve psychiatric symptom severity and cognition in a variety of psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. a meta-analysis of adjunctive statin therapy in schizophrenia indicated a favorable improvement of psychiatric symptoms associated with treatment. anti-tumor necrosis factor- aided in the reduction of mucosal inflammation. trials of monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of schizophrenia are underway. trials of monoclonal antibodies are underway. prebiotics, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), probiotics, fecal transplants and various combinations thereof have been performed in experimental rodent models. results from a number of human clinical studies also show promise. probiotics have been evaluated in schizophrenia in three analyses of a placebo-controlled study. it was found that probiotics improved GI symptoms, altered IL-17-mediated immune and intestinal epithelial pathways and was associated with decreased antibody levels against the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans. the dietary avoidance of gluten is the standard treatment of celiac disease and gluten intolerance. gluten-free diets in schizophrenia in fact were found to be associated with a decreased prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies. gluten degrading enzymes are in development to treat celiac disease. autoantibodies directed against the glutamate system in schizophrenia are best exemplified by the multitude of studies that examine NMDA receptors. hypofunction of this receptor is a hypothesized mechanism underlying schizophrenia symptoms with the presence of autoantibodies. some promising research has been implicated by agents that enhance NMDA receptor function via stimulation of the glycine modulatory site (d-serine, d-cycloserine and bitopertin) the effects of minocycline in schizophrenia may not be solely a result of its direct anti-microbial activity. other antibiotics such as azithromycin and d-cycloserine have been tested in small studies. anti-protozoal agents No clinical trials to date have demonstrated a change in psychiatric symptoms or cognition with therapy aimed to treat T. gondii infections. anti-malarial compounds involving artemisinin derivatives did not show a significant effect on psychiatric endpoints in two studies. anti-microbial activity may also inhibit some of the detrimental effects of microglial activation. other antibiotics such as azithromycin and d-cycloserine have been tested in small studies with mixed results. anti-malarial compounds involving artemisinin derivatives did not show a significant effect on psychiatric endpoints in two studies. a reduction of antibodies directed to the food antigen, gluten, was found in the treatment group compared to placebo (Dickerson et al., 2011). N-acetylcysteine Oxidative stress, as evidenced by shift in balance in favor of pro- versus anti-oxidants, results in disrupted redox signaling. biomarkers of oxidative stress such as glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase are thought to reflect this disruption. statins Adjunctive pravastatin was found to significantly lower positive psychiatric scores from baseline to 6 weeks. a trend toward some benefit in symptom reduction was also observed for simvastatin and the serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, ondansestron. therapeutic strategies have focused on inhibiting complement activation. this pathway has been primarily successful with targets in the terminal pathway. the anti-C5 antibody, eculizumab, has favorable safety and effectiveness results. N-acetylcysteine Oxidative stress, as evidenced by shift in balance in favor of pro- versus anti-oxidants, results in disrupted redox signaling. biomarkers of oxidative stress such as glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase are thought to reflect this disruption. statins Adjunctive pravastatin significantly lower positive psychiatric scores from baseline to 6 weeks. a trend toward some benefit in symptom reduction was also observed for simvastatin and the serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, ondansestron. targeted development of complement inhibitors for autoimmunity are in progress. progress may be made toward therapeutics that will improve psychiatric symptoms and cognition. a diet enriched with fiber in conjunction with SCFAs may improve immune outcomes that are dysregulated in schizophrenia. the Mediterranean diet may also improve intestinal permeability with the SCFAs propionate and butyrate, and the polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids. probiotics did not deliver a benefit for improvement of residual psychotic symptoms. an impact on psychiatric symptoms was suggested only in those who did not have evidence of a C. albicans infection. an endogenous serine protease inhibitor, elafin, has been shown to normalize inflammation and restore intestinal barrier function. in mice, an endogenous serine protease inhibitor, elafin, has been shown to normalize inflammation and restore intestinal barrier function. some of these compounds are in beginning stages of preclinical development. reduced omega-3 levels in the blood were associated with significant cognitive impairment in individuals with schizophrenia. results from a rodent study showed that a diet enriched for the microbial metabolites acetate and butyrate increased regulatory T cell densities, improved gut barrier cohesion and reduced diabetogenic cytokines. cal transplantation involves the re-priming of a dysfunctional gut microbiome with live bacteria from a healthy donor. it is also experimentally used in autoimmune diseases and has shown promise in inflammatory bowel diseases. sevelamer is available to treat symptoms of chronic kidney disease. it binds bacterial proteins and prevents translocation from the gut into circulation. some of these compounds are in the beginning stages of preclinical development. the use of immunotherapy including steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasma exchange demonstrated promising improvements in symptoms and reductions in autoantibodies in individuals with NMDA receptor autoantibody-related psychosis. a number of moieties potentially treatable by immune-modulatory agents emerge including pathogens, inflammation, gut dysbioses, and effects from autoantibodies. the development of individualized treatments will go a long way toward reducing the enormous social and economic costs associated with schizophrenia. this work was supported by a NIMH P50 Silvio O.
