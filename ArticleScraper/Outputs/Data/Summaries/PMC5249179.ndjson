{"summary": "up to 8% of children and 5% of adults self-reported an allergy to at least 1 food [1, 2] despite the increasing prevalence of FA, therapeutic options remain limited [3, 4] no treatments have been proven to accelerate the development of oral tolerance or to provide effective protection from accidental exposure. kakkonto suppresses the occurrence of allergic symptoms in a murine FA model [21] and kakkonto induces Foxp3+ CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the colon as a novel mechanism underlying the therapeutic action [22]. kakkonto may have a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of immune diseases induced by the disruption of intestinal mucosal tolerance, such as FAs. kakkonto is approved as an ethical drug by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan (MHLWJ). the quality and quantity of the ingredients of kakkonto is standardized by MHLWJ. kakkonto is composed of seven dried medicinal herbs. kakkonto (500 mg/kg) was suspended in 0.5% methylcellulose solution and administrated 1 h before each oral heated OVA challenge. mice were challenged 3 times per week by oral administration of non-heated OVA solution. the proximal colon was flushed with ice-cold saline and frozen in liquid nitrogen. the proximal colon was flushed with ice-cold saline and frozen in liquid nitrogen. real-time PCR was performed using a Takara TP800. the data are from a representative experiment that was repeated three times. one hour after the post-OIT non-heated OVA challenge, the plasma sample was collected under anesthesia. chip was scanned with a GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix) gene expression was analyzed using GeneSpring (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA, USA) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to extract significant genes, determine the gene ontology, and identify the canonical pathways associated with the differentially expressed genes. the colon was dissected into short segments and stirred at 37\u00b0C in RPMI 1640 containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.5 mM EDTA for 20 min. LP cells were isolated with an enzymatic dissociation procedure using collagenase (Wako, Osaka, Japan) r (CFSE)-labeled SpT cells (2.0 x 105) and SpDCs (2.0 x 104) were co-cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium. dilution assay and analysis of Foxp3+ T cell population were performed by flow cytometry. cells were then washed in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and permeabilized for 1 h in Fixation/Permeabilization working solution (eBioscience) all mice were kept under SPF conditions and observed approximately every day for adequacy of food, water, bedding and general overall health conditions. the quality and quantity of the ingredients of kakkonto is standardized by MHLWJ. kakkonto is composed of seven dried medicinal herbs. the main bioactive compound in kakkonto is puerarin. two weeks after the systemic priming, the mice were repeatedly given 50 mg OVA (crude ovalbumin powder; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) dissolved in water with intragastric feeding needles three times per week. kakkonto (500 mg/kg) was suspended in 0.5% methylcellulose solution. after day 40, mice were treated with kakkonto, OIT, OIT+kakkonto or placebo. one hour before each oral heated OVA challenge, kakkonto or placebo was orally administrated. the target mRNA was normalized to GAPDH mRNA as an internal control in each sample. the results were expressed as the ratio relative to the FA group average. the plasma sample was collected under anesthesia. the genechip was scanned with a GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix) the gene expression was analyzed using GeneSpring (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA, USA) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to extract significant genes, determine the gene ontology, and identify the canonical pathways associated with the differentially expressed genes. the colon was dissected into short segments and stirred at 37\u00b0C in RPMI 1640 containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.5 mM EDTA for 20 min. LP cells were isolated with an enzymatic dissociation procedure using collagenase (Wako, Osaka, Japan) CFSE-labeled SpT cells (2.0 x 105) and SpDCs (2.0 x 104) were co-cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium. proliferation of naive T cells was assayed by CFSE dilution. staining for intracellular Foxp3 was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. cells were then washed in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and permeabilized for 1 h in Fixation/Permeabilization working solution (eBioscience) combined therapy of OIT and kakkonto (OIT+kakkonto) further ameliorated allergic symptoms. treatment with kakkonto alone did not inhibit allergic diarrhea. IT and OIT+kakkonto had no effects on the increased level of OVA-specific plasma IgE and IgG1 in FA mice. the segment of the proximal colon was obtained 1 h after the non-heated OVA challenge. mMCP-1 concentration in plasma (Normal n = 5, FA, OIT and OIT+kakkonto n = 20, *P0.05, ***P0.001) mMCP-1 positive mucosal mast cells in the proximal colon (n = 5, *P0.05, ***P0.001) Combined therapy of OIT and kakkonto further increases Foxp3+ CD4+ regulatory T cells in the lamina propria Flow cytometry analysis showed that OIT significantly increased the genes that were differentially expressed in OIT+kakkonto were shown to be involved to a large extent in the canonical pathway of the biosynthesis and degradation of RA. RA can enhance the conversion of naive CD4+ T cells into Foxp3+ Tregs. -binding protein CRABP1 downregulated in OIT+kakkonto. no differences were observed in mRNA expression of ALDH1A1. RA significantly elevated the proportion of Foxp3+ CD4+ Tregs in a dose-dependent manner. OIT, OIT and kakkonto combined therapy (OIT+kakkonto), kakkonto alone (kakkonto) or placebo (FA) one hour after the non-heated OVA challenge on day 49, the severity of allergic diarrhea was assessed. OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 levels in the plasma were measured using an ELISA 1 h after the non-heated OVA challenge. Combined therapy of OIT and kakkonto further suppresses the degranulation of mucosal mast cells. combining therapy of OIT and kakkonto significantly increased the population of Foxp3+ CD4+ Tregs only in the LP and not in the MLN and PBLs. each sample was obtained 1 h after the non-heated OVA challenge. each value is shown as a -log P value. the threshold line corresponds to the P value of 0.05. the segment of the proximal colon was obtained 1 h after the non-heated OVA challenge on day 49. icacy of OIT is not satisfactory, and the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. some administration routes for immune tolerance induction are effective in the treatment of food allergy. however, to date, OIT is more effective in inducing tolerance than EPIT. a number of mechanisms are thought to be involved in rendering mast cells unresponsive to allergens, even in presence of allergen-specific IgE [54\u201356] kakkonto significantly enhanced the therapeutic ability of OIT by suppressing the degranulation of mucosal mast cells in OIT mice. a number of recent reports have demonstrated that RA can enhance differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into Tregs in vitro and in vivo. RA is a positive regulatory factor for the generation of Foxp3+ CD4+ Tregs in the intestine, indicating that RA is a positive regulatory factor for the generation of naive T cells. GM-CSF has been shown to suppress experimental autoimmune diseases in mice by inducing natural Tregs [69\u201373] this finding raises the possibility that GM-CSF has an additional or synergistic effect with OIT, kakkonto or OIT+kakkonto. infusion of Foxp3+ CD4+ Tregs results in decreased serum mMCP-1 levels in a FA model [75], indicating that constitutive Foxp3+ CD4+ Tregs are sufficient to modulate the efferent phase of allergic reactions mediated by mast cells. kakkonto can enforce the therapeutic effect of OIT, thus alleviating the allergic symptoms in the murine FA model."}
