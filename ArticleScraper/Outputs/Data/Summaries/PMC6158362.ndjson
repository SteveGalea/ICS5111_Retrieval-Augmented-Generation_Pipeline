{"summary": "an estimated 60% of emerging infectious diseases are caused by pathogens which originate from a non-human animal source, referred to as zoonoses (1\u20133) the frequency of outbreaks caused by zoonotic pathogens has been increasing over time in the human population. phylogenetic analyses have also been used to investigate viral origins. virus has been isolated from Rousettus aegyptiacus fruit bats. it suggests that R. aegyptiacus is a reservoir host of this filovirus (11) the related ebolavirus (EBOV) likely also circulates in African fruit bats. both Old and New World bats carry diverse hepadnaviruses. some of them are related to hepatitis B virus and can infect human hepatocytes. the preponderance of links between bat and human pathogens has led to a debate. all pathogenic viruses that have genomes encoded by RNA jump across species boundaries more frequently. so far only one RNA virus studied which circulates in a bat population has been shown to consistently cause significant morbidity and mortality. rhabdoviruses may also cause disease in bats, although experimental infection outcome is very dependent on the infection route. bats seem to be frequent hosts for RNA viruses, but current available data indicates that primates and humans disproportionately harbor DNA viruses such as herpesviruses. it may even be the case that persistent DNA viruses in humans impact immune responses specifically to RNA viruses. bats live significantly longer than similarly-sized terrestrial mammals. their weights range from 2 grams to 2 kilograms, with respect to longevity bats group with large mammals such as humans and non-human primates (45). genetic analyses of several bat species have shown differences in the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) axis which in humans is associated with aging, resistance to diabetes and cancer (52). survival in bats has been historically difficult to identify, as this requires tracking individuals over many years. diversgent species that inhabit the same type of environment often use the same form of echolocation. echolocation can result in the production of droplets or small-particle aerosols of oropharyngeal fluids, mucus, or saliva, thus facilitating virus transmission among bats in the same habitat. genetic analysis of both micro- and megabat species revealed an enrichment of genes specific to the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. 4.9% of nuclear-encoded and 23% of mitochondrial OXPHOS genes have evidence of positive selection in bats. genetic analysis of a closed society of Bechstein's bats revealed extraordinarily high conservation of mitochondrial DNA and relatively low conservation of mitochondrial DNA. mating patterns of temperate-zone species may allow transmission of pathogens between colonies via traveling males. more insular females may allow viruses to persist throughout generations within a colony. bats represent a potential opportunity for long-term persistence of viruses within a population and across generations. a 19-year study of a colony of bechstein's bats showed that unlike terrestrial mammals, survival could not be predicted by common indicators such as season, age, and body size. however, even the oldest female bats were reproductively capable, indicating that bat survival is primarily affected by catastrophic natural events rather than factors that normally dictate an individual's fitness. phylogeny groups two echolocation-reliant microbat species with megabats. pteropodids have adaptations that enhance visual acuity at night. echolocation can result in the production of droplets or small-particle aerosols of oropharyngeal fluids, mucus, or saliva. bats are extremely social creatures that tend to form dense roosting colonies (63), and almost all temperate-zone species live in closed societies with very little infiltration of foreign bats into established roosts (63, 64). female bats form maternity colonies in which males do not take part. forming closed societies limits invasion of new pathogens, thereby protecting colony members that would otherwise be vulnerable to infection. DNA analysis of a closed society of Bechstein's bats revealed extraordinarily high conservation of mitochondrial DNA and relatively low conservation of nuclear DNA. it is possible that mating patterns of temperate-zone species may allow transmission of pathogens between colonies via traveling males. e genome studies have confirmed that critical components of the innate and adaptive immune system are conserved in bats at the gene level. the only family of genes lost entirely in all of them are PYHIN genes (69) members of the PYHIN family are DNA sensors capable of recognizing foreign DNA, including DNA viruses and damaged self DNA. cell culture assays with bat cell lines, or primary bat cells, have been used to assess whether bats are permissive for viral replication. however, it is important to note that in some instances immortalized cells can behave differently from primary cells and that such cultures may miss additional differences imposed by changes in cell localization, cell recruitment or cell-cell interactions in a whole animal. pteropid bats have been identified as the natural reservoirs for the deadly Hendra and Nipah viruses (86) in australia, all four species of pteropid bats (Pteropus bats) have been identified as the natural reservoirs for the deadly virus. lecto, P. poliocephalus, P. scapulatus, and P. conspicillatus have antibodies to Hendra virus. only pteropus spp. occurring in Malaysia have been found to be seropositive for Nipah virus neutralizing antibodies. experimental infections of pteroid bats with Hendra virus result in sub-clinical infection with short periods of virus replication and shedding. viral genome was detected in a throat swab at 4 dpi and a rectal swab of the same individual at 8 dpi. virus was undetectable in tissues collected at post-mortem from all individuals (49, 50, or 51dpi), consistent with a short period of viremia. antibody titres were low in all P. vampyrus bats (91) OBECs interfere with the replication of retroviruses by deaminating cytosine residues in nascent retroviral DNA. this is notable, as bats are an important source of mammalian retroviruses. APOBEC diversification may have occurred to counteract the effect of retroviruses. both type I (IFNA and IFNB) and III (IFNL) IFNs are detectable in bat cells. constitutive expression of mRNA for IFNA and the signaling molecule, IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) may allow bats to respond more rapidly to infection, thus avoiding the lag time between pathogen detection and response. membrane protein, STING, is involved in induction of type I IFN by cytosolic DNA (105). the protein is involved in induction of type I IFN by cytosolic DNA (105) cGAS is produced following sensing of cytosolic DNA by cGAS. experimental infections of R. aegyptiacus seem to confirm that it is a reservoir for EBOV, but is unlikely to be the source of EBOV spillover to humans. subcutaneous EBOV infection results in very low viral replication, no viremia, little dissemination to other tissues, and no viral shedding. viremia was cleared by day 13 and oral shedding ceased by day 19. pteropus bats showed no detectable viral replication or shedding. no constitutive expression of type I IFNs has been detected in R. aegyptiacus. innate immune genes in humans have also been under positive selection. NK cells are important immune cell players in an antiviral response. these genomic data provide some interesting hypotheses to be tested in the future. some additional studies probing the induction of cytokines upon stimulation of bat cells. low levels of TNF induction have also been associated with tolerance in european bank voles which are a natural reservoir for Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) low levels of TNF induction have also been associated with tolerance in european bank voles. all four species of pteropid bats (P. alecto, P. poliocephalus, P. scapulatus, and P. conspicillatus) have antibodies to Hendra virus. only P. alecto and P. conspicillatus are considered to be the primary reservoir hosts (14, 92, 93) viral genome was detected in a throat swab at 4 dpi and a rectal swab of the same individual at 8 dpi. virus was undetectable in tissues collected at post-mortem from all individuals. pteropus alecto was among the first bat species to have its genome described in detail. APOBECs interfere with the replication of retroviruses by deaminating cytosine residues in nascent retroviral DNA. this is notable as bats are an important source of mammalian retroviruses. APOBEC diversification may have occurred to counteract the effect of retroviruses. both type I (IFNA and IFNB) and III (IFNL) IFNs are detectable in bat cells. constitutive expression of mRNA for IFNA and the signaling molecule, IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) in unstimulated tissues and cells. the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein, STING, is involved in induction of type I IFN by cytosolic DNA (105) the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein, STING, is involved in induction of type I IFN by cytosolic DNA (105) experimental infections of R. aegyptiacus seem to confirm that it is a reservoir for EBOV, but is unlikely to be the source of EBOV spillover to humans. experimental MARV infection of R. aegyptiacus resulted in acute viremia that peaked on days 5\u20136 post-infection. pteropus bats showed no detectable viral replication or shedding. no constitutive expression of type I IFNs has been detected in R. aegyptiacus. a number of genes in the type I IFN pathway show signs of being under positive selection. NK cells are important immune cell players in an antiviral response. these genomic data provide some interesting hypotheses to be tested in the future. knockdown of c-Rel transcripts significantly increased basal levels of TNF transcripts in E. fuscus cells (104) low levels of TNF induction have also been associated with tolerance in European bank voles which are a natural reservoir for Puumala hantavirus. psychrophilic fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans (formerly Geomyces destructans) causes no mass mortality in European bats despite being abundantly detected. a single P. destructans genotype was introduced to North American bat species from Europe (125) infected bats exhibit overt wing damage and corresponding neutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltration (131) hibernation does not preclude a localized immune response to P. destructans at the site of infection. however, the observed immune responses likely occur during arousal periods, which are more common in infected bats. post-mortem examinations of 500 dead bats from 19 species from germany revealed inflammatory lesions. many of them had evidence of underlying bacterial or parasitic infections, particularly in the lung (138). innate immune responses are also evident in sooty mangabeys. despite the ability of bats to avoid disease associated with viral infection, this trait does not extend to all pathogens. despite the ability of bats to avoid disease associated with viral infection, this trait does not extend to all pathogens. however, the pathways associated with the control of other pathogens have not been under the same selection pressures as those responsible for controlling RNA viruses."}
