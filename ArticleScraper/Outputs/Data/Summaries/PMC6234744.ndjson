{"summary": "amendments from Version 1 Revisions have been made to the manuscript based on reviewers' comments. in the results section, we have added information to highlight there was no significant difference between species A and C (predominant species) for most clinical signs reported, except for nasal discharge (p0.004) and difficulty in breathing (p0.019). in addition, we have also added a column on supplementary Table 1 to this effect. HRVs fall under the genus Enterovirus (HEVs) in the family Picornaviridae 12. their genome occurs as a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA molecule of approximately 7.2 kb flanked by a 5\u2019 untranslated region (UTR) and 3\u2019 poly-A tail. a recently published study 30 described the epidemiology of respiratory viruses in coastal Kenya through surveillance of acute respiratory infection presentations at outpatient facilities spatially structured across the well-defined population of the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS) the study was undertaken within Kilifi County in Coastal Kenya, at nine health facilities. informed consent was sought from participants or their caregiver. patients were excluded if presenting with one or more of the following symptoms. a maximum of 15 participants were recruited per facility per week. diagnostic PCR was performed to confirm the presence of HRV genetic material using real-time RT-PCR. forward primer (TGGACAGGGTGTGAAGAGC), reverse primer (CAAAGTAGTCGGTCCCATCC) and probe (VIC-TCCTCCGGCCTGAATG-TAMRA) targeting the 5\u2019 UTR using the following thermocycling conditions. Purified PCR products were sequenced using Big Dye Terminator 3.1 chemistry. followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 1 minute. final incubation/extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes. the null hypothesis of independent random HRV type detection was tested using the MATLAB v9.4 fitglme function. the orange implementation of MDS includes a pairwise similarity network linking all points whose high-dimensional similarity is close compared to the typical similarity between any two data-points. study design Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples and demographic data were collected from patients presenting with ARI symptoms at the nine selected health facilities within the KHDSS between December 2015 and November 2016 inclusive. the KHDSS area has 21 public health facilities operating under the Kenya Ministry of Health. laboratory procedures Viral RNA was extracted from each sample using QIAamp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, California, USA, Catalog number: 52906) PCR was performed to confirm the presence of HRV genetic material using real-time RT-PCR with the following primers and probes. thermocycling conditions were set as follows: reverse transcription of the RNA to cDNA at 50\u00b0C for 30 minutes, in-activation of reverse transcriptase and activation of Taq polymerase at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes. this followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 1 minute, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 1 minute and strand extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 min and final incubation/extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes statistical comparison of demographic characteristics and clinical features in HRV species was conducted using chi square test of association. chi square test of association and Fisher\u2019s exact test were generated in R 3.5.1. null hypothesis was that HRV types circulate independently of each other. a total of 5750 participants were recruited and NPS samples collected from 5744 (99.9%) participants. HRV was detected in 1057 (18.5%) of the samples tested. 240 (22.7%) samples either totally failed amplification or had short consensus sequences recovered. clinical presentations differed significantly between typed HRV samples for nasal discharge (p 0.012) and difficult breathing (p 0.022) there was no significant (p 0.05) difference between species A and C (predominant species) for most of the clinical signs reported. yrs 125 (11.83) 94 (11.51) 38 (40.43) 6 (6.38) 50 (53.19) 10\u201315yrs 57 (5.39) 38 (4.65) 16 (42.11) 3 (7.89) 19 (50) >15yrs 199 (18.83) 152 ( 18.6) 81 (53.29) 15 (9.87) 56 (36.84) HRV-A, ( b) HRV-B, ( c) HRV-C circulated throughout the study period as shown in Figure 2A. all HRV species were detected in all months except in December 2015 when only A and C were detected. the month of sample collection and age of participant were the most informative predictors for determining whether an individual tested positive for any HRV type. these predictors were identified whether undetermined samples were used in the regression analysis or not. other factors considered were gender and health facility. the contingency table of type collected at each health facility reveals highly significant evidence to reject independence of type occurrence at each health facility. we measured the pairwise similarity of the type distribution at each health facility as the total absolute differences in their type occurrences shifted by the data median. 87 HRV types were identified in circulation over the twelve months. a total of 87 HRV types were identified in circulation over the twelve months. a total of 51.7% of all known HRV types were identified. the population experiences a series of new HRV infections throughout the year 21\u201323. as long as there are new introductions and exposure to new HRV-types, the population experiences a series of new HRV infections throughout the year 21\u201323. despite phylogenetic evidence for rapid spread across the KHDSS, there is highly significant evidence for variation in the distribution of HRV-types between health facilities. despite phylogenetic evidence for rapid spread across the KHDSS, there is highly significant evidence for variation in the distribution of HRV-types between health facilities. the differences in circulation periods observed among HRV-types could be as a result of stochastic differences in frequency of introduction and onward transmission of the HRV types. similar observation has been reported in 47 where simultaneous and successive epidemics caused by different HRV types contributed to HRV high incidence. the prevalence of each virus or virus type at any timepoint will reflect that circulating in the community. we observed co-circulation of the three HRV species in all nine health facilities scattered in the KHDSS area of coastal Kenya."}
