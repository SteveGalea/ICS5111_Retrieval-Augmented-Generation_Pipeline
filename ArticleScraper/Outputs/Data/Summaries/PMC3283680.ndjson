{"summary": "health system capacity across the region is likely to impact to varying degrees on pandemic mitigation operations. the findings have important implications for where (both geographically and in terms of which resource types) investment is most needed, and the potential impact of resource mobilization for mitigating the disease burden of an influenza pandemic. the capacity of health systems in low and middle income countries remains largely unstudied. understanding outbreak response capacity in low and middle-income countries is arguably of greater importance than that in developed countries. this is because many of these countries are in regions where the risk of emerging infectious diseases is highest. system resource data collected across six countries and territories were used to estimate and compare, within and across countries, the resource gaps, and potential consequences of those gaps in terms of expected mortalities. the study was conducted as part of the AsiaFluCap project (www.asiaflucap.org), the overall aim of which is to conduct health systems analyses. the model is based on a deterministic SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered/removed) model described by differential equations tracking number of people in each compartment over time. the model is based on a deterministic SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered/removed) model. treatment with antivirals and hospitalization was assumed to reduce infectious period and probability of death for severe cases. a proportion of severe cases are assumed to require mechanical ventilation, which they will receive as long as ventilators are available, otherwise these cases would die. a multivariate uncertainty analysis was conducted to approximate uncertainty. the proportion of \u201cgeneral\u201d healthcare resources within each province/district was allowed to vary between 5\u201320%. the proportion of \u201cgeneral\u201d healthcare resources within each province/district that would be available to care for pandemic influenza patients was allowed to vary between 5\u201320%. one hundred combinations of values were chosen randomly from these ranges using Latin hypercube sampling. the medians, interquartile ranges (IQR) and 95th percentile ranges of model outcomes were then calculated across the simulations. the model was coded and run in R version 2.10.1. questionnaires sent to ministries of health to capture central stockpiles. overall response rates from district health offices were more than 95% in Viet Nam and Indonesia (Jakarta and Bali), 86% in lao PDR, 72% in Taiwan, and 59% in Thailand. model parameters describing transmissibility and clinical severity were chosen based on data from the 2009-H1N1 pandemic. in a population with sufficient resources, the scenario predicts an overall attack rate of 35.6%, a clinical attack rate of 24.9%, a peak prevalence (of symptomatic cases) of 0.94%, and a case fatality rate of 0.018%. 12% of \u201cgeneral\u201d hospital resources (beds, ventilators and human resources) are available for care of pandemic influenza cases, with the remaining 88% required for maintaining essential healthcare services. the assumptions regarding resource spare capacity and oseltamivir usage were relaxed in a multivariate uncertainty analysis. we then ran the model separately for each province (Lao PDR, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, Vietnam) and district (Indonesia) a multivariate uncertainty analysis was conducted to approximate uncertainty surrounding avoidable deaths. the proportion of \u201cgeneral\u201d healthcare resources within each province/district was allowed to vary between 5\u201320%. the proportion of \u201cgeneral\u201d healthcare resources within each province/district that would be available to care for pandemic influenza patients was allowed to vary between 5\u201320%. results Resource gaps Figure 1 presents the geographical distribution of estimated resource gaps across provinces (or districts in the case of Indonesia) in each study country for the modeled pandemic influenza scenario. the biggest gaps were generally seen in Cambodia and Lao PDR, particularly when standardized by population size. Cambodia Indonesia* Lao PDR Thailand Taiwan* Vietnam No. of provinces 24 15 17 76 25 63 Oseltamivir: No. (%) of provinces with a gap 24 (100) 1 (6.7) 13 (76.5) 40 (52.6) 11 (44.0) 5 (7.9) Overall gap/surplus (excluding central stockpile) 9508.4 11449 193.1 43746.5 13189.8 63964.5 Central stockpile 31114 n/a 1445.6 5134 data on central stockpiles of oseltamivir were not available for Indonesia and Vietnam. results were comparable between Vietnam and Indonesia. only 31% and 16% of provinces predicted to have a shortage of doctors. geographical pattern of resource gaps was evident in north-eastern (and some southern) provinces. estimates of gaps in beds, ventilators and human resources were highly dependent on the spare capacity of resources assumed to be available to care for pandemic influenza patients. even in Taiwan most areas would suffer gaps in these resources for the modeled scenario. data are aggregated across provinces for Cambodia, lao PDR, Thailand, Vietnam, and across counties for Taiwan. figures 2 and 3 highlight how resource gaps could have a substantial impact on mortality rates during an influenza pandemic. a clear negative correlation was observed between estimated avoidable mortality rates and GDP per capita at country level. total funds per capita committed by donors towards avian and human influenza up to December 2009 were positively correlated with avoidable mortality rates. the overall supply of oseltamivir was estimated to be sufficient to treat all severe cases in all countries. effective mobilization of oseltamivir across administrative areas could potentially avert a significant proportion of the avoidable deaths estimated under current resource distributions. distributed in proportion to provincial population sizes, the model predicts around 30% (IQR: 21\u201341%) fewer avoidable deaths than the number predicted under the observed ventilator distribution. sensitivity analysis showed that under more severe (yet still plausible) pandemic scenarios, even Taiwan could experience substantial deaths due to shortage of hospital resources. nearly half of provinces in Taiwan were predicted to have insufficient oseltamivir supplies to treat all severe cases. but the results in Figures 1 and S1 do not account for central stockpiles which might be mobilized in the event of a pandemic. no.
