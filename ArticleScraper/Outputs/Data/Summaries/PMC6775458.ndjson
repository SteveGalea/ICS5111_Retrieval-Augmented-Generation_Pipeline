{"summary": "human and animal cases of Cryptococcus gattii have been identified in the North American Pacific Northwest (PNW) (1). initial environmental studies found widespread fungal presence in the coastal forests and parks of Vancouver Island, near Victoria, Canada (2). several studies have found the presence of the three unrelated outbreak clones in the larger PNW region. we previously described a hypothetical transport of C. gattii from eastern south american port cities (e.g., Recife, Brazil) to the PNW via contaminated ballast water due to early shipping between the regions following the 1914 opening of the Panama Canal (15) this would have established populations of the three C. gattii subtypes identified in the PNW are between 66 and 88 years old (15) the tidal waves reported in nearby Shoup Bay, AK, were reported to be 67 m high (220 ft), causing significant shoreline devastation. further to the south, the tsunamis caused significant water surges along western Vancouver Island, most notably in port Alberni. ocean environments might be contaminated from snow melt and rain runoff or from contamination from infected sea birds (2). a single report of a C. gattii-positive blue heron (17) is not shed or otherwise found in guano (18). a possible hypothesis has been the contact of ocean with contaminated air, as early air sampling studies identified the presence of ambient fungi. on 27 March 1964, the PNW coastal forests became contaminated from the tsunami water surges following the great Alaskan earthquake. local marine populations of select C. gattii strains would have caused local and wide-scale forest contamination events that would subsequently spread more naturally in wooded environments. the earliest known case of PNW C. gattii occurred nearly 30 years prior to the 1999 PNW outbreak. the only non-PNW case belonging to the PNW VGIIa clade was a single isolate obtained from Brazil in 1983. all other VGIIa isolates from outside the PNW clade originated from Brazil or elsewhere in the region. a 1964 tsunami (54 years prior to the above-described analyses) may account for the timing of these population diversification events. limited tertiary structure suggests limited subsequent evolution beyond these secondary events. some phenomenon seems to have established multiple individual sublineages that have had restricted subsequent diversification. gattii from the PNW has been shown to demonstrate long-term survival (at least 1 year) in ocean water. dozens of infected cetaceans have been found along the PNW coasts since the outset of the 1999 outbreak (1, 26, 27); more recently infected pinnipeds have been documented in the region (28) several hours after the Great Alaskan Earthquake struck, multiple waves flowed up the Alberni Inlet, cresting at 8 m and striking the port Alberni region. a scouring of medical records and archived samples has not been able to identify any cases or records. a scouring of medical records and archived samples has not been able to identify any cases or records. possible C. gattii infection occurring in the region prior to 1970. this finding comports with the timeline of environmental seeding from the 1964 tsunami. a second fluvial event in 1964 consisting of a major flood may have contributed to the establishment of C. gattii. the 1964 Great Alaskan Earthquake was the largest ever recorded in the northern Hemisphere, registering M9.2 on the Richter scale. the tidal waves reported in nearby Shoup Bay, AK, were reported to be 67 m high (220 ft), causing significant shoreline devastation. the tsunami continued south, affecting much of the coastline of western North America, even causing several deaths on the beaches of northern California. if the coastal marine environment was contaminated first, there must have been a broad-scale or continual mechanism for C. gattii to invade the coastal forest of Vancouver Island and other areas of the PNW. the ocean-first hypothesis is incorrect and the coastal lands were first contaminated, leading to subsequent coastal and ocean contamination. PNW marine coastlines developed fairly wide-scale marine C. gattii contamination in the decades after one or more initial ballast water-dumping events. this one event, like no other in recent history, caused a massive push of ocean water into the coastal forests of the PNW. the earliest known case of PNW C. gattii occurred nearly 30 years prior to the 1999 PNW outbreak, establishing a historical record in the region that matches a terrestrial emergence in the 1960s. the only non-PNW case belonging to the PNW VGIIa clade was a single isolate obtained from Brazil in 1983. all three PNW clades have been roughly estimated to be 70 to 90 years old using Bayesian statistical inference (Fig. 2) (15), providing for the \u201cTeddy Roosevelt effect\u201d hypothesis, linking the opening of the Panama Canal and subsequent shipping from Brazilian ports to the PNW as a driver of dispersal to the PNW region. dozens of infected cetaceans have been found along the PNW coasts. many Cryptococcus species are adapted to and live in marine water. multiple C. gattii VGII-specific kmer sequences were present in the multiple collected marine sample metagenomes. these findings further support the concept of long-term ocean survival of C. gattii in the region. these findings may represent continued seeding of coastal waters by contaminated soil runoff and/or dispersal of airborne yeast cells from nearby contaminated forests. a scouring of medical records and archived samples has not been able to identify any cases or records of possible C. gattii infection occurring in the region prior to 1970. additional subsequent infections may have been undetected prior to the 1999 outbreak, especially when viewed in light of the fact that cryptococcal infection can remain dormant after acquisition. the 240-km (150-mile)-long Willamette Valley is transected from Eugene to Portland by the Willamette River, which flows north and empties into the Columbia River at Portland Harbor. nearly 62,000 ha (153,000 acres) of the Willamette Valley was flooded in December 1964, in a devastating \u201chundred-year flood\u201d (46), causing significant inundation, saturation, and likely contamination of the surrounding region. many biological, geological, and sociological dynamics on our planet are likely involved in pathogen evolution and distribution and subsequent disease ecology and epidemiology. a tsunami-driven contamination of the PNW coastal landscape certainly involves numerous other biological (e.g., the ability of fungi to adapt to coastal waters and coastal climates), and other anthropogenic (e.g., transport of contaminated materials or ballast between shipping ports) dynamics that would lead to such an unforeseen emergence. a black swan event, popularized by american financial philosopher Nassim Taleb (52), is an unpredictable event of extreme consequence. it stems from an ancient thought that all swans must be white, because only white swans had ever been documented until black swans were eventually found in Australia. if true, it will have a disruptive impact on previous dispersal theories, thereby being a prototypical example of a black swan. there is an enormous effort being made with global infectious disease surveillance to identify the earliest time points of emergence of new diseases and outbreaks. significant resources are being spent for pathogen prediction model development: predicting what, when, and where diseases may emerge prior to detection. this effort is in effect looking for black swans; however, they may fail if such events are truly unpredictable. biomedical research is a model that can and should be followed globally to understand and mitigate the effects of emerging infections. at least some populations of Australian C. gattii originated in the western region (i.e., Perth) and have been anthropogenically transported via infected animals (i.e., koalas) to other parts of the continent (56). a more intensive search for new South American isolates may reveal a genetically close relative of the PNW strains. finding C. gattii in other coastal waters without a concomitant increase in cryptococcosis would support the notion that something different happened in the PNW. if C. gattii was found in coastal waters of areas that have suffered tsunamis in recent decades, this could allow real-time studies. gattii will become established in a particular locale is probably dependent on the physical and biological conditions operating in that locale. a sampling of water in other ports by deep sequencing may reveal C. gattii-specific genes, thus strengthening the case for shipborne transport. a more intensive search for new South American isolates may reveal a genetically close relative of the PNW strains. evidence for or against a tsunami-related movement from sea to land might come by careful bio-geographic analysis of land areas affected by the tidal wave. flooded areas harbor more-established sites than nonflooded lands."}
