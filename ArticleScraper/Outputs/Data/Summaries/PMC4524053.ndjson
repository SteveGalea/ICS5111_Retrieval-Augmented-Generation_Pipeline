{"summary": "coVs primarily cause respiratory and enteric diseases in humans, animals, and birds. some coVs also cause systemic diseases, including hepatitis or neurological diseases. coV S proteins contain two subunits, called S1 and S2, which are separated by a protease-sensitive amino acid sequence. S1 determines the specificity of receptor binding, while S2 mediates membrane fusion and virus entry. host-specific differences in a particular coV receptor protein can determine the viral host range (15\u201325) coV virus in group A first was discovered in 2004 (11) and has been found in humans worldwide. it accounts for 0.9% (0 to 4.3%) of acute respiratory infections (30, 31) it is estimated that the majority of children have been exposed to HKU1 before age 6 (32). the LLCMK2 cell line was maintained in Opti-MEM1 with 10% FBS and 2% PSF. primary human tracheal/bronchial epithelial (HTBE) cells were cultured and differentiated as previously reported. HTBE cells were grown in BronchiaLife complete medium with BronchiaLife B/T LifeFactors. viruses were harvested at 48 or 72 h postinoculation by rinsing apical surfaces twice with 150 l of DMEM plus 1% BSA. human coronaviruses 229E and NL63, bovine coronavirus (BCoV) Mebus strain, and MHV A59 were propagated in MRC5, LLCMK2, HRT18, and 17Cl.1 cells. S14-443, S14-294, S295-755, and S295-673 were amplified using the following primer pairs. PCR products then were inserted between NheI and BamHI sites of pIg (a kind gift of Michael Farzan, Scripps Research Institute, Florida) truncated proteins with C-terminal Fc tags were purified and detected by HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG. blots were probed with HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibody. supernatants containing Secto and truncated S proteins were harvested at 40 h and 64 h posttransfection. supernatants containing Secto and truncated S proteins were harvested at 40 h and 64 h posttransfection. the supernatant medium of each hybridoma clone was screened for the presence of antibody. antibodies to HKU1 spike protein were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blotting, and immunofluorescence assay. anti-mouse Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:1,000 and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. the reaction then was stopped by addition of 2 M sulfuric acid. BCoV infection was detected using mouse monoclonal antibody to MHV nucleocapsid protein at 10 g/ml. bound antiviral antibodies were visualized using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibodies. RT-PCR was performed using a Roche LightCycler 480 under conditions: 50\u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 95\u00b0C for 2 min and then 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 30 s. blot was blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature. dilution of passage 1 or passage 3 of HKU1 virus for 30 min at 34\u00b0C. the virus-antibody mixtures were inoculated onto the apical surface of differentiated HTBE cells and incubated for 4 h at 34\u00b0C. cells again were washed once with 150 l of DMEM plus 1% BSA. human embryonic kidney 293 cell line transformed with simian virus 40 [SV40] large T antigen. all of these cell lines were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2% penicillin, streptomycin, and fungizone (PSF) differentiated HBTE cells at the air-liquid interface were inoculated on the apical surface with 150 l per insert of each clinical sample (primary isolate) diluted 1:10 in DMEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin fraction V (BSA) or with a 1:10 or 1:100 dilution of passage 1 (P1) virus stock generated from primary cultures from HBTE cells harvested at 48 or 72 h postinoculation. arginine 759 and arginine 760 were mutated with alanine substitutions. arginine 759 and arginine 760 were mutated with alanine substitutions. truncated proteins with C-terminal Fc tags were purified and detected by HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG. blots were probed with HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibody. lane 7 was blotted with a 10-fold concentrated hybridoma supernatant. experiments were done three times, and one representative is shown. protein expression and purification of soluble HKU1-Secto and truncated HKU1 S glycoproteins. eight- to 10-week-old mice were immunized with 100 g of HKU1-Secto protein. the final injection was done with HKU1-Secto proteins with PBS instead of adjuvant. mice were euthanized, spleens harvested, and spleenocytes were fused with myeloma cells to generate hybridomas that were cloned. plates were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with either purified truncated, Fc-tagged HKU1 S proteins or 100 l of culture supernatants containing truncated, Fc-tagged HKU1 S proteins. unbound MAb was removed by washing, and MAb bound to the truncated, Fc-tagged S proteins was detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig. MHV S protein was detected with polyclonal goat anti-MHV S antibody AO4 at a 1:200 dilution. 229E and NL63 S proteins were detected with mouse monoclonal anti-NL63 S protein antibody 165. viral RNA was extracted from 140 l of virus-containing apical wash using a BioRobot from Qiagen. 10 l of viral RNA was mixed with 10 l of master mix containing 0.8 l of H2O, 1 l of enzyme, 4 l of 5 buffer, 0.2 l of 10 M probe (ATAATCCCAACCCATRAG), 1 l of 10 M primer F1 (TGGTGGCTGGGACGATATGT), 2.5 anti-human IgG (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) at a 1:2,500 dilution or with supernatant media over hybridomas cloned from mice immunized with HKU1 S protein. the bands detected by antibodies were visualized with chemiluminescence reagent plus (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA) to assess the ability of mouse MAbs to HKU1 S to neutralize the infectivity of HKU1 virus. mHKUS-1, mHKUS-2, mHKUS-3, mHKUS-4, and mHKUS-6 were selected for further study by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western blot analysis. mHKUS-1, mHKUS-2, mHKUS-3, mHKUS-5, and mHKUS-6 were selected for further study by immunofluorescence assay. HEK 293T cells expressing HKU1 S protein were fixed and stained with the indicated MAbs (undiluted hybridoma supernatants), followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. the blots were probed with either HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. mHKUS-2 mHKUS-3 mHKUS-4 mHKUS-5 mHKUS-6 IFAa HKU1 S ++++ + ++++ + + SARS S and infection MHV S and infection MERS S BCoV infection 229E infection NL63 infection Westernb S14-294aa ++++++++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++++ ++++++ cells expressing the appropriate virus receptor proteins were transduced with the indicated virus. for ELISA, ++++ indicates very strong signal; +++, strong signal; ++, weak signal; +, very weak signal;, no signal. we then tested whether any of the 6 MAbs could recognize purified, truncated, and denatured HKU1 S proteins by Western blotting. human intravenous immunoglobulin (IvIg) at 10 mg/ml effectively neutralized the infectivity of HKU1 virus from a clinical isolate. pooled human sera contain antibodies that can neutralize HKU1. mHKUS-3 antibody also reduced HKU1 virus entry. mHKUS-2 antibody reduced the yield of RNA from virus released from HTBE cells by over 20,000-fold and over 2,000-fold relative to the no-MAb control at 24 and 48 hpi. by 24 hpi, supernatant containing mHKUS-3 had reduced virus release by over 1,700-fold, but by 48 hpi, virus RNA in supernatant had increased significantly. mHKUS-1 and mHKUS-5 antibodies at 100 g/ml and mHKUS-4 antibodies at 1 g/ml, 10 g/ml, and 100 g/ml did not block HKU1 virus entry and production compared to the no-antibody control. antibody mHKUS-2 at a concentration of 1 g/ml, but not at 1 g/ml, can effectively neutralize HKU1 virus at a concentration of 1 g inhibition experiments were performed using the given amount of purified antibodies. no antibody, 1% BSA but no antibody. mHKUS-1 and mHKUS-5 served as negative controls at concentrations of 100 g/ml. all of the MAbs to HKU1 S recognized the full-length HKU1 S1 domain (S14-755aa) and the nearly full-length S1 domain, S14-673aa, in ELISA. antibody mHKUS-1 bound to S14-673aa protein significantly better than mHKUS-6. ELISAs were performed using supernatant containing indicated proteins. mHKUS-1 showed minimal binding to S295-673aa and S295-755aa. only mHKUS-1 antibody recognized S14-294aa protein. binding detected at 10 ng/ml, plateauing at around 10 g/ml. HTBE cells with purified NTD-Fc protein at 2.5 M significantly blocked HKU1 virus entry. preincubation of HTBE cells with purified C domain-Fc at 3 M significantly decreased HKU1 virus infection by IFA. inhibition effect by C domain protein was dose dependent, since C domain-Fc at 0.6 M also showed an inhibitory effect on HKU1 virus entry. mHKUS-1, mHKUS-2, mHKUS-3, mHKUS-4, mHKUS-5, and mHKUS-6 were selected for further study by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western blot analysis. mHKUS-2, mHKUS-3, mHKUS-5, and mHKUS-6 bound less strongly to cells expressing S protein. blots were probed with either HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG or the indicated MAbs (undiluted hybridoma supernatants) the experiments were repeated at least 3 times. ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++++ ++++++ ++++++++ ++++++ ++++ indicates greater than 100-fold inhibition of HKU1 virus infection. mHKUS-1 antibody bound strongly to purified S14-294aa by Western blotting. none of the 5 other MAbs showed any significant level of binding to truncated HKU1 S proteins or S proteins of other CoVs. the HKU1 virus was incubated with either human IvIg (10 mg/ml) or undiluted hybridoma supernatants of the indicated mouse MAbs for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. after removing the inocula, cells were washed and then incubated for another 48 h. infected cells were detected by IFA with polyclonal rabbit 1814 anti-HKU1 S antibody (A) the mHKUS-4 antibody caused an over 80-fold reduction on virus RNA release at 24 hpi but had no effect on virus RNA release by 48 hpi. however, small amounts of virus that escaped neutralization were able to catch up and spread through the cultures by 48 h. mHKUS-2, -3, and -4 showed no virus neutralization activity at 24 or 48 hpi. mHKUS-2 antibody concentrations of 1 g/ml and 0.1 g/ml did not significantly reduce virus entry or release of viral RNA. mHKUS-3 antibody at a concentration of 1 g/ml markedly reduced the release of viral RNA. mHKUS-3 can effectively neutralize HKU1 virus at a concentration of 1 g/ml. plasmids encode soluble, human Fc-tagged HKU1 S proteins with either N-terminal truncation (S295-755aa), C-terminal truncations (S14-755aa, S14-673aa, S14-534aa, S14-443aa, or S14-294aa) the sites selected for these sites were selected based on the alignment of HKU1 S protein with other CoV S proteins with known receptor- ELISAs were performed using purified proteins and purified antibodies. the experiments were done twice, and one representative is shown. only mHKUS-1 bound to S14-534aa, suggesting that the epitope for antibodies mHKUS-2 through mHKUS-6 are located between amino acids 535 and 673 of HKU1 S protein. binding detectable at 2.5 ng/ml and reaching a plateau at 40 ng/ml. truncated HTBE cells were purified and preincubated with HTBE cells to occupy virus receptor on the cell surface. C domain-Fc at 0.6 M also showed an inhibitory effect on HKU1 virus entry. these results strongly suggest that the HKU1 RBD is located within the C domain of the HKU1 S protein, likely between amino acids 535 and 673. coVs in group A use their NTDs to bind protein receptors or sugars. despite the fact that the MHV NTD folds like a galectin, it has evolved to bind mCEACAM1a. the galectin-like fold NTDs of BCoV and OC43 bind to 9-O-acetyl sialic acid. the purified HKU1 NTD binds to neither sugar (43) nor human carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) the NTD does not inhibit HKU1 virus entry. failure of HKU1 NTD to bind a sugar or protein receptor is particular intriguing. mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3, do not recognize denatured C domain truncated S protein well, indicating that the neutralizing epitope is conformation dependent. mHKUS-2 and mHKUS-3, do not recognize denatured C domain truncated S protein well. there are three genotypes of HKU1 viruses (A, B, and C) resulting from viral recombination events (52) there are noticeable differences between genotype A and genotype B or C, which are identical. the sequences encompassing amino acid 558 and 568 of S proteins are markedly different between genotypes A and B/C."}
