{"summary": "the study aims to determine the seroprevalence of anti\u2013SARS-CoV antibodies in a population of exposed healthcare workers who worked in wards where an outbreak occurred. if asymptomatic infection occurs in substantial numbers, the virus may continue to spread, despite the isolation of the clinically apparent cases. all 200 healthcare workers in the surgical wards quarantined or sequestered were invited to participate. three had a history of probable SARS but had recovered sufficiently to return to work. informed consent was obtained from those who wished to participate. the virus isolate used in this study, SARS-CoV 2003VA2774, has been previously sequenced (7) and was isolated from a patient in whom SARS was diagnosed. four samples tested strongly positive by dot blot ELISA, although only three were positive for neutralizing antibodies with titers of 1:60, 1:60, and 1:320. dRespiratory symptoms: cough, breathlessness, chest pain. eGastrointestinal tract symptoms: vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal colic. fMusculoskeletal symptoms: vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal colic."}
