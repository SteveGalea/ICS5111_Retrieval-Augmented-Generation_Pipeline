{"summary": "despite the fact that human NoV causes significant health, emotional, social, and economic burdens worldwide, there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs available to combat this infectious agent. development of an efficacious vaccine for human NoV has been hampered as it is not cultivable in vitro and lacks a small-animal model. volunteers that received the dry powder VLP vaccine reduced their risk of illness by 47% after exposure to human noV. there were significant reductions in clinical norovirus illness, infection, and severity of illness in individuals who received vaccine compared with those who received the placebo. heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) was chosen as a vaccine adjuvant. it has been shown to modulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. hSP70 supports presentation (and cross-presentation) of antigen peptides. construct was generated in which the luciferase gene was expressed in place of the HSP70 gene. constructs included recombinant VSVs expressing HSP70 (rVSV-HSP70) or VP1 (rVSV-HSP70-VP1) and VSV coexpressing luciferase (Luc) and VP1 (rVSV-Luc-VP1). pVSV1(+) GxxL contains SmaI and XhoI at the leader sequence and N gene junction. plasmids pVSV1(+)-VP1 and pVSV1(+)-HSP70 were cloned into pVSV1(+)GxxL. the HSP70 gene was inserted into the leader and N gene junction. the human noV VP1 gene was inserted into the plasmid pVSV1(+)-HSP70-VP1. the plasmid was designated pVSV1(+)-HSP70-VP1. BSRT7 cells were infected with rVSV, rVSV-VP1, rVSV-HSP70, rVSV-HSP70-VP1 or rVSV1-Luc-VP1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. after 1 h of absorption, the cells were washed twice with DMEM, fresh DMEM was added, and the infected cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C. two primers were designed to target the VSV G gene at position 4524 and the L gene at position 4831. another two primers were used to detect the insertion of VP1 or HSP70 genes at the G and L gene junction. the amplified products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. the HSP70 protein was detected with mouse anti-HSP70 monoclonal antibody (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) at 1:2,000, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Thermo Scientific) the blot was developed with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific) and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR film. purification of twenty-five 4-week-old specific-pathogen-free female BALB/c mice randomly divided into seven groups. mice in groups 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were inoculated with 106 PFU of rVSV, rVSV-Luc, rVSV-VP1, rVSV-HSP70, and rVSV-HSP70-VP1 respectively. mice in groups 1 and 2 were inoculated with 106 PFU of rVSV-VP1 or rVSV-HSP70-VP1. Mice in group 5 were inoculated with 50 l of DMEM and served as unimmunized controls. remaining procedure was identical to that used for animal experiment 1. grade 3 (severe) was characterized by ruffled fur, hyperexcitability, tremors, circling, and paralysis. grade 2 (moderate) was characterized by ruffled fur with neurological symptoms such as circling; grade 0 mice exhibited no symptoms. brain from each mouse was collected for virus titration by plaque assay. ninety-six-well plates were coated with 50 l of highly purified human NoV VLPs (7.5 g/ml) in 50 mM NaCO3 buffer (pH 9.6) at 4\u00b0C overnight. serum samples were serially diluted and added to VLP-coated wells. neutravidin-coated, 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 2.5 g/ml of synthetic polyvalent Lewis d (H type 1)-polyacrylamide (PAA)-biotin (Glycotech) for 1 h at 22\u00b0C. plates were washed 3 times with 0.1 mol/liter sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.4) Fecal pellets were diluted 1:2 (wt/vol) in PBS containing 0.1% Tween and a complete EDTA-free proteinase inhibitor cocktail tablet. samples were mixed twice for 30 s using a vortex device and clarified twice by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min. quantitative and statistical analyses were performed by densitometric scanning of autoradiographs or by using a Typhoon PhosphorImager and ImageQuant TL software. each experiment was performed three to six times using one-way multiple comparisons using minitab 16 statistical analysis software. a P value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. plasmid pVSV1(+)-VP1 and pVSV1(+)-HSP70-N were cloned into pVSV1(+)GxxL at the SmaI and XhoI sites. a third plasmid was constructed by insertion of the HSP70 gene into pVSV1(+) LexxN at the leader and N gene junction. BSRT7 cells were infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus (vTF7-3) expressing T7 RNA polymerase. at 96 h posttransfection, cell culture fluids were collected and filtered through a 0.2-m-pore-size filter. plasmids pN, pP, and pL were amplified in BSRT7 cells. cells were washed with methionine- and cysteine-free (MC) medium. after 1 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with MC medium. cytoplasmic extracts were prepared and analyzed by RT-PCR. BSRT7 cells were infected with rVSV, VSV-VP1, rVSV-HSP70, rVSV-HSP70-VP1 or rVSV-Luc-VP1 at an MOI of 10. at specific time points postinfection, cells were lysed in buffer containing 5% -mercaptoethanol, 0.01% NP-40, and 2% SDS. purification of human noV VLPs from insect cells using a baculovirus expression system was performed as described previously (17). the infected Sf9 cells and cell culture supernatant were harvested at 6 days postinoculation. the protein concentrations of the VLPs were measured using Bradford reagent (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). oculum was administered intranasally, and the other half was administered orally. the animals were evaluated on a daily basis for mortality, weight loss, and the presence of any symptoms of VSV infection. at 5 weeks postinoculation, all mice were sacrificed. mice in group 3 were inoculated with 106 PFU of rVSV-VP1 and 106 PFU of rVSV-HSP70. each mouse was inoculated intranasally at a dose of 106 PFU in a volume of 50 l. the remaining procedure was identical to that used for animal experiment 1. mice in groups 4 were inoculated with 50 l of DMEM and served as unimmunized controls. the remaining procedure was identical to that used for animal experiment 1. ninety-six-well plates were coated with 50 l of highly purified human NoV VLPs (10 g/ml) in 200 mM NaCO3 buffer at 4\u00b0C overnight. plates were washed five times with PBS-Tween (0.05%), followed by incubation with 50 l of goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:80,000 for 1 h. the optical density (OD) at 450 nm was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Sigma) was added and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. the signal was then developed by adding tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase liquid substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratory) total fecal IgA was determined by capturing all fecal extract IgA molecules with 1 g/ml sheep anti-mouse IgA (Sigma) the plates were incubated for 4 h at 4\u00b0C with 10% (wt/vol) dry milk\u2013PBS (10% Blotto) the level of IgA was calculated from a standard curve that was determined by the absorbance values of the mouse IgA standard (Sigma) rVSV-Luc-VP1 and rVSV-Luc genes were inserted at the G-L gene junction and the leader-N gene junction. rVSV-HSP70 contains double insertions with Luc at the leader-N gene junction and VP1 at the G-L gene junction. rVSV-HSP70 contains double insertions with rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 were 1.7 0.6 mm, 1.2 0.4 mm, and 1.6 0.3 mm, respectively, after 48 h of incubation. however, the plaque sizes for rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 were 0.8 0.4 mm and 1.1 0.5 mm, respectively, after 48 h of incubation. this result suggests rVSV-HSP70-VP1, rVSV-HSP70, and rVSV-Luc-VP1 genes were inserted at the G-L gene junction in their respective VSV genomes. for rVSV-Luc-VP1, the luciferase and VP1 genes were inserted at gene junctions between leader and N and between G and L, respectively. the HSP70 gene was amplified from rVSV-HSP70-VP1 or rVSV-Luc-VP1 using two primers annealing to the leader and N sequences. single-step growth curves of recombinant VSVs in cell culture were compared by using a single-step growth assay in BSRT7 cells. rVSV-VP1, rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 were infected with each recombinant virus at an MOI of 10. BSRT-7 cells were infected with each recombinant virus at an MOI of 10. titer was determined by plaque assay. the expression of VP1 and HSP70 by the VSV vector was determined by [35S] metabolic labeling in virus-infected cells. in rVSV-HSP70-VP1-infected cells, an additional protein band with a molecular mass of approximately 58 kDa was detected. in rVSV-HSP70-VP1-infected cells, two additional protein bands with molecular masses of 65 kDa and 58 k rVSV-HSP70, rVSV-HSP70, rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 synthesized approximately 13 times more HSP70 protein than rVSV-HSP70. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 synthesized approximately 5 times more than that synthesized by rVSV-HSP70 and rVSV-Luc-VP1. BSRT7 cells were infected with rVSV-VP1, rVSV-HSP70-VP1 or rVSV-Luc-VP1 at an MOI of 10. cell lysates were harvested at various time points using a polyclonal antibody against the VP1 protein. the VP1 expression gradually increased to 30 h postinfection. BSRT-7 cells were infected with rVSV-VP1, rVSV-HSP70-VP1 or rVSV-Luc-VP1 at an MOI of 10. Cytoplasmic extracts were harvested at indicated time points. equal amounts of total cytoplasmic lysate were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using mouse anti-HSP70 antibody. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 expression is more attenuated than rVSV-HSP70 expression in a mouse model. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 expression is more attenuated than rVSV-HSP70 expression in a mouse model. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 expression is more attenuated than that of rVSV-HSP70. the rVSV-Luc-inoculated mice showed mild clinical signs of VSV infection at days 4 to 10 postinoculation. Mice inoculated with rVSV-VP1 and rVSV-HSP70 also showed a moderate weight loss (P 0.05) at up to 8 days postinoculation. mice inoculated with rVSV-VP1 and rVSV-HSP70-VP1 triggered significantly higher serum IgG responses than mice inoculated with baculovirus-produced VLPs. mice inoculated with rVSV-Luc, rVSV-HSP70, and DMEM did not have human noV-specific serum IgG antibodies during the experimental period. groups of five BALB/c mice were inoculated with either 106 PFU of rVSV-VP1 or rVSV-HSP70-VP1 or 100 g of VLPs. data are expressed as geometric mean titers (GMT) determined for five mice. the level of vaginal IgA is shown as the ratio between human NoV-specific IgA and total IgA. the spleen was isolated from each mouse at week 5 postinoculation. the cellular immune responses were measured using a T cell proliferation assay. levels in fecal and vaginal extracts were determined by ELISA. the level of IgA response was expressed as the ratio between human NoV-specific IgA and total IgA. only two of five mice had an IgA response in the VLP vaccination groups. the level of VP1 protein produced by rVSV-HSP70-VP1 was approximately 5 times less than that of rVSV-VP1. a high dose (5 106 PFU) of rVSV-VP1 caused significantly more weight loss than a low dose (P 0.05) during days 6 to 18 postinoculation. however, no significant weight differences were seen with the two doses of rVSV-HSP70-VP1 (P > 0.05) five BALB/c mice in each group were inoculated with 106 PFU of rVSV-VP1, 106 PFU of rVSV-HSP70-VP1, or 5 106 PFU of rVSV-HSP70-VP1. body weight for each mouse was measured every other day for 5 weeks. the ability of serum antibodies to inhibit human NoV VLP binding to HBGAs was measured by an ELISA. the 50% blocking titer (BT50), defined as the titer at which the OD value was 50% of the OD of the positive control, was determined for each sample. FU of rVSV-HSP70-VP1 had significantly (P 0.05) enhanced T cell proliferative responses to norovirus antigen compared to all other vaccination groups. however, there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in T cell immune responses between mice vaccinated with 5 106 PFU of rVSV-VP1, 106 PFU of rVSV-VP1 and 106 PFU of rVSV-HSP70-VP1. level of vaginal IgA is shown as log 10 (ratio between human noV-specific IgA and total IgA) data are expressed as average titers of IgA-positive mice standard deviations. ginal IgA responses than rVSV-VP1 vaccination alone (P 0.05) no significant difference in T cell immune responses triggered by these two vaccination strategies. combined vaccination of rVSV-HSP70 and rVSV-VP1 enhanced human noV-specific mucosal immunity. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 stimulated significantly higher mucosal immunity than rVSV-Luc-VP1. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 stimulated significantly higher mucosal immunity than rVSV-Luc-VP1. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 were inoculated into mice at dose of 106 PFU. at week 5 postvaccination, serum IgG, fecal and vaginal IgA, and T cell immune responses were determined. there was no significant difference between rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 in mouse body weight changes. body weight for each mouse was evaluated every other day for 5 weeks. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 triggered significantly higher fecal and vaginal IgA levels than rVSV-Luc-VP1. data are expressed as the means of the results determined for five mice the standard deviations. mice were inoculated intranasally with 106 PFU of rVSV-VP1, rVSV-HSP70-VP1, or rVSV-Luc-VP1. at days 3 and 5 postinoculation, mice were euthanized and brain viral titers quantitated by plaque analysis. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 were significantly more attenuated in mice than rV recombinants rVSV-HSP70, rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 were inserted at the G-L gene junction and the leader-N gene junction. recombinant rVSV-HSP70 harbors the HSP70 gene at the leader-N gene junction. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 formed smaller plaques. the average plaque sizes for rVSV-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 were 1.7 0.6 mm, 1.2 0.4 mm, and 1.6 0.3 mm, respectively, after 48 h of incubation. the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05) cDNA band containing the HSP70 gene was amplified from rVSV-HSP70-VP1 using primers annealing to the VSV leader and the N gene. a 1.8-kb band (Luc) and a 1.9-kb band (VP1) were amplified from rVSV-Luc-VP1. the entire genome of each recombinant was sequenced to confirm that no additional mutations had been introduced. rVSV-Luc-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 were developed after 48 h of incubation compared to rVSV-Luc-VP1. genome RNA was extracted from each virus using RT-PCR. the VP1 gene was amplified from rVSV-HSP70 using primers annealing to the leader and N sequences. rVSV-HSP70, rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 reached peak titers of 2.5 109, 7.2 108, and 1.2 109 PFU/ml, respectively, at approximately 30 to 36 h postinfection. there is no significant difference in the growth curves for rVSV-VP1, rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 (P > rVSV synthesized five viral proteins, L, G, P, N, and M. in rVSV-HSP70-VP1-infected cells, an additional protein band with a molecular mass of approximately 58 kDa was detected. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 expressed much lower levels of VSV proteins than rVSV-HSP70. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 synthesized approximately 13 times more HSP70 protein than rVSV-HSP70. rVSV-HSP70 contains HSP70 at the leader and N gene junction. rVSV-VP1, rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 were monitored by Western blotting. the kinetics of VP1 expression by rVSV-VP1 expression by rVSV-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 were monitored by Western blotting. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 expression gradually increased to 30 h postinfection. no significant difference between rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 in VP1 expression was observed from 18 h to 30 h postinfection. BSRT-7 cells were infected with rVSV-VP1, rVSV-HSP70-VP1 or rVSV-Luc-VP1 at an MOI of 10. Cytoplasmic extracts were harvested at indicated time points. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 expression increased between 8 and 24 h postinfection. but the HSP70 level in rVSV-HSP70-VP1-infected cells was 10 to 12 times higher than that in the rVSV-HSP70-infected cells at the three time points (8, 16, and 24 h postinfection) rVSV-HSP70 protein expression level of rVSV-HSP70-VP1 was approximately 5 times mice inoculated with rVSV-Luc showed mild clinical signs of VSV infection at days 4 to 10 postinoculation. the rVSV-Luc-inoculated mice showed a moderate weight loss (P 0.05) at up to 8 days postinoculation. no significant clinical signs of VSV infection were observed in these two groups. five mice in each group were inoculated with 106 PFU of rVSV-Luc, rVSV-VP1, rVSV-HSP70, or rVSV-HSP70-VP1. body weight for each mouse was evaluated every other day for 5 weeks. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 triggered similar levels of serum IgG, T cell, and fecal IgA responses. mice inoculated with rVSV-Luc, rVSV-HSP70, and DMEM did not have human noV-specific serum IgG antibodies during the experimental period. results showed that rVSV-VP1 and rVSV-HSP70-VP1 had IgG antibody responses comparable to and antibody responses significantly stronger than those of the traditional VLP-based vaccine candidate. cal samples were collected from all mice at week 5 postinoculation. human noV-specific antibody and total IgA antibody levels were detected by ELISA. data are expressed as average titers from all mice standard deviations. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-HSP70-VP1 induce similar levels of T cell immune responses that are stronger than those induced by the VLP-based vaccine candidate. human noV-specific and total IgA levels in fecal and vaginal extracts were determined by ELISA as described in Materials and Methods. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 stimulated higher levels of humoral, fecal, and vaginal IgA responses than rVSV-VP1 at a dose of 5 106 PFU/mouse. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-VP1 stimulated similar levels of humoral, fecal, and fecal mucosal immunity in mice at a dose of 5 106 PFU. mice inoculated with 5 106 PFU of rVSV-HSP70-VP1 did not exhibit any clinical signs of VSV infection. mice inoculated with 5 106 PFU of rVSV-HSP70-VP1 exhibited mild clinical signs (i.e., ruffled hair coat) body weight for each mouse was measured every other day for 5 weeks. groups of five BALB/c mice were inoculated with 106 PFU of rVSV-VP1, 106 PFU of rVSV-HSP70-VP1, or 5 106 PFU of rVSV-HSP70-VP1. data are expressed as geometric mean titers (GMT) determined for five mice. the level of vaginal IgA in 5 106 PFU of rVSV-VP1-HSP70 was significantly higher than that in 106 PFU of rVSV-HSP70-VP1 (P 0.05) there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in T cell immune responses between mice vaccinated with 5 106 PFU of rVSV-VP1, 106 PFU of rVSV-VP1 and 106 PFU of rVSV- the ratio between human NoV-specific IgA and total IgA was calculated for each mouse. data are expressed as average titers of IgA-positive mice standard deviations. combination vaccination showed stimulated levels of serum IgG antibody similar to those seen with rVSV-VP1 vaccination alone (P > 0.05) however, the combination vaccination triggered significantly higher fecal IgA and vaginal IgA responses than rVSV-VP1 vaccination alone (P 0.05) the ability of serum antibodies to inhibit human NoV VLP binding to HBGAs was measured by an ELISA. the 50% blocking titer (BT50) was determined for each sample. data are expressed as means standard deviations for each treatment group. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 stimulated significantly higher mucosal immunity than rVSV-Luc-VP1. we directly compared the levels of safety and immunogenicity of rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 as a control for the effects of a double-genome insertion. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 triggered significantly higher fecal and vaginal IgA levels than rVSV-Luc-VP1. human noV-specific and total IgA antibody levels were detected by ELISA. data are expressed as the means of the results determined for five mice the standard deviations. rVSV-VP1, rVSV-HSP70-VP1, and rVSV-Luc-VP1 mice were inoculated intranasally with these recombinant VSVs. mice were euthanized and brain viral titers quantitated by plaque analysis. rVSV-HSP70-VP1-infected mice had infectious virus in the brain at days 3 and 5 postinfection. mice were inoculated intranasally with 106 PFU of rVSV-VP1, rVSV-HSP70-VP1 or rVSV-Luc-VP1. at days 3 and 5 postinoculation, 4 mice from each group were euthanized. the brain from each mouse was collected for virus titration by plaque assay. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 formed much smaller plaques, replicated less efficiently, and synthesized fewer VSV proteins in cell culture than rVSV-VP1. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 had less body weight loss, showed no clinical signs of VSV infection, and significantly diminished viral titers in brains. expression of HSP70 diminishes neurovirulence in mice associated with increased production of type I interferon. the ability of HSP70 to promote clearance of VSV would account for the protection observed following coadministration of 106 PFU of rVSV-VP1 and rVSV-HSP70. adenoviruses expressing GP3/GP5 alone are insufficient to induce protective immune responses in pigs. codelivery of HSP70 with an RSV subunit vaccine induced significant higher levels of neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity than unadjuvanted G1F/M2. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 triggered significantly higher fecal and vaginal IgA levels than rVSV-Luc-VP1 alone. inclusion of HSP70 in the VSV vector appears to increase the vaginal IgA responses preferentially over the fecal IgA responses. a robust mucosal immune response is required for the eradiation and resolution of mucosal pathogens. poliovirus induces a secretory IgA response that can neutralize the virus. studies in rotavirus found the presence of mucosal rotavirus-specific IgA strongly correlates with less-severe disease and prevention of rotavirus infection in humans. human noV-specific IgA levels at the intestinal surface are correlated with either the cessation of virus excretion or protection against infection and disease. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 triggered similar levels of specific cellular immunity. the drawback for the VSV vector is that there is little experience with VSV administration in humans. at least three independent phase I human clinical trials are currently being carried out to test the safety, immune response, and effectiveness of the VSV-based vaccine. VSV infects olfactory neurons in the nasal mucosa and enters the central nervous system through the olfactory nerves. the virus is then disseminated to other areas in the brain through retrograde and possibly anterograde transneuronal transport. a variety of approaches have been employed to attenuate VSV. infected with rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 showed less body weight loss. there was no significant difference between rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 in attenuation in vitro and in vivo. insertion of multiple genes in the VSV genome backbone can serve as an additional approach to further attenuate VSV vector. the ability of HSP70 to promote clearance of VSV would account for the protection observed following coadministration of 106 PFU of rVSV-VP1 and rVSV-HSP70 to mice. there was significantly less weight loss than was seen with mice that received 106 PFU of rVSV-VP1 alone. it will be interesting to determine whether HSP70 can enhance the safety of VSV-vectored vaccines. of HSP70 and NP proteins (HSP70+NP) elicited significantly higher NP-specific antibody titers and higher frequencies of IFN--producing cells and CTL activities in vivo than conventional NP vaccination alone (40). rVSV-HSP70-VP1 produced significantly higher vaginal IgA levels than rVSV-Luc-VP1 alone. significant differences in the ratio between noV-specific IgA and total IgA were observed among different experiments. inclusion of HSP70 did significantly (P 0.05) enhance the IgA responses in both experiments. it is possible that HSP70 can interact with the N protein of measles virus, which also is an NNS RNA virus. s, found that the presence of mucosal rotavirus-specific IgA strongly correlates with less-severe disease and prevention of rotavirus infection in humans. many studies have shown that human noV-specific antibody can be detected in fecal and vaginal extracts in mice and human volunteers following vaccination of VLP-based vaccine candidates. rVSV-HSP70-VP1 expression by rVSV-HSP70-VP1 was approximately 5-fold less than that of rVSV-VP1. there was no significant difference in T cell immunity between rVSV-HSP70-VP1 and rVSV-Luc-VP1 at the dose of 1 106 PFU. previously, it has been shown that HSP70 can enhance the serum IgG antibody response to a number of viruses. the drawback for the VSV vector is that there is little experience with VSV administration in humans. at least three independent human clinical trials are currently being carried out to test the safety, immune response, and effectiveness of the VSV-based vaccine and oncolytic therapy in human."}
