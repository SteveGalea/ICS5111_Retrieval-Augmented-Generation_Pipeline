{"summary": "woodchuck cytokines and their receptors have been cloned and characterized. these genes include cytokines and their receptors, immune cell-surface markers, and other immune function\u2013related proteins. in general, the woodchuck genes are more closely related to human than to mouse homologs. the woodchuck IFN- genes could be classified into 10 subtypes and three pseudotypes. PBLs from chronically WHV-infected woodchucks showed a reduced ability to produce woodchuck IFN when stimulated with poly(I:C) IL-10 is a pleiotropic cytokine acting on a variety of immune cells through the cell-surface receptor (IL-10R) the blockade of woodchuck IL-10R showed the ability to enhance the proliferation and degranulation of specific T cells from chronically WHV-infected woodchucks in vitro. the complete coding region of woodchuck immune cell-surface markers that have been cloned so far are summarized in Table 2. ocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), have been cloned and sequenced. woodchuck CD28 showed a similarity of 70%\u201380% to its mammalian homologs. the strict conservation of critical amino acid residues like cystein and asparagine residues in woodchuck CD28 and CTLA-4 suggests both molecules may structurally resemble their human or mouse homologs.

PBMCs and liver tissues from chronic WHV carriers were inversely correlated with WHV DNA titers in acute WHV infection and in entecavir-treated chronic WHV carriers. progress has been made in cloning and characterizing woodchuck components of the woodchuck immune system, but the sequence information is still limited. future cloning and characterizing of APOBEC3 in the woodchuck model has therapeutic values for CHB. monitoring of virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell response is a prerequisite for immunotherapeutic approaches in woodchucks as an appropriate T-cell response against hepatitis B is essential. several studies showed that detection of CD107a is a suitable method for determination of antigen-specific CTLs. the assay enables detection of WHV-specific CTLs based on their granule-dependent effector function. treatment with pegylated IFN- (PEG-IFN-) and nucleot(s)ide analogs leads to a sustained antiviral response in only 30% of patients and is associated with side effects. alternative strategies to treat chronic HBV infection are needed. clinical trials of therapeutic vaccination exploited the conventional prophylactic hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-based protein vaccines in patients. these studies showed reductions in viremia, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion, and HBV-specific T-cell responses. high virus load may be responsible for the immune-tolerant status in some patients. this idea is supported by Boni et al. (2001, 2003), reporting that the T-cell response to HBV was successfully restored in patients treated with lamivudine. chimpanzees showed high anti-HBe titers after the therapy and one of them HBcAg-specific CTLs. recombinant adenoviruses proved to elicit a vigorous humoral and T-cell responses to expressed antigens that are considered crucial for clearance of persistent viral diseases. adenovirus boost regimens proved to induce more robust and potent immune responses in comparison to plasmid DNA alone. a new DNA plasmid (pCGWHc), an adenoviral serotype 5 vector (Ad5WHc) and a chimeric Ad5 displaying Ad35 fiber (Ad35WHc) were constructed. six chronically WHV-infected woodchucks were treated for 23 wk with ETV. the combination therapy of ETV treatment and DNA prime\u2013AdV boost immunization in chronic WHV carriers resulted in WHsAg- and WHcAg-specific T-helper and cytotoxic T-cell responses. nucleoside analog treatment can induce the recovery of HBV-specific cytotoxic T-cell activity in patients. this effect is only transient (Boni et al. 2001) instead of nucleoside analog treatment alone, additional treatments, which potently enhance T-cell responses, need to be pursued. zees with chronic HCV infection, WHV transgenic mice, and patients with chronic HCV infection using PD-L1 antibody had little effect. PD-1 blockade likely requires a critical threshold of preexisting virus-specific T cells in liver. the aim of therapeutic vaccination and/or the immunomodulatory therapy in CHB is to induce virus-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell response in patients to down-regulate viral replication and elimination of infected hepatocytes. a specific B-cell response is needed to induce anti-HBs antibodies to prevent reinfection of nave hepatocytes. 0.2 mg/kg 6 DNA vaccine, WhsAg, WhcAg, Anti-PD-L1 12 3/3 2/3 (66.7%) Total 23 vaccinated animals 10 control animals; four studies 23/23 0/10 7/21 (33.3%) 0/10 ETV, entecavir. blocking the interaction of PD-1 with PD-L1 by an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody reverses the exhausted phenotype in intrahepatic T lymphocytes current progress indicates the feasibility of therapeutic vaccination with or without additional immune modulation for treatment of chronic HBV infection. the increasing number of available vaccine formulations raises a crucial question: what is the optimal scheme of the therapeutic strategy\" HBcAg, hepatitis B core antigen; MVA, modified vaccinia Ankara; HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antigen; HBV, hepatitis B virus; HBeAG, hepatitis B e antigen; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; IFN, interferon. treatment with nucleoside analogs can reduce replicative forms of the virus by blocking reverse transcription and in vivo studies have not been performed to show that this technology can achieve a significant reduction of expression of WHV proteins in vivo. an alternative to regulate HBV gene expression emerged recently with the epigenetic approach."}
