{"summary": "post-epidemic evaluation of the effectiveness of travel restrictions has yet to be conducted. the study aimed to estimate the effectiveness of travel restrictions in reducing the risk of importation from mid-August to September, 2014. hazard rate was modeled as an inverse function of the effective distance, an excellent predictor of disease spread. the majority of preventative measures to reduce EVD transmission have been limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions. the majority of preventative measures have been limited to case isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, as well as entry and exit screening at borders. the WHO described the unfolding EVD epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern in august 2014. a post-epidemic evaluation of the effectiveness of travel restrictions using epidemiological data has yet to be reported. the importance of accounting for socioeconomic predictors has been highlighted in epidemic modeling studies. the aim of the present study is to estimate the effectiveness of travel restrictions, in all countries, that occurred from August to September 2014. openFlights yielded the network data for direct flights between each pair of countries. the total number of direct flight routes was calculated, consisting of 227 nodes (i.e. 227 countries) with 4,598 edges (i.e. 4,598 flights) as of the 10th November 2012. study focused on socio-cultural variables that could mirror physical closeness. the effective distance has been repeatedly used for other applications. the real time forecasting of the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza (H1N1-2009) was modeled in two different ways. the hazard function of importation was modeled in two different ways. the last date at risk of importation under the travel restriction in the present study was on the 15th of September, 2014. the effect reproduction number (i.e. the time-dependent number of secondary cases produced by a single primary case) remained above the value of 1.0 by mid-September [28] tb represents the 15th of September, 2014, the last date of our study period. the total likelihood was given by the product L1L2L3. the maximum likelihood method was employed to infer parameters. the hazard is assumed as constant before and after travel restrictions. the cumulative risk of importation is given by one minus the cumulative risk of escaping importation for the period of ta and tb-ta days. the second scenario is hypothetical scenario in which no travel restriction takes place. two authors (SO and HN) validated the date of importation with reference to announcements made by each government. a list of countries in which travel restrictions were implemented was collected with the first and last dates of implementation. network data were obtained from an open source (OpenFlights) effective distance has been repeatedly used for real time forecasting of spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza (H1N1-2009) three affected countries were grouped into one geographic unit. hazard function of importation was modeled in two different ways. i and Deff in both Eqs (1) and (2) are varied because of the change in the network structure. we assumed 75% of corresponding flight routes were cancelled during travel restrictions as a default assumption. the date on which travel restriction started was set as the 8th of August, 2014 because of the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern. subscript 1 of the hazard indicates the hazard is calculated using the effective distance under travel restrictions. the contribution of group (iii) to the likelihood is calculated as the product of probabilities of escaping for ta days before travel restrictions and for tb-ta days after travel restrictions. we analyzed two different datasets for arrival time. one included all countries with importation and one excluded countries that intentionally imported cases for treatment purposes. the second scenario is a hypothetical scenario in which no travel restriction takes place. a reduction of 75% of flights as a default, we also tested scenarios of 50% and 100% reductions of flights as alternative assumptions. results Imported countries Table 1 shows the list of countries that have experienced importation of EVD in 2014, excluding Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. data from 15 Jul to 15 Sep 2014 excluding importations for treatment purposes (n = 2) Variable Negative log-likelihood p-value (LR test)$ Constant hazard 52.4 reference 19.7 reference +Language 52.0 0.777 18.26 0.185 +Religion 51.7 0.459 19.44 0.980 +Trade 47.7 0.005 18.15 0.161 +Visa exemption 52.1 0.943 16.51 0.024 +Immigration 45. Deff at the baseline was 11.5 with the range from 2.3 to 20.0. Deff when 75% of flights were cancelled was 11.0 with the range from 2.4 to 20.0. the median value of absolute risk reduction was 0.6% (25\u201375 percentiles: 0.6\u20130.7) and 0.0% (25\u201375 percentiles: 0.0\u20130.1), respectively. highest density was observed on coastal areas of africa and in countries in other parts of the world including the Middle East (Iraq, United Arab Emirates and Turkey), Southeast Asia (Indonesia) and Central and South America (Guyana and Nicaragua) estimates in panel A and B are based on analyses that included countries that accepted importation for treatment purposes (n = 6), while panel B excluded the corresponding four countries (n = 2). the black and white dots represent the median of effectiveness in countries and whiskers extend to lower and upper quartiles. 12 countries imported EVD cases in 2014, excluding Guinea, liberia and Sierra Leone. of these, only three importation events were not associated with medical evacuation. four importation events were for medical evacuation purposes. use of trade and immigration variables improved model fit compared with baseline models. Deff at baseline was 11.5 with the range from 2.3 to 20.0. Deff when 75% of flights were cancelled was 11.0 with the range from 2.4 to 20.0. effectiveness, i.e. relative risk reduction, for these models was estimated at 20.1% (25\u201375 percentiles: 19.5\u201322.9) and 17.8% (25\u201375 percentiles: 17.0\u201320.8), respectively. overall magnitude of estimates and shape of distributions remained similar to those shown in Fig 1. the color scale depicts the effectiveness for 227 countries. the first quartile (Q1) represents the countries with the lowest effectiveness. the fourth quartile (Q4) represents those with highest quartile. SEARO and WPRO represent regions defined by WHO as Africa, Europe, the Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. sensitivity analysis Results from the sensitivity analyses are shown in Fig 4. The estimated effectiveness was slightly elevated when we extended the last date of exponential growth of cases. AFRO countries instituted travel restrictions earliest between august and September 2014. this is due to high connectivity with african countries by air transportation. full cancellation of flights with affected countries did not increase the overall effectiveness of travel restrictions. the present approach captures the key contribution of air travel to the time and risk of importation. further analyses to investigate other epidemics and more specific data will be essential to fully understand why the presence of trade, immigration and tourist visa exemptions were present in the best fit model. study estimated the effectiveness of travel restrictions for EVD importation across the world. the relative risk reduction resulting from travel restrictions was estimated to be approximately 20%. this was not considered a substantial risk reduction to prevent the global epidemic of EVD."}
