{"summary": "hypertrophic adipocytes release chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines to activate and attract inflammatory cells into WAT. this contributes to systemic insulin resistance and ultimately, a state of chronic low-grade adipose tissue inflammation. the effects of combination treatment with quercetin and resveratrol (CQR) was investigated in rats fed a HFD. the impact on CQR on HFD-induced fat accumulation, insulin resistance, proinflammatory cytokine levels and AMPK1/sirtuin 1 signaling in adipose tissues was assessed. blood was extracted from the abdominal aorta and centrifuged at 5,000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. subcutaneous adipose tissues, epididymis adipose tissues and perinephric adipose tissues were removed, rinsed, weighed on ice and then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. in-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) were quantified using the corresponding commercial rat ELISA kits. hematoxylin and eosin staining was conducted on EATs at room temperature for 30 min. plasma membrane proteins were extracted from adipose tissues using a radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (cat no. 89900, Pierce; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) plasma membrane proteins were extracted from adipose tissues using a commercial bicinchoninic acid assay kit and a microplate reader at 570 nm. a total of 46 male 8-week-old Wistar rats with a mean weight of 20010 g were provided by the Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) a total of 46 male 8-week-old Wistar rats with a mean weight of 20010 g were provided by the Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) the remaining 24 rats in the lower third (n=12) were randomly divided into 2 sub-groups: i) a HFD group (n=12); and ii) a HFD+CQR (n=12) group. rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and sacrificed following a 12 h fast. leptin, adiponectin, insulin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) were quantified using the corresponding commercial rat ELISA kits. toluidine blue staining was performed on EATs for 1 h by briefly submerging tissue sections in 0.1% aqueous toluidine blue (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) the histological images were used to quantify the number of mast cells present, as previously described (15). membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibody (1:4,000; cat no. sc-2030; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) for 1 h. a total of 46 male 8-week-old Wistar rats with a mean weight of 20010 g were provided by the Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. the rats were raised in an environment of 220.5\u00b0C and 40\u201370% relative humidity under a 12 h light/dark cycle. the normal diet (ND) group, (n=10) were fed a regular chow diet containing 5.4% fat and the HFD group, (n=36) were fed a HFD containing 45% fat. after 3 weeks, rats in the lower third (n=12) were excluded. total cholesterol (C), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein-C (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein-C (LDL-C) in the serum were measured and quantified using a Hitachi 7600 automatic biochemical analyzer (Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with the corresponding kits as follows. hematoxylin and eosin staining were performed on EATs at room temperature for 30 min. toluidine blue staining was performed on EATs for 1 h by briefly submerging tissue sections in 0.1% toluidine blue. membranes were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (cat no. K720; Ameresco, Inc., Framingham, MA, USA) at room temperature and TBS with Tween-20 for 1 h, then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with AMPK1 antibody (cat no. 2795), phosphorylated (p)-AMPK1 (Thr172; cat no. 2535), or SIRT1 rabbit monoclonal antibodies (cat no 3931). treatment with CQR results in a lower body and visceral adipose tissue weight in an HFD-rat model. rats fed a ND, a HFD or a HFD+CQR for a period of 11 weeks. in EAT were measured. data are expressed as the mean standard error of mean. *P0.05, **P0.01 and ***P0.001 vs. ND. 743.740 60.703.934 Serum TNF- (pg/ml) 41.506.000b 71.283.545 50.345.403a Serum IL-6 (pg/ml) 1.1410.0871b 2.0630.2744 1.1310.0842b Serum MCP-1 (pg/ml) 47.565.594a 72.473.848 49.014.671a Statistical differences were identified using a one-way ANOVA test followed the number of mast cells in EAT was calculated to evaluate the effects of CQR on mast cell in adipose tissue of HFD-induced rats. the results showed that HFD significantly promoted the transition of mast cells into EATs. ELISA determined that levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-, IL-6 and MCP-1 were significantly suppressed by CQR. these results suggest that CQR may relieve systematic inflammation induced by obesity. AMPK1 negatively regulates lipid-induced inflammation, which acts through SIRT1 to protect against obesity, inflammation and insulin resistance (23). treatment with CQR results in a lower body and visceral adipose tissue weight in an HFD-rat model. the body weight of rats in the HFD group was significantly higher than those in the ND group. rats fed a ND, a HFD or a HFD+CQR for a period of 11 weeks. EAT morphology was observed using a light microscope at a magnification of 200. adipocyte diameters in EAT were measured. all data in the table are presented as the mean standard error of mean. a P0.05 b P0.01 c P0.001 vs. the HFD model group. CQR suppresses the clustering of mast cells in adipose tissue. a large amount of mast cells infiltrate the adipose tissue (17) treatment with CQR reduced the clustering of mast cells in the epididymal adipose tissue (EAT) a variety of proinflammatory cytokines are secreted by hypertrophic adipocytes. they cause inflammatory cell infiltration during the development and progression of obesity. treatment with CQR significantly reversed the suppression of AMPK1 phosphorylation and SIRT1 expression in a rat model. RT1 expression in the EAT of rats fed a HFD was measured after 11 weeks. the protein and phosphorylation levels of AMPK1 and (B) the protein expression of SIRT1 were measured. subcutaneous adipose tissue weight did not differ significantly across all groups. treatment with CQR reduces the body and visceral fat weights of rats fed a HFD for a period of 11 weeks.

AMPK1 activates SIRT1 and inhibits inflammation in macrophages. AMPK1 may inhibit the activation of the nuclear factor-B system. AMPK1 may suppress the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines. CQR has the potential to reduce HFD-induced obesity and inflammation."}
