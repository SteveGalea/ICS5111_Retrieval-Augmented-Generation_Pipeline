{"summary": "children with no chronic medical conditions between 3 and 15 years of age were randomly assigned by colony to receive either inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (A/Brisbane/59/2007[H1N1]-like virus, A/Brisbane/10/2007[H3N2]-like virus, B/Florida/4/2006-like virus; Vaxigrip) or hepatitis A vaccine (Avaxim-Pediatric, Sanofi Pasteur) specimens were first tested for influenza A (including pH1N1) and B. negative specimens were then tested for influenza (A, B), coronavirus (229E, NL63, OC43), enterovirus (including rhinovirus), parainfluenza (1\u20134), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (A, B) and human metapneumovirus. a Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) the final model was determined using a stepwise backwards elimination method. the proportional hazards assumption was evaluated using Shonfeld residual test. children with underlying conditions (n = 65) and other children (n = 174) were followed but not randomized. all participants were followed regularly with twice-weekly assessments by research nurses over the influenza season. negative specimens were then tested for influenza (A, B), coronavirus (229E, NL63, OC43), enterovirus (including rhinovirus), parainfluenza (1\u20134), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (A, B) and human metapneumovirus by xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel multiplex PCR. a recurrent events analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between 25(OH)D and rate of occurrence of respiratory tract infection adjusted for the biologically plausible covariables specified above. a counting process model was used to treat recurrent events as identical. 25(OH)D level, nmol/L, median (IQR) 62.0 (51.0\u201374.0) No. with serum 25(OH)D levels. all residents per colony 71.1 (25.2) Enrolled children in study 17.4 (8.0) Abbreviations: 25(OH)D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D; IQR, interquartile range; SD, standard deviation. hazard of developing a respiratory tract infection decreased by 50%. levels 50 nmol/L (aHR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.16\u20132.40, P =.006) and 75 nmol/L (aHR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.10\u20132.07, P =.011) were both associated with increased risk of infection. 25 nmol/L vs 25 nmol/L 0.72 (.13\u20133.94).700 50 nmol/L vs 50 nmol/L 1.54 (1.07\u20132.21)021 75 nmol/L vs 75 nmol/L 1.35 (1.01\u20131.82)043 Abbreviations: 25(OH)D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D; CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio. a Analyzed as age conferred an increased risk of viral RTI with a hazard ratio of 1.45 for every 5-year decrease in age. age conferred an increased risk of viral RTI with a hazard ratio of 1.45 for every 5-year decrease in age. lower serum 25(OH)D levels were associated with increased risk of RTI after adjusting for age and sex. younger age also associated with increased risk of lower respiratory tract disease or pneumonia. previous studies have shown that children with rickets are at increased risk of lower respiratory tract disease or pneumonia. a higher proportion of participants with acute lower respiratory infection were found to have vitamin D receptor polymorphisms associated with reduced receptor expression in one study. the role of serum 25(OH)D level and individual respiratory viruses has not been studied. it has been postulated that lower vitamin D levels may explain the seasonal variation in influenza. 10 participants had serum for 25(OH)D levels obtained after the follow-up period had started. no data demonstrating that vitamin D supplementation or the use of fortified foods is part of routine practice in Hutterite communities."}
