{"summary": "transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is a highly contagious, enteric disease of swine. it is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and death. pAPN is reportedly a cellular receptor for TGEV entry(4) and a type II transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to membrane-bound metallopeptidase family. phage clones were evaluated using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. the aim of this study was to explore small molecular therapeutic drugs based on the pAPN-C sequence to treat TGEV infections. dialysis of loaded tube was performed in 1 L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 3 h. purified rpAPN-C proteins were collected from the loaded tube. 96-well plates were coated with purified rpAPN-C at a concentration of 10 g/well. the amplified phages were purified using the polyethylene glycol precipitation method. four rounds of biopanning were performed according to the above-described procedure. swine testis (ST) cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h in 96-well plates. TGEV (103 TCID50/0.1 mL) was used to infect the cells at 37\u00b0C for 24\u201348 h. recombinant pAPN-C-expressing bacteria were induced with 0.8 mM IPTG at 37\u00b0C for 4 h and then the rpAPN-C inclusion bodies were extracted. the extracted inclusion body proteins were separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) plates were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in TBST. 100 L of diluted phage display library was added to the coated plate. unbound phages were removed by washing the plates 10 times with TBST. 100 L of substrate 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine solution was added to the wells and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 L of 2 M H2SO4 to each well. OD450 value of the rpAPN-C/OD450 value of the His tag >2 was determined as positive standard for the phage ELISA. the inclusion bodies expressing rpAPN-C were extracted from the induced recombinant bacteria. the rpAPN-C protein was purified from the extracted inclusion bodies using a simple gel-cutting purification procedure followed by electroelution and dialysis. 1, PM2, PM3, PM4, and PM5 Phage clones Sequence of deduced amino acids PM1 HDAISWTHYHPW PM2 LWCITQDCSHRM PM4 LWCITQDCSHRM PM5 LWCITQDCSHRM Antiviral analysis of phages displaying peptides against pAPN-C Effects of the phage clones PM1 and PM4 on TGEV infection of ST cells was evaluated using the MTT assay phage clones (PM1, PM2, PM3, PM4, and PM5) showed high binding activity with the rpAPN-C using a phage ELISA. the nucleotide sequences of the five phages were determined and the deduced amino acid sequences are shown in Table 1. five phage clones with a binding affinity to the rpAPN-C protein were obtained from the Ph.D.-12 phage display library by biopanning. the rpAPN-C protein was successfully expressed in E. coli cells using a His-tagged pET-32a vector. identified phage clones only displayed two different peptides. attempts to obtain more phage clones displaying different peptides failed. authors have no financial conflicts to disclose."}
