{"summary": "the second luminal domain (C) of the Russell\u2019s viper NPC1 ortholog binds poorly to the Ebola virus glycoprotein. GP cannot recognize the viper ortholog of the filovirus intracellular receptor, Niemann-Pick C1 (Daboia russellii NPC1 [DrNPC1]) soluble form of DrNPC1 domain C can bind to recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus Indiana particles bearing cleaved EBOV GP (rVSV-GPCL) both HsNPC1 and DrNPC1 domain C proteins are expressed and secreted. EBOV GP viruses were cleaved with thermolysin (250 g/ml) dilutions of either HsNPC1 or DrNPC1 domain C proteins were added. binding to GPCL was detected by anti-Flag antibody. the behavior of HsNPC1-DrC resembled that of WT HsNPC1. this indicates that the domain C is correctly folded and does not interfere with the correct folding and trafficking of full-length HsNPC1. the chimera is functional at cholesterol clearance from lysosomes. a fluorescent probe for free cholesterol stained the endo/lysosomal compartments of the parental M12 cells. ectopic HsNPC1 expression could clear this accumulated cholesterol, as previously described (20), substantially reducing filipin staining. these findings affirm that DrNPC1 domain C is biologically active and competent to perform a major housekeeping function of its human counterpart. we engineered and tested a panel of mutant, soluble NPC1 domain C constructs in both HsNPC1 and DrNPC1 backgrounds. we first considered the possibility that one or more differences in N-linked glycosylation sites determine the HsNPC1-DrNPC1 difference. chimeras were expressed in HEK 293T cells and tested for EBOV GPCL binding by ELISA. a single point mutation renders DrNPC1 domain C competent to bind to EBOV GPCL. chimera 2 containing HsNPC1 residues 476 to 536 afforded GPCL-NPC1 binding. chimera 5 fully reconstituted GPCL-DrNPC1 domain C binding. a single amino acid change renders DrNPC1 domain C fully competent to bind EBOV GPCL. a single amino acid change renders DrNPC1 domain C fully competent to bind EBOV GPCL. purified the reciprocal DrNPC1(Y503F) and HsNPC1(F503Y) domain C mutants. they were tested in the GPCL-binding ELISA. no detectable GPCL binding was obtained with the HsNPC1(F503Y) domain C protein. residue 503 influences the capacity of full-length NPC1 to support EBOV entry and infection. CHO-M12 cells stably expressing either HsNPC1 (F503Y) or HsNPC1-DrC (Y503F) were stained with filipin to visualize unesterified cholesterol. mutants with authentic EBOV and rVSV-EBOV GP were fully congruent with the results of the GP-binding experiments. the viperhuman Y503F mutation reduced viral infection in cells expressing the HsNPC1-DrC chimera by 2 log10 units. the infection data correlate with the GPCL-domain C-binding data. the tyrosine residue at position 503 controls EBOV GPCL-binding function in reptile NPC1 domain C orthologs. the tyrosine residue at position 503 controls EBOV GPCL-binding function in reptiles, especially reptiles. the predicted NPC1 polypeptide sequences of two additional snakes, the burmese python (Python bivittatus) and the common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) show an F at position 503. the capacity of these proteins to bind to EBOV GPCL was concordant with the identity of the residue at NPC1 codon 503. tyrosine residue at NPC1 position 503 is unique to the Russell\u2019s viper and king cobra NPC1 orthologs. arrowhead sequences flanking residue 503 (red arrowhead) in domain C from divergent NPC1 orthologs are highlighted in yellow. domain C chimeras were made by substituting these residues for human residues 373 to 475 (chimera 1), 476 to 536 (chimera 2), 537 to 620 (chimera 3), 493 to 502 (chimera 4), 502 to 512 (chimera 5), and 513 to 522 (chimera 6) the constructs were subcloned into the pBABE-puro retroviral vector. all constructs possessed N-terminal Flag tags. EBOV GPMuc matches the EBOV/H.sapiens-tc/COD/1976/Yambuku-Mayinga isolate amino acid sequence. virus inoculum was removed and cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 and 80% humidity for 72 h. cells were washed 3 times with PBS prior to addition of goat anti-human IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) secondary antibody. high-binding 96-well ELISA plates were coated with KZ52 (40) and then blocked using PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin. unbound virus was washed off, and serial dilutions of either Flag-tagged purified soluble NPC1 domain C (domain C; 0 to 40 g/ml) or supernatants from transient transfections of the NPC1 constructs on HEK 293T cells were added. the coverslips were stained with 50 g/ml of Streptomyces filipinensis filipin III complex (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 1 h. images were acquired using an inverted fluorescence microscope."}
