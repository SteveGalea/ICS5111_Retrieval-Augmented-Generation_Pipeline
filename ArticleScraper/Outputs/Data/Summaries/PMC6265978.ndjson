{"summary": "invading microorganisms produce danger- and pathogen-associated molecular patterns that interact with host pattern-recognition receptors. the release of type-I IFNs has both autocrine and paracrine effects via IFN/ receptors (IFNARs) on the cell surface. ISGylation is the result of the coordination of three enzymatic activities-activation, conjugation and ligation. different stimuli trigger the expression of ISG15, which is produced as a precursor of 17 kDa. extracellular ISG15 is able to form dimers/multimers through cysteine residues. it is a covalent and reversible process through the action of a 43-kDa deISGylase enzyme. both ISG15 and its conjugating and deconjugating enzymes are upregulated by type-I IFN [9], as well as by other stimuli such as type-II and type-III IFNs. the role of ISG15 as an inductor of IFN- secretion seems to be the basis for the increased susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases in patients lacking a functional form of ISG15 [20]. secreted ISG15 has also been described to promote NK [22] and dendritic cell [23] maturation, and to act as a chemotactic factor for neutrophils [24]. antiviral activity associated with ISG15 and/or ISGylation has been widely described since the first observation that ISG15-/- mice were more susceptible to viral infections than their wild-type counterparts. the role of ISG15 and ISGylation in viral life cycles is specific to the virus involved [30]. the antiviral effect of ISG15 and ISGylation has also been described against viruses of the genera Novirhabdovirus, Birnavirus and Iridovirus in zebrafish. it is not surprising that viruses have evolved strategies to counteract its antiviral effects. a PLpro inhibitor was shown to protect mice from lethal infection in vivo. ISGylation of the IAV NS1 protein prevents its interaction with importin-, inhibiting the translocation of NS1 to the nucleus and therefore repressing IAV replication and viral RNA processing. ISGylation of the IAV NS1 protein blocks its ability to counteract the innate immune response, prevents its interaction with PKR. ISGylation of a viral protein with antiviral effects is the 2A protease (2Apro) of Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). ISGylation inhibits its ability to cleave the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4G in cardiomyocytes, hindering the translational shutoff induced by CVB3 infection. ISGylation inhibits ubiquitylation, frustrating proteasome-mediated degradation of target proteins. PKR ISGylation at K69 and K159, both located in the dsRNA-binding motif, triggers its activation. this modification occurs in the absence of viral RNA. actin-binding protein Filamin B are also targets for ISG15 conjugation. ISGylation of IRF3 sustains its activation and enhances antiviral responses by inhibiting its degradation. ISGylation of phosphorylated STAT1 inhibits its polyubiquitylation and further proteasomal degradation. ISGylation of TSG101 has been reported to inhibit exosome secretion. it is also used in the generation of exosomes, which are small vesicles secreted to the extracellular environment by most cell types. proteomic studies have been performed to determine ISGylated host proteins. we have surveyed the proteins identified by these four studies, which rendered up to 330 cellular proteins. identified proteins include abundant constitutively expressed proteins as well as diverse interferon-induced proteins. the potential role of ISG15 in mitochondria seems relevant, as a recent study predicted 17% of free ISG15 was localized to mitochondria. a recent study predicted that 17% of free ISG15 was localized to mitochondria, representing about 5% of the total target proteins.

ISG15 encodes a small ubiquitin-like protein involved in a post-translational modification process termed ISGylation. it is synthesized as a 17-kDa precursor that is processed into a mature form of 15 kDa. ISGylation is the result of the coordination of three enzymatic activities-activation, conjugation and ligation. intracellular and extracellular activities of ISG15. different stimuli trigger the expression of ISG15. it is produced as a precursor of 17 kDa with two ubiquitin-like domains. in humans, ISG15 binds to USP18, increasing its stability and leading to a decrease in IFN-/ signaling. this role for ISG15 seems to be predominant in humans, since patients appear not to be more susceptible to viral infections [18,19] a recent study highlighted the presence of dimeric and multimeric forms of extracellular ISG15 important for its cytokine activity during parasite infection. it speculated on the existence of an unknown ISG15 receptor on dendritic cells that mediates chemotaxis of these cells to the site of infection and IL-1 production. however, ISGylation has not been shown to stimulate proteasomal degradation of its substrates. mice demonstrated that ISG15 has a protective effect against lethal infection by Influenza virus, Herpes Simplex virus (HSV-1) and Sindbis virus (SINV). exogenous expression of wild-type ISG15 by recombinant chimeric SINV protected IFNAR-/- mice against systemic and lethal infections. a PLpro inhibitor was shown to protect mice from lethal infection in vivo. ISGylation is necessary for robust production of Hepatitis C virus. it has been reported that ISGylation is necessary for robust production. seven lysine (K) residues in the NS1 protein were identified as potential target sites of ISGylation [50]. Specifically, ISGylation of the IAV NS1 protein prevents its interaction with importin-, inhibiting the translocation of NS1 to the nucleus and therefore repressing IAV replication. ISGylation of the HCMV scaffold protein pUL26 inactivates its function in the downregulation of TNF-mediated NF-B activation, suppressing HCMV growth. another example of an ISGylated viral protein is the human papillomavirus (HPV) L1 capsid protein. ISGylation of RIG-I decreases RIG-I cellular levels and downregulates signaling. free ISG15 also regulates RIG-I levels by promoting interaction between RIG-I and the autophagic cargo receptor p62. other proteins involved type-I IFN signaling and regulation are also bound by ISGylation. min B negatively regulates IFN-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) signaling, preventing apoptosis induction. ISGylation of CHMP5 triggers its aggregation and the sequestration of the Vps4 cofactor LIP5, impairing the membrane recruitment of Vps4 and its interaction with the Gag budding complex of Avian sarcoma leukosis virus and HIV-1. elucidated for only a small set of cellular proteins, ISGylation has a broad target specificity. several proteomic studies have been performed to determine ISGylated host proteins. a third proteomic study identified 174 ISGylated cellular proteins in IFN-stimulated A549 cells stably expressing FLAG-ISG15. proteins identified as ISGylation targets in different proteomic studies were evaluated for their subcellular location. a similar percentage of ISGylation targets were predicted to be located in the nucleus, cytoplasm, extracellular space or as secreted proteins. we will briefly review the role of mitochondria as antiviral mediators and targets of ubiquitin-like modifiers. we will focus on the current knowledge about ISG15- and ISGylation-mediated regulation of these multifunctional organelles.

SUMOs are a family of highly conserved 12-kDa proteins that are essential in eukaryotic cells. SUMO conjugation to specific lysine residues of target proteins alters their function, their interaction with other proteins, and their stability. SUMOylation of the mitochondrial oxidative stress sensor DJ-1 results in its stabilization and full activation. monomeric ISG15 and ISGylation proteins were observed in mitochondrial fractions from wild-type BMDMs after type-I IFN pre-treatment. this analysis revealed that oxygen consumption and ATP production were lower in ISG15-/- BMDMs than in equivalent wild-type cells, indicative of defective OXPHOS. a clear difference in the distribution of ETC supercomplexes was observed between the two groups. ISG15-/- BMDMs showed mixed features of M1 and M2 phenotypes. alterations in mitochondrial OXPHOS could drive changes to immune cell function. BMDMs lacking ISG15 accumulated non-functional mitochondria with absence of Parkin. ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like PTMs are key regulatory processes of the innate and adaptive immune response against viruses. mitochondria are targets of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins, such as small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) and ISG15. ubiquitylation is essential for the regulation of many mitochondrial processes. SUMOylation of the mitochondrial oxidative stress sensor DJ-1 results in its stabilization and full activation, reinforcing its protective role against Parkinson\u2019s disease. ISG15 conjugation to parkin enhances its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and its cytoprotective effect in Parkinson\u2019s disease. mice with OXPHOS defects showed increased susceptibility to viral infections. knockout mice for ISG15 or the ISG15-activating E1 enzyme (Ube1L) were more susceptible to infection with many viruses than wild-type mice. ISG15 and ISGylation are involved in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism. absence of ISG15 leads to alterations in OXPHOS, with lower oxygen consumption rates and ATP production levels. mitochondrial extracts suggest that ISG15 is important during the translocation of Parkin from the cytoplasm to mitochondria. monomeric ISG15 and ISGylation proteins were observed in mitochondrial fractions from wild-type BMDMs after type-I IFN pre-treatment. these proteins were preferentially located to the IMS and IMM. a clear difference in the distribution of ETC supercomplexes was observed between the two groups, pointing to a possible role for ISG15 in the correct assembly of ETC proteins. 15-/- BMDMs showed mixed features of M1 and M2 phenotypes. alterations in mitochondrial OXPHOS could drive changes to immune cell function. BMDMs lacking ISG15 accumulated nonfunctional mitochondria with absence of Parkin. ylation in the control of mitochondrial OXPHOS and recycling, at least in murine BMDM, expanding the range of functions of this PTM and underscoring its importance in the regulation of essential cellular processes. many of these reversible modifications act as regulatory mechanisms in mitochondria and show promise for mitochondria-targeted therapeutic strategies."}
