{"summary": "the cases patient 1 became ill on may 11, 2014, with fever (temperature >38\u00b0C), cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, and anorexia. she was admitted to hospital A on may 17; her condition improved. she was transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU) patient 4 was admitted to a hospital in Tehran, Iran, on June 6. he had fever (temperature >38\u00b0C), sore throat, cough, dyspnea, chills, anorexia, and myalgia. she was discharged from the hospital on June 14 and was in stable condition until severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) developed. the mutation at position 28941 was nonsynonymous with an aspartic acid to histidine change. for the isolate from patient 4, another nonsynonymous mutation was observed at position 29147. in all 3 sequences, nucleotide C was detected at position 29147, as was the case with the first identified isolate of MERS-CoV. for some sequences in GenBank, this position contains T. thoat swab specimens and sputum samples were collected from all close contacts of the 5 patients in this cluster. all samples were negative for MERS-CoV. this finding suggests that as with severe acute respiratory syndrome, MERS-CoV is not readily transmitted during the early phases of the disease (3). we performed N gene PCRs on samples from all 5 case-patients. results were negative for patients 3 and 5, suggesting that these samples should be tested with more specific primers."}
