{"summary": "over 1000 bat subspecies, accounting for 25% of all mammal species, have been recognized (4, 5) the origin of bats can be traced to 52.5 million years ago (6). bats exhibit no visible symptoms of viral diseases but carry viruses that are lethal to humans and other mammals. the first information on bat adaptive cellular immunity might date to 1979, when it was reported that under the stimulation of PHA, a type of T cell mitogen, the generation of lymphocytes in bats was delayed (2 d) relative to that in mice (22). a recent study reported the functional characterization of bat MHC I molecules (Ptal)\u2013N*01:01) no studies on the structure of the bat MHC I molecule have been performed. the structural biological study of MHC I presentation in bats will help clarify how the CTL-mediated immune response functions during viral infection in bats. additional ionic bond confers peptides with N-terminal aspartic acids high affinity with bat MHC I. the peptides were synthesized, purified to >90% using reverse-phase HPLC. plasmids were built into pET-21a (Novagen) and named pET-21a-PtalH and pET-21a-PtalB respectively. purified proteins were dissolved in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride at a final concentration of 30 mg/ml. pET-21a-PtalH without residues 52\u201354 was obtained and named pET-21a-MDL without residues 52\u201354. the protein in the inclusion bodies was further purified by the method described above. the protein was then refolded with 2m and the peptide was further purified. the acquisition of MS data was carried out by a Q Exactive HF (Bremen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in data-dependent acquisition mode. the top 20 precursors by intensity from mass range m/z 300 to 1800 were sequentially fragmented with higher energy collisional dissociation, normalized collision energy 27. a peptide position with a higher Vs was predicted to be a restricted position in the presentation. a peptide position with a higher Vs was predicted to be a restricted position in the presentation. the elements and specific amino acids at the predicted restricted motif were valued. derived from HEV fusion protein residues 177\u2013185, and an artificial nonapeptide, HEV-1PL (DFANTFLL) were assembled and crystallized with p/Ptal-N*01:01 and Ptal-2m. all of the crystals were first screened by a crystallization screen kit (Hampton Research) by the sitting-drop method. refinement, and data analysis For all the scaled and merged diffraction data of p/Ptal-N*01:01/HEV-1, p/Ptal-N*01:01/HEV-2, p/Ptal-N*01:01/HEV-1PL, and p/Ptal-N*01:01/HEV-1PL, the phases were calculated after the structure was determined by MOLREP (41) and Phaser (42). 0.285 (0.628) 0.431 (0.845) Average I/ 16.0 2.6 19.0 5.8 Completeness (%) 99.8 (100.0) 75.0 (37.5) 100.0 (100.0) 99.5 (98.7) N (observed) 466, 731 118, 661 203, 807 68, 066 N (unique) 23, 392 12, 065 14, 538 9, 390 Refinea Resolution 14.90\u20132.20 28.71\u20132.70 67.56 two synthetic random peptide libraries, Ran_9Xsplitted (XXXXXXXXX) and HEV-1PX (DFANTFLX) were synthesized to ensure randomness (30) the peptides were synthesized, purified to >90% using reverse-phase HPLC (SciLight Biotechnology and Top-Biotechnology), stored as lyophilized powder. purified proteins were dissolved in guanidine hydrochloride at a final concentration of 30 mg/ml and stored at 20\u00b0C. inclusion bodies were renatured using a previously described gradual dilution method. pET-21a-PtalH without residues 52\u201354 was obtained and named pET-21a-MDL. p/Ptal-N*01:01:01 was mixed with 0.2 N acetic acid and placed in a 90\u00b0C water bath for 5 min for peptide elution. then concentrated with a 3-kDa filter to collect the peptides. samples were desalted using C18 tips built in house as follows. the acquisition of MS data was carried out by a Q Exactive HF (Bremen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in data-dependent acquisition mode. the top 20 precursors by intensity from mass range m/z 300 to 1800 were sequentially fragmented with higher energy collisional dissociation, normalized collision energy 27. k is the set of symbols in the alphabet, given i ( 1,..., N r e s ) with j ( 1,..., N r e s ) representing the amino acid species at specific positions with amino acid abbreviations. the target peptides were scored (S) by the added values of specific amino acids at their predicted restricted motifs. p/Ptal-N*01:01/HEV-1, p/Ptal-N*01:01/HEV-2, and p/Ptal-N*01:01/HEV-1PL grew well as relatively thin slices in 0.2 M lithium sulfate monohydrate. p/Ptal-N*01:01/HEV-2, and p/Ptal-N*01:01/HEV-1PL grew well as relatively thin slices in 0.2 in coot (44) and several rounds of refinement in Refmac5 (45), phenix.refine (46) was used for further refinement. PyMOL (Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC) and Chimera (University of California\u2013San Francisco) were used for structure-correlation diagram analysis and plotting.

Arg65 of p/Ptal-N*01:01 was found to form a salt bridge with P1-D of the peptide. however, p/Ptal-N*01:01MDL has lost this salt bridge. this salt-bridge chain was probably related to previously reported P1-D preference. p/Ptal-N*01:01/HEV-1 is shown as sticks enveloped in (2Fo-Fc) electron density compared with p/Ptal-N*01:01MDL/HEV-1 in gray. two polypeptides (DENOVOMDM and DENOVOFHS) were chosen that did not wholly conform to the predicted motif. ability matrix (37, 38) of every type of amino acid located at each of the nine loci. from P1 to P, the Vs is 0.92, 1.78, 0.90, 0.60, 0.62, 0.63, 0.47, 0.73, and 1.81. p/Ptal-N*01:01 had high adaptive potential to bind abundant peptides. the preference of proline at P is shown as positively correlated with the preference of P1-D both in and out of the cell. in Fig. 6A, the Ptal-N*01:01\u2013bound polypeptide shifted to the left by 0.4 in the horizontal direction compared with the mutant. this may indicate that P1-D is pulled to the left through interactions with Arg65. a heat map of the amino acid preference distribution at positions 1 9 shows the amino acid weighting probabilities at every position of the presented peptide in the type of Shannon. the peptide was colored by Coulomb law with peptide (HEV-2) bound.

Arg65 of p/Ptal-N*01:01 was found to form a salt bridge with P1-D of the peptide. however, p/Ptal-N*01:01MDL has lost this salt bridge. p/Ptal-N*01:01:01MDL has lost this salt bridge. in p/Ptal-N*01:01 (up) and p/Ptal-N*01:01MDL (down) the special salt-bridge chain formed in p/Ptal-N*01:01/HEV-1 shown as sticks enveloped in (2Fo-Fc) electron density compared with p/Ptal-N*01:01MDL/HEV-1 in gray. the differential preference for P1-D in or out of the cell environment. from P1 to P, the Vs is 0.92, 1.78, 0.90, 0.60, 0.62, 0.63, 0.47, 0.73, and 1.81. p/Ptal-N*01:01 had high adaptive potential to bind abundant peptides. the preference of proline at P is positively correlated with the preference of P1-D both in and out of the cell. in Fig. 6A, the Ptal-N*01:01\u2013bound polypeptide shifted to the left by 0.4 in the horizontal direction compared with the mutant, which may indicate that P1-D is pulled to the left through interactions with Arg65. this pulling force will move the polypeptide farther away from Gly80 and make the peptide with a P model of p/MHC I/Tapbpr complex in 60% transparency compared with p/Ptal-N*01:01/HEV-1 ABG and its analog on the right. Schematic of normal peptide editing and replacement process in vivo. salt-bridge chains potentially influencing peptide editing and replacement processes in vivo. the results of the structural conservation analysis are shown in Supplemental Fig. 3. some characteristic amino acids could provide clues to clarify the way peptides bind the bat MHC I molecule\u2019s ABG. the HC of Ptal-N*01:02, R. sinicus, and R. ferrumequinum were modeled. they could also potentially form salt-bridge chains between Asp/Glu/Arg59 and Arg65 or Glu65. there were also bat MHC I molecules without this type of insertion. however, these cases were unusual. only a small fraction of binding peptides with certain affinities and specific motifs could dock at the cell membrane TCRs. the high adaptability of the peptide and the unique characteristics of the MHC I gene distribution in the bat might facilitate the activation of cell-mediated immunity. acid at P1 of the binding peptide accounted for only 3.5% of the binding preference, showing that the high-level preference for aspartic acid at P1 disappeared. in vitro peptide-binding assays demonstrated that P1 was not a significantly restrictive position. a split synthetic random peptide library has been applied to the screening of MHC I ligands. the results indicated the existence of a similar motif to naturally processed and presented peptides. de novo LC-MS/MS can execute sequencing directly from MS/MS. the presentation of Asp in the cell at the P1 position might increase the overall affinity of MHC I\u2013binding polypeptides. the novel salt-bridge chain near pocket A might promote the presentation of high-affinity peptides by Ptal-N*01:01 after binding peptide exchange in vivo. the identified features are common among bats and might facilitate the activation of efficient cell-mediated immunity."}
