{"summary": "despite advances in diagnostic testing beyond culture-based methods, pneumonia etiology often remains undetermined. one reason for this is that specimens directly from the lungs are often not available. upper respiratory tract specimens, such as nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs, are often collected for molecular testing. NP/OP and sputum specimens were collected within 3 days of hospital admission. each specimen type was collected within 2 days of the other. radiographic pneumonia was confirmed in 204 (86%) hospitalized patients with ARI. a pathogen was detected in 215 (91%) sputum specimens and 191 (81%) NP/OP specimens. a higher proportion of sputum specimens had 1 pathogen detected compared with NP/OP specimens in children (93% versus 68%; P 0.0001) and adults (88% versus 61%; P 0.0001) 121 (32%) (44 bacteria and 77 viruses) were from high-quality sputum specimens only. 230 (61%) (144 bacteria and 86 viruses) were from both specimens. sputum increased diagnostic yield by 84.7% for the pathogens tested in children. human enterovirus 1 21 9 31 51 210.0 67.7 3.2 73.2 (63.6\u201382.8) Human metapneumovirus 1 7 8 74 14.3 12.5 0.0 98.8 (96.4\u2013100) Human parainfluenza virus 4 0 6 3 9 73 200.0 66.7 0.0 92.7 (87.1\u201398.3) Total bacteria (% total) 22 (5.8) 44 (11.6) 144 (38) 210 (55.4) Total virus (% total) 6 (1.6 a pathogen was detected in 91% of adults by either specimen type. a pathogen was detected in 72% of NP/OP specimens. there were 290 detections (205 [71%] bacteria and 85 [29%] viruses. mycoplasma pneumoniae 1 4 5 10 144 66.7 40.0 10.0 96.8 (94.0\u201399.6) Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1 10 3 14 140 250.0 71.4 7.1 92.9 (88.8\u201396.0) Streptococcus pneumoniae 3 8 31 42 112 23.5 19.0 7.1 92.9 (88.8\u201396.9) Human enterovirus 1 8 1 10 144 400.0 80.0 10.0 94.2 (9 ococcus pyogenes (3), adenovirus (1), human parainfluenza virus 1 (1), human parainfluenza virus 2 (3), influenza C (1). increase in diagnostic yield contributed by sputum was calculated as follows: (positive detections by sputum only)/(total number of positives found in either specimen type) the high-quality sputum and NP/OP values were averaged for each target. a positive number along the y axis indicates the number of cycles the high-quality sputum specimen outperformed the matching NP/OP specimen. a negative number indicates the number of cycles the NP/OP specimen outperformed the high-quality sputum specimen. the frequency of detection for 16 of 20 pathogens included on both pediatric and adult TAC, and detected on either specimen type, was higher in children than in adults. adenovirus (27% versus 0.6%), enterovirus (38% versus 6%), RSV (46% versus 8%), and human rhinovirus (49% versus 19%). an average of 2.1 viral pathogens was detected when considering both specimens. 1.1 detections in NP/OP alone and 2.0 detections in sputum alone. the number of pathogens detected in individual patients for children (A) and adults (B) of 236 patients hospitalized with ARI, 82 (35%) were children and 154 (65%) were adults. radiographic pneumonia confirmed in 204 (86%) hospitalized patients with ARI. a pathogen was detected in 215 (91%) sputum specimens and 191 (81%) NP/OP specimens. a higher proportion of sputum specimens had 1 pathogen detected compared with NP/OP specimens in children (93% versus 68%; P 0.0001) and adults (88% versus 61%; P 0.0001) there were 379 detections (210 [55%] bacteria and 169 [45%] viruses) among these, 28 (7%) (22 bacteria and 6 viruses) were from NP/OP specimens only, 121 (32%) (44 bacteria and 77 viruses) were from high-quality sputum specimens only, and 230 (61%) (144 bacteria and 86 viruses) were from both specimens.

a P value of 0.05 was considered significant. combined NP/OP swabs were collected for molecular detection of respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria using singleplex real-time PCR methods (1, 2). children with sufficient cough were asked to expectorate or have sputum suctioned through the nose or mouth into a sterile container. the total_NA_Plasma_external_lysis_V3_2 program was used with an input volume of 600 l of the combined DTT and specimen mixture and eluted in 100 l. both sputum and NP/OP specimen extracts were tested the same day, and the remaining specimen and extract was stored at less than or equal to 70\u00b0C. validation data for TAC versus individual real-time PCR assays were described by Kodani et al. high-quality sputum and NP/OP values were compared using a paired t test. a positive number indicates an earlier CT value for high-quality sputum suggesting a higher pathogen load."}
