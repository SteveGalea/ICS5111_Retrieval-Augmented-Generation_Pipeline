{"summary": "1 PRF occurs at a specific heptanucleotide \u201cslippery sequence\u201d which has a typical composition of X XXY YYZ. after 1 PRF, the translating ribosome shifts back 1 nt along the mRNA at the slippery sequence. frameshifting efficiency dictates the molar ratio of viral structural and enzymatic proteins. small molecules that bind to the stimulator RNA structures and modulate the frameshifting efficiency of the retrovirus HIV-1 and the coronavirus SARS were identified. the gag-pol junction sequences of HIV-1 have the potential to harbor several highly conserved pseudoknots. a sequence window of 127 nt containing the slippery sequence (UUUUUA) plus 50 nt upstream of and 70 nt downstream from the slippery sequence is used. four pseudoknot-forming sequences of PK1\u2013PK4 in reference strain HXB2. PK1 encompasses the slippery sequence at the 3\u2032 end of the pseudoknot-forming sequence. PK2 also encompasses the slippery sequence, but it is located in the middle of the pseudoknot-forming sequence. HIV-1 is notorious for its high mutation rate. the sequences at the gag-pol junction from different strains of HIV-1 also exhibit a fair degree of sequence variation. the four potential pseudoknots are highly conserved among the 4254 strains. potential pseudoknots PK1, PK2 and PK3 in most HIV-1 strains conform to the CPK-1 family. the predicted secondary structures of these pseudoknots are comparable to those of the autoregulatory pseudoknot within the gene 32 mRNA of bacteriophages T2/T6. we propose the following mechanism to explain the plausible involvement of the putative pseudoknots in 1 PRF of HIV-1. the frameworkshift junction of HIV-1 may be structurally heterogeneous, with several alternative structures in equilibrium. in most strains, the tandem pseudoknots may dominate the RNA pool due to their greater overall stability. tandem pseudoknots PK1 and PK3 are present at the gag-pol frameshift junction. these pseudoknots may signal the translating ribosome to slow down. PK1 and PK3 may function as a braking system to slow down the ribosome. pseudoknots PK1, PK3 and PK4 are involved in the regulation of 1 PRF in HIV-1. if PK2 is present in a particular viral mRNA sequence, all other three pseudoknots would not form in the same sequence at the same time. formation of PK4 may happen before the translating ribosome reaches the slippery sequence. several scenarios are possible for the involvement of these pseudoknots. the relative stabilities of the pseudoknots may decide which scenario dominates. other trans-acting factors may also participate in regulatory processes. the pyrimidine-rich sequence 3\u2032 to the bulge forms a stem with the purine-rich spacer region instead of forming stem 2 of PK4. an A-C mismatch is present in the stem in 38% of the 139 sequences analyzed. the PK4 in strain MVP5180 is conserved in most subgroup O strains. PK4 may dominate RNA pool over other alternative structures in subgroup O. compared to previously proposed triplex-containing pseudoknot and extended bulged stem\u2013loop models, the three or four putative pseudoknots identified in this study have a higher degree of conservation. this high degree of conservation strongly suggests these pseudoknots may assume functional roles. the 5\u2032 UTR of HIV-1 genomic RNA can exist in two alternative structures. the branched multiple-hairpin (BMH) structure and the long distance interaction (LDI) structure. the mechanisms regulating this riboswitch are not well understood. a SHAPE-derived secondary structure model of the entire HIV-1 genomic RNA was modeled as a three-helix junction structure. the slippery sequence pairs with an upstream sequence to form one of the three helices. the biologically active structure may not always be the one that dominates the RNA pool (with minimum free energy) the novel mechanism of pseudoknot-mediated 1 PRF in HIV-1 has many exquisite features that have not been described in any of the previously characterized cases of 1 PRF. the mechanism is consistent with the current paradigm of pseudoknot-dependent 1 PRF. values for the two stems S1 and S2 are calculated. if loop 3 is absent, the two stems are treated as a continuous helical stem."}
