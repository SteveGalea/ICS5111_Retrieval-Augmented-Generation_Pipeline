{"summary": "all flaviviruses possess a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 11 kb. the genome encodes a large polyprotein that is co- and post-translationally cleaved to generate three structural proteins. the genomes of some flaviviruses appear to encode an additional protein as a consequence of ribosomal frameshifting. ebrate flaviviruses associated with serious human disease include tick-borne encephalitis virus, Langat virus and Powassan virus. not all flaviviruses cycle between arthropods and vertebrates; some have a vertebrate-specific host range while others appear to be insect-specific. cISF-like sequences, designated cell silent agent (CSA), have been found in the genomes of Aedes spp. mosquitoes. one sequence encoded a NS1-NS4A-like transcript. partial E, NS4B and NS5-like sequences were also identified. first cISF to be discovered was cell fusing agent virus (CFAV) after its isolation from Aedes aegypti cell cultures over 40 years ago. CFAV has since been isolated from or detected in field-collected mosquitoes in Indonesia [19], Mexico [20], Puerto Rico [21] and Thailand [22,23] bUnited States (2012) Ae. albopictus, Ae. aegypti, Culex spp. [17,19,20,21,22,24] Culex flavivirus (CxFV) Yes Japan (2003), Indonesia (2004), China (2006), Guatemala (2006), USA (2006), Mexico (2007), Trinidad (2008), Uganda (2008), Argentina (2009) Cx. interrogator. palm Creek virus (PCV) Yes Australia (2010) Coquillettidia xanthogaster [46] Quang Binh virus (QBV) Yes Vietnam (2002), China (2009) An. sinensis, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus [47,48,49] a Table is restricted to viruses for which more than 300 nt of sequence data are available. the next cISF to be discovered was Kamiti River virus (KRV) after its isolation in the last ten years, several other novel cISFs have been described. these include aedes flavivirus (AEFV) in Japan [19], Italy [12,25,57], Thailand [24] and the united states [26], Aedes galloisi flavivirus (AGFV) in Japan [28], Calbertado virus (CLBOV) in Canada [30,58] and the USA [29], Nakiwogo virus (NAKV) in the two other research groups sequenced a 238 to 917 nt region of the NS5 gene. a pairwise nucleotide sequence alignments of the 163-nt region shared by representative HANKV, OcFV and SOcFV sequences revealed that these viruses are 91% to 96% identical. it has been proposed that flaviviruses with >84% nucleotide sequence identity should be classified within the same species. the virus was isolated from 10 pools of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and one pool of Anopheles sinensis collected in the Yunnan in 2007\u20132010. the same name was chosen by two of the four research groups that made the discovery. the genome of one isolate was completely sequenced and the ORF was reported to have 83.0% nucleotide identity to the corresponding region of the prototypical QBV isolate. the authors opted for a conservative approach and considered their isolate to be a strain of QBV [48] xFV toyama 1431 strain are both one nucleotide shorter than the corresponding regions of CxFV Tokyo strain. a potentially novel cISF, designated Aedes vexans flavivirus (Czech AeveFV), was isolated from Ae. vexans in the Czech Republic in 2008\u20132009. two 917-nt sequences corresponding to a cISF designated Culex pipiens flavivirus were detected in mosquitoes in Portugal in 2009\u20132010. the sequences are 97% identical to the corresponding region of CTFV. this species name should also be discontinued because these sequences are 90%\u201399% identical to the corresponding region of HANKV. a 6567-nt cISF-like sequence was identified by RNA deep sequencing in chironomids (non-biting midges) in france. the most comprehensive in vitro host range studies were performed with PCV which was shown to lack the ability to replicate in hamster (BHK-21), human (SW-13), monkey (Vero) and porcine (PS-EK) cells. PCV does not induce CPE in C6/36 cells after the first or second passage. morphological changes (i.e., syncytia and vacuolation in cells) are observed by the fourth passage. cxFV and CFAV both reach maximum titers of approximately 107 plaque forming units. CxFV was not detected in the saliva of Cx. quinquefasciatus infected with CxFV alone. was detected in the saliva of mosquitoes co-infected with CxFV and WNV. transmission Vertical transmission is defined as the process by which an infected female directly transmits a pathogen to her progeny. uninfected laboratory-colonized Cx. pipiens were infected with CxFV by needle inoculation. the mosquitoes did not possess an ovarian infection barrier because CxFV RNA was detected in their ovaries. 62.4% of mosquitoes that fed on infectious blood were positive for KRV by virus isolation in cell culture. Virus was also isolated from 90.2% of second instar larvae exposed to KRV-infected C6/36 cells. studies need to be performed to assess whether efficient per os infection occurs in mosquitoes exposed to cISF via natural food sources. cISFs can suppress in vitro replication of dual-host flaviviruses in mosquito cells. prior infection with PCV significantly reduced WNV and MVEV replication in C6/36 cells. prior exposure to CxFV had no effect on WNV replication in C6/36 cells. co-inoculated Honduras Cx. quinquefasciatus transmitted WNV compared to mosquitoes inoculated with WNV alone. ciSFs can enhance transmission of dual-host flaviviruses under some circumstances. the 3' UTRs of CFAV, CxFV and QBV are also of the expected size. however, the 3' UTRs of AeFV and KRV are unusually long. the 3' UTRs of CFAV, CxFV and QBV are also of the expected size. the codon and dinucleotide usage preferences of cISFs are consistent with their apparent vertebrate-incompetent replication phenotype. a comparison of the dinucleotide usage preferences of representative viruses from the cISF, NKV and dual-host groups revealed that MODV and to a lesser extent. all three viruses demonstrate an underutilization of UpA. similar observations were reported when the dinucleotide usage preferences of CFAV, CxFV and KRV were compared to that of multiple NKV and dual-host flaviviruses. chains were run for 10 million generations, with the first 25% discarded as burn-in. the figure was produced using FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) all known cISFs use -1 PRF to express a novel overlapping gene (designated fifo) in the NS2A-NS2B regions of their genomes. the nucleotide sequences of all cISFs for which NS2A-NS2B data are available were analyzed. dISFs contain a -1 PRF site just downstream of the predicted junction between the regions encoding NS1 and NS2A. the'slippery' heptanucleotide sequence at which the -1 nt shift occurs is highlighted in orange. frameshifting is predicted to be stimulated by an RNA pseudoknot structure in the CFAV clade and an RNA stem-loop structure in the CxFV and HANKV clades. it is not known whether fifo is expressed as a frameshift fusion simply with the N-terminal few amino acids of NS2A (i.e., NS2AN-FIFO) similar sites were identified at the predicted C/prM, prM/E, E/NS1 and 2K/NS4B junctions of most cISFs. the NS1/NS2A cleavage site of dual-host flaviviruses is signalase-like with respect to the '-1, -3' rule. an upstream hydrophobic domain is absent.

Several other novel cISFs have been identified. HANKV, OcFV and SOcFV are likely to be the same virus species. this virus is HANKV and not an unrecognized cISF species. the authors sequenced almost all of the genome of the cISF. ex theileri flavivirus (CTFV) was isolated from Cx. theileri in Portugal in 2009\u20132010. the virus was independently discovered by another research group in 2007\u20132010. the same virus was independently discovered by another research group. the genome of one isolate was completely sequenced and the ORF was reported to have 83.0% nucleotide identity to the corresponding region of the prototypical QBV isolate. the authors opted for a conservative approach and considered their isolate to be a strain of QBV [48] cISFs display strain-specific differences in the lengths of their non-coding region lengths. the 5' and 3' UTRs of CxFV toyama 1431 strain are both one nucleotide shorter than the corresponding regions of CxFV Tokyo strain. the conservative approach opted by Zuo and colleagues will be used for the remainder of this review and their virus will be referred to as QBV. two 917-nt sequences corresponding to a cISF designated Culex pipiens flavivirus were detected in mosquitoes in Portugal in 2009\u20132010. the sequences are 97% identical to the corresponding region of CTFV. this species name should be discontinued because these sequences are 90%\u201399% identical to the corresponding region of HANKV. a 6567-nt cISF-like sequence was identified by RNA deep sequencing in chironomids (non-biting midges) in france. the most comprehensive in vitro host range studies were performed with PCV which was shown to lack the ability to replicate in hamster (BHK-21), human (SW-13), monkey (Vero) and porcine (PS-EK) cells [46], and CxFV which cannot replicate in avian (DF-1), PCV does not induce CPE in C6/36 cells after the first or second passage. morphological changes (i.e., syncytia and vacuolation in cells) are observed by the fourth passage. CFAV and CFAV reach maximum titers of approximately 107 plaque forming units (pfu)/mL in C6/36 cells. CxFV was not detected in the saliva of Cx. quinquefasciatus infected with CxFV alone. was detected in the saliva of mosquitoes co-infected with CxFV and WNV. transmission Vertical transmission is defined as the process by which an infected female directly transmits a pathogen to her progeny. vertical infection rates typically reported in mosquitoes infected with dual-host flaviviruses. CxFV RNA was detected in the ovaries of F1 produced from field-infected Cx. pipiens. the mosquitoes did not possess an ovarian infection barrier. 62.4% of mosquitoes that fed on infectious blood were positive for KRV by virus isolation in cell culture. efficient per os transmission has also been reported for Ae. aegypti exposed to Eilat virus (EILV), an insect-specific alphavirus. cISFs can suppress in vitro replication of dual-host flaviviruses in mosquito cells. prior exposure to PCV significantly reduced WNV and MVEV replication in C6/36 cells. prior exposure to CxFV had no effect on WNV replication in C6/36 cells. NV infections compared to single-virus infected mosquitoes (94%) at 14 days p.i., WNV infection, dissemination and transmission rates did not differ significantly. at 14 days p.i., WNV infection, dissemination and transmission rates did not differ significantly between the two groups. the 3' UTRs of CFAV, CFAV, CxFV, KRV and QBV are also of the expected size. however, the unusually long KRV 3'UTR resulted from an almost complete duplication of a precursor sequence. virus Partial NS5 b - - AB639347 Calbertado virus Partial NS5 - - - EU569288 Cell fusing agent virus Genome 10,695 113 556 NC_001564 Culex flavivirus Genome 10,834 91 657 NC_008604 Culex theileri flavivirus ORF - - - HE574574 Hanko virus ORF - - - all three viruses demonstrate an underutilization of UpA. similar observations were reported when the dinucleotide usage preferences of CFAV, CxFV and KRV were compared to that of multiple NKV and dual-host flaviviruses. a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was estimated using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method. the figure was produced using FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) all known cISFs use -1 PRF to express a novel overlapping gene (designated fifo) in the NS2A-NS2B regions of their genomes. the nucleotide sequences of all cISFs for which NS2A-NS2B data are available were analyzed. all cISFs contain a -1 PRF site just downstream of the predicted junction between the regions encoding NS1 and NS2A. the'slippery' heptanucleotide sequence at which the -1 nt shift occurs is highlighted in orange. CHAOV, LAMV and DONV contain a functionally utilized -1 PRF site encoding NS2B. frameshifting in cISFs is predicted to be stimulated by an RNA pseudoknot structure in the CFAV clade and an RNA stem-loop structure in the CxFV and HANKV clades. a host signal peptidase mediates cleavage between C/prM, prM/E, E/NS1 and 2K/NS4B. similar sites were identified at the predicted C/prM, prM/E, E/NS1 and 2K/NS4B junctions of most cISFs. the cleavage site of dual-host flaviviruses is signalase-like.

ILOV, LAMV or NANV did not replicate in avian, canine, hamster, monkey, mouse, mouse, snake or toad cells. the authors did not show an increase in viral genome copy number by quantitative RT-PCR. the experiments were performed using conventional RT-PCR. it is not clear whether the detected viral RNA was due to active virus replication or the presence of viral RNA in the original inoculum. all dISFs have been isolated from adult female mosquitoes or from mosquitoes of unspecified genders and life stages. in vivo mosquito infections similar to those described in 2c need to be screened for these viruses. the 5\u2019UTRs of CHAOV, DONV and NHUV are similar in length (99, 113 and 102 nt, respectively) to those of most other flaviviruses. the 3\u2019 UTR of NHUV (451 nt) is within the size range usually reported for flaviviruses. dISFs have higher CpG usage than dual-host flaviviruses. upA and CpG frequencies were calculated in two different ways. dISFs have higher CpG usage than dual-host flaviviruses. dISFs phylogenically affiliate with mosquito/vertebrate flaviviruses. CHAOV, LAMV, DONV and ILOV form a distinct clade. NHUV, BJV and NOUV form another clade. frameshifting would result in an alternative version of NS2B with a different C-terminal tail encoded by the -1 reading frame. in NOUV, a potential frameshift site (U UUU UUA with a 3'-adjacent predicted stem-loop structure) occurs in NHUV at a site around 25 codons upstream (again within NS2A) the exception to this rule is BJV which has Thr instead of Val at the -3 position. cISFs tend to use more varied signalase-like motifs at this site. cleavage is predicted to occur between QK and A.

NHUV replicates efficiently in Ae. albopictus (C6/36 and AA23) and Cx. quinquefasciatus (AE and A20) cells. CPE was first observed in NHUV-infected C6/36 cells at 3 and 6 days p.i. after the initial inoculation and second passage. in vivo mosquito infections similar to those described in 2c need to be performed to determine the importance of vertical, horizontal and mechanical transmission in dISF maintenance. only one study has assessed the in vitro superinfection exclusion potential of a dISF. a comparison of the dinucleotide usage preferences of NHUV to representative flaviviruses from the cISF, NKV and dual-host groups (CxFV, MODV and WNV) revealed that the CpG usage of NHUV was similar to that of WNV [73]. dISFs have higher CpG usage than dual-host flaviviruses. upA and CpG frequencies were calculated in two different ways. dISFs have lower CpG usage than dual-host flaviviruses. dISFs phylogenically affiliate with mosquito/vertebrate flaviviruses. CHAOV, LAMV, DONV and ILOV form a distinct clade. NHUV, BJV and NOUV form another clade. frameshifting at this site would yield a truncated version of NS2A. the site is not conserved in BJV or NHUV, but a different potential frameshift site occurs in NHUV at a site around 25 codons upstream. it remains unclear whether the NOUV, NHUV and BJV sites are chance features or functionally relevant -1 PRF sites. residue immediately downstream of virion C/anchor, pr/M, NS2A/NS2B, NS2B/NS3, NS3/NS4A, NS4A/2K and NS4B/NS5 cleavage sites. each dISF conforms to this rule at all of the aforementioned junctions.

ISFs are not associated with disease outbreaks due to their vertebrate-incompetent replication phenotype. additional research on ISFs is desirable because it will provide unique insight into medically important flaviviruses."}
