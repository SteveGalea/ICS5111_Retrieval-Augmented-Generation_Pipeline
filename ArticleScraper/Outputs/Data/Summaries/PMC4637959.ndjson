{"summary": "study involving consecutive subjects of ARDS treated with NIV using an oronasal mask. success of NIV, duration of NIV use, Intensive Care Unit stay, hospital mortality, and improvement in clinical and blood gas parameters were assessed. with increasing severity of ARDS, mortality increases from 27% in mild to 45% in severe ARDS. ARDS is further classified as extrapulmonary and pulmonary ARDS depending on the underlying cause. a prospective observational study assessing the efficacy of NIV in combination with standard therapy in patients with ARDS. a written informed consent was obtained from all the patients or their next of kin. NIV was started with inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) of 6\u20138 cm of H2O. increased by 2 cm to achieve clinical response in form of relief of dyspnea, respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min and maximum IPAP of 20 cm of H2O. all subjects were monitored for clinical (respiratory rate, blood pressure, sensorium, and others) arterial blood gases (ABG), respiratory rate, mental status, mean arterial blood pressure and PaO2/FiO2 values were recorded at the initiation of NIV and then at 1 h, 4 h. all the patients received deep venous thrombosis and stress ulcer prophylaxis as per the ICU protocol. Enteral route was preferred route of administration of nutrition. primary outcome was the success of NIV defined as the number of patients in whom endotracheal intubation was avoided. a logistic regression analysis was performed to derive adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals to analyze the factors predicting NIV failure. the study protocol was approved by the Institute's Ethics Committee and a written informed consent was obtained from all the patients or their next of kin. NIV was started with inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) of 6\u20138 cm of H2O. increased by 2 cm to achieve clinical response in form of relief of dyspnea. patients were weaned off NIV if they were able to maintain SpO2 92% on FiO2 of 30%. the diagnosis of malaria was based on the demonstration of malarial parasite in peripheral blood film or malaria antigen by commercially available rapid diagnostic test kit (Malaria Antigen [Pf/Pan] detection test device, Mediclone Biotech Private limited, India) performed at least twice. all the patients received deep venous thrombosis and stress ulcer prophylaxis. Enteral route was preferred route of administration of nutrition. primary outcome was the success of NIV defined as the number of patients in whom endotracheal intubation was avoided. a logistic regression analysis was performed to derive adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals to analyze the factors predicting NIV failure. a written informed consent was obtained from all patients or their next of kin. NIV was started with inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) of 6\u20138 cm of H2O. was gradually increased by 2 cm to achieve clinical response in form of relief of dyspnea, respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min and a tidal volume of 6\u20138 ml/kg ideal body weight. erial blood gases (ABG), respiratory rate, mental status, mean arterial blood pressure, and PaO2/FiO2 values were recorded at the initiation of NIV and then at 1 h, 4 h, and at the end of therapy. the diagnosis was based on the demonstration of malarial parasite in peripheral blood film or malaria antigen by commercially available rapid diagnostic test kit. the primary outcome was the success of NIV defined as the number of patients in whom endotracheal intubation was avoided. the secondary outcomes were duration of NIV, ICU stay, hospital mortality, and improvement in clinical and blood gas values at 1 and 4 h. Statistical significance was assumed at P 0.05. results There were 250 admissions during the study period. nine patients were excluded from the study. failure arm had a significantly higher APACHE II score at baseline. the median PaO2/FiO2 ratio at baseline was significantly higher in those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. there was no difference in the ICU stay between the two groups. in a recent study describing the early use of NIV in mild-to-moderate ARDS, only one of the 21 patients required intubation. tropical infections followed by abdominal sepsis were the most common causes of ARDS in the current study. the most important reason for high mortality in ARDS patients managed with NIV is the severe systemic illness. the most important reason for high mortality in ARDS patients managed with NIV is the severe systemic illness. study is a single center observational study comprising a small sample size. the results of the current study need to be confirmed in a multicenter study with a larger sample size."}
