{"summary": "nephropathogenic avian infectious bronchitis (IB) caused unprecedented economic losses to the commercial chicken industry in 2008-2009. eighty IBV isolates from different provinces during 2008-2009 were identified by dwarf embryo test and RT-PCR. the strains were mostly isolated in winter and spring with a wide age range of IB outbreaks, from 4 to 69 days. IBV has a single stranded positive-sense RNA genome encoding four structure proteins, phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein, small envelope protein (E), integral membrane glycoprotein (M), and spike glycoprotein (S). the globular S1 subunit forms the tip of a spike, extending outward, plays a role in attachment and entry into the host cell. recently, more than 20 serotypes within IBV have been identified worldwide. the complex epidemiology characterize of IB raised the control difficulty. nephropathogenic type IB has become more prevalent in china. 30 strains were isolated in October, while only seven strains were isolated in summer. the ages of flocks at the time of the outbreak varied between 4 and 69 days.

RT-PCR was carried out using the PrimeScriptTM One-Step RT-PCR Kit. one primer pair targeting the M gene (Ms: 5'-CCTAAGAACGGTTGGAAT-3', Mx: 5'-TACTCTCTCTACAC ACACAC-3') and another pair for the 3' UTR of genome. PCR products were cloned into pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China) for later sequencing. genetic variability and phylogenetic analysis. twenty-eight representative sequences available in geneBank contributed to comparison and phylogenetic analysis. the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the MEGA 4.1 software. each tree was produced using a consensus of 1000 bootstrap replicates. circulating field IBV isolates were selected from suspected broilers and broiler breeders from eastern, southern, southwestern and central china. allantoic fluids containing IBV isolates after 72 h post inoculation were harvested for subsequent experiments. RT-PCR and S1 gene sequencing were performed using the PrimeScriptTM One-Step RT-PCR Kit. PCR products were cloned into pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China) for later sequencing. genetic variability and phylogenetic analysis The S1 protein gene sequences obtained in this study were assigned the accession numbers of GU471864-GU471897, GU471793-GU471805. the multiple-alignment was carried out using the MEGA 4.1 software. each tree was produced using a consensus of 1000 bootstrap replicates [40].
