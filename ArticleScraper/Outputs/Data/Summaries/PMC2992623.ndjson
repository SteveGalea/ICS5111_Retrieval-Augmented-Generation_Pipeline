{"summary": "since 2003, china has made significant progress in its response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and is now seeing a reduction in the rate of increase of the AIDS epidemic. the government still remains the main service provider in China\u2019s AIDS response. over the past 20 years, there has been increased recognition from the Chinese government that the AIDS response requires involvement from all society. grass-roots CSOs are often unregistered or registered with the Ministry of Industrial and Commerce (MOIC) but only CSOs registered with the Ministry of Civil Affairs (MOCA) are legally recognized in China. the legal environment for AIDS CSOs remains rather restrictive. this is potentially a major obstacle to AIDS CSOs to effectively function in a sustainable manner and deliver services at scale. official registration for CSOs takes place with MOCA and criteria for registration are high. only one CSO working on an issue is allowed to register at each administrative level and groups working on the same issue are prohibited from coming together as a regional, provincial or national organization. GF Round 3 data is from GF Round 3 annual reports. more than 20 unregistered CSOs working on HIV/AIDS have annual budgets of USD7000. only four organizations have budgets of between USD20 000 and USD150 000. since 2002, the central government has been specifically investing in CSOs, but mainly in registered CSOs. these limitations on resources could hamper the ability of CSOs working on HIV/AIDS to deliver services on a large scale as well as affecting their sustainable development. number of registered and unregistered CSOs has increased significantly over the past two decades. the first AIDS-specific registered CSO, the Chinese Foundation for HIV/AIDS Control and Prevention, was founded in 1988. by 2006, the China HIV/AIDS Directory 2006/2007 included 100 Chinese CSOs actively working in the field. unregistered CSOs are becoming implementers in virtually all fields related to HIV/AIDS efforts, including education, high-risk behaviour interventions among target populations. some argue that this increased provision for CSOs to take up implementation roles because of the government's growing recognition of it. the impact of CSO involvement has not only increased in number and scope of work. some, such as AIDS Care China, are now also having a significant impact on AIDS programme indicators. ACC is an unregistered grass-roots civil society organization, led by PLHIV. ACC and the CGCO are impressive examples of capable and well-established CSOs implementing effective AIDS programmes in China. most unregistered HIV/AIDS CSOs are still in their infancy and have relatively limited capacity, especially in programme management. the legal environment for AIDS CSOs remains rather restrictive. this is potentially a major obstacle to AIDS CSOs to effectively function in a sustainable manner and deliver services at scale. official registration for CSOs takes place with MOCA and criteria for registration are high. only one CSO working on an issue is allowed to register at each administrative level and groups working on the same issue are prohibited from coming together as a regional, provincial or national organization. 77 781.18 488.59 445.51 \u2013 1898.06 China Global Fund AIDS Program Round 4 152.41 331.30 491.71 462.42 386.12 1823.96 China Global Fund AIDS Program Round 5 \u2013 87.90 215.86 203.31 205.31 712.39 China-MSD AIDS Program \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 1473.50 1311.94 2785.44. ed CSOs are typically unable to manage their own finances and bank accounts, making it difficult for them to mobilize large-scale resources. these limitations on resources could hamper the ability of CSOs working on HIV/AIDS to deliver services on a large scale and affecting their sustainable development. number of registered and unregistered CSOs has increased significantly over the past two decades, particularly since 2003. the first AIDS-specific registered CSO, the Chinese Foundation for HIV/AIDS Control and Prevention, was founded in 1988. by 2006, the China HIV/AIDS Directory 2006/2007 included 100 Chinese CSOs actively working in the field. unregistered CSOs are becoming implementers in virtually all fields related to HIV/AIDS efforts, including education, high-risk behaviour interventions among target populations such as MSM, MSM and sex workers. some argue that this increased provision for CSOs to take up implementation roles because of the government's growing recognition of it.
