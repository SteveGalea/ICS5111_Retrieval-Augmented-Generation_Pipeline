{"summary": "the recombinant protein-based, non-replicating subunit vaccines do not involve in an infectious agent in their production processes. many viruses, such as human noroviruses (huNoVs) cannot be cultivated efficiently to date,1 making vaccine development against huNoVs difficult and therefore, subunit vaccines the only choice. viruses have developed a common feature to assemble themselves efficiently. the viral structural proteins are able to spontaneously assemble into spherical or rod-shaped capsids. the basic driving force behind these self-assembled capsids is homotypic interactions of the viral capsid proteins. fusion of 2 dimeric viral proteins (in green and blue, respectively) forms a lineage polymer via intermolecular dimerization of the homologous proteins. this network viral protein polymer can be used as a trivalent vaccine. most of currently generated VLPs are made by a single capsid protein. recombinant VLPs are the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) VLPs made by co-expression of 4 structural proteins, including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins simultaneously using the baculovirus system. small subviral particles can also be constructed by generating truncated viral structural proteins. LPs, small subviral particles, and viral protein polymers have been further studied as vaccine candidates. a small subviral particle vaccine that is formed by truncated P1 and P2 domains of the HEV capsid protein has recently been developed as an HEV vaccine for humans in china. combination vaccines against different pathogens and diseases have reached the stage of clinical trials. many other combination vaccines have reached the stage of clinical trials. chimeric combination vaccines against both pathogens and diseases have also reached the stage of clinical trials. the vaccine is composed of nicotine in form of hapten 3\u2032-aminomethylnicotine conjugating to the exoprotein A complex of Pseudomonas aeruginosa38,39. another example is the vaccine VAX102Q (VaxInnate, Cranbury, New Jersey), a recombinant flagellin protein (a TLR5 ligand) with 4 tandem copies of M2e epitope of influenza virus fused at the C preclinical animal trials revealed high antibody titers specific to the inserted antigen/epitopes and the P particle platform. these data indicated that the huNoV P particle is an excellent platform for combination vaccine development. other combination vaccines under development include the 3 types of viral protein polymers. structures of norovirus (NoV), hepatitis E virus (HEV) and astrovirus (AstV) with indication of protruding (P) dimers on the capsid are shown in the top panel. dimeric viral proteins are ideal components for the viral protein polymer production. challenge and future direction Development of effective, non-replicating subunit vaccines based on many known neutralizing antigens or epitopes faces a common issue of low immunogenic the resulted polymer sizes may be dispersed, which may need better quality control. further development of different vaccine platforms with favorable features will facilitate the advancement of combination subunit vaccines against different human diseases."}
