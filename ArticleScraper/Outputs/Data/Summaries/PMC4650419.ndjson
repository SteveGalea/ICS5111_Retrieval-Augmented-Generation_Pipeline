{"summary": "since September 2012, 1 368 cases of human infection by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have officially been reported to world health organization as of 17 July 2015. symptoms caused by MERS-CoV infection, including fever, cough and shortness of breath1,2 are very similar to those caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SRAS-CoV), which had a fatality rate of 10% during its epidemic in 2002-20033. in coronaviruses, the viral component most frequently targeted by antibodies is the surface-located envelope spike (S) glycoprotein. the viral component most frequently targeted by antibodies is the surface-located envelope spike (S) glycoprotein, which is normally cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits to mediate receptor recognition and membrane fusion, respectively7,8,9,10. mice were immunized with recombinant MERS-RBD proteins prepared from insect high5 cells. mice were immunized with recombinant MERS-RBD proteins prepared from insect high5 cells. a panel of 77 clones was reactive with MERS-RBD, and was therefore further tested for the capacity to interfere with the MERS-RBD/hCD26 interaction. hCD26 was transiently expressed in BHK21 cells and tested by flow cytometry for MERS-RBD binding with or without the antibodies. hCD26 was transiently expressed in BHK21 cells and tested by flow cytometry for MERS-RBD binding with or without the antibodies. the binding avidity was calculated to be 60.3 nM for 2E6 and 162 nM for 4C2 respectively. the selected 4C2 and 2E6 mAbs were further tested for their potential to inhibit MERS-CoV entry into susceptible Huh7 cells with either pseudotyped or infectious viruses. the data showed that 4C2 and 2E6 competed with each other for the binding to MERS-RBD. these results suggest that both 4C2 and 2E6 inhibit MERS-CoV entry into host cells through blocking the virus binding to its cellular receptor hCD26.

Genbank accession number: AAX82494.1) was selected as the template for 4C2 humanization. the subsequent humanized sequence thereby comprises all the scaffold residues of aPFP3 and the amino acids of 4C2 CDRs. 50 was determined to be 1.8 g/ml (12 nM) with the pseudovirus and 6.25 g/ml (41.7 nM) with the live virus. the humanized antibody exhibits an almost identical efficacy to the parental mouse antibody in neutralizing the virus infection. a single dose of antibody was intravenously administered to mice one day before or after the MERS-CoV challenge. the viral load plateaued at 106 PFU/g tissue at 3 dpi and then decreased to 104PFU/g tissue at 3 dpi. each case, the viral load decreased by 2 orders of magnitude to 104.5 PFU/g tissue at 3 dpi and to lower than 102. two mouse neutralizing mAbs, 4C2 and 2E6, exhibit one to two digit nanomolar ND50 against MERS-CoV infection assessed using pseudotyped and infectious viruses. both mAbs were demonstrated to competitively inhibit the binding of hCD26 to MERS-RBD, disrupting virus/receptor interactions. the mAb 2E6 exhibits slightly better neutralization activity and a little higher binding affinity to MERS-RBD than 4C2. the mAb 2E6 exhibits slightly better neutralization activity and a little higher binding affinity to MERS-RBD than 4C2. humanization of 4C2 was instructed by the structure of the antibody bound to MERS-RBD. by switching its sequence to the homologous human antibody sequence, we managed to humanize the antibody maximally while simultaneously maintaining its binding capacity to the viral ligand. our work presents the advantage of structure-based humanization strategies. the coding sequences for MERS-CoV RBD were ligated into the pFastBac1 vector with 5\u2032-terminal gp67 signal peptide for protein secretion. the protein was purified by sequentially applying HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) and Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) the protein was also prepared as described7. the fragment of Fab was purified by HiTrap Protein A FF (GE Healthcare) and then exchanged to the buffer of 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl. complex preparation and crystallization MERS-CoV RBD and Fab fragment were mixed at a molar ration of 1:1. the humanized Fv genes were synthesized in Genewiz Company. the constant regions of the light chain and heavy chain were replaced with a human anti-influenza mAb CR8020 and human immunoglobulin heavy chain respectively. the light chain was fused to a hexa-His tag in C-terminus. the medium was changed without serum 6 h after transfection. cells were washed 3 times using PBS and incubated with TRITC-labeled anti-mouse secondary IgG antibodies (ZSGB-BIO) after 30 min, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry with a BD FACS Aria III machine. plasmids of 14 g pCAGGS-MERS-S and 7 g pNL4\u20133.luc.RE were cotransfected into 293T cells cultured in 100 mm dish. after 48 h, the supernatant containing pseudovirus was harvested, centrifuged and filtered through a 0.45 sterilized membrane. vero cells were seeded at 4.5 104 per well in a 96-well culture plate. dilutions of 0.05 ml of mAbs 4C2, 4C2h, 2E6 and an unrelated mAb L2 included as negative control were prepared. antibody-virus mixture was added into a 96-well microtiter plate containing equal volume of confluent Vero cells. adenoviral vectors expressing hCD26 (Ad5-hCD26) were prepared as previously described23.
