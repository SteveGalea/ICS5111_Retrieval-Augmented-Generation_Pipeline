{"summary": "gold nanoparticles have attracted significant interest as a novel platform in nanobiotechnology and biomedicine because of their convenient surface bioconjugation with molecular probes1. recently published examples include applications of GNPs to genomics, biosensorics, immunoassays, clinical chemistry. the authors concluded that GNPs penetrate only phagocytes, primarily the Kupffer cells of the liver. in a subsequent study,13 Sadauskas et al. reported that GNPs get localized in lysosomes (endosomes) of Kupffer cells. Yen et al. 17 noted that on the administration of GNPs, the number of macrophages decreases and their size increases. however, Lim et al.,18 using much larger (60 nm) hollow NSphs capped with dextran, and Zhang et al.,19 using 60 nm GNPs achieved results similar to the findings of Shukla et al. 16 for the same cell culture. nm nonconjugated GNPs can accumulate in tumor-specific macrophages. they can induce their cytotoxicity, causing tumor cells to die. the influence of colloidal gold on immunocompetent cells was examined in vivo. the penetration of gold nanorods and siO2-coated GNRs into macrophages induces the release of inflammatory mediators (cytokines, prostaglandins, etc.) and the activation of immune response genes. the published data26\u201329 indicate a significant role of surface coating in macrophage response after GNP uptake. tides are demethylated sites of microbial DNA that can activate macrophage immune response by interacting with the TLR-9 receptors. the immunostimulating activity of synthetic oligonucleotides may be analogous to that of oligonucleotides from bacterial DNA. a recent article by Walkey et al. 41 described the effect of coating GNPs with serum proteins and PEG on macrophage uptake. the authors studied the adsorption of 70 blood serum proteins to PEG-coated GNPs with different densities of PEG coating. the concept of a GNP\u2013protein corona is important in tuning the surface physicochemical properties of GNPs. the GNP\u2013protein corona is a dynamic biopolymer layer that can strongly affect cellular uptake owing to modification of the particle properties. as much as 69 plasma proteins can bind to the GNP surface. goldstein et al. 51 studied the cellular uptake of GNPs with or without exposure of cells to latrunculin A, a phagocytosis inhibitor. the results indicate a size dependence of the internalization mechanisms for macrophages (THP-1) cells. d in increased content of -interferon, the presentation by major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) of the antigen to CD4+ T cells, and activation of an epitope-specific immune response by cytotoxic T cells. the authors also noted the development of long dendrites and an increase in the cell-surface amount of MHC-II molecules. c cells and macrophages used TEM and flow fluorocytometry to quantify the uptake of GNRs by dendritic cells. compared to spherical GNPs, GNRs entered dendritic cells more effectively and induced higher expression of CD86 immunocostimulatory molecules. Sharma et al. 61 treated a murine B lymphocyte cell line (CH12.LX) with 10 nm citrate-stabilized GNPs. this treatment activated an NF-B-regulated luciferase reporter. this activation correlated with the altered B lymphocyte function. nanoparticle uptake by the immune cells greatly reduced uptake effectiveness for both types of GNPs. phagocytic cells took up GNPs two orders of magnitude more effectively than did, e.g., HeLa cells. c) monocytes and (d) lymphocytes treated with GNPs. ref. 64, 2009, Elsevier; ref. 55, 2010, Springer; ref. 65, 2013, The Royal Society of Chemistry; and ref. 61, 2013. the key role in macrophage uptake of GNPs is played by scavenger receptors. scavenger receptors are involved in endocytosis of apoptotic cells. cell preincubation with fucoidan and polyinosinic acid decreased uptake by 60%. small 30 nm particles use a broader range of internalization routes. phagocytosis began with an interaction of GNPs with scavenger receptors and was not attended by induction of proinflammatory cytokines. this interest is due to the physicochemical (nonspecific) theory of immunity proposed by J. Bordet. antibody biosynthesis is induced by substances possessing sufficiently developed structures (immunogenicity) many biologically active substances (vitamins, hormones, antibiotics, narcotics, etc.) have relatively small molecular masses and, as a rule, do not elicit a pronounced immune response. haptens are weakly immunogenic, but the choice of an optimal carrier (delivery system) is an important task when producing antibodies to low-molecular-weight compounds. this problem is solved by chemical attachment of a hapten to a protein matrix called a schlepper. vants.96 polymer compounds are produced by chain-radical polymerization of the corresponding monomers. polyelectrolytes are capable of antigen deposition at the sites of injection, enhancement of antigen presentation to immunocompetent cells, and induction of production of necessary cytokines. the haptens or complete antigens were directly conjugated to colloidal gold particles, mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant or alum. a number of papers were published whose authors applied and further developed this technique to obtain antibodies against glutamate. the use of antituberculin antibodies for immunoassay of mycobacteria described for the first time in ref. 137 and 138. the authors plan to use the GNP + tuberculin conjugates to obtain of diagnostic antibodies. based anti-tuberculosis vaccines can be considered as a new variant of theranostics. theranostics can be called 'prophylaxes + diagnostics' in 1993, Pow and Crook144 suggested attaching a hapten (-aminobutyric acid) to a carrier protein before conjugating this complex to colloidal gold. in 1996, Demenev et al. 156 showed for the first time the possibility of using colloidal gold particles as carriers for the protein antigen of the tick-borne encephalitis virus capsid. 174 suggested a new therapeutic vaccine based on the combination of myelin-associated inhibitors and GNPs for the treatment of rat medullispinal traumas. also, for GNP-assisted antigens, several groups reported new administration ways. the principle of DNA immunization is as follows: gene constructions coding for proteins to which one needs to obtain antibodies are introduced into an organism. if the gene expression is effective, these proteins serve as antigens for the development an immune response. a single recombinant vector can govern the synthesis of several antigens simultaneously, reducing the number of separate immunizations. this results in erasing problems connected with the difficulties of protein penetration into the organism. one can expect that DNA immunization will be among the most effective gene-therapy methods in the coming years. antibody titers obtained during immunization of rabbits with Yersinia antigen are reduced. the amount of antigen required is reduced, as compared with that needed with some conventional adjuvant. high-molecular weight antigens stimulate the respiratory activity of cells of the reticuloendothelial system and the activity of macrophage mitochondrial enzymes. this fact seems the most interesting aspect of manifestation of immunogenic properties by colloidal gold. a tenfold increase in proliferation was found compared with that observed on the addition of the native antigen. the interaction of cells of the immune system with GNPs was very actively examined by dobrovolskaia's group. despite the many obstacles, significant progress in our understanding of nanoparticle interaction with the components of the immune system has been achieved. hypothetical mechanisms of immunomodulatory effects of nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 8 and 9.234,235 Fig. 8. the stimulation/suppression of the immune system depends on the nature of the NPs and results in different outcomes. a nanoparticle conjugate with an absorbed or capsulated antigen can serve as an adjuvant for the optimization of immune response after vaccination. we believe that both nanoparticle classes \u2013 GNPs and biodegradable nanoparticles \u2013 will compete on equal footing for the development of next-generation vaccines. many researchers believe that the key role in macrophage uptake of GNPs is played by scavenger receptors. however, the interaction of functionalized GNPs with cells of the immune system is far from being understood in more or less detail."}
