{"summary": "arenaviruses are divided into two complexes, Old World (OW) and New World (NW), based on initial geographical isolation and serological cross-reactivity. OW viruses include the most prominent human arenavirus pathogen, Lassa virus (LASV), clades A, B, and C (2). no postexposure countermeasures are currently licensed to prevent arenavirus disease in infected humans. passive transfer of human plasma-derived antibodies has been shown to protect humans against disease caused by LASV, JUNV, and MACV in a postexposure setting. candid#1 is used to prevent JUNV infection in argentina. however, it is unlikely to function as a postexposure therapeutic. this vaccine is limited to high-risk populations. DNA vaccination involves the delivery of genetic information encoding a target antigen directly into host cells. subsequent expression of the gene product(s) within the host leads to adaptive immune responses. hek293T (293T) cells were used for all transfection assays. work with virulent arenaviruses was performed in biosafety level 4 (BSL4) containment areas. GP2 was created using the 5\u2032 primer GGGGCTAGCGGCCTTCAAAATCGGACTCCACAC. for both GP1 and GP2, the forward primers generated an NheI site and the reverse primers created a BglII site and also included a stop codon. PCR products were cloned into the NheI and BglII sites of a modified pWRG7077 (pWRG/CBDfuse) a concentration of 0.125 mg per plasmid (0.5 mg total) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in a total volume of 0.5 ml per injection. the anti-JUNV murine MAbs were obtained from the USAMIID hybridoma collection. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. 10,000 cells were analyzed for each sample by using live gating. a total of 10,000 cells were analyzed for each sample. plates were incubated for 6 days in a 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2 and 80 to 85% humidity. cells were stained with 2 ml of solid overlay mixture that also included 5% neutral red (Gibco) the percent neutralization was calculated relative to that of no-antibody controls. titer represents reciprocal of highest dilution resulting in 50% reduction in plaques. PsV were concentrated further by pelleting the virus through a 0.22-m filter. the pellet was resuspended and stored at 70\u00b0C. the number of focus-forming units (FFU)/ml was determined for the PsV. sera were diluted 1:10, followed by 5-fold serial dilutions. cEMEM was mixed with 105 FFU/ml of the specific pseudovirion of interest and 10% guinea pig complement (Cedarlane) this mixture was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C, and then 50 l was inoculated onto Vero cell monolayers in a clear-bottom plate. antiserum or purified antibody at the indicated concentrations was injected subcutaneously (s.c.) at the time points indicated in a total volume of 1 ml buffered with PBS. animals meeting criteria were humanely euthanized. the codon-optimized full-length arenavirus glycoprotein (GPc) genes were synthesized de novo. genes were cloned into the notI and BglII sites of the pWRG7077 vector. GP2 was created using the 5\u2032 primer GGGGCTAGCGGCAAAAACATTCAGCTGCCTAGGAGAT. for both GP1 and GP2, the forward primers generated an NheI site and the reverse primers created a BglII site and also included a stop codon. PCR products were cloned into the NheI and BglII sites of a modified pWRG7077 (pWRG/CBDf in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in a total volume of 0.5 ml per injection. serum were collected from animals after days 0, 42, 56, and 70. purified IgG antibodies were used instead of antisera. a total of 10,000 cells were analyzed for each sample by using live gating. for GP1 and GP2 surface staining, 293T cells transfected with CBP-GP1 and CBP-GP2 were incubated with fresh 293T cells for 3 h and washed with FACS buffer. cells were incubated for an additional 24 h in a 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2 and 80 to 85% humidity. the titer represents the reciprocal of the highest dilution. the titer represents the reciprocal of the highest dilution. PsV were concentrated further by pelleting the virus through a 30% sucrose cushion prepared in TNE buffer (10 mM Tris, 135 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) pellet was resuspended and stored at 70\u00b0C. cEMEM was mixed with 105 FFU/ml of the specific pseudovirion of interest and 10% guinea pig complement (Cedarlane) this mixture was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C, and then 50 l was inoculated onto Vero cell monolayers in a clear-bottom, black-walled plate (Corning) the medium was discarded, and cells were lysed according to the protocol of a luciferase kit (Promega animals were weighed and monitored for fever daily. all challenges were performed in CDC-certified BSL4 containment facilities. animals meeting criteria were humanely euthanized. four rabbits were vaccinated with pWRG/JUN-GPc(opt) three times at 4-week intervals. sera were all positive for anti-GP antibodies after the second (day 42) and third (days 56 and 70) vaccinations. Rabbit glycoprotein-specific antisera also interacted with Vero cells infected with JUNV strains candid#1, XJ13, and Romero by immunofluorescence assay. antibodies targeting both GP1 and GP2 were produced in rabbits vaccinated with pWRG/JUN-GPc(opt) a flow-based assay by individually fusing the JUNV GP1 and GP2 molecules to the C-terminal end of a cell-binding protein (CBP) derived from the orthopoxvirus type I interferon decoy receptor. a novel technique circumvents the need to incorporate transmembrane anchoring domains because target antigens are secreted. when cells are mixed with culture supernatant containing the target antigen fused to CBP, there is nearly 100% labeling of cell populations with the target antigen. cells decorated with either CBP-GP1 or CBP-GP2 were then incubated with antisera from all four vaccinated rabbits or with prevaccination sera. anti-JUNV glycoprotein antiserum administered postchallenge protects guinea pigs from JUNV lethal challenge. the protective efficacy of DNA vaccine-produced antibodies was assessed in the Hartley guinea pig model. prior to infection studies, the half-life of rabbit anti-JUNV GPc antisera in guinea pigs was determined to be 7 days. two animals in group 2 developed late-stage paralysis starting on days 18 and 21 and were euthanized (Table 1). treatment starting on day 6 failed to protect animals from lethality but did extend the MTD to day 19.0. one animal died (day 18) and five were euthanized between days 16 and 21. a skull-and-crossbones symbol indicates an infection nonsurvivor. an asterisk represents an animal whose temperature implant was reading erroneously. the dashed line indicates the normal maximum temperature for guinea pigs. a 293 positive cells were transfected with either an NP- or GP-expressing plasmid. the percentage of positive cells was determined using flow cytometry and FlowJo software. the percentage of positive cells was determined using flow cytometry and FlowJo software. neutralizing antibodies were detected in the sera of most surviving or euthanized animals. highest neutralizing titers were observed in the three surviving animals. guinea pigs had guinea pig-specific anti-glycoprotein antibodies. in guinea pigs, JUNV viremia is detectable starting on day 6. one animal in the day 12 group died before serum could be collected. i.m. EP produced neutralizing antibodies against other human-pathogenic south american arenaviruses. cross-binding of antibodies targeting the glycoproteins of JUNV, MACV, and GTOV was examined by ELISA. anti-JUNV glycoprotein antisera from all four rabbits interacted with the MACV antigen, with a log10 GMT of 2.0. this was 2 orders of magnitude lower than that for homologous antisera targeting MACV. the indicated PsV were incubated with serially diluted antiserum samples. the endpoint titer was determined as the highest dilution. cross-neutralization of sera targeting pWRG/JUN-GPc(opt) or pWRG/MAC-GPc(opt) were tested in the same manner as that described in the legend to Fig. 1. no cross-neutralizing responses were detected using anti-GTOV antiserum against particles pseudotyped with the MACV glycoprotein. only one rabbit with antibodies targeting JUNV had a detectable neutralizing response against particles pseudotyped with the GTOV glycoprotein. the PRNT80 titers were 10,240, 10,240, and 40,960 against JUNV, MACV, and GTOV. the antibodies were combined so that the cocktail could be administered at a dose of 7,500 TU/kg/target in PBS. infected guinea pigs were treated with the cocktail on day 2 and day 7 postinfection. guinea pigs were injected i.p. with 2,000 PFU of JUNV. the control group (NEG) received a purified anti-SNV glycoprotein IgG antibody. survival and weights were plotted as described in the legend to Fig. 3. guinea pigs infected with MACV strain Carvallo did not display signs of illness. however, sera taken at 30 days postchallenge revealed a significant difference in postchallenge anti-MACV neutralizing antibody responses. control animals had significantly higher levels of MACV neutralizing antibodies than those that received the cocktail. this result was confirmed by PSVNA50 GMTs of 23 and 812. vaccinated rabbits developed neutralizing antibodies against each target. highest responses were against SABV, with a PRNT50 GMT of 1,174. weakest responses were against MACV, with a PRNT50 GMT of 1,174. pWRG/JUN-GPc(opt) produced an authentic JUNV glycoprotein. four rabbits were vaccinated with pWRG/JUN-GPc(opt) three times at 4-week intervals. sera were all positive for anti-GP antibodies after the second (day 42) and third (days 56 and 70) vaccinations. cells were incubated with anti-JUNV GPc antibody MAb-GB03 or MAb-QC03 (dashed gray line) cells were then stained with an anti-mouse\u2013Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody. data were plotted with FlowJo software. cell-binding protein (CBP) derived from the orthopoxvirus type I interferon decoy receptor. cells are mixed with culture supernatant containing the target antigen fused to CBP. cells decorated with either CBP-GP1 or CBP-GP2 were then incubated with antisera from all four vaccinated rabbits or with prevaccination sera. each colored line represents one of the four rabbits. anti-JUNV glycoprotein antiserum administered postchallenge protects guinea pigs from JUNV lethal challenge. the protective efficacy of DNA vaccine-produced antibodies administered postchallenge was assessed in the Hartley guinea pig model. erum starting on day 4 lost weight starting between days 10 and 14. two animals in group 2 developed late-stage paralysis, starting on days 18 and 21, and were euthanized (Table 1). the MTD for this group was 23.5 days, and only two animals (33%) survived infection. treatment starting on day 6 failed to protect animals from lethality. maximum temperatures were graphed over a 28-day period. asterisk represents an animal whose temperature implant was reading erroneously. dashed line indicates the normal maximum temperature for guinea pigs. a 293 positive cells were transfected with either an NP- or GP-expressing plasmid. the percentage of positive cells was determined using flow cytometry and FlowJo software. c PRNT50 assays were performed using JUNV strain Romero (challenge virus) neutralizing antibodies were detected in the sera of most surviving or euthanized animals. the highest neutralizing titers were observed in the three surviving animals from group 3 (animals 14 and 15) viremia was undetectable until day 6 when titers were detected in two of three animals. titers rose precipitously thereafter, with a day 12 GMT of 2.2 106 PFU/ml. in guinea pigs, viremia is detectable starting on day 6. cross-binding and neutralization of antibodies targeting the glycoproteins of JUNV, MACV, and GTOV was examined by ELISA. anti-JUNV glycoprotein antisera from all four rabbits interacted with the MACV antigen, with a log10 GMT of 2.0. this was 2 orders of magnitude lower than that for homologous antisera targeting MACV. cross-binding was highest between MACV and JUNV samples. indicated PsV were incubated with serially diluted antiserum samples. followed by an HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. endpoint titer was determined as the highest dilution. anti-GTOV antiserum failed to cross-neutralize particles pseudotyped with the MACV glycoprotein. only one rabbit with antibodies targeting JUNV had a detectable neutralizing response against particles pseudotyped with the MACV glycoprotein. we produced a cocktail of purified IgG antibodies derived from rabbits vaccinated with the three different DNA vaccines. the antibodies were combined so that the cocktail could be administered at a dose of 7,500 TU/kg/target in PBS. the protective efficacy of this cocktail was tested in guinea pigs infected with JUNV strain Romero, GTOV, or MACV. guinea pigs were injected i.p. with 2,000 PFU of JUNV. on days 2 and 7, the indicated animals were injected s.c. with the antibody cocktail. survival and weights were plotted as described in the legend to Fig. 3. however, GTOV was used as the challenge virus. three of six guinea pigs receiving the cocktail developed an elevated temperature (40.0\u00b0C) on day 7 that dropped to a normal level on day 8. guinea pigs infected with MACV strain Carvallo did not display signs of illness. however, sera taken at 30 days postchallenge revealed a significant difference in postchallenge anti-MACV neutralizing antibody responses. rabbits were vaccinated twice at 3-week intervals with a needle-free DSJI device. Vaccinated rabbits developed neutralizing antibodies against each target. highest responses were against SABV, with a PRNT50 GMT of 1,174. the prototype virus used in these studies was JUNV. there are no serotypes among JUNV strains. but strain variability in neutralizing titers is common. vaccinia virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus vectors were target animals. but most of these studies used guinea pigs as target animals and were focused on producing active vaccines. in one recent study, the PRNT50 GMT against JUNV strain Candid#1 was 30 (41), compared to 46,915 in our study. PRNT titers produced by the combination vaccine were lower than those for animals vaccinated with the individual targets by i.m. EP. there was no evidence of immune interference between the four arenavirus DNA vaccines, nor was the dominance of a response against any one of the four viruses observed. the ability of antibodies targeting the MACV glycoprotein to cross-neutralize JUNV directly correlated with the ability of the polyclonal antisera to bind GP1. the ability of cross-neutralizing antibodies interact with heterologous GP1 based on the tertiary structure of the neutralizing epitope. titers associated with cross-neutralizing polyclonal sera are too low for these to be useful as a cross-protective therapeutic. titers associated with cross-neutralizing polyclonal sera are too low for these to be useful as a cross-protective therapeutic. guinea pig and nonhuman primate animal models can be recapitulated. viremia started on day 6 and increased substantially in subsequent days. findings consistent with those of Kenyon et al. who extensively examined antibody-mediated protection against JUNV in guinea pigs. late-stage encephalitis has been observed in guinea pigs receiving antibody therapy (8). but these symptoms resolve after several weeks, without long-term sequelae. it will be of interest to study guinea pigs that develop encephalitis. MACV strain Carvallo was not lethal in Hartley guinea pigs. animals showed no signs of illness (e.g., fever or weight loss) this finding was unexpected given that previous studies have shown the carvallo strain to be >60% lethal in guinea pigs. DNA vaccine technology can be used to produce anti-arenavirus neutralizing antibodies capable of protection in models of lethal argentine and Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever. the same approach could be used in standard animal systems used to produce animal-derived polyclonal antibodies to treat intoxication, envenomization, or infection. the use of polyclonal antibodies targeting multiple epitopes on the viral glycoproteins might help prevent the emergence of viruses capable of escaping the inhibitory effects of the product. DNA vaccine technology combined with traditional systems, or novel approaches such as the Tc bovine system, could be used to produce candidate anti-arenavirus neutralizing antibodies. titers against strain Romero were 3-fold lower (PRNT50 titer = 17,222) the highest PRNT50 titer generated in that study was 11,171, against the targeted JUNV strain IV4454. a paucity of published data regarding neutralizing titers against these viruses prevents comparisons. PRNT50 titers against MACV and GTOV were lower than that against JUNV, by 3.4- and 1.6-fold, respectively. this may reflect differences in immunogenicity among the three glycoproteins. anti-glycoprotein antibodies poorly cross-neutralize different south american arenaviruses. the serological relatedness of arenaviruses has been investigated extensively. the findings indicate antibodies targeting NP are most broadly cross-reactive, with interactions reported between the more distant NW and OW complexes. the development of cross-neutralizing antibodies against some NW arenaviruses has been observed previously. nonhuman primates vaccinated with high doses, but not low doses, of JUNV vaccine strain candid#1 develop antibodies that cross-neutralize MACV (49). Interestingly, animals receiving low and high doses of candid#1 are equally protected against MACV, suggesting that detectable levels of prechallenge neutralizing antibodies are not a prerequisite for vaccine-mediated protection complete protection by postchallenge administration of rabbit-produced antibodies was possible only if treatment was initiated by day 2. surviving animals developed guinea pig-specific anti-NP responses. viremia started on day 6 and increased substantially in subsequent days. erum used in the Kenyon study was produced against whole virus. it targeted multiple arenavirus proteins, including NP, GP1 and GP2. this is the first study demonstrating that glycoprotein-specific antibodies can protect against NW arenavirus challenge. a dose of 7,500 TU/kg was half that in the antiserum (15,000 TU/kg) the cocktail of purified antibodies also protected guinea pigs against two other south american arenaviruses: GTOV and MACV. guinea pigs developed significantly higher levels of convalescent-phase neutralizing antibodies than animals receiving the cocktail (t test; P = 0.006) this suggests that the cocktail limited MACV infection in guinea pigs, thus limiting the humoral response. studies are under way to determine the cause of the attenuation. DNA vaccine technology was combined with transchromosomal (Tc) bovines that produce human IgG (58) to generate candidate immunotherapeutic products targeting hantaviruses (59) and Ebola virus (60) this technology could be used to produce human polyclonal antibodies."}
