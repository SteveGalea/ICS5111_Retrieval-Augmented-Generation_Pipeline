{"summary": "HIV-1 is the prototype example of a virus that uses an oligomannose-rich \u201cglycan shield\u201d to occlude functionally important domains of the envelope glycoproteins from antibodies. previous measurement of the proportion of oligomannose NLG relative to complex NLG on recombinant HIV envelope glycoproteins underestimated the representation of oligomannose NLG on the native envelope spikes of HIV-1. oligomannose-specific lectins have potent in vitro HIV-1 inhibitory activities. they have been proposed as microbicide candidates for topical prophylaxis of HIV-1 infection. but many lectins possess lymphocyte mitogenic activities incompatible with their use as pharmaceuticals. pharmacological basis for their toxicity is poorly characterized. GRFT has the most potent and broad spectrum HIV-1 inhibitory activity yet described for any antiviral lectin [15], [23], [24], [25]. it is a 25 kDa domain-swapped homodimer, with the first 16 amino acids of each 12.7 kDa monomer completing the -prism fold of the other [26]. GRFT is fully active in the presence of macaque vaginal secretions [25]. GRFT induced minimal alterations in the expression profile of a panel of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines. GRFT strongly inhibited HIV-1 infection of the cervical explants, and dissemination of HIV-1 infection from cells resident in the explants to donor T-cells. the light micrograph in Figure 1A shows an H&E stained cervical tissue section to orient the observer to the microanatomy of the human cervical epithelium. different layers of the squamous epithelium starting at the basement membrane are evident; cervical connective tissue or stroma is beneath the basement membrane. the binding of CV-N to PBMC was reduced, but not eliminated, by yeast mannan binding. in the first column we depict fluorescence micrographs that show binding of GRFT to paraffin-embedded cervical tissue sections. GRFT (I.), GRFTLec- (J.) and CV-N (K.) retains its antiviral activity. freshly-isolated PBMC were pre-incubated for 24 hrs with GRFT at various concentrations, washed and then infected with HIV-1 R5 strain BaL. GRFT inhibited viral replication for 9 days of cell culture. ectocervical cell lines to concentrations of up to 1 mg/ml (84 M) GRFT, at least 10-times more concentrated than a likely microbicide formulation. treatment with 1 M ConA killed approximately 94% of the ectocervical cells and vaginal keratinocytes, and 80% of the endocervical cells. treatment with lectins ConA and PHA at doses (0.37 M ConA and 10 g/ml PHA) that do not negatively affect cell viability resulted in completely different flow cytometric plots. a subpopulation composed of larger cells (higher forward scatter FSC) with perceptibly higher side scatter (SSC) values gated in region R2. cell proliferation was measured by the incorporation of BrdU in newly synthesized DNA using a colorimetric assay. cells without BrdU were assessed as a negative control according to manufacturer's intructions. 1.2% PBMC in average were double positive (CD4+/CD25+) treatment with PHA and ConA resulted in an impressive increase in the number of CD4+/CD25+ cells. GRFT treatment did not affect significantly the proportion of CD4+/CD69+ PBMC compared with PBS treatment. PBMC were cultured in the presence of 10 g/ml GRFT (788 nM) for 72 h. a detailed overview of the cytokine profiles of GRFT-treated PBMC from multiple blood donors is given in Fig. 7. fold increase values obtained from the different donors were divided over different ranking groups. the number in each rank is given as a percentage of the total and indicated by a specific color. GRFT induces significantly less response from PBMC than has been previously reported. the amount of fold-increase values for each chemokine/cytokine is given as percentage in the total amount of donors (Y-axis) the amount of fold-increase values for each chemokine/cytokine is given as percentage in the total amount of donors (Y-axis) the supernatants showed barely detectable levels of IL-1b and IL-2. in contrast, all three cell lines produced impressive amounts of these cytokines upon incubation in presence of ConA. treatment of cervical epithelial cell lines End1/E6E7 and Ect1/E6E7 with GRFT (8 M), ConA (2 M) or PBS resulted in similar levels of IL-6 secretion. a multiplexed Luminex assay of the Ect1/E6E7 cell line treated with GRFT confirmed that the Ect1 cells behaved very similarly to human cervical explants. ELISA experiments for detection of IL-1b (A), IL-2 (B), IL-6 (C) and IL-8 (D) after 24 hours treatment of cervico-vaginal cells with 2 M ConA (black), 8 M GRFT (grey) and PBS a first analysis using Benjamini-Hochberg low stringency correction with a cutoff of 2.0 yielded 107 and 35 entries as differentially expressed in samples treated with 1 and 4 M GRFT. the entries which showed an increased gene expression after treatment with 1 M GRFT included a gene annotated as immunoglobulin-like and fibronectin type III domain containing 1 (IGFN1). cAMP mediated signaling (CALML5, PKIB) and acute phase response signaling (HMOX1, SOD2) also identified five toxicological functions with an overrepresentation of genes including liver hyperbilirubinemia and steatohepatitis. none of these is relevant to mucosal treatment with GRFT. expression of 14 genes was studied using 18S RNA and -actin mRNA as controls. GRFTLec- was used as a control to distinguish binding mediated by the GRFT carbohydrate binding pockets versus binding associated with other GRFT structures. different layers of the squamous epithelium starting at the basement membrane are evident; cervical connective tissue or stroma is beneath the basement membrane. fluorescently labeled GRFT, GRFTLec- and CV-N efficiently bind the surface of human PBMC relative to GRFTLec-. binding of CV-N to PBMC was significantly reduced when occluding the glycan binding pockets by pre-incubation with yeast mannan. hPMBCs treated with fluorescently labeled GRFT (I.), GRFTLec- (J.) and CV-N (K.) the X-axis shows increasing fluorescence intensity from left to right. the Y-axis shows percentage of labeled cells in the sample. GRFT inhibited viral replication for 9 days of cell culture. a 3 day exposure of the endocervical and ectocervical cell lines to concentrations of up to 1 mg/ml (84 M) GRFT did, however, slightly reduce viability of the vaginal keratinocytes. treatment with 1 M ConA killed approximately 94% of the ectocervical cells and 80% of the endocervical cells. cells treated with 1 or 4 M GRFT had flow cytometry profiles similar to the control cells (Fig. 4A, B and C) treatment with lectins ConA and PHA at doses (0.37 M ConA and 10 g/ml PHA) that do not negatively affect cell viability resulted in completely different flow cytometric plots, with emergence of a subpopulation composed of larger cells. a subpopulation with increased size and higher SSC was gated in region R2. a subpopulation with increased size and higher SSC was gated in region R2. a subpopulation with increased size and higher SSC was gated in region R2. PBMC were incubated in the presence of the test compounds for 72 hours. positive controls were 10 g/ml PHA [20], as well as 0.37 M ConA, chosen as this concentration was not cytotoxic. treatment with PHA and ConA resulted in an impressive increase in the number of CD4+/CD25+ cells. PBMC were cultured in the presence of 10 g/ml GRFT (788 nM) for 72 h. cytokine profiles of GRFT-treated PBMC from multiple blood donors are shown in Fig. 7. the fold increase values obtained from the different donors were divided over different ranking groups. the number in each rank is given as a percentage of the total and indicated by a specific color. the only chemokine induced weakly by GRFT in the majority of donors was MCP-1 [19] the fold-increase values are divided in subgroups: 1\u20133 fold-increase (white squares), 3\u201310 fold-increase (yellow squares), 10\u2013100 fold-increase (orange squares), 100\u2013500 fold-increase (dark red squares) the amount of fold-increase values for each chemokine/cytokine is given as percentage in the total amount of donors (Y-axis) 1/E6E7, Ect1/E6E7 and VK2E6E7 cell culture supernatants showed barely detectable levels of IL-1b and IL-2, similar to the cells treated with PBS. in contrast, all three cell lines produced impressive amounts of these cytokines upon incubation in presence of ConA (Fig. 8A and B) the ectocervical epithelium is an important point of mucosal transmission of HIV-1. we focused on the Ect1/E6E7 cell line to derive a more comprehensive assessment of the effect of GRFT treatment on cytokine production by the cultured ectocervical cells. a multiplexed Luminex assay of the cells treated with GRFT confirmed that the cells behaved very similarly to human cervical explants. treatment of Ect1/E6E7 with 1 M GRFT resulted in minor changes in expression profile. 4 M GRFT appeared to alter expression of many genes but to a lesser extent compared to CV-N (0.5 and 4 M) and ConA at 1 M. no gene was identified as regulated by 0.1 M GRFT. expression of 14 genes was studied using 18S RNA and -actin mRNA as controls. cells were treated with CV-N (0.05, 0.5 and 1 M), ConA (1 M), GRFT (0.1, 1 and 4 M), GRFTLec- (1 and 8 M) or PBS before RNA isolation. ins have received considerable attention as potential antiviral drugs in vivo. there are reports of impressive in vivo efficacy of CV-N in animal models of HIV-1 prevention [17], [18], influenza prevention and treatment [28], and of GRFT in prevention of SARS-CoV infection [30]. the pharmacological basis of natural product lectin toxicity is generally poorly understood, but at a basic mechanistic level is thought to reside in the lectins' capacity both proteins have comparable HIV-1 neutralization activities. GRFT targeting terminal mannose residues found on Man5\u20139-GlcNAc2 [13] and CV-N specific for the Man12Man linkages found on Man6\u20139-GlcNAc2 [31], [32]. if anything, GRFT would be predicted to bind to a larger number of glycan targets than CV-N since it can bind more promiscuously than GRFT throughout the cervical epithe GRFT retains antiviral activity even when complexed to the surface of PBMC. fewer than all six carbohydrate binding sites are occupied when the lectin is docked on cell surface glycoprotein/s. fewer than all six carbohydrate binding sites are occupied when the lectin is docked on cell surface glycoprotein/s. the IC50 for GRFT in the washed PBMC assay is 0.78 nM. activity of GRFT persists for 24 hrs, although a high concentrations. but GRFT's activity persists substantially longer, a property that may facilitate non-coitally linked administration of microbicides containing GRFT as an active ingredient. oligomannose glycans characterized ectocervical, endocervical and vaginal keratinocyte cell lines End1/E6E7, Ect1/E6E7 and VK2E6E7. they were originally established from normal human endocervical, ectocervical, and vaginal epithelia. the immortalized cell lines were shown to have close resemblance to those of their respective tissues of origin high concentrations of GRFT had little to no effect on the secretion of cytokines/chemokines studied. GRFT at these concentrations does not alter the secretion of the immune system mediators by cervico-vaginal cells in a significant fashion. a total of 444 probe sets fell in this category after treating the cells 12 h with 10% human seminal plasma. this is in sharp contrast to treatment with 4 M GRFT, a level at least 1,000 fold greater than the average antiviral EC50. GRFT, an exceptionally potent antiviral lectin, has very minor effects on the molecular physiology of human cells. endotoxin levels were measured using the toxinSensorTM chromogenic LAL endotoxin assay kit from GenScript (Piscataway, NJ) only products with final Endotoxin readings less than 0.05 Endotoxin Units (EU) per milligram were used in the in vitro studies. non-fat dry milk in PBS+0.05% Tween (PBS-T; Immunowash, Bio-Rad) washed before addition of serial dilutions of lectin analyte. a primary polyclonal antiserum (rabbit anti-GRFT or CV-N or Alexa-Fluor 488-labelled conjugates thereof) was added for 1 h at room temperature. the cervico-vaginal cell lines were grown as previously described [38] in keratinocyte serum-free medium (KSFM) supplemented with recombinant human epidermal growth factor (0.1 ng/ml), bovine pituitary extract (50 g/ml), calcium chloride (0.4 mM) and an antibiotic cocktail composed of penicillin and streptomycin at final concentrations of 100 U/ml and 100 g/ml respectively. cells were seeded onto eight-well lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalgene Nunc) in duplicate at 10,000 cells per well and allowed to incubate at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. after eight hours the fluorescently labeled proteins of interest were added to the wells and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. the supernatant of each sample was collected after 9 days and viral replication measured by a specific p24 Ag ELISA. 104 cells per well were seeded (96 well plates), the test reagents added and the cultures incubated for three days in a humid environment with 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. the medium was gently removed and the insoluble purple formazan product dissolved in DMSO to yield a colored solution which absorbance was read at 570 nm with data were acquired and analyzed using CellQuest Pro from BD.
