{"summary": "children between 0.5 and 5 y of age have the highest risk of becoming infected with RSV (Fig. 1 C and D and 2) and the highest risk of transmitting RSV if infected (Fig. 2). targeting these young children between 0.5 and 5 y of age for RSV vaccination is predicted to be highly efficient. this indirect protection that arises from vaccinating children is so substantial that it is even predicted to avert more cases in adults than would a vaccination program directly targeted the adults row identifies an age group that can be infected. the color at the intersection of the row and column indicates the number of secondary infections attributed to a single infective case. the average number of secondary cases from the source age group is tabulated in the rightmost column. the transmission model was calibrated to age-stratified RSV weekly incidence in four states across the united states. the model recapitulated RSV weekly trends and the age distribution of those individuals infected. the model predicted the week 3 peak of RSV infections in Texas and the week 7 peak of RSV infections in California. all age groups were most likely to infect individuals in their own age group or individuals under 5 y of age. in the first month of the season, children are predicted to transmit RSV to 3.2- to 3.9-fold as many people as individuals older than 50 y of age. children are predicted to transmit RSV to 3.2- to 3.9-fold as many people as individuals older than 50 y of age. vaccinating children in Pennsylvania with a 60% efficacious vaccine is predicted to avert 56% of infections in children. if the entire population is vaccinated, about 10-fold more doses would be needed to achieve reductions of 65% in children and 75% in adults. the difference between effectiveness and efficiency was predicted across states. around 30% of individuals vaccinated in Texas would not be vaccinated until after the RSV season had started. if the vaccines were administered together, around 30% would not be vaccinated until after the RSV season had started. nearly 90% of those individuals who will be vaccinated already have been vaccinated before the RSV season begins. vaccinating children with a 60% efficacious vaccine could reduce as much as 75% of RSV infection in children and the elderly combined. a challenge is that the RSV season typically occurs earlier than the influenza season. vaccinating young children remained the most efficient and effective strategy. this assumption is conservative with regard to our finding that vaccinating children is much more effective than vaccinating the elderly. to model age-dependent transmission, we stratified the population into eight age groups: 0\u20135 mo, 6\u201311 mo, 1 y, 2\u20134 y, 5\u201324 y, 25\u201349 y, 50\u201364 y, and 65 y. the assumption is supported by prospective studies demonstrating that reinfection in the same season is rare (1), yet possible (42). we combined the daily viral load data with daily probabilities of withdrawal from social interaction for children (25) and symptomatic adults based on surveys of individuals infected with RSV in the united states. perceived severity of RSV symptoms and the consequent change in social activity was measured twice daily for 2 wk. the patterns of daily withdrawal from social interaction exhibited in the survey were consistent with results from other experimental studies. we parameterized vaccination uptake from state-specific monthly influenza vaccine coverage data for different age groups as observed from 2010 to 2014. the latter is likely to elicit only a systemic response and not a mucosal response, whereas the latter stimulates both. no prospective studies estimating rates of RSV in children are available in Pennsylvania, Colorado, or California. in the RSV season, 20\u201341% of the influenza-like illness cases are attributed to RSV infection in children younger than 5 y of age (48), we used ILI data from 2010\u20132014 to evaluate RSV rates in these states. we calculated the average number of secondary cases generated per infected individual in each age group. the total number of new cases for which members of an age group had been the source of infection is divided by the total number of that age group that was infected. to model age-dependent transmission, we stratified the population into eight age groups. 0\u20135 mo, 6\u201311 mo, 1 y, 2\u20134 y, 5\u201324 y, 25\u201349 y, 50\u201364 y, and 65 y. we assumed individuals were born with temporary protection conferred by maternal antibodies. we parameterized transmissibility from daily estimates of infectious viral load. we combined the daily viral load data with daily probabilities of withdrawal from daily social interaction for children (25) and symptomatic adults based on surveys of individuals infected with RSV in the united states. we parameterized vaccination uptake from state-specific monthly influenza vaccine coverage data for different age groups. the latter is likely to elicit only a systemic response and not a mucosal response. however, if infected, viral load was unaffected. no prospective studies estimating rates of RSV in children are available in Pennsylvania, Colorado, or California. in the RSV season, 20\u201341% of the influenza-like illness (ILI) cases are attributed to RSV infection in children younger than 5 y of age (48) we calculated the average number of secondary cases generated per infected individual in each age group. the total number of new cases for which members of an age group had been the source of infection divided by the total number of that age group that was infected. the probability of infection from a host within an age group was calculated as a function of three data-driven factors. nas.1522597113.sapp.pdf (4MB, pdf)."}
