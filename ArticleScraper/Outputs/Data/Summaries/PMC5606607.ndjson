{"summary": "new Zealand health authorities reported 19.7 cases per 100,000 between 2004 and 2011. the national reported incidence in 2012 was 31.1 per 100,000. infected calves shed as much as 3.89 1010 oocysts during a 6-day period of infection. the pathophysiological mechanism causing the diarrhoea is unclear. the two most commonly identified species affecting humans are C. parvum and C. hominis. the latter infects all mammals and is endemic in calves. veterinary science and veterinary technology students were advised of effective hygiene procedures to minimise the risk of cryptosporidiosis. a clinically-confirmed case was defined as a clinically-confirmed case that tested positive for Cryptosporidium. the questionnaire was distributed to the second and third year Bachelor of Veterinary Technology students. paper copies of the questionnaire were distributed directly to the students via their on-campus letterboxes on 7 October and a locked return box was provided on campus. an email reminder was sent a fortnight after the original distribution to remind all students to complete and return the questionnaire. the DNA was isolated for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Gp60 primers. the amplified PCR products were then sent for sequencing at the massey Genome Service. the resulting sequence was edited and aligned using the software program Geneious (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand) variables were retained if significant at p 0.05 or if their presence in the model changed a regression coefficient by more than 15%, thereby indicating confounding. the presence of interactions between age, ethnicity, and other independent variables were investigated after selecting variables for entry into the multivariable model. the final year (fifth) Bachelor of Veterinary Science students (BVSc; n = 100) the questionnaire was in five parts: (1) information about the respondent and the onset of disease; (2) the symptoms experienced, if any; (3) assessment of the risk of exposure via anthroponotic transmission. paper copies of the questionnaire were distributed directly to the students via their on-campus letterboxes on 7 October and a locked return box was provided on campus. one of the human faecal samples had genomic DNA extracted and genotyped at the Protozoal Research Unit, Molecular Epidemiology and Public Health Laboratory, at Massey University. the faecal specimen was placed in the commercial NucleoSpin Soil kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH & co. KG, D\u00fcren, Germany) age was categorised as 17\u201321, 22\u201324, 25+ years, and unknown. ethnicity of the students was categorised as European, Asian, and other. data were used to describe the natural history of the disease. the attack rate was 19/81, 23% (95% CI 16%\u201334%). Symptoms experienced by the 19 cases included diarrhoea, vomiting, and nausea. the prevalence of the symptoms is enumerated in Table 1. the average number of weeks in which the students were exposed to animals with diarrhoea over the 11-week period was 1.1 (median 1; range 0\u20134) students reported exposure to animals with diarrhoea within each weekly roster during cryptosporidiosis in 2013. 31 calves with diarrhoea were admitted to the large animal hospital. there were also calves with other health problems, sheep, alpacas, and a pig. an aetiological diagnosis was not reached for all of the calves with diarrhoea. students with one week of contact with calves with diarrhoea had approximately 10 times the odds of becoming a case of cryptosporidiosis. there was a dose response, with students with two weeks of contact with calves with diarrhoea having approximately 55 times the odds of becoming a case of cryptosporidiosis. seven of thirty-one calves were confirmed to be shedding Cryptosporidium. ten case students did not have contact with other animals with diarrhoea. one had contact with calves with diarrhoea at another location. seven faecal samples were positive for Cryptosporidium and the other faecal sample was negative for Campylobacter. one faecal specimen was subtyped as Cryptosporidium parvum belonging to the allelic group IIa A18G3R1. the only variable remaining significant at p 0.05 was exposure to calves with diarrhoea. students with one week of contact with calves with diarrhoea had approximately 10 times the odds of becoming a case of cryptosporidiosis. none of the tested interactions were significant. students handled 31 calves with diarrhoea in the large animal hospital at massey university during the study period. seven of thirty-one calves were confirmed to be shedding Cryptosporidium. seven of the students were confirmed as suffering from cryptosporidiosis. the subtype from the one human isolate that was genotyped, C. parvum subtype IIa A18G3R1, is the most common subtype in calves [20,21] veterinary students at massey university have been diagnosed with cryptosporidiosis in previous years. it is almost an annual occurrence during the calving season, despite ever-increasing hygiene measures and student education about zoonoses. the attitude of veterinary students towards zoonotic infections is changing. the provision of keyboard covers in student computer laboratories has also been considered as a means of limiting transmission. but most effort has gone into preventing the movement of infectious material from the large animal hospital. this approach must be balanced with the value of clinical experience in producing practice-ready new graduates. study questionnaire only asked the respondents to list the animals with diarrhoea they had been in contact with and not the animals that appeared clinically normal. this is a limitation because it does not take into account the possibility of infection acquired from asymptomatic animals."}
