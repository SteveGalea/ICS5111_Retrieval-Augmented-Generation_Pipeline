{"summary": "programs targeted to detect atypical animal diseases follow 2 approaches. syndromic surveillance monitors disease trends by grouping clinical diseases into syndromes on the basis of clinical features rather than specific diagnoses. atypical cases can arise from a new disease that shows clinical signs the clinician cannot link to a known disease. france, 1994 Unusual death rates and clinical signs for the region: abortion, nervous signs, hydrocephalus (11) Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (prion) Cattle Great Britain, 1980 Unusual clinical and pathologic signs in the species: progressive neurologic disorders, gray matter vacuolation and scrapie associated fibrils. 3 prototype information systems are being tested in cattle because veterinary practitioners have high rates of on-farm contact with bovine herds. veterinary practitioners have high rates of on-farm contact with bovine herds. 7 veterinarians in new Zealand, 2004\u20132005 1) 17 veterinarians in Kansas, 2003\u20132006; 2) 10 veterinarians in new Mexico, 2005\u20132006 1) 12 veterinarians in France, 2003; 2) 30 veterinarians in 2 French counties, 2005\u20132007 Record Type of clinical data Syndromic surveillance: all clinical cases. vetPAD has a syndromic surveillance approach. it can include all farm animals and collects data describing every case. cases can be flexibly aggregated for syndromic surveillance. the system has generic features, making it available for any country, any disease, and any domestic species. atypical cases for \"\u00e9mergences\" are a less frequent and more open process than the syndromic surveillance methods. \"\u00e9mergences\" primarily uses the Internet. incidence threshold analysis needed for this situation requires methods such as the evaluation of record process (28). the second situation is the emergence of clusters of highly pathogenic variants of an endemic disease. the RSVP-A system requests additional clinical observations potentially useful to further characterize the diseased animals. \"\u00e9mergences\" has a different approach as it targets atypical cases and specific diseases. the system requests a follow-up description of each case's evolution and monthly confirmations of vigilance from veterinarians reporting no cases. atypical cases can be categorized according to clinical description similarities. two types of situations can be considered. the first is the emergence from a \"zero case\" situation. the second is the emergence of clusters of highly pathogenic variants of an endemic disease. a clinical reporting tool alone is only the first step to determine if the cases share an etiologic pathway. similarities between distinct submitted atypical cases provide additional evidence. the likelihood of detecting an emerging event is high. surveillance for the unknown requires a mindset different from surveillance of the known. a substantial limitation of syndromic surveillance is the need to establish baseline levels for defined syndromes. a clinical reporting tool alone is only the first step to determine if the cases share an etiologic pathway. istent, ultimately fatal paraplegia, without general clinical signs. weight loss, depilation at the extremities leading to death. congenital cataract neither linked to bovine virus diarrhea nor familial history. testing sampled healthy animals for a set of diseases is the most feasible way to monitor wildlife health. but few disease surveillance programs not targeted at specific diseases are in place. new forms dedicated to wildlife with appropriate location could be added to information systems. institute agreed to cooperate in the event an animal issue with potential public health implications was identified. the most relevant challenge is to promote joint human-animal projects."}
