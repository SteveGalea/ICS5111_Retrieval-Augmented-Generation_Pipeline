{"summary": "bronchiolitis is a major cause of morbidity in infants. widespread use of molecular-based methods has yielded new insights. but the impact of viral etiologies on early outcomes is still unclear. syncytial virus (RSV) is the major etiological agent responsible for bronchiolitis. it is identified in 70% of bronchiolitis cases during the fall and winter. controversy exists over whether the presence of these viruses increases the severity of RSV. patients with previous wheezing episodes or previous use of beta-agonists were excluded. a structured questionnaire was given to parents or caregivers to obtain information regarding atopy in the family (i.e., asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis), day care attendance, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke or pets. the beta-actin gene was amplified from cDNA for all samples14. detection of adenovirus,15 human bocavirus,16 human coronavirus,17 and human metapneumovirus18 was performed by conventional PCR or RT-PCR. logistic regression models were used to identify clinical and virological variables associated with the main endpoints (hospital admission and admission to the ICU) only variables with p0.25 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate model. admission to the intensive care unit was determined by clinical criteria. only variables with p0.25 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate model. n % Male sex 50 64.9% Atopy in first-degree relative none 20 25.97% 1 relative 36 46.75% > 1 relative 20 25.97% No siblings 24 31.16% Prematurity 12 15.50% Presence of cardiopathy 3 3.90% Day care attendance 13 16.88% Atopic dermatitis 9 11.68% Gastroesophageal reflux 11 14.29% Pets (dog or cat) 14 18.18% On admission, most patients had bronchio single infection Coinfection Total % Respiratory syncytial virus 26 23 49 63.6% Rhinovirus 5 21 26 33.8% Enterovirus 1 15 16 20.8% Human Metapneumovirus 1 8 9 11.7% Parainfluenza 3 0 6 6 7.8% Influenza A 1 1 2 2.6% Human Coronavirus 0 2 2 2.6% Parainfluenza 1 0 1 1 1.3% Adenovirus 0 0 0 0.0% Negative samples - p OR 95% CI p Age 0.935 [0.840 - 1.039] 0.212 0.838 [0.718 - 0.979] 0.026 Male gender 0.522 [0.202 - 1.351] 0.180 0.493 [0.149 - 1.624] 0.245 Prematurity 2.240 [0.641 - 7.832] 0.207 5.507 [0.896 - 33.853] 0.066 No siblings 1.249 [0.471 - coinfections did not result in an increase in hospital admissions. a high rate of hospital admission was found (40%), and younger age and the presence of enterovirus were associated with an increased risk of admission. previous studies have reported lower frequencies of coinfections. a comprehensive analysis of the impact of each virus identified in coinfections was not feasible. however, we observed that the detection of RSV in either a single-virus infection or a coinfection did not differ between hospital and ICU admissions. a significant reduction in expiratory flow is present in prematurely born children. however, prematurity risk is most likely overestimated due to the small number of infants admitted to the ICU during the course of our study."}
