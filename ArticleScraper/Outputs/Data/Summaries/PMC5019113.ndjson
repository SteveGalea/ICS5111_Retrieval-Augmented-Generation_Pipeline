{"summary": "glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) has been used extensively in the study of astrocytes. increased GFAP expression has been associated with astrocyte reactivity in CNS lesions. the degree of GFAP immunoreactivity appears to reflect the level of reactive astrogliosis. this was reviewed in detail by sofroniew and Vinters (2010). it has been suggested mild astrogliosis is associated with astrocyte \u201cactivation\u201d and severe astrogliosis is associated with \u201creactivity\u201d. astrocytes cultured on PLL-coated glass coverslips express the reactivity markers GFAP (green) and nestin (red). astrocytes promote myelination through their supportive roles on neuron survival and maintenance of neuronal activity. many molecules can trigger or even regulate astrogliosis, including large polypeptide growth factors and cytokines. this includes mediators of innate immunity such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and other toll-like receptor ligands. here we will highlight their roles on astrocyte activation and reactivity. the delay of astrocyte activation in mice lacking IL-1, as well as in mice lacking IL-1 type 1 receptor suggests microglial activation is necessary for astrocyte activation. ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF; a member of the IL-6 family of cytokines)treated astrocytes in vitro had a phenotype that was more supportive of CNS repair. cytokine-activated astrocytes can promote neurogenesis, possibly by stimulating the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) residing in the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus in adult animals. these multipotent NSCs can migrate beyond their sites of origin and can later differentiate into oligodendrocytes, neurons and microglia. astrocyte damage in vitro, suppress remyelination, delay disease recovery in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and suppress myelination in embryonic rat mixed spinal cord cultures. activated astrocytes can also protect CNS tissue by preventing immune cells from invading and exerting a pro-inflammatory response. CNTF seems to be an important cytokine involved in astrocyte reactivity and myelination. IL-1 can also stimulate the production of another IL-6 family cytokine, LIF. positive effects of LIF on survival and differentiation of oligodendrocytes also provides evidence for the positive roles of LIF on myelination. feron-gamma (IFN-) have also been shown to potentiate reactive astrogliosis. astrocytes can also have a more detrimental effect on CNS repair via the secretion of chemokines/cytokines when in a more severe, reactive state. in situ hybridisation for TNF- mRNA has been detected in GFAP-positive astrocytes in mice suffering from pneumococcal meningitis. remyelination failure in the CNS lesions could be because TNF- prevents in situ differentiation of oligodendrocytes. reactive astrocytes associated with increased TNF- levels in MS plaques are predominantly stimulatory or inhibitory to remyelination. similar to TNF-, IFN- has been shown to suppress remyelination and delay disease recovery in transgenic mice. blocking or lowering IFN- signalling in astrocytes with a carefully planned strategy might provide new disease-modifying treatments that will limit demyelination. astrocytes also secrete C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10, Ransohoff et al., 1993) the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by reactive astrocytes is not restricted to reactive astrocytes. the up regulation of such cytokines by reactive astrocytes can also be protective for CNS injury. this review will focus on cytokines and chemokines. oligodendrocyte lineage cells, microglia, pericytes and endothelial cells can be activated directly or indirectly. microglia release the cytokine interleukin 1 (IL-1, Herx et al., 2000), which is an early injury signal. the delay of astrocyte activation in mice lacking IL-1 suggests that microglial activation is necessary for astrocyte activation. cultured spinal cord astrocytes support the survival of a significantly greater number of ventral spinal motor neurons. cytokine-activated astrocytes can promote neurogenesis, possibly by stimulating the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) residing in the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus in adult animals. astrocytes that tend to have a more severe phenotype may secrete cytokines and chemokines that lead to myelin and oligodendrocyte damage in vitro. these reactive scar forming astrocytes can also protect CNS tissue by preventing immune cells from invading and exerting a pro-inflammatory response. increase in IL-1 levels at early stages of CNS pathology stimulates the induction of CNTF mRNA and protein in astrocytes. this could be due to FGF-2 signalling as CNTF treatment elevates astrocytic levels of Fgf-2 mRNA significantly, whereas, IL-1 shows no effect. CNTF seems to be an important cytokine involved in astrocyte reactivity and myelination. positive effects of LIF on the survival and maturation of oligodendrocytes also provides evidence for the positive roles of LIF on myelination. other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) and interferon-gamma (IFN-) have also been shown to potentiate reactive astrogliosis. astrocytes appear as the major or minor TNF-expressing cell types in MS lesions. astrocytes internalize the protein in a receptor-mediated manner. it is possible that astrocytes require a longer period of time to become reactive upon injury. astrocytes may have a positive role on remyelination both by producing TNF- and by secreting PDGF upon stimulation with TNF-. reactive astrocytes associated with increased TNF- levels in CNS lesions are predominantly stimulatory or inhibitory to remyelination. expression in astrocytes three days before immunization suppressed EAE and demyelination by inhibiting inflammatory cell infiltration. these animals presented lower mean clinical scores even when the receptor silencing was initiated after disease onset or at disease peak. however, blocking or lowering IFN- signalling in astrocytes with a carefully planned strategy might provide new disease-modifying treatments that will limit demyelination. astrocytes treated with CXCL10 and its neutralizing antibody were upregulated in an astrocyte phenotype that was inhibitory to CNS myelination in vitro. cytokines stand out as an important family of molecules to activate astrocytes and initiate different forms of astrocyte reactivity that could be either beneficial or inhibitory for the CNS milieu. astrocytes under low glucose concentrations can degrade stored glycogen into lactate. the lactate derived from astroglial glycogen via glycolysis is transferred directly to the axon at the node of Ranvier. the importance of lactate during demyelination is only emerging. the BBB prevents the transport of either hepatic or dietary cholesterol. astrocytes and oligodendrocytes produce cholesterol to maintain myelin sheath formation. astrocytes also emerge as important cholesterol-suppliers in the CNS. neurotransmitter released from the neuronal synapse can reach adjacent astrocytes, stimulating increases in intracellular Ca2 + concentrations. these regulatory molecules then can feedback to presynaptic nerve terminals to modulate synaptic neurotransmission. microglia secrete immune factors that play an important role in synaptic connections. astrocytes secrete molecules such as thrombospondins that might be required for the formation, function and pruning of developing synapses. astrocytes may also contribute to synaptic transmission by supporting maintenance of the synaptic interstitial fluid by regulating ion, pH and transmitter homeostasis. studies using connexin knockout animals allude to the importance of connexins in promoting communication between astrocytes and between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes on myelin integrity. astroglial connexins decrease neuronal excitability by removing extracellular potassium and glutamate; while also providing metabolic supply to neurons. x32 were reduced within and around lesions during early stages of inflammatory demyelination in EAE mice. these mice also presented decreased expression of Cx43, the major astrocytic partner of Cx47, when spinal cord sections were analysed immunohistochemically. astrocytes play important roles in oligodendrocyte precursor cell survival, proliferation and maturation. astrocytes are important providers of secreted growth factors, for both neuronal and glial proliferation and survival. CNTF is constitutively expressed by white matter astrocytes, and is a key player in OPC survival and maturation in vitro and in vivo. astrocytes have also been shown to exhibit a crucial role in OPC remyelination via their iron exporter ferroportin (Fpn) in mice, where focal demyelination was induced by the injection of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) into their spinal cords. this could either be due to direct effects on OPCs through limited iron supply or indirect effects via iron-deficient microglia. astrocytes can present different mRNA expression profiles depending on the insult despite the presence of reactive gliosis in both types of CNS damage. however, changes in the astrocyte after injury are highly heterogeneous, and that changes in astrocyte activity may depend on the injury type. astrocyte reactivity can be induced by the milieu of cytokines present after injury, which can be beneficial or inhibitory in re/myelination depending on the context and severity of the injury. there are currently no clear guidelines which allow different astrocytic reactivity phenotypes to be classified."}
