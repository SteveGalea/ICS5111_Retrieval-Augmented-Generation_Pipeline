{"summary": "nasopharyngeal wash was superior to nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs at detecting respiratory syncytial virus by indirect fluorescent antibody test. nasopharyngeal wash was superior to oropharyngeal swabs at detecting respiratory syncytial virus by rapid enzyme immunoassay (16) multiplex NAT respiratory pathogen test performed on bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. results of tests for bacterial pathogens using this assay were not evaluated in this study. a patient had multiple bronchoscopies during an admission in which contemporaneous BAL and bronchial wash specimens were obtained. a volume of 50- to 60-ml aliquots of normal saline is instilled during bronchoscopy for BAL procedure. this can be repeated subsequently 2 to 3 times, with the total volume of instilled fluid not exceeding 150 to 180 ml. data were analyzed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) data were analyzed using the hospital medical informatics database for microbiological and clinical data. a pair of BAL and bronchial wash specimens collected within 4 h of each other was considered a single observation for this study. a pair of BAL and bronchial wash specimens collected within 4 h of each other was considered a distinct observation for this study. each pair of BAL and bronchial wash specimens was considered a distinct observation. data were analyzed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) the final study cohort included 184 paired BAL and bronchial wash tests from 170 patients. the median age of the patients was 58 years, 62% were male, and about 71% were white. 2% had acute bronchitis, and 1.6% had a history of lung transplant. a total of 40 of 184 bronchoscopy procedures resulted in a positive test result by BAL or bronchial wash specimen (median age, 58; 57.5% male; 77.5% white; 45% of these tests were performed within an ICU) the most common respiratory pathogens recovered from either specimen type were rhinovirus/enterovirus (20 of 40 patients [50 study cohort included 184 paired BAL and bronchial wash tests from 170 unique patients. each pair of BAL and bronchial wash tests collected within 4 h of each other was considered a single observation for this study. bronchial wash testing identified four additional positive specimens. bronchial wash testing had a significantly higher positive percent agreement of 95.0% (95% CI, 87.1 to 95.0%) versus 85.0% for BAL testing (95% CI, 76.3 to 85.0%). the bronchial wash specimen test was negative, whereas the BAL specimen test was positive (1 influenza A and 1 adenovirus) in the remaining two specimens, bronchial wash testing detected two pathogens (parainfluenza and rhinovirus/enterovirus for 1 specimen and coronavirus and rhinovirus/enterovirus for the other specimen) bronchoalveolar lavage testing identified only one organism. patients who had BAL and bronchial wash testing >4 h apart were excluded. median age of the patients was 58 years, 62% were male, 71% were white. 184 patients with contemporaneous, paired lower respiratory tract specimens tested by multiplex nucleic acid test, by result for viral pathogena Demographic characteristicb All tests (N = 184) Age in yrs (median, IQR) 58 (44\u201365) 58 (44\u201366) 58 (44\u201366) 58 (44\u201366) 0.692 Female gender 70 (38.0) 17 (42.5) 53 (36.8) 0.512 Race White 130 (70.7) 31 (7 study cohort included 184 paired BAL and bronchial wash tests from 170 unique patients. each pair of BAL and bronchial wash tests collected within 4 h of each other was considered a single observation for this study. positive % agreement (95% CI) Negative (N = 40) Negative (N = 144) Bronchial wash 98.9 (95.5\u201398.9) 95.0 (87.1\u201395.0) 100 (97.8\u2013100) Positive (n [%]) 38 (20.6) 0 (0.0) Negative (n [%]) 2 (1.1) 144 (78.3) BAL 96.7 (93.0\u201396.7) 85.0 (76.3\u201385.0) 100 (97.6 al NATb None flu A RSV Adenovirus Coronavirus Metapneumovirus Parainfluenza Rhinovirus/enterovirus Total (bronchial wash) None 144 1c 0 1c 0 0 0 0 0 146 Flu A 1c 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 RSV 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 4 Coronavirus 0 0 0 4 0 0 the diagnostic yield of performing multiplex NAT on multiple versus a single lower respiratory tract specimen is not well studied. we identified 95% concordance between multiplex NAT by bronchial wash specimen and by BAL specimen for respiratory pathogens. bronchoalveolar lavage is associated with potential risks. we assumed BAL and bronchial wash specimens with collection times documented within 4 h of each other to represent specimens collected from a single procedure. however, the majority of these specimens (82%; n = 150) had identical collection times, and 92% (n = 169) had collection times within 30 min. of the remaining 15 paired tests, 10 had collection times within 30 min to 2 h of each other, and 5 specimens had recorded collection times greater than 2 h apart. characteristics of bronchial wash specimens were comparable to those of BAL specimens. the first-aliquot \"bronchial washing\" specimen can be considered for viral PCR testing."}
