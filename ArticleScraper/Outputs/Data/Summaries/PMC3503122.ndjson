{"summary": "the 2009 pandemic influenza A virus H1N1 (2009 pH1N1) has resulted in hundreds of thousands of confirmed cases in over 200 countries worldwide. despite its rapid global spread, 2009 pH1N1 is characterized by relatively mild clinical outcomes in the vast majority of individuals, especially the elderly (>60 years old) s specific for influenza A viruses mostly target internal, nonglycosylated proteins, such as NP, M1, PA, and PB1, which are markedly conserved among different strains compared to hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) a growing number of epitopes that can be presented by more than one HLA allele are being reported (11, 70, 74) there is also evidence that an epitope can be promiscuously recognized by more than three supertype alleles in Epstein-Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. the promiscuous individual epitopes in the influenza virus-derived peptide pool were defined and characterized through a series of functional and structural assays. our findings increase the understanding of HLA restriction of CTL responses and pave the way for influenza virus vaccine development. HA, NA, M1, M2, NP, PB1, PB2, PA, NS1 and NS2 were chosen for the prediction of potential CD8+ T cell-specific epitope peptides with an HLA-A*2402 binding motif. the predicted peptides were mixed at a final concentration of 2 g/ml for each peptide and served as the HLA-A*2402 peptide pool. 150.00 1.23 P2 M1 27 VFAGKNTDL ------ 20.00 1.62 P4g M1 104 TFHGAKEVSL ----\u2013I-A- 20.00 1.79 P5 M1 114 SYSTGALASCM --A------- 37.50 4.66 P7 M1 40 EWLKTRPIL ------ 6.00 0.51 P8 NA 65 TYVNISNTNF --\u2013N--V 150.00 Nonef P9 NA 315 G a 2009 pH1N1 represents the sequence of the A/Brisbane/59/2007(H1N1) strain. the dashes represent residues that are identical to those in a/California/04/2009(H1N1) strain. d FI, mean FITC fluorescence of the given peptide/mean FITC fluorescence without peptide. the ratios of living cells are too low to calculate the FI for the peptides P8, P16, and P17. thiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated F(ab\u2032)2 fragment of anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Dako) the cells were then analyzed using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) the cells were then analyzed using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) 2.5 105 freshly isolated PBMCs from donors in 100 l RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS were seeded in each well. to stimulate the effector cells, individual peptides or peptide pools diluted in 100 l RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS were added to each well. the cells were subsequently fixed and permeabilized in permeabilizing buffer (BD Bioscience) all the fluorescent lymphocytes were gated on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Bioscence) refolding of peptides with HLA heavy chain and 2m were overexpressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies. single HLA-A*2402\u2013P21 complex crystals appeared in 0.2 M sodium nitrate and 20% (wt/vol) polyethylene glycol 3,350 within 6 days. crystals of both peptides P27 and P28 complexed to HLA-A*2402 appeared in 0.1 M Bis-Tris (pH 5.5) and 10% (wt/vol) polyethylene glycol 3,350. two cohorts of subjects were recruited for the research. the 19 subjects from Beijing consisted of 12 males and 7 females. the 77-subject cohort included 23 females and 54 males. none of the subjects had symptoms of influenza virus infection. sequences of antigens were based on the H1N1 A/California/04/2009 strain. a computer-based program was applied to predict 9-mer and 10-mer peptides. the predicted peptides were mixed at a final concentration of 2 g/ml for each peptide. 00 1.79 P5 M1 114 SYSTGALASCM --A----- 3.55 P6 M1 235 AYQKRMGVQM -------- 37.50 4.66 P7 M1 40 EWLKTRPIL ------ 6.00 0.51 P8 NA 65 TYVNISNTNF --\u2013N--V 150.00 Nonef P9 NA 315 GYICSGIF ----V-e 1.58 P10 NP 96 IYRRVDGKW a 2009 pH1N1 represents the sequence of the A/Brisbane/59/2007(H1N1) strain. the dashes represent residues that are identical to those in a/California/04/2009(H1N1) strain. f The ratios of living cells are too low to calculate the FI for the peptides P8, P16, and P17. negative control was the HLA-A*2402-restricted peptide Beta309 (RYLTVAAVFR) (67) fluorescence index (FI = mean FITC fluorescence of the given peptide/mean FITC fluorescence without the peptide] of >1.5 were regarded as high-affinity candidate peptides. freshly isolated PBMCs in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) were incubated with the peptide pool at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 at a density of 2 106 cells/ml in 2.5 104 cells were added to each well to stimulate the effector cells. individual peptides or peptide pools diluted in 100 l RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS were added to each well and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 18 h. phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was added as a positive control for nonspecific stimulation. lymphocytes were gated on a flow cytometer (BD Bioscence) refolded in vitro in the presence of a high concentration of peptide. dissolved HLA heavy chain and 2m inclusion body and peptides were diluted at a molar ratio of 1:1:3 respectively. peptides P27 and P28 complexed to HLA-A*2402 grew in 0.1 M Bis-Tris (pH 5.5) and 10% (wt/vol) polyethylene glycol 3,350. for cryoprotection, crystals were transferred to reservoir solutions containing 20% glycerol. peptide pool-specific CTL responses among HLA-A24+ donors. highest response was detected in donor a-8 (551 SFCs/106 PBMCs) highest response was detected in donor a-8 (551 SFCs/106 PBMCs) nineteen subjects from china tested for T cell responses against the HLA-A24-restricted 2009 pH1N1 peptide pool. subjects were divided into three groups according to their HLA alleles. A24/A11 indicates HLA-24- and HLA-11-double-negative donors. the peptide pool-specific T cells among all the HLA-A11 donors were much more numerous than those among the HLA-A24 and HLA-11 donors (16 15 SFCs/106 PBMCs) the peptide pool-specific T cells were much more numerous than those among the HLA-A24 and HLA-11 donors (P 0.01) peptide-specific induction of IFN- was detected by ELISPOT assays. the results showed distinct levels of IFN- production were detected in cell lines from different HLA-A24+ donors. the variability of the response levels under simulation by the peptides may reflect the different proliferation rates of epitope-specific T cells in different individuals. four peptides, P6, P21, P27, and P28, are highly conserved among all influenza A virus subtypes known to infect humans. conservation of these six peptides may indicate potential significance in influenza virus-specific T cell immunity evaluation and vaccine development for the HLA-A24+ population. dashes represent residues that are identical to those in A/California/04/2009 H1N1 influenza A virus. residues in other strains that differ from those in A/California/04/2009(H1N1) are shown. individual peptide-specific CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood were also analyzed by utilizing freshly isolated PBMCs from HLA-A24+ donors. different levels of specific CD8+ T cell responses against the six peptides (P4, P6, P14, P21, and P28) could be detected in the HLA-A24+ individuals. cross-responses against the six antigenic peptides were tested in a-5 and a-13. positive responses of the peptides are marked with stars. PBMCs were cultured in the presence of the peptide pool for 9 days. e P21 and P6 may be the major elements in the HLA-A24 peptide pool that trigger cross-responses among the HLA-A11+ donors. this may indicate a subdominant role of the cross-reactive peptides. cross-reactivity does not occur among all the identified peptides, including the immunodominant epitopes P27 and P28. six newly identified antigenic peptides were tested for binding to HLA-A*2402. the refolding results were analyzed by liquid chromatography on a superdex 200 10/300 GL gel filtration column. the predicted molecular mass of the correctly refolded proteins is 45 kDa. the side chains of residues Ser4, Pro5, Leu7, and Glu8 protrud into the solvent. the long side chain of Gln6 of peptide P21 points into the peptide binding groove of HLA-A*2402 which acts as a secondary anchor. c R = hkl Fobs k Fcal /hkl Fobs, where Rfree is calculated for a randomly chosen 5% of reflections. c R = hkl Fobs k Fcal /hkl Fobs, where Rfree is calculated for a randomly chosen 5% of reflections. the structure of the two closely related peptides P27 and P28 complexed to HLA-A*2402 demonstrated that the middle region of P27 may adopt a flexible conformation. the well-defined electron densities of peptide P28 complexed to HLA-A*2402 clearly show that the peptide assumes a flat conformation. cross-recognized peptides P6 and P21 showed some mild capability to bind to HLA-A*1101 in the refolding assay. the peptide binding groove of HLA-A*1101 accommodates the P21 peptide comfortably (Fig. 7B) P21 was tested for its binding to HLA-A*1101 through a refolding assay using liquid chromatography on a superdex 200 10/300 GL gel filtration column. a structural model of P21 loaded in the peptide binding groove of HLA-A*1101 was generated. healthy subjects from china were therefore recruited during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic to analyze their immune responses against the influenza virus peptide pool. the subjects were assigned to four major groups: A24/A3st (A24 negative and A3 supertype allele negative), A24+/A3st, A24+/A3st+, and A24/A3st+. a cutoff of 20 SFCs per 106 PBMCs is shown as a gray line at the bottom. the spots under the line were considered negative responses. the top and bottom of each rectangular box indicate the SE. donors were much higher than that in A24/A3st subjects (average, 8 SFCs/106 PBMCs; P 0.05 or 0.01) this is strong evidence that influenza virus-specific cross-responses occur in the context of all A3 supertype alleles, including HLA-A11+. A3 supertype alleles indicated similar conformations of P21 with HLA-A*1101- and HLA-A*6801-presented peptides. selection of potential HLA-A24-restricted epitope peptides from 2009 pH1N1 virus and establishment of an HLA-A24 peptide pool. peptide pool could be recognized in six out of eight HLA-A11+ donors. the highest response was detected in donor a-8 (551 SFCs/106 PBMCs) the highest response was detected in donor a-8 (551 SFCs/106 PBMCs) nineteen subjects from china were tested for T cell responses against the HLA-A24-restricted 2009 pH1N1 peptide pool. the peptide pool-specific T cells among all the HLA-A11 donors were much more numerous than those among the HLA-A24 and HLA-11 donors (16 15 SFCs/106 PBMCs) the peptide pool-specific T cells were much more numerous than those among the HLA-A24 and HLA-11 donors. PBMCs collected from HLA-A24+ subjects were stimulated in the presence of the peptide pool and IL-2. on the 10th day, individual peptide-specific induction of IFN- was detected by ELISPOT assays. peptide P28 (RYGFVANF) was found to overlap the longer peptide P27 (FYRYGFVANF) in the peptide pool, which also has a typical HLA-A24 peptide motif. conservation of newly identified influenza virus-specific CTL epitopes.

ELISPOT assays using freshly isolated PBMCs from two donors revealed that peptide P21 could specifically stimulate IFN- production in these two donors. the subsequent ELISPOT assays demonstrated that the expanded-peptide-pool-specific T cell lines could still recognize P21. however, the cross-reactive peptides P21 and P6 induce T cell responses among only a portion of HLA-A24+ individuals. es aided in the formation of the HLA-A*2402\u2013peptide complex. the peptides enhanced cell surface HLA-A*2402 expression compared to the negative-control peptide, indicating a higher binding affinity for HLA-A*2402. the three peptides adopt the classical conformations of HLA-A*2402-restricted peptides. they use similar primary anchors (Tyr and Phe) which insert deeply into the B and F pockets of HLA-A*2402 respectively. the P21 peptide assumes a moderately bulged conformation, similar to previously observed peptide binding (47), with the side chains of residues Ser4, Pro5, Leu7, and Glu8 protru data processing and refinement statistics Parameter Valuea HLA-A*2402/P21 HLA-A*2402/P27 HLA-A*2402/P28 Data collection statistics Space group P21 C2 P1 Dimensions (a, b, c) 74.3, 67.1, 87.7 162.1, 64.9, 50.2 52.8, 66.6, 70.4 Angles (\u00b0) No. of unique reflections 33,184 40,273 88,993 Completeness (%) 99 Ii is the observed intensity and Ii is the average intensity of multiple observations of symmetry-related reflections. c R = hkl Fobs k Fcal /hkl Fobs, where Rfree is calculated for a randomly chosen 5% of reflections and Rwork is calculated for the remaining 95% of reflections. the structural analysis of the two peptide complexes with HLA-A*2402 indicated that the structures of the two peptides correlate with each other. the conformations of the solvent-exposed residues with well-defined electron densities of P27 are similar to the exposed residues of P28. the extremely flexible conformation of P27 may allow the peptide to induce a diverse TCR repertoire that covers the P28-specific TCRs. the cross-recognized cross-recognized peptide P21 was tested for its binding to HLA-A*1101 through a refolding assay using liquid chromatography on a superdex 200 10/300 GL gel filtration column. 77 healthy subjects were recruited during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. the subjects were assigned to four major groups: A24/A3st (A24 negative and A3 supertype allele negative), A24+/A3st, A24+/A3st+, and -A30+. A33+ indicates HLA-A33-positive and HLA-A24-negative donors. no A31/A30 heterozygotes were found. entire supertype revealed that responses against the peptide pool in A24/A3st+ (whole A3 supertype; average, 88 SFCs/106 PBMCs), A24+/A3st (average, 144 SFCs/106 PBMCs), and A24+/A3st+ (average, 171 SFCs/106 PBMCs) donors were much higher than that in A24/A3st subjects (average, 8 SFCs peptide binding grooves of HLA-A*0301 and HLA-A*6801 accommodate the P21 peptide well. similar conformations of P21 with different peptides presented by A3 supertype alleles indicated similar conformations of P21. peptides with highly conserved sequences were identified, including cross-recognized peptides. these results widen our understanding of influenza virus-specific cellular immunity. high cross-responses against the HLA-A24-restricted peptides derived from 2009 pH1N1 were detected in A3 supertype allele-positive donors, including HLA-A11, -A31, and -A33 donors, as well as -A30. in the 77-donor cohort of our study, 86% of the subjects could be assigned to the A24 or A3 supertype. cross-responses of influenza virus are common phenomenon in the different alleles from the A3 supertype and HLA-A24. the cross-responses of the peptides derived from influenza virus are likely a common phenomenon. refolding assay of a typical HLA-A*2402-restricted peptide resulted in a low complex yield. cross-supertype responses may occur for HLA-A11 donors in vivo. cross-reactivity occurs only in peptides P21 and P6 among the newly identified antigenic peptides. the average ratio of the influenza virus-specific T cells among A24+/A3+ double-positive individuals is higher than among A24+ individuals. the average ratio of the influenza virus-specific T cells among A24+/A3+ double-positive individuals is higher than among A24+ individuals."}
