{"summary": "influenza surveillance systems do not allow the identification of the true burden of illness caused by influenza in the community because they are restricted to consulting cases. the results of this surveillance do not allow the identification of the true burden of illness caused by influenza in the community. on 11 June 2009, the world health organization (WHO) declared a pandemic due to the novel A(H1N1)2009 influenza virus. data produced by sentinel networks could induce an over or an underestimation of the true burden of influenza. 5 years and one child 5 years randomly selected among household members. if the selected person was aged between 12 and 18 years, a parent could choose to answer for the child or allow the child to answer on the child\u2019s behalf. a predefined questionnaire with the same set of questions was used throughout the study. an additional question was implemented in January 2010 to estimate the impact of the communication campaign for pandemic influenza on handwashing habits. symptoms and duration of illness were additional explanatory variables tested for healthcare seeking behaviour. a global P value was calculated for categorical variables (Wald\u2019s test) only age, sex and variables with P 0.05 were kept in the final model. all non-residential telephone subscribers, such as offices, institutions or holiday homes, were excluded from the study. at the second stage, one person aged 5 years and one child 5 years were randomly selected among the household members by selecting the person who had the next birthday. questions related to the implementation of personal hygiene control measures were asked of cases older than 14 years. a predefined questionnaire with the same set of questions was used throughout the study. a verbal consent was obtained for the interview and all data transmitted to InVS were anonymous. explanatory variables tested were age, sex, presence of children aged 5 years and number of people in the household, size of town population, being a case of self defined influenza. vaccination against A(H1N1)2009 influenza and occupation of the head of the family were additional explanatory variables tested. 750 households (825 participants) were included and the response rate was stable throughout the entire study period. the sample was representative in terms of gender, region, town size, and age (with exception that children under five years of age were overrepresented due to the survey method). 64.8% (CI 95% 54.0 \u2013 74.3%) of the cases were not symptomatic anymore at the time of the interview. Cough (85.7%) and asthenia (82.8%) were the most frequently reported symptoms. twenty seven per cent reported concomitant gastrointestinal symptoms. 5.4 (95% CI 4.3 \u2013 6.6) million medical consultations for self-defined influenza occurred in france in 2009\u20132010. among these consultations 3.8 (95% CI 2.8 \u2013 4.9) million medical consultations were related to episodes of ILI. 88.9% (95% CI 80.0 \u2013 94.2%) of flu cases used medication. 58.7% (95% CI 47.1 - 69.5%) of the cases, 25.7% (95% CI 16.8 - 37.2%) came from the family medicine chest and 15.6% (95% CI 9.1 - 25.3%) were over-the-counter drugs. the final multivariable model included age group, sex, being vaccinated against A(H1N1)2009 influenza and size of town population. the improvement in handwashing (because of the recommendations) was significantly higher among people vaccinated against A(H1N1)2009 influenza, among women and among children (15 years) compared with adults (30\u201364 years). no 2 454 ref ref ref ref A(H1N1)2009 vaccination yes 359 1,44 1,11 - 1,87 0,006 1,40 1,07 - 1,81 0,012 no 2 875 ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref self defined flu case yes 29 0,89 0,39 - 2,02 0,785 no 3 206 ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref Presence of a child 5 years in the household yes 470 1,13 0,90 - 1,42 0,296 no 2 765 response rate Of the 15 983 households eligible for the survey, 8905 agreed to participate (response rate: 55.7%) from the 10 130 people randomly selected within these 8905 households, 10 076 people were included in the survey (99%). self-defined influenza was highest in the 5\u201314 year age group (20 548 cases/100 000, CI95% 10 166\u201330 930), lowest among people older than 64 years (7 279 cases/100 000, CI95% 2 618 \u2013 11 940) cases were significantly younger than those who did not report influenza illness (32.1 vs. 39.6 years, p10-3) gias 70.1 59.6 78.8 Dyspnea 40.7 30.6 51.6 Chest pain 36.5 26.7 47.5 Gastrointestinal 27.0 18.1 38.1 Confusion, faintness 11.1 6.1 19.2 Healthcare seeking behaviour The proportion of self-defined influenza cases that consulted a physician is estimated at 62.1% (CI95% 50.5 \u2013 72.5) only 0.4% of the cases went to a hospital emergency department (Table 2). the consultation rate was 100% among children 5 years (12/12), 66.6% (95% CI 36.0 \u2013 87.7%) among children aged 5\u201314 years, 45.7% (95% CI 21.2 \u2013 72.4%) among people aged 15\u201329 years, 62.7% (95% CI 80.0 \u2013 94.2%) among adults aged 30\u201364 and 60.0% (95% CI 26.7 \u2013 86.0%) among people older than 65 years. 88.5% (95% CI 78.3 \u2013 94.2%) of the cases reported having used a tissue, 3.6% (95% CI 1.1 \u2013 11.3%) used a handkerchief and 3.9% (95% CI 1.2 \u2013 11.9%) used both. 64.2% (95% CI 51.1 - 75.6%) of the cases washed their hands as usual. p - value Age group 0,001 >10-3 0 - 14 years 762 1,31 1,07-1,61 0,009 1,33 1,08 - 1,63 0,007 15 - 29 years 370 0,77 0,59 - 1,02 0,069 0,77 0,58 - 1,01 0,059 30 -64 years 1 550 ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref ref a population based telephone survey has been implemented to assess the burden of influenza in France. the incidence of self-defined flu was estimated at 17 924 cases/100 000 inhabitants (95% CI 10 988 \u2013 24 860) this incidence was not significantly different from the incidence estimated with a recall period of 28 days. a national prospective survey of household contacts carried out during a seasonal influenza epidemic (year 2000) the proportion of ILI cases visiting a physician was estimated at 57%, the mean number of consultations was 1.3 (0.6), and the proportion of medication obtained with a prescription was estimated at 90% [2]. the healthcare seeking behaviour for influenza observed in the context of pandemic influenza season was not significantly higher that of a \u201cclassical\u201d seasonal influenza in France. more than one third of the population reported that they washed their hands more often this season than during the previous season because of the recommendations made to prevent A(H1N1)2009 transmission. only 11% of the cases used face masks. in france, overall A(H1N1)2009 pandemic influenza vaccine uptake was low at 11.1%, although higher vaccination coverage was observed among children. women are more likely to improve handwashing to prevent transmission of respiratory disease [11,12,17].
