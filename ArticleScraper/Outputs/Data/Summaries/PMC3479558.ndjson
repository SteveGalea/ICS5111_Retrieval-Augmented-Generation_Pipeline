{"summary": "pseudoknot sequences were inserted into the pMLuc-1 plasmid between the SpeI and BamHI restriction sites. the resulting transcription template was amplified by PCR and transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase. the handles were annealed with the RNA transcript then incubated with 600-nm and 820-nm diameter polystyrene beads. beams from a single 1,064-nm laser were steered independently with acousto-optic deflectors to create two traps. motion of beads held in the traps was detected by collecting from two orthogonally polarized 830-nm laser beams aligned on the traps the light that was scattered by the beads."}
