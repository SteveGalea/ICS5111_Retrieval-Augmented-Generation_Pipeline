{"summary": "the origin of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in humans has remained unknown. a flaviviridae RNA genome that was isolated from domestic dogs with respiratory illness was found to be the virus most closely related to HCV. the discovery of CHV may shed light on the origin of HCV. TRIM5- proteins [8], tetherin (BST2) [9], and SAMHD1 [10], [11] inhibit human immunodeficiency virus propagation at various steps in its replication cycle. evolution of genes encoding these restriction factors affected the adaptation of HIV to humans in the current pandemic. a bacteriophage lambda-based genetic screen was used to characterize site-specific proteases. this genetic screen is based on the bacteriophage lambda cI-cro regulatory circuit. the viral repressor cI is specifically cleaved to initiate the switch from lysogeny to lytic infection. the NS3/4A protease construct was chemically synthesized following the nucleotide sequence reported by Kapoor et al. [3]. mutated residue generated by site-directed mutagenesis is marked in red. three assayed HCV NS3/4A proteases were isolated from three patients. the fourth HCV NS3/4A protease was amplified from the HCV subgenomic replicon I389/NS3-3. the effect of the mutated NS4 residues 25 and 29 on CHV NS3/4A protease activity was less drastic than that observed on HCV NS3/4A protease. we further tested the target specificity of the MAVS and TRIF cleavage sites by analyzing a control mutant TRIF target site. a mutant TRIF cleavage site was constructed in which the C residue at the P1 position was substituted with a Y a control mutant TRIF target site was not cleaved by wild-type NS3/4A proteases. expression of the protease was induced with IPTG for 3 h. a control mutant TRIF target site was not cleaved by wild-type NS3/4A proteases. oprevir were assayed to test their ability to inhibit NS3/4A protease. the inhibitory capability of these two macrocyclic inhibitors was assessed with the MAVS and TRIF cleavage sites. the means standard deviations (error bars) of at least three experiments. no significant inhibition was detected with an HCV NS3/4A protease mutant carrying the substitution D168V, which confers resistance to protease inhibitors. CHV NS3/4A protease could process, with comparable efficiency, the specific MAVS and TRIF cleavage sites known to be processed in vivo by HCV NS3/4A protease. the findings extend previous reports [3], [4], confirming a possible evolutionary relationship between CHV and HCV. GB virus B (GBV-B) is another hepacivirus that was phylogenetically most closely related to HCV. hepacivirus causes acute hepatitis in experimentally infected tamarins. more distantly related hepacivirus bovine viral diarrhea virus and flavivirus yellow fever virus do not antagonize MAVS. the first study to demonstrate that at least parts of the identified and sequenced CHV/NPHV RNA genomes are biologically active. only a single strain of HCV, the genotype 2a strain JFH1, has been found to grow robustly in culture, in human hepatoma cell lines. e to cleave human adaptors MAVS and TRIF only partially mimics what occurs in vivo. it has not been determined whether CHV NS3/4A protease can efficiently cleavage the MAVS and TRIF proteins equivalent of horses and canines. however, the similarity observed between HCV and CHV NS3/4A proteases in their capability to process both the human and canine adaptor proteins MAVS and TRIF. plasmid pcI.MAVScro, pcI.TRIFcro, pcI.HCVNS5A/NS5Bcro or pcI.CHVNS5A/NS5Bcro were transformed with the plasmid expressing the protease. transformed cells were grown overnight at 30\u00b0C in the presence of 0.2% maltose, 12.5 g/ml tetracycline, and 20 g/ml amp plasmid pcI.MAVScro or pcI.TRIFcro were transformed with the protease. transformed cells were grown overnight at 30\u00b0C in the presence of 0.2% maltose, 12.5 g/ml tetracycline, and 20 g/ml ampicillin. the nucleotide sequence for CHV NS3/4A protease was chemically synthesized. the construct included two restriction sites, EcoRI and XhoI. the construct was cloned into pBluescript SK\u2013 (Agilent Technologies) lified from the HCV subgenomic replicon I389/NS3-3 [26]"}
