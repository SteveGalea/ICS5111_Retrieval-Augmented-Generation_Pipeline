{"summary": "influenza is a negative-strand RNA virus that uses aquatic birds as reservoir hosts. it is classified by the surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) there are 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes, but not all combinations have been recovered from aquatic birds. type was low (4.4%), one market exhibited an unusually high prevalence (36.6%) chickens that were previously infected may have been partially protected from the pathogenicity induced by a HP H5N1-subtype virus. this could have allowed the HP H5N1-subtype virus to \u2018silently\u2019 attain a prevalence where transmission to humans was probable. samples were collected by taking oropharyngeal or cloacal swabs of birds or by collecting from feces, fecal digestors, water troughs, and standing water. each month, 300\u2013600 total samples were collected across several locations. surveillance expanded to several villages in the area of the outbreak. influenza-positive eggs were detected by testing for hemagglutination of 0.5% chicken erythrocytes according to standard procedures. real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) was selected as an alternative to virus isolation in eggs. 0.1 mL of a 110 dilution of infective egg chorioallantoic fluid in sterile PBS was intravenously injected into each of 10 six-week-old, specific pathogen-free chickens. individuals were scored on the basis of the observed morbidity (0 = normal, 1 = sick, 2 = severely sick, 3 = dead) a total of 1177 samples were tested for influenza A by virus isolation. none of the sampling sites were reported as an outbreak area during the study. sample screening samples were screened in 1 of 2 ways. hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays were performed to determine the subtype of influenza-positive samples. a total of 5715 samples from several locations in Bangladesh were tested for AIV. the results of the virus isolation and rRT-PCR detection methods on identical samples were in agreement for 86.4% of the samples. cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from the same bird. the results agreed for 77.8% (n = 239) and 78.6% (n = 714) of the hosts. swabs were more likely to test positive than cloacal swabs were regardless of detection method. village-1 Ck 0 (2) 0 (1) 0 (3) 8.3 (12) 0 (12) 8.3 (12) Village-2 Ck 0 (7) 0 (7) 0 (7) 0 (7) 0 (7) 0 (5) 0 (5) 0 (5) 0 (5) 0 (5) VIllage-5 Ck/Dk 0 (2) 0 (1) 0 (2) 0 (5) 0 (5) 0 (5) 0 (5) Total 15.6 (263) 46.9 ( the prevalence of influenza in hosts varied across the sampling sites. a significant difference in prevalence across the sites was also detected for the environmental samples (feces, fecal digestors, water, and water troughs) 44.7 (206)a,b 16.1 (697)c Market-4 Ck 0 (4) 57.1 (21)a,b 48 (25)a,b Market-5 Ck 0 (3) 0 (3) Market-6 Ck 0 (5) 0 (5) 0 (5) d,e Village-1 Ck 0 (3) 8.3 (12) 0 (3) 8.3 (12) Village-2 Ck 0 (7) 0 (7) 0 (7) 0 (7) 0 (7) 0 (7) 0 close to all of the host samples (84.3%) were collected from chickens (Phasianidae), the most abundant species at most of the sites.
