{"summary": "all reported SARS patients who stayed in the medical wards or intensive care unit were screened. patients excluded if subsequent follow-up serologic tests showed no rise in antibody titer against SARS-associated coronavirus. one healthcare worker refused to be studied, and two patients suspected of contracting the infection were also excluded. coexisting conditions are not classified as coexisting conditions. psychiatric illness, hepatitis B carrier status, and thalassemia trait status were not classified as coexisting conditions. two hundred and seven (64%) patients had reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays performed for SARS-associated coronavirus. sensitivity of RT-PCR assays was 58% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50% to 66%) ribavirin plus steroid therapy was administered 1.21.7 days after admission. interval between admission and initiation of antiviral therapy was negatively correlated with the interval between onset of fever and admission. age, sex, healthcare worker status, amoy gardens resident status, presence of coexisting conditions, interval between onset of fever and therapy, neutrophil count on admission and lactate dehydrogenase levels were the correlates of clinical outcome under study. p0.001 1.28 (1.13 to 1.46) p0.001 1.17 (1.09 to 1.26) p0.001 Initial LDH level (per 100 IU/L increase) 1.49 (1.23 to 1.82) p0.001 1.35 (1.11 to 1.64) p=0.003 p value not significant aICU, intensive care unit; OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence interval. pulsed dose steroid therapy was resumed in 98 (30%) patients. hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, flare up of hepatitis B infection, hospital-acquired infection and steroid psychosis were the acute side effects encountered. p value of 0.1 by univariate analysis were entered into the multivariate regression model. by multivariate logistic regression, advanced age, high neutrophil count on admission, and high initial lactate dehydrogenase level were favorable independent correlates of survival time. a dose-response relationship also existed between the independent correlates and clinical outcome. fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome illness, Hong Kong, 2003. the second serology titer obtained after the end of second week was negatively correlated with age (Pearson r=\u20130.13, p=0.05) the pulsed dose of steroid was not shown to affect the second serology titer. both advanced age and high neutrophil count on admission were associated with poor outcome. lactate dehydrogenase level reflects tissue necrosis related to immune hyperactivity in SARS and thus relates to poor outcome. workers in a non-SARS area were not exempted from treatment. they contracted the disease from patients who sought treatment early. they had a lower neutrophil count and lower initial lactate dehydrogenase level. the sensitivity of current RT-PCR assays is not satisfactory. the sensitivity of current RT-PCR assays is not satisfactory. the sensitivity of current RT-PCR assays is not satisfactory. healthcare workers working in a non-SARS area were not exempted. they contracted the disease from patients who sought treatment early or exhibited atypical signs and symptoms. by univariate analysis, healthcare worker status was negatively correlated with death. patients who sought treatment early tended to receive antiviral therapy at a later time. the current consensus is to begin administering a steroid or pentaglobin at the second stage of SARS. strong evidence to support early and routine use of ribavirin and steroid combination therapy does not exist. we need to investigate new antiviral agents and test the efficacy of steroids in randomized controlled trials."}
