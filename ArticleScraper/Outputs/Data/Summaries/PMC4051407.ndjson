{"summary": "Lung ultrasound may be a first-line alternative to chest X-ray or CT scan. results in two cases of severe respiratory failure from avian influenza A (H7N9). a pandemic outbreak of this virus or other similarly lethal viruses such as MERS coronavirus or influenza A (H5N1) with rapid human-to-human spread would constitute a dire public health emergency. experiences with prior respiratory virus outbreaks [3-5] have demonstrated that point-of-care lung ultrasound can assist distinguishing between various acute respiratory pathologies such as pneumonia [6], viral pneumonia [3-5,7], and acute respiratory distress syndrome [8-10] a total 7-day course of intravenous zanamivir was completed, followed by prolonged course of oral oseltamivir. a 65-year-old man with multiple medical conditions presented with fever, cough, and shortness of breath since 3 January. he was admitted to a local hospital for a course of pulmonary rehabilitation 2 weeks later. the patient traveled to shenzhen for 1 day just prior to his symptom onset. he passed by a wet market in shenzhen but denied any direct poultry contact. he developed acute cardiac arrhythmia, multiorgan failure with rapid deterioration. serial lung ultrasound (Esaote MyLabFive) with an 11- to 3-MHz linear array transducer was performed on day 16, day 21, and day 24 of case 1's hospital stay. a modified protocol scanning along the midclavicular line, anterior-axillary, and posterior-axillary lines was used in case 2 due to critical illness. pleural consolidations are echo-poor hypoechoic areas (hepatization) with air bronchograms that are depicted as hyperechoic linear elements. small subpleural consolidations that have been observed to be specific for viral infection are typically 0.25 to 0.5 cm in depth. case 1 A 36-year-old domestic worker presented to emergency department in late November of 2013 for 4-day history of fever and cough. extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (ECMO) was started. she was retrieved to a local center with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (ECMO) for further care on day 4. panel letters correspond to position letter on CXR. the patient was admitted to a local hospital in Hong Kong for chest infection 4 days later. his condition rapidly deteriorated requiring intensive care unit admission on the same day and invasive mechanical ventilation and ECMO on the subsequent day. he passed by a wet market in Shenzhen but denied any direct poultry contact. serial lung ultrasound (Esaote MyLabFive) with an 11- to 3-MHz linear array transducer was performed on day 16, day 21, and day 24 of case 1's hospital stay. a modified protocol scanning along the midclavicular line, anterior-axillary, and posterior-axillary lines was used in case 2 due to critical illness. pleural consolidations are echo-poor hypoechoic areas (hepatization) with air bronchograms that are depicted as hyperechoic linear elements. small subpleural consolidations are typically 0.25 to 0.5 cm in depth, contain no sonographic air bronchograms, associated with an interruption in the pleural line, and typically have a trailing comet tail artifact. high frequency linear transducer as small subpleural consolidations and small pleural effusions can be missed with lower frequency curvilinear probes. acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is seen as the predominant presence of confluent B lines ( at least >3 B lines per field) or white lung associated with pleural line abnormalities described as thickening (>2 mm) point-of-care lung ultrasound may lead to efficient allocation of resources such as respiratory isolation rooms, ventilatory support, and ECMO. it is unclear if different virus types manifest different patterns in viral lung ultrasonographic findings. ultrasonography avoids radiation exposure that elevates future cancer risk when using chest X-ray or CT scan. the findings are similar to ultrasound findings described with other influenza A subtypes (H1N1 and seasonal), as well as other viral pulmonary infections. authors\u2019 contributions NWT, CWN, KLM, and JWT participated in the analysis and interpretation of data.
