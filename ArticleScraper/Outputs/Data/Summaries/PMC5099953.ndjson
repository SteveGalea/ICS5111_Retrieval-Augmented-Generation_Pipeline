{"summary": "decreases of GLTSCR2 resulted in reduced production of viral particles of VSV, NDV, and IBV by 60, 120, and 20 folds. GLTSCR2 level was not significantly affected by viral infection. HEk293T cells in T-25 flask were infected with VSV at a MOI of 1 for 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 36 h. cell lysates were prepared, GLTSCR2 and VSV-G were measured by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. the region of residues 330 to 478 plays a role in GLTSCR2 interaction with other cellular proteins, such as PTEN33,34, p5335,36, and merlin37. the region of residues 342 to 386 is also responsible for homo-dimerization. expression of wt GLTSCR2 but not G3 or G4 consistently resulted in upregulation of these viral genes in 6 hours after viral infection. results suggest that GLTSCR2 played a supportive role in viral replication. translocation of GLTSCR2 to cytoplasm was induced by infection with HSV-132. cytoplasmic translocation of GLTSCR2 played an important role in supporting viral replication. heLa cells grown in 24-well plate were transfected with plasmids to express GFP-tagged GLTSCR2 (lanes 1\u20134) or NES deletion mutant (GLT, lane 5) for 24 h, then mock-infected (lane 1) or infected with VSV at a MOI of 5 for 7 h (lane 2). increased ectopically expressed GLTSCR2 resulted in decreases of IFN- promoter activity in cells infected with either Sendai virus (SeV) or VSV. GLTSCR2 may be involved in downregulation of IFN- and NF-B during viral infection of cells. HEK293T cells in 24-well plate were transfected with pGMLV-SC1 vector encoding control shRNA () or shRNA targeting GLTSCR2 (+) for 72 h, mock-infected or infected with SeV at 50 HA U/ml or VSV at a MOI of 0.1 for 12 h. values represent means of triplicates with SD. 293T or 293T sh-GLT (+) cells infected with VSV were analyzed by immunoblotting with specific antibodies to detect p-IRF3, IRF3, with actin as a control. ability of recombinant IFN- to suppress VSV replication was significantly reversed by ectopically expressed wt GLTSCR2. ectopic expression of RIG-I-N (constitutively-active RIG-I variant consisting of residues 1\u2013300), MAVS, or TBK1 was able to induce IFN- promoter activity. co-expression of GLTSCR2 blocked IFN- promoter activation by RIG-I-N but not MAVS or TBK1.

GLTSCR2 blocked the ability of RIG-I to induce IFN-. ectopically expression of GLTSCR2 failed to support viral replication. GLTSCR2 negatively regulated RIG-I via K63-linked ubiquitination. expression of RIG-I-T170R significantly increased IFN- promoter activity to a higher level than wt induced (lane 3) knockdown of GLTSCR2 failed to affect RIG-I-K172R-induced IFN- promoter activity (lane 6) HEK293T cells in T-25 flask were co-transfected with plasmids to express Flag-tagged RIG-I, T170R and K172R, along with actin as a control. cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody to Flag or IgG. tagged ubiquitin, K63-linked ubiquitin, or K48-linked ubiquitin. ectopic expression of GLTSCR2 was able to induce de-conjugation of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from the constitutively-active variant RIG-I-N. GLTSCR2 was able to downregulate RIG-I via K63-linked ubiquitination. HEK293T cells in T-25 flask were co-transfected with plasmids to express Flag-tagged GLTSCR2 (5 g) and Myc-tagged USP15 (5 g) for 36 h, then mock-infected or infected with VSV at a MOI of 0.1 for 12 h. cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody to Flag or IgG (2\u20133 g) tagged RIG-I-N and Myc-tagged USP15, along with HA-tagged ubiquitin (lanes 1, 4), K63-linked ubiquitin (lanes 2, 5), or K48-linked ubiquitin (lanes 3, 6). cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody to Flag. GLTSCR2 interacted with RIG-I and USP15 in a complex to support the activity of USP15 to remove K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I. USP21 and USP3 have also been shown to remove K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIG-I, leading to inactivation of RIG-I24,41,42. TRIM25, USP21, USP3 are not involved in GLTSCR2 regulating RIG-I ubiquitination.

GLTSCR2 level was not significantly affected by viral infection, indicating endogenous level of GLTSCR2 was sufficient to support viral replication. HEp-2 cells in T-25 flask were transfected with control plasmid (Ctrl) and plasmids to express Flag-tagged wt GLTSCR2 or truncated GLTSCR2 variants G3 and G4 (5 g each) for 36 h, followed by infection with NDV or IBV at 10 PFU per cell. ectopic expression of the full length wild-type (wt) GLTSCR2 enhanced viral replication, indexed by viral proteins VSV-G and NDV-P. expression of wt GLTSCR2 was able to increase gene expression of viral NDV-N and IBV-N. expression of wt GLTSCR2 but not G3 or G4 consistently resulted in upregulation of these viral genes in 6 hours after viral infection. cytoplasmic translocation of GLTSCR2 from nucleus to cytoplasm was induced by infection with HSV-132. it was not clear whether GLTSCR2 cytoplasmic translocation might be associated with viral replication. ectopic expression of GLTSCR2 resulted in slightly increased production of viral particles. cells grown in 24-well plate were transfected with plasmids to express GLTSCR2 (lanes 1\u20134) or NES deletion mutant (GLT, lane 5) (500 ng each) for 24 h, then mock-infected (lane 1) or infected with VSV at a MOI of 5 for 7 h (lane 2). cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. GLTSCR2 may be involved in downregulation of IFN- and NF-B during viral infection. knockdown of endogenous GLTSCR2 resulted in significant increases of IFN- and NF-B-dependent promoter activity in cells after infection with either SeV or VSV. GLTSCR2 attenuates IFN- during viral infection. HEK293T cells in 24-well plate were transfected with pGMLV-SC1 vector encoding control shRNA or shRNA targeting GLTSCR2 (+) for 72 h, mock-infected or infected with SeV at 50 HA U/ml or VSV at a MOI of 0.1 for 12 h, the supernatants from cells were harvested and analyzed for IFN- production by ELISA. ectopically expressed wt GLTSCR2 was reversed by ectopically expressed wt GLTSCR2. the results indicated that GLTSCR2 supported viral replications by not only downregulating IFN- expression but also suppressing IFN- activity. HEK293T cells in T-25 flask were transfected with plasmids to express flag-tagged GLTSCR2 or flag-tagged GLT (5 g each) for 36 h, then mock-infected or infected with VSV at a MOI of 0.1 for 12 h. cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody to Flag or IgG (2\u20133 g) HEK293T cells in T-25 flask were co-transfected with plasmids to express HA-tagged RIG-I and flag-tagged GLTSCR2. cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody to Flag or IgG. electrophoretically separated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies.
