{"summary": "twitter and media coverage on poliomyelitis help maintain global support for its eradication. poliomyelitis has become a vital tool for public health communication globally, given the penetration of the internet and mobile phones across the world. public health professionals perform communication surveillance and media monitoring to assess the communication environment in which they interact. social media can be used in communication surveillance to assess the public\u2019s sentiments regarding public health issues and reactions to major public health events. twitter data were retrieved and monitored in real time during the outbreaks. random sample of twitter data with hashtag #polio from January 1, 2014, to April 30, 2015, was purchased from Gnip Inc/Twitter, San Francisco, CA. a total of 79,333 tweets were included in the dataset. variables of interest included keywords, hashtags, tweet frequencies, and user statistics. co-hashtags, January 1, 2014, to April 30, 2015a Variable #Polio #India and #Polio #Iraq and #Polio #Nigeria and #Polio #Syria and #Polio #Iraq Total no. of tweets 79,333 5027 1238 1364 11,427 2952 Friends 329 (123\u2013880) 293 (115\u2013750.5) 372 (19\u20131015) 443 (168. an LDA model assumes that documents are \u201cbags of words\u201d and ignores the order of words in a document. the model assumes that across a corpus of documents, there exists a specified number of underlying topics that are hitherto unknown to the researcher. the largest log-likelihood and its corresponding number of topics were then chosen for that specific subcorpus. the top 20 terms for each subcorpus were extracted, as well as representative tweets. a 2 test of association was conducted to test for association between country and theme. a small number of \u201cempty tweets\u201d in each of the 5 subcorpora were removed before LDA modeling. a small number of \u201cempty tweets\u201d in each of the 5 subcorpora were removed before LDA modeling. a 2 test of association, using 2000 Monte Carlo simulations, was conducted to test for association between the English-language media article themes and the countries of interest. the study was conducted to test for association between the countries of interest and the countries of interest. standardized with content themes of a 40% random sample of #polio tweets. most of the tweets were written in English (n = 68,262; 93.58%), with the next 4 most common languages being Spanish (n = 5979, 7.54%), French (n = 1197, 1.51%), Italian (n = 100). the highest number of #polio tweets posted by 1 individual Twitter user was 1307 tweets during the study period. the median number of followers and status updates per user was 350 (Q1 = 91, Q3 = 1222) and 3792 (Q1 = 891, Q3 = 14,697), respectively. 8.9% and 11.3% of tweets included case-insensitive mentions for the world health organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) or UNICEFpoli a small number of tweets may have contained more than one of the same hashtag or mention, which explains the difference in total mentions/hashtags between Tables 2 and 5. top 10 most frequent co-occurring hashtags, keywords, and mentions for entire #polio dataset (40% random sample), January 1, 2014, to April 30, 2015a Hashtag Number Keyword Number Mention Number #endpolio 11,303 polio 80,156 @UNICEF 8682 #Pakistan 10,612 most tweets centered around India achieving a polio-free status, represented with a theme of celebrations/polio-free (n = 4115, 83.54%) most tweets were in regard to current eradication/vaccination efforts (n = 566, 46.36%) and cases/outbreaks/incidence (n = 469, 38.41%) the results show that 6 of the 8 articles about India were celebrating India\u2019s achievement of being polio free. most traditional news articles on polio in Iraq, Pakistan, and Syria were focused on violence/conflicts with polio efforts. 23 English-language media news reports occurred within a 7-day window of Twitter peaks. 7 of the 12 news articles occurring within 3 days after a Twitter peak were identified in the #Pakistan subcorpus. most of the tweets were written in English (n = 68,262; 93.58%), with the next 4 most common languages being Spanish (n = 5979, 7.54%), French (n = 1197, 1.51%), Italian (n = 1006, 1.27%), and German the top 10 co-occurring hashtags, keywords, and mentions of the #polio dataset are found in Table 5. the top 2 co-occurring hashtags (case-sensitive) were #endpolio (n = 11,303) and #Pakistan (n = 10,612), and not surprisingly, the top 3 keywords in the #polio dataset were \u201cpolio\u201d (n = 80,156), \u201cpakistan\u201d (n = 14,675), and \u201cendpolio\u201d ( #nigeria 1322 via 6572 @UNICEFmena 1002 #Karachi 1286 children 6454 @CDCGlobal 976 a Top hashtags and mentions are case sensitive. a small number of tweets may have contained more than one of the same hashtag or mention. a time trend (daily incidence) of #polio tweets with each of the country-specific co-occurring hashtags can be found in Figure 1. examples of #polio tweets for the #India, #Iraq, #Nigeria, #Pakistan, and #Syria subcorpora are found in the Supplemental Figures 1 to 5. the 2 test of association resulted in a 2 statistic of 18,683 (p 0.001). in the case of polio, one-third of traditional news articles were categorized as celebrations/polio-free. another one-third were in regard to new cases, outbreaks, or the incidence of polio. the 2 test of association resulted in a 2 statistic of 50.941 (p 0.001). 52.03% of the tweets (691/1328) were categorized as \u201cNigeria polio free soon\u201d in the subcorpora of #Iraq, #Syria, and #Pakistan. themes of the tweets with co-occurring hashtag #Syria reflected the international concern about that outbreak. polio eradication efforts rely on international donors who rely on global public support. there were themes of violence and conflict present among the tweets in the subcorpora of co-occurring hashtags #Pakistan and #Syria. the results of the generalized Mantel-Haenszel test support the idea that Twitter content differs significantly from English-language media content. polio-free and current eradication/vaccination efforts were more common in our Twitter sample than in our English-language media article sample for each country of interest. study adds to literature how themes of Twitter and English-language media coverage may differ when polio is reported in a given country of concern. effective 2-way communication is vital to harness global support to the GHSA so it can promote health. our media sample was limited to 6 different English-language sources. non-English-language local reactions to polio and eradication efforts are beyond the scope of this study. major technical support for the global Polio Eradication Initiative continues to come from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. social media could serve as a positive environment where support can be harnessed for these campaigns."}
