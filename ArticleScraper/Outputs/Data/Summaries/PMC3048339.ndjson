Statistical analysis The time to cold resolution was calculated as the number of days from study entry and summaryd as median for each treatment group. the randomization list and the drug codes were locked in sealed envelopes until the end of the follow-up period, final assessment, and statistical analysis. each patient was given a similar pack of 30 capsules and was asked to swallow one capsule twice daily for as long as he/she had cold symptoms. patients were considered adherent if they took an average of two capsules per day for the first 4 days of the study (eight capsules) and if they took no antibiotic agents. results Seventy-five patients presenting with common cold symptoms were assessed for eligibility criteria. nine of them were excluded, as they did not fulfill eligibility criteria. the remaining three of the seven censored patients were lost to follow-up, two from the Immumax group and one from the placebotreated group. the remaining three of the seven censored patients were lost to follow-up. the frequency of reported adverse effects, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, and dizziness, did not differ significantly between the two groups. this is the first study to test the effect of this multiherbal preparation with vitamin C and zinc on the duration and severity of common cold symptoms."}
