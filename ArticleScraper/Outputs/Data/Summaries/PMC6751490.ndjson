IAV was inactivated rapidly by AHR within 30 s in both dried mucus samples and dried saline. also, IAV was inactivated rapidly by AHW within 30 s under all conditions. log reduction caused by AHR or AHW sample disinfection time (s) simulations for mucus mixtures were performed with mucus viscosity reduced to 16.7 or 12.5% of the measured value. in this simulation, the central region of the mucus remained at 31% ethanol for >30 s indicating a low ECIR. all low-ethanol regions disappeared by 60 s. ethanol to 5 l mucus was modeled in openFOAM, demonstrating the disappearance over time of the region with 31% ethanol. the simulation was performed under conditions of reduced viscosity (16.7% of the actual measurement value) because of the long time required for disappearance of the concentration region of 31% ethanol.

Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation between viscosity and 10, 20 and 31% ethanol concentration achievement time. the 52 mucus samples were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) to distinguish between IAV-infected and IAV-uninfected samples. nucleic acids were extracted from the mucus samples with a PureLink RNA minikit. cDNA was prepared using a ReverTra Ace qPCR RT master mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) mucus (400 mg) was loaded onto the rheometer and left for 5 min to enable relaxation to the original gel structure. Steady-flow viscosity (in Pa s) was calculated as shear stress divided by shear rate. samples were prepared by mixing deuterium oxide at 99.9 atom% D (D2O; Isotech Laboratories, Inc., Champaign, IL, USA) and 99.5% ethanol into the mucus samples. 1H NMR spectra of the mucus-alcohol-D2O mixtures were acquired at 298 1 K. the interdiffusion coefficient (D) of the water-ethanol system was calculated from the self-diffusion coefficients of water (DH2O) and ethanol (DEtOH) changes in ethanol concentrations were measured with a digital ethanol densitometer (ATAGO, Tokyo, Japan), which was modified for this measurement. changes in the ethanol concentration in the center region (the region with the lowest ethanol concentration) of saline or mucus were measured using a digital ethanol densitometer modified for this analysis. EBD was added to saline or mucus, and the ethanol concentration was measured over time. tests for inactivation of IAV were carried out according to the following protocols. IAV was mixed with saline or mucus prior to EBD exposure. three independent experiments were performed for each measurement. IAV was mixed with saline or mucus (final viral titer, 1.0 106 FFU/ml) and applied in 5-l aliquots to washed and disinfected fingertips of test subjects. the mixture of IAV and saline or mucus on fingertips was completely dried by standing for 40 min before hand washing. interMixingFoam solved the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation and solved the conservation law of the volume fraction of each fluid (gas and two types of liquid) the volume fractions (1, 2, and 3) satisfied equation 3: 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 (3) In this analysis, the volume fraction, 1, was air, 2 was an 80% ethanol aqueous solution, and 3 was saline or mucus. surface tension (f12) between the gas 1 and the liquid 2 and the surface tension (f13) between the gas 1 and the liquid 3 can be obtained by the following equations, respectively. 1 and 2 were obtained by equation 11 and equation 12: 2 d 1 + U i 1 x i = 0 (11) 2 dt + U i 2 x i + D 2 2 x i 2 = 0 (12) where D is an interdiffusion coefficient. simulation were set to reproduce the reaction conditions of EBD and saline or mucus in the inactivation tests as much as possible. cubic meshes with sides of 0.2 mm were used for the simulation. 95 l of 80% ethanol was added at a flow rate of 250 l/s from a height of 6.0 mm above 5 l of saline or mucus. the required number of subjects was calculated to be 10. all reported P values are two sided; P values of 0.05 considered significant."}
