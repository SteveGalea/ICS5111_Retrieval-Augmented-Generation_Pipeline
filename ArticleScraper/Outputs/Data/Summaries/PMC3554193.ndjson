{"summary": "clinically relevant neurotropic arboviruses belong to several different positive- and negative-sense RNA virus families. clinically relevant arboviruses include flaviviruses (e.g., west Nile virus [WNV], St. Louis encephalitis virus [SLEV], and Japanese encephalitis virus), bunyaviruses (e.g., La Crosse virus [LACV] and California encephalitis virus) and New World alphaviruses IRF-7, type I interferons, proinflammatory cytokines, and other cellular factors contribute to an antiviral microenvironment (11) innate immune function plays a pivotal role in controlling viral infections. innate immune function and its impact on neurotropic virus pathogenesis have not been fully defined. neurons produce type I IFNs in response to infection by several neurotropic viruses. IRF-3/ mice are more susceptible to intracranial but not intravenous inoculation of herpes simplex virus. humans deficient in TLR3 are predisposed to HSV encephalitis. all mice were genotyped and bred in animal facilities of Washington University School of Medicine. the dominant negative (DN), superactive (SA) and wild-type overexpression plasmids were purchased from InvivoGen. antibodies against the HA epitope tag, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), IRF-3, MDA5 and WEEV have been previously described (24, 34, 35). virions were precipitated from precleared tissue culture supernatant by addition of polyethylene glycol and sodium chloride to 7% and 2.3% final concentrations. centrifugation at 3,500 g for 20 min, centrifuged at 40,000 g for 90 min. virion bands were collected, diluted in HBSS, pelleted at 35,000 g for 60 min, and stored at 80\u00b0C in single-use aliquots. we exposed culture supernatants or purified virions to UV light for 15 min on ice. be(2)-C/m cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 25% of the recommended amount of DNA was used, which routinely resulted in 60 to 70% transfection efficiency. primary rat cortical neurons were isolated and cultured as previously described. SEAP assays, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence microscopy were performed as previously described. immunofluorescence images were obtained with a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope and images were processed with Adobe Photoshop software. RT-PCR primer sequences Target Primer ID Sequence (5\u2032 to 3\u2032) we used metabolic incorporation of 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine to measure total protein synthesis. mice were genotyped and bred in animal facilities of Washington University School of Medicine. dominant negative (DN), superactive (SA) and wild-type overexpression plasmids pDN-IRF-3(N), pSA-IRF-3(S396D), pSA-TRIF(C) and pMDA5 and the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) promoter-reporter plasmids pISRE-SEAP and pNFB-SEAP (ISRE is interferon-stimulated antibodies against actin and the V5 epitope tag were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) all secondary antibodies for immunoblotting were purchased from PBL Biomedical Laboratories (Piscataway, NJ) virions were recovered by centrifugation at 3,500 g for 20 min, resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution. virion bands were collected, diluted in HBSS, pelleted at 35,000 g for 60 min, resuspended in HBSS, and stored at 80\u00b0C in single-use aliquots. we exposed culture supernatants or purified virions to UV light for 15 min on ice. SLEV strain TBH-23 and LACV strain LACV/human/1960 were obtained from Valery Grdzelishvili (University of North Carolina at Charlotte cell viability was determined by a 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as previously described (34) or a luminescent ATP assay (ATPlite; PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) according to manufacturer's instructions, 25% of recommended amount of DNA was used. immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence microscopy were performed as previously described (24, 33, 34), except that immunofluorescence images were obtained with a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope. for quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses we normalized threshold values to 18S rRNA levels and determined fold increases using threshold cycle (CT) calculations. control and WEEV-infected cells were incubated with 50 Ci per ml PRO-MIX 35S-cell labeling mix (Amersham) for 30 min, washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 100 g cycloheximide per ml. gels were fixed in a solution containing 25% methanol and 7% acetic acid. both seV and WEEV infection induced IFN- mRNA accumulation in be(2)-C/m cells. UV-inactivated WEEV failed to potently stimulate IFN- transcription in be(2)-C/m cells. this suggests viral replication was required for full innate immune system activation. expression of dnIRF-3 decreased the IFN- transcriptional response to WEEV infection by >90% compared to control BE(2)-C/m cells transfected with empty vector. we also examined the effects of dnIRF-3 expression on WEEV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) and infectious virion production in BE(2)-C/m cells. similar differences in viral titers were seen when tissue culture supernatants were examined at 20 hpi. IRF-3 enhances neuronal survival in BE(2)-C/m cells in response to WEEV infection irrespective of viral inoculum. at 12 hours postinfection there was minimal WEEV-induced CPE in both empty vector- and dnIRF-3-expressing cells regardless of viral inoculum. at 12 hpi the percentage of cells in both groups at 12 hpi decreased as expected but did not differ between empty vector- and dnIRF-3-expressing cells. a significant difference in viability compared to that of control cells was evident at both 24 and 48 hpi. -type or constitutively active IRF-3 in be(2)-C/m cells resulted in the production of type I IFNs prior to infection. we used primary cortical neurons derived from wild-type and IRF-3/ mice. absence of IRF-3 reduced but did not eliminate WEEV-induced IFN- transcriptional upregulation in cultured mice. IRF-3 mediates IFN- transcriptional induction and enhances neuronal survival in primary mouse cortical neurons. primary cortical neurons derived from wild-type (wt) C57BL/6 (lanes 1 to 6) and IRF-3/ (lanes 7 to 12) mice were either mock infected (lanes 1 to 3 and 7 to 9) or infected with WEEV at an MOI of 1 (lanes 4 to 6 and 10 to 12), and IFN-, neurotropic flavivirus responsible for both endemic and epidemic cases of arboviral encephalitis in the united states (42). we initially examined the IFN- transcriptional response to LACV or SLEV infection in be(2)-C/m cells by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 5A, lanes 4 to 6) in control cells transfected with empty vector, both viruses induced IFN- mRNA transcription. a dnIRF-3 mutant lacking a DNA binding domain enhanced WEEV-mediated CPE in BE(2)-C/m neuronal cells. neuronal IRF-3-dependent cytoprotective response is independent of type I IFN autocrine or paracrine signaling. we have not detected any secreted type I IFNs in supernatants of infected neuronal cells. we prepared primary cortical neuron cultures from mice lacking the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR/) and control mice. there were no differences in WEEV-induced CPE between untreated neurons isolated from wild-type and IFNAR/ mice irrespective of virus inoculum. WEEV infection at an MOI of 1 suppressed both extracellular and transfected poly(I-C)-induced ISRE activation in BE(2)-C/m cells. the level of suppression was increased if cells were infected 1.5 h prior to poly(I-C) stimulation. this suppression was likely due to disruption of poly(I-C)-stimulated IFN- induction. BE(2)-C/m NF-B promoter-reporter cells were infected with WEEV at an MOI of 1 for 1.5 h. both reporter activity and viability were assessed relative to mock-infected controls at 16 to 20 hpi. transcripts for the indicated genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR 4 h after stimulation. we measured mRNA production of the IFN-stimulated genes ISG15 and OASL. the genes are induced by both IRF-3-dependent PRR signaling and IFNAR signaling (45) at an MOI of 1 WEEV infection 3 h prior to ligand stimulation suppressed poly(I-C)-induced IFN-, ISG15, and OASL mRNA upregulation. cloned the entire structural region (C-E) and individual capsid (C), nsP1, nsP2, and nsP3 genes into cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-driven plasmids for transient expression in mammalian cells. we subsequently transfected these viral genes into BE(2)-C/m cell lines expressing ISRE- and NF-B-promoter reporter genes. toxicity from transient overexpression of any viral gene, as assessed by MTT assay. be(2)-C/m NF-B promoter-reporter cells were transfected and stimulated as described above for panel A except that 25 ng/ml TNF- was used instead of IFN--A/D. expression of the entire WEEV structural genes suppressed extracellular poly(I-C)-induced responses, whereas no suppression with this ligand was seen with WNV NS1 or NS2A or any of the WEEV nonstructural proteins. ectopic expression of WEEV capsid or complete structural genes suppressed extracellular poly(I-C)-induced reporter gene activation. WEEV capsid and complete structural protein expression constructs did not contain a V5 epitope tag. the inability to detect capsid protein by immunoblotting was likely due to low-level expression in BE(2)-C/m cells. RT-PCR readily demonstrated mRNA production (data not shown) the capsid proteins of the related alphaviruses VEEV and EEEV suppress host gene transcription and translation. however, WEEV capsid protein did not globally inhibit host signal transduction and gene expression as measured by transcription and reporter gene assays. however, to directly assess the impact of WEEV infection on host gene expression, we examined the kinetics of virus-mediated host translational suppression. WEEV-mediated suppression of host translation is reduced in neuronal cells. control BHK-21 (lanes 1 to 6) or BE(2)-C/m (lanes 7 to 10) were infected with WEEV at an MOI of 10. lysates were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy at the indicated times postinfection. dnIRF-3 suppressed ISRE reporter gene activity stimulated by adapter protein saTRIF and the PRR MDA5 but had no effect on reporter activity stimulated by saIRF-3. WEEV capsid and structural gene expression inhibited saTRIF-, MDA5- and saIRF-3-mediated activation of ISRE reporter gene activation. be(2)-C/m ISRE promoter-reporter cells were cotransfected with a control HA-tagged -galactosidase (-gal) expression vector. a second vector containing no insert or encoding a dominant negative IRF-3 (dnIRF-3) or the WEEV nsP1, capsid (Cap), and a third vector encoding the indicated superactive (sa) or wild-type PRR-pathway component results with the WEEV structural gene cassette showed a similar lack of correlation. exogenous saTRIF, MDA5, and saIRF-3 levels were reduced by 45%, 5%, and 1% respectively. results suggest that WEEV capsid protein suppressed PRR pathway signaling downstream of IRF-3 activation. EV failed to potently stimulate IFN- transcription in be(2)-C/m cells. both seV and WEEV induced IFN- transcription in hESC-derived neurons. qRT-PCR was done at 20 to 24 hpi. expression of dnIRF-3 decreased the IFN- transcriptional response to WEEV infection by >90% compared to control BE(2)-C/m cells transfected with empty vector. we also examined the effects of dnIRF-3 expression on WEEV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) and infectious virion production in BE(2)-C/m cells. be(2)-C/m cells stably expressing control vector or dnIRF-3 construct were infected with WEEV at the indicated MOI. percent viability relative to mock-infected controls was measured from 12 to 72 hpi. representative overlaid images from one of two independent experiments are shown. >95% of cells in both groups infected with an MOI of 10 had detectable WEEV antigens at this time point. at lower inocula the percentage of WEEV-infected cells at 12 hpi decreased as expected but did not differ between empty vector- and dnIRF-3-expressing cells. a significant difference in viability compared to that of control cells was evident at both 24 and 48 hpi, whereas virus-induced cell death was virtually complete by primary cortical neurons derived from wild-type and IRF-3/ mice. absence of IRF-3 reduced but did not eliminate WEEV-induced IFN- transcriptional upregulation in cultured mouse neurons. absence of IRF-3 also increased susceptibility of mouse neurons to WEEV-mediated CPE. mice were either mock infected (lanes 1 to 3 and 7 to 9) or infected with WEEV at an MOI of 1 (lanes 4 to 6 and 10 to 12), and IFN-, WEEV E1 and rRNA transcript levels were assayed by semiquantitative RT-PCR at 20 hpi. dnIRF-3 expression inhibited SLEV-induced IFN- mRNA accumulation by 10-fold. neuronal cells expressing dnIRF-3 were significantly more susceptible to SLEV-mediated CPE but not to LACV-mediated CPE. be(2)-C/m cells stably transfected with empty control vector (closed symbols) or a dnIRF-3 construct (open symbols) were infected with SLEV (B) or LACV (C) at the indicated MOI. viability relative to mock-infected controls was measured from 12 to 72 hpi. control cultures pretreated with type I IFNs showed expected protective effects. there were no differences in WEEV-induced CPE between untreated neurons isolated from wild-type and IFNAR/ mice irrespective of virus inoculum. neuronal prosurvival responses to WEEV are independent of type I IFN autocrine or paracrine activity. WEEV infection at an MOI of 1 suppressed both extracellular and transfected poly(I-C)-induced ISRE activation in BE(2)-C/m cells. the level of suppression was increased if cells were infected 1.5 h prior to stimulation. this suppression was likely due to disruption of poly(I-C)-stimulated IFN- induction. we used 100 U/ml IFN-/-A/D, 50 g/ml extracellular poly(I-C) (pIC) and 500 ng/ml transfected poly(I-C) (T-pIC) for stimulation. be(2)-C/m NF-B promoter-reporter cells were mock infected or infected with WEEV at an MOI of 1 for 3 h. transcripts for the indicated genes were analyzed by q h prior to ligand stimulation suppressed poly(I-C)-induced IFN-, ISG15, and OASL mRNA upregulation (Fig. 7C, group 3) but not exogenous type I IFN-induced ISG15 or OASL mRNA upregulation (Fig. 7C, group 2). Similar results were obtained with additional IFN-stimulated genes, including MxB and Rsad2/viperin. be(2)-C/m NF-B promoter-reporter cells were cotransfected with a control HA-tagged -galactosidase (-gal) expression vector. cells were stimulated 48 h after transfection with 100 U/ml IFN--A/D, 50 g/ml extracellular poly(I-C) (pIC), or 700 ng/ml transfected poly(I-C) (T-pIC), and reporter NF- was used instead of IFN--A/D. Lysates from BE(2)-C/m cells transfected with WNV (lanes 2 and 3) or WEEV (lanes 4 to 6) were analyzed by immunoblotting for HA-tagged -gal, V5-tagged viral proteins, and GAPDH as a loading control. ectopic expression of WEEV capsid or complete structural genes also suppressed TNF-induced NF-B-reporter gene activation. it was unclear why WNV NS1 and NS2A, in contrast to WEEV structural genes, showed differential suppressive effects on ISRE promoter activity between extracellular and transfected poly(I-C) delivery. the WEEV capsid and complete structural protein expression constructs did not contain a V5 epitope tag. the inability to detect capsid protein by immunoblotting was likely due to low-level expression in BE(2)-C/m cells. the inability to detect capsid protein by immunoblotting was likely due to low-level expression in BE(2)-C/m cells. WEEV infection suppressed host translation in BHK-21 cells. cellular protein synthesis was reduced by >80% at 12 hpi. cellular protein synthesis was suppressed by 40% at 12 hpi. control BHK-21 (lanes 1 to 6) or BE(2)-C/m (lanes 7 to 10) were infected with WEEV at an MOI of 10 and labeled with 50 Ci/ml [35S]methionine-cysteine for 30 min prior to harvesting at 3, 6, 9, and 12 hpi. dnIRF-3 suppressed ISRE reporter gene activity stimulated by adapter protein saTRIF and the PRR MDA5 but had no effect on reporter activity stimulated by saIRF-3. we transfected ISRE reporter-bearing BE(2)-C/m cells with vectors expressing a constitutively active TLR adapter molecule, TRIF (saTRIF), the cytosolic PRR MDA5 or a constitutively active downstream nIRF-3) or the WEEV nsP1, capsid (Cap), or capsid-envelope (Cap-Env) protein. a third vector encoding the indicated superactive (sa) or wild-type PRR-pathway component was measured 48 h after transfection. results are expressed relative to empty vector transfected controls (dashed line) we examined the functional impact of IRF-3-dependent innate immune pathways in neuronal cells infected with globally relevant arboviruses. we drew five main conclusions from these studies. first, WEEV activated neuronal PRR pathways in a replication- and IRF-3-dependent manner. an IRF-3-dependent decrease in virion production with WEEV-infected be(2)-C/m human neuronal cells. this may represent a species-specific difference or disparity between primary and immortalized cells. an innate immune response in neurons may require a balance between promoting cell survival and limiting virus replication, albeit incompletely. innate immune responses triggered by PRR ligation often involve multiple and complex overlapping pathways that control hundreds of genes. NF-B activation induces protective antiapoptotic activity in many cell types (61) and may mediate neurogenesis (62) and protection of neurons from ischemia. preliminary studies suggest both MDA5 and RIG-I contribute to neuronal innate immune responses after WEEV infection in cultured cells. but definitive results to implicate specific PRR pathways after WEEV infection await detailed in vivo studies with neuron-specific conditional knockout mice. most successful viruses possess targeted or global countermeasures to prevent innate immune pathway activation. yin et al. showed that VEEV infection of primary mouse cortical neurons potently inhibited IFN-/-induced ISG upregulation. we did not examine the effect of WEEV infection or exogenous capsid expression on individual steps in the type IFN signaling pathway. however, we cannot exclude a direct impact of WEEV on specific signaling events such as STAT1/2 phosphorylation or nuclear translocation. IFN- mRNA induction in infected neurons delayed in comparison to poly(I-C)-stimulated responses. neuronal cytoprotective responses eventually failed, even with low MOI inocula."}
