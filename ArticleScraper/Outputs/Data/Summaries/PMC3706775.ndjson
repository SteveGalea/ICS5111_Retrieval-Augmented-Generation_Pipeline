{"summary": "the aim of this exploratory study was to estimate changes in family circumstances, social and economic stability, care requirements and access to health services for patients during their first 12 months after ICU discharge. there was little evidence of a change in accommodation or relationship status between pre-admission and 12 months following discharge from an ICU. over the 5 years following an ICU admission there is an excess mortality for these patients compared to an age and sex matched population [1,2] there is now a substantial body of evidence to show that significant numbers of survivors of critical illness experience reduced cognitive function and longer-term physical and psychological impairments. there is limited rigorous research into the social and economic impact that a period of critical illness imposes on both the patient and their immediate family. aims of this exploratory study of a representative sample of survivors of adult, general intensive care treatment were to explore the use of a novel questionnaire set. aims were to estimate changes in family circumstances and social and economic stability;. assess what additional assistance (general care with living and specific health care) patients believed they required. a self-completed questionnaire-based study was a self-completed questionnaire-based study. the booklet included the EQ-5D [17], EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) [17], short form 36 Version 2 (SF-36v2; licensed pro bono from QualityMetric Inc, Lincoln, RI, USA) there was no prohibition on family members or carers helping with survey completion. the EQ-VAS is a self-rated health status using a visual analogue scale graduated from 0 (the worst imaginable health state) to 100 (the best imaginable state) the SF-36 is a comprehensive, generic 36-item questionnaire that is used extensively in clinical practice to describe HR-QoL [18]. it has been demonstrated to be an acceptable and reliable tool for use in the ICU population and its use for quality of life assessment following critical illness has been recommended. data was retrieved manually from non-ICNARC-contributing ICUs. data was uploaded into an SQL database (MySQL v5, Oracle Corporation, Redwood Shores, CA) data underwent a quality assurance process and outlying or inconsistent data points were verified with the contributing investigators. the questionnaire booklet was mailed to consenting patients at 6 and 12 months after ICU admission together with an accompanying letter. in the event of non-response, a second questionnaire booklet was mailed. the protocol allowed the study team to make one telephone call. the patient's primary care physician was contacted after two failed mailing attempts. the demographic, social and economic impact question set was developed in conjunction with the department of public health, university of Oxford. the demographic questions were adapted from a draft of the Office of National Statistics' questionnaire intended for use during the 2011 national census [25]. analysis The data underwent a quality assurance process and outlying or inconsistent data points were verified with the contributing investigators. all data were assessed for normality, with subsequent analyses performed using t-tests, non-parametric equivalent or analysis of variance. 97% of responders reported no change in their relationship status. there was little evidence of a change in accommodation status between ICU discharge and the 6-month and 12-month follow-up time points. prior to admission 40% of patients reported themselves as being in full or part-time employment. at 12 months after ICU discharge 45% of all patients reported no change in their monthly family income. 32% reported a reduction and 22% an increase. figures show a dominant reduction in reported income bands. 79% of ICU patients reported attending a clinic appointment with their primary care physician and 44% had seen a community-based nurse. the majority had also been reviewed by a hospital specialist team. a small number of patients had seen a health professional about social, psychological or emotional issues. 6 months % 12 months % Mobility N: I have no problems with self-care 87% 72% 74% M: I have some problems washing or dressing myself 12% 26% 25% E: I am unable to perform my usual activities 5% 11% 11% Pain/discomfort N: I have no pain or discomfort 49% 27% 31% M: I have moderate pain or discomfort 41% 62% 59% E: I am moderately anxious or depressed 4% 5% 7% EuroQol UK SF-36v2 component scores for patients responding at 6 and 12 months Physical component score 6 months 12 months Parameter Range n % Mean SD Mean SD All 196 100% 31.32 14.02 33.74 14.99 Age 64 120 61% 31.23 14.69 34.58 15.91 > 64 76 39% 31.46 12.97 32.41 13.41 APACHE 18 113 60% 31.29 13.79 33.90 15.41 II > 18 76 40% 30.14 13.14 13.66 32.47 14. APACHE II: Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II; SF-36v2: Short Form 36 Version 2 Loss to follow-up For 46% of these patients their GP was unaware of any reason that would prevent them from responding to the study mailings. a further 23% were receiving home assistance, 15% died without the knowledge of the investigators and 4% were in sheltered accommodation or homeless. ding those retired prior to ICU admission, there was a demonstrable reduction in reported income from wages or self-employment at 6 months. this reduction predominately occurred in those patients who reported employment as their sole source of income prior to admission. the sum total of individual patients claiming state financial support was less at 12 months in comparison with 6 months. in 30 cases at 6 months, a family member had been given long-term leave, had to leave a job, reduce hours or stop work to provide care. by 12 months, 7 patients no longer declared a family care requirement. by 12 months, a family member had experienced a significant reduction in employment activity for at least a year.

EQ-5D data show many need help with everyday activities and medical care. many will experience stress and negative health outcomes themselves. majority of survivors report visiting primary care physicians and utilizing community nursing services. all follow-up studies are vulnerable to enrolment bias. patients were consented during the final days of their hospital admission or in an ICU follow-up clinic. loss-to-follow-up rate may limit the generalizability of any results. a retrospective control sample matched in terms of age, sex and acute and chronic disease is very challenging and has significant limitations. following analysis we have excluded a variety of questions that were found to be inconsistent in terms of their response or application. a significant proportion of those who return to work do not return to their pre-existing level of income or workload commitment. a significant proportion of those who return to work do not return to their pre-existing level of income or workload commitment. this suggests that those family members who become informal caregivers make adjustments to their working lives, resulting in a reduction in financial status.
