{"summary": "despite the seriousness of dengue-related disease, a clear understanding of dengue pathogenesis remains elusive. the development of genomics technology, microarray and high throughput quantitative PCR have allowed researchers to study gene expression changes on a much broader scale. dengue-related disease results in an estimated 50\u2013100 million cases of dengue fever and 250,000 to 500,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome each year. infection with one serotype of dengue virus confers life-long protective immunity to that serotype, but does not protect the host from infection with other serotypes. dengue inhibits IFN and IFN signaling by suppressing Jak-Stat activation. combination of reduced host defense, increased uptake of the virus and delayed viral clearance likely synergizes to produce higher viremia. development of genomics technology has allowed researchers to study gene expression changes on a much larger scale. the expression of 15 genes involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, membrane trafficking and cytoskeleton was found to be altered after infection[13]. a different microarray system containing 7600 cDNA oligonucleotides was used to study the host response to dengue infection, initially in a human hepatocytic cell line. the type 2 dengue virus strain TSV01 was obtained from a dengue outbreak in townsville, Australia. each cell line was infected with dengue virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and 10 for 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hrs before being evaluated by plaque assay. ants were collected for plaque assay, cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells was monitored using fluorescein diacetate (FDA, Acros Organics, Belgium), 10 g/ml added to cells for 25 min at room temperature. Flow cytometry Dengue E-protein was assessed in suspension HepG2 cells by intracellular staining and fluorescence activated cell sorter (Becton Dickinson, USA) 60 mer oligonucleotide probes were spotted onto poly-L-lysine-coated microscope slides using GeneMachines OmniGrid Microarray Spotter (USA) for fluorescence labeling of target cDNAs, 20 g of total RNA from universal human reference were reverse transcribed in the presence of Cy3-dUTP and Cy5-dUTP. array data then underwent lowess normalization [19] available in an R package fudge constant is found by removing trend in d as a function of s in moving windows across the data to reduce false positive results. the false discovery rate (FDR) associated with the given threshold can also be calculated from the permutation data. the enrolled dengue cases were either of serotype 1 or 3. the enrolled dengue cases were either of serotype 1 or 3. the enrolled dengue cases were either of serotype 1 or 3. cell lines were infected with dengue virus (TSV01; MOI 1) for 48 hrs. plaque assay was used to determine virus production. each cell line was infected with dengue virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and 10 for 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hrs. culture supernatants were collected for plaque assay. concentrations of plaque forming units per ml (pfu/ml) were calculated. cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells was monitored using fluorescein diacetate. microarray Human arrays of 19,800 60mer oligonucleotide probes were used according to the standard protocol described for cDNA microarray. the arrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000B Scanner (Axon Instruments, USA) to measure Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence signals intensity and format data for data base deposition. differentially expressed genes were selected using a procedure known as Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) [20], described in brief below. the statistic used in SAM is given as where; the numerator is the group mean difference, s the standard error, and s 0 a regularizing constant. this value is found by removing the trend in d as a function of s in moving windows across the data to reduce false positive results. patient samples Subjects were enrolled from the early DENgue study. the enrolled dengue cases were either of serotype 1 or 3. the enrolled dengue cases were either of serotype 1 or 3. 10 ml blood sample was collected, serum was separated within 5 hrs. serum was stored at 80\u00b0C. the highest yielding cell lines A549 and HepG2 (a hepatoma cell line) were used in further studies. microarray identification of host responses to dengue virus replication using the HepG2 infection model Viral replication in HepG2 cells infected with dengue virus TSV01 for 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours compared to heat inactivated virus. all three methods showed that new viral replication began after 24 hours and reached a plateau at 72 hrs. further analysis of the 124 genes suggested the involvement of NF-B-mediated cytokine/chemokine responses (NFKBIB, NFKB1A, TNFA1P, CCL4, CCL5, IP-10 and I-TAC amongst others) also suggested the involvement of ubiquitin related genes (HERC5, HERC6, UBE2L6, USP15 and others) RNA was extracted and used to quantitate viral RNA copies by real time PCR. the copy number is represented by dividing the cycle detection threshold (Ct) value at the limit of detection (40) by the sample Ct value (40/PCR units) at 48 hrs 31 of the 95 genes were differentially expressed. at 72 hrs 62 of the 95 genes were differentially expressed. 67 genes were shown to be differentially expressed comparing blood samples taken at acute fever stage to convalescence. 50 genes were upregulated in at least one time point in HepG2 cells and in at least one time point in A549 cells and in dengue patient samples. the NF-B gene alone was added to the network, despite not being from our common list. the NF-B gene alone was added to the network, despite not being from our common list. qPCR confirmed, common differentially expressed genes in hepG2, a549 cell lines and dengue patients. a network of direct interactions (highlighted by * in B, C & D) was identified by the MetaCore program. arrowhead indicates directional interaction. Adding dexamethasone to the HepG2 infection model prevented IP-10 and I-TAC production, but had no effect on viral replication. these results suggest that NF-B activation, and IP-10 and I-TAC production, do not have a direct effect on viral replication. I-TAC levels in dengue fever patients at second visit were significantly lower than at first visit. viperin has previously been identified as an IFN-induced anti-viral protein in HCMV and HCV infection. wildtype (WT) and viperin overexpressing (Vip) A549 cells were infected with dengue virus TSV01 (MOI 1) for 48 hrs. a P value of 0.00004 was obtained comparing each treatment to DMSO alone. proteasome inhibitors, MG-132 and ALLN, were introduced to the HepG2 dengue infection model. at lower concentrations, both MG-132 and ALLN significantly reduced virus replication in the cell lines by over 50%. higher concentrations of the inhibitors had an even greater effect (>90% reduction in pfu/ml) but with a degree of cytotoxicity. microarray identification of host responses to dengue virus replication was determined by plaque assay of the virus released in the cell culture medium (Figure 1A), FACS analysis of infected cells labeled intracellularly with an Alexa 674-conjugated antibody against dengue E protein (4G2) all three methods showed that new viral replication began after 24 hours. after 72 hrs a degree of cell death become apparent. okine responses (NFKBIB, NFKB1A, TNFA1P, CCL4, CCL5, IP-10 and I-TAC amongst others) and ubiquitin related genes (HERC5, HERC6, UBE2L6, USP15 and others) were observed in our array results. other genes that were significantly changed included those associated with cell signaling, lipid metabolism, cell cycle and vesicular transport. heat map of the microarray gene expression profile of cells treated with live dengue virus TSV01 (V) or heat inactivated TSV01 (H) transcripts identified as being differentially expressed by SAM analysis. details on gene name, gene function, SAM statistics, and fold change for all 132 selected transcripts are given in Table S1. plaque assay revealed that peak viral production occurred earlier than in the HepG2 model. 63 genes at 48 hr time point and 82 genes at 72 hr time point. the quantitative PCR also revealed a higher number of differentially expressed genes. the NF-B gene alone was added to the network, despite not being from our common list, to illustrate the connections between those induced by it. qPCR confirmed, common differentially expressed genes in HepG2, A549 cell lines and dengue patients. 32 confirmed genes cluster to three biological pathways. NF-B/chemokine-genes (C) Type I IFN-mediated. ubiquitin-proteasome system. culture supernatants of cells infected with TSV01 (MOI 10) or heat-inactivated TSV-01 (HI-TSV01; MOI 10) for 72 hrs were analyzed for IP-10 (A) and I-TAC (B) by ELISA. results are expressed as means.e.m. where n = 3\u20135. I-TAC levels in dengue fever patients at the second visit were significantly lower than at first visit. viperin was one of the most highly upregulated genes in the type I IFN response pathway. viperin overexpressing (Vip) A549 cells were infected with dengue virus TSV01 (MOI 1) for 48 hrs. a P value of 0.00004 was obtained by students t-test. proteasome inhibitors, MG-132 and ALLN, significantly reduced virus replication in the cell lines by over 50%. higher concentrations of the inhibitors had an even greater effect (>90% reduction in pfu/ml) but with a degree of cytotoxicity (Figures 5B, 5C) the overlap of upregulated genes, determined by quantitative PCR, in the two cell systems and in patients removed any responses that were unique to the cell type. we observed cell type specific gene changes such as IL-8, PAI-1 and RANTES that were upregulated in the cell lines but not the cells. in a dengue intracerebral mouse infection models, CXCR3/ and IP10/ mice both had higher mortality rate than wild type mice after infection. IP-10 and CXCR3 receptors are part of the host defense mechanism, most likely in recruitment of T cells to the infection site. however, the relevance of this study to human patients is not clear. the low platelet count was used as the measure of severity by which the ten selected patients were classified as having more severe dengue fever. we cannot at this point make a link between the level of IP-10, I-TAC and disease severity because of the small number of cases used in this study. the ability of IFN pre-treatment to inhibit subsequent dengue replication has been previously reported [9],[40], as has the importance of IFN in the anti-viral response. the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in the conjugation of single or multiple ubiquitin molecules to direct protein trafficking or degradation. in dengue, ubiquitin-proteasome genes have not been reported to be involved in the dengue virus life cycle. ubiquitin-proteasome genes have not been reported to be involved in the dengue virus life cycle. -proteasome plays in dengue virus replication which may involve trafficking of the virus to the plasma membrane or the maturation and fusion of the virus upon release. it is instructive to compare our results with those of a published microarray study investigating host responses in patient blood [50]. gue virus TSV01 compared to heat-inactivated virus 48 and 72 hours post infection. qV is the SAM calculated q value for each gene. genes selected for real-time PCR validation are indicated by a tick."}
