{"summary": "nidoviruses (Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae) are important pathogens that cause significant diseases in animals and humans. the genome length of arteriviridae members is approximately 12.7 to 15.7 kb, among the \u201csmall-genome nidoviruses\u201d (7). ORF1a and ORF1b comprise approximately 80% of the viral genome. nsp9 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and nsp10 (helicase) (7) are the key replicative enzymes in the replicase/transcriptase complex. nsp11 (endoribonuclease) may also play a key role in arterivirus replication. the endoribonuclease activity of coronavirus (CoV) nsp15 and arterivirus nsp11 has been confirmed. recombinant arterivirus nsp11 displays broad substrate specificity in vitro (20) there is no detailed structural information to date for arterivirus nsp11. mutant and wild-type nsp11 gene sequences were cloned by PCR amplification into pET-42b (+) with a C-terminal His6 tag. wild-type nsp11 flanked by an N-terminal His6 tag and a C-terminal His6 tag was cloned into pCAGGS vector using the ecoRI and XhoI restriction sites. transformed cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in LB medium containing 50 g/ml kanamycin. induction with 0.8 mM IPTG (isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside) was performed. cell growth continued for an additional 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8,500 rpm for 5 min in a high-speed refrigerated centrifuge (CR-21G; Hitachi), resuspended with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO412H2O, and 2 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4) after centrifugation at 8,500 crystallization screens for wild-type nsp11 and the K173A mutant protein at a concentration of 8 mg/ml were performed via the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method at 20\u00b0C. the best crystals for both wild-type and Se-Met-labeled nsp11 were obtained by vapor diffusion in hanging drops consisting of 3 l of reservoir solution. 11 monomer were located, and the initial phases were calculated using the AutoSol program from the PHENIX software suite (26) manual model rebuilding was performed using COOT (27) and then refined in the PHENIX software suite. the highest-resolution values are indicated in parentheses. c Rwork = ||Fo| |Fc||/|Fo| is the observed and calculated structure factors, respectively. 5% of the measured reflections have been excluded from the refinement and set aside for cross-validation. buried surface areas between the two monomers and the root mean square deviation (RMSD) were analyzed using PDBePISA (http://pdbe.org/pisa/) and PDBeFold (http://pdbe.org/fold mutant (K173A) protein was purified for size exclusion experiments. oligomerization of wild-type and mutant nsp11 proteins was analyzed using a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 200 mM NaCl at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min (4\u00b0C) sedimentation velocity analysis was carried out using an XL-A model centrifuge (Proteome Lab) at 45,000 rpm and 18\u00b0C in 400-l double-sector cells. data were interpreted with the model-based distribution of Lamm equation solutions [c(s] using Origin 8.0 software. mutant (H144A, R153A, D180A, and D204A) nsp11 proteins were analyzed in triplicate. luciferase activity was measured using a dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) HEK293T cells were transfected with various plasmids using the same method. at 40 h posttransfection, cells were harvested by adding lysis buffer. expression of GAPDH was detected with anti-GAPDH monoclonal Ab. an equal volume (100 l) of CellTiter-Glo reagent was added. the reaction mixture was shaken for 2 min on an orbital shaker and incubated for a further 10 min at room temperature. wild-type nsp11 flanked by an -terminal hemagglutinin (HA tag) was cloned into pCAGGS vector. the recombinant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain. the cells were grown for an additional 5 h at 37\u00b0C before harvesting. a selenomethionine (Se-Met)-labeled nsp11 mutant (K173A) was expressed in trans BL21(DE3) pLysS using M9 salt medium. the amino acid mixture (100 mg lysine, phenylalanine, and threonine per liter; 50 mg isoleucine, leucine, and valine per liter; and 60 mg selenomethion purified protein was concentrated to approximately 2.0 ml and filtered using buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl and 1 M NaCl, pH 7.4) for crystallization, the purified protein was concentrated to approximately 8 mg/ml, flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80\u00b0C. crystals of the se-Met derivative (K173A) mutant were obtained to solve the phase problem. data collection was performed at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) with a BL17U1 beam line (wavelength = 0.97910, temperature = 100K) the structure of nsp11 was solved by the use of the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) method and a Se-Met derivative K173A mutant. 42.66\u20132.75 No. of reflections 16,931 Rwork/Rfreec (%) 22.8/28.6 No of protein atoms 3383 No. of solvent atoms 17 RMSD Bond length () 0.010 Bond angle (\u00b0) 1.323 Avg B factor (2) 56 Ramachandran plot: core, allow, disallow (%) 94.3, 5, 0.7 a The highest-resolution values are indicated in parentheses. the analyzed viruses were as follows: HCoV-HKU1 (human coronavirus HKU1; YP_173236), SARS-CoV (SARS coronavirus wtic-MB; AGT21317), MHV (murine hepatitis virus strain A59; NP_740619), PEDV (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; AIM47753), HCoV-229E (human coronavirus 229E wild-type and mutant (S74A, F76A, and R153A) nsp11 proteins eluted in different fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. sedimentation velocity analysis was carried out using an XL-A model centrifuge (Proteome Lab) every 3 min. the activity was assayed with an excitation wavelength of 492 nm and an emission wavelength of 518 nm using a fluorescence time scan. the activity assays for the wild-type and mutant (S74A, S76A, H129A, K173A, and Y219A) nsp11 proteins were performed in triplicate. total transfected DNAs equalized to 0.52 g by the addition of empty pCAGGS vector. at 24 h after the initial transfection, the cells were infected with Sendai virus (SEV) the different doses of the wild-type plasmid (0 to 0.3 g) were transfected. total transfected DNAs were equalized to 0.3 g by the addition of empty pCAGGS vector. cell viability was evaluated using cellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay reagent. wild-type nsp11 causes cell cytotoxicity and death after an extended expression time (approximately 3 h) the duration of wild-type nsp11 expression was examined at different times (0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, and 90 min) at 37\u00b0C. the yield of mutant protein reached approximately 5 to 6 mg/liter (37\u00b0C, 5 h) crystal belongs to space group P41212 and consists of two subunits in an asymmetric unit. subunit A is visibly different from subunit B (Fig. 1C, D, and E) residues in regions Asp134-Gly141, Ser166-Lys173, and Leu222-Glu223 could not be traced due to a lack of interpretable electron density. the two monomers (designated A and B) are colored yellow and magenta, respectively. the NTD, LKD, and catalytic domain are marked as described for panel A. the missing residues are highlighted with blue ribbons in subunit B. mutant (S74A, F76A, and R153A) proteins by gel filtration yielded two 280-nm absorption peaks. these two mutations significantly disrupt the dimerization in solution. oligomerization of wild-type and mutant (S74A, F76A, and R153A) nsp11 proteins was further analyzed. carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms are shown as black, blue, and red circles. hydrogen bond interactions are shown as black dashed lines between donor and acceptor atoms. arcs with spokes radiating toward the atoms they contact. the major peaks of wild-type nsp11 and the mutants (S74A, F76A, and R153A) are shown in panel F. a total binding surface of 1,309 2 is buried at the interface (Fig. 3A), which is smaller than the subunit A-subunit B binding surface of SARS-CoV nsp15. the monomer-monomer buried surface areas of PRRSV nsp11 and SARS-CoV nsp15 were analyzed using PDBePISA. the monomer-monomer buried surfaces of PRRSV nsp11 and SARS-CoV nsp15 were analyzed using PDBePISA. the mutant proteins were not purely monomeric. gel filtration chromatography revealed that the 280-nm absorption peak of the mutant S74A protein was obviously lower than that of the mutant F76A protein with the same amount of total protein. this may be the reason why the NendoU activity of the mutant is lower than that of the mutant F76A mutant. crystal structure indicates that nsp11 assembles into dimers, which is different from coronavirus nsp15 (19, 21) the monomer structure of SARS-CoV nsp15 includes three domains, the N-terminal domain (NTD), the middle domain, and the catalytic domain (23) the NTD is critical for hexamerization and interactions with the middle domain and the catalytic domain of an adjacent monomer (19, 23). however, the NTD nsp15 (Asn62-Ser197) and MHV nsp15 (Ser62-Leu228) are enlarged in panels A and B. the dimerization site determinants Ser74 and Phe76 are labeled with a ball-and-stick (yellow, PRRSV nsp11; magenta, SARS-CoV nsp15 and MHV nsp15, respectively) p134 to Gly141 and Ser166 to Lys173 are missing in subunit B. the loops consisting of residues His129 to His144 and Val162 to Thr179 are identified as the \u201cactive site loop\u201d and \u201csupporting loop\u201d respectively. the electron density of these loops is missing in subunit B, indicating that they are flexibly disordered. the structure of nsp11 reveals nidovirus-wide conservation of the catalytic domain. the amino acid sequence identity between arterivirus nsp11 and coronavirus nsp15 is only approximately 16.1% to 25.1%, as demonstrated by their distance on the evolutionary tree. the structure of PRRSV nsp11 superimposed onto the structures of SARS-CoV nsp15 (PDB code 2H85, magenta) and MHV nsp15 (PDB code 2GTH, magenta) the structure of the catalytic domain (ile108-Glu223) of PRRSV nsp11 superimposed with SARS-CoV nsp15 (Asp199-Leu345) and MHV nsp15 are thought to accept and donate protons during production of the 2\u2032-3\u2032-cyclic phosphate. previous studies also showed that residues His129, His144, and Lys173 are essential for endoribonuclease activity in coronaviruses and arteriviruses. the recombinant arterivirus nsp11 protein displays broad substrate specificity in vitro. it is possible that the suppression of IFN- induction by wild-type nsp11 is due to its cytotoxicity. pRL-TK, an internal control reporter, was significantly lower in cells expressing wild-type nsp11 than in cells expressing nsp11 mutants. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with IRF3-Luc plasmid (0.1 g) (A) of IFN-\u2013Luc (B) and pRL-TK plasmid (0.02 g) at 24 h after transfection, the cells were infected with Sendai virus (SEV) at 40 h posttransfection, the cells were harvested and the luciferase activity was measured. arterivirus endoribonuclease nsp11 has a novel dimeric structure that dramatically distinguishes it from coronavirus nsp15. mutation of key residues disrupts dimerization in solution and markedly impairs the endoribonuclease activity in vitro. structural analyses showed that the absence of adjacent monomer interactions might damage the structural stability of the catalytic domain. the duration of wild-type nsp11 expression was examined at different times (0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, and 90 min) at 37\u00b0C, with 60 min found to be the best expression time. the yields of wild-type nsp11 from the expression vectors were estimated to be approximately 0.05 mg and 0.2 mg of protein, respectively, per liter of bacterial cell culture. in contrast, the yield of mutant protein reached approximately 5 to 6 mg/liter can be divided into two major parts: the N-terminal domain (NTD; Gly1 to Phe90) and the C-terminal catalytic domain (Arg107 to Glu223) the catalytic domain has a typical fold consisting of a compact groove region containing sequentially connected left and right parts. the left part of the catalytic domain consists of two -helices (3 and 4) and six -strands (7 to 12), and the right part is formed by three anti the side views of the molecular surface of nsp11 are shown at the same angles (C, D, and E). nsp11 eluted primarily in one peak; the calculated molecular mass is approximately 58.9 kDa. this finding is consistent with the dimeric crystal structure of nsp11. the molecular weights of monomers and dimers from the wild-type nsp11 protein are approximately 29.2 (approximately 14.04% of the total population) the sedimentation coefficient (S20,W) of the mutant proteins decreased significantly compared with the wild type. this indicated that the oligomerization of the mutant proteins had markedly changed. the calculated molecular weight of nsp11 peaks was determined by fitting to the calibration curve. volumes of elution of 10.26 ml (approximately 58.9), 10.69 ml (approximately 48.8), and 11.46 ml (approximately 34.8) are indicated by arrows. subunit A-subunit B binding surface of SARS-CoV nsp15 is 2,253.3 2. molecular weight of nsp11 is lower than that of SARS-CoV nsp15. residues in the catalytic domain of subunit A interact with 17 residues in the catalytic domain of subunit A. Detailed molecular interactions of the supporting loop (subunit A, magenta) with the active site loop (subunit A, red) and the N-terminal domain (subunit B, red) were determined using LIGPLOT. hydrogen bond interactions and hydrophobic interactions are shown as described for panel A. nsp11 endoribonucleases are labeled with different colors. nsp11 functions as a dimer rather than a hexamer. the monomer structure of nsp15 includes three domains, the N-terminal domain, the middle domain, and the catalytic domain (23). the structure of PRRSV nsp11 superimposed on the structures of SARS-CoV nsp15 (PDB code 2H85, magenta) and MHV nsp15 (PDB code 2GTH, magenta) is enlarged in panels A and B (the cartoon transparency was set at 60%). the key residues for potential NendoU activity sites and dimerization sites of PRRSV nsp11 are shown in a yellow frame. the sequences were aligned using ClustalW2, and the alignment was drawn with ESPript 3.0. residues Val135, Thr138 to Val140, Cys143, and His144 in the active site loop and residues Val165, Ser167, Lys170, and Lys170 to Ala174 in the supporting loop are observed in the structure. this finding may explain why nsp11 is fully active as a dimer. structure of PRRSV nsp11 superimposed onto the structures of nidovirus nsp15 (PDB code 2H85, magenta) and MHV nsp15 (PDB code 2GTH, magenta) potential catalytic active sites labeled with ball-and-stick (yellow, PRRSV nsp11; magenta, SARS-CoV nsp15 and MHV nsp15) representation. nidovirus endoribonuclease catalytic mechanism could be consistent with an RNase A-like reaction mechanism. Thr177 (corresponding to Ser293 and Thr321 in SARS-CoV nsp15 and MHV nsp15, respectively) could be important for substrate recognition and binding. previous studies reported that the endoribonuclease activity of PRRSV nsp11 is essential to inhibit IFN- induction. the value for pRL-TK, an internal control reporter, was significantly lower in cells expressing wild-type nsp11 than in cells expressing nsp11 mutants. however, none of the tested nsp11 mutants without cytotoxicity significantly inhibited IFN- induction. the firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla reniformis luciferase. the untreated empty vector control value was set to 1. luciferase activity was normalized to the wild-type protein. structural conservation of the catalytic domain in members of the order Nidovirales was also observed in this study. findings will serve as a structural basis for the development of new nsp11-specific antiviral drugs and other inhibitors."}
