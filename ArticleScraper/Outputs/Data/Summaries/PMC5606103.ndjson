{"summary": "74 patients with CAP were analyzed and compared using filmArray RP. results showed 100% coincidence rate in detecting coronaviruses 229E, OC43, HKU1, and NL63, human metapneumovirus, influenza A and B, and parainfluenza viruses (PIV1, PIV2, and PIV4) diagnostic methods identify a pathogen in only 30%\u201340% of CAP patients [5, 6]. the frequent lack of a microbiological diagnosis in CAP impairs pathogen-directed antimicrobial therapy. PCR method has high sensitivity and specificity in detecting multiple microorganisms and yields results faster than culture and serological methods. CAP was confirmed by radiological diagnosis. microbial yield and clinical significance in CAP diagnosis were also evaluated. obacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ornithinolytica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Bordetella pertussis were also detected. the patient's serum was collected and placed in 80\u00b0C. PCR amplification was performed using a 7500 Real-Time PCR Kit. nine bacteria were measured, including Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Bordetella pertussis. filmArray RP Assay We used the bioFireTM Diagnostics Respiratory Panel and filmArrayTM multiplex PCR system to detect the same 14 viruses and three other pathogens. the agreement between assays was measured using the kappa statistic. the agreement between assays was measured using the kappa statistic. the most prevalent were the RSV (15/74, 20.3%) and the HRV (9/74, 12.2%). influenza viruses (A + B) were detected in 10 (10/74, 13.5%) samples. influenza viruses (OC43, HKU1, and NL63) were detected in 9 (9/74, 12.2%) samples. a total of 50 (100%) of the 50 pathogens were confirmed by real-time PCR. a total of 50 (100%) of the 50 pathogens were confirmed by real-time PCR. the comparison of filmArray RP and multiple PCR for OC43, NL63, MPV, Flu A, Flu B, PIV1, and PIV4 showed satisfactory agreement (kappa > 0.7) sensitivity of FilmArray RP for PIV3 and RSV was different, with sensitivity of 80% and 83.3%, respectively. 5 cases of dual viral infection were found in both methods, 6 cases were detected by filmArray RP alone, and 1 case was detected by multiple PCR. the results showed that bacteria (or fungi) were positive in 25 (25/74, 33.8%) specimens. the Mycoplasma pneumoniae found in 6 (6/74, 8.1%) specimens was only detected by FilmArray RP. four cases of patients had the other lung diseases, while 32 cases of patients had system diseases. Cough, fever, and shortness of breath or dyspnea were the most frequently symptoms observed in these patients. negative results in two methods in viral detection. positive results were tested by only one of the two assays. PCR negative were seen in 3 cases of ADV, 6 cases of HRV, and 3 cases of RSV. multiple PCR positive/FilmArray RP negative were observed in 1 case of PIV 3 and 2 cases of RSV. a total of 50 (100%) of the 50 pathogens were confirmed by real-time PCR. filmArray RP detected more viruses than multiple PCR assays. the positive virus combination of filmArray RP and multiplex real-time PCR in detecting dual viral infection. the multiplex real-time PCR can detect a broad spectrum of respiratory microorganisms promptly, which makes it possible for clinician to treat the patients with specific antimicrobial agents. the main limitations of PCR method include the handling of whole batch samples (at least 8 samples) for cost and labor saving, the training of specialized biologist that may be the main reason of DNA extraction and amplification being easily contaminated. neuraminidase inhibitors reduce median time to resolution of symptoms by 0.5\u20132.5 days when administered within 48 h of onset of symptoms. neuraminidase inhibitors reduce median time to resolution of symptoms by 0.5\u20132.5 days when administered within 48 h of onset of symptoms. in hospital, it is not uncommon of mix bacterial-viral coinfections. the decision to prescribe antibiotics may be influenced by the lag of diagnosis. in children, empirical antibiotic therapy is almost always initiated in these patients because of their immunocompromised and concerns for severe disease. the reagent and consumable costs for the FilmArray RP and multiple PCR were calculated to be $230 and $40 per patient. however, the filmArray RP is essential for the administration of appropriate antiviral therapy. the reduction in average time to discontinuation of oseltamivir resulted in cost savings of approximately US$34.16 per patient. study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shantou University Medical College.
