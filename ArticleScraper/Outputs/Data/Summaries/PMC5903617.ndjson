{"summary": "87 mutations within the PITX2 gene have been identified, including deletions, insertions, splice-site mutations, and coding region frameshift, nonsense and missense mutations. novel variants cannot be easily classified as either deleterious or neutral, because of their unknown functional and phenotypic consequences. in vitro characterization of novel variants should be undertaken; however, it is often not practicable to experimentally experimentally. bioinformatics prediction methods obtain information on amino acid conservation through alignment with homologous and distantly related sequences. the most common criteria considered in many bioinformatics programs for predicting the functional effect of an amino acid substitution are amino acid sequence conservation across multiple species, physicochemical properties of the amino acids involved, database annotations, and potential protein structural changes. a previous study examined the effect of FOXC1 variants on protein structure and function by combining laboratory experiments and in silico techniques. the results showed that integration of different algorithms with in vitro functional characterization serves as a reliable means of prioritizing, and then functional analyzing, candidate FOXC1 variants [27]. thirty of 31 variants were described as associated with ARS and CAD in the absence of functional analyses on PITX2 structure or function. sixteen SNPs with population allele frequencies > 0.0005 were identified from the gnomAD and the ClinVar.

REVEL tool showed high sensitivity, 94.44% and 87.50%, respectively. predictive value of nsSNPAnalayzer was similar to that of SIFT program. sensitivity and specificity were 66.67% and 43.75% respectively. nsSNPAnalayzer was used to analyze all 18 functionally characterized missense variants. the remaining 12 PITX2 variants were predicted to be disease-associated mutations by all programs. the remaining 12 variants were predicted to be disease-associated mutations by all programs. three functionally characterised variants, N100D, L105V, and N108T, were excluded from these molecular modeling analyses. the molecular modeling identified three mutations as high-risk (L54Q, V83L, and R91P) to change the structure of PITX2, particularly in the H1, H2, and H3 subdomains. the remaining twelve amino acid variants showed no predicted substantially altered pairwise interactions, indicating that these missense variants are predicted to have minor or no impact on PITX2\u2019s structure. the wild-type and mutant-equivalent models were analyzed by the atomic nonlocal environment assessment server. valent models were analyzed by the atomic nonlocal environment assessment (ANOLEA) server. peaks on the scatterplots show the positions of amino acids that changed their pseudoenergy state, as consequence of the mentioned variants. 0.181 -1.20 -0.32 -1 1.0943 10.62 -0.1104 7 T68P -0.359 -0.34 -0.341 -0.361 -0.90 -0.68 0.155 -1.0594 0.38 0.2945 8 R69H -2.369 -0.15 -2.147 -1.56 -1.29 -0.633 -1.3667 8.49 -0.7126 9 T76S -1.35 -0.79 CUPSAT was the most consistent with the results of our molecular modeling, by identifying 5 of 7 destabilizing mutations that were also predicted to be destabilizing by molecular modeling (L54Q, R91P, W86S, and W86C) DUET also showed high consistency with the results of our molecular modeling. iPTREE-STAB detected 2 of 7 destabilizing mutations detected by molecular modeling. MUpro and iStable were unable to identify any of the 7 destabilizing mutations predicted by molecular modeling. silico mutation prediction programs are not a substitute for wet-lab experiments. the predictive value of nsSNPAnalayzer was similar to that of SIFT program. MutPred was the only in silico program that ranked in the top three programs in identifying both pathogenic and benign PITX2 and FOXC1 variants. mutations in protein coding regions are predicted to be caused by altering protein stability [99]. mutations in protein coding regions are predicted to be caused by altering protein stability. new advances in computational prediction of protein stability offer potential insight into this question. the native wild-type residues and the introduced mutant residues are different in both size and charge, likely disturb the local structure of protein. the mutant residues are located within the third helix which is specifically responsible for binding with the major groove of the DNA. the prediction that these mutations impair the capacity of this helix to interact with DNA is consistent with this knowledge. stability predictor methods (DUET, DUET, mCSM, I-mutant3.0, MUpro, iPTREE-STAB, CUPSAT, and iStable) performed weaker, consistent with the results of previous studies. in this study, we evaluated the impact of missense variants on PITX2 stability, structure and function. the 3D model of PITX2 is presented with the protein backbone depicted in black ribbon, the co-crystallized DNA binding target in space-filled green model and the mutants positions in red. the wild-type and mutant-equivalent models were analyzed by the atomic nonlocal environment assessment (ANOLEA) server."}
