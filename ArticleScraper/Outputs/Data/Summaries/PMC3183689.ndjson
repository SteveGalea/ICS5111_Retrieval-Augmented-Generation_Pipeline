{"summary": "human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and the Netherlands human coronavirus (HCoV-NL63) have been isolated from children with respiratory tract infection. the prevalence of these viruses has not been reported from Saudi Arabia. both viruses were found among children with upper and lower respiratory tract diseases during the autumn and winter of 2007 and 2008. hMPV and HCoV-NL63 are difficult to cultivate in tissue culture. for this reason, molecular biology techniques were used. hMPV and HCoV-NL63 are difficult to cultivate in tissue culture. the hMPV and HCoV-NL63 genes did not cross-react with influenza A and B viruses; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) PIV1, PIV2, PIV3; rhinovirus A; or adenovirus. the clinical data were analyzed and were expressed as percentages where applicable. ten (83%) hMPV-positive children had serious medical conditions. most frequent reported conditions included hematologic malignancies and related disorders (6), malignant neoplasm (1), congenital immunodeficiency (1), metabolic disease (1), and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (1). all deaths occurred with a median of 16 days (range, 3-30 days) after the onset of pneumonia. all 4 HCoV-NL63\u2013positive children had underlying medical conditions. two of them had cystic fibrosis, one patient had Sweet syndrome, and one patient had asthma. hematologic malignancies and related disorders (6), malignant neoplasm (1), congenital immunodeficiency (1), metabolic disease (1), and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (1). the most frequent reported conditions included cough in 12 (100%) children, shortness of breath in 10 (86%), fever in 9 (75%), nasal congestion in 8 (66%), wheezing in 3 (25%) children. all deaths occurred with a median of 16 days (range, 3-30 days) after the onset of pneumonia. all 4 HCoV-NL63\u2013positive children had underlying medical conditions. two of them had cystic fibrosis, one patient had Sweet syndrome and 1 patient had asthma. clinical signs and symptoms at disease onset included cough in 12 (100%) children, shortness of breath in 10 (86%), fever in 9 (75%), nasal congestion in 8 (66%), wheezing in 3 (25%) children. 7 (86%) patients required admission to intensive care unit; all had underlying medical conditions. mixed viral infections, including hMPV, occurred in 3 patients. all 4 HCoV-NL63\u2013positive children had underlying medical conditions. two of them had cystic fibrosis, 1 patient had Sweet syndrome, and 1 patient had asthma. clinical diagnosis included pneumonia in 2 and viral pneumonia causing chronic lung disease exacerbation in 2 patients. hMPV-associated disease in hematologic malignancy and related disorders was characterized by several respiratory symptoms, including fever, nasal congestion, cough, and shortness of breath. seven patients developed rapidly progressive respiratory failure associated with pneumonia and culture-negative shock. three immunocompromised patients with idiopathic pneumonia died despite aggressive therapy. viruses on the health care system in Saudi Arabia."}
