{"summary": "RABV is present on all continents except for Antarctica. an estimated 55,000 human deaths occur annually mostly in developing countries. RABV is a member of the Lyssavirus genus, family Rhabdoviridae. striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) serve as the most frequent source of terrestrial rabies cases in California [10] rabies in striped skunks was first documented in California in 1899 and skunk rabies has been considered enzootic since the 1950s. in 2009, only 2 skunks were reported rabid in Humboldt County suggesting that rabies infections in foxes had fundamentally shifted the apparent sustained fox-to-fox transmission in this outbreak suggests that CST occurred and enabled this epizootic. we hypothesized that molecular changes in the viral genome would be associated with this event. the VRDL genotypes rabies-positive samples received from local public health laboratories by RT-PCR and performs sequence analysis on RT-PCR products. Approximately 1 gram of brain tissue from foxes and skunks infected with the California skunk rabies virus variant were placed in TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) primer candidate regions included both perfectly conserved regions and degenerate regions. final checks were performed which helped avoid hybridization problems. RT-PCR, cloning, and sequencing Reverse transcription was performed using random hexamers and the Superscript III RT reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) all rabies reads were initially mapped to geneBank rabies reference sequence GI:260063801. this reference sequence was used as the common coordinate system for comparing samples and identifying coding frames. no noticeable increase in error rates were observed by introducing random mutations at 9 of the control reference sequence. consensus base calls between 454 and Illumina were resolved either by taking the base call with far superior coverage or omitting the base call from data analysis entirely. the final consensus sequences of the data sets contain no disagreement and can be considered accurate with high confidence. rare variant detection To differentiate rare variants from sequencing errors, methodologies were developed to measure and control for sequencing and PCR errors. RT-PCR uses forward primer 1066 deg \u2032\u20325-GARAGAAGATTCTTCAGRGA-3 and reverse primer 304. 1 gram of brain tissue from foxes and skunks infected with the California skunk rabies virus variant was placed in TRIzol LS Reagent. RNA was extracted from the tissue sample following the manufacturers protocol. individual primer pairs were selected which provided overlapping coverage of the DNA being sequenced. RT-PCR, cloning, and sequencing Reverse transcription was performed using random hexamers and the Superscript III RT reverse transcriptase kit. rabies virus cDNA templates were amplified using the Phusion polymerase kit. this newly sequenced rabies virus genome could differ by approximately 9 relative to our selected previously sequenced reference fox rabies sequence. no noticeable increase in error rates were observed. the binomial error model defines the expected number of non consensus bases that should occur given the assumed PCR and sequencing error rate for a given number of observed reads. consensus base calls between 454 and Illumina were resolved either by taking the base call with far superior coverage or omitting the base call from data analysis entirely. the final consensus sequences of the two data sets contain no disagreement and can be considered accurate with high confidence. rare variant detection Methods were developed to differentiate rare variants from sequencing errors. the analysis involved 32 nucleotide sequences. all positions with less than 95% site coverage were eliminated. a total of 3979 positions were eliminated. 243 positions contained more than one consensus nucleotide across the samples. these positions occurred in all five genes of the rabies genome. intergenic regions tended have higher rates of consensus-level mutations compared to the 5 genes. gene amino acid no. 1995 1995 1996 2003 2007 20073 2008 2009 2009/10 2009 2000 Sk2 Fx23 Fx24 Fx31 Fx33 Sk3 Sk1 South Humboldt North Humboldt Sk5 Fx27 Fortuna Ferndale na Fortuna Eureka Eureka Arcata Redway N AA 80 1 308 nd F F L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L no sequence data was obtained for the first 76 amino acids of the N gene. samples from south Humboldt County include those from Hydesville, Fortuna, Loleta, and Eureka. the samples from 2000 differed from the 199596 at two sites, R86K and E156G, and from the outbreak samples at amino acid 30 with an R at this site rather than a K. Phylogenetic analysis grouped samples according to collection date and geography. the exceptions were Fx44 from mid Eureka and Fx34 from just east of Eureka. the samples collected in year 2000 grouped together and distant from all other samples. the evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method. data from all samples had the best match to CA982 (CA skunk from 1994, accession no. JQ685894) with all samples 97 similar except for the sample from 2000, which was 98 similar to CA982. change in frequency of rare variants in intrahost viral populations Deep-sequencing data indicated that CST likely occurred prior to 2003 since several nonsynonymous mutations present in the consensus sequences of skunk and fox rabies samples obtained from asterisks indicate samples where only 454 data were available. dark green entries (1e-5) correspond to haplotype frequency of zero. mutations in consensus sequence could result from selection for de novo mutations. the historical haplotypes at genome position 4596 (G at AA428) in the G protein may be linked to genome positions 2958 (I at AA155) in M and 9841 (G at AA1478) in L. these 3 loci are too far apart for linkage verification by the short read sequencing method. these 3 loci are too far apart for linkage verification. samples of individuals from relatively early in the outbreak increased likelihood to have the 1995 consensus haplotype detected as a sub-consensus mutation. some amino acid inversion sites were also associated with other parameters such as geographic location. 14 samples are known to have come from southern regions of the outbreak and 19 samples are known to have come from northern regions. multiple mutations resulting in a premature stop codon were observed in the deep sequencing data from this study. at five genome locations, both 454 and Illumina detected stop codon mutations occurring in the same samples at comparable frequencies. these five positions are 1418 in Fx4, 2790 in Fx23 (1), 2976 in Fx23 (1), 5860 in Fx45 (1), and 8470 in Fx48 (1). 58 of these one-percent variants occur at loci with consensus-level mutations. 243 positions contained more than one consensus nucleotide across the samples. intergenic regions tended have higher rates of consensus-level mutations compared to the 5 genes. 243 loci were found to contain consensus-level mutations. Across samples collected between 20092010, 57 loci were found to contain consensus-level mutations. samples from south Humboldt County include those from Hydesville, Fortuna, Loleta, and Eureka. samples from northhumboldt include those from arcata, fortuna, loleta, and eureka. samples from northhumboldt include those from northhumboldt county. no sequence data was obtained for the first 76 amino acids of the N gene. 2 Hydesville and Fortuna samples have S residue at this site. 3 Fx 32 has an E residue at this site. four amino acid changes in the G protein L12Q, D427G, P485L, and S501P characterized samples obtained from the southern region versus from the northern region. the exceptions were Fx44 from mid Eureka and Fx34 from just east of Eureka, which consistently grouped with the Arcata samples. gene amino acid no. 1995 1995 1996 2003 2007 20073 2008 2009/10 2009 2000 Sk2 Fx23 Fx24 Fx31 Fx33 Sk3 Sk1 South Humboldt Sk5 Fx27 Fortuna Ferndale na Fortuna Eureka Eureka Eureka Arcata Redway N AA 80 1 308 nd F F L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L L the samples from 2000 differed from the 199596 at two sites, R86K and E156G, and from the outbreak samples at amino acid 30 with an R at this site rather than a K.

indicated that CST likely occurred prior to 2003 since several nonsynonymous mutations present in the consensus sequences of skunk and fox rabies samples obtained from black entries denote samples that contained a third haplotype. white entries denote missing samples. sample ID ordered from early to late collection date. asterisks indicate samples where only 454 data were available. historical haplotypes went from being dominant (98100 presence) in the historical samples to low level variants (0.051.95) in most of the outbreak samples and even completely disappeared in seven of the outbreak samples. these data highlight the dynamic evolution of the rabies genome over time. samples of individuals from relatively early in the outbreak increased likelihood to have the 1995 consensus haplotype detected as a sub-consensus mutation. some amino acid inversion sites were also associated with other parameters such as geographic location. 14 samples are known to have come from southern regions of the outbreak and 19 samples are known to have come from northern regions. multiple mutations resulting in a premature stop codon were observed in the deep sequencing data from this study. at five genome locations, both 454 and Illumina detected stop codon mutations occurring in the same samples at comparable frequencies. these pre-mature stop codons identified by both 454 and Illumina strongly support the presence of defective genomes. there are 248 loci with such high occurrence/frequency variants (one-percent variants, Figure S9) 58 of these one-percent variants occur at loci with consensus-level mutations. changes in frequency of rare variants in intrahost viral populations Deep-sequencing data indicated that CST likely occurred prior to 2003. black entries denote samples that contained a third haplotype. white entries denote missing samples. asterisks indicate samples where only 454 data were available. the historical haplotypes rose from being dominant (98100

evolution of the rabies genome over time. inversion sites were slightly but significantly higher than that of sub-consensus variants at non-inversion sites. the difference fell short of statistical significance (p = 0.08) some amino acid inversion sites were also associated with other parameters such as geographic location. 14 samples are known to have come from southern regions of the outbreak. multiple mutations resulting in a premature stop codon were observed in the deep sequencing data from this study. 116 stop codon mutations were detected across all samples in the 454 and Illumina data respectively, at the mean frequencies of 0.50 and 0.14. there are 248 loci with such high occurrence/frequency variants. their distribution across the coding and non-coding regions of the rabies genome is very similar to that of the 243 mutations occurring at the consensus level. no genetic changes viral sequence differentiated the skunks and the foxes from the epizootic. the rabies genotype from the donor species (bats) could not be differentiated from that found in the recipient species (skunks or foxes) the CDPH collected 24 rabid fox samples from the city of Arcata from October 2008 to January 2010. however, only 4 rabid fox samples from Eureka during this time period. the collection of 1 skunk to 4 fox samples seen in Eureka is not exceptional there was 1 skunk sample and 4 fox samples collected in 2007. both consensus and deep-sequencing data indicate that the haplotype associated with sustained fox-to-fox transmission occurred prior to 2009. variants that were later enriched to become consensus could be detected at higher frequencies than variants that did not. analysis of the ultra-deep sequencing data supported the hypothesis that variants that were later enriched to become consensus could be detected at higher frequencies. the redundant sequencing means reads with base calls that disagree with their overlapping pair are recognized as errors and are discarded to effectively lower the sequencing error rate. a position specific base call supported by a read pair can still disagree with the consensus base call leading to detection of rare variants. the tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. the analysis involved 44 amino acid sequences. the coding data was translated assuming a Standard genetic code table. the evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method as described for Fig. S3. the analysis involved 38 amino acid sequences. the coding data was translated assuming a Standard genetic code table. colored lines on the bottom indicate genomic regions. only those variants (N = 248) that occurred at above 1% either in one sample or have a cumulative frequency >1% over all samples are included."}
