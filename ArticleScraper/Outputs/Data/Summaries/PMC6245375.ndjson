{"summary": "HCAIs are infections that first appear 48 hours or more after hospitalization or within 30 days after having received health care. 1.7 million hospitalized patients annually acquire HCAIs while being treated for other health issues. more than 98,000 of these patients die due to HCAIs. the idea that medicine could cause harm is described as \"unintended physical injury resulting from or contributed to by medical care, including... [its] absence... that requires additional monitoring, treatment or hospitalization, or... results in death\" in this century, the idea that medicine could cause harm is described as \"unintended physical injury resulting from or contributed to by medical care, including... [its] absence... that requires additional monitoring, treatment or hospitalization, or... results in death\" the germ theory of disease and Semmelweis's theory of transmission of disease were dismissed by most of the medical establishment because of a lack of appropriate statistical analysis of the data. for every 20 patients hospitalized, at least one acquired an HCAI with the most common microorganism being Clostridium difficile. in Greece, the HCAI prevalence rate was 9.1%. the most common microorganisms were P. aeruginosa, the Klebsiella species, and Acinetobacter baumannii. the highest number (23) of pathogens were isolated from door handles. the most common was S. aureus at 14.42% and 45.2% of the total bacterial isolates comprised Bacillus subtilis. most of the HCAIs in the US are triggered by the ESKAPE group. strains of Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, and K. pneumoniae49 are more effective in laboratory experiments against A. baumannii than gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin. HCAIs are due to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. 16%\u201320% include multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes: MRSA, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, E. coli, Enterobacter species, and A. baumannii. over 80% of the Klebsiella spp. community were resistant to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, piperacillin, tazobactam, and imipenem. ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, piperacillin, tazobactam, and imipenem showed 48.6% resistance. oxytoca, E. coli, Enterobacter species, and A. baumannii have a much higher rate (20%\u201340%) of resistance than others45. the organisms isolated from device-associated HCAIs have the highest antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. Citrobacter spp.-related HCAIs are a relatively minor proportion. they also show resistance toward cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. only 30% of the HCAI isolated were susceptible. a study conducted in Taiwan reported the occurrence of CLABSIs as 3.93 per 1,000 central-catheter days. the most common causative pathogens were Gram-negative (39.2%), Gram-positive (33.2%), and Candida spp. microorganisms (27.6%). 69\u201371,78 HCAIs are common following cardiac surgery, with a reported incidence rate of between 5.0% and 21.7%,79,80 often accompanied with multiple organ failure and prolonged hospital stays. the three most common locations for HCAIs after cardiac surgery are lungs, central venous catheters, and surgical sites. SSIs comprise at least 14%\u201322.2% of all HCAIs for abdominal surgery88\u201390. microorganisms generally involved in such SSIs include S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci and Enterococcus spp. in colorectal surgery, the SSI rate in the sutureless, Vicryl, and silk groups was 14.8%, 14.8%, and 16.4%,88 respectively. the incidence of deeper SSIs in the Vicryl group was statistically significantly lower than that in the silk group. patients aged over 60 years, lower functional status, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, immunocompromising disease, immunosuppressive agents, impaired immune system, open cholecystectomy, laparotomy, an American Society of Anesthesiologists score above 2, drain insertion, and dirty wound.99. SSIs.99 are the most common HCAIs and one of the top ranking microbial infections, representing around 40% of HCAIs. 106\u2013108 The biofilm defends microbes from both antimicrobials and host defense mechanisms. fever from CAUTIs is common with a frequency fluctuating from one per 100 to one per 1,000 catheter days. patients in institutional care with long-term indwelling catheters have a greater risk for the presence of pathogenic microorganisms. around 86% of HCAIs are associated with motorized automatic ventilation and VAP. around 86% of HCAIs are associated with motorized automatic ventilation and VAP. the incidence of non-fermenters\u2019 resistance continued to be very high except for amikacin and imipenem (33.1%) and polymyxin-B (2.4%). the incidence of non-fermenters\u2019 resistance continued to be very high except for amikacin and imipenem. LRTIOP was the principal invading microorganism for both pneumonia and LRTIOP. in 2009, 25,000 fewer CLABSIs occurred in the ICUs of US hospitals than in 2001, a 58% reduction. the cost of reducing such infections is very high. a study conducted in Taiwan reported the occurrence of CLABSIs as 3.93 per 1,000 central-catheter days. the most common causative pathogens were Gram-negative (39.2%), Gram-positive (33.2%), and Candida spp. microorganisms (27.6%). Approximately 25% of patients with SSIs develop severe sepsis and shock and are moved to an ICU.65 SSIs cause statistically significant morbidity, mortality, and financial burden for individuals and communities. 68.6% of all bacterial isolates were resistant to cefuroxime used in the management of orthopedic SSIs. diabetes mellitus, smoking, operations lasting more than 3 hours, the absence of antibiotic prophylaxis, and a history of previous surgery were positive risk factors. the incidence of SSIs was higher in the absorbable stitching material than the silk group for all surgical procedures. in colorectal surgery, the SSI rates in the sutureless, Vicryl, and silk groups were 4.8%, 14.8%, and 16.4%,88 respectively. a study utilizing univariate analysis defined 13 statistically significantly variables related to SSIs. those were patients aged over 60 years, lower functional status, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, immunocompromising disease, anticancer medications, immunosuppressive agents, impaired immune system, open cholecystectomy, laparotomy, an American Society of Anesthesiologists score above 2, drain insertion, and dirty wound.99. a wide spectrum of other microorganisms were identified, including eukaryotic fungus. 106\u2013108 The biofilm defends microbes from both antimicrobials and host defense mechanisms. fever from CAUTIs is common in patients with long-term indwelling catheters. 111 HCAUTIs very rarely cause death (HR =0.71; 95% CI =0.66\u20130.75), especially in large hospitals when compared with age and sex. elderly patients more often died (HR =1.40; 95% CI =1.38\u20131.43) non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli127 were the predominant organisms, followed by Pseudomonas and Klebsiella genus. in this study, S. aureus reduced in prevalence from 50% to 34.9% between 2011 and 2013, but between 2012 and 2013 vancomycin-resistant Enterococci increased from 4.3% to 8.3%. a study of HCAIs connected with respiratory infection found a prevalence rate of 7.59%. 15.7% were pneumonia, and 7% were lower respiratory tract infections. LRTIOP was the principal invading microorganism for both pneumonia and. pneumonia. the annual costs for HCAIs alone in the USA are between US$28 and US$45 billion. but with even this amount of spending, 90,000 lives are lost per year: HCAIs are among the top five killers in the USA. 156\u2013167 Instigating best practice stems from a response to factors outside a purely scientific understanding of infection and not simply understood as a deficit in knowledge. an educational intervention involving 4,345 health professionals in three public hospitals in the u.s. successfully improved hand hygiene immensely with the use of alcohol hand rub. adenovirus and rhinovirus, and tubercular bacilli176 are easily dispersed through droplets (particles 5 m in size) in closed health care settings and often cause endemics and epidemics. poor cleaning of hospital surfaces is therefore vital to maintain standards and reduce the risk of HCAIs. HCAIs remain one of the biggest causes of death in most countries. it is essential that strategic, policy, and education initiatives continue to focus on managing and controlling such infections."}
