{"summary": "WNV is a positive-stranded, enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family. the virus is transmitted by arthropod vectors and includes members that cause encephalitis or systemic and/or visceral disease. the virus can invade the central nervous system (CNS) and cause flaccid paralysis, meningitis, or encephalitis, often leading to long-term neurological sequelae or death. innate immune response must balance the need to restrict virus infection. neurons derived from the cerebral cortex are more permissive of infection by multiple viruses. granule cell neurons (GCN) derived from the cerebellum are less permissive of viral infection at the baseline state. IFI6-16 is an IFI27 human gene family member that inhibits infection of YFV, WNV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) but that does not have an apparent ortholog in mice. some Ifi27 gene orthologs (e.g., ISG12a) promote apoptosis and cell death (21, 31, 32) arrow-derived macrophages (M) supported higher levels of WNV infection. increased viral burden in the cerebellum and brain stem of Ifi27l2a/ mice. mice produced normal litter sizes of expected Mendelian ratios. studies were performed on sex- and age-matched mice between 11 and 12 weeks of age. murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were generated from embryonic day 14 WT and Ifi27l2a/ mice. Embryos were decapitated, livers were removed, and the remaining minced tissue was digested in 0.25% trypsin for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 20% HI-FBS, 1% HEPES CN were prepared from the cerebral cortex of embryonic day 15 WT and Ifi27l2a/ mice. Tissues were dissociated at 37\u00b0C in 1 ml 0.25% (wt/vol) trypsin\u20130.25 mg DNase I (Sigma)\u2013HBSS for 20 min. CN cells were cultured in the same medium as the CN. the purity of cultured neuron populations was defined by immunofluorescence microscopy analysis after incubating with antibodies to S100- (Abcam 52642) (1:200 dilution), NeuN (Milipore MAB377B) (1:100 dilution) to identify astrocytes, neurons, and microglia. cells were washed, fixed, permeabilized, and stained for granzyme B (Invitrogen; GB11) and the allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated NS4B peptide (SSVWNATTAI) tetramer (NIH Tetramer Facility [Atlanta, GA]) monocytes in blood included circulating CD115+ F4/80+ Gr-1lo monocytes that likely do not become resident within tissues CNS cells were strained with a 70-m-pore-size filter and subjected to Percoll gradient (30% [vol/vol]) purification (1,200 g, 30 min) cells were stained for CD8 (1:100 dilution), CD11b (1:100 dilution), CD19 (1:100 dilution), and CD45 (1:100 dilution) dilution endpoint titers were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against purified WNV E protein. brain tissue was harvested from mice 9 days after subcutaneous WNV infection. DAPI, Alexa Fluor 488, and TMR red were detected with the respected wavelength channels 415 to 470 nm, 491 to 553 nm, and 553 to 624 nm. qRT-PCR was performed as previously described for WNV, Oas1a, and Ifit1 mRNA. qRT-PCR data from comparisons between three or more groups were analyzed by Student's t test. serum cytokine levels were analyzed by Student's t test. viral titers were analyzed by Student's t test. a WNV-New York (WNV-NY) stock was generated in C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells (ATCC) from a single passage of strain 3000.0259 isolated from a mosquito in new york in 2000 (36). the WNV Madagascar strain (WNV-MAD) stock was generated by passaging virus in vero or C6/36 cells as described previously (37). intracranial infection was performed by injecting 101 PFU of WNV-NY or WNV-MAD in a solution of 10 l HBSS supplemented with 1% HI-FBS. brain and spinal cord tissues were collected at 3 and 5 days and processed as described for tissues from peripheral infection. DMEM supplemented with 20% HI-FBS, 1% HEPES, 1% GlutaMAX (Life Technologies), 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco) cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. a subset of cells was pretreated with 5 U/ml of mouse IFN- (PBL Assay Science) CN cells were cultured in the same medium as the CN with the addition of 40 mM KCl. these cells were cultured in the same medium as the CN with the addition of 40 mM KCl. secondary Alexa Fluor 488 or 555-conjugated dyes (Invitrogen) (1:400 dilution) were used for detection. samples were imaged with a Nuance FX multiplex biomarker imaging system (PerkinElmer) blood monocytes were detected after staining with gr-1 (BioLegend; RB6-8C5) (1:100 dilution), CD115 (eBioscience; AFS98) (1:100 dilution), and F4/80 (Serotec; CI:A3-1) (1:100 dilution) monocytes in blood included circulating CD115+ F4/80+ Gr-1lo monocytes that likely do not become resident within tissues. samples were processed on an LSR Fortessa flow cytometer and analyzed with FlowJo commercial software (Tree-Star) Neutrophils (CD11bhigh CD45high) and microglial (CD11bhigh CD45low) populations were identified by their unique high-side-scatter profile. mice were perfused with 30 ml PBS, half of the brain was retained for viral titer analysis. the other half was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)\u2013PBS overnight. dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed with a Roche in situ cell death detection kit using TMR red. the image, approximately 637.64 m by 637.64 m, was composed by automated tiling of 9 panels (Zeiss Zen) the central panel was selected for TUNEL-positive cells in each animal. qRT-PCR was performed as previously described for WNV, Oas1a, and Ifit1 mRNA. all data were analyzed with Prism software (GraphPad Prism, San Diego, CA) qRT-PCR data from comparisons between three or more groups were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD) post hoc analysis. qRT-PCR data from comparisons between two groups were analyzed by Student's t test. basal Ifi27l2a mRNA expression was observed in lymph node, heart, lung, and testes. mRNA expression was induced in the brain and spinal cord. at 4 and 8 days postinfection, Ifi27l2a mRNA expression was enhanced in the brain and spinal cord. Ifi27l2a mRNA was measured in brain, spinal cord, spleen, and lymph node. mRNA was normalized to the gene by qRT-PCR. 2a/ Absolute no.

WT (n = 39) and Ifi27l2a/ (n = 34) mice used for survival curve determinations. at all time points tested, levels of viral burden in the spleen of WT and Ifi27l2a/ mice were similar. a deficiency in Ifi27l2a did not result in productive infection of the kidney. however, within the CNS at day 8 after infection, the WNV-NY burden increased in the brain (2.4-fold increase, P 0.05) and spinal cord (170-fold increase, P 0.005) of Ifi27l2a/ mice. Ifi27l2a/ mice exhibited higher viral titers in the brain stem and cerebellum. we postulated that Ifi27l2a might protect specific regions when virus was administered directly into the CNS. Ifi27l2a does not alter adaptive cellular or humoral immune responses during acute WNV infection. we examined whether an absence of Ifi27l2a influenced the development of adaptive immunity during acute WNV infection. the results are presented as percentages (B) or total numbers (C) of cells per milliliter of blood from WT and Ifi27l2a/ mice. bars indicate mean values of the results from three independent experiments for 8 to 9 mice. deficiency of Ifi27l2a did not affect priming, recruitment, or activation of antigen-specific or innate immune cells in the CNS of WNV-infected mice. T cells were identified by inclusion of CD19 and CD3+ cells. CD8+ cells were additionally analyzed as granzyme B+- and WNV-specific NS4B tetramer+ cells. brains were analyzed for numbers of macrophages (CD45high CD11b+) and microglia (CD45low and CD11b+) the percentages and numbers of macrophages and microglia from WT and Ifi27l2a/ mice were similar. data are plotted as the log10 endpoint neutralization titer or log10 50% focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT50) values. populations of TFH cells (PD1+ and CXCR5+) (D) and GC B cells (Fas+ and GL7+) (E) were identified in the DLN at 8 days post-WNV-NY infection. oactive cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-], IL-1, and IL-6) can alter the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and affect transit of WNV into the brain parenchyma and early replication. we measured whether a deficiency of Ifi27l2a affected systemic production of cytokines and chemokines at 4 or 6 days after WNV-NY infection. 4.7 4.6 0.8 5.4 1.3 4.7 0.0 IL-1 32.95 182.2* 88.2 60.1* 44.0 53.2 43.6 78.9 145.8 IL-2 2.92 19.4 8.6 27.0 10.4 19.1 14.2 16.3 10.6 IL-3 1.32 4.7 2.6 2.8 1.4 2.9 1.0 1.9 1.2 IL-4 6.11 7.2 2.0 5.7 1.2 5.3 1.6 5.7 4.6 IL-5 1.76 91.8 1.3 9.8 2.0 8.6 2.4 MIP-1 6.81 41.1 38.8 24.4 8.7 15.5 10.6 17.1 14.7 RANTES 0.81 34.6 8.1 32.5 12.6 33.8 10.9 37.4 15.4 TNF- 3.01 148.2 110.4 97.7 27.5 98.6 33.5 82.9 21.5 a Cytokine levels were assayed via Bioplex Pro to determine differences between WT and Ifi27l2a/ mice. DCs and primary MEFs from WT and Ifi27l2a/ mice were either pretreated with IFN- or not treated and were then infected at a low MOI with WNV-NY. however, we observed no difference in levels of viral infection at any time point in DC or MEF cultures generated from WT and Ifi27l2a/ mice. virologic phenotype occurred in selected brain regions of Ifi27l2a/ mice. we prepared primary neurons from the cerebral cortex (CN) and cerebellum (GCN) of WT and Ifi27l2a/ mice. we measured viral growth kinetics after infection with WNV-NY. we treated cells with known ISG inducers [IFN-, poly(IC), WNV-NY, and WNV-MAD] and assessed expression of Oas1a and Ifit1 mRNA. deficiency of Ifi27l2a did not broadly impact expression of other antiviral ISGs. t test for each treatment group was analyzed by Student's t test. for high-throughput imaging, three wells per treatment group were analyzed. for each well, 60 computer-randomized images were collected and analyzed. i27l2a/ mice had equivalent WNV titers in the brain at 9 days after infection. brains of selected mice with similar levels of virus were sectioned and stained. a deficiency of Ifi27l2a increases susceptibility to WNV infection. basal Ifi27l2a mRNA expression was observed in lymph node, heart, lung, and testes. after infection, mRNA expression was induced in the brain and spinal cord. Ifi27l2a gene deletion was verified by PCR. gene deletion was confirmed by presence of a 408-bp band (KO), whereas WT Ifi27l2a manifested as a 612-bp band. bars represent means standard errors of the means (SEM).

Percent Absolute no. the percentages of the indicated populations were calculated as proportions of the total parent populations. we next infected WT and Ifi27l2a/ congenic mice with a pathogenic isolate of WNV (strain 3000.0259; WNV-NY). Ifi27l2a/ mice showed a decreased survival rate compared to WT animals. survival analysis of 11-to-12-week-old WT or Ifi27l2a/ mice was used for survival curve determinations. viral burden was examined at different days (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 14) in serum, peripheral organs (spleen and kidney) levels of WNV viremia in WT and Ifi27l2a/ mice were also similar. a deficiency in Ifi27l2a did not result in productive infection of the kidney. higher levels of infection were observed in the cerebellum and brain stem of Ifi27l2a/ mice. this suggests that Ifi27l2a may protect specific regions when virus was administered directly into the CNS. data points represent individual mice. bars indicate median values obtained with 4 to 10 mice per time point per tissue. ifi27l2a does not alter adaptive cellular or humoral immune responses during acute WNV infection. specific monocyte populations of Gr-1high and Gr-1low cells were phenotyped according to prior studies. the results are presented as percentages (B) or total numbers (C) of cells per milliliter of blood from WT and Ifi27l2a/ mice. bars indicate mean values of the results from three independent experiments for each genotype. we also observed no differences in the percentage or numbers of activated microglia (CD11bhigh CD45low) or M (CD11bhigh CD45high) in the brains of WT and Ifi27l2a/ mice after WNV-NY infection. a deficiency of Ifi27l2a did not affect priming, recruitment, or activation of antigen-specific or innate immune cells in the CNS of WNV-infected mice. the percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as of NS4B-specific cells, from WT and Ifi27l2a/ mice were similar. no difference in absolute numbers of infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ cells or in the WNV specificities of CD8+ T cells was observed. mice, and IgG levels (A) or IgM levels (B) were determined by a focus-reduction assay from serum at day 8. results are shown as a scatter plot and represent samples from 7 to 10 mice per group. a deficiency in Ifi27l2a did not appear to alter the germinal center response within the DLN. we measured whether a deficiency of Ifi27l2a affected systemic production of cytokines and chemokines at 4 or 6 days after WNV-NY infection. we measured whether this small variation in cytokine expression levels in serum impacted BBB permeability and virus entry into the CNS. subcutaneous inoculation of WNVa Cytokine LOD (U/ml) Level (U/ml) 4 dpi 6 dpi WT Ifi27l2a/ WT Ifi27l2a/ Mean SD Mean SD Mean SD Mean SD IL-1 4.66 6.4 4.7 4.6 0.8 5.4 1.3 4.7 0.0 IL-1 32.95 182.2* 88.2 60.1* 44.0 53.2 43.6 78.9 IFN- 1.55 5.7 1.6 4.6 1.5 3.9 1.9 1.3 KC 1.43 97.1 48.0 120.6 44.4 66.2 35.9 67.1 35.3 MCP-1 15.39 156.3 54.0 147.5 20.1 130.7 46.6 110.7 39.3 MIP-1 1.76 11.2 2.6 10.9 1.3 9.8 2.0 8.6 2.4 MIP-1 6.81 41.1 38.8 24.4 8.7 15.5 10.6 17.1 14.7 RANTES 0.81 34.6 8.1 3 l2a is expressed after WNV infection in primary and secondary lymphoid tissues. we speculated that the antiviral effect of Ifi27l2a against WNV infection might not occur in nonneuronal cell types. cells were either pretreated with IFN- or not treated. the data were analyzed by a Student's t test for each time point. they are expressed as the log10 median titers SEM as reflects pooled data from 3 to 4 independent experiments performed with three technical replicates per independent experiment. subsets of primary neurons from Ifi27l2a/ mice exhibit enhanced WNV infection. infected GCN was observed in Ifi27l2a/ than in WT GCN. we examined whether a deficiency of Ifi27l2a altered the general ISG response in GCN. we treated cells with known ISG inducers. WT and Ifi27l2a/ GCN were analyzed by qRT-PCR. the levels of viral antigen in the CNS were at the threshold of detection, with only sporadic staining of infected. we evaluated neuronal cell death in WT and Ifi27l2a/ mice that had equivalent WNV titers in the brain at 9 days after infection. we noted significantly more cell death in the cerebellum (5-fold, P 0.05) and brain stem (4-fold, P 0.005), whereas TUNEL-positive neurons were mostly absent in the hindbrain regions of Ifi27l2a/ mice. ectopic expression of Ifi27l2a in CN reduced WNV infection. small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing in GCN resulted in enhanced viral replication. Ifi27l2a was identified as an upregulated ISG in lung tissue following IAV infection (63), ifi27l2a/ mice did not sustain higher levels of viral burden or altered pathology in the lungs of infected animals. IFI27 family members appear to have proapoptotic effects (21, 32, 34, 65, 66), possibly as a result of stabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and regulation of caspase activity (21, 65, 66). ectopic expression of IFI6-16 has been shown to suppress infection of YFV (69) the predominant effect of Ifi27l2a in the CNS suggests a specialization of the host antiviral immune response. in ifit2/ mice, higher WNV and VSV titers were observed in the olfactory bulb, brain stem, and cerebellum (13, 70) Ifi27l2a may have a discrete antiviral activity within selected regions of the CNS."}
