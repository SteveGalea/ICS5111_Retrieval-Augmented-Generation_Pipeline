{"summary": "clinical symptoms are often nonspecific and classical diagnosis is poor (2). serological tests that detect galactomannan (GM) and -d-glucan have low positive predictive values (PPVs), better used for the exclusion rather than the diagnosis of IA. GM and PCR were positive in 4/4 patients with probable IA, generating a sensitivity of 100%. PCR was positive in 2/22 samples, whereas no positive GM ELISA occurred in these cases. patients with possible IA (n = 2) 0/2 (0) 2/2 (100) 0/2 (0) Unclassified patients with no specific radiological signs of IA (n = 33) 4/33 (12) 14/33 (42) 0/33 (0) Children with unclassified IA receiving anti-Aspergillus prophylaxis or empirical therapy (n = 28) 8/28 (29%) had positive GM or PCR assay results. pergillus-active prophylaxis or empirical therapy on biomarker assay positivity testing in unclassified patients was investigated. 8 of 28 patients had positive test results outside their treatment or prophylaxis period, resulting in a doubling in the percentage of positive test results. this lower incidence of positive biomarkers during antifungal prophylaxis or empirical therapy might indicate a positive clinical effect of antifungal therapy. out of 16 positive Aspergillus PCR events, 6 were truly positive and 10 were false positive (PPV, 37.5%). the GM assay failed to detect 2 out of 6 positive CT scans (sensitivity, 66.7%). the GM ELISA was positive in 4/6 CT-positive patients. a mean of 9.5 GM samples (range, 6 to 14 samples; mean optical density [OD], 3.1) and 6.8 PCR samples (range, 3 to 14 samples) showed positive results. binary and continuous covariates were analyzed using a time-to-event approach. time-event variables included the day of binary Aspergillus PCR status change. a 12-year-old boy with refractory acute myeloid leukemia was referred to our center for ALL immunotherapy. he developed de novo IA during aplasia but recovered. he died from further disease progression but without clinical signs of IA. all GM/PCR tests remained continuously positive with increasing values. GM and PCR were positive in 4/4 patients with probable IA, generating a sensitivity of 100%. PCR was positive in 2/22 samples, whereas no positive GM ELISA occurred in these cases. no. of patients positive for indicated assay/total no. (%)b GM PCR GM and PCR Patients with probable IA (n = 2) 0/2 (0) 2/2 (100) 0/2 (0) Unclassified patients with no specific radiological signs of IA (n = 33) 4/33 (12) 14/33 (42) 0/33 (0) Children with unclassified IA receiving anti-Aspergillus prophylaxis or empirical therapy (n = 28) 8 for the PCR assay increased to 35%. the effect of antifungal therapy on biomarker assay performance was investigated. 8 of 28 patients had positive test results outside their treatment or prophylaxis period. out of 16 positive Aspergillus PCR events, 6 were truly positive and 10 were false positive (PPV, 37.5%). the GM assay failed to detect 2 out of 6 positive CT scans (sensitivity, 66.7%). the GM ELISA was positive in 4/6 CT-positive patients (sensitivity, 67%) and in 3/27 CT-negative patients (specificity = 89%) a GM cut-point of 0.4 corresponds to a sensitivity of 55% and a specificity of 95%. a mean of 9.5 GM samples (range, 6 to 14 samples; mean optical density [OD], 3.1) and 6.8 PCR samples (range, 3 to 14 samples) showed positive results. binary and continuous covariates were analyzed using a time-to-event approach. a 12-year-old boy with refractory acute myeloid leukemia was referred to our center for ALL immunotherapy. he developed de novo IA during aplasia but recovered. he died from further disease progression but without clinical signs of IA. all GM/PCR tests remained continuously positive with increasing values. pulmonary IA was confirmed by double-positive GM and PCR tests as well as radiologically by the presence of diffuse nodules up to 2.3 cm in diameter in both lungs. this patient ultimately died from IA, prior to alloHSCT. authors concluded that the value of PCR in pediatric patients has not yet been defined and that a large variety of assay protocols exist. previous studies relied on nested-PCR assays (15, 16), did not include any cases of probable IA (16, 17), and used extremely small blood volumes (17, 18) authors found high sensitivities of up to 96% (19) and/or high NPVs of up to 100% (17, 19) PCR screening is of limited value in patients receiving mold prophylaxis. 72% (53/73 patients) receiving antifungal prophylaxis generating a potentially false-positive PCR result, compared to only 14% in this pediatric cohort. however, we hypothesize that subclinical Aspergillus infections might be less frequent than those in adults. despite antifungal prophylaxis, 4 patients developed probable IA. this prophylaxis included posaconazole (10 mg/kg of body weight), caspofungin (50 mg/m2 of body surface area) and liposomal amphotericin B (1 mg/kg of body weight) the impact of antifungal prophylaxis on diagnostic test systems remains elusive. dual testing plays a decisive role in the diagnosis and management of IA. the role of antifungal prophylaxis and its interaction with diagnostic test systems in pediatric patients remains to be further evaluated in larger multicenter trials. in total, 543 blood samples (mean, 13.9 samples per patient; range, 6 to 33 samples) were collected. samples were tested as part of routine diagnostic care involving concomitant GM ELISA (Platelia; Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany) all scans were performed on a 64-slice state-of-the-art scanner. the scans were reconstructed iteratively in thin slices (1 mm) independent experts retrospectively reviewed the CT images for confirmation. a frequency analysis test was performed using the Pearson chi-square test of independence. the association between CT positivity, aspergillus positivity, and GM positivity was explored using the ROC curve method. all patients to date (n = 39) were selected for retrospective data analysis. all patients (24 males, median age of 9.5 years [range, 4 to 21 years]; 15 females, median age of 10 years [3 to 19 years]) had alloHSCT. a single positive test was required to define a positive GM ELISA. DNA was extracted from a 1-ml cell-free blood fraction. the protocol was compliant with the european aspergillus PCR Initiative recommendations (EAPCRI) for serum to guarantee the highest diagnostic standards. individual patient-specific covariates were recorded, including gender, neutropenia (neutrophil count of 500/l for >10 days), corticosteroids (0.3 mg/kg of body weight for more than 21 days) the continuous covariates of body weight (kg), days of neutropenia (neutrophil count of 500/l for >10 days), days of corticosteroid use (0.3 mg/kg body weight for more than 21 days) were recorded. the same scheme was performed for aspergillus PCR and GM assays. a nonparametric time-to-event (log rank) analysis was performed."}
