{"summary": "the metapneumoviruses are enveloped, non-segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses 1. they comprise a genus of two species: avian metapneumovirus and human metapneumovirus. the virus has a low and variable mortality but high morbidity rate. the genome was most closely related to avian metapneumovirus serotype C (up to 88% homology) but the newly discovered virus replicated efficiently in monkeys but not in birds 2. Archived sera from the 1950s contained neutralizing antibodies against HMPV. 187 RNS transcription processivity factor M2-2 protein 71 Regulates RNA transcription/replication SH Small hydrophobic protein 177\u2013183 Possible viroporin or innate immune inhibition G Attachment glycoprotein 229\u2013236 Binds to cellular glycosaminoglycans L Large polymerase protein 2,005 Catalytic activity for viral replication. viral glycoproteins are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. the polymerase switches from transcribing monocistronic mRNA to replicating full-length positive-sense antigenome to serve as a template for progeny negative-sense genomes. the dominant lineage may vary year by year 33, 36. most children worldwide are infected with HMPV by the age of 5 2, 46\u201350. peak age of hospitalization for HMPV is between 6 and 12 months of age. despite genetic differences between the subgroups, all remain capable of causing severe infection. 7% of adults hospitalized for an acute asthma exacerbation 69. infection with HMPV within the first two years of life is a risk factor for later asthma 70. one study found 16% of HMPV + patients had asthma. studies of hospitalized and outpatient children worldwide have found HMPV to be associated with 6 to 40% of acute respiratory illness 11, 41, 44\u2013 46, 51\u2013 53, 64\u201367. HMPV was identified in up to 13% of hospitalized adults in Rochester, new york 43. of 39 immunocompromised children with HMPV, 17 developed pneumonia and four died from respiratory failure 71. co-infections with other viral or bacterial pathogens may exacerbate symptoms and disease. secondary bacterial pneumonia can occur and is associated with increased mortality 72\u201374. virus replication occurs for up to 10\u201314 days in mice. peak viral load is at day 5 80, 83, 89. but unlike humans, immunocompetent mice cannot be productively re-infected with HMPV. the role of natural killer (NK) cells is unclear. one study depleted NK cells with anti-CD49 antibody. another depleted NK cells with anti-NK1.1 and found no effect 88. type I IFN receptor-deficient mice infected with HMPV had higher lung viral titers than wild-type mice. but less lung inflammation and airway dysfunction, highlighting the importance of the IFN pathway for HMPV clearance and disease 86. virus requires exogenous trypsin to replicate in vitro. virus produces robust cytopathic effects in tertiary monkey kidney and LLC-MK2 (rhesus kidney) cells 2, 118. viral propagation can take 14 days or longer. rHMPV viruses lacking the G, M2-1, M2-2, or SH protein have exhibited an attenuated and immunogenic phenotype in animal models 15, 124, 125. mutants in the methyl transferase domains of the polymerase or the integrin-binding RGD motif were attenuated, immunogenic, and protective in cotton rats 126, 127. studies of recombinant F protein report protective immunity without enhanced disease in cotton rats, hamsters, and non-human primates 91, 123. virus-like particles using HMPV M and F proteins expressed in human embryonic kidney epithelial cells 101, 123, 142 or generated using retroviral vectors 143. the review process is commissioned by members of the prestigious F1000 Faculty. the referees who approved the final version are listed with their names and affiliations."}
