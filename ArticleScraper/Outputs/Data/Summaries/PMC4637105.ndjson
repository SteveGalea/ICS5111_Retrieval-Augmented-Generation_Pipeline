{"summary": "the Flaviviridae family includes approximately 80 members divided into four genera: Flavivirus, Pestivirus, Pegivirus, and Hepacivirus. the Flavivirus genus can be further divided into four categories: mosquito-borne, tick-borne, no known vector (NKV) and insect-specific (ISF) viruses. viruses have been detected in the salivary glands of deNV-infected Aedes aegypti as early as 24 hours. persistence Interestingly, flavivirus infections in humans are self-limiting episodes with or without pathological consequences. Mosquito cell cultures have been used as suitable models to study flavivirus persistence. these models are easy to manage, they have several variables and can be controlled. one of the common features observed in C6/36 persistently infected with DENV is the presence of a cytopathic effect (CPE) during the first 4\u20137 weeks of infection. viral titres in TRA-171 cells persistently infected with DENV display an oscillation pattern during persistent infection, suggesting the presence of defective interfering particles (DIs), one of the major self-controlling mechanisms for viral replication. a more detailed description of DIs is included in subsequent section of this review. mixed infections can be classified as coinfections when the two viruses interact with the host at the same time or superinfections when one virus invades the host prior to the second virus. the chances for competition or viral interference in the vector are higher than in humans, where the infection is only transient and is cleared through the immune system. or DENV-4 sylvatic and endemic strains Heterotypic [43] C6/36 DENV-2 DENV-2 None [42] C6/36 DENV-4 DENV-4 None [42] C6/36 PCV WNV or MVEV Homologous [12] C6/36 CxFV WNV None [45] C6/36 NHUV WNV or JEV or SLEV Homologous [48] C6/ MVEV, Murray Valley encephalitis virus; SLEV, Saint Louis encephalitis virus; CHIKV, Chikungunya virus; CxFV, Culex flavivirus; NHUV, Nhumirim virus; SINV, Sindbis virus; YFV, Yellow fever virus; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus. some exceptions have been documented [32, 39, 41, 44]. some studies have reported that CxFV-infected C6/36 cells were reinfected with WNV 48 hours later and display significantly reduced titres of the secondary virus at 108 hours postinfection. other studies have reported that when the same CxFV-infected cells were reinfected with WNV two days later, homologous viral interference was not observed. aedes aegypti mosquitoes orally coinfected with two clades of DENV-2 (NI-1 and NI-2B) showed a higher replicative index for the NI-2B clade than the NI-1 clade. aedes albopictus mosquitoes intrathoracically inoculated with DENV-1 and then with CHIKV via the oral route. oes orally coinfected with both viruses showed the same results, and the viruses could also be detected in saliva, indicating the absence of heterologous viral interference. the discrepancy of these results requires further investigation but apparently could reflect the virus strain used in these studies. the absence of competition for cellular factors could also be a contributing factor because the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs of CxFV have some differences compared with WNV. the relevance of the viral interference in naturally infected vectors remains unknown. some studies have implicated several factors, such as DIs and RNAi response, in homologous viral interference. competition for cellular replication factors and the innate immune response for heterotypic viral interference are higher than in humans. the evaluation of viral interference during flavivirus infection is relatively easy to detect in cell lines. -2 DENV-2 None [42] C6/36 DENV-2 DENV-4 Heterotypic [42] C6/36 DENV-4 DENV-4 None [42] C6/36 PCV WNV or MVEV Homologous [12] C6/36 CxFV WNV None [45] C6/36 NHUV WNV or JEV or SLEV Homologous [48] C6/36 DENV-2 and Aal DNV JEV litis virus;

RNA viral polymerase generally binds to 3\u2032 end of same RNA molecule to initiate replication. eIF5, eukaryotic initiation factor 5 (eIF5), 40S ribosomal protein S6 and 60S ribosomal protein L4 (Table 4) have been implicated in viral replication in mosquitoes [72, 83, 86, 87] cellular factors involved in the flavivirus translation/replication. ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit. ribosomal protein L4 (RPL4 or RPL1) is a component of the 60S ribosomal subunit. this protein is involved in regulating cell size, cell proliferation, and glucose homeostasis through selective translation of particular classes of mRNAs. eIF5 inhibitor did not affect viral titres [87]. the interaction between the ribosomal proteins S6 and L4 and the NS2A and NS4B nonstructural viral proteins is likely involved in flavivirus RNA translation. however, this interaction has been reported in other viruses, such as Epstein\u2013Barr virus noncoding RNA EBER1. cytoplasm in C6/36-infected cells suggests a role for the human La protein in flaviviral replication as a component of the RNP. the association of EF1 and the La protein, which function as chaperones, with eIF5 and ribosomal proteins S6 and L4, components of the translational machinery, could stimulate flavivirus translation in a favourable context. small RNAs are processed through the RNAse III-like enzymes Dicer-1 or Dicer-2 (primarily Dicer-2), to generate small dsRNA (21 to 25 nt) the synthesized siRNAs perfectly compliment the target RNA, resulting in RNA degradation through the exosome or the exosome XRN1/Pacman [100, 102] viviruses have mechanisms to evade the RNAi response and establish a persistent and noncytopathic infection in the vector [102] viruses could express RNAi inhibitors. cDNAs generated from the genomes of DIs through cellular reverse transcriptase-mediated retrotranscription. similar results were obtained with the Sindbis virus, a member of the Flaviviridae family. this finding suggests that a similar process might occur with flaviviruses. however, this idea requires further investigation. transcriptome analysis of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with deNV, YFV, or WNV showed similar overall gene expression. this response has recently been characterized in the Aag2 Aegypti cell line [120]. studies using the mosquito bacterial microflora have suggested that prior immune system activation influences the course of viral infection. a similar result was obtained with mosquitoes previously fed with either blood or sugar meals contaminated with Proteus sp. and Paenibacillus sp. 80% of C6/36 cells persistently infected with JEV were positive for the NS5 protein based on immunofluorescence analysis [25] there is typically little correlation between the number of cells positive for the viral antigen and the release of infectious virus particles [122] this finding has been reported in C6/36 cells persistently infected with DENV [22] and in different mosquito cells lines persistently infected with SLEV [61]. Vago induction is Dicer-2-dependent, but RNAi-independent through the activation of TRAF. cleaves the Rel2 protein (a homologue of mammalian NFB) and facilitates translocation of this protein to the nucleus to activate the Vago gene. the antiviral activity of Vago is mediated through the JAK-STAT pathway. the viral interference experiments have primarily been performed with the Aedes albopictus mosquito cell line C6/36. recent studies have shown that this cell line contains a defective RNAi pathway, reflecting a defect in the Dicer-2 protein [74, 105]."}
