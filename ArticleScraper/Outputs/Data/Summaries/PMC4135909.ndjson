{"summary": "infected ducks developed high fever, diarrhea, and anorexia. the disease also caused large decreases in egg production in egg-laying ducks within 1 to 2 weeks postinfection. analysis of partial sequences of the E and NS5 genes revealed a close relationship with the NTAV group of the genus Flavivirus. the phylogenetic and antigenic analyses revealed a close relationship to the Tembusu virus and the Sitiawan virus. effective vaccines for flaviviruses have been developed and widely used for mammals, including those against the yellow fever virus. the ducklings were cared for in accordance with humane procedures and biosecurity guidelines established by the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute. a virulent DTMUV strain was isolated from the livers of dead ducks during an outbreak of DHO at a farm in the Shandong Province in china. RNA was extracted from 200 l of du/CH/LSD/110128 infectious allantoic fluid. cDNA fragment from viral RNA was amplified and sequenced using forward and reverse primers. the sequences were used for a BLAST search of the GenBank database. five groups of 1-day-old ducklings were housed in different isolators. group 1 contained 20 ducklings and groups 2 to 5 contained 15 ducklings each. three birds from groups 1 to 5 were euthanized on day 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 postinoculation. ducklings were exsanguinated on days 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 postinoculation. ducklings were exsanguinated on days 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 postinoculation. three groups of 1-day-old ducklings were housed in different isolators. group 1 contained 18 birds, group 2 contained 18 birds and was used as the positive-control group. each bird in group 1 was inoculated by intracerebral injection of 100 l of pathogenic du/CH/LSD/110128. TTATGCAGGTACCGATG-3\u2032 and the reverse primer 5\u2032-CGTATGGGTTGACTGTTATCA-3\u2032 were cloned into the pMD18-T plasmid. the sequence of the PCR product was confirmed, and the plasmid was used as the positive-control template for virus detection and quantification. the copy number of the plasmid was calculated, as described previously (16). 0.05 were considered statistically significant. cDNA sequence encoding amino acid residues 1 to 352 of the NS1 protein of the du/CH/LSD/110128 virus was generated using primers 5\u2032-GAATTCACGGGGTGCTCAATCGACTTGGCT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCGGCCCTTAACCCCCTTGAAAAGCCA-3\u2032. Western blot analysis of purified recombinant DTMUV NS1 protein. serum samples collected from ducklings inoculated with the du/CH/LSD/110128 strain were incubated with a 1:200 dilution of goat anti-duck IgG(H+L) cDNAs of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the viral genome were generated by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using a 5\u2032/3\u2032 R primers 5\u2032-RACE (5\u2032-CGTCGTTCCCAGATTCCA-3\u2032) and 3\u2032-RACE (5\u2032-CCAGGATGAAG-3\u2032) cDNAs of the intervening sequences of the genome were generated using a PrimeScript One Step RT-PCR kit. thermal cycling for PCR was performed at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 60 s, 50\u00b0C for 60 s, and 72\u00b0C for 2 min, CCAGGCTGGAGTGG F5 1,347 4683\u20134703 5R CGCTGTGGTCCTGAGTA 6011\u20136029 6R GGTCTCTTGACAAAGGC F6 1,298 5705\u20135724 6R GGTCTCTCAAG 6984\u20137002 7R CTGGTTCCTCTCATGCCCTGGC 7975\u20137994 8R TGTAATCAACTGACCCG F8 1,321 7697\u20137716 8R all of the animals and eggs used in our experiments were specific pathogen free. the ducklings were cared for in accordance with humane procedures and biosecurity guidelines established by the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute. cDNA fragment from viral RNA was amplified and sequenced using the forward and reverse primers. the sequences were used for a BLAST search of the GenBank database. the newly isolated du/CH/LSD/110128 strain was a DTMUV. the chicken embryo-propagated viral stocks of du/CH/LSD/110128 were produced by inoculating the virus into embryonated eggs via the allantoic cavity. the viral preparations were identified by the RT-PCR assay and sequencing and were stored at 80\u00b0C as viral stocks. each duckling in groups 1, 2, and 3 was inoculated with du/CH/LSD/110128 at P0, P70, and P90. ducklings were examined daily for signs of infection until day 30 postinoculation. ducklings were exsanguinated on days 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 postinoculation. three groups of 1-day-old ducklings were housed in different isolators. group 1 contained 18 birds, group 2 contained 18 birds and was used as the positive-control group. birds in groups 2 and 3 were mock inoculated with sterile allantoic fluid. a 115-nt sequence of the E gene of the virus was amplified by RT-PCR using the forward primer 5\u2032-GTCTTATGCAGGTACCGATG-3\u2032 and the reverse primer 5\u2032-CGTATGGGTTGACTGTTATCA-3\u2032. the sequence of the PCR product was confirmed, and the plasmid was used as the positive-control template for virus detection and quantification. cDNA sequence encoding amino acid residues 1 to 352 of the NS1 protein of the du/CH/LSD/110128 virus was generated using the primers 5\u2032-GAATTCACGGGGTGCTCAATCGACTTGGCT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCGGCCCTTAACCCCCTTGAAAAGCCA-3\u2032. recombinant protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a Western blot analysis of purified recombinant DTMUV NS1 protein. serum samples from ducklings inoculated with the du/CH/LSD/110128 strain were used as negative-control samples. the cDNAs of the intervening sequences of the viral genome were generated by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using a 5\u2032/3\u2032 RACE kit (TaKaRa-Bio) the primers 5\u2032-RACE (5\u2032-CGTCGTTCCCAGATTCCA-3\u2032) and 3\u2032-RACE (5\u2032-CCAGGATGAAG-3\u2032) were generated using a PrimeScript One Step RT-PCR kit (version 2; TaKa the sequences obtained in the previous section were manually compiled, and the ORF was determined by using the Gene Runner program. the nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared with those of BYDV strains. all of the ducklings exhibited neurological signs on days 3 to 13 postinoculation. clinical symptoms included lethargy, anorexia, paralysis, opisthotonos, and ataxia. two ducklings died at 84 and 132 h postinoculation. no deaths, clinical signs, or gross lesions were observed in the P90-inoculated ducklings or the negative-control group. three ducklings challenged with the du/CH/LSD/110128 strain died on days 3, 5, and 6 postinoculation. all of the birds inoculated with the P50 inoculum displayed neurological symptoms. 90 P0 P50 P70 P90 Trachea ++b +++ ++ ++ + + + + ++ + + + + ++ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + b +++, viral RNA was detected in the tissue samples by the TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay. the threshold cycle values of the tissue samples ranged from 18 to 24. no viral RNA was detected in the tissue samples by the real-time RT-PCR assay. du/CH/LSD/110128 immunogenicity was not altered by serial passage. no deaths or clinical signs were observed in the P90-inoculated ducklings after challenge with virulent Du/CH/LSD/110128. two to four silent mutations occurred in the coding regions of the E, NS1, NS2A, NS3, NS4B, and NS5 genes. most of the nucleotide substitutions in the NS1 and NS3 genes were observed at P30 and thereafter. single-nucleotide substitutions were observed in the NS3 and NS4 genes at P70 and P90, respectively.
