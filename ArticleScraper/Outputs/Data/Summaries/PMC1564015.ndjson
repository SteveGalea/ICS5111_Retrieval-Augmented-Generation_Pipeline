{"summary": "study shows mast cells may play roles in adaptive and adaptive immunity. mast cells are best known for their role in immunoglobulin E (IgE)-dependent allergic responses. crosslinking of FcRI-bound IgE with multivalent antigen initiates activation of mast cells by promoting the aggregation of FcRI. granules contain vasoactive amines, neutral proteases, proteoglycans and some cytokines and growth factors. the role of mast cells in acute allergic reactions is now widely accepted [4,5,7,8] mast cells have been proposed to play a role in mediating bacterial clearance by releasing cytokines and by killing opsonized bacteria. this suggests that mast cells have a physiological role in modulating host defenses against infectious agents. mast cells appear have effects in the initiation and regulation of innate immunity. over 559 genes were differentially regulated in the stimulated cells. a substantial number of genes were regulated by IgE sensitization alone. some of the most prominent findings are the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. cells were characterized as Mast Cells by flow cytometry as positive for the specific mast cell marker intracellular chymase. positive c-Kit/CD117+ and FcRI+, and by Toluidine blue staining. Purity was estimated at >97%. 760 genes (8.6%) were differentially expressed between resting and stimulated mast cells. 58 genes were initially upregulated (at least 2-fold) by IgE-sensitization alone. a total of 115 genes were overexpressed (by 2-fold or more in at least one time point) cRNA from cell of each time point were hybridized to Human Genome Focus array and signals were scanned after fluidics. the data was analyzed as described in material and methods and analysis revealed differential expression of 760 genes between resting and stimulated mast cells with statistical significance (P 0.05). each colored box represents the normalized expression level of a given gene in a particular experimental condition. 35 CSF1 Colony stimulating factor 1 1.6 4.5 1.9 -1.4 NM_000877.1 IL1R1 Interleukin 1 receptor, type I 1.4 2.2 1.9 -1.2 AI983115 IL27RA Class I cytokine receptor 1.4 1.3 2.6 1.1 NM_001561.2 TNFRSF9 Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 9 1.2 1.5 2.5 1.7 NM_016639.1 TNFRSF12 cell activation gene 3.4 6.8 -2.3 -3.9 NM_002309.2 LIF Leukemia inhibitory factor (Cholinergic differentiation factor) -1.3 -1.3 -4.0 L07555 CD69 antigen -1.1 4.1 -1.0 -1.7 AF036906 LAT Linker for activation of T cells 1.9 2.3 2.3 NM_004233.1 CD83 antigen 2.4 3.0 1.6 -1.2 NM_000675.2 ADO gene 2 expressed on myeloid cells 1 1.4 2.2 2.5 1.7 U37546 BIRC3 Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing 3 1.4 2.0 1.1 -1.1 NM_002000.1 FCAR Fc fragment of IgA, receptor for 1.4 2.0 1.7 -1.9 NM_003264.1 TLR2 Toll-like receptor 2 1.4 2.0 2.0 -1.6 NM_002114.1 HIVEP1 Human immunodeficiency virus type I enhancer binding protein 1 factor alpha polypeptide 1.8 2.4 1.7 1.1 NM_003897.1 IER3 Immediate early response 3 1.8 3.0 -1.2 -2.3 NM_002608.1 PDGFB Platelet-derived growth factor beta polypeptide 1.2 2.0 -1.2 1.0 NM_006763.1 BTG2 BTG family, member 2 1.5 2.0 -1.1 -1.9 NM_005655.1 TIEG TGFB inducible early growth response 1.8 BG054844 ARHE Ras homolog gene family, member E 1.3 2.2 1.9 -1.0 NM_000216.1 KAL1 Kallmann syndrome 1 sequence 1.4 1.4 1.3 2.0 M62994 FLNB Filamin B, beta (actin binding protein 278) 1.2 1.4 2.0 NM_004357.1 CD151 antigen 1.0 1.2 2.1 -1.1 AA243143 ARF6 ADP-ribosylation factor 6 2.1 1.3 1.1 epsilon 1.7 2.0 1.1 -1.2 NM_002467.1 MYC V-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (avian) 1.7 2.1 1.1 -1.3 NM_001423.1 EMP1 Epithelial membrane protein 1 1.4 1.6 2.1 1.3 NM_012081 ELL2 ELL-related RNA polymerase II, elongation factor 1.7 1.3 2.6 1.3 14.5kDa 1.6 1.6 2.0 1.4 M60278 HBEGF Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor 1.1 2.4 -2.1 -5.0 U77914 JAG1 Jagged 1 (Alagille syndrome) 1.4 2.5 1.8 1.0 NM_000527.2 LDLR Low density lipoprotein receptor 1.6 2.0 -1.8 -1.4 NM_005904.1 MADH7 MAD, mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 7 binding protein 1.3 1.6 2.0 1.1 M14333 FYN FYN oncogene related to SRC, FGR, YES 1.3 1.5 3.7 1.6 NM_005023.1 PGGT1B Protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I, beta subunit 1.7 1.4 1.5 2.1 NM_006296.1 VRK2 Vaccinia related kinase 2 1.3 1.4 2.0 -1.1 AF127481 proto-L all the genes, observed to be upregulated at least 2-fold at any given time point, were distributed. all the genes, observed to be upregulated at least 2-fold at any given time point, were distributed, according to their biological function described in table 1. genes coding for the chemokines IL-8 (cXCL8) (2.1 fold), MIP1 (CCL4) (3.5 fold), MCP3 (CCL7) (2.1 fold), GRO (CXCL1) (2.3 fold) and GRO (CXCL3) (1.6 fold) were also upregulated. IL-8 plays a major role in inflammatory responses mainly due to its ability to recruit and activate neutrophils. IL-8 plays a major role in inflammatory responses mainly due to its ability to recruit and activate neutrophils. several other chemokine genes were upregulated during mast cell stimulation. PBEF1 (pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor), PBEF1 (pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor), TIEG (TGFB inducible early growth response), and INSIG1 (insulin induced gene 1) were upregulated. several anti-apoptosis genes including TNFAIP3 (TNF-alpha-induced protein 3), TNFAIP8 (TNF-alpha-induced protein 8), IER3 (immediate early response expression of genes involved in cell adhesion and cytoskeleton remodeling is an essential step in immune-cell activation. reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton leads to the formation of supramolecular activation clusters. genes for several transcription factors were upregulated during IgE-sensitization and FcRI aggregation. a substantial number of genes coding for intracellular signaling proteins were upregulated, by at least 2-fold (Table. 1g) these include genes for serine protein kinases of the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase family, such as MAP2K3 and MAP3K14. members of this family are critical for signal transduction cascades triggered by all antigen receptors including by FcRI, TCR, FcRs, and the B-cell antigen receptor real time PCR results showed that the messenger RNA for selected genes follows a similar pattern of expression to that observed with the oligo-DNA microarray experiment. the results confirm the results and the quality of the data obtained with the high-density microarrays. ELISA-triggered generation of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, CCL7 (MCP3) and CCL5 (RANTES) whereas IgE sensitization alone triggered smaller amounts of IL-1 and MCP3, high amount of IL-8, and very less amounts of IL-6 and RANTES. monomeric-IgE alone triggers exocytosis of granules containing pre-formed inflammatory mediators in a tyrosine kinase and calcium dependent manner. blots were probed for -tubulin (control for equal loading) cells following addition of IgE alone (IgE), intracellular calcium levels were analyzed in a continuous reading for the timesstated in the graph. results shown are the mean plus the standard deviation of triplicate measurements.

following IgE-sensitization (IgE) for 24 hours; and FcRI aggregation by addition of the anti-human IgE to sensitized cells for 24 hours (XLFcRI). results shown are the mean plus the standard deviation of triplicate measurements and are representative of four separate experiments. monomeric-IgE alone is not able to trigger any changes on the overall protein-tyrosine phosphorylation patterns compared with resting cells. on the other hand FcRI-aggregation did indeed trigger all these responses (Fig. 6A,B &6C). monomeric-IgE-sensitization for 30 minutes (IgE) and XLFcRI aggregation by addition of the anti-human IgE to sensitized cells for 30 minutes (XLFcRI) results show the mean plus the standard deviation of triplicate measurements. several genes related to proliferation were upregulated by IgE alone. however, whether these genes, if fully transcribed, may trigger mast cell proliferation in the absence of SCF is not known. some genes encoding for transcription factors were upregulated by monomeric-IgE. many studies have emphasized the role of this transcription factor in regulating genes at critical points in immune-cell development and activation [37], which may explain the importance of the NFB pathway in oncogenesis and resistance to chemotherapy. a substantial number of genes coding for intracellular signaling proteins were upregulated, by at least 2-fold, during mast cell stimulation. we showed that SPHK1 is involved in the calcium signals triggered by FcRI aggregation in human mast cells. previously, we reported a pivotal role for SPHK1 in monocyte activation by the high-affinity IgG receptor (FcRI) [42,43], showing that SPHK is key in triggering calcium release from internal stores, and the activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. in gene expression, under these conditions, are representative of a pathological state is not currently known. it is also not known whether IgE/antigen and FcRI aggregation will trigger the same set of genes in an organism, where a number of events may be activating mast cells at the same time. this is an attempt to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which mast cells may contribute to the overall activation of the immune response. isolated CD34+ haematopoietic progenitor-cells were harvested using MACS cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) the isolated progenitor-cells were cultured for 5-6-weeks in the presence of 100 ng/ml of Stem Cell Factor (SCF Cat: 300-07, PeproTec, Rocky Hill, NJ) cells were shown to be differentiated by staining them for specific mast cell markers as follows. the differentiated mast cells were plated in 6 well plates and allowed to rest for 24 hr. cells in all wells, except the control well, were sensitized with human monomeric IgE (1 g/ml, Anti-human-IgE, Cat: 30-AI05, Lot number A01071004, Fitzgerald, Concord, MA) overnight. microarray data collection and analysis was carried out using MicroArray Suite 5.0 (MAS) the absolute data (signal intensity, detection call and detection P-value) were exported into GeneSpring v7.0 (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA, USA) software for analysis by parametric test based on cross gene error model (PCGEM) PCRs were performed in a lightCycler\u00ae instrument (Roche) for reverse transcription at 61\u00b0C for 20 min, initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 2 min. amplification for 45\u201365 cycles of denaturation (95\u00b0C, 5s, ramp rate 20\u00b0C/s), annealing (optimal temperature, 5s, ramp rate 20\u00b0C/s) and extension (72\u00b0C, product length [bp]/25 s, ramp rate 2 cytokine detection Supernatants from control cells, cells sensitized, and cells following FcRI aggregation were collected and stored at -20C until use. blots were probed using a monoclonal anti-tubulin (anti-tubulin, sc-5286, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), and an anti-mouse. cells were loaded with 1 g/ml Fura2-AM (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) in PBS, 1.5 mM Ca2+ and 1 % BSA. after removal of excess reagents by dilution and centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 1.5 mM Ca2+ supplemented PBS. aliquot of cells was resuspended in 1.5 mM Ca2+ and 1 % BSA. cells were incubated with 200 l of 1 mM p-nitrophenyl N-acetyl--D-glucosaminide for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. aliquot was determined by a 1:1 extraction of the remaining buffer. cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, then resuspended in 100 l of PBS/1% FBS and 5 l of FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG-FITC, Sigma-Aldrich, Singapore) samples were incubated for 20 min at RT. cell culture Human umbilical cord blood samples were collected from normal full-term deliveries of informed individuals with formal consent. isolated CD34+ haematopoietic progenitor-cells were cultured for 5-6-weeks in the presence of 100 ng/ml of Stem Cell Factor (SCF Cat: 300-07, PeproTec, Rocky Hill, NJ) cells were shown to be differentiated by staining them for specific mast cell markers. anti-human FcRI polyclonal (Rabbit-IgG-ab31494;
