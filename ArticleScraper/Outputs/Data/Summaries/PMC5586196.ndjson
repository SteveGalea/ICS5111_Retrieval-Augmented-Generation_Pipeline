{"summary": "the gastrointestinal microbiota of healthy human adults consists of about 1500 microbial species which constitute 1012 bacteria per gram of stool. the most dominant taxa have the highest stability in the gut (Mart et al., 2017). the majority of gut bacteria are transient populations which pass through the lumen of the lower GIT (Tropini et al., 2017). spores which facilitate both microbiota persistence and transmission varies among individuals with geographic provenance, gender, age, diet, malnutrition, and intake of probiotics or antimicrobial agents. lactobacillus spp. content of fecal samples is characterized by temporal fluctuations and lack of stability. they constitute only a minor fraction within the human adult fecal microbiota, i.e. around 0.01 to 0.6% of total bacterial counts. Bacillus spp. (B. pumilus, B. licheniformis, B. clausii, B. subtilis, B. megaterium, B. megaterium, B. mediterraneensis, B. thuringiensis) have been isolated from the healthy human GIT. most of bacteria absorbed in the body can supplement the gastrointestinal microbiome. the challenge of identifying the \u201cspheres of influence\u201d of the transient microbiota in the human body has not been solved. it is the lack of data on the complexes secreted by this microbiota. the modern concept of a gut\u2013brain axis (McKay et al., 2017) must be detailed and refined. the modern concept of a gut\u2013brain axis must be detailed and refined. the modern concept of a gut\u2013brain axis (McKay et al., 2017) must be detailed and refined. the administration of probiotics has been shown to favorably alter the intestinal microbiota balance, enhance intestinal integrity and motility. the beneficial effect of probiotics on GIT is mediated by influence on composition, diversity and function of the intestinal microbiota as well as whole human organism. treatment of colorectal colitis in mice with probiotic B. subtilis restored balance in gut microflora. beneficial species of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Butyricicoccus spp. were increased. gut damage-promoting species of Acinetobacter sp., Ruminococcus sp., Clostridium spp., and Veillonella sp. were decreased. a decrease in populations of Ruminococcus and Lactobacillus was observed in a rat model of colorectal cancer. Firmicutes and Fusobacteria were over-represented whereas Proteobacteria were under-represented in patients. the molecular basis for the effectiveness of probiotics remains unexplored or partially studied. the future study aimed at deciphering the mechanisms that determine the probiotic properties of bacteria will certainly allow expanding the areas of scientifically proven probiotic use in medicine. bacteria have immunomodulatory properties that allow them inducing tolerogenic immune responses against themselves. probiotics affect key signaling pathways, such as NFB and MAPK, through the pattern-recognition receptors (TLR, NOD) these molecules enter host circulation thereby mediating the link between the gut and other organs (brain, lung, liver, muscle) the influence of gut microbiota on epigenetic regulation of host genes via DNA methylation and histone modifications has been demonstrated. the study of representatives of the Bacilli class colonizing the human GIT mostly refer to ascertaining their positive, less often negative, impact on the body. top-appreciated compounds are shown in upper part of panels, under-appreciated compounds \u2013 in lower parts. both Lactobacillus and Bacillus are minor part of the GIT microbiota. cellular bile salt hydrolase was revealed against intestinal protozoan parasite Giardia duodenalis. other enzymes like N-acylated homoserine lactone (AHL)-lactonase help to modulate the microbiota content by decreasing the number of quorum-sensing pathogenic bacteria in the GIT. i et al., 2017), inhibit proliferation of tumor cells by apoptosis induction, stimulate production of insulin-like growth factor 1 promoting bone growth and remodeling. i et al., 2016), cause epigenetic modifications, regulate blood pressure and inflammation. SCFAs represent the natural ligands for free fatty acid receptors 2 and 3 (FFAR 2/3) (former G protein-coupled receptors, GPR43 and GPR41), involved in the regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. these receptors are expressed on neurons of the peripheral, autonomic and somatic nervous systems. the role for H2O2 in the anti-Salmonella activity of L. johnsonii NCC533, the human intestinal isolate and a probiotic strain, was revealed in vitro. the role for H2O2 in the anti-Salmonella activity of L. delbrueckii VI1007 was revealed in vitro. 2O2 has been shown to affect the activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. it suppresses the oxidant-induced intestinal permeability. it inhibits viability of colon cancer cells via apoptosis. antimicrobial peptides of Bacilli were shown to be active against pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Klebsiella sp. Lactobacillus produces a number of bacteriocins usually active against closely related Gram-positive bacteria. most bacteriocins are small, heat-stable cationic peptides which form pores in the cytoplasmic membrane of sensitive bacteria. other bacteriocins interrupt production of peptidoglycan. Bacteriocins and bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances produced by Bacillus exhibit antibacterial activity toward Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. however, activity against Gram-positives is comparatively higher. non-ribosomal peptide antibiotics produced by Bacillus (bacitracin, proticin, lichenicidin, bacillaene) are essential for the protection of these bacteria from predation and antibiotics produced by other species. s exhibit a broad range of antimicrobial activities and possess antiviral action. they protect bacilli against extracellular antibiotic-containing vesicles of other species. they inhibit phospholipase A2 resulting in subsequent downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. two secreted proteins p75 and p40 of L. rhamnosus GG have been shown to prevent cytokine-induced cell apoptosis by activating the antiapoptotic protein kinase B and inhibiting the pro-apoptotic MAPK. the proteins from L. casei BL23 were demonstrated to elicit similar host responses. guanyl-preferring ribonucleases (RNases) is a distinct feature of some Bacillus species. binase from B. pumilus has manifested antitumor. cGMP enhances extracellular adenosine and reduces uric acid levels. increased cGMP levels in the colon epithelium activate antioxidant gene expression. cGMP expression is significantly decreased upon ulcerative colitis and colon cancer. gut Firmicutes produced peptide aldehydes with a half-life of hours. intestinal Bacilli have NOS that is evolutionary related to the mammalian enzymes. conservation of NOS-derived NO-heme receptor signaling between bacteria and mammals was proved. Ferrichrome of L. casei was identified as a tumor-suppressive molecule on colon cancer cells. many siderophore-binding proteins were found in EVs of B. subtilis. siderophores can endow bacilli advantage in competition for low-available iron with pathogenic bacteria. the EVs are enriched with proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and metabolites. release of vesicular cargo is achieved by direct intercellular transfer mediated by the membranes fusion. proteins with specific biological activities can be directly delivered inside EVs into other cells ensuring their penetration. EVs of sporulating B. subtilis superoxide dismutase, alkaline phosphatase III, polyketide synthase PKsM (associated with antibiotic activity) were identified in EVs of sporulating B. subtilis superoxide dismutase, alkaline phosphatase III, polyketide synthase PKsM (associated with antibiotic activity) EVs derived from B. lentus induced apoptosis of human colon carcinoma cells HCT116 (Yang et al., 2016). EVs derived from L. rhamnosus GG are likely to be implicated in the anti-cancer activity as they induce apoptosis. representatives of the genus Bacillus belong to VVU. she structured the review and created the scheme summarizing the main idea of the review."}
