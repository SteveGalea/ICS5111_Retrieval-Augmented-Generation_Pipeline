{"summary": "Ebola GP from the Reston subtype, believed to be non-pathogenic to humans, had a less severe cell rounding effect [4], [5]. GP is also believed to be a key determinant of viral pathogenesis and virus-like particles (VLPs) containing GP are shown to activate human endothelial cells and macrophages. sGP may be a mechanism used by the virus to prevent cytotoxicity. previous studies suggest that Ebola GP is incorporated into VLPs along with the viral VP40 and NP proteins when co-expressed in cells. VP40 plays an important role in viral replication, assembly and budding. HEK293T cells were transfected for 24 hours using the calcium phosphate transfection method [25] with various plasmids. their localization relative to cellular ER and Golgi were examined by transfecting 8 g GP or GPmucin with 2 g pDsRed2-ER or pEYFP-Golgi. full-length Ebola GP localizes in the ER in close proximity to the nuclear membrane. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with 10 g GP (pCB6-EbGP) plasmid for 24 hours. cells were fixed and stained for DNA (blue) using a mouse monoclonal antibody. GPmucin was uniformly expressed throughout the cell and did not localize within Golgi, early endosomes or late endosomes. this dispersed localization suggests that it is diffusely localized in the plasma membrane. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected for 24 hours with 8 g GPmucin and 2 g pDsRed2-ER vector. cells were fixed and stained for late endosomes using a mouse monoclonal antibody targeting CD63 (BD Biosciences, blue) and for GPmucin as above (red) co-expression of GP and VP40 did not alter localization of either protein. GP remained in close proximity to the nuclear membrane consistent with an ER localization while VP40 localized near the plasma membrane. green represents VP40. Scale bar represents 15 m. upper and lower side panels show VP40 and GP fluorescence respectively. vimentin revealed NP aggregates were lined with vimentin. the NP association with vimentin suggests the NP was present in aggresome-like structures. VP40 and NP did not colocalize upon co-expression. full-length GP localization in the ER could play a role in its cytotoxic and cell rounding properties. the mucin-like region of GP is reported to cause cytotoxicity. the GP mucin-like region of GP is reported to cause cytotoxicity. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions SB and TJH conceived and designed the study, SB performed the experiments, and SB and TJH wrote the manuscript."}
