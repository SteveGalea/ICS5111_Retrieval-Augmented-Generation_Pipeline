{"summary": "positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses make use of the host's internal membrane environment for viral genome replication and transcription. the strategy of membrane remodeling is thought to be conserved in all positive sense RNA viruses, but the actual modifications and structures made can drastically vary. Picornaviruses reorganize mitochondrial membrane into small 50 nm vesicles. these vesicles are single membranes and are positioned between the inner and outer mitochondrial membrane. the order Nidovirales contains families of positive sense nonsegmented single-stranded RNA viruses featuring an envelope. all nidoviruses share a genome with a similar layout. the first two overlapping open reading frames produce two large polyproteins. these polyproteins are co- and post-translationally cleaved free into the nonstructural proteins. arteriviruses remain the best studied and characterized nidoviruses. domain annotations were based on conserved amino acid sequences. positions of transmembrane and hydrophobic nontransmembrane regions were predicted by TMHMM 2.0. the two-layer delineated membranes are interconnected with regions of convoluted membranes (CMs) the precise progenitor pathway from which they are formed remains unclear. for both the coronaviruses and arteriviruses, members of the cellular autophagy machinery have been implicated in DMV formation. cytoplasmic LC3-I becomes lipidated and studs the autophagosome. this is in contrast to the LC3 that has been shown to decorate the DMVs. absence of Atg5, a critical member of the autophagy machinery, did not cause a defect in DMV formation in coronavirus-infected cells. coronavirus nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 are all required to induce DMVs resembling those seen in arterivirus-infected cells. mutation in coronavirus nsp3 has been shown to lead to virus having a defect in DMV-formation ability, suggesting an important role for nsp5 and polyprotein processing in DMV formation. TM domains that feature conical shapes will induce membrane curvature by forcing the membrane to accommodate and deform around the conical region in a wedge-like manner. nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 (and their Nidovirales homologs) contain TM domains and work together in a scaffold-like fashion. nsp3 alone produces proliferated membrane, nsp4 alone has no membrane phenotype. nsp4 has a negative effect on nsp6's vesiculation. the intracellular phenotypes of cells expressing both nsp3 and nsp6 suggest these proteins may promote membrane curvature. nsp6 modifies the long-range organization of paired membranes without disrupting membrane pairing, possibly by inducing deep curvature into the nsp3+nsp4 scaffold. the lipid environment may also be affected in nidovirus-infected cells for the purposes of membrane rearrangement."}
