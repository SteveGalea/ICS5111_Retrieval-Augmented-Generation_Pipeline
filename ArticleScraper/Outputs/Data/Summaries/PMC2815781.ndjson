{"summary": "there are 16 recognized serological subtypes of type A influenza virus hemagglutinin (H1 through H16) and 9 type A neuraminidase subtypes (N1 through N9) relatively few subtypes have been identified as causes of human disease. the current year 2009 has been marked by a late season pandemic-scale emergence of a novel A/H1N1 outbreak strain. some avian A/H5 and A/H7 strains of influenza virus are recognized as highly pathogenic (HP) in domestic poultry. concerns arise that this phenotype may carry over to infections of humans. the NHRC IRB approved verbal consent for this protocol because of minimal risk to volunteers. samples are collected for accredited diagnostic testing, and only used for further research in a de-identified manner with minimal demographic data (date and site of collection, age, sex, and aggregate) human throat swabs and one human lung sample from a deceased patient were collected by Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU-3, Cairo, Egypt) avian influenza viruses in these samples were cultured using chicken eggs and/or Madin-Darby canine kidney cell cultures. total RNA was extracted and purified from culture isolates. sources of control nucleic acid templates included type cultures of reference strain Eurasian-African A/H5N1 high pathogenicity influenza virus. reference control templates as mixtures of the A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B strains of influenza virus were from live virus preparations. the 30 other types of viruses and bacterial targeted by the RPM-Flu assay as agents of flu-like illness are identified in Supplemental Information Figure S1. a single total nucleic acid preparation from a single aliquot of a single specimen is assayed for possible detection and illumination of specimen-specific gene sequences. the largest segment of the RPM-Flu microarray (41,063 bp) is allocated to 40 detector tiles to represent the multiple subtypes of type A and type B HA and NA genes, selected type A M genes, and conserved NS and PB2 gene sequences from avian influenza virus A/H5N1. each RPM-Flu assay consumed about 30 l (2%) of the originally archived specimen (about 1.5 ml) each RPM-Flu assay of a specimen generates sequence data as base calls (A, G, C, or T) across each detector tile of Affymetrix CustomSeq-formatted microarrays. TSEQ software evaluates a \u201cC3 Score\u201d for each RPM-Flu detector tile, as a metric of detected DNA sequence quantity and quality. detection thresholds often represent C3 Scores that are more than 6 standard deviations (>6, P0.000003) above the mean of C3 Scores from thousands of detector tiles from assays performed in the absence of positive control templates. all sequences from an RPM-Flu assay that meet a detection and reporting threshold are automatically subjected to alignment-based search of the TessArray Validated Reference Sequence Database (VRSD) resulting stocks of BRD10622N(H1N1) and BRD10601(H3N2) were determined to contain 3.16107 TCID50/ml and 1.78107 TCID50/ml. serial ten-fold dilutions of viral stocks for RPM-Flu assays were prepared using fresh cell culture media as diluent. avian influenza viruses in these samples were cultured using chicken eggs and/or Madin-Darby canine kidney cell cultures. total RNA was extracted and purified from culture isolates and 1100 to 11000 dilutions were used for diagnostic evaluations. total nucleic acid extractions and purifications performed following harvest from infected eggs at SEPRL. aliquot from final preparation was frozen and forwarded for RPM-Flu analysis. corroborative de novo gene sequence determinations from amplified products from hemagglutinin (HA), matrix (M), neuraminidase (NA), non-structural (NS1) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunit (PB2) genes. 117,254 bp of gene sequences distributed across 188 detector tiles representing 30 different categories of viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. 142 detector tiles represent genes of other pathogens that may cause \u201cflu-like\u201d respiratory illness in humans. the largest segment of the RPM-Flu microarray (41,063 bp) is allocated to 40 detector tiles to represent the multiple subtypes of type A and type B HA and NA genes, selected type A M genes, and conserved NS and PB2 gene sequences. each RPM-Flu assay of a specimen generates sequence data as base calls (A, G, C, or T) across each detector tile of Affymetrix CustomSeq-formatted microarrays. TSEQ software evaluates a \u201cC3 Score\u201d for each RPM-Flu assay of a specimen. the C3 Score is the total number of GSEQ-identified nucleotides that appear in runs of three or more consecutive (non-N) base calls. this approach reduces background noise from spurious false-positive hybridizations of 25-base oligonucleotide probes that could lead to isolated and relatively uninformative single base calls. a BLAST alignment and sequence similarity search must return one or more most similar sequence records from the search database (as TessArae's VRSD) the resulting stocks were determined to contain 3.16107 TCID50/ml and 1.78107 TCID50/ml. influenza virus subtype A/H1 gene detector tile \u2018HA1(H1N1)\u2019 on the RPM-Flu microarray is an array of 11,808 resequencing oligonucleotide probes (25-mers) this is the actual A/H1N1 strain of influenza virus representing the viral HA1 gene product in the 2004\u20132005 vaccine configuration. aliquot of fluMist vaccine (2004\u20132005) was subjected to RPM-Fl BLAST analysis of assay-generated HA1, NA1, HA3, NA2, M(H1N1), M(H3N2) gene sequences correctly correspond to the actual influenza virus strains used in the 2004\u20132005 vaccine configuration. the most similar sequence records returned from BLAST analysis of assay-generated HA1, NA1, HA3, NA2, neuraminidase, and matrix gene sequences. reflects the robust capability of the RPM-Flu resequencing microarray to determine accurately the match or alternative mismatch of each target gene nucleotide relative to corresponding nucleotide of the detector sequence. these results also demonstrate the non-interference of similar assay targets for RPM-Flu detection and identification of multiple target gene sequences from the same specimen. the original RPM-Flu analysis on 21 Aug 2007 returned four best matching neuraminidase gene sequence records. the actual influenza type B vaccine strain was B/Jilin/20/2003, but its neuraminidase gene sequence was not entered into the GenBank database until 21 Jul 2008. the results in Table 1 are similar to those presented by Wang et al. earlier work was performed using the prototype precursor platform of the TessArray RPM-Flu 3.1. the prototype RPMv1 assay allocated only 7,691 base pairs (bp) to 9 different influenza-specific detector tiles.

USDA_8 was reported by RPM-Flu assay to be A/H11N9. the original specimen apparently represented a mixed infection of H11N9 and H9N2. the neuraminidase sequence (868 bp, C3 = 88.7) unequivocally matched A/N9. BLAST analysis of the RPM-Flu detected HA5 gene sequences from these strains returned most similar sequence records encoding a similar HP-like HA5 cleavage site motif. the hemagglutinin RPM-Flu assay-generated HA5 gene sequence for the A/H5N3 reference strain had a significant gap of uncalled bases at the HA cleavage site locus. gene sequence records returned by BLAST for HA and NA gene sequences of USDA_14 included strain A/duck/Singapore/3/1997 (H5N3) the actual reference strain submitted for RPM-Flu analysis is consistent with a low pathogenicity (LP) phenotype. the results demonstrate efficacy of RPM-Flu for unequivocal diagnostic detection and identification of human and avian influenza virus subtypes. BLAST analysis of the NS gene sequences from the 19 avian influenza specimens returned 79 most similar sequence records. for five of the 19 specimens there were no most similar NS gene sequences returned to match the specimen's actual A/HN subtype. nine of the 19 specimens had no most similar PB2 gene sequences from the same A/HN subtype (Table S8) eight samples from this previously referenced set of clinical and field specimen isolates of avian influenza virus represented subtypes A/H10N7 (4), A/H7N7 (2), A/H11 (1) or A/H13 (1). none of the 11 most similar NS gene sequence records matched the A/HN subtypes of the corresponding specimens (Table S7). an array of 11,808 resequencing oligonucleotide probes (25-mers) is an array of 11,808 resequencing oligonucleotide probes. this is the actual A/H1N1 strain of influenza virus representing the viral HA1 gene product in the 2004\u20132005 vaccine configuration. an aliquot of FluMist vaccine (2004\u20132005) was subject to RPM-Flu assay. this part of the RPM-Flu HA1(H1N1) detector tile spans the locus of the A/H1 hemagglutinin peptide cleavage site. each of the nine successive 60 bp RPM-Flu assay-detected HA1 sequence segments was subjected to BLAST alignment and similarity analysis. similar sequence records returned from BLAST analysis of assay-generated HA1, NA1, HA3, NA2, M(H1N1), M(H3N2) gene sequences, as well as type B HA, NA and M gene sequences correctly correspond to the actual influenza virus strains used in the 2004\u20132005 vaccine configuration. results also demonstrate the non-interference of similar assay targets for RPM-Flu detection and identification of multiple target gene sequences from the same specimen. new caledonia/20/1999 (H1N1) 78.2 1e-180 0/971 A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1N1) A/Canterbury/125/2005 (H3N2) 80.7 1e-180 7/999 A/Wyoming/3/2003 (H3N2) B/Malaysia/2506/2004 61.7 1e-180 3/826 B/Jilin/20/2003b Matrix genes A/ neuraminidase gene sequence was not entered into the GenBank database until 21 Jul 2008. the results of assays using inactivated influenza virus vaccines identify detected type A matrix gene sequences. the results are similar to those presented by Wang et al.

NS (H5N1) detector tile generated 109 specimen-specific NS gene sequences from several of the A/H3N2 samples. only 19 of the most NS gene sequence records were from A/H3N2 strains. circulating strains of subtype A/H3N2 harbor diverse NS gene sequences. a group of 298 specimens were analyzed using both the RPM-Flu assay and a validated benchmark RT-PCR assay for type A influenza virus. only 1 specimen was found to be negative by RPM-Flu and positive by RT-PCR. the benchmark RT-PCR type A influenza virus test does not distinguish between the A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 subtypes. however the RPM-Flu assay is capable of simultaneous and mutually exclusive identification of a detected type A influenza virus as either seasonal subtype A/H1N1 or seasonal subtype A/H3N2.

TCID50 CDCa A/Wisconsin/55/2004(H3N2) 32 EID502 TCID50 The limit of Detection (LoD) for seasonal A/H1N1 and seasonal A/H3N2 influenza viruses are presented as the number of tissue culture (TC in TCID50 units of cell culture infectivity, we estimate CDC rRT-PCR LoD results based on the results of both CDC and JBAIDS for A/Hawaii/15/2001(H1N1) Specificity Each RPM assay of a single specimen is capable of generation from hundreds to thousands of nucleotides of multiple targeted pathogen gene sequence(s) the RPM-Flu assay panel addresses 30 different categories of viruses and bacteria that are more or less likely to be encountered in specimens related to respiratory infections. each assay simultaneously enables detection and identification of targeted pathogens from one or more of 188 different target gene resequencing detector tiles. the Luminex RVP multiplex RT-PCR panel uses three of its twelve primer-probe sets to detect type A influenza virus (M gene-specific primer pair) a type A influenza virus-positive specimen may be identified in a first round RT-PCR panel followed by testing with another panel to distinguish A/H1 from A/H3. failure to establish subtype A/H1 or A/H3 in the follow-on test is a first tier screening results for possible identification of the 2009 Novel A/H1N1 influenza virus outbreak strain. utility Influenza infections do not necessarily preclude co-infection of the same individual by other viral and/or bacterial pathogens. the single specimen single aliquot RPM-Flu assay simultaneously targets 30 different categories of viruses and bacteria. this was selected as a respiratory pathogens reported to cause \u201cflu-like\u201d symptoms at some stage of human infection. within the last decade resequencing microarrays have been introduced for research applications and clinical research. it would be disappointing to anticipate that another decade or more may pass before benefits from diagnostic implementations of RPM or other highly multiplexed sequencing-based platforms can be realized in routine clinical diagnostics. the limit of Detection (LoD) for seasonal A/H1N1 and seasonal A/H3N2 influenza viruses is presented as the number of tissue culture (TCID50) or egg culture (EID50) infectious units used for each assay are shown to result in >95% positive outcomes. the recently FDA-cleared 510(k)080570 the \u201cCDC Human Influenza Virus Real-time RT-PCR Detection and Characterization Panel\u201d is a test the CDC has reported analytical LoD in terms of egg culture infectivity titers (EID50/ml) the CDC has implemented the same RT-PCR test and reported LoD in TCID50 units of cell culture infectivity. the RPM-Flu assay panel addresses 30 different categories of viruses and bacteria that are more or less likely to be encountered in specimens related to respiratory infections. each assay simultaneously enables detection and identification of targeted pathogens from one or more of 188 different target gene resequencing detector tiles. the Luminex RVP multiplex RT-PCR panel uses three of its twelve primer-probe sets to detect type A influenza virus (M gene-specific primer pair) and distinguish A/H1 from A/H3 (HA1- and HA3-specific primer pairs) the assay result is only based on a pattern of signals from a small panel of RT-PCR primer-probes. failure to establish subtype A/H1 or A/H3 in the follow-on test is a single specimen single aliquot RPM-Flu assay simultaneously targets 30 different categories of viruses and bacteria. these were selected as a respiratory pathogens reported to cause \u201cflu-like\u201d symptoms at some stage of human infection. a single specimen single aliquot RPM-Flu assay simultaneously targets 30 different categories of viruses and bacteria. it has taken almost 25 years from the first research reports of the polymerase chain reaction [25] until recent regulatory clearances have enabled introduction specific PCR- and RT-PCR-based diagnostic assays and instrumentation into clinical practice. in the last decade resequencing microarrays have been introduced for research applications and clinical research [26], [27], [28]. the type A virus subtypes of the inactivated vaccines have matrix genes and other non-HA, non-NA genes derived from the master donor strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1). the strains configured in this vaccine are A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1), A/New York/55/2004(H3N2) and B/Jiangsu/10/2003. a SNPs are single base call discrepancies between detector tile sequence and assay generated sequence from labeled target DNA. the number of detected SNPs is shown relative to the number of bases called from the detector tile as contiguous runs of three or more base calls. the strains are equivalent B/Shanghai/361/2002-like strains as also used in 2004\u20132005 vaccine configurations. 79 (51%) most similar M gene sequence records are associated with different A/HN subtypes than independently determined from each specimen's specific HA and NA gene sequences. forty-one of 63 (65%) most similar NS gene sequence records are associated with different A/HN subtypes than independently determined from each specimen's specific HA and NA gene sequences.
