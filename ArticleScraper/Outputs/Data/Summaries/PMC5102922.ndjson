{"summary": "the average time for progression to ARDS from symptom onset was 9.6 days. initial chest radiographic findings were normal (n = 2), focal opacity (n = 9), or multifocal or diffuse opacity (n = 8). patients having subsequent ARDS had a higher probability of pleural effusion. many cases of fatal adenovirus respiratory infection in immune-suppressed adults have been described in the literature. adenovirus pneumonia in patients with defective or deficient T-cell immunity, such as those with bone marrow or solid organ transplant, malignant neoplasm, or AIDS, has been reported. all patients underwent bronchoscopy with the collection of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid or lung biopsy, as well as those who underwent surgical biopsy, were stained and cultured for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. polymerase chain reaction analysis for BAL specimens and nasal or throat swabs was performed to detect viral organisms. 19 patients confirmed to have only adenovirus pneumonia were included in this study. the specimens were evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin immunohistochemical staining (10,12) in nine patients, BAL fluid was analyzed using the one-step multiplex realtime AdvanSure RV real-time PCR kit. image acquisition Initial chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans were acquired after an average of 4.4 days (range, 0 to 15 days) or 6.1 days (range, 2 to 15 days) from the commencement CT scans (114\u2013210 mA, 120 kVp, beam width of 10\u201320 mm, beam pitch of 1.375\u20131.5) were performed from the lung apices to the level of the middle portions of both kidneys. intravenous contrast medium injection was used in approximately half of the patients (10 patients), with 1.5 mL/kg (body weight) of Iomeron 300 (iomeprol, 300 mg iodine/mL; Bracco, Milan, Italy) graphic improvement, type 2 was radiographic deterioration by one peak level followed by improvement, type 3 was fluctuating radiographic changes with at least two peaks. peak level was defined as overall lung parenchymal involvement greater than 25% of the initial extent on radiography. total CT scores ranged from 0 to 24 when combined for all six zones (17,19) Statistical analysis Differences in the clinico-radiological characteristics of the patients who eventually developed ARDS (ARDS group) and those who did not (non-ARDS group) were assessed using chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, or Student's t test. patients were regarded as having ARDS when they satisfied the American-European Consensus Conference definition for the condition. no evidence of left atrial hypertension or pulmonary capillary pressure 18 mm Hg (if measured) to rule out cardiogenic edema. serial chest radiographs were acquired for all patients during hospitalization. CT studies were performed using various helical CT scanners. intravenous contrast medium injection was used in approximately half of patients. the abnormalities on initial chest radiographs were assessed as focal opacity or multifocal or diffuse opacity (15). the pattern of the disease course was identified from sequential chest radiographs as described by Wong et al. (16) the outer third of the lung was defined as peripheral, and the inner two-thirds of the lung were defined as central. the lesions were regarded as distributed in the upper lung zone when they were located above the hilum, in the lower lung zone when they were located below the hilum. diabetes mellitus in conjunction with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy. 10 patients were immunocompetent without underlying disease.

A. Chest radiograph at admission demonstrates subtle focal opacity in right upper lung zone. follow-up chest radiograph obtained after two weeks of treatment with cidofovir demonstrates disappearance of focal opacity in right upper lung zone. ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome, CT = computed tomography. the most frequent CT appearance was GGO, which was seen in all patients (n = 19), combined with other patterns such as consolidation (n = 14) and micronodules (n = 3. in the non-ARDS group, types 1 and 2 accounted for more than 85% of patients. in the non-ARDS group, types 1 and 2 accounted for more than 85% of patients. in the non-ARDS group, types 1 and 2 accounted for more than 85% of patients, and no one was classified as type 4. 9 patients with adenovirus pneumonia were immunocompromised due to underlying comorbid conditions, such as acute myeloid leukemia (n = 4), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 1), multiple myeloma (n = 1), lung adenocarcinoma (n = 1), and diabetes mellitus in conjunction with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

A. Chest radiograph at admission demonstrates subtle focal opacity in right upper lung zone (white arrow) C. Follow-up chest radiograph obtained after two weeks of treatment with cidofovir demonstrates disappearance of focal opacity in right upper lung zone, suggesting type 1 disease pattern. GO was seen in all patients (n = 19), combined with other patterns such as consolidation (n = 14) and micronodules (n = 3) parenchymal abnormalities were distributed bilaterally in 17 patients. unilateral involvement was seen in two patients. no significant difference in initial radiograph findings (p = 0.813) but the radiographic pattern of disease course differed significantly between the ARDS and non-ARDS groups. in the non-ARDS group, types 1 and 2 accounted for more than 85% of patients. no significant differences in baseline clinical characteristics between the ARDS and non-ARDS groups. progression to respiratory failure was unpredictable, showing relatively high rates (12 of 19 patients, 63%) and rapid deterioration. ARDS and non-ARDS groups showed progressive deterioration on sequential radiographs. this result is consistent with previous reports regarding prognoses of other viral pneumonias such as H1N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (16,17,23). the rate of respiratory failure in adenovirus pneumonia might have been overestimated in our study. adenovirus pneumonia may have triggered cytokine storms in patients who progressed to ARDS. but it is still difficult to explain why some individuals are susceptible to systemic inflammation, while others are resistant to it. further studies should be performed to identify the viral determinants and genetic factors associated with ARDS. adenovirus pneumonia is associated with high rates of ARDS and mortality in the single tertiary care setting. adenovirus pneumonia usually manifests as multifocal or diffuse opacity on chest radiographs. adenovirus pneumonia is associated with high rates of ARDS and mortality in the single tertiary care setting. patients with adenovirus pneumonia demonstrate rapid deterioration to ARDS regardless of age and premorbid conditions. aggressive treatment and careful follow-up are mandatory in patients with adenovirus pneumonia."}
