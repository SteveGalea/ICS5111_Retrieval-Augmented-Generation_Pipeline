{"summary": "the development of a protective vaccine against canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is an alternative approach for interrupting the domestic cycle of Leishmania infantum. the vaccine elicited an increase in both anti-saliva and anti-Leishmania IgG isotypes, higher counts of specific circulating CD8+ T cells and high NO production. a vaccine would be an important tool in the control of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) and dramatically decrease the infection pressure of L. infantum for humans [3]. a vaccine would be an important tool in the control of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) and would also dramatically decrease the infection pressure of L. infantum for humans. hamsters immunized with DNA plasmid coding LJM19 from Lutzomyia longipalpis were protected against a challenge with L. infantum plus Lu. longipalpis salivary gland sonicate. the dogs were evaluated for up to 885 days after challenge by intradermal inoculation using L. infantum promastigotes plus Lu. longipalpis. the acini of salivary glands of 4-day-old, but non-blood-fed female sand flies were dissected in 0.8% unbuffered saline, broken by sonication for 10 s. the supernatant was collected and stored at -70\u00b0C prior use. twenty male and female mongrel dogs were born and reared in the kennels of the animal science center. at the beginning of the experiments the dogs were approximately the same age (210 45 days) and had similar weights (15 5 kilograms) the dogs were randomly chosen from a set with approximately the same number of males and females and divided into four experimental groups. each group received three subcutaneous injections in the right ear. the dogs were euthanized in 885 dac and the spleen was collected to evaluate the parasite load. blood sample collection Peripheral blood (5 mL) was collected from the jugular vein of each dog. blood samples were stored at room temperature for up to 12 h prior to processing. clear cells were isolated from 20 mL of heparinised blood under 10 mL of Ficoll\u2013Hypaque density gradient (Histopaque\u00ae 1.077; Sigma Chemical Co.) the PBMCs were resuspended in Gibco RPMI1640 medium, homogenized, washed twice with RPMI 1640, centrifuged at 450 g for 10 min at room temperature, homogenized, and resuspended in canine monoclonal antibodies against CD5 (rat-IgG2a: clone YKIX322.3), CD4 (rat-IgG2a: clone YKIX302.9) and CD8 (rat-IgG1: clone YCATE55.9) were used in an indirect immunofluorescence procedure in which pooled normal rat serum (diluted 1:6000) was employed as the isotypic control. PCR conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and annealing/extension at 60\u00b0C for 1 min. the same procedure was carried out for the GAPDH gene (115-bp fragment GenBank accession number AB038240). twenty male and female mongrel dogs were born and reared in the kennels of the Animal Science Center, Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, Brazil. the dogs were treated by 7 months of age with an anthelmintic and vaccinated against rabies. dogs received 600 g of sterile 0.9% saline in 1 mL of sterile 0.9% saline. each group received three subcutaneous injections in the right ear. dogs were euthanized in 885 dac and spleen was collected. the SLiA was coated onto 96-well microplates at a concentration of 10 g/well. the wells were then washed, substrate and chromogen were added. the absorbance was read at 492 nm on a multiskan\u00ae MCC 340 microplate reader. PBMCs were cultured in 48-well flat-bottomed tissue culture plates containing 650 L of supplemented RPMI medium/well. incubation was carried out in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C for 3 days. microplate assays for immunophenotyping canine whole blood leukocytes in both fresh blood samples and PBMCs obtained after in vitro stimulation were carried out according to methods previously described by Giunchetti et al. Statistical analyses were performed using an ABI Prism 7500-Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, USA) the results were expressed as the number of amastigotes per milligram of spleen. anti-Leishmania reactivity in serum from dogs submitted to different vaccination protocols before and after intradermal challenge with L. infantum plus SGE: C (control;);
