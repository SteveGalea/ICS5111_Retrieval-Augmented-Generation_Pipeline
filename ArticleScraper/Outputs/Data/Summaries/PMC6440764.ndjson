{"summary": "measles is an acute febrile illness characterized by a high fever, conjunctivitis, coryza, cough, and a maculopapular rash. it is highly contagious and is spread by contact with droplets and aerosols containing the virus. vaccination coverage rates of at least 95% are required to interrupt transmission and eventually achieve measles elimination (6, 7) the administration of a measles-containing vaccine can result in a febrile rash-like illness with a presentation similar to that of mild measles in up to 5% of recipients. a clinical diagnosis can also be difficult in individuals who may not have typical symptoms due to preexisting antibodies from maternal immunity or immune globulin or from a previous vaccination. the availability of local, rapid, and definitive testing can be a significant cost-saving strategy. such testing facilitates prompt isolation of infectious cases using airborne precautions to interrupt transmission. a triplex real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rtRT-PCR) assay for the simultaneous detection and discrimination between vaccine and presumptive wild-type MV strains. representative sequences of the L gene from different MV genotypes were aligned for the design of primers and a hydrolysis probe that had a minor groove binding (MGB) protein. the hydrolysis probe was purchased from Applied Biosystems (ABI; Foster City, CA) Primers flanking the detection region were designed for the amplification of a longer fragment to generate plasmid clones used in the preparation of in vitro-transcribed RNA for the L and H genes from genotypes B3 and D8 and the Schwarz vaccine strain. sequence alignments were performed using the ClustalW program (BioEdit).

negative, n = 28) were tested for MV and differentiated as a wild-type strain or a vaccine strain. all samples with untypeable viruses had a very low viral load. the results were compared to the results of the newly developed triplex assay. serial dilutions of MV cultures of genotypes were obtained from NML. two locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes were designed for the differentiation of wild-type and vaccine strains. the probe for the detection of the Schwarz and Moraten vaccine strains was labeled with Cy5 as the fluorescent reporter dye and Iowa Black as the nonfluorescent quencher. scribed RNA for the L and H genes from genotypes B3 and D8 and the Schwarz vaccine strain are provided in Table 1. sequence alignments were performed using Primer Express (v3.0) software. all primers were purchased from the University Core DNA Services. the gold standard assay used for comparison of the newly developed triplex assay was adapted from a method previously described by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) the gold standard assay used for comparison of the newly developed triplex assay was adapted from a method previously described by the CDC. a one-step RT-PCR was performed using a TaqMan Fast virus one-step RT-PCR master mix (ABI), 0.8 M each sense and antisense primers, and 0.2 M probes. amplification included 45 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 3 s, followed by annealing, extension, and data acquisition at 60\u00b0C for 30 s on a 7500 Fast real-time PCR system. quantified in vitro were used to determine the analytical sensitivity by testing in triplicate in three independent runs. the 95% limits of detection (LOD 95%) were calculated by probit analysis using Microsoft Excel software, followed by rounding up the copy number. virus 6 and 7, influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus A, parainfluenza virus 3, human rhinovirus 1b, echovirus 2, coxsackievirus A16, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus serotype 4, bocavirus, human coronavirus HKU1, parvovirus B19, Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. triplex assay tested tenfold serial dilutions of MV cultures of genotypes B2, C1, C2, D2, D3, D4, and H2. genomes B1, D1, D11, and F were not available for testing. other vaccine strains, including Edmonston-derived vaccine strains, would not be identified by the vaccine probe. the CT value corresponding to the LOD 95% was calculated for each of the genotypes with the three probes. a CT cutoff of 35 was selected as the threshold. samples with CT values of less than 35 were reported as positive. the triplex assay did not amplify any other pathogens tested. 104 samples submitted for MV PCR were available for comparison. of these, 28 samples negative by the LC method were also negative by the triplex assay. the first sample had a CT value of 35.72 by the assay for the H gene and a CT value of 37.82 by the assay with the vaccine probe. the second sample had CT values of 39.28, 36.13, and negative in 3 replicates of the assay for the H gene. the second sample had CT values of 39.28, 36.13, and negative in 3 replicates of the assay for the H gene and CT values of negative, 37.66, and >40 in the gold standard and triplex assay were within 1 order of magnitude for all the genotypes tested. the triplex assay correctly identified the vaccine and wild-type strains. the triplex assay was 2, 10, and 2 copies/reaction for the probe targeting the H gene from the wild-type strain. the CT value corresponding to the LOD 95% was calculated for each of the genotypes with the three probes. a CT cutoff of 35 was selected as the threshold. the intra-assay variability was calculated using replicates within the same run and varied from 0.16% to 1.22%. the interassay variability was calculated using values obtained from the different runs and varied from 0.20% to 5.13%. at the provincial laboratory, 104 samples submitted for MV PCR were available for comparison. of these, 28 samples negative by the LC method were also negative by the triplex assay. Viruses were detected in 11 of these samples and typed as presumptive wild type by the triplex assay. the three remaining samples, of which two were untypeable, had a low viral load and were positive only by the L gene PCR using the triplex assay. the triplex assay correctly differentiated vaccine strains from presumptive wild-type isolates. /Neg/Neg 36.50 Neg C2 (103) 33.42 Neg 36.88 35.28 34.56 D2 (103) 32.72 Neg 35.30 35.07 36.06 D3 (105) 33.32 Neg 36.74 36.13 35.86 D3 (106) Neg Neg Neg 36.09 Neg D4 (103) 32.8 Neg 36.94 32.66 29.99 D4 (104) Neg Neg 36.31 36.78 D5 (103) 33.94 Neg 35.22 the number of wild-type MV infections has significantly diminished with vaccination. the relative frequency of cases where a vaccine strain is detected has increased. the failure to quickly identify a vaccine strain can lead to unnecessary quarantine, contact tracing, and measles prophylaxis in a newborn. the detection of all circulating genotypes was confirmed by the triplex assay using either virus culture or patient samples. only 7 cases of genotype D11 infection and 103 cases of G3 infection were reported worldwide between 2005 and 2014. the sensitivity for all targets was less than 10 copies/reaction for all genotypes except genotype D8 using the H gene probe. however, since the sensitivity for all targets was less than 10 copies/reaction for all genotypes except genotype D8 using the H gene probe, the assay would be positive for MV. wild-type genotype A strains no longer circulate."}
