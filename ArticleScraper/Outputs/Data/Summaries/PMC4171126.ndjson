{"summary": "FDA is responsible for regulating and ensuring the safety of over $1 trillion in consumer goods in the united states. this equates to products accounting for over 20% of every consumer dollar spent on goods in the united states. this equates to products accounting for over 20% of every consumer dollar spent on goods in the united states. medical and food products we consume and use are essential to securing health, ranging from safe and nutritious food to vaccines for preventable diseases. well-functioning regulatory systems play an essential role in global health security through securing product supply chains and minimizing threats to product safety and quality. a critical component of global health security is having available safe and effective MCMs that can counter specific threats. FDA is responsible for ensuring that MCMs are safe, effective, and secure through a range of responsibilities aimed at facilitating development and, ultimately, timely access to MCMs during emergencies. FDA engages with product sponsors throughout the development process; approves, licenses, or clears MCM marketing applications that meet applicable standards for safety and efficacy. the MCMi is coordinated through the Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats in the Commissioner's Office. the MCMi serves as a nexus for FDA's collaboration with interagency, state, and local public health and emergency responders and global partners. in some cases, the most appropriate MCMs for a response might not be approved by FDA, or might be intended to be used in ways outside of their FDA-approved labeling. in these cases, special legal preparedness tools might be needed to facilitate getting the right MCMs to the right populations without delay. even when approved MCMs are deployed, response challenges can emerge. prevent avoidable epidemics FDA engages in a number of efforts that can contribute to preventing or reducing the impact of natural, accidental, or deliberate outbreaks. a number of MCMs can be rapidly deployed to prevent or treat infectious disease or CBRN threats, thus potentially mitigating or decreasing their global burden. an EUA allows dispensing of anthrax antimicrobials as postexposure prophylaxis to the public immediately following a wide-area anthrax attack. an EUA can facilitate a US domestic response, but also allow shipment of a product authorized for use under the EUA from the US to other countries for use in those countries. in the area of detecting threats early, diagnostic devices are essential. in 2013, FDA issued EUAs for uncleared IVDs to strengthen preparedness for emerging infectious disease threats of novel influenza A (H7N9) virus and MERS-CoV. these EUAs remain in effect. crisis management serves as FDA's focal point for coordinating emergency and crisis response activities involving FDA-regulated products. product approvals are often important for response to public health emergencies when they are occurring. other public health threat product approvals include a botulism antitoxin, an antibiotic for treatment of plague, an inhalational anthrax therapeutic and a next-generation portable ventilator. can also help to address global health threats and facilitate the international sharing of MCMs. in appropriate cases, FDA can authorize a particular MCM to be used for US government personnel in other countries or by foreign laboratories. FDA has long-standing roles in MCM-related issues, ranging from early stages of product development through MCM stockpiling, use, and surveillance during public health emergencies. underlying FDA's MCM work is a strong regulatory framework and a foundation of collaboration with domestic and international partners. the goal for MCM products under development is FDA approval, licensure, or clearance. product sponsors face challenges in knowing what MCMs they should develop or how to develop specific MCMs because of uncertainties about threats to address. FDA's collective MCM roles in addressing CBRN and emerging infectious disease threats were formalized through the establishment of the MCMi. safety and biosecurity promotion (eg, through the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity) and in training efforts (eg, related to identifying and sharing best practices for ensuring data quality and integrity in high-containment BSL-3 and -4 facilities for studies being conducted to support MCM development using the Animal Rule) through the MCMi, FDA has strengthened its legal and regulatory framework for facilitating timely access to MCMs. FDA approval for market of an MCM using the Animal Rule mechanism is another example of an FDA action that could fall under preventing avoidable epidemics. it can facilitate domestic and international availability of MCMs that can be rapidly deployed to prevent or treat infectious disease or CBRN threats. FDA issued 2 EUAs for anthrax preparedness purposes before PAHPRA. both enable dispensing of anthrax antimicrobials as postexposure prophylaxis to the public. the authorization's criteria for issuance, scope, and conditions for emergency use are met. FDA can use its EUA to authorize the use of certain tests to strengthen domestic and international laboratory capacity and public health preparedness. in 2014, FDA issued EUAs for uncleared IVDs to strengthen preparedness for emerging infectious disease threats of novel influenza A (H7N9) virus and MERS-CoV. these EUAs remain in effect. FDA works closely with US and Canadian partners through the Beyond the Border Initiative. the Office of Crisis Management serves as FDA's focal point for emergency and crisis response activities involving FDA-regulated products. other public health threat product approvals include a botulism antitoxin, an antibiotic for treatment of plague, an inhalational anthrax therapeutic and a next-generation portable ventilator. FDA also has mechanisms to extend the expiration dating of certain properly stored MCMs based on scientific data. if appropriate, this can enable local, state, and federal stakeholders to use their stockpiled MCMs for a period of time beyond the labeled expiration date so as to be ready to respond rapidly during an emergency. FDA has approved a number of MCMs aimed at preventing or reducing the impact of natural, accidental, or deliberate outbreaks. in the area of influenza pandemic preparedness, seasonal influenza preparedness is critical for helping to increase and sustain pandemic influenza vaccine production capacity. for example, FDA recently approved several innovative seasonal influenza vaccines. an EUA can allow shipment of a product authorized for use under the EUA from the US to other countries for use in those countries. the authorization's criteria for issuance, scope, and conditions for emergency use are met. FDA has approved a number of diagnostic devices and authorized the emergency use of uncleared diagnostic devices for preparedness purposes. in response to the 2009-10 H1N1 influenza pandemic, FDA issued 18 EUAs for uncleared IVDs to detect the novel influenza strain. FDA is involved in a number of efforts aimed at responding rapidly and effectively to biological and other public health threats. FDA expanded the approval for use of an antiviral to treat children as young as 2 weeks of age. other public health threat product approvals include a botulism antitoxin, an antibiotic for treatment of plague, an inhalational anthrax therapeutic and a next-generation portable ventilator. the EUA or other FDA authorities have helped to inform approaches and planning efforts with global partners related to the sharing of MCMs with international partners during an emergency. monitoring and assessing MCM use and performance during an emergency can present unique challenges (eg, the product might not yet be approved or might have been approved under the Animal Rule) FDA is a key partner in the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) to track antibiotic resistance in foodborne bacteria. it has supported the WHO Advisory Group on Integrated Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AGISAR) FDA has developed the international Capacity Building Plan. the plan charts a direction for how FDA prioritizes capacity building efforts based on risk and impact on public health. a typical manufacturing company relies on more than 35 contract manufacturers internationally. authorities in paraguay notified WHO of 11 pediatric patients suffering from severe adverse events within hours of ingesting dextromethorphan. the same ingredient was identified in pakistan in 2013 during an investigation of 50 deaths. the drug alerts prompted authorities in other countries to be vigilant in testing for the presence of levomethorphan. judicious use of antimicrobials is critical to ensuring efficacy of antimicrobial drugs. judicious use of antimicrobials is critical to ensuring efficacy of antimicrobial drugs. judicious use of antimicrobials is critical to ensuring efficacy of antimicrobial drugs. up to 70% of the 1.5 billion episodes of diarrhea occurring in children under 5 every year may be caused by foodborne contaminants. under FSMA, FDA is focusing on strengthening food safety systems through efforts to ensure product safety, modernize the oversight of imported foods, guard against intentional contamination. manufacturing company relies on more than 35 contract manufacturers internationally. a major threat to global health is falsified, substandard, and counterfeit medical products. a high prevalence of unsafe, poor quality medicines in the market results in inadequate treatment of patients, poisoning, toxicity, and erosion of public trust. FDA's robust regulatory authorities and application of innovative regulatory science are employed domestically, are shared internationally, and demonstrate some of FDA's critical contributions to global health security. authors thank Mary Lou Valdez, MSM, associate commissioner for international programs; Luciana Borio, MD, assistant commissioner for counterterrorism policy and acting Deputy Chief Scientist."}
