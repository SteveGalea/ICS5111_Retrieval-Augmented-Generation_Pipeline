{"summary": "human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a -herpesvirus characterized by its restricted host range. it has double-stranded linear DNA mixed with a matrix protein. a primary infection is likely to be followed by lifelong persistence of the virus in a latent phase. the interest in HCMV as a major pathogen to humans has remained high. no significant differences between recombinant gB vaccine and placebo recipients in a randomized, double-blind, Phase II clinical trial of seronegative woman of childbearing age. results raised doubt whether using one of the envelope glycoproteins alone as a vaccine would induce broad enough neutralizing antibody responses to prevent intrauterine transmission in all instances. a significant proportion of CMV-specific T cell responses showed polyfunctional phenotypes thought to be crucial for protective immune responses. DNA vaccines, based on gB, pp65 and IE1 antigens (trivalent vaccine), have been evaluated in human clinical studies. however, the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines was low when tested alone in humans. group of mice immunized with either DNA alone or HCMV viral stock alone were used as the controls. results from this study will help identify the optimal prime-boost combination to maximize immune responses against HCMV. the first DNA vaccine expresses HCMV protein UL55 (gB) the gB protein encodes the full length (907 amino acids) gB protein, which is further glycosylated and is expected to have a molecular weight of 170 kD. western blot results showed that a gB-s design led to significant amounts of secreted, truncated gB protein. secreted gB-s showed less cleavage than gB-s in cell lysate. full length gB, only detectable in cell lysate, mainly produces the gp55 and a number of lower molecular weight bands. rabbits were immunized with plasmid DNA administered to individual animal at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6. pJW4303 (negative control), pJW4303/gB and pJW4303/gB-s were incubated with 100 pfu of AD169 virus before the mixture was used to infect human primary fibroblasts. expression of pp65, pp150, and IE1/exon 4 proteins was clearly detected but only in cell lysate. expression of pp65 or IE1.4 proteins showed a single band of expected molecular weight for both antigens. expression of pp65 or IE1.4 proteins showed a single band of expected molecular weight for both antigens. s was analyzed in supernatants (S) and lysates (L) from 293T cells. supernatant and lysate from 293T cells transfected with vector alone was used as negative control. immunogenicity of these T cell immunogens was tested individually in mice. 150 or vector alone were stimulated with rVV-pp65 (A) or rVV-pp150 (B) as control all immunization groups were stimulated with VV-WR. levels of specific CD8+T cells shown as percentage of IFN-gamma positive CD8+T cells (B) or IFN-gamma positive CD4+ T cells (D) +T cells in two immunization groups demonstrated as percentage of IFN-gamma positive CD8+T cells (B) or IFN-gamma positive CD4+ T cells (D) in response to rVV-pp150 or VV-WR. a pilot prime-boost study compared relative immunogenicity between homologous and heterologous prime-boost approaches. HCMV vaccine was used to boost mice primed with either the gB/gM/gN DNA formulation or the pp65/pp150/IE1.4 DNA formulation (heterologous prime-boost) three other groups received three times either DNA alone or HCMV alone immunizations (heterologous prime-boost) three-time DNA alone immunizations elicited high levels of gB-specific antibody responses. twice DNA priming immunizations followed by one-time HCMV boost was able to further increase the antibody responses by another 1.5 logs. one-time HCMV immunization following twice empty DNA prime was not able to elicit high-level gB antibody responses. the main role of gN is to be part of the gM/gN immunogen. it is difficult to detect antibodies against gN alone. we used IFN-gamma ELISPOT as the biomarker. negative control splenocytes from nave mouse were used as negative control. the mean numbers of antigen-specific spot forming cells were plotted. the student T test was used to compare frequencies between groups and p values are depicted in the panel. the overall IFN-gamma ELISPOT response to another T cell antigen, IE1.4, was lower than observed for gB- or pp65-specific IFN-gamma ELISPOT responses. SPOT response was detected in mice that received either the pp65/pp150/IE1.4 DNA vaccine combination (with or without HCMV boost) or HCMV alone vaccine when stimulated with rVV-pp150. stimuling splenocytes from immunized mice with VV-WR did not lead to positive detection of IFN-gamma responses for gB, pp65, or IE1.4 antigens. HCMV strain AD169 was used as the source to clone antigen genes for the construction of DNA vaccines. the expression of HCMV gene DNA vaccines was tested in a transient transfection system in 293T cells and verified by western blot analysis. HCMV protein UL55 (gB) is a well characterized target of protective antibodies against HCMV. the gB protein can be further cleaved intracellularly into two subunits, gp116 and gp55. the transmembrane subunit gp55 anchors the gB protein on the surface of HCMV viral particles. s showed less cleavage than gB-s in cell lysate. the full length gB, only detectable in cell lysate, produces the gp55 and a number of lower molecular weight bands but not the distinctive gp116 unit. the full length gB DNA vaccine elicited higher neutralizing antibodies than the gB-s DNA vaccine. another HCMV envelope glycoprotein pair, UL100 (gM) and UL73 (gN) was also used in the current study. antigen expression by pp65 and pp150 DNA vaccines was detected by pooled murine antiserum from group immunized with DNA-pp65 (B) or group immunized with DNA-pp150 vaccine (C) was detected by pooled murine antiserum from group immunized with DNA-pp65 (B) or group immunized with DNA-pp150 vaccine (C), respectively. intracellular cytokine staining was conducted to measure CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses elicited by these two DNA vaccines. in mice immunized with pp65 DNA vaccine, the CD8+ T cell responses were much stronger (8%) than the CD4+ T cell responses (just over 0.5%). levels of specific CD8+T cells shown as percentage of IFN-gamma positive CD8+T cells (B) or IFN-gamma positive CD4+ T cells (D) in response to rVV-pp65 or VV-WR in two immunization groups. numbers on the CD8+ and CD4+T plots denote percentage of the population expressing IFN-gamma (A and C) a live attenuated HCMV vaccine was tested as the boosting vaccination. three other groups received three times either DNA alone or HCMV alone immunizations. the last group is a control group that received the empty DNA vector as the prime and HCMV as the boost. the selection of gB and gM proteins as antigens was based on previous studies showing them as the main targets for neutralizing antibodies. recombinant gB produced in the lysate of 293T cells was used as the coating antigen. a synthetic peptide representing the known key gM epitope was used as the coating antigen. unization following twice empty DNA prime was not able to elicit high-level gB antibody responses. three times DNA immunization alone was not able to elicit significant gM antibody responses. cell immune responses were detected in the group of mice that received three-time immunizations with the gB/gM/gN DNA vaccine formulation. however, three-time immunizations with HCMV did not elicit high levels of gB-specific T cell immune responses. responses were only slightly higher than those observed in mice that received one-time immunization after empty DNA vector prime. T cell responses to pp65 were very similar to gB-specific T cell responses. HCMV vaccine alone was not able to elicit high-level T cell responses. responses were only slightly higher than one-time HCMV immunization. Detection of IE1.4-SCs producing IFN-gamma measured by ELISpot assay (A) and enumeration of IE1.4-SCs (B) an example of the spots generated in response to VV-IE1.4 is represented for four groups of mice immunized with: 3x DNA-1 alone (pp65/pp150/IE1.4) gB pp65 IE1.4 DNA-g (gB/gM/gN) alone 185 12.9 N/A N/A DNA-g (gB/gM/gN)+CMV 510 62.18 N/A N/A DNA-p (pp65/pp150/IE1.4) alone N/A 316 105.7 68 35.07 DNA-p (pp65/pp150/IE1.4)+CMV N/A 740 89.44 54 these strains no longer have endocytic tropism and are not actively shed or have the virulence of natural isolates which possess the UL/b\u2019 region. reconstitution of bacterial artificial chromosome forms of Rhesus or human CMV which have deletions in the UL/b\u2019 region was shown to restore virulence and the capacity to infect through the endocytic pathway. in humans was poor, similar to reports of other human DNA vaccine studies. since 2008, several groups have demonstrated that DNA vaccines are effective in priming host immune responses. this type of \u201cheterologous prime-boost\u201d vaccination strategy has been shown even with non-DNA vaccination approaches. the difference may be related to the high number of antigens included in the HCMV viral stock, preventing the boost from being \u201cfocused\u201d there is a competition against various HCMV antigens that was not included in the priming formulation thus, reducing the power of boost. homologous or heterologous prime-boost approaches were tested. no functional antibodies were tested due to limited amounts of immune sera obtained from a mouse study. e virus was previously demonstrated that the Towne vaccine mostly induces sustained IE-dominant T cell responses and low IFN-gamma responses to pp65 stimulation36. however, it was surprising that our DNA prime-Towne virus boost formulation simultaneously enhanced T cell response specific to pp65 antigen and induced detectable IE-specific T cell responses against IE1. despite the fact that DNA vaccines are less immunogenic in humans, we prove their potential as effective priming immunogens. despite the fact that DNA vaccines are less immunogenic in humans, here we prove their potential as effective priming immunogens. gene encoding gB-full length, pp65, and pp150 antigens were amplified directly with indicated primers. gene encoding IE1.4 was amplified with semi-nested PCR using CMVIE1\u20131 and CMVIE1\u20132 for the first round of amplification. monoclonal antibody p63-27 was applied for detection of IE1.4 antigen. animal immunization Female BALB/c mice, 6\u20138 weeks of age, were purchased from Taconic Farms and housed in the facility of Department of Animal Medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. of 293 T cells transfected with gB (diluted 1:10) and synthetic peptide representing the highly immunogenic site of gM were used as antigens. one hundred microliters of gB protein (1 g/ml) or gM peptide (4 g/ml) were added to each well. plates were washed 3 times with sterile Dulbecco PBS (Gibco #14190-144) and blocked with 200 l/well of RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. fresh splenocytes were added to each well at a concentration of 106 cells in 100 l volume of complete RPMI medium. different recombinant vaccinia virus stocks were diluted to a final concentration at 107 pf antigen-specific T cells were calculated by subtracting the value of negative control wells where cells were infected with the regular vaccinia virus that does not express HCMV antigens. significance levels were set at a p value less than 0.05. gene encoding gB-full length, pp65, and pp150 antigens were amplified directly with indicated primers. the gene encoding the gB-s fragment was first amplified with pair of primers specific for full length gB: CMV gB-1/CMV gB-2 and then re-amplified with CMVIE1\u20132 primers. monoclonal antibody p63-27 was applied for detection of IE1.4 antigen. animals were immunized with a Helios gene gun (Bio-Rad Laboratories #165\u20132431) each mouse received two or three bi-weekly immunizations. gB protein (1 g/ml) or gM peptide (4 g/ml) was dissolved in sterile DMSO. the endpoint titer was calculated as the serum dilution resulting in absorbance greater than 2 standard deviations above the absorbance. plates were washed 3 times with sterile Dulbecco PBS (Gibco #14190-144) and blocked with 200 l/well of RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. fresh splenocytes were added to each well at a concentration of 106 cells in 100 l volume of complete RPMI medium. different recombinant vaccinia virus stocks were diluted to a final concentration at 107 pf the results were demonstrated as number of IFN-gamma spot-forming cells (SFC) per 106 splenocytes. antigen-specific T cells were calculated by subtracting the value of negative control wells where cells were infected."}
