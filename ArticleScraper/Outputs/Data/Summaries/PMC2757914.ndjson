{"summary": "american robin (Turdus migratorius) was out of place a few years ago. this species is normally found in North America and only very rarely shows up on the other side of the pond. despite metaphorical similarities with the robin case, the response to emerging infectious disease is almost always much slower. high-quality field guides allow one to place an organism such as a bird into the context of what is known about its relatives. a good field guide provides information on how to identify particular types (e.g., species) of those organisms. a field guide to microbes would be valuable in the study of emerging infectious diseases."}
