{"summary": "a large number of antibodies for EBOV have been described.47,48 Here we focus on a handful to illustrate key points. antibody therapies likely work by preventing viral entry and/or activation of host complement, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) or other functions related to the antibody Fc region. SUDV-specific mAbs 16F6 (murine) and similar synthetic human mAbs can neutralize infection by nearly two logs at midnanomolar concentrations. postexposure protection of NHPs by any antibody therapy has yet to be demonstrated for SUDV. ISA suggests they also bind SUDV GP in a similar location. the two structural epitopes overlap by 10 residues. a potential strategy for isolating additional neutralizing antibodies would be to target specifically this region on GP. antibodies against the glycan cap and mucin-like domains (e.g., 13F6 and 14G7) provide in vivo protection. but usually appear non-neutralizing in vitro, possibly due to the removal of their epitopes through cathepsin cleavage. a potential mechanism for KZ52 is to act as a \u201cstaple\u201d locking the two subunits together in the prefusion form. this mechanism would posit that KZ52 must remain bound to GP throughout maturation of the endosome, presumably to the lysosome where the viral particle is degraded before it has a chance to infect. human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) fusion inhibitor Fuzeon (enfurvitide/T-20) works by binding the NHR segments during the extended/pre-hairpin intermediate and preventing formation of the six-helix bundle that is critical for membrane fusion. this approach has been applied to several class I viruses and similar concepts have been applied to class II viruses. the antiviral activity of these endosome-targeting peptides is dependent on both the Tat sequence and the native EBOV CHR sequence. however, the concentrations of peptide required for substantial reduction in viral infection are likely too high for the C-peptide to be of clinical relevance. MARV does not produce a -peptide (C-terminal cleavage product of sGP secreted by sGP) -peptides specifically inhibited entry by Ebolaviruses and Marburg virus. cyanovirin N (CVN) is a small 10 kDa glycan-binding protein that binds mannose-containing oligosaccharides and inhibits viral entry of diverse enveloped viruses. s against the filoviruses have been described, some with demonstrated efficacy in nonhuman primates. some compounds fall into a broad range of mechanistic classes, perhaps the most advanced being polymerase inhibitors;79 we focus on entry inhibitors. catL knockout mice are still susceptible to EBOV infection and death. a potential requirement for filovirus entry inhibitors is potent, broad-spectrum inhibition of cysteine proteases residing in the endocytic pathway of all cells. potential disadvantage may be toxicity due to loss of host protease function. 80% of mice pretreated with LJ001 survived a lethal dose of mouse-adapted EBOV challenge. the results provide proof that a general membrane-targeted reagent could serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral. both genetic and chemical ablations of this interaction have been shown to reduce infectivity in vitro. cationic amphiphiles have been isolated from multiple screens of FDA-approved drugs. cationic amphiphiles have been shown to have similar activities. amiodarone,93 used to treat cardiac arrhythmias, and other ion channel inhibitors. Yermolina et al. reported a newly developed antifiloviral screening system based on EBOV-GP pseudotyped HIV particles to identify compound 8a, which selectively inhibited EBOV and MARV infection in human cells. a challenge moving forward will be to identify similar treatments for other filoviruses. filovirus C-peptides have the added complication that they must be delivered to endosomes of susceptible cell types at high enough levels to induce a therapeutic effect. cationic peptides in general suffer from high systemic toxicity. strategies that seek to disrupt these specific steps in the pathway have all been validated in vitro, and some in vivo, paving the way for other structural and chemical approaches."}
