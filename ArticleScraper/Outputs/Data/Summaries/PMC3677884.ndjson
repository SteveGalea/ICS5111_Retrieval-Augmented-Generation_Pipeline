{"summary": "CRT is a 46 kDa ca2+-binding glycoprotein in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells [1]\u2013[2]. it folds into 3 domains including a lectin-like globular N domain (amino acid residues 18\u2013197), a proline-rich P domain (residues 198\u2013308) and a Ca2+-binding C domain (residues 309 the sequence of rCRT/39-272 encompasses most of the globular N domain [18], [19], and we have previously shown that it possess lectin-like activity (selective binding with polysaccharides including carrageenan, alginic acids, and hyaluronic acids in ELISAs) rCRT/39-272 is substantially more potent than free LPS and rCRT alone. soluble rCRT and nCRT Native CRT were extracted from mouse livers by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation followed by ion exchange chromatography on a DEAE-A50 column using a linear gradient of 280\u2013500 mM NaCl for elution. samples of the eluted fractions were assayed by SDS-PAGE. samples of rCRT, rCRT/18-412, BSA and rEGFP were loaded in lanes, flow through (binding buffer), wash through (20 mM imidazole), resultant rCRT/18-412 (300 mM imidazole) and stripping through were loaded in the order of 1\u20136 into a SDS-PAGE 12% gel followed by CBB staining. the secondary Ab was HRP-labeled goat-anti- rCRT/39-272 was as effective as rCRT/39-272 in inducing NO2 production by mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro. nCRT was also able to activate macrophages in vitro, but with a 50-100-fold lower potency than rCRT/18-412. rCRT/18-412, rCRT/39-272, nCRT or rEGFP (0.01\u20131 M) for 24 hrs. concentration of NO2 in the culture supernatant was then determined using Griess Reagent. results are expressed as mean concentration (pg/ml)SD. the resultant antisera (Cp32-Abs) were able to recognize the immunizing protein band, but not the rCRT-60 kDa and rCRT-46 kDa bands, in WB. the MS result identified Cp32 as bacterial 50S ribosomal protein L2 (RPL2). it is noteworthy that rRPL2 was unable to activate macrophages, as evidence in NO2 production assays. a sample of rCRT/18-412 was loaded on to a Sephadex G-75 column 802 cm, followed by elution using 0.9% NaCl at the speed of 20 ml/h collecting 2 ml fractions. the resultant monomers MrCRT-60 kDa (Fractions 13\u201316) and MrCRT-46 kDa (Fractions 22\u201326) were further analyzed using CBB-stained SDS- we combined fractions 6\u20138 as OrCRTs, fractions 13\u201316 as MrCRT-60 kDa and fractions 19\u201326 as MrCRT-46 kDa. rCRT-46 kDa is a degradation product of rCRT-60 kDa less the C-terminal 26 amino acid residues. rCRTs were modestly more effective than unfractionated rCRT/18-412. samples of rCRT/18-412, OrCRT, MrCRT-60, MrCRT-46, nCRT and rEGFP were titrated against freshly prepared mouse peritoneal macrophages in 96-well plates. after 24 h incubation, concentrations of TNF-(A) and NO2 (B) in the culture supernatant were determined using ELISA kit or Griess reagent. rCRT-N (residues 18\u2013197, full length N domain), rCRT/120-250 (partial N, half P domains), rCRT/150-230 (partial N, one third P domains), and rCRT/198-308 (full length P domain) all, but rCRT/198-308 (very low yield and poor solubility), were successfully expressed in E. coli and affinity-purified. rCRT fragments, including rCRT/39-272 (Lane 1), rCRT/120-250 (Lane 2), rCRT/150-230 (Lane 3) and rCRT-N (Lane 4), were analyzed using a SDS-PAGE 12% gel in the presence, or absence, of -ME. the results are expressed as mean concentration (M)SD.
