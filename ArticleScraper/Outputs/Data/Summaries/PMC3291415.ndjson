{"summary": "mandatory case reporting and isolating patients during 1918 pandemic did not stop virus transmission. in canada, the medical officer concluded that forced home isolation of patients, posting signs on houses, and \"quarantine\" captured only 60% of patients in the community because of diagnostic difficulties involving mild cases and failure to notify authorities. all ill persons with \"simple colds\" or suspected influenza were immediately isolated in hospitals or sent home. from October 17 to November 8, 1918, 26 of 685 men in section A had influenza. new cases ceased in section B after daily inspection and patient isolation were implemented. despite the propensity of influenza epidemics to be amplified in primary schools, data on the effectiveness of school closures are limited. despite the propensity of influenza epidemics to be amplified in primary schools, data on the effectiveness of school closures are limited. public health interventions included closing schools, swimming pools, and disinfecting taxis, buses, and public places. a high percentage of people wore masks in public and washed hands frequently, and in general, much less social mixing occurred. the 1918 influenza pandemic was well established in Lom\u00e9 by October (10) measures for persons entering or exiting an infected area In australia in 1919, political tensions arose among state governments. issues included delayed disease reporting by the initially affected state, controls at interstate borders, resistance to quarantine measures, impoundment of the transcontinental train in the state of Western Australia, and conflict between national and state authorities in the federal system. in the united states, some towns in Colorado and Alaska implemented measures, such as a 5-day quarantine on entering travelers, to exclude infected people. in the united states, some towns in Colorado and Alaska implemented measures, such as a 5-day quarantine on entering travelers. unsuccessful containment could be contained after 200 cases had been detected. disease containment would be 98% if R0 = 1.4 and 57% if R0 = 1.7. no controlled studies assess efficacy of mask use in preventing transmission of influenza viruses. 76% of residents reported wearing masks in public during the 2003 epidemic. a case-control study found that handwashing is a protective effect in reducing upper respiratory infections. most infections were likely viral, but only a small percentage were due to influenza. mandatory case reporting and isolating patients during 1918 pandemic did not stop virus transmission. in canada, the medical officer of health for the province of Alberta concluded that forced home isolation of patients, posting signs on houses, and \"quarantine\" captured only 60% of patients in the community because of diagnostic difficulties involving mild cases. a total of 26 of 685 men in section A had influenza from October 17 to November 8, 1918. new cases ceased in section B after daily inspection and patient isolation were implemented. a review of ship epidemics in 1918 and 1919 indicates that daily temperature checks and immediate isolation of patients did not completely prevent transmission. reporting and isolating patients during the 1918 influenza pandemic did not stop virus transmission. in canada, the medical officer of health for the province of Alberta concluded that forced home isolation of patients, posting signs on houses, and \"quarantine\" captured only 60% of patients in the community because of diagnostic difficulties involving mild cases. a total of 26 of 685 men in section A had influenza (attack rate 39/1,000) from October 17 to November 8, 1918, a total of 26 of 685 men in section A had influenza (attack rate 39/1,000), which was one tenth the attack rate for section B (398/1,000, 93/234 men). new cases ceased in section B after daily inspection and patient isolation were implemented. despite the propensity of influenza

effectiveness of school closures are limited. universal influenza vaccination of children is controversial, but its use has provided data that help assess the potential effect of reducing transmission by schoolchildren. in 1968\u20131969, when 86% of its schoolchildren were vaccinated against influenza, the small town of Tecumseh, Michigan, had one third the illness rate of nearby towns where children were not vaccinated (18). in china, when most schoolchildren were vaccinated against influenza (1962\u20131987), excess death in the entire population decreased 3- to 4-fold and avoiding crowding tended to appear first in army units, schools, and other groups where contact was close. avoiding crowding could reduce peak incidence of an epidemic and spread it over many, rather than a few weeks. despite the propensity of influenza epidemics to be amplified in primary schools, data on the effectiveness of school closures are limited. universal influenza vaccination of children is

show a protective effect of handwashing in reducing upper respiratory infections. no controlled studies assess the efficacy of mask use in preventing transmission of influenza viruses. in australia, mask-wearing by healthcare workers was thought to be protective. in the united states, persons also wore masks as a protective measure. most of the infections studied were likely viral, but only a small percentage were due to influenza. only 1 study (in Pakistan) has been conducted on the effect of handwashing on severe disease. the pandemic-alert period is characterized by limited and highly localized human-to-human transmission. aggressive measures should be accompanied by restrictions on movement in and out of affected communities and consideration of geographically targeted antiviral therapy. these measures, however, are considered much less likely to be feasible in an urban population (1,3,27) the pandemic subtype may behave differently than previous pandemic or seasonal strains. such studies will be needed throughout the pandemic period to determine if these factors are changing. aggressive interventions to isolate patients and quarantine contacts would probably be ineffective, not a good use of limited health resources. the legal authority and procedures for implementing interventions should be understood by key personnel before a pandemic begins. the need is urgent for additional research on transmission characteristics of influenza viruses. such research should include epidemiologic and virologic studies and field assessments of effectiveness and cost. populations in countries with cases should be asked to defer nonessential domestic travel to affected parts of the country. countries with cases may introduce exit screening measures for departing travelers. such measures are disruptive and costly, as influenza viruses can be carried by asymptomatic persons. s first two weeks of illness and voluntary quarantine of symptomatic persons for one week. populations in countries with cases should be asked to defer nonessential domestic travel. countries with cases may introduce exit screening measures for departing travelers."}
