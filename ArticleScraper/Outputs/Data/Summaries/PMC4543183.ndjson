{"summary": "study included 142 children 2 years of age hospitalized for LRTIs with at least one virus identified as the cause. it classified them into children diagnosed with LRTIs with wheezing (n=70) and those diagnosed with LRTIs without wheezing (n=72) no significant differences were detected between the two groups. children diagnosed with LRTIs with wheezing would be more likely to develop recurrent wheezing and/or asthma in late childhood than those with LRTIs without wheezing. previous studies have reported risk factors for young children who are more likely to have wheezing during or following a viral LRTI6,7). infants and young children were excluded if (1) they were infected with mycoplasma pneumoniae, defined as an initial indirect microparticle agglutinin method (Serodia-Myco II, Fujirebio, Japan) no virus was detected, (3) their parents or guardians did not respond to questionnaires regarding the patient's past and parental history. nasopharyngeal aspirates tested for respiratory syncytial viruses (A and B), human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza (A, B, and C) virus, coronavirus, and adenovirus. total viral RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal aspirates (300 L) using Viral Gene-spin Viral DNA/RNA Extraction kits. the amplified products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels containing 0.5 g/mL ethidium bromide. statistical analysis Data are expressed as meanstandard deviation unless otherwise indicated. infants and young children were excluded if (1) they were infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, defined as an initial indirect microparticle agglutinin method (Serodia-Myco II, Fujirebio, Japan) no virus was detected, (3) their parents or guardians did not respond to questionnaires regarding the patient's past and parental history. total viral RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal aspirates (300 L) using Viral Gene-spin Viral DNA/RNA Extraction Kits. first-strand cDNA was synthesized using Seeplex Respiratory Viruses Detection Kits-1. each 20 L reaction mixture included 3 L of cDNA, 4 L of 5 RV1A or 5 RV1B primer, and 10 L of 2 Multiplex Master Mix. statistical analysis Data are expressed as meanstandard deviation unless otherwise indicated. between-group differences were compared using independent Student t tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, or chi-square tests, as appropriate.

LRTIs with wheezing were significantly more common in children with wheezing than in those with the LRTIs without wheezing. there were no between-group differences in the incidence of each virus (P>0.05 each) multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that wheezing was strongly associated with parental history of allergic diseases (aOR, 20.19; 95% CI, 3.22-126.48), past history of allergic diseases (aOR, 13.95; 95% CI, 1.34-145.06), past history of hospitalization for respiratory illnesses (aOR, 21.36; 95% CI, 3.77-120.88) and total eosinophil count. 70 children with LRTIs with wheezing and 72 children with LRTIs without wheezing were 7.05.4 and 8.35.9 months respectively. there were no between-group differences in sex, age, absolute neutrophil count, CRP concentration, and ESR. eosinophil count (cells/mm3) 155.8219.3 90.7125.9 0.031 C-reactive protein (mg/dL) 17.612.7 22.519.3 0.073 Parental history of allergic diseases 15 (21.4) 2 (2.8) 0.001 Past history of hospitalization for respiratory illnesses 15 (21.4) 2 (2.8) 0.001 Secondhand smoke at home 37 (52.9) 7 (9.7) 0.001 Values are presented as number (%) or mean the rates of doctor-diagnosed asthma (7.1% [5/70] vs. 0% [0/72], P=0.019) and doctor-diagnosed atopic dermatitis (8.6% [6/70] vs. 1.4% [1/72], P=0.046) were significantly higher in children with wheezing than those without wheezing. past history of hospitalization for respiratory illnesses (21.4% [15/70] vs. 2.9% [2/ there were no between-group differences in the incidence of each virus (P>0.05 each) children less than 2 years of age hospitalized with lower respiratory tract infections with and without wheezing. aORs (95% CIs) P value Male sex 1.44 (0.49-4.25) 0.506 Age 1.12 (0.96-1.31) 0.154 Parental history of allergic diseases 20.19 (3.22-126.48) 0.001 Past history of allergic diseases 13.95 (1.34-145.06) 0.027 Past history of hospitalization due to respiratory illnesses 21.36 (3.77-120.88) 0.001 Total eosinophil count 1.01 (1.01-1.02) 0.003 the development of wheezing in children with LRTIs with wheezing may be an early manifestation of Th2-biased immune response to viral respiratory infections. the interaction between age at initial infection, genetic susceptibility, and virus will determine the outcome of respiratory virus infection and airway disorders. the interaction between age at initial infection, genetic susceptibility, and virus will determine the outcome of respiratory virus infection and airway disorders. eezing may demonstrate Th2-type response, whereas those without wheezing demonstrate Th1-type response. this is also supported by the higher incidence of past and parental history of allergic diseases in children with wheezing. this may be ascribed to the fact that they are most likely sensitizers to wheezing in children hospitalized for LRTIs. this may be ascribed to the fact that they are the most likely sensitizers to wheezing in the study subjects."}
