{"summary": "PHEV is a nonsegmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA coronavirus. it belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) piglets exhibit vomiting and wasting disease (VWD) and/or encephalomyelitis. membranous coating-mediated endo- and exocytosis can be employed by PHEV for its transsynaptic transfer. a detailed and comprehensive study of the endocytic mechanism involved in PHEV uptake was urgently needed. most animal viruses gain access to target cells by hijacking host endocytic pathways. caveola/raft-dependent endocytosis is characterized as specialized lipid raft domains composed of caveolin and high levels of cholesterol (21) the pathway requires unique structural and signaling machinery and is involved in internalization of some envelope viruses. some viruses can induce macropinocytosis as a direct endocytic route for productive entry and infection (25\u201328) neuro-2a cells were inoculated with purified PHEV virions for 30 min on ice. we then used thin-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to detect the course of PHEV entry visually. the time required for PHEV entry was estimated to be approximately 60 min. membranous coating-mediated endo- and exocytosis can be used by PHEV for invasion and cellular transfer. neuro-2a cells were incubated with PHEV and fixed at the indicated time for an IFA using anti-PHEV-S antibodies. the protein was transported from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments after incubation with PHEV at 37\u00b0C for 4 h. after an additional 8 h of incubation, vesicles were less visible within the cytoplasm and instead were clustered near the cell surface. early endosomal autoantigen 1 (EEA1) is a membrane tethering factor required for the fusion and maturation of EEs in endocytosis. PHEV internalization decreased to less than 40% of the level found in untreated cells. both reagents inhibited viral protein synthesis even at low concentrations. the relative infection rates of PHEV as monitored by IFA were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. dynamin-2 (DNM-2), a 100-kDa GTPase responsible for endocytosis, plays an essential role in cellular membrane fission during vesicle formation. neuro-2a cells were pretreated with 0, 10, or 20 M dynasore for 1 h at 37\u00b0C before PHEV infection. treatment of neuro-2a cells with 20 M dynasore resulted in a decrease of over 80% in PHEV internalization the dominant negative (DN) K44A mutant of dynamin-2 (Dyn2K44A) was previously described to have decreased GTPase activity resulting in reduced endocytosis. when Neuro-2a cells overexpressing EGFP-Dyn2K44A were infected 24 h later with PHEV, they showed a decrease of nearly 85% in PHEV infection. tagged wild-type dynamin-2 (Dyn2wt), wild-type dynamin-2 (Dyn2K44A), wild-type dynamin-2 (Dyn2K44A), wild-type Eps15 (Eps15wt), or DN mutant Eps15 (Eps95/295) twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were infected and processed for confocal microscopy analysis. PHEV was significantly decreased, to 10.6%, at 50 M, the highest working concentration of CPZ. the drug stimulation significantly suppressed viral genome replication and protein translation levels as determined by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting. neuro-2a cells were transfected with clathrin prior to incubation. colocalized signals were widely observed using confocal microscopy. inhibition of PHEV internalization and replication was assessed. PHEV entry assays were performed on transfected Neuro-2a cells. siCHC specifically decreased the expression of CHC. viral internalization and proliferation were reduced in a dose-dependent manner. PHEV entry into neuro-2a cells can occur efficiently via CME. distinct endocytic compartment structures were labeled for PHEV (green) and CTB (red) in our study, showing the sorting of these two ligands for delivery to distinct endosomal populations. PHEV and CTB take different intracellular targeting routes to the Golgi apparatus or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) PHEV entry was assessed in cells treated with DMSO (control), MCD (5 mM), Nys/Prog (30/10 M) or genistein (100 M) for 60 min. surface-bound virus was removed, and the cells were fixed and visualized. siCav1-transfected cells were incubated with PHEV for 24 h. the cells were then fixed, stained with anti-Cav1 and anti-PHEV antibodies. the cells were then fixed, stained with anti-Cav1 and anti-PHEV antibodies. PHEV entry is dependent on the fluidity of cholesterol but does not involve caveola/lipid raft-dependent endocytosis. macropinocytosis is a unique mode of endocytosis that has received increasing attention because of its roles in immune defense. PHEV entry into neuro-2a cells is dependent on the cytoskeleton. cells were infected with diD-labeled PHEV (red) at 37\u00b0C for the indicated times. at 10 min postinfection, multiple virus particles (red) bound to actin-rich protrusions. neuro-2a cells were incubated under control conditions or pretreated with CytoD at 50 M for 1 h. in the uptake assays, Dx-AF488 was added for 30 min on ice. cells took on a more rounded shape with a smooth margin. transient blebs filled with actin formed at the cell surface. cytochalasin D (CytoD) reversibly induces depolymerization of existing filaments. neuro-2a cells were pretreated with CytoD or 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA) at the indicated concentrations for 1 h. PHEV internalization was blocked when actin polymerization was inhibited. actin is specific to the very early stage of virus internalization, that is, before 1 h postinoculation. the minimal set of requirements to satisfy the definition of virus macropinocytosis have been outlined. we used the inhibitor EIPA, which specifically inhibits the exchange of intracellular H+ with external Na+, to clarify the role of macropinocytosis. neuro-2a cells were transfected with plasmids expressing EGFP-tagged Rab5 and Rab7 WT, AN, and DN constructs and then incubated with Tf-AF488 for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. at 24 hpi, cells were fixed, probed with anti-PHEV-S antibody, and visualized by confocal microscopy. arithmetic means of data from three independent experiments are shown. we transfected Neuro-2a cells with EGFP-Rab5S34N and EGFP-Rab7T22N. the uptake of the Tf-AF488 tracer was reduced when these mutants were overexpressed. these results were confirmed by qRT-PCR and IFA. we observed a significant reduction in viral entry and infectivity in siRab-transfected cells. this suggests the involvement of Rab5- and Rab7-mediated transport in PHEV internalization and productive infection. PHEV infection requires trafficking through EEs and LEs. percentages of DiD-PHEV colocalized with endosomal markers EGFP-Rab5wt and EGFP-Rab7wt. depletion has a larger effect than that of Rab7 depletion on PHEV entry and transport. we examined the possibility that PHEV may facilitate Rab5 activity during internalization and intracellular trafficking. we then performed a GST-R5BD pulldown assay to determine the relative amount of Rab5-GTP underlying PHEV infection. guanosine gamma thiophosphate (GTPS) was added to activate small G proteins as a positive control. PHEV rapidly upregulated activation of endogenous Rab5 at 1 h postinfection. neuro-2a cell lysates containing coexpressed GFP-Rab5 and GST-R5BD were immunoprecipitated. cells expressing Rab5wt, Rab5S34N, Rab5Q79L, and EGFP-N were used for a PHEV propagation assay. at 12 hpi, the cells were lysed and harvested for immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. the cells were lysed and harvested for immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. these results were further evidenced by increased endocytosis of Tf-AF488. expression of Rab5Q79L reduced Tf-AF488 uptake to 66% of control levels. together, these results suggest that the GTPase Rab5 is critical for PHEV propagation. endogenous Rab5 function may need to be activated during viral entry. mainly trapped within large vesicles in the cytoplasm, either individually or in groups. the virus-containing coated vesicles were transported intracellularly during which the virus fused with the endosome membrane and the nucleocapsid was released. the earlier sign of viral assembly observed inside the cytoplasm was that large numbers of virions with undecorated membranes were present. PHEV enters endosomal structures and requires a low pH. neuro-2a cells were incubated with PHEV and fixed at indicated time for an IFA using anti-nCAM and anti-PHEV-S antibodies. neuro-2a cells were pretreated with weakly basic amines NH4Cl and chloroquine (CQ), which selectively raise the luminal pH of the endosome and lysosome. PHEV internalization decreased to less than 40% of the level found in untreated cells, while both reagents inhibited viral protein synthesis even at low concentrations. PHEV cargos were internalized into EEA1-positive endosomes. neuro-2a cells were infected with PHEV in the presence of NH4Cl or CQ. at 12 hpi, cells were fixed and stained with anti-PHEV antibodies. treatment of neuro-2a cells with 20 M dynasore resulted in a decrease of over 80% in PHEV internalization. treatment of cells with the chemical inhibitor blocked the uptake of fluorescently labeled transferrin. dynamin-2 may play a crucial role in multiple stages of the viral life cycle. neuro-2a cells were pretreated with 20 M dynasore for 1 h. the amount of virus endocytosed was measured by qRT-PCR at 2 hpi. cells were fixed, and the uptake of transferrin and viral particles was quantified. CPZ is a specific inhibitor commonly used to block the CME pathway by preventing the assembly of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) at the plasma membrane and causing clathrin lattices to assemble on endosomal membranes. cells treated with CPZ were incubated with PHEV plus 50 g/ml Tf-AF594 on ice for 30 min, after which they were shifted to 37\u00b0C for 60 min a new tab PHEV infection occurs via a CME-dependent mechanism. a PHEV internalization assay was carried out with cells pretreated with CPZ. surface-bound viruses were removed and detected by qRT-PCR. PHEVs were mostly coexpressed with clathrin at 1 h postinfection. clathrin is a protein that performs critical roles in the formation of coated vesicles for intracellular trafficking. caveola/lipid raft endocytosis is known to be sensitive to nonacute cholesterol depletion induced by pharmacological agents, such as MCD or Nys/Prog. PHEV and CTB take different intracellular targeting routes to the golgi apparatus. quantitative analyses revealed a significant reduction in the amount of internalized CTB. PHEV entry was suppressed by approximately 48%, though not abolished. the majority of both PHEV and CTB was settled on the outside surface of the plasma membrane. PHEV internalization after treatment of neuro-2a cells for 1 h was quantified by qRT-PCR. PHEV genome equivalents were estimated by qRT-PCR, using the 2CT method. viral protein synthesis levels were estimated by Western blotting. genistein checked for the uptake of PHEV and CTB in cells pretreated with 100 M genistein. this suggests that the signaling cascade in the caveola/lipid raft-dependent pathway is a negative regulator of PHEV aggregation. this suggests that PHEV entry occurs via a caveola/lipid raft-independent route. neuro-2a cells produced random filopodial protrusions and showed a smooth margin at cell surfaces with peripheral actin staining. without PHEV infection (0 min), the cells produced random filopodial protrusions and showed a smooth margin at cell surfaces with peripheral actin staining. neuro-2a cells were infected with diD-labeled PHEV (red) at 37\u00b0C. at 10 min postinfection, multiple virus particles (red) bound to actin-rich protrusions. PHEV particles were found to localize in dot-like actin filaments. images were captured immediately. cells were treated with various concentrations of CytoD to inhibit polymerization of actin. the drug was added 60 min prior to a 1-h inoculation with virus or at 1 hpi and maintained until analysis at 4 hpi. images from a representative experiment out of three independent replications showed that EIPA marginally reduced Dx-AF488 uptake but did not obviously affect PHEV infection. PHEV internalization was assayed by qRT-PCR at 2 hpi. treatment with 50 M EIPA significantly reduced the uptake of Dx-AF488 in the cytoplasm while showing a marginal effect on internalization. however, no difference in PHEV entry or infection was observed in the cells. the entry of PHEV into neuro-2a cells relies critically on actin reorganization but is independent of macropinocytosis. the Rab family of small GTPases is known to play crucial roles in orchestrating membrane traffic and localizing cargos to specific subcellular compartments. most enveloped RNA virus particles trafficked into EEs, marked by Rab5 and EEA1, and were either sorted into recycling endosomes (REs), marked by Rab11. neuro-2a cells were transfected with plasmids expressing EGFP-tagged Rab5 and Rab7 WT, AN, and DN constructs and then incubated with Tf-AF488 for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. at 24 hpi, the cells were fixed, probed with anti-PHEV-S antibody, and visualized by confocal microscopy. neuro-2a cells were pretransfected with 50 nM siCtrl, 25 nM siRab5, or 50 nM siRab7 for 48 h, followed by PHEV infection, and cell lysates were harvested at 24 hpi. Western blotting confirmed that Rab5 and Rab7 levels in neuro-2a cells were efficiently knocked down by the siRNAs. cells were lysed to quantitate viral RNA copy numbers by qRT-PCR. cells were fixed, stained with anti-PHEV antibody and DAPI. cells were then visualized by confocal microscopy. Rab5-positive EEs and Rab7-positive LEs were required for viral transport. PHEV infection is dependent on Rab5 activation. the function of Rab5 may play a more important role in PHEV infection. mutants were transfected into cells, followed by GTPase activity detection. overexpression of Rab5Q79L produced the most robust pulldown signal. signal was completely inhibited after transfection with the DN isoform Rab5S34N. neuro-2a cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Rab5wt, Rab5S34N, Rab5Q79L, and EGFP-N. they were subjected to cell lysis and pulldown assays as described below for panel C. immunoblots of GAPDH and GFP on the same membrane serve as loading control and input control. overexpression of isoform Rab5Q79L facilitated PHEV RNA replication and proliferation. overexpression of the DN isoform Rab5S34N significantly inhibited productive infection. PHEV infection was 7-fold higher than that in the EGFP-transfected group. PHEV infection has been reported successively in several pig-raising countries. this study is the first investigation of the cell entry process of PHEV particles. Rab5 and Rab7 are involved in PHEV invasion and intracellular trafficking. clathrin is first recruited to assemble CCPs on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane in response to receptor-mediated endocytosis signals. it is composed of a light chain (CLC) and a heavy chain (49). clathrins are required for the PHEV-induced formation of CCPs at their binding sites. the tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to disrupt caveola function did not affect PHEV infection. PHEV entry occurs not through disabling caveola-mediated endocytosis per se but most likely by altering the integrity of membrane lipid microdomains. in general, the conversion between these two states is regulated by GTPase-activating protein, GDP exchange factor, GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI), Rab escort protein (REP-1), and some effector molecules. however, whether PHEV infection depends on lysosomal activity remains unexplored. a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis involved in porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis is likely to open new approaches for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. to move forward, it is important to take advantage of powerful novel technologies combined with improved assays for following a virus step by step through its replication cycle. quine, cytochalasin D (CytoD), 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA) and dynasore, were purchased from Sigma. an antibody against Rabaptin5 was purchased from Abcam. the proteins in the lysates were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes and then immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. ice-cold PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.2) was added to completely remove unbound viruses. cells were shifted to 37\u00b0C to allow internalization. the ultrathin sections were stained in brass wire mesh with 2% uranyl acetate for 30 min and 0.4% lead citrate for 2 min. cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2 105 cells/well, grown for 24 h, and then treated with endocytosis inhibitors at the indicated concentrations for 1 h. ddH2O 4 25, 50 Cytochalasin D (CytoD) DMSO 20 50 Dynasore DMSO 20 10, 20 Genistein DMSO 20 50, 100 Methyl--cyclodextrin (MCD) ddH2O 4 2,500, 5,000 Nystatin (Nys) DMSO 20 15, 30 Progesterone (Prog) DMSO 20 5, 10 5-N-Ethyl-N- neuro-2a cells were transfected with the appropriate siRNA by using X-tremeGENE siRNA transfection reagent according to manufacturer's instructions. the knockdown efficiencies were quantified by Western blotting. subsequent experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. monolayers were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-phalloidin (1:200) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the percentages of cells with normal and disorganized actin filaments were determined. the specificity of labeling and the absence of signal crossover were confirmed by examination of single-labeled control samples. cells grown on coverslips were left untreated or pretreated with the corresponding inhibitors. they were then incubated with PHEV plus 50 g/ml Tf-AF594, PHEV plus 50 g/ml CTB-AF555, PHEV plus 50 g/ml Dx-AF488, or PHEV alone on ice for 15 to 30 min, after which they were shifted to 37\u00b0C and incubated for 60 min. GST-R5BD was then affinity purified by use of glutathione Sepharose 4B beads. cells were transfected with Rab5 proteins (Rab5wt, Rab5S34N, and Rab5Q79L) at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. then collected and lysed for 15 min in lysis buffer. a P value of 0.05 was defined as the threshold for statistical significance (single asterisks) neuro-2a cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. cholera toxin subunit B (CTB-AF555), and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated dextran (Dx-AF488) were all obtained from Invitrogen. a mouse anti-PHEV-S antibody (monoclonal antibody 1E2) was used in all Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses. ice-cold PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.2) was added to completely remove unbound viruses. cells were either fixed for visualization by microscopy with anti-PHEV-S antibody or subjected to qRT-PCR analysis. 10 l of DMEM was added to 100 l of DMEM in each well of the 96-well plate. the absorbance at 450 nm was measured with a microplate reader. plasmids for wild-type (WT) sequences and dominant active (DA) and dominant negative (DN) mutant sequences were constructed using conventional cloning techniques. siRNAs against the clathrin heavy chain (siCHC) (5\u2032-UGACAAAGGUGGAUAAAUU-3\u2032), caveolin-1 (siCav1) (5\u2032-GCAGUUGUACCAUAU-3\u2032), Rab5 (siRab5) (5\u2032-CCAG aldehyde was permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. after which they were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. cells were then probed with primary antibodies, i.e., anti-NCAM (1:200), anti-EEA1 (1:1,000), and anti-PHEV (1:200), for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. PHEV was purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. the virus was first purified over 30%, 45%, and 60% sucrose cushions in an ultracentrifuge at 80,000 g for 4 h at 4\u00b0C. the virus was exchanged into PBS through cycles of concentration by centrifugation. noninternalized PHEV, CTB-AF555, and Dx-AF488 were removed by washing the cells with PBS three times and adding 0.5 ml of room-temperature 0.25% trypsin. 1 min later, we removed the trypsin, washed the cells with cold complete medium twice, fixed them with cold 0.4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. to measure Rab5 GTPase activation in response to PHEV infection, the virus was preabsorbed into the cells at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. guanosine gamma thiophosphate (GTPS) was added to partial lysates to activate small G proteins as a positive control. the resin was rinsed with the lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS loading buffer."}
