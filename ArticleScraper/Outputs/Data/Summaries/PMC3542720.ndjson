{"summary": "paramyxoviridae is an enveloped virus with a non-segmented negative-sense RNA genome of 15 246 bases. the RNA genome encodes, from the 3\u2032 end, the nucleo- (NP), phospho- (P), V, matrix (M), fusion (F), small hydrophobic (SH), haemagglutinin\u2013neuraminidase (HN) and large (L) proteins. the IFN response is triggered when virus infection results in the generation of molecules, such as dsRNA, that display molecular signatures. the two most important cytoplasmic PRRs for detecting PAMPs produced by RNA viruses are retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) the V protein limits IFN induction by interacting directly with MDA-5. it indirectly inhibits RIG-I by binding to a helicase related to RIG-I. it also blocks IFN signalling by targeting signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) for proteasome-mediated degradation. the ability of PIV5 to circumvent the IFN response is not absolute. plaques of PIV5 are significantly larger on cells that cannot produce and/or respond to IFN compared with IFN-competent cells. however, the virus manages to target STAT1 for proteasome-mediated degradation. IFN-stimulated gene 56/IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (ISG56/IFIT1) is primarily responsible for the observed effects of IFN on PIV5 transcription and protein synthesis. cells were transiently transfected with plasmids permitting the constitutive expression of IFIT3, IFN-induced protein 35 (IFI35), ISG15, ISG20, viperin or ISG56/IFIT1. overexpression of IFIT3, IFI35, ISG15, ISG20 and viperin did not have any obvious effect on the levels of NP or P. at 18 h p.i., the cells were fixed and immunostained for the viral NP protein (red) and the HA-tagged ISG56/IFIT1 (green) a near-normal pattern of virus protein synthesis was observed in IFN-treated cells with impaired ISG56/IFIT1 expression. a near-normal pattern of virus protein synthesis was observed in IFN-treated cells with impaired ISG56/IFIT1 expression. ISG56/IFIT1-knockdown cells were infected with CPI and treated with IFN. a near-normal pattern of virus protein synthesis was again observed. similar results were also obtained with nave A549 cells. mRNA was isolated from parallel cultures and subject to in vitro translation using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. labelled proteins were visualized using a phosphoimager. the position of the M protein in the total cell samples is indicated by asterisks. treated cells with IFN at 8 h after infection increased, rather than decreased, the amount of all viral mRNAs. surprisingly, treating cells with IFN at 8 h after infection increased, rather than decreased, the amount of all the viral mRNAs. the increase in viral mRNA levels observed in control cells treated with IFN after infection was not reflected in the levels of virus protein synthesized, which were significantly reduced in response to IFN. mRNA was isolated from CPI-infected control cells at 20 h p.i. and translated in cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate. parallel cultures were labelled with [35S]methionine. proteins ISG56/IFIT1 and ISG54/IFIT2 can recognize and inhibit translation of (viral) mRNA caps that are not 2\u2032-O-methylated. this can act as a mechanism by which the host cell can distinguish self from non-self mRNA during virus infection. we also examined the distribution of the NP and P proteins in nave and ISG56/IFIT1-knockdown cells. in untreated control A549 cells NP was distributed primarily throughout the cytoplasm, while in cells that had been treated with exogenous IFN, NP was located primarily in cytoplasmic bodies. the amount of infectious virus in the culture medium of control cells was determined 2 days after infection. pre-treatment of control cells with IFN reduced titres by 5 logs. other ISGs must also contribute to the induction of an IFN-induced antiviral state. monolayers of cells in six-well plates were infected with CPI. at 7 days p.i., the cells were fixed and the virus plaques visualized by immunostaining the monolayers with a pool of mAbs to the NP and P proteins. at 24 h post-transfection, cells were either mock infected or infected with PIV5 at a high m.o.i. (10 p.f.u. per cell) the cells were fixed and immunostained for the viral NP protein (red) and the HA-tagged ISG56/IFIT1 (green) at 20 h p.i., the cells were radioactively labelled with L-[35S]methionine for 1 h and the viral proteins were immunoprecipitated. total cell extracts and immunoprecipitates were separated by electrophoresis through a 412 % polyacrylamide gel. mRNA was isolated from parallel cultures and subject to in vitro translation using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. mRNA was immunoprecipitated or not prior to being separated by electrophoresis through a 7\u201312 % gradient gel. induced inhibition of virus protein synthesis was due to inhibition of virus transcription or translation. quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to measure the relative amounts of NP, P/V, M, HN and L viral mRNAs in control cells. the highest mRNA levels occurred at around 18 h p.i. 1 cells with IFN either prior to or after infection did not significantly alter either the pattern or levels of virus transcript accumulation. mRNA values are expressed as the quantity of the gene of interest relative to the quantity of -actin mRNA. results shown as meanssem of duplicate samples in two separate experiments. mRNA was isolated from CPI-infected control cells at 20 h p.i. mRNA was translated in cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate. in order to compare pattern of virus protein synthesis with that in cells, parallel cultures were also labelled with [35S]methionine. the incorporation of 3H-labelled methyl groups from donor vaccinia virus 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase VP39 was monitored by in vitro methylation assays. no detectable incorporation of 3H was observed in mRNA isolated from mock-infected or CPI-infected cells. NP was distributed primarily throughout the cytoplasm. in cells that had been treated with exogenous IFN, NP was located primarily in cytoplasmic bodies. cytoplasmic bodies do not form in response to IFN. plaques formed on nave A549 cells were not as large as those observed on control cells. monolayers of cells in six-well plates were infected with CPI. a few virus-infected cells produce IFN, which induces an antiviral state to PIV5. remarkably ISG56/IFIT1 is primarily responsible for the observed IFN-induced alterations in PIV5 transcription and protein synthesis. lack of methylation of the 2\u2032 ribose may allow cells to distinguish self from non-self RNA. virus that replicate in the cytoplasm have evolved both N7- and 2\u2032-O-methyltransferases to methylate their viral mRNA caps. we cannot rule out the possibility that cells may contain small amounts of CPI mRNAs that are not 2\u2032-O-methylated, which may activate ISG56/IFIT1. in this regard, it is of note that while the PIV5 viral polymerase has the absolutely conserved residues for 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase enzymes, it is also clear that ISG56/IFIT1 affects virus transcription. ISG56/IFIT1 binds to and inactivates the viral helicase of human papillomavirus. it is of note that ISG56/IFIT1 binds to and inactivates the viral polymerase. a significant decrease in the levels of full-length HN mRNAs. the most marked reduction in the viral proteins synthesized in cells either pre- or post-treated with IFN encoded proteins downstream of the P gene. the synthesis of NP and P, although inhibited, remain relatively high. a consequence of this change in the relative levels of the viral proteins might favour the formation of cytoplasmic bodies. the cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer, sonicated and centrifuged for 30 min at 12 000 g to remove solid material. the proteins in immunocomplexes were dissociated by heating for 5 min at 100 \u00b0C and analysed by SDS-PAGE. for human ISG56 were for region 1 (5\u2032-GGATAAAGCTCTTGAGTTA-3\u2032) and region 2 (5\u2032-CTACAAATTGGAAAAAT-3\u2032) cells were selected with blasticidin (10 g ml1) and maintained for 4 weeks in medium containing blasticidin. cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding HA-tagged ISG56/IFIT1. total cellular RNA was extracted from infected cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) two micrograms of RNA was subsequently used for RT-PCR. mRNA was expressed as the quantity of the gene of interest relative to the quantity of the reference gene. poly(A)-containing RNA was isolated from 1.5107 mock- or CPI-infected A549 cells with an Oligotex Direct mRNA Mini kit. in vitro-transcribed model RNA (m7-Cap-RNA) encoding the NP of mouse hepatitis coronavirus was generated using a T7 RiboMax Express Large Scale RNA Production System (Promega) vero, Huh7, A549 and Hep2 cells were grown as monolayers in 25 or 75 cm2 tissue-culture flasks in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium. when needed, cells were treated with human recombinant IFN. lentivirus vector used for the expression of ISG56/IFIT1 shRNA sequence was based on pLKO.1puro. double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the target sequences were cloned into pLKO.BLAST. mAbs to NP and P proteins were used for CPI infection. cells were washed several times with 1 % FCS in PBS. total cellular RNA was extracted from infected cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) the plotted values of mRNA were expressed as the quantity of the gene of interest relative to the quantity of the reference gene, to obtain normalized and relative expression values. each sample was performed in duplicate on the same qPCR plate in two separate experiments.
