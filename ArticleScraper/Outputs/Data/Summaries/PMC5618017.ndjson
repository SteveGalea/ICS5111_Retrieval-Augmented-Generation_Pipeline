{"summary": "the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an -CoV and the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea, which is characterized by severe enteritis, vomiting, watery diarrhea, and loss of weight. PEDV infections cause high morbidity and mortality rates, especially in sucking piglets. nsp proteins trigger the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs), which provide a platform for the concentration of viral factors. nsp proteins also form replication-transcription complexes (RTCs), which localize on the DMVs and CMs where they mediate the synthesis of viral RNA. onavirus (MERS-CoV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) have been reported to be present in cells infected by CoV. other intracellular structures have been reported to be present in cells infected by CoV. TBs and CMSs are condensed, highly organized membrane rearrangements connected to the ER. the only infections of -CoV characterized at the ultrastructural level are those of HCoV-NL36 and of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) in cells infected with these two -CoV, virions were observed in the ER, Golgi, and LVCVs, whereas DMVs were reported to be present in cells exposed to HCoV-NL36. vero E6 cells at 60% confluence were inoculated with one multiplicity of infection (MOI) and 25 g/mL of trypsin. aliquots of cells and culture supernatants were collected for analysis at 0, 8, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h post-infection (p.i.). dilutions in DMEM of supernatants collected at 0, 8, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h p.i. the TCID50 value was calculated using the Spearman/Kaerber formula. RT-PCR was then performed using primers to detect the mRNA levels of the ORF3 (GAGACTCGATTGACACAGTTG and GAGAGGTACCGCCTCTCTCTTG) primary antibodies used were monoclonal antibodies against dsRNA (English and Scientific Consulting Kft, Szir\u00e1k, Hungary), TGN46 (Sigma) and PDI (Enzo, Farmingdale, NY, USA) secondary antibodies were Alexa488- or Alexa568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies. at least 200 cell profiles were randomly selected at each p.i. timepoint. the number of cell sections containing at least one of the PEDV-induced structures was counted to morphologically determine the proportion of infected cells. mouse anti-CD63 and mouse anti-transferrin receptor detected after bridging with rabbit anti-mouse IgG or rabbit anti-sheep IgG antibody. labelled cryo-sections were contrasted with a 2% uranyl oxalate (pH 7) and methyl cellulose-uranyl acetate (pH 4) solution on ice. infected cells were maintained in complete DMEM without FCS. aliquots of cells and culture supernatants were collected for analysis at 0, 8, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h post-infection (p.i.) monolayers of vero E6 cells were inoculated with serial dilutions. a CFX ConnectTM real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) using the following conditions: 10 s at 95 \u00b0C, then 40 cycles of 5 s at 95 \u00b0C, and finally 34 s at 60 \u00b0C. preparations were first incubated with the primary antibodies in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at room temperature for 1 h. at least 200 cell profiles were randomly selected at each p.i. timepoint, and three different quantifications were performed on four grids. the average diameter of each structure was determined by measuring 10\u201340 profiles using the imageJ software. cells were washed three times in PBS and one time in PBS containing 50 mM glycine. cells were successively embedded in 12% gelatin, cryo-sectioned, and immunogold labelled as previously described [43] primary antibodies were mouse anti-KDEL (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA), sheep anti-TGN-46 (Serotec, Oxford, UK), mouse anti-CD63 (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA large double-membrane vesicles had a diameter of 230 50 nm. they contained coiled filaments and were often in close proximity to each other. in between and around the DMVs, we frequently observed a network of reticular inclusion, which had already been described in specific cell types. large single-membrane compartments containing mature virion particles. cytoplasmic inclusions composed of condensed tubular structures were observed connected to the endoplasmic reticulum (ERBs) from time to time, virus particles were observed in their interior (arrows) virions were also detected in large single-membrane vacuoles with a diameter of 865 270 nm, limited by a single membrane. similar compartments, but smaller in size and without virions, were also observed in uninfected cells, indicating that these vacuoles could be endolysosomal compartments. time-course PEDV infection and measurement of cellular lifecycle parameters. a very pronounced PEDV infection was detected at 48 and 72 h p.i., with 80% and almost 100% of cells positive for dsRNA. the 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) dye (blue) was used to stain the nuclei and determine the total number of cells. the total RNA was isolated from cells and the relative amount of sgRNA N and gRNA mRNAs was quantified by RT-PCR. measurements indicated that the PEDV lifecycle in Vero E6 cells progresses following the established dynamics of CoV, thereby confirming the use of this cell line as a model [40]. at this timepoint, there is a dramatic augmentation in the number of infected cells, close to 100%, which coincides with an arrest in the augmentation of viral RNA synthesis. the percentage of cells displaying DMVs and CMs was determined in the experiments shown in Figure 1. EM samples prepared at different p.i. timepoints were statistically evaluated. the percentage of cell profiles containing a specific structure was determined for each p.i. timepoint. a dramatic change in the percentage of CMs was observed at 60 h p.i., increasing from 6% to 21%, when the DMVs also increased markedly. both LVCVs and virions-positive ER were detectable from 24 h p.i. the percentage of cell sections with these structures increased over time. Golgi complex undergoes reorganization over the course of a PEDV infection. it has previously been shown that LVCVs are expanded Golgi stacks [12,29] therefore, we decided to quantify at the ultrastructural level the number of cell sections displaying this organelle. the percentage of cell sections in the experiment shown in Figure 1 are positive for IVCs. PEDV induces the formation of LVCVs, which are positive for the Golgi stack and trans-Golgi protein markers GM130 (E) and TGN46 (F), respectively. the number of cell sections displaying them peaked at 24 h p.i. before decreasing. these structures have not been detected in other CoV infections. they could represent vero E6 cell-specific Golgi complex alterations. GM130 and TGN46 labels were found in LVCVs at 72 h p.i., confirming that these compartments have a Golgi origin. the ER proliferation first appeared at 8 h and reached a peak at 24 h p.i., before becoming less prominent during the following hours of infection. the ER proliferation alleviation starting from 24 h p.i. coincided with the emergence of ER-derived structures, such as DMVs, CMs, and virion-positive ER, in the infected cells. this observation suggests that these structures are probably not functionally connected with ER proliferation. PDI (green), an ER protein marker, was examined by immunofluorescence with or without PEDV infection at 24 and 72 h p.i. nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) representative immunofluorescence images were from three independent experiments. many DMVs appeared to have inward invaginations of the limiting membrane. in between and around the DMVs, we frequently observed a network of reticular inclusion. in between and around the DMVs, we frequently observed a network of reticular inclusion. cytoplasmic inclusions composed of condensed tubular structures containing a dense inner core were observed connected to the endoplasmic reticulum (ERBs) from time to time, virus particles were observed in their interior (arrows) virions were also detected in large single-membrane vacuoles with a diameter of 800 160 nm. similar compartments, but smaller in size and without virions, were also observed in uninfected cells. this notion was confirmed by immunogold labeling of cryo-sections obtained from PEDV-infected cells. dsRNA is an intermediate in CoV replication; it localizes inside the DMVs. dsRNA can be visualized from 24 h p.i., but the percentage of cells positive for this nucleic acid was still below 10%. a very pronounced PEDV infection was detected at 48 and 72 h p.i. 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dye (blue) was used to stain the nuclei and determine the total number of cells. the total RNA was isolated from cells and the relative amount of sgRNA N and gRNA mRNAs was quantified by RT-PCR. the production of the virus progeny was assessed by determining the virus titer of the cell culture supernatants. quantifications showed that PEDV starts to replicate, assemble, and egress in these cells around 8 h p.i. and the infection continuously increases until 48 h p.i. at this timepoint, there is a dramatic augmentation in the number of infected cells, close to 100%, which coincide with an arrest in the augmentation of viral RNA synthesis. the percentage of structures containing viral particles was statistically evaluated. EM samples prepared at different p.i. timepoints were statistically evaluated. the percentage of cell profiles containing a specific structure was determined for each p.i. timepoint. a dramatic change in the percentage of CMs was observed at 60 h p.i., increasing from 6% to 21%, when the DMVs also increased markedly. both LVCVs and virions-positive ER were detectable from 24 h p.i. and the percentage of cell sections with these structures increased over time. it has previously been shown that LVCVs are expanded Golgi stacks. at 60 h p.i., the number of cell sections displaying this organelle did not change noticeably. the LVCVs originate from ERGIC/Golgi, which probably expands. morphology of an irregular vesicle cluster (IVCs) is a closely packed, irregular shaped, single-membrane vesicle with a light content. the percentage of cell sections in the experiment shown in Figure 1 are positive for IVCs. GM130-labelled Golgi localized perinuclearly at 24 h p.i. at 72 h p.i., the distribution of the GM130 signal changed again, forming cytoplasmic clusters. the same reorganization of the Golgi in infected cells as that observed for GM130. GM130 and TGN46 labels were mainly found in LVCVs at 72 h p.i., confirming that these compartments have a Golgi origin. the ER proliferation alleviation starting from 24 h p.i. coincided with the emergence of ER-derived virions. the ERBs and the virion-positive compartments seen in Figure 1C originate from ER by immuno-EM analysis using an anti-KDEL antibody. this observation suggests that these structures are probably not functionally connected with ER proliferation. error bars represent the standard deviation from three grids. we inoculated cells with or without PEDV before analyzing them at 24 h and 72 h p.i. using antibodies against PDI, an ER resident protein. a time-course approach to examine PEDV infection in vero E6 cells. we did not detect autophagosomes, which are morphologically different than the observed DMVs. the CMs appear at the same time as DMVs but with lower frequency. the ER proliferates to accommodate the increasing mass of viral proteins that will form the DMVs and luminal virions. one hypothesis is that one or more PEDV proteins present some structural and/or functional characteristics that lead to a more pronounced ER stress response. virions in several compartments, i.e., ER, LVCVs, endolysosomal organelles, and very rarely in the ERBs. the virions of this -CoV start to form in the ERGIC/Golgi compartment and only at later timepoint in the ER [29]. the endolysosomal compartments are not the site of viral particle assembling, but rather a location where excess virions are nonspecifically delivered. the virions observed in the endolysosomal compartments could be secreted viral particles that are re-infecting cells through endocytosis. our study has characterized and temporarily ordered the different rearrangements induced by PEDV. this information paves the way for future investigations of the function of these structures."}
