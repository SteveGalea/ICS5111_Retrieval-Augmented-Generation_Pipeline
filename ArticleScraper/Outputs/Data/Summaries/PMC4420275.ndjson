{"summary": "the burden of pathogens on host fitness results in selective pressure on both genes involved in immunity and host factors that are hijacked to promote infection. changes in the rate of nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions (d N) relative to the rate of synonymous changes (d S) can indicate recurrent positive selection common to host-pathogen interfaces. OAS proteins are cytoplasmic dsRNA binding proteins that generate the second messenger 2\u2019-5\u2019 oligoadenylate (2-5An) on RNA binding. 2-5A leads to the dimerization and activation of the latent ribonuclease (RNase L), which degrades host and viral mRNAs. a viral-encoded direct inhibitor of OAS1 has been described [22]. DNA binding leads to the generation of the second messenger 2\u2019-3\u2019-cyclic GMP-AMP. cGAMP activates the STimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) [25,29\u201331], which activates the STimulator of Interferon genes through TBK1-IRF3 signals [8,29] cGAS has been implicated in the control of DNA viruses [12,32,33] and even the inhibition of RNA viruses [32,38] cGAS and OAS1 act in parallel innate defense signaling pathways. cGAS dimerizes and generates cGAMP, which activates TBK1-IRF3. cGAS synthesizes 2\u20135 oligoadenylate, which activates RNase L and leads to the destruction of viral and cellular RNAs. cGAS generates cGAMP [12], a secondary messenger that activates the interferon response via STING-TBK1-IRF3 signaling. little is known about the evolution of cGAS in primates, including humans. cGAS has been subject to recurrent pathogen-driven evolution in primates. phylogenetic analyses of cGAS (A,B) and OAS1 (C,D) were carried out using sequences from 22 matching primate species. cGAS gene structure with annotated domains and catalytic residues is labeled in red with the corresponding branch. cGAS exhibits d N/d S ratios exceeding one\u2014a hallmark of positive selection\u2014on various branches in hominoid, old world, and new world monkey lineages. the branch separating ancestors of orangutans from humans, chimps, bonobos, and gorillas in the hominoid lineage was especially remarkable for its inferred episode of positive selection. cGAS and OAS1 crystal structures were merged using Chimera [69] to visualize structural overlap. cGAS and OAS1 crystal structures were mapped onto the apo crystal structure of human cGAS (blue) and human OAS1 (yellow) (PDB: 4KM5)[14]. phylogenetic analysis revealed multiple nodes across the primate phylogeny with elevated d N/d S values, similar to cGAS. phylogenetic analysis revealed roughly three times as many sites with statistically significant d N/d S ratios compared to cGAS. sites with significantly elevated d N/d S mapped to protein surfaces of cGAS and OAS1. for cGAS, the sites under selection localized to four distinct regions of the protein. for cGAS most protein surfaces contain at least one rapidly evolving site. ous sites under positive selection in the helical spine suggest that such a pattern of overlap is unlikely to arise by chance. similar to cGAS, some sites under positive selection in OAS1 contact dsRNA (S7 Fig) a likelihood ratio test between these models supported a positive correlation between OAS1 and cGAS. the slope of in correlation model equals 0.76. the results reveal unexpected parallels in the evolutionary history of OAS and cGAS. phylogenetic analyses of OAS1, OAS2, and OASL were carried out using sequences from 11 matching primate species. NTase (red) and OAS1-C (gray) domains are indicated. ubiquitin-like domains (yellow) are also indicated. a comparison of OASL sequences from primates did not exhibit significant signatures of positive selection (p = 0.99), while OAS3 was near the significance cut-off (p = 0.08; S8 Table and S9 Table). a more comprehensive panel of OASL sequences failed to uncover signs of positive selection by all measures tested, including BUSTED (S12 Table). cGAS encodes multiple mRNA spliceforms across primates. RT-PCR was carried out using cDNA from primate cells. cDNA was identified by cDNA cloning, but not detected by electrophoresis. cGAS spliceform variants may represent a means to evade or inactivate counteract viral antagonism or perhaps even regulate cGAS. cGAS spliceform variants may represent a means to evade or inactivate counteract viral antagonism. cloned and sequenced cDNA of cGAS from 22 simian primates. the sites model implemented in Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood (PAML) [44] calculated d N/d S values per amino acid position and compare models that omit or accommodate elevated d N/d S. cGAS gene structure with annotated domains and catalytic residues labeled in red with the corresponding branch (red branch) cGAS gene structure with annotated domains and catalytic residues is indicated above the gene. cGAS exhibits d N/d S ratios exceeding one\u2014a hallmark of positive selection. multiple amino acid sites in cGAS were inferred to have a d N/d S ratio significantly greater than 1. the sites are distributed throughout the protein, a pattern common to other antiviral proteins [2]. evolutionary analysis of cGAS and OAS1 suggests shared evolutionary pressures with cGAS Biochemical and other experimental approaches have identified parallels between the OAS and cGAS pathways. we hypothesized that cGAS and OAS1 might share similar modes of adaptation in response to viral antagonism. enetic analysis revealed roughly three times as many sites with statistically significant d N/d S ratios compared to our analysis of cGAS. the complementary MEME, and FUBAR tests (HyPhy package) identified multiple residues overlapping with PAML analysis under positive selection in OAS1. these sites are distributed throughout the 364 amino acid protein, a pattern reminiscent of the antiviral Protein kinase R (PKR) [6]. 4/11 sites in cGAS are located within the spine while 5/36 sites are located along the OAS1 spine as identified by PAML. three of these sites are analogous based upon the amino acid backbones and the directionality of the side chains. these sites are the first noted as being under positive selection at nucleic-acid binding surfaces for both cGAS and OAS1. the overlap of positions under positive selection in cGAS prompted us to ask if these host defense genes might have a history of shared antagonism by pathogens during primate divergence. enzymatically inactive OASL gene uniquely encodes two ubiquitin repeats at its C-terminus [18,19] all four members have been implicated in virus inhibition with OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3 directly activating the 2-5A-RNaseL pathway [13] and OASL acting as an enhancer of RIG-I signaling in infected cells. phylogenetic analysis on a matching panel of primates for all four genes from 11 primates with sequenced genomes and annotated OAS genes. a more thorough analysis of OAS2 consisting of 20 species further supports evidence for positive selection by all tests. a comparison of OASL sequences from primates did not exhibit significant signatures of positive selection. cGAS spliceforms have altered C-termini but maintain internal exon structures. cGAS encodes multiple mRNA spliceforms. RT-PCR was carried out using cDNA from primate cell. cGAS spliceforms identified by cDNA and PCR assay. the size of the spliced amplicons in basepairs (bp) and predicted size of the ORFs in amino acids (aa) are labeled next to the corresponding gene structure. discussion The Red Queen hypothesis provides a useful framework for investigating recurrent genetic conflicts like those unfolding at host-pathogen interfaces. uncovered two potentially adaptive mechanisms involving duplications resulting in gene fusions and alternate splicing of key innate immunity genes. evolution of the OAS family suggests adaptation through gene fusion OAS proteins are encoded by an ancient and dynamic gene family. gene fusions of OAS2 and OAS3 bury protein surfaces via head-to-tail duplications and result in proteins resistant to viral inhibitors that target homotypic interactions. cGAS and OAS likely faced shared and distinct inhibitors encoded by pathogens (colored hexagons) cGAS isoforms encode intact ORFs. spliceforms that lack exon 3 but maintain exon 2 still contain cGAMP catalytic residues. alternative splicing has been noted in several cases for evasion of pathogens. cGAS and OAS1 have overlapping evolutionary histories in primates. cGAS and OAS1 have sites distributed throughout the gene with signatures of positive selection. cGAS exhibits only about a third the number of sites under selection compared to OAS1. the localization of amino acid positions under positive selection can identify new interfaces involved in protein-protein interactions between host and pathogen factors. some protein domains may be dispensable for basal activity in the context of innate immunity. however, these domains may have undefined roles in regulation or may be targeted by pathogen factors to inactivate PRRs. our evolutionary analysis of cGAS over the divergence of primates is consistent with a vital function for cGAS in countering diverse pathogens. cGAS and OAS genes appear to adapt by additional mechanisms that drastically alter protein structure through alternate splicing or gene fusion events respectively. the expansion of the genes involved genomic duplications of the OAS core unit encoded by the first five exons from OAS1 [16]. fewer sites appear under positive selection in OAS2 with even the more sensitive methods of detection. despite antiviral functions, OAS2 and OAS3 have not been subject to as many pivotal genetic conflicts as is likely for OAS1. gene fusions can provide single mutational steps that obscure protein surfaces from interactions with viral encoded inhibitors. cGAS and OAS likely faced shared and distinct inhibitors encoded by pathogens (colored hexagons) cGAS and OAS likely faced shared and distinct inhibitors encoded by pathogens. cGAS spliceforms may serve to remove surfaces antagonized by pathogens. spliceforms may act as cGAS decoys that bind and sequester viral or bacterial inhibitors. alternative splicing of human APOBEC3G, 3F, and 3H has been documented. cGAS and OAS1 have sites distributed throughout the gene with signatures of positive selection. cGAS exhibits only about a third the number of sites under selection compared to OAS1. cGAS exhibits only about a third the number of sites under selection compared to OAS1. cGAS and OAS1 may have been subject to inhibition on the same primate branches over the course of primate divergence. this correlation of overall rates of evolution suggests that cGAS and OAS1 may have been subject to inhibition on the same primate branches. we hypothesize that double-stranded DNA viruses represent strong candidates for encoding such inhibitors because they produce both double-stranded RNA and DNA. cGAS and OAS genes appear to adapt by additional mechanisms that drastically alter protein structure through alternate splicing or gene fusion events respectively. cGAS and OAS genes appear to adapt by additional mechanisms that drastically alter protein structure through alternate splicing or gene fusion events. cGAS sequences from new world monkeys, each exon was PCR amplified from genomic DNA.
