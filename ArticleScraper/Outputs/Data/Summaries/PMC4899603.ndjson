{"summary": "the field of nucleic acid based testing may be termed \u201cmolecular diagnostics\u201d and its central step most often consists of nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAATs) the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been the mainstay technique for the amplification of nucleic acids. RPA provides an inexpensive, fast, real-time, and reliable alternative POU/POC method that employs crude DNA preparation and simple field-deployable detection devices. other technologies employing a constant temperature to facilitate the amplification of nucleic acids targets have also been reported in the literature. the isothermal NAAT RPA combines constant low reaction temperature with high sensitivity, specificity, and reaction speed. oligonucleotides used for amplification are mixed with DNA binding proteins (GP32, UvsX, and UvsY) resulting in formation of filaments of protein coated oligonucleotide complexes. assay Description Sequence RPA RR2Y probe cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc RPA has been successfully employed in a number of reports for both human IVD [23\u201327] and veterinary applications [28, 29]. the simplicity of the nucleic acid amplification can be mirrored by simple front-end sample preparation procedures. the chosen sample processing procedure and the RPA biochemistry have to be augmented by a compatible read-out approach. protein-based lateral-flow devices (LFD) are the current gold standard for the rapid, on-site test format for GMO sample screening. new GMO crops involve the combination by conventional breeding of two or more transgenic events (i.e., single-locus insertions) 1.3 mL of DNA Binding Buffer was added to each 2 mL screwcap tube. 200 L of DNA Pre-Wash Buffer was added, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 1 minute. Seed DNA Wash Buffer (500 L) was added to the Zymo-Spin IIC Column. DNA was eluted by incubating in presence of 30 L of elution buffer at RT for 2 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 30 sec. kinase, 5.5% PEG 35 K, 6% Trehalose, 2.5 mM ATP, 50 mM phosphocreatine, and 240 M of each dNTP were rehydrated with 46.5 L of rehydration buffer. pellets were mixed by vortex and spun down before transferring the tubes to the Twista fluorescent reader. agen Multiplex PCR Mastermix (2x) and 100 ng of genomic DNA in a final reaction volume of 40 L. RR1 and RR2Y reactions were performed using 200 nM forward and reverse primers. lec reactions were performed using 100 nM primers. the bottom portion of the test strip was dipped in the extract for 5 minutes. a pink band corresponding to the Control band developed in all strips. a pink band indicating the strips have functioned properly. i(j) is the random effect of the jth well in the ith temperature. i(j) is the random effect of the jth well in the ith temperature. ik is the effect of the interaction between the ith temperature and the kth time; and ijk is the residual error. supernatant (900 L) was transferred to a Zymo-Spin IIC Column in a collection tube. 200 L of DNA Pre-Wash Buffer was added, followed by centrifugation. DNA was eluted from the Zymo-Spin IIC Column by incubating in presence of 30 L of elution buffer at RT for 2 minutes. pellets were generated by lyophilizing reaction mixtures containing RR2Y primers at 420 nM, lec primers at 240 nM, RR2Y and lec specific probes at 120 nM each, 100 ng/L creatine kinase, 5.5% PEG 35 K, 6% Trehalose, 2.5 mM ATP, 50 mM phosphocreatine. PCR amplification was carried out in a thermocycler (Eppendorf Mastercycler Personal) using the following primer pairs. oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. RR1 and lec reactions were performed using 200 nM forward and reverse primers. 100 soybean seeds were counted and ground on high speed for 20 seconds. seed powder and water were mixed in a ratio of 1 : 5 (w/v) and manually shaken for 30 seconds. about 12 mL of the extract was transferred carefully in order not to collect solids into a three-ounce sample cup. positive, negative, or invalid calls were made based on a slope cutoff of 90 mV/min for FAM and 600 mV/min for TAMRA. y i j k = + i + i j + k + i j k, (1) where y ijk is the observed response of the jth well of the ith temperature. gene such as lec confirms the general activity of the reaction. oligonucleotide primers and probes were designed to detect the junction sequences unique to RR2Y. a number of primers and probes were designed across the junction sequence. transgenic inserts in RR1 and RR2Y have different junction sequences with the flanking soybean genome. amplification was readily observed when RR2Y DNA was used as the template by itself (100% (w/w) RR2Y or the conventional DNA (0.1% (w/w) RR2Y in conventional) PCR was performed using RR1-specific primers and specific amplification was observed using the RR1 soybean DNA as template. all samples, except for the reactions lacking any genomic DNA, displayed positive PCR amplification products with lec primers at the expected size range. the sensitivity of the duplex RPA formulation was assessed by challenging it with different amounts of target DNA purified from RR2Y soybean seed samples as template. a positive amplification signal was generated in all 7 samples which contained 10 copies of RR2Y target. a duplex assay challenged with a low number of RR2Y target copies in the background of conventional soybean DNA would reflect the performance of the assay in a POU setting. a set of experiments were performed to determine the limit of RR2Y detection when challenging the assay with more complex DNA template. strong signals were still observed at RR2Y template amounts of 25 and 13 copies. temperature (\u00b0C) Onset time (min; n = 6) 37 6.3\u20137.3 38 5.7\u20136.7 39 5.7\u20136.3 40 5.3\u20136.0 41 5.3\u20135.7 A time course experiment was performed to address the long-term storage stability of the RPA formulation. each strip of lyophilized RPA reaction pellets was vacuum-sealed in a foil pouch. RR2Y reactions in the formulation tested are stable when stored in a freezer or refrigerator for up to one year and at RT for up to six months. increased stability characteristics may be achieved by introducing changes to the manufacturing process to increase dryness of the reaction pellets or by the inclusion of suitable additives. s were standardized to perform the RPA reactions starting with ground soybean seed as the source material. genetic modification in the RR1 and RR2Y events produces the unique CP4 EPSPS protein not observed in the conventional soybean. RR2Y specific amplification was observed with 0.5% (w/w) RR2Y samples. no amplification was observed with conventional, RR1 soybean seed extracts. results from the screen display matched the amplification curves. the results demonstrate that the combined assay can detect the RR2Y target with sufficient sensitivity even if presented in background of large amounts of nontarget DNA. the results demonstrate that the combined assay can detect the RR2Y target with sufficient sensitivity even if presented in the background of large amounts of nontarget DNA. formulated reaction pellets were stored in microcentrifuge PCR strip tubes. each strip of lyophilized RPA reaction pellets was vacuum-sealed in foil pouch. eight reaction tubes from the respective storage temperature were tested for assay performance at regular intervals over a period of one year. the current benchmark for field testing involves protein-based LFD that detects the presence of the target protein in crude seed extracts. the unique DNA insertions in the RR1 and RR2Y genomes code for the same CP4 EPSPS protein which confers resistance to the herbicide Roundup. RR2Y soybean specific amplification reactions performed by trained and untrained personnel to demonstrate ease of carrying out RPA-based field detection assays. no amplification was observed with RR2Y primers and probe using conventional and RR1 soybean seed samples. the ability of RPA assays to detect DNA sequences unique to GMO crops provides an advantage over LFD for GMO crops that share the same protein. RPA assays are simpler, easier, and faster than PCR assays for an end-user."}
