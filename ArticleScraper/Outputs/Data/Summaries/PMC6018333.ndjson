{"summary": "the world health organization estimates that 3.9 million people succumb to acute respiratory viral infections every year (1). a rapid and accurate viral diagnosis can reduce the overuse of antibiotics and enable prompt administration of antiviral therapy. a prompt viral diagnosis can facilitate correct infection prevention practices, enable shorter hospital stays, and assist epidemiologic monitoring for public health. in 2015, the first CLIA-waived nucleic acid amplification test for the detection of influenza virus was cleared by the fda. in 2018 the FDA implemented more-stringent performance requirements for rapid influenza immunoassays (8). NP aspirates (NPA) and nasal washes (NW) have largely been supplanted by NP swabs (NPS) due to the convenience and ease of use. some test kits utilize a nasal swab (NS), which is more comfortable for the patient. dipstick chromatography is a variation of the lateral flow assay in which the test membrane is vertically dipped into a clinical sample in buffer. uses direct nasal swab BD Veritor system for rapid detection of flu A+B becton, Dickinson, Sparks, MD. PS, NA, NW No 10 Uses direct swab without VTM Sofia influenza A+B FIA Quidel, San Diego, CA, USA Fluorescence (digital) immunoassay Influenza A & B nucleoproteins NS, NPS, NA Sofia and Sofia 2 analyzers 15 Incubate and read in reader in \u201cwalk away\u201d mode. manufacturers obtained new 510(k) clearance and demonstrated compliance with the special controls listed in Tables 2 and 3. some antigen kits require use of swabs provided in kit; use of small volumes of viral transport medium will enhance sensitivity. newer versions of the instruments, becton Dickinson BD Veritor Plus and Quidel Sofia 2, have more features than the original instruments. the sensitivity in published studies has averaged 54 to 61% compared to that for NAAT (16\u201318). the sensitivity in published studies has averaged 54 to 61%. the pooled sensitivities for influenza A virus detection were 54.4% for RIDTs, 80.0% for DIAs, and 95.4% for NAATs. the pooled specificities for studies in children were higher by 12.1 to 31.8 percentage points for immunoassays. the FDA reclassified these immunoassays in 2017 from class I devices (low likelihood of harm) with general controls to class II devices (moderate likelihood of harm) with special controls (8). the class change imposes clear performance standards for sensitivity (80% versus NAAT and 80 to 90% versus culture) and a requirement to report test performance annually against circulating strains. current CLIA-waived rapid antigen tests apply only to rapid immunoassays for influenza and not for RSV. there are currently no CLIA-waived immunoassays for other respiratory viruses available in the united states. QuickVue influenza A+B (Quidel, San Diego, CA, USA) uses a dipstick format and has a similar direct swab procedure but accepts washes and aspirates in addition to swabs. in this test, the extraction reagent is dispensed into the extraction well of the device. the swab is then left in the extraction well 1 min, after which it is again rotated 3 times and then removed. the advantages of rapid antigen testing at POC are simplicity, low cost, speed (15 min) and when the results are read visually, no equipment is required. RIDTs can also be useful for outbreak identification in nursing homes, cruise ships, schools. the target viral analyte contained in a liquid clinical sample is transported laterally on a horizontal nitrocellulose membrane by capillary flow. a control line is produced when a nontarget analyte in the sample is captured by immobilized antibodies, indicating a valid test. BD Veritor Plus has both \u201canalyze now\u201d and \u201cwalk away\u201d modes. oproteins NS, NPS No 10\u201315 Marketed under many different names QuickVue influenza A+B Quidel, San Diego, CA, USA Dipstick immunochromatography Influenza A & B nucleoproteins NS, NPS, NA, NW No 10 Uses direct swab without VTM Sofia influenza A+B FIA Quidel, San Diego, CA, USA Fluorescence (digital) immunoassay Influenza A & B nucle two commercially available lateral flow tests use an instrument-based digital scan of the test strip to enhance the detection of virus antigens. one uses a reflectance-based measurement of colloidal metal particles to evaluate the line signal intensities on the assay test strip. the other uses europium-based fluorescent-labeled antibodies substitute for chromophores. newer versions of the instruments, becton Dickinson BD Veritor Plus and Quidel Sofia 2, have more features than the original instruments. the sensitivity in published studies has averaged 54 to 61% compared to that for NAAT (16\u201318). sensitivity is superior in young children less than 2 years of age, due to higher viral shedding. sensitivity can be lower by 13 to 65 percentage points (20, 21) for DIAs, the results for BD Veritor and Quidel Sofia are consistently positive. industry-sponsored studies reported significantly higher sensitivities (87% versus 78%). fda reclassified RIDTs in 2017 from class I devices (low likelihood of harm) with general controls to class II devices (moderate likelihood of harm) with special controls (8). the new performance standards apply only to rapid immunoassays for influenza and not for RSV. the two DIAs, Becton Dickinson BD Veritor and Quidel Sofia, are still available. quickVue influenza A+B (Quidel, San Diego, CA, USA) uses a dipstick format and has a similar direct swab procedure but accepts washes and aspirates in addition to swabs. the swab is then left in the extraction well 1 min, after which it is again rotated in one direction 3 times and then removed. RIDT sensitivity is 95.1% and the specificity is 98.4% compared to PCR. it is not clear whether randomly selected sample samples were limited to those with high viral loads. the advantages of rapid antigen testing at POC are simplicity, low cost, speed (15 min) the 2009 influenza pandemic was key in accelerating the commercial development of user-friendly nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) because of its greater sensitivity, NAAT is currently considered the laboratory method of choice for the detection of respiratory viruses. in recent years, some NAAT options have become streamlined into simpler and faster technologies, which involve the addition of the sample to a device. multiplex NAAT enables simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses. nicking enzyme nucleic acid (NEAR) isothermal amplification technique used by Alere i enables rapid amplification in a very narrow temperature range. Xpert Xpress flu has two influenza A gene targets instead of one. the assay time has been reduced from 60 to 30 min. rtRT-PCR is limited to no more than 4 to 5 targets in a single reaction vessel. CLIA-waived cepheid Xpert Xpress testing at POC is currently limited to two Cepheid GeneXpert instruments, GXII and GXIV. current CLIA-waived molecular amplification tests target only influenza A and B viruses and/or RSV and other respiratory viruses. RT-PCR Influenza A & B (Flu A: PB2; Flu B: M) NS direct Accula dock 30 RT-PCR followed by hybridization and colorimetric visualization on a test strip BioFire FilmArray RP EZ BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT Multiplex nested PCR Adenovirus, CoV, hMPV, RV/EV, influenza A and B, A/H1, A/H3, A/H1 RT PCR Influenza A & B, RSV (Flu A: M, PB2, PA; Flu B: M, NSP) NPS, NA, NW GXII and GXIV 30 GXII and GXIV. no CT values provided in waived tests. the sensitivities of Alere i influenza A & B were 99.3% for influenza A and 96.7% for influenza B, with specificities of 98.1% and 100% respectively. the sensitivities varied from 50 to 82% among the different POC sites in this study. Alere i influenza A & B assay was compared to another CLIA-waived NAAT (Roche cobas Liat) using NPS in VTM from adults, Alere i detected 63.8%. Roche cobas Liat detected 97.9% of influenza virus positives. positives with low viral loads (mean CT, 31.1) were missed (12). a second study, performed on frozen samples by laboratory personnel, reported 100% sensitivity of Alere i RSV in young children. Cepheid Xpert Xpress flu is an improved and faster version of the previous Cepheid Xpert flu test. the cobas Liat has two options: Xpert Xpress Flu and Xpert Xpress flu/RSV. the bioFire FilmArray RP has shown sensitivities and specificities similar to those of real-time PCR, except for adenovirus (37, 38). a newer version of the RP, v.1.7, has been modified to detect adenoviruses more efficiently (37, 38), but reliability in the POC setting performed by nonlaboratory personnel has not yet been published. d instruments are LIS capable for Roche Liat and Cepheid Xpert Xpress. but not for Alere i, Accula Mesa Biotech or filmArray RP EZ. similar performance is anticipated due to the frequency of inclusion of samples with higher CT values (low viral load) invalid results, necessitating repeats, as well as instrument failures, can be problematic with NAAT and consume time and resources. molecular assays have been shown to be vulnerable to genomic drifts and shifts, leading to performance variation from year to year. in 2014 to 2015, decreased sensitivity was reported with multiple commercial molecular assays. rtRT-PCR followed by hybridization and colorimetric visualization on a test strip for Accula Flu A/Flu B (Mesa Biotech, Inc., San Diego, CA) multiplex NAAT enables simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses. rtRT-PCR is limited to no more than 4 to 5 targets in a single reaction vessel. current iterations allow for the detection of influenza A, influenza B, plus or minus RSV, and an internal control. CLIA-waived Alere i, Mesa Biotech Accula, Roche cobas Liat, and BioFire FilmArray instruments accept only one sample at a time. multiple instruments must be obtained to increase throughput. current CLIA-waived molecular amplification tests target only influenza A and B viruses and/or RSV only.

LIS capable for Alere i, Accula Mesa Biotech, or filmArray RP EZ. invalid results, necessitating repeats, as well as instrument failures, can be problematic with NAAT and consume time and resources. in 2014 to 2015, decreased sensitivity was reported with multiple commercial molecular assays for several clades of the 3C genetic group of influenza A H3N2 compared to that for archived virus from previous years (35). this led to improvements in the tests, including the use of two influenza A virus targets in Cepheid Xpert X innovative efforts to improve the sensitivity of POC immunoassays for influenza and RSV can be expected to accelerate if manufacturers hope to remain competitive. the most sensitive molecular testing can now be done on site, in the ED, clinics, and large physician practices. the cost of NAAT are substantially greater at present."}
