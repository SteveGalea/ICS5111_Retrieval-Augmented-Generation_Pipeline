{"summary": "young children with persistent wheezing pose a diagnostic and therapeutical challenge to the pediatrician. we aimed to evaluate bacterial bronchial infection as a possible reason for non response to conventional asthma therapy. despite the high morbidity of persistent infantile wheezing, there are only few comprehensive studies in this domain. in daily practice preschool wheezers remain a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the pediatrician [4,5] current asthma guidelines recommend a trial with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in these children, based on the established pathophysiology of eosinophilic inflammation and the proven efficacy in asthma in adults. FOB + BAL is always performed under stable condition, outside episodes of acute infection or exacerbation of respiratory symptoms. children with symptoms other than wheezing, such as chronic wet cough, recurrent bronchitis and stridor, being the main reason for FOB + BAL were excluded. ovirus subtypes A and B; coronaviruses 229E and OC43, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae using an in-house multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR)- protocol. the performance of this test was assessed by regular participation in the external quality programme organised by QCMD. a cell suspension of 2.106 cells/l was made in phosphate-buffered saline with 1 % bovine serum albumin (PBS-BSA) two hundred cells were examined for differential cell counts. the median percentage of neutrophils in BAL-fluid of healthy children is 0.9-3.5 %.

NTHI isolates were -lactamase negative and susceptible to ampicillin and cefuroxime. the latter isolate was -lactamase positive, with a MIC = 2g/ml for amoxicillin-clavulanate and MIC = 3g/ml for cefuroxime. Cytology of BAL-fluid differed significantly between patients with NTHI-isolated from BAL and patients with a negative BAL-culture. table 3. Cytology of BAL in patients with NTHI-isolated from BAL compared to patients with a negative BAL-culture. tracheobronchomalacia has been shown to be highly associated with bronchial inflammation and bacterial infection in children with persistent respiratory symptoms. tracheobronchomalacia has been shown to be highly associated with bronchial inflammation and bacterial infection in children with persistent respiratory symptoms. a cut-off of 104 cfu/ml for bacterial BAL-culture has shown to be discriminative. the applied cut-off was also used previously by others, studying children with chronic bronchitis. the results probably reflect chronic bronchial infection. biofilm formation and intracellular infection are well established mechanisms of NTHi for persistence in the lower airways of young unresponsive wheezers. findings suggest biofilm formation should be addressed in future studies, because its presence may have consequences for treatment. bacterial infection is frequent in children with persistent wheezing unresponsive to adequate inhaled asthma treatment. findings favour the hypothesis that chronic bacterial infection is an ongoing inflammatory stimulus providing a possible explanation for persistent wheezing despite ICS therapy.
