{"summary": "influenza A viruses cause acute respiratory diseases in humans, birds, and other mammals. an avian strain can adapt to the human host and attain human-to-human transmission capability through acquired mutations. seasonal flu is responsible for about 50,000 deaths per year. two neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir, were approved in 1999 for treatment and prevention for acute uncomplicated flu caused by influenza A and B. resistant virus strains are constantly emerging, especially to zanamivir, due to its low bioavailability. hemagglutinin is encoded by the fourth negative-stranded RNA segment of influenza A viral genomes. this RNA segment encodes HA0 with 566 residues. HA0 undergoes an extra- or intra-cellular cleavage process into HA1 and HA2, which is a critical step for the maturation of influenza virus progenies to acquire their infectivity. the globular head of the \u201cmushroom\u201d is mainly constructed with HA1 subdomains. receptor binding subdomain of HA1 recognizes -2,3 or -2,6 linked terminal sialic acids (SAs) in membrane glycoprotein receptor of host cell. the stem of the \u201cmushroom\u201d is composed of the inner trimeric HA2 ectodomain subunits. HA1 resembles a shallow pocket, whose structure is composed of barrel motif and -helices, located on the surface of globular head of the HA1. terminal SAs of cell membrane glycoprotein sit on top of two aromatic residues of HA1 (Y98 and W153 at the bottom of the binding pocket of HA1) avian influenza viruses HA bind predominantly with -2,3 linked terminal SAs. most of these residues are highly conserved among all 16 subtypes of HA. avian influenza viruses have to acquire adequate binding avidity to -2,6 linked terminal SAs. -2,3 linked terminal SAs, residues H179, Q223, G224 in H5typed HA1 fail to form interactions with -2,6 linked terminal SAs. mutations in 130-loop, 190-helix or 220-loop result in altered HA1 binding specificity for SAs. these mutations change the receptor binding preference from the avian -2,3 to the human -2,6 SAs, which resulted in the 1918 H1N1 and polyvalent sialosides show high potency in vitro. multivalent -2,6-sialyloligosaccharides could be effective for the protection against newly emerging pandemic influenza virus strains. in 2009, a smaller peptide P1 (CNDFRSKTC) with similar inhibitory mechanism to EB was also derived [23]. these results indicate that the HA-binding peptides are promising candidates for antiviral drugs as well as anti-HA antibodies. antigenic sites were identified from natural influenza virus isolates. they were designated as Sa (residues 128\u2013129 near the receptor binding site 130-loop, 156\u2013160, 162\u2013167) and Sb (residues 187\u2013198, overlapping receptor binding site 190-helix), near the top surface of globular head of HA. the conserved HA stem domain elicits cross-reactive antibodies. but epitopes in the globular head typically elicit strain-specific responses. receptor binding sites are more conserved, since mutations interfering receptor binding are most likely to impair viral adsorption and infectivity. DAS181 is a 46 kDa recombinant fusion protein composed of a sialidase catalytic domain derived from Actinomyces viscosus fused with a mucosal cell surfaceanchoring domain. by cleaving SAs from the host cell surface, DAS181 inactivates the host cell receptors for viral adsorption, thereby blocking viral entry into respiratory epithelial cells. -c01 and C18-c03 respectively could inhibit the infection of influenza A/PR/8/34 virus with IC50 values of 3.2 and 6.5 M. terminal SAs of cell membrane glycoprotein sit on top of two aromatic residues of HA1 (Y98 and W153 at the bottom of the binding pocket) a theoretical investigation by molecular dynamics (MD simulation) revealed that Y91 at the bottom of binding pocket of HA1 forms hydrogen bonds with -2,3 or -2,6 residues in 130-loop (R130, V132, T133, A134, S142), 190-helix (D187) and 220-loop (G222, Q223, A224) form direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonds with -2,3 linked terminal SAs. residues in 130-loop (S129, V131, S132, S133, S141), 190-helix (H179, N182, E186, K189) and 220-loop ( 1-typed HA1 (E190D in 190-helix and G225D in 220-loop) change the receptor binding preference from the avian -2,3 to the human -2,6 SAs. mutations in HPAI H5N1 viruses do not cause a switch in binding specificity. but substitutions at positions 129 and 134 in 130-loop of HA1 could change the receptor-binding preference of H5N1 HA from 2,3 to both a docking simulation suggested that the peptides mimic the structure and binding ability of SAs. in 2006, a 20-amino-acid peptide (EB) was found to exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity against influenza viruses in vitro and in vivo. fusion activity, virulence, receptor-binding specificity, virus susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors, and immune evasion of IAV. surfactant protein D (SP-D) plays an important role in innate defense against IAV. no clear examples of antibodies targeting glycans on HA have yet been reported. antigenic sites in H3-typed HA have been suggested. site A (residues 140\u2013146, near the receptor binding site 130-loop), site B (187\u2013196, overlaps receptor binding site 190-helix), site C (residues 53\u201354 and 275\u2013278, disulfide bound between Cys52 and Cys277). receptor-binding bnmAbs F045-092 and CH65 have been isolated from B cells [32,34] suggesting that receptor-binding site antibodies can be found naturally. DAS181 is the only host-targeting drug candidate under clinical development in influenza field. aves both the -2,6-SA and the -2,3-SA presents a potent inhibitory effect against a panel of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of influenza A and B viruses. new research revealed that DAS181 is also active against oseltamivir-resisitant H1N1 strains. a polypeptide, T20, has become the first HIV entry inhibitors targeting gp41 trimer structure with the approval by US FDA [41] it is a kind of new type of antiviral drugs, suitable for HIV patients with drug resistance. a chemical method called hydrocarbon stapling is applied to design spiral polypeptides with the cell membrane penetrability. antiviral polypeptide with the haemagglutinin as the target. 4.2. inhibitors Preventing low pH-Triggering HA conformation change. but before fusion, it is necessary to confirm whether the three polymers possesses the target point suitable for combination before fusion or during the fusion transition state. TBHQ can stop the infection of H14-subtype influenza virus rather than H5N1. in HA2 subunit of H5-subtype hemagglutinin, K58 and E97 form the salt bridge. two compounds were found with better antiviral activity, IC50 = 0.8 M) and IC50 = 8 M. CL-61917 is able to bind this part of a cavity and may prevent HA restructuring triggered by the low pH. the 5-fluoro analog of CL-61917 is more potent than CL-61917 in inhibiting H1 and H2 influenza virus infection. researchers from japan found a few anti-influenza membrane fusion inhibitors. stachyflin stops the fusion of virus membrane through the interfering with HA restructuring triggered by low pH. the same team also designed and synthesized stachyflin derivatives. ly-180299 can stabilize the structure of HA neutral state and prevent low pH-triggering HA restructuring. lead compound RO5464466 and its 2-chloro analogue RO5487624 can effectively prevent the infection of influenza A/Weiss/43 strain. more cases in the chloroquine group are found catching laboratory-confirmed influenza infection. most of the founded small molecules are more potent in inhibiting group 1 IAV than group 2 IAVs. antibodies induced by HA2 do not have virus-neutralizing activity. monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to the fusion peptide were able to inhibit the HA fusion activity and to reduce virus replication in vitro, and also in vivo. anti-M2e mAbs TCN-032 can bind to a novel conformational epitope on the N-terminus of the M2e protein. the epitope recognized by TCN-032 is conserved in over 98% of known influenza A strains. a polypeptide derived from HA2 subunit cannot pass through the cell membrane to get in the endosome, or become unstable in the acidic conditions. a chemical method called hydrocarbon stapling is applied to design spiral polypeptides with the cell membrane penetrability in the study of HIV. it was found some peptides have activity to fight against HIV. hemagglutinin says conservative target holes exist in HA2 spiral-screw parts. a few small molecular compounds can prevent low pH from triggering HA restructuring. the most promising benzodiazepine derivative is TBHQ, which can restrain virus infection in the M concentration. scientists from Wyeth-Ayerst found three compounds, CL-61917 (N-replaced piperidine), CL385319 and CL-62554, can inhibit the activity of H1- and H2- subtype avian influenza. IC50 reaches a micromole level. a few anti-influenza membrane fusion inhibitors are stachyflin and its derivatives separated from fermentation broth medium of botryoid ear mould. two point mutations were found, K51R and K121E, which are located in HA2 subunit. esized stachyflin derivatives, such as acetylstachyflin, have better bioavailability and antiviral activity. BMY-27709, combined with HA, prevents low pH triggering HA restructuring. ly-180299 has strong inhibition toward A/Kawasaki/86 H1N1. chloro analogue RO5487624 can effectively prevent the infection of influenza A/Weiss/43 strain (H1N1) with EC50 values of 210 and 86 nM, respectively. in vitro assays suggest that chloroquine may have utility in the treatment of several viral infections including influenza. hemagglutinin plays an important role in viral binding to receptors, virus entry and membrane fusion. anti-HA monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are considered one of the important passive therapeutics for treatment of influenza. the H surface protein is crucial for replication of the influenza virus. once this site is bound by an antibody, the virus cannot fuse with membranes inside the host\u2019s cells and therefore cannot reproduce. CR6261 cannot neutralize the H3subtype likely due to glycosylation at residue position of N38. avian flu virus X31 HA crystal structure and H1, H5, H9, H7-subtype avian influenza virus HA crystal structure are unfolding. each monomer of HA can be hydrolyzed into subunits HA1 and HA2 by host protease. only after six residues of the C-terminal of HA1 and 12 residues of the N-terminal of HA2 can fuse. cow pancreas inhibitor protease peptide (Trasylol bayer) has been applied to the clinical practice. but it was withdrawn from the clinical application with the study finding that the drug could increase mortality in 2008. chin derivatives possess broad spectrum anti-influenza activity. curcumin, the widely used spice and coloring agent in Indian food, was proved to be a good virus entry inhibitor targeting HA with EC50 value of 0.47 M. a number of protein-based or small molecule anti-IAV agents have been shown to interfere with the HA-mediated membrane fusion. novel influenza virus entry inhibitors may provide more selections for combination therapy with NA inhibitors and M2 ion channel blockers for treating and preventing influenza virus infection and potential pandemic outbreak."}
