{"summary": "feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is an immune-mediated disease caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection. the development of FIP was only observed in fewer than 5% of the FCoV-infected cats. genetic polymorphisms in the host were suggested to be important in the resistance to FIP [2]. NG gene were sequenced and analyzed from 82 asymptomatic cats and 64 asymptomatic cats from 2005 to 2012. all asymptomatic healthy cats were three years old or younger and had positive reverse transcription-nested PCR test results for FCoV infection. primers were aligned to either the 5\u2032 proximal regulatory region and intron 1 or the 5\u2032 untranslated region and exon 2 of fIFNG. the PCR products were then sequenced from both ends using an auto sequencer ABI 3730XL (Applied Biosystems, San Mateo, USA) GGTTAGCATGAA +428 F (universal) +288 +307 TACCCTCTCTGCTCAACTTGCT 67\u00b0C 232 bp R (universal) +519 +500 AAGGTCAGGGTTAGCATGAA F (T allele) +419 +500 CTGTGATGTGTC 112 bp R (C allele) +449 +427 GGCTAGTCTTCAATAGGC 162 bp a PCR reactions contained 1 L of template DNA, each primer at 500 nM, 200 M dNTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.4 U Phusion DNA polymerase. the PCR products were resolved in 2% agarose gels and photographed using an imaging system. the digested DNA was resolved in 2% agarose gels and photographed using an imaging system. two viral pathogens, i.e. feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV), were checked in FIP cats using nested PCR [25,26], and the positive cats were omitted from the association analysis. the genomic DNA from each cat was extracted using a genomic DNA mini kit (Geneaid Biotech, New Taipei City, Taiwan) GTAAGCTGGGTA Genotypingg +401 F (universal) +320 +341 GGGGCATTCATCAGTCTTCCAG 56\u00b0C 200 bp R (universal) +519 +500 AAGGTCAGTTTTCCAG 138 bp R (C allele) +418 +400 CAACATCACAGTCTAATGG 99 bp +408 F +320 +341 GGGTCTTTTCCAG 56\u00b0C 200 bp R ( a Fisher\u2019s exact test value of P 0.05 was considered to represent a significant association. the concentration of IFN- in the plasma samples was determined using an antigen capture ELISA (R & D system, McKinley Place NE, USA) in the 2067 bp analyzed, 3 repeat regions and 16 SNP were identified. intron 1 was more polymorphic than the upstream region of fIFNG. the mean allele frequencies of the minor alleles ranged from 4.8% to 47.6%. fIFNG + 230 and fIFNG + 308 and fIFNG + 401 and fIFNG + 408 had a high degree of LD and were inherited together 100% of the time. fifNG + 428C/T was significantly associated with the outcome of FCoV infection. 29 type I FCoV-infected FIP cats were selected for further analysis. the heterozygous genotype (CT genotype) at positions +401 and +408 were found to be significantly associated with susceptibility to FIP. the concentrations of IFN- for cat 14, 17, and 69 were 52, 138 and > 8000 pg/mL. these three animals were the only cats carrying the resistant allele (T allele) at position +428. fIFNG + 401/+408, however, no clear correlation between the IFN- responses and genotypes was observed. for fIFNG + 408, RFLP was used for genotyping. the digested PCR products for the T allele could be found at 151 bp and 54 bp. the digested PCR products for the T allele could be found at 113 bp, 54 bp, and 43 bp. a partial fIFNG sequence of 2067 bp was sequenced in this study. the 5\u2032 proximal regulatory region, 5\u2032 UTR, exon 1 and a partial exon 2 region. a 115 bp region between 2 repeat regions of unknown sequence. the analysis of allele frequency and disease outcome also revealed that the T allele at position +428 was significantly associated with resistance to FIP (p = 0.03). the analysis of allele frequency and disease outcome also revealed that the T allele at position +428 was significantly associated with resistance to FIP (p = 0.03). fIFNG + 408 TT 43 (52.4) 11 (37.9) 0.4 (0.2-0.9) 0.004 CT 26 (31.7) 18 (62.1) Reference CC 13 (15.9) 0 (0.0) n/aa Allele C 112 (68.3) 40 (69.0). concentration of IFN- in plasma samples from 15 FIP cats was measured. fIFNG + 428C/T and fIFNG + 408C/T were also shown to be associated with the type I FCoV-infected FIP population. ARMS-PCR specific for fIFNG + 428C/T and fIFNG + 408C/T was attempted. several viral genes, including spike[31-33], accessory gene 3c[34-36] and 7b [37-39] and membrane[40], have been proposed to play important roles in the development of the disease in FCoV-infected cats. the knowledge of the host genetic factors that affect FIP is still very limited, and only two studies have reported such factors.
