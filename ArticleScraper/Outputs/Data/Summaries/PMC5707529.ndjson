{"summary": "the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a central role on the cellular as well as on the viral side. the cell expresses restriction factors, some of which are themselves components of the UPS, targeting viral proteins for degradation. however, viruses have evolved to use the UPS to their own benefits, subverting components of the UPS to degrade restriction factors. ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 first forms a high-energy thiol-ester link with ubiquitin in an ATP dependent manner. ubiquitin is then transferred onto a thiol group of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2. ubiquitin ligase E3 transfers ubiquitin onto a lysine of its substrate. the 20S proteasome is a barrel-shaped structure composed of four rings. two outer rings composed of seven -subunits and two inner rings composed of seven -subunits. the 26S proteasome is formed by association of a 20S proteasome with two 19S lids. this ensures specific recognition of ubiquitinated substrates. some cellular E3 ubiquitin ligases recognize viral proteins and induce their ubiquitination. ubiquitination of the p6 domain of the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein is important for the interaction of p6 with the ESCRT machinery. however, the mono-ubiquitination of lysine residues within the p6 domain does not seem to be sufficient to facilitate budding of new virions. TRIM5 was reported to inhibit HSV-1 and -2 replication at an early stage of the infection cycle [30], suggesting a role for this or related protein in cytosolic sensing of herpesvirus capsids. some viruses have evolved to recruit the cellular E3 ligases to induce the degradation of cellular proteins that might have harmful effects. ICP0 has a RING-independent E3 ligase activity that polyubiquitinates the E2 enzyme cdc34. ubiquitin modifications can be reversed by the isopeptide-bond specific proteolytic activity of DUBs. treatment with DUB inhibitors targeting USP47 causes a general Gag processing defect. proteasome inhibitors have been shown to impact HIV-1 replication by reducing release and maturation of infectious particles. the integrated provirus mediates the synthesis of new full-length viral RNA (or unspliced RNA), which will be used as genomic RNA encapsidated into viral particles. the components of the viral particle assemble at the plasma membrane, where new viral particles bud, maturate and disseminate to other host cells. TRIM5 (TRIpartite Motif-containing protein 5) can inhibit the early steps of the viral life cycle in a species-specific manner. the viral capsid protein also seems to be the target of myxovirus resistance 2 (Mx2/B), a restriction factor that inhibits nuclear import and subsequent integration of the provirus through an unknown mechanism. two of these restriction factors, TRIM5 and March8, use the UPS to exert their restricting activity. Nef prevents SERINC5 incorporation into virions by mediating its relocalization to late endosomes. Vif counteracts A3G by inducing its proteasomal degradation. the restriction of HIV-1 by TRIM5 is mediated by the interaction of the TRIM5 SPRY domain with the viral capsid in the cytoplasm of newly infected cells. this interaction leads to premature decapsidation of the viral core. TRIM5 is also degraded by the proteasome but only in the presence of susceptible viral cores. M5 with the viral capsid enhances its E3-ubiquitin ligase activity. this leads to the synthesis of free K63-linked ubiquitin chains. TRIM5 also functions as a sensor that induces a general antiviral state of the cell. March8 is a transmembrane E3-ubiquitin ligase, possessing an N-terminal, cytoplasmic RING domain. it is known to downregulate multiple cellular proteins from the plasma membrane by ubiquitination followed by degradation in the endo-lysosomal pathway. the RING domain of March8 is necessary for this mechanism, suggesting that ubiquitination plays a role. TRIM5 is mediated by the interaction of the TRIM5 SPRY (SPIa and RYanodine Receptor) domain with the viral capsid in the cytoplasm of newly infected cells. this interaction leads to premature decapsidation of the viral core. the reverse transcription of the viral genome is inhibited in the presence of a restricting TRIM5. TRIM5 (red) recognizes the viral capsid and 1 induces proteasomal degradation of the capsid (blue), the integrase (yellow) and itself. 2 TRIM5 also blocks integration of the provirus (red T bar) and 3 induces activation of AP1 and NF-B pathways. the RING-domain of March8 is necessary for this mechanism, suggesting that ubiquitination plays a role. however, Env does not seem to be degraded in the endo-lysosomal pathway like cellular proteins targeted by March8. March8 thus sequesters Env away from HIV-1 budding sites. HIV-1 counteracts A3G with its Vif protein, which prevents its incorporation into virions by inducing its degradation through the proteasome. APOBEC3G is incorporated into virions and induces hypermutations of the provirus leading either to its degradation or production of truncated viral proteins. the recruitment of Elongin B and C is mediated by the BC-box domain of Vif [105] and Cullin5 in turn recruits the E2-ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Rbx2. the cellular protein HDAC6 (Histone Deacetylase 6) has been shown to play a role in this process, by inducing Vif degradation through autophagosomes. Vif is also able to recruit these A3 proteins by different motifs of its N-terminal domain. this restriction factor causes a block in early steps of the HIV-1 life cycle [67] by depleting the intracellular pool of dNTPs [68], which leads to abortion of the viral genomic RNA reverse transcription and accumulation of defective viral cDNA. the nuclear localization of SAMHD1 is required for its Vpx-induced proteasomal degradation. the protein allows HIV-2 to efficiently infect human dendritic and myeloid cells and it significantly increases the infection by HIV-1. Vpr protein of some strains has been shown to induce proteasomal degradation of SAMHD1. the ability to degrade SAMHD1 has first been acquired by the Vpr protein in certain lentiviral strains. however, many lineages, like HIV-1 for example, lack an anti-SAMHD1 activity. tetherin/BST-2 is found as a disulfide-bond-linked dimer anchored into the plasma membrane by two domains. the extracellular domain of BST-2 acts like a molecular ruler. the extracellular domain of BST-2 acts like a molecular ruler. Vpu sequesters BST-2 away from virion budding sites, preventing it from incorporation into the viral envelope. it is still a matter of debate whether Vpu also uses the endo-lysosomal system for BST-2 counteraction by Vpu. degradation of BST-2 might not be absolutely required for viral counteraction of BST-2, since Vpu is capable of intracellular sequestration of BST-2 independently of its degradation. the guanylate binding protein 5 (GBP5) has recently been discovered as a new restriction factor of HIV-1 infection, that interferes with viral Env proteins. the family of apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme is a family of 7 cytosine deaminases (A3A to A3H) which induce transition of cytosine to uracil on single-stranded DNA. the mutations can be recognized by uracil DNA glycosylases, like the virion-associated UNG2 (Uracyl N-Glycosylase 2). APOBEC3G is incorporated into virions and induces hypermutations of the provirus leading either to its degradation or production of truncated viral proteins. APOBEC3G (red) decreases A3G transcription 1, inhibits its translation 2 (Red T bar) and induces its degradation by the proteasome 3. ligase can induce ubiquitination of Vif and its proteasomal degradation. CBF- is also necessary to allow assembly of the SCF-like E3-ubiquitin ligase mediated by Vif. degradation of A3G through the UPS has been known for a long time. this restriction factor causes a block in the early steps of the HIV-1 life cycle [67] by depleting the intracellular pool of dNTPs [68], which leads to abortion of the viral genomic RNA reverse transcription and accumulation of defective viral cDNA. this block strongly affects infectivity of HIV-1 in these cell types but has no effect on HIV-2 infectivity [121] Vpx induces SAMHD1 ubiquitination followed by its degradation by the proteasome. the protein of some SIV strains has been shown to induce proteasomal degradation of SAMHD1. many lineages lack an anti-SAMHD1 activity. CDK2 is phosphorylated in cycling cells which blocks its activity as a dNTP hydrolase. this correlates with the permissiveness of cycling cells for HIV-1 infection. despite lack of a viral factor counteracting SAMHD1 by different cellular proteins. Vpu sequesters BST-2 away from virion budding sites either at the plasma membrane 1 or in intracellular compartments 2. the viral protein Vpu counteracts BST-2 by direct interaction of their transmembrane domains embedded in the plasma membrane. the cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor -TrCP is known to be recruited by the cytoplasmic DSGxxS motif of Vpu. it could lead to ubiquitination of BST-2 followed by its degradation in the endo-lysosomal system. conflicting data have also been reported. Vpu mutants appear to occur frequently despite the presence of BST-2. some of them lack the Vpu gene and rely on the accessory protein Nef to counteract this mechanism. cellular ER-associated degradation pathway operates as a quality control mechanism to dispose of unwanted ER membrane proteins into the cytosol for subsequent proteasomal degradation. the degradation of CD4 depends also on ubiquitination of serine/threonine residues. Vpr can also induce the degradation of A3G itself through the UPS. the main function of Vpr known to date is the induction of a cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase. the main function of Vpr known to date is the induction of a cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase. this strategy is not limited to HIV, but is used by a plethora of different viruses to ensure various aspects of their life cycles. the specific degradation of certain cellular proteins in the UPS allows viruses to generate a favorable environment for their own replication."}
