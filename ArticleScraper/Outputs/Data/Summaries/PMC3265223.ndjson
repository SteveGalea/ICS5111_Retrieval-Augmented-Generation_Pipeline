{"summary": "a variety of new approaches is currently being explored, one of which is based on the use of viruses. oncolytic viruses are defined by their ability to specifically kill tumor cells, but to leave the normal tissues unharmed. their most characteristic features, thus, are their target specificity and their cytolytic capacity. this review outlines the recent developments in transductional targeting of viruses. it will focus on the three strategies for retargeting of viruses that seem most promising for the development of new oncolytic viruses. in section 3, approaches are described by which scaffold-based modifications of viral surface proteins were applied to direct virions to new target cells. the ability to genetically modify the viral genome is crucial. detailed structural information about the viral surface protein to be modified is indispensible to predict at which location targeting motifs might be tolerated. the targeting ligand introduced into the viral protein will have to meet size limitations. adenoviruses are among the most extensively studied viruses for oncolytic viral therapy. in a wild-type infection, adenovirus-binding to the cells is mediated by its major attachment factor, the fiber protein. adenoviruses are among the most extensively studied viruses for oncolytic viral therapy. adenoviruses showed superior infectivity to viruses with the same peptide fused to the fiber C terminus. ligand-flanking linkers were extended and tandem copies of the peptide were inserted. antibody-based targeting could be achieved for adenoviruses by generating fiber chimeras [6] or fusions of scFvs with the capsid protein IX [7] herpesvirus infects cells by attachment to heparan sulfate proteoglycans. the second involves nectin1 and nectin2, both intercellular adhesion molecules belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. somatostatin receptors appear to be overexpressed on hepatocellular carcinoma cells. the subsequent recombinant virus appeared to infect the carcinoma cells as well as the wild-type virus, while showing reduced infectivity for other cell lines. retroviruses-Murine leukemia Virus (MuLV) have gained interest as oncolytic agents. retargeting in combination with ablation of its natural tropism will remain crucial to develop this virus into a safe oncolytic vector. the choice of receptor will be of ultimate importance for the successful targeting of retrovirus vectors towards tumor cells. despite its entry into a wide range of cells, a natural preference for replication in cancer tissue has been reported. the future challenge for the transductional targeting of vaccinia virus towards tumor cells will lie in the elimination of the target cells. coronaviruses-Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) is responsible for receptor binding and subsequent cell entry through virus-cell membrane fusion. entry by MHV is mediated by the murine carcinoembryonic antigen (CEACAM1a) receptor. retargeting of recombinant viruses based on new binding properties of modified spike protein failed. ant viruses were unable to redirect MHV to human tumor cells. modification of viral surface proteins for redirecting coronavirus to tumor cells. insertion of small peptide ligands, including RGD and NGR. heterologous peptide ligands have been engineered into many adenoviral proteins. most commonly targeting moieties are inserted in the HI loop of the fiber knob. adenoviruses showed superior infectivity to that of viruses with the same peptide fused to the fiber C terminus. also antibody-based targeting could be achieved for adenoviruses. measles virus has two envelope glycoproteins: the hemagglutinin (H) attachment protein and the fusion (F) protein. a range of ligands, including both peptides and scFvs, were tolerated. the nature of the ligands was pivotal. the current strategies to redirect HSV towards tumor cells have recently been reviewed [18, 19]. gamma herpes virus saimiri the native binding region of the viral glycoprotein ORF51 to heparan sulphate was replaced with that of a peptide sequence interacting with somatostatin receptors. the results showed that all mutant capsids were efficiently incorporated. only one of these effectively infected wild-type AAV2-resistant cell lines expressed the integrin receptor recognized by L14. successful targeting was demonstrated towards RGD [25] and towards the human luteinizing hormone receptor [24]. targeting towards the EGF [29], IGF [30] and folate [31] receptors was unsuccessful, despite the observed binding to cells expressing those receptors. attempts to overcome this problem by inserting a translocation domain of exotoxin A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa into the envelope protein were unsuccessful. 14 membrane-associated protein of vaccinia strain MVA could be replaced with a p14 fusion molecule carrying an inserted scFv directed against the tumor-associated antigen MUC-1 [34] the resulting fusion proteins could be expressed, were exposed on the envelope of the recombinant virus, and were able to bind the target cells. the future challenge for the transductional targeting of vaccinia virus towards tumor cells will lie in the elimination of its natural tropis some MHV strains carry an accessory hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) surface glycoprotein. recombinant viruses encoding such mutated S proteins were generated by targeted recombination. the moiety incorporated is not a tumor ligand itself but represents an attachment site for exogenously provided targeting moieties that also bind to the receptor of interest. the targeting strategy provides viruses that can only establish single-round infection, remaining dependent on the external supply of the targeting module. however, it has the advantage of flexibility as the targeting device can be changed relatively easy. chemoselective modification of the adenoviral particle could also function as a scaffold for targeting devices. initial results demonstrated increased toxicity in vitro [40]. chimeric virus was able to infect otherwise refractory cells. studies were performed to introduce the IgG-binding domain of protein A. adenoviruses could be generated by using the biotin-streptavidin coupling system. oviral particle could also be used as a scaffold for targeting devices. adenoassociated Virus The fragment of protein A was tested as a scaffold to redirect AAV. the fragment was successfully introduced into the capsid protein. studies were performed to introduce the IgG-binding domain of protein A to enable modular use of antibodies for vector targeting. by inserting this binding domain into the hinge region of the viral envelope protein virions were generated that were capable of capturing anti-HER2 antibodies. subsequent efficient binding of the virus-antibody complex to HER2-positive target cells was observed. bispecific adapters are used to target viruses towards tumor cells. a bispecific adapter targeting principle and composition are possible. in theory, all combinations of virus-binding and cell-binding arms are possible. the binding of adapter proteins to the virion has been reported to ablate the virus' natural tropism. bispecific proteins are artificial polypeptides composed of parts that do not occur linked together naturally, their proper biogenesis with independent folding of both moieties and efficient secretion may be impaired. the feasibility of using adapter proteins for oncolytic viral therapy has been explored for a number of viruses. the feasibility of using adapter proteins for oncolytic viral therapy has been explored for a number of viruses. the feasibility of using adapter proteins for oncolytic viral therapy has been explored for a number of viruses. similar approaches have been explored using antibodies directed against other adenoviral proteins. Fabs directed against the hexon protein chemically linked to Fabs binding to an antigen highly overexpressed on human hepatocellular carcinoma successfully applied to redirect adenoviruses to a nonnative receptor. bispecific molecule based on binding ability of the Gla domain of coagulation factor X to the hexon was exploited for targeting. increased infection of tumor cells by adenovirus could be observed. however, the anticipated reduction in liver transduction was not observed. the use of bispecific adapter proteins has been investigated. to narrow its specificity, the use of bispecific adapter proteins has been investigated. fMHV acquired feline cell tropism but completely lost its murine cell tropism. adapter proteins could mediate EGFR-specific entry of MHV into human cancer cells. a number of investigations focused on the expression of the bispecific adapters from the viral genome to allow the recombinant viruses to produce their own targeting device. the resulting virus Ad24-425S11 produced the bispecific protein 425-s11 during replication in cancer cells. the virus retained its capacity to infect cells through binding to the native receptors CAR and integrins. mutations were introduced that eliminated CAR and integrin binding. studies have shown the feasibility of using bispecific proteins for redirecting adenoviruses towards target cells ex vivo or in vivo in laboratory animal models. no studies have yet been performed using recombinant adenoviruses expressing a bispecific adapter from their viral genome to establish whether they have superior targeting and cell-killing abilities. the redirected virus demonstrated oncolytic capacity also in vivo. survival rates of the mice were significantly longer when the tumor-bearing animals were treated with MHVsoR-EGF-His than after treatment with control virus MHVsoR-His. coronaviruses expressing a soluble receptor that is C-terminally extended with a peptide ligand have great potential for oncolytic therapy. by expanding the targeting repertoire through exchange of peptide ligands, coronaviruses can probably be redirected towards various tumor epitopes. MHV is a safe candidate oncolytic agent for use in other mammals, including humans. recombinant MHV viruses were generated by targeted recombination. the gene cluster 2a + 2b/HE was replaced with an expression cassette downstream of the translation regulation sequence for protein 2a. the ability of such viruses to infect murine and human cells is depicted. specific proteins shown in Figure 3(a), with typical examples of the two domains being depicted in Figure 3(b). the bispecific adapter proteins actually generated to target viruses to tumor cells using bispecific adapters. in theory, all combinations of virus-binding and cell-binding arms are possible. bispecific proteins are artificial polypeptides composed of parts that do not occur linked together naturally. unless expressed by the oncolytic virus itself, production and purification of the adaptors is a challenge. a major drawback of this approach is that it allows single-round infection only. the feasibility of using adapter proteins for oncolytic viral therapy has been explored for a number of viruses. the feasibility of this strategy depends on the availability of a genetic modification system to introduce the adapter-encoding gene into the viral genome as an additional expression cassette. the capacity of the genome to accept such insertions can be limited; hence, the size of the targeting moiety might be restricted. similar approaches have been explored using antibodies directed against other adenoviral proteins. Fabs directed against the hexon protein chemically linked to Fabs binding to an antigen highly overexpressed on human hepatocellular carcinoma were successfully applied to redirect adenoviruses to a nonnative receptor. adenoviral coating with polymers may have enhanced potential for systemic delivery, as it prolongs the viral plasma half-live and reduces the hepatotoxicity in vivo. another type of bispecific molecule based on the binding ability of the Gla domain of coagulation factor X to the hexon was exploited for targeting. avian paramyxovirus NDV is responsible for sialic acid receptor attachment. the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein mediates the fusion of viral envelope and cellular membrane. to narrow its specificity, the use of bispecific adapter proteins has been investigated. studies to redirect murine coronavirus MHV to human tumor cells were based on an adapter protein that consisted of a pseudoreceptor. such adapter proteins could mediate EGFR-specific entry of MHV into human cancer cells. however, no ablation of the natural tropism of the virus was observed. the resulting virus Ad24-425S11 produced the bispecific protein 425-s11 during replication in cancer cells. the virus retained its capacity to infect cells through binding to the native receptors CAR and integrins. mutations were introduced that eliminated the native tropism of adenoviruses. studies have shown the feasibility of using bispecific proteins for redirecting adenoviruses towards target cells ex vivo or in vivo in laboratory animal models. no in vivo studies have yet been performed using recombinant adenoviruses expressing a bispecific adapter from their viral genome. the redirected virus demonstrated oncolytic capacity in vivo. survival rates of the mice were significantly longer when the tumor-bearing animals were treated with MHVsoR-EGF-His or with control virus MHVsoR-His. replication of MHV in non-tumor tissue of the natural host was observed. coronaviruses expressing a soluble receptor that is C-terminally extended with a peptide ligand have great potential for oncolytic therapy. by expanding the targeting repertoire through exchange of peptide ligands, coronaviruses can probably be redirected towards various tumor epitopes. murine coronaviruses display great species specificity in their infection. the plus-strand RNA genome contains, from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032, the polymerase precursor gene (ORF1ab), the accessory genes 2a and 2b/HE, the S gene, the nonessential genes 4ab and 5a. in the recombinant viruses, the gene cluster 2a + 2b/HE was replaced with an expression cassette downstream of the translation regulation sequence. similar approaches have been explored using antibodies directed against other adenoviral proteins. Fabs directed against the hexon protein chemically linked to Fabs binding to an antigen highly overexpressed on human hepatocellular carcinoma successfully applied to redirect adenoviruses to a nonnative receptor. bispecific molecule based on binding ability of the Gla domain of coagulation factor X to the hexon was exploited for targeting. increased infection of tumor cells by adenovirus could be observed. however, the anticipated reduction in liver transduction was not observed. the use of bispecific adapter proteins has been investigated. to narrow its specificity, the use of bispecific adapter proteins has been investigated. fMHV acquired feline cell tropism but completely lost its murine cell tropism. V to human tumor cells were based on an adapter protein that consisted of a pseudoreceptor, composed of the N-terminal domain of murine CEACAM1a (soluble receptor; soR), fused to an scFv directed against the EGFR [89] or to the EGF ligand [90]. such adapter proteins could mediate EGFR-specific entry of MHV into human cancer cells. the resulting virus Ad24-425S11 produced the bispecific protein 425-s11 during replication in cancer cells. the virus retained its capacity to infect cells through binding to the native receptors CAR and integrins. mutations were introduced that eliminated CAR and integrin binding. studies have shown the feasibility of using bispecific proteins for redirecting adenoviruses towards target cells ex vivo or in vivo in laboratory animal models. no studies have yet been performed using recombinant adenoviruses expressing a bispecific adapter from their viral genome to establish whether they have superior targeting and cell-killing abilities. the redirected virus demonstrated oncolytic capacity in vivo. none of the MHVsoR-EGF-His treated mice-recurrent tumor load could be detected. replication of MHV in non-tumor tissue of the natural host was observed. coronaviruses expressing a soluble receptor that is C-terminally extended with a peptide ligand have great potential for oncolytic therapy. by expanding the targeting repertoire through exchange of peptide ligands, coronaviruses can probably be redirected towards various tumor epitopes. as murine coronaviruses display great species specificity in their infection, ablation of the natural tropism will probably not be required. recombinant MHV viruses were generated by targeted recombination [35] in the recombinant viruses, the accessory genes 2a and 2b/HE, the S gene, the nonessential genes 4ab and 5a, and the genes encoding the virion proteins E, M, and N. recombinant MHV viruses were generated by targeted recombination. none of such genetically modified, tropism modified oncolytic viruses have entered phase I clinical trial. this makes it virtually impossible to compare the viruses reviewed here. many hurdles have yet to be overcome before new oncolytic viruses will reach the clinic. hepatic tropism is a major cause of loss of infectious virus in vivo. the use of nonhuman viruses for oncolytic therapy gains interest, as such viruses are usually nonpathogenic for humans. however, when adapting to the new host, these viruses might also pose a risk, as was reviewed in [106]. the sacrifice of all the energy and creativity needed for its realization."}
