{"summary": "sepsis puts the body into an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive state. innate immune responses in sepsis patients had defects such as macrophage malfunction and increased apoptosis in lymphoid tissues. the oxidized phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (OXPAPC) is an active compound of minimally oxidized low-density lipoprotein. it decreases LPS-induced expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin and other adhesion molecules. GM-CSF and IL-4 were purchased from HyClone (USA) GM-CSF and IL-4 were from Peprotech (USA) FITC-labeled CD86 antibody, HLA-DR antibody and PE labeled CD1a antibody were from Biolegend (USA) different reagents were added to different study groups. the control group: GM-CSF and IL-4; 3) sepsis OXPAPC 10 group: GM-CSF and IL-4 plus OXPAPC (10 g/ml); 4) sepsis OXPAPC 25 group: GM-CSF, IL-4 and OXPAPC (10 g/ml); 5) sepsis OXPAPC 40 group: GM-CSF pulmonary infection in 14 cases, diffuse peritonitis in 11 cases, intracranial infection in 4 cases, blood infection in 4 cases and other disease in 9 cases. all patients had no history of autoimmune diseases, no malignancies, no use of immunosuppressive drugs. IL-4 (500 U/ml) was added into mononuclear cells. half culture medium was changed and half amount of cytokines was added. different reagents were added to different study groups. sepsis patients with OXPAPC treatment gained more cell surface projections in an OXPAPC concentration-dependent manner. the expression of CD1a was similar in the control group and sepsis patent groups. IL-12p70 secretion was significantly reduced in the culture medium of DCs from sepsis patients without OXPAPC treatment. the secretion level did not reach the levels observed in controls even with 40 g/ml of OXPAPC. IL-12p70 levels in the cell culture medium. data are expressed as mean standard deviation. IL-12p70 levels in the cell culture medium. treatment with 40 g/ml of OXPAPC almost normalized HLA-DR expression. compared to controls (154.56 11.56) treatment increased CD86 levels in a concentration-dependent manner. IL-12p70 levels in the cell culture medium were expressed as mean standard deviation. sepsis patients treated mononuclear cells with dendritic shape. a previous study compared 23 severe sepsis patients and 26 uneventful postoperative patients. the level of HLA-DR increased by 70% in 10 days while patients were recovering. non-survivors were characterized by a second decrease in monocytic HLA-DR expression. cytokines like IL-10 or TGF- in sepsis affect the ability of DCs to secrete IL-12. reduced production of IL-12 by DCs and increased IL-10 production would induce T helper cell transformation to a Th2 type, which weakens immune response."}
