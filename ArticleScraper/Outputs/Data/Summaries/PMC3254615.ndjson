{"summary": "nearly 75% of emerging infectious diseases in humans are of zoonotic origin, the majority of which originate in wildlife. trade in live animals and animal products has led to the emergence of several zoonotic pathogens, of which RNA viruses are the most common. a single shipment of infected animals can result in serious impact on public health. the USDA regulates certain exotic ruminant species, some birds, some fish, a few species of tortoise, hedgehogs, tenrecs, and brushtail possums. study estimated that 273 tons of bushmeat was imported every year on air France carriers alone. under the authority of the public health service act, CDC is responsible for preventing the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases. CDC recognizes the potential public health risk posed by illegal trade in wildlife and regulations are in place that prohibit the importation of bushmeat products. Biological samples were processed for aliquoting and storage at the CDC Quarantine Laboratory at JFK Airport. any remaining tissues were incinerated according to standard protocols. items were sampled while wearing full personal protective equipment. samples were genetically identified by phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA genes. cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and II (COX1/2) and/or cytochrome b (CytB) [11]\u2013[15]. nucleic acids were extracted from 10\u201330 mg of tissue using mechanical disruption (Qiagen tissue lyser II or Next Advance Inc Bullet Blender) order was evaluated using 1,000 nonparametric bootstrap support. p-distances were calculated using uncorrected p-distances in PAUP* and BLAST. all specimens were stored at USFWS forensic laboratories at 20\u00b0C. 0.5 cm2 samples were preserved in 1 mL Nuclisens lysis buffer. samples were genetically identified by phylogenetic analysis of mtDNA genes, including cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and II. thrax [17], herpesviruses [18], filoviruses [20], coronaviruses [21], flaviviruses [22], orthopoxviruses [23] and simian retroviruses (SIV, STLV, SFV, SFV) all PCR-amplified bands approximately the expected size were confirmed by sequencing. 35 rodents comprised of 14 cane rats (Thryonomys sp.) confirmed by gross or phylogenetic analysis. 18 suspected cane rats (based on gross identification) and 3 rats (unknown species) confirmed by gross identification. the USFWS specimens from 2006 included an additional 20 NHP tissues from 16 individual animals. ies2 Common name Sample number1 Tissue LCV CMV SFV Origin of package Destination of package Chlorocebus sabaeus green monkey CII-040 Bone marrow + Guinea Staten Island, NY Chlorocebus sabaeus green monkey CII-044 Trachea + Guinea Staten Island, NY Cercopithecus nictitans greater white-nosed monkey BM002 Muscle + Nigeria Dallas, TX Papio BLAST analysis of the 425-bp pol sequences from BM013 and BM008 showed maximum nucleotide identity to SFVs from P. t. ellioti and mangabey (Cercocebus atys and Cercocebus agilis) the chimpanzee SFV was highly related to SFV from P. t. ellioti. new SFV sequences identified in this study are boxed. Clades of sequences from Mandrillus, Cercopithicus, Chlorocebus, Macaca, Pongo, Gorilla, and Pan paniscus are collapsed for presentation. phylogenetic analysis of the larger pol sequence inferred a significant relationship to SFV from Guinea baboons (P. papio) our inability to detect larger pol sequences in other SFV-positive baboon and AGM samples may be due to highly degraded nucleic acids in those specimens. geneBank Accession numbers New SFV, herpesvirus, and mtDNA sequences identified in the current study have been deposited at GenBank with following accession numbers: JF810903\u2013JF810914 and JF828317\u2013JF828329. RNA quality was low with a predominance of degraded, low molecular weight fragments in the samples. RNA quality was low with a predominance of degraded, low molecular weight fragments in the samples. samples from approximately 44 animals were included in this study. all NHP samples were negative for SIV and STLV sequences. all rodent samples were negative for leptospira, anthrax, herpesviruses, filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, flaviviruses, and orthopoxviruses. phylogenetic analysis of the 425-bp pol sequences from BM013 and BM008 showed maximum nucleotide identity to SFVs from P. t. ellioti and mangabey (Cercocebus atys and Cercocebus agilis) only samples testing positive are listed. the two LTR sequences from mangabeys (BM008 and BM010) were 94% identical to each other due to an 8-bp deletion in the LTR of BM008 and 8 nucleotide substitutions. in the USFWS samples SFV pol sequences were present in 3/10 baboons, and in 1/6 AGMs. inferred phylogenetic relationships of SFV pol sequences detected in USFWS bushmeat samples. new SFV sequences identified in this study are underlined. all simian DNA samples from USFWS were also screened for larger SFV pol sequences. 88.2\u201395.5% sequence identity for the entire LCV group was calculated to be 81.0\u2013100% ( = 87.5) phylogenetic analysis confirmed the presence and phylogenetic relatedness of CMV and LCV in these NHP specimens. the restricted number of samples included in this study were tested for a limited range of pathogens only. we identified four SFV strains and two different herpesviruses in smuggled NHP bushmeat. these results are consistent with the origin of the shipments from west africa. the finding of SFV DNA in the bushmeat samples highlights a potential public health risk of exposure to these tissues along the hunting, transportation, and consumption continuum. however, the limited number of cases, short follow-up duration, and selection biases in the enrolling of healthy workers or hunters limit the identification of potential disease associations. four groups of HTLV viruses found in humans are believed to have originated from corresponding STLV strains in NHP species. HTLV-1, closely related to STLV-1 group viruses, infects 15 to 20 million people worldwide and is spread from person to person via bodily fluids. most herpesviruses are host-specific, yet particular strains are capable of causing severe disease in the non-host. nearly 90% of adults in the united states have antibodies indicating exposure at some point to EBV. baboon LCV can infect human B cells in immunocompromised persons or in persons co-infected with EBV and replicate in EBV-immortalized B cells with the theoretical potential for viral recombination. zoonotic disease risk assessment is not included in this study. a further understanding of pathogen movements through the trade will only be recognized through surveillance efforts and pathogen identification and discovery techniques."}
