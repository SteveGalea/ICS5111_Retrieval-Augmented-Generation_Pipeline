{"summary": "RV is the sole member of the Rubivirus genus of the Togaviridae. it has a positive-sense single stranded RNA genome that is 9762 nucleotides (nt) in length. the 5' proximal ORF encodes the p200 polyprotein precursor for the nonstructural proteins (NSPs) p150 and p90 [1,2] two well-studied mitogenic pathways are the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway and the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. Activated Akt promotes cell survival by phosphorylating and inhibiting pro-apoptotic proteins. a number of transcription factors including c-myc, c-jun, and Elk-1 regulate cell cycle progression responses. PI3K-Akt and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling cascades during virus infection play an important role in cellular growth and survival. apoptosis was measured in RV-infected cells by caspase activity and cell viability assays. phosphorylated Akt and ERK2 (but not ERK1) were detected in the mock-infected cells at 96 hours p.i. but not before. total levels of Akt and ERK 1/2 were detectable at all time points. treatment of RV-infected cells with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 completely inhibited activation of Akt and ERK1/2 respectively. phosphorylation of Thr421/Ser42 was observed at all time points. increases in band intensity could be seen at 12, 24, 60, 84 and 96 hours p.i. phosphorylation of c-myc decreased between 12 and 96 hours p.i. a decrease in intensity of formazan was used to monitor changes in cellular metabolism. cell viability during RV infection did not appear to be disrupted. ly294002 treatment of RK13 cells reduced cell viability by 20%. inhibition of PI3K results in an increase in the speed and magnitude of RV-induced apoptosis. effects of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 on the development of RV-induced apoptosis were examined 12\u201396 hours p.i.. peak caspase activity occurs around 72 hours p.i. data represent mean S.E. from three experiments, *P 0.05. C \u2013 Total DNA was extracted from detached and monolayer cells at 72 hours p.i. and apoptotic DNA fragments were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel. RV-induced CPE is characterized in the earlier stages by clumps of apoptotic cells, surrounded by healthy cells. in the later stages the cell sheet is completely destroyed and the majority of cells have become apoptotic floaters. in the presence of LY294002, RV-infected cells are almost all dead by 72 hours p.i. the effects of PI3K and MEK1/2 inhibition on RV replication and growth are shown in Fig. 3D. the capsid gene is the first gene to be transcribed from the second ORF encoding the structural proteins. both LY294002 and U0126 affected virus growth. titers reached 108 TCID50/ml by 96 hours p.i. ly294002 reduced virus growth to similar extent. but unlike with U0126, the virus titer recovered slightly. cell lysates from RV and mock infected RK13 cells were collected 12\u201396 hours post-infection (p.i.), separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed for total and phosphorylated Akt and ERK1/2. total levels of Akt and ERK1/2 were detectable at all time points. serum-starved RK13 cells were mock infected or infected with RV at an m.o.i. of 4 PFU/cell. at indicated time points cell lysates were collected and proteins (30 g/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE. Blots were also probed with anti-tubulin antibody to demonstrate equal loading. phosphorylation of c-myc, a transcription factor activated by ERK1/2 phosphorylation, decreased between 12 and 96 hours p.i. the effects of LY294002 and U0126 treatment on cell viability in RV-infected cells induces apoptosis in RK13 cells. cell viability was reduced to 60% in the presence of both RV and LY294002. combined effect of PI3K inhibition and RV-infection caused a significant reduction in cell viability during RV infection. RV-induced apoptotic signaling has been reported to occur between 12\u201324 hours p.i. peak caspase activity occurs around 72 hours p.i. peak caspase activity occurs earlier at 60 hours p.i. maximum caspase activity increased by 53.9 % (P 0.05) and occurred 12 hours earlier than with RV alone. increased speed and magnitude of RV-induced apoptosis is more strikingly observed in Fig. 3B. increase in speed and magnitude of RV-induced apoptosis is more strikingly observed in Fig. 3B. LY294002-only treatment of LY294002 treated RK13 cells did not induce apoptosis as evidenced by lack of caspase activity (Fig. 3A), DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3C) and measurable floating cells. inhibition of MEK1/2 reduces RV-induced apoptosis. levels of capsid RNA increased over time in RV-infected cells simultaneously treated with LY294002. levels of capsid RNA increased over time, as in RV-infected cells simultaneously treated with LY294002. ly294002 reduced virus growth to a similar extent. RK13 cells were transfected with constitutively active forms Akt and MEK1/2. significant expression of both proteins was seen after 24 hours. over-expression of both activated Akt and MEK enhanced RV-induced caspase activity. lysates were collected and tested for caspase activity using artificial caspase substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA. signaling downstream of PI3K stimulates a survival response in the cell following RV infection. signaling downstream of PI3K stimulates a survival response in the cell following RV infection. RV infection has been observed to slow cell cycle progression in vivo and in vitro. the expression and activity of c-myc and other downstream transcription factors in relation to the cell cycle during RV-infection requires further investigation. however, BAD is not ubiquitously expressed and therefore may not be produced in the rabbit kidney epithelial cells (RK13) used [16] PI3K-Akt signaling has also been shown to reduce coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced apoptosis. however, the replication of CVB3 was also reduced, suggesting that PI3K-Akt survival signals may also serve as a defense mechanism against virus infection. despite this, U0126 impaired RV replication, growth, and induction of apoptosis. HCMV infection in human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HELs) has been shown to stimulate biphasic activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. treatment of infected cells with U0126 reduced viral DNA replication, protein production and virus titer. in vivo studies are difficult, as a reliable animal model does not exist for CRS. however, it may be possible to extrapolate findings from cell culture systems. in vivo studies are difficult, as a reliable animal model does not exist for CRS.
