{"summary": "researchers conducted a focused review of the published literature describing how HIT can be used to support safe, patient-centred, coordinated care to patients who are affected by new and emerging diseases. new and emerging diseases present opportunities for repurposing existing technologies and for stimulating the development of new HIT innovation. the paper describes the development of new technologies and the repurposing and extension of existing ones (such as electronic health records) health and biomedical informatics researchers developed electronic tools and repurposed existing technologies such as electronic health records to effectively support clinicians and biomedical researchers. this included patient-centred approaches to the management of the disease. this included patient-centred approaches to the treatment and management of the disease. the current outbreak, which began in march 2014, is the largest. there have been more cases and deaths from Ebola in the current outbreak than all other outbreaks combined. the disease has also spread from Guinea to Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, the United States of America, Spain and Mali. Vaccines and treatments for Ebola are currently under development, but none have been fully tested for their safety and/or efficacy. people who recover from Ebola develop antibodies that may last at least 10 years. some people who recover from Ebola have developed long-term complications. public interest about emerging diseases often coincides with news-making events such as the SARS, the Avian Flu and Ebola crisis in Africa. the first spike in august 2014 coincides with the WHO declaring Ebola an international public health emergency. the second spike follows news about the first cases of Ebola discovered in the u.s. Archived versions of the WHO web site indicate that a prominent patient-centred focus has only been adopted seven months after the initial outbreak. the current WHO Web site has a clearly demarcated patient-centred section (along with two other sections, centered on providers and partner organizations) it leverages Web-based patient-centred communication tools such as Twitter and Facebook to propagate important health facts about the disease while it emerges. some mobile healthcare application designers have recently begun to focus on tracking and information about the signs and symptoms of Ebola. mobile applications have been developed for both Android and IOS platforms, with the majority being information sharing applications. social media mobile applications have been used to push information about Ebola via Twitter\u00ae, Youtube\u00ae, Facebook\u00ae etc. electronic health records After the initial Ebola case in the united states, public attention became focused on the EHR. the EHR itself was not to blame, but the answer was likely more in the way the EHR collected and presented critical data to the medical team. this led to confusion where the patient\u2019s international travel was recorded and whether the relevant information was effectively communicated to all members of the healthcare team. more than 70% of american hospitals have EHRs, [38] and most contain a degree of decision support. traditional DSS relies on alerts that are in-line with the standard EHR templates and creates pop-ups to alert providers that disrupt the workflow. a pop-up alert for patients can be displayed to the appropriate personnel. if patients traveled to one of four specific countries, the alert fires. if the list of affected countries grows very large, the electronic screening would likely be much less accurate. decision support can be one tool to help busy providers remember to screen for rare events. new technologies such as the WWW, social media, EHRs and DSS can be used to support patient centric care. a key challenge in providing patient centered coordinated care delivery is coordinating care across providers and settings using a patient-centred perspective. there is a lack of integration between EHRs, EMRs and public health information systems which slow public health response to disease outbreaks. there is a disconnect: we are able to adequately manage disease outbreaks in hospital, but we are not fully able to conduct ongoing disease surveillance using public health systems. the lack of interoperability between systems may lead to missing data that might be useful in outbreak detection. to design HIT to support monitoring and management of disease outbreaks will require a rethinking in HIT. more specifically, we need to better incorporate context in HIT design (i.e. physician office, hospital etc.) policy and organizational issues are of particular concern during the early days and weeks of an outbreak especially when health professionals are only beginning to learn about the signs and symptoms of a new disease. existing information, policies, and procedures may not fully account for all information about the emerging disease. technologies that enact them may not be consistent with emerging international and national knowledge about the disease. healthcare organizations review emerging information from country and state public health organizations, develop and modify existing policies and procedures, identify methods of educating health professionals about the emerging disease. such activities require that health informatics and HIT departments modify existing electronic tools (e.g. electronic screening, emergency room triage tools, clinical documentation, DSS, and laboratory and pharmacy information systems) the culture of blame and resistance to sharing has been identified as barriers to e-reporting at the organization level. current e-reporting systems were not built on the basis of a consensus on the conceptual framework. features that analyze medical errors collectively and facilitate learning have not been explored in current systems. many of the open source EHRs lack the essential characteristics of a HIT that can fully support management of new/emerging diseases. laptops, mobile phones and cameras are a concern for healthcare professionals. the belief is that HIT may become contaminated and current approaches to decontaminating the technology may damage the HIT itself. researchers must develop HIT that supports surveillance, screen for, diagnosis and management of emerging/new disease. they need to develop methods to rapidly create new technologies and/or optimize existing ones to reflect the changing information and knowledge we have about a new and emerging disease."}
