{"summary": "MERS is an illness caused by a coronavirus in which infected persons develop severe acute respiratory illness. a person can be infected through close contacts. a person can be infected through close contacts. the first confirmed case of MERS occurred in the Philippines in 2012. cases have since been reported from countries in the Arabian Peninsula, Europe, North Africa, South-East Asia and the united states of America. a standard close contact questionnaire was headed by the Philippine Field Epidemiology Training Program investigation team and subnational surveillance officers trained in filling out the form. contacts were monitored daily for appearance of illness for 14 days starting from the date of last known exposure to the confirmed case. a standard symptom log sheet was used to record these details. all contacts for each relevant category were gathered from quarantine officers, HCW and family members of the cases. contacts were then monitored daily for appearance of illness for 14 days starting from the date of last known exposure to the confirmed case. a standard symptom log sheet was used to record these details. the patient was discharged as she had remained afebrile for more than 48 hours. she had two negative sputum and NPS/OPS tests for MERS-CoV. she recovered completely at home after her discharge with no known reappearance of fever. the index case was a 31-year-old female who worked as a HCW in Saudi Arabia. on 26 January 2015, she had rash, fever and cough and was diagnosed with hypersensitivity reaction. on 8 February, she still had persistent fever and cough. the patient was discharged as she had remained afebrile for more than 48 hours. she had two negative sputum and NPS/OPS tests for MERS-CoV. there were 449 close contacts identified: Category E (n = 359), Category C (n = 82) and Category A (n = 8). a history of travel to MERS-affected countries and the appearance of fever and respiratory symptoms are critical clues to guide health providers to suspect MERS. strong suspicion of MERS from the physician at Health Facility A led to an early diagnosis and perhaps averted additional cases. more than half of reported secondary cases of MERS were HCW,2,6,7 this group is strongly recommended for close monitoring and immediate testing. there had been no documented cases infected with MERS on board aircraft."}
