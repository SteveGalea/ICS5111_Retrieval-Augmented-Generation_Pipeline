{"summary": "feline coronavirus (FCoV) is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus of the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae, genus Alphacoronavirus, species alphacoronavirus 1. most infections are either asymptomatic or result in a mild, self-limiting gastrointestinal disease. in these cases, the causative agent is the feline enteric coronavirus (FECo hypothesis known as the \u201cinternal mutation theory\u201d widely accepted. it states that FIP occurs when a cat is exposed to variants of FCoV that have mutated within the host and are able to disseminate from the gut. however, any stable genetic differences between FECoV and FIPV that can account for their differing pathogenicities remain to be identified. 190 samples were collected at necropsies from 10 deceased or euthanised unrelated cats with suspected FIP. faecal samples from five cats without clinical signs of FIP were also collected. all samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u201380 \u00b0C. the total RNA was extracted from the supernatants of organs and faecal suspensions. the RNA was eluted in 30 L of UltraPure DEPC-treated water. a positive RNA control was prepared from the abdominal effusion of a cat with FIP. the primer annealing temperature was 50\u00b0C. the PCR products were visualised by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels stained with SYBR Green I nucleic acid gel stain. the partial M gene (575 bp) was then amplified using 0.5 M of both reverse and forward primers. the M gene partial sequences and the putative amino acid sequences from each sample were aligned with homologous sequences from both FCoVs pathotypes retrieved from GenBank. a phylogenetic tree for the nucleotide sequences was generated with the neighbour-joining distance algorithm. a total of 190 samples were collected at necropsies from 10 deceased or euthanised unrelated cats with suspected FIP. faecal samples from five cats without clinical signs of FIP were also collected. none of these cats had cats developed FIP as of the time of writing this study. RT-PCR for the Detection of the FCoV mRNA of the Membrane (M) Gene All samples were screened for the presence of FCoV M gene mRNA using primers previously described [12], with modifications (2RNAmA TAATRMCATARACGADCCAGCT, nt 26440\u201326461, and 2RNAmS GTGCTAGVTTTTTTGGACAMC, nt 60\u201383, positions regarding strain FIPV 79\u20131179) DNA was synthesised using Random Primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) the partial M gene (575 bp) was amplified using 0.5 M of both reverse (26925\u201326944 nt positions regarding strain FCoV UU47) and forward primers (26968\u201326292 nt positions regarding strain FCoV UU phylogenetic tree was constructed using a canine coronavirus sequence as an outgroup. numbers on the nodes indicate bootstrap support from 1,000 replications. only bootstrap values >50 are shown. multiple samples from each cat were determined to be positive for the FCoV M gene. of these, the most frequently positive samples were contents of the large intestine (5/11), spleen (4/10), and lungs (4/10) cat % sequence identitya SD Number of sequences GenBank accession number Cat 5 99.9 0.001 n = 6 JQ627055-60 Cat 6 98.0 0.028 n = 2 JQ627061-66 Cat 8 100.0 0.000 n = 7 JQ627069-75 Cat 11 99.9 0.001 n = 7 JQ627078-84 Cat 12 99.9 0.001 n = 3 JQ627085-87. 80% (4/5) of FECoV and 91.4% (32/35) of FIPV.
