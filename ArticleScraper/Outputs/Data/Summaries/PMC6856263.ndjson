{"summary": "human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are enveloped viruses within the family Coronaviridae with positive-sense, single-stranded genomes of up to 32 kb. the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome encodes the large replicases 1a and 1b encoding nonstructural proteins. the 3\u2032 one-third encodes the structural proteins (1). cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with random hexamers. cDNA was synthesized with Klenow polymerase (5 U; New England BioLabs) libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

NL63 sequence grouped with global NL63 genotype B sequences. extensive variability, including insertions, deletions, and nonsynonymous substitutions, was observed. the genome sequences generated here were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MN026164, MN026165, and MN026166."}
