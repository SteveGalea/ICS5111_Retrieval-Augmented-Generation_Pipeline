{"summary": "IFITMs inhibit the infection of enveloped RNA viruses from 9 viral families. IFITMs effectively inhibit a number of medically important human pathogenic viruses. IAV (Brass et al., 2009; Bailey et al., 2012), dengue virus (DENV) and several DNA viruses (Li et al., 2018) in vivo studies in IFITM3 knockout mice demonstrate the critical role of IFITM3 in restricting infection and reducing disease severity of infection by IAV. IFITM3 in mice protects lung epithelia cells from IAV infection, but also restricts IAV infection of lung dendritic cells. IFITM1 more efficiently restricts viruses that enter the cytoplasm via direct fusion with plasma membrane or via Rab-5-positive early endosomes. sensitivity of IAVs to IFITM3 appears to depend on pH value at which the IAV hemagglutinin triggers membrane fusion. the mechanism of IFITM inhibition of viral fusion and cell entry is not yet resolved. one study reported that IFITM inhibited Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus envelope and IAV hemagglutinin fusion of viral envelope to cellular membranes prior to coalescence of lipid-bilayers. another study using a direct virus-cell fusion assay in viable cells to investigate IAV entry found that overexpression of IFITM3 protein in late endosomes did not alter zinc metallopeptidase STE24 (ZMPSTE24), a transmembrane metalloprotease localized in the inner nuclear membrane and cytoplasmic organelles, was identified as a downstream partner of IFITM3 to restrict the entry of enveloped RNA and DNA viruses. one study found that IFITM proteins interact with HIV envelope protein in viral producer cells to disrupt envelope protein processing and virion incorporation. the expression of IFITM1 and RIPK3 to escape from IFN- and TNF-mediated antiproliferation and necroptosis. it was demonstrated in IFITM3 knockout mice that IFITM3 limited murine CMV pathogenesis without directly preventing virus replication. instead, IFITM3 contributed to the antiviral cellular immunity by abrogating inflammatory cytokine-driven lymphopenia. human IFITM locus, approximately 18kb long, is located on chromosome 11. it comprises five genes: IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, IFITM5, and IFITM10. as an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG), IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3 genes each has an interferon stimulated response element. two red vertical lines across transcription factor binding sites represent the Influenza associated SNPs of rs12252 and rs34481144. all IFITM genes contain two coding exons interspersed by one intron. most vertebrate animals have two or more IFITM genes. the three possible membrane topologies of IFITM3 (A) and six possible membrane topological forms of IFITM1 (B) are presented. the two transmembrane (or intramembrane) regions were highlighted in yellow. five structural domains, including the N-terminal domain (NTD), amphipathic helix domain (AHD), intracellular loop (CIL), transmembrane domain (TMD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) are illustrated. in IFITM3, three hydrophilic residues (S61, N64, and T65) in amphipathic helix are labeled in violet. terminal 21-aa region significantly impaired its ability to inhibit the infection by IAV, VSV, and DENV. the deletion apparently did not affect its ability to enhance HCoV-OC43pp infection. 20-IFITM2 demonstrated a more potent suppression on HIV-1 infection than that by full-length wild-type IFITM2. replacement of IFITM3 tyrosine (Y) 20 with either alanine (A) or aspartic acid (D) to mimic unphosphorylated or phosphorylated IFITM3 converted the antiviral protein to enhance the entry of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. these studies suggest that the NTD plays important roles in IFITM2/3 subcellular localization and antiviral activity. the KR/AA mutant IFITM1 executed increased activity to inhibit the infection by jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) and 10A1 amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV) deletion of the C-terminal 3, 6, or 9 amino acids did not apparently affect the activity of IFITM1 to inhibit SARS-CoV entry. further deletion of the C-terminal 12, 15, or 18 amino acids significantly attenuated or even abolished the ability of IFITM1 ical CD225 domain (residues 58\u201380) is a hydrophobic region and possesses an amphipathic alpha helix spanning residues 59\u201368. either deletion of this alpha helices or mutations altering amphipathicity largely impaired or even abolished IFITM antiviral activity. ubiquitination of IFITM proteins possess four conserved lysine residues. this can be ubiquitinated by ubiquitin ligase such as NEDD4. previous studies showed each lysine residue can be modified with mono- and poly-ubiquitination. sicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and IAV infection increased IFITM3-K88me1 levels by promoting the interaction between IFITM3 and SET7 and disassociation from LSD1 to attenuate IFITM3 antiviral activity. IFN- reduced IFITM3-K88me1 levels and increased its antiviral activity. a recent study argues that the 20-IFITM2 and IFITM3 is the effective restriction factor of HIV-1 with CXCR4-tropism. the 20YXX23 motif of IFITM3 is an endocytic signal essential for endocytosis and localization of IFITM3 to endocytic vesicles/lysosomes. IFITM3 are phosphorylated by the protein-tyrosine kinase Fyn on tyrosine 20 (Y20), which results in its plasma membrane accumulation and decreased antiviral activity against influenza viruses. this result is consistent with the mutagenesis studies of 20YXX23 motif, where Y20 is part of an endocytosis signal that can be blocked by phosphorylation. deletion of the C-terminal 3, 6, or 9 amino acids did not affect the activity of IFITM1 to inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV. however, further deletion of the C-terminal 12, 15, or 18-aa converted IFITM1 to a potent enhancer of MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 entry. 81SVKS84 motif residing in CIL domain is essential for IFITM3 to inhibit IAV and DENV infection. replacement of this motif with four residues of alanine promoted cellular entry driven by Lloviu virus (LLOV) glycoprotein. previous studies demonstrated that each lysine residue can be modified with mono- and poly-ubiquitination through Lys-48 and Lys-63 linkages. the mutant IFITM3 demonstrated endolysosomal distribution and execute hyperactivity to restrict IAV infection than wild type. IFITM3 bearing F75A and F78A mutations (IFITM3/2FA) showed reduced ability to inhibit the entry of HCoV-NL63, but lost ability to inhibit or enhance the entry of all other tested viruses. antiviral activity of many naturally existing human IFITM variants has been tested in cell cultures. many of the SNPs results in undetectable levels of IFITM3 in the transfected cells. some SNPs did not apparently alter the amount of IFITM proteins but impaired the antiviral activity against IAV. it will be interesting to test all the IFITM variants against a group of viruses. IFITMs play a pivotal role in limiting the infection by multiple viruses. a dozen of SNP in IFITM3 have been reported. some of which may modulate IFITM expression, affect RNA splicing, or result in nonsynonymous or synonymous variants. the homozygous CC genotype and heterozygous TC genotype have significantly higher frequency in East Asia than that in Europe. rs34481144 located at the IFITM3 promoter is associated with severe influenza in three human cohorts. a higher allelic frequency of rs12252-C exists in hospitalized influenza patients than healthy control. they observed a remarkably higher allelic frequency of the homologous CC genotype in hospitalized influenza patients compared to the normal European population (5.7% vs. 0.3%). study of rs12252 Allele Frequency Genotype Frequency (%) Allelic P-value (patients vs. Control) population C T CC TC TT Influenza study by Everitt et al. 0.069 0.931 1.7 10.3 88.0 0.11 Hospitalized patients with primary viral pneumonia (N = 60) 0.058 0.942 0.0 11.7 88.3 0.171 Influenza study by European 1000 Genomes (N = 503) 0.041 0.959 0 8.2 91.8 0.80 Randolph et al.
