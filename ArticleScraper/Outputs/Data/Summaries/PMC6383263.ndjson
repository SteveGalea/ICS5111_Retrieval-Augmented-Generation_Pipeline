{"summary": "variable polyadenylation at the 3' end have been reported in RNA viruses. it is interesting to identify the characteristic and potential role of 3' polyadenylation of wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV), which caused severe disease on wheat in East Asia region. YMV RNA1 or RNA2' polyadenylation have negative effect on minus-strand synthesis of WYMV RNA in vitro."}
