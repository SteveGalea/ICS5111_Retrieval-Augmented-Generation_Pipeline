{"summary": "rats were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: group 1 (n = 7), daily administration of ferumoxytol (Feraheme, AMAG Pharmaceuticals) for 4 wk (28 to 31 d); group 2 (n = 7), daily administration of ferumoxytol for 4 wk followed by a 7-d washout period (n = 6). rats were not given any USPIO treatment during the 7-d washout period. rats were kept on a 12:12-h light:dark cycle, with an average ambient room temperature of 22 \u00b0C and 30% to 70% relative humidity. all animal use was approved by the weill Cornell medical college IACUC. rats were anesthetized in an isoflurane induction chamber and maintained under isoflurane anesthesia by nosecone. each rat's eyes were lubricated with ophthalmic ointment. the ventral neck and intrascapular regions were clipped and prepared for aseptic surgery. the first dose of USPIO was given at this time, followed by flushing with 0.2 mL saline and 0.2 mL sterile catheter lock solution. the skin incisions were closed by using 3-0 nylon suture. rats were housed individually postoperatively for the duration of the study. a voxel-wise nonlinear fit of the multiecho complex data was performed to produce a field map, which was unwrapped by using a graph-cut algorithm. 20,49 a binary mask was generated for QSM reconstruction by digitally stripping the skull from the rat's head on the magnitude image. this step usually improves the quality of the QSM map by restricting the range of susceptibility values that are reconstructed. the brain regions analyzed were the corpus callosum, striatum, thalamus, hypothalamus, cortex, and ventricles. the mean ROI values, referenced to the hypothalamus, were converted to contrast agent concentration by division. serum biochemistry, CBC, and serum iron levels were assessed. a complete gross necropsy was performed without fixative perfusion. the brain, liver, and spleen were fixed in 10% buffered formalin. dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining12,24 was done on select brain sections to confirm true degenerative changes. choroid plexus hemosiderosis and midbrain vacuolation between ferumoxytol and Molday ION study groups were evaluated by using 2 analyses. each group, 8 mg Fe/kg of USPIO (either ferumoxytol or Molday ION) was administered daily through a jugular catheter. rats received baseline MRI scans prior to USPIO dosing. rats underwent MRI at their respective endpoints. the animal care and use program at weill Cornell medical college is AAALAC-accredited. rats were anesthetized in an isoflurane induction chamber and maintained under isoflurane anesthesia by nosecone. rat's eyes were lubricated with ophthalmic ointment. the ventral neck and intrascapular regions were clipped and prepared for aseptic surgery. a 1.5- to 2.0-cm incision was made in the ventrolateral aspect of the neck, parallel and 0.5 cm lateral to the midline. the left external jugular vein was gently dissected free of surrounding fascia. male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were housed individually in ventilated microisolation cages. rats had unrestricted access to irradiated rodent laboratory chow. rats maintained on a 12:12-h light:dark cycle, with an average room temperature of 22 \u00b0C. all animal use was approved by the Weill Cornell Medical College IACUC. rats were anesthetized in an isoflurane induction chamber and maintained under isoflurane anesthesia by nosecone. each rat's eyes were lubricated with ophthalmic ointment. the catheter was tunneled subcutaneously to the right external jugular vein. the first dose of USPIO was given at this time, followed by flushing with 0.2 mL saline and 0.2 mL sterile catheter lock solution. s from the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine images were combined into a complex MATLAB data structure. Magnitude images were generated by taking the sum of squares of the absolute of the complex data structure. voxel-wise nonlinear fit of the multiecho complex data was performed to produce a field map. brain regions analyzed were the corpus callosum (CC), third ventricle (3V), left ventricle (LV), striatum (Str), thalamus (Th), neocortex (CTX) and hypothalamus (H). CBC and serum chemistry, including serum iron levels, were performed. serum iron levels were measured by using a colorimetric assay. whole blood was collected by cardiocentesis into a serum separator and EDTA blood collection tubes. serum biochemistry, CBC, and serum iron levels were assessed. activated caspase 3 (Cleaved caspase 3 [Asp175] Antibody, catalog no. 9661, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling staining12,24 were done on select brain sections to confirm true degenerative changes. each column shows the magnitude, R2*, and QSM images for the central slice of the MRI image at baseline and after 4 wk of daily USPIO injections without and with 1 wk of washout. the largest changes in USPIO concentration after 4 wk of USPIO administration occurred in the ventricles. ferumoxytol or (B) Molday ION are calculated from the difference between the QSM values at baseline and endpoint. the USPIO concentration at baseline is assumed to be 0. Necropsy and histopathology. vacuolation was noted on sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. the positive TUNEL staining in these sections suggests that vacuolation is the result of degenerative changes. all rats exhibited significant increases in serum iron from baseline to endpoint. postdosing serum iron levels were lower in the Molday ION group with washout than without washout (P = 0.01). ALT showed an increase from 129.6 without washout to 741.3 after washout. rats whose catheters became nonpatent or dislodged were removed from the study and euthanized. 3 animals (10% of study population) had mild facial edema postoperatively. each image was postprocessed from all echoes of gradient-echo acquisition. ferumoxytol and Molday ION were localized to the ventricles. iron concentrations are calculated from the difference between the QSM values at baseline and endpoint. hemosiderin, identified by Prussian blue staining, was present in macrophages in the splenic white and red pulp and in hepatic Kupffer cells. the unexpected pathologic tissue change of midbrain parenchyma vacuolation was ranked according to severity by using a scale of 0 (no change) to 4 (severe vacuolation), yielding a score of 2 for all animals that received 4 wk of caspase-negative staining suggests that cells are undergoing apoptosis. all rats depicted in the photomicrographs received Molday ION. hematology showed elevated WBC counts in some rats and a significant (P = 0.036) increase in the WBC counts of the ferumoxytol groups when compared with the Molday ION groups. no significant differences emerged when ferumoxytol was compared with Molday ION. study confirms liver and spleen are major sites for deposition of USPIO. reports suggest that they may be a route of iron entry into the plexus. free iron is released from USPIO inside macrophage vesicles for storage. ferumoxytol has a strongly negative surface coating to minimize binding to serum components, for maximum accumulation in the liver. the reported half-life for ferumoxytol in rats is 67 min,65. the shorter half-life of ferumoxytol likely allows for more rapid iron clearance once dosing is discontinued. histopathology after chronic dosing with and without washout revealed iron accumulation only in the choroid plexus. this finding is consistent with the fact that neurons generally lack ferritin, the iron-storage protein. no pathologic changes were seen on hepatic histopathology. elevation in liver enzymes may be indicative of early hepatic pathology. weight may not be accurate way to assess iron accumulation in the spleen. the first involved a 7-y-old boy with diamond\u2013Blackfan anemia who was transfusion-dependent by the age of 4. similar results were obtained from a 16-y-old woman who exhibited the additional symptoms of a headache, dizziness, and numbness in the arms."}
