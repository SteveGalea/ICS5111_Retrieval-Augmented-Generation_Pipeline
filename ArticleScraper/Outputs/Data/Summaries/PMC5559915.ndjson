{"summary": "HIV-1 predominantly targets cells associated with the adaptive immune response, in particular CD4+ T cells. at this stage of infection, the failing immune system allows for reemergence of preexisting, latent pathogens that further burden immune responses. in rhesus macaques, rapid upregulation of inflammasome was shown to be responsible for the dysregulation of innate and acquired immune responses. when finally activated, CD8+ T cells dramatically decrease HIV-1 viremia. at this stage of infection, the virus has already established a reservoir for persistent, low-level replication in mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue. -defensins, human defensins (HD) 5 and 6 are produced by paneth cells (PCs) in the crypts of the small intestine. HD5 is also synthesized by epithelial cells of the genitourinary tract. both - and -defensins (HBDs) can also be expressed in some monocytes, macrophages, and DCs. defensins serve as strong microbicidal agents, but also regulate certain facets of the adaptive immune system. some are downregulators of the immune response such as RTD1. this brief review will focus on the role of defensins in HIV-1 pathogenesis. monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells Monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells Neutrophils Tissuea Pancreas Trachea, lung Tonsil, skin Lung, kidney, uterus, testis, gastric antrum Epididymis amRNA expression was identified in tissues but cellular source was not determined. -defensins affect a wide range of responses to infections with pathogenic microbes. the anti-HIV activity of HNP1\u20133 is likely more important in regions with low concentrations of serum proteins, such as at mucosal surfaces. the ability of HNP1\u20133 to limit viral entry may be attributable to the higher binding affinities of HNP1\u20133 for serum proteins compared to that of HNP4. an upregulation of HD5 in the colorectal mucosa has been observed in patients with HIV-1, possibly in response to intestinal inflammation. HD5 has been shown to have direct inhibitory effects on HIV-1 entry into purified peripheral blood CD4+ T lymphocytes by binding with viral gp120 and the CD4 receptor. -defensins induce inflammation by upregulating proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression and increase intestinal permeability in the GI tract. in humans, the upregulation of intestinal IFN and TNF in SIV-infected macaques promotes apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells. microbes that inhabit the gut can cross the epithelium and circulate in the systemic immune system (microbial translocation) the continual immune activation eventually exhausts resources to replenish depleted T cell populations and promotes HIV disease progression. there is a lack of information on the potential immunological impacts of these peptides. inhibition of HIV-1 infection was shown to be mediated by blocking viral entry into cells and interfering with critical steps of viral replication following infection in vitro. HNP1\u20133 prevent HIV-1 entry into cells by interfering with the binding of viral gp120 to the CD4+ T cells. HNP4 remains active against HIV-1 in vitro, but this effect may be biologically negligible in vivo due to the scarce amount of HNP4 produced by neutrophils [47]. HNP1 has been shown to reduce tight junction expression in intestinal epithelial cells and promote HIV traversal. direct inhibitory effects on HIV-1 entry into purified peripheral blood CD4+ T lymphocytes by binding with viral gp120 and the CD4 receptor in serum-free condition in vitro. however, HD5 treatment enhanced HIV infectivity of HeLa-CD4-CCR5 cells in serum-free condition in vitro. further studies are needed to determine if enteric defensins similarly recruit T cells in the gut, thereby inducing the gut-associated HIV reservoir. enteropathy characteristic of HIV-1 59. in humans, upregulation of intestinal IFN and TNF promotes apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells. innate defenses are trying to compensate for the viral-induced epithelial damage. a natural host of SIV, - and -defensin expression levels were elevated compared to those in SIV-infected macaques. lack of disease progression despite high levels of viral replication observed in SMs compared to macaques was in part attributed to an active downregulation of inflammation in SMs [65]. a lack of HNP-mediated control of macrophage-driven inflammation may contribute to the development of the continuous inflammation seen in HIV gastroenteropathy. -defensins on HIV-1 pathogenesis have traditionally centered on the oral environment because the rate of oral HIV-1 transmission is significantly less than that of vaginal or rectal transmission [73, 74], and detectable levels of HBD1, 2 and 3 are routinely found in normal oral epithelium of adults [75] recombinant HBD2 and 3 were shown to directly inactivate HIV-1 [76] the increased gene expression observed in eEC potently inhibited HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells. but in the absence of epithelial cells, stromal fibroblasts markedly enhanced HIV infection of CD4+ T cells. HBD2 has prominent immunomodulatory activities including recruitment of immune cells and induction of antiviral proteins. a depletion of Th17 cells in the ileal mucosa resulted in increased microbial translocation [92]. the loss of Th17 cells could lead to reduced innate defensin levels, exacerbating epithelial damage and translocation of microbes that ultimately induce systemic immune activation. the observed variation in intestinal HBD expression highlights the need for future studies to more thoroughly investigate the mechanisms responsible for regulating antimicrobial synthesis. in women with human papillomavirus (HPV) and HIV-1, HBD2 and proinflammatory cytokine levels were elevated compared to those in HIV-1-positive women without HPV [96]. -defensins exhibit strong anti-HIV-1 activity in oral epithelial cells. association with increased secretion of proinflammatory molecules may promote local inflammation and viral transmission. future research efforts should focus on elucidating mechanisms involved in reduced virion infectivity by -defensins. the effects of -defensins on HIV-1 pathogenesis have traditionally centered on the oral environment. the rate of oral HIV-1 transmission is significantly less than that of vaginal or rectal transmission [73, 74], and detectable levels of HBD1, 2, and 3 are routinely found in normal oral epithelium of adults. endometrial epithelial cells (eEC) significantly overexpressed six genes associated with anti-HIV-1 activity. most abundant were secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor and HBD2. increased gene expression observed in eEC potently inhibited HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells. the loss of Th17 cells in the ileal mucosa resulted in increased microbial translocation. the loss of Th17 cells could lead to reduced innate defensin levels triggering additional alteration of immunological signals. the observed variation in intestinal HBD expression highlights the need for future studies to more thoroughly investigate the mechanisms responsible for regulating antimicrobial synthesis in response to GI disorders and pathogenic infections. a recent study found that greater Escherichia coli inhibitory activity and higher concentrations of HBD1 in cervicovaginal lavage were associated with an increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition. differences in the vaginal microbiome and presence of additional sexually transmitted infections may alter the role of HBDs in vivo. -defensins exhibit strong anti-HIV-1 activity in oral epithelial cells. association with increased secretion of proinflammatory molecules may promote local inflammation and viral transmission. six isoforms, RTD1\u20136, have been isolated from neutrophils and bone marrow of nonhuman primates. compared to - and -defensins, -defensin activities are relatively insensitive to salt, divalent cations, and serum. anti-HIV properties of -defensins should be evaluated to determine if these peptides can reduce inflammation and subsequent epithelial impairment resulting from HIV-1 infection. the synthetic RC1 reduces infectivity by preventing the formation of proviral DNA [119] and blocking HIV-1 Env-mediated cell fusion. RCs can further inhibit viral entry by binding viral gp120 and CD4 receptors. RC2 exhibits the strongest binding affinity compared to other RCs. these studies suggest that RCs reduce HIV-1 infectivity by disrupting viral entry instead of directly inactivating virions. RC101 treatment inhibited pathogenic bacteria in vaginal tissues. lack of toxicity in vivo, compatibility of RC101 with normal vaginal microbiota make RC101 an ideal peptide for anti-HIV-1 microbicide development. future investigations should continue to assess the use of RC101 as a safe, effective microbicide. researchers have synthesized homologous peptides referred to as retrocyclins according to the human pseudogene sequences. -defensins suppresses the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by inhibiting the activation of NF-B and MAPK pathways. peptides can reduce inflammation and subsequent epithelial impairment. rhesus defensins with antiretroviral activity are contrasted to rhesus defensins. sus theta defensin 1 (RTD1) leads to the proposed differential immune response and outcome of the retrovirus infection. CXCR4 and CCR5 are the chemokine coreceptors mediating virus entry on susceptible cells, in particular, lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages (L/M) topical microbicides that prevent HIV-1 transmission could dramatically reduce the number of new infections and deaths resulting from AIDS each year. future investigations should continue to assess the use of RC101 as a safe, effective microbicide.
