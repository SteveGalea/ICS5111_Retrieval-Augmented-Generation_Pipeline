{"summary": "despite the proven success of animal immunizations for over 3 decades, the generation of mAbs for therapeutic purposes is often a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. despite the proven success of animal immunizations, the generation of mAbs for therapeutic purposes is often a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. the development of an optimal immune response to meet either goal is challenging due to the sophisticated mechanisms that control immune responses. the process often involves multiple critical considerations, such as the selection of candidate antigens, choice of adjuvant, antigen/vaccine design, dosage, frequency of application, duration of immunization, injection protocols, etc. serum IgGs were purified using the PhyNexus automated purification system. the purification process achieved maximum IgG recovery and optimal IgG quality. we used naive serum to investigate the number of elution cycles required for full retrieval of bound IgGs. a sample contained 95% monomeric IgGs. the sample contained 95% monomeric IgGs. the PhyNexus automated MEA purification system. samples maintained under non-reducing and reducing conditions were run in parallel on individual pre-cast polyacrylamide gels. markers are in lane 1; flow-through in lane 2; washes in lanes 3\u20135 (DPBS; DPBS + 1 m NaCl; DPBS, respectively) and sequential elutions in lanes 6\u20139. the percentage of DL11 antigen-specific IgGs was calculated for each reconstituted sample. the lower limit of 250 ng/l corresponded to a concentration equivalent to 10% of the total IgGs being human IL-13-specific DL11. each sensorgram represents a different concentration of DL11. g/l 1990 163 No binding NA Detection Limit of Antigen-specific IgG in Serum. the purified IgGs were subjected to HDX coupled with LC/MS. this method compares deuterium exchange levels at different regions of the antigen in the presence and absence of antibody. a concentration of 4 m yielded the highest sequence coverage (98%) hydrogen has a mass of 1.008 Da and deuterium has a mass of 2.014 Da. the replacement of hydrogen in a protein with deuterium induces a shift in mass of 1 Da. peptides exhibiting shifts in mass are associated with antibody epitopes. the limit of detection was determined to be 31 ng/l. this was the minimum IgG concentration required to yield a detectable amount of deuterium protection. each of the serum samples had previously been characterized as a \u201cbinder\u201d by a single point ELISA analysis. 4 54 23% 34\u201338, 66\u201379, 101\u2013110 Serum E No binding observed None Serum F 1.42E+6 1.21E4 85 12% 101\u2013110 Serum G 2.57E+6 1.0E6 20 26% 9\u201316, 34\u201338, 51\u201358, 66\u201379, 83\u201394, 101\u2013110 Serum H 1.04E+6 3.92E5 38 10% 1\u20139, 9\u201316, 83\u201394, 101\u2013110 Serum the IgGs from serum I showed no protection on the same region as that of serum H. the exchange observed there was equivalent to that of the control, containing no IgGs (panel A), suggesting either this serum sample contained no IgGs targeting this region or that the level of IgGs present was below the detection limit. s from serum C.

ELISA method can provide highly precise measurements for determining association and dissociation rate constants (25\u201327) the application of SPR for analyzing complex biological samples has been demonstrated in several reports (28\u201330), although its use for these applications is still rare compared with other immunoassays. samples containing mAbs with known binding epitopes, as well as sera from both naive animals and animals immunized with human IL-13, were tested using these methods. however, we were unable to identify specific epitopes for either the mAb or the antibodies present in the anti-IL-13 sera. the findings provided two important insights: first, we learned that the binding epitopes of the control mAbs were conformational rather than linear. sensitivity of the method was 31 ng of antigen-specific IgG per l of serum. this high sensitivity can facilitate detection of less abundant IgGs exhibiting unique epitopes, maximizing the diversity of antibodies recovered. antibodies that bound to the surface of IL-13 that interacts with the IL-4 receptor (epitope 101\u2013110), two sera (D and G) contained additional antibodies that bound to the surface of IL-13 that interacts with the IL-4 -receptor (epitope 101\u2013110), two sera (D and G) contained additional antibodies that bound to the surface of IL-13 that interacts with the IL-4 -receptor (epitope 101\u201369 (D) and a combination of sensitive methods can be integrated into the antibody generation platform to help identify animal hosts exhibiting high affinity antibody responses and maximal epitope diversities. the proposed workflow process can also be executed at a speed that the biopharmaceutical industry demands to discover novel epitopes for new therapeutic modes of action. anti-BAFF mAb supernatants were produced using spleen cells from mouse P5801-02, followed by cloning and subcloning using limiting dilution. mice of different strains were immunized twice with human BAFF. the mAb-BAFF-bound beads were first incubated with samples of diluted mAbs for 1 h at 20 \u00b0C. they were then incubated with a biotinylated anti-mouse Fc-specific antibody. the anti-BAFF hybridoma subclones were further characterized by their ability to block BAFF-TACI interactions (IC50) reagent plates were placed in positions 7 and 8 on top of a chiller to maintain the temperature at 4\u20136 \u00b0C. a number of PhyTip columns corresponding to the number of samples were transferred into row 1 of an empty 96-well pipette tip box located at position 1. the mouse antibodies were isolated using a method programmed with PhyNexus MEA software (version 1.0.17) the flow rate was maintained at 0.25 ml/min to ensure sufficient contact time between the serum sample and the resins. the delay is the delay time between each intake and expulsion step to allow for contact with the solution. the position axis is the distance from the tip to the bottom of the plate. the s values obtained with the c(s) distribution in sodium acetate buffer were converted to s20,w0 value with SEDNTERP (version 1.09). protein A/G was amine-coupled onto the chip surface using a standard coupling protocol. the capture time was monitored to achieve a high antibody surface density (2000\u20133000 RU) because of the high abundance of mouse IgGs in the serum samples, a capture time of 120\u2013150 s was sufficient to reach the targeted density level. the immobilized ligand level is the level of captured serum IgGs, which includes both endogenous IgGs and antigen-specific IgGs. a diluted sample (2 ml) of each purified mouse IgG was concentrated using a 100,000 molecular weight cutoff centrifugal filter device (Millipore, Billerica, MA) dilution and mixing of 8 l of sample with 80 l of deuterium exchange buffer (10 mm NaH2PO4 in D2O, pH 7.4) incubation of mixture at 20 \u00b0C for various time periods (60, 120, and 240 s), during which exchange reaction took place. a work list was written using HDxDirector (version 1.0.4.0) the chromatographic separation was performed at 4 \u00b0C at a flow rate of 180 l/min. the sample entered the Orbitrap FusionTM mass spectrometer operated in positive electrospray ionization mode. no MS/MS data were collected for deuterated samples. the epitopes were determined by calculating the differences in average mass shifting induced by the protection of the region from deuterium labeling. mouse anti-IL-13 mAb clone DL11 was produced by transient expression in CHO cells and purified using Mabselect SuRe-based affinity chromatography. mice were immunized twice with human BAFF. spleens harvested for hybridoma fusion using standard techniques. positive candidates were cloned by limiting dilution.
