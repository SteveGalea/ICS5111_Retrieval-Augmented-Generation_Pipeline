{"summary": "Ub is first activated via an ATP-dependent thioester linkage to an E1 enzyme. the energy in that unstable bond is then used to couple the Ub moiety\u2019s C-terminal residue to the catalytic Cys residue of an E2 Ub conjugating enzyme. the specificity of that conjugation process is conferred by the over 600 E3 Ub ligases encoded by the human genome. PHD domains are found in many chromatin-binding proteins. only two examples of PHD proteins with E3 activity have surfaced. a subset of this family are referred to as E4 ligases. all seven Lys residues within Ub can be used to build chains. ubiquitination can be reversed by de-ubiquitinating (DUB) proteases. ubiquitination can be reversed by de-ubiquitinating (DUB) proteases. studies of several viral classes have shown that post-entry steps such as nucleocapsid transport and/or disassembly are impaired in the presence of proteasome inhibitors or in cell lines expressing a temperature sensitive mutant of the Ub-activating enzyme E1. a more direct role for the UPS in influenza virus entry was shown when either depletion of Epsin 1 or expression of a non-ubiquitinable Epsin 1 mutant blocked clathrin- adenovirus entry has identified ubiquitination of the capsid protein VI as a key step in viral transport to the nucleus. the virus contains a PPXY motif that recruits a member of the neural-precursor-cell-expressed, developmentally down-regulated (Nedd4) family of E3 Ub ligases. this interaction is necessary for the microtubule-dependent localization of protein VI. viral entry/nucleocapsid transport is sensitive to proteasome inhibitors Yu and Lai (2005). ritic cell and macrophage infection by HIV-1 suggests this will be case. mouse studies evaluating proteasome inhibitor bortezomib found that lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV; Basler et al., 2009), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV; Raaben et al., 2010a) and human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) each replicated better in the presence of bortezomib. treatment of MHV-infected mice with three proteasome inhibitors resulted in reduced viral replication and a 40% survival rate. the transactivator proteins encoded by Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), HIV, and human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) each appear to interact with the UPS. this increases binding of EBNA1 to the viral oriP site. HTLV-1 transactivator Tax is also monoubiquitinated (Chiari et al., 2004) and sumoylated (Nasr et al., 2006). these modifications appear to enhance Tax\u2019s ability to activate NF-B. this in turn is necessary for viral transactivation and is also responsible for the oncogenic properties of the virus. HTLV-1 Tax ubiquitination is important for NF-B activation Nasr et al. (2006), Harhaj et al. (2006) Unknown Pox: vaccinia, ectromelia and cowpox Viral replication inhibited by proteasome inhibitors Lupfer and Pastey (2010) Unknown Picorna: coxsackie Viral replication inhibited by proteasome inhibitors. virus with mutated DUB cleared faster in vivo Gredmark-Russ et al. (2009) ORF73 Associates with ElonginC/Cul5/SOCS-like complex to ubiquitinate and degrade RelA/NF-B. the cellular protein Ku70 is involved in DNA repair, the non-homologous end-joining pathway, transcription, apoptosis, and telomere maintenance. if Ku70 is knocked down with siRNA, integrase levels are diminished. a virus expressing an ORF64 with an alanine substitution for the critical active site cysteine was more rapidly cleared than the wildtype virus in an in vivo mouse model. a MHV68 virus with a mutation of the ORF73 SOCS-box motif was unable to induce B-cell proliferation or set up a persistent infection. Ikeda and Longnecker (2009) investigated the role that c-Cbl might play in LMP2A regulation. they found that LMP2A is ubiquitinated and degraded in a c-Cbl-dependent manner and that the Syk kinase is also degraded by c-Cbl in the presence of LMP2A. lytic reactivation of Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) from latency is regulated by at least two UPS-dependent mechanisms. the viral replication and transcription activator (RTA) protein acts as an E3 Ub ligase that ubiquitinates and degrades its own repressors. a MHV68 virus with a mutation of the ORF73 SOCS-box motif was unable to induce B-cell proliferation or set up a persistent infection. the degradation of NF-B also has the potential to impact interferon (IFN) induction. an interesting twist on the role of the UPS in the regulation of viral latency is provided by the herpesvirus. c-Cbl induced lytic gene expression when c-Cbl was knocked down with shRNA. findings suggest that the cellular UPS is an important factor in the maintenance of EBV latency. the cellular UPS also appears to modulate latency through its interaction with the UPS. virus ubiquitin function modified Reference E6 Papilloma: HPV Interacts with HECT ligase E6AP to induce proteasomal degradation of p53, Bak (Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer), E6TP1 (E6 targeting protein 1), cMyc, MMP7 (matrix metalloprotease 7), NFX1 (nuclear transcription factor, X-box binding 1), and Siah-1 E1B55k Adeno: Ad5 Complexes with E3 Ub ligase Cul5/ElonginB/C/Rbx1 to induce degradation of p53, DNA ligase IV, and MRN DNA repair complex proteins Reviewed in Blanchette and Branton (2009), Isaacson and Ploegh (2009), Randow and Lehner (2009) E4orf6 Adeno: Ad12 Interacts with E3 Ub ligas Vpr Retro: HIV-1 Interacts with DCAF1/DDB1/Cul4 E3 Ub ligase, resulting in G2 arrest References in Casey et al. (2010) Large T Polyoma: SV40 Interacts with Fbw7, inhibiting the E3 Ub ligase Skp1/Cul/Rbx1/Fbw7. p53 appears to be upregulated by the activities of HPV E7. the cellular E3 ligase seven in absentia homolog (Siah-1) is inhibited by the combination of HPV E6 and E7. another player in the p53 pathway is targeted for proteasome-dependent degradation by E6. degradation of TIP60 serves to derepress both E6 expression as well as cellular genes whose products limit p53-dependent apoptosis. members of the cellular pRb/pocket protein family normally function to control G1/S-phase progression by inhibiting the E2F family of transcriptional activators. the most well-characterized E7 function is to target pRb family members for UPS-dependent degradation, thereby derepressing E2F-dependent promoters. papillomaviruses E2 The HPV protein E2 is a DNA-binding protein that can activate and repress the transcription of viral promoters. in cells infected with high risk HPV\u2019s, the viral genome frequently integrates into that of the host. HPV E2 has also been shown to interfere with cellular pathways in a Ub-dependent manner. papillomaviruses E5 have been shown to induce epithelial cell hyperproliferation when overexpressed in transgenic mice. it is thought that HPV E5 impacts the trafficking of proteins such as EGF-R. this stabilizes EGF-R and leads to constitutive signaling. E4orf6 functions as an adaptor that links E1B55k to various Cul containing E3 complexes. E1B55k acts as a substrate recognition subunit that redirects the new E3 complex to various cellular targets. the prevention of apoptosis leads to the accumulation of DNA damage within infected cells. all serotypes degraded DNA ligase IV, but complexes from some serotypes failed to degrade Mre11, p53, or integrin 3, suggesting that the choice of Cullin may dictate which targets are destroyed. adenoviral protein E4orf4 is known to induce cell death via a number of cell-type specific mechanisms. site residues in the Marek\u2019s disease virus homolog lowered viral replication and reduced the number of T-cell lymphomas among infected chickens. a similar mutation introduced into Pseudorabies virus also impaired viral replication and lowered virulence. EBNA3c was found in complexes with both p53 and Mdm2, the cellular E3 responsible for p53 ubiquitination. EBNA3c appears to both positively and negatively modulate the ubiquitin status of a number of proteins whose dysregulation can promote tumorigenesis. HBV is one of the primary causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) poxviruses presumed to manipulate host ubiquitin system via ankyrin-like proteins. only the Myxoma M-T5 ankyrin repeat protein has been shown to affect cell cycle. a direct role for ubiquitin in this process has not been shown. authors suggest PACR-dependent inhibition of APC may promote viral DNA replication by pushing host cells toward S-phase. each of these proteins has been shown to function as adaptors for various Cul-based E3 ligase complexes. in the mid-1990s, several laboratories observed that Vpr induces a G2 cell cycle arrest in dividing cells. human papillomaviruses E6 can function as an adaptor to redirect the cellular E6-associated protein (E6AP) HECT ligase to target a number of cellular proteins for proteasome-dependent degradation. p53 appears to be upregulated by the activities of HPV E7. cellular E3 ligase (E6AP) to target another cellular E3 ligase (Siah-1). another player in the p53 pathway, the tumor suppressor TIP60, is targeted for proteasome-dependent degradation by E6. degradation of TIP60 serves to derepress E6 expression. E7 is a relatively unstable protein that has been found to be ubiquitinated on its N-terminal residue and then destroyed by the proteasome. the only complex also shown to contain pRb is Cul2/ElonginBC/Rbx1 (Huh et al., 2004), suggesting that this is the Ub ligase responsible for pRb degradation. HPV E2 interacts with the substrate-specificity subunits of the anaphase promoting complex (APC) E3 ligase. this inhibits normal APC-dependent Cyclin B degradation. however, HPV E2 is itself a known APC target, and APC-dependent Skp2 degradation is required to maintain cells in G1. HPV E5 affects the trafficking of proteins such as EGF-R. this prevents the receptor from binding to the cellular E3 c-Cbl. this stabilizes EGF-R and leads to constitutive signaling. adenovirus blocks the ATM (ataxia telangie) to prevent apoptosis. most serotypes, including Ad5 and Ad12, prevent the activation of the ATM pathway by inducing the degradation of the MRN (Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1) DNA damage complex via the mechanism just described. however, it has recently been shown that Ad5 and Ad12 prevent the activation of the ATM pathway in different ways. adenoviral protein E4orf4 is known to induce cell death via cell-type specific mechanisms. it is known to induce cell death via a number of cell-type specific mechanisms. a similar mutation introduced into Pseudorabies virus impaired viral replication and lowered virulence. the same group focused on BPLF1 and found that it functions to dysregulate the host cell cycle in an effort to promote viral DNA replication. this was shown to depend on BPLF1\u2019s ability to proteolytically remove the ubiquitin-like modifier protein NEDD8 from Cul1 and Cul4a. this in turn leads to the stabilization of the Cul substrate CDT1 which then pushes the host cell toward S-phase. HBx is one of the primary causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the viral protein HBx has been shown to promote cell cycle progression via a number of mechanisms. the later finding that DDB1 is a part of Cul4a E3 ligase complex suggests that HBx functions to interfere with such complexes. ankyrin-like proteins have been found to interact with Cul1 ligase complexes. only the Myxoma M-T5 ankyrin repeat protein has been shown to affect the cell cycle. however, a direct role for ubiquitin in this process has not been shown. in the mid-1990s, several laboratories observed that Vpr induces a G2 cell cycle arrest in dividing cells. some have argued that the titration of host Ub ligases may result in G2 arrest, and perhaps other Vpr phenotypes. viral budding proceeds in a manner analogous to that in which ubiquitinated membrane proteins destined for lysosomal degradation are recognized by the host vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) machinery. for those viruses whose budding is VPS-dependent, their viral Gag or matrix proteins are found to harbor so-called late budding domains. a role for Ub in retroviral budding came from studies showing retroviral Gag proteins were ubiquitinated. proteasome inhibitors have been shown to prevent budding. some studies have mutated all lysines within the vicinity of L-domains. the identity of at least one cellular ubiquitination target is perhaps suggested by weiss et al. (2010) who find that a number of Nedd4 ligases, including yeast Rsp5, will promote VLP formation when targeted to Gag. but that budding does not correlate with the ability of these ligases to ubiquitinate Gag. PPXY-dependent Tsg101 is recruited to VP40 in a PPXY-dependent manner. this is a unique example of non-PT/SAP-dependent Tsg101 interaction. NP and/or GP may also play a role in recruiting those proteins. the FPIV motif is not observed in the M proteins from measles, sendai, and Nipah virus, suggesting variability in paramyxoviral budding pathways. support for this notion comes from studies of Nipah virus, which encodes an M protein necessary for VLP production. VSV M protein was found to bind Nedd4 E3 ligases. proteasome inhibitors limit viral release, suggesting that Ub is involved. however, budding does not appear to depend upon Tsg101 or downstream players in the ESCRT pathway. the release of infectious HBV from cells has been shown to depend on the host VPS pathway. a PPXY motif has been shown to interact with Nedd4 (Rost et al., 2006), implicating a role for ubiquitination. the identity of at least one cellular ubiquitination target is perhaps suggested by weiss et al. (2010) who find that a number of Nedd4 ligases, including yeast Rsp5, will promote VLP formation when targeted to Gag. however, budding does not correlate with the ability of these ligases to ubiquitinate Gag. the VP40 PPXY mutant rescues budding is recruited to VP40 in a PPXY-dependent manner. it provides a unique example of non-PT/SAP-dependent Tsg101 interaction. NP and/or GP may also play a role in recruiting those proteins. if the PIV5 FPIV motif functions as a binding site for either ESCRT components or Nedd4 ligases. support comes from studies of Nipah virus, which encodes an M protein that is necessary and sufficient for VLP production. VSV M protein was found to bind Nedd4 E3 ligases, and proteasome inhibitors limit viral release, suggesting that Ub is involved. however, unlike other viruses that utilize PPXY L-domains, VSV budding does not appear to depend upon either Tsg101 or downstream players. release of infectious HBV from cells has been shown to depend on host VPS pathway. mutation of the two Lys residues within the core protein had no effect on budding. however, alternate Ub acceptor residues may instead be targeted. Vpu-mediated ubiquitination of Tetherin can occur on all lysine and non-lysine Ub targets in the cytoplasmic tail. some viral release enhancement has been attributed to CD4 depletion. gammaherpesvirus KSHV induces ubiquitination of Tetherin\u2019s cytosolic lysines. other viruses, such as HIV-2 (Douglas et al., 2009), SIV (Jia et al., 2009); and Ebola (Kaletsky et al., 2009) also express antagonists of Tetherin. -divided into the main steps of the IFN pathway that are targeted by various viral classes. the most recent evidence for viral misappropriation of the UPS to subvert anti-viral immunity. A20 inhibits NF-B activation Yokota et al. (2008) Unknown Orthomyxo: influenza Onose et al. (2006) HSV Interacts with and redirects DUB USP7 to the cytoplasm where it binds and deubiquitinates TRAF6 Daubeuf et al.

(2008) mk3 Herpes: MHV68 E3 Ub ligase activity induces Ub and proteasomal degradation of MHC-1 the host cell has a variety of viral sensing mechanisms that ultimately trigger IFN production. this signaling cascade begins with several classes of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), including the toll-like receptors (TLRs), Retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), and the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors. a particular MAVS lysine mutant exhibited increased IFN- activation. the particular E3 Ub ligase involved in this process has not been identified. flaviviruses encode NPro, a papain-like protease that acts as an IFN antagonist by binding and inducing the polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IRF3. HSV encodes the multifunctional protein ICP0. it interferes with several stages of the IFN pathway. inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) or IRF3 pathways does not enhance replication of ICP0-deleted viruses. rotavirus NSP1 protein also mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of the cellular E3 Ub ligase F-box protein beta-transducin repeating containing protein (TrCP), which regulates NF-B activation via the degradation of the NF-B inhibitor IB. CP77 contains both an F-box motif that mediates binding to the SCF complex and ankyrin repeats responsible for binding to NF-B. viral transcriptional activator ICP0 has been shown to interact with and redirect the cellular DUB USP7 to the cytoplasm where it deubiquitinates TRAF6 and IKK. NS5 polymerase interacts with STAT2 leading to STAT2 ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. NS5 alone can interact with STAT2, but does not induce degradation except in the context of the polyprotein. it is not known whether a cellular Ub ligase is involved or if the proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein somehow leads to the degradation of STAT2. downregulation of IFN-induced proteins Interferon is responsible for activating many anti-viral genes. viruses that fail to avoid early IFN signaling still have many opportunities to circumvent downstream anti-viral events. the gammaherpesviruses also target MHC-1 for degradation. K3 and K5 can downregulate all classes of MHC-1, HLA-A, B, C, and E. gammaherpesviruses also target MHC-1 for degradation. the removal of MHC-1 from the cell surface may be a good strategy to prevent cytotoxic T-cell killing. the differential targeting of MHC-1 molecules by K3 and K5 may be one mechanism for the virus to block CTL killing without overtly activating NK cells. the rabbit myxomavirus M153R protein appears to downregulate both MHC-1 and CD4 in a Ub-dependent manner. the HPV E5 protein has recently been shown to downregulate the T-cell activation factor CD1d in a proteasome-dependent manner. KSHV K3 ubiquitination of MHC-1 provided the first report of an E3 Ub ligase targeting a cysteine for ubiquitination via a thioester linkage. mK3 conjugates ubiquitin to MHC-1 serine and threonine residues via ester bonds. sequences outside the RING-CH domain are also required for this altered specificity. mutants without deaminase activity express the Vif accessory protein that counteracts this restriction by inducing the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of APOBEC3G. there is currently some debate as to whether Vif induces the direct ubiquitination of APOBEC or if Vif is itself ubiquitinated. APL results from a chromosomal translocation at the PML locus. this gives rise to a pair of new PML\u2013retinoic acid receptor fusion proteins. this gives rise to a pair of new PML\u2013retinoic acid receptor fusion proteins. sivachandran et al. (2010) hypothesize that EBNA1 enhances CK2\u2019s effect on PML. but also requires USP7 binding for complete PML NB disruption. daxx is a host-encoded transcription repressor that can inhibit viral gene expression. many viruses have evolved mechanisms that utilize the UPS to degrade specific players within these pathways, thereby limiting IFN production. influenza NS1 protein interacts with TRIM25, thereby preventing the ubiquitination of RIG-I. flaviviruses encode NPro, a papain-like protease that acts as an IFN antagonist by binding and inducing the polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IRF3. the rotavirus NSP1 protein has also been shown to block IFN production by inducing the degradation of IRF3, IRF5 and IRF7. ICP0 E3 Ub ligase activity has been implicated in this function. however, recent data indicates that inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription does not enhance the replication of ICP0-deleted viruses. this may be secondary to its involvement in promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and sp100 degradation. the cowpox host-range protein CP77 has also been found to inhibit NF-B activation. CP77 contains both an F-box motif that mediates binding to the SCF complex and a series of ankyrin repeats responsible for binding to NF-B. influenza and HBV use Ub-dependent mechanisms to target RIG-I either directly or through its downstream effector the mitochondrial anti-viral signaling protein (TRIM). influenza NS1 protein interacts with TRIM25, thereby preventing the ubiquitination of RIG-I. flaviviruses encode NPro, a papain-like protease that acts as an IFN antagonist by binding and inducing the polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IRF3. the rotavirus NSP1 protein has also been shown to block IFN production by inducing the degradation of IRF3, IRF5 and IRF7. HSV encodes the multifunctional protein ICP0, which interferes with several stages of the IFN pathway. ICP0 E3 Ub ligase activity has been implicated in this function. recent data indicates that inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription does not enhance the replication of ICP0-deleted viruses. ubiquitination and degradation of the cellular E3 Ub ligase F-box protein beta-transducin repeating containing protein (TrCP), which regulates NF-B activation via the degradation of the NF-B inhibitor IB. CP77 contains both an F-box motif that mediates binding to the SCF complex and a series of ankyrin repeats responsible for binding to NF-B. influenza and hepatitis C have also been shown to inactivate NF-B via A20 induction. viral transcriptional activator ICP0 has been shown to interact with and redirect the cellular DUB USP7 to the cytoplasm where it deubiquitinates TRAF6 and IKK. it is not known whether a cellular Ub ligase is involved or if the proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein somehow leads to the degradation of STAT2. it is not known whether a cellular Ub ligase is involved or if the proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein somehow leads to the degradation of STAT2. the host uses MHC-1 as a means to present viral antigens at the cell surface for recognition by cytotoxic T-cells. the HCMV US2 and US11 gene products act in the ER to target MHC-1 for dislocation from the ER into the cytoplasm. the gammaherpesviruses also target MHC-1 for degradation. the gammaherpesviruses encode their own E3 Ub ligases. the differential targeting of MHC-1 molecules by K3 and K5 may be one mechanism for the virus to block CTL killing without overtly activating NK cells. K5 has also been shown to downregulate the NKG2D ligands MHC class I-related chain A (MICA), MICB, and the ligand for NKp80, activation-induced C-type lectin. the rabbit myxomavirus M153R protein contains a RING-CH domain. it appears to downregulate both MHC-1 and CD4 in a proteasome-dependent manner. the HPV E5 protein has recently been shown to downregulate CD1d in a proteasome-dependent manner. apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3) genes encode a family of cytidine deaminases. of the family members, APOBEC3G and 3F appear to have the highest anti-viral activity. mutants without deaminase activity still show anti-retroviral activity. retroviruses express the Vif accessory protein that counteracts this restriction by inducing the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of APOBEC3G. there is currently some debate as to whether Vif induces the direct ubiquitination of APOBEC or if Vif acts as a suicide molecule that delivers APOBEC to the proteasome. the HCMV US2 and US11 gene products act in the ER to target MHC-1 for Ub-dependent ER-associated degradation. the gammaherpesviruses also target MHC-1 for degradation. the gammaherpesviruses also target MHC-1. several groups have demonstrated that K5 decorates surface-associated MHC-1 with a mixed-linkage ubiquitin chain. this stimulates the Epsin1-dependent endocytosis and subsequent lysosomal degradation of MHC-1. K3 and K5 can downregulate all classes of MHC-1, HLA-A, B, C, and E. MHV68, the mouse homolog of KSHV, only encodes mK3. mK3 appears to function in the ER via interaction with transporter. rfK3 appears to downregulate both MHC-1 and CD4 in a Ub-dependent manner. E5 has been proposed to inhibit calnexin-dependent trafficking of CD1d. however, this has been attributed to E5\u2019s interaction with the vacuolar ATPase. this leads to endosome acidification and retention of MHC-1 in the ER. apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3) genes encode a family of cytidine deaminases. of the family members, APOBEC3G and 3F appear to have the highest anti-viral activity. some groups have shown that APOBEC3 might have other deleterious effects on the virus. one group has demonstrated the polyubiquitination of an APOBEC mutant devoid of lysine residues. the APOBEC N-terminal-MET residue is targeted for ubiquitination. this same group has shown that APOBEC degradation can occur without simultaneous Vif degradation. EBV disrupts PML NBs through the action of the viral transactivator EBNA1. phosphorylation of PML by CK2 is important for PML\u2019s subsequent polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. adenovirus E1B55K also targets Daxx for ubiquitination and proteasomal destruction. adenovirus E1B55K also targets Daxx for ubiquitination and proteasomal destruction. et al.
