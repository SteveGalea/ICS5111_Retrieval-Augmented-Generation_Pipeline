{"summary": "miRNAs play a variety of roles in many cellular processes including development, differentiation, apoptosis, cell cycle. the miRNA-mediated interference includes two patterns. one is perfectly base-paring with 3' UTR of target mRNA leading to degradation of mRNA. another is imperfectly binding to target 3' UTR of mRNA resulting in the inhibition of mRNA translation. the TGEV gene 7 locates at the 3'end of the genome. protein 7 attenuates host antiviral response by interacting with protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PP1c), a key regulator of host antiviral defense 13. miR-122 promotes hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA translation through hybridizing with the 5' end of viral transcript 15, 16. horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody was purchased from Pierce (Pierce, Rockford, IL, US) PK-15 cells were grown in Dulbecco's Minimal Essential Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, US), 100 IU of penicillin and 100 mg of streptomycin per ml. 50 nM stem-loop RT primers, 1first strand buffer, 0.25 U/L RNase inhibitor, 10 U/L M-MLV, and 10 mM DTT were incubated at 16 \u00b0C for 30 min, 42 \u00b0C for 30 min, and 85 \u00b0C for 5 min. real-time PCR was carried out using the AccuPower 2Greenstar qPCR Master mix. luciferase reporter experiments 3' UTRs of 16 candidate target genes containing the binding site of miR-4331 were amplified by PCR using primers containing sequences of Xho I and Not I cloning sites. seed region was mutated following a mutagenesis protocol 25. RNA interference Three siRNAs (si-CDCA7-1, siCDCA7-2, siCDCA7-3) silencing CDCA7 gene and irrelevant siRNA were synthesized by Ribo Biotech. PK-15 cells were transfected with 50 nM CDCA7-specific siCDCA7-2 or irrelevant siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000. PK-15 cells were transfected with pCI-neo vector (control) or pCI-neo-CDCA7. at 48 hours post-infection cells were infected with TGEV at MOI of 1.0. TGEV subgenomic transcription in the presence of miR-4331 mimics and inhibitors PK-15 cells were seeded in 6-well plate (5105 cells/well) at 24 hpt, the cells were infected with TGEV at MOI of 1.0. the transcription of virus was determined by real-time PCR analysis. miRNAs microarray and target prediction of differentially expressed miRNAs Confluent PK-15 cells in 100-mm cell culture dish were infected with TGEV for 24 h at an MOI of 1.0. at 24 hpi, total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, US) target predicted by TargetScan and miRanda. the quantification of subgenomic mRNAs was normalized to U6 using the Ct method 23. a total of 2 g of RNA was treated with DNase I for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. miR-4331 mimics (sense strand 5'-UGUGUGUGUGUGUGUGUGUGUGUGUGUGUGGUAGGCCAGC-3'); antisense strand 5'- UCUACUCUUUUCUAGGAGGUUGUGUGUGA-3'; antisense strand 5'- UCUACUCUUUCUAGGAGGUUGUGUGUGA-3') were synthesized by Ribo Biotech (RiboBio, Guangzhou the negative control siRNA is an irrelevant siRNA. PK-15 cells were transfected with 50 nM siCDCA7-2 or irrelevant siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000. the total RNA was isolated at 12 and 24 hpi. PK-15 cells were transfected with pCI-neo vector (control) or pCI-neo-CDCA7. total RNAs were extracted at 12 and 24 hpi according to manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed to detect sgmRNAs level. microarray was performed with the total RNA extracted from PK-15 cells infected with TGEV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0. the differential expression of multiple miRNAs in TGEV-infected cells was observed in Fig. 1(A) 13 miRNAs were up-regulated and 8 miRNAs were down-regulated. the map showed all significantly differentially expressed miRNAs in three independent samples (p 0.01) the fold change was determined using the 2-Ct method. all miRNAs expression values were normalized to endogenous U6. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. the effect of miR-4331 on TGEV transcription of gene 7 was assessed by real-time PCR analysis (Normalized to gRNA and in reference to the level of the control). data represent mean S.D. of three independent experiments. target of miR-4331 predicted by TargetScan and miRanda. the constructs were co-transfected into PK-15 cells with miR-4331 mimics, miR-4331 inhibitors, or negative control. compared with the control, introduction of exogenous miR-4331 decreased the CDCA7-WT reporter activity by 64%. overexpression and knockdown of miR-4331 mimics and inhibitors did not affect CDCA7-mut reporter activity. CDCA7 is a direct target of miR-4331 in PK-15 cells. the effect of miR-4331 on 3' UTRs of 16 potential target genes measured by dual-luciferase reporter assay (normalized to firefly) western blot analysis of endogenous CDCA7 protein level in TGEV-infected cells at 24 hpi by knockdown of endogenous miR-4331 using miR-4331 inhibitors. data represent means S.D. of three independent experiments. overexpression of CDCA7 facilitated transcription of gene 7 at 12 and 24 hpi. CDCA7 had no effect on TGEV gRNA level, other sgmRNAs level, and viral titers. results showed that CDCA7 had no effect on TGEV gRNA level. TGEV infection induced miRNA profiling changes. miR-4331 induced by TGEV infection inhibited transcription of gene 7 via directly targeting CDCA7. microarray was performed with total RNA extracted from PK-15 cells infected with TGEV at 24 hpi. PK-15 cells were transfected with miR-4331 mimics, mimics control, inhibitors, or inhibitors control. the miR-4331 level increased after transfection with the miRNA mimics and decreased after transfection of the inhibitors in comparison with the control. miR-4331 levels in PK-15 cells infected with TGEV at 12 and 24 hpi. effect of miR-4331 on TGEV transcription of gene 7 was assessed by real-time PCR analysis. two binding sites of miR-4331 seed sequence at CDCA7 3' UTR were respectively mutated with the 3-bp substitution. the porcine CDCA7 3' UTR or its mutant was respectively subcloned into the 3' UTR of a Renilla luciferase gene in a luciferase reporter psiCHECK-2. the constructs were co-transfected into PK-15 cells with miR-4331 mimics, TGEV infection decreased CDCA7 protein levels in PK-15 cells. downregulation of endogenous miR-4331 using miR-4331 inhibitors reversed the effect of TGEV infection on CDCA7 expression. western blot analysis of endogenous CDCA7 protein level in TGEV-infected cells at 24 hpi. results represent means S.D. of three independent experiments. effect of CDCA7 on TGEV transcription of gene 7 is unclear. the results showed that silence of CDCA7 using siCDCA7-2 decreased transcription of gene 7 at 12 and 24 hpi. overexpression of CDCA7 facilitated transcription of gene 7 at 12 and 24 hpi. the results showed that CDCA7 had no effect on TGEV gRNA level. TGEV infection leads to the change of cellular miRNAs expression profile, and altered miRNAs regulate transcription of TGEV gene 7 through targeting cellular CDCA7. miRNAs regulate viral infection through interacting with targets. miR-4331 suppresses transcription of TGEV gene 7. TGEV gene 7, a non-structure gene, contributes to viral invasion and inhibits apoptosis in host cells 13. miR-4331 was detected in porcine intestinal and milk by deep sequencing 32, 33. the phosphorylated CDCA7 regulates c-MYC-dependent apoptosis and transformation 36. this opens a new avenue to target host cellular factors using siRNA technologies to combat TGEV transcription. dewen Tong revised the manuscript. all authors have read the manuscript and approved to submit it."}
