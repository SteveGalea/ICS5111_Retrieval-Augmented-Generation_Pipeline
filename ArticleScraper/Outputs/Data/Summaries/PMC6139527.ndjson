{"summary": "chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by a progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) over more than 3 months. most patients do not have symptoms or markers until later in the course of the disease when it becomes chronic (9) there is an urgent need to develop new molecular markers for the early detection and management of CKD. angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a recently discovered peptidase with the capability to degrade the vasoconstrictor Ang II to Angiotensin (1\u20137) [Ang- (1\u20137)], a bioactive peptide with vasodilatory activity. ACE2 in the human kidney shares similar structural and functional properties to that of rodents (25). Ang II type 1 receptors promote ADAM17 mediated ACE2 shedding in hypertensive patients. in vitro studies showed that the release of ACE2 into the culture media of human proximal tubular cells was inhibited by treatment with the ADAM17 inhibitor TNF- protease inhibitor-1 (41). because of its vital role, there is a need for investigating ACE2 as an early marker for CKD and understanding the role of ADAM17 in mediating urinary ACE in 2014, management of chronic heart failure through NEP inhibition received more attention based on the positive cardiovascular effects seen in the PARADIGM-HF trial. emerging evidence suggests that NEP could be a novel marker for cancer (30) however, the role of renal NEP in patients with diabetes and its presence in urine or plasma of CKD patients has not been elucidated. eGFR was done by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. patients with liver dysfunction, heart failure, malignancy, pregnancy, and glomerulonephritis were excluded from the study. eGFR was done by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula. the absorbance values were measured at 450 nm for urinary albumin and 490 nm for urinary creatinine using a Fusion Packard plate reader. the ACE2 enzyme activity was measured as described previously, with some modifications. biotinylated goat anti-human antibody was added and incubated for 2 h. unbound streptavidin-horse radish peroxidase was washed off, and streptavidin-horse radish peroxidase was added. reaction stopped using 2 N sulfuric acid. the reaction was stopped by acidification with 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and 1:20 dilution using 90% acetonitrile containing 0.3% TFA. a total of 3,000 laser shots were acquired randomly for each spot in the range of mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 500\u20133,000 at a laser frequency of 100 Hz. immobilon western chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore) and autoradiography imaging method by Medical film processor (Konica Minolta Medical & Graphic, Inc., Wayne, NJ) were used to detect signals. relative intensities of protein bands were quantified by Image J software. analysis was performed using Graph Pad Prism 5.01 and R software. urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) turned to normal. patients with liver dysfunction, heart failure, malignancy, pregnancy, and glomerulonephritis were excluded from the study. plasma was transferred to sterile tubes containing 50 l of the same protease inhibitor cocktail described above, aliquoted, and stored at 80\u00b0C. medical history and anthropometric measurements were also recorded the same day. MLN-4760 (a gift from the former Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA), the prolyl endopeptidase/prolyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor Z-prolinal (ZPP; Enzo Life Sciences) and NEP inhibitor thiorphan (Sigma-Aldrich) Urine and plasma samples were analyzed for NEP using a human ELISA kit. 0.5 mM 4-aminophosphonobutyric acid, 0.1 mM MLN-4760, and 0.1 mM Lisinopril were added. ACE2 activity was tested using 0.1 mM Thiorphan. the reaction was stopped by acidification with 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) blots were then blocked and probed with goat anti-mouse ACE2 (1:1,000 dilution, R&D Systems), goat anti-mouse NEP/CD10 (1:1000 dilution, R&D Systems), rabbit anti-human ADAM17 (1:1,000 dilution, abcam, Cambridge, MA) primary antibodies followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat secondary antibody (1:2,000, R&D Systems) cross-validation was applied to calculate the prediction accuracies. a total of 60 patients with a history of microalbuminuria (30\u2013300 mg albumin/g creatinine) were considered. urine samples (15\u201320 ml) were collected into a sterile container containing 50 l of the protease inhibitor cocktail described above. plasma was transferred to sterile tubes containing 50 l of the same protease inhibitor cocktail described above, aliquoted, and stored at 80\u00b0C. ACE2 fluorogenic peptide substrate 7-Mca-APK-(Dnp) was measured at excitation (ex) of 328 nm and emission (em) of 393 nm using a Fusion Packard instrument. ACE2 enzyme fluorogenic assay was validated and confirmed by inhibition with 10 M of specific inhibitors. urine sample equivalent to 25 g of creatinine was incubated with 0.4 M MES buffer pH 6.75 and 10 M Ang II or 70 M Ang I for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. ACE2 activity was tested using 0.1 mM MLN-4760 and 0.1 mM Lisinopril. a total of 3,000 laser shots were acquired randomly for each spot in the range of mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 500\u20133,000 at a laser frequency of 100 Hz. blots were then blocked and probed with goat anti-mouse ACE2 (1:1,000 dilution, R&D Systems), goat anti-mouse NEP/CD10 (1:1000 dilution, R&D Systems), rabbit anti-human ADAM17 (1:1,000 dil tests were used to further explore the difference in ACE2/NEP between any given subject groups. a linear regression for Pearson\u2019s population correlation was constructed to identify the association between ACE2 or NEP with selected parameters. a P value of P 0.05 was considered statistically significant. inuria, n = 20 Age, yr 51.2 14.9 63.2 11.5a 67 8.4a 64.3 8.8a Male sex (no. %) 15 (93.7) 11 (91.7) 8 (100) 20 (100) Race (no. %) White 19 (93.7) 7 (58.3) 5 (62.5) 19 (95) Black 1 (6.2) 5 (41.7) 3 (37.5) 1 (5) Body-mass index, lbs/in2 30.9 0.5\u20134.4 Creatinine clearance, ml/min Median 131.6 104.4 65.29a 56a Interquartile range 114.6\u2013147.8 78.5\u2013155.4 33.9\u201394.8 38.1\u201399.0 Glucose, mg/dl Median 102 129 130 146.5b Interquartile range 92.7\u2013109.3 87.0\u2013160.0 128\u2013182 125\u2013186.3 Medications.

ACE2 and ACE2 are good risk predictors for diabetes in terms of HbA1C and CKD in terms of eGFR. ACE2 excretion was observed because of hyperglycemia, elevated risk of cardiovascular diseases, activated RAS (21) and existence of microalbuminuria in healthy patients. both urinary ACE2 and NEP are strongly correlated with HbA1C. only urinary ACE2 significantly correlates with eGFR (P 0.01) because of the absence of urinary ACE2 in ND individuals. ACE2 was first observed in the urine of healthy individuals (27) a significant decrease of plasma NEP in Dmacro compared with Dmicro may indicate contribution of plasma NEP to urinary NEP in patients with diabetes. recent studies suggest a role of ADAM17 in shedding of soluble, active NEP into the media of endothelial cells. the performance of ACE2 and NEP was not compared with albuminuria in ROC curves. further characterization of renal ADAM17 could give new insights into pathologies. the potential role of medication, including ACE inhibitors and Ang II type 1 receptor blockades, on urinary ACE2. long-term follow-up longitudinal studies in larger groups of patients at early stages of diabetes are needed to establish whether ACE2 and NEP could be used as early biomarkers for CKD. the performance of ACE2, NEP, and ADAM17 was not compared with albuminuria in ROC curves. analysis of urinary ADAM17 suggests a potential mechanistic basis for the degradation of ACE2 and NEP and the shedding of their proteolytic fragments into the urine. our findings suggest ACE2 and NEP as noninvasive biomarkers to assess kidney damage in patients with diabetes at an early stage. olmesartan was found to increase urinary ACE2 concentration in patients with diabetes with kidney disease and its association with reduced eGFR. olmesartan showed elevated urinary ACE2 in patients with diabetes with kidney disease and its association with reduced eGFR. analyzed data; S.G., N.G., M.K., H.O., M.S., G.L., and K.M.E. drafted manuscript."}
