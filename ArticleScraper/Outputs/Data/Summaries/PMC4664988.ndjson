{"summary": "fluorescent protein (FP)-based methodologies have revolutionized molecular and cell biology. this revolution has extended to virology in general, and to the study of alpha herpesviruses in particular. we provide a compendium of reported FP fusions to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and pseudorabies virus (PRV) structural proteins. many of the best FPs available today are only a few amino acids different from the parental EGFP. a monomeric derivative, mRFP1 [8], became very popular in 2002. a major focus is now on the creation of specialized FP variants. alpha herpesvirus strains expressing mCherry (red), enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP; depicted in green) segregate to produce single-color plaques after spread from neurons [35]. the first recombinant alpha herpesvirus expressing a FP was PRV [16], followed shortly by others, including HSV-1 [17], varicella-zoster virus. alpha herpesvirus strains expressing FPs are useful as cloning vectors for subsequent genetic manipulations of the virus. alpha herpesviruses can also be engineered to express a variety of other transgenes to probe cellular and virological processes. FP fusions to host proteins are not typically expressed well from the viral genome. these highly-specialized neural circuit tracing strains allow the kind of complex multifactorial experiments necessary to finely map neural circuits. FP-based techniques fill this gap, allowing dynamic viral processes to be imaged over a time course course. the first reported viral protein-FP fusion among the alpha herpesviruses was EGFP fused to the HSV-1 tegument protein VP22. this followed shortly by an EGFP fusion to the small capsid protein, VP26, described by Desai and Person in 1998. since then, there have been many functional FP fusions reported, including fusions to envelope, tegument, and capsid structural proteins. egress tegument a N-terminal [53,54] [44] UL37 interacts with UL36 tegument N-terminal [57] C-terminal [58] [56] UL46 VP11/12 most abundant tegument protein tegument N-terminal [60] [50] UL47 VP13. egress tegument a N-terminal [51]b UL31 nuclear UL48 VP16 transactivation of viral gene expression tegument N-terminal [62] C-terminal [57,62] [56,64] C-terminal [40,63] [64] US1 ICP22 regulation of viral gene expression tegument C-terminal [65] US3 protein kinase tegument N-terminal [66] C-terminal [67]b [48,68] US10 unknown tegu transmembrane protein envelope C-terminal, intravirion [86]d UL44 gC glycoprotein C, receptor binding envelope C-terminal, intravirion [87] UL49A gN glycoprotein N envelope C-terminal, intravirion [88] UL51 lipid-anchored membrane protein envelope C-terminal, extravirion [90]d US6 gD glycoprotein D, receptor binding, membrane fusion envelope C-terminal, intravirion [92 EGFP contains mutations that increase expression in higher eukaryotes, improve protein folding, accelerate chromophore maturation, and shift its excitation maximum from 395 nm (ultraviolet) to 488 nm (blue-green), variants were engineered creating blue, cyan, and yellow FPs. the first orange-red fluorescent protein was not identified until 1999. specialized FP variants include photo-activatable/switchable FPs [10,11] and biosensors designed to measure their local biochemical environment [12,13] photo-activatable/switchable FPs are valuable for both ensemble studies (e.g., pulse-chase experiments using live-cell fluorescence microscopy) current photo-activatable/switchable FPs are more fully reviewed elsewhere [14,15] alpha herpesvirus strains expressing FPs are useful as cloning vectors for subsequent genetic manipulations of the virus. the first recombinant alpha herpesvirus expressing a FP was PRV [16], followed shortly by others, including HSV-1 [17] and varicella-zoster virus [18]. PRV and HSV-1 strains have been engineered to conditionally replicate and express a fluorescent protein in subpopulations of neurons. these strains have also been created expressing GCaMP Ca2+ biosensors. alpha herpesviruses have been studied for decades using classical virological, biochemical, genetics, and electron microscopy approaches. these classical methods typically lack the spatiotemporal resolution to fully understand the kinetics and dynamics of viral processes. the first reported viral protein-FP fusion among the alpha herpesviruses was EGFP fused to the HSV-1 tegument protein VP22. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusions to viral capsid protein UL25 can be detected by cryo electron microscopy in herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and pseudorabies virus (PRV). five copies of UL25 are bound to each penton. the EGFP moiety (green) appears distal to the penton (P) UL37 interacts with UL36 tegument N-terminal [57] C-terminal [58] [56] UL46 VP11/12 most abundant tegument protein tegument N-terminal [57] C-terminal [60] [50] UL47 VP13/14 tegument N-terminal [61] [56] UL48 VP16 transactivation of viral gene expression tegument C-terminal UL22 gH glycoprotein H, membrane fusion envelope N-terminal, extravirion [81] UL27 gB glycoprotein B, receptor binding, membrane fusion envelope N-terminal, extravirion [82,83] [84] UL34 transmembrane protein, nuclear egress envelope a C-terminal [85]d UL43 multipass transmembrane protein envelope. FP-tagged VP26 incorporates hundreds of copies, producing a brightly fluorescent capsid; however incorporation is somewhat variable. FP-tagged VP26 incorporates hundreds of copies, producing a brightly fluorescent capsid; however incorporation is somewhat variable. UL17 is reported to tolerate FP fusion, but appears to incorporate 30% fewer copies than UL25 [42]. unpublished report of an FP fusion to the scaffold protease (VP24) remains inside capsids after assembly. more than 100 cells infected with each indicated virus were manually scored. intranuclear capsid concentration was scored as follows: +++, dense, as in panels G-I; +, small aggregates, as in panels E-H; \u2013, no aggregates. transgenes inserted in place of gG are also transcribed in the 3\u2019 UTR of the US3 transcript. this has been shown in some cases to reduce US3 protein expression. such potentially disruptive polar effects are difficult to predict, as viral promoters and other cis-acting elements are not well identified. introducing a transgene that is disadvantageous in any way can rapidly select for reversions, deletions, and compensatory mutations. introducing multiple homologous FPs can lead to frequent recombination and exchange of FP properties, a phenomenon previously described as 'GFP walking' the original construct expresses dTomato (red) Upon co-expression with Cre recombinase, site-specific recombination produces progeny virus genomes that express either mCerulean (cyan) or enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP; depicted in green) fused to a nuclear localization signal (NLS) tdTomato may recombine to produce dTomato, which forms intermolecular dimers. if tdTomato is fused to a viral protein of interest, recombination may produce unexpected and undesired dimerization of that viral protein. newer brainbow 3.0 cassettes have partially solved some of the problems mentioned above. FP-tagged VP26 incorporates hundreds of copies, producing a brightly fluorescent capsid. incorporation is somewhat variable and less than the 900 molecules predicted to be on a wild-type capsid. UL17 is also reported to tolerate FP fusion, but appears to incorporate about 30% fewer copies than UL25 [42] PK15 cells were infected with the indicated viruses. plaque sizes of recombinants are slightly smaller than that of parental PRV Becker. FP variants are generally brighter than their predecessors. gG locus transcribed as two co-terminal transcripts, the first expressing the US3 protein kinase, and the second expressing gG. transgenes inserted in place of gG are also transcribed in the 3\u2019 UTR of the US3 transcript, which has been shown in some cases to reduce US3 protein expression [104]. alpha herpesvirus genomes contain many repetitive sequences and are highly recombinogenic. this ability to expand and contract repeats by homologous recombination allows a virus population to more rapidly generate genetic diversity and more efficiently explore the fitness landscape. recombination between EYFP and mCerulean has 97% nucleotide identity. 12% of virus clones expressing mCerulean exhibited nuclear localization. non-Cre homologous recombination can transfer the NLS to mCerulean. tdTomato may recombine to produce dTomato, which forms intermolecular dimers. if tdTomato is fused to a viral protein of interest, recombination may produce unexpected and undesired dimerization of that viral protein. the best general-purpose FPs are optimized to be bright, stable, and relatively insensitive to their surroundings. some FPs are optimized for specialized purposes, such as FP biosensors that are designed to be more sensitive to their surroundings. the newest and most highly optimized FP variants may not be the best. fluorescence protein Maturation Time In a newly translated FP molecule, critical residues must undergo an oxidation reaction to form the fluorophore, a rate-limiting step that is 1\u20132 orders of magnitude slower than protein folding. the blue, cyan, green, yellow, and far-red FPs, including most of the Aequorea-derived FPs, mature on the order of tens of minutes. the alpha herpesviruses have a relatively fast replication cycle. in HSV-1, immediate-early gene expression peaks at 2\u20134 hpi. early gene expression and DNA replication is detectable as early as 3 hpi. DsRed-VP22 is undetectable at 4 hpi, and only beginning to reveal intracellular puncta at 8 hpi, near the end of the replication cycle. modern FP variants that mature in minutes are better suited to study early events in viral replication than those requiring hours. pKa values less than 4.5, these FPs will retain most of their fluorescence in even the most acidic intracellular compartments. the current generations of blue, cyan, and red FPs are relatively pH insensitive. green FPs are moderately pH sensitive mEGFP, mEmerald 6.0 [136] mNeonGreen 5.7 [122] mTagGFP2 5.0 [123] T-Sapphire 4.9 a UV-excited green FP superecliptic pHluorin 7.2 purposely optimized to be very pH sensitive. newer variants are somewhat improved mVenus, SYFP2 6.0 [117,138] mCit mNeonGreen may slightly outperform EGFP under acidic conditions. other FPs are highly pH sensitive, limiting their use in the study of virus proteins or particles in acidic compartments. newer yellow derivatives are improved, although still moderately pH sensitive. viruses were created using laborious restriction digestion and ligation-based methods. many existing FP fusions contain insertions of restriction sites or plasmid-derived sequences. however, many existing FP fusions worked very well, sometimes better than subsequent rationally-designed fusions. linkers containing residues that are small (glycine, alanine) or polar (serine, threonine, asparagine, asparagine) may favor the formation of unstructured flexible loops. proline residues disfavor the formation or extension of alpha helices. argon gas lasers produce 454.6 nm and 514.5 nm laser lines. they excite cyan and yellow FPs, respectively. now, microscopes typically use 405 nm laser diodes and 488 nm DPSS lasers. the best general-purpose FPs are optimized to be bright, stable, and relatively insensitive to their surroundings. some FPs are optimized for specialized purposes, such as FP biosensors designed to be more sensitive to their surroundings. fluorescent protein Maturation Time In a newly translated FP molecule, critical residues must undergo an oxidation reaction to form the fluorophore, a rate-limiting step that is 1\u20132 orders of magnitude slower than protein folding. the popular mRFP1 and mCherry also mature quickly, but other DsRed derivatives require many hours. the alpha herpesviruses have a relatively fast replication cycle. in HSV-1, immediate-early gene expression peaks at 2\u20134 h post infection. early gene expression and DNA replication is detectable as early as 3 hpi. PK15 cells were infected with pseudorabies virus strains expressing EGFP-tagged VP22 or DsRed-tagged VP22. the EGFP-tagged version produced nuclear and cytosolic puncta by 4 hpi. the slow maturation of DsRed-VP22 is not well matched to time-course of virus infection. a pH gradient, from moderately acidic early and recycling endosomes maturing into more acidic late endosomes, to most acidic in the lysosomes. the current generations of blue, cyan, and red FPs are relatively pH insensitive. green FPs are moderately pH sensitive mEGFP, mEmerald 6.0 [136] mNeonGreen 5.7 [122] mTagGFP2 5.0 [123] T-Sapphire 4.9 a UV-excited green FP superecliptic pHluorin 7.2 purposely optimized to be very pH sensitive. the most popular green FP, EGFP, has a pKa of 6.0. lower pKa, T-Sapphire, a UV-excited GFP derivative, mTagGFP2, may slightly outperform EGFP under acidic conditions. other FPs are highly pH sensitive, limiting their use in the study of virus proteins or particles in acidic compartments. high local FP concentration can intensify problems associated with weak FP dimerization. for example, there are reported to be 450 copies of tegument protein VP13/14 (UL47) per virion. this high local concentration is near the dissociation constant of EGFP derivatives that lack the monomerizing A206K mutation (Kd 0.1 mM) the newer red FPs TagRFP-T and FusionRed are reported to mature somewhat more slowly. the newer red FPs TagRFP-T and FusionRed are reported to mature somewhat more slowly. PK15 cells were infected with PRV strains expressing EGFP-tagged VP22 or DsRed-tagged VP22. the EGFP-tagged version produced nuclear and cytosolic puncta by 4 hpi. the slow maturation of DsRed is not well matched to time-course of virus infection. fluorescent protein pH Sensitivity Most intracellular membranes are acidified by the action of vacuolar ATPases. cargo of the secretory pathway experiences a gradient of pH, from near neutral in the ER, moderately acidified in the Golgi, to most acidic in post-Golgi secretory vesicles. the current generations of blue, cyan, and red FPs are relatively pH insensitive. with pKa values less than 4.5, these FPs will retain most of their fluorescence in even the most acidic intracellular compartments. to image viral proteins and particles, these FPs are the best choice. the most popular green FP, EGFP, has a pKa of 6.0, meaning it will lose half of its fluorescence in moderately acidic compartments like the trans-Golgi network. the potential for experimental artifacts due to the pH sensitivity of such fusions is underappreciated in the literature. pHluorin is strongly quenched in the secretory pathway, but dequenched upon exocytosis, allowing researchers to image individual exocytosis events. many existing FP fusions contain insertions of restriction sites or plasmid-derived sequences, and deletions or duplications in flanking viral genomic sequences. if any structure is known, inserting a FP into unstructured termini or loops may reduce the chances of the FP interfering with protein structure. if any structure is known, inserting a FP into unstructured termini or loops may reduce the chances of the FP interfering with protein function. powerful DPSS lasers can replace argon gas lasers as a source for 488 nm laser illumination. argon gas lasers produce 454.6 nm and 514.5 nm laser lines, which efficiently excite cyan and yellow FPs. this is unfortunate because some of the newest FPs in this range are among the brightest and most monomeric FPs available. high power LEDs centered around 450 nm and 505 nm are readily available. phosphor-converted LEDs produce broad spectra with low peak power. the alpha herpesviruses are among the very few capable of efficient anterograde axonal transport. PRV Bartha contains a large, 3 kb deletion in the unique short (US) genomic region, disrupting viral proteins gI (US7), gE (US8), US9, and US2. of these disrupted genes, US9 is essential for anterograde axonal transport in infected neurons. EGFP-tagged fusion protein is not functional in anterograde axonal transport in neurons. this fusion allows us to visualize the co-transport of EGFP-US9 and capsids in axons. this fusion allows us to visualize the co-transport of EGFP-US9 and capsids in neurons. the original strain containing an EGFP-VP26 fusion harbors an inadvertent 65 bp deletion upstream from the VP26 start codon [45] it is likely that this deletion is a compensatory mutation that causes reduced expression of the fusion protein. the mutant was constructed in Escherichia coli by BAC recombination. it is likely that the putative compensatory mutation is associated with expansion or contraction of a short sequence repeat region downstream of the UL35 (VP26) gene. a previous study identified copy number variation between common laboratory strains of PRV within this short sequence repeat region. repeated sequence contains a predicted binding site for the host transcriptional repressor CTCF. recombinant expressing VP26 fused to mVenus replicated well despite having a wild-type 65 bp upstream promoter region. mVenus contains the A206K mutation that further increases the dissociation constant to 74 mM. both factors, compensatory mutations reducing FP-VP26 expression and FP variants with reduced dimerization affinity, appear to improve replication. inducibly and ectopically expressed EGFP fusion to SCP acts as dominant negative. it is possible that EGFP-VP26 fusions in the alpha herpesviruses also act as dominant negatives in a less strict sense, by sequestering capsid proteins into nuclear aggregates. this idea was suggested by Nagel et al., and is supported by their identification of five different capsid proteins in intranuclear aggregates. newer FP variants were chosen based on the criteria discussed in Section 3. mEGFP, mNeonGreen, mCherry, and mTurquoise2 were previously described. we found that all VP26 fusions caused an 10-fold defect in single-step virus replication. alpha herpesviruses are among the very few capable of efficient anterograde axonal transport of replicated progeny. the alpha herpesviruses are among the very few capable of efficient anterograde axonal transport of replicated progeny. the transmembrane domain is located near the C-terminus, producing a very small, 3 amino acid extracellular domain with no known functional motifs. this protein was efficiently incorporated into virus particles, and its intracellular transport and localization was indistinguishable from that of wild-type US9 [147,148]. a caveat is that the US9-EGFP fusion protein is not functional in anterograde axonal transport in neurons. VP26 VP26 was one of the first herpesvirus proteins to be fused to a FP [41,46] but there are differing reports on the effect of FP fusions to VP26. some studies did not find any effect on virus replication kinetics [41,56], another reported moderate effects on cell-to-cell spread and pathogenesis in vivo. mixed plaque phenotypes were observed, with an approximately equal number of large and small plaques. however, transfection of purified nucleocapsid DNA from these two populations yielded the surprising result that DNA from small plaque clones could again generate small and large plaques. we independently constructed VP26 fusions to mEGFP and mCherry. the EGFP-VP26 HSV-1 mutant lacking the 65 bp upstream deletion was highly attenuated. another mutant expressing ECFP on the same genetic background only showed slight attenuation. ECFP has a 30-fold higher dissociation constant (Kd 3 mM) than EGFP (Kd 0.1 mM) EGFP fusions to VP26 in HSV-1 show strong disposition to form large \u201cassemblons\u201d earlier in infection. FP-VP26 expression level and FP dimerization propensity are two sides of same coin. FP-VP26 expression level and FP dimerization propensity are two sides of same coin. tranuclear aggregates also assemble relatively few individual intranuclear capsids [45]. biological systems take advantage of phase separations by balancing at the \u201ctipping point\u201d. capsid formation might be similar such that capsids rapidly assemble as soon as a critical capsid protein concentration is reached. we next imaged cells by spinning disk confocal microscopy at 6 h post-infection to determine extent of capsid assembly and aggregate formation. monomeric FPs produce generally less aggregation and more individual intranuclear capsids. mEGFP, containing the monomerizing A206K mutation, appears to be the best green capsid tag to date. the original PRV EGFP-VP26 mutant (PRV GS443, [46]) was constructed in Escherichia coli. Upon reconstitution of replicating virus, mixed plaque phenotypes were observed, with an approximately equal number of large and small plaques. however, transfection of purified nucleocapsid DNA from these two populations yielded the surprising result that DNA from small plaque clones could again generate small and large plaques. FP-VP26 mutant lacking 65 bp upstream deletion was highly attenuated. another mutant expressing ECFP on the same genetic background only showed slight attenuation. ECFP has a 30-fold higher dissociation constant (Kd 3 mM) than EGFP. nuclear aggregates formed by capsid proteins were found in cells infected with wild-type alpha herpesviruses. the early EGFP fusions to VP26 in HSV-1 show strong disposition to form large \u201cassemblons\u201d earlier in infection. FP-VP26 expression level and FP dimerization propensity are two sides of the same coin. EGFP-VP26 fusions form severe intranuclear aggregates. capsid formation can be described as an irreversible phase separation. a dimerizing FP might tip the balance, resulting in premature aggregation of capsid proteins. we found that all VP26 fusions caused an 10-fold defect in single-step virus replication (Figure 5B), and slightly reduced plaque sizes (Figure 5C). monomeric FPs produce generally less aggregation and more individual intranuclear capsids (Figure 5D\u2013K) by these criteria, the mTurquoise2 fusion appears to perform the best, and mRFP1 and mCherry fusions perform similarly well. immunofluorescence protocols require destructive fixation and permeabilization steps. they can easily introduce artifacts, ranging from over-extraction leading to loss or relocalization of proteins of interest to under-permeabilization leading to poor antibody accessibility [162]. there is currently a debate in the alpha herpesvirus literature whether nascent virus particles are fully assembled prior to long distance anterograde transport in axons. the details of this debate are discussed elsewhere [167,168,169] but if immunostaining of fully-assembled virus particles inside axons is inefficient, this could lead to an underestimation of fully-assembled virions transporting in axons. Flow virometry cell sorting was established over 50 years ago [173], modified to allow for fluorescence\u2013assisted sorting (FACS) [174], and is now used in a wide array of biomedical research. a single well-characterized high-affinity antibody serves as an epitope tag for immunoaffinity purification and a fluorescent probe for live-cell fluorescence microscopy. one method uses the light scattering properties of the particle. fluorescent labeling has been used to reliably detect and quantify viruses like HSV, CMV, adenovirus, influenza A, RSV, rubella, coronavirus, dengue, and parainfluenza [182,183]. fluorescent dyes may affect particle infectivity, which is of minor concern if virometry is used only to detect and measure virus particles. some super-resolution techniques rely on chemical fluorophores. other methods, like photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) and structured illumination microscopy (SIM) are compatible with FPs. fusing epitope tags to viral proteins can facilitate immunoaffinity purification. FPs have the distinct advantage of serving as both an epitope tag for immunoaffinity purification and a fluorescent probe for live-cell fluorescence microscopy. Flow virometry cell sorting was established over 50 years ago. fluorescent labeling has been used to reliably detect and quantify viruses like HSV, CMV, adenovirus, influenza A, RSV, rubella, coronavirus, dengue, and parainfluenza. fluorescent labeling has been used to reliably detect and quantify viruses like adenovirus, influenza A, poliovirus, rubella, coronavirus, dengue, and parainfluenza. new super-resolution fluorescence microscopy methods have been developed. this allows more precise localization and discrimination of delicate cellular structures. virologists have now begun to exploit the potential of super-resolution microscopy. view of the dynamic virus replication cycle."}
