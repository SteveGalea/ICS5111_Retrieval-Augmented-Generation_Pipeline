GHSA member countries that are not directly supported by the US government. the 2014\u20132016 west africa Ebola epidemic was the largest emergency response in CDC\u2019s history (6). CDC now trains and rosters a Global Rapid Response Team of >400 experts with a broad range of technical and language skills, poised to deploy on short notice and remain in the field for up to 6 months. in 2007\u20132016, CDC responded to >20 crises that each affected >10,000 people, each with a crude mortality rate of >1/10,000 persons/day. in response to the 2011\u20132012 Horn of Africa famine, CDC deployed staff for >380 missions in >40 countries to apply public health principles and epidemiologic science to mitigate health impacts of complex emergencies. in 2001\u20132016, CDC has responded to 62 public health emergency events. on 244 other occasions, components of PHEM were used to support responses not requiring full EOC activation. in 2009, PHEM began assisting MOHs with strengthening their emergency preparedness through IMS trainings, EOCs, and emergency response plan development. GHSA support substantively enhanced GDDOC\u2019s capacity to conduct event-based surveillance. CDC works with MOHs in 10 countries to host GDD Centers in a network supporting >90 countries.

CDC provides technical assistance to support country capacity assessments, the development of 5-year GHSA road maps, and annual GHSA implementation plans in Phase I, Phase II and CARICOM nations. CDC trains and rosters a Global Rapid Response Team of >400 experts with a broad range of technical and language skills. during this period, the Global Rapid Response Team responded to 13 emergencies in 25 countries, including Zika virus in the Americas (217 mobilizations, 9,494 person-days, 15 countries and territories, and EOC); yellow fever in angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (20 mobilizations and 1,097 person-days); and, most recently, Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic the number of persons affected by complex emergencies has increased over the past decade. in 2016 alone, >125 million persons needed humanitarian assistance (25). During 2007\u20132016, CDC responded to >20 crises that each affected >10,000 people. each with a crude mortality rate of >1/10,000 persons/day. GDDOC monitors 30\u201340 public health threats daily, tracking situations that could develop into public health emergencies of international concern. GDDOC conducted event-based surveillance and disseminated information on >1,500 outbreaks occurring in >190 countries. GDDOC is now a recognized world leader in PHEM. GDD Centers characterize public health threats through surveillance, applied research, and pathogen detection and discovery. in 2006\u20132016, GDD Centers conducted surveillance for key infectious diseases and syndromes; established >380 new diagnostic tests in national or local laboratories in 59 countries; assisted in the discovery and/or detection of 79 strains or pathogens new to the world, country, or region; and trained 115,566 professionals on public health topics. CDC supports country capacity assessments, 5-year roadmaps, and annual GHSA implementation plan development. 13 countries have expanded surveillance systems in humans, wildlife, and animals to foster prevention. ten countries have expanded surveillance systems to include more vaccine-preventable diseases, which should strengthen national vaccine delivery systems. CDC is helping develop a global workforce through the FETP-Advanced. the FETP-Advanced is modeled after CDC\u2019s 2-year Epidemic Intelligence Service. CDC supported 24 new FETP-Frontline programs, mentoring >1,860 participants. as of June 2017, CDC supports influenza activities in 79 countries. as of June 2017, CDC supports influenza activities in 79 countries. many countries are undertaking efforts to identify and prioritize zoonotic diseases of greatest national concern through a one health approach. this approach helps a country focus limited resources for surveillance, laboratory capacity building, outbreak response, and prevention and control efforts. acute febrile illness surveillance has contributed to countries\u2019 understanding of etiologies and pathogen-specific disease burden. a total of 2,010 STOP volunteers have been trained in surveillance principles to detect and respond to polio and other VPDs. a total of 2,010 STOP volunteers have deployed in 48 teams for 3\u20136-month assignments to 77 countries. STOP volunteers have played a crucial role in enhancing country capacity to respond to outbreaks of other priority infectious diseases. in the first year of the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic, >575,400 people succumbed worldwide (47) a severe influenza pandemic could cost as much as 4.9% of the world\u2019s gross domestic product (48) in 2015, the west africa Ebola epidemic cost Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone about $2.2 billion (49) CDC supports country capacity assessments, 5-year roadmaps, and annual GHSA implementation plan development. 13 countries have expanded surveillance systems in humans, wildlife, and animals to foster prevention. ten countries have expanded surveillance systems to include more vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) CDC is helping develop a global workforce through the FETP-Advanced, modeled after CDC\u2019s 2-year Epidemic Intelligence Service (11). in GHSA Phase I countries, >1,600 persons have completed FETP training. 2014\u20132016, CDC supported 24 new FETP-Frontline programs, mentoring >1,860 participants. as of June 2017, CDC supports influenza activities in 79 countries. as of June 2017, CDC supports influenza activities in 79 countries. many countries are undertaking efforts to identify and prioritize zoonotic diseases of greatest national concern through a one health approach. this approach helps a country focus limited resources for surveillance, laboratory capacity building, outbreak response, and prevention and control efforts. acute febrile illness surveillance has contributed to countries\u2019 understanding of etiologies and pathogen-specific disease burden. a total of 2,010 STOP volunteers have been trained in surveillance principles. they have deployed in 48 teams for 3\u20136-month assignments to 77 countries.
