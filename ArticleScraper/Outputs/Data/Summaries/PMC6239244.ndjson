{"summary": "public health informatics is the systematic application of information and computer sciences to public health practice, research, and learning. a new section on this specific topic has been integrated in the IMIA Yearbook in 2015. in parallel to precision medicine, it is concerned with providing the right intervention to the right population at the right time. the search was targeted at public health and epidemiology papers that involve computer science or the massive amount of web-generated data. 73 references were retained by at least one reviewer or classified as \u201cleave pending\u201d by both of them. best papers for the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics 2017 in the section \u2018Public Health and Epidemiology Informatics\u2019. the articles are listed in alphabetical order of the first author\u2019s surname. the work performed by Sharpe et al. is very well done and particularly interesting because it adds an unconventional source of information. besides web-based data, information extracted from cloud-based electronic health record databases can also be used for real-time surveillance of influenza-like illnesses. a paper about communication has been selected as one of this year's best paper. aims at identifying the features of Facebook posts associated with higher user engagement on Australian public health organizations\u2019 Facebook pages. authors define posts as likes, shares, or comments. research could assist in understanding whether engagement with public health-related pages on Facebook actually leads to the achievement of public health goals. research has shown that content providers must encourage engagement and adapt to the Facebook algorithm in order to maximize message exposure. sensitivity and positive predictive values (PPV) were calculated for Google flu Trends, Twitter, and Wikipedia. Wikipedia had the lowest sensitivity of 33% and lowest PPV of 40%. previous research found it to be least influenced by high media coverage. sensitivity and PPV were the best combination of sensitivity and PPV in detecting Bayesian change points in influenza-related data streams. findings demonstrated that change points in Google Flu Trends, Twitter, and Wikipedia data occasionally aligned well with change points captured in CDC data. a numerical weight was calculated for each risk factor using an analytical hierarchy process. the corresponding geographic data were collected, standardized, and combined based on a weighted linear combination. the accuracy of the resulting maps was assessed using RVF outbreak locations in livestock reported in Kenya and Tanzania between 1998 and 2012."}
