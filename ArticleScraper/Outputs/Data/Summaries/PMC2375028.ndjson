{"summary": "microarrays are particularly attractive for the recognition of pathogens in clinical material. current diagnostic assays are typically restricted to the detection of single targets by real-time PCR or immunological assays. many microarrays have already been produced with the aim of characterizing the spectrum of micro-organisms present in a sample. DetectiV uses simple and established methods for visualization, normalization and significance testing of pathogen detection microarray data. when applied to a second dataset, DetectiV produces the correct result in 12 out of 12 arrays tested. DetectiV is a powerful, open-source software package for statistical programming. the basic dataset required is a matrix of data, with rows representing probes on the array, and columns representing measurements from individual microarrays. limma [12] includes functions for reading in many common microarray scanner output formats, and affy [13] which provides functions for reading in affymetrix data. data are sorted into unique groups as defined by the unique values of group. a barplot is drawn, with one bar per unique probe. samples from the same group are drawn together. each group is represented by a unique background color. only oligos representing species from the Paramyxoviridae family are shown. oligos have been averaged over replicates and grouped according to virus species. each unique oligo is represented by a single bar. x j i is the value for probe i on array j and x c i is the value for probe i on control array/channel c. the median method calculates the global median value for each array. this method assumes that most probes will not hybridize to anything. the array platform for this data is GEO accession GPL1834. it includes over 11,000 oligos representing over 1,000 viral and bacterial species. both DetectiV and E-Predict have been used to analyze the data. the best performing method of interpreting the results was to take those species with a p value 0.05 and sort by distance (termed E-Predict.dist) this is the method used to demonstrate E-Predict's ability to detect SARS. analysis using DetectiV was carried out as described above. there are 56 arrays in the dataset, the expected results of which are known. DetectiV generated a correct result in 55 out of the 56 arrays. DetectiV full results for each of the arrays can be found on the DetectiV website [15]. the top hit from DetectiV is human papillomavirus type 18. the top hit from DetectiV is human papillomavirus type 18. the top hit from DetectiV is human rhinovirus sp., closely followed by human rhinovirus A, the expected result. the result for Enterobacteria phage M13 shows a higher mean normalized intensity than any of the rhinovirus groups. but in this case we cannot rely on the mean normalized intensity. human herpesvirus 5 has by far the smallest p value of any of the virus groups. the correct hit, respiratory syncytial virus, has the second smallest p value, but has a much larger mean normalized log ratio. this represents the final class of result seen by DetectiV, where the correct virus group does not have the smallest p value. top five hits for this array using the DetectiV method are shown in Table 4. both respiratory syncytial virus and respiratory syncytial virus have higher mean values than human herpesvirus 7. the latter has a smaller p value and a mean value that is above the cut-off of 1. incorrect E-Predict results GSM40809, GSM40821 and GSM40847. in all cases results are ordered by p value. this is a serotype not specifically targeted by the array. enterovirus D is having the smallest p value, and enterovirus Yanbian 96-83csf is having the largest similarity. there is no way of sorting or filtering the results such that human rhinovirus B becomes the top hit. hepatitis B and orangutan hepadnavirus are closely related. there is no clear way of distinguishing the incorrect virus from the correct one. there is also no consistent method of sorting or filtering the results that would give the correct results. top five hits from the analysis of the SARS dataset can be found in Table 6. top hit for Array RNA Mean GSM216542 Amplified RNA from cell cultured FMDV type O FMDO 1.51E-25 2.296645 GSM217164 Amplified RNA from cell cultured FMDV type O FMDO 1.07E-45 3.513068 GSM217167 Amplified RNA from cell cultured FMDV type O FMDO 2.36E-48 3.446262 GSM217169 Amplified RNA from cell cultured FM the top hit from DetectiV is human papillomavirus type 18 4.1E-10 6.8 human rhinovirus sp. 9.9E-12 4.1 Human herpesvirus 5 5.3E-16 0.57 Human endogenous retrovirus K115 0.000016 4 Human rhinovirus A 2.3E-09 5.7 Human rhinovirus sp. 5.9E-08 0.75. the top hit from DetectiV is human rhinovirus sp., closely followed by human rhinovirus A, the expected result. the result for Enterobacteria phage M13 shows a higher mean normalized intensity than any of the rhinovirus groups. this is representative of a class of result from DetectiV. human herpesvirus 5 has by far the smallest p value of any of the virus groups. the correct hit, respiratory syncytial virus, has the second smallest p value, but has a much larger mean normalized log ratio. this represents the final class of result seen by DetectiV, where the correct virus group does not have the smallest p value. both respiratory syncytial virus and respiratory syncytial virus have higher mean values than human herpesvirus 7. the latter has a smaller p value and a mean value that is above the cut-off of 1. the top hit would have been respiratory syncytial virus. incorrect E-Predict results GSM40809 GSM40821 GSM40847 Virus p value Similarity Human enterovirus D 0.000043 0.258894 Orangutan hepadnavirus 0.002291 0.148865 Human enterovirus B 0.000014 0.386095 Human rhinovirus B 0.000045 0.267815 Hepatitis B virus 0.002376 0.147182 Human echovirus 1 0.000022 0.414618 Entero the top five hits for this array all have similar p values and similarity measures. there is no way of sorting or filtering the results such that human rhinovirus B becomes the top hit. DetectiV is capable of calling the correct result in this instance. there is no clear way of distinguishing the incorrect virus from the correct one. there is also no consistent method of sorting or filtering the results that would give the correct results. top five hits from the analysis of the SARS dataset can be found in Table 6. top hit for the GSE8746 Array RNA Mean GSM216542 Amplified RNA from cell cultured FMDV type O FMDO 1.51E-25 2.296645 GSM217164 Amplified RNA from cell cultured FMDV type O FMDO 1.07E-45 3.513068 GSM217167 Amplified RNA from cell cultured FMDV type O FMDO 2.36E-48 3.446262 GSM217169 Amplified RNA oligos may not be unique to the species they are designed to. for certain species it is impossible to find a large number of oligos that are unique only to that virus that meet the criteria for oligo selection. this leads to noisy signals across multiple virus families, species and strains. DetectiV uses a pre-calculated energy matrix for each oligo on the array. it uses a variety of normalization and similarity metrics to calculate a p value and similarity for each virus. the advantages of the software are that it is quantitative, produces good results and is extensible through the extension of the energy matrix. DetectiV produced the correct result in 55 out of 56 arrays, by filtering for viruses with a mean normalized log ratio greater than 1 and then sorting by p value. a statistically significant result may be obtained by a group of oligos that display intensities only marginally larger than the negative control. but from a biological perspective, we would expect to see intensities far higher than the negative control. oligos designed to SARS were not present on the array. using a simple NCBI blast search, it was possible to extend the coverage of the array without adding further oligos. this suggests that it is possible to detect viruses without having any unique oligos. DetectiV is a highly accurate tool for the analysis of pathogen detection microarray data. it offers simple but powerful visualization, normalization and significance testing functions. DetectiV performs better than previously published software on a publicly available microarray dataset. some of the oligonucleotide probes were provided by Dr M Banks of Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA)."}
