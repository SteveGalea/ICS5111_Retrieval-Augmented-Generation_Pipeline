{"summary": "dsRNA and the synthetic dsRNA analog polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid (poly I:C) are also detected by different cytosolic DExD/H box RNA helicases. dsRNA and the synthetic dsRNA analog polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid (poly I:C) trigger indirectly the phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation type-I IFNs activate the Janus tyrosine kinase pathway. PKR is a serine\u2013threonine kinase that induces phosphorylation of translation initiation factor 2-alpha (eIF2) on serine 51 [19], [20], leading to protein synthesis shut-off and apop. PKR has been shown to participate in several important signaling cascades. several positive RNA-strand viruses have been shown to activate PKR. several PKR-deficient cells have reduced type-I IFN production in response to poly I:C. deficient mice for both PKR and RNAse L showed no increase in morbidity following SINV infection. however, increased viral loads in draining lymph nodes were observed. these observations support a non-redundant and cell specific role for these enzymes in the amplification of type-I IFN responses to viral infection more than in their initiation. cytosolic poly I:C detection in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) promotes a PKR-dependent mRNA translation arrest and an ISR-like response. CHIKV induces 100% lethality in 12-day-old GADD34-deficient MEFs. poly I:C-induced eIF2 phosphorylation was not observed in PKR-deficient MEFs. PKR is therefore necessary to induce protein synthesis inhibition in response to cytosolic poly I:C. protein synthesis was monitored in poly I:C(pI:C)-stimulated MEFs using puromycin labelling followed by immunoblot with the anti-puromycin mAb 12D10. -actin immunoblot is shown for equal loading control. a chase of 1 h with fresh media was performed prior to puromycin labeling. samples with chx and arsenite (as) added respectively 5 min and 30 min before puromycin pulse are shown as controls. data are mean standard deviation of 4 independent experiments. IFN-\u00df production in response to poly I:C is therefore likely to be specifically regulated. production occurs during cap-mediated translation inhibition, but does not directly depend on a specialized open reading frame organization. this suggests that although its production occurs during translation inhibition, it does not directly depend on a specialized open reading frame organization. nuclear HDAC1 immunoblot is shown for equal loading control. treatment with thapsigargin (th) was used as control to induce GADD34 and P-eIF2. ATF4/ MEFs showed higher basal levels of GADD34 mRNA than WT cells. however, in absence of ATF4, MEFs were unable to induce GADD34 mRNA transcription in response to any of the stimuli tested. GADD34 mediates eIF2 dephosphorylation but not global translation recovery in response to poly I:C. protein extracts of WT and GADD34C/C MEFs were immunobloted. no further decrease in protein synthesis was observed upon treatment of GADD34C/C cells with the dsRNA mimic. cytosolic dsRNA delivery induces a type of protein synthesis inhibition, which requires eIF2 phosphorylation for its initiation. however, cytosolic dsRNA delivery induces a type of protein synthesis inhibition. cysteine protease inhibitor Cystatin C was chosen as a model protein. it ensures a relative short intracellular residency time so that its intracellular levels directly reflect its synthesis rate [55] this is confirmed by the N-glycosylated- and total Cystatin C accumulation in cells treated with brefeldin A. the UPR-inducing drugs, Thapsigargin (th) and tunicamycin (tun), were used as controls to induce GADD34. the immunoblot of tubulin is shown as equal loading control. the absence of PKR up-regulation in the poly I:C-treated GADD34C/C MEFs led us to investigate the capacity of these cells to produce anti-viral and inflammatory cytokines. we ruled out interference from the UPR in triggering IFN-\u00df production in our experimental system. cytokines were secreted by WT and CReP/ cells, both absent in poly I:C-treated GADD34C/C MEFS. we could attribute the deficit in cytokine secretion of the GADD34C/C MEFs to a profound inability of these cells to synthesize cytokines, rather than a defect in transcription or general protein secretion. this continuous accumulation of PKR mRNA in response to poly I:C suggests the existence of alternative molecular mechanisms capable of promoting PKR mRNA transcription and stabilization independently of autocrine IFN- detection. recent results indicate that PKR participate to the production of IFN-/\u00df proteins in response to a subset of RNA viruses. mRNA pool requires GADD34 for translation during global protein synthesis shut-down triggered by dsRNA detection. GADD34 inactivation, and no other deficiency, was truly responsible for the loss of cytokine production by complementing GADD34C/C MEFs with cDNA prior poly I:C delivery. CHIKV was found to trigger eIF2 phosphorylation through PKR activation. this response is not required for the block of host protein synthesis. PKR was found to be necessary to control CHIKV infection in vitro. PKR is required to control type-I IFN production in MEFs. WT and PKR/ MEFs were infected for 24 h with CHIKV-GFP. eIF2 phosphorylation levels correlate with translation inhibition. culture supernatants monitored for presence of type-I IFN. only minimal CHIKV infection (15%) could be observed at maximum MOI in WT MEFs. robust IFN- amounts were already produced at the lowest MOI. guanabenz treatment resulted in a clear increase in eIF2 phosphorylation. chikV infection and IFN- production are controlled by GADD34. chikV infection and IFN- production are controlled by GADD34. NI stands for non-infected. percentage of infected cells, viral titers and IFN- measurements data represent mean standard deviation of 3 experiments. p values shown in (D) were obtained applying a Student's t test. a rate of 50% of mortality was observed 3 days after the infection of 9-day-old mice. 12-day-old pups were found essentially resistant to the virus lethal effect. all CHIKV infected GADD34C/C neonates died within 3\u20135 days post inoculation whatever their age. CHIKV infection causes severe myocardit. mouse neonates were infected with 106 PFU of CHIKV. normal appearance of heart of infected mice, at low magnification (A, 10) with normal cardiomyocytes (C, 100) and exceptional small foci of lymphocytes (E, 400). high magnification shows few residual cardiomyocytes (arrow head) and inflammation mainly composed of monocytes. poly I:C delivery to MEFs and NIH-3T3 rapidly and durably inhibited protein synthesis. a strong eIF2 phosphorylation was observed after 4 h of poly I:C treatment, followed by a steady dephosphorylation at later times. PKR is therefore necessary to induce protein synthesis inhibition in response to cytosolic poly I:C. -actin immunoblot is shown for equal loading control. Phosphorylation of eIF2 (P-eIF2) was assessed in same MEFs extracts. ELISA measured the amount of cytokine produced in NIH-3T3 cells at a time (7 h) at which translation was already strongly inhibited. close to 30% of the total IFN-\u00df produced over 8 h of poly I:C stimulation is achieved during this 1 h period. cap-mediated translation inhibition does not directly depend on a specialized open reading frame organization, as described for the translation of the mRNAs coding for the UPR transcription factor ATF4 or the SV 26S mRNA upon eIF2 phosphorylation [26], [49]. this hypothesis is also supported by the ability of MEFs expressing the non-phosphorylatable eIF2 Ser51 to Ala mutant (eIF2 A/A), to produce normal levels of IFN-\u00df the same analysis was performed in eIF2 A/A and control eIF2 S/S MEFs. treatment with thapsigargin (th) for 6 h was used as control to induce GADD34 and P-eIF2. eIF2 expressing MEFs were incapable of up-regulating GADD34 in response to poly I:C. eIF2 phosphorylation was rapidly increased in response to all ISR-inducing stimuli. eIF2 phosphorylation was greatly increased in GADD34C/C MEFs. poly I:C, protein extracts of WT and GADD34C/C MEFs were immunobloted for GADD34 and P-eIF2. controls are cells not treated with puromycin (co) and cells treated with cycloheximide (chx) 5 min before puromycin incorporation. tubulin or -actin immunoblot are shown for equal loading control. cytosolic dsRNA delivery induces a type of protein synthesis inhibition, which requires eIF2 phosphorylation for its initiation. but conversely cannot be reverted by GADD34 induction and subsequent GADD34-dependent eIF2 dephosphorylation. no major RNA degradation could be observed upon poly I:C delivery. thapsigargin treatment induced a brief drop in cystatin C levels. 6 hours of tunicamycin treatment affected more cystatin C accumulation than anticipated. GADD34 is required for cytokine production in poly I:C. Mock represent samples treated with lipofectamine alone. data are mean standard deviation of five (IFN-) and three (IL-6) independent experiments. IFN- production was quantified by ELISA, left panel, in cell culture supernatants. the absence of PKR up-regulation in the poly I:C-treated GADD34C/C MEFs led us to investigate the capacity of these cells to produce anti-viral and inflammatory cytokines. the absence of PKR up-regulation in the poly I:C-treated GADD34C/C MEFs led us to investigate the capacity of these cells to produce anti-viral and inflammatory cytokines. ADD34C/C MEFs remained constant in all conditions studied. we could not detect intracellular IFN- in poly I:C-stimulated GADD34C/C MEFs. thus, we could attribute the deficit in cytokine secretion of the cells to a profound inability of these cells to synthesize cytokines. recent results indicate that PKR participates to the production of IFN-/\u00df proteins in response to a subset of RNA viruses. a high proportion of mRNA transcripts lack their poly(A) tail [31] as GADD34 induction by poly I:C was completely PKR-dependent, we wondered whether the phenotypes observed in PKR/cells could be related. IFN-\u00df secretion was partially restored in transfected GADD34C/C cells. eIF2 was efficiently dephosphorylated in both WT and GADD34C/C transfected MEFs. guanabenz, a small molecule, selectively impairs GADD34-dependent eIF2 dephosphorylation. PKR was found to be necessary to control CHIKV infection in vitro. at least 60% of PKR\u2013inactivated cells were infected after 24 of viral exposure. PKR is required for normal IFN production by MEFs. infected cells were exposed to CHIKV-GFP (MOI of 10 or 50) for 24 and 48 h. only minimal CHIKV infection (15%) could be observed at maximum MOI in WT MEFs. a higher level of viral replication was observed in GADD34C/C MEFs. the cells showed a 50% infection rate after 24 h of infection (MOI 50) and a log more of virus titer in culture supernatants. this observation confirms the incapacity of GADD34-deficient cells to produce cytokines in response to cytosolic dsRNA. pharmacological and RNAi inhibition of GADD34 was found to increase the sensitivity of MEFs to infection. induction of GADD34 and its phosphatase activity during CHIKV infection participates to normal type-I IFN production and control of viral dissemination. CHIKV pathogenicity is strongly age-dependent in mice. in less than 12 day-old mouse neonates, CHIKV induces a severe disease accompanied with a high mortality rate. CHIKV pathogenicity is strongly age-dependent in mice. all CHIKV infected GADD34C/C neonates died within 3\u20135 days post inoculation whatever their age. infection was monitored 5 days post-inoculation of 12-day-old mice at. infected GADD34C/C tissues showed a considerably reduced IFN-\u00df production (40\u201350%) compared to control tissues. ADD34C/C mouse neonates 9-day-old (n = 11 per group) (upper panel) or 12-day-old (n = 14 per group) (lower panel) after intradermal inoculation with 106 PFU of CHIKV. mice were sacrificed 5 days after infection and the amount of infectious virus in serum and tissues quantified by TCID50. myocytes (C, 100) and exceptional small foci of lymphocytes (E, 400) infected mice were inoculated with 106 PFU of CHIKV. gene expression is therefore necessary to allow normal type-I interferon production during viral infection and to promote the survival of young infected animals. cytosolic poly I:C promotes eIF2 dephosphorylation. this is not sufficient to prevent global protein synthesis arrest. the 2-5A/RNAse L pathway does not seem to be sufficiently active. eIF2 phosphorylation mediated by PKR in response to poly I:C or viral infection could be circumvented through GADD34 activity solely at the ER level. this allows local cytokine production in absence of other functional protein synthesis. PKR, ATF4 and PKR are necessary to produce anti-viral cytokines during CHIKV infection. cytokines production could be directly linked to the efficiency of the cellular translation inhibition induced by RNA viruses. CHIKV cardiac tropism is not normally observed in WT mouse. inability of heart tissues to produce sufficient type-I IFN in GADD34C/C could allow abnormally high viral replication, myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy. the protocol was approved by the committee on the ethics of animal experiments. all experiments were performed under isoflurane anesthesia. 3T3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FCS (HyClone, PERBIO), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin. all cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. protein quantification was performed using the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce) 25\u201350 g of Triton X-100-soluble material was loaded on 2%\u201312% gradient or 8% SDS-PAGE before immunoblotting and chemiluminescence detection. anti-FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (30 min staining) were from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen) coverslips mounted on a slide and images taken with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) cDNA was synthesized using the superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers. amplification was carried out using complete SYBR Green PCR master mix and 200 nM of each specific primer. cDNA concentration in each sample were normalized by using HPRT. data were analyzed using the 7500 Fast System Appled Biosystems software.
