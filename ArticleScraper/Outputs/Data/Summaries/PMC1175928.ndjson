{"summary": "in the united states, this phenomenon is referred to as 'ambulances to nowhere' in the united states, this phenomenon is referred to as 'ambulances to nowhere' in the united states, this phenomenon is referred to as 'ambulances to nowhere' an analysis of the capacity of a 1200-bed hospital in the united states revealed an ability to handle only two chemically contaminated patients at a time [8] in many countries, because of efficiency and budgetary constraints, hospitals are shrinking in capacity. this has resulted in hospitals working at or near maximum capacity every day, with associated logistical concerns such as overcrowding, diversion of ambulance services and lack of surge capacity. education and training is the single most effective tool we can employ to mitigate the future effects of a disaster. the challenge is distilling all of this into a curriculum that fits the very limited time availability of healthcare professionals. a 'just-in-time training' program is less time intensive, less labor intensive, and less cost intensive than traditional educational processes. a rational approach to tackle this issue includes the development of flexible and scalable plans for interchanging resources to augment the existing capacity of individual hospitals. a significant volume of critical care is provided (nondeliberately) every day outside the geographical constraints of an ICU. a second example of ensuring patient safety in the hospital is emerging as a significant resource-consuming, but essential activity. a medical catastrophe may encompass a single patient who receives improper medication through to mass casualty circumstances. all involved organizations including hospitals, emergency medical services, fire services, police, the public health system, local municipalities and government authorities will need to integrate into a well-developed disaster educational system and response team [23]"}
