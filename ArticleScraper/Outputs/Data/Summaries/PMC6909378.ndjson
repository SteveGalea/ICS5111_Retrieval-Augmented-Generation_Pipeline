{"summary": "the global outburst of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection in 2003 inspired our exploration of how a viral infection can activate a massive over-production of cytokines by the host immune system. this results in a severe inflammatory reaction and increases systemic vascular permeability within 2\u20135 days following viral exposure. innate immune responses contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of acute viral infections. clinical symptoms range from mild fever to severe inflammation and increased endothelial permeability in major organs. acute viral infections typically occur in response to enveloped viruses, such as dengue virus (flaviviridae), chikungunya virus (togaviridae), influenza virus (orthomyxoviridae), measles virus (paramyxoviridae), rabies virus (rhabdoviridae), hanta virus ( platelet-leukocyte interactions regulate inflammatory reactions. molecular mechanisms underlying platelet-mediated immunomodulation are still unclear. human immune system has evolved to provide protection against a diversity of microorganisms, including viral infections. several TLR agonists and antagonists are promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of sepsis, asthma, vaccine adjuvants, and autoimmunity. the cell surface TLRs (TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5) are activated by diverse PAMPs and DAMPs. the endosomal TLRs (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9) recognize pathogen-derived nucleic acids and, in the context of therapeutic approaches, synthetic nucle viral DNA stimulate IFN production via TLR9 and intracellular DNA sensors such as STING (stimulator of IFN genes), MPYS (methionine-proline-tyrosineserine), or ERIS (ER IFN stimulator) TLRs are central to the control of innate immune responses through the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (9) activated MyD88 triggers two signaling pathways: the TRAF3-TBK1-IKK-IRF3/IRF7 pathway to induce type I interferon expression. TRIF primarily triggers the TRAF3-TBK1-IKK-IRF3/IRF7 pathway to upregulate type I interferon production. plasmic domains capable of transducing signals have been reported to play critical roles in host immunity against fungal and non-microbial infections. lectin receptors L-SIGN/CD299 (expressed in liver sinusoid cells), DC-SIGN/CD209 and mannose receptor/CD206 (expressed in macrophages/dendritic cells) are the major targets of DV in humans. all the Syk-coupled C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) belong to group II or group V of the CTLD superfamily. CLEC5A is abundantly expressed in myeloid lineages, including neutrophil, monocyte, macrophage, osteoclast, microglia, and dendritic cells. CLEC5A is responsible for DV-induced hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), which represent the most severe responses to DV infection. blockade of DV-CLEC5A interaction by anti-CLEC5A monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) effectively alleviating plasma leakage and systemic hemorrhaging, thus protect mice from DV-induced shock and lethality. blockade of CLEC5A inhibits DV-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and cell death. osteoclasts are highly susceptible to DV infection, which induces the production of cytokines and infectious virions. clec5a/stat1/ mice are resistant to DV-induced osteolysis. anti-CLEC5A mAb can penetrate BBB and attenuates JEV-induced neuronal inflammation in brain. anti-CLEC5A mAb-mediated immunomodulation does not inhibit host immunity to JEV. all surviving mice produce high titer of JEV neutralization Ab (both IgM and IgG) influenza virus activates CLEC5A to enhance inflammatory reactions and cause severe tissue damage. combination of current anti-viral drugs with anti-CLEC5A mAb will provide better effects to reduce tissue damage and lethality. CLEC2 have been shown to capture human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) via DC-SIGN and CLEC-2, thereby facilitate viral dissemination in infected patients. it has been reported that the absence of CLEC2 increases clinical severity in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis following injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (47) blockade of CLEC5A offers 30% protection rate. simultaneous blockade of CLEC5A and TLR2 further increase mice survival rate up to 90%. targeting CLEC5A/TLR2 have potential to underpin novel strategies for treating acute viral infections. DV-induced activation of CLEC5A is dependent on DC-SIGN and MR (53). engagement of DV with myeloid cells triggers colocalization of CLEC5A and MR/DC-SIGN to form a hetero-multivalent complex (53) lectin heterocomplex would facilitate the formation of multivalence interactions between viral glycans and C-type lectins. lectin receptors L-SIGN/CD299 (expressed in liver sinusoid cells), DC-SIGN/CD209 and mannose receptor/CD206 (expressed in macrophages/dendritic cells) have been shown to be crucial for DV entry into these cell types. dengue is a mosquito-borne virus and it is interesting to note that DV generated in mosquito cells infects human cells via DC-SIGN. CLEC5A is abundantly expressed in myeloid lineages, including neutrophil, monocyte, macrophage, osteoclast, microglia, and dendritic cells. CLEC5A is an N-linked homodimeric glycoprotein expressed on cell surface (28) CLEC5A is responsible for DV-induced hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), which represent the most severe responses to DV infection. blockade of DV-CLEC5A interaction by anti-CLEC5A monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) effectively alleviating plasma leakage and systemic hemorrhaging. blockade of CLEC5A inhibits DV-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. osteoclasts are highly susceptible to DV infection, which induces the production of cytokines and infectious virions. clec5a/stat1/ mice are resistant to DV-induced osteolysis. anti-CLEC5A mAb-mediated immunomodulation does not inhibit host immunity to JEV. all surviving mice produce high titer of JEV neutralization Ab (both IgM and IgG) and develop protective cellular immunity against JEV infection. CLEC2 is highly expressed by platelets and megakaryocytes. low level expression of this Syk-coupled CLR has also been reported in mouse dendritic cells (32) and neutrophils (33) CLEC2 have been shown to capture human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) via DC-SIGN and CLEC-2, thereby facilitate viral dissemination in infected patients (44, 46). it has been reported that the absence of CLEC2 increases clinical severity in a cecal ligation and puncture model of sepsis following injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (47), and deletion of CLEC2 in this model exacerbates cytokine storm. blockade of CLEC5A and TLR2 increases mice survival rate up to 90%. this is not critical DV-induced pathogenesis, but also plays important roles in platelet-leukocyte interactions via recognizing platelets-derived EXOs and MVs. pathogens carry multiple PAMPs and activate immune cells via multiple receptors. DV-induced activation of CLEC5A is dependent on DC-SIGN and MR. engagement of DV with myeloid cells triggers colocalization of CLEC5A and MR/DC-SIGN to form a hetero-multivalent complex (53) lectin heterocomplex would facilitate the formation of multivalence interactions between viral glycans and C-type lectins with distinct glycan-binding affinity. CLEC5A binds lipoteichoic acid from the L. monocytogenes cell wall. CLEC5A binds to GlcNAc-MurNAc disaccharides within the backbone of bacterial wall teichoic acids (51) coactivation of CLEC5A and TLR2 by L. monocytogenes stimulates the production of inflammasomes and induces NET formation. bloackade of CLEC5A/TLR2 may reduce bacteria-induced systemic permeability change, inhibit tumor metastasis, and attenuate tissue damages during aseptic inflammation. Activation of CLEC5A/TLR2 heterocomplexes promotes formation of inflammasomes (NALP3, NLRC4, AIM-2) and induces inflammatory cytokine release via activation of CLEC5A and CLEC2. viruses infect multiple cell linages, including both immune and non-immune cells, and induce cell-cell interactions during acute viral infections. the ability of DV-EVs to enhance inflammatory reactions and NETosis suggest that activated EVs can be considered novel \u201cendogenous danger signals\u201d or \u201cdamage-associated molecular patterns\u201d. HBV is an enveloped DNA virus that infects hepatocytes. the envelope contains large, middle, and small HBV surface antigens. the large HBsAg is present on virions that contain the viral genome. this is not the case for the middle and small HBsAgs."}
