{"summary": "the role of the bat innate immune system in controlling viral replication remains poorly understood. identifying mechanisms responsible for controlling viral replication in bats has profound implications for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting viral infections in humans. the tissue distribution of human IRF7 is restricted to immune tissues which contain large numbers of specialized immune cells including spleen, thymus and peripheral blood lymphocytes. non-immune tissues including the intestine and colon express almost undetectable levels of IRF7. TLR3 and TLR4 activate IRF7 through the adaptor molecule TRIF. phosphorylated IRF7 forms a homodimer or heterodimer with IRF3. phosphorylated IRF7 translocates to the nucleus where it binds to the IFN promoter via its DNA-binding domain. x1 and OAS1 appear to be conserved in sequence compared to other mammals [29],[30],[31]. but bats appear to have relatively higher expression of type III IFN and wider distribution of type III IFN receptors consistent with a role for type III IFNs in antiviral immunity. all cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. Viruses Sendai virus (SeV, Cantell strain) was prepared in chicken embryos as described previously [29]. maps were drawn using Fancy Gene v1.4 by comparing individual IRF7 ORFs of P. alecto, horse and human. PCR products corresponding to full-length IRF3 and IRF7 were ligated directly to Vivid Colors pcDNA 6.2/EmGFP TOPO vector. ORF amplification IRF7-1R CTAGGCGGGCTGCTCC Full-length ORF amplification IRF7-1R CGACCCGCATAAAGTGTATGCTTC Real-time PCR. mouse IFN-4, IFN- 6 and human IFN- promoter plasmids, abbreviated as mu_IFN- 4P, -6P and Hu_IFN- P respectively, have been described previously [21] promoter prediction was performed using the online transcriptional start site prediction tool. regions containing putative IRF3 or IRF7 binding sites were identified from 221 to 70 bp from the ATG of the bat IFN- gene by comparison with human IFN promoters. iRF7 qRT-PCR primers were designed using Primer Express 3.0 (Applied Biosystems) with default parameter settings. information of the four siIRF7 can be found in Table 1. 15 diluted cDNA samples were used with a final concentration of 200 nmol of each primer. the cycling profile consisted of an initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 minutes followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 1 minute, followed by melt curve analysis. expression levels of target genes were calculated using the standard curve method after normalisation to the housekeeping gene 18s rRNA. T cells were seeded 24 h prior to co-transfection with 1.25 g of both FLAG-MyD88 and GFP-IRF7 (human or bat) using Fugene 6 (Promega) cells were then lysed 24 h later with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris (pH7.4), 1.0% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM Na3VO4, 10 human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS (Hyclone), 15 mM L-glutamine, 100 g/ml penicillin and 50 g/ml gentamycin (Sigma) all cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. the sequence has been submitted to GenBank under accession number KJ534586. overlapping PCR was performed to generate a truncated bat IRF7 (tIRF7) that lacked the MyD88 binding region at amino acids 234\u2013298, overlapping PCR was performed. PCR product was ligated to the pcDNA 6.2/EmGFP TOPO vector. the human IRF7 (hu-IRF7) is in the pEGFP-N1 vector and hu-MyD88 is in the pEF-Bos vector with an N-terminal FLAG tag. the bat IFN- promoter plasmid was constructed using sequence 1000 bp upstream from the start codon of IFN- ORF from the P. alecto genome. regions containing putative IRF3 or IRF7 binding sites were identified from 221 to 70 bp from the ATG of the bat IFN- gene by comparison with human IFN promoters. cells were harvested 30 h post-transfection and lysed using passive lysis buffer. similar transfections were performed using lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) IRF7 qRT-PCR primers were designed using Primer Express 3.0 (Applied Biosystems) with default parameter settings. qRT-PCR primers were designed using Primer Express 3.0. 2106 HEK293T cells were seeded 24 h prior to co-transfection with 1.25 g of both FLAG-MyD88 and GFP-IRF7 (human or bat) using Fugene 6 (Promega) cells were then lysed 24 h later with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris (pH7.4), 1.0% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 all IRF members from IRF1 to IRF9 were identified in the bat genome. the sequence similarity of the deduced protein sequence of human and bat IRFs showed significant conservation of IRF1 (96%), IRF3 (88%) and IRF5 (87%). nine exons were also identified in IRF7 genes from other Laurasiatheria species. of the sequences available in the Ensembl database, the ten exon structure appears to be typical only among primate IRF7 genes. the ten exon structure appears to be typical only among primate IRF7 genes. bat IRF7 promoter region around 1000 bp upstream of the start site of the ORF resulted in the identification of two IFN stimulated response elements (ISREs) and one nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) binding site. all species examined contain two ISRE sites (one ISRE and one IRF binding site) with the exception of human which has a single ISRE. both bats are less conserved to human but also to other Laurasiatheria species. alignment was performed between bat MyD88 and MyD88 from human, mouse, pig, cow and horse. no significant change that would potentially alter the functionality of bat MyD88 was identified based on sequence analysis. cell lines were either treated with polyI:C or mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 (transfection) with polyI:C. the data were normalized against the 18s rRNA gene. the cloned and immortalized bat lung cell line has previously been demonstrated to produce IFN in response to polyI:C in a dose dependent manner. the luciferase reporter vector was ligated to the pGL4.1 luciferase reporter vector. it contains one residue difference in its PRDI which may abolish its ability to bind to IRF3 or IRF7. the second PRD (PRDIII) is almost identical to the corresponding domain of the human IFN- promoter region. 24 h post-transfection, cells were transfected with 100 ng pCAGGS-bat IRF7) followed by promoter activation assay six hours after infection. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with 0, 1, 10, 100 or 500 ng of expression plasmids for either bat or human IRF7-GFP. cells transfected with mock or empty vector failed to activate the IFN promoters significantly. the results are not statistically comparable due to the difference in IRF7 protein expression from the two plasmids. Knockdown of IRF7 impaired the induction of IFN- by SeV by 2.5 fold relative to untransfected cells. a dose of 10 moi was used to infect siIRF7-transfected cells one day after siIRF7 transfection. bat IRF7 significantly reduced IFN- mRNA induction by SeV. cells were transfected with 20 nM siIRF7 for 24 h followed by infection with SeV for a further 6 h. results represent the mean of triplicate samples. or 100 ng of IRF7 was co-transfected with myD88 for the IFN-4P and IFN-6P promoter assay respectively in HEK293T cells. the activation of IFN-4P by both human and bat IRF7 was increased by co-transfection with myD88. some differences were observed between IFN-4 and IFN-6 inducibility. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged MyD88 (either human or bat, as indicated) and GFP-tagged IRF7 (human or bat, as indicated) cell lysed and protein immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody conjugated beads followed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG or anti-human IRF7 antibody. antibodies were analysed by immunoblot for IRF7 and MyD88 expression. whole cell lysate (10 ul) was run on an SDS-PAGE gel. whole cell lysate (10 ul) was also analysed for IRF7 expression. human IRF7 and human IRF7 colocalised in a manner similar to previous studies. no aggregated structure was observed following co-expression of bat MyD88 with bat IRF3. the poorly conserved MyD88-binding region retains a similar function to human domain. bat IRF7 or bat tIRF7 plasmid was transfected with or without bat MyD88 expression plasmid. luciferase activity was tested 30 h post-transfection. all IRF members from IRF1 to IRF9 were identified in the bat genome. full-length IRF7 by PCR from bat spleen cDNA was identified. we were able to determine the intron and exon structure of this gene. nine exons were also identified in IRF7 genes from other Laurasiatheria species. RF7 with IRF7 from human, mouse, cow, pig, horse and M. davidii using a 20 amino acid sliding window and created using EMBOSS Plotcon. the lower the score the lower the sequence conservation. the least conserved region is boxed. IRF7 is widely expressed among all bat organs at the mRNA level. spleen, small intestine and lung had the highest IRF7 expression. spleen, small intestine and lung had the highest IRF7 expression. qRT-PCR detection of bat IRF7 (A) mRNA expression in P. alecto tissues. data were normalized with the housekeeping gene 18s rRNA. mRNA was induced at the earliest time point of 3 h following stimulation. a bat IFN- promoter assay was used to test the ability of IRF7 to induce IFN- production. the putative promoter region of the bat IFN- gene was examined and predicted to contain IRF7 and IRF3 binding modules. the second PRD (PRDIII) is almost identical to the corresponding domain of the human IFN- promoter region. IFN- is induced in a dose-dependent manner by bat IRF7. sendai virus (SeV) induced higher IFN- induction with increasing dose of bat IRF7. cells were cotransfected with 0, 10, 50 or 100 ng pCAGGS-bat IRF7. this response was tested using mouse IFN-4, mouse IFN-6 or human IFN- promoter plasmids in HEK293T cells. the results demonstrate that bat IRF7 is capable of activating IFN in bat cells following stimulation with SeV or in human cells co-transfected with mock or empty vector. knockdown of IRF7 impaired the induction of IFN- by seV by 2.5 fold relative to untransfected cells. a dose of 10 moi was used to infect paKiT03 cells one day after siIRF7 transfection (or mock transfection) siRNA knockdown of bat IRF7 reduces IFN production. cells were transfected with 20 nM siIRF7 for 24 h. mRNA was compared with IRF3 which served as an indication of off-target effects. the transactivation activity of bat IRF7 was compared to that of human IRF7. in mice, IFN-4 is the earliest IFN-induced by viral infection. a dose of 10 ng or 100 ng of IRF7 was co-transfected with myD88. a similar experiment was performed to confirm that bat IRF3 is MyD88 independent. HEK293T cells were transiently co-transfected with bat MyD88 expression plasmid and mouse IFN-4 (A) or IFN-6 (B) promoter plasmid along with human IRF7, bat IRF7. cells were analysed for promoter activity by reporter gene luciferase assay. 88 protein is capable of binding both bat and human IRF7 proteins. HEK293T cells were transfected with GFP-tagged IRF7 and FLAG-tagged MyD88 (human or bat, as indicated) whole cell lysate was prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody M2 for detection of FLAG tagged MyD88. a dose of 200 ng/well of either human or bat MyD88 and IRF7 plasmids was used to transfect cells grown overnight on coverslips in 24-well plates. sixteen hours later, cells were fixed and stained with anti-human MyD88 antibody and examined under the confocal microscope. human MyD88 and IRF7 proteins also showed clear co-localisation. tIRF7 was unable to activate the mouse IFN promoter, even in the presence of MyD88. this is consistent with functional conservation of the region corresponding to aa 233\u2013298 in bats with that of human IRF7. the results provide the first functional characterization of IRF7 in any species of bat. they provide evidence of a wider tissue distribution which has implications for broader activation of the IFN response in bats. at least five species of fish express IRF7 constitutively in a wide variety of tissue types. induction of IRF7 by treatment or transfection of our bat kidney cell line with the dsRNA ligand resulted in a peak in the induction of IRF7 at 9 h post-treatment. this result is consistent with the induction of IRF7 through type I IFN feedback similar to other species. the human IRF7 promoter region contains an NF-B binding site and a single functional ISRE approximately 1.3-kb upstream from the ATG start site. sequence differences in the MyD88 binding domain of bat and human IRF7 led to the hypothesis that there may be functional differences in the activation of bat IRF7. the levels of transactivation were equivalent to or higher than that of human IRF7. experimental data demonstrate that bat IRF7 is capable of inducing IFN and MyD88 binding in a similar manner to human IRF7. analysis of the bat IFN- promoter also revealed one residue difference in the PRDI module. a similar change in the human IFN-P impairs its inducibility by IRFs. future work focusing on IFN promoters (including IFN- and IFN-) will be necessary to explore whether the bat IRF-IFN pathway is as critical to IFN induction as it is in other species. etic analysis based on amino acid alignment of IRF7 from representative vertebrate species. branch support indicated as the percentage of 1000 bootstrap replicates. sequences are from the Ensembl database with the exception of P. alecto IRF7. I, responsible for binding to IRF3 and IRF7 in humans are boxed. residue in the P. alecto IFN- promoter which may have disabled PRDI has also been highlighted."}
