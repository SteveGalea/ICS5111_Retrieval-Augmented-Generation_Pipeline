{"summary": "the current EBOV outbreak is already proving remarkably costly in terms of mortality and financial ramifications 1, 2. the best approaches to EBOV so far have relied on public health measures for containment 3 which have been used in past outbreaks 4. several studies have identified non-FDA approved drugs including an in silico docking approach to identify molecules targeting the viral protein VP35 protein 15. 5.4 million drug-like compounds docked in the viral protein VP35 protein 15. this identified multiple pyrrolidinones which inhibit its polymerase cofactor activity 15. in both cases over 300 hits were retrieved initially. the van der Waals surface of amodiaquine was added to limit the number of hits retrieved 17\u201319. pharmacophores were constructed using the receptor-ligand pharmacophore generation protocol. amodiaquine and chloroquine in one study 8, clomiphene and toremifene in another 9. These active molecules were used as they have both in vitro and in vivo activity to build a common features pharmacophore. the pharmacophore was then used to search various databases (for which up to 100 molecule conformations with the FAST conformer generation method with the maximum energy threshold of 20 kcal/mol, were created) the protocol included 10 hotspots and docking tolerance (0.25) the ligand VPL57 was removed from the binding site and re-docked. the four FDA approved drugs with activity against the Ebola virus were docked in the structure. the original complete sets of FDA approved compounds screened are not publically accessible it is difficult to compare hit rates versus all compounds tested to date. EBOV VP35 generated from crystal structures in the protein data bank PDB. ligand mapped 4IBB 4H, 1HBD, 1 neg ionizable 4IBD 4H, 1HBA, 1 neg ionizable 4IBD 4H, 1HBA, 1 neg ionizable 4IBD 4H, 1HBA, 1 neg ionizable 4IBJ 4H, 1HBA, 1 neg ionizable 4IBJ 4H, 1HBA, 1 neg ionizable 4IBJ the pharmacophore was generated using the in vivo and in vitro active amodiaquine, chloroquine, clomiphene and toremifene. the pharmacophore was generated using the in vivo and in vitro active amodiaquine, chloroquine, clomiphene and toremifene. pharmacophore features are Hydrophobic (H, cyan) and Hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA, green) the nine receptor-ligand pharmacophores created all consisted of three to four hydrophobic features and one to two hydrogen bonding features. eight of these pharmacophores also had a negative ionizable feature. neg ionizable 4IBG 3H, 2 HBA, 1 neg ionizable 4IBJ 4H, 1HBA, 1 neg ionizable 4IBK 4H, 1HBA, 1 neg ionizable 4IBK 4H, 1HBA, 1 neg ionizable 4IBK 4H, 1HBA, 1 neg ionizable 4IBK 4H, 1HBA, 1 neg ionizable 4IBI LibDock score 90.80, B. Chloroquine (grey) LibDock score 97.82, C. Clomiphene (grey) and 4IBI LibDock score 69.77, D. Toremifene (grey) and 4IBI LibDock score 68.11 Discussion Our previous experience with common feature and quantitative pharmacophore models has demonstrated their value in predicting novel actives from collections of FDA approved drugs based pharmacophore (derived from four FDA approved drugs that inhibit EBOV) both types of model had multiple hydrophobic features and at least one hydrogen bond acceptor. VP35 may be a potential target for these two distinct classes of compounds. however, it is important to point out that we have not compared docking to other proteins in EBOV. VP35 may be the likely target based on overlap of receptor-based pharmacophores and docking into the crystal structure. amodiaquine and chloroquine score particularly well in terms of docking to VP35. docking FDA approved drugs could also be a viable first step to identifying potential compounds that could be used. the database was searched with the common feature pharmacophore developed from amodiaquine, chloroquine, clomiphene and toremifene. the search 3D database protocol was used with the Fast search method. in some cases the indication for the molecules is not described (ND). the compounds bind in the first basic patch of the interferon inhibitory domain which is important for the viral nucleoprotein interaction and replication complex formation 15."}
