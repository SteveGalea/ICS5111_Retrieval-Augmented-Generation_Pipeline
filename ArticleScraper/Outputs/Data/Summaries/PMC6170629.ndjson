{"summary": "the pathophysiology of sepsis is not fully understood. Sepsis should be defined as \"life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection\" septic shock is defined as a subset of sepsis in which profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. siRS criteria (6) have been shown to lack specificity and perform poorly in identifying children at high risk of mortality from infection (7\u20139) some evidence suggests it may be useful to apply the Sepsis-3 definition to paediatric populations (8, 10\u201312), but generally clinicians would not regard them as \u201cseptic\u201d. large-scale epidemiological studies on sepsis were based on Sepsis-2 criteria. sepsis is similar to the definition of sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 criteria (1). incidence and severity of sepsis are climbing over time, whereas sepsis-associated mortality is declining (16\u201319) low-income countries represent 87% of the world's population (17) and bear a huge burden of infectious diseases and sepsis (20). lack of a universal and specific sepsis definition leads to substantial heterogeneity in case definitions among studies. most epidemiological studies on sepsis either excluded cases of viral origin or did not specify the proportion of viral sepsis. bacterial sepsis (e.g., influenza and staphylococcal sepsis) (25), coinfection of unknown significance (e.g., rhinovirus), prolonged or persistent shedding of a previous infection (e.g., adenovirus) (26), an \u201cinnocent\u201d latent infection (e.g., Epstein-Barr virus) or a false positive result. a previously well child with purulent meningitis and rhinovirus in definition of viral sepsis Sepsis is a complex syndrome of physiological and pathological abnormalities resulting from infection. pathophysiology of sepsis is not fully understood, making it difficult to give an unambiguous and comprehensive definition of sepsis. Sepsis should be defined as \"life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection\" the current consensus definition of paediatric sepsis was still built on the SIRS criteria (6). it has been shown to lack specificity and perform poorly in identifying children at high risk of mortality from infection (7\u20139). some evidence suggests it may be useful to apply the Sepsis-3 definition to paediatric populations (8, 10\u201312) psis should always be considered in septic patients lacking evidence of bacterial, parasitic or fungal infection. psis should always be considered in septic patients lacking evidence of bacterial, parasitic or fungal infection, and laboratory tests for viruses should be arranged accordingly. both studies (5, 17) indicated limitations about epidemiological surveys on sepsis. the lack of a universal and specific sepsis definition leads to substantial heterogeneity in case definitions among studies. most epidemiological studies on sepsis either excluded cases of viral origin or did not specify the proportion of viral sepsis. the identified viruses could be the single causative agent of sepsis (e.g., dengue), a contributor to secondary bacterial sepsis (e.g., influenza and staphylococcal sepsis) (25), coinfection of unknown significance (e.g., rhinovirus), prolonged or persistent shedding of a previous infection (e.g., adenovirus) (26), an \u201cinnocent\u201d latent infection (e.g., Epstein the world health organization and the world health Assembly have listed sepsis as one of the global health priorities for the following years. they recognized the importance of understanding the epidemiological burden of sepsis. aetiology of viral sepsis Almost any virus can cause viral sepsis in susceptible populations (24) ated HSV disease and fulminant HSV hepatitis have a clinical presentation of viral sepsis. hepatic dysfunction, respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and haemodynamic instability are difficult to differentiate clinically from sepsis caused by other pathogens. studies have reported various incidence rates of neonatal HSV infection, ranging from 8 to 60 per 100,000 live births. enteroviruses that have the highest association with sepsis are coxsackievirus and echovirus (47); these viruses primarily cause sepsis in neonates (47) enterovirus A71 can lead to viral sepsis in children beyond the neonatal period (48, 49), predominantly in children younger than 2 years of age (50) white matter abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging have been found in cases of HPeV encephalitis, which may play a role in the development of sequelae (53\u201355). clinical presentations of HPeV infections are similar to those of enteroviral infections, are clinically indistinguishable and require serology or PCR to discriminate between them. seasonal influenza epidemics account for an estimated 290,000\u2013650,000 respiratory deaths annually, with 10,000\u2013110,000 occurring among children younger than 5 years of age. the true mortality attributable to influenza viruses must be higher because the figures do not include deaths from other causes, such as circulatory deaths (59), which also make up a large proportion of influenza virus-associated deaths (60). dengue viruses dengue is a common viral infection in tropical countries. over 50% of the world's population live in areas where dengue infection occurs. chikungunya virus (84), hantavirus (85), coronaviruses (86), Ebola virus (87), and Lassa virus (88) are also major contributors to viral sepsis across the globe. 15% of young infants (90 days of age) with sepsisa and without signs of localised infection HPeV3 infection (compared with other types of HPeV) a Sepsis was defined according to age-specific criteria, Rochester criteria and Yale observation scale. in neonates, HSV can cause three types of disease: skin, eye and mouth disease, encephalitis, and disseminated disease. disseminated HSV disease is the most severe form of HSV infection. patients with lethargy, severe hepatic dysfunction or delayed treatment have higher mortality. neonates born to mothers with newly-acquired genital HSV infection near term are at greater risk for neonatal HSV infection than those born to mothers with reactivated genital HSV infection. human enteroviruses Enterovirus is a genus of viruses of the family Picornaviridae, which have been shown to cause sepsis in immunodeficient and paediatric populations. antibodies against HPeVs are present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of up to 99% of the population (52), with HPeV type 3 (HPeV3) (the most common cause of HPeV sepsis) being present in 10% of the population studied in the Netherlands. HPeV is found in 0.4\u20138.2% of neonates presenting with sepsis. it is therefore likely that viral sepsis caused by HPeVs is frequently underdiagnosed. seasonal influenza epidemics account for an estimated 290,000\u2013650,000 respiratory deaths annually, with 10,000\u2013110,000 occurring among children younger than 5 years of age. the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection depends on viral virulence and host responses (63) HAs of different strains of influenza viruses have varied tropism for the airway epithelium. HAs of different strains of influenza viruses bind preferentially to the epithelium in the upper airway and bronchi. all serotypes of dengue viruses have been implicated in severe dengue (68) one study in Thailand found that 14% of patients diagnosed with sepsis tested positive for dengue viruses upon re-analysis of banked serum samples by PCR. it was suggested that it may prove beneficial to increase testing for dengue viruses in patients presenting with sepsis to ensure the patient receive appropriate treatment (71). ly-acquired maternal genital infection near term HSV-2 infection (compared with HSV-1 infection) 37% of young infants (90 days of age) with sepsisa and without signs of localised infection HPeV3 infection (compared with other types of HPeV) 1 million cases of severe respiratory infections in children 5 years of age worldwide annually. adenovirus serotypes 3 and 7 (80\u201383) a Sepsis was defined according to age-specific criteria, Rochester criteria and Yale observation scale. c Sepsis was defined by the Sepsis-2 definition. studies have shown that neonates can experience highly exaggerated inflammatory responses through some pathways, such as the TLR2 pathway, in response to specific antigens (95, 96). these exaggerated responses may play a role in the development of sepsis in response to viral infections. maternal sepsis is around 41\u201349 per 100,000 pregnancies. the maternal immune system is complicated and delicately modulated. it is efficient at identifying and defending against invading pathogens to protect the mother and the foetus. status with high levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF- is seen in pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy. pregnant women develop a more anti-inflammatory (TH2-biased) status with increased levels of prostaglandin E2, IL-4, and IL-10 while the foetus grows rapidly. the immune system shifts back to a pro-inflammatory (TH1-biased) status, which helps parturition. the global population of older adults is set to overtake the \u201cyoung\u201d population by 2050. many factors involved in the increased susceptibility to sepsis also increase the susceptibility to viral infection, and thus viral sepsis. comorbidities for sepsis and severe viral infection such as diabetes mellitus (116), renal failure (117, 118), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (117, 119), heart conditions (120), and obesity (120, 12 cytoablative chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies and immunomodulatory agents for neoplastic and autoimmune diseases, the epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and increasing numbers of haematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) and solid organ transplants (SOT). infection and sepsis continue to be the major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed hosts (91, 135) primary immunodeficiency is another special category of diseases affecting more than six million people worldwide. young children with inborn errors in signalling pathways upstream of the production of type I IFNs are at higher risk of developing life-threatening viral infection. neonatal monocytes and antigen-presenting cells display exaggerated inflammatory responses through some pathways. these exaggerated responses may play a role in the development of sepsis. neonatal dendritic cells have reduced production of TNF and type I IFNs. low levels of neutrophils in stress situations, such as sepsis, are seen in neonates. the nave, immature adaptive immunity of neonates, increases susceptibility to various pathogens and severity of infection (94) 100,000 pregnancies with a mortality rate of 1.8\u20134.5% in the united kingdom (105) and the united states (107) the maternal immune system is complicated and delicately modulated. it is tolerant to paternal antigens and the \u201callogeneic\u201d foetus. older adults are a population at a significantly greater risk of sepsis from all causes than the general population (113). a subclinical viral infection of the placenta can affect the maternal immune system and increase the maternal susceptibility to various pathogens, including viruses (112). older adults experience persistent T cell exhaustion in part due to constant low-level inflammation. this process is characterised by elevated baseline levels of the cytokines IL-6, IL-1, and TNF- (130, 132) the prolonged length of inflammatory states after infections can result in decreased ability to effectively respond to infection. the authors did not specify the mortality rate caused by viral infections. individuals with neutropenia or taking corticosteroids mainly have impaired innate immunity. transplant recipients primarily have defects in adaptive immunity (91, 136) the IFITM3 SNP rs12252 affects CD8+ T cell numbers (144) and variations in receptor components such as the IFIH1 receptor decreases downstream signalling to IFNs (145). patients with severe combined immunodeficiency have major defects in B and T lymphocyte development, facing a substantial risk of infection caused by a wide variety of pathogens (146, 147). PRRs can induce the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-13. normal immune responses to viral infection are summarised in Figure 1A. pro-inflammatory cytokines are essential to mediate innate immunity. release of DAMPs from damaged tissues and cells can further stimulate PRR signalling and lead to a chain reaction culminating in viral sepsis. enteroviruses are characterised by a type I IFN response, induced by PRRs that respond to RNA viruses. TLRs 3 (160), 7 (161), 8 (162), and 9 (163) have been implicated in enterovirus detection. severe infections with coxsackievirus have been associated with host expression of the decay-accelerating factor (DAF) and coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) have been shown to facilitate coxsackievirus infection of neural stem cells (169, 170) the role of DAF in disease is not known (170, 173) innate immune cytokine responses induced by HPeV3 infection are interesting. it has been shown that HPeV is detected by TLRs 7 and 8 (176) which activate the type I IFN pathway (177) there is evidence that HPeVs employ methods to dampen type I IFN signalling (178) in a cell type dependent manner. influenza virus recognition of influenza virus is primarily through TLR3 (181), TLR4 (182), TLR7 (183), and RIG-I (184). disruption of alveolar epithelial-endothelial barrier leads to pulmonary oedema and further respiratory insufficiency. newly-recruited neutrophils and macrophages, derived from monocytes, can produce a wide variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide. these cytokines can also recruit more neutrophils and monocytes into the alveolar lumen (64) dengue virus has been demonstrated to inhibit type I IFN production. inhibition of IFN production contributes to the ability of dengue virus to replicate and spread. Enhanced dengue disease involves the same immune responses as non-enhanced form of disease. the initial inflammatory immune response that characterises viral sepsis is usually followed by a period of immune suppression. this phenomenon is characterised by decreased function in both innate and adaptive immunity. common features include increased expression of negative co-stimulatory molecules and decreased expression of positive co-stimulatory molecules. this can result in increased infections from secondary pathogens, but also the reactivation of dormant infections. 210 infections can increase susceptibility of the host to secondary infections. this phenomenon could explain higher mortality observed in relatively immunosuppressed patients, as well as the high level of mortality observed in sepsis after the initial inflammatory response has passed. measles virus has several ways in which it can interact with the immune system and suppress responses. one of these is by interaction with the CD150 receptor to increase the apoptosis of immune effector cells while also decreasing expression of IFN- (226). infection with measles virus has also been shown to decrease the proliferation of lymphocytes for several weeks after the initial infection. some viral infections are particularly associated with increased mortality during sepsis. but the contribution of individual viruses to mortality is still controversial. one study found no single virus to be significantly associated with higher mortality upon reactivation in sepsis. EBV infection was found to be associated with reduced antibody responses to vaccines in Gambian infants (241) the mechanism of this is still not yet known. reactivated viral infections contribute to inflammation alongside any immunosuppressive effects. PRRs play a critical role in the activation of innate immune responses. first of all, the innate responses stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. PRRs can trigger the development of virus-specific adaptive immunity to clear viruses and virus-infected cells. non-type 1 cytokines result in inappropriate type 2 or type 17 immune responses. T cells become exhausted and can no longer clear pathogens. hyper-inflammatory phase of viral sepsis. HMGB1 is a nuclear protein and regulates DNA transcription. HMGB1 can mount a pro-inflammatory cytokine response to pathological levels. cytochrome c subsequently activates caspase-3 and caspase-7. enterovirus A71 can interfere with the IFN signalling pathway at several points (167) these immune evasion mechanisms have been shown to have a direct impact on survival in mouse models, with blockage of type I IFN pathways in enterovirus A71 infections resulting in increased mortality and viral load (168). HPeV3 infection has been shown to initiate distinct innate immune responses in CNS infections to those of enteroviral infections. enteroviral responses are generally stronger; levels of almost all cytokines are higher in enteroviral responses than in HPeV infections. innate immune cytokine responses induced by HPeV3 infection are interesting. it has been observed that HPeV3 lacks a sequence motif present in other HPeVs that is thought to play a role in viral use of integrins as host cell receptors. this may allow the virus to more easily access host cells and thus replicate to a higher degree than other HPeVs. studies have shown that IL-1 and TNF- can cause decreased activity of amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels. some of the cytokines produced by epithelial cells can cause the recruitment and extravasation of monocytes and neutrophils by direct chemotaxis. innate immune response to dengue infection is characterised by an IL-8 and type I IFN response activated by TLR3 after the virus is degraded by endosomal acidification. dengue virus also activates the TLR7, TLR8, RIG-I and MDA5 signalling pathways, which signal through type I IFNs (194\u2013196) apoptosis is responsible for the development of multiorgan dysfunction in septic patients. apoptosis is responsible for the development of multiorgan dysfunction in septic patients. enteroviruses employ a diverse range of strategies to evade the immune response. these strategies are critical to the ability to cause viral sepsis. some broad strategies of immune evasion used by enteroviruses are interference with innate immune signalling by either interfering with or avoiding PRR recognition. some strains of enterovirus seem to cause a particularly high degree of necrosis in pancreatic islet cells. enteroviral responses are generally stronger; levels of almost all cytokines are higher in enteroviral responses. several reasons have been proposed for why HPeV3 is more likely to cause severe infections than other HPeVs. it has been observed that HPeV3 lacks a sequence motif present in other HPeVs that is thought to play a role in viral use of integrins as host cell receptors. this suggests that the virus may be exploiting a different receptor to enter cells. Influenza virus can cause apoptosis of epithelial cells by the upregulation of the Fas gene via activating protein kinase R (188). cytokines can damage epithelial-endothelial barrier through mechanisms that are not yet understood (64). studies have demonstrated that IL-1 and TNF- can cause decreased activity of amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels. innate immune response to dengue infection is characterised by an IL-8 and type I IFN response activated by TLR3 after the virus is degraded by endosomal acidification. dengue virus also activates the TLR7, TLR8, RIG-I and MDA5 signalling pathways, which signal through type I IFNs (194\u2013196) a more immunosuppressive genotype in patients with sepsis is correlated with increased mortality (201, 202) it has also been reported that the majority of deaths in adults happen during sepsis from all causes happen on the third day or later. infection of leucocytes in severe viral infections has been shown to result in an immunosuppressed state. death of infected leucocytes can result in a diminished ability to prime CD4 and CD8 cells. this greatly increases the susceptibility of the host to secondary infections. chronic viral infections have been found to have differential abilities to induce an immune suppressive state depending on the strain of virus. more pronounced immune exhaustion was produced in mouse CD8 cells by infection with EBV, measles virus, and CMV (222\u2013225) viral reactivation is a common feature of all forms of sepsis. it is possible that other viruses may utilise other immune evasion mechanisms. it is possible that other viruses may utilise other immune evasion mechanisms. a high degree of viral reactivation (of all viruses) correlates with increased mortality. it is still unclear whether elevated viral loads of herpesviruses following reactivation indeed impairs lymphocyte function. however, the overall effects this may have on the patient are not well-characterised. an improved understanding of the effects of viral reactivation is vital to expanding our understanding of sepsis. the diagnosis of viral sepsis can be useful to inform treatment in cases where antiviral medications are available and suitable. but immunological data are scarce on viral sepsis. the results of these studies may help us develop an understanding of how sepsis differs for different aetiologies. transcriptomic studies in sepsis have been performed before (201, 202), but more focused studies aiming to understand the pathogen's role in the character of the disease will be essential. the drug recently completed a small phase 2 clinical trial (248) it is no longer under development and is not available, even for compassionate use. the benefits of more effective antiviral medicines are clear. they could help both in cases of severe viral infections and sepsis. immunomodulation in sepsis aims to decrease the harmful effects of excessive inflammation by altering or counteracting the effects of inflammatory mediator molecules. most trials for immunomodulatory drugs, however, have failed (257) this approach has fallen out of favour in recent years as it either proves ineffective [e.g., dengue (258, 259)] or in some cases has the opposite of the desired effect and dampen the immune system in such a way that allows the pathogen freedom to replicate and prolife a 2016 study identified two distinct host response signatures to sepsis by unsupervised hierarchical clustering, one of which significantly associated with higher 14-day mortality. a similar study focusing primarily on viral sepsis would be invaluable to the understanding of viral sepsis and would open numerous avenues for prospective treatments. this knowledge could potentially be used to inform treatment and development of immunotherapeutics. PD-1 has been implicated in the development of the immunosuppressive phase of sepsis by inducing the apoptosis of effector T cells. dysregulation has been found to be central to the pathology of sepsis (273) in states of septic shock the tight junctions between cells become disrupted due to platelets and neutrophils adhering to the endothelial wall. the process of dysregulation compounds any damage to the endothelial barrier by increasing the level of inflammatory mediators at its surface. the drugs are thought to work by maintaining or restoring endothelial barrier integrity (278) they are thought to be promising treatments of viral infections known to disrupt endothelial integrity. these drugs have had some success in treating severe viral infections such as Ebola and influenza (279\u2013281) the viruses that most often cause viral sepsis tend to have the capacity to evade killing by the immune system while still inducing powerful inflammatory responses. the prolonged inflammation that can be brought on by these infections can result in an immunosuppressed state, further reducing the body's capacity to clear infections, and drastically increasing the risk of death from the original viral infection. the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
