{"summary": "focus reduction assays have been widely used to evaluate neutralizing antibodies against a range of non-cytopathic viruses. focus reduction assay was based on a standard microneutralization assay. each titer was determined as the log value of the reciprocal antibody dilution that reduced the number of viral foci by 50%. heterologous samples from patients infected by genotypes other than type 2 confirm the presence of broadly cross-neutralizing antibodies already reported using the HCV pseudoparticles system. the assay should be an important tool for gauging the relationship between the neutralizing antibodies response and viral load kinetics in acutely or chronically infected patients. a number of antibodies capable of blocking E2 binding to cells or cell receptors have been described, some of which neutralize HCV entry in animal or cellular models. a number of antibodies capable of blocking E2 binding to cells or cell receptors have been described, [5-8] some of which neutralize HCV entry in animal or cellular models. focus reduction neutralization assays have been widely used to evaluate the neutralizing antibody responses to viruses that can form foci in infected cells. the principle of the focus reduction assay has been applied to HCV-neutralizing antibodies detection. neutralizing anti-HCV antibodies titers were expressed as the highest log dilution of IgG producing a 50% reduction in plaque count. the assay was assessed by testing 20 anti-HCV-ELISA-negative samples, including five positive for hepatitis B virus surface antibodies (anti-HBs) and five positive for heterophile antibodies. the log neutralization titers were characterized by the presence (HCV genotype 2) or absence (HCV-negative) of anti-HCV antibodies. inter-assay variability was determined by testing one HCV genotype 2 sample in 10 consecutive experiments. genotype 5 were 1.753 and 1.764, respectively. these results confirm the presence of broadly cross-neutralizing antibodies. this is already reported using the previous HCV pseudoparticle system (HCVpp) more than 60% of the neutralizing antibodies titers fell in the range from 1.7 to 2.69 log titers. more than 60% of the neutralizing antibodies titers fell in the range from 1.7 to 2.69 log titers, corresponding to dilutions of 1:50 and 1:500 respectively. HDLs were able to facilitate HCVpp and HCVcc entry via a mechanism which depended on the expression of the scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) and its selective lipid-uptake function [11,15,16,20] in view of the role of HDL in HCV entry, immunoglobulins were purified from each serum sample prior to determination of the neutralizing antibody titer. the assay's cut-off corresponded to a dilution of 1:18. the assay did not show any cross-reactivity with anti-HIV, anti-HBs or heterophile antibody-positive samples. the mean log neutralization titers for genotypes 1a, 2 and 3 are very similar. the mean average values are lower for genotype 1b (1.747 0.462) and genotype 4 (1.786 0.236) 0.7 1.786 0.236 1.453 \u2013 2.152 5 2 1/1 66 14 6.06 0.6 1.755 0.005 nd all 57 34/23 48 15 5.83 0.7 1.970 0.491 0.934 \u2013 3.121 a Number of samples tested. more than 60% of the neutralizing antibodies titers fell in the range from 1.7 to 2.69 log titers. neutralizing antibodies were shown to control the HCV load and to contribute to viral eradication in patients capable of clearing the infection. the chimpanzee model has been critical for the study of HCV transmission and host immune responses. however, neutralizing antibodies were not detected in some animals that resolved their infection \u2013 suggesting a minimal role in viral clearance. this cell culture system has allowed us to develop a neutralization assay for evaluating the level and proportion of HCV-neutralizing antibodies in chronically infected HCV patients. we analysed a number of parameters (such as practicability, reproducibility and specificity) and tested the effect of a range of variables (viral inoculum size, incubation time, fixation and permeabilization methods, blocking and revelation reagents) on these parameters. the sensitivity was 100% \u2013 not only for genotype 2 (the genotype of the strain used for the assay) but also for other HCV genotypes. the positive sera (96.5%) had comparable and significantly high titers. most neutralizing antibodies are cross-reactive. this is unlikely because few genotype 2 strains are circulating in france. we are confident that as other HCVcc genotypes become available. the plasmid pJFH-1 was linearized at the 3' end of the HCV cDNA. it was used as a template for in vitro transcription, as described previously. titration was performed on Huh-7 cells with 6-well microtiter plates. the genotypes were distributed as follows: 11, 11, 11, 12, 10 and 2 samples of types 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively. serum samples had been stored at -80\u00b0C upon collection and had not been thawed until the time of assay. serial dilutions of purified IgG (10 g) ranging from 1:10 to 1:1,280 were established. each dilution was tested twice. 25 L of each sample was mixed with 25 L of virus (100 FFU) plasmid pJFH-1 was linearized at the 3' end of the HCV cDNA. viral titer was determined in triplicate from the mean number of foci. p values below 0.05 were considered to be significant. the presence of HCV antibodies was determined using two third-generation HCV EIA assays. the genotypes were distributed as follows: 11, 11, 11, 12, 10 and 2 samples of types 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively. the supernatant was pooled and neutralized with 40 L Tris-HCL 1 M pH 8.0. purified IgG was stored at -80\u00b0C. each dilution was tested twice. controls were included in each assay (non-neutralized virus, purified IgG from each patient at a 1:10 dilution). each titer was determined as the log value of the reciprocal antibody dilution that reduced the number of viral foci by 50%."}
