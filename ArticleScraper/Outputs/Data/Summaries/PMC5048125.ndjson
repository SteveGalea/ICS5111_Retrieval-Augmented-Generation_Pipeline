{"summary": "enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains are the major cause of diarrhea. the bacterium causes diarrhea in calves, lambs, piglets, and sheep. the nucleotide sequence of the FanC gene comprises 159 amino acids which are proceeded by the signal sequence of 22 residues (6). a strain of Iranian ETEC was isolated from newborn calves that was positive for the K99 antigen. merase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out in total volume of 25 l containing 1.5 l of MgCl2 (50 mM), 2.5 l of 10X PCR buffer, 2 l of dNTPs (20 mM), 2 l of mix primer (5 pmol/l), 1 l of DNA template (50 to 100 ng/l) and 15.8 l of deionized water. amplified PCR fragment was separated by electrophores pET32a (+)-FanC plasmid was digested with BamHI and XohI enzymes. then the fanC fragment was ligated through T4 DNA ligase procedure. PCR colony was carried out with pET T7 primers and specific primers of the FanC gene. recombinant FanC protein was eluted 4 times with 0.5 ml elution buffer. recombinant FanC protein was dialyzed to remove imidazole and other impurities. nitrocellulose membrane was immersed in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and was shaken for 30 min at room temperature. nitrocellulose membrane was washed 4 times for 5 min each time in PBST. color development was observed by addition of diaminobenzidine dissolved in PBS and H2O2. the supernatant was added and then shaken at room temperature for 10 min. the precipitation was dissolved in 10 ml PBS and then 12% (w/v) PEG 6000 was added and centrifuged. the pellet containing IgY was resuspended in 2 ml PBS. the membrane was washed and the specific binding of IgY antibody to the FanC protein was determined by iELISA. 100 l of the recombinant protein was coated onto microtiter plates for 1 hr. plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. gene transfer FanC to expression vector in forward and reverse primers. PCR was carried out in total volume of 25 l containing 1.5 l of MgCl2 (50 mM), 2.5 l of 10X PCR buffer, 2 l of dNTPs (20 mM), 2 l of mix primer (5 pmol/l), 1 l of DNA template (50 to 100 ng/l) pTZ57R/T-FanC plasmid was ligated into pTZ57R/T cloning vector by T/A cloning. the bacterial clones harboring recombinant plasmid DNA were screened based on their ampicillin resistance. pET32a (+)-FanC plasmid was digested with BamHI and XohI enzymes. expression and protein purification of FaC gene E. coli BL21 CondonPlus (DE3) harboring the FanC expression construct was grown in Luria broth (LB) culture. fresh LB liquid (50 ml) containing 100 g/ml ampicillin was incubated with 5 ml of preculture and was incubated at 37 \u00b0C and 150 rpm. cells were harvested at different time points after induction. the 6Xhis-tagged recombinant protein was eluted 4 times with 0.5 ml elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM Imidazole, pH=8) per column each time. before the injection of the recombinant FanC protein, the recombinant FanC protein was dialyzed to remove imidazole and other impurities. Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant without recombinant protein was injected to the control group. two booster immunizations followed using incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant with two weeks interval. each piece was immersed in primary antibody (hen anti-FanC IgY of the treatment group after injection and hen IgY of the control group) diluted 1:2000 and followed with secondary antibody (rabbit anti-chicken IgY H&L (HRP) diluted 1:2000. other steps carried similar to steps mentioned previously. rabbit anti-chicken IgY H&L was labeled as the secondary antibody for 1 hr at 37 \u00b0C. the colorimetric detection was carried out using O-phenylenediamine (OPD, Sigma) as a chromogenic substrate of HRP. the reaction was stopped by adding 50 l/well 2N H2SO4. colonies of the recombinant pET32a (+)-FanC plasmid were confirmed by colony PCR with pET T7 primers. existence of FanC gene into pET32a (+) was verified by enzymatic digestion. brown dot (A) (E. coli/pET32a (+)/FanC) shows transformed bacteria induced by IPTG. result of dot-blot analysis confirmed the existence of the recombinant FanC protein. dot blotting and western blotting analyses Dot-blotting analysis of the recombinant FanC protein showed that it could be recognized by the anti-FanC specific IgY in 1:2000 dilution of antibody. western blotting analysis indicated a 36 kDa protein band. the PCR amplified product was successfully cloned into pTZ57R/T. the target gene was correctly inserted into the recombinant pTZ57R/T plasmid. colonies of the recombinant pET32a (+)-FanC plasmid were confirmed. the results of the FanC expression were shown on 12% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis by induction on 1 mM IPTG in 2, 4 and 6 hr after induction. pET32a (+) vector is able to express a fusion protein with a 6-histidine tag at thrombin site and a T7 tag at the N-terminus. the recombinant FanC protein was successfully purified using Ni-NTA agarose column. the concentration of recombinant protein was calculated as 1.3 mg/ml. anti-FanC IgY (at 1:2000 dilution) was able to recognize the recombinant FanC protein in the treatment group (immunized by FanC) there were significant differences between treatment and control groups (P-value0.0001) the production of specific IgY from the first to eight weeks after the last immunization was shown in Figure 5b. studies include specific egg yolk antibody against recombinant cryptosporidium parvum P23 protein (16), generation of egg yolk antibodies against influenza M2 protein (17) and production of specific IgY against helicobacter pylori recombinant (19). researchers indicated passive protection of neonatal piglets achieved against K88, K99 and 987P fimbrial adhesions. anti-FanC IgY antibody was produced by immunizing hens with the recombinant FanC protein, which can be used as a tool for the immune diagnosis. the results of this study are in agreement with the results of other studies that indicated immunized hens are an excellent alternative for production of polyclonal antibodies. conflict of interest The authors declare no conflict of interest."}
