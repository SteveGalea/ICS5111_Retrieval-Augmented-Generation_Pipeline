{"summary": "1% random sample of tweets containing the keyword Ebola. we analyzed changes in frequencies of keywords, hashtags, and Web links. results We identified two speculative treatments. METHODS Study design We collected microblog data from Twitter and Sina Weibo in two batches to document changes in Ebola-related microblog content one week after the WHO PHEIC announcement. Batch 1 was collected during the first 24 hours after the WHO PHEIC announcement12. o had 156.5 million monthly active users as of June 201416. despite the state's control of political information, online users can use Sina Weibo to speak with some autonomy on public health affairs. the process of segmenting a sentence into different units of meaning (words) the Chinese microblogs were processed differently because of the linguistic difference between English-language tweets and Chinese microblogs. we removed stop words, punctuation, emoticons, and special symbols used in microblogging. the unit of analysis was a keyword, a hashtag, or a domain name. the unit of analysis was a keyword, a hashtag, or a domain name. manual coding and categorization of microblog contents We manually categorized microblog content under different themes to identify the information and misinformation contained therein. for manual coding, we randomly selected 5%\u20137% of the de-identified social media posts. the manually coded dataset was 5%\u20137% of the original dataset. in each selected sample, the microblog posts were first categorized into English/Chinese posts and posts that were not English or Chinese. the non-English, non-Chinese tweets (54 in Batch 1 and 29 in Batch 2) were excluded from further analysis, leaving 245 tweets in Batch 1 and 87 in Batch 2 for analysis. Twitter data retrieval Twitter had 271 million monthly active users worldwide in 2014. tweets are seen as digital footprints for monitoring the public's health-related responses and behaviors. of the 7,645 microblog posts in Batch 1, 219 posts created outside the specified time frame and 49 posts containing the Chinese term for \u201cEbola\u201d in their username were excluded. of the 3,416 microblog posts in Batch 2, 64 posts containing the Chinese term for \u201cEbola\u201d in their username but not in the body of the posts were excluded. Candidate keywords for subsequent analysis were all unique keywords in the tokenized English-language tweets and segmented Chinese microblogs. the extracted Web links were resolved by the cURL program24 to obtain the full Web links and domain names. we evaluated the relative frequency of each item in Batch 1 and Batch 2 using the relative risk (RR) and 2 feature selection algorithm. high 2 values indicate strong evidence for the existence of a difference between the observed value and expected value. the proportion of random numbers generated that were 5 was not the same for each dataset. the manually coded dataset was 5%\u20137% of the original datasets. 17 of the 469 randomly selected Sina Weibo posts in Batch 1 were excluded. analysis of Sina Weibo samples created two categories for posts related to the Chinese medical team's departure for Guinea and for posts that reported news of a \"suspected case in a hospital in Shanghai\" the tweets were among the top 20 keywords list of the English and Chinese microblogs in Batch 1: \u201cebola,\u201d \u201cvirus,\u201d \u201coutbreak/epidemic\u201d and \u201cemergency\u201d. bOf 4,844 and 2,001 tweets obtained in Batch 1 and Batch 2, respectively, only 2,132 and 820 tweets, respectively, were classified as English language by the language detection algorithm. of 7,645 Chinese microblog posts obtained in Batch 1, 219 were excluded because they were posted outside the specified time frame. 49 were excluded because they contained the Chinese term for \u201cEbola\u201d in the username but not in the body of the Sina Weibo post. tweets and Chinese microblogs (Sina Weibo) on Ebola, August 8\u20139, 2014, and August 15\u201316, 2014a a Trending items are those with a high 2 value and RR>1. bTerms with the same stem were grouped under one category showing their infinite form. bTerms with the same stem were grouped under one category showing their infinite form. of 245 tweets in Batch 1 and 87 tweets in Batch 2, alternative health information accounted for six tweets in Batch 1 and two tweets in Batch 2. similar percentage of tweets on health education and information (i.e., information that is not in line with current scientific understanding of Ebola and its prevention and control) responses to alternative health information accounted for 43 (9.5%) posts in Batch 1 and 13 (6.3%) posts in Batch 2. alternative health information in Batch 2 included two posts on \"bathing in salt water and then drinking it\" dTo unify the two Chinese translations of the keyword \u201cEbola,\u201d we converted all into during our analysis. dTo unify the two Chinese translations of the keyword \u201cEbola,\u201d we converted all into during our analysis. analysis of changing relative frequencies Terms related to the WHO's PHEIC announcement, including \u201cemergency event\u201d (2=458.9, RR=0.01), \u201cpublic health\u201d (2=371.0, RR=0.10), or \u201cannounced\u201d (2=232.0, RR=0.12), were fading in Batch 2 on Sina Weibo. an experimental drug known as Nano Silver was on the top 10 trending Twitter hashtag list. tweets reading \u201cEbola may be vastly underestimated,\u201d reflecting a WHO assessment, made \u201cunderestimate\u201d the top trending term on Twitter in Batch 2. of 452 posts analyzed in Batch 1 and 207 posts analyzed in Batch 2 alternative health information accounted for 11 posts in Batch 1 and three in Batch 2. responses to alternative health information accounted for 43 (9.5%) posts in Batch 1 and 13 (6.3%) posts in Batch 2. bOnly posts in English or Chinese were coded. a total of 54 tweets in Batch 1 and 29 tweets in Batch 2 were in a language other than English or Chinese. two posts advocating traditional Chinese medicine criticized the Western medical idea of Ebola virus causing the Ebola virus disease. that particular comment drew 25 posts containing criticism and sarcastic comments from Sina Weibo users. study found 55% of tweets contained medical misinformation. 47%\u201358% of the posts were Ebola-relevant news stories. 19%\u201324% were health information and responses to alternative health information in both batches are compatible with another analysis of Ebola-related Twitter data. the word \u201cChina\u201d occurred more frequently than \u201cEbola\u201d in Batch 2 of Chinese microblogs. the term \u201cChina\u201d was the most frequently used term in Batch 2 of Chinese microblogs. we compensated for our weakness of having a single manual coder by having a second coder code 10% of the sample. our random sample (about 4.5 million tweets per day) constituted about 1% of the Twitter universe. a free and open online platform may enable the dissemination of unofficial and unconfirmed information but also pluralistic views. censoring allows governments to control rumors and alternative information, but it can put the society at risk of a potential government cover-up. a retrospective longitudinal study of Ebola-related information on microblogs will allow us to investigate how the volume and contents of misinformation changed during this outbreak."}
