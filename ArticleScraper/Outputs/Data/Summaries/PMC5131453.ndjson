{"summary": "the aim of this article is to describe OH research and training and capacity building activities and the important developments in government support for OH in these countries to identify current achievements and gaps. only a small proportion of zoonotic disease research conducted in South Asia can be described as truly OH. the dependence on donor-funded programmes and political instability create a challenging environment for establishing sustainable collaboration to manage zoonotic diseases in Afghanistan. Bangladesh Multisectoral committees were formed at all tiers of the government to manage HPAI (H5N1) in the early 2000s. 'OH Bangladesh' is the major professional OH network in Bangladesh, inaugurated in 2008. the OH Hub, Bangladesh, established in 2013, is integrated with and supports the OH Bangladesh organisation. an inter-ministerial task force and a Joint Monitoring Group were established in 2004 to facilitate collaborative multisectoral management of HPAI (H5N1) (64). a national Standing Committee on zoonoses was formed by the Indian government in 2005 and headed by the Director of Health Services to recommend policies, operational research, and inter-sectoral collaboration on the control of zoonoses in the country (44). the directorate of animal health has initiated the establishment of 75 district-level OH hubs, providing a single platform to discuss OH issues at district level. the OH Hub, Nepal, was established in 2013 with the Directorate of animal health and the Epidemiology and Disease Control Department as focal points. joint technical committees have recently been established for rabies and stray dog population control. both committees include members from the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Rural Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government."}
