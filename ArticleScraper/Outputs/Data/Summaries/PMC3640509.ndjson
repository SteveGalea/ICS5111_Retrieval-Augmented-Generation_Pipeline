{"summary": "primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is rare autoimmune liver disease that predominantly affects women. it is characterized by immune destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts, aberrant expression of mitochondrial antigens on biliary epithelium. progressive loss of bile ducts leads to accumulation of bile in the liver, fibrosis and then cirrhosis in those unresponsive to therapy. more than two thirds of patients develop both AMA and the PBC specific phenotype in bile ducts with aberrant expression of mitochondrial autoantigens. however, only a proportion of patients develop biochemical and histological disease. liver transplant centers have reported a similar protective era effect. the primary use of CsA has been shown to confer a protective effect against other autoimmune diseases, such as de novo AIH in liver transplant recipients in general [20]. a study based at our center found that the probability of de novo AIH was approximately 4% at 10 years with an overall incidence of 4 cases per 1000 patient-years. the frequency of de novo AIH may be higher than the prevalence of AIH in the general population, probably because transplant patients are exposed to more potential risk factors. the 5- and 10-year probability of development of de novo hepatitis with cyclosporine A was 0 and 1.2% respectively; the 5- and 10-year probability of development with tacrolimus was 1.9% and 6.0% respectively; and the 5- and 10-year probability of development with mycophenolate mofetil was 3.1 and 22.5% respectively. recurrence of recurrent disease strongly suggests an infectious process. epidemiological data are lacking to support this conjecture. xenobiotics, specific bacteria and a betaretrovirus have been linked with the development of PBC. an ELISA is being constructed to determine the seroprevalence of HBRV infection in a large cohort of patients with liver disease. mouse models are being used to demonstrate how infection with the closely related MMTV triggers autoimmune biliary disease. a similar model could be used to propose that factors that trigger the original disease also persist in the allograft. the development of de novo AIH remains a total mystery. it has been suggested that AIH may represent serologically unidentified viral infection(s). in one case with acute onset AIH, the viral load was highest with acute presentation and diminished by corticosteroid treatment. MM5MT mouse breast cancer cells contain integrated MMTV provirus. this model cannot be used to test early events in the retrovirus life cycle. downstream production of infectious particles from integrated provirus can be studied. incubation with NIM811 resulted in similar levels of reverse transcriptase and genome equivalents. the mechanism(s) of how either CsA or NIM811 block viral production has yet to be resolved. cyclophilins play a critical role in assisting the interaction of the viral capsid protein with the major cytoplasmic component of the nuclear pore complex. inhibition of the cyclophilin A interaction with HIV capsid by CsA impairs the passage of the mature viral core to the nucleus. the presence of cyclophilin A can be blocked by CsA and Debio-025. the presence of CsA also accelerates proteolytic degradation of the influenza matrix protein M1. cyclophilin inhibitors trigger loss of the HIV Vpr protein independent of proteosome activity. s may inhibit betaretrovirus activity during maturation or infective stages of target cells. further characterization of role of cyclophilins in the betaretrovirus life cycle would be beneficial in vitro and in mouse models of PBC with MMTV infection."}
