{"summary": "yearly incidence data of HIV diagnoses and patients with AIDS who had not previously been diagnosed as HIV positive, from 1985 to 2017, were analyzed. yearly incidence data of HIV diagnoses and patients with AIDS who had not previously been diagnosed as HIV positive were analyzed. backcalculation method used to model AIDS incidence as arising from the HIV incidence convoluted with the independently and identically distributed incubation period. a simple integral equation to model AIDS incidence allows estimation of the HIV incidence based on epidemiological surveillance data. despite the clear need for epidemiological estimation of the number of undiagnosed HIV infections, the surveillance data in Japan possesses two technical problems. despite the clear need for epidemiological estimation of the number of undiagnosed HIV infections, the surveillance data in Japan possesses two technical problems. a backcalculation method requires the count of all AIDS cases over time. ART has been widespread since 1997 and has continuously improved the prognosis of HIV infection. ART has been widespread since 1997 and has improved the prognosis of HIV infection. a simple yet tractable estimation method is called for. the yearly incidence of HIV infections and AIDS diagnoses from 1985 to 2017 was used. the data are structured by sex and also by the most likely route of transmission (e.g., heterosexual, homosexual or intravenous drug use, based on a physician\u2019s interview of patients) a stratified estimation by sex was conducted. the dynamics of HIV diagnosis and illness onset are described by t + s h t, s = t + s h t, s, (1) with a boundary condition t : = h t, 0, (2) where (t) represents the HIV incidence (i.e., the number of new HIV infections) at calendar time t. incidence of AIDS cases at calendar time t, u (t), is written as u t = 0 t t h t, s d s = 0 t t t s exp t s t x d x 0 s y d y d d s, (5) and similarly, the incidence of AIDS cases at time t, a (t), is written as u t = 0 the incidence of HIV infection in year t, t, is modeled as a step function. the probability mass function of the incubation period is assumed as known. the probability mass function of the incubation period is assumed as known. the diagnosed proportion of HIV infections is calculated either as (a + u)(x + a + u) or u(x + u) the former calculates the proportion of diagnosed HIV-positive individuals out of the cumulative number of HIV-positive individuals. this calculation has the drawback of including patients with AIDS who have already died by the year of calculation. the likelihood of new AIDS diagnoses is L 2 = constant t = 1985 2017 E a t w t exp E a t, 15 (15) where wt denotes the reported number of new AIDS diagnoses in year t. 95% confidence interval (CI) of parameters was derived from the profile likelihood. model parameters were resampled from a multivariate normal distribution with vectors of mean and standard deviation. the latter vector was derived from the covariance matrix. of 2017, there were 16,663 HIV infections and 7,587 AIDS cases among japanese nationals. an AIDS case indicates a patient who has never been diagnosed with HIV infection prior to an AIDS diagnosis. yearly incidence of HIV infections and AIDS diagnoses from 1985 to 2017 was used. individuals who are undiagnosed and in the incubation period experience two different hazards, i.e., the force of HIV diagnosis (t) that depends on calendar time t and the time since infection (i.e., undiagnosed HIV infection without AIDS), the dynamics of HIV diagnosis and illness onset are described by t + s h t, s = t + s h t, s, (1) with a boundary condition t : = h the McKendrick equation can be solved along the characteristic line, i.e., h t, s = t s exp t s t x d x 0 s y d y d y, (4) for t s>0. the incidence of AIDS cases at calendar time t, u (t), is written as u t = 0 t t t h t, s d the incidence of HIV infection in year t, t, is modeled as a step function. the probability mass function of the incubation period is assumed as known, and in discrete time, this is written as s y = 1 s 1 1 y. undiagnosed HIV infections at the end of year t are computed as x t = s = 1 t t s x = t s + 1 t 1 1 x y = exp t k. the diagnosed proportion of HIV infections is calculated either as (a + u)(x + a + u) or u(x + u), taking the summations over time. this calculation has the drawback of including patients with AIDS who the likelihood function of HIV diagnoses is L 1 = constant t = 1985 2017 E u t r t exp E u t, (14) where rt denotes the reported number of new AIDS diagnoses in year t. the likelihood of new AIDS diagnoses is L 2 = constant t = 1985 2017 E a t w t exp E a t, 15 (15) where wt denotes the reported number of new AIDS diagnoses in year the 95% confidence interval (CI) of parameters was derived from the profile likelihood. all statistical data were analyzed using R version 3.1 (Comprehensive R Archive Network) the yearly incidence was the highest from 2005\u20132008, with an estimated 1,972 infections per year. the yearly estimate in the most recent interval (from 2013\u20132017) was 1,179 (95% CI: 1,047, 1,293) infections. the yearly probability of diagnosis has monotonously improved over time. the step function for every 4 years was used to model the incidence. the 95% confidence intervals were derived from profile likelihood. a common logarithmic scale is used on the vertical axis. bold grey lines represent lower and upper 95% confidence intervals. undiagnosed HIV infection estimated to have peaked in 2009 with 7,532 (95% CI: 6,911, 8,152) infections. the estimated proportions of diagnosed HIV infections are shown in Figs. 4C and 4D. excluding AIDS cases, the diagnosed proportion was estimated at 81.9% (range 78.7% to 85.7%) using the median incubation period of 10.0 (7.5 to 12.3) years. figures show the diagnosed proportion, including and excluding AIDS cases, with 95% confidence intervals. even when AIDS cases were included, the 2,321 deaths known up to that point were subtracted from AIDS cases in advance of the calculation. based on epidemiological surveillance data in japan, the proportion of diagnosed HIV infections appears not to have reached 90% among Japanese nationals. the findings echo those of a published study that analyzed blood donor data. the findings pose a critical problem in Japan for controlling HIV and AIDS. the underlying mechanisms of such decreases have yet to be explored using a mathematical model. the success of Japan\u2019s controlling HIV transmission among the core population, i.e., MSM, reflecting the set-up of gay community centers. the clinical definition of AIDS in Japan depends on indicators diseases, imposing a certain extent of uncertainty in diagnosis. compared with HIV-infected individuals diagnosed at local health centers, the frequency of AIDS diagnosis may be higher in designated hospitals, calling for validation of estimates using other methods. the present study successfully estimated the incidence of HIV infections, undiagnosed number of infections, and the proportion diagnosed in real time. despite these limitations, the present study successfully estimated the incidence of HIV infections, undiagnosed number of infections, and the proportion diagnosed in real time. analysis tools, prepared figures and/or tables approved the final draft. data Availability The raw data with the website URL is referenced in the manuscript."}
