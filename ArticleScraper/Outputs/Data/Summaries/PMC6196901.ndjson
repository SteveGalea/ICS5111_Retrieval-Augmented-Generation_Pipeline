{"summary": "OBJECTIVES In our retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data of 369 patients with CAP. there was no difference between patients with CAP admitted to hospital and intensive care unit during IS and non-influenza season (NIS) with respect to age, mortality, and DOS. approximately 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness and approximately 250,000\u2013500,000 deaths worldwide. influenza epidemics occur annually during autumn and winter in temperate regions. it may be difficult to distinguish seasonal influenza pneumonia from bacterial pneumonia. IS is defined as the period between December 1 and April 30, and NIS is defined as period between May 1 and November 30. we derived these time intervals from data from a study by Puig-Barbera [4] and an influenza surveillance report in Turkey [7] the authors reviewed the files from the patient data system of the hospital and recorded the patients with a diagnosis of pneumonia (ICD code J18) each year is divided into \"IS\" and \"non-influenza season\" each year is divided into \"non-influenza season\" each year is divided into \"IS\" and \"non-influenza season\" a p0.05 was considered to indicate significance. we excluded 44 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia, 10 patients with immunosuppression and 4 patients with healthcare-related pneumonia. overall, 369 patients with CAP were enrolled in the study. 79 (21) CAP: community-acquired pneumonia; ICU: intensive care unit; CRP: C-reactive protein; CT: computed tomography In total, 247 (66.9%) patients showed pneumonic infiltration, 10 (2.7%) showed empyema findings, and 17 (4.6%) showed lung abscess in their thorax computed tomography. 109 (29.5%) cases were bilateral and 260 (70.5%) were unilateral. 138 (70.1) 129 (75) 0.289 Mortality [n (%)] 14 (7.1) 14 (7.1) 0.86 Median duration of hospitalization (days) 10.0 (1\u201350) 9.0 (1\u201382) 0.676 Median duration of ICU stay (days) 5.0 (1\u201310) 6.0 (2\u201340) 0.206 Median leukocyte count (103/L) 11400 (1690\u201356100) 11900 (1900\u201385200) 0.755 Median neutrophil count the frequency of cancer (p=0.027), especially that of lung cancer (p=0.007), was high in NIS. no study has so far examined DOS of patients with CAP during IS and NIS. influenza tests are not performed in 25%\u201360% of patients hospitalized for influenza. in the Netherlands, only 40% of patients admitted to ICU for CAP were tested for influenza. new polymerase chain reaction tests are now available for detecting Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. blood cultures are positive in only 3%\u201314% of patients hospitalized with CAP. in our daily practice, we collect blood samples for cultures from patients with high fever. in our study, more samples for cultures were obtained in NIS than in IS. thorax CTs showed mostly bilateral lesions during IS. influenza may complicate and facilitate severe bilateral pneumonia. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an important risk factor. the aim was to determine whether DOS in hospital might be affected by multiple factors, such as socioeconomical factors. air pollution rate is higher during IS, and air pollution rate is higher during IS."}
