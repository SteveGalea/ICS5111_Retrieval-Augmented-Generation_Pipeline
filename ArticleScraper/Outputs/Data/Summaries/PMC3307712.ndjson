{"summary": "airway epithelia is composed of a gel-like mucus layer and a sol-like periciliary liquid layer. the viscous mucous blanket traps inhaled microorganisms and particles to restrict their spreading in the lung. the viscous mucous blanket traps inhaled microorganisms and particles to restrict their spreading. adenosine largely regulates epithelial CFTR channel function by acting on A2BAR [16], [17], [18]. previous alcohol studies have documented that ethanol exposure decreases cAMP signaling and protein kinase A (PKA) activation. no published data are currently available regarding alcohol effects on airway ion transport through this signaling pathway. fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin and 0.25 g/ml amphotericin B were cultured at 37\u00b0C. CF epithelia after 2 weeks exhibited a transepithelial electrical resistance greater than 700 /cm2. EPES, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 0.6 mM KH2PO4, 4 mM CaCl2, 2.4 mM K2HPO4 3H2O, and 10 mM Dextrose, pH 7.4) both buffers were continuously stirred, gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 and maintained at 37\u00b0C. the cells were exposed to either 0 mM or 100 mM of ethanol for 24 hours. the cells were washed with 100 M of adenosine to inhibit phosphodiesterases that might degrade cAMP. the cystic fibrosis (CF) airway epithelial cells CFBE41o- [24] were similarly cultured. the fully differentiated CF epithelia after 2 weeks exhibited a transepithelial resistance greater than 700 /cm2. basal high chloride buffer (135 mM NaCl, 5.0 mM HEPES, 0.6 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 2.4 mM, K2HPO4 3H2O, and 10 mM Dextrose, pH 7.4) both buffers were continuously stirred, gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. the cells were washed with 100 M of adenosine to inhibit phosphodiesterases that might degrade cAMP. the cells were lysed and cAMP was measured by cAMP immunoassay. all the treatments were carried out in quadruplicates. ethanol exposure decreased adenosine-activated ISC in a dose-dependent manner. significant differences were detected by one-way ANOVA test. ethanol pre-exposure decreased 100 M adenosine-mediated epithelial ion transport. bumetanide (100 M), a specific inhibitor for the Na+-K+-2Cl cotransporter, was applied to the basolateral side of the Calu-3 epithelia. this drug decreased ISC by 58%, while acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, and DNDS, an inhibitor for Na+/HCO3 cotransporters and Cl/HCO3 exchangers, had no effect on ISC. adenosine-stimulated chloride transport is mediated through the CFTR channel. CFTR has been found to be a major chloride channel in the airway epithelium responsible for adenosine-induced ion transport. adenosine-induced ISC was mostly absent in CFBE41o cells. CFTR channel was dysfunctional or significantly inhibited with 25 M of CFTR inhibitor CFTRinh172. t-test was performed to determine the statistic significance. the adenosine-stimulated ISC was decreased by 75% (n = 6) ethanol inhibits adenosine-stimulated cAMP production to cause a reduced CFTR channel activity. ethanol pre-treatment significantly decreased adenosine-stimulated cAMP levels. the alcohol-treated Calu-3 cells in the presence of 10 M Sp-cAMPS obliterated the ethanol suppressive effect on adenosine-induced chloride secretion. ethanol inhibits CFTR-mediated chloride secretion by directly affecting the cellular cAMP level. phosphodiesterase inhibitors restore ethanol suppression of adenosine-induced transepithelial chloride conductance. air-liquid interface cultures of Calu-3 cells exposed to 0 and 100 mM of ethanol for 24 hours. phosphodiesterase inhibitors, IBMX (100 M) or papaverine (50 M), fully restored the ethanol-suppressed adenosine-stimulated ISC. the cultured epithelia were exposed basolaterally for 24 hours to different concentrations of ethanol (0, 25, 50 and 100 mM) and adenosine-induced transepithelial ion transport was assessed by measuring ISC with an Ussing chamber apparatus. ethanol pre-exposure decreased adenosine-activated ISC in a dose-dependent manner. Ethanol pre-exposure decreased 100 M adenosine mediated epithelial ion transport in a dose-dependent manner. asterisks indicate significant differences between groups by one-way ANOVA test. adenosine-stimulated anion secretion in airway epithelia is largely mediated by chloride transport. adenosine-stimulated short circuit current is chloride conductance. ISC of Calu-3 epithelia was measured by using asymmetric chloride buffers. the adenosine-stimulated ISC was 92% lower than that with chloride-gradient buffers. adenosine failed to elicit any chloride currents across the CF epithelia. currents under our experimental condition and drug profile are CFTR-mediated chloride conductance. in airway epithelial cells ethanol-suppression of chloride transport is mediated through CFTR, a cAMP-activated chloride channel. adenosine stimulates chloride conductance through the A2B adenosine receptor (A2BAR) the air-liquid interface cultures of Calu-3 cells were stimulated with 100 M of apical adenosine followed by 50 M of alloxazine, a specific inhibitor for A2BAR. ethanol pre-treatment significantly decreased adenosine-stimulated cAMP levels. cells were lysed and levels of cellular cAMP assayed. ethanol pre-treatment significantly decreased adenosine-stimulated cAMP levels. ethanol pre-exposure decreased the adenosine-stimulated ISC. phosphodiesterase inhibitors restore the ethanol suppression of adenosine-induced transepithelial chloride conductance. phosphodiesterase inhibitors restore ethanol suppression of adenosine-induced transepithelial chloride conductance. ethanol-exposed Calu-3 epithelia had significantly lower adenosine-stimulated ISC than the no ethanol control. phosphodiesterase inhibitors, IBMX (100 M) or papaverine (50 M), fully restored the ethanol-suppressed adenosine-stimulated ISC. polarized airway epithelia have a mechanical clearance mechanism. ethanol affects adenosine-stimulated chloride secretion through CFTR. adenosine binds to adenosine receptor present in airway epithelia. this receptor is coupled to Gs protein to activate adenylyl cyclase. studies on human bronchial epithelial cells have revealed that a 24-hour exposure with 100 mM of alcohol caused an 8-fold increase in trachea-bronchial mucin gene expression. ethanol exposure reduces chloride secretion, which consequently alters ASL composition and volume. this finding is of clinical implications. restoration of cellular cAMP level with phosphodiesterase inhibitors could ameliorate clearance by improving epithelial ion secretion."}
