{"summary": "ebola and Zika virus outbreaks have created panic in the public. scientists are on the way to combat EVD and save lives. fruit bats are the major reservoirs of the virus and it is the contact with such bats (infected) or intermediate hosts like pigs which are responsible for infection in man. dependence on animal rearing as a source of additional income in many Asian countries is a predisposing factor. considerable uncertainty exists about the patterns of Nipah virus circulation in bats and epidemiological factors associated with its spill-over into pigs and horses. despite an increasing risk, rigorous studies collate data from Nipah infections of pigs. the almost annual occurrence of Henipaviruses in south-eastern Asia and Australia since the mid 1990s is noteworthy. there have been a total 639 human cases of NiV infection reported from Bangladesh (261 cases), India (85 cases), Singapore (11 cases), Philippines (17 cases) and Malaysia (265 cases. Nipah virus is a paramyxovirus that can cause severe respiratory illness and deadly encephalitis in humans. it is a single-stranded, nonsegmented, enveloped RNA virus possessing helical symmetry. NiV infects its host cells via two glycoproteins, i.e. G and F proteins. the fusion protein mediates attachment to host cell surface receptors and the fusion protein makes fusion of virus-cell membranes for cellular entry. Nipah virus can survive for up to 3 days in fruit juices or mango fruit. the virus has a half-life of 18 h in the urine of fruit bats. the viability of the virus in its natural environment may vary depending on the different conditions. protein has been shown to increase the level of a host protein UBXN1 (UBX domain-containing protein 1, a negative controller of RIG-I-like receptor signaling) by restraining its proteolysis and thus regulating (suppressing) induction of innate interferons. the matrix protein also highjacks ubiquitination pathways to facilitate transient nuclear localization. transmission of the Nipah virus Bats serve as reservoir hosts for several high risk pathogens, including Nipah, rabies and marbug viruses. from bats, the virus has crossed its species-barrier frequently to several other species including man through spilled over transmission, but with limited transmission from person to person thereafter. infected pig meat travels across continents which led to transmission of virus from animals in one part of the world to people in another part of globe. NiV transmission occurs via consumption of virus-contaminated foods and contact with infected animals or human body fluids. three transmission pathways of the Nipah virus have been identified after investigation carried out in Bangladesh. data also revealed high seroprevalence of anti-Nipah viral antibodies. virus has undergone adaptation well enough to get transmitted among Pteropus bats. fruit bats act as natural reservoir of Nipah viruses. investigation suggested need of collaborative prevention and control measures by spreading the awareness campaigns. pigs are the intermediate as well as amplifying hosts for the virus. pigs are the intermediate as well as amplifying hosts. the outbreak was stopped after pigs were slaughtered and proper disinfection measures were taken. domesticated animals play key roles in major spill-over events of bat-borne viruses but their exact rolesas bridging or amplifying species remain unclear. in 1998, one outbreak of acute Nipah virus infection was recorded in 11 male abattoir workers (average age of 44 years) patients showed higher level of IgM in serum and some unusual symptoms of atypical pneumonia and encephalitis with characteristic focal areas of increased signal intensity. farmers associated with pig farming and abattoir workers were found to be in the high risk group. NiV infection has not been reported directly in man or pig in Indonesia. in Indonesia, there is every possibility of disease spread from carrier bats to pig or man. the surveillance study was performed to assess the distribution of Henipaviruses in Southeast Asia, Australasia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor, Indonesia and neighboring countries. in Thailand, regular surveillance and sero-surveillance of bat population indicated the presence of NiV RNA in the saliva and urine of bats, and IgG in the serum. researchers started genetic characterization of Nipah virus by detecting viral nucleic acid. raw date palm was the source of infection of the outbreak recorded during the year 2011 (Rahman et al. 2012) on may 19, 2018, 4 infected people died and on 23 May, 2018 13 more subjects deceased. the epidemic strain showed close resemblance to the BD strain of NiV. in both outbreaks, circumstantial evidences suggested the human-to-human transmission. a firefly luciferase that expresses NiV has been generated for facilitating studies (spatiotemporal) on the pathogenesis of Henipaviruses. this reverse genetics system may be a useful tool to investigate Henipa-like viruses. the NiV isolates from Malaysia and Cambodia clustered together in NiV-MY clade, whereas isolates from Bangladesh and India clustered within NiV-BD clade. intra-clade similarity of G gene at nucleotide level was high between 98 and 100%, while inter-clade similarity was relatively less. nucleotide sequence homology has also been observed between the virus isolated from Bangladesh and Malaysia. nucleotide heterogeneity (inter-strain) has been found to be more obvious. phylogenetic analysis showed close similarity of sequences obtained from pigs and humans during the Malaysian outbreak. analysis also revealed that the virus isolated from Bangladesh possesses an additional 6 nucleotides than the prototype Malysian strain. bats possess comparatively higher repertoire of naive immunoglobulins with more specifities. in such condition there may be poor or no hypermutation and affinity maturation stages in B cells, leading to poorer responses and restricted production of high-titered antibodies than other species. evasion strategies are mediated through accessory proteins encoded within the virus. this gene encodes accessory proteins such as P, V, W and C. all of these were reported to inhibit host antiviral responses. the virus induced immune evasion for long time also accounts for the persistence of virus in brain tissues and ensuing relapsed and late onset fatal encephalitis in man. the pathogenecity of the virus in pigs and man can be correlated with its ability and magnitude to evade immune responses in reservoir host. significant inflammatory mediators are induced when the airway epithelium gets infected. from the respiratory epithelium, the virus is disseminated to the endothelial cells of the lungs in the later stage of the disease. spleen and kidneys along with brain may act as target organs leading to multiple organ failure. olfactory epithelium of the nasal turbinate is infected by NiV. the viral infection extends through the cribiform plate into the olfactory bulb. a diagrammatic representation of pathogenesis of NiV has been depicted. the virus is responsible for causing severe and rapidly progressing illness in humans with the respiratory system as well as the central nervous system mainly getting affected. the signs and symptoms of the disease appear 3\u201314 days post NiV exposure. mortality is relatively low in pigs under six months of age. in animals that are confined, morbidity may approach 100 per cent. in dogs infected with NiV, there may be inflammation of the lungs along with necrosis of glomeruli and tubules. lesions may become evident in corpus callosum, brain stem, as well as cortex of the cerebrum. it is crucial to note that diffusion-weighted (DW)-MRI is employed to detect such lesions. viral antigens at greater concentration may be present in the blood vascular endothelial cells (especially in the lungs) in the upper respiratory tract of pigs in the lumen viral antigens are evident amidst the cellular debris which is suggestive of the transmission of NiV through exhalation. in dogs, kidneys may show congestion with severe hemorrhage. the virus is disseminated to the endothelial cells of the lungs in the later stage of the disease. it can gain entry into the blood stream followed by dissemination, either freely or in host leukocyte bound form. there is development of lethal infection in hamsters when leukocytes loaded with NiV are passively transferred. the virus is disseminated throughout the ventral cortex along with olfactory tubercle. a diagrammatic representation of pathogenesis of NiV has been depicted in Figure 4. Pathogenesis of NiV. encephalitis is a critical complication of the NiV infection. it is also known as porcine respiratory and encephalitis syndrome (PRES), barking pig syndrome (BPS) or one-mile cough. the disease is also known as porcine respiratory and encephalitis syndrome. in dogs infected with NiV, there may be inflammation of the lungs. in cats, there may be development of endothelial syncytia along with vasculopathy. clinical signs are apparently absent in mice as well as rats for unknown reasons. in pigs, the disease is also known as porcine respiratory and encephalitis syndrome (PRES), barking pig syndrome (BPS) or one-mile cough. an acute febrile illness has been reported in pigs below six months of age. in animals that are confined, morbidity may approach 100 per cent. embryo, as well as africa green monkey, results in development of lesions in the parenchyma in the CNS along with vasculopathy. clinical signs are apparently absent in mice as well as rats for unknown reasons. congestion along with generalized edema is present in kidneys and brain. there may be pneumonia (moderate to high) along with formation of syncytial cells in the endothelial cell lining of the blood vasculatures. there may be development of small vessel vasculopathy (disseminated) in case of acute infection. fruit bats (Pteropus) serve as natural hosts (wildlife reservoir) pigs are the intermediate hosts for NiV zoonotic cycle (Paul 2018). pigs got infection from bats, and then NiV spread proficiently among pigs. many domesticated mammals seem to be susceptible to Nipah virus. fruit bats punctured by the bat and contaminated with saliva form common source of transmission of NiV infection from bats to domestic animals. contact with sick cow was reported to have caused a case of human infection in Bangladesh. potential for a global pandemic due to NiV appears to stem from several features. availability of susceptible human population, several viral strains withpotential for person-to-person transmission, and error-prone nature of RNA virus replication. a monoclonal antibody-based antigen capture ELISA has been reported. indirect IgG ELISAs have been developed for testing swine and human sera. a sandwich ELISA employing a rabbit polyclonal anti-NiV G protein has been reported. ELISA has also been developed using recombinant full length N protein and truncated G protein for detecting virus specific antibodies in serum samples of porcines. such ELISAs are valuable diagnostic methods for seromonitoring of swine population. a novel one step qRT-PCR assay targeting the intergenic region separating F and G genes has been reported for quantitative detection of NiV replicative viral RNA that avoids viral mRNA amplification. advances in the field of diagnosis of emerging zoonotic pathogens following an integrated One Health approach need to be explored optimally. if vaccination of livestock is made cheap it may prove to be successful in certain regions. CEPI aims to develop two new experimental vaccines within five years. it is anticipated that field efficacy studies of such vaccines could be done during massive outbreaks. Nipah-like particles (NiV-VLPs) composed of three NiV proteins G, F and M derived from mammalian cells have been produced and validated as vaccine in BALB/c mice. the immunogenicity of the vaccine was high because the VLPs possess the native characteristics of the virus including the size, morphology and surface composition. predicted peptides can potentially stimulate T-cell-mediated immunity. predicted peptides could have utility in developing epitope-based vaccines to counter NiV. the development of animal models of Nipah virus is another priority. this will help in employing successful immunization strategies (both active as well as passive) by targeting the envelope glycoprotein of the virus. vCP2208 carried the NiV F 108 PFU Landrace female pigs Intramuscular Boosted 14 days postvaccination 2.5 105 PFU Intranasal challenge Weingartl et al. 2006 Adeno-associated virus (AAV) NiV G 2.1010/1.1010 genome particles Balb/c male mice Intra muscular or intra-dermal One Booster 104 PFU Intraperitoneal Ploquin et al. Nipah virus-like particles (NiV-VLPs) are adjuvanted with Alum (50 g -Alhydrogel 2%); MPLA (15 g) and CpG ODN (40 g) 30 g VLP. a recombinant vaccine based on vesicular stomatitis virus (replication-competent) has been developed. the control is much tougher in regions where contaminated date palm sap is the primary source of NiV. nocturnal activities of bats such as drinking from, defecating or urinating in the date palm sap collection jars have become evident through infrared cameras. measures to prevent the access of bat to the sap stream of the date palm tree and shaved surface can minimize the risk of human exposure to NiV in such settings. full genome sequencing is possible due to availability of improved DNA sequencing technology. this can yield insights on the host genetics conferring susceptibility of certain primate species to NiV infection. active surveillance and contact tracing are important along with quarantine of health professionals and peopleat high risk. a rapid detection and characterization of infectious agents is being emphasized worldwide. biosafety and biosecurity measures need to be specially focused so as to prevent accidental and/or deliberate discharge of high risk pathogens especially with zoonotic potential. there is an urgent need to create multidisciplinary teams as far as \u2018One Health\u2019 approach is concerned. deka and Morshed (2018) carried out a study implementing certain means of modelling the risk of regional disease transmission. such approaches help in measuring niche similarity between the ecological features and the Pteropus bats (as reservoirs of NiV) a monoclonal antibody targeting the viral G glycoprotein has been shown beneficial in a ferret model of the NiV disease. a successful outcome of an in vivo study using an investigational therapeutic, i.e. fully humanized monoclonal antibody m102.4 against NiV. it has been noticed in the recent outbreak in Kerala in south India that the antiviral drug ribavirincould be explored as anti-NiV agent. ribavirin has been proven to be beneficial in case of infection caused by other Henipaviruses. but it has got dispute due to its inefficacy in case of infection caused by other Henipaviruses. antifusion lipopeptides are in vogue for treating severe complications. monoclonal antibodies of mouse origin or polyclonal antiserum are used for passive immunotherapy in hamster model. it is to be noted that when neurological as well as respiratory troubles prevail use of antiviral drug viz., ribavirin along with intensive support care as well as immunomodulators are effective. surveillance system concerning the animal health must be strengthened through a \u2018One Health\u2019 approach so that public health authorities can be warned at an early stage. the practical utility of this understanding will be reflected in the entry of Nipah viral vaccines into clinical trials in humans. such understanding will be great aid in developing techniques along with therapeutics for treatment of infected subjects. prevention of such zoonotic disease in agricultural workers should be a priority. collaborative efforts such as CEPI and biotech companies will accelerate the vaccine or therapeutic development for NiV."}
