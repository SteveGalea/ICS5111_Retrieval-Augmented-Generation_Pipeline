{"summary": "a bat Virus closely related to the direct progenitor of human SARS-CoV is infected with genetically diverse strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses. none of them are known to be the direct progenitor of human SARS-CoV. this study provides further evidence to support the bat origin of SARS-CoV. nuclear proteins EBNA2, EBNA3A, EBNA3B, and EBNA3C are viral transcription factors that alter host gene expression to exert critical EBV transforming effects in vitro and in EBV-associated cancers. these EBNAs target RBPJ, a DNA-binding protein in the Notch signaling pathway, but they regulate different genes. pTfh cells harbor HIV DNA in virologically suppressed patients on antiviral regimens containing integrase inhibitors. pTfh cells can be induced to express HIV p24 Gag protein."}
