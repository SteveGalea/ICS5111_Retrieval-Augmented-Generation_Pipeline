{"summary": "two novel tick-borne phleboviruses (TBPVs), severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) and heartland virus (HRTV) have been shown to be correlated with severe human disease. in 2014, shen et al. isolated one viral strain that displayed a strong evolutionary relationship with SFTSV from Dermacentor nuttalli ticks in the Xinjiang uygur autonomous region of china. ed minus-strand RNA fragments comprise small (S), medium (M) and large (L) RNA fragments. GP protein encoded by GTV-M gene is cut into two mature Gn and Gc proteins. however, knowledge about the antigenicity and immunodominant region of the GTV-encoded protein is still lacking. fine BCEs on human zona pellucida glycoprotein-3 (hZP3) and human hZP4 were identified using rabbit pAbs [21, 23], and especially to reveal three fine rabbit IgG-epitomes of human papilloma virus type 58 (HPV58) E6, E7 and L1 proteins for the first time. a lot of fine BCEs on the crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV pXXGST-2 expressing GST188 protein and pXXGST-3 expressing short peptide fusion protein were kindly provided by Professor Wan-xiang Xu from Shanghai Institute of Planned Parenthood Research. three new Zealand rabbits were immunized at two-week intervals according to the conventional animal immune method. biosynthetic short peptides To conduct epitope mapping of Gn from GTV strain DXM, we used a modified BSP method. the Gn with 431 amino acid residues was first truncated into fifty-six of overlapping 16mer-peptides with an overlap of 7 aa each other. all DNA fragments encoding each short peptide were cloned into the pXXGST-3 vector expressing GST188-tagged protein in E. coli. each r-clone was incubated in 3 mL LB medium containing 50 g/mL ampicillin at 37\u00b0C and 220 rpm/min overnight. the next day, 30 L of overnight bacteria culture was placed into 3 mL of fresh LB medium, grown at 30\u00b0 the NC membrane was washed with TBS-T and the blotted bands on it were developed by using the enhanced chemiluminescence imager (Japan). the location of experimentally identified BCEs in the three-dimensional structure (3D) of the Gn protein was analyzed by PyMOLTM software (http://pymol.org/2/) animal serum samples were collected using random sampling. r-plasmid of pET-32a-Gn (aa 1\u2013431) was previously constructed and stored by our research group. anti-rabbit and mouse anti-goat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were purchased from Beijing TransGen Biotech, Co., Ltd. (China) other reagents and materials DNA ligase and restriction enzymes BamH I and Sal I (Takara Co., Ltd, Dalian, China), unstained or pre-stained molecular weight markers (QIAGEN, Duesseldorf, Germany) overlapping 16mer-peptides spanning Gn1 (b), Gn2 (c) and Gn3 sequences (d) each fragment contained a BamH I site at the 5' end, a Sal I cleavage site linked with a TAA termination codon at the 3' end. all DNA fragments encoding each short peptide were cloned into the pXXGST-3 vector expressing GST188-tagged protein in E. coli t analysis After an r-clone was induced, its supernatant was removed by centrifugation in 2 mL of bacterial culture medium. cells were re-suspended by adding 160 L of 1PBS. then 40 L of 5loading buffer was added and immersed in a water bath at 95\u00b0C for 10 min. the location of experimentally identified BCEs in the three-dimensional structure (3D) of the Gn protein was analyzed by PyMOLTM software. the prediction of secondary structure was based on Garnier and Robson [28] as well as Chou and Fasman [29] the hydrophilic scheme, flexible regimen, surface accessibility regimen and antigenicity index were analyzed and predicted. the rabbit antiserum against GTV-Gn was used in Western blotting. the reactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. the rabbit antiserum against GTV-Gn was used in Western blotting. the cells of each r-clone were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. the rabbit antiserum against GTV-Gn (1:2500 dilution) was used in Western blotting. 1 in P1 was identified using seven of 10mer-peptides (P136-P142) followed by five of 12mer-peptides (P143-P147) another fine nonapeptide epitope (CHKDGIGPC) in P31 was mapped using seven of 10mer-peptides (P148-P154) followed by two of 9mer-peptides (P155, P156), which the latter was to be used for its BCE minimal motif identification. rabbit antiserum against GTV-Gn (1:2500 dilution) was used in Western blotting. each mapped BCE minimal motif was determined according to the common sequence present in several overlapping peptides recognized by rabbit pAbs against Gn. four BCE peptides of EGn1, EGn2, EGn6 and EGn7 can be used as candidate BCEs. Western blot analysis of mapped BCEs and APs using sheep sera. CK, Negative control of GST188 protein. CP, Positive control of P1. Sequence analysis and 3D localization of mapped epitopes. five BCE motifs were found to be of high sequence similarity among the 10 SFTSV strains. the 8 BCE motifs have amino acid mutations, which are specifically shown in Fig 7. the EGn5 and EGn6 BCEs were completely conserved within 10/9 SFTSV strains. s recognized by pAbs are highlighted, and the variable aa residue within the BCE motif are highlighted in red. each BCE or AP was labeled with different color, for which two overlapping residues between EGn3 and EGn4 was shown in yellow. the predicted results indicated that there is no transmembrane domain and signal peptide sequence in Gn1-431. the motifs indicate that seven BCEs and two APs were located on a well helix-angle-helix structure. locations on 3D structure of mapped BCEs and APs on molecular surface were shown in different colors. r-clone were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. the rabbit antiserum against GTV-Gn was used in Western blotting. the reactive bands in Western blotting were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. EGn6 (QTKWIQ), of which two were located in P21 due to existence of a non-reactive P80 between P77-P79 and P81-P83, one in P25 and one shared by P29 and P30 respectively. the cell proteins of each r-clone were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. a fine nonapeptide epitope was mapped using seven of 10mer-peptides (P136-P142) followed by five of 12mer-peptides (P143-P147), which was a BCE with 11 aa (PIICEGLTHSN) another fine nonapeptide epitope (CHKDGIGPC) in P31 was mapped using seven of 10mer-peptides (P148-P154) followed by two of 9mer-peptides ( Western blot analysis for mapping fine epitopes in each reactive 16mer-peptide. rabbit antiserum against GTV-Gn (1:2500 dilution) was used in Western blotting. three peptides of EGn3, AP-8 and AP-9 were not recognized by sheep positive serum. results indicate that there is better similarity of the immune response to GTV-Gn between rabbit and sheep. four peptides of EGn1, EGn2, EGn6 and EGn7 can be used as candidate BCEs. five BCE motifs were found to be of high sequence similarity among the 10 SFTSV strains. the 8 BCE motifs have amino acid mutations, which are specifically shown in Fig 7. the EGn2 and EGn6 BCEs were completely conserved within 10/9 SFTSV strains. the sequence analysis was based on the ClustalW program. the nine fine BCEs and APs recognized by pAbs are highlighted. the variable aa residue within the BCE motif are highlighted in red. philicity, surface probability, and antigenicity index for GTV-Gn were taken into consideration. motifs indicate that seven BCEs and two APs were located on a well helix-angle-helix structure. the figures were generated using the PyMOLTM molecular graphics system. the key residue responsible for hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with an antibody is conserved in GTV- and SFTSV-Gn proteins. there are still no reports on the antigenic region of the GTV-Gn. epitope mapping of the Gn was performed by using rabbit pAbs and the improve BSP method [22] 58 L1-VLP could react with 13 of 18 BCEs mapped by rabbit pAbs to r-HPV58-L1 [24]. all rabbit IgG-BCEs on NPs of CCHFV/PPRV could react with the antisera from sheep CCHFV or PPRV-infected. antibodies to three of -hCG BCEs present in a chimeric peptide immunogen all were generated in both rabbit all mapped BCEs are located in the hydrophilic domains. six of the nine identified BCEs from this study are consistent with the predicted result for the antigenic BCEs. epitope prediction tool combined with biosynthetic peptide method is reliable. six BCEs of EGn1, EGn2, EGn4, EGn5, EGn6 and EGn7 were specifically recognized by antibody-positive sera from sheep with GTV infection in Western blotting. the EGn3, AP-8 and AP-9 did not. it is suggested the antigenic similarity and differences between both rabbit and sheep species. these results improve our understanding of the antigenic characteristics of the GTV-Gn protein. they will also contribute to the development of GTV/SFTSV detection agents and preventive GTV r-peptide vaccines based on epitopes."}
