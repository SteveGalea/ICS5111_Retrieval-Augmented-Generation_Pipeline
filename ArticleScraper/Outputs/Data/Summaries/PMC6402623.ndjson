{"summary": "a tool for predicting the severity of CAP has been developed. mortality of viral CAP has not been well validated by the pneumonia severity index. in adults, viral CAP has a reported mortality from 1% to 39%. all patients aged 18 years admitted between January 2013 and December 2015, with suspected respiratory viral infections (N = 3,743) were studied. we excluded 2,309 subjects who had no identifiable radiologic pneumonia findings. cDNA was synthesized from each of the extracted RNA samples using a Viral Gene-spinTM Viral DNA/RNA Extraction Kit. cDNA was synthesized from each of the extracted RNA samples with a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermal cycler. blood culture was performed at every pneumonia patient. Chest radiography was performed on all patients admitted to the hospital. radiographic interpretation was performed for all cases by radiologists. additional laboratory investigations were performed based on a routine blood test. nasopharyngeal specimens were collected using flocked swabs. cDNA was synthesized from each of the extracted RNA samples with cDNA Synthesis Premix. blood culture was performed at every pneumonia patient. adenovirus(AF), influenza viruses A and B, RSV A, RSV B, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 3, Rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus 229E, coronavirus OC43, and bocavirus. Pneumonia severity index (PSI) consisted of demographics including age and sex, co-morbidity, physical examination, and laboratory findings. we contacted patients or their families by phone to identify survival and clinical information if the patients were not followed up regularly. bacterial pathogens were detected in patient sputum at rates of 24.9% and 23.5% in both virus-detected and virus non-detected CAP patients. the detection of bacteria in blood was almost the same between the two groups, 9.9% vs 10.0%. 131 (11.2) 0.83 Respiratory rate > = 30/min 24 (9.2) 106 (9.0) 0.93 Systolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg 7 (2.7) 70 (6.0) 0.03 Temperature 35\u00b0C or > = 40\u00b0C, n (%) 3 (1.1) 17 (1.4) 0.70 Laboratory findings Blood urea nitrogen > 30 mg/dl 70 (26.8) 298 (25.4) 0.63 Glucose > = 250 mg/dl 24 there were no significant differences in mortality for either group outside of PSI Class III. the mortality rate was 27 times that of the PSI class I. the crude 30-day mortality of virus-detected and virus not detected pneumonia was 27.2% and 25.8% respectively. 62 were influenza A, 18 were influenza B, 65 were rhinovirus, 35 were respiratory syncytial virus, 25 were parainfluenza, 17 were coronavirus, 7 were bocavirus, and 5 were adenovirus. bacterial pathogens A sputum specimen from 936 (65.2%) and 1333 (92.9%) were obtained. pathogen in sputum was detected in 65 (24.9%) patients among 261 virus detected CAP. pathogen in sputum was detected in 276 (24.9%) patients among 1,173 virus not detected CAP. the mean age of the group of patients diagnosed and hospitalized for CAP was 68.5 years. 261 (18%) were found to have a viral etiology. the remaining 1,173 (82%) had no virus detected. age (years) mean (SD) 68.5 (14.3) 68.3 (13.9) 0.78 Age 50 yr (%) 27 (10.3) 117 (9.9) 0.89 Resident of long-term care facilities, n (%) 21 (8.0) 92 (7.8) 0.91 Coexisting conditions Malignancy, n (%) 45 (17.2) 177 (15.0) 0.38 Congestive heart failure, n (%) 29 (11.1) 105 (8.9) 0.27 Cerebrovascular 208 (79.7) 910 (77.6) 0.45 Arterial pH 7.35 31 (11.9) 136 (11.6) 0.89 Bacterial pathogen detected in sputum, n (%) 65 (24.9) 276 (23.5) 0.63 Bacterial pathogen detected in blood, n (%) 26 (9.9) 118 (10.0) 0.96 PSI score, mean (SD) 110.2 (33.0) 110.1 (35.2) 0.95 Radiologic findings Bilateral Chest the presence of viruses did not affect prognosis and PSI classes had a significant effect on mortality at 30 days. the crude 30-day mortality of virus-detected and virus not-detected CAP was 27.2% and 25.8%, respectively. virus detected (N = 261, dotted line) and virus not detected (N = 1,173, black line) the crude 30-day mortality of virus-detected and virus not detected pneumonia was 27.2% and 25.8% respectively. two types of respiratory viruses were detected in 7 cases. pathogen in blood was detected in 26 (9.9%) patients among 1,173 virus not detected CAP. gram-positive pathogens were detected in 12 patients (4.5%), gram-negative pathogens in 14 (5.3%). despite respiratory virus infection, S. aureus was most common isolated pathogen either sputum and blood. the presence of virus in adult CAP patients did not affect mortality rate compared to non-viral CAP. the virus-detected CAP was significantly lower in the PSI class III group than in the virus non-detected CAP. this results suggest that viral infection has negligible effect on prognosis when co-morbidities are small or clinical features are not severe. in this study, 25% of sputum positive bacterial cultures occurred in patients with virus-detected and virus non-detected CAP. there was no bacteremia rate differences between virus-detected and virus non-detected CAP. our study suggests antibiotics could be considered even if viral infection is suspected in CAP. I class is a crucial factor for assessing the prognosis of patients with CAP, regardless of respiratory virus detection."}
