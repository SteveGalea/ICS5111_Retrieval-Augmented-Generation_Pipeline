{"summary": "skin biopsies from local sites of herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) can show infiltrates of inflammatory cells several months after macroscopic healing. genital inflammation may contribute to increased HIV susceptibility on sexual exposure. virus 2 (HSV-2) infects genital epithelial cells and is then transported via sensory nerves to the sacral root ganglion. cellular infiltrates consisting of inflammatory cells that persisted for months after healing. daily antiviral therapy against HSV-2 reduces viral replication. occludin and junctional adhesion molecules have been identified in foreskin keratinocytes and foreskin tissue. claudin-1, occludin and E-cadherin have been identified in foreskin keratinocytes and foreskin tissue. claudin-1 is a major adhesion protein and is expressed on the basal side of the tight junction protein complex. samples were randomly selected before circumcision and stratified by HSV-2 serological status. RNA was converted in equal dilutions to cDNA in a single reverse transcriptase reaction using superscript reverse transcriptase. DNA was stored at 20\u00b0C. each sample and control was run in duplicates. ct values were normalised to ubiquitin C. the tissue sections were washed and blocked in PBS containing 0.1% Saponin, 0.1% BSA-C and 2% normal donkey serum for 30 min at room temperature. the sections were washed and stained with either Alexa Fluor-488 conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody or Alexa fluor-594 donkey-anti-rabbit IgG antibody. samples were randomly selected from each stratum and matched for age (18\u201320 and 21\u201324 years) the STD screening included a history of discharge and previously diagnosed sexually transmitted infections (STIs) DNA was stored at 20\u00b0C. each sample and control was run in duplicates. ct values for target cDNA were normalised to ubiquitin C (UBC) the tissue sections were washed and blocked in PBS containing 0.1% Saponin, 0.1% BSA-C and 2% normal donkey serum for 30 min at room temperature. the sections were then stained with either Alexa Fluor-488 conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody or Alexa fluor-594 donkey-anti-rabbit IgG antibody. data on sociodemographic, behavioural risks, and STIs for the two study groups were statistically similar. except for educational attainment and number of sex partners which were higher in the HSV-2 seropositive group. mRNA expression levels of cytokines and immunoregulatory receptors IL-1, IL-6, TNF-, IFN-, CCL5, CCR5, HLA-DR and 7 as well as of IgA were similar in the study groups. mRNA expression levels of the phenotypic cellular markers CD4, CD3 and CD8, the activation marker CD69, the CLRs Langerin, DC-SIGN and mannose receptor did not differ significantly between the study groups the HSV-2 seropositive men had significantly lower expression of claudin-1 (p=0.008) and similar expression of the other three markers (p>0.05). claudin-1 was clearly present in the foreskin epithelium, but the protein was not evenly located in all areas. study population Foreskin tissues were obtained from HSV-2 seronegative (n=43) and HSV-2 seropositive (n=43) men undergoing elective circumcision. the men had no clinical or laboratory signs of genital ulcers at time of circumcision. 0 22 (51.2) 15 (34.9) 1 21 (48.8) 20 (46.5) 2 or more 0 (0.0) 8 (18.6) Frequency of condom use, past 6 months 0.154 Never 11 (25.6) 14 (32.6) Sometimes 21 (48.8) 25 (58.1) Always 11 (25.6) 4 (9.3) Gonorrhea or chlamydia infection at baseline 1 (2.3) 3 (7.0) 0.616 *Fisher's exact test was used when cell herpes simplex virus 2 seronegative (n=43) and seropositive men (n=43) were compared for mRNA expression of E-cadherin, ZO-1 and occludin in foreskin tissue samples. the HSV-2 seropositive men had significantly lower expression of claudin-1 (p=0.008) and similar expression of the other three markers (p>0.05). images were collected with a 40/1.25 objective (scale bar=50 m) epithelial localisation of claudin-1 was assessed in the foreskin tissues by immunofluorescent staining. other junction proteins E-cadherin, ZO-1 and occludin also had individual patterns of expression. proteins E-cadherin, ZO-1, claudin-1 and occludin were found in the foreskin tissue samples. the distribution over the entire epithelial surface of the samples was irregular. the correlation between mRNA and protein expression of these specific epithelial markers has also been evaluated in a study of virus infection of human epithelial cells showing comparable expression levels. men with symptomatic or laboratory-confirmed genital infections were not eligible for circumcision. the HSV-2 seropositivity in our study is likely to represent previous HSV-2 lesions located on the foreskin in the majority of the participants. this does not exclude effects on additional inflammatory cytokines."}
