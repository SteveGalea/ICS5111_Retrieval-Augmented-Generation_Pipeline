{"summary": "respiratory infections are responsible for 25\u201330% of hospitalization in the military. crowded habitation, demanding physical training program, stressful working environment, and insomnia. crowded living quarters, obesity, asthma, and age group are among the major risk factors for acquiring influenza infections. human rhinoviruses are associated with lower respiratory tract infections (18, 19) there are other viruses associated with respiratory infections which are not well studied in military populations. this includes respiratory syncytial viruses (20-22), human bocaviruses (23-25), human parainfluenza viruses (26), metapneumoviruses (27), and echoviruses (28). nucleic acid extraction was performed with 200 l of each collected specimen using the ZP02003 MagPurix Viral Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit. total nucleic acids concentration and purity were evaluated using the nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer. microarray processing CLART\u00ae PneumoVir array system was used to identify genomic sequences of human respiratory viruses. hybridization happened in a low-density microarray containing triplicate probes specific to viruses. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 18 (Inc., Chicago, USA) and Microsoft Office 2013 (Excel) RT-PCR was performed in two different ready-to-use amplification tubes. biotin-labeled products were hybridized with their respective specific probes immobilized at different sites in the array. data was reported as count and percentage. all participants were male, with a mean age of 21.69 4.9 years. most prevalent complaints were sore throat (n=302; 75.5%), rhinorrhea (n=253; 63.2%), cough (n=237; 59.2%), fever (n=237; 59.2%), and nasal congestion (n=202; 50.5%) the most cases of myalgia were seen in influenza B (n=5; 62.5%) and influenza A H1N1 (n=3; 37.5%) infections respectively. the most cases of myalgia were seen in influenza B (n=5; 62.5%) and influenza A H1N1 (n=3; 37.5%) infections. CLART\u00ae Pneumovir array was used to detect 17 common respiratory viruses on 400 throat or nasopharyngeal swab specimens of Iranian military trainees which were collected during January to March 2017. rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus A, and influenza B virus have been responsible for 66% of viral respiratory infections among military trainees. symptoms, adenovirus, influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial virus were found in 35%, 19% and 14% respectively (33). viral etiology of respiratory illnesses was investigated among 7733 cases of febrile respiratory illness (FRI) using the multiplex PCR. 49% of cases were positive for viral infection and most commonly detected viruses among FRI cases were influenza A H1N1(13%), influenza B (13%), and coxsackievirus (9%). despite lack of adenovirus vaccination program in Iranian military health system, we reported a low rate of adenovirus (n=6; 1.5%) in military trainees. influenza infection tends to occur in the winter, while adenovirus infection is more likely to occur in the spring, summer, and fall seasons. samples were collected only from trainees stationed within one base. further multi-center studies with larger sample size are strongly recommended to confirm our findings."}
