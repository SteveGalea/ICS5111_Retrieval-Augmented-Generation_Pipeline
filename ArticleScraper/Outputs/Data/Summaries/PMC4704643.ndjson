{"summary": "the introduction foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infects cloven-hoofed animals. the disease has been successfully controlled by vaccination in many developing countries. many countries have controlled the disease by slaughtering infected animals. RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing that is triggered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) most studies on the use of RNAi to inhibit FMDV replication have focused exclusively on in vitro experiments using large animal models. vector-mediated interferon expression in vivo successfully inhibited FMDV replication and protected FMDV-challenged animals in some cases. the broad-spectrum efficacy of inoculation with combinational interferon-expressing vectors suggests that it may be more attractive than RNAi as a method of dealing with FMD outbreaks. the thovirus genus of the Picornaviridase family dissociates into separate pentameric subunits of around 12S each at pH values below 6.5. this instability is attributed to a cluster of his residues at the interface between the capsid's VP2 and VP3 subunits. acids such as peracetic acid and acetic acid effectively kill FMDV in vitro. selected cultures were used to ferment aqueous extracts of four herbs known to produce such agents. licorice (Glycyrrhizae Radix), Luohanguo (Siraitia grosvenorii), Chrysanthemum (Dendranthema morifolium) and tea (Camellia sinensis) all of these plants are known to produce compounds with broad-spectrum antiviral activity. the mogrosides produce a sweet taste in Chinese herbal Kombucha prepared using Luohango extracts. the mogrosides have been approved for use as dietary supplements in Japan, the United States, New Zealand and Australia. a 1:2 dilution exhibited no toxicity towards 3-day-old suckling mice. the suckling mouse-passaged swine FMDV serotype O strain O/China/99 was used in swine experiments. the kombucha culture was grown in a nutrient broth containing 50 g/L of sugar, 1 g/L of (NH4)2SO4 and 1 gram KH2PO4 and 5 g/L of tea. the resulting culture was stored at 4 \u00b0C until required for the preparation of the Chinese herbal kom the Chinese herbal kombucha was stored at 28 1 \u00b0C for 7 days. the heavy metal content of the prepared kombucha was determined using an ICPS7510 plasma emission spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan) the number of Colony Forming Units of acetic acid bacteria, yeasts, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella spp. per unit volume of the fermented kombucha was determined by the national standard of microbiological examination animals in the H, M, and L groups were treated with 3.0 l of a Chinese herbal kombucha solution daily for 13 days. the kombucha solutions were prepared by dissolving 150 g of sucrose and 3 g of NaCl in 3.0 l of a mixture of water and the Chinese herbal kombucha stock solution. animals in all groups were inoculated with 1000 SID50 of swine FMDV serotype O strain O/China/99 RT-PCR experiments were performed using the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) all results are reported relative to a FMDV-positive serum sample provided by our diagnostic department. dilution series were prepared from each serum sample in 96-well plates. 50 L of a viral solution of a fixed concentration, diluted in PBST (1:5) was then added to each well and the plate was shaken. each plate also featured four wells containing only the virus diluted in PBST and positive serum. experimental group consisting of 314 cattle belonging to 10 farmers and control group consisting of 268 cattle belonging to 11 farmers. the mouths and noses of the experimental group were sprayed with the diluted kombucha mix on a daily basis for six days. after two weeks, the number of animals in both groups showing signs of FMD was determined. the kombucha mother culture was grown in a nutrient broth containing 50 g/L of sugar, 1 g/L of (NH4)2SO4, 1 g/L of KH2PO4, and 5 g/L of tea. the resulting culture was stored at 4 \u00b0C until required for the preparation of the Chinese herbal kombucha used in the experiments. the number of Colony Forming Units of acetic acid bacteria, yeasts, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella spp. per unit volume of the fermented kombucha was determined by the National Standard of Microbiological Examination of Food Hygiene of China (GB4789.2-94, China). the pH of the kombucha was determined using an FE20 pH meter (Shanghai Mettler Toledo, China). the kombucha solutions were prepared by dissolving 150 g of sucrose and 3 g of NaCl in 3.0 l of a mixture of water and the Chinese herbal kombucha stock solution. animals in all groups were inoculated with 1000 SID50 of swine FMDV serotype O strain O/China/99 in 3 mL of PBS by intramuscular injection in the ear-root-neck area. the animals were examined daily for clinical signs of primers and probe were used: FMDV forward primer (5\u2032-CACTGGTGACAGGCTAAGG-3\u2032), FMDV reverse primer (5\u2032-CCCTTCTCAGATTCCGAGG-3\u2032), and FMDV probe (5\u2032-TGCCCTTCAGATTCCGAGGTAACA-3\u2032) a melting curve analysis of the RT-PCR products was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. serum samples were collected 3 days before the viral challenge, and on days 3 and 10 after the viral challenge. 50 L of a guinea-pig antiserum solution against FMDV type Asia-I was added to each well, diluted 1:1000 in PBST. the plates were washed and 50 L of an o-phenylenediamine solution containing H2O2 (3%W/V) was added to each well. the ensuing reaction was stopped after 15 min by adding 1.25 M H2SO4. the experimental group consisting of 314 cattle belonging to 10 farmers and a control group consisting of 268 cattle belonging to 11 farmers. the control group was sprayed with the same volume of a 0.5% peracetic acid solution. after two weeks, the number of animals in both groups showing signs of FMD was determined. test result Tolerable values according to the Chinese standards for agricultural microbial agents

contained FMDV-specific antibodies at 1 or 3 days post-challenge. clinical assessment of FMD control by spraying with Chinese herbal kombucha After two weeks, none of the animals in the experimental group exhibited symptoms of FMDV. animals in the experimental group were thus completely protected by spraying with Chinese herbal kombucha. this field results clearly demonstrate the potential of Chinese herbal kombucha as a probiotic treatment for the prevention and containment of FMD outbreaks. test result tolerable values according to the Chinese standards for agricultural microbial agents

protected by spraying with Chinese herbal kombucha. the Chinese herbal kombucha used in this work had a pH of between 2.75 and 4.5, meaning it was sufficiently acidic to kill FMDV directly. however, the organic acid content of the kombucha used in this work would not be sufficient to substantially reduce the blood pH of the animals used in the in vitro experiments. kombucha treatment promotes viral replication at high doses but suppresses it at low doses. it is therefore important to determine the optimal dose for use in field trials. the successful use of Chinese herbal kombucha to suppress FMDV outbreaks remains unclear. results obtained in this work provide evidence for existence of the first and third lines of defense. large scale field trial of treatment with Chinese herbal kombucha as a preventative treatment for FMD in cattle was conducted in 2011. small scale experiments on the use of Chinese herbal kombucha were conducted between 2010 and 2012 on three small farms. some microorganisms in the kombucha culture (acetic bacteria and yeast) continue reproducing after application, producing acids and killing or inhibiting the reproduction of FMDV. kombucha is likely to have broad spectrum antiviral activity against FMDV because its mechanisms of inhibition stem from its organic acid content and various active compounds produced by four different plants. the control group (268 cows belonging to 11 farmers) was treated with a 1:4 dilution of Chinese herbal kombucha. after two weeks, none of the animals in the experimental group exhibited symptoms of FMDV. animals in the experimental group were thus completely protected by spraying with Chinese herbal kombucha. outbreaks on smaller scales."}
