{"summary": "interleukin-35 (IL-35) is a recently discovered cytokine that plays a role in immune suppression. the cytokine has been identified as a member of the IL-12 family. IL-12 and IL-23 are both considered pro-inflammatory cytokines. interleukin-35, however, was identified as an inhibitory cytokine in 2007. IL-35 is secreted by regulatory T cells and B cells. the rapid growth of IL-35 literature renders identifying new developments and emerging trends in IL-35 research difficult. CiteSpace provides a variety of functions to help understand network and historical patterns. it is expected that CiteSpace could be used to identify emerging trends and hotspots of IL-35 research. there were 350 (84.13%) papers that had been cited at least once. the number of publications and citations on il-35 increased significantly in the past decade. inflammatory Cytokines PLoS One 2.77 110 9 Gregory S. Whitehead 2012 IL-35 production by inducible costimulator (ICOS)-positive regulatory T cells reverses established IL-17-dependent allergic airways disease. the maximum number of papers published in Cytokine was 19 followed by PLoS One (n = 16), the Journal of Immunology (n = 14), and Frontiers in Immunology (n = 10). the most publications originated from Tianjin Medical University (n = 17), followed by St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital (n = 15), and the National Institutes of Health NIH USA (n = 14). top 10 prolifc countries publishing paper on IL-35. the mean Silhouette was 0.8258 (>0.5), indicating that the homogeneity of clusters was acceptable. the largest cluster in the visualization is #0 job profile, followed by #1 antitumor activity, #2 turning promiscuous protein, and #3 IL-12 family cytokine. the number of published research papers increased dramatically from 2009 (n = 6) to 2018 (n = 89) there were 350 (84.13%) papers that had been cited at least once. the number of publications and citations of these papers increased significantly in the past decade. ukemia by haploidentical natural killer cells is improved using IL-2 diphtheria toxin fusion protein Blood 15.1 149 7 Irina Kochetkova 2010 IL-35 Stimulation of CD39(+) Regulatory T cells Confers Protection against Collagen II-Induced Arthritis via the Production of IL-10 The Journal of Immunology 4.54 133 8 Xinyuan Li 2012 IL-35 Is a Novel Responsive over 500 research institutions had published 416 articles on IL-35. 118 papers had been published by the top 10 research institutes. top 10 prolifc countries publishing paper on IL-35. Figure 2 shows the top 10 most frequently appearing research areas in IL-35 papers from 2009 to 2018. the top 10 most frequently appearing research areas in IL-35 studies from 2009 to 2018. the strongest citation bursts keywords were as follows: \u201ccentral nervous system,\u201d \u201cdendritic cell\u201d and \u201cIL-27\u201d. the larger the node size indicated the higher the keyword frequency. the red citation ring indicates a sudden increase of citations over a period of time. the color corresponds to older research, the yellow or orange color to new research. cluster 1 (antitumor activity), cluster 2 (emerging role), and cluster 7 (regulatory B cell) were the newest research. IL-35 promotes inflammation, autoimmunity, and the maintenance of the fine equilibrium required for infectious tolerance. the top three research frontiers of IL-35 were as follows: (1) 'infectious tolerance' IL-35 was found to be associated with central nervous system demyelination, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and the control of host responses following central nervous system viral infection. a study suggested that the level of IL-35 in patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders was low. this might be an important biomarker of the severity of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders. conceived and designed the experiments, contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools, authored or reviewed drafts of the paper. the raw data is available in the Supplemental File."}
