{"summary": "emergence of zoonotic diseases have contributed to dominant global health narratives around health securitisation and pandemic preparedness. a decade later, one health advocates face increasing pressure to translate the approach from theory into action. the unprecedented financial and political response to avian influenza at the turn of the 21st century facilitated the development of global intersectoral alliances. there is currently a strong drive to maintain the momentum and alliances established during the Global Response to Avian Influenza (GRAI) advocates promoting One Health as an approach towards various other aspects of international and regional health governance are increasingly difficult to find. a total of 32 Key Informant Interviews were held in three african contexts. participants were selected using a snowball sampling technique. a type of purposive sampling was deemed the most sensible - and in many cases the only available - technique. interviews were secured from a wide variety of sectors and ministerial levels. the semi-structured approach allowed for a certain degree of flexibility to reflect respondents' areas of expertise and experience. several key themes exploring intersectoral collaboration in the context of disease control were used as a general interview guide. trypanosomiasis manifests in humans as either an acute or chronic form caused by T. br. rhodesiense and T. br. gambiense respectively. the two forms have been confined to separate geographical foci in Uganda. more recently, country-wide movements of infected cattle have fuelled fears of disease convergence. the 1988 epidemic quickly brought down cases by 1990 because vets, medics, vector control and researchers were all in the same area using known amounts of money. the decision to house COCTU in MAAIF resulted from the major drive for trypanosomiasis control by the agricultural sector at the time. Ugandan ownership and high-level political endorsement of COCTU demonstrates how one health success is likely much more sustainable when owned and paid for nationally. the majority of One Health activities have been to date. the government was giving money before they were even asked to. one health in Nigeria currently shows \u201cvery good possibilities\u201d (Key Informant 3, Nigeria) this is significant given the logistical challenges of human and animal health service delivery in the country's vast rural areas. the medical sector appears yet to be convinced. rabies in Tanzania is widespread in africa, contributing to an estimated 23 000 deaths per year despite the existence of an effective toolbox for control [18],[19]. a major question in the recent flurry of one health activity is how localised academic and scientific projects funded by international donors can move into wider policy spheres in the africa context. Serengeti researchers hoped to generate sufficient state ownership of the process to ensure canine vaccination could be scaled up to other parts of the country and, if possible, the region. the challenges of institutionalising country wide elimination Key informants emphasised that moving from localised research projects to a large-scale elimination project embedded within national frameworks and budgets presented logistical challenges. research plays an important role in driving One Health forwards. but results require appropriate packaging to ensure uptake. one lesson from this case study is the importance of identifying individual government \u2018champions\u2019 to drive institutionalisation process. Tanzanian case study details challenges of rolling out small scale research projects into nationally funded country wide programmes. the importance of gaining the support of national \u201cchampions\u201d is illustrated as a key requirement, which remains a common denominator for successful zoonotic disease control across much of the continent. trypanosomiasis manifests in humans as either an acute or chronic form caused by T. br. rhodesiense and T. br. gambiense respectively. the two forms have been confined to separate geographical foci in Uganda. more recently, country-wide movements of infected cattle have fuelled fears of disease convergence. the 1988 epidemic quickly brought down cases by 1990 because vets, medics, vector control and researchers were all in the same area using known amounts of money. the decision to house COCTU in MAAIF resulted from the major drive for trypanosomiasis control by the agricultural sector at the time. the co-ordinating office for the control of trypanosomiasis in Uganda (COCTU) is the secretariat of a permanently funded interministerial platform. the co-ordinating office for the control of trypanosomiasis in Uganda (COCTU) is the secretariat of a permanently funded interministerial platform, mandated to co-ordinate policy and oversee all human and African trypanosomiasis control in the country. the 1988 epidemic quickly brought down cases by 1990 because vets, medics, vector control and researchers were all in the same area using known amounts of money. those involved in the joint intervention depicted COCTU as a \u201cgood arrangement\u201d to sustainably promote the added sectoral benefits arising from a One Health approach towards HAT control in the country. one health success is likely much more sustainable when owned and paid for nationally. high-level political backing was deemed a key element for one health success. nigeria Avian Influenza emergency control preparedness and response project. one health in Nigeria shows \u201cvery good possibilities\u201d (Key Informant 3, Nigeria) it appears far from institutionalised, particularly at the local government level. unless one health policy is agreed and facilitated across all tiers of government, benefits will be lost where they could be most significant. one health in Nigeria shows \u201cvery good possibilities\u201d (Key Informant 3, Nigeria) it appears far from institutionalised, particularly at the local government level. unless policy is agreed and facilitated across all tiers of government, benefits will be lost where they could be most significant. in the serengeti to the Selous Rabies research has been conducted in and around the serengeti ecosystem since the 1990's. rabies research has been conducted in and around the ecosystem since the 1990's, driven by initial concerns regarding rabies outbreaks in the endangered wild dogs. national budgets mobilised alongside the $4 million USD BMGF budget. serengeti researchers hoped to generate sufficient state ownership of the process. move from localised research projects to large-scale elimination project presented logistical challenges. research plays an important role in driving One Health forwards. but results require appropriate packaging to ensure uptake. one lesson from this case study is the importance of identifying individual government \u2018champions\u2019 to drive institutionalisation process. research has been conducted in and around the Serengeti ecosystem since the 1990's. a series of campaigns over the next decade demonstrated the willingness of dog owners to vaccinate against rabies. this corresponded with reductions in the demand for post-exposure prophylactic treatment (PEP) in humans.
