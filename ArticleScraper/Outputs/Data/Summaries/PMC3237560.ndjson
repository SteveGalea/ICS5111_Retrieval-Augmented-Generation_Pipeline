{"summary": "management interventions to control infectious diseases in wildlife populations may influence individual behaviours, such as dispersal. behavioural processes underlying disease transmission are notoriously difficult to study. badgers have been culled as part of attempts to control disease in cattle. lowland England are often organised into relatively stable, mixed-sex social groups [17], [18] evidence from field studies suggests that this pattern of social organisation mitigates the spread of bTB between groups. disease transmission rates between social groups are lower than those within groups [19], [20]. evidence that badger culling operations can cause social perturbation has been reported from badger populations in Gloucestershire, UK [21], [23], [25], [40] and during the RBCT [22], [41], [42]. findings have raised the possibility that perturbation effects may have exacerbated disease spread within badger populations. r captures with release were made in the culling (n = 481) and non-culling (n = 182) study areas. overall rate of recapture was 29.7%, approximately equal for males and females. estimated overall density of badgers varied between 1.2 and 6.9 badgers per km2 in the culled population. prevalence increased in both sites post-culling, from 5.2% to 15% in the treatment site, and from 2.7% to 15.9% in the control site. bTB prevalence in Removed (R), Neighbouring (N), Other (O) and Control (C) badger social groups before and after culling. TB: four males and one female in the treatment; and one female in the control population. radio-collars remained attached to badgers for an average of 230 days. home range size, as measured by 95% minimum convex polygons, varied seasonally. the effect of culling phase on the size of badger home range core areas, based on 50% kernels, varied between study areas. in the control population, core areas were smaller than in the treatment population and decreased through the culling phases. overlaps in autumn02 and winter03 were zero for treatment groups. no data were available for overlaps in winter02 and spring02. number of home ranges from different groups with which each badger overlapped in summer also varied among group types in the treatment population. nine post-culling IGMs were made to Removed groups. five were from Neighbouring social groups, and four from Removed groups. social group type influenced the probability of individuals moving from a group. 40 individuals were found to be positive for M. bovis (excreting) from one or more clinical samples. no statistically significant difference in the detected prevalence of badgers excreting M. bovis between treatment and control sites. prevalence increased in both sites post-culling, from 5.2% to 15% in the treatment site. a statistically significant increase in detected M. bovis among cubs in the treatment population following culling. only one excreting individual identified out of 101 cubs captured before culling. eight out of 76 cubs tested positive for bTB after culling. size of summer range areas of badgers from Removed groups increased between pre- and inter-culling phases. in Neighbouring groups, home range areas decreased from 22.0 Ha (sd = 26.2 Ha) to 10.0 (sd = 11.3 Ha), remaining low post-culling. no statistically significant difference in badger core area size between social group types with respect to culling. effect of culling phase on proportional overlap between summer home ranges varied significantly among group types. overlaps in Autumn02 and Winter03 were zero for treatment groups. radio-tracking of six animals from five adjacent social groups revealed no home range overlaps. inter-group movements (IGM) by radio-collared badgers twice out of 891 below-ground positions between 2001 and 2003. both were in the treatment population and were made by males to groups immediately neighbouring their original groups. the size of the donor social group influenced IGM probability (W1 = 4.37; P = 0.04) animals were more likely to move from larger groups. IGM probability was not influenced by an individual's sex. nine of the movers were adults and only four were cubs. the prevalence of detectable M. bovis infection from culture of clinical samples increased from 1% to 14% in Neighbouring groups following culling. this usually involved the movement of animals into groups that had been subjected to culling either from other culled groups or their unculled immediate neighbours. the previously reported absence of association between post-culling bTB infection and bite wounding in cubs suggests perturbation may act indirectly. post-culling disturbance of the social structure of the badger population could potenitally cause sufficient stress to individuals to induce immunosuppression. IGMs in the control area, and prior to culling in the treatment area, were rare. animals were more likely to move from larger groups, with no effect of sex or age. this contrasts with the observations of Tuyttens et al. in north Nibley. study confirms and provides signifcant further details on epidemiological patterns emerging after badger culling. the treatment badger population was positioned within the reactive culling area of the RBCT triplet E (51\u00b0 27\u2032N 2\u00b0 25\u2032W), occupying an area of 37.3 km2. Defra performed three badger culling operations in November 2002. 38 badgers were removed from 14 social groups, January 2003. 33 badgers were removed from 13 social groups. badgers were selected for radio-collaring based on existing collars within the same social group, spatial proximity of collared animals from adjacent social groups, and sex. clusters were initiated by the opportunistic capture of two more adults of different sex from a social group. on subsequent trapping occasions, adults captured from these social groups, and their immediate neighbours, were collared preferentially. badger positions were established either visually, with the aid of image intensifying equipment or by triangulation. only badger presence could be determined, as failure to locate an animal at a particular sett initiated a survey of all surrounding setts. social groups were classified according to their use of setts and the proximity of those setts to culling operations. radio-tracking data were collected throughout the study, from Nov 2001 to Dec 2003, except during culling operations. comparisons of individual movements before and after culling were adjusted for season, with spring and summer comparisons being made relative to culling in Nov 02 and Jan 03. study areas were located on the borders of Wiltshire, Somerset and south Gloucestershire in south-west England. treatment badger population was positioned within the reactive culling area of the RBCT triplet E (51\u00b0 27\u2032N 2\u00b0 25\u2032W), occupying an area of 37.3 km2. 38 active setts were identified in the treatment and control study areas respectively, giving a density of approximately two setts km2 in both areas. Defra performed three badger culling operations in November 2002 (in which 38 badgers were removed from 14 social groups) and January 2003 (in which six badgers were removed from four social groups) badgers were selected for radio-collaring based on existing collars within the same social group, spatial proximity of collared animals from adjacent social groups, and sex. clusters were initiated by the opportunistic capture of two more adults of different sex from a social group. on subsequent trapping occasions, adults captured from these social groups were collared preferentially. positional data were recorded on 110,000 scale maps or with global positioning system (GPS) receivers. only badger presence could be determined, as failure to locate an animal at a sett did not necessarily demonstrate absence. social groups were classified according to their use of setts and proximity of those setts to culling operations. radio-tracking data were grouped into seasons: spring (Mar, Apr, May), summer (Jun, Jul, Aug), autumn (Sep, Oct, Nov), and winter (Dec, Jan, Jan, Feb). comparisons of individual movements before and after culling were adjusted for season, with spring and summer comparisons being made relative to culling in Nov 02 and Jan 03. rs were defined as 95% minimum convex polygons (MCP) and core areas within badger home ranges were identified using 50% kernels. positional fixes were not sub-sampled to reduce autocorrelation between successive fixes. radio-tracking data were collected throughout the study, from Nov 2001 to Dec 2003, except during culling operations. SAS software was used for data analyses [70]. response variables were continuous (appropriate transformations were applied for adherence to model assumptions)"}
