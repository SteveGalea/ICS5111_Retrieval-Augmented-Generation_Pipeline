{"summary": "school absenteeism data have been employed as a component of influenza surveillance systems in some locations. data timeliness and system acceptance remain key determinants affecting the usefulness of a prospective surveillance system. aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of implementing an electronic school absenteeism surveillance system. school absenteeism is now increasingly being employed as a source of syndromic data for influenza surveillance to inform epidemic and pandemic preparedness in different locations. a number of newer electronic means of attendance tracking, including the use of smart card technology, have emerged in the market. smart card technology-based systems are increasingly being adopted for various administration purposes in all levels of local educational institutions. a previous pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of using smart card technology to capture school absenteeism data for surveillance purposes. the system was being used to track absence from school, supplemented with additional back end systems for the automation of all subsequent steps required in the surveillance process. the system was being used to track absence from school, including a process to capture the reasons for absence. a smart card (also called chip card or integrated circuit card) is a pocket-sized plastic card embedded with integrated circuits, allowing for individual identification, security authentication, data storage, and application processing in a wide variety of settings. the situation in Hong Kong offers an unprecedented opportunity for assessing whether these automated data collection approaches in a school setting may offer the potential to contribute to more timely and efficient disease surveillance. in private practice, 65 general outpatient clinics and sentinel Chinese medicine practitioners in selected clinics reporting proportions of patient consultations having ILI on a weekly basis. other additional systems included child care centers and kindergartens reporting children suffering from fever or cough and residential care homes for the elderly reporting fever. many schools in Hong Kong now use smart cards rather than verbal roll call to track attendance at school because of convenience and efficiency. this study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Hong Kong (HKU)/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster. recruitment of schools We extended our initial invitation to all local schools using the eAttendance system. most schools in Hong Kong have required parents to monitor body temperature of their children every day and to abstain from sending them to school when having a fever. many schools now use smart cards rather than verbal roll call to track attendance at school. recruitment of schools We extended our invitation to all local schools using the eAttendance system. Interested schools were visited to provide further explanation on study details and logistical arrangement. the specific causes of absence were then individually ascertained by telephone call and manually recorded into the system in free text format by designated school staff. a simple drop-down menu was added to the user interface (Figure 3) to allow for easy and standardized reporting of common causes of absence, such as ILI, gastroenteritis, hand, foot and mouth disease, acute conjunctivitis, or non-sickness-related absence. data Flow Architecture and Privacy For the back end electronic system we constructed for automatic data handling, there are three layers in the data flow architecture, namely (1) Internet, (2) internal network, and (3) restricted network. internal network and restricted network are protected behind both the external firewall and internal firewall, where both are hosted by HKU. daily numbers of all-cause and ILI-specific absentees were correspondingly aggregated into a weekly count for the whole territory. weekly absenteeism rate was then calculated by dividing the aggregated weekly absence counts by the total number of enrolled students in all participating schools. all participating schools received a system update of their eClass system. no additional workload was imposed on school staffs. daily absenteeism data from all participating schools was collected for 2 academic years from September 2012 to June 2014. the rate of school absenteeism varied over the course of 2 years. two of the four epidemic peaks matched exactly temporally with the GP data. the remaining two peaks occurred 1 to 2 weeks before the peaks shown by the GP data. 81% of schools agreed the upgraded system was simple and easy to operate. 64% of schools responded that data from the system were useful in enhancing their understanding of ILI activity in their schools. eAttendance module shows steps for easy and standardised reporting of specific cause of absence using the drop-down menu (step 2) and for automatic submission of aggregated surveillance data in a standardised format by the Save button (step 3). anonymous and aggregated data from participating schools were sent to an email account of our team, which was then manually downloaded from the email account and uploaded to the HKU Web server via Secure Shell. server and the HKU workstation are the only 2 computers with access allowed by the external firewall and the HKU Web server. all access activities on both the HKU Web server and the database server are logged in a separate table in the same database. automatic data validation steps include checking the school identity, school name, the date of cases, and the number of students on that date. cross-correlation coefficient analyses were performed to assess the maximum correlation between different time lags of the corresponding test and reference data streams. a regular surveillance report was disseminated to participating schools in an electronic format. the system took around 3 to 4 working days from data capturing to information dissemination. the longest time lag was the lag of 2 to 3 days between data submission and data analysis. the number of schools reporting ILI-specific absenteeism data was initially only 13 (12.1%, 13/107) when they were recruited. the remaining two peaks occurred 1 to 2 weeks before the peaks shown by the GP data. the maximum correlation occurred with a 3-week lag with the test data preceding the reference data. peaks demonstrated by the school-based surveillance can precede those shown by the sentinel GP network by 1 to 3 weeks. the continuous baseline surveillance data collected in interpandemic times can help inform the CNA and RDM functions. the customizability of the system helps to calibrate detection algorithms in the CNA function. data from the system also allows OIA for school closure and other relevant public health interventions targeted to reduce disease transmission in the school setting. standardized reporting of disease-specific absenteeism data is aimed to improve specificity of the system and offered a theoretical potential for the system to adapt for surveillance of other infectious diseases of outbreak potential in the school setting. limitations Our system has a number of limitations: first, validity of school absenteeism data in reflecting influenza activity is contingent on the compliance of students refraining from going to schools when being sick. we have demonstrated the feasibility of building and implementing a large-scale surveillance system by employing a routinely adopted smart card\u2013based approach for automatic data capture in schools. the absenteeism data we collected from the system reflected ILI activity in the community and we were able to detect an upsurge in its disease activity in a more timely manner. the customizability of the system helps to calibrate detection algorithms in the CNA function with regard to the new pathogen and epidemic. data from the system also allows OIA for school closure and other relevant public health interventions targeted to reduce disease transmission in the school setting. the addition of a drop-down menu is aimed to reduce the workload for the reporting of disease-specific absenteeism data. this may have contributed to improve the acceptability of the procedure. standardized reporting of disease-specific absenteeism data is aimed to improve specificity of the system. the absenteeism data we collected from the system reflected ILI activity in the community. we were able to detect an upsurge in its disease activity in a more timely manner than other existing surveillance data."}
