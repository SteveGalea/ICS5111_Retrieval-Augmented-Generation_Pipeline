{"summary": "avian leukosis virus subgroup (ALV-J) isolates have been obtained from broiler breeders and laying chickens in most parts of china. these infections result in serious economic losses in commercial layer flocks and local chicken breeders. research projects were sanctioned by the South China Agriculture University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. all animal procedures were performed according to the regulations and guidelines established by this committee and international standards for animal welfare. on of SPF Chicken Infected with ALV-J RNA was extracted from the spleens of the clinic samples using commercial kits. RT-PCR analyses were employed to detect ALV-J via specific primers. clinical sample Detection, Histopathology, and Immunohistochemical Staining DNA was extracted from the spleens of the clinic samples using a commercial kit. qRT-PCR was performed on a Biorad CFX96 Real-Time Detection System using iTaqTM Universal SYBR\u00ae Green Supermix Kit reagents. qRT-PCR was performed using the 2-Ct method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) GGGATGGATGGCGAAG NM_001002856 Kint et al., 2015 Reverse GCAGTATCTCTCTCTAC ZC3HAV1 Forward GGTCCAGCCTCTCTCTAC NM_001012938.1 Reverse ACTGGCCGTGGTCATTCTTC TLR3 Forward GGTCCAGCCT NM_001011691.3 Reverse GCAACACCAGAGTACCGTGA TLR7 forward. Western Blot Analysis Tissue homogenates were prepared from spleens of chickens with tumors and normal chickens. lysates were collected and incubated on ice for 10 min and then cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. total protein content was determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Life Technologies, USA) three 140-day-old sick yellow chickens with neoplasms (designated SC1, SC2, and SC3) and three 140-day-old normal yellow chickens (designated NC1, NC2, NC3) were collected from a farm in Guangdong Province, China. chickens were inoculated intraperitoneally at a dose of 0.2 mL (104.5 TCID50/0.2 mL) of strain SCAU-HN06. RT-PCR analyses were employed to detect ALV-J via specific primers. clinical sample Detection, Histopathology, and Immunohistochemical Staining DNA was extracted from the spleens of the clinic samples using a commercial kit. qRT-PCR was performed on a Biorad CFX96 Real-Time Detection System using iTaqTM Universal SYBR\u00ae Green Supermix Kit reagents (Biorad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s specifications. expression of related genes of innate immunity was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) ELISA Spleen homogenates of SPF and clinical chicken samples were used to detect cytokine protein levels. the homogenates were centrifugated for 5 min at 5000 g and was removed immediately. lysates were collected and incubated on ice for 10 min. then cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. total protein content was determined with a BCA protein assay kit. membranes were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h with anti-rabbit-HRP. avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) was detected in specific-pathogen-free chicks and clinical samples. were all positive (Figure 1A, Panel 1). were all positive (data not shown) the presence of hemangiomas is a characteristic of ALV-J infection. these tumors were evident on the skin of the joints and digits. the tumors were typical cavernous hemangiomas with malignant vessel hyperplasia visible as a closely packed meshwork of blood vessels. genes that were decreased two to eightfold included interferon-stimulated genes such as the single copy antiviral gene Mx, IFN-stimulated genes 1 and 2 (ISG12-1, ISG12-2) and ZC3HAV1 (zinc finger CCCH-type antiviral protein 1). transcriptome analysis of splenic genes related to innate immunity based on previous study of ALV-J-induced tumor spleen samples. quantitative analysis of expression of PRRs in chicks (Left) and chickens with tumors. expression is relative to the average of the NC group (n = 3) for (B) Right and (C) Right. p 0.05, p 0.01, p 0.001. clinical chickens with neoplasms showed IL-6, IL-1 and IFN- levels. anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was also increased sharply in two of three clinical samples with neoplasms. IRF1 and STAT1 expression in the spleens of chickens with neoplasms (SC1\u20133) compared to healthy controls (NC). Detection of samples To determine whether the SPF chickens were successfully infected, we measured gene expression levels of ALV-J-specific genes from chickens infected with the SCAU-HN06 virus strain. the presence of hemangiomas is a characteristic of ALV-J infection. the tumors were typical cavernous hemangiomas with malignant vessel hyperplasia visible as a closely packed meshwork of blood vessels. PCR tests on the genomic DNA of the three sick chicken spleens were all positive. we detected no related viral infections as judged by the absence of amplicons using primers specific to ALV-A, ALV-B, MDV, and REV. the PCR tests of three normal chickens from the same flock were negative. we examined whether ALV-J induces or inhibits innate immune host responses during both early and late phases of infection. transcriptome analysis of splenic genes related to innate immunity based on previous study of ALV-J-induced tumors in white (Recessive) Plymouth Rock chickens. chicken MDA5 was the main ALV-J-sensing pattern-recognition receptor during the late infection phase in vivo. IL-6, IL-10, IL-1, and IFN- showed no significant differences between the groups of SPF chicks from 1 to 7 d.p.i. western blot analysis of the IRF1 and STAT1 expression in the late phases of ALV-J infection. cytokine levels were not significantly different between the infected chick group and the control group from 1 to 7 d.p.i. the nature of the exact innate sensors that detect ALV-J had remained elusive until now. recognition of HIV-1 by TLR7 does not require retroviral replication, and only requires attachment and endocytosis. IL-6, IL-1, and IFN- can induce expression of IFN-stimulated genes by activating the JAK-STAT pathway. this would lead to regulation of ISG12-1 expression via JAK-STAT pathway activation at 1 d.p.i. however, the early antiviral innate immune response was too weak to resist ALV-J invasion. the antiviral activity of IRF1 was inhibited during the late phase of ALV-J infection. we hypothesize that STAT1 levels are decreased in chickens with tumors induced by ALV-J infection."}
