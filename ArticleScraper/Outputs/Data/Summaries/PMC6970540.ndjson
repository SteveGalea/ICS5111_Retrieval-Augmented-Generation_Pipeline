{"summary": "coronaviruses share a common ancestor thought to have originated in bats. HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 circulate in the human population. HCoV-229E-like coronaviruses have recently been identified in bats. the porcine alphacoronavirus, PRCoV, binds to a site on porcine APN that differs from the site at which HCoV-229E binds to hAPN. the more closely related human alphacoronavirus, HCoV-NL63, uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 as receptor. coronavirus S-protein is characterized by a 6-helix bundle formed by the inner HR1 triple-helical coiled-coil around which the HR2 helices are packed. in the up conformation, the receptor binding site is blocked, and it has been suggested that this may serve to protect it from immune recognition. a phylogenetic analysis defined six RBD classes whose viruses have successively replaced each other in the human population over the past 50 years. a phylogenetic analysis defined six RBD classes whose viruses have successively replaced each other in the human population over the past 50 years. the coronavirus S-protein can access a conformation that exposes a significant portion of its helical core region to solvent. the ability to do so likely stems from the fact that the interfaces between monomers in this region are hydrophilic. this property is shared by all the coronavirus S-proteins whose structures have been determined. loop 2, a 2-aa deletion reorients Arg357, enabling a better interaction with Asp288. loop 3, Leu402 and Leu405 replace Trp404, with Leu405 maintaining the apolar contact with Leu318. the 315\u2013320 segment of Loop 1 shows a high degree of structural conservation among the four complexes. two 229E-related CoVs from bat (ALK28775.1 and ALK28781.1), a camel CoV (ALA50088.1) and an alpaca CoV (AFI49431.1). there are six hydrogen bonds between Loop 1 and hAPN that are common to all the four complexes. glu 291 is absolutely conserved among all 229E isolates sequenced. it seems that the flexibility afforded by glycine is important in maintaining the core Loop 1 interactions with hAPN in the context of the sequence variation that occurs in the three receptor binding loops. 316 emerges from a different side of Loop 1 where it forms a salt bridge with Asp 288 of hAPN in class III, IV and V complexes. the presence of the valine residue (Val 314) leads to an increase in the van der Waals contact with hAPN. in class V, the presence of the valine residue (Val 314) leads to an increase in the van der Waals contact with hAPN. the 2D class averages from these micrographs showed that the cones have domain-sized bulges and an opening at their bottom end. these features are also observed in the cryo-EM structure and result from an opening of the monomers in the helical core and connector region of the trimer. the final dataset included 71,000 particle images, most of them showing side-views of the trimeric S-protein. refinement with C1 symmetry did not reveal particle classes lacking three-fold symmetry. this led to a final map with a resolution of 3.1. the cryo-EM images also produced 2D class averages corresponding to particles shaped like equilateral triangles with 110 edges. these class averages have little density in the center of the triangle and appear to correspond to the S1 region of the trimer alone. however, attempts to generate high-resolution 3D reconstructions were not successful. helix is only a portion of the HR1 segment that forms the central 3-helix coiled-coil of the post-fusion 6-helix bundle. the remainder of HR1 is made up of two shorter helices and two non-helical segments. the junction between the HR1 helices and the start of CH is a sharp turn that reverses the chain direction leading to the anti-parallel arrangement of the helices. o-EM map contoured at 6.0 RMS. the S1 and S2 regions are colored cyan and magenta. each subunit is colored differently. each potential N-glycan is indicated by a cyan sphere at the Asn sidechain amide group. the 229E S-protein contains as many as 30 predicted N-glycosylation sites on each monomer. the 60 residue HR2 region possesses 5 N-glycosylation sequons. the high degree of glycosylation shown by the coronaviruses is thought to be important in shielding the pre-fusion HR2 triple helical coiled-coil from immune recognition. the four -domains (domains A-D) of the S1 subunit are arranged in a ring-like fashion with the N-glycan at Asn 62 of domain A directed into the otherwise empty center of the ring. the close approach of the three receptor binding loops the receptor binding domains of a number of coronaviruses have been found to access both an up and a down conformation. the receptor binding domains of a number of coronaviruses have been found to access both an up and a down conformation. the receptor binding domains of a number of coronaviruses have been found to access both an up and a down conformation. the three S1 subunits form a cap that sits over the three S2 subunits. the three A domains sit at the vertices of the triangle and the B domains are positioned closer to the three-fold rotation axis. the presence of 2D class averages with dimensions similar to that of the cap alone suggests that these interactions can maintain cap assembly even in the absence of interactions involving the S2 subunit. the three core helices of each S2 subunit of the trimer are arranged around the 3-fold axis with CH positioned most closely to it. the interactions between the core helices of each S2 subunit make up the bulk of the trimer interface in this region. the connector domain contributes to the trimer interface in other coronavirus S-proteins and its interactions may also stabilize the pre-fusion trimer. the CD domain does not make trimer-stabilizing contacts in our structure, further evidence of the important role played by the cap in the stabilization of the pre-fusion trimer. a large opening that separates the monomers at the C-terminal end of the S2 subunit in the helical core and CD regions. the opening results in distinctive protrusions on the sides of the trimer that are clearly visible in the 2D class averages from both the negative stain and cryo-EM images. a sliding of one monomer over another leads to the exposure of a significant proportion of the CH, HR1821-852 and UH surfaces to solvent. your browser is not supporting the HTML5 video> element. you may download that video as a file and play it with a player of you choice. the helix undergoes a 60\u00b0 rotation along its long axis on conversion to the post-fusion form. the rotation restructures the CH trimer interface and the transition is presumably facilitated by the hydrophilic interface. even larger conformational changes are associated with the formation of the post-fusion triple-helical HR1 coiled-coil. we have now determined the structures of the Class III-V RBDs in complex with hAPN. these RBDs possess the receptor binding loops (Loop 1, residues 308\u2013325; Loop 2, residues 352\u2013359; Loop 3, residues 404\u2013408) and supporting residues of their respective RBD classes and the Class I RBD residues in the remainder of the domain. the six residues conserved among all HCoV-229E viruses sequenced are enclosed in blue boxes. the source of these sequences are: ABB90507.1 (Class II), ABB90514.1 (Class III), ABB90519.1 (Class IV), ABB90523.1 (Class V), and AFR45554.1 (Class VI). Gly 315, Cys 317, Asn 319, and Cys 320 correspond to four of the six residues that are absolutely conserved among the receptor binding loops of all 229E isolates sequenced. the side chain of Asn 319 is buried in the complex interface where it donates and accepts hydrogen bonds from the backbone atoms of hAPN residue Tyr 289. all three classes have acquired two leucine residues not found in the Class I sequence. Arg 316 emerges from a different side of Loop 1 where it forms a salt bridge with Asp 288 of hAPN. the presence of the valine residue (Val 314) leads to a stabilization of the interactions with hAPN. ectodomain (residues 17\u20131113) was produced as a fusion protein with a foldon trimerization motif. a dual-proline mutation (Thr871Pro/Ile872Pro) was introduced to stabilize the pre-fusion form. Cryo-EM 2D class averages of the putative S1 cap. a simulated top view of the S1 cap at the same scale as in (e) the cryo-EM map contoured at different levels to show weak densities near the C-terminal end. the well resolved regions of the S1 and S2 subunits are colored gray. the poorly resolved connector domains are colored gray. structure of the 229E S-protein trimer is similar to that of the closely related NL63 S-protein trimer. the three S1 subunits form a cap over the three S2 subunits. each S1 subunit non-covalently associating with the S2 subunit of an adjacent monomer. 80 residue (residues 959\u20131033) -rich connector domain (CD) could be identified in the cryo-EM map, but its density was too weak to be traced with confidence. this extended our model to 24 residues before the start of the HR2 region. the RBD (domain B, orange) makes polar interactions (cyan sidechains) with the CH-HR1 junction and hydrophobic interactions (magenta sidechains) in the elbow between domain B and domain C. the dotted arrow shows the direction that the RBD will take on conversion to the up conformation. en of these are located in the well-resolved S1 and S2 regions (38\u2013565 and 585\u2013953) the 60 residue HR2 region possesses 5 N-glycosylation sequons. as such, it represents the most highly glycosylated region of the entire S-protein, a feature that may be important in the transition from the pre-fusion to the post-fusion conformation. loop 1 is flexible, there is little density for the tip of it, and it does not make specific contacts with domain A. an overlay of the Class III, Class IV and Class V RBDs suggests that their receptor binding loops would also not strongly interact with domain A. this suggests that the receptor binding loops of 229E are simply accommodated in the gap between them and domain A. domain B-domain C and domain B-S2 interactions are the main interactions that would stabilize domain B in the down conformation. apolar interactions between domain A of one S1 subunit and domain C of another largely account for the inter-subunit contacts (700 2) within the cap. each monomer is colored white, gray and black, respectively. apolar residues between the S1 subunits are colored cyan. apolar residues between the S1 subunits are colored cyan. between the S1 cap and the S2 subunits of the trimer include a relatively large apolar component capable of mediating significant stabilizing forces. the C and D domains of each S1 subunit of the cap clamp over an apolar knob (residues 709\u2013737) that protrudes from the helical core region of each S2 subunit. as a result, 1260 2 of apolar surface area (of a total of 2300 2) is the trimer interfaces in the helical core region are hydrophilic in coronaviruses. for each coronavirus S-protein, the three interface-forming helices are shown with all their apolar (green) or polar (cyan) residues. for the side views only two subunits are shown to reveal the interface. each 229E (teal) and NL63 (magenta) S2 subunit rotates 11\u00b0 relative to the NL63 S2 subunit. red arrows indicate the rotation axes around which each monomer rotates. most pronounced effect of the monomer rotations is a sliding of one monomer over another in the helical core region of the trimer interface. the hydrophilic nature of these interfaces is common among all the reported coronavirus S-protein structures. the helix undergoes a 60\u00b0 rotation along its long axis on conversion to the post-fusion form. the three receptor binding loops of HCoV-229E are the most variable region in the entire viral genome. loop variation has led to the emergence of six RBD classes whose viruses have successively replaced each other in the human population. the structures also show how mutational changes in the periphery can lead to a modulation of receptor binding affinity while receptor specificity is maintained. the nature of the interaction between the various RBDs and hAPN also provides insight into how HCoV-229E and the related bat, camel and alpaca-like viruses were transmitted to their respective hosts. the receptor binding loops of 229E are blocked in the S-protein trimer. they cannot be bound by either B-cell receptors or antibodies. if they make S-protein contacts in the down conformation, it is an important question. a significant proportion of the 229E core helices, CH, HR1821-852 and UH, are exposed to solvent. the HCoV-229E S-protein has an opening at the bottom end (Figure 8) that separates the monomers of the trimer in the helical core region. this presumably facilitated the exposure of these helices to solvent. coiled-coiled coil is already formed in the pre-fusion conformation. the soluble ectodomain of hAPN (residues 66\u2013967) was expressed in stably transfected HEK293S-GnT1(-/-) cells. the target proteins were secreted as N-terminal protein-A fusion proteins with a TEV protease cleavage site following the protein-A tag. the bound proteins were liberated by on-column TEV protease cleavage. the hAPN was further purified by anion exchange chromatography. the deglycosylated hAPN and the RBDs were then individually purified on a superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) the complexes were concentrated to 10 mg/mL and Endo A was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to deglycosylate the RBDs in situ. the atomic models were built using Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) and iteratively refined using REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 2011) and Phenix.refine (Afonine et al., 2012) Cloning and expression of the 229E spike protein ectodomain The class I HCoV-229E sequence (AAK32191.1) was chosen for the cryo-EM analysis. protein expression was induced with the addition of 1 g/mL doxycycline. the protein was further purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl. for each cryo-EM specimen, 3 L of S-protein solution was applied to a glow-discharged (2 min, 15 mA) holey grid. grids were blotted for 13 s at 100% humidity and 295 K. CTF parameters were estimated using CTFFIND4 (Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015) and cryoSPARC v2. methods included manual picking followed by template-guided automatic picking, and automatic picking with a Gaussian blob. micrographs all contained small particles that did not correspond to the intact S-protein ectodomain. local refinement was performed using cryoSPARC v2. the atomic model of the HCoV-229E ectodomain was built manually into the C3-symmetry map using Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004). the atomic model was validated using Molprobity (Williams et al., 2018), EMRinger (Barad et al., 2015) and the comprehensive validation (cryo-EM) tool in Phenix (Afonine et al., 2018b). molecular graphics, animations and movies were generated using UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) cDNA sequences encoding the six RBD classes were cloned into an inducible piggyBac transposon-based stable expression vector. soluble ectodomain of hAPN was expressed in stably transfected HEK293S-GnT1(-/-) cells as described previously. the bound proteins were liberated by on-column TEV protease cleavage. the hAPN was further purified by anion exchange chromatography (HiTrap-Q), while the HCoV-229E RBDs were further purified by cation exchange chromatography (HiTrap-SP). complexes were concentrated to 10 mg/mL and endo A was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to deglycosylate the RBDs in situ. the protein solutions were mixed with well solution consisting of 9% PEG 8000, 1 mM oxidized glutathione, 1 mM reduced glutathione, 5% glycerol, and 100 mM MES, pH 6.5. cDNA sequence encoding the ectodomain of the S-protein (residues 17\u20131113) was cloned into an inducible piggyBac transposon-based stable expression vector. Thr 871 and Ile 872 were both mutated to prolines to stabilize the pre-fusion form. EM 3 L of the S-protein ectodomain was applied to the surface of a glow-discharged (60 s, 15 mA), carbon-coated copper mesh grid. the grid was then washed with 150 mM NaCl and stained with 3 L of 2% uranyl formate. the final high-resolution data collection was performed with a Titan Krios G3 300 kV microscope equipped with a Falcon 3EC direct detector. each movie was recorded in counting mode with a 60 s exposure and saved in 30 fractions. a total of 4000 movies were collected for the final high-resolution dataset. the final dataset included 71,000 particle images. initial map generation, homogenous 3D refinement, heterogenous 3D refinement and non-uniform 3D refinement were carried out in cryoSPARC v2. atomic model of the HCoV-229E ectodomain was built manually into the C3-symmetry map using Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004). a homology model based on the 3.4 cryo-EM structure of the HCoV-NL63 S-protein trimer (PDB id: 5SZS) was produced using the PHYRE2 server (Kelley et al., 2015), and used as a reference during model simulated 2D class average of the S1 cap shown in Figure 2f was generated using the \u2018Simulate Data\u2019 tool of cryoSPARC v2. 1000 simulated particle images were then generated using the \u2018Simulate Data\u2019 tool. the resulting simulated particle images were then used for 2D-classification. elife-51230-supp1.docx (15.7KB, docx) Supplementary file 2.
