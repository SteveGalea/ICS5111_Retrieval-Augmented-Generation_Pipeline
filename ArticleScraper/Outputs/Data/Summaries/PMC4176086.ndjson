{"summary": "PRRS virus (PRRSV) is a member of a group of enveloped RNA viruses from the genus Arteriviridae within the order Nidovirales. PRRSV genome is a linear, non-segmented, single stranded, positive-sense RNA with 15 kb in size [4], capped at the 5\u2032 end and polyadenylated at the 3\u2032 terminus. a number of newly isolated PRRSV variants with different deletions or recombinants was reported in china. the HP-PRRSV variant continues prevailing and accelerating evolution in china. reverse genetics systems developed for the study of many of the positive-stranded RNA viruses can generate recombinant mutant viruses to study different aspects of virus biology. a recombinant PRRSV expressing GFP gene proved the stability of the foreign GFP gene even after 37 serial passages. this was done by using the transcription regulatory sequence of gene 2 (TRS2) to drive transcription of the GFP gene and inserting an extra synthetic TRS6 to drive transcription of the ORF 2a and 2b. this recombinant virus stably expresses EGFP as a separate transcription unit. the pBeloBAC11 plasmid includes the first 758 nucleotides (nts) of the genome under the control of the CMV promoter. the last 2014 nts of the viral RNA followed by a 32-bp synthetic poly (A) tail, the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (HDV) and the bovine growth hormone termination and polyadenylation sequences (BGH) sequence of 3-UTR to the pBAC-SD16-5\u2032-3\u2032 vector was PCR-amplified from pBAC-SD16FL and ligated together to form fragment Fam. the corresponding fragment of pBAC-SD16FL was replaced with Fam to construct plasmid pBAC-SD16FL-AM. the entire viral genome of HP-PRRSV/SD16 except for the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends was amplified by RT-PCR using TRI fragment Fa (ending at the N gene with AsiS I and Mlu I sites introduced at the 5\u2032 end) and Fm (starting from the 3\u2032-UTR with AsiS I and Mlu I sites introduced at the 5\u2032 end) were amplified from pBAC-SD16FL and ligated together to generate fragment Fam. the sequence analysis revealed that two unique restriction sites (AsiS I and Mlu I) were correctly inserted into pBAC-SD16 80% confluent Marc-145 cells cultured in 6-well plates were transfected with the plasmids pBAC-SD16FL and pBAC-SD16FL-TRS6-EGFP. after 4\u20135 days of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, the cells and supernatants were collected and freeze-thawed for three times and the supernatants were then used to infect Marc-145 cells to propagate the rescued virus. Western blot Marc-145 cells were infected with HP-PRRSV/SD16 or rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP at a MOI of 0.01 for 2 days. cells were then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. immunostained proteins were visualized using ECL Western Blotting Substrate. cellular proteins from mock-infected cells were used as controls. rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP was propagated in Marc-145 cells for 10 passages. -145 cells were infected with rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP. after 1 h post infection, the medium was removed and replaced with 2 mL of pre-warmed DMEM containing 3% fetal calf serum. EGFP fluorescence and phase contrast images were captured every 15 min for a period of 3 days by a live cell station. Marc-145 cells were infected with rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP (0.1 MOI) for 1 h. plates were washed with DMEM and the various concentrations of CsA were added. after 36 h pi, cells were fixed and examined under the fluorescent microscope. the pBeloBAC11 plasmid includes the first 758 nucleotides (nts) of the genome under the control of the CMV promoter. a multicloning site containing the restriction sites Kas I, Pml I, Bmt I, Nsi I, Asc I, and Bsu36 I was introduced between the viral sequences. all fragments were subcloned stepwise into the pBAC-SD16-5\u2032-3\u2032 vector to produce plasmid pBAC-SD16FL. the fragments were PCR-amplified from pBAC-SD16FL and ligated together to form fragment Fam. the entire viral genome of HP-PRRSV/SD16 except for the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends was amplified by RT-PCR. each amplicon was inserted into the pEASYTM-blunt simple cloning vector. the unique restriction sites inserted into pBAC-SD16FL between nt 15 170 and 15 171 of the HP-PRRSV/SD16 genome cDNA sequence were used for the cloning of EGFP under the control of the TRS6. fragment Fa (ending at the N gene with AsiS I and Mlu I sites introduced at the 5\u2032 the amplified product was inserted into the pEASYTM-blunt simple cloning vector to generate plasmids pEASY-TRS6-EGFP. after sequencing, cloned into asiS I / Mlu I-cut pBAC-SD16FL-AM to generate plasmid pBAC-SD16FL-TRS6-EGFP. 80% confluent Marc-145 cells cultured in 6-well rHP-PRRSV/SD16/SD16/TRS6-EGFP was used in the following experiments. the growth curves of rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP and parental virus were determined by serially passaging in Marc-145. after 1 h of virus adsorption, the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated in DMEM with 3% FBS at 37 \u00b0C. the infected cells were lyzed and the cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. the membrane was incubated with mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibody, anti-Tubulin antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and 6D10, as the primary antibodies. cellular proteins from mock-infected Marc-145 cells were used as controls. a total of 100 L samples were transferred to wells of a 96-well white plate. the EGFP fluorescence of each well was read on a microplate fluorescence Reader. the quantity of EGFP was determined by comparing its fluorescence with that of the GFP standard. the mixture of virus and serum was added to each of the wells plated with the monolayered Marc-145 cells. the cells were washed twice with DMEM, and then cultured in DMEM containing 3% FBS at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 48 h. the EGFP fluorescence and CPE were imaged using a fluorescence microscope. rHP-PRRSV/SD16 and rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP viruses were rescued successfully in Marc-145 cells. the recombinant rHP-PRRSV/SD16 and rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP was recovered in 60\u201380% of cells transfected with pBAC-SD16FL-TRS6-EGFP. normal viral protein expression and EGFP expression were simultaneously detected in rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP infected cells. however, EGFP expression was not detected in mock- or HP-PRRSV/SD16-infected Marc-145 cells. rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP was propagated and assessed by monitoring EGFP expression in Marc-145 cells for 10 passages. the samples of culture medium plus cells collected every second passage were assayed for total (cell-associated and released into culture media) virus titre. rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP was analysed by live-cell imaging. cells were infected with rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP at a MOI of 0.1. cell monolayer was analysed by collecting EGFP fluorescence and phase contrast photomicrographs. SD16/TRS6-EGFP and wt HP-PRRSV/SD16 infections of Marc-145 cells at 48 h pi. the antiserum neutralised both rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP and wt HP-PRRSV/SD16 virus infection. the negative serum did not neutralise the virus infection. the production of rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP and wt HP-PRRSV infectious progeny was greatly reduced by CsA at the concentrations of 2 M to 8 M in a dose dependent manner. the effect of CsA on the production of the viral proteins was evaluated by the Western blot. the recombinant rHP-PRRSV/SD16 and rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP were recovered in 60\u201380% of Marc-145 cells transfected using the optimal ratios of plasmid and transfection reagent. rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP was used in the following experiments since it can be used for evaluating or optimizing the reverse genetics system. rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP was propagated and assessed by monitoring EGFP expression in Marc-145 cells for 10 passages. rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP was propagated and assessed by monitoring EGFP expression in cells for 10 passages. intracellular RNA was isolated after infection with viruses from passages 5 and 10 (P5 and P10, respectively) rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP was stable and its growth kinetics were similar to those of the parental virus. photomicrographs of 10 different positions were captured every 15 min from 1 h pi for a period of 3 days. individual infected cells expressing EGFP were observed at about 10 h pi and EGFP expression in neighbouring cells was detected between 10 and 11 h later. EGFP expression in surrounding cells was detected as late as 24 h pi in some infectious positions. rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP and HP-PRRSV/SD16 viruses were incubated with serial dilutions of either a HP-PRRSV/SD16 antiserum or a negative serum. each serum dilution was tested in triplicate. CsA at various concentrations inhibited rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP and wt HP-PRRSV/SD16 infection of Marc-145 cells. the effects of CsA at various concentrations on cell viability compared to the viability of untreated control cells (100%). extra cassette can be inserted just before ORF1ab or after ORF7 regions. insertion could block early translation of pp1a and pp1ab. recombinant PRRSV including a foreign HA tag fused to ORF7 lost epitope at passage 2. rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP was introduced into the HP-PRRSV/SD16 genome with limited modification of the genome. rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP stably expressed EGFP as a separate transcription unit. cDNA infectious clone represents a useful tool for construction of potential recombinant vaccine candidates. early detection of infected cells showed that EGFP was expressed in cells with no apparent CPE. this could be due to high expression levels associated with genes located close to the genome end. rHP-PRRSV/SD16/TRS6-EGFP was found to be an excellent tool for screening neutralising antibodies. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions CBW, BCH, and EMZ carried out all the experiments and drafted the manuscript.
