XSV was antigenically closer to SEOV than LAIV. rNP cross-reactivity among LAIV, XSV and SEOV. eukaryotically expressed rNPs. 131 of 709 (18.5%) bat sera were found to be HV antibody positive. most positive sera had titers of 100, yet 18 sera reached 400. serological results show seroprevalence of HVs in bats widely existed in four provinces. of 48 bat sera and 2 human sera controls. each square represents one serum, consisting of upper (FAVNT) and middle (ELISA) boxes. the combined 2 bars represent numbers of sampled bat samples collected in each city. lengths of color boxes in the bars represent the numbers of sampled bats. the number of sampled bats in each province is shown on the upper Chinese map. XSV and BRNV should be considered new HV species awaiting ICTV consideration. nt identity between currently identified XSV variants ranges from 76.1%-93.4%. NP of XSV showed cross antigenicity with both SEOV and LAIV. XSV is antigenically closer than LAIV to SEOV. closer relationship of insectivore-borne HVs NVAV and ALTV to bat-borne. phylogenetic analyses show bat-borne HVs had broad genetic diversities. iters of bat sera against HVs in our study were rather low (the most were 100 and only 18 were 400) the correlation between RT-PCR positivity and antibody positivity about hantavirus infection in rodents or shrews was reported. serological epidemiology is important to uncover the real situation of bat-borne HV prevalence. 88 ELISA sera were further tested by WB against all three rNPs. some could cross recognize two rNPs, mainly the rNPs of LAIV/XSV, or XSV/SEOV, and seldomly the rNPs of LAIV/SEOV. multiple patterns of cross-reactivity with three rNPs suggest bats were infected with other unknown HVs. the prime example is bat serum BN78, which had the highest neutralization titer against SEOV. bat-borne HVs have a huge genetic diversity with different viral species harbored by different genera of bats. this implies that a given bat-borne HV may have a host tropism. XSV has been identified in two north Vietnamese provinces since 2013. a narrow area between southwest Guangxi and north Vietnam likely forms a main circulation sphere of at least two species of bat-borne HVs. a comprehensive analysis based on genetic diversity, seroprevalence, cross antigenicity and host range of the viruses has helped identify an area between China and Vietnam as a main circulation sphere. XSV and BRNV should be considered new HV species awaiting ICTV consideration. there are partial L gene sequences available for all bat-borne HVs. this allowed construction of a phylogenetic tree (using 314 bp) nine bat-borne HVs have been identified worldwide, but the virus detection rate is low and in limited locations [5, 7, 9, 11] the present study investigated bats in 22 cities, but the viral RNA was found in only three bat colonies in three cities. RNA-positive rates were only 1.4% (1/74) for LAIV in BS, 3.0% (5/168) for XSV in LB and 7.5% (3/40) for XSV in PE. NV, a newly isolated hantavirus, had MJNV RNA detected by RT-PCR. all nine RT-PCR positive samples were collected in 2015 and 2016. serology study on bat-borne HVs was not conducted in previous publications. serological epidemiology is important to uncover the real situation of bat-borne HV prevalence. 48 bat sera were assayed by FAVNT, ELISA and WB. of the nine NAb-positive sera, four neutralized but did not react by ELISA or WB. the most interesting bat serum was BN78, which neutralized SEOV. the host range of bat-borne HVs Viruses usually have a defined host range for circulation in nature. XSV variants in the present and previous studies have come from a single bat species, Hipposideros (Hi. pomona) in 2015, XSV was found in BS and LB, indicating divergent bat-borne HVs co-exist in LB. it is notable that XSV has been identified in two north Vietnamese provinces. this indicates that XSV circulates in the vast area between Chinese Guangxi/Yunnan and Vietnam. a comprehensive analysis based on genetic diversity, seroprevalence, cross antigenicity and host range of the viruses has helped identify an area between China and Vietnam as a main circulation sphere where at least two bat-borne HVs circulate. extensive studies should be emphasized in future to assess the potential risk of bat-borne HVs to public health. the tissue samples were homogenized and subjected to RNA extraction using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) the RNA was reversely transcribed into cDNA which was processed for viral metagenomic analysis. the genomic positions of the contigs were decided using Hantaan virus strain 76\u2013118 as the reference. cultures were harvested by freeze-thawing 3x and passaged again in the same cell lines. overlapping primers were synthesized based on the contigs (S1 Table) and representative sequences of previously published HVs including bat-borne HV LAIV BT20. the best-fit substitution model for each tree was selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) of Smart Model Selection (SMS) in PhyML. rNP expression in E. coli and generation of mouse anti-rNP specific hyperimmune serum were amplified with the 5\u2019 EcoRI and a 3\u2019 XhoI sites at the two ends. the rNPs of the three HVs were purified and quantified using an SEOV-convalescent human serum (H anti-SEOV) and a negative human serum (H Neg.) as controls. each injection contained 20 g protein mixed 1:1 (V/V) with the Quick Antibody-Mouse 5W adjuvant (Biodragon) as recommended by the producers. transfected cells were cultured at 37oC with 5% CO2 for 36 h. examined microscopically for expression of fusion proteins with green fluorescence. correct expression of rNPs in cell lysates confirmed by WB. 2CO3 buffer at 4\u00b0C overnight and blocked with 5% non-fat milk (Promega) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h followed by addition of HRP-conjugated goat anti-bat IgG, H&L chain, polyclonal antibody (BETHYL, react specifically with bat IgG, and with light chains common to other bat immunoglobulins) anti-HV monoclonal antibody was labeled using FITC. titer of each serum was calculated using the Spearman-K\u00e4rber formula [61]. bat species were identified morphologically and then molecularly by sequencing the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene from muscle tissue. these bats were classified as belonging to 22 species within 9 genera and 6 families. RNA was reversely transcribed into cDNA which was processed for viral metagenomic analysis. the cells were washed 2x with PBS, incubated in DMEM with 2% FBS for 14\u201321 days and observed daily for cytopathic effects (CPE). after incubation for 24 h, the cells were washed 2x with PBS, incubated in DMEM with 2% FBS for 14\u201321 days and observed daily for cytopathic effects. ORFs of each segment were searched by ORFfinder in NCBI. the predicted proteins were further confirmed by aligning in BLASTp. their complete NP, GP and RdRp coding regions were aligned with those obtained in the present study. the rNPs were expressed after induction with 0.5 mM isopropyl--d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and identified by SDS-PAGE and WB using mouse anti-6X His-tag monoclonal antibody and Alexa Fluor 680-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG H&L (Abcam) as the respective primary and secondary antibodies. each injection contained 20 g protein mixed 1:1 (V/V with the Quick Anti three NP fragments were fused in-frame to the C-terminal of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tag (239 aa, MW 27 kDa) of eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-C1. transfected cells were cultured at 37oC with 5% CO2 for 36 h. the total protein was quantified using the BCA Protein Assay Kit. the membranes were incubated with Alexa Fluor 680-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG H&L 1:1,000 for 50 min. after washing, the membranes were photographed using an Odyssey imager. all WB analyses were repeated at least three times. the cut-off values of bat and human sera were determined based on the highest CR between results of ELISA and WB. rNPs were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes followed by blocking using the protocol described above. membranes were then incubated with 1:300 diluted selected bat or human serum for 2 h, followed by 2,000-fold diluted HRP-conjugated goat anti-bat IgG H&L chain polyclonal the reference M (A) and L (B) sequences are of HTNV strain 76\u2013118. the reference M (A) and L (B) sequences are of HTNV strain 76\u2013118 (Accession number: Y00386 and NC_005222). phylogenetic tree generated based on the 314-bp sequence of the L segment using the method of Fig 1.
