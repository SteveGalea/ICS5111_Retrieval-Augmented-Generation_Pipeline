{"summary": "an enterectomy was performed and histopathology revealed severe pyogranulomatous enteritis with vasculitits. four days after surgery, the cat re-presented with anorexia and acute onset of expiratory dyspnoea. a post-mortem examination was performed. the cat was recently dewormed with milbemycin oxime/praziquantel (Milbemax tablets for small cats and kittens; Elanco); it was not vaccinated and had no travel history outside the country. on abdominal palpation, there was a suspicion of thickened intestines. two days later, the patient re-presented to the referring veterinarian with persistent diarrhoea and weight loss (100 g) on physical examination, all vital parameters were within normal limits, except for rectal temperature, which was still slightly raised (39.7o C) the cat was normally hydrated. two days after surgery, the patient was discharged, awaiting the results. histopathology of the jejunal biopsies revealed several aggregates of macrophages and neutrophils. pyogranulomatous enteritis and vasculitis compatible with feline infectious peritonitis was made. an ophthalmic evaluation revealed bilateral uveitis with anterior chamber opacity. the cat was humanely euthanized and a post-mortem examination was performed. the cat was humanely euthanized and a post-mortem examination was performed. myocardium fibres were markedly expanded by oedema and multifocal inflammatory infiltrates of lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages. no evidence of the typical HCM histological findings, such as myofibre disarray, extensive interstitial fibrosis or focal endocardial thickening. if the cat\u2019s macrophages fail to eliminate the virus, it replicates within their cytoplasm and FIP develops. 2,3,5,6 The non-effusive form is characterised by the development of granulomatous lesions within the kidneys, central nervous system, eyes and parenchymatous organs. myocarditis is a form of myocardial disease characterised by the presence of inflammation in response to physical, chemical and infectious agents. reports of dogs and cats with infectious myocarditis caused by systemic diseases, such as protozoa (Trypanosoma cruzi), viruses (FIV, parvovirus, West Nile virus), bacteria (Bartonella species, Bacillus piliformis, Citrobacter koseri), spirochetes studies on a large cohort of cats are needed to establish the prevalence of myocarditis in cats diagnosed with FIP."}
