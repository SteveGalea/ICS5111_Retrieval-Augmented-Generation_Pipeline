{"summary": "human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) may be detected in a range of body fluids from infected individuals, including saliva, urine, tears, breast milk and blood. animal models of HCMV infection provide a useful alternative. MCMV encodes numerous homologues of HCMV genes. the local lymphatics provide an additional barrier to peripheral MCMV infection that restrict vascular dissemination. the use of the HCMV immediate-early promoter (IEp) to mediate expression of phenotype markers has been widely used due to its high constitutive activity. M33 encodes a chemokine receptor homologue that is essential for MCMV salivary gland tropism. pB35, a derivative of pBS-M78, has an MfeI site introduced at the M78 stop codon. the primers used to generate the fused construct are shown in Table 1. the M78-P2A-LUC cassette was cloned directly into pB35. it was prepared by homologous recombination between pB249 and purified DNA from MCMV K181/Perth. MEF were infected with either M78-LUC (M78), IEp-LUC (IEp), wild-type K181 (+) or left uninfected. cells were lysed, the proteins separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. a 60-KDa protein, consistent with the size of luciferase, was detected. cells were infected at an m.o.i. of 1.0 with either M78-LUC or IEp-LUC. uninfected cells were included as background luminescence controls. luciferase from IEp-LUC-infected MEF is not attenuated in vitro or in vivo. the level of luciferase from IEp-LUC-infected MEF was markedly higher than that detected for M78 -LUC. cell types included primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), endothelial (SVEC 4\u201310), macrophage (RAW264) and epithelial luciferase expression was quantified in triplicate (independent cultures) at each time point relative to IEp-LUC. luciferase activity of M78-LUC was generally higher than that of IEp-LUC until later times. luciferase expression was recorded in individual live mice over 12 days. luciferase measurements from the thorax were significantly higher in IEp-LUC-infected mice in the first few days p.i. differences in luciferase levels between virus strains in the salivary gland correlated with infectious titres. however, a similar correlate was not observed for the lung. administration of luciferin, lungs (Lu), heart (h), superficial cervical lymph node (SCLN), salivary gland (SG) and noses were harvested at day 5 p.i. and imaged. at day 12 p.i. the process was repeated for the salivary glands. luciferase levels did not always directly correlate with infectious titres. low to negligible virus titres were recovered from the nose and SCLN. luciferase expression from mice infected with IEp-LUC was higher from the abdomens of live mice compared with M78-LUC at day 5 p.i. pancreas (P), salivary glands (SG) and femurs/tibias (BM) were harvested at day 5 p.i. the process was repeated for the salivary glands. the radiance scale was normalized within each organ group. productive infection at this site was negligible for both viruses at this early time point. neither luciferase activity nor virus was detected from the lungs. at 3 days p.i. colonization of the nose was observed in two out of three animals infected with either M78-LUC or IEp-LUC. the MCMV M33 ORF is not essential for virus replication in vitro. the chemokine receptor homologue is critical for salivary gland tropism. it is dispensable for haematogenous dissemination to the salivary gland. intranasal infection with M33/M78-LUC resulted in luciferase signals in the noses and lungs of live mice at day 5 p.i. qPCR of SCLN from M78-LUC-infected or M33/M78-LUC-infected mice confirmed colonization. luminescence scale (in photons/sec/cm2/steridian) for both live mice and dissected organs is shown to the right of each group. luciferase signals from dissected organs confirmed spread of both viruses from the footpad to the draining popliteal lymph node (pLN) infectious M33/M78-LUC was not detected in either the spleen or salivary gland following footpad infection. BALB/c mice were infected with either M78-LUC or M33/M78-LUC. pB35, a derivative of pBS-M78, has an MfeI site introduced at the M78 stop codon (CAATTGAAA) the Luc 2 ORF (Photinus pyralis) was amplified from plasmid pGL4.10 (Promega) the porcine teschovirus-1 P2A cleavage sequence was inserted via complementary oligonucleotides. the primers used to generate the fused construct cggccaattgTTACACGGCGATCTTGCCGC Fig. 1. cggccaattgTTACACGGCGATCTTGCCGC. cggccaattgTTACACGGCGATCTTGCCGC. 106 p.f.u. MCMV (either wt, M78-LUC or M78) were harvested by either the i.p. or i.n. routes. the indicated organs were harvested during acute (day 5) or persistent (day 12) phases of infection. wild-type K181 MCMV (negative control) or left uninfected. samples analysed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting. luciferase from IEp-LUC-infected MEF was markedly higher. in vivo, organ titres of M78-LUC were equivalent to wt MCMV following either i.p. or intranasal (i.n.) infection taken from acute (day 5) or persistent (day 12) stages of infection. in contrast, the M78 null mutant was cleared more rapidly from the lung and showed negligible replication in the salivary glands. luciferase expression is consistent with down-regulation of early gene expression. comparison of virus titres in the lung showed higher peak titres for M78-LUC (day 5 p.i.) compared with IEp-LUC at each time point examined. luciferase levels from the thorax were significantly higher in IEp-LUC-infected mice in the first few days p.i. in contrast, signals from the neck, first detected in each infected group by day 5 p.i., were significantly higher in M78-LUC-infected mice. i.p. administration of luciferin, lungs (Lu), heart (h), superficial cervical lymph node (SCLN), salivary gland (SG) and noses were harvested at day 5 p.i. the process was repeated for the salivary glands. at day 12 p.i. the process was repeated for the salivary glands. infectious virus was recovered from dissected lungs, salivary glands and noses. quantitative PCR (qPCR) of SCLN confirmed virus colonization at this site despite the absence of productive infection. luciferase levels did not always directly correlate with infectious titres. BALB/c mice were infected i.p. (106 p.f.u.) with either M78-LUC or IEp-LUC (n=6 per virus group) colonization visualized by BLI during acute (day 5) and persistent (day 12) phases of infection. strong luciferase signals were observed from the majority of mice challenged with M78-LUC by day 3 p.i. luciferase+ nose signals were confirmed following dissection. luciferase activity nor virus was detected from the lungs from both virus groups. luciferase readings at natural sites of MCMV entry (nose) and exit (salivary glands) were markedly weaker than IEp-LUC in most tissues following i.p. infection. we used luciferase-tagged wild-type and M33-null viruses to determine if M33 also contributed to early virus colonization. in vivo comparisons, mice were infected with either wild-type M78-LUC or M33/M78-LUC. a nasal/intranasal infection with M33/M78-LUC resulted in luciferase signals in the noses and lungs of live mice at day 5 p.i. BALB/c mice were infected with either M78-LUC or M33/M78-LUC. luciferase signals from dissected organs confirmed spread of both viruses from the footpad to the draining popliteal lymph node (pLN) by day 3 p.i. virus spread to the spleen and salivary glands was detected by day 6 p.i. high levels of infectious virus were recovered from the footpads of both wild-type M78-LUC-infected and M33/M78-LUC-infected mice confirming equivalent colonization of the entry site. tagged viruses allow sensitive, serial monitoring of infections in live hosts. coupling LUC to an endogenous viral promoter reduces transcriptional disruption of the viral genome and ties luciferase expression to a clearly defined phase of the viral life cycle. essentially wild-type growth of M78-LUC in vitro and in vivo. HCMV IEp-LUC and M78-LUC MCMV express luciferase in cells not supporting the full lytic cycle. lack of correlation between luciferase output and infectious virus load at particular sites such as the bone marrow, lymph node and nose. luciferase expression here cannot be considered a guarantee of \u2018normal\u2019 infection. the genome to p.f.u. ratio between tissues during MCMV infection is variable. in visceral organs this ratio is considerably higher than that detected in the salivary glands. as genomes serve as templates for luciferase production these inter-organ differences will likely impact upon the correlative readout of infectious virus load. studies by Bittencourt et al. (2014) showed that M33 was dispensable for haematogenous dissemination to the salivary gland following i.p. MCMV challenge. however, unlike peripheral infection, the i.p. route delivers virus direct to the bloodstream via the thoracic duct. this included poor spread to the spleen, a site colonized by M33-deficient MCMV after i.p. inoculation. mice were injected with 2 mg d-luciferin, anaesthetized with isoflurane and monitored for light emission. organs were quickly dissected and re-monitored for light emission. aliquots were stored at 80 \u00b0C prior to quantification of infectious virus. primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were prepared from 15\u201317-day-old embryos from outbred ARC(s) mice. both DMEM and MEM were supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 100 IU ml1 penicillin, 100 g ml1 streptomycin and 10 % FCS (HyClone, Australia) working stocks of the luciferase-tagged viruses were prepared in NIH-3T3 cells, infected at an m.o.i. of 0.01. Supernatants from virus-infected cells were clarified by centrifugation to remove cell debris (50 g, 10 min), then concentrated 20\u2013100-fold by centrifugation at (35 000 g; 2 h). luciferase expression virus-infected cells were quantified on MEF by cells were lysed in 60 l RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 % NP-40, 0.5 % Na-deoxycholate, 0.1 % SDS, 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM EDTA) proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 5 % rabbit serum in PBS for 1 h at 25 \u00b0C. membrane washed three times (10 mins each wash) to remove unbound primary antibody female BALB/c mice were maintained at the University of Queensland centre for clinical research and used when 6 weeks old. animals were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.; 106 p.f.u. in 0.1 ml), intra-footpad (i.f.; 106 p.f.u. in 50 l), intranasally (i.n.; 5105 p.f.u. in 30 l to anaesthetized mice) primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were prepared from 15\u201317-day-old embryos from outbred ARC(s) mice. both DMEM and MEM were supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 100 IU ml1 penicillin, 100 g ml1 streptomycin and 10 % FCS (HyClone, Australia) working stocks of the luciferase-tagged viruses were prepared in NIH-3T3 cells, infected at an m.o.i. of 0.01.
