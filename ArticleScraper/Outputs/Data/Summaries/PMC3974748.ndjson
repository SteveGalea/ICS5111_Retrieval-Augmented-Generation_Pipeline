{"summary": "shorebird fecal samples indicated the presence of a novel astrovirus and coronavirus. ruddy turnstone sample yielded sequences with homology to deltacoronaviruses. findings highlight the need to closely monitor wild bird populations for the emergence of novel virus variants. the surveillance program was approved by the St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital IACUC protocol #546. the resulting products were purified using MinElute (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and pooled to linkers for sequencing on a GSL FLX Sequencer (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT, USA) phylogenetic analysis was performed using programs of the MEGA 5 software package. multiple sequence alignments were generated with ClustalW. phylogenetic trees constructed based on neighbor joining method. bootstrap values were calculated based on 1000 pseudoreplicates. sequence reads were assembled using Newbler Assembler (v 2.3, 454 Life Sciences) and analyzed at nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) level by using homology search programs Blastn [7] and Fastx [8] against NCBI Refseq and GenBank databases. nested PCR method of Cheung et al. targets mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene. sequencing yielded 182,358 reads with a mean length of 320 nt. three sequences of 357, 468 and 474 nt length showed homology to members of the coronavirus family. two sequences of 436 and 445 nt showed homology to avian astroviruses. analysis of a PCR product obtained with primers matching that sequence indicated approximately 41% identity at aa level to avian nephritis virus 1 (ANV-1). closer inspection of the recovered AstV sequence indicated similarity to trypsin-like peptidase family pfam13365 and to peptidase S7 superfamily pfam 00949 between aa residues 121\u2013164. sanderling astrovirus partial ORF1a sequence (198 aa, marked with a circle) tries to obtain additional sequence flanking the 600 bp region failed. this may reflect compromised nucleic acid quality in the sample material. the sequences recovered from a ruddy turnstone mapped to ORF1ab, spike glycoprotein gene and the 3\u2032 end of CoV genomes. further sequence analysis at aa level revealed 79% identity to magpie-robin CoV HKU18 and sparrow CoV HKU17, both identified in Hong Kong [25] pol sequence of ruddy turnstone CoV shares approx. 86% aa identity with common-moorhen CoV HKU21 from Hong Kong [25], and less related to the IBV-like viruses from the Bering Strait area. pol sequence of ruddy turnstone CoV shares approx. 86% aa identity with common-moorhen CoV HKU21 from Hong Kong [25] the discovery of novel shorebird CoV and AstV sequences in a small sample set demonstrates the potential diversity of novel avian viruses yet to be identified. the area could serve as a useful surveillance site for such novel avian viruses, in addition to influenza viruses."}
