{"summary": "a large number of viruses use sialic acid (Sia) as receptor determinant. the most common type of Sia substitution occurs in a host-, organ- and even cell-specific fashion. the most common type of Sia substitution occurs in a host-, organ- and even cell-specific fashion. toro- and coronaviruses acquired their HE proteins separately via horizontal gene transfer. most nidovirus HEs bind to 9-O-acetylated (9-O-Ac) Sias and, correspondingly, display sialate-9-O-acetylesterase receptor-destroying enzyme activity [25]. a number of 9-O-Ac-Sia-specific nidovirus HEs have been solved [23], [24]. the ectodomain of MHV-S HE (residues 25-403) appears to have involved primarily a change in ligand binding topology and relatively modest changes in RBS architecture. the receptor determinants in HSG could be destroyed by treatment with MHV-S HE-Fc, but not by treatment with BCoV-Mebus HE-Fc. no binding of MHV-S HE0-Fc was observed to bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM), a glycoconjugate devoid of 4-O-Ac-Sias. ectodomain displays sialate-4-O-acetylesterase activity towards the synthetic di-O-acetylated sialic acid analogue Neu4,5,9Ac32Me. peak 3 represents a non-sialic acid compound. domain was assessed by hemagglutination assay with rat erythrocytes. structure determination and overall structure Crystals of free MHV-S HE and a complex of HE0 with Neu4,5Ac22Me diffracted to 2.1 and 2.5 resolution, respectively. the HE of MHV-S closely resembles that of BCoV-Mebus. it assembles into homodimers and the monomers are composed of three modules. the MP domain is virtually identical to that of BCoV-Mebus HE. lectin domain (R, blue) with bound Neu4,5Ac22Me (MHV-S HE) or Neu4,5,9Ac32Me (BCoV-Mebus HE); potassium ion (magenta sphere); esterase domain (E, green); membrane-proximal domain (MP, red). gray segments indicate the signal-peptide (SP) and transmembrane (TM) domain. the MHV-S HE receptor-binding site (RBS) is composed of 5 surface exposed loops, four of which extend from the conserved 8-stranded \u201cSwiss role\u201d core-structure. the R1-, R2- and R4-loops adopt different conformations in the two proteins as result of amino acid insertions in MHV HE. MHV-S HE has a unique receptor-binding site that binds specifically 4-O-acetylated sialic acid. only the R3- and R4-loops differ in conformation. the ligand bound to the HE receptor-binding site is shown in stick representation and the potassium ion as a magenta sphere. surface representation of the MHV-S HE receptor-binding site reveals two pockets accommodating the 4-O- and 5-N-acetyl groups of the receptor. V HE RBS- is conserved in MHV-S HE (comprised of Ile166, Tyr189, Tyr281, and Leu282) but now accepts the Sia 5-N-acetyl group. the hydrophobic patch in the BCoV-Mebus HE RBS changed into a shallow pocket. the residues orthologous to BCoV-Mebus HE Thr114, Leu161, Phe211, and Leu266 the juxtaposition of the Sia 5-N- and 9-O-acetyl moieties is quasi-similar to that of the Sia 4-O- and 5-N-acetyl groups. a pre-existing site for 9-O-Ac-Sia was converted to accommodate 4-O-Ac-Sia instead by (i) having the ligand rotate (with binding of the ligand in the novel orientation facilitated through hydrogen bonding with residues introduced by substitutions ligand binding would seem to be tolerant to modifications at the sia glycerol side chain. MHV-S HE apparently prefers 4-mono-O- over 4,9-di-O-acetylated Sias. he may act as a molecular timer for temporary virion attachment. the time allowed for virions to remain attached would be a function of HE binding affinity/avidity, esterase activity and local Sia density. if within the allotted time, virion attachment would not progress to this next stage of entry. MHV-S HE could contribute to host cell selection, its ligand preference. ectodomain of MHV-S HE was produced by transfection of HEK293 cells. no binding of MHV-S HE0-Fc was observed to bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM), a glycoconjugate devoid of 4-O-Ac-Sias. MHV-S HE0 specifically bound to 4-O-acetylated Sias. the recombinant MHV-S HE proteins are biologically active. hemagglutination assays show that MHV-S HE0 is biologically active. MHV-S HE ectodomain displays sialate-4-O-acetylesterase activity towards the synthetic di-O-acetylated sialic acid analogue Neu4,5,9Ac32Me. peak 3 represents a non-sialic acid compound. a,b,c (o) 92.8,108.8,125.1 91.6,106.6,135.6, (o) 90.0, 90.0, 90.0, 90.0, 90.0, 90.0, 90.0, 90.0 resolution ()* 30-2.1 54.5-2.5 (2.64-2.50) Completeness (96.8) 100.0 (100.0) #Unique reflections 73858(10352) 46670(6706) Multiplicity 7.4(7.4) 7.4 (7.4) MP domain is virtually identical to that of BCoV-Mebus HE with a root mean square difference (rmsd) on main chain C atoms of 0.48. residues in the E domain, that form the catalytic site, were disordered in both crystals. in MHV-S HE two insertions increase the length of loops R3 and R4. boxes indicate the highly conserved residues of the potassium binding site. residues in disordered loops of the esterase domain are indicated in bold. a potassium ion stabilizes the R3-loop and the RBS-hairpin. the potassium ion is coordinated by main chain oxygen atoms of Ser231, Glu280 and Leu282. the residues are conserved in BCoV-Mebus HE and in all other coronavirus HEs with exception of HCoV-HKU1 HE [23] MHV-S HE has a unique receptor-binding site that binds specifically 4-O-acetylated sialic acid. the ligand bound to the HE receptor-binding site is shown in stick representation and the potassium ion as a magenta sphere. hydrophobic pockets are conserved, except they bind different substituents of the receptor analogue. the effect of Ala substitutions on receptor binding was assessed by hemagglutination assay with rat erythrocytes and twofold serial dilutions of each of the HE0-Fc chimeras. the hydrophobic pocket in BCoV-Mebus HE accommodates the 9-O-acetyl moiety of the receptor. the R4-loop in MHV-S HE is reoriented as compared to the one in BCoV-Mebus HE (Figure 4A) these residues form the hydrophobic lining of the newly shaped pocket. as the sia-4-O-acetyl group is crucial for ligand recognition by MHV-S HE, this pocket must be key to receptor-binding. a pre-existing site for 9-O-Ac-Sia was converted to accommodate 4-O-Ac-Sia instead by (i) having the ligand rotate (with binding of the ligand in the novel orientation facilitated through hydrogen bonding with residues introduced by substitutions and/or insertions in the R3 loop) the 9-O- and 5-N-acetyl groups would seem to be spaced too far apart to conveniently dock into the acetyl- ligand binding would seem to be tolerant to modifications at the Sia glycerol side chain. but MHV-S HE apparently prefers 4-mono-O- over 4,9-di-O-acetylated Sias. hemagglutination assay with native and sialate-9-O-acetylesterase-treated erythrocytes suggests hemagglutination. he may act as a molecular timer for temporary virion attachment. the time allowed for virions to remain attached would be a function of HE binding affinity/avidity, esterase activity and local Sia density. if within the allotted time, he-mediated virion attachment would not progress to this next stage of entry. pCD5-MHV-S-HE-T-Fc codes for a chimeric HE protein provided with an N-terminal CD5 signal peptide and preceded by a thrombin cleavage site. pCD5-MHV-S-HE-T-Fc derivatives code for an enzymatically inactive HE-Fc with the esterase catalytic residue Ser45 replaced by Ala (HE0-Fc), and for HE two-fold serial dilutions of HE0-Fc lectins were prepared in blocking buffer (starting concentration 100 g/ml) and 100 l samples of these dilutions were added to the glycoconjugate-coated wells. incubation was continued for 60 min after which unbound lectin was removed by washing three times. two-fold serial dilutions in 50 l PBS, 0.1% BSA of HE0-Fc or purified HE0 ectodomains were mixed with 50 l of a rat erythrocyte suspension. drops were set up with 0.2 l of HE protein solution in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 0.2 l reservoir solution. crystals of MHV-S HE and its complex were flash-frozen after 5 to 10 minutes. data collection and structure solution were collected at ESRF station ID-14-1 and ID-14-3. Molecular replacement was performed using PHASER with BCoV-Mebus HE as template. pCD5-MHV-S-HE-T-Fc was cloned in pCD5-Ig [23], [24], a derivative of expression plasmid S1-Ig [35]. the resulting construct codes for a chimeric HE protein provided with an N-terminal CD5 signal peptide and, at its C-terminus, preceded by a thrombin cleavage site, the Fc domain of human I solid-phase lectin binding assay (SLBA) Maxisorp 96-well plates were coated for 16 hrs at 4\u00b0C with horse serum glycoproteins (HSG; 10% v/v horse serum in PBS) or bovine submaxilary mucin (BSM; 10 mg/ml; Sigma) at 100 l per well. the wells were washed with washing buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween-20) and treated with blocking buffer (PBS the destruction of 4-O-Ac-Sia receptor determinants was determined by SLBA with MHV-S HE0-Fc (5 g/ml in blocking buffer) dilutions in 50 l PBS, 0.1% BSA of HE0-Fc or purified HE0 ectodomains were mixed with 50 l of a rat suspension. crystals of HE0 were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen using reservoir solution containing 20% (w/v) glycerol as the cryoprotectant. crystals of HE0 were soaked by adding 2 l of 10 mM Neu4,5,9Ac32Me in cryoprotectant solution directly into the margin of the drop. modeling of chain A residues 397-401 and chain B residues 334-337 should be considered tentative.
