{"summary": "influenza is an acute disease of the respiratory system and is present worldwide. the antigenic mutation capacity of the influenza A virus can cause pandemics with great social and economic repercussions 1. the signs and symptoms of influenza are nonspecific: sudden fever, cough, headache, muscle pain, joint pain and coryza1. a descriptive study was conducted by using 2009 and 2010 secondary data. the aim of this study was to recover the epidemiological history of the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Brazil. the population data were provided by the 2000-2012 estimates used in the publication \"Sade no Brasil [Health in Brazil] - 2012\" for the cumulative incidence in pregnant women, the estimate of the number of pregnant women at the time, calculated as the number of live births in the previous year plus 10%, was considered in the denominator 12, 13. RESULTS One hundred seventy-three (0.16%) duplicities were identified and excluded. out of the confirmed cases, 52,827 (98.2%) were notified in the year 2009 and 970 (1.8%) in 2010. among the confirmed cases, 65.8% were classified by a clinical-epidemiological criterion. 35 8.4 25.8 15 - 19 5,211 9.9 30.5 20 - 29 13,065 24.7 38.5 30 - 39 8,045 15.2 27.5 40 - 49 5,428 10.3 22.4 50 - 59 3,737 7.1 21.1 60 - 69 1,506 2.8 13.7 70 - 79 756 1.4 12.4 80 319 0.6 11.4 Total 52,827 100.00 28.0 According to the ethnic group/skin color, 38,111 (79 the presence of comorbidities was notified in 32.5% of the cases. chronic pneumopathy (26.35%), smoking (23.96%) and chronic cardiopathy (13.09%) were the most frequent symptoms. three hundred and seventy-eight samples were processed by both, RT-PCR and culture. 132 (92.96%) were also positive by RT-PCR, eight (5.63%) were negative. one sample (0.42%) of a negative culture was inconclusive by RT-PCR. when pregnant women (yes/no) and the presence of comorbidities (yes/no) were compared, the OR was 1.15 (95% CI -1.06-1.23). the case-fatality rate (225/3,267) was 6.9%. the system is comprised of healthcare units distributed throughout all Brazilian States, and uses an online information system, the Sivep Gripe 17. all suspected cases of seasonal influenza or human influenza by new subtype outbreaks must be notified to the Brazilian Information System on notifiable diseases (SINAN) s in the south and southeast regions during winter (June-August) and in the north and northeast regions, during rainy periods. however, in tropical and subtropical countries, there may be peaks during the year in the dynamics of the seasonal influenza A. this behavior is associated with climate aspects (temperature, humidity), solar radiation, possibly with levels of vitamin D, the host immunity and the viral strain 23. a slight increase in the proportion of pregnant women who present comorbidities when compared with the general population. the severity of infection by the influenza virus may be related to alterations that the gestational process triggers in women, such as the overburden of the circulation, as well as of the respiratory and immunologic systems. we have found a minimal proportion between cases that had been in contact with dead or sick birds within 10 days before the signs and symptoms onset. despite the genetic rearrangement of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus 32 and reports of infection by the variant of the swine influenza virus in humans. patients with the characteristic severe influenza triad, age 2 years or > 60 years, those in use of immunosuppressants and bearers of chronic diseases are the most vulnerable groups for the worsening of the infection caused by the pandemic. the case-fatality rate was calculated by using different populations, times and places, creating biases in possible comparisons 9, 48, 49. limitations were described by several authors that conducted studies using secondary data related to: data quality, difficulty and heterogeneity when filling the disease reporting form. the national tendency is that the influenza virus spreads in the south and southeast regions during winter (June-August) and in the north and northeast regions, during rainy periods. however, in tropical and subtropical countries, there may be peaks during the year in the dynamics of the seasonal influenza A. 81.2% of the population in the country were registered as residents of urban areas. a minority of the cases was vaccinated against influenza or had received the anti-pneumococcal vaccine. the national vaccination strategy against pandemic influenza was organized to occur in five stages. in 2010, an important reduction in the number of cases of flu, in morbidity and mortality rates was observed probably due to this extensive vaccination campaign. despite the genetic rearrangement of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus 32 and reports of infection by the variant of the swine influenza virus in humans after contact with sick pigs 33, the analysis of this kind of exposure did not contribute to the investigation. patients with the characteristic severe influenza triad, age 2 years or > 60 years, those in use of immunosuppressants, bearers of chronic diseases and pregnant women are the most vulnerable groups for the worsening of the infection caused by the pandemic. the interstitial infiltrate found in the thoracic x-ray is not deemed in the differential diagnosis as it is seen in several diseases, usually referring to inflammatory processes or, yet, in cases of infection by the pandemic influenza virus suggesting an exacerbated immunological response 47. Limitations We had the same difficulty reported concerning the incidence rate. orial region had a low number of notified cases during the peak period (winter) this is an important situation that must be investigated by the Influenza Surveillance Services in order to understand the geographic distribution pattern of the pandemic. the investigation on the status regarding trips or contacts lost importance, with the clinical severity of new cases becoming the focus."}
