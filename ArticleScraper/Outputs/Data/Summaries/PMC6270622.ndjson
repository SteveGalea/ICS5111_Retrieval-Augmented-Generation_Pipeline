{"summary": "the birth of modern organic chemistry is taught to start from this experiment, which once and for all excluded the presence of \u201cvis-vitalis\u201d. in 1856 Ugo Schiff moved out of Germany because of his Jewish origins and political ideas and spent six years in Bern before reaching Italy where he remained. Hugo Schiff began teaching chemistry as assistant professor at the university of Pisa. he was nominated professor at the Regio Istituto di Studi Superiori Pratici e di Perfezionamento of Florence. the physical properties and reactivity of imines are studied by more than a hundred years. a large variety of Schiff bases are easily found in any current dedicated textbook. Ugo Schiff was born in Frankfurt on the 26 April 1834. in 1856, Ugo Schiff moved out of Germany because of his Jewish origins and political ideas. in 1856 he moved out of Germany because of his Jewish origins and political ideas. he spent six years in Bern before reaching Italy where he remained for the rest of his career. imines are compounds that are represented by the general formula R3R2C=NR1. the substituent at the N-imino (C=N) may be alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, hydrogen or metallo (usually Si, Al, B, Sn) the physical properties and reactivity of imines are easily found in any current dedicated textbook. aliphatic ketones react with amines to form imines more slowly than aldehydes. aliphatic ketones react with amines to form imines more slowly than aldehydes. aliphatic ketones require harsh conditions to be converted into imines. aldehydes and ketones are mostly obtained from the corresponding alcohols via oxidative process. a mild and efficient method of amine oxidation has been reported by Huang and Largeron (Scheme 4). the reaction is performed by mixing the nitrile and phenol in ether and saturating the solution with gaseous HCl. the reaction is performed by mixing the nitrile and phenol in ether and saturating the solution with gaseous HCl. elaborations to azadiene have been fully explored by the Barluenga [60,61,62], Ghosez [63,64] and Panunzio groups [65,66,67,68,69] elaborations to azadiene have been fully explored by the barluenga [60,61,62], Ghosez [63,64] and Panunzio groups [65,66,67,68,69] a Nitrile [59,79,80,81,82] Scheme 11 illustrates the general procedure used to prepare metalloimines starting from nitriles 35 and a suitable organometallic reagent either by hydrometallation to give compounds of general formula 36 or by alkylation to give compounds of general formula 37. scheme 11.
