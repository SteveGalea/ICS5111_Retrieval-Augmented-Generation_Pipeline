{"summary": "adenovirus disassembly is initiated at the capsid vertices by the binding of cell surface integrins. cell-intrinsic defenses counteract uncoating through the binding of defensins. integrin binding softens the vertex, while defensin binding reinforces it. only one coronavirus nsp1 structure has been determined thus far. nsp1 proteins from betacoronavirus share a similar fold. nsp1 proteins from alpha- and betacoronavirus genera share a similar fold. six new insect-specific viruses are isolated from mosquitoes and phlebotomine sand flies. they are common in hematophagous insects and have a broad host range. potential effects of negevirus infection on insect behavior, fertility, fecundity, and survival are currently unknown."}
