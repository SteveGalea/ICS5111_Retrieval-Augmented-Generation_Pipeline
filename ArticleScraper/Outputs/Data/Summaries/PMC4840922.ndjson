{"summary": "lentiviral vector technology has progressed considerably toward the goal of creating a vehicle with the ability to efficiently, safely, and persistently express a transgene in the appropriate cell types. many features of lentiviral vectors make them attractive vehicles for delivering therapeutic genes, including their large transgene-packaging capacity, efficient gene transfer capabilities. IFITMs are the only known host restriction factors to block a prefusion step in virus replication. studies suggest that the prefusion restriction is a result of IFITM presence in the endosomal membrane that renders it unable to achieve conformational changes in membrane curvature required for hemifusion. vectors were produced and titered by the university of Iowa Viral Vector Core (Iowa City, IA; www.medicine.uiowa.edu/vectorcore). the FIV vector system used in this study expressed firefly luciferase or green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the FIV3.3RSV backbone. total protein was sonicated, loaded onto 15% Tris-HCl gels (4569035; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and run at 100 V in Tris\u2013tricine/SDS buffer (1610734; Bio-Rad) diluted to 1. membranes were blocked overnight in 5% milk and incubated with mouse monoclonal primary antibody against C9 tag (diluted 1:1000) fetal bovine serum (10082139; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was treated with either doxycycline (1 g/ml) or vehicle (buffered culture medium) for 24 hr before transduction with FIV expressing GFP. cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde, harvested, and suspended. mice were injected intraperitoneally with 200 l of d-luciferin (15 mg/ml in 1 phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] using a 25-gauge needle. after 5 min, mice were imaged with the Xenogen IVIS charge-coupled device camera while under 1\u20133% isoflurane anesthetization. negative controls in all in vivo bioluminescence assays were naive strain matched mouse and pig sequences were cloned with an N-terminal nine-amino acid epitope from bovine rhodopsin (the C9 epitope) the amplified sequences were then gel purified and subcloned into a pcDNA4.0 backbone. pig IFITM1 sequence (KT873488) differed from the NCBI sequence (NM_001201382) by two nucleotides. a synonymous thymine-to-cytosine change at nucleotide position 57. a thymine-to-cytosine change resulting in an isoleucine-to-threonine change at amino acid position 117. PCR was performed on a 7900HT fast real-time PCR machine. analysis was performed with Applied Biosystems SDS 2.3 software. two-tailed, unpaired Student t tests were used to compare experimental treatment group with no-doxycycline control. T-REx HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA4/TO/myc-His (V1030-20; Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific) plasmids encoding individual IFITM genes. these transfected cells were then selected in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) supplemented with blasticidin at 5 g/ml. Membranes were washed and then incubated for 45 min at room temperature. a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (diluted 1:5000) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine\u2013xylazine. methylcellulose increases viral vector gene transfer efficiency in nasal and intrapulmonary airways without disrupting transepithelial resistance. human IFITM1 (Cat. No. DC00426), IFITM2 (Cat. No. DC02727) and IFITM3 (Cat. No. DC02019) expression vectors in a pcDNA4.0 backbone with an N-terminal c-Myc tag were purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA) pig IFITM and mouse IFITM expression vectors were generated by designing sequence specific primers. pigs were cloned with an N-terminal nine-amino acid epitope from bovine rhodopsin (the C9 epitope) for detection via immunocytochemistry. pig IFITM3 differed from the NCBI sequence (NM_001201382) by two nucleotides. cellular RNA was harvested from eight donor cultures of both nasal turbinate and tracheal cells using TRIzol\u2013chloroform extraction. a high-capacity reverse transcriptase PCR was performed with a high-capacity reverse transcriptase kit (4368813; Thermo Fisher Scientific) primers were designed with software available through the IDT website. GP64-FIV transduced mouse nasal airways with greater efficiency than the intrapulmonary airways. this observation was true both in vivo and in well-differentiated primary cultures. the levels of IFITM were detectable only in the presence of doxycycline. for the restriction assay, cells were treated with doxycycline or vehicle for 24 hr. the native VSV \u201cG\u201d envelope glycoprotein has reproducibly been shown to be restricted22. Western blots were performed on cells incubated in the presence or absence of doxycycline. cells stably expressing mIFITM1 were incubated without (solid columns) or with (shaded columns) doxycycline for 24 hr. the procedure was repeated for cells stably expressing (C) mIFITM2 and (D) mIFITM3. Ifitm1, Ifitm2, and Ifitm3 levels were 2- to 4-fold higher than that of the reference gene, suggesting that Ifitm is expressed (at least at the mRNA level in our stimulated cell lines in vitro and in mouse trachea in vivo. the transduction efficiency of GP64-FIV-Luc was examined in nasal and tracheal epithelia of IFITM locus knockout mice (\u2013/\u2013), hemizygous littermates, or wild-type (+/+) littermates. pig and human IFITMs share the greatest homology, ranging in protein similarity from 73 to 81%. pig, pig, and mouse (mse) IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 expression levels are identical for all three species. two dots indicate a conserved substitution; one dot indicates a semiconserved substitution. expression levels in pigs were not different between the two tissue types. human IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 cell lines significantly restricted GP64-FIV. VSVG-FIV was also significantly restricted by each IFITM. MACV-FIV was not significantly restricted by any of the IFITMs. real-time RT-PCR was used to compare basal mRNA levels of known host restriction factors in the nasal septa and trachea of mice. the basal mRNA expression levels of IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 were all elevated in mouse tracheal tissue as compared with the nasal septa. MACV is a new world arenavirus that is reported not to be subject to IFITM restriction22 and serves as a negative control. the native VSV \u201cG\u201d envelope glycoprotein has reproducibly been shown to be restricted22 and thus serves as a positive control. cells were washed and 4 days later the percentage of GFP-positive cells was quantified by fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis. the procedure was repeated for cells stably expressing (C) mIFITM2 and (D) mIFITM3. the knockout mice, termed IfitmDel, were first described by Lange and colleagues. these mice lack Ifitm1, Ifitm2, Ifitm3, Ifitm5, and Ifitm6 genes. we observed significantly increased levels of gene transfer in both the nose and lung of knockout mice. inescence imaging was conducted 7 days after vector delivery. for nasal imaging, mice were laid in the prone position. for lung imaging mice were laid in the supine position. regions of interest are indicated with dotted circles. expression levels in pigs were not different between the two tissue types. the results were consistent with microarray results comparing pig turbinate and tracheal epithelia. no differences were observed in other putative restriction factors such as tetherin, MOV10, or TRIM5. cells stably expressing human IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 were incubated without (solid columns) or with doxycycline for 24 hr. then challenged with VSV-G-FIV-GFP, GP64-FIV-GFP, or MACV-FIV-GFP for 4 hr. results are plotted as average relative transduction compared with the no-doxycyline group standard error. the mice used in the previous study were deficient only in type I interferon signaling and retained functional type II (IFN-) and type III (IFN-) interferon signaling. these redundancies may explain why the interferon receptor / knockout mice were phenotypically identical to wild-type mice in terms of lentiviral gene transfer properties. IFITMs restrict transduction of lentivirus-based vectors in both pig and human airway cells. mouse, pig, and human IFITMs also restricted VSV-G-pseudotyped FIV, an envelope widely used in gene transfer applications. previous studies investigating IFITM-mediated restriction focused on replication-competent enveloped viruses. studies suggest that amphotericin B may provide such a reagent. the results identify the IFITM family of proteins as novel barriers to GP64-mediated lentiviral gene transfer. the authors thank Anna Locke for technical assistance."}
