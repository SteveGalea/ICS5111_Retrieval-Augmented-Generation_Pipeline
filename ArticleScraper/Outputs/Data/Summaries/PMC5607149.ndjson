{"summary": "many viruses take advantage of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) attached to cell-associated proteoglycans to initiate cell infection. this is also the case for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), a ubiquitous human pathogen. a multitude of relatively weak (17) protein-carbohydrate interactions need to act in concert and with high spatiotemporal organization. these multivalent interactions allow for a tight control of the nature of the interaction, including modulation of affinity and specificity. the initial attachment of a virus to the cell surface is often of weak nature, followed by the establishment of multiple interactions between several viral attachment proteins and cellular receptor molecules. identifying dynamic processes relevant to virus attachment and entry is a key step toward the development of new anti-viral therapies and vaccines. identifying characteristic behaviors and thereby gaining further knowledge about the processes modulating the interaction between virus and cell surface is a key step toward the development of new anti-viral therapies and vaccines. 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (cap biotinyl) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) poly-L-lysine-grafted-polyethylene glycol (PLL-g-PEG and PLL-g-PEG-biot low-molecular-weight hyaluronan (HA) was prepared as described in (32). CS was a mixture of 70% chondroitin-4-sulfate and 30% chondroitin-6-sulfate. HS was derived from porcine intestinal mucosa and conjugated with biotin at their reducing end via oxime ligation. the 2 mg/mL lipid solution was extruded 11 times through a polycarbonate membrane (Whatman) using a mini extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids) the virus strain was purified from infectious culture media of GMK AH1 cells through a three-step discontinuous sucrose gradient. the purified solution was stored as aliquots of 25 L at 80\u00b0C until use. siO2 chips were stored overnight in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; Sigma-Aldrich) and rinsed with milli-Q water. the chips were then cleaned for 15 min with ultraviolet-ozone. the sensitivity at 670 nm has been measured to be 109.68 deg/dn. lipids were 0.18 mL/g (43), SA was 0.18 mL/g (44), HA was 0.16 mL/g (45), CS and sHA were 0.147 mL/g (48, 49, 50), and HS was 0.132 mL/g (48, 49, 50). TIRF microscopy microscope cover glasses were boiled for >1 h in a 10% 7 detergent/Milli-Q solution. the glasses were rinsed with Milli-Q water and dried under N2 flow right before use. 5 L of 0.5 mg/mL SA were added to 5 L of remaining solution. the remaining solution was rinsed 10 times with 15\u201320 L of PBS. the same rinsing process was repeated and 5 L of biotinylated GAGs were added. SPT All SPT data analysis was done using homemade scripts written in MATLAB. tracking was implemented using local nearest-neighbor linking (51) and the dependence between mean-square displacement (MSD) and lag time ( t) was calculated for each observed track using the internal averaging procedure (52). fitting the MSD curves using Eqs. 2 and 3 allows the complex diffusion behavior of HSV-1 to be quantified. the ratio of particles exhibiting anomalous diffusion was calculated as the number of tracks assigned to anomalous diffusion divided by the total number of tracks. MATLAB scripts were written in house. only particles with an intensity higher than a set threshold (th_high) and a pixel size (rem_size) >3 were detected. the slope of the association curves was averaged over n 3 observations. association rates per GAG were calculated by dividing the measured association rates with the concentration of virus in solution. the use of the viral DNA count as the particle concentration of the virus suspension assumes that each virus particle comprises one copy of viral DNA. this is considered accurate, since the vast majority of virions comprise one DNA-containing capsid, as observed by electron microscopy. hyaluronan (HA) was prepared as described in (32) and served as starting material for synthetically sulfated hyaluronan (sHA) HS was derived from porcine intestinal mucosa and conjugated with biotin at their reducing end via oxime ligation. na DSSulfateb Hyaluronan HA 23 57 0 Sulfated hyaluronan sHA 30 42 3.1 Chondroitin sulfate CS 20 41 0.9 Heparan sulfate HS 12 22 1.4 a Average number of disaccharide units per GAG chain. a total mass of 2 mg was mixed as a ratio of 1 wt % DOPE-biotin in POPC the virus suspension was fluorescently labeled using PKH26 red fluorescent cell linker dye and diluent C. 3 L of dye (0.5 mM in ethanol) were mixed with 25 L of virus solution using 500 L of diluent C diluting agent. biotinylated HA and sHA were immobilized on the SLB + SA layer. biotinylated CS and HS were injected at concentrations of 0.5 and 0.1 mg/mL. all solutions were prepared in PBS. mL/g (44, 46, 47), and HS was 0.132 mL/g (48, 49, 50) all results were averaged over n 3 observations. all error intervals indicate standard deviations. TIRF microscopy microscope glasses were boiled for >1 h in a 10% 7 detergent/Milli-Q solution. the glasses were rinsed with Milli-Q water and dried under N2 flow right before use. for the control experiment using 5% biotin, we added 10 L of 0.1 mg/mL PLL-g-PEG + 20 vol% PLL-g-PEG/PEG-biotin instead of the vesicles. all following steps of surface functionalization were kept identical. MSD = L C 2 3 ( 1 exp [ 12 D C t L C 2 ] ) + 0, (3) with D and D C denoting the extracted diffusion coefficients for normal or anomalous diffusion, respectively, L C the length scale of confinement (in the case of anomalous diffusion. a linear relationship (such as Eq. 2) to the MSD curves for small t allows the complex diffusion behavior of HSV-1 to be quantified. the ratio of particles exhibiting anomalous diffusion was calculated as the number of tracks assigned to anomalous diffusion divided by the total number of tracks. particle drifts were neglected by allowing a particle to move a maximum of spot_rad = 5 pixels between two consecutive frames and still be considered as firmly bound. association rates were calculated by counting the number of newly arrived particles over time. dissociation events detected by the software were visually inspected to exclude events originating from diffusing particles. the final number of dissociation events was then divided by the total number of associated particles to estimate the percentage of dissociating particles. a biomimetic surface consisting of GAG chains end-grafted onto sensor surfaces was implemented. the platform was constructed taking advantage of the high binding affinity between biotin and SA to attach reducing-end-biotinylated GAGs to an SA-modified surface. in this case, a biotinylated supported lipid bilayer (SLB) was used as support. the surface modification process was monitored in real time using MP-SPR sensing. the surface modification process was monitored in real time using MP-SPR sensing. a typical sensorgram is shown in Fig. 1 B. a typical TIRF image of HSV-1 bound to CS is shown in Fig. 2 A. to demonstrate the specificity of the HSV-1 interaction to sulfated GAGs, we tested virus binding to (nonsulfated) HA, which resulted in significantly reduced virus attachment. an additional peak was observed at higher D values. these values are two to three orders of magnitude larger than the apparent D of immobile virions. the corresponding D values cannot be explained taking only localization noise into consideration. the peak coefficients were determined using log-normal fitting, i.e., by fitting first the peak associated to immobile virions, which dominated the D histogram. this was implemented in a two-step approach by fitting first the peak associated to immobile virions. this followed by fitting the tail of the distribution again with a Gaussian function while keeping the parameters of the first fit fixed. anomalous diffusion behavior showed a trend for higher diffusion coefficients on native CS and HS in comparison to artificially sulfated sHA. the overall fastest diffusion was indeed measured on the native GAGs. quantitatively explain the range of the small HSV-1 D values observed in the diffusion coefficient distributions. additional experiments were performed to elucidate the actual role of GAG chain mobility. despite this drastic reduction in GAG chain mobility, the diffusive behavior of HSV-1 was widely unaffected. the observed mobility of HSV-1 on the immobilized GAG surfaces is caused by multivalently attached virions undergoing a lateral \u201cwobbling\u201d movement caused by the disruption and reformation of single bonds with the surface (28). it is further supported by the presence of anomalous diffusion, which requires broad distributions of the release times (i.e., the time required to release a bound virus) (67), a feature previously observed when studying virus release kinetics. a higher chain and sulfate density would theoretically result in a higher number of bonds created between the virion and the GAG surface. this suggests that the diffusion coefficient depends on the nature of the GAG chain, and that the arrangement and patterns of sulfation along the native GAG chains may influence the virus mobility. this trend is not resolved for HSV-1 particles showing normal diffusion. sulfation and arrangement of sulfate groups along the GAG chain influences the HSV/GAG interaction kinetics. to study interaction kinetics of single HSV-1 particles with the immobilized GAGs, we further used TIRF-based equilibrium fluctuation analysis (30) measured association rates for sHA, CS, HS, and HA. significant shifts (p 0.05) are indicated. the association rate is directly proportional to the association rate constant. a major complication for the estimation of binding constants originates from the determination of the receptor concentration, max. the glycoproteins on the viral envelope are likely to bind to clusters of sulfate groups on the GAG chain, raising the question whether max is more accurately determined by the density of GAG chains or the density of sulfate groups. the highest binding propensities were obtained for native CS, with on average 3 times more particles per GAG binding to CS in comparison to association rates and corresponding association rate per Sulfate group estimates for the Different GAG Surfaces Association Rate (102/cm2s) association rate per GAG (102/Ms) sHA 2.2 0.4 12.5 3.2 CS 3.7 0.4 40.2 17.5 HS 3.4 1.5 4.1 1.9 HA 0.2 0.1 0.47 0.16. our previous investigations on purified gC glycoproteins (58) did not reveal any significant differences in apparent binding affinities of gC to CS or chemically sulfated sHA. however, our data clearly indicate that gC has a higher propensity to dissociate from the CS layer than from sHA. this characteristic is likely to confer a higher surface sampling capability to the virus. synthetically sulfated sHA is the only nonsulfated GAG in this study. sHA presents on average two to three times more sulfate groups than native CS and HS. sHA presents on average two to three times more sulfate groups than native CS and HS. the highest coverage was obtained for HS, CS, sHA, and HA respectively. TIRF microscopy was used to visualize individual GAG-bound HSV virions. time-lapse movies were acquired after equilibration but without rinsing. the extracted mean-square displacement curves were calculated from single-particle trajectories. they showed indications of anomalous diffusion for a notable fraction of HSV-1 trajectories. this peak was attributed to immobile HSV-1 virions, as its nonzero value can be fully explained by localization noise. mobile tracks (D > 3.2 105m2/s for anomalous diffusion and D > 1 106m2/s for normal diffusion) for sHA, CS, and HS, showing a trend toward higher diffusion coefficients for native GAGs. anomalous Diffusion Normal Diffusion Fraction of Virus Particles for Different GAGs Anomalous Diffusion D (106m2/s) Immobile Peak D (104m2/s) Mobile Peak Mobile Fraction D (108m2/s) Immobile Peak D (106m2/s) Mobile Peak Mobile Fraction sHA 1.19 0.07 2.71 0.63 0.35 0.07 4.66 0.42. the immobile fraction of adsorbed SA molecules was 55.6 2.5%. the remaining SA molecules had an average diffusion coefficient of 0.67 0.02 m2/s. diffusion was not affected by the type of bound GAG chain. AG chain mobility has little influence on the HSV-1 mobility under the given experimental conditions. we exchanged the underlying SLB with a PLL-g-PEG layer containing 10% of PEG-biotin, previously used for similar surface modifications. the advantage of this approach is the complete absence of diffusing GAG chains. high abundance of GAGs in the extracellular matrix and close to the cell surface could provide the means for HSV-1 diffusion in vivo. the highest chain density was measured for HS and was four to five times higher than that measured for sHA. the length of the GAGs was only about one-tenth to one-fifth of the virus diameter. this indicates that the virus does not penetrate into the glycan layer. entanglement with the polymer chain is unlikely to significantly affect the observed diffusive behavior. association rates to sHA, CS, HS, and HS appear to be in similar range, but with significantly more particles binding to CS than to sHA (Fig. 4 B). sulfated HA (negative control) was observed for all three sulfated GAGs, whereas only a few particles bound to the nonsulfated HA. we predicted association rates that were at least one order of magnitude higher than the measured association rates. a calculation of the association rate constants, kon, from the obtained data of association rates (Table 4) is not straightforward for complex systems like the multivalent HSV-GAG interaction. the highest binding propensities were obtained for native CS, with on average 3 times more particles per GAG binding to CS in comparison to sHA. this enhanced association behavior could be an indication for a preference of HSV to bind to specific arrangements of sulfates on native GAGs. gC-GAG interaction kinetics showed increased HSV-1 association rates to native CS in comparison to chemically sulfated sHA. results suggest higher overall binding affinities of the virus to CS in comparison to sHA. this contrasts with the observed faster diffusion of HSV-1 on CS. this characteristic is likely to confer a higher surface sampling capability to the virus. our results showed that HSV-1 efficiently binds to native CS and HS, but not to nonsulfated HA. all authors read and approved the manuscript. improvements and suggestions from all authors."}
