{"summary": "264 detections of H5 or H7 viruses in poultry across 20 states. most were during the outbreak of infection with gs/GD H5 HPAI virus during 2014\u20132015. 4,555 responders were potentially exposed to a virus. there were no data on persons potentially exposed in response to detection of reassortant H5N1 virus in wild birds. no data on persons potentially exposed in response to detection of reassortant virus in wild birds. conjunctivitis, 7 sore throat, 4 rhinorrhea, 3 muscle ache, and 2 difficulty breathing were tested within 2 d of illness onset. one responder infected with coronavirus reported coughing and sneezing. cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/h5/infected-birds-exposure.htm revised the recommendations for monitoring illness in responders. we recommend passive monitoring (i.e., self-report if ill) for persons wearing adequate PPE. the change in procedure will substantially reduce the workload for safety officers and public health officials. study of 23 countries in Europe on outbreaks of infection with gs/GD/96 virus in poultry during 2016\u20132017 reported no infections among 524 exposed persons. globally, many more persons have likely been exposed, but no human infections with gs/GD/96 H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses have been reported."}
