{"summary": "the most widely known frameshifting mechanism involves shifting to the \u20131 frame. this is because of the relatively well-defined nature of the most commonly used shift site motif that allows two adjacent tRNAs to re-pair to mRNA in the \u20131 frame. the other reading frame can be accessed by either a \u20132 or a +1 frameshift event. +1 frameshifting is used in the expression of the Tsh gene of several Listeria phages and Bacillus subtilis SPP1 phage, besides Escherichia coli yepP. pol gene of the S. cerevisiae retrotransposons Ty1 and Ty3 is also expected to be +1 [15\u201314] the viral polymerase, and the N-terminal domain carries an endonuclease activity that, as part of PA, cleaves capped RNA fragments from cellular pre-mRNAs. as PA-X, the N-terminal domain appears to play a role in host cell shut-off, presumably by cleaving host mRNAs. GR corresponds to three detected peptides GES...LLK, HRF...EGR and FEI...EGR. the inset shows the peptide sequence with \u2018b-\u2019 and \u2018y\u2019-type fragment ions. additional fragment ions, corresponding to H2O losses from b and y series ions and doubly charged fragment ions, are also present in the spectrum. frameshift expression would result in the transframe fusion PA-X-GFP. non-frameshift expression would result in a product that does not contain GFP. a gel slice containing this protein was excised, digested with trypsin. peptide GLWDSFVSPR is compatible with \u20132 frameshifting. it is compatible with three different models for frameshifting. a low level of slippage on UCC_U cannot be ruled out. frameshifting is stimulated in part by the presence of a stop codon in the A-site. at the influenza PA-X shift site, P-site slippage on the UUU_C tetranucleotide may be stimulated by the rare CGU codon in the A-site. mutating the CGU to the more commonly used arginine codon, CGG, reduced frameshifting by 50% [30] 5.1 16.1 3.8 CGA 3.8 6.2 5.3 11.4 6.4 6.3 CGG 6.2 11.4 9.7 4.1 13.4 4.9 The role of UCC in the E-site remains uncertain. mutating the codon to AGC (serine) or to GGG, CCC or AAA resulted in a 40 to 70 per cent reduction in the frameshifting efficiency. frameshifting by +1 nt has been predicted as the expression mechanism for non-5\u2032-proximal ORFs in eukaryote-infecting viruses. in most of these species, the site of frameshifting remained elusive. some of these shift sites are well supported by comparative genomic analysis. the efficiency of frameshifting at such sites is likely low. however, these levels may be completely compatible with the expression level requirements of some viruses. dual luciferase reporter constructs and assays Sequences encompassing the frameshift site (97 nt 5\u2032+UCC_UUU_CGU+100 nt 3\u2032) were generated using overlapping synthetic oligonucleotides. the 3\u2032 firefly luciferase ORF is in the +1 frame relative to the 5\u2032 renilla luciferase ORF, so that frameshifting within the inserted sequence results protein purification To create the PA-X-GFP expression construct, the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the coding region of PA-X, minus the X-ORF stop codon, was amplified from a reverse genetics plasmid. to avoid PA-X auto-repressing its own synthesis, the active site was inactivated via the mutation D108A. mass spectrometric analysis Gel slices containing proteins of interest were excised. nano-LC with nano-electrospray was used with a 75 m ID column (C18) and an acetonitrile gradient (0.1% formic acid) primary mass spectra of peptide molecular ions were obtained in the FT-ICR part of the instrument. the 3\u2032 firefly luciferase ORF is in the +1 frame relative to the 5\u2032 renilla luciferase ORF. frameshifting within the inserted sequence results in a fusion of both ORFs. an in-frame control, which was identical except that the shift site was mutated to UCC_UUC_GUC, was also constructed. minus the X-ORF stop codon, was amplified from a reverse genetics plasmid. was cloned into pEGFP-N1 using standard techniques. site-directed mutagenesis was used to delete cytosine skipped during frameshifting. nano-LC with nano-electrospray was used with a 75 m ID column (C18) and an acetonitrile gradient (0.1% formic acid) primary mass spectra of peptide molecular ions were obtained in the FT-ICR part of the instrument. both oxidized (i.e. addition of O, occurring at methionine, tryptophan or histidine) and non-oxidized forms were identified for many peptides"}
