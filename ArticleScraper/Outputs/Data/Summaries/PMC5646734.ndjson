{"summary": "foodborne Viruses and Detection are closely related to human lives and health conditions. foodborne viruses, among all other pathogens, are relatively new. global public food safety issues have been increasing in recent years. effective food safety monitoring can be used to monitor and control food quality at a large scale, across production points from manufacture to food consumption. current food safety and its monitoring and assessment practices do not meet expectations, mostly due to the high cost of traditional laboratory tests and time consuming operations. current foodborne viruses are focused on norovirus, rotavirus, and hepatitis viruses. the most common foodborne viruses are norovirus, rotavirus, and hepatitis viruses. these viruses can either be single or double stranded, and either RNA or DNA viruses. a total of eight genotypes out of 29 known genotypes cause infection in humans. noroviruses are responsible for 70% and 50% of waterborne enteritis. symptoms include vomiting, gastralgia, fever, diarrhea, and death due to dehydration in children and elderly. hepatitis A virus infections are the leading cause of viral hepatitis. the cost of foodborne hepatitis A is estimated to be more than 36,000 U.S. dollars per individual in the united states. hepatitis B virus is transmitted by contact with infected individuals through blood or other body fluids 23. it is at high risk when the viral concentration reaches 105 copies/mL. exposure to contaminated blood or body fluids is considered to be major transmission routes for the virus. norovirus is an RNA virus in the family Caliciviridae causing more than 90% of non-bacterial gastroenteritis outbreaks in the united states 10. a total of eight genotypes out of 29 known genotypes of norovirus cause infection in humans. norovirus is very stable in the environment and highly contagious, requiring only a low infectious dose. the virus strongly resists heat up to 60\u00b0C, as well as acid and chlorine in tap water up to 6.25 mg/L. it causes 19-21 million illness in the united states annually 13. hepatitis A virus is a small, single stranded, and non-enveloped RNA virus of the Picornaviridae family 18. it can be grouped into I, II and III genotypes based on its genomic characterisation. the cost of foodborne hepatitis A is estimated to be more than 36,000 U.S. dollars per individual in the united states. hepatitis B virus is a single stranded RNA virus with positive sense in the family Hepeviridae 24. it is at high risk when the viral concentration reaches 105 copies/mL. the cost of foodborne hepatitis A is estimated to be more than 36,000 U.S. dollars per individual in the united states. hepatitis B virus infection is the tenth leading cause of death and a major health threat globally 22. hepatitis E virus spreads via the fecal-oral route from contaminated food and water 25. it usually causes acute infection with increasing numbers of autochthonous events occurring globally, including in Europe. a point-of-care concept has been introduced to food testing technology and devices. it refers to biochemical technology whenever the medical care is needed at or near the site of patient care. advantages are minimal sample volumes, widening accessibility, rapid analysis time, and reduced costs. several cell phone based devices are commercially available or under intensive development to provide cost-effective mobile POC detection (Figure 2) 32. paper based, and lab-on-a-chip platforms pave the way to simplified, automated, robust, and low-cost detection of foodborne viruses. current progress on the development of POC technologies focuses on foodborne bacterial detection, which is far more advanced than foodborne virus detection 35.

SPR transducer based biosensors are one of the most advanced real time and label-free sensors 91. it measures the refractive index on a metal surface with very thin nanomaterial layers. other interactions can be detected, such as enzyme-substrate and complementary DNA-DNA binding actions. an electrochemical biosensor uses a concanavalin A (ConA) conjugated gold electrode to capture noroviruses selectively 11. it is sensitive, selective, fast, and most importantly, does not require a pretreated sample. it is relatively cheap, as much as 1/50 times cheaper than using antibodies alone. sensitivity in detection limits is 4 nM, and its design is simple without the need of delicate optimization. another norovirus RNA detecting biosensor has been developed using a beacon probe conjugated alloyed alloyed thioglycolic-capped. a label-free biosensor with photonic Fabry-Perot transducers based on relative optical power can detect human rotaviruses 105. its sensitivity can be optimised by selecting optimum specific wavelength or spectral band and selecting its relative optical power variation based on the biomolecule concentration. this biosensor has tested for its capability in the detection of the immobilization of rotavirus antigen and its antibodies. a novel resonance light scattering sensor is designed to detect hepatitis A viruses using a mussel-inspired polydopamine-coated virus imprinted polymer 108. the polymer is introduced on a surface of SiO2 nanoparticles by one-step. a simple fluorescent spectrophotometer is employed to detect the viruses with a detection limit of 8.6 pM. a label-free electrochemical immunosensor is designed to detect hepatitis B viruses using a glassy carbon electrode and a nanohybrid surface assembled. the anti-hepatitis B core antigen-antibody reaction is detected by the use of label or chemical mediators. the carbon nanotubes are used to enhance the hyaluronic acid to reach a limit of detection as 0.03 ng/mL. the bienzymatic detection is facilitated using the 1st enzyme tagged on magnetic beads on the gold electrode accumulated. the 2nd enzyme as immobilised layer by layer on the gold electrode. it has high selectivity to neglect other viruses such as H5N1 virus, Newcastle disease virus, Banna virus and Pseudorabies virus has a limit of detection as 1 ng/mL. biosensors available for foodborne virus detection include SPR. biosensors using antibody bioreceptors are one of the major categories of biosensors. nucleic acid bioreceptors are the third major category of biosensors based on the complementary property of nucleic acid base pairs 75. nucleic acid bioreceptors are more specific and sensitive compared to antibody-antigen bioreceptors, while the latter is faster and more robust. biomimetic bioreceptors are emerging as molecular imprinting tools attractive to and highly accepted for artificial recognition agents 79. peptides displayed by phages can be used to bind specific antibodies or viral antigens with strong recognition capacity for biosensor fabrication 77, 78. electrochemical transducer based biosensors are easy-to-use platforms with their unique properties. they are compatible with micro-fabricated technology and easily modifiable surface, making them particularly suitable for virus detection 86,87. SPR biosensors can be combined with hybridization, immunosensors, and aptamer techniques to enhance their applicability to virus detection 93-95. label-free biosensors are under development to target simplified and low-cost POC detection of foodborne viruses. two major features of electrochemical bioreceptors are modifiable probes or antibodies followed by target isolation, and amplified signal detection (Figure 6) 128. amplified signals can be either quantitative potentinmetric, amperometric, or impedimetric; and the signal can be either labeled or label-free. biosensors can be combined with hybridization, immunosensors, and aptamer techniques to enhance their applicability to virus detection 93-95. electrochemical biosensors have advantages over analytical transducing biosensors due to their high quantification, fast speed, and high sensitivities. label-free biosensors are under development to target simplified and low-cost POC detection of foodborne viruses. nanowire field-effect transistor biosensor can detect norovirus DNA single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) using HNA (HF+HNO3+CH3COOH) to define the nanowire and top-down fabrication 99. nano-tweezer, with a single signal-transducing molecule, can self-assemble from three single-stranded DNA molecules. biosensor can detect waterborne rotaviruses using surface functionalization with anti-rotavirus antibodies 103. sensitivity of detection limit is 99.8 nM for recombinant noroviral capsid proteins; and 7.8 copies/mL for human noroviruses. label-free device can capture five types of antigens from hepatitis viruses simultaneously. it uses a POC 2-electrode system to capture the virus antigens. it can detect both hepatitis A and C virus antigens at different concentrations without drying the cantilevers and without electrical connection. nanocrystals are placed on a glass electrode constructed from fluorine doped tin oxide. the nanotubes are incorporated to enhance electro-conductivity. detection results are compared to RT-PCR detection with 97% accuracy. the presence of thionine enhances the electrical conductivity between the gold film and the nanowire to facilitate linear detection with a detection limit of 3.3 fM. the development in biosensor techniques of hepatitis E viruses is relatively rare compared to other hepatitis viruses. antigen-antibody interaction is highly specific close to a lock-and-key fit with high affinity and low non-specificity. antigen-antibody interaction is highly specific close to a lock-and-key fit with high affinity and low non-specificity. antibodies can be either directly or indirectly labeled to generate detectable signals. direct label is preferred in most detections because it saves time and increases sensitivity compared to indirectly labeled antibodies. a magnetic near-field enforced illumination biosensor is developed to detect noroviruses in contaminated water using two different antibodies 122. one antibody is linked to polystyrene beads and the other is linked to magnetic beads to generate a sandwich when binding to viruses. this sensor allows the virus detection limit of 40 copies/100 L without a washing step in contaminated water. different chemical tags can be added to aptamers to increase flexibility without affecting affinity. different molecular weight enhances stability to sustain repetitious denaturation and renaturation.

their bindings are faster, higher specificity and affinity, and more stable. different chemical tags can be added to aptamers to increase flexibility without affecting affinity. their lower molecular weight enhances stability to sustain repetitious denaturation and renaturation. aptasensor combines AG3 and biosensor technique using gold nanoparticles can detect norovirus particles with a limit of detection as 180 copies/mL in contaminated lettuce samples. nitrocellulose membranes, agarose gels, and adsorptive microplates are used as supports to immobilise virus targets. aptamer M6-2 is selected and confirmed by ELISA targeting GI.7, GII.2, two GII.4 and GII.7 strains with low to moderate binding affinity. aptamer magnetic capture and RT-PCR are combined with selected aptamer to capture noroviruses with a detection limit of 4.88 log10 input genomic copies. the advantages of enzyme labeling are its specificity, stability, and the possibility of visual recognition. the disadvantages of enzyme labeling are the possibility of endogenous enzyme interference in samples and multiple assay steps. nanozymes can be categorised as metal oxide-based nanomaterials, cerium oxide-based nanomaterials, carbon-based nanomaterials, and metal-based nanomaterials. these nanomaterials are found to bear unexpectedly enzyme-like activities which are taken as advantages in nanozyme development with wide application in foodborne virus detection. vanadium pentoxide nanomaterials include gold nanomaterials, platinum nanomaterials, and bimetal nanomaterials. gold nanoparticles with either negative or positive surface charges show mimic activity of peroxidase, which can be tuned by adjusting the affinities between the substrates and nanozymes 146. carbon-based nanomaterials include graphene and derivatives, and fullerene and derivatives. chromatographic strip 152 detects the glycoprotein of the viruses with a limit of detection as 1ng/mL within 30 minutes. the detection limit can reach 5 pM with linear increases when the virus concentration was increased from 10 pM to 500 pM. current expectations of POC devices in foodborne virus monitoring are platforms with combination and hybridised functions. microfluidic devices and devices are mostly under intensive study and product development. microfluidic devices involve extremely small amounts of fluid, from tens to hundreds of microliters, passive or active fluid transport through capillary forces or pumping mechanisms, and microfabrication with shorter diffusional distances 31, 36. microfluidic devices are one of the most likely types in the future to meet all requirements of POC devices. cotton lignocellulose materials are the most featured and fabricated material in POC devices for pathogen detection 162. paper based devices are combined with lateral flow assays, dipstick assays, and microfluidic assays. paper is lightweight, biodegradable, self-powering, easily manufactured and affordable. smartphone-based wireless technology is a combination of computational processors, optical sensors, GPS receivers, wireless networks, and rechargeable batteries 166, 167. all of the components can be integrated into a multi-functional, pocket-size and portable device to create an ideal candidate in pathogen detection. the combination of smartphone technology and POC devices can meet the requirements in scientific measurement and commercial control of foodborne virus outbreak. the size of viruses ranges from 20 to 400 nm, while the size of bacteria ranges from 1 micron to 5 microns. the size of viruses ranges from 20 to 400 nm, while the size of bacteria ranges from 1 micron to 5 microns. the sensitivity of the virus detection devices must be at least attomolar or picomolar level. a universal viral extraction technique would be extremely difficult for rapid and real-time viral biosensing detection. iron electrocoagulation was found to be a superior technique in comparison to chemical coagulation pretreatment for virus removal from water and wastewater samples. a rapid real-time sensitive virus biosensing platform would significantly benefit from development of a reference detection method such as proposed in ISO/TS 15216. 179-181. major challenges for POC platform development in current foodborne virus detection include (1) POC platform facilitating multiplex testing; (2) enhancing signal-to-noise ratio to reduce background noises. other challenges include contamination issues in smartphone based devices before they can be used for foodborne pathogen detection; and data security and handling. the introduction of multi nanozymes in one nanostructure with different shapes may provide more surface to volume ratio to bind with substrate. we believe hetero structuring by metallic nanomaterials will garner more attention in the near future and will provide us with a new horizon in bioanalytical detection systems. thread lignocellulose materials possess fibrous and porous qualities ready to be made into devices for quantitative detection 160. sewing techniques are applied to thread based devices to weave, twist and encapsulate knots, tape and gel incorporated to provide microfluidic capacity. thread materials can also be combined with plasma oxidation or other materials such as cotton. paper based material enables different microfluidic paths for sequential fluid delivery without the need for peripheral equipment. the results are naked eye visible with a test time of 60 minutes and a detection limit of 9.5 x 104 copies/mL. the resulting paper based device can be used in one single step and is suitable for unskilled users. smartphone wireless technology is applied to our research laboratory in foodborne virus detection and the results will be published in the future. the research and commercialisation of POC devices for foodborne bacterial detection are far more advanced compared to those for foodborne virus detection. at-least 25 gram of solid food samples 171, 172. this requires that any virus detection devices be developed to meet the requirements of pathogen handling in either 100 mL of food liquid or 25 grams of solid food samples. a universal viral extraction technique would be extremely difficult for rapid and real-time viral biosensing detection. 177 found that ultracentrifugation yielded the highest recovery of noroviruses from lettuce and ham; while PEG precipitation recovered the best yield of virus from raspberries. there is currently no harmonization in the consensus towards selection of sample size or the number of samples to be analyzed from a suspected batch for viral detection. multi-functional nanohybrids could be applied to detect and separate different foodborne viruses simultaneously from complex biological matrices. the introduction of multi nanozymes in one nanostructure with different shapes may provide more surface to volume ratio to bind with substrate."}
