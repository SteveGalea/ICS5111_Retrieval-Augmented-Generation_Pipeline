{"summary": "UPS-mediated proteolysis involves two essential steps: ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. the 26S proteasome is a multi-unit protein proteolytic machine composed of a cylinder-shaped core particle (i.e., the 20S proteasome) the 19S serves to regulate protein degradation by the 20S proteasome. the COP9 signalosome (CSN) consists of 8 unique protein subunits (CSN1 through CSN8) in mammalian cells. it is an evolutionarily conserved multifunctional protein complex that is essential in plants and animals. csn8 deficiency was shown to cause UPS impairment in the heart. hepatocyte-specific Csn8 knockout (HS-Csn8KO) recapitulates the sequalea of chronic hepatic injury such as viral hepatitis. it appears that hepatocyte apoptosis can be induced via both the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways. the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl2 and tBid, can bind to and repress the multidomain pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak. in viable cells, the anti-apoptotic proteins can bind to and repress the multidomain pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak, and keep them in inactive monomers. littermate mice with a genotype of either Csn8flox /flox::Alb-Cre(+) or Csn8flox::Alb-Cre(-) were used in the present study as the HS-Csn8KO or the control (CTL) mice. gene generation and characterization of transgenic mice with ubiquitous overexpression of a surrogate UPS substrate GFPdgn were previously described. horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated anti-mouse, -rabbit, or -rat secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz) were used to probe bound primary antibodies. the proteins (400g) solubilized in RIPA lysis buffer were incubated. the label solution only (without terminal transferase) was used as negative control. at least 300 nuclei were counted from three different random fields in each liver. the label solution only (without terminal transferase) was used as negative control. mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and the tissue samples from the left and right lobes of livers were fixed in 3.5% glutaraldehyde in 100 mM cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3). at least 3 tissue samples from each lobe of the liver were chosen randomly for ultrastructural analysis. GFPdgn is an enhanced green fluorescence protein (GFP) modified by carboxyl fusion of degron CL1. the transgene was introduced into the HS-Csn8KO and CTL background via cross-breeding. the care and use of animals in this study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) horseradish peroxidase\u2013conjugated anti-mouse, -rabbit, or -rat secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz) were used to probe bound primary antibodies and detected using ECL advanced detection reagents. the densitometry of the western blots was performed with the Quantity-One software (Bio-Rad) fluorescence in cryosections was visualized using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M epi-fluorescence microscope. mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and the tissue samples from the left and right lobe of livers were fixed in 3.5% glutaraldehyde in 100 mM cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3). embedded tissue was picked up on nickel grids, dried and etched with a saturated solution of sodium m-periodate and 0.1N HCl. thin sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. the extra-long form of Bim (Bim-EL) protein is a known substrate of CIS [29], was significantly increased in HS-Csn8KO livers compared with the CTL (p0.01) by contrast, the protein level of HIF1 showed no discernible increase (p>0.05, Figure 1A) the abundance of HMW ubiquitin conjugates was also greater in HS-Csn8KO livers than in the CTL (p0.01, Figure 1D). the CSN holo-complex shares morphology and subunit domain structure similarities with the lid of the 19S proteasome. HS-Csn8KO resulted in the upregulation of three subunits of the 11S proteasome. AU denotes arbitrary unit. n=4 mice/group; #p0.05, *p0.01 vs. CTL; Student\u2019s t-test. a transgenic mouse model ubiquitously overexpresses GFPdgn. deficiency in liver leads to severe impairment of UPS-mediated proteolysis. however, the quantitative western blot analyses confirmed a dramatic decline in the protein level of subunit Rpt5. HR-Csn8KO impairs UPS proteolytic function in mouse livers. toluidine blue stain of semi-thin sections of resin-embedded liver tissue samples of 4-week-old mice revealed a large number of greenish granules or puncta in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes of HS-Csn8KO but not CTL livers. the nucleus of hepatocytes was markedly enlarged and lost its normal spherical shape. TEM feature of apoptosis was also observed in HS-Csn8KO livers. TEM feature of apoptosis was also observed in HS-Csn8KO hepatocytes. we characterized the time course of hepatocyte apoptosis in HS-Csn8KO mice during the first 6 weeks after birth. hepatocyte apoptosis was significantly increased at week 2, peaked at week 3, and remained at a significantly increased level at 4 and 6 weeks after birth in HS-Csn8KO mice. increased expression of the Bcl2 family members in HS-Csn8KO livers. the protein levels of BH3-only protein Bim-EL and Bim-L were significantly upregulated. the multi-domain pro-apoptotic protein Bax was also expressed at a higher level compared with that in the CTL group. Crude proteins extracts from liver tissues were used for immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by iimunoblotting (IB) analyses. for each protein, the density of the Csn8KO group is shown as the relative value to the average value of the corresponding CTL group. l2 family members performed reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments to determine whether Bim directly or indirectly activates Bax. first, we used the Bim antibody to pull down Bim proteins from HS-Csn8KO livers. the immunoprecipitated Bim-containing protein complexes were then probed with antibodies against Bcl2 but not Bcl-xL. significant increases in the mono-neddylated form of cullins have been reported in HS-Csn8KO livers. CSN-mediated cullin deneddylation is purported to prevent self-ubiquitination and destabilization of CRLs. CIS and VHL serve as the receptor protein for Bim-EL and HIF1. hepatic total ubiquitinated proteins were increased by >50% in HS-Csn8KO livers compared with the CTL (p0.01) total ubiquitinated proteins were increased by >50% in HS-Csn8KO livers compared with the CTL (p0.01) iency show no discernible effect on the protein levels of Rpn2, Rpn8 and Rpn10, three 19S lid subunits. HS-Csn8KO showed no discernible effect on the protein level of 20S subunit 5. all three subunits showed greater protein expression in HS-Csn8KO livers. transgenic mouse model ubiquitously overexpresses GFPdgn, a modified green fluorescence protein (GFP) with its carboxyl fusion of degron CL1. hepatic Csn8 deficiency in liver leads to severe impairment of UPS-mediated proteolysis in the liver. dgn tg and HS-Csn8KO mice were used at 4 weeks of age. a nonspecific band at a molecular weight of 80kDa is used as the loading control (LC) hepatocytes were enriched with mitochondria which were frequently associated with rough endoplasmic reticulum. electron-lucent vacuoles and autophagosomes were rare in hepatocytes of hepatocytes. TEM feature of apoptosis was also observed in HS-Csn8KO livers. TEM feature of apoptosis was also observed in HS-Csn8KO hepatocytes. hepatocyte apoptosis in HS-Csn8KO mice. hepatocyte permeability in HS-Csn8KO mice at 4 weeks of age. hepatocyte permeability in HS-Csn8KO mice showed no discernible increases. four pairs of HS-Csn8KO and CTL littermate mice at 4-week-old were used for analyses presented here. -Tubulin was probed as loading control (BD) BH3-only protein Bim activates Bax in HS-Csn8KO livers. bim antibodies were then probed with antibodies against Bcl2, Bcl-XL or Bax. no Bax was detected in the Bim-precipitated protein complex. bim-EL not Bax was co-immunoprecipitated with Bcl2. this confirms that Bim activates indirectly Bax via binding and engaging anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2. our results do not support a direct interaction between Bim and Bax. the conditional targeting of the csn8 gene in hepatocytes perturbs the UPS and leads to the impairment of UPS proteolytic function. our data further suggest that the UPS impairment is associated with increased hepatocyte apoptosis and the latter is likely activated via a Bim-mediated pro-apoptotic signaling pathway. the increased HMW Nedd8 conjugates are likely neddylated forms of non-cullin proteins because immunoblotting shows they are negative for cullin1 through cullin4 that we have examined. it will be interesting to identify the HMW neddylated proteins accumulated in HS-Csn8KO mouse livers. Activated caspase 3 can cleave Rpt5, Rpn2, and Rpn10 of the 19S proteasome during apoptosis. hepatocyte apoptosis was immediately increased upon the depletion of Csn8 protein in the HS-Csn8KO livers. no discernible decreases of Rpn2 and Rpn10 were evidenced in the same HS-Csn8KO livers where Rp the expression of all three 11S proteasome subunits was significantly increased in HS-Csn8KO livers. this is likely a compensatory response to proteasome functional impairment because upregulation of 11S proteasomes by PA28 overexpression has been demonstrated to enhance proteasome-mediated degradation of misfolded proteins. p21, p27, and wee1 can accumulate multiple CRL substrates. these factors may all contribute to apoptosis induced by NAE inhibition. in healthy cells, Bim is sequestered to the microtubules by binding to LC8. the interaction and functional balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family proteins in a cell determine the fate of the cell. two competing theories for the mechanism by which the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins promote the activation of Bax. one proposes that Bim binds to Bax and thereby activates Bax directly. Csn8KO livers significant decreases in CIS and VHL, two SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling)-box-containing substrate receptors of CRLs. the CIS down-regulation was accompanied by increases of its substrate Bim-EL but decreased VHL was not associated with an increase of HIF1, a known substrate of VHL. defects in the CSN impair CRLs and thereby lead to an appreciable decrease in global ubiquitination. this suggests that the removal of ubiquitinated proteins by the 26S proteasome is likely also impaired by Csn8 deficiency. the mechanism for Rpt5 down-regulation is unclear. 10 were evidenced in the same HS-Csn8KO livers where Rpt5 decreases were observed. the depletion of this key component of the19S proteasome is at least in part responsible for the impaired proteasomal function in ischemic myocardium. this is likely a compensatory response to proteasome functional impairment because upregulation of 11S proteasomes by PA28 overexpression has been demonstrated. blocking cullin deneddylation by HS-Csn8KO can effectively induce cell death in cancer cells. blocking cullin deneddylation by MLN4924 can also cause massive apoptosis in the liver. a common mediating mechanism for the two opposing approaches to cause apoptosis is likely in the inhibition of CRLs. bimEL and BimL expression are tightly regulated at both the transcriptional and posttranslational levels. Upon death stimulation, Bim is released from the microtubules. both the pro-apoptotic members (Bim, Bax) and the anti-apoptotic members (Bcl2 and Bcl-XL) of the Bcl2 family were significantly increased. increased BimEL and Bcl2 existed in the same complex, while increased Bim did not interact with Bax. increased Bcl2 did not appear to interact with increased Bax in HS-Csn8KO."}
