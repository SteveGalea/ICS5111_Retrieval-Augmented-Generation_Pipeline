{"summary": "the only current therapeutic option is maintenance of a strict life-long gluten-free diet. different treatment regimes might be feasible, including masking of toxic celiac peptides with blocking antibodies. scFv detects common and khorasan wheat comparably with binding affinities in the high nanomolar range. rye is detected to a lesser extent. barley and cereals which are part of the gluten-free diet are not detected by scFv."}
