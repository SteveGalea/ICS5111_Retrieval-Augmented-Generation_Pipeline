{"summary": "expression of TMEM2 in liver tissues and HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells IHC showed strong expression of TMEM2 in the cytoplasm in normal liver tissue. the western blot analysis also showed a significant reduction of TMEM2 expression in liver tissues from patients with chronic HBV infection. the mRNA level of TMEM2 in liver tissues from patients with chronic HBV infection was significantly lower than that in normal liver tissues and HepG2 cells without HBV genomic DNA RT-qPCR results showed reduced TMEM2 mRNA levels in the liver tissues from a patient with chronic HBV infection compared with that in normal liver tissues (healthy livers versus HBV livers: *P0.05). successful establishment of stable TMEM2-overexpressing or silenced cell lines Lentiviral vectors were used to establish stable TMEM2-overexpressing or silenced cells. Western blot results showed reduced expression of TMEM2 in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells. RT-qPCR results showed reduced levels of TMEM2 mRNA in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells. TMEM2 silencing or overexpression slightly promoted proliferation of HepG2 cells. the levels of HBsAg and HBcAg in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells were higher than those in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells. the levels of HBsAg and HBcAg in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells were lower than those in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells. after HBV infection, HBV cccDNA levels were increased in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells compared with HepG2 shTMEM2 cells. after HBV infection, HBV cccDNA levels were increased in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells compared with HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells. the levels of p-Tyk2, p-JAK1, p-STAT1 and p-STAT2 in all HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells were reduced by HBV infection. the levels of p-Tyk2, p-JAK1, p-STAT1 and p-STAT2 in all HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells were lower than those in HepG2 cells. levels of p-Tyk2, p-JAK1, p-STAT1 and p-STAT2 in HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells were higher than those in HepG2.2.15 cells following HBV infection. after TMEM2 overexpression or knockdown, there were no significant differences in the cellular level of total interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells. p-JAK1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 were significantly elevated in HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells compared with HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells. no significant changes in cellular levels were observed by HBV infection in any groups based on western blot analysis. the expression of OAS1 in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells was significantly lower than that in HepG2 cells. the expression of OAS1 in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells was significantly higher than that in HepG2 cells. TMEM2 overexpression increased the translocation of IRF9 into nuclei. e activity was observed in shTMEM2 cells. the level of IRF9 in the nuclei of non-HBV-infected HepG2 TMEM2 cells did not change significantly in response to HBV infection compared with that in non-HBV-infected HepG2 TMEM2 cells. IFN promoted the inhibitory effects of TMEM2 on HBV infection. western blot and RT-qPCR analyses showed that levels of p-JAK1 and p-STAT1 were significantly increased in HepG2 and HepG2 shTMEM2 cells. expression of MxA and OAS1 in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells was significantly lower than that in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells.

TMEM2 is a type II transmembrane protein. the levels of HBsAg, HBcAg, HBV DNA, and HBV cccDNA in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells, in which the expression of TMEM2 was silenced, were significantly lower than those in HepG2 cells. these results suggest that TMEM2 inhibited HBV infection in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells. TMEM2 regulates the JAK\u2013STAT signaling pathway. we observed that IFN treatment increased the expression of MxA and OAS1 in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells. this effect was compromised by reduced TMEM2 expression, leading to attenuated inhibitory effects of IFN on HBV production. TMEM2 activates the JAK\u2013STAT signaling pathway and regulates levels of p-Tyk2, p-JAK1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells. IFN can also activate the JAK\u2013STAT signaling pathway and upregulate TMEM2 expression, leading to enhanced inhibitory effects of IFN on HBV production. the interaction between the HBV preS1 domain and NTCP mediates the entry of HBV into cells. we identified five cases of the p.Ser267Phe homozygous mutation among 1899 patients with chronic HBV infection. the role of TMEM2 in HBV infection should be investigated in future investigations. expression of TMEM2 in liver tissues and HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells based on IHC. RT-qPCR results showed reduced expression of TMEM2 in the liver tissues from a patient with chronic HBV infection compared with that in normal liver tissues. Western blot and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) results showed significantly increased expression of TMEM2 in HepG2 TMEM2 and HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells compared with HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells (P0.01). overexpression of TMEM2 promoted a slight increase in the proliferation of HepG2 and HepG2.2.15. RT-qPCR results showed reduced levels of TMEM2 mRNA in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells (GFP versus HepG2215 TMEM2: **P0.01) and increased mRNA levels of TMEM2 in HepG2 TMEM2 and HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells (GFP versus HepG2215 TMEM2: **P0.01). the levels of HBsAg and HBcAg were lower in HepG2 TMEM2 cells. the levels of HBsAg and HBcAg were lower in HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells. after HBV infection, the level of HBV DNA in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells was significantly increased. after HBV infection, HBV cccDNA levels were significantly increased in HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells compared with HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells. RT-qPCR results showed that the level of HBV DNA in all cells (HepG2, HepG2 shTMEM2, HepG2 TMEM2 and Hep2.2.15) was significantly increased in response to HBV infection. western blot was used to evaluate the expression of key components of the JAK\u2013STAT signaling pathway in HBV-infected HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells. the levels of p-Tyk2, p-JAK1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 in all HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells were reduced by HBV infection. levels of p-Tyk2, p-JAK1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 were significantly reduced after HBV infection. levels of p-Tyk2, p-JAK1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 were significantly reduced in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells than compared with HepG2 GFP cells. 0.05 compared with HepG2 TMEM2 cells without HBV infection. $P0.05 compared with HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells without HBV infection. expression of OAS1 in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells was significantly lower than that in HepG2 cells. TMEM2 increased the translocation of IRF9 into nuclei in both HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells. TMEM2 overexpression enhanced IRF9 translocation into nuclei. TMEM2 overexpressing HepG2 TMEM2 cells reduced the level of IRF9 in the nuclei in HepG2 TMEM2 cells. similar results were observed in TMEM2-overexpressing TMEM2 cells. RT-qPCR results showed that IFN pre-treatment significantly increased the expression of MxA and OAS1 in HepG2 and HepG2 shTMEM2 cells. however, the levels of MxA and OAS1 in HepG2 shTMEM2 cells were significantly lower than those in HepG2 cells. IFN pre-treatment significantly reduced the mRNA levels of HBV DNA and HBV cccDNA in HepG2 GFP and HepG2 shTMEM2 cells infected with HBV. expression of a number of key components of the JAK\u2013STAT signaling pathway, levels of HBsAg and HBcAg, and levels of HBV DNA and HBV cccDNA were evaluated. HBcAg in HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells were increased by pre-treatment with JAK1 inhibitor after HBV infection. the RT-qPCR results showed that JAK1 inhibitor significantly increased the levels of HBV DNA and HBV cccDNA in HepG2.2.15 and HepG2.2.15 TMEM2 cells. TMEM2 is a type II transmembrane protein. the biological function of TMEM2 is not yet fully understood. TMEM2 is involved in cardiac development in zebrafish. TMEM2 overexpression activated the JAK\u2013STAT signaling pathway. TMEM2 knockdown decreased levels of p-Tyk2, p-JAK1, p-STAT1 and p-STAT2 in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells. this suggests that TMEM2 regulates the JAK\u2013STAT signaling pathway. TMEM2 increased levels of HBsAg, HBcAg, HBV DNA, and HBV cccDNA in TMEM2-overexpressing HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells. TMEM2 increased the translocation of IRF9 into nuclei, but no effect on IRF9 expression was detected. TMEM2 inhibits HBV infection in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 by activating the JAK\u2013STAT signaling pathway. bioinformatics analyses have shown that TMEM2 contains a short intracellular region and a long extracellular region that includes the G8 and GG domains. a number of proteins including PKHD1 and KIAA1109 are involved in certain human diseases. TMEM2 is useful to understand the mechanism of HBV infection. it is not clear whether TMEM2 is a HBV receptor involved in HBV infection through the G8 and GG domains. the role of TMEM2 in HBV infection should be investigated in vivo. stable TMEM2-overexpressing or silenced cell lines Establishment of stable cDNA was performed according to a previous study with slight modifications. to obtain lentiviral expression of TMEM2, TMEM2 cDNA with an in-frame stop codon was amplified by PCR and inserted into vector LV-003 with the CMV promoter. immunohistochemistry was performed using formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded healthy and CHB liver tissue sections or fixed cultured cells. cells were incubated with the primary antibodies (TMEM2 antibody 1:100, Aviva Systems Biology, San Diego, CA, USA; anti-HBs 1:50, anti-HBc 1:50, BOSTER, Wuhan, China) at 4 \u00b0C overnight.
