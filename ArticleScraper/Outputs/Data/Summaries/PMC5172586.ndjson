{"summary": "the viral genome is first recognized by specific receptors including toll-like receptor 3/7 (TLR-3/7) and cytosolic receptors. the viral genome is a single-strand positive-sense RNA containing 10 open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1a, OR. PRRSV infection causes type IFN induction in alveolar macrophages. nsp11 is the only one harboring RNA nuclease activity. nsp11 is produced from a large polyprotein, translated directly from the viral genome, PP1ab. nsp11-induced IFN- suppression is mediated by the inhibition of retinoic acid-inducible gene-1-like receptor (RLR)-mediated pathways. nsp11-induced IFN- suppression is mediated by the inhibition of retinoic acid-inducible gene-1-like receptor (RLR)-mediated pathways. nsp11 contains an IFN promoter suppressive activity but its molecular action is unknown. pIFN--luc, pIRF3-luc, or pPRDII-luc reporter plasmids were transfected with nsp11. pIFN--luc and pPRDII-luc contain 4 copies of the IRF3 binding sequence. nsp11-transfected cells were serially diluted by 2-folds. each diluted supernatant was then incubated with MARC-145 cells. poly(I:C) transfection at 0.5 g per well stimulated the secretion of IFN to culture supernatants. illa plasmid served as an internal control to normalize the experimental variability. cell lysates were prepared and the firefly luciferase activity was first determined. renilla luciferase activity was then measured by a ratio of a/b. IRF3 resides in the cytoplasm in an inactive form. but upon stimulation, it undergoes phosphorylation, dimerization, and subsequent translocation to the nucleus. nsp11 expression was detected only in nsp11-expressing cells. DS-PAGE, and Western blot were conducted using -IRF3 PAb, -Flag MAb, -PARP PAb, -HSP90 MAb, and --action MAb. flag antibody was used to detect nsp11 expression. cells were lysed at 40 h post-transfection and assayed for luciferase activities. each set of samples were compared to the value of RIG-I or MAVS alone transfection. overexpression of nsp11 suppressed NF-B promoter activity, suggesting nsp11 may target the NF-B pathway as well. nsp11 overexpression inhibits both IRF3 and NF-B activations. nsp11 inhibits the RLR-mediated signaling and antagonizes IFN expression. nsp11 inhibits the RLR-mediated signaling. MARC-145 cells were co-transfected with nsp11 and nsp11. total RNA and cellular lysates were individually prepared for RT-PCR and Western blot. both endogenous and exogenous MAVS mRNAs were significantly reduced in these cells. MARC-145 cells were infected with PRRSV or VSV-GFP at an M.O.I. of 0.1. infected cells and supernatants were harvested at indicated times post-infection. all gene copy numbers were relative to the housing keeping gene GAPDH. for protein, cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot. reduction of MAVS expression by nsp11 was validated in virus-infected cells. mRNA was reduced in both nsp11-gene transfected cells and PRRSV-infected cells. reduction of MAVS mRNA led to less protein expression, subsequently interfering with RLR signaling. nsp11 does not target the host transcriptome globally. mutations of H2963A and H2978A or single mutation of H3007A in EAV nsp11 subdomain A reduced the cleavage of RNA to undetectable levels. these findings were confirmed for the SARS-CoV nsp15 protein [30, 41]. nsp11 and D180 and D204 in nsp11 crystal structure, were regarded to impair the secondary structure. so equivalent mutations of S3754A and S3802A were introduced to PRRSV nsp11 to use as negative controls. nsp11 spans between G3607 and E3829. nsp11 is known to have cytotoxicity in some of the cell lines. it would be possible that the observation of IFN suppression could be the result of \u201cdying cells\u201d due to the cytotoxicity by ectopically over-expressing nsp11. nsp11 WT and mutant plasmids exhibited minimal and similar proportion of dead cells in the MARC-145 cell line. mutants with impaired EndoU activity showed normal levels of MAVS expression compared to empty vector control. nsp11-K3779A was chosen as a representative mutant from the group that specifically lost the EndoU activity. nsp11-K3779A was chosen as a representative mutant from the group that specifically lost the EndoU activity. cells were co-transfected with pFlag-MAVS and nsp11-WT. at 24 h post-transfection, cells were lysed and subjected to Western blot. at 24 h post-transfection, total RNA was extracted and endogenous MAVS mRNA was quantified via qPCR. nsp11-WT, nsp11-S3754A, and nsp11-S3802A showed stronger suppression. nsp11-H3735A and nsp11-H3750A showed a relatively minor suppression. the mutants whose endoribonuclease activity was lost also showed the loss of IFN suppressive activity. nsp11-K3779A mutant did not block the IB phosphorylation. this finding was consistent with the data obtained using phospho-IB PAb. nsp11 antagonizes IFN- expression via the endoU-mediated reduction of MAVS expression level. cells were transfected with full-length mutant genomic RNAs transcribed off their respective genomic clones. two mutant genomes FL12-nsp11-D3786A and FL12-nsp11-D3810A did not express the nsp2/3 and N proteins even after 72 h post-transfection. nsp11-H3750A, and FL12-nsp11-K3779A expressed the nsp2/3 and N proteins at comparable levels to those of wild-type PRRSV. at 16 h post-transfection, cells were co-stained with anti-nsp2/3 PAb and anti-N MAb. the viral genomic RNA replication was determined using nsp11-specific primers for a 669 bp fragment. the sub-genomic (sg) mRNA7 transcription was determined using a forward primer within the 5\u2019-UTR of the genomic RNA and a reverse primer for ORF7. FL12-nsp11-D3786A and FL12-nsp11-D3810A did not synthesize the genomic RNA and sg iters of these viruses were determined as 5.6x102, 5.6x10, and 3.2x102 TCID50/ml respectively. no CPE was developed even at 6 days post-infection. no N-protein staining was detected for cells inoculated with \u2018passage 1\u2019 virus. wild-type clone FL12-nsp11-WT, were RT-PCR positive for both genomic RNA and sg mRNA7. results demonstrate that the nsp11 EndoU activity was essential for virus infectivity. no progeny virus was produced when it was destroyed. nonviable aMARC-145 cells were transfected with genomic RNA transcripts. the progeny virus in the supernatants was designated as \u2018passage 1\u2019 (P1) bImmunofluorescence assay (IFA) was conducted at 16 h post-transfection for P1. pIRF3-luc and pPRDII-luc contain 4 copies of the IRF3 binding sequence or 2 copies of the NF-B binding sequence located in the IFN- promoter. nsp11-expressing cells exhibited strong suppression of IFN-, IRF3 and NF-B activities. level of fluorescence was seen at 1:64 dilution of culture supernatant. in contrast, GFP expression was readily observed in cells expressing nsp11 at 1:16 dilution even after poly(I:C) stimulation. results show that nsp11 has the ability to suppress the IFN- production pathway. the basal level in MARC-145 cells was considered to be the ratio in samples transfected with the vector control. each sample from nsp11-transfected cells was compared to poly(I:C) stimulation. the nsp11-gene was transfected into HeLa cells for 24 h to allow its expression. poly(I:C) transfection caused IRF3 nuclear translocation as anticipated. in nsp11-expressing cells, IRF3 was not detected in the nucleus. phosphorylation state was examined. cells were transfected with empty vector, nsp11, or K3779A, followed by stimulation with poly(I:C) (0.5 g/ml) for 6 h. lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot. nsp11 blocks localization of p65 in the presence of transfected nsp11. p65 subunit was normally translocated to the nucleus in control cells. phosphorylated IB was detected at 5 min of stimulation and degraded shortly after. strong IFN- promoter activity was observed when cells were co-transfected with pIFN--Luc and pcDNA3-RIG-I. in nsp11-overexpressing cells, the luciferase activity was increased up to 80 folds. in cells overexpressing MAVS by transfection with pFlag-MAVS plasmids, this activity was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner. nsp11 was detected using Flag Abs in nsp11-expressing cells. both endogenous and exogenous MAVS mRNAs were significantly reduced. nsp11 impaired the MAVS function by dampening its mRNA. cell lysates were prepared in parallel and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot. cells were stained with mouse -MAVS PAb, rabbit -nsp11 PAb, -PRRSV swine serum and --actin MAb. the reduction of MAVS expression by nsp11 was validated in virus-infected cells. in VSV-infected cells, the amount of MAVS mRNA was increased. nsp11 and MAVS proteins were found to localize in the perinuclear region. mRNA/protein of MAVS, RIG-I, p65, and IRF3 were examined by qRT-PC/western blot. p65 mRNA and IRF3 mRNA remained relatively unchanged. nsp11 does not target the host transcriptome globally. mutant nsp11 proteins were found to be critical for genomic and subgenomic viral RNA synthesis. mutations in nsp11 subdomain B were shown to be critical for both genomic and subgenomic viral RNA synthesis. these findings were confirmed for the SARS-CoV nsp15 protein [30, 41] nsp11 spans between G3607 and E3829, and the EndoU domain lies from L3733 to F3811 forming the conserved 79 residue core. subdomain A is specific for nidoviruses and includes two conserved Asp residues at 3786 and 3810. cells were co-transfected with flagged MAVS and individual nsp11 mutants. anti-Flag antibody would only detect exogenous MAVS. nsp11-S3754A and nsp11-S3802A were not supposed to affect the EndoU activity. the MAVS signal was weak (blue arrows) in nsp11-WT expressing cells. it was strong (white arrows) in cells expressing nsp11-K3779A. this is because in virus-infected cells, nsp11 interacts with other viral proteins. nsp11 cells were transfected with vector or individual mutant nsp11 plasmids. at 24 h post-transfection, total RNA was extracted and endogenous MAVS mRNA was quantified via qPCR. each sample expressing nsp11 or mutants was compared with empty vector-transfected sample. IFN bioassays were conducted for individual mutants to confirm the results of the reporter assays. we further examined the activation of IRF3 and NF-B using nsp11-K3779A as a representative mutant. nsp11-K3779A mutant did not block the IB phosphorylation. these results further support our findings that nsp11 antagonizes IFN- expression via the EndoU-mediated reduction of MAVS expression level. endoU-deficieny was not lethal for EAV but endoU-deficient viruses were replication-compromised. a stop-codon insertion mutant (Ins-mut) was additionally constructed to destroy the nsp11 gene. two mutant genomes FL12-nsp11-D3786A and FL12-nsp11-D3810A did not express the nsp2/3 and N proteins in transfected-cells even after 72 MARC-145 cells were transfected with individual full-length viral genomic RNAs in vitro-synthesized from corresponding infectious cDNA clones using T7 RNA polymerase. at 16 h post-transfection, cells were co-stained with anti-nsp2/3 PAb and anti-N MAb (SDOW17) to examine the genome replication and sub-genomic (sg) mRNA7 transcription. FL12-nsp11-D3786A, FL12-nsp11-H3750A, FL12-nsp11-S3754A, and FL12-nsp11-K3779A produced similar levels of PRRSV genomic RNA. however, three mutants FL12-nsp11-H3735A, FL12-nsp11-H3750A, and FL12-nsp11-K3779A produced much less amounts of cells inoculated with 'passage 1' virus showed a specific signal at 6 days post-inoculation. no N-protein staining was detected for FL12-nsp11-H3735A, FL12-nsp11-H3750A, FL12-nsp11-K3779A, pFL12-nsp11-D3786A, and FL12-nsp11-D3810A. sp11 mutation (wt mutated sequence) Passage 1 (P1)a Passage 2 (P2)a Viabilitye nsp2/3 IFAb N IFAb Log titrec (16hr) Log titrec (24hr) N IFAd RT-PCRd FL-12 WT none +++ +++ 2 2.75 +++ + wild type Defective One nt insertion (CAT) - - - - nonviable Subdomain A H3735 bImmunofluorescence assay (IFA) was conducted at 16 h post-transfection for P1. cVirus titers were determined by end-point dilution on MARC-145 cells at 6 days post-infection. eNonviable indicates no detectable signal in P2 cells. mRNAs of both RIG-I and MAVS were reduced by nsp11. the nsp11 signaling failed to activate IRF3 and NF-B. mRNAs of both RIG-I and MAVS were reduced by nsp11. nsp11 is not the only viral protein in PRRSV targeting MAVS and RIG-I. nsp4 cleaves MAVS protein into small products and thus leads to the abolishment of IFN production. RF3 and IB were reduced, ruling out non-specific degradation of RNA. both mRNA and p65 mRNA were not affected by nsp11. nsp11 was restricted to perinuclear region, whereas in nsp11-transfected cells nsp11 was widely expressed throughout the cytoplasm. asp mutant clones FL12-nsp11-D3786A and FL12-nsp11-D3810A were totally negative for the N and nsp2/3 proteins in genomic RNA-transfected cells. the data from the mutant genomic clones were partially consistent with EAV nsp11 mutant viruses and SARS-CoV nsp15 mutant viruses. the nsp11 coding sequence was amplified by PCR using the FL12 infectious clone and specific primers listed in Table 1. the nsp11 gene which fused with the N-terminal Flag tag was digested with the Bam HI and Xho I. pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) for renilla-luciferase expression under control of thymidine kinase promoter was used to normalize transfection efficiencies. anti-actin MAb, anti-Flag MAb M2, anti-human heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) MAb, and anti-human poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase protein (PARP) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies Inc anti-PRRSV-nsp11 polyclonal antibody was generated at the Immunological Research Center (University of Illinois, Urbana, IL) a total of 2 mg of proteins was immunized to a rabbit. supernatants were measured using the Dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) in a luminometer (Wallac 1420 VICTOR multi-label counter, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) for stimulation by RIG-I, MAVS, or IRF3-GFP, 0.5 g of the constitutively active form of pcDNA3-RIG-I, pcDNA-MAVS, or pGFP-N1 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature (R/T) for 15 min, followed by permeabilization for 10 min using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS at RT. cells were incubated with goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with Texas red (1:500) or goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with Alexa green (1:800) for 1 h. insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 4\u00b0C for 10 min at 12,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. cell lysates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) membranes were incubated with the primary antibody in TBS-T containing 5% skim milk or 5% BSA at 4\u00b0C overnight. the nuclear pellet was centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 10 min in a microcentifuge. and the supernatants were kept as the cytoplasmic fraction. the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE.
