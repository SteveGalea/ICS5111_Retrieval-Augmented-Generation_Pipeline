{"summary": "polyomaviruses are small, non-enveloped icosahedral viruses. they have been found in many different avian and mammalian hosts. in humans, polyomavirus seroprevalence can reach up to 90 %. all polyomaviruses produce at least two early mRNA products encoding large and small tumour antigens (LT-Ag and St-Ag, respectively) these proteins are involved in viral genome replication and modulation of host cell conditions required for virus replication. cross-species zoonotic transmission is a frequent cause of emerging epidemics in humans (e.g. influenza A viruses, Lassa virus, Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) little is known about evolutionary history of polyomaviruses. the polyomavirus phylogeny is proposed to result from recombination amongst polyomaviruses. a recent study found support for recombination of several polyomaviruses. but was unable to identify ancestors of the putative recombinant lineages with certainty. the 1997 supernatant was enriched using a sucrose cushion. DNA was extracted from the sucrose-cushion-purified supernatant. two polyomavirus contigs of 4495 and 468 nt were identified. the mink cell line was tested for the presence of the polyomavirus. the polyomavirus was not a contaminant in the mink cell line used to culture the badger herpesvirus isolate. eight badgers showed evidence of polyomavirus. PCR results were positive at least once in all sample types, except faecal samples which were all negative. 21 of 87 (24 %) samples were positive for MmelPyV1. samples from liver and lymph nodes showed the highest rate of positivity. in 4791 bp of coding sequence suggests that the French and UK isolates diverged within the past few hundred years. this estimate should be considered tentative as it is based on an evolutionary rate for the BK polyomavirus. the genome organization of MmelPyV1 was typical of the family polyomaviridae. the LT-Ag sequence shares many features with other polyomaviruses. the sequence shares many features with other polyomaviruses. other motifs identified in SV40 appear to be absent. one GAGGC at nt 275\u2013279 and two reverse complement GCCTC at nt 77\u201381 and 84\u201388 showed no evidence of tandem repeats or palindromes in the NCCR. a 53 aa ORF was identified overprinting the LT-Ag exon 2 in a frameshift position, in a similar genome position to the previously proposed ALTO gene. phylogenetic analysis of the family polyomaviridae. we constructed maximum-likelihood trees based on alignment of 63 whole-genome polyomavirus sequences. a maximum-likelihood phylogeny of polyomavirus genomes was supported by bootstrap support. phylogenies estimated from overlapping 600 bp partitions of genome-wide alignment show that the WU, KI, HPyV6 and HPyV7 polyomaviruses are not consistently placed together when different subgenomic regions are analysed. phylogenies estimated from overlapping 600 bp partitions of the genome-wide alignment show that the WU, KI, HPyV6 and HPyV7 polyomaviruses, which form a scale bar represents expected number of substitutions per site. the putative breakpoints in the circular genomes of WU, KI, HPyV6 and HPyV7 were identified as occurring in the NCCR and towards the 3\u2032 end of the LT-Ag exon 2 (breakpoints marked on Fig. 2 with black stars) Host species were assigned to categories in three different ways. each case there was a significant correlation between host taxonomic category and viral phylogeny. thus, polyomaviruses from related hosts are grouped together in the viral phylogenetic tree more often than expected by chance. DNA was extracted from the sucrose-cushion-purified supernatant. two polyomavirus contigs of 4495 and 468 nt were identified. overlapping identical sequences of 110 nt were found at both ends. herpesvirus isolate, the mink cell line was tested for the presence of the virus. no bands were present in the negative control mock-infected mink cell line sample. samples from liver and lymph nodes showed the highest rate of positivity. Neither VP1 nor the NCCR showed any sequence variability across the wild badger samples. the divergence time of the UK and French isolates was estimated. the genome is a 5186 or 5187 bp circular molecule with a G+C content of 42.8 %. these values fall within the range for known mammalian polyomaviruses. the genome organization of MmelPyV1 was typical of the family polyomaviridae. the LT-Ag has motifs similar to other polyomaviruses. the NCCR contained three likely LT-Ag binding sites. a 53 aa ORF was identified overprinting the LT-Ag exon 2 in a frameshift position, in a similar genome position to the previously proposed ALTO gene. however, MmelPyV1 is phylogenetically distinct from the clade of ALTO-containing polyomaviruses. this ORF is considerably shorter than identified ALTO proteins. maximum-likelihood phylogeny of polyomavirus genomes based on alignment of 63 whole-genome polyomavirus sequences. in maximum-likelihood phylogeny of polyomavirus genomes, MmelPyV1 clustered with CSLPyV1 (Wellehan et al., 2011) the division into these two clades is not preserved when different parts of the genome are considered separately. phylogenies estimated from overlapping 600 bp partitions of the genome-wide alignment show that the WU, KI, HPyV6 and HPyV7 polyomaviruses are not consistently placed together when different subgenomic regions are analysed. such phylogenetic incongruence may indicate that these taxa have recombined in their evolutionary history. breakpoints in the circular genomes of WU, KI, HPyV6 and HPyV7 were identified as occurring in the NCCR and towards the 3\u2032 end of the LT-Ag exon 2 (breakpoints marked on Fig. 2 with black stars) these breakpoint positions were used to define two partitions of the genome-wide alignment: (i) partition A, comprising the late region (1000 nt) plus a short region of the LT-Ag exon 2 ( polyomaviruses from related hosts are grouped together in the viral phylogenetic tree more often than expected by chance. a metagenomic analysis of ferret faeces detected DNA fragments with sequence similarity to polyomaviruses in two ferrets. the closest relative of MmelPyV1 is CSLPyV1 (Wellehan et al., 2011) of all known polyomavirus hosts, the sea lion is the most closely related to the European badger. previous analyses have ruled out strict viral-host co-divergence during polyomavirus evolution. the polyomavirus NCCR is the most variable genome region, both within and across virus species. the recent divergence of the French and UK isolates is supported by a deficit of genetic differences in the NCCR. a previous metagenomic analysis of badger faeces did not identify polyomavirus. the known diversity of the polyomaviridae has increased substantially due to increased virus discovery efforts. the true host range and genomic diversity of mammalian polyomaviruses are unknown. melPyV1 was first discovered in a cell culture supernatant in 1996. it was derived from the apical lobe of a badger lung in Cornwall, England. the clarified supernatant of this cell culture had been stored at 80 \u00b0C since 1997. a new supernatant (henceforth called \u2018MusHV1\u2019) was produced by centrifugation. cells from the mink cell line NBL-7 were cultured in minimum essential medium. cells were either infected with MusHV1 or mock infected. a template of 250 ng organ or whole-blood DNA, or 5 l DNA extracted from faeces, was added to the PCR master mix. all PCR products of expected sizes were purified and sequenced using a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit. sequences were called using Sequencing Analysis version 5.4 (Applied Biosystems) software and the resulting files analysed using Geneious version 7.1.4 (Geneious) one of the amplicons positive for both the NCCR and VP1 (salivary gland of badger 6) was chosen for genome amplification. to validate the genome, independent overlapping PCRs were completed. regions where the alignment was highly uncertain (including non-coding regions) were removed. 'genome-wide' alignment of 3534 bp covered 70 % of the MmelPyV1 polyomavirus genome length. third codon positions were found to be significantly saturated using the test of Xia et al. (2003). t & Huelsenbeck, 2003) was used to generate a posterior sample of trees from the genome-wide alignment using a Markov chain Monte Carlo of 3106 steps. the first 25 % of trees were discarded as \u2018burn-in\u2019. recombination breakpoints were generated based on the minimum-cost solutions. putative recombination breakpoints were used to define new genomic partitions. maximum-likelihood phylogenies were again estimated from each partition. this method provides robust amplification of all sample DNA in preparation for deep sequencing. it also works particularly well at amplifying small circular templates such as the polyomavirus through rolling circle replication. DNA was extracted using a Qiagen DNA Blood and Tissue kit. lysates were passed through a QiaShredder column to reduce viscosity. DNA was amplified using invitrogen Accuprime Taq and primers. diagnostic PCRs targeting VP1 and the NCCR were performed in eight sample types from 11 different badgers. a template of 250 ng organ or whole-blood DNA was added to the PCR master mix (primers listed in Table S4) all PCR products of expected sizes were purified and sequenced using a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencer (Applied Biosystems) 63 whole-genome polyomavirus sequences were obtained from GenBank. they included reference sequences from all known mammalian polyomavirus species. only the UK isolate was included in the phylogenetic study. the best-fit model was a general time reversible (GTR) model of nucleotide substitution. gamma ()-distributed among-site rate heterogeneity and a category of invariant sites. phylogenetic trees were estimated using maximum-likelihood. each partition was 600 nt long with a neighbouring partition overlap of 200 nt. phylogenetic trees were estimated from each partition using maximum-likelihood approach detailed above. one species was chosen randomly from every monophyletic clade present in all 12 partition phylogenies. the date of divergence of the UK and French MmelPyV1 isolates was estimated using previous estimates of polyomavirus substitution rates (Firth et al., 2010). the date of divergence of the UK and French MmelPyV1 isolates was estimated using previous estimates of polyomavirus substitution rates. resulting contigs were processed using slim, an iterative blast algorithm. the 1997 supernatant from which the MmelPyV UK isolate was discovered was recultured to increase virus stock using mink cell line NBL-7. cells from the mink cell line were either infected with MusHV1 or mock infected. between march and may 2013, 11 badgers were captured in the Chavigny commune, France, as part of a study into a vaccine for mycobacterium bovis. after capture, badgers were maintained together in open-air pens. legal approval was given by ANSES/ENVA/UPEC. all PCR products of expected sizes were purified and sequenced using a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) bases were called using Sequencing Analysis version 5.4 (Applied Biosystems) software. one of the DNA samples positive for both the NCCR and VP1 was chosen for genome amplification. nucleotide sequences were aligned using Muscle version 3.8.31 with default parameters (Edgar, 2004), which generated a poor-quality alignment that required manual editing using Se-Al. regions where the alignment was highly uncertain (including non-coding regions) were removed, resulting in a \u2018genome-wide\u2019 alignment of 3534 bp. one thousand maximum-likelihood bootstrap replicates were performed. support for each node annotated onto the maximum-likelihood tree. first 25 % of trees were discarded as 'burn-in' these 26 taxa were analysed using Recco (Maydt & Lengauer, 2006) to seek evidence of recombination. recombination and mutation have a cost penalty."}
