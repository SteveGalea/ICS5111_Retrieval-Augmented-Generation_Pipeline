{"summary": "shigellosis is caused by four species, S. dysenteriae, S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. sonnei. a total of 47 serotypes of Shigella have been recognized. the vaccine effectiveness depends on the distribution patterns of local species and serotypes. recent reports have indicated that S. flexneri 2a is the most frequently isolated Shigella organism in China [15,16]. the time period of these studies is short, and surveillance is performed only in less-developed areas of China. only one Shigella isolate per patient per diarrheal episode was included in the analysis. p 0.05 was considered statistically significant. only one Shigella isolate per patient per diarrheal episode was included in the analysis. a total of 5999 Shigella isolates were collected from 372 inpatients. a final total of 5987 isolates were further analyzed in this study. subgroup trends A statistically significant decreasing trend in S. flexneri and an increasing trend in S. sonnei were observed by chi-square analysis. between 1994 and 2005, Shigella isolation rates were largely driven by S. flexneri. in 2006, S. sonnei became the dominant subgroup. in 2009, the lowest percentage of isolated S. flexneri (6%) was recorded. S. flexneri 2a and S. sonnei were observed in every year of the study. the number and proportion of S. flexneri 2a isolates decreased from 42.6% in 1994 to 13.6% (n = 3) in 2010. neri serotype 2a S. flexneri serotype 2b S. flexneri serotype 2b S. flexneri serotype 3b S. flexneri serotype 4b S. flexneri serotype 4c S. flexneri serotype 6c S. flexneri serotype x S. flexneri serotype y Sonnei 1994 615 (10.36) 113 (18.37) 0 (0.00) 3 (0.50) 8 (1.33) 11 (1.83) 228 (38.00) 1999 475 (8.00) 6 (1.26) 3 (0.63) 192 (40.42) 3 (0.63) 11 (2.32) 2 (0.42) 4 (0.84) 2 (0.42) 2 (0.42) 2 (0.42) 2 (0.42) 24 (5.05) 54 (11.37) 23 (4.84) 147 (30.95) 2000 433 (7.30) 7 (1.62) 1 (0.23) 132 (30.48 0 (0.00) 9 (5.96) 11 (7.44) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 ( 2.33) 30 (0.51) 3 (0.05) 173 (2.92) 47 (0.79) 188 (3.17) 30 (0.51) 53 (0.89) 178 (3.00) 110 (1.85) 1,639 (27.62) Seasonality Shigella isolates were recovered routinely throughout the study but were frequently recovered in the summer months. 1997 481 (8.02) 15 (3.12) 5 (1.04) 11 (2.29) 19 (3.95) 55 (11.43) 76 (15.80) 85 (17.67) 66 (13.72) 68 (14.14) 52 (10.81) 15 (3.12) 14 (2.91) 1998 602 (10.04) 4 (0.66) 5 (0.83) 4 (0.66) 10 (1.66) 39 (6.48) 82 (13.62) 108 (17.94) 136 (22.59) 94 (15.61) 3 (0.63) 15.96) 24 (25.53) 29 (30.85) 13 (13.83) 2 (2.13) 2 (2.13) 2004 252 (4.20) 1 (0.40) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 5 (1.98) 12 (4.76) 56 (22.22) 102 (40.48) 48 (19.05) 18 (7.14) 5 (1.98) 5 (1.98) 5 (1.98) 2005 148 (2.47) 4 (2.70) 1 (0.68) 3 (2.03) 0 (0.00 the age distribution for the 5934 cases of S. flexneri and S. sonnei is shown in Table 3.

The recording of annual Shigella isolation began in 1994, and the maximum number of isolates was reported in 1996. this trend may be related to the strict hygiene inspection and adequate sanitation during the 2008 Olympic season [17] between 1994 and 2005, Shigella isolation rates were driven by S. flexneri. in 1996, 90% of all isolated Shigella were S. flexneri. in 2009, the lowest percentage of isolated S. flexneri (6%) was recorded. S. flexneri 2a and S. sonnei were observed in every year of the study. the number and proportion of S. flexneri 2a isolates decreased from 42.6% in 1994 to 13.6% in 2010, whereas the proportion of S. sonnei increased from 36.6% (n = 225) to 82.3% (n = 20) during the entire period of data collection. flexneri serotype 4a S. flexneri serotype 4b S. flexneri serotype 4c S. flexneri serotype 4c S. flexneri serotype 6c S. flexneri serotype x S. flexneri serotype y S. sonnei 1994 615 (10.36) 113 (18.37) 0 (0.00) 262 (42.60) 3 (0.49) 0 ( (40.42) 3 (0.63) 11 (2.32) 2 (0.42) 4 (0.84) 2 (0.42) 2 (0.42) 2 (0.42) 24 (5.05) 54 (11.37) 23 (4.84) 147 (30.95) 2000 433 (7.30) 7 (1.62) 1 (0.23) 132 (30.48) 19 (4.39) 7 (1.62) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 2 (0.46) 3 (0.69) 23 (5.31) 8 (1.85) 16 (3.70) 7 (1.62) 0 (0.00) 3 (2.03) 7 (4.74) 1 (0.68) 56 (37.89) 2006 112 (1.89) 7 (6.25) 1 (0.89) 11 (9.83) 6 (5.36) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 (0.00) 0 1,639 Seasonality Shigella isolates were recovered routinely throughout the study but were frequently recovered in the summer months (June to September; t = 7.83, p 0.001; Table 2).
