{"summary": "participants Study participants included 786 febrile patients at the healthcare center for the villages of Dielmo and Ndiop. 78% of the patients were 15 years of age, and the sex ratio was 1:1. qPCR results for the 2 specific genes were positive at a log-based fluorescence cycle threshold (Ct) of 38. results with p0.05 were considered statistically significant. 62.5% of patients were 15 years of age, and the sex ratio was 1:1. we used a 7900HT-thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) to perform qPCR. we included positive (T. whipplei) and negative (PCR mix) controls in each run. we considered samples to be T. whipplei\u2013positive if qPCR results for the 2 specific genes were positive at a log-based fluorescence cycle threshold (Ct) of 38. qPCR results for the 2 specific genes were positive at a log-based fluorescence cycle threshold (Ct) of 38. we considered samples to be T. whipplei\u2013positive if qPCR results for the 2 specific genes were positive. patients 12 months of age, 4.8% (12/250) for those 1\u20133 years of age, 4.2% (5/119) for those 4\u20136 years of age, 5.4% (9/167) for those 7\u201315 years of age, 2.7% (2/75) for those 16\u201329 years of age, and 5.2% (5/97) for those >30 years of age. no significant differences in age distribution were observed. the highest prevalence of T. whipplei bacteremia was detected during august, when 28 (30%) of 93 febrile patients were positive (198%] of 73 patients in Dielmo and 9 [45%] of 20 patients in Ndiop, Senegal, June 2010\u2013March 2012. a total of 29 febrile patients from Dielmo were tested; 17 (58.5%) of the 29 patients had samples (18 total samples) positive for T. whipplei bacteremia. for almost 1 year, all specimens from febrile patients were negative for T. whipplei. in august 2011, only 2 patients were positive in Dielmo and in October 2011 only 1 patient was positive in Ndiop. we could obtain multispacer sequences for only 8 patients at the time of the 2010 peak in T. whipplei bacteremia cases. the genotype corresponds to the concatenation of the 4 spacers (TW133-ProS-SecA-Pro184); however, the corresponding spacer was not available (NA) for any of the patients.
