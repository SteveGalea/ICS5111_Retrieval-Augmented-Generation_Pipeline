{"summary": "coronaviruses contain an envelope, a helical capsid, and a single-stranded and positive-sense RNA genome. the length of their genomes, which are the largest among all RNA viruses, typically ranges between 27 and 32 kb. -coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are highly pathogenic human pathogens. as of 16 October 2014, MERS-CoV had caused 877 infections with a fatality rate of 36% (4\u20137). the binding interaction between coronavirus RBD and its receptor is one of the most important determinants of the coronavirus host range and cross-species infection. coronavirus RBDs contain major neutralization epitopes, induce most of the host immune responses, and may serve as subunit vaccines against coronavirus infections. coronaviruses have evolved a complex receptor recognition pattern. the receptors for coronaviruses have their own physiological functions. ACE2 is a zinc-dependent carboxypeptidase that cleaves one residue from the N terminus of many physiological peptides. the crystal structures of five coronavirus S1 domains complexed with their respective receptor have been determined. the crystal structure of -genus BCoV S1-NTD by itself has been determined, with its sugar-binding site identified through mutagenesis. this article reviews these structural studies and their implications for the receptor recognition and evolution of coronaviruses. the structure of SARS-CoV S1-CTD/ACE2 complex provided the first view of coronavirus S1 and S1/receptor complex. structural topologies of the four coronavirus S1-CTDs are shown as schematic illustrations. the secondary structures of all of the S1-CTDs are colored and numbered in the same way as for HCoV-NL63 S1-CTD. these hot spots are critical for the binding of SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63. the view is derived from the one in panel A by rotating ACE2 by 90\u00b0 along a horizontal axis. a virus-binding hot spot on ACE2 centering on Lys31 is critical for the binding of SARS-CoV S1-CTD. Mutation of residue 479 on SARS-CoV S1-CTD is critical for the transmission of SARS-CoV from human to human. both viruses-binding hot spots provide significant energy to the virus-receptor binding interactions. all of the naturally selected viral mutations in SARS-CoV RBM surround the two hot spots. one of these viral mutations, K479N, facilitated transmission of SARS-CoV from human to human. the core structures of ARS-CoV and SARS-CoV S1-CTDs are highly similar to each other, but their RBMs are markedly different. the different RBMs of the two S1-CTDs indicate a divergent evolutionary pathway that has led to their recognition of different host receptors. HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV S1-CTDs are very different. the core structure of HCoV-NL63 is a -sandwich consisting of two -sheet layers stacked together through hydrophobic interactions. the RBMs of HCoV-NL63 S1-CTD are three short and discontinuous loops. one of the two virus-binding hot spots on ACE2 for SARS-CoV binding plays a similarly critical role in the binding of HCoV-NL63. only RBM1 and RBM2, but not RBM3, are involved in binding the common virus-binding hot spot on ACE2. a divergent evolutional relationship cannot be completely ruled out. coronavirus S1-CTDs attained -sandwich core structures in the -genus and -sheet core structures in the -genus. -coronavirus S1-CTDs diverged in the three RBM loops to acquire different receptor specificities. PRCV and HCoV-NL63 S1-CTDs have highly similar core structures. coronavirus S1-CTDs of -genus HCoV-NL63 and -genus SARS-CoV diverged into different tertiary structures but later converged to recognize the same receptor ACE2. in sum, coronavirus S1-CTDs have undergone convoluted structural evolutions, leading to their complex receptor recognition pattern. MHV S1-NTD does not bind sugars, as revealed by sugar-binding assays. despite its galectin fold, neither the RBM on MHV S1-NTD nor the VBM on CEACAM1 contains any sugar at the binding interface. however, MHV S1-NTD binds to CEACAM1 through exclusive protein-protein interactions. structural topologies of the two coronavirus S1-NTDs (D) and human galectin-3 (E) are shown as schematic illustrations. the secondary structures are colored and numbered in the same way as for the MHV S1-NTD. the overall structure of BCoV S1-NTD is highly similar to that of MHV S1-NTD. MHV and BCoV S1-NTDs are evolutionarily related to human galectins. but they have diverged from human galectins with specificities for a novel protein receptor and a different sugar receptor. -genus MHV S1-NTD has evolved specificity for a different sugar receptor, respectively. MHV S1-NTD lost its lectin activity because proteins in general have advantages over sugars as viral receptors. a study of viral lectins with known tertiary structures revealed that galectin-like domains are present in a variety of viral spikes. this includes influenza virus hemagglutinin, whose galectin-like fold was previously unknown. ACE2 binds to the tip of the SARS-CoV spike trimer, where S1-CTD is located. the more conserved S1-NTDs may function as the more reliable RBDs that recognize sugar receptors. coronaviruses may find additional and high-affinity protein receptors using their fast-evolving S1-CTDs. the structure of trimeric spike complexed with ACE2 is shown. it includes both the schematic topology of the spike and the negative-stain electron micropic images of the spike ectodomain. the question marks indicate possible tertiary structures of coronavirus S1 domains. a viral strategy to steal a host protein and evolve it into viral RBDs with novel protein receptor specificities or altered sugar receptor specificities. a few residue changes at the receptor binding interface can lead to efficient cross-species infection and human-to-human transmission of a virus. crystal structures of coronavirus S1-NTDs complexed with sugar receptors will reveal how sugar receptor specificities are achieved in these viral lectins across different coronavirus genera. three of the four known protein receptors for coronaviruses are peptidases: ACE2, APN, and DPP4. they are all recognized by peptidases: ACE2, APN, and DPP4. structural studies have elucidated many puzzles surrounding receptor recognition, evolution, and cross-species transmission of coronaviruses. future structural studies will continue to solve the remaining puzzles as well as new puzzles that may emerge regarding receptor recognition mechanisms of coronaviruses."}
