{"summary": "hemagglutinin-esterase Activity of Coronavirus Hemagglutinin-Esterase Protein Enhances Viral Replication Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are respiratory pathogens that can invade the central nervous system (CNS) hemagglutinin-esterase protein plays an important role in the production of infectious viral progeny. mutant HBV core protein (V124W) recapitulates the effects of AEfs on assembly. mutations filling the AEf-binding pocket are not viable path for HBV to escape AEfs. suicide gene function encoded in a prototypic armed MeV vector is successfully overcome."}
