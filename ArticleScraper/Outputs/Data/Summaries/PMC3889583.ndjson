{"summary": "the disease is caused by a newly identified bunyavirus, SFTS virus (SFTSV) (1). it is characterized by sudden onset of fever, respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, and a decrease in whole white blood cell and platelet counts that gradually progresses into hemorrhage and multiorgan failure at the end stage. this indicates that this disease is continuing to spread in china. yaviridae family (1) has a single-stranded RNA genome with negative (L and M segments) polarity. the two glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, are highly antigenic envelope proteins. for this reason, viral surface glycoproteins may be targets for neutralizing antibody responses. MAb 4-5 mediates neutralization by blocking the binding of Gn to the cellular receptor. these data suggest that MAb 4-5 could be developed into a therapeutic agent in passive immunotherapy. human lymphocytes were collected from 5 convalescent SFTS patients in Jiangsu province. the research protocol was approved by the human bioethics committee of Jiangsu center for disease prevention and control. soluble ScFv and IgG1 MAbs were expressed in top10 E. coli. all ScFv contained a 6His tag at the carboxy terminus. all ScFv contained a 6His tag that facilitated purification. each antibody was considered to have neutralizing capacity if it could inhibit 90% of viral CPE. each antibody was considered to have neutralizing capacity if it could inhibit 90% of viral CPE. blots were visualized by 3,3\u2032diaminobenzidine (DAB) human MAb 4-5 IgG1 or an irrelevant human IgG1 were incubated with the fixed cells for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. cells were fixed by treatment with acetone for 10 min at 20\u00b0C. immunoelectron microscopy of the SFTSV virion was performed as described previously (20) one ectodomain was identified for Gn (amino acids [aa] 20 to 452) and Gc (aa 1 to 473) their genes were generated by PCR and cloned into a pXJ40-HA expression vector. these functional domains were expressed in 293 cells by transient transfection. recombinant protein-containing supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting. the purified virions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to confirm purity. all operations involving SFTSV were performed under biosafety level 2 containment conditions. the human antibody library was constructed after electrotransformation of the ScFv gene reservoir into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) the human antibody library was constructed after electrotransformation of the gene reservoir into the phagemid vector pComb3X. bound phages were eluted and used to reinfect XL1-Blue E. coli. IgG1 MAb was expressed by cotransfection with a recombinant IgG1 plasmid. the supernatant containing recombinant human IgG1 was purified through protein G columns. it was then transferred onto monolayers of Vero cells in 96-well plates. JS-2010-003 virions were lysed with sample buffer and proteins were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE. blots were visualized by 3,3\u2032diaminobenzidine (DAB) blots were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence assay. monoclonal antibodies were detected by incubation on droplets of anti-human IgG gold 10-nm conjugates. the grids were negatively contrasted with 2% phosphotungstic acid. one ectodomain was identified for Gn (amino acids [aa] 20 to 452) and Gc (aa 1 to 473) the human ScFv library was panned against the purified inactivated SFTSV virion coated on plastic plates. after 3 rounds of panning, 90 randomly picked clones were screened. 14 clones were found to recognize SFTSV by ELISA. MAb 4-5 IgG1 exhibited far more potent neutralization activity against SFTSV than its ScFv format. concentration required to obtain 50% neutralization of 100 TCID50 SFTSV was about 2.0 g/ml. control antibody did not exhibit any neutralization activity against SFTSV. a human antibody IgG1 against enterovirus 71 was used as a negative control. the ability of MAb 4-5 IgG1 to neutralize the indicated viral strains at a concentration of 5 g/ml was measured. 4-5 caused localization of the gold label to the outer peplomer region of the SFTSV JS-2010-003 strain. a control human IgG1 did not induce any labeling. helices were predicted using TMHMM server version 2.0. one ectodomain was identified for Gn (aa 20 to 452) and Gc (aa 1 to 473). western blot analysis showed that it reacted with the Gn but not with the Gc ectodomain. the human ScFv library was panned against the purified inactivated SFTSV virion coated on plastic plates. after 3 rounds of panning, 90 randomly picked clones were screened. after 3 rounds of panning, 90 randomly picked clones were screened. 14 clones were found to recognize SFTSV by ELISA. the control antibody did not exhibit any neutralization activity against SFTSV. MAb 4-5 IgG1 was separately incubated in the presence of 100 TCID50 isolates for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. a human antibody IgG1 against enterovirus 71 was used as a negative control. the ability of MAb 4-5 IgG1 to neutralize the indicated viral strains was measured using a neutralization assay. purified JS-2010-003 strain virions were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred on an NC membrane. they probably represent Gn glycoprotein and homo- or hetero-oligomer of Gn or Gn/Gc compared to purified virion SDS-PAGE profile. map the region bound by MAb 4-5, Gn and Gc ectodomains were expressed separately in 293 cells. Western blot analysis showed that it reacted with the Gn but not with the Gc ectodomain. this suggested that MAb 4-5 recognized an exposed loop (aa 20 to 452) in the N terminus of the Gn protein. a human antibody against SFTSV was described. the actual breadth of the neutralizing spectrum, functional activity, and binding target were also investigated. antibodies can block viral attachment to target cells by interfering with virus-receptor interactions. 4-5 generated from the memory B cell repertoire of SFTS convalescent patients was found to neutralize SFTSV infectivity by interfering with the interactions between the virus and its receptor. the recombinant Gn ectodomain (aa 20 to 452) is bound by the antibody, demonstrating that this ectodomain is the primary domain for cellular membrane attachment, corresponding to the putative exposed loop for receptor binding in bunyavirus. this uncharacterized epitope can resist the host immune pressure and plays a critical role in the receptor binding that takes place during viral transmission. MAb 4-5 reacts with a linear epitope rather than a conformational one. this may facilitate rational vaccine design. new strategies may be required to deplete library of phages that can bind irrelevant targets to enhance specific clone enrichment ratios. further work will be required to delineate the precise structure of this epitope, which may have important implications for the design of vaccines."}
