{"summary": "human noroviruses (HuNoVs) are now considered the leading cause of viral gastroenteritis in humans. they are estimated to cause 684 million cases of diarrheal disease, 1.1 million hospitalizations, and 212,000 deaths annually worldwide. they are highly contagious, infecting people of all ages. noroviral genomic RNA is transcribed into a subgenomic RNA that contains ORF2 and ORF3. the 5\u2032-proximal ORF1 encodes a polyprotein that is self-cleaved into six nonstructural proteins (NS1/2, NS3, NS4, NS5/VPg, NS6Pro, and NS7/RdRP) viral RNA (vRNA) contains multiple cis-acting elements that play pivotal roles in vRNA replication, translation, and encapsidation. for many RNA viruses, the viral RNA (vRNA) contains multiple cis-acting elements that play pivotal roles in vRNA replication, translation, and encapsidation during the viral life cycle (11\u201313) a wide range of RNA viruses, including flavivirus (21), picornavirus (22), alphavirus (23), coronavirus (24), reovirus (25), iflavirus (26), and alphatetravirus (27) have been found to encode their own RNA helicases and/or RNA chaperones (28) the norovirus NS3 protein, also known as p41, contains signature motifs that are conserved in superfamily 3 NS3 encoded by genus GI.1 HuNoV also has NTP-dependent RNA helicase activity. NS3 can facilitate in vitro synthesis by NV NS7/RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) on the 3\u2032 antigenomic template, suggesting that NS3 plays an important role in norovirus RNA replication. norovirus NS3 has not yet been reported. we modeled the NV NS3 structure using the ROBETTA server for protein structure prediction and analysis. predicted model of NV NS3 revealed two structurally independent domains. NV NS3 hydrolyzed all four types of NTPs (Fig. 2A) however, NV NS3 exhibited similar efficiency in the hydrolysis of these NTPs. the ATPase activity of MBP-NS3 was determined at the indicated concentrations of ATP (B), Mg2+ (C) or at the indicated pH (D). broad activity was maintained between pH 6.8 and pH 8.0. we also expressed the MBP fusion with NV NS3 using Escherichia coli. showed biochemical properties similar to those of the MBP-NS3NV expressed by eukaryotes. NV NS3 has nucleic acid helix-unwinding activity. the standard RNA/RNA helix (R*/R substrate) is illustrated in the upper diagram. 0.1 pmol of each indicated substrate was reacted with 20 pmol of each indicated protein. boiled reaction mixture (lane 1) and reaction mixture with MBP alone (lane 3) were used as negative controls.

RNA helix substrates with either a 5\u2032 or a 3\u2032 protrusion could be unwound by MBP-NS3. NV NS3 directs the unwinding of the RNA helix from both 5\u20323\u2032 and 3\u20325\u2032 directions in an ATP-dependent manner. the asterisks indicate HEX-labeled strands. helix unwinding was detected as described for Fig. 3. the conserved SF3 A motif is critical for the helicase activity of NS3. NS3 contains consensus motifs that are characteristic of SF3 helicases. conserved SF3 motifs are critical for the helicase activity of NS3. a portion of the helical RNA substrate could still be unwound by MBP-NS3 in the absence of ATP. the conserved SF3 A motif is critical for its helicase activity. RNA helicases and RNA chaperones possess RNA-remodeling activities. NV NS3 also contains RNA-chaperoning activity to destabilize structured RNA strands and promote annealing. RNA helix (R*/R) substrate (0.1 pmol) was reacted with 20 pmol MBP-NS3. RNA chaperones are generally thought to destabilize misfolded RNA secondary structures to facilitate the re-formation of more stable RNA structures. nt strands form a defined stem-loop secondary structure; one strand is 5\u2032 HEX labeled and the other is unlabeled. ATP or other NTPs were not supplemented. vRNA replication generates viral replicative-intermediate double-stranded RNAs that could be unwound by RNA helicases in order to recycle vRNA templates. NV NS3 facilitates noroviral RNA synthesis in vitro. in vitro-transcribed NV 3\u2032 end (nt 1 to 400) of ()-vRNA template was incubated with 10 pmol recombinant NS7/RdRP and NTP mixture in the absence or presence of 10 pmol MBP-NS3 (B) or MBP-NS3GK168AA (D) at 30\u00b0C for 30, 60, or 90 min as indicated. SHV NS3 inhibits the biochemical activities of NV NS3. the two strands were mixed 1:1 (0.1 pmol each) and reacted with 10 pmol MBP-NS3 for 30 min in the presence of different concentrations of GuHCl in the absence of different concentrations. the hybridization of the two strands was detected by gel electrophoresis and scanning on a Typhoon 9500 imager. the preannealed (lane 1) or boiled (lane 2) reaction mixture was used as a positive or negative control, respectively. the effect of GuHCl or 2CMC on NV replicon RNA levels was determined by examining the impact on NV replicon RNA levels in HGT-NV cells. ATPase activity show similar sensitivities to NV NS3. the effects of GuHCl on helicase and ATPase activities of NV NS3 are moderate but similar to the observed effects on EV71 2CATPase (22). NV NS3 (NS3NV) shares similar consensus motifs and structure with other SF3 viral helicases. comparison of amino acid sequence of NV NS3 with those of members of the SF3 viral helicases. previous studies by Pfister and Wimmer found that bacterially expressed SHV NS3 has NTPase activity (33). to confirm whether NV NS3 also has this activity, we expressed a recombinant maltose binding protein (MBP-NS3) using a baculovirus expression system. NV NS3 hydrolyzed all four types of NTPs (Fig. 2A) the ATPase activity of MBP-NS3 was found to be optimal at a 2 mM Mg2+ concentration, but higher levels of Mg2+ inhibited the ATPase activity. the optimal pH for MBP-NS3 ATPase activity was found to be 7.6 but broad activity was maintained between pH 6.8 and pH 8.0. NV NS3 has nucleic acid helix-unwinding activity. the standard RNA/RNA helix (R*/R substrate) is illustrated in the upper diagram. helix unwinding was detected via gel electrophoresis. the asterisks indicate the HEX-labeled strands. the helix substrate is a DNA duplex (D*/D*/D*/D. RNA-DNA hybrids with longer unlabeled RNA (D*/R) or DNA (R*/D) strand. each helix substrate was reacted with MBP-NS3 under the same condition. results showed that NV NS3 could efficiently unwind either of the RNA-DNA hybrids but unwound the DNA duplexes less effectively. helix-unwinding activity was detected by gel electrophoresis and scanning on a Typhoon 9500 imager. NV NS3 directs RNA helix unwinding from both 5\u20323\u2032 and 3\u20325\u2032 directions. directionality of helix unwinding is a fundamental characteristic of helicases (19) asterisks indicate the HEX-labeled strands. MBP-NS3 (20 pmol) was incubated with 5\u2032 single-strand protruded (lane 3) or 3\u2032 single-strand protruded (lane 6) RNA helix substrate (0.1 pmol) nonboiled reaction mixtures were used as negative or positive controls. both the GK168AA and GK168AA-DD212AA mutations dramatically reduced the helix-unwinding activity of NS3 compared to the wild type (WT) these findings show that the conserved SF3 motifs are critical for the helicase activity of NV NS3. NV NS3 requires NTP to reach its optimal helix-unwinding activity. a portion of the helical RNA substrate could still be unwound by MBP-NS3 in the absence of ATP. the incorporation of 5 mM AMP-PNP instead of ATP did not completely abolish RNA helix unwinding by MBP-NS3. two strands were mixed 1:1 (0.1 pmol each) and reacted with the indicated amounts of MBP-NS3. the hybridization assay was conducted in the absence (lanes 3 to 6) or presence (lanes 7 to 10) of 20 pmol MBP-NS3. NV NS3 can destabilize structured RNAs and facilitate the formation of a more stable RNA structure. for positive-strand RNA viruses, their RdRP-mediated vRNA replication generates viral replicative-intermediate double-stranded RNAs. NV NS3 promotes noroviral RNA synthesis in vitro. the presence of WT MBP-NS3 promoted the NS7/RdRP-mediated production of (+)-vRNA strands from the ()-vRNA templates. on the other hand, the A motif mutation mostly eliminated the promoting effect of MBP-NS3 on in vitro RNA synthesis. nTPase assays showed that GuHCl inhibited the ATPase activity of NV NS3 in a dose-dependent manner. this result is in contrast to a previous observation by Pfister and Wimmer, who demonstrated that even in the presence of up to 10 mM GuHCl, the ATPase activity of SHV NS3 was not inhibited. the two strands were mixed 1:1 (0.1 pmol each) and reacted with 10 pmol MBP-NS3 for 30 min in the absence of NTP. the hybridization of the two strands was detected by gel electrophoresis and scanning on a Typhoon 9500 imager. our results showed that the presence of GuHCl inhibited helix unwinding by NS3 in a dose-dependent manner. we examined the effect of GuHCl on the RNA-chaperoning activity of NV NS3 using an RNA strand hybridization assay. the presence of 1.125 or 3.25 mM GuHCl significantly reduced the level of NV RNA to around 50% of that under mock treatment. the presence of 1.125 or 3.25 mM GuHCl did not affect the viability of HGT-1 cells, as was found for 2CMC-treated cells. this excludes the possibility that the inhibitory effect of GuHCl on NV RNA replication was due to inducing cell death. vRI-dsRNAs must be efficiently unwound, thereby releasing nascently synthesized progeny vRNAs from vRNA templates. vRI-dsRNAs contain multiple cis-acting elements, highly structured RNA regions that usually play pivotal roles in the replication, translation, and encapsidation of vRNAs. a specific RNA structure required for one vRNA function may need disruption and refold norovirus NS3 has recently been found to associate with vRI-dsRNAs in vRC on intracellular membranes. this indicates the critical roles of NS3 in norovirus RNA replication. despite technical limitations, the RNA-remodeling activities of viral proteins have been mainly studied in vitro. enterovirus 2CATPase, another SF3 viral RNA helicase, has been found to be inhibited by 1 mM GuHCl, as is enterovirus replication. high concentrations of Mg2+ (>2 mM) have been found to inhibit helix unwinding by either NV NS3 or SHV NS3. guanidine derivatives have attracted widespread interest for developing drugs against various diseases. some of them have been found to be potential antivirals against hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and flaviviruses (21, 58, 59) the cDNA of NV NS3 was synthesized by Tian Yi Hui Yuan Biotech Co. (Wuhan, China) and cloned into the vector pFastBac HTB-MBP. the resulting plasmids were subjected to the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus system. NV NS3 was modeled by submitting its amino acid sequence to the HMMSTR/Rosetta server. five models were obtained, and the best one was chosen as a template based on its score. the two strands were mixed at a 1:1 ratio in a 10-l reaction mixture containing 25 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0) and 25 mM NaCl. the mixture was then heated to 95\u00b0C for 5 min and gradually cooled to 25\u00b0C to produce helical duplexes. all the HEX-labeled DNA and RNA strands were purchased from TaKaRa (Dalian, China), unlabeled RNA hybridization assay carried out according to standard procedures. indicated amount of protein, 0.2 pmol HEX-labeled stem-loop-structured RNA strand and 0.2 pmol unlabeled stem-loop-structured RNA strand were added to reaction buffer and incubated for 1 h or the indicated time. MBP-NS3 was included in 10-l reaction mixtures containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 12.5 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 20 U RNasin (Promega), and 5 mM NTPs. after that, the reaction was terminated with 2 loading buffer (20% 10 MOPS [morpholinepropanesulf a single clone, referred to as HGT-NV, was selected for future use. the cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at 1,000 cells per well without G418. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 3 days. the effect of GuHCl treatment on replicon RNA was then evaluated. NS3 was modeled by submitting its amino acid sequence to the SWISS-MODEL server (ROBETTA, University of Washington, University of.. the best one was chosen as a template based on its score and assessed by submitting it to the. SWISS-MODEL server (ROBETTA, University of. Washington, University of. Basel, Switzerland) the concentrations of released inorganic phosphate were determined by matching the A620 in a known inorganic phosphate curve. all of the results given by this quantitative assay were averages of three independently repeated experiments. 3\u2032 protrusions were annealed using RNA1 and RNA2, the DNA helix substrate was annealed using RNA1 and RNA3. the 3\u2032 protruded RNA helix was annealed using RNA1 and RNA4. the 5\u2032 protruded RNA helix was annealed using RNA1 and RNA5. the cDNA of HuNoV NS7/RdRP was amplified by PCR from full-length GII.4-Sydney HuNoV cDNA. it was cloned into the vector pMAl-c2X-MBP. the indicated amounts of MBP-NS3 were included in 10-l reaction mixtures. the samples were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde denaturing gels. they were transferred onto N+ nylon membranes (Roche) the probe for the Northern blots is listed in Table 1."}
