{"summary": "the severity and clinical impact of an influenza season varies from year to year. this depends on a number of factors such as vaccination efficacy and circulating influenza strain. there is also growing evidence of the importance of other viruses causing respiratory illnesses resulting in hospitalization. the aim of this study was to investigate the role of different respiratory viruses in the severity of outcomes among patients admitted to an adult tertiary teaching hospital in Perth, western Australia. the hospital information system data from that time period were searched using the following codes from the international classification of diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) virological testing data were obtained from PathWest Laboratory Medicine WA (PathWest), who perform routine virological testing for SCGH. a patient record was matched with a PathWest record if the patient received virological testing within 7 days either side of their hospital admission date. records were matched using either Unit Medical Record Number and date of birth, or name and date of birth. logistic regression was used to assess differences in the risk of discharge between patients with different viral infections at any particular point in time. patients with no virus detected, multiple viruses detected or influenza A unsubtyped were excluded in all multivariable models. multivariable models were constructed for each outcome, comparing patients with INF-B, RSV, hMPV or PIV to those with A/H1 or A/H3. patients with no virus detected, multiple viruses detected or influenza A unsubtyped, were excluded in all multivariable models. 563 (32.1%) tested positive for at least one virus (Table 1). A/H3 was the most common, being detected in 177 (10.1%) patients. median age of patients with a virus detected was 65 years. 149 (26.5%) 293 (24.6%) 28 (43.1%) 33 (18.8%) 17 (22.1%) 25 (24.8%) 23 (27.4%) 24 (35.3%) 65 + y.o. 815 (46.5%) 283 (50.3%) 532 (44.7%) 14 (21.6%)* 104 (58.8%) 37 (48.1%) 57 (56.4%) 40 (47.6%) 36 (52.9%) Female 845 (48.2%) 279 (49.6%) 566 (47.6%) 26 1 (0.6%) 2 (2.6%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) *Statistically significant difference compared to A/H1 in univariate analysis. of the 563 patients with a virus, 526 (93.4%) were tested either prior to, or within 2 days of hospital admission. commonest comorbidities amongst the patients who tested positive for one of these viruses were COPD in 17.1%, and diabetes in 12.8% (Table 1). the proportion of tested patients who were positive for A/H3 varied more over the four-year study period compared to other viruses. A/H3 was the dominant influenza virus in two out of the four years studied (2012 and 2013) and was equally dominant with INF-B in 2015 (40 detections each, 7.7%), while A/H1 dominated in 2014. of patients in the study All tested patients Any virus detected No virus detected A/H1 A/H3 INF-B RSV hMPV PIV LOS (days) Median (IQR) 5 (2\u20139) 4 (2\u20138) 5 (3\u201311) 5 (3\u20138)* 4 (2\u20137) 3 (2\u20136) 5 (3\u201318)* 4 (2\u20137) 3 (2\u20139) ICU admission 325 (18.6%) 68 (12.1%) 257 (21.6%) 19 (29.2%)* Statistically significant difference compared to A/H1 in univariate analysis.
