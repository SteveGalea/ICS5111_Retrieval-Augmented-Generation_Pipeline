{"summary": "a blood ion level >7 g/L indicates potential for ARMDs. a systematic review and meta-analysis of the performance of metal ion testing for ARMDs. a systematic review and meta-analysis of the performance of blood metal ion testing for adverse reactions to metal debris (ARMDs) in patients with metal-on-metal (MoM) hip implants. it has been estimated that over a million patients have received these implants worldwide. in the 1980s, MoM bearings were introduced as an improvement on standard metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) bearings. in addition, MoM bearings facilitate greater hip stability and range of movement from larger head sizes. also, MoM bearings allow for bone-conserving hip resurfacing (HR) the most detailed guidelines were put forth by the United Kingdom\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency. a blood metal ion level > 7 g/L indicates potential for soft-tissue reaction. readers identified articles evaluating a hip prosthesis and reporting cobalt and/or chromium blood ion concentrations. only studies that evaluated metal ion levels for screening or for diagnosis of symptomatic patients were eligible. literature search and data extraction We conducted an electronic search to identify relevant articles that reported original research findings including blood ion concentrations in patients with total hip arthroplasty (THA) or hip resurfacing (HR) only studies that evaluated metal ion levels for screening or for diagnosis of symptomatic patients were eligible. studies that recruited patients who underwent revision surgery were excluded (three studies, 81 hips) the prevalence of ARMDs ranged from 29% to 69%, and the prevalence of symptoms ranged from 23.6% to 100%. only 50% of studies36,38,39 used MARS MRI as the benchmark for diagnosis. three studies reported more than one estimate (a) three studies reported more than one estimate (a) circle size is proportional to sample size in (e) and prevalence in (f) and (g) g/L cut-points did not exclusively use MARS MRI as the benchmark. sample size, ARMD prevalence, prevalence of symptomatic patients, and ion test characteristics were not associated with cut-point heterogeneity. our best estimate of the \u201ctrue\u201d ROC curve for metal ion test is the mean SROC curve plotted in Figure 3. blood ion levels are a poor test for classifying patients as having or not having an ARMD. the prevalence of ARMDs and symptomatic patients in the included studies spanned a wide range (29% to 69%), therefore, we could graphically evaluate for a spectrum effect. maximising NPV is burdensome because 99% of patients will test positive. test-positive patients still have a 21% probability of having an ARMD. the risk of an ARMD is marginally different from the pre-test probability. the methodological heterogeneity only manifested in heterogeneity in the cut-point effect, and not in the accuracy effect. this is a moot point because the accuracy of the test is so poor. grants and royalties for work and consultancy unrelated to this paper. funding from MEDACTA, Corin, Zimmer Biomet, Depuy, J & J."}
