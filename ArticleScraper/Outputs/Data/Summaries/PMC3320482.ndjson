{"summary": "contact network models capture and estimate interpersonal contacts that lead to disease transmission within a community. each person in a community is represented as a vertex in the network. each contact between 2 people is represented as an edge connecting the vertexes. the number of edges emanating from a vertex is the degree of that vertex. to model the directional flow of infected patients into a hospital, we include directed edges from persons in the population at large to caregivers in the hospital. if a caregiver at the hospital acquired SARS while person A remained healthy in the community, then no opportunity would exist for transmission in the opposite direction. s. Diseases with average transmissibility >Tc will spark large-scale epidemics with probability S. the value of Tc depends on the contact patterns within a community. when abundant opportunities exist for transmission, disease will spread easily. the heterogeneous spread of SARS worldwide suggested context-dependent patterns of transmission with relatively rapid spread through hospitals and relatively slow spread through communities (29). a notable exception to this pattern, the large cluster of SARS cases outside a healthcare setting in the amoy Gardens apartment complex in Hong Kong seems to have spread through aerosolization of virus-laden sewage rather than direct person-to-person contact. the epidemic threshold Tc separates the 2 zones. a transmission-reduction intervention causes the black circle to slide on a new position on the curve. a successful intervention lowers T to a value Tc. we created an urban contact network model with 2,000 households with an average household size of 2.6 (5,154 persons) most of the edges in the network are undirected, meaning that transmission may occur in either direction (black edges in Figure 1). a communication between 2 persons depends on the location and nature of their daily activities. for a given disease, the distribution of transmissibilities is based on empiric estimates for the diversity in infectious periods and the per day probability of transmission between persons who come into contact with each other. public health interventions aim to reduce the number of new infected cases. ideally decreasing the effective reproductive number of the disease below the epidemic threshold, Reff1. the difference between average transmissibility T and the basic reproductive ratio R0 is important. transmission-reduction and contact-reduction interventions are shown in Figure 2. the solid curves represent the predicted size of an outbreak and the probability of an epidemic for an entire spectrum of T from 0 to 1 in an urban setting. the horizontal axes cover the spectrum of disease transmissibility. an outbreak of disease with T = 0.245 will almost certainly spark an epidemic in the absence of intervention. a successful intervention either reduces T so that it lies below Tc or modifies the structure of the network so that Tc rises above T. gray entries correspond to unsuccessful interventions. white entries indicate strategies predicted to successfully move pathogen below epidemic threshold. results are for a mildly contagious disease with a transmissibility T = 0.075. general vaccination protects a percentage of persons chosen randomly from the population. ring vaccination involves isolating the patient and the associated reduction in the infectious period followed by targeted vaccination of contacts. the degree to which contacts are successfully protected depends on the success of contact tracing and the efficacy of the vaccine. an outbreak can be controlled with isolation that reduces the infectious period by 25% and quarantine that successfully sequesters 30% of all case-patient contacts. if Reff1 outbreaks will die out, while if Reff>1, epidemics may ensue. a mildly contagious disease like SARS may be thwarted by partial coverage (75%) with a moderately efficacious vaccine (60% vaccine efficacy) ring vaccination of close contacts, on the other hand, is a very effective approach overall. this intervention involves both transmission and contact reduction. for low T, outbreaks tend to be small and close to the average outbreak size s. as T increases toward the epidemic threshold, the distribution of outbreak sizes widens substantially, and s becomes less informative. the network used in the analysis above has an epidemic threshold Tc=0.048. the probability for the particular network that we studied lie very close to the mean probabilities. the narrow confidence intervals suggest that our predictions are fairly robust to the particular architecture of the urban network. Isolation will not preclude an epidemic for a highly transmissible disease unless clinical and diagnostic tools can be applied early and confidently. an outbreak can be controlled with a combination of isolation and quarantine that reduces the infectious period by 25% and quarantine that successfully sequesters 30% of all case-patient contacts. a mildly contagious disease can become epidemic unless a population receives 95% coverage with a 100% efficacious vaccine. ring vaccination of close contacts, on the other hand, is a very effective approach overall. this intervention involves both transmission and contact reduction. for low T, outbreaks tend to be small and close to the average outbreak size s. as T increases toward the epidemic threshold, the distribution of outbreak sizes widens substantially, and s becomes less informative. the network used in the analysis above has an epidemic threshold Tc=0.048. the probabilities for the particular network that we studied lie very close to the mean probabilities. the narrow confidence intervals suggest that our predictions are fairly robust to the particular architecture of the urban network. the rate of disease transmission has been measured and reported in terms of the basic reproductive number R0. the value of R0 may vary substantially, depending on the population in which it is measured. recent estimates of R0 for SARS ranged from 1.2 to 3.6 (34\u201336) according to statistics Canada, Vancouver has 758,715 households and an average household size of 2.6 with a distribution. we then classify persons in each household as children, adults, or seniors, according to Vancouver demographics. the number and sizes of public places are largely based on publicly available statistics for Vancouver. to make contacts within schools, we first randomly divide students into subsets corresponding to classrooms, with average size 25. we then create contacts between any 2 students in the same classroom with a specified probability 0.3. each hospital is similarly divided into wards, with patients primarily contacting others within their ward and caregivers with high rates of contact across multiple wards. simulated an urban network with 2,000 households (5,200 persons) we used this relatively small network because it allowed extensive epidemic simulation as a means to verify our analytical predictions. we considered the sensitivity of our results to the size of the network. as the network size increases from 1,000 households to 20,000 households, the probability of an epidemic remains almost identical. distributions are based on information about transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome in the absence of intervention (38,39) for both diseases, we model intervention strategies by decreasing the duration of infectiousness, the probability of transmission for specific contacts in the network. we then calculate the average transmissibility T of the modified network for use in percolation analysis. newman previously derived these quantities for a completely undirected network (40). we derive these quantities by using percolation theory and generating function methods in another manuscript. the basic reproductive number can be written as. research at the university of British Columbia, the city of Vancouver, and the Vancouver Public School Board (vsb.bc.ca/default.htm) according to statistics, Vancouver has 758,715 households and an average household size of 2.6 with a distribution as shown in Figure A1. a single infected member of a household will not necessarily transmit the disease to all members of the household. to make contacts within schools, we randomly divide students into subsets corresponding to classrooms, with average size 25. each hospital is similarly divided into wards, with patients primarily contacting others within their ward and caregivers with high rates of contact across multiple wards. we considered the sensitivity of our results to the size of the network. as the network size increases from 1,000 households to 20,000 households, the probability of an epidemic remains almost identical. despite a 20-fold increase in the size of network, the distributions vary only slightly. pjkm is the probability that any given person in the population has in-degree = j, out-degree = k, and undirected-degree = m. pjkm is the probability that any given person in the population has in-degree = j, out-degree = k, and undirected-degree = m, and let pjkm be the average transmissibility of the disease. a completely undirected network equation (1) can be simplified as, (8) where k is the degree of the persons leading to an undirected degree distribution, pk (37,40). if the degrees follow a Poisson distribution with an average degree of C, then k = C and k2 = C(C + 1) and R0 = CT."}
