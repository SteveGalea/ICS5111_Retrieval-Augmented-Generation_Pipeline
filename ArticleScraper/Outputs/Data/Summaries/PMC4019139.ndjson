{"summary": "the genome of the coV murine hepatitis virus (MHV) is one of the largest known replicating RNA molecules, at 31.3 kb (1). replicase polyproteins are proteolytically processed by papain-like protease 1 (PLP1) and PLP2 in nsp3 and by the nsp5 protease (3CLpro) the mechanisms by which RCs form, RNA synthesis occurs, and nucleocapsids transit to sites of replication remain unknown. studies of coV replication complex formation have involved immunofluorescence imaging of fixed cells using antibodies against native proteins (10, 12, 15, 16) nsp2 is a 65-kDa protein that has been shown to localize to coV replication complexes but is dispensable for virus replication in culture. nsp3 is a 210-kDa protein that contains two essential proteases and other functional protein domains. all polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits unless otherwise indicated. for MHV, these included antibodies specific for nsp1 (VU221) (16), nsp2 (VU154) (15), nsp3 (VU164) (26), and nsp8 (VU123) (11). Mouse monoclonal antibody specific for full-length GFP was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. reporter genes were cloned from pEGFP-C1 (GFP; Clontech) and pGEM-Luc (firefly luciferase; Promega). MHV left nsp1 primer MHV nsp1. cDNA assembly strategies for MHV were used for cloning or mutagenesis. capped, polyadenylated RNA transcripts of MHV infectious cDNA were generated in vitro. mutant viral transcripts were mixed and electropo. cells were grown to subconfluence, trypsinized, and then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 107 cells/ml. six hundred microliters of cells was then added to RNA transcripts in a 4-mm-gap electroporation cuvette. three electrical pulses of 850 V at 25 F were delivered with a bio-Rad cells were washed 3 times for 5 min per wash, followed by a final wash in PBS, and then rinsed in distilled water. images were processed and assembled by using Adobe Photoshop CS2 (9.0.2) radiolabeled cells were labeled with [35S]Met-Cys at a concentration of 0.08 mCi/ml. cells were lysed in 1 ml no-SDS lysis buffer (1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate [DOC], 150 mM sodium chloride [naCl], and 50 mM Tris [pH 8.0] at 7 to 10 h p.i. a full-range rainbow ladder (GE Healthcare) and a 14C ladder (PerkinElmer LAS) were used as molecular weight standards. for viral replication analysis, DBT cells were infected in triplicate with mutant viruses at the MOIs indicated for each experiment. each flask was passaged 10 times, as described previously for serial virus passages. cells were imaged by using a 40 oil immersion lens through DIC, FITC, Cy3, and 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) filters. resulting images were merged and assembled by using Nikon Elements, ImageJ, and Adobe Photoshop CS2. MHV-nsp2, with an in-frame deletion of nsp2, and MHV-CS2 with a deletion of the nsp2-3 cleavage site P1 Glu, were described previously (26) the polyclonal antibodies used in biochemical and imaging experiments were described previously. insertions of reporter genes in place of nsp2 coding sequences of MHV were engineered by using PCR with primers shown in Table 1. AB, CD, and EF PCR amplicons were ligated into an ABCDEF product by using the class IIs restriction enzyme method. ligation products were cloned into the appropriate fragment A vector by using unique sites.

DBT cells grown to 60% confluence on 12-mm glass coverslips were infected with reporter viruses. at 10 h postinfection, medium was aspirated from cells, and cells were fixed and permeabilized in methanol at 20\u00b0C overnight. cells were rehydrated in PBS for 20 min and blocked in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) cells were infected with MHV-GFP2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 PFU/cell. cells were imaged by using a 40 oil immersion lens through differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) filters. the lysate was combined with protein A-Sepharose beads and a 1:200 dilution of antibody in no-SDS lysis buffer supplemented with 1% SDS. beads were pelleted and washed with low-salt lysis buffer (no-SDS lysis buffer with 150 mM NaCl) and a final low-salt wash (no-SDS lysis buffer with 150 mM NaCl) layers of DBT cells in T25 flasks were infected with MHV or MHV-GFP2 alone or at a 1:1, 1:10, or 10:1 ratio of WT MHV to MHV-GFP2 at a total MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell. each flask was passaged 10 times, and 1 ml supernatant was collected and stored at 80\u00b0C. lysates were vortexed and centrifuged briefly at top speed. cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle. after freeze-thaw, supernatants were transferred into new tubes. yncytia was detected by 24 h postelectroporation for both recombinant viruses. medium supernatants from electroporated cultures were used to infect fresh DBT cells. RNA was harvested and amplified by RT-PCR for sequencing of the entire genome. protein of MHV is shown with nonstructural protein domains 1 to 16 (nsp) nsp5 protease domains PL1 and PL2 are indicated by gray and white boxes, respectively, in nsp3. nsp5 protease (3CLpro and Mpro) is indicated by the black box. se polyprotein, DBT cells were infected with MHV, MHV-2-GFP3 or MHV-2-FFL3 and radiolabeled. proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates of infected cells with antibodies specific for nsp1, -2, -3, -2-3, and -8. processing was occurring at junction between nsp1 and GFP. reporter junctions but minimally or not processed at the engineered cleavage sites between the reporter and nsp3. this result serendipitously demonstrated that viable recombinant MHV could be engineered with a reporter fusion with the 210-kDa nsp3 protein. radiolabeled proteins were immunoprecipitated and detected by fluorography. anti-nsp2 immunoprecipitated proteins of 92 kDa or 126 kDa. anti-nsp2 immunoprecipitated proteins of 92 kDa or 126 kDa. recombinant viruses expressed reporters as fusions with nsp3 or with nsp2. MHV-nsp2 replicates with kinetics similar to those of WT MHV. MHV mutants engineered to abolish cleavage site 2 between nsp2 and nsp3 (MHV-CS2) demonstrated a prolonged eclipse phase but ultimately achieved WT-like peak titers (36). a loss of cleavage between nsp1 and nsp2 has been demonstrated to result in a decreased viral yield but WT replication phenotypes of MHV-2-GFP3 and MHV-2-FFL3 result from the deletion of nsp2 and the fusion of nsp2 with nsp3 and not from the insertion of foreign genes themselves. these results support previous studies proposing that cleavage at the nsp3 N terminus is required for efficient onset of exponential replication (36). cells infected with MHV-2-GFP3 or MHV-2-FFL3 showed punctate cytoplasmic localization. both GFP and FFL colocalized with nsp8, a replicase protein known to localize to replication complexes. the punctate nature of the reporter localization suggests a mechanism for specific targeting to replication complexes. nsp2, anti-nsp3, anti-nsp8, and anti-M) were detected by native fluorescence. competitive fitness of WT MHV versus MHV-GFP2. DBT cells were infected with MHV or MHV-GFP2 alone or at a 1:1, 1:10, or 10:1 ratio of WT MHV to MHV-GFP2. at 8 h p.i., cells were fixed and imaged for nsp8 (red) and GFP (green) every 10th image was analyzed for corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) by selecting the cell as the region of interest (ROI) and correcting for the background within each individual image. green fluorescence was evident from the first frame, and the CTCF value nearly tripled throughout infection, until it peaked at 6.75 h p.i. CTCF was calculated for every 10 frames and plotted over time. MHV-FFL2 and MHV-2-FFL3-infected cells also showed a >3-log10 increase in FFL signal compared to viral titers. amplification trend for MHV-FFL2 luminescence mirrors replication. this suggests that replicase gene translation is occurring continuously. results suggest that it may be possible to uncouple measurements of genome translation and genome replication from measurements of infectious virus. enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (0.71 kb/26.8 kDa) or firefly luciferase (FFL) (1.65 kb/60.7 kDa) replaced the nsp2 coding sequence. all constructs were initially designed with PLP1-specific cleavage sites at the N and C termini of the reporter. cleavage site between nsp1 and the reporter but deleted the cleavage site between the reporter and the nsp2 amino terminus. both recombinant viruses were recovered, their sequences were confirmed, and they were passaged for >5 passages. these viruses are referred to as MHV-GFP2 and MHV-FFL2. all confirmed functional cleavages are indicated by gray arrowheads. MHV-2-GFP/FFL3, MHV with a deletion of nsp2 and fusion of GFP or FFL to nsp3; MHV-GFP/FFL2, MHV with the addition of GFP or FFL as a fusion to nsp2. a 210-kDa nsp3 protein was barely detectable following infection with MHV-2-FFL3 and not detected from cells infected with MHV-2-GFP3. anti-nsp3 antibodies detected a protein of 271 kDa in MHV-2-FFL3-infected cells and a protein of 237 kDa in MHV-2-GFP3-infected cells. this suggests that viable re DBT cells were infected with MHV, MHV-GFP2 (G2) and MHV-FFL2 (F2). radiolabeled proteins were harvested by immunoprecipitation and detected by fluorography. nsp2, GFP-nsp2, and FFL-nsp2 are indicated by white arrowheads. lysates detected a protein with a mobility differing slightly from that of anti-nsp2 but consistent with a fusion of nsp2-GFP. the results indicated that the recombinant viruses expressed the reporters as fusions with nsp3 or with nsp2. MHV-nsp2 replicated with a 1-log10 impairment in viral titers. MHV-CS2 replicated as previously reported, with delayed exponential replication but WT-like virus yield. MHV-2-GFP3 and MHV-2-FFL2 replicated as previously reported. the supernatant was sampled at the indicated times p.i. titers were determined by plaque assays. nsp2 and nsp3 reporter fusions were localized in virus-infected cells. DBT cells were infected with MHV-GFP2 alone or at a WT MHV/MHV-GFP2 ratio of 1:1, 1:10, or 10:1 at a combined MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell. we then compared GFP expression with the expression of the replicase protein nsp8 to determine the relative competitiveness of MHV-GFP2. coverslips were imaged and scored for nsp8 (red) and GFP (native green fluorescence) at all passages, WT MHV-infected cells exhibited only an nsp8 (red) signal, while MHV-GFP2-infected cells demonstrated colocalized nsp8 (red) and native GFP signals in all cells. MHV-GFP2 allows quantitation of replication complex formation in live cells. we tested whether reporter-nsp fusions could be used to track the quantity and movement of these proteins within a single cell over time. MHV-GFP2 and MHV-2-GFP3 quantitation of replication complex formation in live cells. DBT cells on glass-bottom culture dishes were infected with MHV-GFP2 at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. at 5 h p.i., dishes were transferred to a chamber incubator at 37\u00b0C, with imaging of DIC and GFP every 30 s for 2.5 h. both MHV-FFL2 and MHV-2-FFL3 replicated as expected. luciferase activity for MHV-FFL2 showed a signal >3 log10 higher than the corresponding titer at 4 h p.i. at 8 h p.i., measurements of luciferase activity and titers were very similar. MHV-FFL2 and MHV-2-FFL3 are quantitative measures of replication. cells were infected with MHV-2-FFL3 or MHV-2-FFL2 at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell in replicate wells. data are represented as means standard deviation of three replicates. nsp2 is dispensable for replication (26), altering expression by a deletion or cleavage site alteration impacts replication and fitness. a recent study of the evolution of the genomes of nidoviruses from the small arteriviruses to the largest coronaviruses (up to 32 kb) proposed that proto-CoVs emerged due to the incorporation of a cassette of proteins. the introduction of GFP as an nsp2 fusion results in a fitness cost during direct competition with MHV. it will be interesting to see if this fitness cost is similar for foreign genes. it will also be of interest to see whether foreign genes are retained over a long passage in the absence of competition. native expression of fluorescent reporters fused to replicase proteins creates the opportunity to track replication complex formation in real time in a single cell. the native expression of replicase proteins creates the opportunity to track replication complex formation in real time."}
