{"summary": "recent studies have shown that seabirds can be infected with blood parasites of the sub-genus Haemoproteus and Parahaemoproteus (genus Haemoproteus) the transmission cycle of these blood parasites involves hippoboscid flies (Hippoboscidae), where they reach an infective stage (sporozoite) in the salivary glands. great frigatebirds (Fregata minor), masked boobies (Sula dactylatra) and red-footed boobies (Sula sula) are the most abundant species of Suliformes in the Western Indian Ocean. the geographic distribution, hosts, vectors as well as prevalence in seabird populations remain to be assessed. masked boobies (800 pairs) and red-footed boobies (600 pairs) molecular detection was performed on blood samples collected from great frigatebirds, masked boobies and hippoboscid flies. hippoboscid flies are typically found infecting frigatebirds and boobies with evidence of strong host specificity. DNA was extracted using the DNEasy Blood and Tissue DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and eluted in a final volume of 40 L. origin and number of positive/collected samples for the presence of Haemoproteus and Plasmodium parasites. PCR were carried out in a BIO-RAD CFX96 Touch PCR system. partial Cytochrome Oxidase I encoding gene (698 bp) was amplified and sequenced to determine the putative species of nine Hippoboscid flies. Statistical analyses were performed with the R.3.0.0 [19] software. results and Discussion Of the 209 collected blood samples. 21 tested positive for the presence of Haemoproteus or Plasmodium parasites. haemoproteus sequences derived from this study were 100% identical to each other and had a perfect match to Haemoproteus iwa detected in frigatebirds in other geographic locations. this was based on a limited alignment (478 bp) we cannot determine whether or not the apparent low genetic diversity of this parasite resulted from the limited length of nucleotide sequences available in public database. a great frigatebird moved 4400 km from Europa to their roosting sites in Maldive Islands. more recent tracking studies have confirmed that both species disperse widely after breeding. one Lesser frigatebird tracked for about four months during the postbreeding migration. masked and red-footed boobies on Tromelin were heavily infested with hippoboscid flies. none of the collected samples tested positive for the presence of Haemoproteus iwa. the parasite is not prevalent on Tromelin. the exact placement of the Plasmodium on the phylogenetic tree could not be resolved. however, this result suggests that haemosporidian parasites other than Haemoproteus may be transmitted in seabird populations in the western Indian Ocean."}
