{"summary": "in humans, RVFV can cause acute fever leading to complications such as kidney failure and lethal hemorrhagic fever. in humans, RVFV spreads rapidly across infected herds of livestock and can cause significant mortality in infected animals. RVFV uses vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudovirions. the dependence of RVFV on GAGs for efficient infection was cell type dependent. heparan sulfate inhibited infection of HapI and SNB-19 cells. the following strains of RVFV were used in this study. MP-12, ZH-501, Kenya 9800523, and Kenya 2007002444. titers on vero E6 cells were determined by plaque assay. pCAGGS RVFV ZH-548 M cells were transfected with VSVG pseudovirions bearing VSV G. the glycoprotein gene was deleted from the viral genome and replaced with a reporter gene, either Renilla luciferase (VSVG-rLuc) or red fluorescent protein (VSVG-RFP) each cell line was seeded at a density of 1 104 cells per well in Greiner black well, clear-bottom 96-well plates. at 24 h after seeding the cells, the culture medium was removed and the cells were infected with viruses diluted in complete IMDM. the virus inocula were not washed off and the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C until approximately 18 to 20 h postinfection. st 33342 (nuclei) and HCS CellMask deep red stain (total cell) were diluted 1:10,000 in PBS. the fluorophores were illuminated using a 300-W xenon arc light source and excitation (EX) and emission (EM) filters. cells were pretreated for 1 h and kept in the presence of drug for the duration of the infection. heparin and heparan sulfate were preincubated with HSV-1 or MP-12 at 25\u00b0C for 1 h. infections were harvested at 8 to 10 h postinfection. infection assays were typically linear over at least a 2-log-unit range of virus dilutions. the virus inoculum was adjusted to achieve infection levels of between 1 and 30%. the cells were then washed four times with PBS, and total RNA was isolated from the cells using a minikit. Statistical significance was calculated using a two-tailed, one-sample t test. compared fold changes to hypothetical value of 1 in Prism software. derived mutant cell lines were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. studies using RVFV ZH-501 were conducted in a biosafety level 3 laboratory at USAMRIID. infections using the Kenyan RVFV strains and CCHFV were performed in a biosafety level 4 laboratory. the generation of PTAR1-deficient HapI cells was described before (14) fectamine 2000 reagent contains only the coding region of the M segment starting at the fourth ATG start codon. at between 16 and 20 h after transfection, cells were transduced with VSVG pseudovirions bearing VSV G. cells were carefully rinsed four times with warm phosphate-buffered saline containing calcium and magnesium. antibodies specific for RVFV N (R3-1D8) or CCHFV N (9D5-1-1A) were diluted 1:1,000 in blocking buffer. the cells were then counterstained with a solution of Hoechst 33342 (nuclei) and HCS CellMask deep red stain (total cell), each of which was diluted 1:10,000 in PBS. CS CellMask deep red (EX/EM) image segmentation and analysis were performed using Harmony (version 3.0) software and standard scripts. algorithms were used to first delineate nuclear and cell boundaries and then identify viral antigens by Alexa Fluor 568 staining. on average, 1,500 to 5,000 cells were analyzed per well. ate (10 and 100 g/ml; Iduron) were preincubated with HSV-1 or MP-12 at 25\u00b0C for 1 h. the virus and GAG solution was then allowed to adsorb onto cells for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were then rinsed 3 times with PBS containing calcium and magnesium. Primers specific to the MP-12 L segment were purchased from Invitrogen. a 6-carboxyfluorescein/MGB probe specific to the MP-12 L segment with the sequence 5\u2032-TGAGAATTCCTGAGACACATGG-3\u2032 was purchased from Applied Biosystems. genes significantly enriched (P 0.001) for insertions in the virus-resistant population were identified. genes encoding enzymes required for synthesis of glycosaminoglycans were also enriched in cells resistant to RVFV infection. gene for prenyltransferase alpha subunit repeat containing 1 (PTAR1) was previously shown to affect glycosylation (11), possibly by influencing vesicular trafficking through prenylation of Rab GTPases (14, 32). a screen performed for cell surface GAG expression (11) suggests a function for these genes in the presentation of glycans at the cell surface. reintroduction of the respective cDNAs completely restored sensitivity to virus infection. the observed resistance phenotype can be solely attributed to the gene-trapped loci. a synthesis of the tetrasaccharide linker was required for RVFV infection. the percentage of infected cells was normalized to the percentage of infected parental HapI cells. the requirement for GAGs for infection of cells in culture is a trait acquired during in vitro passaging, often leading to attenuation. infected hapI cells by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) decreased to levels close to background levels. heparan sulfate with heparinase also greatly attenuated MP-12 infection. B3GAT3GT and B4GALT7GT cells were infected with either Hantaan or Andes virus pseudovirions or replication-competent CCHFV. the percentage of infected cells was normalized to the percentage of wild-type cells rescued with each protein. RVFV uses at least one surfen-resistant cellular factor in vitro. the role of GAGs during MP-12 infection of different cell lines varies. surfen inhibited MP-12 infection in HEK 293T cells, a glioblastoma cell line. heparin and heparan sulfate inhibited infection of both RVFV and HSV-1 on HEK 293T, A549, HapI, and HeLa cells by at least 2-fold but not on Vero cells, an African green monkey cell line, or of C6/36 cells. similar results were obtained with dextran sulfate, whereas preincubation with chondroitin sulfate had only a very modest effect on preincubation of HSV-1 or RVFV (MP-12 strain) with either soluble heparin or heparan sulfate prior to infection of HEK 293T, A549, HapI, HeLa, Vero, or C6/36 cells. bars indicate SEMs (n = 3 for all cells except C6/36 cells, for which n = 2). we then infected the B3GAT3GT and B4GALT7GT cells with both RVFV and VSV pseudovirions that express red fluorescent protein (RFP) as with replication-competent RVFV, infection with RVFV pseudovirions required catalytically active GlcAT-I and GalT-I. in contrast, infection with pseudovirions bearing the VSV G protein was relatively unaffected. GT and B4GALT7GT cell panels, MP-12 binding strongly correlated with the presence of catalytically active GlcAT-I and GalT-I. the deficiency in RVFV infection in the absence of GAGs is due to a defect at the level of virion attachment. heparan sulfate deficiency could be corrected by complementation with wild-type PTAR1 cDNA. loss of PTAR1 renders cells resistant to RVFV infection and leads to decreased heparan sulfate levels on the cell surface. 108 hapI cells were mutagenized using a retroviral gene trap vector. surviving cells were expanded as a polyclonal cell population. gene trap insertion sites were sequenced and aligned to the human genome. meric Golgi (COG) complex (COG1, COG2, COG3, COG4, COG5, COG7, COG8) were identified from the screen. it is known that perturbation of the COG complex attenuates O-linked glycosylation by impairing Golgi complex function (29, 30) another hit encoded UNC50, a Golgi complex-resident transmembrane protein that plays a role in nicotinic the majority of genes identified in our screen pertained to GAG synthesis. we obtained single-cell clones of gene-trapped B3GAT3 (B3GAT3GT) and B4GALT7 (B4GALT7GT) these cells were markedly resistant to MP-12 infection. reintroduction of the respective cDNAs completely restored sensitivity to virus infection. expression of the B3GAT3 and B4GALT7 gene products is required for strain MP-12 infection. cells that stably express the empty vector (vector) or wild-type protein (rescue) were infected with MP-12. surviving cells were stained with crystal violet. infection was rescued by expression of the wild-type construct but not the enzymatically inactive constructs. the dependence of primary RVFV strains upon these enzymes indicates that the requirement of GAGs for viral infection is not due to cell culture adaption or attenuation. molecule surfen (5 M), heparinase I (3 U/ml), or dextran sulfate (50 g/ml) was normalized to the percentage of infected cells treated with the vehicle control. bars indicate SEMs (n = 3); *, P 0.005; **, P 0.0001; ns, no significant difference; n.t., not tested. new world (Andes virus) and Old World (Hantaan virus) hantaviruses (38, 39) are subdivided into new world (Andes virus) and Old World (Hantaan virus) pseudovirions required catalytically active GlcAT-I and GalT-I for efficient infection of HapI cells. CCHFV was reduced 2-fold when B3GAT3 or B4GALT7 were absent. we preincubated RVFV or HSV-1 with either heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, or dextran sulfate for 1 h prior to infection of a panel of cell lines. similar results were obtained with dextran sulfate, whereas preincubation with chondroitin sulfate had only a very modest effect on the four human cell lines. the percentage of infected cells was normalized to the percentage of infected cells in the dimethyl sulfoxide-treated group. bars indicate SEMs (n = 3 for all cells except C6/36 cells. RVFV pseudovirions were preincubated with antiserum against either RVFV or the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus. infection by RVFV pseudovirions but not those bearing the VSV G protein was inhibited in the presence of the RVFV antisera. infection was also sensitive to lysosomotropic agents. to measure RVFV virion binding, we used a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay that detects RVFV L gene copies. we first confirmed the linear range of our assay by diluting MP-12 on HapI cells and measuring relative MP-12 binding. we found that virus binding increased linearly with virus input over a 3-log-unit range. heparan sulfate deficiency attenuates heparan sulfate expression and confers resistance to RVFV infection. phenotype could be corrected by reintroduction of wild-type PTAR1 cDNA. the loss of heparan sulfate reduces the levels of heparan sulfate present on the cell surface. heparan sulfate greatly facilitates HSV-1 attachment and infection. a genome-wide RNA interference screen performed by Hopkins and colleagues did not identify glycosaminoglycans among their list of genes that impacted RVFV infection (52). we have shown that several perturbations of GAGs inhibited RVFV entry and attachment on some cell types, but the relative contribution of other RVFV entry factors remains unknown. s are approximately 10-fold more refractory to RVFV infection than their parental (wild-type) hapI cells. the importance of heparan sulfate and heparan sulfate for RVFV infection exhibited cell type dependence. this suggests these molecules serve as virus attachment factors that can enhance. cells deficient for PTAR1 displayed decreased levels of heparan sulfate at their cell surface. this is in accord with the observations obtained with previous genetic screens. additional experiments are needed to shed light on the mechanism of PTAR1-dependent RVFV infection."}
