{"summary": "human infection with one of these novel highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) viruses was first recognized during the 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong S.A.R. of China. since 2003, outbreaks of HPAI A(H5N1) have occurred among poultry in Asia, Europe and Africa. the consequences have worsened with 382 infected human cases and 241 deaths as of April, 2008. sensitivity of RT-LAMP is not stable due to rapid changes of A (H5N1) influenza virus genotypes. new primers may be applicable for all the clades and subclades of A(H5N1) influenza viruses based on the lower number of mismatches to the reference sequences. a total of 41 specimens, including throat swabs and tracheal aspirates, were collected from HPAI infection-suspected patients in 2007. seven patients were confirmed as A(H5N1) cases as reported by WHO. RNA was extracted from 140l of clinical specimens or virus ICF using a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) the extracted RNA was eluted in a total volume of 60l of elution buffer and stored at 70\u00b0C. the reaction mix was incubated at 62.5\u00b0C for 90 minutes in loopamp realtime turbidimeter LA-200 (Teramecs, Japan) positive and negative controls were included in each run. all precautions to prevent cross-contamination were observed. a 24-well plate for 1h at 37\u00b0C with 10-fold serial dilution of virus ICF. the cells were visualized after incubation at 37\u00b0C for three days. seven patients were confirmed as A(H5N1) cases as reported by WHO. RNA was extracted from 140l of clinical specimens or virus ICF using a QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) the extracted RNA was eluted in a total volume of 60l of elution buffer. polymerase (New England Bolabs), 0.625 U of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 5l of extracted RNA were incubated at 62.5\u00b0C for 90 minutes in loopamp realtime turbidimeter LA-200. positive and negative controls were included in each run, and all precautions to prevent cross-contamination were observed. the sensitivity of our RT-LAMP primers compared with the RT-PCR were the same (for seven strains) or 10 times lower (for two strains) on the other hand, the sensitivity of our RT-LAMP assay was 10 to 100 times higher (for four strains) or the same (for five strains) the specificity of the H5 RT-LAMP tests was checked by examining H5 viruses and other respiratory viruses including seasonal human influenza H3N2 and H1N1. all the positive samples were H5 virus strains, and this was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. the samples showed very clear ladder-like patterns on the gel, while no positive amplification was observed in other viruses. the positive samples whose detection time was around 20 minutes could be propagated in cell culture. sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay was the same (for seven strains) or 10 times lower (for two strains) compared with the NIID RT-LAMP primer set, the sensitivity of our RT-LAMP primers were the same (for four strains) or the same (for five strains) the specificity of the H5 RT-LAMP tests was checked by examining H5 viruses and other respiratory viruses including seasonal human influenza H3N2 and H1N1. all the positive samples were H5 virus strains, and this was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. samples by RT-LAMP showed the ladder-like pattern in electrophoresis analysis. confirmed as positive by real-time RT-PCR. RT-PCR WHO primers positive 16 16 Negative 25 24 Un-clear 0 1* Total 41 41. the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay is not consistant among the strains of A(H5N1) virus. the experimental results for nine Vietnamese strains of A(H5N1) influenza viruses showed a comparable sensitivity to that of the WHO recommended RT-PCR assay. the alignment showing the very limited number of mismatches between the two sets of primer and the clades of A(H5N1) influenza viruses. two strains that showed lower sensitivity by our RT-LAMP method belonged to that group. this suggests that the genotypes of circulating A(H5N1) influenza viruses have changed and that the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP method was reduced."}
