{"summary": "the characterization of cellular genes required for virus infection and/or cell killing will be essential for understanding viral life cycles. four of the 111 genes disrupted in clones selected for resistance to infection by reovirus type 1 involved the insulin growth factor-2 pathway. host cell contributions to the virus life cycle, although complex, have genetic determinants. a gene trap retrovirus was used to create libraries of rat intestinal epithelial (RIE-1) cell clones in which each clone contained a single gene disrupted by an integrated retrovirus. the mutant libraries were then infected with reovirus, and resistant clones were selected. the frequency of mutations involving the IGF-II pathway led us to investigate the role of IGF-II in reovirus infection. the results represent the first use of gene entrapment to identify components of host cell metabolism required for virus infection. RIE-1 cells were mutagenized by using the U3NeoSV1 gene trap shuttle vector [16] to select for clones resistant to lytic infection. isolated clones did not express reoviral antigens, suggesting these reovirus resistant clones were not PI. the position of the provirus (clone 6B72) in the first intron of the Ctcf gene is shown in Figure 2. CTCF differentially represses maternal Igf2 gene expression. the imprinted paternal gene escapes repression due to methylation of CTCF binding sites. two products were amplified from 6B72 cells by RT-PCR. the first product was identical to the rat IGF-II pro-hormone (pro-IGF-II) coding sequence. the second contained 14 additional nucleotides generated by splicing of exon 2 to an alternative splice acceptor located 14 nucleotides upstream of the normal Igf2 exon 3 splice acceptor site. a new tab Alternatively spliced product contains a single nucleotide polymorphism in the igf2 coding sequence. the alternatively spliced transcript alters the translational reading frame of the pro-homone downstream of the coding sequence of the processed IGF-II protein. resistance to reovirus lytic infection results from increased Igf2 expression. clones of RIE-1 cells over-expressing the full-length Igf2 transcript or the splice variant (Igf2sv) were generated and examined for their capacity to resist reovirus infection. expression of the Igf2 gene in an anti-sense orientation caused no significant difference in the capacity of 6B72 cells to survive infection. however, when the Igf2svwas transfected into 6B72 cells, the ability of 6B72 cells to survive infection Igf2sv PCR product also contained a single nucleotide substitution (G1393A) that results in the substitution of a threonine for alanine at position 62 of IGF-II. vectors expressing only the 68-residue IGF-II protein both with and without the A62T change were compared for their ability to confer resistance to lytic infection by reovirus type 1. the native IGF-II (small arrow) is slightly larger than the cDNA constructs. over expression of igf2 confers resistance to other reovirus sertotypes RIE-1 cells are intrinsically resistant to infection by reovirus type 3. cells were visualized at 4 (A) or 5 days (B) following infection with gentian violet. transgene expression was determined by northern blot (C) experiments were repeated three times and a representative experiment is shown. 6B72 cells have delayed disassembly of reovirus type 1. persistent fluorescence at 2 hours was found in 6B72 cells. non-replicating reovirus type 1 at 3 104 particles per cell was absorbed. RIE-1 cells expressing native IGF-II protein without the E-peptide grew in soft agar but the colonies were smaller (d) than produced by pro-IGF-2 (a), while the corresponding IGF-IIA62T protein (E-peptide) did not transform RIE-1 cells to anchorage independence (d) clones with disrupted Igfr or Prss11 genes did not form colonies in soft agar. an additional reovirus resistant-clone with an insert in the Anxa2 gene, associated with cytomegalovirus infection, also failed to grow in soft agar. however, the capacity to proliferate in soft agar was not a general property of reovirus-resistant cells. RIE-1 cells were mutagenized with reovirus serotype 1/Lang at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 35, to select for clones resistant to lytic infection. isolated clones did not express reoviral antigens, suggesting these reovirus resistant clones were not PI. the library included 4 independent mutations involving three genes that encoded proteins associated with the insulin growth factor-2 (IGF-II) signalling pathway. the position of the provirus (clone 6B72) in the first intron of the Ctcf gene is shown in Figure 2. CTCF differentially represses maternal Igf2 gene expression. the imprinted paternal gene escapes repression due to methylation of CTCF binding sites. CTCF expression was associated with an increase in Igf2 transcripts. two products were amplified from 6B72 cells by RT-PCR. levels of Igf2 transcripts were assessed by western blot analysis. spliced transcript (Igf2sv) generated by splicing of exon 2 to a cryptic 3' splice site located 14 nucleotides upstream of exon 3. the alternatively spliced transcript (highlighted in black) alter the translational reading frame of the pro-homone downstream of the coding sequence of the processed IGF-II protein (italics and bold) pro-IGF-II converted RIE-I cells to a reovirus resistant phenotype (RIE-1/proIGF2) but had little if any effect on already-resistant 6B72 cells (6B72/proIGF2) clones of RIE-1 cells over-expressing the full-length Igf2 transcript or the splice variant (Igf2sv) were generated and examined for their capacity to resist reovirus infection. the IGF-II hormone confers resistance to lytic infection Igf2 transcripts encode a pro-hormone of 180 amino acids that is processed to generate the 67-residue IGF-II protein [19]. other proteolytic products including the 89-residue carboxy-terminal E peptide may also be biologically active [20]. carboxyl terminal extension-peptide (E-peptide) were challenged with serial dilutions of reovirus type 1. native IGF-II protected RIE-1 cells from reovirus infection. non-infected RIE-1 cells (C) and infected 6B72, and RIE-1 cells were included as controls. 105 L-cells or L-cells expressing the pro-IGF2 transgene are indicated for each virus serotype. the multiplicity of infectious virus particles per cell (MOI) is indicated for each virus serotype. transgene expression was determined by northern blot (C) 6B72 cells have delayed disassembly of reovirus type 1. reovirus type 1 was absorbed to RIE-1 (A) or 6B72 cells (B) persistent fluorescence at 2 hours was found in 6B72 cells, but not RIE-1 cells. RIE-1 cells expressing native IGF-II protein without the E-peptide grew in soft agar but the colonies were smaller (d) than produced by pro-IGF-2 (a), while the corresponding IGF-IIA62T protein (E-peptide) did not transform RIE-1 cells to anchorage independence. cell clones with disrupted Igfr or Prss11 genes did not form colonies in soft agar. an additional reovirus resistant-clone with an insert in the Anxa2 gene, associated with cytomegalovirus infection, also failed to grow in soft agar. 3 other clones selected for reovirus resistance contained mutations in the IGF-II pathway. reduced expression of the Ctcf gene was associated with enhanced Igf2 expression in virus-resistant cells. forced expression of the Igf2 gene in the parental RIE-1 line was sufficient to confer resistance to lytic reovirus infection. by inference, the recovery of inserts affecting other genes may affect the same phenotype by acting on a common pathway. reovirus replication was enhanced by treatment of RIE-1 cells with insulin. expression of the Igf2 gene is frequently elevated in childhood and adult neoplasms. plasmids expressing only IGF-II were less active in transforming RIE-1 cells to anchorage-independence. 6B72 cells were highly resistant to reovirus infection as determined by virus yield and cell survival at different times post-infection. decreased virus disassembly is sufficient to explain virus resistance, but we do not exclude the possibility that other mechanisms may contribute to the resistance of 6B72 cells. IGF-II expression specifically blocked virus disassembly and forced Igf2 expression enabled cells to proliferate in soft agar. these results illustrate a potential indirect mechanism of viral carcinogenesis by which cells selected to virus resistance may also have enhanced oncogenic potential. cells were incubated for several days until only a few cells remained attached to the culture flask. reovirus stocks and infectivity assays Reovirus type 1 (Lang) and reovirus type 3 (Dearing) were previously described. images were captured with a low-light, cooled CCD camera. results were compared to databases available in the public domain (BLAST nr, est, and hgts) Igf2 cDNA isolation and expression Rat Igf2 cDNAs were obtained using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) total RNA was extracted from RIE and 6B72 cells using Trizole reagent.
