{"summary": "coV infects a large range of birds and mammals, including humans. coV generally cause respiratory and/or intestinal infections, although some may spread systemically. in spring 2003, a new human CoV became infamously notorious due to an outbreak in south east Asia and Canada. coV virions are spherical enveloped particles, with a diameter of 70\u2013120 nm [20] all coV particles contain a common set of 4 structural proteins. the spike (S), the membrane (M) and the envelope (E) transmembrane proteins, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. the large genomic RNA is encapsidated by multiple copies of the N protein forming the helical nucleocapsi double membrane vesicles (DMVs) are often found clustered together in close proximity of a small network of membranes, the CMs, which are morphologically distinct but have identical viral protein composition. the asterisks mark the DMVs, which are often found clustered together in close proximity of a small network of membranes, the CMs. structural proteins are synthesized from subgenomic RNAs. the ones with transmembrane segments are subsequently inserted in the limiting membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. the S protein localizes predominantly in the Golgi compartments while the E protein is detected in the ER, in the Golgi, and in the ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) nsp3 and nsp4, two nonstructural proteins with transmembrane segments, become N-glycosylated [48\u201351], a co-translational modification that occurs in the ER. nsp4 localizes to the ER when ectopically expressed and moves to the DMVs upon viral infection. the ER is the site of maturation for secretory and membrane proteins in eukaryotic cells. proteins that fail to attain the native structure must be removed from the ER lumen to protect cells from stress conditions eventually leading to cell death. the intraluminal concentration of ERAD factors must be tightly regulated. ERManI [56,57], EDEM1 [45,58,59], OS-9 [45], HERP [61,62] and SEL1L [63] are in fact rapidly removed from the ER lumen in unstressed cells. some of them are degraded by the proteasome; others, such as the ERManI [56,57], EDEM1 [45,58,59] and OS-9 [45] are degraded by endo-ly these results led us to propose an unconventional, autophagy-independent use of LC3 for the vesicle-mediated removal of short-living chaperones from the ER lumen. a non-lipidable form of LC3 associates with the MHV-induced DMVs in MHV-infected cells. covalent association of LC3 to the autophagosomal membranes is dispensable for infection. reduction of intracellular levels of LC3 by siRNA effectively interferes with MHV replication. MHV infection is restored further supporting the notion of an unconventional use of LC3 in coV replication. the role of LC3-I in the formation of both EDEMosomes and CoV-induced DMVs remains unknown. one speculative idea is that LC3-I acts as a vesicle coat protein. this latter step would be the key event required for the formation of a carrier vesicle. coV may sequester EDEMosome cargo proteins such as EDEM1 and OS-9 into the DMVs in order to weaken the ERAD capacity in the ER lumen of the host cell. LC3 could also play a role in ERAD tuning and/or viral replication by linking EDEMosomes and the CoV-induced DMVs to the microtubule network. depletion of LC3 or antibodies against the N-terminus of LC3 blocks subcellular redistribution of autophagosomes after completion. MHV replicative structures, when visualized by using a GFP-tagged version of nsp2, remain dispersed throughout the cytoplasm and fail to concentrate to the perinuclear region. perspectives Viruses are dependent on the host cell for virtually every step of the infection cycle. they can also be regarded as unique tools in cell biology research. studying coV replication and the biogenesis of the coronaviral replicative structures is expected to increase our knowledge."}
