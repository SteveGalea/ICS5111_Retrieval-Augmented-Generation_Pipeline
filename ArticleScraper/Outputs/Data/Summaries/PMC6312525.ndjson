{"summary": "a large phage-displayed VNAR single-domain antibody library from six nurse sharks. the library provides an alternative platform for selecting therapeutic antibodies for treating cancer and other human diseases. the shark VNAR domain is an Ig superfamily domain with two sheets held together by two canonical cysteine residues in framework regions (FRs) 1 and 3. complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) can have one or two additional cysteines forming additional disulfide bonds within the V domain. type III is similar to Type II except there is a highly conserved tryptophan residue in CDR1 positioned adjacent to the disulfide bond. type IV has no non-canonical disulfide bonds as found in other three VNAR types. shark VNAR domain antibodies have structural advantages and are easily expressed in Escherichia coli systems. in one study, two shark VNAR libraries with a size of 107 clones were constructed from both nave spiny dogfish and smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis) sharks. a nurse shark VNAR phage library was constructed using a method called EASeL. a large shark VNAR library was constructed using a phage panning method. the binders included antigens associated with liver and breast cancers. 1.2 million full-length VNAR sequences with in-frame translation were used for further analysis. this is the largest scale shark VNAR sequence analysis reported thus far. the presence of two canonical cysteines located at both amino acid 21 and 82 are used as a key criterion to characterize Type I\u2013IV VNARs. about 11% of the total VNARs are classical Type I. 85% of the 1.2 million sequences only appeared once in NGS results. only 1% of the 1.2 million sequences appeared more than 10 times. HV2 sequence was identified as \u201cCDR2\u201d in the IMGT database. Flow chart of the criteria used to categorize the VNAR types for 1.2 million validated full-length shark VNAR sequences. the separate analysis of Type I and Type II/III VNARs showed Type I VNARs have more total cysteines and in CDR3 than Type II/III (shown as red lines) the CDR3 lengths for Type I VNARs are also slightly longer compared to Type II/III (Fig. 4C) lypican-3 (GPC3), HER2 and PD1, the spike proteins of the MERS and SARS viruses, and Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE38) binders were assigned the following names based on their targets and well numbers. only one binder was isolated for all antigens, except MERS spike protein. the elution profile showed the protein elution in Figure 7A and D. sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) showed the later peak eluted by higher imidazole concentrations had over 90% purity of the target soluble VNARs. the type I binder (MERS A8) had higher signals. nM, 48.8 nM, 12.2 nM, 3.06 nM, 0.76 nM, and 0.19 nM. the representative data were shown for PE38-B6 concentration 3.06 nM. the Kd, kon, koff, and koff standard error was summarized in this table. our shark library size (1.2 1010) was determined by titration based on the number of individual TG1 bacteria colonies on agar plates. this high-efficiency method is a significant improvement over conventional phage library construction method. type IV VNARs contain only two canonical cysteines found at position 21 and 82. the sequences that have both 21C and 82C (n = 19 494) are further categorized based on their placement of additional cysteines. about 11% of the total VNARs are classical Type I. sequences of Type I\u2013IV shark VNARs with different numbers of cysteines were randomly picked from NGS data. the FRs and CDR1, CDR3, HV2, and HV4 are marked based on Stanfield et al. [11] and Fennell et al. [13] in Figure 3. we analyzed the total number of cysteines, the number of cysteines found in CDR3, the length of CDR3 and the amino acid sequence variability. the total cysteines in VNAR sequences can vary from 0 to 11 (Fig. 4A) and the CDR3 can have 0\u20136 cysteines (Fig. 4B) the total cysteines in VNAR sequences can vary greatly as well, and it can be between 0\u201340 amino acids according to the NGS a variety of human tumor biomarkers and virus antigen proteins were selected as selection targets. the binders were assigned the following names based on their targets and well numbers. only one binder was isolated for all antigens except MERS spike protein. the affinity is high as a monomeric single-domain soluble protein isolated from a nave shark library without immunization. we also produced the Type I binder (MERS A8) and Type II binder MERS A7 in E. coli. monoclonal phage ELISA was carried out to identify the binders to gPC3, Her2, PD1, MERS S-protein, SARS S-protein, PE38. a random phage that had no binding to all tested antigens was used as irrelevant control in the phage ELISA. TSK size exclusion column purification of type II shark binder PE38-B6-his soluble protein. using this method, we successfully constructed a large phage-displayed VNAR library with a size of 1010 from six antigen-nave nurse sharks. several methods have been employed to make antibody phage display libraries. most widely used methods consist of PCR amplification of antibody fragments followed by enzymatic digestion and ligation with the vector. this method is time consuming and has a low efficiency in the ligation and transformation step. a standard ligation at 16\u00b0C for 12\u201324 h. the two ends of the DNA are blunt and do not need to be identical for blunt-end ligation. the terminal part of the DNA fragment sequence can be varied. the sequences for cysteine number and CDR3 length are not classical VNAR as defined in the known four types. the extra cysteines in both Type I and Type II VNARs are important for stabilizing the antigen-binding regions. large nave shark library has a suitable size and diversity for antibody discovery. the potential immunogenicity of shark antibodies could be a concern in clinical applications. the potential immunogenicity of shark antibodies could be a concern in clinical applications. the recombinant GPC3 peptide (a.a. 510\u2013560) was synthesized. the recombinant extracellular domain of Her2 and PD1, the S-protein of MERS and SRS were purchased from Sino Biological. primer pairs of IgNAR-F/IgNAR-R1 were used to amplify the VNAR fragment in a 50 l of PCR volume that contains 1 l of cDNA product. initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 3 min, 40 cycles of denaturation at 98\u00b0C for 10 s, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 15 s, and elongation at 72\u00b0C for 45 s using PrimeStar (Cl PCR products were primed by IgNAR-F/IgNARCom3x-R using PrimeStar. 20 micrograms of the assembled PCR product were circularized by intra-molecular self-ligation in a 1 ml of ligation buffer using T4 DNA ligase. ligation products were cleaned up by removing enzymes and transformed into 500 l of electroporation competent TG1 cells. more than 1 million unique VNAR sequences from this experiment. we aligned all VNAR sequences by anchoring the constant regions. we then calculated the variability according to methods described in Wu and Kabat [43] the antigenic proteins were used to coat a 96 well plate at 5 g/ml in PBS buffer, 50 l/well, at 4\u00b0C overnight. the irrelevant antigen used was 5 g/ml BSA in PBS. 25 l pre-blocked phage supernatant (typically 1010\u20131011 cfu) were added per well for 1 h at room temperature to allow binding. the supernatant was harvested after lysis and purified using hisTrap column (GE Healthcare) using AKTA. the binding kinetics of PE38-B6-His was measured with ForteBio Octet RED96. the recombinant GPC3 peptide (a.a. 510\u2013560) was synthesized. the recombinant extracellular domain of Her2 and PD1, the S-protein of MERS and SRS were purchased from Sino Biological. primer pairs of IgNAR-F/IgNAR-R1 were used to amplify the VNAR fragment in a 50 l of PCR volume that contains 1 l of cDNA product. the linear vector backbone fragment was prepared by PCR using forward primer IgNARCom3x-F: AGTGGCCAGGCCGGCCACC. 20 micrograms of the assembled PCR product were circularized by intra-molecular self-ligation in a 1 ml of ligation buffer using T4 DNA ligase. the ligation products were cleaned up by removing the enzymes and transformed into 500 l of electroporation competent TG1 cells. we aligned all VNAR sequences by anchoring the constant regions. we then calculated the variability according to methods described in Wu and Kabat [43] the antigenic proteins were used to coat a 96 well plate at 5 g/ml in PBS buffer, 50 l/well, at 4\u00b0C overnight. after the plate was blocked with 2% BSA in PBS buffer, 25 l pre-blocked phage supernatant were added per well for 1 h. the supernatant was harvested after lysis and purified using hisTrap column (GE Healthcare) using AKTA. the binding kinetics of PE38-B6-His was measured with ForteBio Octet RED96."}
