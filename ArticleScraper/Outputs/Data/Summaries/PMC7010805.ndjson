{"summary": "temperate phages can be classified as virulent and temperate phages. phages incorporate their genomes into a host chromosome and replicate with it without lysing their host cells. temperate phages are considered as natural vectors for gene transmission among bacteria. temperate staphylococcal phage 80 could efficiently encapsidate and transfer bacterial pathogenicity island, SaPI1 to a recipient strain. however, the roles of temperate phages in attenuation of bacterial virulence are largely unknown. we have been working on isolation and characterization of B. bronchiseptica phages since we reported the use of phages to treat B. bronchiseptica infection. a temperate phage, PHB09, has a specific integration site in the host genome, was found from our B. bronchiseptica phage collections. Escherichia coli DH5 and two Pasteurella multocida strains were used to determine host specificity of phage PHB09. all bacterial strains are available from the State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, Huazhong Agricultural University, China. phages were placed on carbon-coated grids, washed gently with distilled water, and stained with 2% uranyl acetate. genome sequence was searched against protein and nucleotide databases using local alignment search tool (BLAST) protein BLAST (BLASTP) was used to identify proteins sharing similarities with predicted phage proteins. tRNA genes were predicted using tRNAscan-SE (Lowe and Chan, 2016; Chan and Lowe, 2019). six milliliters soft TSA (0.75% agar) containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added to the mixture and then poured onto a prepared TSA plate. every colony was examined for the sensitivity against phage PHB09. samples were collected every 2 h, and titers were determined by plating serial dilutions of cell lysates. hep-2 cells were seeded in six-well plates at the density of 106 cells per well. hep-2 cells were seeded in six-well plates at the density of 106 cells per well. cells were cultured in a six-well plate with RPMI 1640 medium (HyClone, USA) cells were washed three times with PBS before adding exponential-phase Bb01 or Bb01+ cells at a ratio of 10:1 (B. bronchiseptica to RAW264.7) the cells were then lysed with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 after three times washing with PBS. fourteen antimicrobials, ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, tiamulin, tilmicosin, ciprofloxacin, ceftiofur sodium, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, tetracycline, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and polymyxin B were tested in our current study. mice were immunized intranasally with 20 l PBS containing 1.5 108 CFU B. bronchiseptica Bb01+ on day 0, while mice in group I were immunized with 20 l PBS and used as controls. survival mice were sacrificed 8 days after challenge for histopathologic analyses of lung and trachea tissues. ibrinated sheep blood was cultured in TSB/TSA medium at 37\u00b0C. all bacterial strains are available from the state key laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, Huazhong Agricultural University, china. phages were placed on carbon-coated grids, stained with 2% uranyl acetate. the stained phages were observed under a 100-kV transmission electron microscope. genome sequence was searched against protein and nucleotide databases. 300 l of the exponential-phase culture of each strain was mixed with 6 ml of molten soft TSA (0.75% agar) individually and plated into prepared TSA plates. five microliters of SM buffer (0.1 M NaCl, 8 mM MgSO4, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH7.4], and 0.1% gelatin) containing 5 105 PFU phages was spread on top of the soft agar. phage genes, integrase (ORF1), cI (ORF14), large terminase subunit (ORF31) were determined by PCR with two sets of primers. a single colony of phage PHB09 lysogenized strain, Bb01+, and the parental strain, Bb01, was individually picked up and inoculated into a 15 ml tube containing 5 ml TSB medium supplemented with 10% thelial type 2 cells were used to analyze the adhesion and invasion ability of strains, Bb01 and Bb01+. cells were seeded in six-well plates at the density of 106 cells per well. the plates were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C in 5% (v/v) CO2 incubator. for adhesion assays, the culture supernatant was removed after 2 h incubation. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min in a 5% (v/v) CO2 incubator. cells were then lysed with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 after three times washing with PBS. bacterial counts were determined by plating serial dilutions of cell lysates. the minimum lethal dose of the B. bronchiseptica Bb01 was determined using three groups of 5-week-old female BALB/c mice (n = 3) mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of xylazine (0.25 mg) and ketamine (1.25 mg) mice were then inoculated intranasally with 20 l PBS containing 2-fold serial dilutions of B. bronchiseptica Bb01 a phage vB_BbrS_PHB09 (PHB09) was isolated using B. bronchiseptica strain Bb01 as a host. the initial characterization of morphology by transmission electron microscopy showed that phage PHB09 had an isometric polyhedral head and a long flexible tail. the phage PHB09 genome was sequenced, and the large terminase subunit (ORF31) was used to generate integrase of Pseudomonas phage phiAH14a was found in the lysogeny module. no antibiotic resistance genes were found in phage the PHB09 genome. the lysogeny related gene, cI, was also identified. 119 strains of B. bronchiseptica isolated between 2016 and 2018 were tested using a double-layer agar method. the propagation efficiency of PHB09 in strains was different, with >106 PFU/ml of progeny phages obtained within 80 strains. we found that 13 of 30 strains contain prophage PHB09 using PCR. this was further confirmed by second-generation sequencing of 3 randomly selected B. bronchiseptica strains. all the three sequenced genomes had a unique integration site of phage PHB09, which is a 14-bp sequence. the growth rate of the parental strain, Bb01, and the lysogenic strain, Bb01+, in TSB medium containing serum was similar to the lysogenic strain. the integration of phage PHB09 did not significantly affect the proliferation of the B. bronchiseptica. the same amount of Bb01 and Bb01+ cells were incubated with HEp-2 cells at 37\u00b0C for 2 h (D) or 4 h (E) respectively. the same amount of Bb01 and Bb01+ cells were incubated with HEp-2 cells at 37\u00b0C for 2 h (D) or 4 h (E) respectively. the titer of Bb01+ was significantly lower than that of Bb01 after 2 h incubation with RAW264.7 cells at 37\u00b0C (P 0.05) the integration of phage PHB09 decreased the anti-phagocytic ability of B. bronchiseptica. three groups of mice were intranasally inoculated with Bb01, Bb01+, and PBS respectively. survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier analysis with a log-rank test. infection of B. bronchiseptica Bb01+ caused only minor pathological changes both in tracheae and lungs. the tracheal mucosa was relatively intact, which was similar to observed in PBS group. the inherent structure of the lungs was intact, and the alveolar walls were slightly thicker with capillary congestion and neutrophil infiltration compared to the PBS control group. phage PHB09 lysogenized B. bronchiseptica strain protects mice against lethal challenges with B. bronchiseptica Bb01+. two groups of BALB/c mice were intranasally immunized with Bb01+ and PBS, respectively, and challenged with B. bronchiseptica strain Bb01 on day 14. the entire genome contains four functional modules, structure/assembly module, replication module, transcription regulators, and lysis/lysogeny module. the replication module contains homologs to known proteins, such as HNH homing endonuclease and methyltransferase. no antibiotic resistance genes were found in phage the PHB09 genome. 119 strains of B. bronchiseptica isolated between 2016 and 2018 were tested using a double-layer agar method. the propagation efficiency of PHB09 in strains was different, with >106 PFU/ml of progeny phages were obtained within 80 strains. phage PHB09 is a temperate phage based on genome data. it is possible that these strains might contain prophage PHB09. this makes them resistant against phage PHB09 infection. the integration of phage PHB09 reduces the virulence of B. bronchiseptica in vitro. the integration of phage PHB09 reduces the virulence of B. bronchiseptica in vitro. the integration of phage PHB09 reduces the virulence of B. bronchiseptica in vitro. specific integration of phage PHB09 significantly increased the virulence of B. bronchiseptica strains Bb01 and Bb01+ in vitro. the same amount of Bb01 and Bb01+ cells were incubated with HEp-2 cells at 37\u00b0C for 2 h (D) or 4 h (E respectively. the titer of Bb01+ was significantly lower than that of its parent strain, Bb01 (P 0.01). we then employed RAW264.7 cells, a commonly used macrophage cell line, to evaluate the anti-phagocytic ability of strains Bb01 and Bb01+. the integration of phage PHB09 decreased the anti-phagocytic ability of B. bronchiseptica in vivo. 27 mice were divided into three groups (n = 9) and inoculated with Bb01, Bb01+, and PBS respectively. however, there were only 5 mice survived in Bb01 challenged group on day 3. the rest mice were monitored daily for mortality. the bronchus in the necrotic foci was filled with exfoliated mucosal epithelial cells and inflammatory cells. the surrounding alveolar cavity was filled with necrotic tissue cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and blue-stained bacterial colonies. infection of B. bronchiseptica Bb01+ caused only minor pathological changes both in tracheae and lungs. all mice in the control group, which was inoculated with PBS before challenge, died within 3 days post-challenge. the survival mice were sacrificed on 22-day post immunization (DPI) for histopathological analysis of lung and trachea. no significant histopathological changes were observed in both lung and trachea. temperate phages can increase the virulence of the host bacteria by transmitting virulence genes. lysogeny of phage PHB09 significantly decreased the virulence of parental strain B. bronchiseptica Bb01 in vitro and in vivo. pilin proteins form hair-like pili, which are found on the surfaces of bacteria, usually, are responsible for the adhesion to the host cells. many studies have identified pilin proteins as virulent factors of pathogenic bacteria, such as E. coli (Soto and Hultgren, 1999) and Vibrio cholera (Utada et al., 2014). prophages can switch to the lytic life cycle, in which the prophage DNA is excised from the host genome. however, curing of prophages from host bacteria was reported in some bacteria. however, there is little chance for B. bronchiseptica Bb01+ to reverse to the virulent state by release of prophage PHB09. all animal experiments were performed according to the protocols approved by the Laboratory Animal Monitoring Committee of Huazhong Agricultural University, China. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
