{"summary": "there has been mounting interest in the increasing number of viruses causing unexpected illness and epidemics among humans, wildlife and livestock. the key message is that these are representative of constantly evolving infections responding to rapid changes in the relationship between pathogen and host. emerging or re-emerging pathogens are far more likely to be zoonotic. emergence of viruses can be considered as progressing through four key stages, although the boundaries are often indistinct. this process has been described as a pathogen pyramid by Woolhouse and colleagues:3 adaptation. the rate by which viruses move through these stages inevitably declines as environmental barriers become less favorable. increased temperatures and seasonal fluctuations favor the spread of vector-borne diseases to higher elevations and to more temperate latitudes. the relentless change inflicted by humans on habitats in the name of progress has also had a marked effect on rodent habitats. this pattern of severe oscillations of rain and drought markedly affect murine species and insect vector numbers. similar pattern occurred in 1994 when in Venezuela an outbreak of what originally thought was due to dengue virus was in fact another example of the emergence of a novel arenavirus. murine rodents have thrived, especially in periurban areas. over 100 million passenger journeys by air are made every year. it is feasible to visit as many as three continents in a few hours. this is in marked contrast to just 50 years ago when many people rarely traveled any distance from their place of residence. air travel represents less than 0.2% of all passenger kilometers traveled. around 80 000 wild-caught animals are air freighted each year. the incursion of west Nile virus into north America is an excellent example of a virus expanding into an ecological niche. a sudden reversal in sea temperature in the summer of 1995 resulted in heavy rainfalls, especially in Columbia, resulting in resurgence of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and equine encephalitis. even a small extension of a transmission season may have a disproportionate affect as transmission rates rise exponentially rather than linearly as the season progresses. a prolonged drought in the early 1990s in the four Corners region of the united states led to a sharp decline in the numbers of rodent predators, such as coyotes, snakes and birds of prey. at the end of the drought, heavy rainfall resulted in an explosion in pion nuts and grasshopper populations, which in turn resulted in a rapid escalation of rodent numbers, among them deer mice carrying hantaviruses. deforestation has accelerated exponentially since the beginning of the twentieth century. in the amazonian basin and parts of Southeast Asia has had a profound effect on local ecosystems. reduction in biological diversity can trigger the invasion and spread of opportunistic species. were a vaccine available, the initial spread of virus might be contained if only a third of the population were immunized in the regions where the outbreak is focused. this assumes an index case made a single air journey. however, this increases substantially to 75% in the event of an index case making two journeys. the advent of agriculture 10 000 years ago was pivotal in giving rise to many of the infections we know today. it is widely thought that measles emerged at this time, probably from rinderpest in cattle and diverged into an exclusively human pathogen as human centers of population grew to a level where an animal reservoir was no longer necessary. arenaviruses are found mainly within two rodent families, the Muridae and Cricetidae (e.g. field voles, lemmings, gerbils) the natural reservoirs of the Old World arenaviruses are members of the genera Mastomys and Praomys. the chance of virus switching into other rodent species also becomes a greater possibility as rodent territories expand and overlap. switching to a new rodent host can stimulate the development of new virus phenotypes and hence expansion into new ecological niches. bats have long since been known as the principal hosts of lyssaviruses. the link between genetic variability and spatial epidemiology among the lyssaviruses gives a particularly good insight as to how viruses of wildlife can adapt and emerge into different animal populations. fruit-eating bats are found throughout southern Europe, as far south as south africa, and as far east as Japan. many bats travel long distances for food, especially fruit-eating species who respond to ever varying supply of food. some species will forage over a distance of 30 miles in a single night. pigs have been implicated in several outbreaks of emerging infections. the most extensive outbreak was in the village of Sungai Nipah near the city of Bukit Polandok. a total of 265 cases were notified, with mortality approaching 40%. pigs become infected around 3 months of age but suffer only a mild, transient infection. the worldwide distribution of infected pigs means there is ample opportunity for transmission. pigs are susceptible to human, avian and swine influenza viruses. the properties of swine influenza differ from region to region. swine influenza is one of the comparatively few viral respiratory pathogens of pigs. the ancestors of this virus had probably been circulating in pig populations for over 10 years but had remained undetected. at the time, there was considerable uncertainty as to the pathogenic potential of this virus but data soon showed the severity for humans to be less than that seen with the 1918 pandemic but on a par with the 1957 \u201cHong Kong\u201d pandemic. ine flavivirus, burbelo et al.35 have recently found a related virus in eight of 36 seropositive horses belonging to owners in the state of new york. any persistence of the newly described virus appears to be much lower than the average 50% seen in humans infected with HCV. studies indicate that HCV most likely originated from animal species, as is the case with hepatitis B and other causes of viral hepatitis. the keeping of prairie dogs is common in the united states. it led in 2003 to an outbreak of monkey pox in the state of Wisconsin. it was the result of housing prairie dogs intended for sale in close proximity to small rodents imported from the african continent. field voles can have over 15 broods per year, each with an average of six pups. this increases the risk of human exposure to any pathogens they may carry. the preeminent property of the arenaviruses is the establishment of a long-term infection in their principle murine reservoir. this is best exemplified by the emergence of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the four Corners region of the united states in 1993. this is best exemplified by the emergence of Sin Nombre virus in the four Corners region of the united states. this is best exemplified by the emergence of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. bats have long been known as the principal hosts of lyssaviruses. the link between genetic variability and spatial epidemiology among the lyssaviruses gives a particularly good insight as to how viruses of wildlife can adapt and emerge into different animal populations. bats are found in most terrestrial habitats, with species distribution varying widely, some being restricted to a single island, others being found across continents. many bats travel long distances for food, especially fruit-eating species who respond to ever varying supply of food and who must compete with birds and other animals. despite being fruit-eaters, these bats form roosts deep within caves. marburg virus sequences have been found in wild-caught Rhinolophus eloquens and miniopterus inflatus. pigs become infected around 3 months of age but suffer only a mild, transient infection. the worldwide distribution of infected pigs means there is ample opportunity for transmission. porcine in the Philippines have been found to act as reservoirs for Reston virus. Reston virus was first identified in 1990 among non-human primates imported from the Philippines to several primate handling facilities. cases of human infection began to emerge towards the end of April 2009 in what is normally regarded as the influenza season in the northern hemisphere. the new virus subtype often referred to as swine flu, spread rapidly throughout the world in a matter of weeks. there is as yet no evidence of this canine hepatitis C-like virus causing liver disease in dogs. the finding of novel flavivirus in dogs has promoted a search for related viruses in other companion animal species. the keeping of small rodents and mammals has been linked to zoonotic disease for many decades. the keeping of prairie dogs is common in the united states. this totally unexpected occurrence was the result of housing prairie dogs. cross-species transmission Viruses must bind to one or more receptors on the surface of the target cell in order to enter and infect cells. new diseases can emerge when viruses evolve the ability to bind to either a new receptor in a novel target host species or use the homologue of an existing receptor in a new species. recent evolutionary studies have revealed that bats have coevolved with an as yet unknown factor that drove rapid evolution of the residue of bat ACE2 that interacts with SARS coronavirus. this virus could have pre-existed in bats or could have been a newly created virus resulting from recombination between two bat coronavirus. the study of arenaviruses offers an excellent opportunity for revealing the molecular basis of co-evolution of viruses with their rodent host. the new world arenaviruses are subdivided further into three clades, A, B and C. changes to other viral proteins may have a profound outcome on whether or not a new host can support virus replication. a strain from a patient with fulminant hepatitis (JFH-1) was isolated. this strain contains a modification in the polymerase gene (NS5A) which allows the generation of chimeras representing all of the HCV genotypes that are infectious. in 1997, an outbreak of Rift Valley fever was detected in northeastern Kenya and western Somalia following a period of abnormal rainfall. around 370 human deaths were recorded, mainly in the Garissa region of Kenya. however, there was evidence of RFV infection in only 23% of cases. the result in the Garissa outbreak was the emergence of a new recombinant virus with substantial virulence for humans. rhesus TRIM5 restricts HIV-1 infection by interacting with the HIV-1 capsid at an early stage of infection. rhesus TRIM5 does not restrict SIV isolated from macaques. apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing, enzyme-catalytic, polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) and tetherin are two host proteins that restrict replication of retroviruses including HIV and SIV. the retroviral proteins viral infectivity factor and viral protein U counteract APOBEC3G and tetherin, respectively. human type 5 adenoviruses use two receptors, constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and 3/5 integrin in order to infect airway epithelial cells. both receptors are not normally available for viral binding, being a component of tight junctions and the basolateral membranes of polarizedepithelia. measles virus infects macrophages and dendritic cells in the airway before crossing the airway epithelium and infecting lymphatic organs. this is not expressed on all target cells, which led to the notion that another receptor was also used for measles virus infection. the reasons why Ebola Reston is not pathogenic remain unclear. VP24 also contributes to the inhibition of innate immunity by preventing the accumulation of antiviral siginal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-1 in the nucleus. improved epidemiological surveillance of infectious diseases is the foundation for immediate and long-term strategies for combating emerging diseases. this is a task compounded by considerations as to likely emergence of escape mutant in populations vaccinated against known diseases. this is a task compounded by considerations as to likely emergence of strains resistant to antiviral therapy, or even the recycling through livestock of attenuated vaccines. a lack of sequence diversity in presumptive isolates characteristic of retroviruses strongly suggests the presence of a contaminant. technology can play a major role in predicting disease emergence, as for example the use of satellite imagery to detect changing patterns of vegetation in response to rainfall. the use of the internet has become an essential tool in containing disease outbreaks. outbreaks may spread even in countries fully equipped to deal with infectious disease outbreaks unless there is the foresight to critically review clinical and epidemiological data quickly and instigate appropriate control measures. emerging viruses linked to disease are invariably newly identified member species within well-characterized virus families. RNA genomes as their replication results in a higher rate of mutation compared to those with DNA genomes. a balance has been found between the evolving viral genome and the ability of the human immune response to limit the infective process. for this to be effective there needs to be an effective integration of medical and veterinary surveillance systems. many emerging diseases can be viewed as in this process of adaptation prior to reaching the typical host\u2013parasite balance a balance between replication and survival of the host. in the long term, we need to adopt a holistic approach whereby the drivers of emergence are measured."}
