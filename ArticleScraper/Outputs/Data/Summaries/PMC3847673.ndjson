{"summary": "genetic variants in the inhibiting FcRIIB mediate anti-inflammatory responses. however, these variants are rare in Asian and Hispanic populations. DC-SIGN is a known receptor for sialylated Fc. globulin (IVIG) is the principal treatment for acute KD. a significant portion of patients do not respond appropriately. the mechanism of IVIG action in KD remains elusive in humans. the minor allele, A at IIB-120 (T/a) in inhibiting FcR2B influence IVIG-R among whites, OR = 2.78 [1.02-7.69] Previously, none of the IVIG-R individuals were AA homozygote but 5/124 (4%) were homozygote among responders. however, these variants are absent in Asians and rare in Hispanic populations. failure to respond to IVIG treatment was defined as persistent fever at > 36 hours from the initiation of IVIG infusion or recurrent fever at > 36 hours after completion of the initial IVIG infusion. we genotyped five single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region of DC-SIGN. rs2287886 G/a F: Biotin AGCTTTTTCCCACCCTCTGTGATC TAGYCTTTTGGATGACAGAT CCCTACCCA (-139) R Biotin GAGGACAGCAGCAGCTCAAAGC S CCTCCACTAGGGCAAG rs735240 G/a F Biotin GAGGACAGCAGCAGCTCAAAGC S CTGCCTCATTGCTCG (-1466) berg equilibrium (HWE) for each SNP was assessed in all KD patients and among responders and non-responders in each ethnic group. chi-square test was performed to examine the differential distribution of alleles and genotypes between IVIG responders and non-responders. allele and genotype distribution of five polymorphisms in the promoter of DC-SIGN among IVIG responders and non-responders in three ethnic groups Minor allele frequency Global test Additive model HapMap* IVIG responders. polymorphisms within the promoter region of DC-SIGN have been previously associated with disease susceptibility for infections by pathogens. ethnic differences in allele frequencies have also been discussed as being genetic cause for racial differences in susceptibility to these diseases. ethnic specific refractory rates in U.S populations have not been well defined. the IVIG response in Asian and White KD populations are both influenced by genetic alterations. polymorphisms in the activating receptor, FcR3B, are also associated with IVIG response. authors\u2019 contributions MAP and SS conceived, designed and led the study. AS assisted with the SNP genotyping and managed the genetic data. MAP and SS wrote the manuscript to the final version."}
