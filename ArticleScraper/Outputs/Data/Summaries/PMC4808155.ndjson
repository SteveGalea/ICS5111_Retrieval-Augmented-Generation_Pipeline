{"summary": "HCV is a highly variable RNA virus which has been classified into 7 known genotypes (3). genetic distances between genotypes reach up to 30% (4). this diversity can be explained by an evolutionary rate of 103 substitutions per site and year (5). AA compounds targeting any of these proteins have been approved or are being investigated in advanced clinical trials. these regimens result in an increase in SVR rates to above 90% and reduce the duration of treatment to 12 weeks or less (12) natural HCV variation is generated and transmitted over time even in the absence of DAAs. no study comprehensively describing the natural HCV variation and polymorphism in all three targets of approved DAAs (NS3, NS5A, and NS5B) we report the analysis of an extensive data set of HCV sequences from DAA-naive patients available to date. 4,551 NS3, 7,385 NS5A, and 2,182 NS5B nonredundant sequences were searched. low-quality sequences and non-human-derived sequences were excluded. only those HCV sequences derived from DAA-treated patients were retained. NS5B (concatenated set; 1,143 sequences), NS3 set (2,936 sequences), iii) NS5A set (2,242 sequences), and NS5B set (1,376 sequences) all sequences from the concatenated data set were present in the corresponding gene data set. the genotype of the sequences was confirmed by using two different methods. a data frame was created using in-house Perl and R scripts (33), with every row representing a sequence and each column representing a resistance-associated position. the frequencies of resistant haplotypes were inferred with Arlequin v3.1 (35) the genetic barrier was calculated as the addition of the values assigned to the transitions and/or transversions needed to convert a nonresistance codon into a RAV. for each nonresistance codon, only the RAV codon with the minimal genetic barrier was chosen (the most parsimonious one), together with its minimal score. a total of 2,931 sequences were retrieved: 1,328 sequences from LANL, 847 sequences from EuHCVdb and 756 sequences from VIPRBC. a total of 2,931 sequences were retrieved: 1,328 sequences from LANL, 847 sequences from EuHCVdb, and 756 sequences from VIPRBC. only those HCV sequences derived from DAA-treated patients were retained. a clustering was performed for each data set using CD-HIT (29), setting the threshold of similarity to 0.95. n = 17, 35, 26, and 32 for NS3-NS5A-NS5B, NS3, NS5A, and NS5B sets. a compilation of 99 RAVs previously described in the literature in NS3, NS5A, and NS5B (31) were used for computing the number and type of amino acid variants at the corresponding positions with BioEdit. a data frame was created using in-house Perl and R scripts. each row representing a sequence and each column representing a resistance-associated position. the frequencies of resistant haplotypes for each analyzed HCV genotype/subtype were inferred with Arlequin v3.1 (35). the evolutionary history of natural RAVs for each GT was analyzed with Mesquite. a total of 2,901, 2,216, and 1,344 NS3, NS5A, and NS5B curated sequences were included in the analyses of HCV GTs 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. V36L (low-level resistance to boceprevir [BOC]/telaprevir [TPV]/SMV/paritaprevir) was highly frequent in GT2 (99.3%), GT3 (100%), GT4 (100%), GT5 (100%) and GT6 (18.9%) but present in only 1.4% and 0.8% of GT1a and GT1b isolates. 122T in 85.9% of GT4, 83.8% of GT5, and 48.6% of GT6 sequences. NS3-122R was present only in GT2 (71.89%), 122A was unique to GT5 (10.8%) major RAVs for PIs are located at NS3 positions 155, 156, and 168. n = 1,482) GT1b (n = 992) GT2 (n = 135) GT3 (n = 117) GT4 (n = 37) GT6 (n = 74) C16S C (1,476), S (1), T (1) C (984), T (2), S (1), Y (1) A (111), T (18), S (4), P (2) T (117) T (64) A (37) T (74) V36A/M/L/G/I/C V (1, 410), I (36), A (32) V (984), I (3), A (2) V (134), G (1) V (116), I (1) V (64) V (36), L (1) V (73) D79E D (1,478), E (2), N (2) D (1), E (133), K (1) D (112), E (4), N (1) D (112), E (3) Q80K/L/N/R/H/G Q (884), K (542), L (28), R (9), N (7) (110), K (23), T (1) S (117) S (5), T (55), N (4) S (2), T (31), A (4) S (13), T (36), N (25) R123H/K R (1,477), K (3) R (983), K (8) R (135) T (117) R (61), K (1) R (34), H (1) R (74) I132V I (1,466), V (5), L (2) I (282), V (692), L ( amino acid frequencies in HCV genotypes 1 to 6 at sites associated with resistance to NS5a inhibitors. n = 861) GT1a (n = 861) GT1b (n = 810) GT3 (n = 226) GT4 (n = 60) GT4 (n = 60) GT4 (n = 60) GT4 (n = 60) GT4 (n = 60) GT4 (n = 60) GT4 (n = 60) GT4 (n = 60 reference GT1b (Con1) Q24L Q (2), K (844), R (5), E (4), S (1) Q (788), K (11), R (10) S (218), L (5), A (1), G (1), T (1) K (60) Q (14) K (65), Q (29), R (2) L28M/V L (1), M (824), V (28), T (6), I (2) L (789), M (16), V (3), P (1) L (90), F (56), S (196), T (29) H (60) S (13), Y (1) H (69), R (10), Y (7), T (3), C (2), N (2), S (1) P58S/A/L/T/H P (23), H (823), R (6), Y (6), Q (1), C (1), D (1) P (750), S (30), T (10), L (7), Q (6), A (6) P (141), S (6), H (1), T (1) P (2 H (39), C (2) Y (148), F (1) Y (219), H (7) Y (55), H (2), T (1), R (1), S (1) T (14) T (79), S (14), I (2) F149L F (858), L (1) F (809) F (149) F (226) F (58), L (1), S (1) F (14) F (96) V153M/L/I V (15), L (834), I (4), P (1) V (657), L ( I (2), L (1) M (16), L (789), V (3), P (1) L (90), F (56), C (3) M (223), I (2), L (1) M (9), L (48), V (2), I (1) L (14) M (3), V (42), L (22), F (11), T (11), A (5), G (1) Q30H/R/E Q (840), H (14), R (4), L (2), Q (39), R (755), K (7), L (3), Y (55), H (2), T (1), R (1), S (1) T (14) T (79), S (14), I (2) D320E D (857), E (2), N (1), G (1) D (796), E (6), S (3), N (2) D (131), E (11), A (4), S (3), G (2), Q (1) D (226) D (43), E (11), N (4), S (3), G (2), Q (1) D (226) D (43), E (11), 222Q R (579), D (1) R (417) R (122) R (81) R (62) R (8) R (65), K (5), S (3) C223H/Y C (581) C (416), R (10) C (121), W (1) C (81) C (62) C (8) C (73) I239V/L I (580), V (1) I (416) I (120), L (2) I (78), V (3) I (10), V (52) I (8) I (62), V ( genotypes 1 to 6 at sites associated with resistance to NS5B NNIs.

NS5A-93H (resistance to DCV/LDV/ombitasvir) was highly represented in GT2 (81.2%) and GT4 (88.3%) but rare in GTs 1a, 1b, and 3 (0.9%, 4.6%, and 6.6% respectively) N/Y, M414T/V, Y448H/C, G554S, S556G, and D559G are associated with resistance to ABT-072 and dasabuvir. Interestingly, C316N was found in up to 30% of GT1b and 8.1% of GT4 sequences, all from non-GT4a isolates. the VESPA program determined the overall resistance profile to DAAs within and between HCV genotypes. for a given position, one amino acid was considered a signature when present in 100% of the sequences from a given genotype. for GT4, two NS3, one NS5A, and three NS5B RAVs were found as signature amino acids. for GT6, three signature RAVs were found in NS5B (NS5B-C455F, I482L, and V499A) these positions were NS3-48, 132, 170, 174, and 175, NS5A-24, 28, 30, 54, 58, 62, and 153, and NS5B-19, 71, 300, 338, and 499 for GT1; NS3-122, 173, and 174, NS \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 amino acids without asterisks are present in the majority, but not all, of the sequences for the given HCV genotype. amino acids unique for the given HCV genotype are presented in bold. amino acids without asterisks are present in the majority, but not all, of the sequences for the given HCV genotype. amino acids unique for the given HCV genotype are presented in bold. amino acids without asterisks are present in the majority, but not all, of the sequences for the given HCV genotype. amino acids present in 100% of the sequences for the given HCV genotype are presented in bold. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 amino acids without asterisks are present in the majority, but not all, of the sequences for the given HCV genotype. haplotypes with more than one RAV accounted for 53% of GT1a sequences. NS3-(36L+80G+122R+175L)+NS5A-(31M)+NS5B-(392I+414Q+556G) and NS3-(36L+168Q+175L)+NS5A-(28M)+NS5B-(556G) were present in 42.9% and 28.6% of the sequences. four positions in NS3, two in NS5A, and seven in NS5B presented very low genetic barriers. only for positions NS3-L36(CTT) in GT3, R155(CGC) in GTs 4 and 6, and Q168(CAG) in GT3 was a high genetic barrier evident. most positions presented low or intermediate genetic barrier scores. for NS5B, the following codons presented low genetic barrier scores for all possible RAVs. a high genetic barrier (score = 5) was found only for Q414(CAA), a polymorphism particularly frequent in genotype 2 isolates. genetic barrier is very low in GT1a (V36A/M score = 1) but high in GT3 (L30A, score = 3.5; L36M, score = 5) isolates. NS3-R155, the genetic barrier is very low for GTs 1a (as previously known), 2, 3, and 5 (score = 1) but high for GTs 1b, 4, and 6 (score = 6) a total of 2,901, 2,216, and 1,344 NS3, NS5A, and NS5B curated sequences were included in the analyses of HCV GTs 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. the same tree topologies were obtained when phylogenies were reconstructed from alignments without the codon positions implicated in resistance to DAAs. NS3-Q80K variant (resistance to SMV) was, as expected, highly frequent in GT1a. only six non-GT1a isolates carried these variants. NS3-Q80K variant (resistance to SMV) was, as expected, highly frequent in GT1. one GT1b, and two GT3 isolates (frequencies of 0.88%, 0.10%, and 1.71%, respectively) there was only one A156 variant in the data set: one GT6 isolate with A156V. whereas D168Q was fixed in GT3 (100%), 168E (resistance to most noncovalent PIs) was found in 48.6% of GT5 and 2.7% of GT6 sequences. /M/L/G/I/C V (1,450), L (21), M (7), I (1) V (978), L (8), I (3) L (134), M (1) L (117) L (64) L (37) V (57), L (14), I (3) A39V A (1,461), T (8), G (7), S (3), V (1) A (979), T (4), S (1) V (134), I (1) A (102), T (10), S (5) A (60 Q (884), K (542), L (28), R (9), N (7), S (1), M (1) Q (948), L (33), R (5), K (4) G (135) Q (116), R (1) Q (63) K (37) Q (55), K (18), L (1) A87T A (1,435), S (22), T (7), C (5), I (1) A (969), S (13), P (2), T (2), M (1), E (1) A (1), S (127), (282), V (692), L (10) I (7), L (127) I (8), L (109) I (59), L (4), V (1) I (35), L (1), V (1) I (51), L (22) S138T/D/P S (1,479) S (988), F (1) S (135) S (117) S (63), F (1) S (37) S (71), F (1) R155K/T/I/M/G/L/S/Q/P/N/ amino acid frequencies in HCV genotypes 1 to 6 at sites associated with resistance to NS5a inhibitors. amino acid frequencies in HCV genotypes at sites associated with resistance to NS5a inhibitors.

R30Q/L is a RAV studied in GT1b (Con1 replicon) which also causes resistance to DCV/LDV/ombitasvir. 30Q was found in only 4.8% of HCV-1b and 3.3% of GT3 sequences. 30L was present in 100% of GT5 sequences. NS5A-93H (resistance to DCV/LDV/ombitasvir) had a prevalence of 4.8% in GT1b, 3.1% in GT3 and 3.3% in GT4. the prevalence of natural RAVs to NS5B NI and NNI was also differentially distributed among HCV genotypes. NS5B-556 RAVs were rare for GT1 (556G/N in 7.2% and 1.4% of HCV-1b and 1a isolates, respectively) only one sequence (GT6) carried P495 variants at NS5B position 414. we used the VESPA program to determine the overall resistance profile to DAAs within and between HCV genotypes. tables 5 to 8 show the consensus amino acid pattern for each HCV genotype and the breakdown by subtypes. for a given position, one amino acid was considered a signature when present in 100% of the sequences from a given genotype.

NS3-(Q80K+175L) was present in 32% of the sequences. NS3-(36L+168Q+175L) was present in 32% of the sequences. for GT4, there were two equally frequent haplotypes, NS3-(36L+122T+175L)+NS5A-(28M+31M)+NS5A-(414L+556G) and NS3-(36L+122T+175L)+NS5A-(31M)+NS5B-(414L+556G) both present in only 8.8% of the sequences. the following codons had minimal scores of 1.0: V36(GTG) in GT1a; V55(GTT) in GT3; V55(GTT) in GT2; R155(AGA) in GT2; R155(AGG) in GTs 1a, 3, and 5; and V170(GTG) in GTs 4 and 6 or V170(GTA) in GT1b. in all HCV GTs, the generation of S282T was associated with a low genetic barrier score, requiring only one substitution but at the second base of the codon. a high genetic barrier (score = 5) was found only for Q414(CAA), a polymorphism particularly frequent in genotype 2 isolates. Y93H/C, GTs 1a and 1b showed a low genetic barrier in line with published clinical data (41), together with GT2, GT3 and GT4 isolates (score = 1). NS5B-M414 was high only for GT2 isolates (score = 5) and low for GTs 1a, 1b, 3, 5, and 6 (score = 1). the study provides a comprehensive view on naturally occurring RAVs in all sequences publicly available to date for HCV genotypes 1 to 6. we obtained 2,901, 2,216, and 1,344 HCV sequences from HCV isolates from DAA-naive patients for NS3, NS5A, and NS5B. NS5A has been previously analyzed in 31 GT1a and 30 GT1b clinical isolates (17), finding similar frequencies for L28V in GT1a and L28M/V in GT1b. however, we report a much lower prevalence of L31M in worldwide GT1a isolates (0.93%) and a higher or lower prevalence of Y93H/C in GT1a or GT1b isolates. NS5B RAVs identified in HCV replicon assays (A15G and I239V) showed a significant prevalence in GT2 and GTs 4 and 6, respectively, but their potential clinical significance is unclear. the most frequent for GT1a showed at least two RAVs at NS3 but for the rest of the HCV genotypes, finding three or more RAVs involving at least two different genes was very common. several RAVs previously characterized for HCV GT1 (either in replicon assays or during DAA treatment failure) were present as majority or signature amino acids for other viral genotypes. the potential impact of these genotype/subtype-specific natural RAVs on the pan-genotypic efficacy of new interferon-free DAA regimens remains to be determined. most HCV isolates have a low genetic barrier toward mutations to generate RAVs to different DAAs, regardless of the HCV genotype. this may hold true for combinations with highly potent NS5A inhibitors and/or those with highly potent NS5A inhibitors. a different question is whether a natural RAV preexists as a predominant variant within an individual. a natural RAV preexists as a predominant variant within an individual. a different question is whether DAA escape occurs because a natural RAV preexists as a predominant variant within an individual. natural RAVs are relatively common in viral isolates from treatment-naive patients, with frequencies clearly varying among HCV genotypes/subtypes. if proven clinically relevant, these natural RAVs also deserve attention for their potential to be transmitted in small local epidemics associated with risk behaviors."}
