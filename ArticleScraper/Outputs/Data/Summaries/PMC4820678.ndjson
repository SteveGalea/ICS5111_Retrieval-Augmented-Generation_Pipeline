{"summary": "ZIKV was first isolated from the serum of a febrile sentinel rhesus macaque in 1947. between 1947 and 2006, 20 cases of human ZIKV infection were reported in the literature. these cases were geographically restricted in certain African (African lineage) and Southeast Asian (Asian lineage) countries. globalization and urbanization have allowed ZIKV and its mosquito vectors to spread beyond their original geographical habitats. major sports events including the world cup and the Va'a World Sprint Championship canoe race in brazil in 2014 might have provided an opportunity for infected travelers to introduce the virus to Latin America. yellow fever virus (YFV, NC_002031.1) and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV, NC_001672.1) were also included in this study. phylogenetic tree construction was performed using the PFAM tool. prediction of transmembrane domains was performed using the TMHMM 2.0 server (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). the prediction of potential O-glycosylation and N-glycosylation sites in the polyprotein was performed using NetOGlyc 4.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetOGlyc/) and NetNGlyc 1.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/) the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, Ks, and the number of nonsynonymous substitutions west Nile virus (WNV, NC_001563.2), yellow fever virus (YFV, NC_002031.1) and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV, NC_001672.1) were also included. phylogenetic tree construction was performed using the PFAM tool. prediction of transmembrane domains was performed using the TMHMM 2.0 server. the prediction of potential O-glycosylation and N-glycosylation sites in the polyprotein was performed using signalP software 4.1 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetOGlyc/) and NetNGlyc 1.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/) was performed using the RNAfold WebServer with default settings. the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTR sequences are conserved among ZIKV strains with nucleotide identities of 83.6% and 83.9%. the polyprotein is cleaved into ten structural and non-structural (NS) proteins. most of the transmembrane domains are found in the NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, and NS4B proteins of other flaviviruses. this is compatible with the finding that the NS2A, NS2B, NS4A and NS4B proteins of other flaviviruses are mostly located within the endoplasmic reticular membrane bilayer. analysis was performed for all 24 Zika virus strains, but only the results of the three representative pre-epidemic African (Uganda 1947), pre-epidemic Asian (Malaysia 1966) and the epidemic (Brazil, 2015) strains are shown here. the Ka/Ks ratios in ZIKV genomes are low, with the highest being observed at C coding region. most of these markers are markers that differentiate the african and Asian lineages of ZIKV. Fifteen substitutions are only present in the epidemic ZIKV strains and not the pre-2007 strains. 6796\u20137548 2266\u20132516 0.011 0.338 0.033 NS5 7549\u201310257 2517\u20133419 0.012 0.413 0.029 a The positions refer to the first nucleotide or amino acid position in the polyprotein of the ZIKV strain MR766/Uganda/1947 (NC_012532.1). bootstrap values were calculated from 500 trees. tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. all strains represent Zika virus strains unless otherwise specified. the nucleotides in the Zika virus strains are highlighted in blue or red. at the 5\u2032-end of the viral genome, a small hairpin 3\u2032-stem-loop (SLA) structure, three additional SL structures, and a dumbbell (DB) structure are found. the short conserved 5\u2032-ACAG-3\u2032 sequences in the top loop of the sHP-3\u2032 SL structure are indicated in red. the three pairs of inverted complementary sequences involved in 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 long distance RNA\u2013RNA interactions are enlarged. the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTR sequences are conserved among ZIKV strains with nucleotide identities of 83.6% and 83.9%. the polyprotein is cleaved into ten structural and non-structural (NS) proteins. the complete polyprotein sequences of ZIKV have low similarity with those of other human-pathogenic flaviviruses. proteins of other flaviviruses are mostly located within the endoplasmic reticular membrane bilayer. other NS proteins include NS1, a putative protease/helicase (NS3), and a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; NS5), which are essential components or enzymes involved in viral replication. the Ka/Ks ratios in ZIKV genomes are low, with the highest being observed at C coding region (0.077), suggesting that all the genes in the ZIKV genome are likely under stabilizing selection. comparison between the pre-epidemic africa lineage virus strains and the epidemic ZIKV strains detected 24 amino acid substitutions. 20 substitutions are only present in the epidemic ZIKV strains and not the pre-2007 strains. the positions refer to the first nucleotide or amino acid. the nucleotide position of the polyprotein and NS5 coding region does not include the stop codon at the NS5 coding region. phylogenetic analysis of the ten putative structural and NS coding regions showed that the ZIKV strains were clustered into the African and the Asian lineages. all strains represent Zika virus strains unless otherwise specified for Spondweni virus, dengue virus serotype 2 and tick-borne encephalitis virus. bootscan analysis showed a possible recombination fragment from nucleotide positions 4237\u20134528 between the Asian lineage ZIKV strains and SPOV. the nucleotides in the Zika virus strains are highlighted in blue or red. a small hairpin 3\u2032-stem-loop (sHP-3\u2032 SL) structure, three additional SL structures, and a dumbbell (DB) structure are found at the 5\u2032-end of the viral genome. small hairpin 3'-stem-loop, sHP-3' SL; stem loop, SL; Y-shape stem-loop, SLA; untranslated region, UTR. characterization of the viral genome may facilitate the identification of important virulence factors and diagnostic, therapeutic and vaccine targets. two most conserved secondary RNA structures in flavivirus genomes are the Y-shape SLA structure at the 5\u2032-UTR and the sHP-3\u2032 SL structure at the 3\u2032-UTR. three additional putative SL and one DB structures are found in both the pre-epidemic and epidemic ZIKV strains. the C protein of flaviviruses is released into the cytoplasm and forms homodimers. the basic residues on one side of the C protein bind the RNA genome and the hydrophobic residues on the other side interact with the viral lipid envelope. the entering viral genome may remain associated with the C dimers to evade from host nucleases and RNA sensors. the prM protein of flaviviruses contains two membrane-spanning domains and a short ectodomain. the prM protein of flaviviruses contains two membrane-spanning domains and a short ectodomain. a single amino acid substitution at the N-linked glycosylation site of the prM-E complex of JEV may elicit an enhanced host humoral immune response. NS1 of flaviviruses is a glycoprotein that may contain multiple N-glycosylation sites and disulfide bonds that may affect virus viability and virulence. the monomers of NS1 are soluble and hydrophilic, while the NS1 homodimers may associate with the endoplasmic reticular membranes. NS2A, NS2B, NS4A and NS4B of flaviviruses are small, hydrophobic proteins with incompletely understood functions. each protein has two or more membrane-spanning regions and may play important roles in the assembly or anchoring of the viral replication complexes on the endoplasmic reticular membrane. NS5 is the largest and most conserved protein of ZIKV. the NS5 protein of DENV mediates cleavage of STAT2. NS5 also has the largest number of amino acid substitutions. the importance of these substitutions should be investigated further. the impact of these changes of the virus genome should be investigated in biological assays."}
