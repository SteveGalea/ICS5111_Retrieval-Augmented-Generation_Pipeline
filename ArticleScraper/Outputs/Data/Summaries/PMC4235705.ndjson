{"summary": "human metapneumovirus (HBoV) was first identified by tobias Allander in 2005. HBoV was grouped into the family Parvoviridae, subfamily Parvovirinae, and genus Bocavirus. four subtypes have been identified, and of these, HBoV1 is most frequently detected in clinical samples. the genome of HBoV subtype 2 is circular. it has been assumed to occur in the same manner as the genome replication of animal parvovirus. a novel cell culture system based on NuLi and CuFi cells could be appropriate models in which to study the questions regarding HBoV replication. the viral transcriptome is typical of a member of the Bocavirus genus. the first ORF at the 5' end likely encodes a non-structural protein known as NS1. the subsequent ORF likely encodes a second non-structural protein, NP1. HBoV is a major pathogen detected in respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. to date, four subtypes have been identified, and they are found worldwide without any regional, geographic, or border restrictions. the seroprevalence of HBoV is strongly dependent on the age of the investigated patient cohort. the seroprevalence of HBoV is lowest for HBoV-4 (0.8\u20135%), followed by HBoV-3 (10\u201338.7%), HBoV-2 (34\u201349.3%), and HBoV-1 (66.9\u201396%) HBoV has been co-detected with more additional pathogens than any other respiratory virus. HBoV can be found in respiratory tract secretions [27] and stool [64,65,66]. there is currently limited information about the pathogenesis of HBoV. HBoV is highest for the respiratory subtype HBoV1. HBoV2\u20134 are less frequent and less seroprevalent. symptomatic treatment may be required in severe cases. the diagnosis of HBoV infection is exclusively based on molecular detection methods. most laboratories currently use in-house PCR and real-time PCR assays targeting the NP-1, NS-1 or VP1/2 gene. some commercially available approved multiplexing assays have been developed and brought to the market. a new era of clinical studies of respiratory infections has begun. HBoV is often detected as a co-pathogen, primarily because a versatile cell culture system and an animal model are not available. the most recent cell culture system using NuLi cells could be such a model. clinical studies on HBoV infections were among the first generation of studies in which the presence of virtually all respiratory pathogens was required to be assessed."}
