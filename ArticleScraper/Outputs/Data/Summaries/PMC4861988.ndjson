{"summary": "in the field of microbiology, the most important issues are often the identification of a contagious disease that requires the patient to be isolated. it is important to detect infections that can be easily cured through ambulatory care and those which may compromise prognosis, requiring hospitalization. METHODS We screened the Medline database using \u201cpoint-of-care,\u201d \u201cnear-patient,\u201d \u201crapid,\u201d \u201cPOC infection\u201d and specific keywords related to each microorganism and disease. we included all studies that compared POC tests with standard diagnosis strategies, including any analyses of cost-effectiveness. POC tests are performed at the site of patient care. they do not need significant laboratory infrastructures or specialized staff in order to be performed. they are designed to be easy to use and interpret and are often able to deliver a rapid diagnosis within 1 h. complex is then captured by a secondary antibody, leading to the appearance of an initial color band. the excess primary antibody continues migrating to a second point of capture with tertiary antibodies, leading to the appearance of a second color band. interpretation is based on visualization of the first band (present equals positive, and absent equals negative) and visualization of the second band (present equals an interpretable test result, and absent equals an uninterpretable test result) Stool ICT Pneumonia kit Streptococcus pneumoniae Urine ICT Legionella pneumophila Urine ICT Mycobacterium tuberculosis Sputum RT-PCR Influenza viruses Nasal swab RT-PCR, ICT Respiratory syncytial virus Nasal swab RT-PCR Procalcitonin Blood ICT Meningitis kit Neisseria meningitidis CSF RT- ICT, immunochromatographic test; RT-PCR, real-time PCR; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid may overlap commercially available multiplexed tests. two techniques are available for POC testing: PCR-based techniques and isothermal nucleic acid amplification techniques (13) commercially available test offers 25-min multiplex detection of respiratory tract pathogens, including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, coronavirus, and parainfluenza virus. up to 26 tropical disease-causing pathogens can also be detected by using a technique for hybridizing DNA or RNA extracted from a clinical specimen. the monospot test detects heterophile antibodies in the course of mononucleosis syndrome due to Epstein-Barr virus with a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity >90% (19). False-positive results have been reported in the course of other acute infections due to cytomegalovirus (19) and dengue virus (20) interpretation is based on visualization of the first band (present equals positive, and absent equals negative) and visualization of the second band (present equals an interpretable test result, and absent equals an uninterpretable test result) ICTs are available in several formats, the results of which can be read either visually or by using a compact and connectable reader, which is mandatory when labeling the primary antibody with a fluorescent marker. mophila Urine ICT Mycobacterium tuberculosis Sputum RT-PCR Influenza viruses Nasal swab RT-PCR, ICT Respiratory syncytial virus Nasal swab RT-PCR Procalcitonin Blood ICT Meningitis kit Neisseria meningitidis CSF RT-PCR Streptococcus pneumoniae CSF RT-PCR Enterovirus CSF RT- ICT, immunochromatographic test; RT-PCR, real-time PCR; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid. two techniques available for POC testing: PCR-based techniques and isothermal nucleic acid amplification techniques. PCR incorporates 30 to 40 cycles of heating to 72\u00b0C. commercially available test offers 25-min multiplex detection of respiratory tract pathogens, including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, coronavirus, and parainfluenza virus. up to 26 tropical disease-causing pathogens can also be detected by hybridizing DNA or RNA extracted from a clinical specimen. nucleosis syndrome due to Epstein-Barr virus with a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity >90% (19) false-positive results have been reported in the course of other acute infections due to cytomegalovirus (19) and dengue virus (20) conventional clinical specimen sampling is a disease-based approach aimed at successively testing the pathogens that the doctor believes are potentially responsible for the infection. however, it is difficult for physicians to memorize the actual list of pathogens and the appropriate list of appropriate clinical samples. syndrome-based kits are contained in an appropriate format such as a plastic bag and contain prelabeled sampling tubes and containers. the available literature regarding the repertoire of pathogens responsible for the syndrome and the optimal methods of achieving direct and indirect diagnoses of infection by each of these pathogens. the menu of any given POC syndromic kit must be reevaluated in a given geographic area. the 2014-2015 epidemics in west africa led to the incorporation of appropriate POC tests in the fever POC syndromic kit (26) this also means that the menu of any POC syndromic kit may vary slightly from one geographic area to another, to take into account the most prevalent pathogens in that region. the Parascreen Pan/Pf test (Zephyr Biomedical, Goa, India) and the OptiMAL test (Diamed AG, Cressier, Switzerland) identify both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. the Paracheck Pf test (Orchid Biomedical Systems, Goa, India) identifies only P. falciparum (31) dengue virus can be tested by using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT), which detect the detection of influenza virus in 30 min also has low sensitivity (60%) but a specificity of almost 100%. the detection of influenza virus in 30 min also has low sensitivity (60%) and a high positive predictive value (>98%) during the influenza season (42). RT-PCR tests integrating nucleic acid extraction and amplification in a single cassette and in a multiplexed manner are commercially available. the diagnostic of community-acquired pneumonia at the POC involves RT-PCR tests integrating nucleic acid extraction and amplification in a single cassette and in a single cassette. a commercially available Campylobacter antigen detection kit has been favorably evaluated. a dipstick test for the rapid detection of Shigella is under evaluation. a dipstick test for the rapid detection of Shigella is under evaluation. new POCTs include immunochromatographic strip (ICS) and dual-POC tests to detect both treponemal and nontreponemal antibodies. untreated infection can result in pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), infertility, and ectopic pregnancy in women. POC meningitis menu was aimed at testing for enterovirus (NAAT), Streptococcus pneumoniae (NAAT), Neisseria meningitidis (NAAT) and herpesviruses. a few commercially available multiplexed NAATs currently under development would detect six bacteria, eight viruses, and two Cryptococcus species within 1 h. the detection of S. pyogenes is most commonly achieved by using lateral flow as the menu of any POC syndromic kit must be reevaluated in a given geographic area, based on emerging pathogens. this is illustrated by the 2014-2015 Ebola virus epidemics in west africa. the menu of any POC syndromic kit may vary slightly from one geographic area to another, to take into account the most prevalent pathogens in that region. malaria continues to be a leading cause of fever in countries where the disease is endemic (30) malaria continues to be a leading cause of fever in countries where the disease is endemic (30) malaria continues to be a leading cause of fever in countries where the disease is endemic (30) a nanogold particle lateral flow assay was recently reported for POC diagnosis of dengue virus, yellow fever virus, and Ebola virus infections (23). these infections can also be diagnosed at the POC by using a commercially available RT-PCR assay (36) and a recently evaluated immunoassay detecting the Ebola virus VP40 antigenic protein (37). the detection of influenza virus in 30 min also has low sensitivity (60%) but a specificity of almost 100%. tuberculosis currently remains one of the deadliest threats to public health. diagnosis in POC laboratories relies on real-time PCR. Xpert MTB/RIF can also identify resistance to rifampin. rhea is a leading cause of death worldwide (38) and a frequent reason for consulting a doctor. the rapid detection of C. difficile toxins A and B should be routinely performed for both outpatients and hospitalized patients. a commercially available Campylobacter antigen detection kit has been favorably evaluated. paternal syphilis due to Treponema pallidum contributes to perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. if untreated, it may lead to complications and fetal infections. meningitis Meningitis involves a broad spectrum of causative agents and related prognoses, highlighting the value of rapid POC diagnosis (11) Performing CSF cytology remains problematic, as very few cell counters offer a 10-cell/mm3 resolution and a 10-l assay mixture volume. a few commercially available multiplexed NAATs currently under development would detect six bacteria, eight viruses, and two Cryptococcus species within 1 h. the detection of S. pyogenes is most commonly achieved by using lateral flow assays, with sensitivity reported to be 86.1% and specificity reported to be 97.1% (70). the rapid POC measurement of C-reactive protein is not justified in assisting with medical decisions for adults. a POC laboratory can serve a minimum population of 500 to 1,000 people. complete computerization of POC management would restrict non-potentially infectious waste to reagent wraps. self-diagnostic tests may guarantee quality-controlled design, manufacture, and performance. self-diagnostic tests may guarantee quality-controlled design, manufacture, and performance but cannot guarantee quality of implementation. training is fully recorded in the POC tablet and may be viewed at any time by the staff. the staff and the POC laboratory are quality controlled and remain in permanent contact with a core laboratory and biologists. self-sampling removes any responsibility for non-health care personnel and respects patients' privacy. self-sampled specimens include blood obtained from a single finger prick, urine collected in a sterile container, and a pharyngeal swab. the operator must then choose the syndromic kit according to the instructions on the device. the operator is also responsible for the general maintenance of the POC. the time of transport of clinical specimens to the core laboratory takes more than 1 h, the optimal time scale for POC tests in order to obtain a result within 2 h. a POC laboratory can serve a minimum population of 500 to 1,000 people, corresponding to the population of patients in an emergency unit or remote village (4) or a small population on board a ship (5). instrument must contain hood for handling class 2 clinical samples, storage at room temperature, a refrigerator for storage at 4\u00b0C 1\u00b0C, a computer connected to the core laboratory, an automatic cell counter for the diagnosis of meningitis, a nucleic acid extractor, and a thermocycler. the instrument is robust, portable, and easy to use and requires only minimal maintenance. technical staff followed training leading to a 34% increase in test sensitivity. training comes in the form of a questionnaire comprising 20 simple questions with 3 possible answers. each correct answer is worth 1 point, each incorrect answer deducts 1 point, and the \u201cI do not know\u201d answer is equal to 0 points. quality control In the united states, several POC tests are governed by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) text issued in 2009. in the united states, several POC tests are governed by the clinical laboratory improvement amendments (CLIA) text. in general, a POC laboratory has to be operated under the supervision of a core laboratory. remote POC testing in a rural village in Senegal was run using its own source of electricity. the concentration of microbiological platforms in core laboratories limits the population's access to these facilities. in Marseille, we set up a POC in the emergency unit of a hospital serving 400,000 people. in Marseille, we set up a POC in the emergency unit of a hospital serving 400,000 people. however, diagnostic uncertainty can lead to inappropriate, expensive deviations or inappropriate medical decisions. we therefore tested a POC laboratory onboard a cruise ship and a freight ship, with favorable results. the impact of some POC tests on infection control was recently reviewed (79). the impact of POC tests on infection control was recently reviewed (79). a second impact is placing patients with the same epidemic and contagious infection into the same cohort. one of the impacts of POC testing is to prevent the hospitalization of patients presenting at the emergency room with a contagious and benign infection. a second impact is placing patients with the same epidemic and contagious infection into the same cohort. this is illustrated by the cohorting of respiratory syncytial virus-infected children in pediatric emergency rooms. 20 yr, from 2012, discounted at 3% S0, smear microscopy (reference); S1, Xpert S1 vs S0 over 10 yr, US$792\u20131,257; S1 vs S0 over 20 yr, US$536\u20131,060 S1 is

ICERs were found to be below the standard benchmarks for cost-effectiveness recommended by the WHO. winetsky et al. developed a dynamic transmission model to evaluate the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies for active TB screening in prisons in the former Soviet Union. authors assessed eight strategies involving, either alone or in combination, self-referral, symptom screening, mass miniature radiography (MMR) and sputum PCR with probes for rifampin resistance (Xpert MTB/RIF) Choi et al. evaluated the cost-effectiveness of incorporating Xpert into TB diagnostic algorithms compared to current approaches in the united states. the analysis was conducted from a health system perspective using a decision tree model. it compared five strategies with and without the incorporation of molecular testing. available cost-effectiveness studies show the use of algorithms involving Xpert to diagnose TB infection is a beneficial and cost-effective strategy in resource-limited settings where TB and HIV prevalences are high. the authors of that study estimated the number of correctly treated cases (CTCs) and computed incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per CTC. the parascreen-based strategy was more effective and costlier than the paracheck-based strategy, with an ICER of US$0.59 per CTC. the authors concluded that the Parascreen test should not be recommended for assessing strategies involving RDTs for malaria diagnosis in the settings of Uganda, Ghana, Zambia, and brazil. the results indicate that very high levels of microscopy accuracy are needed for microscopy to be more cost-effective than microscopy. a review of cost-effectiveness studies conducted between 2006 and 2010 to assess new malaria RDTs in the setting of sub-Saharan countries was reported. cost-effectiveness of POC testing depends on microscopy accuracy, which varies depending on the setting. in sub-saharan africa, microscopy accuracy was low, while in brazil, microscopy was associated with high sensitivity and specificity. the ICS test averted 326 DALYs per 1,000 women and 180 DALYs per 1,000 pregnancies. the ICS test averted 326 DALYs per 1,000 women and 180 DALYs per 1,000 pregnancies. the dual-POC strategy averted 299 and 162 DALYs for 1,000 women. the cost-effectiveness of a vaginal swab POC test versus a standard vaginal swab NAAT was measured by a decision tree model (112) the cost-effectiveness of a vaginal swab POC test versus a standard vaginal swab NAAT was measured by using a decision tree model (112) sensitivity analyses showed that in nearly half the simulations, POC testing would save money but avert fewer PID cases. authors of that study concluded that if future POCT improvements were able to reduce waiting time while maintaining sensitivity, the use of POC testing would prevent more PIDs. same-day diagnosis and treatment could prevent >95,000 unnecessary treatments per year. authors concluded that replacing standard laboratory tests for chlamydia and gonorrhea with a POC NAAT could reduce costs. ICERs computed for the use of Xpert in addition to smear microscopy were US$55, US$110, and US$41 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) compared with the base case, ICERs were US$68, US$138, and US$52 per DALY in each of the study countries. the cost-effectiveness analysis was based on a dynamic mathematical model. ICERs were US$1,257, US$1,011, US$878, US$958, and US$792 per DALY averted in each country over 20 years. Xpert were dominated by strategies based on LED fluorescence microscopy and the Xpert full rollout. three strategies were identified as cost-effective: the Xpert full rollout, with an ICER of US$169 per DALY averted, followed by two LED fluorescence microscopy-based strategies. authors conclude that the government should consider full Xpert scale-up if the health-related budget in Tanzania can afford a health intervention. the most effective strategy for reducing overall TB prevalence involved the use of sputum PCR as an annual primary screening tool. this strategy was also the most cost-effective, with an ICER of US$543 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) authors concluded that the addition of Xpert for TB diagnosis would be beneficial and cost-effective compared to current approaches in the low-prevalence setting of the united states. authors highlighted the need for increased efforts to include patient-level costs of TB diagnosis as well as indirect costs. study enrolled 2,422 patients suspected of having malaria compared a presumptive treatment strategy with two strategies based on rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) the first using the Parascreen Pan/Pf test and the second using the Paracheck Pf test (99) the authors of that study estimated the number of correctly treated cases (CTCs) and computed incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per CTC. a review of cost-effectiveness studies conducted between 2006 and 2010 to assess new malaria RDTs in the setting of sub-Saharan countries was reported (104). the authors compared only microscopy with the RDT and found that microscopy was costlier and more effective, with an incremental cost estimated at US$549.90 per adequately diagnosed case. the impact of malaria prevalence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of RDTs was assessed by Zurovac et al., who highlighted that RDTs led to a notable reduction in treatment errors. in areas with a high rate of malaria transmission, they yielded only minor reductions in overprescription, with higher costs. ICS test averted 178 cases of congenital syphilis, 43 cases of low birth weight, and 37 prenatal deaths. results were highly sensitive to test kit, labor, and supply costs. cost of the ICS test more than doubled or when sensitivity fell to 88%, the RPR test was preferred. authors of the study estimated DALYs, costs, and costs per DALY averted over the life expectancy of a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 pregnant women. ICERs of ICS testing compared to no screening ranged between US$2 (Liberia) and US$48 (Botswana), with a population-weighted average of US$11 per DALY averted. using the Chlamydia Rapid Test (CRT) versus a standard vaginal swab NAAT was measured by using a decision tree model (112) model parameters were based on primary data derived from a sample of 154 eligible women recruited in sexually transmitted disease clinics in Baltimore, MD, between April 2010 and February 2011. authors of the study modeled a cohort of 1.2 million index patients to simulate the annual number of STI screenings performed at genitourinary medicine clinics in England. same-day diagnosis and treatment could prevent >95,000 unnecessary treatments per year. POCTs appear to be cost-effective for the diagnosis of tuberculosis, malaria, and syphilis in comparison with current diagnostic strategies in both southern and northern countries. despite different issues, POCTs appear to be cost-effective for the diagnosis of tuberculosis, malaria, and syphilis. the key elements of the global development strategy of outsourced points of care will be based on a first-stage repertoire. epidemiological situations lead to variations in pathogenic microorganisms depending on geographic location and time. there will always be a need for highly equipped laboratories in order to identify the repertoire of microorganisms."}
