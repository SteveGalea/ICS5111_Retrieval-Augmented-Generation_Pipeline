{"summary": "retrospective study analyzed laboratory records of patients admitted to six public hospitals in Hong Kong during the SARS epidemic from March to June 2003. the first inclusion criterion was serologic evidence of SARS-CoV infection. 18 of the 433 patients with positive serologic test results were excluded. specimens were centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 1 min, and 140 L of the supernatant were used for RNA extraction using the QIAamp viral RNA Mini Kit. RT-PCR was conducted in a 50-L reaction mix containing 5 L of extracted RNA preparation, 2.5 mol/L of random hexamer and 50 U of reverse transcriptase. PCR amplicons were visualized by ethidium bromide staining after agarose gel electrophoresis. the same RNA extraction method was used in laboratory B. reverse transcription was conducted at 54\u00b0C for 30 min. the cell culture tubes were examined daily for diffuse, refractile, rounding cytopathic effects characteristic of SARS-CoV. when cytopathic effects were observed, the cells were stained by the indirect immunofluorescence technique. the identity of the isolate was further confirmed by RT-PCR. 48/335 (14.3%) of adults and 2/68 (2.9%) of elderly patients died of the infection. all children recovered without requiring mechanical ventilation or intensive care. urine samples were transported in sterile containers. the reaction was stopped by heating at 95\u00b0C for 5 min and chilled on ice. the subsequent PCR was conducted in a 50-L reaction mix containing 5 L of cDNA template, 1 mol/L of each primer COR-1 and COR-2. the lower detection limit of the RT-PCR assays was determined by testing preparations with known copies of SARS-CoV as determined by real-time RT-PCR. both laboratories showed a lower detection limit of 50 viral copies per reaction. positive controls containing approximately 100 copies of viral RNA were included. 558 respiratory, 318 stool or rectal swab, and 296 urine specimens were tested by both RT-PCR and virus isolation. the mean number of specimens collected from each patient was 5.3 (range 1\u201332, SD 5.1) the mean time of collection of the first specimen was 13.5 days (range 1\u201388, SD 16.5) after the onset of symptoms. the number of specimens tested is shown in Table 1. Specimens tested after onset of illness. the positive rate for stool/rectal swab specimens began to increase on day 5. the detection rate for urine specimens started to increase at the end of the second week. pooled throat and nasal swabs, rectal swab, nasal swab, throat swab and nasopharyngeal aspirate provided moderate yield with average positive rates ranging from 29.7% to 40.0% for the first 2 weeks. throat washing and urine specimens provided a lower yield with an average positive rate of 17.3% and 4.5%, respectively. a subgroup analysis was performed on 1,172 specimens submitted for both RT-PCR and virus isolation. the isolation/RT-PCR index for stool or rectal swab samples was approximately 5- to 10-fold lower when compared with that for respiratory specimens. a subgroup analysis was performed on 342 patients whose first specimens were collected within 4 weeks of illness onset. a higher positive detection rate for SARS-CoV was observed for patients with more severe disease (p 0.001 by chi-square test) bOnly patients with their first specimens collected within 4 weeks of onset of illness are included cPatients with one or more specimen(s) positive for SARS-CoV by RT-PCR. the mean number of specimens collected from each patient was 5.3 (range 1\u201332, SD 5.1) specimens were grouped into categories: respiratory, stool or rectal swab, and urine. tracheal aspirate, nasopharyngeal aspirate, throat washing, nasal swab, pooled throat and nasal swabs. RT-PCR positive rate for respiratory specimens increased slightly from week 1 to week 2 after the onset of illness. the positive rate for respiratory specimens began to increase on day 5. the positive rate for stool/rectal swab specimens peaked at days 9 and 10. the detection rate for urine specimens started to increase at the end of the second week.
