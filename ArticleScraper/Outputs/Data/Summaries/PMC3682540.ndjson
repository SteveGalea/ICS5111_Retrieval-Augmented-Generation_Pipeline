{"summary": "influenza viruses of the H1, H2 and H3 subtypes can circulate widely in mammalian species, such as humans, swine, and horses (4). influenza viruses of the H1, H2 and H3 subtypes are classified into subtypes by the distinct antigenicity of the HA and neuraminidase surface proteins. cleavage occurs at the C-terminal side of a single arginine residue (Arg-343 in H1 numbering) the cleavage site-flanking region can also play a role, as demonstrated by a mutation at the P2 position of HA of the neurotropic mouse-adapted A/WSN/33 virus being a determinant for cleavability by plasmin (17). kallikrein-related peptidases 5 (KLK5) and 12 (KLK12) closely resembles the cleavage site region region of H1 subtype HA (IQSRX) high mRNA and protein levels of KLK5 have been observed in the skin, breast, ovary, and salivary gland (27, 28) the gene encoding A/Japan/305/57 HA (H2N2) was synthesized by GeneArt. the plasmids encoding A/Wyoming/3/03 HA (H3N2) and A/Wisconsin/67/05 HA (H3N2) were purchased from Sino Biological Inc. human kallikrein 5 and kallikrein 12 were obtained from Pierce. cloning, expression, and purification of prourokinase followed as described by Hamilton et al. the cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with 150 nm KLK5 and 750 nm KLK12 for 1.5 h at 37 \u00b0C. the cells were also incubated in the absence of protease for 1.5 h and with 0.7 m trypsin for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C as controls. the cells were also incubated in the absence of protease for 1.5 h. reassortant A/PR/8/34 HA has both HA and neuraminidase genes. the remaining genes were derived from the A/Hong Kong/1/68 virus. the virus solution was harvested and treated with 150 nm KLK5 and KLK12. the change in fluorescence at 390 nm was observed over the course of the reaction. a Vmax was obtained by determining the slope of the linear portion of the curve. each reaction was plotted using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software) the concentration of each kallikrein was measured by standard ELISA. plasmids encoding A/Wyoming/3/03 HA (H3N2) and A/Wisconsin/67/05 HA (H3N2) were purchased from Sino Biological Inc. the gene encoding A/WSN/33 HA was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis. the gene encoding A/WSN/33 HA was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis. HA cleavage was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-A/PR/8/34 (H1), anti-A/Singapore (H2), and anti-A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3) antibodies. cells were also incubated in the absence of protease for 1.5 h and with 0.7 m trypsin for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C as controls. cells were incubated with 200 nm KLK5 and KLK12 for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C. cells were then washed with PBS, treated with 5 mm HEPES, 5 mm MES, 5 mm succinate, and 150 mm NaCl (pH 5.0) for 2 min. the nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (blue; Invitrogen) each virus was incubated in the absence of protease and with 0.5 m trypsin. each virus was also incubated in the absence of protease. the nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258. each sample was incubated with the fluorogenic substrate GGGR-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (EMD Chemicals) at 150 m and monitored for the increase in fluorescence at 440 nm over the course of 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. each reaction was plotted using KaleidaGraph, and the Vmax was determined. the gene encoding A/Japan/305/57 HA (H2N2) was synthesized by GeneArt. the plasmids encoding A/Wyoming/3/03 HA (H3N2) and A/Wisconsin/67/05 HA (H3N2) were purchased from Sino Biological Inc. the mouse prourokinase gene (ATCC 63256) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (31) the cloning, expression, and purification of prourokinase were followed as described by Hamilton et al. the cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with 150 nm KLK5 and 750 nm KLK12 for 1.5 h at 37 \u00b0C. the cells were also incubated in the absence of protease for 1.5 h and with 0.7 m trypsin for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C as controls. /X-31 has both HA and neuraminidase genes derived from the A/Hong Kong/1/68 virus. the remaining genes were derived from the A/PR/8/34 H1 virus (32) to produce non-cleaved virus, 293T cells were grown in a 6-cm dish, washed with PBS, and incubated with egg-derived A/PR/8/34 HA (H1N1) and A/X-31 HA ( a Vmax from each reaction was plotted using KaleidaGraph. the change in fluorescence over the course of each reaction was plotted using KaleidaGraph. each sample was then incubated with the fluorogenic substrate GGGR-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (EMD Chemicals) plasmids encoding A/Wyoming/3/03 HA (H3N2) and A/Wisconsin/67/05 HA (H3N2) were purchased from Sino Biological Inc. non-cleaved virus was generated by single replication round in 293T cells. human kallikrein 5 and kallikrein 12 were obtained from RS Synthesis. the mouse prourokinase gene (ATCC 63256) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. HA cleavage was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-A/PR/8/34 (H1), anti-A/Singapore (H2), and anti-A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H3) antibodies. cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with 150 nm KLK5 and 750 nm KLK12 for 1.5 h at 37 \u00b0C. cells were also incubated in the absence of protease for 1.5 cell-cell fusion was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining using each anti-HA antibody described above. the nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (blue; Invitrogen) reassortant A/PR/8/34 HA and A/X-31 HA viruses were used as prototype strains. kallikreins and kallikreins were grown in a 24-well plate containing a glass coverslip. they were incubated with the virus solution for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C. the nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (blue) the change in fluorescence over the course of each reaction was plotted using KaleidaGraph. four individual nasal samples for KLK5 and eight individual nasal samples for KLK12 were incubated overnight on a Immulon 4HBX plate. the concentration of each kallikrein was measured by standard ELISA using anti-KLK5 and anti-kLK12 antibodies. peptidase was determined to be present in the nasal wash samples and therefore present in the human respiratory tract. kallikrein 5 and kallikrein 12 were able to cleave HA, HAs from six strains of the influenza virus H1 subtype, one strain of the H2 subtype, and three strains of the H3 subtype. in the case of KLK12, cleavage of the H1 subtype strains was relatively efficient for A/PR/8/34 HA and A/California/09 HA. but inefficient for the A/New Caledonia/99 HA, A/South Carolina/18 HA, A/WS/33 HA, and A/WSN/33 HA. avage of the A/Japan/305/57 (A/Japan/57) H2 subtype strain by KLK5 (C) and KLK12 (E) was determined by densitometry of the Western blot analysis shown in Fig. 1. no cleavage was observed with mutation of the Arg cleavage site. a relatively large excess (750 nm) of KLK12 was needed to cleave A/WSN/33 HA. however, a nonspecific cleavage product was observed for A/South Carolina/18 HA. KLK12 induced syncytial formation of the H3 subtype to a higher degree than the H1 and H2 subtypes. syncytial formation was the most abundant with treatment of the H1 subtype compared with the other subtypes. syncytial formation was the most abundant with treatment of the H1 subtype. virions were generated by a single round of replication in 293T cells. each virus was then preincubated with KLK5 or KLK12. both activated influenza A/PR/8/34 HA, as indicated by immunofluorescence microscopy. treatment of each peptide with KLK5 resulted in a similar rate of cleavage. treatment resulted in low cleavage efficiency for the H3 consensus- and A/WSN/33 HA-derived peptides. but comparatively high cleavage efficiency for the H1 and H2 consensus-derived peptides. urokinase, and plasma kallikrein have all been shown to activate influenza virus HA. however, these enzymes circulate mainly in the inactive precursor form. both peptidases were incubated with each zymogen and monitored for activation by cleavage of a fluorogenic substrate. each graph includes the change in fluorescence of zymogen alone (), KLK5 and KLK12 alone () and zymogen with KLK5 and KLK12 (). each graph includes the change in fluorescence of zymogen with KLK5 and KLK12 alone () both KLK5 and KLK12 were able to cleave the HA precursor, forming the HA1 (55 kDa) and HA2 (25 kDa) products. cleavage of the H1 subtype strains by KLK5 resulted in relatively high cleavage efficiency for A/New Caledonia/99 HA, A/South Carolina/18 HA, A/WS/33 HA, and A/WSN/33 HA each peptidase appears to have a preference for particular subtypes. each peptidase appears to have a preference for particular strains within the H1 subtype. HA cleavage efficiency of KLK5 and KLK12 was shown in the bar graph. avage efficiency of KLK5 (black bars) and KLK12 (gray bars) was determined by densitometry of the Western blot analysis shown in Fig. 1. the percentage HA cleavage was determined by densitometry of the Western blot analysis. cleavage by kallikreins occurs at the proper arginine. we were unable to determine whether cleavage by each kallikrein produced fusogenic HA due to the low cleavage efficiency. Cleavage by kallikreins produces fusogenic HA. A, immunofluorescence microscopy of cells expressing A/PR/8/34 HA (upper panels), A/Japan/305/57 HA (middle panels), and A/Aichi/2/68 HA (lower panels) fluorogenic peptides were designed to mimic the consensus cleavage site region of the H1, H2 and H3 subtypes. treatment of each peptide with KLK5 resulted in a similar rate of cleavage, with a slightly higher rate for the peptide derived from A/WSN/33 HA. the cleavage site region of HA appears to affect cleavage by KLK12. e mimic was cleaved with relatively similar efficiency as other peptide mimics but did not cleave H2 HA. other factors such as glycosylation and secondary structure may affect the cleavage of the H2 subtype by KLK5. treatment of plasminogen with KLK5 and KLK12 resulted in the most striking difference in activation. a 7.5-fold higher rate in cleavage by activated plasmin was observed with KLK12 treatment. a previous report demonstrated low plasminogen activation by KLK5 treatment. each peptidase was determined to be present in the nasal wash samples. kallikrein 5 and kallikrein 12 were able to cleave HA, HAs from six strains of the influenza virus H1 subtype, one strain of the H2 subtype, and three strains of the H3 subtype. cleavage of the H1 subtype strains was relatively efficient for A/PR/8/34 HA and A/California/09 HA. but inefficient for the A/New Caledonia/99 HA, A/South Carolina/18 HA, A/WS/33 HA, and A/WSN/33 HA. in the case of KLK12, a relatively high cleavage efficiency was observed with KLK12. Western blot analysis of HA cleavage of the A/Japan/305/57 (A/Japan/57) H2 subtype strain by KLK5 (D) and KLK12 (E) were used as a control. HA in the absence of protease (Mock) or in the presence of trypsin were used as a control. cleavage was abolished following mutation of the Arg cleavage site. a relatively large excess (750 nm) of KLK12 was needed to cleave A/WSN/33 HA. however, a nonspecific cleavage product was observed. KLK5 induced syncytial formation of the H3 subtype to a higher degree than the H1 and H2 subtypes. syncytial formation was the most abundant with treatment of the H1 subtype compared with the other subtypes, demonstrating a preference for the H3 subtype. non-cleaved influenza A/PR/8/34 HA (H1N1) and A/X-31 HA (H3N2) virions were generated by a single round of replication in 293T cells, which are incapable of cleaving HA. each virus was preincubated with KLK5 or KLK12 and incubated with mammalian cells. treatment of each peptide with KLK5 resulted in a similar rate of cleavage. treatment resulted in low cleavage efficiency for the H3 consensus- and A/WSN/33 HA-derived peptides but comparatively high cleavage efficiency. KLK5 and KLK12 cleaved and activated the thrombolytic zymogens. both peptidases were monitored for activation by cleavage of a fluorogenic substrate. a 2-fold higher rate in cleavage by activated plasmin was observed. kallikrein 5 (A, C, and E) and kallikrein 12 (B, D, and F) each graph includes the change in fluorescence of zymogen alone (), KLK5 and KLK12 alone () and zymogen with KLK5 and KLK12 (). each graph includes the change in fluorescence of zymogen with KLK5 and KLK12 (). trypsin cleaves most, if not all, HA subtypes and strains efficiently. both KLK5 and KLK12 were able to cleave the HA precursor, forming the HA1 (55 kDa) and HA2 (25 kDa) products. the migration rates of some HA1 products differed due to differences in the abundance of glycosylation. LK5 showed relatively high cleavability for the HA of each virus strain. but essentially no cleavage was observed with KLK12 treatment. each peptidase appears to have a preference for particular subtypes. the percentage HA cleavage was determined by densitometry of the Western blot analysis shown in Fig. 1. in the case of trypsin, no cleavage was observed with mutation of the Arg cleavage site. we demonstrated that A/South Carolina/18 HA retains its fusogenic properties. however, in this case, we were unable to determine whether cleavage by each kallikrein produced fusogenic A/WSN/33 HA. a virus infection assay was employed to determine that each kallikrein cleaves HA in a functional manner. each virus was preincubated with KLK5 or KLK12 and incubated with mammalian cells. no increase in infection was observed for KLK12 treatment of influenza. fluorogenic peptides were designed to mimic the consensus cleavage site region of the H1, H2 and H3 subtypes. treatment of each peptide with KLK5 resulted in a similar rate of cleavage, with a slightly higher rate for the peptide derived from A/WSN/33 HA. the peptide mimic was cleaved with relatively similar efficiency as the other peptide mimics but did not cleave H2 HA. however, other factors such as glycosylation and secondary structure may affect the cleavage of the H2 subtype by KLK5. KLK12 activated prourokinase more efficiently compared with KLK5, with a 2-fold difference in cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate by active urokinase. treatment of plasminogen with KLK5 and KLK12 resulted in the most striking difference in activation. plasmin, urokinase, and plasma kallikrein have the ability to cleave and activate viral HA. previous studies have also demonstrated that proteases secreted by certain bacteria have been shown to cleave and activate viral HA. ozone-induced cleavage of HA is not cell-associated. KLK12 cleaved H2 HA with relatively high efficiency, but virtually no cleavage was observed with KLK5 treatment. this result is intriguing because KLK5 cleaved the H2 HA consensus-derived peptide with relatively high efficiency, but did not translate to cleavage of the HA protein. however, other factors such as secondary structure and glycosylation may play a role in H2 HA cleavage. HA was highly sensitive to nonspecific cleavage by membrane-expressed TMPRSS2 and HAT. complete degradation was observed upon coexpression of HA and each protease on the cell surface. it is possible that discrepancies in HA sensitivity to degradation can be explained by expression levels or virus strain differences of the HAs examined. lysine residues (41) may in fact lead to down-regulation of influenza infection. it is possible that the presence of a secreted soluble protease is more compatible with specific cleavage of HA than is the presence of a transmembrane protease. previous reports have demonstrated that the thrombolytic enzymes plasmin, urokinase, and plasma kallikrein have the ability to cleave and activate certain subtype kallikrein-related peptidases 5 and 12 revealed HA subtype specificity. KLK5 cleaving the H1 and H3 subtypes most efficiently. each peptidase appears to have a preference for particular strains within the H1 subtype."}
