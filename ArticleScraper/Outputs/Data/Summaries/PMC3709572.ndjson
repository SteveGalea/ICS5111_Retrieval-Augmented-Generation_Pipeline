{"summary": "the sequencing effort is being driven almost entirely by human clinical significance. the information generated has wide-ranging impact on all areas of virology, from diagnosis to pathogenesis. the first large high-profile genomes were published. the main limitations to the use of these technologies are restricted scalability, cost when applied to large genomes and frequent reliance on prior and specific template amplification by PCR or in bacterial clones. beads and \u2018picotitre\u2019 plate Pyrosequencing 400\u2013700 700 Mb SOLiD Adapters Emulsion PCR Beads on glass slide Ligation 50\u201375 20 Gb Illumina* Adapters Bridge amplification in situ Glass slide hybridization Reversible terminators 25\u2013500 600 Gb Helicos Poly(A) adapter No amplification Flow-cell hybridization Reversible terminators 25\u201355 35 Gb PacBio Hairpin adapters Linear emulsion is formed in a water and oil mixture, thus capturing individual beads and amplification reagents. thermal cycling then results in the emulsion-based clonal amplification of individual molecules. the amplified products are denatured, bound to a sequencing primer and separated into individual wells of a picotitre plate. adapted beads are incorporated into a carefully controlled emulsion. each bubble constitutes a microreactor containing DNA template, primer and reagents for PCR. each bead is coated with clonally amplified molecules. the density of beads can be extremely high, and determine the ultimate number of reads achieved. the density of beads can be extremely high, and determine the ultimate number of reads achieved. sequences are labelled with one of four dyes, leaving any individual dye associated with four primers. the process is repeated from starting primers displaced 2, 3 and 4 nt upstream. each position in the sequence is interrogated twice, leading to high accuracy. a high-resolution digital image is used to determine which nucleotide is incorporated in each molecule. after imaging, the terminator is reversed chemically, allowing the template molecule to be extended again in the next round of sequencing. Helicos sequencing (Helicos Biosciences) has been the first true single-molecule sequencing technology to enter the marketplace. fluorescently labelled nucleotides (one colour for each base) diffuse into the cell from above. the fluorescent label is cleaved (as part of the chemistry of forming the phosphate chain) and diffuses away, allowing the DNA polymerase to continue to incorporate multiple bases per second. dsDNA in solution is first sheared by nebulization or amplified by PCR. fragments are blunt-ended and dephosphorylated, followed by the ligation of two separate adapters. the B adapter is biotinylated, allowing subsequent purification. strength of this system is its read length of approximately 500 bases. it is particularly suitable for amplicon sequencing and bridging across complex sequences. error rate in individual reads of 1 % is mostly attributable to insertions and deletions. the free end of each single-stranded molecule can anneal to a second anchored primer in close spatial proximity. stages (f)\u2013(h) are repeated to generate clonally amplified islands or clusters for subsequent sequencing. SOLiD sequencing starts in a similar way to that described above, with DNA fragmentation, ligation to beads, and emulsion PCR. the density of beads can be extremely high, and determine the ultimate number of reads achieved. sequencing occurs by hybridization and ligation (Fig. 5f) with fluorescently labelled 8mers. each position in the sequence is interrogated twice, leading to high accuracy. oligos serve both to capture the template DNA and as primers for subsequent amplification. successive rounds of PCR result in the generation of tiny islands or clusters of amplified molecules. a single fluorescently labelled dATP is used to capture each template molecule onto a flow cell using oligo(dT) probes. a laser locates bound templates, prior to the cleavage of the fluorescent label. a DNA polymerase and fluorescently labelled, reversible terminator nucleotides are then added sequentially, with imaging detecting each incorporated base. the first stage of Ion Torrent sequencing relies on adding adapters of known sequence to template dsDNA by ligation or PCR. adapters are used to capture the library clonally onto solid particles and then to amplify the target sequences through emulsion PCR. the amplified library is then separated, one bead per well, on a high-density array. emulsion is formed in a water and oil mixture, thus capturing individual beads and amplification reagents. thermal cycling then results in the emulsion-based clonal amplification of individual molecules. the amplified products are denatured, bound to a sequencing primer and separated into individual wells. Adapters are used to capture single molecules of template onto microbeads. each bubble constitutes a microreactor containing DNA template, primer and reagents for PCR. each bead is coated with clonally amplified molecules. the density of beads can be extremely high, and determine the ultimate number of reads achieved. the density of beads can be extremely high, and determine the ultimate number of reads achieved. sequences are labelled with one of four dyes, leaving any individual dye associated with four primers. ligation reactions are repeated from starting primers displaced 2, 3 and 4 nt upstream. each position in the sequence is interrogated twice. a high-resolution digital image is used to determine which nucleotide is incorporated in each molecule. after imaging, the terminator is reversed chemically, allowing the template molecule to be extended again in the next round of sequencing. Helicos sequencing (Helicos Biosciences) is the first true single-molecule sequencing technology to enter the marketplace. fluorescently labelled nucleotides (one colour for each base) diffuse into the cell from above. fluorescent label is cleaved (as part of the chemistry of forming the phosphate chain) and diffuses away, allowing the DNA polymerase to continue to incorporate multiple bases per second. the extent of the change in pH with Ion Torrent sequencing is determined by the number of base incorporations, rendering it sensitive to misreading the length of homopolymers. it is also important to take advice from local service providers. for those looking to assemble complex genomes de novo, longer read lengths may be appropriate. libraries of different samples can be mixed and sequenced together based on unique sequence tags in their adapters. the template nucleic acid must be purified, whether it be RNA or DNA. in all cases, the best starting material contains little other genetic information, such as cerebrospinal fluid and serum. in each experiment, there is a clear trade-off between sample purity and time/cost for purification. each project needs assessment on its own values. key processes in the pipeline are quality scoring, sequence assembly and annotation. paired-end libraries can be built informatically into genome \u2018scaffolds\u2019. paired-end libraries can be built informatically into genome \u2018scaffolds\u2019. genomes are relatively small, but their academic value is often extremely high. 457 ORFs were predicted to encode proteins ranging from 50 to 1537 aa. the genome repertoire of the virus was composed of typical NCLDV core genes. a powerful way to compare family members of large genomes is by comparing the ancestral gene set. phylogenetic analyses based on partial sequence information can never pick up the full complexity of historical recombination events that often lead to pandemic emergence. but more recently, methods have been described based on pooling of segment-specific PCRs obtained directly from clinical material. the remaining challenge is to reduce time for sequence production to a point where sequence information can be used routinely in real time. many RNA viruses are believed to exist at the sample level, not as a single sequence but as a collection of closely related variants. this diversity represents a massive reserve on which selection can occur and from which fitter variants can emerge rapidly. this has led the world health organization to establish a global strategy for the prevention and assessment of human immunodeficiency virus drug resistance. in one study of HIV population mutations, ultradeep pyrosequencing detected on average seven times more variants than conventional methods. all variants present in 3 % of genomes and 57 % of variants present in 3 % of genomes confirmed by limiting-dilution sequencing. the methodology is starting to shed new light on other areas of viral pathogenesis where minor population variants may also be highly significant. studies using NGS to dissect the dynamics of transmission have shed new light on differences between resistance acquired by transmission and that which has evolved within the patient. such an approach is likely to generate new insights into the roles of previously understudied viral genes in pathogenesis. the availability of NGS has allowed these metagenomes to be analysed in unbiased ways at previously unseen resolution. the threat of newly emerging viruses to important species remains ever-present. the rate of discovery of new virus infections has remained largely unchanged over many decades. random PCR or degenerative coronavirus primers amplified the first SARS coronavirus sequences. the first sequences were published electronically in the new England journal of medicine on 10 April 2003. on 5 July 2003, the WHO declared the SARS outbreak contained. rapid pathogen discovery is now accessible to all outbreaks, regardless of the profile of the disease. the identification of viral sequences in clinical material is far from showing an association with disease (Lipkin, 2009) a new paper has described the use of blood-feeding mosquitos as a way of sampling a broad range of viral diversity. a review of ocean viromes suggests that the sea is dominated by rare genes, many of which might be contained within virus-like entities. sensitivity of NGS can detect rare viral transcripts at frequencies lower than 1 in 1 000 000. key steps in the process include isolation of RNA and removal of host genomic DNA. rRNA is also removed by selection of polyadenylated RNA or removal of rRNA with antisense oligos. analysis of RNA-seq data is usually achieved by mapping sequence reads to a reference genome. software that can map reads over gene splice junctions can be used to quantify relative levels of expression. RNA-seq has identified a new role for palindromic sequences in transcription termination, as well as identification new ORFs. NGS provides a new way to explore the role of microRNAs in virus replication and pathogenesis. these short RNA molecules of about 21\u201322 bases in length function as negative regulators of mRNA translation. the role of microRNAs is now being explored in several viral systems. genome sequencing is a highly efficient way of sequencing viral genomes. the genome is a circular dsDNA molecule of 368 454 bp. the coding sequences represented 89 % of the genome. the need for genome sequencing of these viruses has been driven by the emergence of H5N1 and an H1N1 pandemic. the need for genome sequencing of these viruses has been driven by the emergence of H5N1 (H\u00f6per et al., 2009) and an H1N1 pandemic. a major bottleneck to our understanding of the emergence and transmission of these important viruses. the remaining challenge is to reduce time for sequence production to a point where sequence information can be used routinely in real time to aid health protection agencies in the control of outbreaks. minor population variants harbouring resistance mutations can be rapidly selected for, leading to failure of antiviral therapy. this has led the world health organization to establish a global strategy for the prevention and assessment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug resistance. the global Influenza Surveillance and Response System has been closely monitoring the evolution of influenza viruses infecting humans. in 3 % of genomes confirmed by limiting-dilution sequencing. limitation to this detection threshold is driven both by error rates of polymerases used and by pyrosequencing errors around homopolymers. error rates associated with reverse transcription have not been included, so this represents an important area for future research. studies using NGS to dissect transmission dynamics shed new light on differences between resistance acquired by transmission and that which has evolved within the patient. such an approach is likely to generate new insights into the roles of previously understudied viral genes in pathogenesis. the most high-profile recent example of this was the SARS coronavirus. the new respiratory syndrome was first reported by the WHO on 14 March 2003(Anonymous, 2003) in 2008, an outbreak of unexplained haemorrhagic fever in people was reported in south africa. over the following 2 weeks, secondary and tertiary cases were reported. such outbreaks are highly emotive events, necessitating a rapid response to control both infection and public anxiety. small case\u2013control studies have sought to compare metagenomes in health and disease, including in cystic fibrosis and chronic fatigue syndrome. cost will currently limit such an approach to those diseases where a single pathogen is perhaps unlikely. traditional methods will be employed to seek proof of an association between any newly discovered virus and disease. a recent paper has described the use of blood-feeding mosquitos as a way of sampling a broad range of viral diversity. a review of ocean viromes suggests that the sea is dominated by rare genes. the same study predicted a wealth of DNA viruses belonging to the eukaryotic NCLDVs. the rate of discovery of new virus infections has remained largely unchanged over many decades. in humans, although viruses currently make up a small proportion of known human diseases, they make up the majority of newly identified ones. in 2008, an outbreak of unexplained haemorrhagic fever in people was reported in south africa. over the following 2 weeks, secondary and tertiary cases were reported, with four of the five patients dying. rapid pathogen discovery is now accessible to all outbreaks, regardless of the profile of the disease. the identification of viral sequences in clinical material is far from showing an association with disease. but cost will currently limit such an approach to those diseases where a single pathogen is unlikely. traditional methods will be employed to seek proof of an association between any newly discovered virus and disease. a recent paper has described the use of blood-feeding mosquitos as a way of sampling a broad range of viral diversity. a review of ocean viromes suggests that the sea is dominated by rare genes, many of which might be contained within virus-like entities such as gene-transfer agents. sensitivity of NGS can detect rare viral transcripts at frequencies lower than 1 in 1 000 000. other areas of science are turning increasingly to the transcriptome, the measurement of mRNA, to achieve new insights into genome expression. key steps in the process firstly include isolation of RNA and removal of host genomic DNA. RNA-seq has identified a new role for palindromic sequences in transcription termination. in mimiviruses, RNA-seq has identified a new role for palindromic sequences in transcription termination. new insight has been made into the role of viral gene expression in Epstein\u2013Barr virus latency. cytomegalovirus (Stark et al., 2012), cytomegalovirus (Stark et al., 2012), transformation in Marek\u2019s disease virus (Burnside et al., 2011) and grapevine pathology (Pantaleo et al., 2010) the study of pathogenesis has been heavily driven by targeted analysis of specific genes or pathways thought to be critical to disease progression. devices could be available in clinics very rapidly afterward. democratization will bring NGS sequencing into more research laboratories. new opportunities for personalized medicine will be revealed."}
