{"summary": "negative sense single strand RNA virus human metapneumovirus (hMPV) has emerged as a commonly detected respiratory tract pathogen involved in airway disease mainly affecting young children. hMPV infections in the lower respiratory tract resulting in bronchiolitis or pneumonia are occasionally observed [8,9]. several NLR proteins have been identified including NLRP3. this is involved in the antiviral response to respiratory tract viruses. we also determined the expression of genes involved in the inflammasome-mediated antiviral response. all NPAs (including those from the control group) were collected in virus transport media (Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution with 1% bovine serum albumin and fungizone) without antibiotics. cultures were evaluated for signs of CPE possibly caused by pathogens not detected by PCR-assays. rhinitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis and/or otitis media (serous, simplex or purulent) were found without signs of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) LRTI was divided in bronchiolitis (age 2 years, tachypnea, retractions, wheezing, crepitations), obstructive bronchitis (age >2 years, signs of lower airway obstruction), asthma exacerbation with signs n = 30 Controls, n = 10 P-value Age (months) 17.5 (0.7\u201391.9) 34.5 (3.9\u201357.4) 0.12a Male gender (number) 18 8 0.25b Diagnoses (number) Upper and lower respiratory tract infection 20 Classification of lower respiratory infection 1.

Unspecified LRTI 2 Length qPCR was performed using Perfecta SYBR Green reaction mix (Quanta) and a StepOnePlus instrument (Life Technologies) with the temperature profile 95\u00b0C for 20 s, 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 3s and 60\u00b0C for 30s. data was plotted as box-plots where the box represents 50% of the values. the horizontal line indicates the median, whiskers show the maximum and minimum values. the study was approved by the regional committee for medical and health research ethics (REK, Mid-Norway) caregivers of all patients and controls received written information about the study. written consent was obtained from the caregivers of all controls and the majority of the patients included in the cohort. nucleic acid was extracted using NucliSENS easyMAG according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (bioMerieux) all PCRs were in-house real-time assays based on TaqMan probes. for hMPV detection, primers targeting the N-gene were used as described elsewhere. bronchiolitis (age 2 years, tachypnea, retractions, wheezing, crepitations), obstructive bronchitis (age >2 years, signs of lower airway obstruction), asthma exacerbation with signs of lower airway obstruction, and pneumonia (cough, tachypnea, localized crepitations, x-ray infiltrates) a clinical severity score previously used to determine hMPV/RSV disease severity in children mRNA quantification cDNA was synthesized from RNA isolated from the collected NPAs using the qScript kit. data was plotted as box-plots where the box represents 50% of the values, the horizontal line indicates the median, and the closed circles indicate outliers. the concentrations of proteins in the plasma fraction were measured using a bio-Plex multiplex system (Bio-Rad) data analysis Categorical variables were analyzed with the Pearson chi-square test or the 2-tailed Fisher\u2019s exact test. a two-sided P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. the majority of the children were diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infection (bronchiolitis or pneumonia) one half of the patients had more severe disease with a score higher than zero. the length of hospitalization was average 4.14.2 days for A2 and 3.12.0 days for B2 infected children (P>0.05, Student\u2019s t-test) data was plotted as box-plots where the box represents 50% of the values. the horizontal line indicates the median, whiskers show the maximum and minimum values, and the closed circles indicate outliers. we wanted to investigate the possible involvement of NF-B and inflammasome-associated genes in response to hMPV infection. differences in gene expression for individual A2 and B2 positive patients are outlined in Fig 3. most of the patients with upregulation of IB, IL-1 and NLRP3 had increased expression of all three genes in hMPV infected children. mRNA expression of IL-1 and NLRP3 were more frequently upregulated in children with a severity score of 1\u20134 compared to those with more serious disease and a higher severity score. the concentration of several secreted cytokines in blood plasma was measured for a random subset of the patients (n = 10) and the controls (n = 10). data was plotted as box-plots where the box represents 50% of the values. the horizontal line indicates the median, whiskers show the maximum and minimum values, and the closed circles indicate outliers. the lack of increased IL-28 protein in blood could be explained by a lag in the induction of protein synthesis. the expression of IL-28 has been shown to be triggered by viral infection, and it displays immunological properties similar to the type I IFN-/ [23]. elevated levels of IP-10 protein, and also of the chemokines Gro- and Gro- were found in blood plasma. expression of IP-10 may be induced by IFN- [28], IFN-/ [29] or TNF- [30] secreted by different immune-cells. lack of IFN- detection in hMPV infected children has also recently been reported elsewhere. TNF- production has previously been shown to be at high levels in nasopharyngeal secretions from RS- or influenza-virus infected children. the presence of TNF- in the respiratory tract directly or indirectly affects the severity of disease in hMPV infected children. the antiviral cytokine ISG54 was expressed at the highest relative levels of any of the genes included in this study. the expression of ISGs is initiated by type I and type III interferons such as IFN- and IL-28. NF-B induces mRNA expression of the potent pro-inflammatory cytokines pro-IL-1 and pro-IL-18. increased levels of NLRP3 mRNA in this group of children could suggest that the NLRP3-inflammasome is activated to produce IL-1 and IL-18 in the respiratory tract of these patients. the average age of children with severity score 1\u20134 was not significantly different from those with severity score zero (P = 0.28, Student\u2019s t-test), indicating that the youngest children where not more disposed to severe disease compared to the older. the controls were symptom-free and screened for the same airway pathogens as the patient samples, and no pathogens were detected. the samples based on the two most frequent hMPV genotypes enabled us to see if there was a genotype-specific cytokine gene expression profile or differences in disease severity. this allowed us to study the initial host immune response towards particular hMPV genotypes. however, our selection criteria limited the total number of patients eligible for our study."}
