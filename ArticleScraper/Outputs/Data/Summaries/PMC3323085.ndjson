{"summary": "study population comprised all probable SARS patients whose cases were reported to the department of health on or before may 16, 2003 (n = 1,690) radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia and current temperature >38\u00b0C or a history of such at any time in the preceding 2 days. the criteria for cases are equivalent to those in the world health organization\u2019s case definition for probable SARS cases (7). the index case-patients were asked whether they were hospital workers, inpatients before contracting SARS, or residents of the Amoy Gardens. the rest of the index case-patients were classified into the known sources group. random telephone numbers were selected from up-to-date local telephone directories. at least three calls were made before an unanswered call was considered as a noncontact. a proxy, who was most familiar with the family situation, was interviewed. 727 cases-patients belonged in one of the four categories (61% of 1,192 cases) another 240 (20.1%) had come into contact with a SARS patient within a 10-day period before onset of fever. for 347 (29.1%) participants, the source was undefined. 212 cases of the undefined source group had visited at least one of the above-mentioned categories of places. patients were more likely than controls to have visited the amoy gardens. NS - % contacted someone with fever or influenza (reference=no) 9.0 6.4 1.42 (0.87 to 2.32) NS - % social contact with medical personnel (reference=no) 7.6 8.6 0.87 (0.44 to 1.31) NS - % disinfected the living quarters thoroughly (reference=no) 46.6 74.5 0.30 (0.23 to 0.39)e 0.41 (0.29 to 0.58) 0.001 Washed members of the case-patient and control groups were not statistically different in the percentage of having come into contact with someone with influenzalike symptoms. the two groups were also not different in the likelihood of having social contact with someone who had visited a hospital (8.2% vs. 5.2%, OR = 1.66, p > 0.05) using a mask frequently in public places (OR = 7.63, p 0.001), washing one\u2019s hands >10 times a day (OR = 0.58, p = 0.008), disinfecting the living quarters thoroughly (OR = 0.41, p 0.001) during the reference period were significant protective factors. 22 questionnaires (1.8%) were incomplete and did not allow us to classify the respondents into groups according to source of transmission. 192 (16.1%) had probable cases of secondary or tertiary household transmission. another 317 of 1,192 cases were hospital workers; 170 (14.3%) lived in the Amoy Gardens; 58 (4.9%) were inpatients who had been hospitalized for diseases other than SARS. patients were more likely than controls to have visited mainland China. patients were also more likely than controls to have visited the Amoy Gardens. 212 cases of the undefined source group had visited at least one of the above-mentioned categories of places. Frequency of visiting crowded places was, however, not significant in the univariate analysis. NS - % disinfected the living quarters thoroughly (reference=no) 46.6 74.5 0.30 (0.23 to 0.39)e 0.41 (0.29 to 0.58) 0.001 Washed hands 11 or more times per day (reference=1\u201310 times/day) 18.4 33.7 0.44 (0.31 to 0.63)e 0.58 (0.38 to 0.87) 0.008 aN.S., not significant. members of the case group were less likely than members of the control group to have frequently worn a face mask in public venues. using a mask frequently in public places (OR = 0.27, p 0.001), washing one\u2019s hands >10 times a day (OR = 0.58, p = 0.008) and disinfecting the living quarters thoroughly (OR = 0.41, p 0.001) during the reference period were significant protective factors. 212 patients who had visited some particular places associated with risk for transmission were removed from the analysis. the three public health variables\u2014frequently wearing a mask in public places (adjusted OR = 0.36, p 0.001), washing hands >10 times a day (adjusted OR = 0.44, p = 0.008) and disinfecting the living quarters thoroughly (adjusted OR = 0.44, p = 0.008)\u2014remained significant protective factors. of the 330 undefined transmissions, 44.2% of the transmissions occurred through hospital visitors. a study on household transmission also indicated that hospital visits were a significant risk factor for predicting household secondary infection. cross-border transmission played a role in the epidemic; the absolute percentage is not high among the 1,192 case-patients. the number of community-acquired cases in less populated cities should be much lower than that of Hong Kong. this finding should be interpreted with care as >90% of the general public wore face masks in public places, and >85% avoided visits to public places during the epidemic. the study has a few limitations as well as strengths. approximately 72% of all SARS case-patients were included in the study. the study also has strength of matching for age, sex, and reference time. public health measures may have contributed to the control of SARS epidemic in Hong Kong."}
