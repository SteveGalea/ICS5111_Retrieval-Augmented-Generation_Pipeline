{"summary": "all herpesviruses use a combination of gB and the heterodimer gH/gL to carry out virus-cell fusion. current evidence indicates that gB is the fusion protein (1\u20134) gB is the receptor-binding protein gD. the atomic structure of postfusion gB shows a subunit with five structural domains (domains I to V), four of which are similar to those of other class III fusion proteins (1, 7\u20139) the trimer appears as a rod with three distinguishable lobes (6, 10\u201313), to which we refer as the base, middle, and crown. FR1 includes structural domains I and V and forms the base of the gB trimer. Mutations within the FLs block virus entry and egress, as well as cell-cell fusion and virus spread (15\u201318). gB binds to liposomes via the fusion loops of FR1 (13). the two FLs within FR1 constitute a \u201csubdomain\u201d wherein key hydrophobic amino acids form a ridge that is supported on both sides by charged residues. hypothesize that the hydrophobic residues interact with target membranes (13, 15, 16), helping gB to form the fusion pore. SS55 binds to the base of gB (FR1), a finding that assigns its epitope to domain I. this epitope was further narrowed by generating and sequencing MAb-resistant mutants. the Fabs for both SS55 and SS144 neutralized virus and impaired liposome binding in vitro. 293T cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) gB1(730t), gB2(727t) and gB1(773t) were purified from baculovirus-infected insect (Sf9) cells by using a DL16 immunosorbent column as described previously (27\u201329). 300 g g gB1(730t) was incubated with 100 g gB1(730t) in a 250-l total volume (PBS) at room temperature (RT) for 1 h. gB-Fab complex eluted from the column at fractions 13 to 15 (0.5 ml per fraction) monoclonal antibody-resistant (mar) viruses were generated according to the protocol outlined by Cairns et al. (34). plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 to 4 days. a second round of MAb selection followed by plaque purification. samples were adjusted to 200 mM Tris (pH 8), 50 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 100 g/ml proteinase K. samples were extracted twice with phenol-chloroform (24:1), ethanol precipitated, and dissolved in sterile water. gB-specific IgGs were eluted with 3 ml of 0.1 M ethanolamine (pH 11.5) gel was washed with 50 to 100 ml of 0.001 N HCl at RT for 1 h. gB-specific IgGs were eluted with 3 ml of 0.1 M ethanolamine. 12-well plates seeded with 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing mutant or WT gB. cells were lysed using 5% NP-40\u2013PBS. each well of a 96-well plate was washed 3 times with PBS. the plate was then blocked with 5% milk-PBS-0.05% Tween (T) for 30 min. 50 microliters of each peptide at 1 M (in PBS) were placed in each well of a 96-well plate. the wells were washed and incubated for an additional 1 h at 37\u00b0C. antibodies detected using an HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. purified soluble gB(730t) (10 g/ml) was then injected for 240 s. 1 g of soluble gB was then incubated with 50 g of antibody. gB-Ab mixture was then flowed across a liposome-covered chip for 240 s. gB-specific MAbs C226, DL16, SS10, SS55, SS63, and SS144 have been characterized previously (14, 19) to prepare Fabs for EM, gB-Fab complexes were digested by immobilized papain overnight at 37\u00b0C. purified gB-Fab samples (15 g/ml) were adsorbed onto grids bearing a carbon-coated support film, negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate, and imaged with a CM120 transmission electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR) the nominal magnification was 60,000 (0.33 nm/pixel) pPEP98 (wild-type [WT] gB) and pCAGGS/MCS were gifts from P. Spear. pCW1029 (R335Q) and pCW1028 (A203T) were generated by PCR amplification of the gB open reading frame. Plasmid pBH805 (D199A) was created using QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene Cloning Systems) (37) with pPEP98 as the template. gB genes in each plasmid were sequenced to screen out PCR errors. gB-specific IgGs were eluted with 3 ml of 0.1 M ethanolamine (pH 11.5) each well of a 96-well plate was washed 3 times with PBS. the plate was then coated with 50 l of PAb R242 (10 g/ml) for 2 h. gB-MAb binding was detected by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase antibody for 30 min at a dilution of 1:200 in 5% milk-PBS-T. the plate was then blocked with 5% milk-PBS-0.05% Tween (T) for 30 min, followed by addition of the MAbs to be tested (10 g/ml in 5% milk-PBS-T) liposomes were injected until the chip was saturated, giving a signal of approximately 8,000 response units (RU) liposomes remained on the chip and there was no appreciable dissociation (no measurable off-rate) RESULTS FR1 is located at the base of postfusion gB. it contains two fusion loops (termed FL1 and FL2) per protomer. many of those with epitopes that map within this broad region block cell-cell fusion and prevent gB from associating with liposomes. however, the mechanism of action of MAbs in each of these events is unknown (2, 14, 16, 20) gB1(730t)-SS55 Fab complex were pooled, concentrated, and used for EM studies. gB1(730t)-SS55 Fab complex was pooled, concentrated, and pooled. gB1(730t)-SS55 Fab complex was pooled, concentrated, and used for EM studies. the location of the SS10 epitope (Fig. 4D) within the crown (FR3) agrees with the results of mapping done with gB truncation constructs. the binding of MAb SS10 was previously localized via a series of deletion mutants to a region spanning aa 234 to 472 (14), which included portions of both FR1 and FR2. EM data clearly show that DL16 binds to the base of gB within FR1. DL16 competes with MAb H1817, which binds within the first 43 amino acids of the gB N terminus (FR4) (14). FR4 residues may stretch downward (with respect to the solved structure) EM analysis of SS63 Fab-gB definitively places the epitope for this MAb in the crown of gB (FR3). the original mapping of the epitope of MAb SS63 relied solely on peptide binding data. SS55 and SS144 Fabs bind on the \u201cside\u201d of the base and not at its apex, where the FLs are located. gB cells in the presence or absence of SS55 revealed two different amino acid changes. in one mutant, there was an A-to-T change at residue 203; in the other, an R-to-Q change at residue 335. these two amino acids lie close to each other in domain I of the postfusion structure. we mutated Asp199 to Ala in a cell extract containing full-length gB. we then determined how well each MAb bound to gB-A203T, gB-R335Q, and gB-D199A. SS144 failed to bind to any of the SS55 mar proteins. anti-FR1 MAb, 2c, has been shown to neutralize virus via IgG cross-linking. Fabs generated from this MAb did not inhibit virus infection. we used a liposome flotation assay to demonstrate inhibition. when gB was preincubated with either SS55 or SS144 Fabs, binding was reduced to 25% that of WT gB. blocking could be caused by an indirect effect, such as a structural alteration upon MAb binding that affects FL position. FR1 neutralizing epitopes remain accessible on lipid-bound gB. gB binding to liposomes was seen as an increase in RU. gB binding to liposomes was seen as an increase in RU. arrowheads along the x axis show where each injection was stopped. SS10, SS55, and SS144 were injected at a concentration of 75 g/ml. DL16 was injected at a concentration of 75 g/ml. SS55 and SS144 Fabs neutralize better than their respective IgGs. if IgG cross-linking plays a role in the function of these antibodies, then neutralization by the full IgG would be better than that seen for the Fab. IgGs of MAbs SS55 and SS144 neutralized virus well. each Fab inactivated the infectivity of 50% of the input virus. the 50% neutralization point for each Fab was 0.6 g/ml. this is an 8- to 30-fold increase in potency over that of parental IgGs. anti-FL2p IgG reacted with two peptides corresponding to FL2. each gB2 peptide (x axis) is 20 residues long and has a 10-residue overlap with peptides on either side. the sequence of each FL is identical for gB1 and gB2 (1). anti-FL2p can bind lipid-bound gB and neutralize virus infectivity. a portion of FL2 and possibly the FL1 of gB(730t) is exposed even when the protein is bound to lipid. anti-FL2p IgG neutralized virus in a dose-dependent manner (50% neutralization at 40 g/ml) a PAb generated against the FL2 peptide neutralized virus suggests that the FLs are accessible to antibody on gB that is within the virus envelope at the time of infection. gB1(730t) (A) and gB1(730t)-SS55 Fab (B) are negatively stained low-magnification fields of gB1(730t)-SS55 Fab (B) some representative particles of each sample are circled. bar, 50 nm. the EM data clearly show that the epitope of MAb SS55 is within the base of gB (i.e., FR1). however, the EM data prove that the epitope is within the base of gB (i.e., FR1). FR4 was not part of the gB ectodomain that was crystallized. FR4 residues may stretch downward (with respect to the solved structure), thereby accounting for competition with DL16. EM analysis of SS63 Fab-gB definitively places epitope for this MAb in the crown of gB (FR3) SS144 was previously mapped via overlapping peptides and surface availability to a linear stretch of residues in FR1 (residues 715 to 725) (14). two separate mar viruses were obtained, both of which infected Vero cells in the presence or absence of SS55. the percentage of WT absorbance was calculated as follows: (absorbance of test sample at 405 nm/absorbance of WT sample) 100. we cloned both of these gB mutants into expression plasmids. anti-FR1 antibodies inhibit gB-liposome association by using a biosensor-based liposome binding assay (27). this postfusion form of gB associates with liposomes in vitro via the FLs (13), and this association is altered by either (i) mutations to residues in the FLs (15, 16), (ii) the presence of the membrane-proximal region (MPR; residues 731 to 773) (27), or (i presence of C226 IgG or Fabs did not block binding of gB to liposomes. gB-liposome association was reduced to 20% that of WT gB. blocking could be caused by an indirect effect, such as a structural alteration upon MAb binding that affects FL position. gB plus Fab or IgG flowing across liposomes only (no gB) subtracted from curves. percentage of gB bound was calculated based on maximum binding after 240 s. steric hindrance plays a role in the ability of SS55 and SS144 to block binding of gB to liposomes. liposomes are injected into the L1 chip to saturation (8,000 RU) soluble gB(730t) is then injected at 5 l/min for 240 s, followed by the indicated antibody (240 s) binding to liposomes is measured as an increase in RU. gB(730t), a soluble postfusion form of gB, is a soluble postfusion form of gB. SS55 and SS144 Fabs neutralize better than their respective IgGs. if IgG cross-linking plays a role, then neutralization by the full IgG would be better than that seen for the Fab. gG concentrations used were corrected by assuming that 1 g of Fab equals 1.5 g of IgG. in this case, both forms of the antibody neutralized virus infectivity are the same as or less than that of its parental IgG (43\u201346). Fab activity is either the same as or less than that of its parental IgG (43\u201346). anti-FL2p peptides are identical for gB1 and gB2 (1). the sequence of each FL is identical for gB1 and gB2 (1). the sequence of each FL is identical for gB1 and gB2 (1). each gB2 peptide (x axis) is 20 residues long and has a 10-residue overlap with peptides on either side. anti-FL2p IgG reacted with two peptides corresponding to FL2 (Fig. 9C) but also reacted with two peptides corresponding to FL1. anti-FL2p IgG neutralized virus in a dose-dependent manner (50% neutralization at 40 g/ml) anti-FL2p IgG neutralized virus in a dose-dependent manner (50% neutralization at 40 g/ml) a PAb generated against the FL2 neutralized virus suggests the FLs are accessible to antibody on gB that is within the virus envelope at the time of infection. we used EM to visualize the actual location of Fabs for antibodies binding to three of the four FR. these studies confirmed the locations of four antibodies chosen as representatives (SS10 in the crown of gB [FR3], C226 in the middle lobe [FR2], and SS55 and SS144 in the base [FR1]). the crown and the middle lobe are larger than the atomic model suggests. this indicates that the N terminus likely extends toward the base of the protein, interacting with domains IV, III, and II. this indicates that the N terminus likely extends toward the base of the protein, interacting with domains IV, III, and II. SS55 and SS144 block binding of gB to liposomes. both Fabs block binding of gB to liposomes. binding of one MAb blocks the other by steric hindrance. the binding of SS55 or SS144 to its epitope could have an allosteric effect on the FLs. the EM data show that when SS55 and SS144 bind to soluble gB, the Fabs are angled slightly downward, toward the base. SS55, SS144, and SS144 neutralize virus significantly better than their parental IgGs. it is intriguing that the Fabs for SS55 and SS144 neutralize virus significantly better than their parental IgGs. the epitopes of SS55 and SS144 are more accessible to Fabs than full-sized IgG. an antibody against an FL2 peptide was neutralizing for both HSV-1 and HSV-2. this suggests that some portion of the FLs or the surrounding residues are exposed on full-length gB when it is in the viral membrane. anti-FL2p binds to gB(730t) when the latter is bound to liposomes, indicating that the extended surface in the fusion patch does not prevent the FLs from contacting antibodies. anti-FR1 Fabs, including anti-FL2p or a monoclonal antibody to the FL2 peptide, will try to trap a prefusion form of gB. the EM study confirmed the locations of four antibodies chosen as representatives. the SS63 epitope was assigned to FR1 (14), but EM clearly shows that it binds to the gB crown at the other end of the molecule. Vitu et al. (10) have suggested that DL16 binds to FR1 (residues 678 to 730 of structural domain V) based on its inability to bind C-terminal gB truncation constructs, our competition data showed that it competes with MAb H1817, known to bind within FR4. epitope mapping data for MAbs SS10, C226, SS144, and DL16 have been published previously (10, 14) the epitope for MAb SS63 is localized to the crown via EM of gB-Fab complexes, and its residues are unknown. however, we rarely saw clear-cut examples of decoration with three Fabs (Fig. 3B and 4) SS144 binds to a conformation- and trimer-specific epitope that localizes to structural domain V. but these two antibodies compete for binding to the postfusion soluble form of gB. DL16 also binds within the base and does not hinder the binding of either SS55 or SS144. a subset of the FLs of the trimer are inserted into the liposome. the remainder are exposed for antibody binding. this is consistent with the EM data showing that many gB molecules have fewer than three Fabs binding. antiviral activity of MAb 2c is a consequence of gB cross-linking. the addition of secondary antibodies to the Fab restores its neutralization activity to near-IgG levels. this is not the case for C226 (FR2), whose Fab neutralizes virus to the same extent as its parental IgG. the nature of the prefusion form of gB remains elusive. in virions, the FLs are likely exposed to the environment prior to the onset of fusion, i.e., when gB is in a prefusion or intermediate form. in the future, we plan to test anti-FL2p against our panel of FL mutants.
