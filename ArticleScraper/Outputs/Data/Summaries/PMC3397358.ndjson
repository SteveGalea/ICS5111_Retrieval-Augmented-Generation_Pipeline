{"summary": "avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV), human coronavirus 229E, equine arteritis virus (EAV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome arterivirus (PRRSV) are important pathogens of both human and animals. coronaviral and arteriviral infections in farms have resulted in large-scale economic losses in farming nations. peritonitis virus (FIPV) may induce lethal diseases in cats. canine coronavirus (CCoV) infections, which cause canine enteric illness in dogs, are prevalent as well. an infection or outbreak can cause severe economic losses from the death of young offspring. nidoviruses are unable to provide complete cross-protection among the various serotypes of each virus. the vaccines are unable to provide complete cross-protection among the various serotypes of each virus. Virus-host interplay occurs at multiple points during the virus replication cycle, from entry to exit. the nature of such interactions can range from a simple exploitation of existing host machinery to destructive interactions that modulate the host environment to the advantage of the virus while inhibiting host activities. one of the most important interactions between virus and host is the modulation of host cell environment. nidoviruses regulate host innate immune and stress responses, cell cycle, autophagy and cell death pathways. nidoviruses also regulate host antiviral defense mechanisms. nidoviruses also regulate the differential expression of host genes. cytochrome c binds the apoptotic protease-activating factor (Apaf1) together, they form an apoptosome that leads to the release of active caspase 9. the Bcl-2 family of proteins constitutes a critical control point in the regulation of apoptosis. BH3-only and Bax-like proteins are essential initiators of apoptosis. caspase 4, a nearly identical paralogue of the rodent form of caspase 12, has also been shown to possess comparable roles in ER-stressed apoptosis. p53 and the Bcl-2 family of proteins have been shown to be the main mediators that induce the beleaguered cell to undergo self-induced death at various stages of the infection cycle. an increasing number of known viruses from different families have been found to induce apoptosis during their infection cycle. apoptosis may contribute to the cytotoxicity associated with virus infections. coronaviruses and arteriviruses regulate apoptosis during infection. extrinsic signals from receptors culminate in the activation of caspase 8 for the downstream activation of caspase 3. intrinsic signaling requires the participation of the mitochondria in releasing cytochrome c to activate caspase 9. key proteins in the intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway are p53, both pro-apoptotic (e.g., Bax, Bak) and anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2 the effects of these pathways on the regulation of other host defenses will be discussed in later paragraphs. the unique SARS-CoV encoded protein, 7a, was discovered to have caspase-dependent, pro-apoptotic functions. TGEV accessory gene 7, present only in coronaviruses classified under genus 1 [52], thwarts virulence and host-induced antiviral mechanisms. cytochrome c binds the apoptotic protease-activating factor (Apaf1) together, they form an apoptosome that leads to the release of active caspase 9. a third apoptotic pathway, induced by prolonged endoplasmic reticulum stress, has also been shown to activate multiple downstream apoptotic pathways. caspase 4, a nearly identical paralogue of the rodent form of caspase 12, has also been shown to possess comparable roles in ER-stressed apoptosis. p53 and the Bcl-2 family of proteins have been shown to be the main mediators that induce the beleaguered cell to undergo self-induced death at various stages of the infection cycle. an increasing number of known viruses from different families have been found to induce apoptosis during their infection cycle. apoptosis may possibly contribute to the cytotoxicity associated with virus infections. coronaviruses and arteriviruses regulate apoptosis during infection. anti-apoptotic proteins (black oval) listed are key anti-apoptotic members from the Bcl-2 family of proteins. other pathways triggered by coronavirus infections, such as ER stress and DNA damage response, activate apoptosis signaling pathways. the effects of these pathways on the regulation of other host defenses will be discussed in later paragraphs. the unique SARS-CoV encoded protein, 7a, was discovered to have caspase-dependent, pro-apoptotic functions. TGEV accessory gene 7, present only in coronaviruses, thwarts virulence and host-induced antiviral mechanisms through the negative modulation of downstream caspase-dependent apoptotic pathways. the first line of defense is the mounting of an innate immune response. the cytokine family of interferons is dedicated to the conveyance of the presence of infection, as well as the expedition of numerous connections among the cells that provide protection against foreign pathogens. pattern recognition receptors (PPRs) detect viral infection through identification of various pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) families include the toll-like receptor (TLR), RIG-like helicase (RLH) and Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLRs) families. the expression of TLRs appear to be cell-specific and is found in antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DCs the RLH family of purely cytoplasmic PRRs is made up of retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I or DDX58), melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA5 or IFIH1) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) the notion of NLR-mediated recognition of coronaviruses is probable and could be further investigated. the two PRRs sense cytoplasmic dsRNA, which the host recognizes as \u2018non-self\u2019, via the N-terminal CARDs [71], but the two PRRs each sense distinct PAMPs, depending on the length of viral dsRNA from different RNA viruses. the host also recognizes picornaviruses and noroviruses [72,73] the best characterized type I IFNs can be classified into two major groups, the immediate-early genes (such as IFN) that are triggered by the initial response to virus infection. IRF3 and IRF7 play vital roles in activating innate immune response through their respective antiviral response. the transcriptional co-activator cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREBP) translocates to the nucleus and binds to DNA to trigger the transcription and expression of immediate-early IFNs. this leads to the formation of a STAT1-STAT2 heterodimer that teams up with the interferon regulatory DNA binding factor IRF9. this together constitute an activated heterotrimeric factor, the interferon-stimulated gene transcription PRRSV appears to be receptive to both IFN- (porcine IFN-, or Ad5-pIFN-) and - (recombinant swine beta interferon, or swIFN-beta) dose-dependent treatment. but pigs infected with PRRSV do not evoke significant IFN responses. a deficiency in, or the cleavage of, MAVS from the mitochondrial membrane results in an arrested antiviral immune response. MAVS can also induce apoptosis independently of Type I IFN activation, with SARS-CoV non-structural protein 15 identified as an inhibitor of MAVS-induced apoptosis to escape host antiviral immune responses. drocytes bind viral replicative/transcriptive intermediates when latter should have been isolated by the double membrane vesicles. MHV infection can also delay ISG-activated ISG induction. detecting by the PRRs would activate signaling cascades leading to the production of type I IFNs. de-ubiquitinates TANKbinding kinase 1 (TBK1), the activating kinase for IRF3 and IRF3 itself, and sequesters the hypo-phosphorylated TBK1-IRF3 complex in the cytoplasm. this prevents IRF3 nuclear translocation, thereby inhibiting the transcription of type I interferons [123] the first line of defense is the mounting of an innate immune response, as characterized by the increased production of type I interferons. these choreograph the expression of downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and activate several signaling pathways, all of which collaboratively lead to the induction of a protective antiviral state. interferons induce natural Killer (NK) cells and macrophages to \u2018kill\u2019 or engulf infected cells. pattern recognition receptors (PPRs) detect viral infection through identification of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. PPR families include the toll-like receptor (TLR), RIG-like helicase (RLH) and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLRs) families. expression of TLRs appear to be cell-specific and is found in antigen-presenting cells. the RLH family of purely cytoplasmic PRRs is made up of retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I or DDX58), melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA5 or IFIH1) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) the notion of NLR-mediated recognition of coronaviruses is probable and could be further investigated. RIG-I and MDA-5 both sense cytoplasmic dsRNA, which the host recognizes as \u2018non-self\u2019 via the N-terminal CARDs. however, the two PRRs each sense distinct PAMPs, depending on the length of viral dsRNA from different RNA viruses. the best characterized type I IFNs can be classified into two major groups, the immediate-early genes (such as IFN) that are triggered by the initial response to virus infection, and the delayed-set that rely on a secondary de novo protein synthesis pathway [89]. the activated IRF3 can form a complex with the transcriptional co-activator cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREBP) to translocate to the nucleus and bind to DNA to trigger the transcription and expression of immediate-early IFNs. this leads to the formation of a STAT1-STAT2 heterodimer that teams up with the interferon regulatory DNA binding factor ISGF3. the interferon-stimulated gene STAT1 has been shown to be crucial in activating innate immune signaling pathways during SARS-CoV infection. PRRSV appears to be receptive to both IFN- (porcine IFN-, or Ad5-pIFN-) and - (recombinant swine beta interferon, or swIFN-beta) dose-dependent treatment. a deficiency in, or the cleavage of, MAVS from the mitochondrial membrane results in an arrested antiviral immune response. MAVS can also induce apoptosis independently of Type I IFN activation, with SARS-CoV non-structural protein 15 identified as an inhibitor of MAVS-induced apoptosis to escape host antiviral immune responses. both RIG-I and Mda5 have been implicated in the detection of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection. conflicting evidence has been reported, especially since it is not understood how cellular helicases could bind viral replicative/transcriptive intermediates. MHV infection can also delay IFN-activated ISG induction. domain of nsp3 de-ubiquitinates TANKbinding kinase 1 (TBK1) and TBK1-IRF3 itself. this prevents IRF3 nuclear translocation [121,122], thereby inhibiting the transcription of type I interferons. coronavirus-induced apoptosis is intricately linked with other host antiviral innate defenses. infections with viruses often result in cell cycle arrests and the activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) due to ER stress. MHV S protein has been shown to activate three UPR transducers. interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 are up-regulated at the transcriptional level during coronavirus infection. there is minimal to moderate up-regulation at the translational level. this leads to the hypothesis that the interaction between IBV spike (S) protein and host eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) modulates host gene expression. the PRRSV N protein has been suggested as the viral protein responsible for mediating IL-10 induction. the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-, is up-regulated during equine endothelial cells and macrophages. RANTES is a known member of the pro-inflammatory CC chemokines family. the activation of RANTES transcription also requires the participation of adaptor molecules from the TLR signaling pathway, such as myD88, TRIF and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) [139]. Interestingly, respiratory PRRSV/PRCV viral co-infections often leads to severely attenuated innate and adaptive immune responses. autophagy is also known to mount crucial innate immune responses against invading pathogens. coronavirus-induced apoptosis is intricately linked with other host antiviral innate defenses. infections with viruses often result in cell cycle arrests and the activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) due to ER stress, both of which may be accompanied by the parallel activation of the UPR. p38 MAPK signaling pathway regulates production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8, in infected host cells and mount an immune response against virus infection in these cells. however, there is minimal to moderate up-regulation at the translational level, leading to the hypothesis that a significant decline in host mRNA translation in infected cells impedes the expression of ER stress proteins. an increase in IL-10 production during the early stages of infection has also been observed in pigs infected with PRRSV. the up-regulation of IL-10, an important cytokine in the attenuation of innate and adaptive immune responses, is advantageous for PRRSV to sustain for a longer period of time in the host. PRRSV infection also triggers the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including RANTES [139]. the activation of RANTES transcription also requires the participation of adaptor molecules from the TLR signaling pathway, such as MyD88, TRIF and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). T-helper cells (Th1) group of cytokines have the ability to induce autophagy. Th2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 have been shown to inhibit autophagy. recent studies have shown the ability of IBV to induce autophagy during infection independently of cellular stress or nutrient deprivation. catalytic subunits will alter the phosphorylation state of various target proteins. CDK inhibitors include tumor suppressors such as the cip/kip (CDK interacting protein/Kinase inhibitory protein) and the INK4a/ARF (Inhibitor of Kinase 4/Alternative Reading Frame) family of genes that thwart progression to the next stage of the cell cycle. the interaction of coronavirus nsp13 with the p125 subunit of DNA polymerase was discovered to trigger DNA replication stress in cells during IBV infection. it has also been observed that the N protein of several coronaviruses localize in the nucleolus where it may perturb cell cycle activities of the host cell for the benefit of viral mRNA synthesis. eIF2alpha phosphorylation was significantly suppressed in both human and animal cells during IBV infection. the dephosphorylation of eIF2alpha during IBV infection appears to be induced by the up-regulation of GADD34 expression. TGEV suppresses both cellular RNA degradation and eIF2a phosphorylation during infection through an interaction between TGEV protein 7 and PP1. cell cycle arrest is mediated through the temporal expression levels of different cyclins and CDKs. this arrest is mediated through the nucleocapsid protein (N) as well as other virus-encoded non-structural (replicase) and accessory proteins such as nsp13. most well studied host protein that interacts with the coronavirus genome is heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase were confirmed to enhance TGEV infection. glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was found to have a diminishing effect on TGEV infection. this was confirmed in coronaviruses with a yeast two-hybrid screen. it was performed using IBV nsp14 as a bait protein. this led to the discovery of an ATP-dependent RNA helicase in the DExD/H helicase family. this interaction may lead to the incorporation of actin into the mature virion. viral replication complex continues with viral transcription and genome replication. sub-genomic sized mRNAs are translated into viral structural (S, E, M, N) and accessory proteins. virus particles undergo maturation when passing through the Golgi. impede host antiviral responses while host is armored with several lines of defense mechanisms and numerous antiviral factors to combat viral invasion. a clearer understanding of the complex interplay between the virus and its host could give new insights into the role of main players."}
