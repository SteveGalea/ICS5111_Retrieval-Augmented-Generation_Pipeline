{"summary": "Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) is a noninfectious pulmonary complication with diffuse lung injury after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) the incidence rate of IPS after allogeneic HCT is 4% to 12%. mortality from IPS remains high at 50% to 90%. BAL samples were further tested by real-time PCR and reverse transcription\u2013PCR assays for the detection of 3 bacterial and 25 viral organisms. only samples with 2 positive results were considered positive. pathogen load was determined by quantitative PCR. high viral load was defined as >105 copies per mL. death caused by respiratory failure was defined as any death caused exclusively or predominantly by respiratory failure. log-rank test was used to compare hazards of time-to-event outcomes. variables with P.1 in the univariable models were candidates for multivariable models. two-sided P values.05 were considered statistically significant. real-time PCR and reverse transcription\u2013PCR assays for the detection of 3 bacterial and 25 viral organisms. atypical bacteria (Legionella sp., Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae), herpesviruses (herpes simplex virus [HSV] types 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human herpesvirus-6 [HHV-6]) chromosomal integration of HHV-6 (ciHHV-6) was analyzed by droplet digital PCR using donor and/or recipient blood cells before HCT. samples were sequenced across 3 lanes of an Illumina HiSeq instrument. pathogens were categorized as \u201cuncertain\u201d if no consensus exists. the median age of patients with IPS was 46.1 years (range, 7-63) all patients in the control group underwent transplantation in the earlier years of the study period. IPS cases without pathogen showed a trend toward being CMV seronegative (P =.055) and were more likely to have no or low-grade acute GVHD (P =.015) TBI 18 (86) 47 (68) 20 (65) 27 (71) MA without TBI 3

disease risk group at transplantation was classified into 2 groups: standard and high. ciHHV-6 was observed in 1 of 17 patients with available cellular blood cell samples from donor and/or recipient before HCT. the second most common uncertain pathogen was HRV, which frequently presented with high viral load. in the control group, Aspergillus and CMV were also frequently detected, whereas HHV-6 and HRV were each detected in 1 patient. values were obtained from the comparison in the number of patients with any pathogens between IPS cases and controls. median values of galactomannan were 0.65 (range, 0.57-2.37) in IPS cases and 1.46 (range, 0.62-2.24) in controls. no additional pathogens beyond those detected by PCR testing were observed except hepatitis C virus in 1 pool that included a virus carrier. anelloviridae 8353 0.00013 N/A BAL_Pool_4 HHV- 6 33 0.000048 1.2 Bovine viral diarrhea virus 1* 21 0.000031 12.8 Anelloviridae 306 0.0000045 N/A BAL_Pool_5 Rhinovirus B 8 0.000011 5.2

cultures and stains to detect pathogens. aspergillus galactomannan testing and multiplex respiratory virus testing have become more prevalent in recent years. microbial testing to diagnose IPS was insufficient. this is consistent with our finding that persistent CMV DNA detection in 1 follow-up BAL and 2 autopsy samples from IPS cases did not result in CMV pneumonia. 4 control patients who had not received preemptive therapy died of CMV pneumonia. follow-up BAL and/or autopsy samples were available in 40% of patients. we detected the original pathogen in most follow-up samples. these findings argue against self-limited infection and support a pathogenic role of HHV-6 and HRV in lung. bovine viral diarrhea virus is likely a laboratory reagent contaminant from fetal bovine serum. Viruses corresponding to the family, Anelloviridae, were also seen in 7 of 8 pools. sensitivity of pathogen detection using quantitative PCR may be reduced. the significance of potentially missed low-level novel infection would have been difficult to prove. the control group had limitations, including an earlier era of transplantation, a narrower window and later time after HCT, and a lack of patients undergoing peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. M.-L.H., C.E.F. and R.H.S. performed PCR and galactomannan assays; C.Y.C., E.S., G.Y., and S.M. performed analysis of NGS; H.X. and T.A.G. performed the statistical analyses; M.B. designed the study and wrote the manuscript; and all authors critically reviewed the manuscript drafts and approved the final version."}
