{"summary": "particles of small size can remain suspended in the air for long periods. particle size is central to epidemiology of airborne pathogens. particle size is central to the epidemiology of airborne pathogens. pigs and cattle affected by foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) lack of information on particle size distribution for pathogens affecting humans and animals. study characterized particle concentrations, size distributions and infectivity of three viruses that affect swine. the information from this study may contribute to the understanding of airborne transmission of viruses of different pathogenesis and routes of transmission. protocols and procedures followed throughout the study were approved by the University of Minnesota Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. pigs were inoculated with PRRSV and IAV 48 h after arrival at the isolation units. two pigs were removed from the room prior to inoculation. pigs were sedated using an intramuscular injection of Telazol. the respiratory disease score was defined as the number of pigs with coughing and/or sneezing episodes (i.e. one or several episodes in a sequence by an individual pig) registered in 3 minutes. swabs were collected for IAV testing from all pigs on -2, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 13 days post infection. intestines were removed from all animals and sections from 6 different areas of the jejunum and ileum were collected for histopathology. total particle concentrations and size distributions were measured using an optical particle counter (OPC) able to separate particles from 0.3 to >10 m into 6 size intervals. the ACI sampled air at 28.3 l/min for 1 hour, and separated particles into 8 size intervals. samples from this device were eluted from every plate stage using a cell scraper and 1 ml of MEM. the samples were then disassembled and plates and stages were scrubbed and disinfected with alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride soap. a bioassay was performed by inoculating three susceptible piglets with air samples that tested PEDV RT-PCR positive. four 10-day-old pigs from a PEDV-negative farm were purchased and each pig allocated to a separate isolation room. each pig was intra-gastrically inoculated as described earlier. an ACI sample was included in the analysis when one or more samples from the eight stages of the sampler had a Ct value within the positive or suspect ranges. Tukey\u2019s method was also used in conjunction with ANOVA for pairwise comparison of virus concentrations among all particle size intervals. pigs were inoculated with PRRSV and IAV 48 h after arrival at the isolation units. two pigs were removed from the room prior to inoculation and commingled back with the rest of the pigs. pigs were sedated using an intramuscular injection of Telazol. the respiratory disease score was defined as the number of pigs with coughing and/or sneezing episodes (i.e. one or several episodes in a sequence by an individual pig) registered in 3 minutes. swabs were collected for IAV testing from all pigs on -2, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 13 days post infection. intestines were removed from all animals and sections from 6 different areas of the jejunum and ileum were collected for histopathology. total particle concentrations and size distributions were measured using an optical particle counter (OPC) able to separate particles from 0.3 to >10 m into 6 size intervals. sampled air at 28.3 l/min for 1 hour, and separated particles into 8 size intervals. samples from this device were eluted from every plate stage using a cell scraper and 1 ml of MEM. samples were then disassembled and plates and stages were scrubbed and disinfected. a bioassay was performed by inoculating three susceptible piglets with air samples that tested PEDV RT-PCR positive. four 10-day-old pigs from a PEDV-negative farm were purchased and each pig allocated to a separate isolation room. an ACI sample was included in the analysis when one or more samples from the eight stages of the sampler had a Ct value within the positive or suspect ranges.

PRRSV RNA was detected in particle sizes ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 m and in particles ranging from 2.1 to 10 m. negative control pig showed no clinical signs, tested negative by PCR and had normal intestinal histomorphology. overall there were higher concentrations of airborne PEDV compared to PRRSV and IAV (p 0.0001) associated with each particle size. there were more total particles within the first submicrometer size compared to particles larger than 0.5 m (p 0.05) for the first 4 days after infection with IAV and PRRSV, animals had the maximum lethargy and respiratory scores of 4 and 16.7%, respectively. lethargy scores ranged between 0 and 1 for the remainder of the study, except for the day after PEDV infection that increased to 2.5.

PRRSV RNA was detected for the first time in air samples collected at 7DPI and until 17 DPI, on a total of 8 days. negative results from the ACI stages were not considered for the viral load analysis. PEDV RNA was detected in all air samples collected from 24 hours post infection to the termination of the study. there was higher concentration in particles >3.3 to 10 m compared to those in ranges 0.4 to 3.3 m. all bioassay pigs infected with air samples experienced moderate to severe diarrhea. particle concentration, size distribution, and infectivity of three animal viruses. IAV, PRRSV and PEDV emitted by infected pigs were found associated with a wide range of particle sizes. virus viability was particle size dependent with IAV and PRRSV isolated only from particles larger than 2.1 m. viability was only shown for PRRSV and IAV in particles larger than 2.1 m in diameter. it is considered that only respiratory viruses are airborne despite some limited evidence that enteric viruses, such as adenovirus or norovirus, can be airborne. the information generated in this study is especially important to design effective airborne disease control programs for both enteric and respiratory viruses. the information generated in this study is especially important to design effective airborne disease control programs for both enteric and respiratory viruses."}
