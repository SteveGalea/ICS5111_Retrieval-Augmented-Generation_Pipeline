{"summary": "study aimed to evaluate the predictors of stress symptoms among Chinese university students during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. study aimed to evaluate the predictors of stress symptoms among Chinese university students during the 2009 pandemic. by march 2010, almost all countries had reported cases of infection. over 17,700 related deaths had been reported to the world health organization. PTSD usually occurs after exposure to any event that results in psychological trauma. but most people so exposed do not develop PTSD [14,15] the findings of this study will be important in planning for future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, especially in university students. subjects recruited from 4 provinces of China, including Heilongjiang, Beijing, Shanghai and Sichuan during November-December 2009. the frequency of stress symptoms occurrence during the past 4 weeks was rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 \u201cnot at all\u201d through 3 \u201cmoderately\u201d to 5 \u201cextremely\u201d this measure can be scored continuously by summing the values of each response or dichotomously using an algorithm that considers a corresponding response of \u201cmoderately\u201d or greater as a symptom. the relationship between participants\u2019 characteristics and the burden of psychologic symptoms was ascertained using the PCL score sample sizes from Heilongjiang, Beijing, Shanghai and Sichuan were 455, 106, 419, and 102, respectively. the sample sizes from Heilongjiang, Beijing, Shanghai and Sichuan were 455, 106, 419, and 102, respectively. the frequency of stress symptoms occurrence during the past 4 weeks was rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 \u201cnot at all\u201d through 3 \u201cmoderately\u201d to 5 \u201cextremely\u201d this measure can be scored continuously by summing the values of each response or dichotomously using an algorithm that considers a corresponding response of \u201cmoderately\u201d or greater as a symptom. the proportion of university students enrolled in this study who met symptomatic criteria for PTSD was 2% (22 students) two of the 22 students had ever been infected with H1N1 Influenza. gender, having knowledge about H1N1 influenza, and being afraid of H1N1 influenza were also included. no correlation was found between PCL-C total score and having knowledge about H1N1 influenza, receiving the vaccine, and contacting people infected with H1N1 influenza. the regression analyses revealed that in north china, female gender, having H1N1 influenza, having family members, friends or acquaintances having H1N1 influenza, and being afraid of H1N1 influenza were significant predictors. the study is the first to report stress symptoms among university students during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. in general, many students experienced a variety of stress reactions to the 2009 H1N1 influenza, and about 2.0% of students developed PTSD. females are 2.38\u20132.49 times more likely to develop lifetime PTSD than men after exposure to similar traumas. university students of higher grade had more stress symptoms, which was contrary to our previous prediction. despite methodological shortcomings, this study extends research in this area by showing the stress symptoms and the significant predictors of the symptoms among university students."}
