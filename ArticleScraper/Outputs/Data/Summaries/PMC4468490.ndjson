{"summary": "positive-strand RNA viruses replicate on cellular membranes in order to achieve efficient virus production. electron microscopy coupled to tomography has recently been used to get an elaborate three-dimensional view of animal virus-induced membranous structures. one or two viral proteins are responsible for membrane alteration. viral proteins contain functional domains for membrane anchorage, protein-protein interactions, and organelle targeting. the auxiliary replicase protein p27 is sufficient for its membrane association. a stretch of 20 amino acids was identified in the N-terminal region of the auxiliary replicase protein p27 that is sufficient for its membrane association. TuMV is a positive sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Potyviridae (24) the viral genome, about 9.8 kb in length, is linked covalently to a viral protein known as VPg (virus protein, genome linked) at the 5\u2032 terminus. the single open reading frame encodes a 358-kDa polyprotein that is processed into at least 11 mature proteins. the perinuclear structure is functionally linked to the peripheral motile ER-derived vesicles (25). it has been shown that vesicle formation was COPII dependent (25, 29) it is also not known if involvement of COPII components is required for vRNA replication per se or for intracellular/intercellular movement of the vRNA. mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent), following the manufacturer's instructions. pCambia/6K2:mCherry 1\u20136, 1\u201312, 1\u201312. pCambia/N2-TMD1-C1:mCherry was annealed with two complementary oligonucleotides. pNX32-Sec24aR693K was used for mutant pNX32-Sec24a. fragment flanked by KpnI and ApaI from plasmid pCambiaTuMVW15A. transient expression was performed by agroinfiltration on 4-week-old plants. bacterial optical density at 600 nm was adjusted to 0.03 for green fluorescent protein (GFP)-HDEL (42), 0.1 for yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-Sec24a (25), and 0.3 for 6K2 and its mutants. the enzyme solution was diluted with equal volume of W5 solution (2 mM MES [pH 5.7], 154 mM NaCl, 125 mM CaCl2, 5 mM KCl) and was filtered with a 41-m-pore nylon mesh. the flowthrough was centrifuged at 100 g for 3 min. 10 volumes of 1% Triton X-100, 100 mM Na2CO3, 4 M urea, or 1 M KCl were centrifuged at 30,000 g for 30 min to separate the soluble fraction (S30) and the membrane fraction (P30) these fractions were then diluted 5 times for immunoblotting. agrobacterium-mediated transient expression for 3 days, N. benthamiana leaves (approximately 0.3 g) were harvested and ground to powder in liquid nitrogen. crude lysates were centrifuged at 20,000. 1 ml of the supernatant was incubated with GFP-Trap resin (Chromotek) the PCR product of 6K1 was digested with BamHI followed by lig. pCambia/6K2:mCherry was digested with XbaI and BamHI. mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent), following the manufacturer's instructions. two complementary oligonucleotides were annealed for construction of pCambia/N2-TMD1-C1:mCherry. equal amounts of both oligonucleotides were mixed and heated to 95\u00b0C for 2 min and then ramped cool to 25\u00b0C over a period of 45 min. four-week-old leaves were cut into 1-mm strips and incubated with enzyme solution. vacuum infiltration was applied, and leaves were kept in the dark for 4 h. the pellet was resuspended in W5 solution and kept on ice for 30 min. the cellular fractionation experiment was performed as described in reference 39. the pellets were suspended in 10 volumes of 1% Triton X-100, 100 mM Na2CO3, 4 M urea, or 1 M KCl. the emission light was captured at 500 nm to 535 nm. mCherry was excited at 561 nm, and the emission light was captured at 580 nm to 640 nm. RESULTS 6K2 is associated with cellular membranes. it has been shown that the TuMV protein 6K2 is responsible for the production of vesicles associated with virus replication and intracellular as well as intercellular movement. this prediction is based on the positive-inside rule (47) due to the presence of a lysine-rich region in the predicted N-terminal tail of 6K2. the VPg-Pro domain of the precursor form 6K2-VPg-Pro is located in the lumen of 6K2-induced vesicles. total proteins (S3) were extracted, and soluble proteins (S30) were separated from membrane-associated proteins (P30) by centrifugation at 30,000 g. proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using a rabbit serum against mCherry. Western blotting showed that Triton X-100 treatment released 6K2 to the supernatant, while Na2CO3 had no effect on membrane association of 6K2. urea released some 6K2 in the S30 fraction, but the viral protein essentially remained associated with the membrane fraction. one object of this investigation was to characterize the molecular determinants of 6K2 for vesicle production. a negative value for Gapp indicates that the peptide has a high probability of being recognized as a TMD and integrated into a membrane. a negative value for Gapp indicates that the peptide has a high probability of being recognized as a TMD. ted with 1 M KCl, 100 mM Na2CO3, or 4 M urea, followed by ultracentrifugation and immunoblotting (H) all Western blots were performed with antibodies against RFP. the nucleus is indicated by the white arrow. the 6K2 N-terminal tail of 6K2 is required for ER export. it may interact with a host protein that resides in or is peripherally associated with membranes. interaction with certain lipids is also possible. the PCC Rr values were significantly higher for GFP-HDEL with 6K21\u201312:mCherry (0.24 0.05) or with 6K21\u201318:mCherry (0.42 0.11), thereby confirming the increasing retention of the latter two deletion mutants in the ER. the expression level of the truncated 6K2 proteins was similar to that of wild-type (WT) 6K2. representative epidermal cells coexpressing 6K2:mCherry (B), 6K21\u20136:mCherry (C), 6K21\u201312:mCherry (D), or 6K21\u201318:mCherry (E) were imaged using confocal microscopy. these images are optical images (1-m thick) mutants 6K2K7A, 6K2K10A, 6K2K12A, 6K2K14A, and 6K2K17A were produced and expressed as mCherry fusions in N. benthamiana. all expression of these mutants induced punctate structures similar to those observed with wild-type 6K2:mCherry. however, when K14 and K17 were simultaneously replaced with alanine, the resulting double mutant (6K2K conserved tryptophan residue and two lysine residues are important for 6K2 ER export. BLAST of predicted potyviral 6K2 N-terminal tail amino acid sequences. SMV, soybean mosaic virus; TEV, tobacco etch virus; PPV, plum pox virus; PMV, peanut mottle virus. the core GDD motif of the viral RdRp was mutated to VNN (TuMVVNN) to produce a replication-defective virus (53) at 5 days postinfection, plants infected with TuMV showed significant growth stunting. plants infected with TuMV, TuMVW15A, and TuMVVNN were similar to mock-infected plants. tryptophan 15 of 6K2 with an alanine residue affected cellular virus replication and virus systemic movement. agroinfiltrated leaves of mock-infected or TuMV-, TuMVW15A-, and TuMVVNN-infected N. benthamiana were evaluated by Western blotting 5 days later. a larger amount of CP accumulation was detected for TuMVW15A/6K2:mCherry than for TuMVW15A/6K2:mCherry, but less than for TuMVW15A/6K2:mCherry. this experiment indicates that TuMVW15A replication could be partially complemented by WT 6K2 when expressed in cis. Optical images (2 m thick) of green, red, and merged colors are shown. statistical analysis of the percentage of virus cell-to-cell movement of TuMV/6K2:mCherry//GFP-HDEL. 6K2W15A acts as a dominant-negative mutant that affects WT 6K2 function. 6K2 vesicles use the secretory pathway through the golgi apparatus to reach PD from the ER (27, 54) partial colocalization was found with YFP-Sec24a and 6K2:mCherry. this partial colocalization likely reflects the dynamic nature of 6K2. blocking of ER-to-Golgi trafficking should consequently increase colocalization between the two proteins. colocalization statistical analysis between YFP-Sec24a and 6K2-mCherry-tagged vesicles by calculation of the Pearson's correlation coefficient Rr values. the sample number (n) is 26 for each tested combination. significant differences are indicated by asterisks. the transformants were plated on an SD Leu Trp His plus X-Gal plus 3-AT medium. the transformants were plated on an SD Leu Trp His plus X-Gal plus 3-AT medium. the transformants were plated on an SD Leu Trp His plus X-Gal plus 3-AT medium. 6K2:mCherry was copurified along with YFP-Sec24a. samples coexpressing control mCherry with YFP, mCherry with YFP-Sec24a did not show any copurification. results indicate that 6K2 interacts with Sec24a. we first tested if Sec24aR693K could interact with 6K2 by YTH assay. we then infected wild-type A. thaliana with TuMV/6K2:GFP. we noticed that wild-type A. thaliana was systemically infected at 11 dpi, while the g92 mutant was not. p35STuMV of WT and g92 protoplast samples was normalized accordingly. we also agroinfiltrated WT and g92 A. thaliana leaves with TuMV/6K2:mCherry//GFP-HDEL. at 8 dpi, red-only fluorescence zones, indicative of virus intercellular movement, were clearly observed in WT A. thaliana. protoplasts were isolated from WT and g92 A. thaliana plants. production of CP was analyzed 40 h after transfection using a rabbit anti-CP serum. algorithms predict that 6K2 is a single-pass integral membrane protein. these predictions indicate the presence of a 19-amino-acid N-terminal tail, an 11-amino acid C-terminal tail, and a transmembrane domain (TMD) composed of 23 amino acids. this is exemplified by the TMHMM algorithm, which predicts that 6K2 has a type II topology. the probability values of each amino acid residue located inside and outside are plotted against the corresponding amino acid position. soluble proteins (S30) were separated from membrane-associated proteins (P30) by centrifugation at 30,000 g. proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using a rabbit serum against RFP or GFP. mCherry showed the presence of 6K2:mCherry in the P30 fraction, but not in the S30 fraction, indicating that 6K2 was membrane associated. the extraction procedure clearly separated soluble from membrane-associated proteins. western blotting showed that Triton X-100 treatment released 6K2 to the supernatant. Western blot analysis showed the presence of 6K1:mCherry in the S30 fraction but not in the P30 fraction. the soluble subcellular distribution may be explained by the Gapp of the TMD of 6K1 being higher than the one for 6K2. a negative value for Gapp indicates that the peptide has a high probability of being recognized as a TMD and integrated into a membrane. leaf epidermal cell of N. benthamiana expressing N2-TMD1-C1:mCherry 3 days after agroinfiltration. resulting S3, S30, and P30 fractions were incubated with 1 M KCl, 100 mM Na2CO3, or 4 M urea. confocal images are optical images (1-m thick) cellular membrane fractionation experiments showed the presence of N2-TMD1-C1:mCherry in the S30 fraction but also in the P30 fraction. cellular membrane fractionation experiments showed the presence of N2-TMD1-C1:mCherry in the S30 fraction but also in the P30 fraction. expression pattern of 6K21\u201312:mCherry and of 6K21\u201318:mCherry was mostly reticulate. the reticulate pattern of 6K21\u201312:mCherry was not the result of higher expression than that of 6K2:mCherry and 6K21\u201318:mCherry. the N-terminal tail is required for ER export of 6K2. a conserved tryptophan residue and two lysine residues in the N-terminal tail of 6K2 are important for ER export of 6K2. resulting single point mutants 6K2K7A, 6K2K10A, 6K2K12A, 6K2K14A, and 6K2K17A were produced and expressed as mCherry fusions in N. benthamiana. all expression of these mutants induced punctate structures. however, when K14 and K17 were simultaneously replaced with alanine, the resulting double mutant (6K2K14A-K17A) still produced punctate structures Western blot analysis showed that 6K2K14A-K17A and 6K2W15A were expressed at similar levels to 6K2. tryptophan residue at position 15 and lysine residues at position 14 and 17 are involved in 6K2 export from the ER. the top panels show equal loading verified by Coomassie staining. the tryptophan residue located at position 15 in the N-terminal tail of 6K2 is important for ER export of the viral protein. we introduced this mutation into an infectious viral clone (TuMVW15A) to test its impact on virus infection. infiltrated leaves were evaluated by Western blotting 5 days later. a strong CP signal was detected in TuMV-infected plants. no CP was observed for TuMVW15A and TuMVVNN at 5 dpi. a larger amount of CP accumulation was detected for TuMVW15A/6K2:mCherry than for TuMVW15A/6K2:mCherry. a larger amount of CP accumulation was detected for TuMVW15A/6K2:mCherry than for TuMVW15A/6K2:mCherry, but less than for TuMV/6K2:mCherry. Optical images of N. benthamiana epidermal cells infected with TuMV/6K2:mCherry//GFP-HDEL (C) and TuMVW15A/6K2:mCherry//GFP-HDEL (D) are shown. agroinfiltrated leaves were examined 5 days later by confocal microscopy. TuMV expressing 6K2:mCherry could move beyond primary infected cells. TuMVW15A was restricted exclusively to primary infection foci. 6K2 ER export may involve interaction with Sec24a. we expressed the COPII marker YFP-Sec24a (25) in leaves infected with TuMV/6K2:mCherry. this partial colocalization likely reflects the dynamic nature of 6K2. 6K2 colocalizes with YFP-Sec24a in absence (A) and presence (B) of BFA. the area in the dashed box in panels A and B is shown on the right. the sample number (n) is 26 for each tested combination. ecular fluorescence (BiFC) and co-IP experiments. we then tested the interaction of LV-Cub-6K2 with NubG-Sar1 or NubG-Sec24a. the results showed that 6K2 interacted with Sec24a but not with Sar1. N. benthamiana leaves expressing 6K1:mCherry alone, 6K1:mCherry and YFP-Sec24a, and N2-TMD1-C1:mCherry and YFP-Sec24a were analyzed as described for panel B. to further confirm this YTH interaction, 6K2:mCherry was copurified along with YFP-Sec24a. the g92 mutant line has a missense mutation in the gene coding for Sec24a. it causes conversion of an Arg residue at position 693 to a Lys residue (Sec24aR693K) in a region considered important for cargo binding. this partial loss of function of Sec24a induces the accumulation of Golgi bodies in globular structures composed of a mass of convoluted ER. plast preparation was split into three aliquots and mock transfected or transfected with p35STuMVVNN and p35STuMV. CP quantification for the p35STuMV of WT and g92 protoplast samples was normalized accordingly. g92 A. thaliana leaves with TuMV/6K2:mCherry//GFP-HDEL to assess intercellular movement of TuMV. the upper nonagroinfiltrated leaves of the WT and g92 A. thaliana plants were inoculated with TuMV/6K2:GFP and observed under UV light 11 days later. production of CP was analyzed 40 h after transfection using an anti-tuMV CP rabbit serum. les have been shown to traffic through the secretory pathway for successful viral infection (25\u201327, 54), and their formation was shown to be dependent on COPI and COPII factors. secondary structure predictions indicated that 6K2 is an integral membrane protein (Table 1). this is supported by prior studies showing that the VPg-Pro domain of the precursor form 6K2-VPg-Pro is located in the lumen of 6K2-induced vesicles (28) ER export motifs for many proteins that undergo ER-Golgi apparatus transport have been identified. these ER export motifs can be divided into four types: diacidic (DXE, EXXD, and YXESDG), dibasic (RK), dihydrophobic (LL, LxL, and VV) and diaromatic (FF, YY, or FY) motifs. sec24a binding to cargo membrane proteins is dynamic as this complex disassembles as soon as the vesicle buds off from the ER. this complex disassembles as soon as the vesicle buds off from the ER. it is only when ER-to-Golgi apparatus trafficking is stalled by the addition of BFA that near complete colocalization can be observed. the R693K mutation alters Sec24a activity in g92 plants. 6K2 coopts Sec24a function and thus affects its ability to function normally in ER-to-Golgi apparatus vesicular trafficking in TuMV-infected cells. the end result was a reduced level of cellular virus production, with no indication of plant systemic viral infection. 6K2 is able to engage the host cell ER export machinery to initiate viral vesicular formation for transport of vRNA and viral as well as host proteins necessary for virus systemic movement."}
