{"summary": "high-throughput sequencing (HTS) has been widely used for microbiome analysis (4\u20137), whole-genome sequencing (8\u201312), quasispecies population analysis (13\u201316), and the discovery of novel viruses (17\u201321). however, each is specific to a particular HTS platform, and interpretation remains convoluted to non-experts in bioinformatics. there is a need to benchmark the ability of HTS to provide clear and unbiased viral diagnostic results using a set of diverse, clinically relevant positive specimens. the current lack of diagnostics-oriented HTS investigations in the literature is likely due to the difficulty in displaying and interpreting the complicated data. in this pilot study, we present ezVIR as a proof of principle for using HTS for clinical diagnostics. ezVIR is a proof of principle for using HTS for clinical diagnostics. the results are reported in two phases to enable rapid identification and subsequent typing of the identified viruses. the patient's ages ranged from 10 months to 88 years (median, 42 years old) the patient's ages ranged from 10 months to 88 years. each specimen was immediately stored at 20\u00b0C (blood specimens) or 80\u00b0C (CSF, BAL fluid, NPA) the ethics committee of the Geneva University Hospitals approved this study. no informed consent was required. library concentrations were measured with a Q-bit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) only the most concentrated library was detectable by a 2200 TapeStation (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) size distribution of fragments was estimated with a 2200 TapeStation. RNA-seq libraries were loaded at 8 pM or lower for low-concentrated libraries. complete virus genome sequences were collected from EMBL, ViralZone and NCBI databases. the default bin cutoff values are 4,000, 20,000, and 40,000 bp. the default bin cutoff values are 4,000, 20,000, and 40,000 bp. however, these cutoff values can be customized by the user. reads are first mapped (Bowtie2) (30) to the human genome (NCBI GRCh37) the remaining nonhuman reads are mapped (Bowtie2) to a comprehensive, manually curated database containing 11,018 complete virus sequences. the pipeline computes genome detection metrics (defined below), summarizes data, and generates reports at two levels of sensitivity. phase 1 plots display the best-scoring representative (highest percent coverage and greatest maximum depth of coverage) for each detected virus species. phase 2 provides genome coverage information on the level of strains, genotype, serotype, or lineage, depending on the virus identified. the cross-contamination module will create a bar plot displaying the \u201csignal\u201d for that particular virus genome in all specimens. the CCA plots serve to guide interpretation of ezVIR analysis results. the phase 2 report highlights details for any selected virus family identified in phase 1. ezVIR is the sequence data (\u201cfastq\u201d files), and the default output is the phase 1 report. the user can then ask for more detailed information about each particular virus, including read coverage histograms, strain typing, and cross-contamination reports. only the best-mapped (in terms of genome coverage and maximum depth of coverage) genomes from each virus species (genus for herpesviruses) are presented in phase 2 reports. the color of the inner dot and label name correspond to the virus family. the outer gray ring represents the size class (genome length) of the virus. the size of the inner dot indicates approximately how much of that genome was detected. the speed of the mapping stage depends on the mapping software used, the number of computing cores, and the number of nonhuman reads. after mapping, all report generation and the phase 2 analysis can be performed on a desktop or laptop computer in a matter of seconds to minutes. the patient's ages ranged from 10 months to 88 years. cytomegalovirus (CMV; human herpesvirus 5), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; human herpesvirus 4), or JC virus (JCV) by in-house assays or commercial real-time PCR (RT-PCR) each specimen was immediately stored at 20\u00b0C (blood specimens) or 80\u00b0C (CSF, BAL fluid, NPA), the ethics committee of the Geneva University Hospitals approved this study. se buffer (Invitrogen), 1.8 mM MgCl2, 0.75 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.3 mM dNTPs, and 16 g/ml RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland) was added to 20 l of extracted DNA, incubated 1.5 h at 37\u00b0C, and subjected to a phenol-chloroform extraction. libraries were prepared with the low-throughput TruSeq total RNA preparation protocol from Illumina (San Diego, CA, US) using 15 PCR cycles. size distribution of fragments was estimated with a 2200 TapeStation. a histogram of genome lengths for all genomes in the ezVIR database was generated. the default bin cutoff values are 4,000, 20,000, and 40,000 bp. however, these cutoff values can be customized by the user. bioinformatics pipeline is able to determine the most likely viruses (as the best-mapped genome for each virus species [genus for herpesviruses] detected) reads are first mapped (Bowtie2) (30) to the human genome (NCBI GRCh37) in virus identification phase 1, the remaining nonhuman reads are mapped (Bowtie2) to a comprehensive, manually curated database. the sliding window provides the means to highlight viruses with slightly more genome coverage in cases where multiple viruses have the same upper limit of mapped reads. phase 1 plots display the best-scoring representative (highest percent coverage and greatest maximum depth of coverage) for each detected virus species. the cross-contamination module will create a bar plot displaying the \u201csignal\u201d for that particular virus genome in all specimens. the CCA plots serve to guide interpretation of ezVIR analysis results and help determine if a detected virus was present in the original specimen or could be a contaminant. the input to ezVIR is the sequence data (fastq files), and the default output is the phase 1 report. the reports are designed to allow rapid and intuitive comparison of all viruses detected regardless of large differences in genome lengths. only the best-mapped (in terms of genome coverage and maximum depth of coverage) genomes from each virus species (genus for herpesviruses) are presented in phase 2 reports. the data points (colored dots) that appear on the reports are intended to provide multiple useful measurements in the same location. the color of the inner dot and label name correspond to the virus family. the outer gray ring represents the size class (genome length) of the virus. the first part of the pilot ezVIR pipeline (mapping to the human genome and then to all virus genomes) took 4 days per specimen using Bowtie2 (30) on a multicore computer. the use of alternate alignment software (e.g., SNAP) (33) can reduce the analysis time to less than 1 day. the speed of the mapping stage depends on the mapping software used, the number of computing cores, and the number of nonhuman reads. eighteen of the 20 specimens used to assess the robustness of the pipeline presented here were correctly analyzed. the pipeline generates reports in two phases (Fig. 1A) the phase 1 report serves as the default representation that indicates the strongest signal from each detected virus species. specimen 20 (NPA) was collected from a 10-month-old child 8 days postvaccination for measles. phase 2 analysis reported the vaccinal Edmonston strain as the most likely candidate. however, phase 2 reports and histograms made it possible to distinguish the target virus over other background viruses. the ezVIR results from two specimens (specimens 03 and 04) were inconclusive. these cases were CSF and BAL specimens for which VZV and CMV (both herpesviruses) were detected in routine analysis, respectively. however, the ezVIR phase 1 reports for both of these specimens enabled one to presume that herpesvirus was present. the larger data point size helps to distinguish the detected target virus from background virus signals. ezVIR correctly identified the presence of the target virus. cross-contamination during specimen preparation is the most likely cause. both patients were independently infected with the same virus. the HRV-66 detected in specimen 17 is most likely a result of cross-contamination from specimen 16. this is supported by the fact that only IAV, not HRV, was identified in specimen 17 by specific RT-PCR as used daily in routine screening. eighteen of the 20 specimens used to assess

strain as the most likely candidate. however, phase 2 reports made it possible to distinguish the target virus over other background viruses. signal observed for specimen 17 made this highly improbable. the robustness of the phase 2 report was confirmed by classical sequencing methods based on an analysis of the VP4-VP2 region and 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) the same approach could be used to rule out the very weak signals from JCV in specimen 01, HRV in specimen 10 and measles virus in specimen 12. the larger data point size helps to distinguish the detected target virus from background virus signals. the \u201cblacklist\u201d option can also help clarify reports by removing potential non-clinically relevant viruses that may mask the signal of other detected viruses. both patients were independently infected with the same virus. the HRV-66 detected in specimen 17 is most likely a result of cross-contamination from specimen 16 rather than a coinfection. this is supported by the fact that only IAV, not HRV, was identified in specimen 17 by specific RT-PCR as used daily in routine screening. the current pipeline should not be considered a validated diagnostic tool for clinical care. the phase 1 report provides rapid species (genus for herpesviruses) identification, but the phase 2 report is useful for virus typing. a common consequence of this sensitivity is interspecimen contamination (27, 35) current HTS users should be extremely vigilant about the viruses present in neighboring specimens analyzed in the same series. the presence of such contamination did not affect interpretation of phase 1 reports for two specimens. ezVIR cross-contamination analysis aims to facilitate identification of such contaminants based on significant differences in signal strength (percent coverage and depth of coverage) of the same virus between specimens. this leads to a paradigm shift in clinical microbiology: a result can still be validated despite background contamination if the bioinformatics pipeline provides reliable analysis tools. the ezVIR pipeline is designed to be modular and customizable. the ezVIR pipeline is designed to be
