endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation MAP1LC3/LC3 microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain the autophagy pathway is a highly conserved recycling process in which double-membrane vesicles shuttle cellular debris to lysosomes for degradation. it is now clear that the autophagy pathway can be the source of at least some of the DMVs present in RNA virus-infected cells. autophagy pathway can contribute positively to CVB3 replication. plasmids encoding the polioviral proteins 2BC and 3A,13 can cause radical intracellular membrane reorganization, including wholescale disruption of the Golgi apparatus. however, autophagy is not absolutely required. dsRed-CVB3 is highly attenuated in wild-type mice, but this virus replicated to higher titers. we have followed up on this observation by generating a number of recombinant viruses that encode proteins that modulate the abundance or functionality of LC3. we have drawn 4 conclusions from the resulting data. both mouse strains were infected with dsRed-rCVB3 and, 2 d later, were sacrificed. the presence of a single allele of GFP-LC3 is sufficient to increase replication and disease in the pancreas. we generated triple-transgenic mice ([GFP-LC3]-ElCre-Atg5f/f), along with their Cre littermates. these mice were infected with WTCVB3 and, one d later, were sacrificed and viral titers were measured in their pancreata. there was no detectable deficit in WTCVB3 replication in their Cre+ counterparts. aviruses, arteriviruses and flaviviruses found no effect of GFP-LC3.22,27,28. the authors found no effect of GFP-LC3.22,27,28. the studies below were carried out to better define how CVB3 exploits the various possible forms of LC3. a lipidated, membrane-resident, form of LC3 is termed LC3-II. the lipidated, membrane-resident, form of LC3 is termed LC3-II. this occurs after formation of the mature autophagosome. this occurs after formation of the mature autophagosome, at which time LC3-II becomes functionally redundant. 4BC74A-CVB3) encodes an enzymatically-inactive form of ATG4B. this protein, carrying a C74A mutation, binds to and sequesters any available LC3-I. the endogenous (host) ATG4B should cleave the endogenous proLC3-I. the predicted protein sequences from the N termini of the recombinant polyproteins are shown. the predicted protein sequences from the N termini of the recombinant polyproteins are shown. titers of all 3 new rCVB3s were slightly reduced (by 3-fold) the proLC3 virus is making protein which is being processed (by endogenous ATG4B) to generate LC3-I which undergoes normal processing to generate LC3-II. proLC3G120A-CVB3 is longer than the LC3-I protein. proLC3-CVB3 protein isolated from cells infected with the proLC3G120A virus (bottom sequence), contained a peptide. the equivalent peptide encoded by proLC3-CVB3 (DEDGF.........FGTAMAVr) was not detected by mass spectrometry because the proLC3 protein had been cleaved by host cell ATG4B. the effects of the 3 new rCVB3s on the abundance of autophagy-related proteins in infected cells are summarized in Figure 2F. rCVB3s replicate efficiently, and the recombinant proteins that they encode function as intended in tissue culture. dsRed-CVB3 is attenuated in vivo, and did not cause severe pancreatitis in mice. the pancreata of mice infected with any of the remaining 3 rCVB3s showed substantial inflammatory infiltration, and acinar cell hypochromicity, reminiscent of the florid disease that is induced by WT CVB3. acinar cells infected with proLC3-CVB3 were abundant. acinar cells infected with the atg4BC74A virus also contained many lattices. this virus caused some characteristic changes, distinct from cells infected with the virus. accumulation of omegasomes and phagophores has been previously reported in cells transfected with a plasmid encoding the C74A mutant of ATG4B. the consequent reduction in LC3-II formation retards the growth and ultimate closure of phagophores, thereby inhibiting autophagy. however, the atg4BC74A-CVB3 virus mirrors these data, causing the accumulation of omegasomes and immature phagophores. dsRed-CVB3 showed a highly significant increase in the GFP-LC3 animals. dsRed-CVB3 showed a highly significant increase in the GFP-LC3 animals. neither proLC3G120A-CVB3 nor Atg4BC74A-CVB3 showed a statistically significant change in titer, suggesting neither of these viruses are as capable of exploiting the autophagy pathway. the ratio of genomic RNA:infectious virus remained relatively linear in GFP-LC3 mice for all rCVB3s. 4 rCVB3s were evaluated in mice homozygous for GFP-Lc3. western blots were carried out on pancreatic protein extracts. rCVB3-encoded ATG5 restores functional deficiency in acinar cells. we first confirmed the extent, and cell-specificity, of Cre recombinase activity in uninfected ElCre-Atg5f/f mice, by backcrossing the mice against a Cre reporter line (JAX 7914,34) the sections were incubated with fluor-tagged phalloidin (which binds to F-actin, revealing the cytoskeleton, green) and Hoechst 33342 (staining nuclei blue both ATG5, and cleaved ATG5 (cATG5) were present, and the ATG5 appeared to be functional, as there was an increase in the abundance of ATG12-ATG5 conjugate. to confirm that this virus-encoded ATG5 retained biological function, ElCre-Atg5f/f mice were infected with Atg5-CVB3 or with dsRed-CVB3 and, 2 d later, the pancreat d ATG5 restores functional deficiency in ElCre-Atg5f/f acinar cells. it enhances viral replication and pathogenesis. all mice in resulting litter were Atg5f/WT-7914+. ata were harvested, and the amount of ATG12-ATG5 complex was determined by western blot. the complex is absent from the pancreata of mice infected with dsRed-CVB3. rCVB3s encoding different autophagy-related proteins show differing dependence on an intact autophagy pathway. rCVB3s encoding different autophagy-related proteins show differing dependence on an intact autophagy pathway. rCVB3s encoding different autophagy-related proteins show differing dependence on an intact autophagy pathway. rCVB3s encoding autophagy-related proteins differ in at least 2 ways. the ability of the proLC3 virus to exploit the early stage of the autophagy pathway is probably mediated by the large quantities of LC3-I (and LC3-I) in cells infected by this virus. y pathway, because cells infected with this virus do not contain large amounts of LC3-I or LC3-II. this could induce DMV formation in the absence of abundant LC3-I and in a manner that is relatively independent of ATG5. others have shown that some viruses can be induced by some viruses in an autophagy-independent manner. aliquots of the same lysates were precipitated using antibody against SEL1L. the precipitated proteins were subjected to gel electrophoresis. the presence of LC3 proteins, and of SEL1L protein, was determined by western blot. the LC3-II that was present in the original lysates (panel B) is absent from the SEL1L precipitates (panel C) this has 2 implications: first, that this protein should be covalently attached to the membrane of developing autophagosomes. however, to confirm the specificity of the LC3 precipitation, we subjected the protein lysates to a different immunoprecipitation. the third pathway is extant only when LC3-I is sequestered by ATG4BC74A. only the first of these 3 pathways is ATG5-dependent. we wished to determine if the availability of GFP-LC3 would alter this antiviral effect of ATG5 deletion. to do so, we generated triple-transgenic mice ([GFP-LC3]-ElCre-Atg5f/f), along with their Cre littermates. these mice were infected with WTCVB3 and, one d later, were sacrificed. cells were similar in the double-transgenic (GFP-LC3)-Atg5f/f and triple-transgenic (GFP-LC3-ElCre-Atg5f/f) animals, confirming that provision of GFP-LC3 could functionally complement the deficiency of ATG5. the results obtained in the triple-transgenic mice strongly support the hypothesis that pathways other than autophagy must be able to provide membrane scaffolds that allow efficient enteroviral replication. the newly exposed Gly120 residue on LC3-I becomes covalently attached to ATG7, then is transferred to ATG3. there, the LC3-I moiety undergoes a final transfer, forming an amide bond between its Gly120 residue and PE. this lipidated, membrane-resident, form of LC3 is termed LC3-II. this occurs after formation of the mature autophagosome, at which time LC3-II becomes a virus (Atg4BC74A-CVB3) encodes an enzymatically-inactive form of ATG4B. the endogenous (host) ATG4B should cleave the endogenous proLC3-I. the virus-produced ATG4BC74A protein should sequester this molecule. the relative loading amounts can be determined from the GAPDH data (lower blot) for all viruses, the quantities of autophagy-related products were determined (upper blot) and, for the Atg4BC74A virus, the amount of ATG4BC74A expression was evaluated (middle blot) rCVB3s were infected at high multiplicity of infection (MOI; 10) and cell lysates were prepared 8 h later. all viruses appeared to make similar quantities of viral protein. this is consistent with the similar titers of infectious virus that were produced. a recent study attributes this aberrant migration to the C-terminal amino acids (distal to Gly120) the protein made by the proLC3G120A virus was likely to be intact proLC3G120A, but we chose to further examine this virus-encoded recombinant protein. ated ATG4B led to an increase in LC3-I content in cells infected by the Atg4BC74A virus. the increase in LC3-I content in cells infected by the virus is much more marked than it may at first appear. rCVB3s replicate efficiently, and the recombinant proteins that they encode function as intended in tissue culture. dsRed-CVB3 is attenuated in vivo, and did not cause severe pancreatitis in WT mice. the presence of excess autophagy-related proteins had a dramatic effect on the extent of pancreatitis. however, the pancreata of mice infected with any remaining 3 rCVB3s showed substantial inflammatory infiltration. acinar cells infected with proLC3-CVB3 and proLC3G120A-CVB3 viruses were abundant. acinar cells infected with the atg4BC74A virus also contained many large lattices. this virus caused some characteristic changes, distinct from cells infected with the rCVB3. omegasomes and phagophores are transitory, rapidly developing into mature autophagosomes. accumulation of omegasomes and phagophores has been previously reported in cells transfected with a plasmid encoding the C74A mutant of ATG4B. however, accumulation of omegasomes and phagophores has been previously reported. n = 80 acinar cells infected with proLC3-CVB3; n = 85 acinar cells infected with proLC3G120A-CVB3; and n = 92 acinar cells infected with Atg4BC74A-CVB3 from 3 independent experiments. for each of the 3 different virus-infected cell types, the diameters of numerous DMVs (38 to 90) were measured. 104 pfu of dsRed-CVB3 and 107 pfu of the rCVBs were determined at 2 d p.i. dsRed-CVB3 showed a highly significant increase in titer. neither proLC3G120A-CVB3 nor Atg4BC74A-CVB3 showed a statistically-significant change in titer. rCVB3-encoded ATG5 restores functional deficiency in ElCre-Atg5f/f acinar cells, and enhances viral replication and pathogenesis. rCVB3-encoded ATG5 restores functional deficiency in ElCre-Atg5f/f acinar cells. rCVB3 encoded ATG5; this virus should rectify the genetic defect in the pancreatic acinar cells. we first confirmed the extent, and cell-specificity, of Cre recombinase activity in uninfected mice. in reporter mice lacking ElCre, the pancreas was macroscopically normal (inset), and Tomato signal was undetectable by fluorescence microscopy. atg5-CVB3 infection of HeLa cells showed that this virus makes abundant ATG5 far in excess of the quantity of endogenous protein in uninfected cells. both ATG5, and cleaved ATG5 (cATG5) were present, and the ATG5 appeared to be functional, as there was an increase in the abundance of ATG12-ATG5 conjugate. this complex was readily detected in the pancreata of animals infected with Atg5-CV rCVB3-encoded ATG5 restores functional deficiency in ElCre-Atg5f/f acinar cells, and enhances viral replication and pathogenesis. all mice in the resulting litter were Atg5f/WT-7914+; 50% also carried ElCre. mice were infected with Atg5-CVB3 or with dsRed-CVB3. a western blot was probed for ATG5 or for GAPDH. the complex is absent from the pancreata of mice infected with dsRed-CVB3. proLC3G120A and dsRed-CVB3 viruses replicated to significantly higher titers. this suggests that the positive impact of proLC3-CVB3 is substantially\u2014but not wholly\u2014reliant on ATG5. rCVB3s encoding different autophagy-related proteins show differing dependence on an intact autophagy pathway. infected lysates were subjected to gel electrophoresis. western blots were carried out using antibody to LC3 or to SEL1L. rCVB3s encoding autophagy-related proteins differ in at least 2 ways. the ability of the proLC3 virus to exploit the early stage of the autophagy pathway is probably mediated by the large quantities of LC3-I (and LC3-II) in cells infected with this virus do not contain large amounts of LC3-I or LC3-II. however, it is difficult to understand how this virus could induce DMV formation in the absence of abundant LC3-I. SEL1L plays a key role in ER homeostasis in vivo, particularly in pancreatic acinar cells,36 which are primary targets of CVB3. a large quantity of LC3-I was captured from cells infected with proLC3-CVB3. a large quantity of LC3-I was captured from cells infected with proLC3-CVB3. LC3-I presumably proceeds by this alternate route, i.e., the ERAD pathway. however, in cells infected with proLC3G120A-CVB3 the sequestered host LC3-I did not bind to SEL1L. this data suggest that the enhanced replication of this virus can be attributed to neither the autophagy nor the ERAD pathways. CVB3 can exploit 3 distinct sources of membrane scaffolds, all arising from the ER. two of them involve the attachment, covalently or otherwise, of LC3 to the ER membrane. the third pathway is extant only when LC3-I is sequestered by ATG4BC74A. the absence of ATG5 and dsRed-CVB3 is markedly diminished. in vivo infections with rCVB3s are at a substantial replicative advantage in autophagy-intact cells compared to a control recombinant virus dsRed-CVB3. however, the viruses displayed unique features in vivo. proLC3G120A-CVB3 produced abundant uncleaved protein (Fig. 2), induced DMVs (Fig. 4D-F), was unable to benefit from GFP-LC3 (Fig. 5), was independent of ATG5 (Fig. 7A), and the encoded protein (LC3-I) bound to SEL1L (Fig. 7C) we suggest that CVB3 is biologically flexible in vivo. an inducible knockout approach was used to delete SEL1L from most somatic cells in adult mice. some interactions between SEL1L and the recombinant LC3 proteins in proLC3-CVB3 and proLC3G120A-CVB3 viruses disrupt SEL1L function, contributing to ER cell death. in mice, the LC3-I-ATG3 pathway serves as a sink that consumes the virus-derived LC3-I, thereby preventing its binding to SEL1L. only when the sink is full does \u201cfree\u201d LC3-I become available for SEL1L binding, allowing the proLC3 virus to slightly outstrip the dsRed control by d 2 p.i. in uninfected cells, autophagy begins at the ER membrane, with the loose attachment of the ATG12-ATG5 complex. this covalently-attached version of LC3 then attracts more ATG12-ATG5 to the membrane, leading to a positive feedback loop. this leads to the very rapid accumulation of ATG12-ATG5 and LC3-II on the membrane. in all cases, the nature of the interaction between CVB3 and the various membranes remains to be determined. the viral 3A protein is membrane-tethered and was proposed as the lipophilic anchor of the viral replication complex. a single mutation in the protein allows the virus to bypass its use of PI4KIII, yet still replicate quite well. coronaviruses are thought to replicate independently of the autophagy pathway. the role of EDEMosomes and LC3 in coronavirus replication has been reported by the Molinari group. careful evaluation of published data suggests that a role for autophagy should not be completely excluded. onaviruses, flaviviruses, and pestiviruses may use LC3 as a skeleton key to access 2 different pathways, each of which can provide DMVs. this suggests that CVB3 may exploit any available membranes, regardless of their source. this complicates any attempt to mitigate viral diseases by targeting individual pathways. a recent investigation of enteroviral infection during Crohn disease identified CVB or echovirus in the crypt epithelial cells all 24 patients. no virus was detected in the intestine of any of the 6 controls who had undergone emergency surgery for acute volvulus. additional indirect evidence supports the notion that chronic inflammation may upregulate LC3 rendering host cells more susceptible to productive RNA virus infection. c3)-ElCre-Atg5f/f mice and (GFPLc3)-Atg5f/f mice were crossed with a Crereporter strain (A114, JAX 007914)34 to obtain ElCre-Atg5f/WT-7914 animals. mice were genotyped by PCR as previously described. rCVB3s were grown in HeLa cells, and virus stocks were generated. mice (8- to 12-wk old) were inoculated intraperitoneally with 104 pfu of WT CVB3 or 107 pfu of various rCVB3s. atic acini were prepared using a modified collagenase digestion protocol. pancreas were isolated from 10- to 12-wk-old (20 to 22 g) mice. the cells were shaken vigorously by hand before and after the third digestion. membranes were washed in TBST and incubated with primary antibody in 1% milk with TBST overnight at 4\u00b0C. membranes were then washed again and then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. membranes were incubated with amershamTM ECLTM Prime (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, RPN2232) for 5 min, then exposed to BioMax MR Film (Kodak) the membranes were then washed in TBST, stripped with Restore PLUS Western Blot Stripping Buffer (Pierce/Thermo Scientific, 46430) for 10 min at RT, then washed and blocked with 5% milk in TBST for 1 h at RT.
