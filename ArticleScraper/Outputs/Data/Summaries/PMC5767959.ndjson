{"summary": "sialic acids are a family of more than 50 sugars that are typically found at the terminal ends of N-glycans, O-glycans, and glycosphingolipids. they are involved in recognition processes, often serving as ligands for receptor-mediated interactions that enable intercellular or host\u2013pathogen recognition. the most common sialic acids are N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneurami homologous CMAH sequences have recently been detected only in two green algae and in a few prokaryotes. phylogenetic analyses suggest a horizontal gene transfer event from green algae to deuterostomes. some deuterostomes, including humans, have undergone inactivation or loss of the gene CMAH. inactivation of CMAH may have freed our ancestors from pathogens that require attaching to Neu5Ac for infection. inactivation of CMAH may have freed our ancestors from pathogens preferentially recognizing Neu5Ac. phenotypes of CMAH/ mice suggest loss of Neu5Gc may have contributed to a number of human-specific diseases. Neu5Gc from animal foods is incorporated into the glycoproteins of human tissues. this may explain the link between red meat consumption and cancer. new world monkeys underwent inactivation of CMAH 30 Ma due to inversion of exons 4\u201313 and loss of exons 4\u20138 and 10\u201313. in the ferret genome, the first nine exons of the gene have been lost. PCR analyses did not detect conserved portions of the gene in a number of pinnipeds and musteloids. CMAH gene may have been lost in an ancestor of Sauropsida (reptiles and birds) analysis of platypus genome did not reveal any CMAH homolog. CMAH was also lost in an ancestor of extant monotremes. CMAH has been lost or inactivated at least 31 times during deuterostome evolution. the gene has been lost or inactivated at least 31 times during deuterostome evolution. the genomes of 323 deuterostomes have been restricted to specific organisms. the nucleotide sequence of the coding region (CDS) was translated in silico and aligned with the chimpanzee sequence using ProbCons, version 1.12. resulting protein sequence alignment was used to guide the alignment of the CDSs. errors were fixed manually. phylogenetic analyses were conducted using IQ-Tree. only sequences covering at least 20% of the length of the gene were included. genomes were screened in the NCBI RefSeq genomic database. the nucleotide sequence of the coding region was translated in silico and aligned with the chimpanzee sequence. gene annotation errors were fixed manually. oneous and extra exons were searched for in the genome using the chimpanzee sequence as query in TBLASTN or BLASTN searches. if the missing exon could not be detected, a careful analysis was conducted to determine whether the exon had been lost or it was part of an unsequenced region. phylogenetic analyses used to better characterize certain gene duplication events in fish and nonvertebrate deuterostomes. only sequences covering at least 20% of the length of the gene were included in our phylogenetic analyses. ia, nitrospirae, FCB group (Fibrobacteres, Chlorobi, and Bacteroidetes) no hits were detected in any other group, including nondeuterostome animals. the distribution of CMAH homologs in nondeuterostomes is equivalent to that observed by Simakov et al.

Neu5Gc was detected in whole body extracts of Ophioderma brevispina (a brittle star), Nemaster rubiginosa (sea lily), and Sclerodactyla briareus (a sea cucumber) catodon Sperm whale Unknown Deletion of coding exon 5 143\u2013205 Erinaceus europaeus Western European hedgehog Unknown PSC in coding exon 13 530, 556 Gekko japonicus Japanese gecko Unknown PSC in coding exon 4 141 Oreochromis niloticus (copy 2) Nile tilapia Unknown FSM in coding exon 4 and 5 122, 152 Oreochromis one of the B. belcheri copies had a premature stop codon in coding exon 6. one of the B. floridae copies had a premature stop codon in coding exon 13. CMAH was lost in an ancestor of urochordates. the gene is present in classes Sarcopterygii (1 species) and Actinopterygii (71 species) a total of 16 gene loss events were inferred to have occurred in the fish lineages. species in which gene is absent or inactivated are marked in gray. no CMAH homolog was detected in the salamander Ambystoma mexicanum (axolotl) this results suggest that the ancestor of amphibians had a functional CMAH, and that it was lost in an ancestor of salamanders. species in which gene is absent or inactivated are marked in gray. X. laevis and other frogs previously reported to possess only Neu5Ac contain a CMAH enzyme with all its conserved domains. however, it is inconclusive at this point whether frogs exhibit nonsignificant levels of Neu5Gc in most of their tissues despite having an intact CMAH coding sequence. Neu5Gc was found in the gastrointestinal tract of ducks (Ito et al. 2000), the eggs of the budgerigar, and in both egg and tissues of an adult green basilisk (Schauer et al. 2009). however, the source of Neu5Gc in these species is yet to be established, with diet being a likely origin. CMAH in mammals The NCBI Genome database contains the genomes of 1 monotreme, 3 marsupials, and 126 placental mammals. we found putatively functional CMAH homologs in the genomes of all 3 marsupials and in 110 of the studied placental genomes. at least ten CMAH gene loss or inactivation events occurred during mammalian evolution. Schauer et al. (2009) identified a CMAH homolog in the genome of the marsupial Monodelphis domestica (gray short-tailed opossum), tammar wallaby, and Tasmanian devil. the presence of inactive CMAH sequences, and the absence of Neu5Gc, was also reported in a number of new world monkeys. a deletion spanning coding exons 3\u201315 in all available New World monkey genomes. we found a large deletion of nine protein-coding exons in the CMAH gene. this suggests a pseudogenization event in a common ancestor of musteloid and pinnipeds. the NCBI Genome database contains the genomes of seven Yinchiroptera and six Yangchiroptera species. CMAH gene could not be detected in two species belonging to Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae (Yinchiroptera) and in all five species belonging to Vespertillionidae (Yangchiroptera) gangliosides isolated from antlers of sika deer have been shown to contain both Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc. our study involved six cetacean genomes, which exhibited a putatively functional CMAH gene. exon 5 (relative to the chimpanzee CMAH) was missing. BLAST searches against the P. catodon genomic data revealed no sequences similar to exon 5. chimpanzee CMAH coding sequence (CDS) consists of 15 exons. echinoderms and hemichordates exhibit an extra intron that interrupts exon 11. echinoderms and hemichordates exhibit an extra intron that interrupts exon 11. logs are present in 184 of the 323 genomes studied. our inferred gene trees do not contradict the species tree. lateral gene transfer does not account for the observed phylogenetic distribution. 41 of the coding sequences of putatively functional CMAH genes identified in our study have some unsequenced fraction. we expect that animals with a putatively functional CMAH gene should be able to synthesize endogenous Neu5Gc, whereas those with pseudogenic or absent CMAH homologs should not. deletion of Neu5Gc triggered a cascade of changes in the sialic acid biology of humans. new world monkeys, which lack a functional CMAH gene, have been proposed as model organisms for the study of the effects of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies in xenotransplantation. the first two hits corresponded to the green algae Ostreococcus tauri and Micromonas commoda, and 60 prokaryotes. the distribution of CMAH homologs in nondeuterostomes is equivalent to that observed by Simakov et al. (2015). CMAH homologs were detected in all of the studied echinoderms, hemichordates, and cephalochordates. no CMAH orthologs (active or inactive) were detected in urochordates. the CMAH enzyme was purified from gonads of Asterias rubens (common star fish), Ctenodiscus crispatus (mud star), Strongylocentrotus pallidus (pale sea urchin), and a species of Holothuria (a sea cucumber) the CMAH cDNA was subsequently cloned and sequenced. cchus white-tufted-ear marmoset Known PSC in coding exon 3\u201315 74\u2013564 Ornithorhynchus anatinus Platypus Known PSC in coding exon 5 154 Mustela putorius furo Domestic ferret Known PSC in coding exon 11 444 Physeter catodon Sperm whale Unknown Deletion of coding exon 5 143\u2013205 Erinaceus europa we identified CMAH homologous sequences in all the studied cephalochordates. one copy in Asymmetron lucayanum (Bahama lancelet), five in Branchiostoma belcheri (Chinese amphioxus) and seven in Branchiostoma floridae (Floridan amphioxus) genomes belonging to classes Cephalaspidomorphi (lampreys, n = 2), Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes, n = 3), Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes, n = 1), and Actinopterygii (71 species) a total of 16 gene loss events were inferred to have occurred in the fish lineages. CMAH in amphibians There are four amphibian genomes available in the NCBI Genome database. we found putatively functional CMAH homologs in all three frogs. but no CMAH homolog was detected in the salamander Ambystoma mexicanum (axolotl) the CMAH genes of X. tropicalis and X. laevis have been classified as pseudogenes in the NCBI RefSeq database. this value was significantly 1 (dN/dS = 0.142, 2l = 109.03, P = 1.60 1025), suggesting strong purifying selection. we queried the genomes of 73 birds and 19 nonbird reptiles for CMAH homologs. this led to the suggestion that CMAH may have been lost in an ancestor of Sauropsida. this led to the suggestion that CMAH may have been lost in an ancestor of Sauropsida (reptiles and birds) the Neu5Gc observed in the duck gastrointestinal tract and in budgerigar eggs may be endogenous. CMAH in mammalian vertebrates may have been incorporated from the diet. a lizard may have been incorporated from the diet. chimpanzee CMAH has 15 protein-coding exons. CMAH homologous sequences in the genomes of gray short-tailed opossum, tammar wallaby, and Tasmanian devil. the presence of inactive CMAH sequences, and the absence of Neu5Gc, was also reported in a number of new world monkeys. a deletion spanning coding exons 3\u201315 in all available New World monkey genomes, including those of Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis. the NCBI Genome database contains the genomes of seven Yinchiroptera and six Yangchiroptera species. CMAH gene could not be detected in two species belonging to Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae. gangliosides isolated from antlers of sika deer have been shown to contain both Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc. gangliosides isolated from antlers of sika deer (Cervus nippon) have been shown to contain both Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc. araneus (common shrew) and Condylura cristata (star-nosed mole) contained a putatively functional CMAH gene. the CMAH sequence of E. europaeus (common hedgehog) contained a premature stop codon in coding exon 12. chimpanzee CMAH coding sequence (CDS) consists of 15 exons. the phylogenetic distribution of the CMAH gene is present in 184 of the 323 genomes studied. the gene is present in two green algae and in a handful of bacteria and archaea. the gene is present in 184 of the 323 genomes studied. 41 of the coding sequences of putatively functional CMAH genes identified in our study have some unsequenced fraction (typically, one coding exon is unsequenced; supplementary table S2 and data sets S1\u2013S3, Supplementary Material online). the fact that CMAH was lost so many times during the evolution of deuterostomes strongly suggests that the gene is not essential. a list of species that lack a functional CMAH gene should be free from Neu5Gc if fed with a Neu5Gc-free diet. species lacking a functional CMAH gene may have undergone similar changes. new world monkeys, which lack a functional CMAH gene, have been proposed as model organisms for study of the effects of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies in xenotransplantation. asymptomatic hosts to viruses like Hantaviruses may lack the antigenic Neu5Gc on their viral envelopes."}
