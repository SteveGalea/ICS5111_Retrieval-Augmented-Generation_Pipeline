{"summary": "the epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic influenza (H1N1) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) hit the world with a high pathogenic potential in recent years. every day, nations are more internationally connected 4. the world health organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern to make a joint global effort to control the outbreak caused by Zika virus (ZIKV) in Latin America and the Caribbean 5, 6. the border with Mexico extends for 3,141 km, with a fringe of 100 km (62.5 miles) on each side of the border and an estimated population of 13 million people 16, 17. the development of systems and activities focusing on border epidemiological surveillance (BES) is essential both for domestic and global health security 18. study was carried out on the southern U.S. border with Mexico. this border has a length of approximately 3,141 km. the area includes four U.S. states (California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas) and six Mexican States (Baja California, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas) questionnaire application by digital media, an online survey development software, SurveyMonkey, was used (Research SurveyMonkey\u00ae) technical visits were carried out at agencies, institutions and partners (such as health surveillance agencies, immigration departments, national or multinational committees/groups, laboratories, etc.) the border region is defined as the area of land situated 100 km (62.5 miles) north and south from the international boundary. the area includes four U.S. states (California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas) and six Mexican States (Baja California, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Tamaulipas) with an estimated population of about 13 million people 17. technical visits were carried out at agencies, institutions and partners. interviews were conducted with stakeholders in their various operational levels. the scope of the questionnaire included operational attributes of surveillance, such as completeness, reciprocity, opportunity, feedback, and the quality of information. more than 55% of the technicians at several operational levels realize that the BES and their activities are high priority. only 38% of respondents in South America are familiar with the contact points involved in the notification and binational investigation. binational notification is recognized as High High Information exchange and Binational Notification Availability of Protocol 45% 33% 29% Clarity and Well defined of the pathways for communication between binational public health agencies 40% 22% 10% Familiarity with the contact points involved with the binational notification 55% 56% 38% Occurrence of binational exchange of epidemiological information 25% 33% 40% Feedback and Follow-up of the information Low Low Completeness of the epidemiological information Poor-Fair Poor-Fair Poor-Fair Poor- more than half of jurisdictions have the necessary tools to carry out information exchange. over 50% of respondents reported a lack of mechanisms for sharing personally identifiable information (PII), such as encrypted e-mails. U.S.-Mexico border Brazil Human, financial and technical support. 80% 22% 11% Technician\u2019s training Present Present Present Support (personnel, technical and financial support) to the neighboring country. the low frequency of training was cited as a major obstacle. documents that regulate the flow of information and samples of binational cases in the two borders were not identified. more than 55% of the technicians at several operational levels realize that the BES and their activities are high priority. only 38% of respondents in South America are familiar with the contact points involved in the notification and binational investigation. binational notification is recognized as High High Information exchange. binational notification is recognized as High High Information exchange. more than half of the jurisdictions have the necessary tools to carry out information exchange. the priorities and actions are defined in binational meetings involving various partners. on the U.S.-MX border, groups and meetings are important mechanisms used to share data to collaborate. in south America, there was no evidence of participation of organizations, such as the pan American health organization (PAHO), MERCOSUR, or the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in any local border activities. the binational surveillance activities 80% 22% 11% Technician\u2019s training Present Present Present Support (personnel, technical and financial support) to the neighboring country 55% 78% 87% With your neighboring country 55% - 16% Collaboration, support and / or exchange of technology Present Present Present The financial resources available is sufficient to carry out laboratory activities 35% 44% 43% The human resources available is sufficient to carry out the laboratory activities 35% 44% 60% Cross border laboratory training occur at least once a year 52% 7 low frequency of training was cited as a major obstacle. lack of guidelines describing steps of binational disease notification and investigation. major obstacle highlighted was lack of guidelines describing steps of binational disease notification and investigation. the inadequacy of many surveillance indicators may be related to the informality of the BES operational articulation. both international borders are defining their priorities and actions in these regions together with stakeholders and partners of the neighboring countries. lack of human, technical, and financial resources were major obstacles in Brazil and Mexico. countries with available resources should seek ways to standardize communication mechanisms 26. for most infectious diseases of public health concern, laboratory confirmation is essential for planning and triggering the control and prevention actions. a laboratory network able to meet demands of the border areas would increase sensitivity, opportunity, and system specificity 31. the study of their capacity to report infectious diseases showed a very low proportion (16,6%) of cases being reported in a timely manner ( 24 hours - as established nationally) the political organization of different countries for the entry and movement of people through borders are relevant factors in the comparison of surveillance systems and in the design of health systems. the neighboring country to begin the binational investigation. an online system for binational notification would be the tool of choice. all levels involved in the response could then input, search, and follow up in real time on all the epidemiological information of cases. development of surveillance systems at the borders will provide more effectiveness to the implementation of actions and responses. countries can improve their mechanisms to respond in future outbreaks."}
