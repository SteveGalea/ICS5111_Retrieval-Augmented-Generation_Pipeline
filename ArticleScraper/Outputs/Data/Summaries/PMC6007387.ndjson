{"summary": "prospectively enrolled children aged 6 months to 18 years were admitted to the Monroe Carell Jr. Children\u2019s Hospital at Vanderbilt. prospective subjects were identified by daily communication with the pediatric orthopedic surgery service. leukocidin (PVL) locus was extracted from 275 L of clinical sample. 20-L PCR reactions were prepared using 2X Platinum Multiplex Master Mix. amplification was performed in 96-well plates on the GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermocycler. 2 mL of synovial fluid (in cases of septic arthritis) or a swab of the infected area of bone (in cases of osteomyelitis) was placed into an ESwab transport tube for TEM-PCR. subjects were monitored using the Vanderbilt Electronic Medical Record to determine whether a pathogen was isolated by culture. the reverse universal primer was biotinylated for downstream detection. biotinylated amplicons were detected by hybridization to a detection probe covalently coupled to a glass microarray substrate. streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate was added. clindamycin-resistant (MRSA), 2 were clindamycin-resistant (both MSSA), and 8 were erythromycin-resistant.

TEM-PCR has the potential to inform antibiotic selection early in the disease course, decreasing the use of broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic regimens. the identification of a causative organism in MSKI is critical and allows for optimal targeted antimicrobial therapy. TEM-PCR was 100% concordant with culture-based methods for methicillin and clindamycin resistance testing. TEM-PCR allows for rapid AST results, decreasing time to optimal therapy and increasing antimicrobial stewardship. the limited sample size resulted in the identification of only 2 pathogen species."}
