{"summary": "PRRS virus is the causative agent of PRRS which contains a positive-sense, single-stranded, polyadenylated, 15 kb RNA genome. strains within each genotype vary considerably with genomic differences as high as 20%. recurrence of PRRS outbreaks is either caused by introduction of a new strain or the resident virus strain. method which can provide genetic information about the strain causing infection would allow for identification of potential reasons for vaccination failure. emergence of new virulent strains causes unexpected devastating outbreaks, such as the severe outbreaks of HP-PRRSV in china and MN184 outbreaks in the united states. the routine use of viral genome sequencing and genomic surveillance will serve as a powerful tool for PRRSV detection [37], but also provides researchers with a better understanding of PRRSV epidemiology and how the virus transmits, spreads, and evolves. the Oxford nanopore MinION sequencer allows for sequencing of the RNA molecule directly, in its native format. this feature, together with other characteristics such as low start-up costs, portability, and real-time data streaming, makes the sequencer a good candidate RNA Extraction and Viral Copy Number Determination PRRSV RNA was extracted from cell culture supernatants, virus-negative pig serum spiked with PRRSV, and clinical PRRSV-positive serum samples using the QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit. RNA was extracted from 300 L of serum, two thirds of which was used for sequencing. minION RNA sequencing requires a high amount of input RNA for library preparation (>500 ng) lower viral RNA concentration samples were supplemented with exogenous cellular RNA for sequencing library preparation. adding exogenous mRNA allows for protection of the flow cells, consistency between samples, especially those with low amounts of RNA. samples were sequenced for approximately 6 hours and adjusted for more or less time if needed. the estimated yield was monitored in real-time, samples were sequenced for approximately 6 hours and adjusted for more or less time if needed. the average coverage and accuracy across the genome were then evaluated using a window size of 1000 bp and visualized using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) the sequencing yield needed for viral strain detection was examined by generating datasets with targeted yields ranging from 3000 to 30,000,000 bases. groups with the desired yields were generated by setting a cutoff at the sequencing time in which the desired yield was reached. the PRRSV raw reads were compared to the custom PRRSV database using nucleotide BLAST (BLASTn) the top match, based on bit score, was regarded as the strain detected in the sample. this detected sequence was aligned to the known reference genome using Geneious software version R8.0.5 [54]. reads to the PRRSV database were extracted using minimap2 [50]. the top BLAST hit was recorded and the mapped and unmapped reads to the second top match were separated. the read length and accuracy were based on the results of the analytical sensitivity experiment. the sequencing data has been deposited to NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under accession numbers: SRR10292736 to SRR10292741. 2.1. Viral Strains and Samples A PRRSV type 2 isolate, VR2332 (GenBank: EF536003.1), was used as the main reference strain. RNA was extracted from 300 L of serum, two thirds of which was used for sequencing. the remaining third was used to determine the number of viral copies present. lower viral RNA concentration samples were supplemented with exogenous cellular RNA for sequencing library preparation. sequencing library was loaded onto a SpotON flow cell and sequenced using a minION Mk I sequencer (Oxford nanopore Technologies Ltd, Oxford, UK) the estimated yield was monitored in real-time, samples were sequenced for approximately 6 hours and adjusted for more or less time if needed. the average coverage and accuracy across the consensus genome was analyzed using a window size of 1000 bp. the average coverage and accuracy across the consensus genome was then evaluated using a window size of 1000 bp and visualized using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) the PRRSV raw reads were compared to the custom PRRSV database using nucleotide BLAST (BLASTn) the top match, based on bit score, was regarded as the strain detected in the sample. both the VR2332 whole genome and the ORF5 sequence were known and designated as the reference sequence to compare to the MinION generated sequences. PRRSV reads were extracted by mapping all reads to the PRRSV database using minimap2 [50]. the top BLAST hit was recorded and the mapped and unmapped reads to the second top match were again separated. the read length and accuracy were based on the results of the analytical sensitivity experiment. the sequencing data has been deposited to NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA). a total of 600 ng RNA was used for library preparation and sequencing, which was performed in duplicate. both sequencing runs generated more than 20 megabases (mb) total yield within one-hour of sequencing with the longest raw read over 15,000 bp in length. the majority of the reads were fairly small with only 11\u201312 reads over 10,000 bp. the sequence accuracy improved to 95.4% after generating a consensus using the longest raw read as a scaffold. this is not surprising since the sequence adapter was ligated to the poly(A) tail on the 3\u2019 end. if the RNA was partially degraded or RNA second structure hampered the movement of the RNA through the nanopores, only the 3\u2019 end would be sequenced, thus resulting in uneven coverage distribution. this was surprising since higher coverage can correct random sequencing errors and usually results in higher accuracy. a range of sequence yields from 3 kilobases (kb) to 30,000 kb were obtained from the two whole genome sequencing runs above. total reads were analyzed against a custom PRRSV database using BLASTn. a 99.9% identity was observed between the known sequence of the VR2332 strain used in this experiment. the minimum sequencing yield required for accurate PRRSV strain detection was found to be 3 kb (5 reads). a total sequencing yield of 15 mb (6 104 reads) allowed for accurate whole PRRSV genome generation. the total number of viral copies used for each MinION sequencing reaction was determined using RT-qPCR. the PRRSV strain was determined by analyzing total raw reads from sequencing against the custom PRRSV database. the top BLAST match was used to identify the viral strain present in the sample. 108 116,698 KC469618.1 100.0/99.9 699 5975 93.1 3.7 108 118,879 KC469618.1 100.0/99.9 422 6028 93.7 Spike-in 1.5 109 322,778 KC469618.1 100.0/99.9 1589 15,021 93.0 9.4 106 300,143 KC469618.1 100.0/99.9 45 3743 90.5 3.4 104 at least 3.8 106 viral copies were needed to detect viral sequence. the detection accuracy was 94%, increasing to 97% as the number of viral copies increased. a consensus sequence was not able to be obtained for 2 of the samples. more than 109 viral copies with perhaps 1500 PRRSV reads are recommended if the goal is to obtain a full-length genome sequence. if identification of the viral strain involved in infection is all that is needed, then clinical serum samples need only have 106\u2013107 viral copies to be successful. PRRSV reads were BLAST analyzed against the custom PRRSV database to identify the top match strain. if unmapped sequences remained, this pipeline was repeated to identify more than 2 PRRSV strains present in the sample. the control samples did not identify a second PRRSV sequence present (at any sequence yield) further investigation into the SDEU carry over contamination showed that reads were consistently generated during the entire sequencing run. this could not be minimized by removing the first few minutes of sequencing, they contaminated the entire sequencing run. this experiment was designed to differentiate field strains from vaccine strains. 44 98% ND 30,000 24,512 20,819 85% KC469618.1 (99.9) 20,472 98% ND VR2332 + SDEU mixed sample 30 38 23 61% KC469618.1 (99.9) 19 83% ND 300 375 234 62% KC469618.1 (99.9) 19 83% CS421743.1 (99.8) 35 15% ND 3000 3748 2281 61% KC469618.1 (99.9) 1722 7 VR2332 stock was used for RNA isolation and evaluation of minION direct RNA whole genome sequencing. a total of 600 ng RNA was used for library preparation and sequencing. one-hour sequencing was sufficient to generate more than enough reads for sequence analysis. insertion and deletion of U(T) nucleotides, and C/U(T) mismatches were the most frequently observed error patterns (Figure 1b). the depth of coverage across the PRRSV genome was observed to be extremely uneven with higher coverage on the 3\u2019 end of the genome. higher coverage can correct random sequencing errors. this would suggest the 3\u2019 end would have a much higher accuracy. this would suggest the 3\u2019 poly(A) tail would have a much higher accuracy. the length and accuracy of the longest reads, and generation of consensus sequences were further examined at different sequence yields. as sequencing yield increased, the length of the longest reads increased, as did the length of the consensus sequence, reaching a maximum level at a yield of 15,000 kb. the accuracy of the consensus sequence increased from about 92% to 95% from 15 kb to 7500 kb input yield, due to the increased depth of coverage. 109 1899 88.1% 1861 92.10% 12.3% 1 75 443 4036 84.1% 4081 91.95% 26.9% 5 150 790 4496 83.4% 4548 92.45% 30.0% 10 750 3500 7533 84.9% 7609 92.55% 50.1% 49 1500 6857 8382 85.8% 8435 94.20% 55.6% 99 7500 32,571 12,990 86.6% 12,988 95.20% 85. the analytical sensitivity difference related to sample type was unexpected, but, in fact, reasonable. one possible reason for this sensitivity difference could be related to viral RNA quality. the detection accuracy of the raw PRRSV reads was determined by comparing the top BLAST hit to the known ORF5 sequence. for clinical samples, at least 3.8 106 viral copies were needed in order to detect viral sequence. consensus sequence was not able to be obtained for 2 of the samples (spike-in 3.4 104 viral copies and clinical 3.8 106 viral copies) because of the low number of PRRSV reads present, so the longest PRRSV read was used for accuracy analysis instead of a consensus sequence (Table 3). the ratio of PRRSV reads to total reads was calculated and compared to the input viral copies. a strong positive correlation (r2 = 0.88) was observed. a range of sequence yields from 3 kilobases (kb) to 30,000 kb were obtained from the two whole genome sequencing runs above. the accuracy of the longest read at the different yields did not change. but the accuracy of the consensus sequence increased from 92% to 95% from 15 kb to 7500 kb input yield. the accuracy of the consensus sequence increased from about 92% to 95%. .7% 15,101 95.20% 99.5% 988 30,000 127,411 15,081 86.0% 15,171 95.50% 99.9% 1976 a average of two sequence runs. b consensus genome length (bp)/reference genome length (bp); c sequencing yield (bp)/reference genome size (bp). RNA degradation and decrease sample quality, resulting in lower sequencing yields. RT-qPCR, which is less sensitive to these conditions, can still detect the presence of the virus. the detection accuracy of the raw PRRSV reads was determined by comparing the top BLAST hit to the known ORF5 sequence and/or whole genome sequence. for cell supernatant and spike-in samples, the detection accuracy remains almost the same even as the viral copy number increased from an order of 104 to 109. longer and more accurate consensus sequences were generated when more viral copies were sequenced, with slight fluctuations due to variations in sequencer performance. a basically full-length genome with a consensus accuracy of 93.0% was observed in the spike-in sample containing 1.5 109 viral copies. the other three samples in which more than 109 viral copies were used as the input sample were also able to generate a consensus genome with an accuracy higher than 93%. Detection of multiple viral Isolates in a single sample In swine farms, PRRS outbreaks can occur even in herds that are vaccinated, therefore it is necessary to differentiate the presence of infectious field strains from vaccine to aid in outbreak investigation. the second strain could be identified with an accuracy >99.8%. if enough virus is present from both strains, they could be successfully detected in a single sample. previously, others have observed between-run carryover contamination on the same MinION flowcell. # of Total Reads # of PRRSV Reads PRRSV Reads /Total Reads First Match Second Match Third Match Top BLAST Match (identity %) # of Matching Reads % of PRRSV Reads Top BLAST Match (identity %) # of Matching Reads % of PRRSV Reads Control 30 25 20 80% KC469618.1 (99.9) 20 100% ND 300 245 210 86% KC469618.1 (99. the percentage of PRRSV reads that mapped to the first BLAST hit could be used as an indicator for the presence of other PRRSV strains. the samples that only contained VR2332 had >98% of PRRSV reads mapping to VR2332, while in the mixed strain samples less than 85% of the PRRSV reads mapped to VR2332. this study was planned and performed to assess the feasibility of Oxford Nanopore MinION DRS in clinical PRRSV diagnostics. key interests addressed included whether sequencing can detect PRRSV strains to identify an outbreak as occurring due to the introduction of a new strain or recirculation of a previous outbreak. both Sanger and Illumina sequencing can accurately detect PRRSV strains present in a sample, but both require transcription of RNA into cDNA followed by PCR amplification prior to sequencing. this feature is beneficial since no reverse transcription or PCR are needed thus eliminating biases that those introduce. DRS is not as sensitive as PCR for use as a diagnostic tool identifying viral presence. it can be used for further investigation of strain causing an outbreak. sensitivity of sequencing was higher from cell culture virus spiked into serum as opposed to clinical serum samples. this study begins the process of developing rapid and high-resolution PRRSV diagnostics for use in clinical situations where genomic data is urgently needed. the PRRSV RNA material presents the same technical demands for extraction, processing, and sequencing as do influenza virus, coronaviruses, picornaviruses, rotaviruses, and many foreign animal disease viruses."}
