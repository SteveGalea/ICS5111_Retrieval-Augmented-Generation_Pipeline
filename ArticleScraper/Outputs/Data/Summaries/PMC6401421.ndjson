{"summary": "noVs are responsible for 95% of nonbacterial gastroenteritis and 50% of all gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. they belong to the Caliciviridae family and are divided into seven genogroups (GI to GVII), with each genogroup further divided into several genotypes. prototype GI.1 norwalk virus (NV Pro) and GI.4 Chiba virus (CV Pro) revealed a common catalytic triad in the active sites. cysteine 139 (C139), histidine 30 (H30), and glutamate 54 (E54) form a catalytic triad (21) in the active sites with a cysteine acting as a nucleophile. the overall structure of the HOV Pro is conserved, but there are several significant changes in the orientation of residues comprising the active site. the side chain of an arginine residue (R112) is found inserted in the active site of the HOV Pro making interactions with the catalytic H30 residue. we suggest a pH-dependent role for R112 in modulating substrate and inhibitor binding to the HOV Pro. the significance of dimer formation by the noV proteases is not yet established. the dimeric forms have been reported to be important for the functions of other viral cysteine proteases, such as hepatitis A virus 3C protease and coronavirus 3C protease. the inset shows a close view of the catalytic residues H30, E54, C139 (magenta) and R112 (yellow) of the S2 pocket rendered as sticks, with nitrogen shown in blue and oxygen shown in red. the distance between the residues is indicated by black dashed lines. compared to the S1 pocket, the S2 pocket shows more significant structural changes. the side chain of H115 forms a hydrogen bond interaction with that of E75, which stabilizes the bII-cII loop in the structure of NV Pro. the side chain of H115 forms a hydrogen bond interaction with that of E75. the inset shows the structural changes of the bII-cII loop between HOV and NV proteases. active site residues H30, E54, and C139 and the S2 substrate-binding pocket residue R112 are shown as sticks and colored as in panel A. H30 closely interacts with the side chain of R112 via a cation- interaction. the side chain of E54 has to be turned away from the active site. the orientation of the imidazole ring of H30 is markedly different from that observed in previous noV Pro structures. the decapeptide sequence containing P1 to P5 and P1\u2032 to P5\u2032 correspond to the cleavage sites between p48 and p41 in their respective polyproteins. while HOV Pro was active at pH 8, it showed extremely low activity at pH 6.5. in contrast, NV Pro was optimally active at pH 8 and retained its activity, although at a reduced level, at pH 6.5. mutating R112 to alanine in the HOV Pro resulted in a higher affinity for the substrate and higher cleavage efficiency of the HOV Pro R112A (kcat/Km = 968.1 M1s1) compared to that of wild-type HOV Pro. results show that R112 plays an important role in substrate affinity/activity of the protease. Syc-10, with a bulkier phenylalanine at the P2 position, Ki for the mutant was 7.5 M, compared to 24.6 M for the wild-type protease. this strongly suggests that in the absence of the arginine sidechain, the inhibitors were relatively more efficient in inhibiting the R112A mutant compared to the wild type. the overall structure is conserved and is comprised of a chymotrypsin-like fold with an N-terminal -barrel domain and a C-terminal twisted -sheet domain separated by a cleft where the active site is located. all four monomers (A, B, C, and D) in the asymmetric unit were similar and superimposed with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.

whereas in the GI protease structures it is generally unstructured (Fig. 2B to D) inset shows structural changes of the bII-cII loop between HOV and NV proteases. active site residues H30, E54, and C139 and the S2 substrate-binding pocket residue R112 are shown as sticks. triad residues form a network of hydrogen bonds with nucleophilic C139 interacting with basic H30. triad residues form a network of hydrogen bonds with nucleophilic C139 interacting with basic H30. triad residues form a network of hydrogen bonds with nucleophilic C139 interacting with basic H30. the side chain of C139 is also oriented slightly differently compared to the NV Pro structure. such a hydrogen bond interaction is not observed in other GI protease structures. we hypothesize that R112 could influence the catalytic activity of HOV Pro in a pH-dependent manner. substrate hydrolysis was measured by FRET by mixing the protease at increasing concentrations with the fluorogenic peptide substrate. all experiments were carried out in triplicate. the standard errors of Km and kcat were generated by GraphPad software. the structures showed the P1 and P2 residues fit firmly into the S1 and S2 pockets of the NV Pro. the reactive group forms a covalent adduct with C139, preventing the formation of the oxyanion hole in the active site. both inhibitors showed significantly reduced potency compared to that of the NV Pro (26). substrate hydrolysis was measured by FRET in the presence of the Syc-10 and Syc-59 inhibitors. all experiments were carried out in triplicate using GraphPad Prism 7. inhibitors targeting the viral protease have emerged as new targets for antiviral treatments and disease prevention. the overall structure of the HOV Pro resembles those of the GI protease structures. the bII-cII loop of the S2 pocket is highly flexible (22), and the S2 pocket of the NV Pro is larger than the S2 pocket of the NV Pro. enterovirus 71 3C protease (EV71 Pro) structure showed significant changes in the active site. hepatitis A 3C protease lacks the third member of the catalytic triad. the structure of the hepatitis A protease revealed a water molecule. the rotamer analysis of the negatively charged Y143 showed that any of the possible side chain orientations cannot come close to the active site side chain to make a similar interaction with H30. the same analysis of the R112 in the CV Pro structure showed that alternate conformations of the R112 sidechain could engage in similar R112-H30 interactions to those observed in the HOV Pro structure. at pH 6.5, the protonation state of the imidazole ring of H30 increases, shifting the equilibrium more toward the aromatic (-system) state and allowing it to participate in a stabilizing cation- interaction with R112. at pH 8, however, the protonation state of the H30 decreases, and the equilibrium shifts more toward the cationic state of the imidazole ring. with the sidechain of R112 moved away, the side chain of E54 HOV Pro exhibits lower enzyme efficiency than NV Pro. this surprising observation raises a set of interesting questions. a lower rate of polyprotein cleavage by the HOV Pro could be advantageous for the GII.4 NoVs. changes in the HOV Pro active site reduce the potency of GI inhibitors. the inhibitors designed based on the GI structures were less inhibitory to the HOV Pro (50) HOV Pro structure shows significant differences compared to those of GI proteases. the overall structure of the HOV Pro resembles those of the GI proteases. the bII-cII loop of the S2 pocket is highly flexible (22) residues and presence of the R112 side chain in the active site contribute to reduced inhibitor efficiencies against the HOV Pro. in the HOV Pro, the role of the E54 residue in stabilizing catalytic H30 appears to be taken up by R112. residue, tyrosine 143 (Y143), was also found in the active site. the distances between Y143 and H44 or Y143 were too great to make any hydrogen bonds. the role of the negatively charged Y143 was to electrostatically stabilize a positive charge of the H44 imidazole ring during the rate-limiting transition state. the NV and the HOV Pro are completely inactive at a pH of 6.5. both the NV and the HOV Pro are completely inactive at a pH of 6.0. both the NV and the HOV Pro are completely inactive at a pH of 6.0. a structure of the HOV Pro in complex with its native substrate would shed definitive light on the mechanism of substrate binding to the HOV Pro and R112. the histidine-arginine pairing of the catalytic residues has not been observed in any other viral cysteine proteases. this surprising observation raises a set of interesting questions. a lower rate of polyprotein cleavage by the HOV Pro could be advantageous for the GII.4 noVs. the inhibitors designed based on the GI structures were less inhibitory to the HOV Pro (50) the structure reveals unique interactions between the catalytic residues of the GI.1 and GII.4 protease HOV Pro.

ABY27559). mM NaH2PO4 (pH 8), 100 mM NaCl, and 5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) buffer until further use. the mutant was generated by Epoch Life Science, Inc. (Sugar Land, TX) and expressed in the BL21(DE3) cells. peptides Glu(EDANS)-GDYELQGPEDLA-Lys(Dabcyl) and Glu(EDANS)-EPDFLQGPEDLAK-Lys(Dabcyl) were synthesized with the fluorescent dye Edans. when the peptide is cleaved by the protease, the dye is no longer quenched. fluorescence signal was monitored for 120 min at 90-sec intervals at 37\u00b0C. initial velocities, Michaelis constants (Km) and catalytic constant (kcat) were calculated using nonlinear regression analysis. the proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. followed by a thrombin cleavage site (LVPRGS) the proteins were cleaved off by using thrombin (Haematologic Technologies, Inc., Darmstadt, Germany) a complete data set was collected to a resolution of 2.7. the diffraction data were collected using a 0.5\u00b0-oscillation angle. the previously determined structure of NV protease (PDB 4IN1) (25) was used. the peptide is cleaved by the protease, resulting in an increase in fluorescence. the assays were performed in 50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 8, 6.5, or 5), 100 mM NaCl. the atomic structure coordinates of the norovirus GII.4 protease have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession number 6NIR. the X-ray structure of a catalytically inactive C139A mutant of another GII.4 protease (Minerva strain) was reported."}
