{"summary": "short linear motifs (SLiMs, LMs or MiniMotifs) are regulatory protein modules characterized by their compact interaction interfaces. SLiMs bind with relatively low affinity (in the low-micromolar range), an advantageous attribute for use as transient, conditional and tunable interactions necessary for many regulatory processes. this evolutionary plasticity facilitates the rapid proliferation within a proteome. the ELM initiative (http://elm.eu.org) has focused on gathering, storing and providing information about short linear motifs since 2003. it was established as the first manually annotated collection of SLiM classes and as a tool for discovering linear motif instances in proteins (13). 111 Human 1004 MOD 30 Mouse 160 Biological process 173 From ELM motif 787 TRG 21 Rat 102 CLV 8 Fly 67 Cell compartment 74 From instance 1071 Yeast 90 Other 417 Molecular function 93 aAs of October 2011. the user can submit a query sequence to the motif detection pipeline either as UniProt accession number or in FASTA format. 24 new ELM classes have been added to the database. one of the newly annotated motif classes is the AGC kinase docking motif (LIG_AGCK_PIF), consisting of three distinct classes. the motif interacts with the PDK1 Interacting Fragment (PIF) pocket in the kinase domain of AGC kinases. the AGCK docking motif mediates intramolecular interactions to the PDK1 Interacting Fragment (PIF) pocket. the motif is a cis-activating module LIG_AGCK_PIF_2 LIG_AGCK_PIF_3 LIG_BIR_II_1 IAP-binding motifs are found in pro-apoptotic proteins. phospho-dependent degron binds the FBW7 F box proteins of the SCF (Skp1-Cullin-Fbox) complex LIG_SCF_FBW7_2 LIG_SPAK-OSR1_1 SPAK/OSR1 kinase binding motif in a deep groove. new ELM instances Annotated ELM instances serve as representative examples of the respective ELM class. motif interacts with the PDK1 Interacting Fragment (PIF) pocket in the kinase domain of AGC kinases. it mediates intramolecular binding to the PIF pocket, serving as a cis-activating module and other regulatory sequences in the C-tail. PDK1 in turn will phosphorylate and activate the docked kinase. eIF4E LIG_eIF4E_2 LIG_EVH1_3 A proline-rich motif binding to EVH1/WH1 domains of WASP and N-WASP proteins LIG_HCF-1_HBM_1 The DHxY Host Cell Factor-1 binding motif interacts with the N-terminal kelch propeller domain of the cell cycle regulator HCF-1 LIG_Integrin_isoDGR_1. ase binding motif acts as a docking site which aids the interaction with their binding partners including the upstream activators and the phosphorylated substrates aAs of October 2011. new ELM instances Annotated ELM instances serve as representative examples of the respective ELM class. they are also invaluable for computational analysis and classification of motifs (15). a full-text search (here, search term used was \u2018AP2\u2019), filtering for \u2018true positive\u2019 instances in taxon \u2018Homo sapiens\u2019 assists in finding annotated instances. a full-text search (here, search term used was \u2018AP2\u2019), filtering for \u2018true positive\u2019 instances in taxon \u2018Homo sapiens\u2019, yielding 58 instances. a search can be restricted to a particular taxonomy or instance logic (top) the number of possible ELM classes on this candidate list exceeds the number of completely annotated classes, indicating the great demand for further annotation. a candidate page has been introduced to display novel motif classes that have not yet been annotated in detail or are currently undergoing annotation. conservation of linear motifs can help in assessing functional relevance of putative instances. functional instances show higher overall sequence conservation than non-functional ones. phosphorylation annotations from the Phospho.ELM resource have been added to the graphical output. a 3D model of representative protein databank structures of linear motif interactions was added to the ELM detail page. a novel query interface was introduced to assist the user in finding information of interest. the search results can also be filtered and reordered using buttons and table headers. a candidate page has been introduced to display novel ELM classes that have not yet been annotated in detail or are currently undergoing annotation. the number of possible ELM classes on this candidate list exceeds the number of completely annotated classes, indicating the great demand for further annotation. phosphorylation annotations from the Phospho.ELM resource (25) have been added to the graphical output. phosphorylation annotations from the Phospho.ELM resource (25) have been added to the graphical output. more than 200 viral instances found in 84 different viral taxons have been added. the notion of viruses abusing existing SLiMs in their hosts is demonstrated by viral instances being annotated alongside instances in their hosts\u2019 proteins. a related disease, \u2018Noonan-like syndrome\u2019, is caused by an S to G mutation at position 2 of the SHOC2 protein, creating a novel myristoylation site. APPLICATION OF THE ELM RESOURCE By providing a high-quality, manually curated data set of linear motif classes with experimentally validated SLiM instances. small-scale (single protein) analyzes benefit from the detailed annotation of each ELM class in attributing novel features to proteins of interest. despite their importance and abundance, our understanding of linear motifs is still limited. this is mainly owing to the fact that they are still quite difficult to predict computationally and to investigate experimentally (3,41,42)"}
