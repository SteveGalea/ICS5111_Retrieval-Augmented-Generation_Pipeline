{"summary": "modern vaccines are based on the research of Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteur. in 1798, Edward Jenner introduced cowpox pustule fluid into people to induce protection against smallpox. in Latin, vacca means cow, honoring Edward Jenner's experiment. over 200 diseases are currently classified as zoonoses, which are global or inherent to a specific region of the world. human can be infected through insects such as mosquitoes and ticks, handling or eating undercooked or raw meat. the development of animal vaccines has a critical function to prevent humans from infection with pathogens by removing the root cause of the infected animal. porcine circovirus infection rate increased dramatically and its symptoms have become more severe since 2004. porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) affected pigs. pigs showed severe wasting symptoms. porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) virus-like particles (VLPs) decreased to 0.9%. virus can infect the fetus and cause abortion. virus can infect the fetus and cause abortion. the structure of the VLP vaccine is large and unique to microbes. it can stimulate B cells and proliferate CD4 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses. the stimulation of B cells by VLPs is strong enough to elicit T cell independent IgM antibody induction [16] the new FMD VLP vaccine could maintain neutralization with antibodies greater than 6 (Log 2), up to 22 weeks post-vaccination. the new technology makes it possible to manufacture dangerous virus vaccines that are only approved in high-level barrier facilities without infection risks. RNA Particle Vaccine for Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea (PED) case was reported in the united states for the first time. the villous height/crypt depth ratio was the range of normal sucking piglets (H&E staining, scale bar=100 m) one US venture company, Harris Vaccine Inc., employed alphavirus vector technology to produce a PED vaccine. the new vaccine became the first PED virus vaccine to receive a conditional US Department of Agriculture license since the first PED outbreak. the alphavirus vector vaccine has shown its efficacy in protection against lethal dose virus challenges, non-viral pathogens, and even cancers [27]. RNA particle vaccines based on the alphavirus vector were explained in Table 1. Table 1. Comparison of the RNA particle vaccine to traditional vaccines Variable Traditional vaccine RNA particle vaccine Killed virus Modified live Extract antigen RNA particle Humoral immunity + + + Cellular immunity - + - May cause disease - + - Grow agent + + s are made from the baculovirus in insect cells and the VEE virus. they can reduce the time for development and make it possible to produce the highly pathogenic vaccine antigens without high-level barrier facilities. the most important advantage of these technologies allow us to confront viral diseases in a relatively short time."}
