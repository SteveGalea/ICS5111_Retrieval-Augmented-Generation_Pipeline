{"summary": "Candida albicans is a commensal microbe that colonizes the oropharynx, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts of healthy individuals. invasive candidiasis and bloodstream infections occur almost exclusively in immunosuppressed patients. systemic candidiasis is increasingly responsible for serious and often fatal fungal infections in humans (9) and is a major cause of hospital-acquired infections in developed countries (10, 11) echinocandins, the newest class of antifungals, were introduced in 2001. at that time they were the first new antifungals to be approved in 15 years. discovery of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in leukocytes and epithelia of mammals primed investigations to utilize these molecules for the treatment of infectious diseases. rhesus macaque neutrophils revealed potent microbicidal activities against bacteria and fungi, including C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. selective antibody neutralization of -defensins in extracts of rhesus macaque neutrophil granules ablates killing of C. albicans by these preparations. RESULTS RTD-1 kills drug-sensitive and MDR C. albicans. both organisms were killed in a time- and concentration-dependent manner by RTD-1. however, drug-sensitive ATCC 18804 was killed more rapidly. experiments were repeated twice using three biological replicates. Killing of C. albicans by RTD-1 correlates with the permeabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane (39) exposure of C. albicans ATCC 18804 to 94 g/ml Hst 5 caused a time-dependent release of ATP that plateaued at approximately 30 min. RTD-1 produced an equally rapid release of ATP, which peaked at 30 min and then dropped to 25% of the peak level by 90 min. the decline in ATP levels, measured 90 min after RTD-1 exposure, was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. g/ml Hst 5 causes much more gradual ATP release. the reduction of ATP levels observed at 90 min in RTD-1 containing incubations was dose-dependently reversed by ATPase inhibitor concanamycin A. incubation of both strains with 6.25 g/ml RTD-1 generated ROS within 10 min of peptide exposure. Interestingly, ROS accumulation was substantially higher in cells of ATCC 64124, the MDR strain. expression of -defensin isoforms differs from that of macaques granulocytes. -defensins retain their microbicidal activities in isotonic buffers. -defensins retain their microbicidal activities in isotonic buffers. MDR C. albicans ATCC 64124 was much more susceptible than drug-sensitive ATCC 18804 to RTDs 1-3, which killed >95% of the input inoculum at 30 g/ml. the lack of Hst 5 activity in divalent cations is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that Ca2+ blocks the binding of the peptide to the fungal cell surface. five micrograms of RTD-1 or Hst 5 was incubated with lysates of C. albicans cells. one-fifth of each incubation mixture (1.0 g input) was loaded in each well. control lanes were loaded with 1.0 g of untreated RTD-1 or Hst 5. all strains tested were resistant to one or more classes of antifungals. all peptides inhibited growth of fluconazole-resistant (MIC, 128 g/ml) isolates, including those that were echinocandin or 5-flucytosine resistant. 10231 6.25 6.25 12.5 12.5 12.5 1.125 12.5 25 6.25 12.5 12.5 1.25 1.125 12.5 25 6.25 12.5 1.25 1.125 12.5 25 6.25 12.5 1.25 1.125 12.5 25 6.25 12.5 1.25 1.25 1.125 12.5 25 6.25 12.5 1.25 1.25 1.125 12.5 25 6.25 12.5 1.25 1.25 1.125 12.5 25 6.25 12.5 1.25 1.25 1.25 1.125 12.5 25 6.25 12.5 1.25 a CLSI protocol was used to determine MICs for each -defensin and amphotericin B (Amp B) and fluconazole (Fluco) ATCC phenotypes (S, susceptible; R, resistant; I, intermediate) are reported for one or more echinocandin (Echin), triazole, or 5-flucytosine (5-Flu) krusei strains were highly active against fluconazole- and caspofungin-resistant C. auris strains. the fungicidal actions of the non-albicans Candida species were confirmed by determining MFCs (99% CFU reduction), which were in each case 1 to 2 times the corresponding MICs.

RTD-1 rapidly permeabilizes C. albicans. cells were incubated with 5 g/ml RTD-1. incubation with 94 g/ml Hst 5 results in little PI uptake. the decline in ATP levels, measured 90 min after RTD-1 exposure, was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. concanamycin A, an ATPase inhibitor, was added to the incubation at time (T) = 0, and the inhibitor at 8 M reduced the decline in ATP levels by 42%. ATPase is implicated in the reduction of accumulated ATP in RTD-1-treated C. albicans strains. preincubation of ATCC 18804 cells with sodium azide (1 mM, 2 h) markedly reduced ATP release in control cells as well as in cells exposed to 0.5 g/ml RTD-1 or 94 g/ml Hst 5. fungicidal effects of RTD-1 are not dependent on mitochondrial ATP phosphorylation. DCFH-DA fluorescence was measured in drug-sensitive C. albicans ATCC 18804 and MDR ATCC 64124 after incubation with 6.25 g/ml RTD-1 for the indicated intervals. the significance of the effect of RTD-1 treatment at all time points was a P value of 0.0001. -defensins retain their microbicidal activities in isotonic buffers (36, 39), conditions that inhibit the microbicidal activities of - and -defensins (27, 28). -defensins retain their microbicidal activities in isotonic buffers (36, 39), conditions that inhibit the microbicidal activities of - and -defensins. the lack of Hst 5 activity in divalent cation-containing medium is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that Ca2+ blocks the binding of the peptide to the fungal cell surface. incubations were carried at 37\u00b0C, diluted 1:50, plated onto SD plates, and CFU quantified after 48 h. five micrograms of RTD-1 or Hst 5 was incubated with lysates of C. albicans cells. one-fifth of each incubation mixture (1.0 g input) was loaded in each well. control lanes were loaded with 1.0 g of untreated RTD-1 or Hst 5. all strains tested were inhibited by each of the -defensins.
