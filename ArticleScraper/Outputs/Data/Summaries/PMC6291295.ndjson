{"summary": "the current state of the HIV epidemic in Washington, DC, provides an example of the ongoing risk of OIs in current patient populations. among individuals with known HIV infection, only 63% are virally suppressed, with only 47% of youth with HIV infection being virally suppressed. the guidelines currently rely on observational data from patients with HIV infection. some of the recommendations are extrapolated from other patient populations. a 35-year-old patient recently diagnosed with HIV infection has a nadir CD4+ cell count of 90/L and is on dolutegravir-based ART. the biofire upper respiratory panel tests for a number of bacteria such as Bordetella, Chlamydophila pneumonia, and Mycoplasma pneumonia. if the specimen is positive for coronavirus, the clinician might assume that coronavirus has caused the clinical illness, assuming the clinical illness is compatible with patients may have colonization in their lower respiratory tracts with respiratory viruses, or with MAC, Cryptococcus, or Pneumocystis. a negative PCR test is convincing evidence that the pathogen is not present. a positive result, however, must be evaluated in the context of the clinical situation. the most suggestive finding would be toxoplasma, because it is the only organism among these that is not ordinarily found in the respiratory tract as a latent organism. if the laboratory does not perform immunofluorescence, guidelines are struggling with how to make a diagnosis for Pneumocystis. there have been few changes in recommendations for prophylaxis except for the recommendations for MAC. the current IAS-USA guidelines1,2 do not recommend primary MAC prophylaxis for individuals on effective ART. data from San Francisco show declining mortality from AIDS-defining opportunistic infections, including MAC, with many patients having long-term survival after MAC diagnosis. the NIH, CDC, and IDSA will likely also recommend that no primary MAC prophylaxis is needed if effective ART is initiated and viral suppression is achieved. in the united states, the frequency of asymptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia is low. approximately 2.9% of asymptomatic patients with a CD4+ cell count below 100/L and 4.6% with CD4+ cell counts below 50/L have a positive cryptococcal antigen test. the range of antigen titers observed in these cases spans from very low to impressively high. a number of studies have examined whether higher doses of azoles can be as effective as amphotericin B. the proportions of patients with negative CSF cultures at week 10 were 45%, 56%, and 60% with fluconazole doses of 1200, 1600, and 2000 mg/day. a new recombinant adjuvant vaccine has become available. it is 68% effective for reducing the occurrence of clinical varicella zoster virus infection in post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. there are very limited data in HIV infection. clinical response was observed in 77 (93%) of 83 patients. treatment-limiting toxicity of TMP-SMX was observed in 6 patients. atovaquone is not as reliable as sulfadiazine-pyrimethamine. hepatitis A is not considered an HIV-associated OI and is unlikely to be featured in OI guidelines. hepatitis A immunization should be offered to all individuals with HIV infection who are seronegative for antibody to hepatitis A virus. a 35-year-old patient recently diagnosed with HIV infection has a nadir CD4+ cell count of 90/L and is on dolutegravir-based ART. for the biofire 2 panel, the appropriate specimen to detect upper respiratory pathogens is a nasopharyngeal swab (not nasal swab), so that cells in the posterior retropharynx are collected. a negative PCR test is convincing evidence that the pathogen is not present. a positive result, however, must be evaluated in the context of the clinical situation. some pathogens that colonize the airways of an individual with HIV infection are so rarely the cause of pulmonary dysfunction. CMV and coronavirus are rarely the cause of serious lower respiratory tract infection in individuals with HIV infection. if the laboratory does not perform immunofluorescence, guidelines are struggling with how to make a diagnosis for Pneumocystis. there have been few changes in recommendations for prophylaxis except for the recommendations for MAC. the current IAS-USA guidelines1,2 do not recommend primary MAC prophylaxis for individuals on effective ART. data from San Francisco show declining mortality from AIDS-defining OIs, including MAC, with the advent of potent combination ART. the NIH, CDC, and IDSA will likely also soon recommend that no primary MAC prophylaxis is needed if effective ART is initiated and viral suppression is achieved. approximately 2.9% of asymptomatic patients with a CD4+ cell count below 100/L and 4.6% with CD4+ cell counts below 50/L have a positive cryptococcal antigen test. a lumbar puncture should be performed to determine if the patient has asymptomatic meningeal infection. liposomal amphotericin B plus flucytosine is the regimen of choice. a number of studies have examined whether higher doses of azoles can be as effective as amphotericin B. the proportion of patients with negative CSF cultures at week 10 were 45%, 56%, and 60% with fluconazole doses of 1200, 1600, and 2000 mg/day. it is 68% effective for reducing the occurrence of clinical varicella zoster virus infection in post-hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. there are very limited data in HIV infection, with 2 small studies having assessed safety and immunologic response, but not clinical efficacy. treatment-limiting toxicity of TMP-SMX was observed in 6 patients (7%) a small comparative trial reported in 1998 showed no difference in progression rates between 35 patients receiving pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine (14%) and 37 receiving TMP-SMX (16%) hepatitis A is not considered an HIV-associated OI and is unlikely to be featured in OI guidelines. hepatitis A immunization should be offered to all individuals with HIV infection who are seronegative for antibody to hepatitis A virus."}
