{"summary": "Background Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is a highly contagious viral disease of swine, characterized by severe vomiting, diarrhea, and high mortality. the vaccines for it are only partially effective and no specific drug is available for treatment of TGEV infection. RNA interference has been confirmed as a new approach for controlling viral infections. attenuated and inactivated vaccines have the risk of reverting to a virulent form and may even induce an adverse reaction. the vaccines for TGEV do not provide effective protection at 7 days after administration. RNA interference (RNAi) has been confirmed as a post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism. the deletion of TGEV ORF 7 by reverse genetics may be related to the viral virulent and promotes an intensified dsRNA-activated host antiviral response. RNAi targeting to the ORF 7 gene will result in the degradation of both the sub-genomic mRNA for ORF 7 and the other sub-genomic mRNAs. the relative amount of ORF 7 gene in mock control cells was regarded as 1.000. the relative amounts of ORF 7 gene in cells infected with TGEV after being transfected with pGPU6-GFP/207, pGPU6-GFP/238, pGPU6-GFP/241, pGPU6-GFP/241, pGPU6-GFP/241, pGPU6-GFP/241, pGPU titers of TGEV were 102.51, 104.48, 103.31, 103.54 and 106.83 TCID50/ml in cells infected with TGEV before being transfected with shRNAs. titers of TGEV in cells infected with TGEV before being transfected with shRNAs were 102.43, 104.40, 103.25, 103.35 and 106.49 TCID50/ml pGPU6-GFP/241 and pGPU6-GFP/276 showed partial virus replication inhibition. TCID50 values are the means of three repeat titrations. error bars represent the SD. OD values represent the mean SD of three separate experiments performed six times. the cytopathic effect (CPE) and apoptosis of cells stably expressing shRNAs were examined by fluorescence microscopy. the negative control pGPU6-GFP/NC had no apparent inhibitory effect on TGEV-induced CPE and apoptosis. however, a small area of mild CPE was seen in the cells expressing pGPU6-GFP/241 and pGPU6-GFP/276. a small area of mild CPE was seen in the cells expressing pGPU6-GFP/207. pGPU6-GFP/207, pGPU6-GFP/238, pGPU6-GFP/241, pGPU6-GFP/241, pGPU6-GFP/241, pGPU6-GFP/241, pGPU6-GFP/241, pGPU6-GFP/276 and pGPU6-GFP/NC were 0.006, 0.474, 0.108, 0.124 and titers of TGEV were 102.51, 104.48, 103.31, 103.54 and 106.83 TCID50/ml. titers of TGEV were 102.43, 104.40, 103.25, 103.35 and 106.49 TCID50/ml. pGPU6-GFP/207 showed a maximum inhibition. TCID50 values are the means of three repeat titrations. error bars represent the SD. titers of TGEV in ST cells stably expressing shRNAs. OD492 of solutions in ST cells stably expressing pGPU6-GFP/NC was 0.455 and 0.332, respectively. in ST cells expressing pGPU6-GFP/207, pGPU6-GFP/241 or pGPU6-GFP/276 were 2.001, 1.707 and 1.772, respectively. this showed that ST cells expressing shRNAs were protected from TGEV destruction. NC had no apparent inhibitory effect on TGEV-induced CPE and apoptosis. a small area of mild CPE was seen in the cells expressing pGPU6-GFP/241 and pGPU6-GFP/276. this indicates that these plasmids were less effective than pGPU6-GFP/207 at protecting ST cells against TGEV-induced destruction. pGPU6-GFP/207, pGPU6-GFP/241and and pGPU6-GFP/276 could cover 95% (19/20), 75% (15/20) and 75% (15/20) of TGEV strains. pGPU6-GFP/207, pGPU6-GFP/241and and pGPU6-GFP/276 could cover 95% (19/20), 75% (15/20) and 75% (15/20) of TG two strategies were used to detect the inhibitory effect of shRNAs on both the ORF 7 gene and TGEV genome. the first approach was that cells were infected with TGEV after being transfected with shRNAs, in which the shRNAs were used as preventive substances. the second strategy was that shRNAs of ORF 7 gene were used as therapeutic agents and transfected after the cells were infected. d as the ORF 7 gene is included in all the sub-genomic mRNAs. the downstream gene of ORF 7 gene could be degraded with the ORF 7 gene according to the characteristics of RNAi. the reverse genetics deletion will only affect the ORF 7 gene itself. pGPU6-GFP/NC formed large bodies and were stained red by PI. cells expressing pGPU6-GFP/207 were completely protected from apoptosis. the nuclei showed normal morphology and the cell membrane was intact. gene of TGEV H16 strain (GenBank accession no: FJ755618) were designed based on the website siRNA designing tools (http://www.ambion.com/techlib/misc/siRNA_finder.html and https://rnaidesigner.invitrogen.com/rnaiexpress/) the sequences were analyzed by BLAST to ensure that they did not have significant nucleotide sequence homology with the swine TTTCAAGAGA AGAAAGATTACTCGAAGCACCCTAG-3 pGPU6-GFP/241 5\u2019-CACCGCTGCTACAGTTAGTCATCATTCAAGAGA TGACTAACAATCTGTAGCAGCCTAG-3\u2019 TGEV infection of transfected ST cells Twenty-four hours before being transfected, cells were seeded into six-well dishes in high-glucose DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) the cell cultures were collected for a real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis at 40 h post-infection. the cell cultures were collected for a real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis at different time points post-infection. PCR was performed in an iQ5 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, USA) 42 cycles of amplification were performed at 95\u00b0C for 5 s, 58\u00b0C for 10 s, and 72\u00b0C for 15 s. data were analyzed according to the Ct method, where the amount of RNA in samples normalized to -actin.
