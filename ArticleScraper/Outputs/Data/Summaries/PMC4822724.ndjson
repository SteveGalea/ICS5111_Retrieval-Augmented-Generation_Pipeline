{"summary": "bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a leading cause of death of feedlot cattle. annual costs associated with BRD total more than one billion dollars. environmental stress, compromised host immunity and virus infection predispose the animal to bacterial lung infection. BRBV (EC 11, EU236594; 140032-2, KP236130; BSRI1, KP264980; BSRI2, KP264976-KP264979; and BSRI3, KP264975).7,8,13 In the new era of deep sequencing, metagenomic profiling of biological samples has yielded a greater diversity of pathogens than was previously detectable. FMDV is a +ssRNA virus with a large open reading frame (ORF) as with other Aphthoviruses, the FMDV ORF encodes a polyprotein that is subsequently proteolytically cleaved into a series of intermediate and mature proteins. the P1 region encodes four structural proteins: VP4 (1A), VP2 (1B), VP3 (1C), and VP1 (1D) a large percentage of the published in silico experiments were conducted using viruses belonging to Enterovirus, Aphthovirus, and Teschovirus genera. recombination events and potential \u201crecombination breakpoint hotspots\u201d17 in the FMDV genome are reportedly confined to regions encoding the non-structural proteins. positive selection pressure was first determined in the Aphthovirus genus involving BRAV RS3X and then within BRV species to infer evolutionary ancestry of BRAV RS3X. bioinformatics tools employed in this study help to elucidate the molecular diversity of Aphthoviruses and help to distinguish BRAV from other members of the virus lineage. 5\u2032 end of the genome was isolated by using a commercially available rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) kit (SMARTTM RACE; Clontech Laboratories Inc.) a 3\u2032 anchored cDNA was synthesized using the complimentary gene specific primer (VP3-R1: 5\u2032 TTGGGCCTCACTCAGAGAGTGGGGGAT-3\u2032) the integrity of amplicons was confirmed on a 1% agarose gel. all other GenBank accession numbers are indicated either in figures or figure legends. evolutionary history of BRAV RS3X was inferred by building P1 and 3Dpol coding region phylogeny in Picornaviridae. HKY 95 model was used as a nucleotide substitution bias model. trees were inferred by neighbor-joining method and significance levels were set at P 0.05 or Bayes factor 0.50. recombination analysis Possible recombination events among different Aphthoviruses and BRVs were assessed separately. to the 3\u2032 UTR end were amplified in a model PTC-200 thermal cycler. the PCR reaction conditions were according to manufacturer's recommendations for amplification products between 5 kilobase (kb) pairs and 9 kb pairs. the 5\u2032 end of the genome between the putative poly(C) and VP3 coding regions was isolated by using a commercially available rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) kit. sequence reported in this work has been deposited in the GenBank database. all other GenBank accession numbers are indicated either in figures or figure legends. evolutionary history of BRAV RS3X was inferred by building P1 and 3Dpol coding region phylogeny in Picornaviridae using neighbor-joining method. the HKY 95 model was used as a nucleotide substitution bias model. trees were inferred by the neighbor-joining method. significance levels were set at P 0.05 or Bayes factor 0.50. the bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1,000 replicates is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed. there were a total of 1247 sites for the P1 region and 552 sites for 3Dpol in the final dataset. selection pressure was evaluated by determining the natural selection mechanisms acting on the codons of the ORFs of Aphthoviruses and BRVs. VP1 of FMDV A24 Cruzeiro and BRAV RS3X were modeled using the FMDV type O capsid (PDB: 1FOD Chain 1) as a template. all of the homology models were prepared on SWISSMODEL workspace. BRAV RS3X (GeneBank: KT948520), BRBV EC-11 (GeneBank: EU236594) and ERAV (GeneBank: AY 593768) were aligned to FMDV A24 Cruz (GeneBank: AY 593768) BRVs encode a longer VP4 protein than other Aphthoviruses. the rest of the VP2 protein and the entire VP3 and VP1 of BRVs and ERAV are distinctively different from that of FMDV. the characteristic RGD tripeptide serves as the cell surface-binding site in the VP1 G\u2013H loop of FMDV,46\u201348. structure-based sequence alignments are positioned to the left of each image. the N-termini of 2A show greater variation, suggesting a lesser functional significance for this region. the most obvious differences between BRVs (including BRAV RS3X reported here) and FMDV (Figs. 1A and B) are the sizes of the 2B and 3A proteins. non-structural protein 3A contains two hydrophobic residues (L38 and 41 in FMDV) the hydrophobicity of the amino acid residues corresponding to residues 38 and 41 of FMDV 3A is conserved among all the Aphthoviruses. the smaller 3A of BRAV RS3X followed by BRBV indicates a divergence in the membrane association of 3A of these viruses from FMDV. phylogeny We constructed neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees of the structural protein region P1 as well as non-structural protein 3Dpol. the former being most diverse and latter being most conserved. the amino acid sequences of the P1 and 3Dpol regions were first aligned with the Muscle algorithm implemented in MEGA 6. ae were constructed with the JTT model for amino acid substitution (pairwise deletions only) for (A) P1 structural proteins and (B) 3Dpol non-structural protein. the phylogeny tree of the 3Dpol region showed similar clustering of Aphthoviruses. BRAV RS3X and the isolates BSRI4, SD1, H1, and 140032-1 form a cluster distinct from FMDV. IFEL method detected one codon site, 680 in the structural protein region under positive selection. four of these sites are in the structural proteins, one (139) in Lpro, and one (1806) in 3Cpro. detecting 511, 1143, and 843 sites subject to negative selection. the MEME method detected 6 codon sites under positive selection among Aphthoviruses. three in the 3Dpol region at positions 2054, 2331, and 2394. multiple algorithms have been designed to dissect an alignment of several nucleotide sequences for local regions that exhibit the hallmarks of a recombination breakpoint. in its default mode, RDP calculates even the least possible event. however, a recombination event should only be considered significant if evidenced by multiple methods. the actual breakpoint position is undetermined (it was most likely overprinted by a subsequent recombination event). Minor Parent = Parent contributing the smaller fraction of sequence. Major Parent = Parent contributing the smaller fraction of sequence. the sequence listed as unknown was used to infer the existence of a missing parental sequence. NS = No significant. P-value was recorded for this recombination event using this method. BRVs carry multiple recombination hot spots distributed throughout the ORF.

RS3X shares 64.12%, 54.00%, and 41.03% nucleotide sequence identity to FMDV (A24 Cruzeiro), BRBV, and ERAV. the sequences were aligned to FMDV A24 Cruz (GeneBank: AY 593768). yellow highlights indicate functionally critical residues of a protein other than active site residues. green highlights denote the RGD cell surface receptor. structural models of the two proteins were prepared and compared. the characteristic RGD tripeptide serves as the cell surface-binding site in the VP1 G\u2013H loop of FMDV. the N-termini of 2A show greater variation, suggesting a lesser functional significance for this region. the most obvious differences between BRVs (including BRAV RS3X reported here) and FMDV are the sizes of the 2B and 3A proteins as well as the number of 3B (VPg) peptides encoded. 3A of BRAV RS3X and ERAV followed by BRBV indicates a divergence in the membrane association of 3A of these viruses from FMDV. the 2C-ATPase is conserved in BRV RS3X as well as other Aphthoviruses when compared herein. BRAV RS3X (GeneBank: KT948520), BRBV EC-11 (GeneBank: EU236594) and ERAV (GeneBank: AY 593768) were aligned to FMDV A24 Cruz (GeneBank: AY 593768). BRAV RS3X (GeneBank: KT948520), BRBV EC-11 (GeneBank: EU236594) and ERAV (Gene X indicates BRAV RS3X sequence for BRAV RS 3X, BRAV Sd-1, BRAV 140032-1, BRAV H-1, BRAV BSRI4, BRBV EC-11, BRBV 140032-2, BRAV BSRI3 and BRAV BSRI1 respectively. BRVs encode a longer VP4 protein than other Aphthoviruses. modeled structures of VP1 structural proteins of (i) FMDV A24 Cruz and BRAV RS3X 2B are colored cyan, the G\u2013H loop is marked with a yellow oval, and the RGD tripeptide is marked with cyan text. the prediction of the 2B viroporin of: FMDV A24 Cruz (purple) and BRAV RS3X (cyan) were superimposed on HCV p7. BRAV RS3X 2B lacks a trans-membrane region that is observed in FMDV A24 Cruzeiro. the viroporin domain appeared to be conserved in BRAV RS3X. FMDV 2B lacks the pore lining -helix altogether, suggesting a different mechanism for FMDV 2B interaction with intracellular membranes. BRAV RS3X and all other Aphthoviruses encode only one copy of the nonstructural protein 3B that closely resembles the third non-identical copy of FMDV 3B (3B3) as expected, both the 3Cpro and 3Dpol are most conserved and catalytically important residues of the two proteins are absolutely conserved in all the viruses compared herein. other Aphthoviruses including FMDV strain A24 Cruzeiro, BRBV, and ERAV each form separate nodes characteristic of their genera. however, as would be expected, all of the Aphthoviruses group together, thus proving their close evolutionary relationship within the genus Aphthovirus. the SLAC method detected codon sites 489 and 832 in the structural protein P1 region and codon site 1958 in the 3Dpol region under positive selection pressure. IFEL unexpectedly found only 3 sites under negative selection. the selection pressure detected by IFEL would yield such unexpected results. 0.008\u20130.05 MEME N.A.

Unknown = Only one parent and a recombinant need be in the alignment for a recombination event to be detectable. the sequence listed as unknown was used to infer the existence of a missing parental sequence. the remaining three Aphthoviruses (BRAV, BRBV, and ERAV) lack this essential cellular receptor-binding site. the 2B viroporin of BRAV RS3X is significantly smaller than FMDV. lack of a C-terminal trans-membrane helix indicates a diversion in its topology. potential recombination breakpoints in the genomes were detected with sites identified flanking the P1 region containing the structural protein-coding sequences. the similarity in results obtained using both algorithmic sets strengthens the conclusion that recombination events are unlikely between the FMDV and BRV genomes within the regions encoding the structural proteins. the observed higher number of positive selection breakpoints among BRVs is not a surprise. negligible evidence of single-point positive selection sites proves a parallel but distinct lineage of the different Aphthoviruses included in this study."}
