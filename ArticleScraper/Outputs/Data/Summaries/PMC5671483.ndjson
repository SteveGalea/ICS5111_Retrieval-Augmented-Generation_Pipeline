{"summary": "viruses can be broadly classified into three major groups. archaeoviruses, bacterioviruses, and eukaryoviruses. eukaryoviruses capture genes involved in antiviral immunity from eukaryotic cells. strained evolution of viral lines has led to favoring either the \u201cescape\u201d or \u201creduction\u201d models for the origin of modern viruses. these properties relate to the lytic mode of viral reproduction that has historically remained on focus due to the noxious effects that lysis has on human health, livestock, and agriculture. -proteobacterium Wolbachia infects a large group of insects. the bacteriophage WO must neutralize antiviral defense and enter/exit the membranes of both bacterial and eukaryal organisms. the study therefore offered unique insights into virus-cell interactions that extend beyond their known hosts. f-value representing fraction of cellular proteomes encoding individual FSFs was used to postulate hypotheses regarding the direction of gene transfer, virus-to-cell or cell-to-virus. an FSF with a viral hallmark function (e.g., virion synthesis) that had negligible presence in proteomes of a cellular superkingdom (e.g., f 1%) was considered a candidate for horizontal gene transfer event from virus-to-cell rather than seven out of 10 viral genomes encode different virus-hallmark FSFs. event is determined to be virus-to-cell HGT. 98, 441, and 489 FSFs were detected in proteomes of 62 archaeoviruses, 1,223 bacterioviruses, and 2,155 eukaryoviruses. bacterioviruses shared a single FSF exclusively with archaea (Venn group A; Hypothetical protein D-63) but none exclusively with Archaea (group B) and Eukarya (group E), respectively. eukaryoviruses shared 37 FSFs exclusively with Eukarya (group E), but also 1 and 5 FSFs with archaea and Bacteria in groups A and B. f-value (A) f-value (B) f-value (AV) f-value (EV) FSFS ONLY IN ARCHAEOVIRUSES AND ARCHAEAL PROTEOMES (n = 1) 109801 a.30.5 Hypothetical protein D-63 0.0082 0.0000 0.0000 0.0968 0.0000 0.0000 FSFS ONLY IN BACTERIOVIRUSES AND ARCHAEAL PROTEOMES (n = 29) 0.0000 0.0000 56826 e.27.1 Upper collar protein gp10 (connector protein) 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0147 0.0000 46575 a.237.1 DNA polymerase III theta subunit-like 0.0000 0.0493 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0025 0.0000 140919 a.263.1 DNA terminal protein 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0025 0.0000 159871 d inovirus (filamentous phage) major coat protein 0.0000 0.0099 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0074 0.0000 101059 a.159.3 B-form DNA mimic Ocr 0.0000 0.0009 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0123 0.0000 158668 a.285.1 MtlR-like 0.0000 0.0753 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 103370 d.262.1 NinB serine protease inhibitors 0.0000 0.0000 0.3316 0.0000 0.0000 0.0023 54117 d.9.1 Interleukin 8-like chemokines 0.0000 0.0000 0.1540 0.0000 0.0000 0.0084 47836 a.61.1 Retroviral matrix proteins 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0366 0.0000 0.0000 0.0186 50353 b.42.1 Cytokine 0.0000 0.000 retrovirus capsid protein, N-terminal core domain 0.0000 0.0000 0.0522 0.0000 0.0000 0.0190 47353 a.28.3 Retrovirus capsid dimerization domain-like 0.0000 0.0000 0.1723 0.0000 0.0000 0.0125 88645 b.121.5 ssDNA viruses 0.0000 0.0000 0.0418 0.0000 0.0139 0.0320 101399 a.206.1 P40 nucleo 0.0000 0.0000 0.9034 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0014 140586 a.242.1 Dcp2 domain-like 0.0000 0.0000 0.9034 0.0000 0.0000 0.0005 57501 g.17.1 Cystine-knot cytokines 0.0000 0.0000 0.9765 0.0000 0.0000 0.0009 49830 b.20.1 ENV polyprotein, receptor-binding domain 0.0000 0.000 b.121.5 and b.121.5 were also detected in bacterioviruses. the 37 FSFs shared exclusively between bacterioviral and bacterial proteomes included viral hallmark proteins, head-binding, head-to-tail joining, head decoration, and tail proteins. coiled-coiled domain of bacterial neurotoxin involved in host virulence also detected. arya with low f-values in eukaryal proteomes could therefore represent episodes of virus-to-cell gene transfer. other E FSFs such as CCCH zinc finger domains (involved in regulation and DNA binding), CAD and PB1 domains (cell cycle and apoptosis), CRAL/TRIO domains (likely functional components of the visual cycle), and others were near ubiquitous in eukaryotic proteomes. 4/6 E FSFs in bacterioviruses could be considered viral hallmark proteins. bacterioviruses share capsid/coat related protein folds characteristic of eukaryoviruses. rare occurrences of capsid/coat related genes in cellular proteomes more likely. eukaryoviruses shared a single FSF exclusively with Archaea (group A; Chromosomal protein MC1) and 5 FSFs exclusively with Bacteria (group B) the MC1 protein is associated with thermophilic archaeal species (f-value = 0.26 in Archaea) it is involved in protecting DNA denaturation at high temperature. one bacterioviral FSF (d.282.1, SSo0622-like) was detected in the AE group. 2 eukaryoviral FSFs were detected in the AB group. these FSFs are likely candidates of genetic transfer occurring between viruses and non-host superkingdoms. bacterioviral proteomes were significantly more widespread in eukaryotic proteomes (P 0.0001) with f-values approaching 1.0 in some cases. we hypothesize that bacterioviruses and eukaryoviruses acquired BE FSFs directly from their host cells. only 18 out of 46 BE FSFs in bacterioviruses had an f-value > 25% in bacterial proteomes than the corresponding f-value in eukaryotic proteomes. the same was also true for 20 BE FSFs common to bacterioviruses and eukaryoviruses where the f-value differential was under 25%. the majority of eukaryoviruses belonged to metazoa (n = 1,057) and plant hosts (963). the majority of eukaryoviruses belonged to metazoa (n = 1,057) and plant hosts (963). only 27 viruses were associated to protozoa. eukaryoviruses were divided into viruses of plants (included all plants), metazoa (vertebrates and invertebrates), protozoa (animal-like protists), fungi, and a group that includes invertebrates and plants (IP) for each subgroup, bars indicate the percentage of FSFs present in one of the seven Venn groups listed on the right (see also Figure 2). the presence of universal \u201ccell-like\u201d proteins in viral proteomes is therefore intriguing and worthy of exploration. it suggests two possible scenarios: first, the detection of ABE FSFs effectively transforms ABE into an ABEV group. the mere existence of this FSF core supports an early \u201ccell-like\u201d phase in the evolution of modern viruses. the f-value (number of proteomes in a superkingdom encoding an FSF / total number of proteomes in that superkingdom) distribution is plotted for the ABE Venn group of FSF domains for archaeoviruses, bacterioviruses, and eukaryoviruses. to evaluate these alternatives, we pooled the ABE FSFs of archaeoviruses (n = 93), bacterio the majority of the ABE FSFs were part of the be group (n = 130) this suggests relatively high activity of cross-superkingdom genetic exchange between bacterioviruses and eukaryoviruses. these could represent direct HGT events from bacterial proteomes to bacterioviruses and eukaryal proteomes to eukaryoviruses. an origin of Eukarya from within archaea has recently been postulated. eukarya from within archaea has been postulated following the reconstruction of the genomes of the candidate archaeal phylum \u201cLokiarchaeota\u201d and \u201cAsgard\u201d archaea. eukaryoviruses harbor several eukaryote-specific proteins.

ABEV group points to recent HGTs occurring between viruses and cells. a single HGT event is sufficient to invoke transformation from the ABE to the ABEV group. a single HGT event is sufficient to invoke transformation from the ABE to the ABEV group. b (ABE FSFs detected only in bacterioviruses), e (ABE FSFs detected only in prokaryotic viruses), ab (ABE FSFs detected only in archaeoviruses and eukaryoviruses), be (ABE FSFs detected only in bacterioviruses and eukaryoviruses), and abe (ABE FSFs detected only in bacterioviruses and eukaryovirus the origin of abe FSFs is better and more parsimoniously reconciled with an origin of modern viral lineages in ancient cells that existed prior to the diversification of cellular life. one interesting observation was the existence of only 2 FSFs belonging to the ae group, which harbor several eukaryote-specific proteins. bacterioviruses and eukaryoviruses represent crucial viral functions involved in viral pathogenicity and virion synthesis. their origin however cannot be attributed to cell-to-virus HGT, as these FSFs are completely absent in cellular proteomes. they could originate either directly in viral lineages during replication inside host cells. oviruses Nidovirales 56502 d.172.1 gp120 core eukaryoviruses Retroviridae 55671 d.102.1 Regulatory factor Nef eukaryoviruses Retroviridae 56983 f.10.1 Viral

Nidovirales 51332 b.91.1 E2 regulatory, transactivation domain eukaryoviruses Papillomaviridae FSFs are identified both by SCOP numeric IDs and alpha-numeric concise classification strings (ccs) proteomes of virus hosts harbored several viral hallmark proteins necessary for virion assembly and successful viral infection cycles. the membranes of Archaea differ in lipid composition with the membranes of Bacteria and Eukarya (ether-linked vs. ester-linked, Jain et al., 2014) these differences could therefore pose a barrier for archaeoviruses to cross/traverse bacterial and eukaryal membranes and participate in horizontal genetic exchange. a large cohort of universal protein domains shared between archaeoviruses, bacterioviruses, eukaryoviruses, Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya was also detected that provides support to an ancient co-existence of viral and cellular ancestors before the rise of a diversified cellular world. s grouped into FSFs are believed to have evolved from a common evolutionary ancestor. the interlocking of amino acid side-chains in the buried cores represents a distinctive \u201cfingerprint\u201d which is recognizable among member domains of any particular superfamily. despite low sequence identities, member protein domains of SCOP FSFs share recognizable structural and biochemical similarities. f 1%) were treated as candidate virus-to-cell gene transfers. this approach of inferring a qualitative likelihood of HGT is thus similar to the method of detecting anomalous phylogenetic distribution of genes where rare presence of a gene in closely related members is more likely a result of HGT rather than vertical evolution. coverage of viral proteomes is defined by the number of viral genes (proteins) with significant homologs in either sequence or structure databases. it is already well-known that the majority of viral genes lack sequence homologies, putatively termed ORFans (Figure 2B in Nasir and Caetano-Anoll\u00e9s, 2015). replication strategies infect cellular organisms, harbor genomes and particle sizes that are minimalistic. tendency of viruses to reduce genome size has effectively led to loss of information when extant virus genomes are comparatively analyzed with cellular genomes. no single FSF could be detected in all seven viral replicon types. there is no single universal gene (i.e., ribosomal RNA gene in cellular organisms) that can taxonomically classify short sequencing reads of viral metagenomes. this is why we restricted our analysis to only well-curated reference genomes with virus host information available from experimental studies. reference virus genomes are well-curated first genomes submitted for any virus species. we only kept reference viral genomes corresponding to any of the seven known viral replicon types. viruses listed as either 'unclassified' or 'unassigned' were discarded from the analysis. HMM assignments for viral proteomes can be downloaded from https://figshare.com/articles/Nasir_and_Caetano-Anolles_2015_zip/4833641. spread of each viral FSF in proteomes was calculated by an f-value, which represents the number of proteomes in a superkingdom encoding an FSF divided by the total number of proteomes in that superkingdom (or group) 190,610 protein sequences corresponding to 3,966 completely-sequenced reference genomes of viruses that were available on the NCBI Viral Genomes Resource in June 2014 were downloaded. a total of 3,460 viruses were discarded from the analysis. 62 archaeoviruses, 1,223 bacterioviruses, and 2,155 eukaryoviruses were identified. pre-calculated FSF assignments for 11 million proteins encoded by the completely-sequenced genomes of a total of 1,620 cellular organisms. if an FSF involved in cellular hallmark function (e.g., metabolism) was detected in only few cellular proteomes then this was FSF was determined to have transferred horizontally from virus-to-cell. the exception would be the presence of \u201ccell-like\u201d FSFs in the proteomes of all three virus groups. FSFs are identified both by SCOP numeric IDs and alpha-numeric concise classification strings (ccs) the f-values are also listed for Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. data sorted in an increasing manner for FSFs common to both bacterioviruses and eukaryoviruses. the f-values are also listed for archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. click here for additional data file."}
