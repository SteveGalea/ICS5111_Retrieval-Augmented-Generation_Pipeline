{"summary": "viral load and lung lesion severity decreased over time, being highest value at initial presentation. patients had higher initial viral load or higher initial lung lesion severity decreased at a slower rate than viral load. Pneumonia is detected in 40% of influenza A H1N1 cases (10) the reported radiologic findings included patchy consolidation and ground-glass opacities consistent with viral pneumonia (11,12) the patients fulfilled the clinical criteria for confirmed pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza A infection. the criteria included influenza-like symptoms and a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay with positive results for H1N1 virus. nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar aspirate and viral load was examined. quantitative real-time RT-PCR tests were performed for detection of the virus according to published guidelines by world health organization. viral load value of less than 1.7 log10 copies/mL was regarded as negative value. CT scans were performed on a dual slice scanner (Philips MX 4000, Philips, the Netherlands) three zones corresponded to approximately one-third of the images from the lung apex to 1 cm below the domes of the diaphragm (15,16) each lung zone was assigned a score that was based on the following: (I) score 0, 0 involvement; (II) score 1, less than 25% involvement; (III) score 2, 25% to less than 50% involvement; (IV) score 3, 50% to less than 75% involvement; and (V) score 4, 75% or greater involvement. the mean viral load from the first time measurement was 4.56 log10copies/mL (SD =1.62 log10 copies/mL, range, 1.70-8.35 log10 copies/mL) with the five patients whose virus load was measured within 72 hours after the onset of symptom, the viral load was 6.5 log10 copies/mL. the mean lung lesion scores from the first time CT of the 24 patients was 6.6 (SD =6.63, range, 1-24) patients had higher initial viral load tend to have longer virus shedding period. patients had higher initial viral load tend to have longer virus shedding period. patients had higher lung lesion score tend to have longer disease course. one case had chronic hepatitis and one case had liver cirrhosis. one case had history of gastric ulcer; one case had history of kidney calculus. one case had history of partial thyroidectomy due to hyperthyroidism. nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from bronchoalveolar aspirate and viral load was examined by real-time RT-PCR method. primers were designed to establish PCR assay to amplify a part of the M gene of 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus according to the published sequences online by WHO. est CT was performed on a dual slice scanner (Philips MX 4000, Philips, the Netherlands) the protocol used was as follows: end-inspiratory acquisition, 120 kV, 150-200 mAs, slice thickness 10mm, interslice gap 0.2 mm. all chest CT and chest X-ray were assessed blinded to clinical information. the lung lesions were of typical virus infection, including ground-glass opacity (hazy areas of increased attenuation without obscuration of the underlying vessels), consolidation (homogeneous opacification of the parenchyma with obscuration of the underlying vessels), reticular opacities, linear opacities, interlobular septal thickening, and mixed pattern (Figures 1,2). the mean lung lesion scores from the first time CT of the 24 patients was 6.6 (SD =6.63, range, 1-24) the correlation between the lung lesion and the virus load viral load was r=\u20130.14 (n=24 patients, Figure 3). the correlation between the lung lesion score and the virus load viral load was not statistically significant (P=0.4) most hospitalized patients are under the age of 18 and very few are over 65 years (10) the demographics of our series were different from the series reported by Aviram et al., their series had a mean age of 17.5 years. to et al. reported fatal outcome of human influenza A H5N1 is associated with high viral load and hypercytokinemia. viral load in nasopharyngeal aspirates from day 10 to day 15 after onset of symptoms was associated with oxygen desaturation. 24 (54.5%) of 44 patients diagnosed with H1N1 influenza in our hospital had associated lung abnormalities. results from this study were consistent among patient subjects. authors tend to believe even there would be a modest increase in patient number, the conclusions would be the same. this is the first time such a study has been carried out. the current study provides valuable information on viral pneumonia epidemiology."}
