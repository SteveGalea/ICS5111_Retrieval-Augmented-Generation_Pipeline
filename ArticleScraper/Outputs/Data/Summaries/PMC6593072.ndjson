{"summary": "as of May 22, 2019, there have been 2,428 confirmed cases in 27 countries. the dromedary camel is the primary reservoir of MERS-CoV. the seropositive rate in dromedary camels is quite high in the Middle East and in Northern and Eastern African countries. despite widespread seropositivity for MERS-CoV reported in dromedaries, human MERS cases have been observed only in the Middle East. this seropositivity rate among patients in Kenya (0.18%) was similar to that observed in Saudi Arabia (0.15%); a definitive cause remains unclear. a total of 184 dromedaries were sampled, including 153 females and 23 males, with a median age of 6 years. a total of 184 dromedaries were sampled, including 153 females and 23 males, with a median age of 6 years. swabs were immediately spotted onto an FTA Classic Card with a color indicator (GE Healthcare) at each local point and stored in Multi-Barrier Pouches (GE Healthcare) until used for RNA extraction. punched cards were then resuspended in AVE buffer from the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. total RNA was isolated according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. two QProbe RT-LAMP assays were performed as the first screening test. they can detect Ethiopian MERS-CoV RNA within 30 min. specimens positive for either N or ORF1a were also considered positive for MERS-CoV. upE and ORF1a were performed using the QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) and LightCycler 96 instrument (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) Sequencing Analysis The nearly complete genome of Ethiopian MERS-CoV was analyzed by RNA sequencing. extracted viral RNA was reverse transcribed and tagged with index adaptors using the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina. recombinant MERS-CoVs were generated by a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone carrying the full-length infectious genome of the EMC isolate (designated as pBAC-MERS-wt) the chimeric S proteins replaced between the EMC and Amibara S sequences at the first furin site. cells were cultured in a 96-well plate and infected with 100 PFU of each virus. after 90 min of adsorption, the cells were washed twice with PBS. after 90 min of adsorption, the cells were washed twice with PBS. after incubation, cells were stained with crystal violet. the cells were then lysed in 50 l processing buffer. 30 l lysate was mixed with 120 l distilled water. 5 l aliquots of diluted RNA were used for real-time RT-PCR. Specimens showing neutralization at more than 20-fold dilution relative to the negative control were considered positive for MERS-CoV infection. p 0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance. a total of 184 dromedaries were sampled, including 153 females and 23 males. a total of 184 dromedaries were sampled, including 153 females and 23 males. swabs were immediately spotted onto an FTA Classic Card with a color indicator. two QProbe RT-LAMP assays were performed as the first screening test because they can detect Ethiopian MERS-CoV RNA within 30 min. a positive result in at least two of these four tests fulfilled the WHO criteria, and these specimens were considered positive for MERS-CoV. Specimens that were positive on at least one of the Corman\u2019s assays were also considered positive for MERS-CoV. all required regents were prepared in 12-well tube strips (Ina Optika, Osaka, Japan) and then lyophilized. the specimens were immediately evaluated using the ESEQuant TS2 tube scanner (Qiagen) d and sequenced (150-bp paired-end reads) using the MiSeq (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and HiSeq X Ten systems (Illumina Inc.; operated by GENEWIZ, South Plainfield, NJ, USA) Sequence reads were trimmed and mapped to the EMC isolate reference genome using CLC Genomic Workbench 9.0.1 software. the chimeric S proteins were replaced between the EMC and Amibara S sequences at the first furin site (amino acid positions 748\u2013751 in the S protein), which marks the boundary of the S1 and S2 regions. the cells were grown in a single well of a six-well plate in 10% FCS-MEM and transfected with 3 g of BAC plasmid with Lipofectamine 3,000. 104 PFU of virus was applied to vero or vero/TMPRSS2 cells in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37\u00b0C. cellular RNA was collected once per hour using a CellAMP Direct RNA Prep Kit (Takara Bio) for 6 h. neutralization assay was performed using vero/TMPRSS2 cells as described. serially diluted sera were mixed with 50\u2013100 PFU of targeted viruses in 10% TPB-DMEM and incubated at room temperature for 45 min. non-serum samples were used as a negative control. a total of 184 sera were tested, of which 179 (97.2%) were confirmed to be positive for MERS-CoV with an average titer of 430.0. the titers in dromedaries 5 years of age tended to be higher than those in younger animals. only dromedaries 4 years of age tested positive for viral isolates or viral RNA, with the highest levels observed in animals 1 year old. in total, 258 specimens were collected, with most specimens (244) coming from animals 1 year old. RNA extraction was performed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and then sequencing analysis was performed in Japan. RNA sequencing was performed to determine the genomic sequences in these specimens. of these 12 positive specimens, nearly full-length genome sequences were detected in two specimens using MiSeq. important protein involved in viral infection and neutralization showed similar clustering between isolates. phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood method with a bootstrap test. recombinants were recovered from BAC vector systems based on the sequence of the EMC isolate (JX869059), replacing the S protein sequence with those of Amibara S proteins. the cells were then adsorbed, washed twice with PBS, and incubated in 10% TPB-DMEM. viral entry was determined for EMC S and Amibara S (118S) recombinants. the level of viral entry was identical between EMC S and 118S recombinants up to 4 h post-inoculation. quantification of viral entry revealed lower levels in the 118S recombinant after 2 h post-inoculation. titers ranged from 320 to 10,240, with differences in reactivity calculated. neutralizing titers of amibara S recombinants were two- to fourfold higher dilutions in all sera. sera from six different animals were used. this raises the possibility of antigenical stability in same geographical area in east africa. therefore, we suspected that there may be differences in antigenicity between the EMC and Amibara S proteins. we performed a second neutralizing assay in mice using sera derived from mice inoculated with the EMC isolate. transgenic mice (C57BL/6 background) expressing human DPP4 were inoculated with the EMC isolate intranasally. after 5 or 7 days post inoculation, sera were collected under anesthesia. five samples showing a high neutralization titer against the EMC isolate were used. the neutralization assay was performed as described in Figure 5. n = 6; *p 0.05; **p 0.01. Middle East Respiratory syndrome Coronavirus Prevalence in Afar, Ethiopia MERS-CoV is highly prevalent in North and East Africa. 184 sera were tested, of which 179 (97.2%) were confirmed to be positive for MERS-CoV. dromedaries 4 years of age tested positive for viral isolates or viral RNA. in total, 258 specimens were collected, with most specimens (244) coming from animals 1 year old. the results were similar to those of the Ethiopian MERS study. RT-PCR (upE, ORF1a) 4 Positive Negative Total Total Total 39 219 258 Sequence Analysis of Ethiopian Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. the import of live camel materials from Ethiopia is prohibited. RNA extraction from the specimens was performed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and then sequencing analysis was performed in Japan. phylogenetic analysis was performed using the spike (S) protein. the spike (S) protein, an important protein involved in viral infection and neutralization, also showed similar clustering between isolates. phylogenetic analysis was performed using MEGA7 software. the replication rates of the Amibara S recombinants were 2 logs lower than that of EMC in vero cells until 3 days post-infection. TMPRSS2 was shown to enhance viral entry and replication of MERS-CoV recombinants expressing the Amibara isolate S protein. the level of viral entry was identical between EMC S and 118S recombinants up to 4 h post-inoculation in vero cells. quantification of viral entry revealed lower levels in the 118S recombinant after 2 h post-inoculation. neutralization assays examining reactivity to the Amibara S recombinants were performed using sera obtained from the Ethiopian dromedaries described in Figure 1. sera from six different animals were used (titers ranged from 320 to 10,240), with differences in reactivity calculated relative to the EMC isolate. yearly changes of Ethiopian MERS-CoV are unknown due to the shortage of genomic sequence database. in neighboring country Kenya, the amino acid sequences of S1 region are identical among isolates in 2017 to 2018. this raises the possibility of antigenical stability in same geographical area in East Africa. therefore, we believe that there was little divergence between sera collected in 2013 and those collected in 2017 in Ethiopia. recombinant virus strains expressing the chimeric S protein were generated by interchanging the S1 and S2 regions in EMC and Amibara S (118) proteins. neutralization titers for EMC and EMC/118S were significantly lower than those for 118 EMC and 118 S. recombinant viruses expressing portions of the Amibara and EMC S protein fused at the S1/S2 junction were used. the neutralization assay was performed as described in Figure 5. n = 6; *p 0.05; **p 0.01. Discussion This study was performed to identify viral-specific differences in MERS-CoV isolates. virological differences between Ethiopian and EMC isolates were based on the S protein. the coronaviral S protein is strongly associated with viral pathogenicity. the number of amino acid differences between the EMC and Amibara S proteins is 10 for 118S and 11 for 126S. the amino acid differences in the RBD of EMC and Amibara S proteins are S390F, A597V, and P515L (only in 126S) substitutions in these regions may affect antibody binding affinity. in contrast to the S1 region, the S2 region affects viral entry. differences in macrophage infectivity between feline enteric coronavirus and feline infectious peritoneal virus disappeared after introducing five amino acid substitutions. a single mutation or a combination of mutations found in the S protein suggest clear differences associated with viral infectivity and other virulence traits. the data presented here represent the first demonstration of virological differences between Ethiopian MERS-CoV and EMC isolates. further studies will be necessary to fully elucidate the pathogenicity of African MERS-CoV isolates. the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
