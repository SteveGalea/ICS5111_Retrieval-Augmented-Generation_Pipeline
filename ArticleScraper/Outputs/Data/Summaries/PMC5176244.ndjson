{"summary": "adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, metapneumovirus, influenza, parainfluenzavirus, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were identified. a specific EV-D68 real-time PCR was also used (3), when enterovirus PCR was found positive. for 20 patients, we obtained sequence results identifying EV-D68. the remaining 5 could not be typed by sequencing but were positive in our specific EV-D68 PCR. twenty-one patients had an underlying or concurrent condition in the children mostly pulmonary. a of prematurity Respiratory failure Yes 12 Jul 16 1 y/F Bronchial hyperreactivity, failure to thrive Bronchial obstruction, respiratory failure Yes/8 13 Jul 22 5 y/F Asthma Status asthmaticus Yes/5 14 Jul 22 1 y/M Tracheal stoma for bilateral vocal cord paralysis Cough, wheezing No 15 Jul 23 3 y/M None Status asthmaticus Yes/5 16 Jul 24 3 y/M A one child (patient 16) had the clinical characteristics of AFM. he had a history of headaches for 1 week and an influenza-like illness for 3 days. he had rapidly progressing asymmetric weakness of arms and legs, bulbar paralysis, asymmetric facial paralysis, and respiratory distress for which he needed ventilatory support. we submitted the 20 sequences we obtained during 2016 to GenBank. included are the strains obtained in the laboratory of the University Medical Center Groningen. EV-D68 with a sharp increase of cases that could not be explained by a change in surveillance strategy. the number of children who needed ICU admission was higher in 2016 than in 2010 and 2014 reports (3,4) evidence that EV-D68 might cause AFM is increasing after recent epidemiologic investigations."}
