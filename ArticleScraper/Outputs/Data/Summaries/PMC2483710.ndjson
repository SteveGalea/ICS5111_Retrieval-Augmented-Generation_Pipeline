{"summary": "Background Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection has long been a public health problem in Taiwan. the annual incidence of tuberculosis in aboriginal mountainous areas was 71.1/100,000 and 74.6/100,000 in 1997. TB cases through control programs and treatment with effective drug regimens can reduce the spread of infections. delays can be categorized as patient delays or health care system delays. a medical facility failing to report a suspected case cannot receive reimbursement by the national health care system. in Taiwan, physicians are required to immediately treat patients with confirmed TB. data for patients who experienced treatment delays longer than 180 days were considered incorrectly managed. a P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. study enrolled only TB patients with sputum smear- and/or culture-positive TB. treatment delays measured as the time from the date of definite diagnosis to the date of initial treatment for the disease. treatment initiated more than seven days after diagnosis was considered delayed treatment, coded as \"1\", otherwise, coded as \"0\" more males (22,294 males vs. 9,643 females) than females had pulmonary TB infections. average days of delayed treatment (3.4 days) revealed no gender difference. 21.8 62.4 22.0 60.8 20.8 61.7 21.3 Patients with known treatment facilities 3430 (77.4%) 5505 (77.0%) 7742 (78.2%) 8305 (79.4%) 24982 (78.2%) Hospital 3256 (94.5%) 5235 (95.1%) 7406 (95.7%) 7984 (96.1%) 23881 (95.6%) Primary-care clinic 174 (5.1%) 270 (4.9%) 336 (4.3%) 321 (3.9%) 1101 (4.4%) De 20 279 6.3 201 2.8 270 2.7 250 2.4 2130 114 2.6 77 1.1 99 1.0 106 1.0 3140 46 1.0 52 0.7 49 0.5 47 0.4 4150 31 0.7 20 0.3 30 0.3 31 0.3 5160 21 0.5 21 0.3 18 0.2 19 0.2 6170 21 0.5 10 0.1 24 0.2 14 0.1 7180 18 0.4 9 0.1 13 0.1 9 0.1 8190 11 0.2 7 0.1 5 15 (6.8%) 2813 (8.8%) Sex (M/F ratio) 2.52 2.58 2.41 2.58 2.52 Age* 68.1 18.4 67.5 18.1 66.3 18.6 64.1 19.1 66.2 18.4 Male 69.3 17.2 68.3 17.3 67.7 16.9 65.2 18.9 67.6 17.3 Female 63.7 20.1 65.3 21.2 62.5 21.3 61.6 20.0 63.2 20.5 Delay (days)** 29.2 31.5 the absolute values of in power-functions ranged from 2.12 to 2.35. the absolute values of in power-functions ranged from 2.12 to 2.35. this finding suggests that a small number of patients experienced treatment delays for a significant number of days. age group 1 represents young people less than 20 y/o, group 2 adults between 21\u201364 y/o, and group 3 the aged over 65 y/o. more males (22,294 males vs. 9,643 females) than females had pulmonary TB infections. average days of delayed treatment revealed no gender difference. 9 18.1 66.5 18 Female 62.5 21.6 61.8 21.8 62.4 22.0 60.8 20.8 61.7 21.3 Patients with known treatment facilities 3430 (77.4%) 5505 (77.0%) 7742 (78.2%) 8305 (79.4%) 24982 (78.2%) Hospital 3256 (94.5%) 5235 (95.1%) 7406 (95.7%) 7984 (96.1%) 23881 (95.6%) Primary-care clinic 174 (5.1%) 270 (4.9%) 336 ( the total number of patients experiencing treatment delays was 743 (16.8%) in 2002, 598 (8.4%) in 2003, 757 (7.6%) in 2004 and 715 (6.8%) in 2005. in patients with long treatment delays, males were older than females. males tended to have longer delays than females. 743 (16.8%) 598 (8.4%) 757 (7.6%) 715 (6.8%) 2813 (8.8%) Sex (M/F ratio) 2.52 2.58 2.41 2.58 2.52 Age* 68.1 18.4 67.5 18.1 66.3 18.6 64.1 19.1 66.2 18.4 Male 69.3 17.2 68.3 17.3 67.7 16.9 65.2 18.9 67.6 17.3 Female 63.7 20.1 65.3 21.2 62.5 21.3 6 the absolute values of in power-functions ranged from 2.12 to 2.35. the absolute values of in power-functions ranged from 2.12 to 2.35. this finding suggests that a small number of patients experienced treatment delays for a significant number of days. age group 1 represents young people less than 20 y/o, group 2 adults between 21\u201364 y/o, and group 3 the aged over 65 y/o. delays in diagnosis and treatment can be categorized as delayed diagnosis or delayed treatment. a no-report policy in 1997 penalizes medical facilities for not reporting possible TB cases by denying reimbursement. a study in Yemen demonstrated that women were more likely than men to complete tuberculosis treatment [24], suggesting that women have shorter treatment delays than males and tend to receive treatment immediately after diagnosis. however, a Bangladesh study showed that women experience longer total delay, total diagnostic delay, patient delay and treatment delay (males1.9 days, females 2.0 days) epidemics in a power-law distribution can reproduce with a considerably lower number of infected persons at each point in time. it brings serious concerns for public health researchers working in the field of tuberculosis control. based on the report from Chest hospital in Taiwan, multidrug resistance occurred in 42.2% of retreated TB patients. 1.8% of multidrug resistant isolates were found in new TB patients from January 2002 to June 2004."}
