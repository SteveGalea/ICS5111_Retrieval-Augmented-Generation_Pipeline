{"summary": "zoonotic diseases are a major concern among scientists studying infectious diseases at different spatial and temporal scales. changes in biotic and abiotic conditions may alter population disease dynamics and lead to the emergence of zoonotic infections. in the last century outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens have emerged or re-emerged involving arenaviruses and dengue viruses. a review of ancient Chinese writings, dating back to approximately 960 AD, revealed descriptions closely resembling hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. HFRS as a distinct syndrome was first brought to the attention of western medicine in association with an outbreak that occurred among United Nations troops during the Korean conflict between 1951 and 1954. it took more than two decades until the etiologic agent, Hantaan virus (HTNV), was isolated from the striped field mouse Apodemus a hantavirus strain Acronym Geographic Distribution Host Pathology Case-fatality ratio (%) New World Sin Nombre SNV North America Peromyscus maniculatus HCPS 35 Choclo CHOV Panam\u00e1 Oligoryzomys fulvescens HCPS 21 Andes ANDV Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Paraguay, Calomys laucha, C. callosus HCPS 5\u201315 Old World Han the genetic diversity of hantaviruses is far higher than expected. the hantavirus genome is composed of three negative sense single stranded RNA segments. the large (L) segment encodes a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of 2,160 amino acids. hantavirus envelope glycoproteins are known or presumed ligands for at least two distinct cellular receptors, the 3 integrin chain and decay accelerating factor. gC1qR/p32 also identified as another potential entry receptor. a number of activities and properties have been identified for the glycoproteins. apathogenic hantaviruses may have a potent interferon-pathway antagonism mechanism. some studies have suggested that apathogenic hantaviruses are indeed apathogenic. others have interpreted differences in the handling of Gn glycoproteins as independent of pathogenicity. hantaviruses have been identified as adversely affecting endothelial migration over substrata and in potentiating endothelial permeability. hantaviruses have been identified as adversely affecting endothelial migration over substrata and in potentiating endothelial permeability. hantavirus nucleocapsid protein has an inhibitory role in inflammatory responses mediated by NF kappa B (NF-B) the effects on NF-B expression appeared to be confined to prevention of its nuclear translocation after its attempted activation. eIF 4E binds to the 43S pre-initiation complex as does eIF 4G. the helicase activity of eIF 4A is presumed to be needed to dissociate higher-order RNA structure. the ability to bind at high affinity to capped native cellular oligoribonucleotides is likely to facilitate the access of capped oligonucleotides for use in transcriptional initiation. hantavirus envelope glycoproteins are known or presumed ligands for at least two distinct cellular receptors, the 3 integrin chain and decay accelerating factor, or DAF [30,31] and gC1qR/p32 also identified as another potential entry receptor [32]. a number of activities and properties have been identified for the hantavirus envelope glycoproteins. some studies have suggested that apathogenic hantaviruses are indeed apathogenic. some studies have suggested that Gn glycoproteins are directed more rapidly into the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway than are apathogenic forms. some investigators have interpreted differences in the handling of Gn glycoproteins across hantavirus species as independent of pathogenicity. hantaviruses have been identified as adversely affecting endothelial migration over substrata and in potentiating endothelial permeability. hantaviruses have been identified as adversely affecting endothelial migration over substrata and in potentiating endothelial permeability. hantavirus nucleocapsid protein has an inhibitory role in inflammatory responses mediated by NF kappa B (NF-B) the effects on NF-B expression appeared to be confined to prevention of its nuclear translocation after its attempted activation with lipopolysaccharide, LPS. the ribosome can replace the entire EIF4F translational initiation complex. it can replace the entire EIF4F translational initiation complex with a replacement for the cap-binding activity of eIF 4E. the helicase activity of eIF 4A is presumed to be needed to dissociate higher-order RNA structure. these three factors normally work together to achieve translational initiation. pathology and Diagnosis Hantavirus diseases of man have long been suspected of having an immunopathogenic basis in part because of their relatively long incubation period of 2\u20133 weeks. HFRS and HCPS share many clinical features, leading many investigators to consider them to be, in essence, different manifestations of a similar pathogenic process. lethargy, oliguria, tachycardia, facial and truncal flushing, hemorrhage, occasionally noncardiogenic pulmonary edema with tachypnea, shortness of breath, shock, death in 10 to 5%. at least three studies have correlated plasma viral RNA with disease severity for HCPS and HFRS. hantaviruses arrive at their target tissues through uptake by regional lymph nodes, perhaps with or within an escorting lung histiocyte. the virus seeds local endothelium, where the first few infected cells give rise, ultimately, to a primary viremia. for HCPS, that expression favors the pulmonary bed and lymphoid organs, yet spares the retroperitoneum. inflammatory infiltrate can percolate through the coronary circulation with minimal dilution in HCPS, a disadvantageous consequence of the close anatomic juxtaposition of the two organs. at least three classes of potential mechanisms, some overlapping and certainly nonexclusive of the others, could be presumed to underlie the pathogenesis of HCPS. the ANDV-Syrian hamster model has a number of features in common with the human disease, as well as some differences. the hamster model for HCPS appears to be caused by capillary leak that results in pulmonary edema and the production of a pleural effusion with exudative characteristics. hamsters die between 11 and 14-d post-inoculation, reflecting a slightly accelerated incubation period in comparison to human infections. hepatic enzymes do not appear to be present at elevated levels in the blood of diseased hamsters even immediately before death. the protracted incubation period associated with hantavirus disease gives the host considerable time to mount a mature immune response against the virus. despite this, it appears to be possible that natural variation in individual neutralizing antibody responses can be linked to disease severity. a significant fraction of the immunoblast population in patients with HCPS are T cells with specificity for specific class I HLA-presented epitopes of viral antigens. the antiviral activities of such cells can contribute to the endothelial/capillary leak that lies at the heart of hantavirus pathogenesis. the combination of thrombocytopenia, elevated abundance of \u201cimmunoblast\u201d lymphocytes, left-shifted polymorphonuclear cell population without strong morphologic evidence for their activation, and elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit values is highly specific for HCPS. it is likely that hantaviruses arrive at their target tissues through uptake by regional lymph nodes, perhaps with or within an escorting lung histiocyte. local elaboration of inflammatory and chemotactic mediators is considered to be a requirement for the development of systemic disease symptoms. it is not hypoxemia, due to the prominent pulmonary edema, that leads to death in most fatal cases of HCPS. but rather intoxication of the heart by as-yet-undefined mediators leads to the low cardiac output state and the associated shock syndrome. pathogenic hantaviruses are able to recruit platelets to adhere to endothelial cell surfaces, with 3 integrin used as a critical binding element. pathogenic effects caused by the activities of specific viral macromolecules. animal models exist for both the asymptomatic carriage of PUUV and SNV. ANDV-infected hamsters exhibit high titers of live ANDV in their tissues. hantavirus isolates from human tissues have been notoriously difficult to obtain. protracted incubation period associated with hantavirus disease gives host considerable time to mount mature immune response against virus. onset of pulmonary edema, tachycardia and hypertension seemed to be all but universally temporally associated with the appearance of highly-activated cells of the lymphoid lineage in the peripheral blood. cells with close morphologic similarity to these \u201cimmunoblasts\u201d were detected in the congested, heavy lungs of patients who came to autopsy, as well as in lymphoid organs and in the portal triads. a diagnostic service has long been offered in a facility at which many cases of HCPS are treated. the combination of thrombocytopenia, elevated abundance of \u201cimmunoblast\u201d lymphocytes, left-shifted polymorphonuclear cell population without strong morphologic evidence for their activation. the combination of thrombocytopenia, elevated abundance of \u201cimmunoblast\u201d lymphocytes, and elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit values is highly specific for HC xicanus from Costa Rica has been identified as the fulvous pygmy rice rat. in Panama, the first cases of HCPS were reported in 1999. since then, 106 human infections have occurred with a 26% mortality rate. in southern south America, ANDV is the main etiologic agent. in north America, by December 2009 63% of case-patients were males [90]. differences between certain groups are more likely correlated with the type habitat where the population resides. rural communities account for the highest hantavirus incidences overall. a new study in Colorado suggests the possibility that a rodent bite may have been the proximate vehicle for outdoor transmission of hantaviruses. hantaviruses are naturally hosted by rodents (Muridae and Cricetidae) and moles (Talpidae) at least 15 rodent species have been identified as carriers of different pathogenic hantaviruses. some hantavirus genotypes have been described in the same rodent species. hantaviruses typically show high species-specificity and no intermediate host. hantavirus spillover is more likely to occur with host populations inhabiting sympatric or syntopic regions [151,162], and cross-species transmission would presumably have greater chances of success if the host species are closely related. in 1993, an outbreak of patients with HCPS due to SNV occurred in the four Corners states resulting in more than 60% case-fatality among the initial cases. in Panama, an outbreak was reported during 1999\u20132000 in los Santos, and 12 cases where identified with three fatalities. this represented the first report of human hantavirus infections in central America. contrasting patterns relating rodent population size and virus prevalence can be found [175]. higher hosts species diversity is correlated with lower infection prevalence in north America for P. maniculatus [177], in central America for O. fulvescens (reservoir of Choclo virus) and Zygodontomys brevicauda (reservoir of Calabazo virus) [178]. a cascade of events triggered by highly unusual rains in the precedent year have been postulated to result in an increase of primary production and rodent densities. in south America, effects of climate change and hantavirus outbreaks have not been well studied. in the united states, 538 human infections by hantavirus were reported through late December 2009. mys mexicanus from Costa Rica has been identified as the rodent reservoir. in Panama, the first cases of HCPS were reported in 1999. since then, 106 human infections have occurred with a 26% mortality rate. in southern south America, ANDV is the main etiologic agent with cases in Chile and Argentina reported since 1995. in north America, by December 2009 63% of case-patients were males. differences between certain groups are more likely correlated with the

microhabitat, including overstory cover, a cascade of events triggered by highly unusual rains in the precedent year have been postulated to result in an increase of primary production and rodent densities. a complex cascade of events triggered by highly unusual rains in the precedent year have been postulated to result in an increase of primary production and rodent densities. in south America, effects of climate change and hantavirus outbreaks have not been well studied. in this review we discuss the general properties, discoveries and epidemiology/ecology of the new world forms of pathogenic hantaviruses. we also seek to identify some of the characteristics of the viral macromolecules and immunologic mechanisms that have been proposed as potential direct mediators of the pathogenic events that characterize the human disease."}
