{"summary": "bovine babesiosis is a tick-borne disease of cattle caused by apicomplexan protozoa of the genus Babesia. bovine babesiosis may induce clinical conditions characterized by hemolytic anemia and fever, with occasional hemoglobinuria. all cows were subjected to deltamethrin treatments against ticks. clinical signs were observed in 26 lactating cows. animals received oxytetracycline hydrochloride orally for 7 days. the cycling protocol consisted of preheating at 94\u00b0C for 3 min followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min, with a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. other pathogens were searched for through amplification of 16S ribosomal DNA (15) the 18S rRNA gene sequences obtained from the diseased cows were 100% identical to each other and matched with the best nucleotide identity (99.7 to 100%) to analogous sequences of B. occultans retrieved from the GenBank database but not those of other protozoa within the genus. bovine piroplasmosis is a clinical outbreak caused by B. occultans. there was no evidence of coinfections with other pathogens. there was no evidence of coinfections with other pathogens."}
