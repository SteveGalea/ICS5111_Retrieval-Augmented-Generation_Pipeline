{"summary": "METHODS To conduct this 2017 analysis, we reviewed data on program funding levels collected for our annual examination of federal funding for biodefense and health security programs. we then compared funding levels for each program for each fiscal year (FY) and reviewed changes since FY2001. PHEP funding enabled public health laboratories to quickly respond to testing needs for emerging infectious disease threats. routinized planning, training, exercises at hospitals, planning for health care system surge, hiring of hospital preparedness coordinators, and establishing health care coalitions around the united states. funding for CDC\u2019s strategic national stockpile resulted in stocks of drugs, vaccines, and medical supplies that can quickly be deployed around the united states in response to many types of emergencies. funding for the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, biomedical advanced research and development authority, and strategic national stockpile remained relatively steady over time. health departments had few plans in place to respond to epidemics and disasters, very little capability to vaccinate or dispense medical countermeasures emergently, very little in the way of health system surge capacity or planning for mass casualties, and limited research and development to develop new medical countermeasures."}
