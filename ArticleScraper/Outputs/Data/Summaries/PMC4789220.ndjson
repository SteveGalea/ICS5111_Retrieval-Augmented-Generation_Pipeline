{"summary": "introduction calves at greatest risk of developing diarrhea during first month of life. risk then decreases with age. environmental, nutritional and management factors influence severity and outcome. studies show that SAA and Hp have been found useful in herd screening to identify cows with inflammatory diseases. however, sorensen et al. (2006) recommended coupling the determination of the concentrations of two or three APPs. diarrhoeic (aged between 2 and 48 days) and 10 non-diarrhoeic calves (aged between 10 and 30 days) (group C) were used in the study. 13 calves were infected with virus (9 with rotavirus and 4 with coronavirus) serum SAA levels were measured by a solid phase sandwich-ELISA. the analytical sensitivity of this test in serum has been determined as 0.3 g/ml for SAA. the increases at SAA levels were 46.27 9.65 g/ml, 87.24 8.86 g/ml and 103.54 12.84 g/ml in V, P and B groups. mean SAA and Hp levels of the group B and group P were not significantly higher than the group P (P>0.05). dl 1650.2 178.3a 624.6 154.2b 553.5 184.8b 1476.6 256.7a IgA (mg/dl) 385.2 26.4a 280.1 34.6b 268.4 40.3b 368.9 24.5a Different superscript letters (a, b, c) within same row indicate significant (P0.05) differences. serum Hp is a clinically useful parameter for measuring the occurrence and severity of inflammatory responses in cattle with enteritis, peritonitis, endometritis, mastitis, pneumonia, endo-carditis, abscesses, and other natural or experimental infectious conditions. a hundred times of statistically higher levels of Hp in diarrhoeic groups compared to group C can be considered as an indication of the acute and severe infection. the lowest increase in group V can be attributed to the resistance of patients or prolonged infection period. the application of SAA assays to veterinary diagnosis has not been as widespread as that of Hp assays. howover, SAA is elevated more by acute rather than chronic inflammatory conditions (Horadagoda et al., 1999 ). 87.24 8.86 g/ml and 103.54 12.84 g/ml were in normal levels as previously reported for the calves. serum SAA levels were statistically higher (P0.05) in the groups B, P and P compared with group C. failure of passive transfer (serum IgG level below 5 g/L) in two calves and were from the same farm in which only 31% of the calves achieved serum IgG levels >10 g/L. there was a negative correlation between B and V groups for immunoglobulins and the levels of serum Hp and SAA. watching the APP concentrations during the infection may be useful for monitoring the prognosis or treatment of diarrhoeic diseases."}
