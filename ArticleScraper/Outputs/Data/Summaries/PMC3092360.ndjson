{"summary": "china established a case definition for severe acute respiratory syndrome (infectious atypical pneumonia) after may 3, 2003. cases reported as probable according to the case definition in place at the time of report. a panel of experts at the facility reviews clinical information to classify the illness as probable, suspected, or under observation. case classification is updated on the basis of clinical progression and availability of alternative diagnoses to account for the illness. the district is responsible for identifying persons who had contact with the patient between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization. date of onset was missing for 985 (26.8%) of the 3,665 patients with probable and suspected cases reported through may 20, we present temporal information based on date of hospitalization. setting Beijing municipality has an estimated population of 13.8 million and includes 14 districts and four counties. a panel of experts at the facility reviews clinical information to classify the illness as probable, suspected, or under observation. the district is responsible for identifying persons who had close contact with the patient between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization. the district is responsible for identifying persons who had close contact with the patient. data analysis Data were entered into either a Microsoft Excel database or an Oracle database. data analysis used SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) software. date of onset was missing in 155 (4.2%) of case-patients. at least 59 SARS cases in Beijing can be traced back to a 72-year-old man. he was evaluated in one hospital on arrival in Beijing but was not admitted. the next day, his family brought him to a second hospital, where he died. 1,009 (41.3%) had a history of close contact with a patient with SARS. the proportion of probable case-patients with no direct contact with a SARS patient increased from 50.7% for case-patients who were hospitalized before May 1, to 75.2% for those admitted to hospitals in May (p 0.001). the attack rate for probable SARS among healthcare workers in Beijing is estimated as 465 per 100,000. as of may 20, the case-fatality rate was 6.4% for probable SARS case-patients. by June 16, 2003, 190 deaths among probable SARS case-patients were reported from Beijing. admission symptoms Fever 1,646/1,693 (97.2) Cough 749/1,693 (44.2) Difficulty breathing 166/1,693 (9.8) Chest tightness 331/1,693 (19.6) Diarrhea 189/1,693 (9.8) aInformation was not available for the sex of 38 probable case-patients and for the age of 47 probable case-patients reported through may 20. the medical emergency command center included teams for clinical diagnosis and treatment, critical care, patient transport, infection control, and information management. an anticipated shortage of hospital beds for care and isolation of SARS patients prompted authorities to construct a new 1,000-bed hospital in 8 days. the medical and public health task force finished concentrating all probable case-patients into 16 designated municipal hospitals. 98% had SARS-CoV\u2013specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G detected from samples collected >35 days after illness onset. 55% had SARS-CoV\u2013specific IgG detected 16\u201321 days after symptom onset. earliest cases in Beijing occurred in persons infected with SARS in Guangdong and Hong Kong. contact tracing and epidemic investigation suggest that at least 59 SARS cases in Beijing can be traced back to this patient, including illness in three members of his immediate family, in six of seven healthcare workers who assisted in the emergency room resuscitation, and in one other healthcare worker in the facility. the remaining cases occurred in other patients and their contacts. contact tracing and epidemic investigation suggest that at least 59 SARS cases in Beijing can be traced back to this patient. at least 59 cases in Beijing can be traced back to this patient, including illness in three members of his immediate family, in six of seven healthcare workers who assisted in the emergency room resuscitation, and in one other healthcare worker. of the 2,444 probable case-patients, 1,009 (41.3%) had a history of close contact with a patient with SARS; 395 (16.2%) of the probable cases occurred in healthcare workers. 42.9% of probable case-patients had no previous contact with a SARS case-patient or travel to affected areas outside Beijing. the attack rate for probable SARS among healthcare workers in Beijing is estimated as 465 per 100,000. as of may 20, the case-fatality rate was 6.4% for probable SARS case-patients. by June 16, 2003, 190 deaths among 2,521 probable SARS case-patients were reported from Beijing. aInformation was not available for the sex of 38 probable case-patients and for the age of 47 probable case-patients reported through may 20. nearly all SARS case-patients had the initial symptom of fever, and many had a cough, but only 11.0% had diarrhea. a new 1,000-bed hospital was built in 8 days. the medical and public health task force finished concentrating all probable cases of SARS patients into 16 designated municipal hospitals. more than 60 fever clinics were established to triage patients with acute febrile illness. one case-patient originated in Guangdong and transported the virus to Shanxi. a second case-patient appears to have acquired the virus during a hospital visit. the imported cases initiated cascades of illness among the family members, healthcare workers, and other hospitalized patients. the age-specific attack rates of SARS in Beijing support findings from other outbreaks of SARS. high rates among those 20\u201339 years of age likely reflect disease among healthcare workers with occupational exposures. more than 30,000 people were placed under quarantine. more than 30,000 people were placed under quarantine. a strong system of early detection and open communication will facilitate prompt recognition of possible problems. the apparent success of infection control, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine in bringing the outbreak under control is encouraging. if features particular to Beijing had a major influence on evolution or characteristics of the outbreak is not yet clear."}
