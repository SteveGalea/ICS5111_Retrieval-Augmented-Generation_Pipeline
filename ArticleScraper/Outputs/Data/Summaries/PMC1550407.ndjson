{"summary": "the study was carried out to investigate the association between the genetic polymorphisms of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) gene as well as myxovirus resistance 1 (MxA) gene and susceptibility to SARS in china population. 66 cases and 64 close contact uninfected controls were enrolled in this study. SNPs in the OAS1 3'-UTR and MxA promoter region appear associated with host susceptibility to SARS. global outbreak of SARS has killed 774 and infected more than 8098 people in 29 countries and regions. in china, more than 2523 cases and 181 deaths occurred. the polymorphisms at position 347 in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the OAS1 gene and at position 88 in the MxA gene promoter region seemed associated with hepatitis C virus infection [16]. the polymorphisms of these two genes that might affect the susceptibility to SARS were reported in Vietnamese population. information collected using a questionnaire was developed to collect information from both cases and controls. all cases and controls filled in the questionnaire before providing 5 ml anti-coagulated blood with EDTA. all participants signed an informed consent. the cycling protocol was as follows: 10 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 92\u00b0C for 15 s, 60\u00b0C for 1 min. the allelic G/T polymorphism in the promoter region of MxA at position 88 from the transcription start site was genotyped by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) allele, the 351-bp PCR product, was cut into 4 fragments (261, 51, 23 and 16 bp, respectively), and in the presence of the T allele into 3 fragments (312, 23 and 16 bp, respectively). statistical analysis Data were analyzed using the SPSS software (version 10.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) 66 confirmed SARS cases were included in the study. the study protocol was approved by the ethical committee at national center for AIDS prevention and control. DNA extraction Leucocytes were isolated within 12 h of blood collection using Percoll reagent. genomic DNA was extracted using cell DNA extraction kit. the sample with high red fluorescent signals was AA genotype, the sample with high green fluorescent signals was AG genotype. each sample was detected two or three times. conditional logistic regression was performed to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) multivariate analyses were then performed using genetic polymorphisms as independent variables and all the significant variables in univariate analyses as covariables. a P value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. the AG and GG genotypes in the 3'UTR of the OAS1 gene were significantly less frequent in case group (33.3% and 7.6%, respectively) than in control group (48.4% and 15.6%, respectively) compared to AA genotype, AG and GG genotypes were found associated with a protective effect on SARS with ORs (95% CI) of 0.42 (0.200.89) and 0.30 (0.090.97), respectively. 4.2 39.8 MxA -88 genotype 0.006 GG 13(19.7) 24(37.5) 1.00 GT 48(72.7) 29(45.3) 3.06(1.257.53) 0.006 TT 5(7.6) 11(17.2) 0.84(0.203.44) 0.784 allele G 56.1 61.1 T 43.9 38.9 Multivariate analysis results of OAS1 and MxA gene SNPs in relation to SARS.
