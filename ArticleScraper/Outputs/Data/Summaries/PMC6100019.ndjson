{"summary": "macrocyclic peptides are privileged scaffolds for drug development. cyclization of linear peptides of three to eight amino acids can be challenging. epimerization of the C-terminal amino acid is commonly encountered during the cyclization step before the cyclization reaction takes place. linear peptides with the D-configuration at their C-terminal residue have favorable cyclization kinetics. this may be a result of less steric hindrance during the formation of the peptide bond occurring between the D- and L-amino acids. peptide macrocyclization is a way of locking the peptide sequence in a conformation [15,16], a conformation often recognized by their enzyme targets. most cyclic peptide drugs on the market today are administered parenterally. only few are orally bioavailable [1], highlighting an ongoing challenge. synthesis and evaluation of novel cyclopeptide scaffolds to expand our understanding of their pharmacokinetic (PK) properties is still at the forefront of many research programs. this brief review summarizes the preceding five years\u2019 worth of solid-phase cyclohexapeptide synthesis and its applications. this includes natural product total synthesis, synthetic methodology development, and medicinal chemistry. antimicrobial evaluation of 1\u20134 was performed against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Candida albicans. however, only negligible activity was found. hexapeptide 5 was prepared from 2-CTC resin by standard microwave-assisted 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) SPPS (Scheme 2). Cleavage of the hexapeptide from the resin was done using 5% TFA in CH3CN/H2O (4:1). cyclization of 6 proceeded much faster than that of its corresponding O-tert-butyl protected linear peptide counterpart cyclohexaleucine peptides 9 and 10 without N-methylation functionality showed some degree of oral bioavailability. the epimer 10 showed 2\u20133-fold greater membrane permeability than the control standard cyclosporin A (CsA) epimer 10 formed during final cyclization step but could be successfully separated out during purification using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. cyclization was due to a well-known epimerization process that takes place during the carboxylic acid activation step prior to cyclization. natural products contain non-proteinogenic anthranilic acid (Ant) and L-pipecolinic acid (Pip) residues. enhanced bioavailability of these natural products can be attributed to improved cell permeability (via passive diffusion) and higher metabolic stability due to their cyclic nature. the natural products 11\u201314 were tested in a fourth-instar larvae assay. the stereochemistry of the D-Ala side chain was found to be crucial for paralytic activity. the stereochemistry of the side chain was found to be crucial for paralytic activity. cyanobacterium microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 natural products, aerucyclamides A\u2013D, showed promising micromolar IC50 (50% of maximal inhibitory concentration) against a K1 chloroquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum. cyclization of linear precursors to afford 17\u201321 took place at a C-terminal glycine or thiazole to prevent epimerization. of particular interest was the promising antimalarial activity shown by 17, 20, and 21 against P. falciparum K1. rum K1, with EC50 (50% of maximum effective concentration) values of 0.19, 0.19, and 0.41 M, respectively, and no observed cell cytotoxicity against murine macrophages. antitrypanosomal activity of 15 and 19\u201321 against T. b. brucei. the conformations of 23 and 24 were established using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rotating-frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY) experiments. macrocycle 25 was obtained from linear peptides 23 or 24 containing a pseudoproline residue in less than 3 h. in 2015, Prompanya et al. isolated a cyclohexapeptide from a culture of the marine sponge-associated fungus Aspergillus similanensis KUFA 0013 and named it similanamide (27). the reported data for similanamide (27) did, however, agree favorably with a previously synthesized diastereomer 28 [41]. dianthin G (29) and its N-methylated derivatives (31\u201335) were synthesized by SPPS followed by cleavage and solution-phase head-to-tail macrolactamization. the SPPS of native cyclohexapeptide dianthin G (29) was reported previously [43] but later adapted for the synthesis of methylated analogues 31\u201334 (Scheme 7). HBTU-mediated solution-phase cyclization to afford 31. peptide synthesis of 31 on aminomethyl polystyrene resin. native dianthin G (29) and a dicarba bridged analogue were found to increase the number of human osteoblasts without having a significant effect on osteoclast differentiation or development. native dianthin G (29) and native dianthin G (29) were found to increase the number of human osteoblasts without having a significant effect on osteoclast differentiation or development. wollamide B (42) was found to have notable aqueous solubility, moderate affinity for plasma protein albumin, modest lipophilicity, poor passive permeability through artificial membranes, high microsomal metabolic stability, and no toxicity in HepG2 cells. five of the synthesized wollamides displayed potent antimycobacterial activity (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 3.1 M) and no toxicity in HepG2 cells for concentrations of up to 100 M. overall, the synthesized wollamides displayed notable plasma stability and aqueous solubility with moderate to low metabolic stability. optimization study investigated the efficiency of the macrocyclization step occurring at each of the six peptide bond sites. macrocyclization of the linear hexapeptide precursor provided the most efficient macrocyclization without any detectable epimerization. wollamides A (48) and B (42) and desotamide B (49) showed promising antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. MIC values of 1.56 g/mL and favorable selectivity indexes (SIs) of >100 were found to have a major impact on the activity and selectivity. cyclohexapeptides cyclo-Leu-D-Leu-Leu-Leu-D-Pro-Tyr (53) and cyclo-Leu-NMe-D-Leu-Leu-D-Pro-Tyr (54) were synthesized using traditional SPPS starting from a trityl resin preloaded with allyl ester Fmoc-Tyr. the resin-linked linear hexapeptide 55 was two routes for the synthesis of 54 were investigated. first route involving global N-methylation of the resin-bound cyclohexapeptide 57 followed by cleavage was more efficient and provided crude 54 in higher purity before final purification. the presence of the 4-fluorobenzoyl group in the second Lys of 59\u201361 could have an application as a radiolabeling site. the cyclohexapeptide 59 was resistant to bovine trypsin-mediated degradation over 30 min. cyclized peptides offer enhanced metabolic stability over their linear counterparts. cyclohexapeptide 62 was cleaved from the resin with simultaneous removal of the side-chain protection groups. Compound 61 was synthesized by cleaving the cyclohexapeptide 62 from the resin using mild acid conditions. Jikyo reported the synthesis of cyclic hexapeptides 65a\u2013d using an on-resin head-to-tail cyclization strategy on trichloroacetimidate Wang resin. iterative coupling and deprotection steps using BOP/HOBt/DIPEA and 20% piperidine/DMF. PPh3)4 in CHCl3/AcOH/N-methylmorpholine (NMM) was used to complete C-terminal O-allyl deprotection before the addition of 20% piperidine in DMF to remove N-terminal Fmoc. on-resin cyclization of 64c, having two D-Pro residues in the chain, gave the highest yield of cyclized product 65a\u2013d with a yield of 63%. the allyl group was uncapped with Pd(PPh3)4 and phenylsilane. the N-terminal amino group was then released by using a treatment of 20% piperidine/DMF to form the linear peptide precursor 68. cyclohexapeptide 71 showed inhibitory antibacterial activity for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)2 (MIC = 128 g/mL), MRSA4 (MIC = 32 g/mL), MRSA5 (MIC = 64 g/mL), and S. aureus (MIC = 64 g/mL) wollamide B (42) showed higher cytotoxicity than 73 in MCF-7 and HepG-2 assays. s lacked cytotoxicity against both human tumor cells MCF-7 and HepG-2, except for wollamide B (42), which exhibited cytotoxicity against HepG-2. in 2018, Fagundez et al. synthesized cyclohexapeptides via Fmoc/SPPS by using 2-CTC resin followed by macrolactamization either on-resin (75\u201378) or in solution phase after cleavage of linear peptide cyclopentapeptides 75 and 76 exhibited a free carboxylic group from Glu. 74 cyclo-Cys(Trt)-Gly-Thr(tBu)-Gly-Cys(Trt)-Gly was determined to be very active as well as selective against P. falciparum. cyclohexapeptides represent an important class of natural products and medicinal molecules. SPPS has enabled the rapid, efficient synthesis of hexapeptide and peptidomimetic libraries for subsequent biological evaluation and high-throughput screening. lute conditions (1\u20135 mM) can favor cyclization over dimer/oligomer formation. using a turn-inducing pseudoproline residue can greatly enhance cyclization rates. epimerization of the C-terminal amino acid during cyclization can be attenuated by using efficient coupling reagents."}
