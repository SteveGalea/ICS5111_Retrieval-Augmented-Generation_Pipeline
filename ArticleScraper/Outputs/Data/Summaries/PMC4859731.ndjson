RNA detection was performed using HD-FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to manufacturer's instructions. petri dishes were incubated in the dark at 37\u00b0C for an additional 1 h. the cells were counterstained with 1 g/ml DAPI (Invitrogen) the coverslips were removed from the glass-bottom dishes using removal fluid (MatTek) cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) or anti-myosin IIA rabbit pAb (Sigma) after 1 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, cells were washed with PBS and a secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) cells were stained with pAb sc-20800 (Santa Cruz) that recognizes the SV40 large T antigen in HEK-293T cells. after 1 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, cells were washed with PBS. proteins were separated on an 8 to 16% SDS-PAGE gradient gel (Invitrogen) the membrane was probed with a protein-specific MAb or pAb. imaging of the blot was performed using an Odyssey infrared imaging system. a 2-fold dilution of the serum sample was prepared in a 96-well plate. the serum-virus complex was transferred onto confluent MARC-145 cells. at 18 hpi, cells were fixed using acetone-methanol at 20\u00b0C for 30 min. the actin inhibitor cytochalasin D (Sigma) and the myosin II inhibitor ML7 (Sigma) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) the cells were stored as 10 mM stocks at 20\u00b0C in aliquots for single use. fetal bovine serum was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 g/ml streptomycin. cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. the GFP-PRRSV isolate SD95-21 was used for subsequent experiments. anti-beta-actin and anti-nonmuscle myosin IIA MAbs were obtained from Abcam. rabbit antiserum to myosin IIA MAbs were obtained from Sigma. abcam MAb ab55456 Nonmuscle myosin IIA 215 (heavy chain) Sigma pAb sc-20800 SV40 large T antigen of HEK-293T cells 94 Santa Cruz a PRRSV strain SD95-21. the plasmid (pCMV-SD95-21-GFP) was constructed by inserting the GFP gene into a pSD95-21 full-length cDNA infectious clone. the set of probes containing 43 CAL594-labeled specific probes was generated. cells were infected with PRRSV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 in 35-mm glass-bottom dishes. MARC-145 cells or PAMs were grown on glass-bottom 35-mm cell culture dishes. cells were infected with PRRSV at an MOI of 0.1 or mock infected with the infection medium. a specific MAb at a concentration of 1:1,000 was used to detect PRRSV proteins. infected MARC-145 cells or transfected HEK-293T cells were set into an open cultivation system of the Zeiss confocal microscope. the live-cell chamber was mounted on a heated stage to maintain the culture at 37\u00b0C. the live-cell chamber was mounted on a heated stage to maintain the culture at 37\u00b0C. protein, MAb 140-68 was used at concentrations of 1:150 in PBS. secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 488 AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Alexa Fluor 594 AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were added at concentrations of 1:250 in PBS. myosin and actin were coimmunoprecipitated from PRRSV-infected pigs using anti-GP5 MAb. protein bands at predicted sizes of myosin and actin were excised. blot was performed using an Odyssey infrared imaging system. fixed cells were stained with PRRSV N protein-specific MAb. titers were interpreted as the number of fluorescent focus units per milliliter. serum dilution caused greater than 90% inhibition of virus infection. the cells were infected with 200 TCID50 of PRRSV. after 1 h of incubation, the cells were washed twice with 1 PBS. the cells were fixed and stained at 24 hpi, and the supernatant was added. in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells, GP5 was detected as punctate structures spreading through the nanotubes, while N appeared to be inside the nanotubes. the abundance of nanotubes in PAMs was lower than that in MARC-145 cells, which could be related to differences in cell morphology and density. nanotubes connecting two infected cells could be easily detected under each microscopic field of view. all nanotubes contained nsp2 and GP5 (Fig. 2O and P) however, most of them did not contain GP4 (Fig. 2O) p8 (F and M), GP4 (G and N) together with F-actin (A to G) and myosin IIA (H to N) were labeled with green fluorescence. cytoskeleton proteins were labeled with red fluorescence. the PRRSV nsp2 was labeled with green fluorescence. viral RNA was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization of RNA using a CAL594-labeled PRRSV N gene RNA FISH probe (red) cell nucleus is stained with DAPI (blue) the colocalized foci are readily visible in the nanotubes (yellow) small foci with intercellular nanotube connections were observed at 12 hpi. larger foci with more nanotubes were observed at 24 and 36 hpi. to confirm that neutralizing antibody remained through time course, cell culture supernatants were inoculated onto fresh MARC-145 cells. the results were interpreted as the number of fluorescent focus units per ml. NS, negative-control serum from a noninfected pig; PS, immune serum from a PRRSV-infected pig. the presence of neutralizing antibody in the cell culture supernatant restricted the extracellular virus spread, leaving the nanotube connections to spread the infection. HEK-293T cells were transfected with a PRRSV full-length cDNA infectious clone, pCMV-SD95-21-GFP. at 24 h postinfection, cells were analyzed using a live-cell image system of a confocal microscope. viral progenies were produced in transfected cells. at 24 h posttransfection, cell culture supernatant was harvested. the virus titer was determined by fluorescent-focus assay. rabbit antiserum specifically recognizes SV40 large T antigen of HEK-293T cells. nanotubes were observed connecting infected MARC-145 cells with HEK-293T cells. in this particular image, the infection was transferred from the MARC-145 cell to a fairly distant HEK-293T cell. leton proteins F-actin and myosin are present in intercellular nanotube structures. the membrane proteins of several other viruses were previously reported to interact with myosin (8, 31) intercellular nanotube structures were harvested at 36 hpi. tting confirmed that myosin IIA and F-actin coprecipitated with GP5. but they were not detected in the coprecipitate of GP4. the specificity of the experimental condition was further confirmed using anti-mouse IgG as a control. proteins were separated by 8 to 16% Tris-glycine gradient gels. proteins were immunoblotted by PRRSV protein-specific MAbs. co-IP was performed in PRRSV-infected cells using the antibody against myosin IIA. PRRSV-infected cells treated with ML7 or cytochalasin D showed significantly fewer (80% less) intercellular nanotube connections than those that were treated with DMSO. in the presence of either inhibitor, cell viabilities were not affected at the tested concentration (5 M for ML7 and cytochalasin D) effects of cytochalasin D or ML7 on the viability of the MARC-145 cells compared to the viability of DMSO-treated (0 M) or nontreated (NT) control cells. titration was conducted using cell culture supernatant collected from the experiment in shown in panel A. microscopy, contiguous, long F-actin- and myosin IIA-containing intercellular nanotubes were clearly visualized connecting two neighboring cells. there was a 6.5-fold increase in the number of nanotubes in infected cells at 12 hpi compared to the level observed in noninfected cells. in PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells, GP5 was detected as punctate structures spreading through the nanotubes. nanotubes that we detected lacked GP4 could be easily detected under each microscopic field of view. other cells were doubly stained with anti-nsp2 pAb and anti-GP4 MAb. however, most of them did not contain GP4. the fixed cells were immunostained for nsp1 (A and H), nsp2TF (B and I), nsp2 (C and J), nsp4 (D and K), nsp7 (E and L), nsp8 (F and M), or GP4 (G and N) together with F-actin (A to G) or myosin IIA (H to N) nucleocapsid proteins transport with viral RNA through intercellular nanotubes. RNA was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization of RNA using a CAL594-labeled PRRSV N gene RNA FISH probe (red) the colocalized foci are readily visible in the nanotubes. at 6, 12, 24, and 36 hpi, cells were immunostained with anti-N MAb. it takes about 12 h for PRRSV to complete a cycle of replication. it takes about 12 h for PRRSV to complete a cycle of replication and release progeny particles. at 6, 12, 24, or 36 hpi, cell culture supernatant was harvested. cells were fixed and stained with anti-N MAb. the results were interpreted as the number of fluorescent focus units per ml. the yellow arrows and inset squares indicate the position of GFP-nsp2 as it moves from the lower cell into the upper cell. similar results were obtained under both cell culture conditions. HEK-293T cells do not express the PRRSV receptor. they can support PRRSV replication once the viral genome is transfected. at 24 h posttransfection, cell culture supernatant was harvested. the virus titer was determined by fluorescent-focus assay. naive HEK-293T cells were fixed and visualized by confocal microscopy. after 36 h of cell cocultivation, cells were fixed and stained with anti-nsp2 MAb 140-68 and anti-SV40 T antigen pAb sc-20800. the nsp2 was labeled with green fluorescence. SV40 large T antigen was labeled with red fluorescence. images were taken by a confocal microscope (LSM 880; Zeiss) 2TF, nsp4, nsp7, nsp8, GP4, GP5, and N protein were used in IP and Western blotting analysis. immunoprecipitated proteins from PRRSV-infected cells were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with antibodies against myosin IIA and F-actin. the specificity of the experimental condition was further confirmed using anti-mouse IgG as a PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cell lysates were immunoblotted using anti-myosin IIA pAb. the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 8 to 16% Tris-glycine gradient gels. the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 8 to 16% Tris-glycine gradient gels. PRRSV-infected cells were treated with ML7, cytochalasin D, or solvent control dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) ML7 is a specific inhibitor of myosin light-chain kinase, regulating myosin IIA function. ML7 depolymerizes actin by binding to F-actin, which causes breakage of actin filaments. at 24 hpi, cells were fixed and immunostained with PRRSV N protein-specific MAb. images in columns 1 and 3 were taken using a 20 objective lens. the inset at the bottom right corner of each image shows a 40 zoomed region of interest. intercellular transport of viral genomic RNA and replicase proteins is sufficient for rapid spreading of the infection. the presence of PRRSV replicase proteins nsp1, nsp2, nsp4, nsp7, and nsp8 were associated with intercellular nanotubes. b could also recognize nsp9; however, a future study using an nsp9 C terminus-specific antibody is needed to confirm the presence of nsp9 in the nanotube connections. due to lack of specific antibodies to nsp1, nsp5-nsp6 and nsp10 to nsp12, whether these replicase-associated proteins are transported through the nanotube connections needs to be determined in the future. a GP5/M protein heterodimer of arterivirus plays an important role in viral envelope formation. it was reported that a GP5/M protein heterodimer of arterivirus plays an important role in viral envelope formation. viral genomic RNA is packaged with N proteins to form the nucleocapsid. this result is expected since viral genomic RNA is required to generate the next cycle of viral replication. this could be a mechanism for protecting the integrity of viral RNA during the transportation process. V nsp1, nsp2, nsp4, GP5, and nsp8-specific antibodies detected in intercellular nanotubes. nsp2TF-, nsp7-, and nsp8-specific antibodies were not coprecipitated. this could be caused by lower protein expression levels, insensitivity of our assay, or other unrevealed mechanism(s) cell-to-cell transmission of PRRSV through nanotubes could take place in peripheral tissues, a process that is resistant to neutralizing antibodies. this may contribute to viral persistence in peripheral tissues."}
