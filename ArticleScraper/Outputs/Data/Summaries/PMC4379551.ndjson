{"summary": "filoviruses are the causative agents of severe hemorrhagic fever. they are enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses belonging to two genera. there are at least five Ebolavirus species and a single Marburgvirus species. es requiring more than 7 days in culture and the requirement for high-level biocontainment (biosafety level-4) the plaque assay is dependent on a number of key parameters: cell type, cell confluency, inoculum volumes, agarose concentrations of primary and secondary overlays. VC 2100 (ViroCyt, Boulder, CO, USA) is a reengineered non-sorting analytical flow cytometer developed to directly quantify virus particles in solution independent of the virus species. a single universal staining step uses a proprietary stain that is a combination of two fluorescent dyes. as the stained virus passes through the laser the VC simultaneously detects both fluorescent signatures and is counted as an intact virus (particle) a series of dilutions should be tested to determine the best dilution to use in subsequent analyses. the staining process for the VC takes 30 min and does not require a wash step. a large number of viruses have been counted on the instrument. the viroCyt\u00ae Virus Counter 2100 instrument and suitability for filovirus particle quantitation requires these assays to be standardized and validated. we compared the VC to TEM using a number of different filovirus stocks propagated in vero E-6 (African green monkey kidney, Clone E-6) cells. the coded samples were tested with each quantitative method. previously characterized stocks of EBOV, Kikwit variant, Sudan virus, Gulu variant, and Marburg virus were analyzed to compare the VC and TEM particle concentrations. the RNA was purified using the QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit. volumes pre- and post-extraction were equivalent. samples were assayed undiluted on the ABI 7500 instrument. v = b e a d s c o u n t e a d c o u n t e a d c o n c e n t r a t i o n p e r m l (1) Viral particles per mL = v i r a l p a r t i c all VC results greater than this value were considered statistically distinguishable from the negative control. Xneg is the mean value of the negative control samples; neg is the standard deviation of the negative control samples. t99% is the t value for N-1 degrees of freedom at the 99% confidence level. four serial 14 log dilutions were prepared from the 1:10 dilution (1:100 to 1:1,000,000) for a total of nine dilutions (samples) the stock used to prepare diluted samples had an initial plaque assay titer of 1.78E+07 PFU/mL. RT-PCR Each sample was tested in triplicate with an EBOV-specific qRT-PCR assay developed and validated in our laboratory [8,12]. synthetic viral RNA representative of the target region of the EBOV-Kikwit assay diluted in RNase free water was used to generate a standard curve for the determination of EBOV-Kikwit variant concentration. three grids were prepared for each sample. all viral particles and polystyrene beads were counted in at least 10 randomly chosen squares on each grid. VP/mL was determined by dividing counted particles by the calculated volume of sample. negative control sample was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. results were automatically analyzed by the instrument software and reported as VP/mL. v = b e a d s c o u n t e a d c o u n t e a d c o n c e n t r a t i o n p e r m l (1) Viral particles per mL = v i r a l p a r t i c the sample quantification limit was determined using the following equation. Xneg is the mean value of the negative control samples. t99% is the t value for N-1 degrees of freedom at the 99% confidence level. all samples were tested in triplicate; bars represent standard deviation. every sample was quantified by plaque assay (Figure 1a) the number of plaques used to determine each sample\u2019s titer were between 18 and 58 per well except for the most dilute sample (1:1,000,000 dilution) the stock virus (equivalent to 1.23E+03 PFU/mL) was detected. results from the 1:100,000 dilution fell outside the linear range of the assay. the GE/mL of this seed stock was determined to be 3.40E+10, a difference of 0.25 logs from the original GE/mL concentration. sample VP/mL results equal to or below this value were reported as below the limit of detection of the instrument. no virus particles were detected in sample dilutions greater than 1:100 (equivalent to 1.03E+05 PFU/mL) results from the VC are shown in Figure 1d. the VC and qRT-PCR quantitative techniques correlated well with the traditional plaque assay. however, the TEM particle count did not correlate. there is no correlation between the two virus particle quantitative methods when using TEM results for all three dilutions. nucleic acid concentration, reported as genomic equivalents per mL, was determined using an EBOV-specific qRT-PCR (three replicates each). Virus particle counts per mL were measured using the ViroCyt\u00ae Virus Counter 2100 instrument and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) bars represent standard deviation. the differences between the two methods are shown for each virus stock. the differences range from 0.23 to 0.91 logs. the log difference in particle counts is shown in the last column. filovirus plaque quantitation-specific assays vary depending on the size of the biocontainment space, user preferences, and specific needs. the assay measures infectious virus but the ratio of infectious virus particle to plaque is unknown. the technique is relatively expensive, requiring a virus-specific set of primers and probes, a reproducible source of control material, and a skilled technician to minimize contamination. TEM is faster than plaque assay and takes only hours to complete. different methods of sample preparation can lower the limit of detection to 1E+05 VP/mL, but use of these methodologies requires purification through sucrose density gradients or concentration by high-speed pelleting followed by fixation and embedding in resin. TEM particle counts are highly variable, with reports in the literature of relative error as high as 40% and standard deviations of up to 0.5 logs. the VC is a rapid method, providing real-time results for multiple samples in less than 1 h. cost per sample is approximately $15 ($4.75 per replicate) the one-step assay, instrument, and software are easy to use and do not require a highly trained individual. repeatability of this assay was similar to the plaque assay with CV ranging from 9.4% to 31.5%. VP/mL values were within 0.51 logs for samples that fell within the linear range of the assay. TEM assay would have been linear. material produced when compared to the number of virus particles measured by the VC and an additional two logs more particles than infectious virus. similar patterns were noted for filoviruses by Weidman and colleagues when comparing plaque assay, qRT-PCR, and a focus-forming assay using virus-specific antibodies."}
