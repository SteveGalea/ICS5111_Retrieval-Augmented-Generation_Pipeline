{"summary": "retrospective study was performed including a total of 37 post-SARS ONFH patients (66 hip joints) in the department of Orthopedics of the general hospital of Tianjin Medical University between November 2003 and November 2015. the combined treatment showed different efficacies on different ARCO stages; the best was on ARCO Phase I. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) broke out in most cities of china. the incidence of ONFH is 60%\u201370% after SARS treatment. post-SARS ONFH is caused by the application of high dosage of glucocorticoid hormones during SARS treatment. dging criteria Degree of clinical pain was evaluated based on visual analog scale (VAS) approach. each patient was re-examined monthly on VAS, Harris score and femoral joint MRI examination. t-test was used to compare effective rate of femoral necrosis between Stage I and Stage III. a statistical significance was defined when p0.05. a total of 44 post-SARS ONFH patients were recruited between November 2013 and November 2015. a total of 5\u20138 courses were performed within 2\u20133 months. each patient was re-examined monthly on VAS, Harris score and femoral joint MRI examination. a statistical significance was defined when p0.05. the average age of patients at disease onset was 29.9, ranging from 19 to 47 years. there were 29 bilateral necrosis and 8 unilateral cases. all patients presented hip joint pain to different degrees. 78.788.79 at the 9th year (9th year Student\u2019s t-test [t4b] =3.138, p0.05) and 80.149.47 at the 12th year (12th year Student\u2019s t-test [t5b] =3.590, p0.05). patient VAS and Harris score were all significantly improved after 12-year treatment. the post-treatment values at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 years were compared with pre-treatment, the p-values were 0.017, 0.009, 0.007, 0.003 and 0.001 respectively. femoral head necrosis ratio by MRI examination All 37 patients (with 66 hips) were staged based on the ARCO guideline. the average age of patients at disease onset was 29.9, ranging from 19 to 47 years. the average age of patients at disease onset was 29.9. patients showed significant improvements on VAS score. averaged VAS score decreased from 6.811.70 before treatment to 6.431.66 at 1 year afterward. averaged VAS score was further lowered with elongated treatment time. VAS and Harris score of 37 post-SARS ONFH patients were significantly improved after 12-year treatment (Table 1). for VAS score, the post-treatment values at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 years were compared with pre-treatment, the p-values were 0.014, 0.009, 0.002, 0.000 and 0.000, respectively. for Harris score, the post-treatment values at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 years were compared with pre-treatment. combined therapy has different effectiveness treating femoral head necrosis at Stage I to Stage III, with the highest effective rate in Stage I patients. improvements included alleviation of pain and lameness and partial recovery of hip joint functions, such as buckling and abduction. major conservation treatments include drugs, hyperbaric oxygen, extracorporeal shock, pulsed electromagnetic treatment, decreased loading, and proper breaking and retraction. study performed combined treatment including alendronate sodium, extracorporeal shock and hyperbaric oxygen on all included patients, followed by 12-year post-op follow-up. Vulpiani et al found that ESWT could benefit bone reconstruction and regeneration via stimulating vascular growth factor expression. compared ESWT and surgery approach and found that ESWT had significant clinical efficacy and less probability of surgery. study performed regular combined treatment consisting of alendronate drug, extracorporeal shock wave and hyperbaric oxygen. by 12-year long-term follow-up, some patients showed clinical improvement of ONFH, while most patients showed retardation of disease progression or even reversion."}
