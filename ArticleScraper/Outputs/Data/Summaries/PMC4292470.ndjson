{"summary": "studies show large-scale infectious disease outbreaks were triggered by airborne transmission of the viral agents (4\u20137). ultraviolet irradiation (8\u201311), chemical agents (12), electrical fields (13, 14), ion emission (15\u201318), ozone generation (19), and microwave irradiation (20\u201323) in recent years, atmospheric-pressure cold plasma (APCP) has gained increased attention for the inactivation of microbial agents due to its high degree of effectiveness. APCP was produced using a helium-oxygen (0.75%, vol/vol) gas mixture (36) that study also reported a positive association between the percentage of oxygen in the mixture and the virus inactivation rate (36). APCP technology has yet to be applied to the in situ inactivation of airborne viruses under different experimental conditions. the experimental setup used in this study is schematically presented in Fig. 1. the main elements include a Collison nebulizer (BGI Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), used for aerosolizing viruses from the MS2 suspension. we tested the APCP generator described in a previous work (34) and shown in Fig. 1 at three generation power levels. each of the exposed and control viral aerosol samples was continuously collected for 20 min. the bioSampler was charged with 20 ml of deionized (DI) water. the sampling flow rate was calibrated using a mini-Buck calibrator. 200 l of viral suspensions with different concentrations was added into the wells of a 96-well plate with 3 replicates. the suspensions were exposed to the APCP produced using a microjet plasma generation device (38) at power levels of 20, 24, and 28 W and exposure times of 30, 60, 120, and 180 s. only negative high voltage was tested for this study. cDNA, forward primers, and reverse primers used in previous work were used for amplifying viral surface protein genes. the cDNA, capsid (coat) protein gene (160 bp), replicase protein gene (937 bp) and lysis protein gene (114 bp) the RT-PCR cycle conditions were set to the following: 50\u00b0C for 30 min. the gel was prepared using a kit following the manufacturer's instruction. for the electrophoresis buffer, 1 Tris-glycine in a total volume of 300 ml was used. a volume of 10 l of suspension containing either control or treated MS2 virus was added to the prepared gel. fresh phage suspensions were prepared for each experiment. both exposure and control (without plasma treatment) runs used the same batch of MS2. the main elements include a Collison nebulizer (BGI Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) liters/min using nitrogen gas (N2), and the viral aerosols were delivered to the exposure test chamber by an additional dry N2 flow rate (Qdry) of 13 liters/min. each of the exposed and control viral aerosol samples was continuously collected for 20 min. posed and PFUcontrol are the culturable viral aerosol concentrations (in number of PFU) with and without the APCP treatment. the same MS2 bacteriophage was treated with APCP while in suspension (not airborne); the testing examined longer exposure time intervals up to 3 min. temperature in liquid suspension ranged from 26.7\u00b0C to 36.2\u00b0C. the exposure control test was conducted in three replicates. the damage to MS2 viral RNA genes was investigated using waterborne MS2 viruses with the APCP treatment. the gel was prepared using a kit following the manufacturer's instruction. a volume of 10 l of suspension containing either control or treated MS2 virus was added to the prepared gel and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. the APCP treatment performed using ambient air as the gas carrier at 28 W for 0.12 s inactivated more than 95% (1.3-log reduction) of the viruses in the air. APCP with Ar-O2 (2%, vol/vol) was not as efficient, inactivating only 50% (0.3-log reduction) of viruses. the highest dependency of its viral aerosol inactivation on the power level, followed by plasma with He-O2 (2%, vol/vol) and ambient air as gas carriers. the estimated exposure time was 0.12 s. to extend the plasma exposure time, waterborne MS2 viruses were used for further tests. the differences in inactivation resulting from different gas carriers were likely due to the interaction of MS2 viruses with different plasma chemistries. the discrepancy may be associated with the different die-off times of the ROS and the charged particles released from the APCP. data points and error bars represent the average values and standard deviation from three independent measurements. spectroscopy (OES) image of the APCP generated with plasma device shown in Fig. 1. plasma generation power levels were low (20 W), medium (a middle level [Mid]; 24 W) and high (28 W). a.u., arbitrary units. replicase protein gene with 120 s exposure may have been caused by the nonuniform plasma exposure to the viral suspension due to the airflow used to produce the plasma. damage to the maturation and replicase genes made the virus unable to express the related proteins, which impeded its ability to seek the host and replicate. the APCP exposure significantly decreased the levels MS2 virus survival for both the airborne and liquid-borne states. the survival of the aerosolized viruses was observed to decrease with increasing power levels. the data from Fig. 2 suggest that the ambient air carrier produced the highest level of inactivation at power levels of 20 and 24 W, followed by the gas carriers Ar-O2 (2%, vol/vol) and He-O2 (2%, vol/vol) at a power level of 28 W, the Ar-O2 mixture was found to be the most efficient in inactivating aerosolized viruses, followed by ambient air and He-O2 (2%, vol/vol) the survival of waterborne MS2 viruses decreased as the exposure time increased from 30 to 180 s. a longer exposure time corresponded to lower survival of the waterborne MS2 viruses (R2 > 0.95 for all energy levels) Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) identified the ROS in the emission peaks when testing was done with gas carriers such as Ar-O2 (2%, vol/vol) and He-O2 (2%, vol/vol) from the data presented in Fig. 4 it can be seen that the amount of O increased with increasing plasma generation power level. this resulted in rates of virus survival with He-O2 (2%, vol/vol) higher than those found with Ar-O2 (2%, the MS2 virion size is about 27 nm (39), while MS2 RNA is tightly compacted within the virion and confined to a radius of 8.3 1 nm (40). the MS2 coat protein shell is approximately 13.6 2 nm in size and has a thickness of 2.1 1 nm (40). damage to the viral RNA genes that code for four major viral surface proteins, the maturation protein (A protein), the capsid protein, the replicase protein, electron microscope images of waterborne MS2 viruses treated and untreated with the APCP. the gas carrier was ambient air, the plasma generation power was 24 W. the time of exposure to plasma was 30, 60, 120, or 180 s. the APCP exposure can significantly degrade the MS2 viral surface proteins. the plasma was generated with the device used to test waterborne viruses. the plasma generation power was 28 W, and the time of exposure was 180 s. the highest temperature generated in the liquid suspension was about 36.2\u00b0C. this temperature does not affect the viability of the viruses. a previous study has shown that the A protein is exposed to the capsid surface and directly binds the MS2 genomic RNA. the coat protein is reported to interact with RNA at 20 sites along the RNA backbone (44) damage to the coat proteins would affect the infection ability of the MS2 viruses. supplementary material Supp_81_3_996__index.html (1KB, html)."}
