{"summary": "cytokine storms are associated with sepsis and septic shock [6], influenza, acute respiratory distress [7], host response to blood transfusion or bone marrow transplantation. cytokine storms are associated with sepsis and septic shock [6], influenza, acute respiratory distress [7], host response to blood transfusion or bone marrow transplantation. animal models, Phase I clinical trials were scheduled for testing in humans. six healthy male volunteers received TGN1412 and two volunteers received a placebo. the drug\u2019s recipients had headaches, muscle pain, nausea, diarrhea, decreased blood pressure, and increased heart rate. patients treated with corticosteroids, chlorpheniramine, acetaminophen, ondansetron, metaraminol, methylprednisolene, and an anti-IL2 receptor antagonist antibody. cytokine histories reflect the natural reactions of the subjects but their response to therapy. all nine cytokines are then analyzed concurrently in an eighteenth-order system. a unified search over all of the higher-order system\u2019s parameters improves the fit to the measured variables. the coupled model illustrates multi-class interactions among the cytokines. a, b, and x 2(0) are determined by least-squares fit to the trial\u2019s median response. a and b are positive constants that express the sensitivity of the cytokine\u2019s acceleration,x 2(t), to concentration and rate of change. value eigenvalues, the response time constants, 1 and 2 (days), are the negative inverses of 1 and 2 (days), and the two response modes reflect exponential growth or decay. for 1, the mode is underdamped and oscillatory. eq. 11 for each cytokine generates nine sets of 1, 2, and x 2(0). initial rate of change in concentration represents each cytokine\u2019s response to drug input. time constants of response range from 0.14 to 0.65 days. modeled concentrations peak within a day and decay at the same rates as the data. the concentration of IL12 is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the other cytokines. responses to incremental changes in cytokine concentration are shown in Fig. 3. the negative rates of change peak during the first day, while the concentrations decay smoothly to zero. the 27-parameter minimization reproduces the 18 eigenvalues and 9 initial rates of change of Table 1 to at least 3 significant digits. each of the 72 off-diagonal (22) blocks of A contains a concentration sensitivity coefficient in its lower-left element. the cost function is minimized with respect to 90 parameters. the p C estimate stabilizes and becomes insensitive to the value of rC. the 90-parameter minimization reduces the error cost by 20%. however, the trace of the estimated A C is about 3% higher than the trace of A UC. 0.206 0.672 0.818 IFN\u2032\u2032 0.554 18.641 0.078 1.576 1.542 0.128 0.184 0.696 0.903 IL10\u2032\u2032 0.487 0.846 3.320 0.145 0.727 0.111 0.030 0.017 0.617 IL8\u2032\u2032 0.992 0.207 1.566 13.571 0.058 0.823 0.316 0.046 3.356 IL6\u2032\u2032 0.412 1.688 0.303 0.042 2.784 0.640 0.7 IL6 and IL8 are involved in six strong coupling pathways. the three largest effects of IL1, IL2 and IL8 are inductive. the three largest effects of IL12 are inhibitory. state-space plots portray motifs of the most significant cytokine responses. when the three cytokines respond on similar time scales, the curves contain \u201chairpin\u201d kinks. an initial perturbation in IFN- stimulates a fast, small IL10 response with a slower and larger IL6 response. d1 P, d, - EV #1 EV #2 EV #3 1 \u20130.84 \u2013 IL10 IL6 IL8 2 \u20131.4 j0.75 3.93 0.89 IL6 TNF IL10 3 \u20131.88 \u2013 IL8 TNF IL1 4 \u20132.27 j0.61 2.66 0.97 IL1 IL8 IFN 5 \u20133.28 j0.60 1.89 0.98 IL1 IL10 IFN/ y 1(tk) is associated with the largest singular value of Z. the first principal component is correlated with 92% of the cytokine responses. the next two components account for 7% of the correlation. Fig. 9 shows closeness of cytokine covariances. IFN-, IL2, IL4, IL8 and IL12 are similar to each other. mixed-category cytokines (IL6 and IL12) appear in fastest and slowest groups. canceling individual effects provides an assessment of the significance of the missing variable\u2019s dynamic coupling on the remaining eight cytokines. eliminating TNF- has a weak effect on IL12, but little effect on other cytokines. lack of IFN- induces more significant changes in IL10 and IL6. the TGN1412 infusion rate is represented by u(t) and it affects cytokine propagation through the (181) matrix, B. the odd elements of B are zero, and the even elements are derived from the estimated initial rates. the 4-min\u2013infusion simulation is virtually identical to the results for instantaneous infusion. probability distributions, whether Gaussian or not, are characterized to second order by their means and covariances. the mean vector,/, and covariance matrix, P(t), for an ensemble of multi-dimensional random variables, x(t), are. i(tk) vs. tk would produce an envelope containing 68% of probable responses if the random variables were Gaussian. the computation interval, t, is 0.01 days. initial uncertainties in IL 6 and IL10 are the slowest to decay. IL6 and IL10 concentrations show the largest continuing uncertainty. IL12 and IFN- are the lowest. small random uncertainties in stability matrix coefficients can be assessed. the effects of clinical treatment are subsumed in the values of a and b. the cytokine\u2019s response modes are characterized by the eigenvalues, 1 and 2 (rad/day), of A, which are the roots of the characteristic equation, (4). eq. 11 for each cytokine generates nine sets of 1, 2, and x 2(0). the initial rate of change in concentration represents each cytokine\u2019s response to drug input. time constants of response range from 0.14 to 0.65 days. d1 2, d1 1, d 2, d P, d, -x 2(0), pg/mL-d TNF- 2.63 2.63 0.38 0.38 2.39 1 32821 IFN- 7.21 2.05 0.14 0.49 1.63 1.2 55328 IL10 2.08 2.08 0.48 0.48 3.02 1 12047 IL8 6.71 1.84 0.15 0.54 1.79 1.22 50804 IL6 1.55 1.55 0.65 0.65 4.05 unit drug infusion is modeled as an impulsive force, producing initial rates of change in the cytokines. IL6 is the slowest to respond, but it reaches the highest peak. the IL6 concentration lingers for about four days, while the IFN- response is over in two days. the error cost, J, is defined as, (16) where z(tk) is the (91) vector of clinical measurements at tk, and x c(tk) is the (91) vector of cytokine concentrations predicted by the model. the diagonal matrix, Q, normalizes the cytokine residuals to give them equivalent weight in the cost function. the error cost, J, is defined as, (16) where z(tk) is the (91) vector of clinical measurements at tk, and x c(tk) is the (91) vector of cytokine concentrations predicted by the model. the diagonal matrix, Q, normalizes the cytokine residuals to give them equivalent weight in the cost function: (17) denoting the coupling parameters by the (721) vector, p C, a soft constraint weighted by rC is added to the error cost. the 90-parameter minimization reduces the error cost by 20%. the trace penalty is several orders of magnitude smaller than the trace of A UC.

TNF-, IFN-, and IL4 are involved in six strong coupling pathways. IL6 and IL8 participate in seven strong coupling pathways. cytokines are plotted on the vertical (z) axis, and the two most highly perturbed cytokines are plotted on the horizontal (x and y) axes. the initial condition for each plot is (0, 0, 1), and after five days, the state approaches (0, 0, 0). IFN- and IL4 are equally represented in Mode 5, while IFN- and IL8 have equal representation in Mode 9. this suggests that these cytokines are most involved in inter-cytokine coupling. IL4 and IL6 are seen to be the least impacted by inter-cytokine coupling. principal component vector, y(tk), can be expressed as. (21) where C is a square matrix derived from the singular values of Z that transforms the data, z(tk), into orthogonal components. y 1(tk) is associated with the largest singular value of Z; hence, it describes the largest variability in the data set. the dendrogram reveals that TNF- and IL1 responses are close. IFN-, IL2, IL4, IL8, and IL12 are similar to each other. IL6 is in a class by itself, with slow response (Group C) the effects of inhibiting individual cytokines are revealed by solving the dynamic equation (eq. 3b) with requisite rows of A C (eq. 18) set to zero. zeroing the first two rows eliminates all effects of TNF-. IL12 does not significantly impact the other cytokines, in part because its response is an order of magnitude smaller than the others\u2019 response. the TGN1412 infusion rate is represented by u(t) and it affects cytokine propagation through the (181) matrix, B. the odd elements of B are zero, and the even elements are derived from the estimated initial rates. observed cytokine concentrations are structured-but-random variables that vary from one patient to the next. cytokine concentrations are not exposed to localized distributions within the body. errors occur in sampling and analysis. xi(tk) and i(tk) have the same units; plotting [xi(tk) i(tk)] vs. tk would produce an envelope containing 68% of probable responses if the random variables were Gaussian. initial uncertainties in IL 6 and IL10 are the slowest to decay, while those in IL12 and IFN- are the fastest. disturbance covariance, W, is taken to be a diagonal forcing matrix with zero odd elements and ones in the even terms. the cytokine standard deviations reach steady values after several days. IL6 and IL10 concentrations show the largest continuing uncertainty, while IL12 and IFN- are the lowest. cytokines are associated principally with the immune system. they also are linked to epithelial and endothelial cells, smooth muscle, and adipose tissue. cytokines are linked to epithelial and endothelial cells, smooth muscle, and adipose tissue. IL1 peaks 2\u20133 days after infusion, on a slower time scale than any of the cytokine groups. cells that secrete the subject cytokines and that are regulated by them are listed in Table 4. innate immune cells and other tissue types are underrepresented in Group B. corticosteroids, chlorpheniramine, acetaminophen, ondansetron, metaraminol, methylprednisolene, and the anti-IL2 receptor antagonist antibody could be administered safely to healthy subjects at low doses for short periods of time. cross comparisons would allow the cytokine coupling effects to be distinguished from the direct effects of the drug stimuli, in a secure, well-controlled environment. this approach could lead the way toward developing a strong theoretical basis for understanding cytokine storms. the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL8, was most likely produced by innate system cells and non-immune tissue. this paper presents a sequence of general analytical procedures that are useful for interpreting temporal biomedical data for a wide variety of systems. cytokine response profiles fall into three groups: [TNF-, IL1 and IL10], [IFN-, IL2, IL4, IL8 and IL12], and [IL6]. association of these cytokines with cellular secretion and regulation suggest adaptive immune system had a dominant effect in the cytokine storm."}
