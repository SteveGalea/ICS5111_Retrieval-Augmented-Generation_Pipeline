{"summary": "study analyzed data from the national surveillance system of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. results Approximately 44.9% (95%CI: 35.73-54.13%) of confirmed imported dengue cases with an apparent symptom (febrile) in the viremic stage were detected via the airport fever screening program. dengue viruses are some of the most significant arbovirus pathogens worldwide. the human incidence of dengue infection has increased dramatically over the past 50 years [1-4] due to the lack of an effective vaccine, exponential increases in international travel and shift in global ecology. climatic bottleneck effect suppresses dengue proliferation each year and significantly curbs outbreaks in southern Taiwan [8-10] heavy international travel in Taiwan might promote the importation of the dengue virus and viral transmission within the community. dengue is classified as a reportable infectious disease and suspected cases must be reported within 24 hours for a clinical diagnosis in Taiwan. the definition of a confirmed dengue case includes the positive detection of RNA, antigen or antibody by laboratory diagnoses. an imported dengue case was a confirmed case in which the patient had not traveled in the two weeks prior to the onset of illness. travelers with an NCIT-detected temperature of higher than 38\u00b0C were defined as confirmed fever cases. travelers who had arrived from dengue-affected areas were triaged for additional diagnostics by quarantine officers. duplicate specimens were sent to the central laboratory for confirmation. the airport fever screening program was surveyed using the positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity and specificity tests. PPV = TP/(TP + FP); NPV = TN/(FN + TN); FN: false negative, the confirmed dengue importations detected in the airports. another 10 NCITs were used for fever screening in 9 international harbors. an imported dengue case was a confirmed case in which the patient had not traveled to dengue-endemic countries in the two weeks prior to the onset of illness. the total imported dengue cases included those inbound passengers that were diagnosed as dengue-positive by airport screening. the active surveillance includes fever screening at the airport, health statements from the inbound passengers, screening for contact with confirmed cases and school-based reporting. duplicate specimens were sent to the central laboratory for confirmation. a rapid dengue diagnostic system based on serological [envelope and membrane\u2013specific capture immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [8,11] was used to confirm a dengue infection. sensitivity = TP/(TP + FN); specificity = TN/(FP + TN); TP: true positive, the confirmed dengue importations that were detected in the airports. FN: false negative, the confirmed dengue importations that were detected in the community. another 10 NCITs were used for fever screening in 9 international harbors. confirmed febrile passengers were detected by NCITs (37.5\u00b0C) followed by ear thermometers (more than 38\u00b0C) in 2 airports. from 2007\u20132010, a majority of the confirmed dengue-infected travelers were arriving from dengue-endemic regions in south or Southeast Asia. the cumulative numbers of the imported dengue cases that were detected at the airports were significantly associated with the total number of imported dengue cases. the straight line represents a fitted line by the means of a least squares regression. the 95% confidence interval of the slope is 1.42-1.94. the non-endemic status of dengue in Taiwan can be confirmed by examining the epidemiological patterns from 2007\u20132010. the monthly cumulative number of imported dengue cases had a pattern in parallel with the domestic dengue cases (Y) according to a regression test with a lead time of 1\u20133 months, the monthly cumulative number of imported dengue cases (X) had a pattern in parallel with the domestic dengue cases (Y), based on a consecutive 4-year surveillance. 68-9.19, 3.81-9.93, or 2.46-8.98.

Approximately 29.5-50.9% of confirmed febrile inbound passengers were triaged by inspectors and underwent blood sampling for laboratory confirmation. airport fever screening program % 40.22 44.44

the imported dengue cases on domestic epidemics in dengue-competent hotspots We analyzed a total of 5,823 dengue cases in Taiwan from 2007\u20132010. the domestic dengue outbreaks were clustered mainly in the metropolitan areas of Tainan and Kaohsiung. from 2007\u20132010, the percentage of the annual cumulative number of dengue cases that were importations was 37.99% in North Taiwan (Taipei, Yilan and Keelung), higher than 24.21% in southern Taiwan (Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pintung) the annual cumulative number of dengue importations reported from clinics (passive surveillance) or detected at the airports (active surveillance) were associated with the numbers of domestic cases in 2007\u20132010 among the five airport dengue screening enables mass-screening for febrile passengers. the passengers who arrive from areas of dengue outbreak are required to perform health self-management for two weeks. these measures are intended to block transmission of the virus and prevent large-scale spread of infections within the community. changes in the rate of Y (domestic cases) depended on changes in X (dengue importations) with a 95% CI that ranged from 0.57 to 9.93. variations in the lag of peak timing in local dengue epidemics may have been influenced by multiple factors, including seasonal and ecological activity of the Aedes vectors. entry screening is considered more effective at blocking transmission of SARS than other agents. afebrile patients who import viral particles with latent (not yet symptomatic), mild and asymptomatic dengue cases that bypass the NCIT represent a source of new dengue outbreaks each year. 0\u20130.9% of the dengue importations detected at the borders were introduced by boats via the 9 ports screened by NCITs from 2007\u20132010. the few cases that might have been screened under a conditional alarm temperature at 36.6\u00b0C or with alternative screening methods, such as symptom-inspecting or self-reporting, were not completely excluded in our calculation. dengue fever is one of the most frequently imported reportable diseases every year in Taiwan. this active surveillance policy provided other sentinel functions. despite the presence of devices with improved performance and affordable implementation costs, there is still a possibility for infected travelers to not be detected by screening. approximately 45% of the symptomatic dengue importations could be detected by airport quarantine. however, the other symptomatic dengue importations were latent (not yet symptomatic infections) many of the symptomatic dengue importations were not reported. nearly half of imported symptomatic dengue cases were detected at entry, i.e., 40.2% (72/179) in 2007, 44.3% (100/226) in 2008, 52.9% (108/204) in 2009 and 41.5% (126/304) in 2010. the active detection of dengue importations in airports offers the opportunity to target symptomatic dengue cases for early self-quarantine. the peak time period of domestic dengue outbreaks, with 0 to several months (t) of lag, might signal an alert for the domestic outbreaks in Taiwan. however, there are some other factors that should be taken into consideration. the incubation time of dengue is approximately two weeks. the presence of A. albopictus, a minor dengue vector accustomed to being outdoors, resulted in a limited transmission of the virus. the viremic cases of asymptomatic, mild, latent or secondary dengue infection can simultaneously or subsequently become new infectious sources. the current screening methods for symptomatic infections at entry borders are limited by a poor NCIT threshold. studies have reported a higher sensitivity of entry screening for influenza using NCITs than self-reporting at points of entry into the healthcare system. entry screening measures such as thermal scanners, health declarations or medical checks could delay the local transmission of the pandemic influenza A for approximately 7\u201312 days [16] the correlation between the annual and monthly fluctuations of the dengue importations and the domestic cases by the regression test suggests that utilizing the cumulative data might be misinterpreted at an individual level. the implications for airport screening as an epidemic control policy and the importance of reinforcing public hygiene education. despite the presence of devices with improved performance and affordable implementation costs, there is still a possibility for infected travelers to not be detected by screening. the proportion of dengue cases that are symptomatic ranges from 10-50%. the frequency of measures taken by tourists to protect against mosquito bites is less than 45%. travelers should take steps to control vector spread for at least two weeks after returning from epidemic areas to stop the spread of the virus to their neighbors and family. citizens living in areas of southern Taiwan should perform vector control interventions to reduce virus transmission and prevent people who have been infected by a certain serotype of dengue virus from being reinfected by a different serotype. a border intervention could provide an active sentinel surveillance to provide an alert for the potential magnitude of the dengue importations. authors' contributions MMK and FYC designed the research.
