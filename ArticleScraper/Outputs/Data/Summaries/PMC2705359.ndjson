{"summary": "the world health organization issued a global alert about a severe partially fatal respiratory disease named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) the virus originated in Southeast China, affected thousands and spread to many countries worldwide via international travel. in parallel, the etiologic agent turned out to be a novel coronavirus with several distinguishing features to known coronaviruses. subconfluent Huh7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding M (MN-FLAG) or a glycosylation-deficient M (MN4QN-FLAG) both N-terminally fused with a FLAG-peptide. surface-staining and subsequent intracellular staining of M was performed 24 h posttransfection (p.t.) using a polyclonal -FLAG and a fluorescence- the hydrophobic N-terminus of M containing the three transmembrane domains is sufficient to recruit the SARS-CoV spike protein S to the budding compartment suggesting protein-protein-interaction between M and S. the tmap-program predicted only two hydrophobic domains between amino acids 73\u201393 and 133\u2013150. to further characterize the membrane integration of M, we introduced a novel glycosylation site (N-X-S) in the predicted intraluminal loop between hydrophobic domains 2 and 3 of the protein. to avoid a very close proximity of the glycosylation site and the ER membrane leading to sterical limitations of the oligosaccharide transferase in the ER lumen [19], we inserted 31 hydrophilic amino acids with a central N-glycosy in vitro translation of these constructs in the presence of microsomes revealed that neither MV186N nor ML205N were glycosylated. we could for the first time provide experimental support for a Nexo-Cendo topology of SARS-CoV M with a luminal N-terminus, three transmembrane segments and a long cytosolic C-terminus. to confirm these in silico data the N-terminal N-glycosylation site ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and recombinantly expressed MN4Q revealed a strong colocalization suggesting that the MN4Q as well as wild type M accumulates in the budding compartment ERGIC. N-glycosylation of coronviral M was aligned and depicted using MacVector program. the serum recognized the structural components spike- (S) and nucleocapsid- (N) protein in cell lysates of wt and mutant recSARS-CoV infected Vero-cells. the serum recognized the structural components spike- (S) and nucleocapsid- (N) protein in cell lysates of wt and mutant recSARS-CoV infected vero-cells. wt recSARS-CoV and mutant recSARS-CoV were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto PVDF membranes. the membrane was incubated with a serum of an immunized rabbit or with the human monoclonal antibody S30. at 24 h p.i., viral particles were fixed, negatively stained and subjected to electron microscopic analysis. both recombinant viruses possessed a delayed viral replication in infected Vero cells compared to wt rec SARS-CoV. Previously, we could identify the M-specific antibody S30 synthesized by Epstein Barr virus-immortalized B-lymphocytes of a SARS convalescent [21]. a FLAG-epitope was fused to the C-terminus or in addition to the N-terminus. M1\u2013134 was in vitro translated in the presence of [35S] PROMIX. the precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. the hydrophobic N-terminus of M is sufficient to recruit M in the Golgi-complex and to retain S in perinuclear regions M is concentrated in the Golgi-complex. recombinant expression of M1\u2013134 showed strong colocalization with Golgi-marker. in presence of M, S was recruited to cellular compartments where SARS-CoV budding takes place. coexpression with at least the first 134 amino acids of M induced redistribution of surface protein S to the perinuclear region. three in four algorithms predicted three transmembrane helices at similar positions. but the tmap-program predicted only two hydrophobic domains between amino acids 73\u201393 and 133\u2013150. further in silico analyses also differ in the prediction of the topology of the N- and the C-terminus of M. expression of MInsert resulted in three protein bands (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 4) which could be attributed to non-, mono- and di-glycosylated forms of M. endo H digestion revealed that the upper band was glycosylated suggesting that the two forms correspond to non- and monoglycosylated MN4Q Insert. Suppressed N-glycosylation of M does not impair protein accumulation in the Golgi complex nor the assembly and infectivity of a recombinant SARS-CoV Amino acid sequence alignments. to confirm these in silico data the N-terminal N-glycosylation site of the homologue protein of another human pathogenic coronavirus, HCoV-NL63, was mutated. this led to the loss of glycosylation completely mutant mutant MN3Q of HCoV-NL63 were transfected with plasmid encoding the glycosylation-deficient M (MN4QN-FLAG) using FuGENE according to manufacturer's protocol. at 24 h p.t, cells were fixed, permeabilized and incubated with a polyclonal -FLAG antibody and a rhodamine-coupled secondary antibody. wt and mutant recSARS-CoV expressing a glycosylation-deficient form of M were infected. virions were infected with wild type recombinant SARS-CoV (wt rec SARS-CoV) or mutant MN4Q recombinant SARS-CoV (MN4Q rec SARS-CoV) with an moi of 3 pfu per cell. wt recSARS-CoV (blue bars) and wt recSARS-CoV (red bars) exhibited 106-fold increase in viral genomes copies within 18 h p.i. infection with both viruses resulted in a 10-fold reduction of released genome copies early in infection compared to wt rec SARS-CoV. FLAG-tagged mutants of M were constructed which carried small truncations in the absolute C-terminus of M. mutants were expressed in BHK-T7 cells and employed in immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analysis. mutants migrated slightly slower than mutant consisting of 201 amino acids. cells were transfected with plasmids encoding various C-terminally truncated mutants. at 24 h p.t., cells were lysed, sonicated and directly subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Huh7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding M or M1\u2013134. at 24 h p.t., cells were fixed, permeabilized and incubated with a polyclonal -FLAG and a monoclonal -Giantin antibody. recombinant spike protein S was transported to the plasma membrane upon single expression. surface protein S to the perinuclear region is consistent with the idea that M recruited S to site of assembly and budding of SARS-CoV. at 24 h p.t., cells were fixed, permeabilized and viral proteins were stained with a rabbit polyclonal -S serum. the topology of the hydrophobic stretches in M was determined using artificially incorporated N-glycosylation sites postulating the presence of three transmembrane domains. the topology is different to other coronaviruses e.g. the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV M) [15]. Detailed analyses revealed that accumulation of M beyond the budding compartment in the Golgi-complex is a common feature of all investigated coronaviruses [11,17,29-31]. in this study we observed that N-glycosylation had no impact on the intracellular distribution of recombinant SARS-CoV M. a retention signal located at the cytosolic C-terminus of most coronaviral S proteins prevents surface expression of S. a retention signal located at the cytosolic C-terminus of most coronaviral S proteins prevents surface expression of S. the question arose whether interaction with other viral proteins supported retention of S. the first 134 amino acids of SARS-CoV M comprise the three transmembrane domains are crucial for accumulation of M in the Golgi-complex. similar findings have been reported for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which suggested retention signals in the first transmembrane domain of M [25]. glycosylation of MHV M is dispensable for assembly and spread of the virus. previous studies on TGEV revealed an influence of glycosylation of M on interferon induction. a retention signal located at the cytosolic C-terminus prevents surface expression of S. N-terminus of M is neither essential for transport and topology of M nor for its function in replication of recombinant SARS-CoV. further in vivo studies using generated N-glycosylation-deficient SARS-CoV are necessary to elucidate the role of conserved N-glycosylation during immune response of the infected host. a fragment encoding a stretch of 31 hydrophilic amino acids with a central N-glycosylation site was amplified using the partially complementary oligonucleotides 5'-TACGCATACAACCGCTACCGTATTGGAAACTATAATAATACAACTATTAAGGACCTGGACTACAAGGAC-3' and 5'-CTCTTTTGGCTTGTCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCAT Molecular Cloning of M Truncation Mutants DNA fragments encoding the C-terminally truncated M mutants were generated by PCR with pTM1-M as template. all constructs were verified by restriction analysis and sequencing. the fragments were cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI cleavage sites of pTM1. the fragments were cloned into the cleavage sites of pTM1. subconfluent Huh7 cells were co-transfected with pTM1-MC-FLAG or pTM1-M1\u2013134 and pcDNA.3.1-S. a plasmid was cotransfected encoding the T7 DNA-dependent RNA-polymerase supporting the expression of the M mutants. the full-length BAC-constructs were linearized, in vitro transcribed and electroporated in BHK-21 cells using GenePulser (Biorad) the full-length BAC-constructs were linearized, in vitro transcribed and electroporated in BHK-21 cells using GenePulser (Biorad) cells and Viruses BSR T7/5 cells (BHK-21 cell clone) were cultured as described earlier. monolayer cultures of the human hepatoma cell line Huh7 and the African green monkey kidney cell line Vero were grown at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. a fragment encoding a stretch of 31 hydrophilic amino acids with a central N-glycosylation site was amplified. a fragment encoding a stretch of 31 hydrophilic amino acids with a central N-glycosylation site was amplified. the three resulting PCR fragments were fused by recombinant PCR leading to pTM1 vector.
