{"summary": "translation is suspected to be the key step where errors may occur. the ribosome has developed several mechanisms to allow proper translocation of the tRNAs in the different sites. programmed frameshifting (PRF) are the most frequently found signals. tampering with accuracy of the P. anserina cytosolic translation apparatus results in impaired development [12], [13]. Especially, decreasing the error rate triggers abnormal ascospore formation [14], [15] and the development of an epigenetic cell degeneration mechanism known as Crippled Growth [16]. the mus51::su8\u20131 strain lacking the mus-51 subunit of the complex involved in end-joining of broken DNA fragments was described previously [25]. standard culture conditions, media and genetic methods for P. anserina have been described. a sequence consisting of the IBV slippery site out-of frame with the IBV spacer sequence and the P. anserina pseudoknot were also cloned into the pAC MscI site. the -galactosidase and firefly luciferase activities were quantified in the same crude extract as described previously. two primers contain sites for restriction enzymes to help in cloning. the plasmid recovered was linearized with HindIII and introduced into the P. anserina mus51::su8\u20131 strain by transformation. the pPaYIP3+ plasmid was then introduced by transformation into the PaYIP3 mutant. 19 transformants, all with a wild-type phenotype, were recovered. two were selected for further studies and crossed with wild-type. the pBC-phleo vector was cloned into the pBC-phleo vector. the pPaYIP3T plasmid was then introduced by transformation into the PaYIP3 mutant. three transformants were selected for further studies and crossed with wild-type. peGFP-hygro contains the hygromycin B resistance gene from pBC-hygro. the pYIP3C-GFP vector was constructed by cloning a 2 kb fragment of the PaYIP3 gene. to this end, two PCR-fragments corresponding to the 5\u2032 ORF (860 bp) and the 5\u2032-end of the 3\u2032 ORF (1208 bp) were amplified. 69 bp fragment of the 5\u2032 ORF was PCR-amplified using the orf5\u2032w-sal1 and the orf5\u2032c-sma1 (5\u2032-AGACCCGCGGGCCCCCCCGGAAAAAGCCTC-3\u2032) oligonucleotides. all constructs were verified by sequencing and then transformed into the mus51::su8-1 strain. trees were constructed using PhyML [33] with the default parameters [34] and 100 bootstrapped data sets. the latest genome sequence and EST derived from the S strain are available at http://podospora.igmors.u-psud.fr. -galactosidase and firefly luciferase activities were quantified in the same crude extract as previously described. -galactosidase and firefly luciferase activities were quantified in the same crude extract as described previously. ly luciferase/galactosidase ratio obtained from the 1 frameshift construct by the same ratio obtained with the in-frame control construct [30]. deletion of PaYIP3 PaYIP3 was inactivated by replacing the PaYIP3 CDS with a hygromycin B-resistance marker. paYIP3 mutant was amplified by PCR using the Phusion\u00ae high-fidelity DNA polymerase, P. anserina wild-type genomic DNA and primers 8470DF and 8470GR. the pPaYIP3+ plasmid was then introduced by transformation into the paYIP3 mutant. twenty-six transformants, all with a wild-type phenotype, were recovered. the insert proved that no mutation occurred in PaYIP3C during amplification and cloning. the pPaYIP3C plasmid was then introduced by transformation into the PaYIP3 mutant. peGFP-hygro contains the hygromycin B resistance gene from pBC-hygro. the fragment was cloned into the BglII and SmaI sites of the peGFP-hygro vector. the fragment was cloned into the BglII and SmaI sites of the peGFP-hygro vector. phase-c oligonucleotides are complementary and contain the slippery sequence (indicated in italic) of the 1 frameshifting site. both fragments were PCR-joined, SalI- and SmaI-digested and cloned into the correspondingly digested peGFP-hygro vector. void of the mus51::su8-1 were selected for observation. western blot analysis used anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies for the detection of GFP-fusion proteins. analysis of 12 independent cDNAs obtained during the genome sequencing project showed that the mRNA sequence was identical to that of the gene except for a 173 bp intron located in the 5\u2032 untranslated region [21]. this indicates that the putative frameshift is not corrected by either RNA editing or splicing and thus it had to occur during translation. however, examination of the PaYIP3 sequence suggested that frameshifting could happen at codon n\u00b0 170. the -1 frameshift of PaYIP3 has been conserved during the evolution of Pezizomycotina. the availability of additional fungal genome sequences now makes it possible to refine the phylogenetic analysis. the UUUU slippery sequence and the pseudoknot were conserved in Grosmania clavigera, the Ophiostomatales. the sequence was changed to UUUCU and only a small stem loop could be predicted in the case of mycosphaerella graminicola, a Capnodiales. this could indicate that a single tRNA slippage would occur. the hue shows sequence conservation of the base pair. conservative changes compared to the P. anserina structures are in green and non-conservative changes in red. perithecia from mat+/mat heterokaryotic mutant cultures yielded ascospores half a day before wild-type cultures. when grown on a medium with wood shavings as sole carbon source, fertility of the mutant was diminished and fewer ascospores were produced. however, growth with whatman paper as carbon source was only marginally modified in the mutant. ring formation on M2 medium; (B) ascospore production on wood shaving medium. mutant was also transformed with truncated and corrected alleles of the PaYIP3 gene. genetic crosses strains carrying both the corrected and truncated alleles of paYIP3 exhibited the same phenotypes as those expressing the truncated allele alone. this indicates that co-expression of both forms is not sufficient to recover a wild-type phenotype. we constructed plasmids carrying chimaeric versions of the wild-type, truncated and corrected alleles by adding in frame the eGFP CDS at a complete copy of the CDS is still present in the genome downstream of the tagged gene. the strains carrying the PaYIP3+-GFP gene have a wild type phenotype. those carrying the PaYIP3C-GFP gene have the PaYIP3 mutant phenotype. paYIP3+-GFP and paYIP3C-GFP transgenes grew and presented a ring of perithecia as did the wild-type strain, while those carrying PaYIP3C-GFP were similar to the paYIP3 mutant. the phenotype of paYIP3C-GFP resulted from lack of activity of the remaining downstream wild-type CDS or to a dominant negative effect of the paYIP3C-GFP copy a clear expression of the wild-type fusion PaYIP3+-GFP protein in the hyphae confirms that the recoded form is efficiently expressed in vivo in the host. the corrected in-frame form is more difficult to observe in the hyphae, as expected if it is present in lower amounts. the mRNA of the P. anserina PaYIP3 gene overlaps two open reading frames (ORFs) the small one located at the 5\u2032 end of the messenger is similar to the S. cerevisiae YIP3 gene (YNL044W), while the larger one at the 3\u2032 end is not present in this yeast. analysis of 12 independent cDNAs obtained during the genome sequencing project showed that the mRNA sequence was identical to that of the gene except for a 173 bp intron located in the 5\u2032 untranslated region [21]. this indicates that the putative frameshift is not corrected by either RNA editing or splicing and thus it had to occur during translation. however, examination of the PaYIP3 sequence suggested that frameshifting could happen at codon n\u00b0 170. yIP3 -1 frameshifting motif conserved during evolution of Pezizomycotina. phylogenetic trees were constructed. yIP3 is encoded by a single gene. a single appearance of the 3\u2032 ORFs (species in black) of YIP3 was mapped on the most probable phylogenetic tree of the Eumycota [43], [46]. the most parsimonious scenario of evolution is a single appearance of the 3\u2032 ORF after the split of the Orbiliomycetes from the other Pezizomycotina (slanted arrow) compatible base pairs are colored according to the number of different types C-G, G-C, A-U, U-A, G-U or U-G of compatible base pairs. the saturation decreases with the number of incompatible base pairs indicating structural conservation of the base pair. the wild-type produced perithecia mainly as a 1 cm-thick ring with an internal diameter of 1 cm. in the mutant the ring was 0.7 cm thick and its internal diameter was 0.7 cm. perithecia from mat+/mat heterokaryotic mutant cultures yielded ascospores half a day before wild-type cultures. complemented strains formed a wild-type ring of perithecia and produced ascospores as wild-type on wood shaving medium. the mutant was also transformed with truncated and corrected alleles of the PaYIP3 gene. modified repartition of perithecia and diminished fertility on wood shaving medium results mostly in non-homologous insertion. variation in the complementation observed with the truncated allele could be explained by influence of the insertion point on the expression of the transgene. a complete copy of the CDS is still present in the genome downstream of the tagged gene. the strains carrying the PaYIP3+-GFP gene have a wild type phenotype. those carrying the PaYIP3C-GFP gene have the PaYIP3 mutant phenotype. a doublet of bands was detected at 45 kDa for PaYIP3T-GFP and 88 kDa for PaYIP3+-GFP and PaYIP3C-GFP. these sizes are expected for the fusion proteins, showing that they were actually produced in P. anserina. when analyzed on M2, the strains carrying the PaYIP3+-GFP and PaYIP3T-GFP transgenes grew and presented a ectopic PaYIP3C-GFP is not functional and the downstream copy of the gene is actually inactive despite having the complete PaYIP3 CDS. the corrected in-frame form (PaYIP3C-GFP) is more difficult to observe in the hyphae. blot as the small peptide is not tagged with GFP in the PaYIP3+-GFP construct. the longer form could be unstable due to the weak intensity of the band. the recoding sequence was inserted between the -galactosidase and firefly luciferase. the two ORFs can be expressed in Pezizomycotina as a single polypeptide. the 3\u2032 ORF is less conserved and present only in Pezizomycotina. a fusion protein corresponding to the translation of the two ORFs is found in vivo. we cannot rule out that the slight increase observed with the 2 nt spacer is significant. this suggests that the PaYIP3 pseudoknot may slightly improve basal frameshifting of the IBV slippery sequence when positioned 2 nt downstream. this suggests that the frameshifting event does not occur by a dual tRNA slippage as for IBV but more likely by a single P-tRNA slippage. mutagenesis of Edr frameshifting supports a tandem tRNA slippage model. the bulge found in Edr pseudoknot does not play any role in frameshifting. the situation could be very different for PaYIP3 frameshifting as a trans-acting factor could bind this pseudoknot to stimulate frameshifting. expression of the 19.5 kDa alone can restore a wild-type phenotype. however, expression of the 61.6 kDa polypeptide alone is unable to restore a wild-type phenotype. expression of the 61.6 kDa polypeptide alone is unable to restore a wild-type phenotype, indicating that it is inactive. expression of the 19.5 kD and 61.6 kD forms may need to be present in defined ratio to observe an effect. another possibility would be that doing an error during translation rather than producing two different polypeptides is important. this could allow spatial or temporal regulation of PaYIP3. phylogenetic pattern of the C-terminal extension would be its origin after the split of the Orbiliomycetes from the other Pezizomycotina and its removal from the ancestors of A. apis due to their parasitic lifestyle. this split likely occurred more than 400 million years ago.
