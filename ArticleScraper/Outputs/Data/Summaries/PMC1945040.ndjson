{"summary": "positive-strand RNA viruses replicate their genomes on intracellular membranes. a common feature of (+)RNA virus replication is the association of their RNA replication complexes with infection-specific host intracellular membrane rearrangements. RNA replication occurs in association with 50\u201370-nm diameter membranous vesicles or spherules that form in the lumen of specific secretory compartments or organelles. a fraction of such spherules have interiors that appear to be connected to the cytoplasm by membranous necks [15,25,28]. FHV has a 4.5-kb bipartite RNA genome in which RNA2 (1.4 kb) encodes the capsid precursor [47], whereas RNA1 (3.1 kb) encodes an RNA silencing inhibitor [48,49] and a multifunctional RNA replication factor, protein A [40,50,51]. protein A behaves as an integral transmembrane protein [38] spherules are compartments or mini-organelles for viral RNA synthesis. each spherule contains, on average, 100 membrane-spanning, self-interacting protein A molecules. results define new level of understanding of nature, structure, and organization of a viral RNA replication complex. EM with this protein A monoclonal antibody revealed nearly all protein A was in or on mitochondrial spherules in FHV-infected cells. over 900 gold particles in 25 different electron micrographs were counted and 88% 5% of the specific gold labeling density above background was associated with spherules. the remaining 10% 5% of immunogold label was associated with mitochondria. white arrowheads indicate gold particles at a mitochondrial membrane but not directly over a spherule. black arrowheads indicate gold particles in the cytoplasm. islands of cytoplasm surrounded by a mitochondrial ring are seen frequently in EM sections of FHV-infected mitochondria. of 221 gold particles examined, 70% 18% were on spherules. spherules may include mature RNA products released from spherules. background labeling levels were independent of the addition or omission of BrUTP. arrowheads and labeling of mitochondria, spherules, and cytoplasm are as in Figure 1. the primary-secondary antibody complex linking the gold particles to their target epitopes may span up to 20 nm. the 3-D nature of EMT overcomes many serious limitations of 2-D EM analysis. five independent reconstructions were generated using a single-tilt series technique. one reconstruction was performed using a double tilt technique. labels denote outer mitochondrial membrane (OM) and inner mitochondrial membrane (IM) spherules are necked invaginations of the outer mitochondrial membrane. some spherules appear to be light bulb\u2013shaped invaginations. others appear to be free vesicles in intermembrane space. a given spherule appears to be a free vesicle simply represent planes that did not pass through the smaller diameter neck linking the spherule membrane to the mitochondrial outer membrane. this is illustrated more dynamically in video S1 which animates the progression through a z-series of sections of the tomogram of Figure 3A and 3B. we used a computer-generated mesh overlay to join these tracings into continuous surfaces. for clarity, the cytoplasmic faces of outer mitochondrial membranes are colored blue, spherule membranes are white, and inner mitochondrial membranes are yellow. the spherule membranes (white) are continuous with the outer mitochondrial membrane (blue) the outer membrane (blue) rendered translucent to reveal the spherules beneath. the necked channels connecting the interior of each spherule to the cytoplasm (red arrowhead) are clearly visible as circular openings in the outer membrane. interior volume and membrane surface area of 175 spherules spanned a range of 15,000 to 50,000 nm3. average interior spherule interior volume was 33,000 nm3. average interior spherule membrane surface area was 6,000 nm2. RNA corresponding to 1.0 105, 1.0 104, or 1.0 103 cell equivalents was loaded as indicated above each lane and subjected to Northern blot hybridization with radio-labeled probes specific for the detection of (+)RNA1 (top panel of A), ()RNA1 (top panel of B), (+)RNA2 (bottom panel of A) or ()RNA2 (bottom panel of B) Specific signals are indicated by the arrowheads. molecules of each RNA species at 4 hpi to 2\u20133 million each by 24 hpi. such (+)RNA products primarily accumulate in the cytoplasm for translation and encapsidation. only a minor fraction of (+)RNAs fractionate with membrane-associated RNA replication complex. every mature RNA replication complex, active in (+)RNA synthesis, must contain at least one ()RNA template. the number of spherules per cell was calculated by multiplying the density of spherules by the average volume of the almost perfectly round, 10 m-diameter Drosophila S2 cells. on average there are 100 copies of protein A per spherule (Table 1). prior immunofluorescence and immunogold labeling EM localized protein A to the outer mitochondrial membrane in FHV-infected cells. however, fixation conditions needed to preserve spherule ultrastructure abolished protein A antigenicity for the polyclonal antibody used, hence blocking protein A localization relative to spherules. cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde. cells were postfixed in 0.1% osmium, dehydrated and embedded in LR Gold resin. white arrowheads indicate gold particles at a mitochondrial membrane. black arrowheads indicate gold particles in the cytoplasm. we incubated mitochondria isolated from uninfected and FHV-infected Drosophila cells with a nucleotide mix including 5-bromouridine 5'-triphosphate (BrUTP) we performed immunogold labeling EM with an antibody recognizing BrU incorporated into RNA, but not unincorporated BrUTP. Isolated mitochondria were incubated for 1 h at 28 \u00b0C with a transcription mix that included BrUTP. spherules were the sites of protein A accumulation and FHV RNA synthesis. a tilt series of 60 images was collected by rotating a 250-nm-thick section of resin-embedded sample in 2 \u00b0 increments between 60 \u00b0 to +60 \u00b0 relative to the plane perpendicular to the beam. one reconstruction was performed using a double tilt technique to improve tomographic resolution further. nm channel connecting a representative spherule interior to the cytoplasm. spherules that appear to be connected to the outer mitochondrial membrane in (C) appear as a vesicle packet in (D) spherules that appear to be connected to the outer mitochondrial membrane appear as a vesicle packet in (D) all 500 spherules in all 8 FHV-modified mitochondria examined were found to be connected to the outer mitochondrial membrane by a membranous neck. the red arrowhead in Figure 3A points to a channel through the spherule neck that connects the interior of a spherule to the cytoplasm. sections in which a given spherule appears to be a free vesicle simply represent planes that some apparently distinct membrane rearrangements and vesicle structures observed in connection with RNA replication by different (+)RNA viruses may represent related structures distinguished in part by the perspective from which they were viewed. we manually traced the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes (including spherules) over 100 adjacent, 2.2-nm-spaced virtual sections of selected tomographic reconstructions. the outer membrane has been made translucent to show the spherules behind it. the red arrow corresponds to the red arrows in Figure 3A and 4B. 3-D maps of the mitochondria shown in Figure 3C. the data shown represents measurements of 150 (A) and 175 (B and C) individual spherules. surface-rendered maps of the two mitochondria from Figure 3C are shown in Figure 4D, illustrating also the inner mitochondrial membrane (yellow) strand genomic RNAs per cell were measured by quantitative Western blotting calibrated with known amounts of in vitro transcripts. the number of protein A molecules per cell was measured by quantitative Western blotting calibrated with known amounts of co-electrophoresed, purified protein A standards. the 24 hpi data shown for 4, 8, and 12 hpi represent the mean and standard deviation for two independent experiments. the primary mode of viral RNA synthesis is (+)RNA synthesis from negative-strand RNA [()RNA] templates. the number of (+)RNA1 and (+)RNA2 per cell increased from 40,000 molecules of each RNA species at 4 hpi to 2\u20133 million each by 24 hpi. intriguingly, the peak level of protein A was 2 million molecules per cell. protein A was thus present at dramatically higher levels than () RNA templates were. the ratio of protein A to ()RNAs was relatively consistent over all time points examined. on average there are 1 ()RNA1 and 2 ()RNA2 molecules per spherule (Table 1). implications of these results for the organization of replication complexes are considered further in the Discussion. protein A must line the interior membrane surface of spherules. if protein A is similar to typical globular proteins, its volume would be 183 nm3. the average spherule interior membrane surface area of 6,000 nm2 provides enough space to accommodate at most 150 protein A molecules. protein A (ptn A; green spheres) forms a shell within the mitochondrial membrane spherule within which RNA synthesis occurs. a small fraction of protein A may reside on the outer mitochondrial membrane external to spherules. a shell of these dimensions appears reasonable, given that the main shell of a reovirus core is 60 nm in diameter. one species of Ty retrotransposon forms virus-like capsids. capsids contain on average 300 copies of a 381\u2013amino acid protein subunit. dsRNA localization may allow the virus to avoid, minimize, or delay dsRNA-induced host\u2013cell defense responses. the 100 protein A molecules per spherule (Table 1) would consume 18,300 nm3 of interior volume. the volumes of FHV RNA1, RNA2 and RNA3 would be 2035, 917, and 254 nm3 respectively. a spherule of average size has enough interior space to contain at least four single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) or two dsRNA copies of all three RNA species. if RNA1 and RNA2 were together in the same spherule then each spherule would hold on average three replication intermediates (one RNA1 and two RNA2) the possibility of spherules containing both species of RNAs is intriguing considering the interactions of FHV RNAs required for replication. hepatitis c virus replication protein 1a is a strongly membrane-associated [71], self-interacting [72,73] protein that is present at high copy number per spherule [15], a strongly membrane-associated [71], self-interacting [72,73] protein that is present at high copy number per spherule [15], whereas other (+)RNA viruses induce various, apparently distinct membrane rearrangements. the high copy of protein A per spherule suggests there may be threshold effects in replication protein expression to initiate replication. further analysis of the structure, interactions, and function of FHV RNA replication complexes should provide additional insights into the basic mechanisms of (+)RNA virus replication and potentially identify new approaches for antiviral interference. a small fraction of protein A may reside on the outer mitochondrial membrane external to spherules. as in Figure 4, the spherule membrane is white and the contiguous outer mitochondrial membrane is blue. the nature of protein A as a transmembrane protein imply that the 100 copies of protein A form an inner network or shell within the spherule. such a shell would explain the formation and maintenance of the high-energy membrane deformation of spherules. a spherule of average size has enough interior space to contain at least four single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) or two dsRNA copies of all three FHV RNA species. a spherule of average size has enough interior space to contain at least four single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) or two dsRNA copies of all three RNA species. if RNA1 and RNA2 were in separate spherules then the ratios of ()RNA1 and ()RNA2 to total spherules imply each spherule would have two replication intermediates. each spherule would hold on average three replication intermediates (one RNA1 and two RNA2). both BMV and FHV induce spherules of similar dimensions where viral RNA synthesis and viral replication proteins are localized [15], but the known characteristics of BMV RNA replication complexes are strikingly similar to those for FHV. analysis of structure, interactions, and function of RNA replication complexes should provide additional insights into the basic mechanisms of (+)RNA virus replication and potentially identify new approaches for antiviral interference. cells were plated onto tissue culture dish and further incubated at 28 \u00b0C. cells were recovered by scraping and centrifugation and resuspended in hypotonic buffer. cells were lysed for 7 min using a pre-chilled Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. tonic buffer containing 0.25 M mannitol washed by a second centrifugation at 7000g. cells were treated with 20 g/ml actinomycin D for 30 min. cells were infected with FHV as above. solution containing 100 mM phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4 and 0.1% BSA-c (Aurion) grids were washed six times in incubation solution without antibody, then incubated for 2 h with a goat-anti-mouse antibody conjugated to an ultrasmall gold particle. labeling density was determined by subtracting the background labeling density. to further purify protein A, we performed electrophoresis using a bioRad mini-prep cell. a 6%, 9.5-cm gel was run at 200 V for 9 h with an elution speed of 150 l/min. the effective section thickness was 116 nm, based on adding 23 nm to each face of the 70-nm section. the number of spherules per cell was calculated by multiplying the resulting density by the average volume of the almost perfectly round, 10 m-diameter Drosophila S2 cells. the single-tilt series were recorded at 40,000 magnification with an angular increment of 2 \u00b0 from 60 \u00b0 to +60 \u00b0 about an axis perpendicular to the optical axis of the microscope. the IMOD software suite was used for fiducial mark tracking and alignment. mitochondrial reconstructions were visualized using Analyze (Mayo Foundation, Rochester, MN, United States), ImageJ (National Institutes of Health), or the surface-rendering graphics of Synu (National Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research, San Diego, CA, United States) these programs allow one to step through slices of the reconstruction in any orientation and to track or model features of interest in three dimensions. cells were lysed for 7 min using a pre-chilled homogenizer fitted with a Teflon pestle. the lysate was transferred to a homogenizer fitted with a type B glass pestle. lysate was disrupted manually for 100 strokes on ice. diluted 10-fold in phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4. mixed with BrUTP and actinomycin D to final concentrations of 10 mM and 20 g/ml. cells were moved to 28 \u00b0C for a 15-min labeling period. protein A immunogold EM was performed in the same manner using mouse monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:100. labeling density was determined by calculating surface area of spherules, mitochondria, and cytoplasm using the point-hit method. cells were fixed in 2% parafomaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide with 0.8% potassium ferrocyanide in sodium cacodylate buffer. we then counted all observable spherules with diameters larger than 20 nm. the effective section thickness is a correction used to avoid overcounting s the number of spherules per cell was calculated by multiplying the density of spherules by the average volume of the almost perfectly round, 10 m-diameter Drosophila S2 cells. three separate FHV infections produced samples for six independent tomograms. the single-tilt series were recorded at 40,000 magnification with an angular increment of 2 \u00b0 from 60 \u00b0 to +60 \u00b0 about an axis perpendicular to the optical axis of the microscope. the pixel resolution was 0.55 nm. the illumination was held to near parallel beam conditions and optical density maintained constant by varying the exposure time. some 3-D maps, images, and videos were created using the software Amira (Mercury TGS; http://www.tgs.com). z-Series Animation Illustrating the Varied Appearance of Spherule Clusters when Sectioned Parallel and Perpendicular to the Axes through
