{"summary": "effective emergency preparedness is more likely to be achieved if an all-hazards response plan is adopted. the findings support the adoption of an all-hazards approach to emergency preparedness. the all-hazards approach contends that emergency preparedness requires attention not just to specific types of hazards but also to actions that increase preparedness for all risks. despite lessons learned from disasters, increase in knowledge, and technological development, no shift in policy has been made with regard to crisis management [12]. all hospitals are instructed to utilize similar principles in preparing for MCEs, mass toxicological events (MTEs) and biological events, and modify only components that are hazard-specific such as utilizing isolation facilities in biological events. main components that are implemented as result of this policy include designation of similar admitting sites in different scenarios. the aim of this study was to investigate implementation of the all-hazards approach in order to identify: 1) if preparedness of hospitals to a specific emergency scenario relates to preparedness for other types of emergencies; 2) relationships between specific components to the overall preparedness for various emergencies. the 490 parameters, encompassing the various components of emergency preparedness, were classified into the following four categories. each hospital is required to develop its own SOP for the various hazards. 80% of the surgical staff reinforcing the emergency department are graduates of an ATLS course. department's nursing staff passed a toxicological test with scores >90 Biological event. a random sample of approximately 30 physicians and nurses in each of the hospitals was given 56 standardized oral questions. a random sample of approximately 30 physicians and nurses in each of the hospitals was given 56 standardized oral questions. the score was calculated by multiplying the level of performance identified for each parameter by the relative value of the parameter. each Level A parameter was worth 0.57% of the overall score; each Level B parameter was worth 0.17%; and each Level C was worth 0.05% of the overall score. 67, 78, and 106 parameters were included in the evaluation tool. only parameters agreed upon by over 60% of the experts were included. the evaluation tool was tested in a pilot study conducted in two hospitals. hospital identified a decontamination team that will be deployed to the immediate site Biological event The biological SOP includes a section regarding treatment of medical bio-hazard waste 2 Training & drills Mass casualty event 80% of the surgical staff reinforcing the emergency department are graduates of an ATLS course Mass toxicological event 70% of the emergency department staff participated in a designated mass toxicological event training program Biological event The \"nurse in charge\" is proficient in using the public address system Mass toxicological event More than the level of emergency preparedness was evaluated in 24 general hospitals in Israel. each component was evaluated by at least two raters independently. each component was evaluated by at least two raters, independently. correlation coefficients were defined as follows: rho = 0.25\u20130.44 \u2013 weak correlation; rho = 0.45\u20130.60 \u2013 moderate correlation; rho 0.61\u20130.80 \u2013 strong correlation. each level of correlation is regarded as statistically meaningful if p 0.05. for biological event rho =.436 rho =.480 rho =.854 p =.048 p =.028 p =.000 Training/Drills Training & drills for MCE rho =.702 rho =.572 p =.000 p =.012 p =.007 Training & drills for MTE rho =.519 rho =.844 preparedness of SOPs for biological events strongly correlated with preparedness for a biological event, but did not correlate with preparedness for other emergency scenarios. training and drills A strong to very strong relationship was found between training and drills and the total preparedness score for the emergency scenarios. between MCE and a biological event (.548, p = 0.006) and between MCE and a biological event (.458, p =.032) Relationships between categories to total hospital preparedness score for the various emergency scenarios Table 2 presents the correlation between preparedness of specific categories for each scenario. CE rho =.650 rho =.619 rho =.533 p =.001 p =.003 p =.013 Knowledge of personnel for biological events rho =.439 p >.05 p >.05 p =.047 Infrastructure Infrastructure & equipment for MCE p >.05 p >.05 p >.05 p >.05 p >.05 Infrastructure & equipment for biological events rh knowledge of healthcare personnel regarding a biological event correlated only with preparedness for an MCE. infrastructure and equipment for MTE was strongly related with preparedness for both MCE and biological events. a moderate relationship was found between infrastructure and equipment for a biological event and preparedness for both MCE and biological events. the relationship between knowledge related to MCE and preparedness for different types of scenarios would seem to suggest that there is a common hub of knowledge relevant to various emergency scenarios. the principles for managing an MCE seem to serve as the basis for other types of emergency preparedness programs. without the preparation of an SOP, provision of knowledge and capabilities to healthcare personnel, effective training, and drills, it is not possible for a hospital to achieve emergency preparedness. a well-trained and experienced hospital staff may need to rely less on an SOP when dealing with a familiar emergency scenario. in uncommon emergency scenarios, when roles and expectations are less well known, a well-developed SOP is vital. the principles for managing an MCE seem to serve as the basis for other types of emergency preparedness programs. findings of this study present the relationship between preparedness for different types of emergencies. there are fundamental critical building blocks such as SOPs, training, and drills programs that improve preparedness for different types of emergencies more than other building blocks. RC analyzed the data, edited the manuscript and reviewed it. DL was instrumental in conducting the study."}
