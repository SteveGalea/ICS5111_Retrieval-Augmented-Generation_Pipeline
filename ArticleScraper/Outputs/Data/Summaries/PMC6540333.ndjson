{"summary": "IBV is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Gammacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae. it can infect the respiratory and urogenital systems in growing chickens, causing high mortality, slowing down growth, and reducing egg production in the flock. in Taiwan, IBV first appeared in 1958, and the disease has occurred frequently. monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are widely used in the field and research as a reliably powerful tool for grouping and differentiating virus serotypes. mAbs specific to Taiwan IBV strains have been used in a serum blocking ELISA. these methods are costly and time consuming, requiring skilled technicians to perform respective procedures in an equipped laboratory. the cross-reactivity of mAbs against IBV strains was assessed through Western blot. of the five mAbs, 2296-4 was observed to interact with the spike protein subunit (approximately 90 kDa) of IBVs. each point represented the absorbance at OD 580 nm. the lower OD of the mAb-gold conjugate indicates the dispersed gold nanoparticle distribution in the solution. the lowest OD value corresponded with a mAb concentration of 15 g/mL and a colloidal gold solution at pH 8. the ICS indicated high specificity in IBV antigen detection. the cross-reactive detection against different strains of the IBV was evaluated. the detection limit against the IBVs was evaluated. IBV Genotype Detection Limit (EID50) 2575/98 TW-I 104.4 2296/95 TW-II 104.8 2992/02 Variant 104.8 H120 Mass 104.6 2.4. a total of 18 throat and cloacal swab samples were collected from IBV 2992/02-infected chickens at one, three and five days post-infection. cross-reactivity of mAbs against IBV strains was assessed through Western blot. of the five mAbs, 2296-4 was observed to interact with the spike protein subunit (approximately 90 kDa) of IBVs. four other mAbs recognized the N protein (approximately 45 kDa) of the three IBVs. the lower OD of the mAb-gold conjugate indicates the dispersed gold nanoparticle distribution in the solution as small particles have higher light transmittance. the lowest OD value corresponded with a mAb concentration of 15 g/mL and a colloidal gold solution at pH 8. the ICS indicated high specificity in IBV antigen detection. results showed that the ICS was capable of detecting numerous IBV genotypes, including TW-I, TW-II, Mass, and the TW-China variant. IBV Genotype Detection Limit (EID50) 2575/98 TW-I 104.4 2296/95 TW-II 104.8 2992/02 Variant 104.8 H120 Mass 104.6 2.4. a total of 18 throat and cloacal swab samples were collected from IBV 2992/02-infected chickens at one, three and five days post-infection. laryngotracheitis and infectious bronchitis have posed a threat in the poultry industry worldwide. the rapid and accurate diagnosis of the disease facilitates disease management. a prompt identification of IBV would be highly beneficial. tracers and test line mixtures were applied to the ICS strip. a positive IBV TW-I type AF was used as an antigen. stability of the mAb-gold conjugate is critical for optimizing the ICS strip\u2019s performance. mAb strains 2575/98 (TW-I), 2296/95 (TW-II), 3575/08 (TW-I), 2992/02 (TW-China variant) were propagated in 10-day-old SPF chicken embryos through the allantoic route as previously described. Western Blot Analysis One g of IBV 2575/98 (TW-I), 2296/95 (TW-II), and H120 viral antigens were mixed with an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. protein gels were transferred onto a 0.45-m nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA) after the transfer, the membrane was soaked in blocking buffer (5% skim milk in PBS) at room temperature for 1 h. the OD absorbance of each sample was determined at 580 nm by using an automated reader (Multiskan FC Microplate Photometer, Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA) the optimal pH value of gold particles and the concentration of mAbs for stabilizing colloidal gold particles were determined. the grid was stained with 6-nm gold-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted in blocking solution (1:20) for 1 h. Particles were visualized under a 200-kV high-resolution transmission electron microscope. Throat and cloacal swabs were collected in tryptose phosphate broth. the swabs were clarified by centrifuging at 3000 g for 20 min. RT-PCR Viral RNA was extracted from swab samples. the care and use of experimental animals were approved by the Institute Animal Care and Use Committee, National Taiwan University. all animal experiments were conducted in accordance with approved guidelines. mAbs were affinity purified using the protein A IgG purification kit. protein gels were transferred onto a 0.45-m nitrocellulose membrane. after three washes, the membrane was incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG. an additional 100 L of 10% NaCl solution was mixed and incubated for 5 min. OD absorptions at each pH and mAb concentration were obtained in triplicate. optimal pH value of gold particles and concentration of mAbs for stabilizing colloidal gold particles were determined. the grid was blocked with 1% (w/v) BSA for 1 h. the grid was stained with 6-nm gold-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted in blocking solution (1:20) for 1 h. Throat and cloacal swabs were collected in tryptose phosphate broth. swabs were clarified by centrifuging at 3000 g for 20 min. RT-PCR Viral RNA was extracted from swab samples. agarose gel electrophoresis analyzed a temperature of 72 \u00b0C for 12 min."}
