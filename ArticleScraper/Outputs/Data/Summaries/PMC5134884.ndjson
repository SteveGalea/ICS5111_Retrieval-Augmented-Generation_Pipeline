{"summary": "CAP is one of the most common diseases in children, and second leading cause of death for children in developing countries. CAP is 10 to 40/10,000 for children under 5 years of age and 11 to 16/10,000 for children between the age of 5 and 14 years. 174 cases of hospitalized children with CAP aged from 3 months to 12.4 years (average age was 4.1 years) were retrospectively analyzed. CAP was defined as the presence of signs and symptoms of pneumonia (fever and respiratory symptoms) and pulmonary condensation on chest radiography in a previously healthy child. test was performed by Sysmex XN9000 (Hyogo, Japan), PCT was tested by Roche cobas8000 (Indianapolis, IN, USA) system (reference value is 0.021\u20130.500 ng/mL), CRP and PA were tested by BECKMAN COULTER AU5800 (Brea, CA, USA) 174 cases of hospitalized children with CAP aged from 3 months to 12.4 years were retrospectively analyzed. CAP was defined as presence of signs and symptoms of pneumonia (fever and respiratory symptoms) and pulmonary condensation on chest radiography in a previously healthy child caused by an infection that was acquired outside the hospital. PCT was tested by Roche cobas8000 (Indianapolis, IN, USA) system (reference value is 0.021\u20130.500 ng/mL), CRP and PA were tested by BECKMAN COULTER AU5800 (Brea, CA, USA) and ESR was analyzed by Alifax TEST1 (Padova, Italy) analysis. the results of IgM antibody test in 174 cases of CAP were as follows: 45 cases of MP positive, 119 cases of MP negative, and 10 cases without examination. the total positive rate of MP was 27.4%, and there was no significant difference in positive rate in different seasons. the ROC curve of WBC, percentage of neutrophils, neutrophil count, ESR, and PA for the diagnosis of CAP was shown in Figs. 2 and 3. the parameters obtained from ROC curve were shown in Table 1. there was no significant difference for MP positive rate between 2 groups. RR in severe CAP group was significant higher than mild CAP group. there were only 2 cases of pleural effusion and 1 case of myocardial damage. in recent years, MP has become most common cause of CAP in children. in recent years, MP has become most common cause of CAP in children. previous studies have shown that up to 40% of CAP has MP infection. in developed countries CAP diagnosis is mostly clinical and is confirmed by radiographic finding of consolidation. the valuable laboratory tools are also needed in the management of CAP in children. the usefulness of PCT and CRP in the management of pediatric CAP has been carefully studied and compared. sensitivity for diagnosis of CAP was low according to the traditional cutoff value (all P 0.5); thus, the diagnostic value of CAP was limited. the possible reason is that the body's response to infection is poor if the child's immune system is low. RR was higher in severe CAP group than in mild CAP group. tachypnea was a good sign of CAP severity. there is no scoring system available for the severity of children CAP. the reduction of PA was correlated with the severity of CAP, except for X-ray, so as to guide clinical decision-making. in recent years, MP has become most common cause of CAP in children. there was no seasonal difference for positive rate of MP infections in this study. there was no significant correlation between severity of CAP in children and presence of MP infection. in developed countries CAP diagnosis is mostly clinical. the above indicators were increased in the patients with CAP. the sensitivity for diagnosis of CAP was low according to the traditional cutoff value (all P 0.5); thus, the diagnostic value of CAP was limited. RR was helpful to the severity of pneumonia in children under 1 year of age. the correlation sensitivity of RR > 70/min and hypoxia was 63%, and the specificity was 89%. tachypnea was still higher in severe CAP than in mild CAP group. ROC analysis showed that PA had a high sensitivity and specificity in assessing the severity of CAP when the cutoff value was 125 mg/L, which was lower than the traditional cutoff value (170 mg/L), indicating that PA can be used as an indicator for severity assessment of pediatric CAP."}
