{"summary": "the frequency of the TpA dinucleotide is suppressed across all animal genomes. the frequency of the CpG dinucleotide is suppressed in most vertebrates. a variety of theories have been put forward to explain common dinucleotide biases. the suppression in vertebrates is thought to be partly due to cytosine methylation (1, 3, 8), although it may be constrained by other aspects of DNA conformation. similar dinucleotide biases are found in viral genomes, with major differences among viral species. studies of influenza viruses and picornaviruses indicate that the innate immune response might recognize RNA-specific CpG motifs. other studies suggest that dinucleotide bias in viruses simply reflects background mutation pressure. if the dinucleotide composition of a virus matches that of its host, it could comprise a simple means to predict the true hosts for viral sequences generated in the increasing number of metagenomic studies. a strong association with virus phylogeny may limit the ability to accurately predict host species from virus dinucleotide composition alone. we analyzed viral sequences from 20 families of animal RNA viruses isolated from different vertebrate and arthropod hosts. RESULTS RNA viruses exhibit substantial variation in dinucleotide composition. otide odds ratios below 0.78 can be regarded as indicating underrepresented dinucleotides. values above 1.23 indicate overrepresented dinucleotides (3). the odds ratios for these dinucleotides are within the normal range for at least 50% of the component data sets. the Hepeviridae, Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, mononega-like viruses, and Reoviridae generally have normal odds ratios for this dinucleotide. the figure shows both dinucleotide underrepresentation (cool colors) and overrepresentation (warm colors) ssRNA() viruses are in green shades (Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, bunya-arena-like, Filoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and mononega-like) dsRNA viruses are in red shades (Birnaviridae and Reoviridae) data sets from nonmammalian vertebrates are shown in pink colors. u dinucleotides as well as those of the four GpN dinucleotides were generally normal across all host categories, as were CpC, CpU, UpC, and UpU. in contrast, CpG and UpA are underrepresented in most host groups, while CpA and UpG are usually overrepresented. the dinucleotide odds ratios can be considered useful for prediction if the model with their inclusion shows a large increase in predictive power from the baseline random model. the model predicts 81% of the data to the correct virus family, a very large improvement to the value of 10% observed in the baseline random model. peviridae had a very high sensitivity rate of 93%. the other two families with similar data set sizes had poor prediction rates. the arteriviridae had a sensitivity rate of 80% but an FDR of 56%. the Astroviridae had a higher FDR than sensitivity rate. 84% of the sequences from the \u201cChordata\u201d and 74% from the \u201cArthropoda\u201d were predicted correctly. only the host categories \u201cFish\u201d and \u201cMammals\u201d had a sensitivity rate of at least 80%. only the host categories \u201cFish\u201d and \u201cMammals\u201d had a sensitivity rate of at least 80%. vector-borne viruses infect a range of hosts, such that it is not a \u201chost-specific\u201d category per se. the removal of vector-borne viruses from this analysis did not improve sensitivity rates by a meaningful amount. a canonical plot of the host categories is shown in Fig. 4. viridae, Picornaviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, and Paramyxoviridae share the host categories \"Birds,\" \"Carnivores,\" \"Primates,\" and \"Rodents\" the overall prediction rate was poor for hosts in all virus families, and the sensitivity for the individual categories was low for most hosts, with the exception of \"Birds\" 37.5) 53 29 Carnivores 7 (10.9) 42 62 Cetartiodactyla 17 (26.6) 78 31 Primates 7 (10.9) 23 77 Rodents 5 (7.8) 59 26 Overall correct, 57% (random model, 24%) Picornaviridae Birds 2 (2.6) 31 87 Carnivores 5 (6.6) 25 76 Cetartiodactyla 27 (35.5) 63 29 Equines 1 (1.3) NAb NA the table shows how many data sets were assigned correctly to their host according to their dinucleotide odds ratios. the overall correct prediction rate is 34% (random model, 14%) togaviridae fish 3 (16.7) 86 49 Primates 1 (5.6) the togaviridae also show the highest sensitivity for the category \u201cVector-borne\u201d (79%;
