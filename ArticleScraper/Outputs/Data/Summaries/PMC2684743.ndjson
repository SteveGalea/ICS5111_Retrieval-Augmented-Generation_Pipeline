{"summary": "the heath care sector is being asked to account for their performance. this requires local public health units to demonstrate efficiency and effectiveness in providing services to their clients. this requirement poses unique challenges for local public health units. the overall health status of the residents within a health unit presents only a partial and imprecise picture of the performance of the health unit. 1997 Ontario mandatory health programs and services guidelines Standard Goal Equal Access To ensure that all Ontarians have access to public health programs. the BSC is a management tool developed by Kaplan and Norton in 1992. it broadened the traditional notion held by private sector companies that performance is indicated by financial measures solely. a number of healthcare organizations in various healthcare settings have adopted the BSC as their performance management tool. the integrity of the original and proposed ICES scorecard for public health is evident in the parallels between the original and proposed quadrants. businesses and health units may focus on their internal processes to demonstrate continuous quality improvements. an inclusive, participatory approach to indicators selection and development was chosen. a panel was struck, comprised of three interested staff members from each of the 5 divisions within the public health branch. the panel discussed and developed indicators to populate the four quadrants. the team was able to operationalize the BSC, develop performance measures and raise awareness about continuous quality improvement among the health unit staff. a consultant familiar with the BSC was hired to initiate the exercise. the panel and program areas submitted their selected indicators and provided text to describe their key activities. rant should contain three types of measures: determinants of population health, population health status measures and population health intervention impact measures. the panel was asked to select key indicators that described the burden of illness and the key demographic and social features that characterize the York Region as unique. four quadrants indicator value Health status and determinants Teen pregnancy rate 49.8 per 1,000 young women aged 15\u201319 years Percentage of overweight or obese adults aged 18+ 45.8% Resources and services Total number of investigations of institutional outbreaks per year 101 Per capita spending for safe water program $1.40 Community engagement Proportion of current programs that have completed a formal program evaluation 22% Integration and responsiveness Proportion of staff receiving emergency preparedness training in past year 100% Total number of peer reviewed journals, conference presentation and posters the health unit dedicates 0.1 FTE to this issue through the substance abuse and injury prevention team. there may be effective engagement between the health unit and the school board in promoting responsible drinking. there is emerging evidence that reducing the legal alcohol limit for driving and promoting designated drivers programs is associated with a lower motor vehicle collision rate. York Region is one of the first health units to develop indicators under the four quadrants suggested by ICES. comparable indicators from peer health units are not presently available. each division has been asked to identify three measures. the new report card will be presented to the governing board. the panel was struck by a panel of three interested staff members. the panel also discussed indicators to populate the four quadrants. the goal of the project was to develop an efficient scorecard for the health unit by populating a \"dashboard\" with key indicators aligned either with strategic priorities or particular themes, such as health inequity. the participants from all divisions and from three levels of staff invited and supported the development of a much more comprehensive and larger number of indicators. the panel and program areas submitted their selected indicators and provided text to describe their key activities. the result was a 75 page report containing 46 tables of indicators posted on the York Region website. this quadrant contains measures traditionally found in community health status reports, such as disease mortality/morbidity and health behaviours. the community who utilize local public health services needs to be included in a public health performance report. Ideally community engagement should go well beyond client satisfactions surveys and encompass community and partner involvement in program planning, evaluation and service delivery. questions to guide the development of indicators for this quadrant included: How is the health unit engaging the community\" a data dictionary was built to record a definition for each indicator. each program had a champion, usually the same individual who participated in the Delphi panel. a hypothetical example would be exploring the relationship between the rate of motor vehicle collisions and high alcohol use in the health unit. health unit's performance was poor, but program areas were encouraged to begin linking the quadrants as they moved forward with 2008 program planning and implementation on the basis of their reported 2007 performance. we intend to do this in future reports by comparing the baseline data with subsequent years. staff experienced the development of the scorecard as an informative and valuable exercise. but questioned the utility and relevance of some of the indicators as aids in program specific decision making. they recommended that a process be established to revisit and refine indicators. the authors declare they have no competing interests. the opinions stated are those of the authors and not of the Regional Municipality of York."}
