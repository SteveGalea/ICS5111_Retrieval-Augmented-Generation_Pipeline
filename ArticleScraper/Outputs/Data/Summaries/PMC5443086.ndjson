{"summary": "the first presentation, entitled \u201cThe background and development of rotavirus and norovirus VLP vaccines for prevention of gastroenteritis in children\u201d was given by Professor Timo Vesikari from the Univeristy of Helsinki's Vaccine Research Center. acute gastroenteritis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children globally and the 2 leading causative agents for viral gastroenteritis are Rotavirus (RV) and norovirus (NoV) the icosahedral noV VLP is readily producible via the self-assembly of the single capsid protein. it stimulates strong cellular and humoral immune responses. however, there are a number of distinct genogroups of NoV. the group has shown that both natural IgM antibodies and complement were required for this process. this is dependent on the size and multivalency of VLPs. they have elucidated an important pathway from the lung to the spleen. the 2014 EBOV outbreak had already claimed 234 lives. it has since been declared an international public health emergency by the world health organization. the first outbreak was recorded in 1976. the first outbreak was recorded in 1976. the second talk of the session, entitled \"RSV fusion (F) nanoparticle immunogenicity in man: a new approach to vaccines\" was given by Dr Gale Smith. the challenge associated with designing an RSV vaccine is to do something that nature cannot. potent monoclonal antibody, Palivizumab, is prescribed to prevent severe RSV infection. it recognizes a highly conserved antigenic site on F protein that is preserved and accessible in the postfusion state. Novavax team produced 40 nm rosette-shaped protein nanoparticles from modified RSV F oligomers. swine flu pandemic Medicago demonstrated ability to go from sequence identification to ready vials of vaccine in just 3 weeks. facility capable of producing 10 M doses of pandemic influenza vaccine/month was built in just 14 months at less than one tenth of the cost of a comparable mammalian cell culture facility. over 30 influenza HA VLPs from A and B strains have been produced with none so far proving refractory to expression. summary VLPNPV 2014 brought together researchers interested in developing novel approaches to designing, manufacturing and deliver the next generations of vaccines. the conference highlighted the many ways in which such vaccines can overcome the limitations of traditional vaccines, from immune responses to manufacture."}
