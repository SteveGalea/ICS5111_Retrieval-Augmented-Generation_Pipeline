{"summary": "a new human coronavirus (CoV) isolated several months earlier from a patient in Saudi Arabia who had died of severe respiratory complications. this new virus was genetically distinct, being classified phylogenetically in the group 2C coronavirus clade (2). this virus was named the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV because of its geographic predilection (3). a total of 336 diverse fresh or frozen clinical specimens collected between April 2011 and April 2013 from 321 persons who had severe acute respiratory illness were available for testing. a total of 280 diverse fresh or frozen specimens collected between April 2011 and April 2013 from 321 persons who had severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) were available for testing. stock virus used in spiking experiments was inactivated by gamma irradiation. sample was added to an equal volume of 500 mM freshly prepared No-Weigh dithiothreitol. oculated and observed daily for cytopathic effect (CPE) multiple primer/probe sets targeting regions in the 3\u2032, middle, and 5\u2032 regions of the N gene sequence were designed using Primer Express software, version 3.0. all primers and probes were synthesized by standard phosphoramidite chemical techniques at the CDC Biotechnology Core Facility.
