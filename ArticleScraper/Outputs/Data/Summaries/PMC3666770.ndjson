{"summary": "rotaviruses are a major cause of viral gastroenteritis in children and young animals worldwide. large numbers of excreted viral particles during RV infection contribute to RV prevalence and genetic diversity (2\u20134) there are 27 G genotypes and 35 P genotypes identified to date (6). 12 G genotypes (G1 to G6, G8 to G12, and G26) and 13 P genotypes (P[1], P[5] to P[8], P[11], P[13], P[19], P[23], P[26], P[27], P[32], and P[34]) have been associated with pigs. five selected swine farms in Ohio for detection of RVAs. all samples collected in 2004 were from nursing piglets with no information about diarrheal status (14), whereas for the 2011 age information was missing for 39 samples from farm 2. RNA was extracted from a 250-l starting volume of centrifuged 10% fecal suspensions using an RNeasy minikit. total RNA recovered was suspended in 40 l of nuclease-free water and stored at 70\u00b0C until used. the PCR products from the above reaction were analyzed in a 3% agarose gel after staining with EZ-Vision dye (Amresco) the amount of PCR inhibitors in the samples was determined to be negligible based on results obtained by making 10-fold and 100-fold dilutions of each RNA sample. a chi-square test was used to assess the relationship between several factors (farm, year, season, age group, and diarrheal status) and RVA detection. we designed genotype-specific primers for common G genotypes found in swine (G3, G4, G5, G9, and G11) to genotype the RVA-positive samples directly without sequencing. to RT-PCR and partial sequencing of the RVA VP4 gene (nt 793 to 1604) nucleotide sequences obtained from selected strains were compared with the same segments of similar sequences of known strains available in GenBank using BLAST software. the tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. ten percent (wt/vol) fecal suspensions were prepared in minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, NY), vortexed, and centrifuged at 1,800 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. none of the farms surveyed used the RVA vaccine licensed for swine in the united states. RNA was extracted from a 250-l starting volume of centrifuged 10% fecal suspensions using an RNeasy minikit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) the total RNA recovered was suspended in 40 l of nuclease-free water and stored at 70\u00b0C until used. conventional reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was used for detection of the RVAs with validated primer sets. the amount of PCR inhibitors in the samples was determined to be negligible based on results obtained by making 10-fold and 100-fold dilutions of each RNA sample. the amount of PCR inhibitors was determined to be negligible based on results obtained by making 10-fold and 100-fold dilutions of each RNA sample. common primer 3\u2032comVP7-R was used as the reverse primer, while common primer 5\u2032comVP7-F was used as the forward primer. chi-square test was used to assess relationship between several factors (farm, year, season, age group, and diarrheal status) and RVA detection. nucleotide sequences obtained from selected strains were compared with the same segments of similar sequences of known strains available in GenBank using BLAST software. the dendrograms were constructed using the neighbor-joining method supported with a bootstrap test of 1,000 replicates for each gene in MEGA5 software (19). the tree was drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. an increase in RVA detection was observed from 5.9% in 2004 to 8.5% in 2011 and then to 13.8% in 2012. there were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in RVA detection rates between the seasons during the years surveyed. the prevalence of RVAs was highest in spring (11.1%), followed by summer (8%) and then winter (6.9%). RVA was detected in 17.7% (11/62) and 9.8% (6/61) of the diarrheic and nondiarrheic piglets. of the 123 samples collected in 2012, RVA was detected significantly (P 0.01) more often in nursing piglets (21.1%, 16/76) than in weaned piglets. the P types were determined for 91.3% (21/23) of the samples, whereas two samples were untypeable. we used a combination of BLAST (blastn) search, phylogenetic tree analyses, and RotaC2.0 web-based tool (20) analysis of the partial sequences of VP7 and VP4 genes of the 23 samples. the G9 genotype was detected in all the years studied. the P[13] genotype was detected in all the years studied. the P[7] genotype was detected in all the years studied. the P[7] genotype was detected only in 2004 and 2012. both the QW359 and QW362 strains clustered in a monophyletic branch in the phylogenetic tree (2004). they displayed 85 to 86% nucleotide identity with human G11 RVAs and 83% nucleotide identity with other G11 porcine RVAs. a BLAST (blastn) search and ClustalW analysis of the VP4 segment of our P[7] field strains showed that they were closely related (92 to 99%) to bovine RVA strains (KJ25-1_HM988968 and KV0407_EU873009) isolated in south Korea and to porcine-like RVA strain CH-1 (HQ641296) detected in a panda in china. a close relationship was also observed between our P[13] strains and a number of P[13] porcine strains, of which strain A46 (AY050274) shared the highest nucleotide identity (83.9 to 86.1%) a total of 371 samples from five swine herds were tested, and 9.4% (35/371) were positive for RVAs. in 2004, the highest prevalence occurred in spring (13%), while in 2011, summer (11.6%) had the highest prevalence. in 2012, the detection rate was highest in winter (18.2%), as shown in Table 3. Table 3. Summary of RVA prevalence in the Ohio swine herds. RVA was detected in 17.7% (11/62) and 9.8% (6/61) of the diarrheic and nondiarrheic piglets. of the 123 samples collected in 2012, RVA was detected significantly (P 0.01) more often in nursing piglets (21.1%, 16/76) than in weaned piglets (2.1%, 1/47). the 23 strains were classified into three G-genotypes (G4, G9, and G11) in combination with two P genotypes (P[7] and P[13] that are either commonly or exclusively associated with porcine RVAs. the P[13] genotype was dominant among the P types. seven randomly selected strains were sequenced for further characterization of the partial VP7 gene (316 nt) the two G4 strains (RV0120 and RV0132 [farm 2]) detected in 2011 were closely related to each other. the two strains showed the lowest nucleotide identity (85% to 87%) to human RV D151 identified in Mexico. both the QW359 and QW362 strains clustered in a monophyletic branch in the phylogenetic tree. phylogenetic dendrogram of the partial (nt 73 to 388) sequence of the RVA VP7 gene of field strains compared with available VP7 gene sequences for human and porcine RVA G genotypes. phylogenetic analysis of the partial (nt 859 to 1493; 635 bp) nucleotide sequence of the RVA VP4 gene of field strains (boldface) showed five genetic sublineages of the P[13] genotype: one sublineage formed by strains identified in Japan, a second sublineage by strains from Thailand and India, a fourth sublineage branch formed by an Australian strain. strains and a number of P[13] porcine strains shared the highest nucleotide identity (83.9 to 86.1%) another close relationship was found between P[7] strains, of which strain OSU (X13190) shared the highest nt identity (92 to 99.6%). a number of enteric pathogens may have synergistic effects on the clinical course of porcine RVA infections (21, 33\u201336). pigs receiving sow colostral and milk antibodies may cause only transient diarrhea that may have subsided. RVAs were detected in 17.7% and 9.8% of the diarrheic and nondiarrheic fecal samples in 2012. asymptomatic infections with RVA in swine have been reported in previous studies. a higher prevalence of RVA in asymptomatic pigs was reported in Slovenia. the G9 genotypes were detected at higher levels (78%) this was consistent with a recent study in Thailand (64.3%) and Spain (33%), where it was found to be the most common genotype (10, 31) however, this was in contrast with a recent study in Denmark and Slovenia (31) and South Korea (23), where G9 was detected at low levels. in this study, we reported fewer distinct G-P genotype combinations (17), which was in contrast to recent studies in Europe (3, 13, 31), where more genotype combinations were reported. however, recent studies in Asia also reported fewer G-P genotype combinations in swine (10, 23), while in canada a single genotype combination (G4P[6]) was most commonly detected (26), suggesting genetic variability in RVA strains circulating in the U.S. pig population. diversity reported in this study may pose a challenge for future prophylactic strategies for prevention and control of RV-associated gastroenteritis in nursing and weaned piglets. large-scale epidemiological investigations are needed to better evaluate both the ecology and genetic diversity of porcine RVAs circulating in swine farms."}
