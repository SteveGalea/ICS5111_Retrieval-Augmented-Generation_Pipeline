{"summary": "six types of pseudotyped particles were produced: HA only pseudoparticles (H3X-31), native matching pseudoparticles (H3X-31/N2X-31), human:avian mismatching pseudoparticles (H3X-31/N2MS96) and two control pseudovirions, VSV-env and VSV-G. the pseudovirions were used to infect Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells. ivity assay of influenza pseudotyped particles H3X-31/N2X-31, H3X-31/N2Japan, H3X-31/N2MS96, H3X-31/N2MS96, H3X-31, VSV and env. individual virion fusion measurements were performed using total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRF) microscopy. evanescent light excites the fluorophores in the viral membrane. a membrane-bound pH sensor (Oregon green DHPE) is not shown for clarity. a native X-31 virus labeled with R18 fusing with a supported bilayer after triggering with pH 4.5. kH is the hemifusion or pore formation rate constant, t is lag time, and N is an additional fit parameter reporting the number of rate-limiting steps. the gamma distribution is appropriate here, as fusion events occur stochastically and independently of each other. the hemifusion rate constants of matching pseudoparticles (H3X-31/N2X-31) and native influenza X-31 are similar at all initiation pHs. the rate of hemifusion increases almost linearly from pH 5.3 to 4.7 and reaches a plateau at the \u201cfastest\u201d fusion pH. HA hemifusion rate constant, kH and number of HA trimers, N, as a function of pH for native influenza X-31, matching pseudoparticles (H3X-31/N2X-31), mismatching pseudoparticles (H3X-31/N2MS96) and HA only pseudoparticles (H3X-31) vary between 1.5 and 3. HA incorporation in rhabdoviral pseudovirions is lower than authentic influenza X-31. rhabdoviral pseudovirions are bullet-shaped compared to authentic X-31. only one HA trimer may be needed for mismatching pseudotyped fusion. HA1 bands were normalized to corresponding VSV M bands. the values could be compared between different HA-NA combinations. HA band intensities of human:avian mismatching pseudoparticles are 45% and 20% lower than X-31 matching pseudoparticles. HA, NA, and cell nuclei were fluorescently labeled in permeablized and non-permeablized conditions. cells were co-transfected with pCAGGS-empty (No NA), pCAGGS-empty (No NA), pCAGGS-empty (X-31), pCAGGS-N2 (Japan N2 NA), and pCAGGS-N2(MS). HA accumulated mostly within perinuclear vesicles in HA-only (H3X-31), mismatching (H3X-31/N2MS96) and mismatching (H3X-31/N2Japan) conditions. no NA signal was observed in the HA-only (H3X-31) condition, as expected. the hemifusion rate constant of NA inhibitor treated virus is 0.24 s1 with a value of 2.5 for N at pH 4, and 0.06 and 1.9 at pH 5.1. the hemifusion rate constant of NA inhibitor treated virus is 0.24 s1 with a value of 2.5 for N at pH 4, and 0.06 and 1.9 at pH 5.1. al.\u2019s work29 found that NA inhibitors do not impact binding or fusion. however, they suggest that NA function does impact endocytosis. our results corroborate Ohuchi et al.\u2019s observations. the results of the infectivity assays show that VSV-H3X-31/N2X-31, VSV-H3X-31/N2MS96 and VSV-H3X-31 particles are infectious. however, among these, infectivity levels varied based on the number of GFP-positive cells observed. a single-fusion assay performed with total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRFM) three pseudovirus particles are shown containing HA (blue) and NA (red) in their membrane envelopes. a membrane-bound pH sensor (Oregon green DHPE) is not shown for clarity. fusion experiments were carried out within a channel for 3\u20134 min at a data collection rate of 10 frames/s. the hemifusion lag time distributions are fit to the cumulative gamma distribution. each fusion event is a multistep process, with each step being described by a Poisson process. the rate of hemifusion of native influenza X-31 and matching pseudoparticles (H3X-31/N2X-31) are similar and are distinctively faster than that of other pseudoviruses. the hemifusion rate constants of matching pseudoparticles (H3X-31/N2X-31) and native influenza X-31 are strongly dependent on native influenza viruses. the rate of hemifusion increases almost linearly from pH 5.3 to 4.7. it is not evident from the data shown in Fig. 5 that mismatching pseudotyped particles exhibit the same dependence on pH. the error associated with the parameter falls within the rate constant values associated with adjacent pHs. human:avian mismatching pseudovirions (H3X-31/N2MS96) are found to be approximately 3. the N values of human:human mismatching pseudovirions (H3X-31/N2Japan) vary between 1.5 to 3. a change in the number of HA contributing to bending the membrane over this range is hard to rationalize. the presence and activity of NA was key to HA incorporation into lentiviral-based pseudotyped particles and their release from the cell surface23. quantitative Western blots were performed to determine the relative protein incorporation of HA in particles. the internal VSV matrix protein (M protein, 37 kDa) was used to normalize band intensities of HA. three N2 bands (55 kDa) were normalized to corresponding VSV M bands. each error bar represents the mean SD of three independent experiments. the normalized bands were normalized again to the matching pseudovirions. cells were co-transfected with pCAGGS-H3(X-31) and with either. pCAGGS-empty (No NA), pCAGGS-N2 (X-31), pCAGGS-N2 (Japan) and pCAGGS-N2 (MS96). no NA signal was observed in the HA-only condition. the immunofluorescence microscopy results are in alignment with the report by Galloway et al. which also compared the expression of H3 in X-31 HA-transfected cells with and without cognate N2. the results indicate that the matching NA is required for efficient HA trafficking to the cell surface in BHK and Vero cells25. the data demonstrates the hemifusion kinetics of NADNA-treated influenza virus and non-treated virus are similar at pH 4.0 and pH 5.1. there were no significant differences on viral binding either. the hemifusion rate constant of NA inhibitor treated virus is 0.24 s1 with a value of 2.5 for N at pH 4, and 0.06 and 1.9 at pH 5.1. insufficient NA enzymatic activity leads to the formation of virus aggregates on egress31. we were able to study the interplay between HA and NA. this system allowed us to study the co-incorporation of H3 HA and N2 NA of the prototypical strain X-31 and to switch N2 NAs of different strains. HA trafficking varies considerably depending on which NA is co-expressed in transfected BHK-21 cells. this leads to differential HA expression on cell plasma membranes. these analyses show that switching NAs of the same subtype (N2) can have profound effect on fusion kinetics mediated by the HA protein. pCAGGS-H3/X-31, pCAGGS-N2/X-31, pCAGGS-N2/Japan, pCAGGS-VSVG and pCAGGS-empty encode the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of influenza virus X-31. pCAGGS-VSVG encodes the glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus. the virus is a recombinant virus that harbors a genome in which the glycoprotein gene is replaced by the green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter gene. the supernatants were collected after several gentle taps on the walls of petri dishes to help the release of particles. natants were discarded, and pellets were resuspended in 3 g/ml trypsin. the pellets were placed in a 37 \u00b0C water bath for 15 min. Western blots were visualized and analyzed using a Chemidoc XRS+ system. a mixture containing 0.75 L of lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1 g of plasmid DNA (500 ng of HA- and NA-encoding plasmid DNA) for each well. transfected cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min. the cells then were blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 45 min. the lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabster, AL) and Oregon green DHPE was purchased from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. to form liposomes, all components were dissolved and mixed in biotechnology grade chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich) in a glass vial. the bulk solvent was removed by blowing high purity nitrogen. microfluidic devices were formed using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) in a molding process. the silicon mold was coated with chlorotrimethylsilane (Sigma-Aldrich) via vapor deposition to facilitate the release of cured PDMS. a 10% dilute solution of liposomes was drawn into the microchannel at a flow rate of 100 L/min for 90 s and incubated on the glass substrates for 2 h. channels were rinsed again with GPMV buffer at 100 L/min for 2 min. fusion occurs within a 100 nm thick region. the evanescent wave can excite fluorophores near the membrane. pCAGGS-H3/X-31 and pCSAGGS-N2/X-31 encode the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of influenza virus X. pCAGGS-N2/MS96 encodes the neuraminidase of influenza virus MS96 (H9N2), pCAGGS-N2/Japan encodes the neuraminidase of influenza virus Japan (H2N2) and pCAGGS-VSVG encodes the glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus. the pCAGGS vector serves as the empty vector control. the supernatants were ultracentrifuged in a Ti45 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 120 min. pellets were resuspended in 3 g/ml trypsin and incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C to activate HA. all Western blots were visualized and analyzed using a Chemidoc XRS+ system with Image Lab image capture software (BioRad) the software detects bands by the signal contrast between band and background. all bands have only been adjusted in contrast and brightness. microscopy images were acquired using an inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss) with a 100x objective. liposomes contain a 4:4:2:0.5:0.01 molar ratio of 1,2dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1-oleoyl-2-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), cholesterol, total ganglioside extract neuraminidase inhibitor N-Acetyl-2,3-dehydro-2-deoxyneuraminic acid was dissolved in DI water to 2 mg/mL. 1 L of NADNA was mixed with 6 L of influenza X-31 virus and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. a mixture of Sylgard 184 (Dow Corning) was mixed and degassed to remove bubbles. the PDMS then was crosslinked in the oven for 3 h at 80 \u00b0C. both the piranha cleaned glass cover slip and the microfluidic device were assembled by oxygen plasma bonding. two lasers with 561 nm and 488 nm excitation wavelengths were used to simultaneously excite red and green fluorophores under this setting. the laser TIRF 3 slider (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) was used to control the angles of incidence in the optical pathway."}
