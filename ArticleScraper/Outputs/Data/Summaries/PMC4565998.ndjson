{"summary": "prospective study conducted in adult patients (aged 21 years) hospitalized with LRTI over 3 respiratory seasons (2008\u20132011) all patients were enrolled at Rochester General Hospital, new york, and screened for bacteria and respiratory viruses with a comprehensive microbiologic diagnostic algorithm. virus types 1\u20133, human rhinovirus [HRV], coronavirus 229E and OC43; viral culture for influenza, RSV, PIV, HRV, adenovirus, and enterovirus; and acute and convalescent serum immunoglobulin G titers for influenza, RSV, PIV, and adenovirus. urinary antigen testing was also performed for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumoniae. first, we performed supervised analysis (comparative analyses between predefined sample groups) using the Mann\u2013Whitney test (P.01), followed by Benjamini\u2013Hochberg multiple-test corrections and a 1.25 fold change in expression level relative to the control group [10, 12]. second, we applied unsupervised clustering (unbiased grouping of samples based on their transcriptional profile without prior knowledge of sample classification) to the validation set. all patients were hospitalized with LRTI over 3 respiratory seasons. exclusion criteria included antibiotic treatment before admission, immunosuppression, cavitary lung disease, and witnessed aspiration. informed consent was obtained from subjects before sample collection. viral culture for influenza, RSV, PIV, HRV, adenovirus, and enterovirus. bacterial pathogens were identified with Gram staining and semiquantitative bacterial cultures from sputum and blood samples. urinary antigen testing was also performed for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumoniae. we performed supervised analysis using the Mann\u2013Whitney test (P.01), followed by Benjamini\u2013Hochberg multiple-test corrections and a 1.25 fold change in expression level relative to the control group. we then applied class prediction, using the K\u2013nearest neighbors (K-NN) algorithm, with 12 neighbors and a P value ratio cutoff of.5, to identify the top-ranked genes that best discriminated between bacterial and viral infections [9]. patients' median age was 61 years (interquartile range, 50\u201376 years), 69 (58.4%) were female, and the majority were white. most common clinical presentation was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (34 episodes;

LRTIs are a frequent cause of hospitalization and a major reason for treatment with antibiotics worldwide. the role of respiratory viruses in LRTIs in older adults is increasingly recognized, suggesting that accurate diagnostic tests to identify the etiologic mechanism of LRTIs have the potential to reduce overall antibiotic use. the 10 classifier genes have superior sensitivity and similar specificity compared with serum PCT. these findings are in accord with the Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society recommendations for improvement in the diagnosis of LRTI. the biosignatures were obtained from hospitalized patients who represent the most severe forms of LRTI. this important subgroup will require further studies using a larger sample. there are ongoing studies applying PCR-based platforms to advance the implementation of host transcriptional profiles in the clinical setting."}
