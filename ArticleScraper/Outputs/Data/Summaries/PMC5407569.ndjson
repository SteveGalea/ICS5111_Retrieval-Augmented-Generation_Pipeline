{"summary": "viral RNA viruses are prone to mutations introduced by mechanisms intrinsic and extrinsic to viral replication. however, large population size, complementation, cellular chaperones, and recombination can buffer viral populations against deleterious and lethal mutations. the purpose of this article is not to describe how RNA viruses evolve. high mutation rates alone are not sufficient to drive viral adaptation. mutations generated via virus- and cell-dependent mechanisms can differentially impact viral fitness. large population sizes buffer against deleterious and lethal mutations. RNA viruses lack postreplicative repair, and the key difference between the intrinsic fidelity of the viral RdRp or RT and most replicative cellular DNA polymerases is the lack of associated proofreading activity. nidoviruses within the families Coronaviridae, Roniviridae, and mesoniviridae encode proofreading 3\u2019-to-5\u2019 exoribonuclease activity within a protein distinct from the viral RdRp. studies with poliovirus 3Dpol provided the first descriptions of high- and low-fidelity RdRp variants. the high fidelity G64S 3Dpol variant was isolated following passage in the presence of the antiviral nucleoside analog ribavirin. a N297E substitution within 3Dpol decreased fidelity by 14-fold. chikungunya virus nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2) can decrease and increase fidelity. mutational disruption of viral protein interactions or alterations in replicase protein stoichiometry could all presumably alter fidelity. replication is inexorably linked to cellular microenvironment. rNTP levels have pleiotropic effects on both viral and cellular enzymes. reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS, respectively) can be generated during viral infection and damage all classes of biomolecules, including nucleobases. oxidation of cellular nucleobases effectively modulates hydrogen bonding capacity. APOBEC proteins modify DNA, ADAR proteins modify genomic RNA or viral transcripts containing double-stranded RNA structures. ADAR deaminates adenine bases to inosine, resulting in A-to-G base substitutions, and occurs across RNA virus families resulting in either pro- or antiviral effects."}
