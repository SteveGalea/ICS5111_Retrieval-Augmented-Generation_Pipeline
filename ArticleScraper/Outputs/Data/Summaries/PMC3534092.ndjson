{"summary": "more than 60% of the newly diagnosed HIV cases in the united states in 2009 were MSM [1] in the WHO European Region, the proportion of MSM among new HIV infections was estimated to be 20% in 2010 [2]. the epidemic has also increased among MSM populations in africa and Asia; the UNAIDS report in 2010 showed that the HIV prevalence among MSM aged 15\u201349 years varied from 12% to 44% in seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa. china has invested substantial funds and human resources into public health programs for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, such as needle exchange and methadone maintenance programs for injection drug users [13], [14] and free combination antiretroviral therapy programs for rural and/or poor urban residents living with HIV/AIDS [15], [16]. by 2011, China had successfully obtained the Global Fund round 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 projects (China GF-3, 4, 5, 6 & 8) china GF-5 project sought to prevent a new wave of HIV in 6 low-prevalence provinces (Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Gansu) and one municipality in China (Chongqing) study data collected in 4 rounds of annual cross-sectional epidemiological surveys. men aged 18 years or older with self-reported anal or oral sexual behavior with a male partner in the past 12 months were eligible. most participants recruited using a snowball sampling method. amusi 407 297 302 300 1,306 Lanzhou 264 130 200 200 794 Qiqihar 398 402 300 1,400 Shenyang 395 407 450 450 1,702 Tianshui 174 206 200 200 780 Tonghua 399 259 304 400 1,362 Wuzhong 17 0 35 0 52 Yinchuan 55 0 312 200 567 Chongqing 952 740 602* 600* 2,89 hypothesis 1: there was no difference of condom use at last sex with a male sexual partner between post-intervention survey in 2009 and baseline survey in 2006. hypothesis 2: there was no difference of condom use between post-intervention and baseline surveys. ivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed pooling all participants in the four surveys. predictors included in the models were study year, age, marriage, education, ethnicity, residence, occupation, recruitment venue, age at first sex with a man, and 6-month drug use. the target populations included the four HIV aforementioned populations: MSM, CSWs, IDUs and migrants. interventions were implemented during 2006 and 2009. about 5,000 MSM were recruited in each survey (n = 20,843 for all four rounds) participants completed questionnaire interview on demographics, HIV knowledge and attitudes, history of STIs, history of HIV testing, and prior experience of receiving HIV/STI counseling and intervention services. a rapid test (HIV (1+2) Antibody (Colloidal Gold) was used in the 2006 and 2007 surveys. positive specimens were confirmed for HIV infection using Western blot. the participants with syphilis infection were referred to local STI clinics. men aged 18 years or older with self-reported anal or oral sexual behavior with a male partner in the past 12 months were eligible. most participants in these surveys were recruited using a snowball sampling method [19]. 0 52 Yinchuan 55 0 312 200 567 Chongqing 952 740 602* 600* 2,894 Total 5,076 4,981 5,460 5,326 20,843 Participants were recruited using respondent driven sampling. post-intervention survey in 2009 and baseline survey in 2006;

HIV prevalence increased in both participants who received interventions and who did not receive interventions in the past 12 months. but it increased much more rapidly among participants who did not receive interventions than those who received interventions. factors associated with condom use Older age and student status were associated with lower odds of condom use. 0.82, 1.06) Education 0.24 0.22 Middle school or lower 4512 70.8 1 1 High school 6991 71.7 1.05 (0.96, 1.14) 1.07 (0.98, 1.17) Some college or higher 6206 70.4 0.98 (0.90, 1.07) 1.07 (0.97, 1.18) Local residence 0.07 0.50 No 5417 72.0 1 1 Yes 12292 70.6 0.94 (0.87, 1.00) 1.03 (0.95, 1.11) Occupation Factors associated with HIV prevalence College education (aOR, 0.81;
