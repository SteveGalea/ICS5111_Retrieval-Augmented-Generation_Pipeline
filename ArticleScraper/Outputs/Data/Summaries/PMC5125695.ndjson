{"summary": "annual epidemics caused by IAVs are substantial causing >200,000 hospitalizations and >36,000 deaths in the united states each year. only modest progress has been made in the development of IAV drugs. antigenic drift and antigenic shift naturally reduce vaccine efficacy and control. verdinexor (KPT-335) has completed a registration-directed study in companion dogs with newly diagnosed or first relapsed non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) one compound, verdinexor (KPT-335), has completed a registration-directed study in companion dogs with newly diagnosed or first relapsed non-Hodgkin lymphoma. mouse-adapted influenza A/California/04/09, A/Philippines/2/82/X-79, and A/WSN/33 were propagated as previously described. in vivo mouse efficacy studies BALB/c female mice (6\u20138 week-old) were obtained from the National Cancer Institute. all experiments and procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Georgia. mice were infected with 10LD50 (50%-lethal dose) of mouse-adapted A/California/04/09. mice were infected with 10LD50 (50%-lethal dose) of mouse-adapted A/California/04/09. mice were evaluated for weight, clinical signs, and survival for 14 days. PLEX MAP mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel (EMD Millipore) and Luminex 200 system were resuspended in 100 L of PBS. cells were incubated with Fc Block, APC anti-mouse CD11c (HL3), PerCP-Cy5.5 anti-mouse Ly-6G/Ly-6C (Gr-1), PE anti-mouse CD49b/Pan-NK cells (G ferrets were monitored for clinical symptoms (body temperature, activity, respiratory signs, and weight loss) daily. at day 2 and 4 pi, nasal washes were collected and centrifuged. cells were counted and used to determine cytokines gene expression. 1 = minimal changes in bronchiolar epithelium with minimal perivascular inflammation; 2 = mild multifocal bronchial and/or bronchiolar epithelial changes with perivascular, peribronchial/bronchiolar inflammation. 4 = marked, diffuse bronchial and/or bronchiolar epithelial changes with perivascular, peribronchial/bronchiolar and alveolar inflammation. mice were treated with 20 mg/kg verdinexor at day 1 and 3 post-infection (pi) or 10 mg/kg oseltamivir twice daily. mice were sacrificed and BAL fluids were collected to determine the amount of virus and pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted. mice were infected with 10LD50 of mouse-adapted A/California/04/09. mice were evaluated for weight, clinical signs, and survival for 14 days. n = 3 male CD1 mice per time point (28 g of weight) were evaluated for weight, clinical signs, and survival for 14 days. in vivo ferret efficacy studies Young adult male ferrets (Triple F Farms) weighing between 800\u20131,000g (n = 3 per treatment group) were used for the study. nasal washes were concentrated by centrifugation and subjected to RNA isolation. RT-PCR analysis Total RNA was isolated from nasal wash cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and cDNA were synthesized using the Verso cDNA Synthesis Kit and random hexamers as primer. quantitative PCR was performed using ferret IFN-, IL-12p40, TNF-, and GAPDH gene specific primers. verdinexor reduces influenza virus shedding, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and inflammatory cell infiltration. verdinexor targets a host factor, but it is expected there will be limited to no development of resistance. mice treated with verdinexor showed significantly lower IFN- and slightly lower TNF- at day 4 pi. levels of chemokines MCP-1 and RANTES were elevated in verdinexor-treated mice. no significant increase in inflammatory cell recruitment was observed. flow cytometry shows verdinexor-treated mice had substantially lower immune cells infiltrates, in particular CD11c+Gr-1+ (granulocytes; p0.001), CD3+ (T cells; p0.05), DX5+ (NK cells; p0.0001), and CD3+DX5+ (NKT cells; p0.01) cells. the most significant reduction in lung virus titer was observed when one of the doses was given at day 4 pi. the most significant reduction in lung virus titer was observed when one of the doses was given at day 4 pi which is the peak of virus replication in the absence of treatment. mice were euthanized and lungs were collected for virus titration. results show verdinexor is efficacious even when given at later time points post-infection. dinexor only (p0.0001) or 10 mg/kg oseltamivir only (p0.001), with 4 of the 10 mice had levels of virus at or below the assay detection limit. this result further demonstrates the efficacy of verdinexor against multiple IAV subtypes. mice do not accurately emulate the clinical signs of IAV in humans. ts that received verdinexor at 15 mg/kg QD, 25 mg/kg QD, 10 mg/kg BID showed significantly reduced lung virus titers. limited reduction in pathology was observed in ferrets that received lower verdinexor dose of 15 mg/kg QD or oseltamivir. ferrets were infected with 10ID50 A/California/04/09 and orally treated with 15 (V15) or 25 mg/kg (V25) verdinexor daily (QD), or 10 mg/kg verdinexor (V10) or 5 mg/kg oseltamivir (O5) twice daily (BID) qRT-PCR methods were employed to detect cytokines gene expression in cells harvested from the nasal washes. ferrets that received verdinexor at 25 mg/kg QD (p0.01), 10 mg/kg BID (p0.01) also showed reduced TNF- expression at day 2 and 4 pi. verdinexor-treated mice had significantly lower IFN- and TNF- in the BALF compared to mock-treated mice. levels of IL-6 and IL-12p40 were also reduced at day 4 pi. in vivo efficacy of verdinexor was evaluated more comprehensively in mice. mice were infected with 10MID50 of mouse-adapted A/California/04/09 intranasally and treated orally with 20 mg/kg verdinexor twice daily post-infection. five mice per group were sacrificed at day 2 and 4 post-infection. flow cytometry showed that verdinexor-treated mice had substantially lower immune cells infiltrates, in particular CD11c+Gr-1+ (granulocytes; p0.001), CD3+ (T cells; p0.05), DX5+ (NK cells; p0.01), and CD3+DX5+ (NKT cells; p0.01) cells, but not CD11c+Gr-1- cells. i.n. infected with 10LD50 mouse-adapted A/California/04/09. orally treated with 20 mg/kg verdinexor at day 1 and 3, day 2 and 4, day 3 and 5, day 4 and 5, or 10 mg/kg oseltamivir twice daily. acy of late verdinexor treatment was assessed for improving survival following lethal influenza virus challenge. mortality was still reduced in groups receiving 5 mg/kg verdinexor at day 3 and 5 and 5 mg/kg at day 5 pi (p0.05) compared to non-treated mice. verdinexor limits IAV replication, lung pathology, and inflammation in ferrets. mice do not accurately emulate the clinical signs of IAV in humans. mice do not accurately emulate the clinical signs of IAV in humans. ology of the lungs revealed significant amelioration of influenza-associated lung pathology and inflammation in ferrets that received verdinexor at 25 mg/kg QD (p0.05) or 10 mg/kg BID (p0.01) but limited reduction in pathology was observed in ferrets that received lower verdinexor dose of 15 mg/kg QD. i.n. infected with 10ID50 A/California/04/09 and orally treated with 15 (V15) or 25 mg/kg (V25) verdinexor daily (QD), or 10 mg/kg verdinexor (V10) or 5 mg/kg oseltamivir (O5) twice daily (BID) for 4 days starting at 1 h pre-infection. qRT-PCR methods were employed to detect cytokines gene expression in cells harvested from the nasal washes. ferrets that received verdinexor at 25 mg/kg QD (p0.01), 10 mg/kg BID (p0.01) and oseltamivir (p0.05) also showed reduced TNF- expression at day 2 and 4 pi. the current study also shows the multifaceted ability of verdinexor to ameliorate influenza-associated diseases. reductions of lung virus titer and inflammation were observed in verdinexor-treated mice and ferrets. aliquots of the supernatant were taken and diluted 1:100 to infect a new plate of A549 cells. the virus was serially passaged 10 times in quadruplicate wells. bronchioles were not readily identified due to necrosis of the wall and obliteration of the lumen by inflammation which spilled out into and filled alveoli. bronchioles were not readily identified due to necrosis of the wall and obliteration of the lumen by inflammation. moderate peribronchiolar and perivascular inflammation of mostly lymphocytes was present. this animal had a lung score of 2. f) Lung of infected ferret treated with 10 mg/kg BID Verdinexor."}
