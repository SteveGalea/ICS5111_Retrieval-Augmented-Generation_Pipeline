{"summary": "allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation offers curative treatment of a variety of hematologic malignancies and immune disorders. 20% to 30% of patients develop viral respiratory tract infection, caused by influenza (A and B) virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and rhinovirus. butyrate reduces lung inflammation and injury during pneumonia. altered intestinal microbiota composition, reduced microbial diversity, and intestinal domination by bacterial pathogens during allo-HCT are associated with increased risk of bacterial dissemination. fecal sample collected closest in time to stem cell engraftment. patients excluded if no sample was collected within 3 days of this time point. viral LRTI was detected by polymerase chain reaction assay. microbiota was assessed using the fecal sample collected at engraftment. DNA was extracted and purified from each fecal sample. the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was PCR-amplified using modified universal bacterial primers. samples from our cohort were selected in a nested case-control fashion. the concentrations of 3 SCFAs were determined using targeted metabolomics methodology. samples were homogenized using a bead ruptor homogenizer. metabolites were then extracted into n-hexane, diluted 1:10 with additional n-hexane, and quantified by gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry software. analysis time began at the time of engraftment and continued until up to 180 days post-HCT. potential predictors were assessed using Cox proportional hazards modeling. the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. we determined intestinal microbiota composition at the time of stem cell engraftment. patients were excluded if no sample was collected within 3 days. microbiota was assessed using the fecal sample collected at engraftment. DNA was extracted and purified from each fecal sample. DNA was extracted and purified from each fecal sample. we measured the abundance of 61 known bacterial species that produce butyrate. adapted from a comprehensive study that analyzed butyrate-producing pathways in 3184 sequenced bacterial genomes and the microbiomes of 15 healthy volunteers22. samples were then vortexed and heated to 65\u00b0C for 1 hour. metabolites were then extracted into n-hexane, diluted 1:10 with additional n-hexane, and quantified by gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry. fecal samples taken at the time of hematopoietic stem cell engraftment yielded a total of 10 955 300 high-quality 16S rRNA gene sequences. high relative abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria (>1% of total sequences) was maintained in 69 (19.2%) patients. butyrate-producing bacteria were absent (0% of total sequences) in 144 (40.0%) patients.
