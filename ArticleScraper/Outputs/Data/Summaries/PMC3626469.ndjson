{"summary": "the issue of self-sufficiency in haemotherapies has been part of the debate on blood supply policy for the past 40 years. as blood systems in emerging countries develop in tandem with clinical practice needs, the question of the optimal path to sufficiency is crucial. if plasma collection is controlled by a national authority, there will be domestic control over both the quality of the donor-screening procedures and the collection and processing of plasma. if good donor-screening measures are applied to altruistic donors, it is probable that the quality of the plasma will be superior to that obtained from remunerated donors. if a blood-borne pathogen emerges in another country, there will be time in Canada to take precautionary action. a traveller from the east7 was severely affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) this shows that modern life does not permit much \u201ctime.... to take precautionary action\u201d. the UK had to abandon its commitment to self-sufficiency with the emergence of variant Creutzfeld-Jacob disease and its possible penetration into the blood donor pool. there is no evidence that plasma collection for entry into the global supply chain is affecting the concurrent collection of other haemotherapies such as blood and cellular components. countries such as Germany, Austria and the USA, which permit a pluralistic system, are among the highest blood collectors worldwide. the extreme proponents of self-sufficiency are reluctant to consider the effects on patients and give primacy to ethical issues around donors. we propose that primacy in any area of health care delivery should be accorded to the patient who needs access to therapies to alleviate the suffering resulting from the arbitrary misfortunes imposed by nature. the globalisation of the blood industry is further reflected in its regulation through standards and principles established by the two main regulatory bodies, the FDA and the EMA. proponents of the self-sufficiency policy overlook the difficulties which national authorities face when responsible for the overviewing and assurance of such a system. the assumption that domestic donors are safer than overseas ones can be dangerous in countries where there is a high endemic rate of a particular infection. reliance on a domestic supply is no guarantee of safety from emerging infectious agents. in a globalised world, reliance on a domestic supply is no guarantee of safety from emerging infectious agents. the ethical dimension The self-sufficiency debate gets interwoven with the question of donor motivation. the use of plasma collected in emerging countries has been stopped through the globalisation of the industry. there is no evidence that plasma collection is affecting the concurrent collection of other haemotherapies such as blood and cellular components. countries such as the Czech Republic, which has instituted a similar system, are among the highest blood collectors worldwide. there is an ethical dimension to the self-sufficiency debate which does merit further examination. the extreme proponents of self-sufficiency are reluctant to consider the effects on patients. it seems that the extreme proponents of self-sufficiency are reluctant to consider the effects on patients. the globalisation of the blood industry is further reflected in its regulation through standards and principles established by the FDA and the EMA. the globalisation of the blood industry is further reflected in its regulation through standards and principles established by the two main regulatory bodies, the FDA and the EMA. the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus in the donor population makes the spread of AIDS through blood a continuing problem. an official policy of plasma product self-sufficiency through voluntary blood donations did not prevent the spread of hepatitis agents into the chronically transfused population. in a globalised world, reliance on a domestic supply is no guarantee of safety from emerging infectious agents. the voluntary blood sector often have an economic value, such as days off work11 and tax benefits12. the other ethical aspect emanating from this issue involves the possibility of depleting a local/national/regional blood supply through the \u201cpoaching\u201d of donors by extraneous agencies such as plasma collection and fractionation companies. the use of plasma collected in emerging countries has been stopped through the globalisation of the industry. there is an ethical dimension to the self-sufficiency debate which does merit further examination. the extreme proponents of self-sufficiency are reluctant to consider the effects on patients and give primacy to ethical issues around donors. the trade of plasma and intermediate fractions is an established feature of both \u201cfor profit\u201d and \u201cnon-profit\u201d blood systems. the globalisation of the blood industry is further reflected in its regulation through standards and principles established by the two main regulatory bodies, the FDA and the EMA. a number of products it claims are drivers of sufficiency in haemotherapies. they include whole blood and red blood cells recovered either from whole blood or by apheresis. a drop in red cell issues of 26.4% over 1998\u20132008 was absorbed without reported adverse clinical outcomes. the WHO has proposed a minimum collection rate of 10 units per 1,000 population for african countries25. social market health care providers such as australia, canada and the uk now average 33 units per 1,000 population and deliver similar health care outcomes. IG usage varies greatly between countries with a similar health care status. a continuing assertion that IG is used in the absence of evidence does itself lack an evidence base. it is difficult to understand the constant mantra regarding \u201coff-label\u201d use. the national blood service enforces a strict gate-keeping role for the issue of the product. the current consumption of IG in this system is 120 g/1,000 population. the top indications are shown36,37. the latent clinical demand for IG for this condition alone is estimated at 44 g per 1,000 population. this level exceeds the total IG usage of many countries in Europe. this level exceeds the level used for common variable immune deficiency in the u.s. a population can generate 120 g from 30 L of plasma collected per 1,000 population. this volume of plasma should be able to generate 6,000 IU of FVIII. estimates for other products will confirm that amounts of albumin, other coagulation factors, alpha 1 antitrypsin, etc. can be produced from this volume. global plasma supply Table II lists the world\u2019s top plasma procurement countries47. it may be observed that the 30 L/1,000 population specified earlier is attained by only four countries. this level and mode of procurement requires donor compensation to collect the volumes required. apheresis collection is capable of generating significantly higher volumes of source plasma, depending on the regulatory requirements in the country of collection. the most important country, the USA, mandates a maximum of two collections/week, giving a hypothetical collection rate of about 800 mL/donor per year. this implies that 83 L can be collected per year, but this rate is rarely attained, as shown by the fact that 22 million collections came from 1 million donors in 2010. based on plasma recovery from whole blood is fraught with problems, principally the inevitable and eventual wastage of red cells. no blood system in the world is remotely close to this, and neither does it have to be. current clinical needs indicate that 35\u201340 red cell units/1,000 population are sufficient. a drop in red cell issues of 26.4% over 1998\u20132008 in the UK\u2019s blood services was absorbed without reported adverse clinical outcomes. the blood collection rates of high income countries average 36.4 units per 1,000 population23. the WHO has proposed a minimum collection rate of 10 units per 1,000 population for african countries25. the WHO\u2019s recent report seems to be denying this vulnerable population access to blood collected through routes other than those that the report endorses. we suggest that discussions regarding ethics and principle should not take precedence over the grim clinical reality posed in environments such as sub-Saharan Africa. the Australian system reimburses both domestic and imported IG through a single payer (government) the current (2009\u201310) annual consumption of IG in this system is 120 g/1,000 population. the latent clinical demand for IG for this condition is estimated at 44 g per 1,000 population. this level exceeds the total IG usage of many countries in Europe. this level exceeds the level used for common variable immune deficiency in Australia and the USA. a population can generate 120 g from 30 L of plasma collected per 1,000 population. this volume of plasma should be able to generate 6,000 IU of FVIII. this is close to estimates of the optimal level supplied if access to product was unrestricted29. global plasma supply table II lists the world\u2019s top plasma procurement countries47. it may be observed that the 30 L/1,000 population specified earlier is attained by only four countries. this level and mode of procurement requires donor compensation to collect the volumes required. plasma is used for fractionation into products for the domestic market through arrangements between the plasma collector and a single fractionator. this is the case for most of the plasma collected in the top collecting countries. the world supply of plasma products is heavily dependent on these countries. a policy based on plasma recovery from whole blood is fraught with problems. no blood system in the world is remotely close to this, and neither does it have to be. the iron deficiency imposed on whole blood donors adds to the ethical unacceptability. self-sufficiency in unfrozen blood and blood components for transfusion purposes is sensible. the reality of recipients of plasma proteins being dependent on plasma from the big producers means restricting products from these sources imposes limitations on the treatment of patients. the UK followed the principle of self-sufficiency until the entire UK plasma supply was banned after the enormous development of bovine spongiform encephalopathy. access to the global market of plasma products is essential to meet these needs. this market is heavily dependent on the collection and economic policies of a handful of countries. such an expansion in capacity frequently gets entangled in the \u201cselfishness\u201d insufficiency situation in many countries. sufficiency of fresh haemotherapies appears well covered through the established donor paradigm drawing on individuals embedded in social groups. excluding donors in other parts of Maslow\u2019s pyramid15, such as family and replacement donors, will lead to insufficiency in badly needed blood. the key safety issues have been shown to be reflective of donation frequency rather than donor status60,61. social and economic structures reflected in other groups will lead to insufficiency in badly needed blood. even in paid donor systems, the key safety issues have been shown to be reflective of donation frequency rather than donor status60,61. a balanced and optimal route to collecting the raw material, avoiding wastage and harm to both donor and patient is necessary. sick."}
