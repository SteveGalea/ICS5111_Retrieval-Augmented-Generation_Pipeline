{"summary": "HTNV is a member of the enveloped Bunyaviridae family. the large (L) segment encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the medium (M) segment encodes two surface glycoproteins (Gn and Gc), and the small (S) segment encodes the nucleocapsid protein (NP) at present, the pathogenesis of HFRS is still unclear. 3, CXCL10 induces chemotaxis, apoptosis, cell growth inhibition, and angiostasis [6]. the elevated level of CXCL10 has been found to be correlated with the development and severity of these infectious diseases. study subjects and sample collection Enrolled in this study were 121 hospitalized patients with HTNV infection from 2009 to 2011. the clinical diagnosis was confirmed by detection of IgM antibodies to HTNV in the patients' serum specimens. HTNV control was prepared by subjecting HTNV to Co 60 radiation (1 104 Gy) virus allowed to adsorb to HUVECs at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of approximately 1 in serum-free EGM maintenance medium for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. after 48 h postinfection, over 90% of HUVECs expressed viral nucleocapsid protein in the cytoplasm. pRL-TK plasmids were transfected with 0.4 g of each CXCL10 promoter reporter constructs and 5 ng of the pRL-TK plasmids using lipofectamine (lipo) 2000 as manufacturer's protocol. the transfection efficiency was normalized by Renilla luciferase activity in each sample. d overnight at 4\u00b0C with antibodies specific to FLAG tag from Sigma, USA; TLR3, MDA-5, and IRF7 from Epitomics, USA; RIG-I, p65, p-IB, p-Ikk, p-IRF7, -tubulin, and Histone H3 from Cell Signaling Technology, USA. the membranes were washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody or HR hUVECs infected with HTNV for 48 h were cross-linked using 1% formaldehyde at RT for 10 min. cells were scraped into a conical tube and sonicated to shear the chromatins. the sonicated chromatins were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with gently shaking. a minimum of 100,000 cells were acquired on a BD FACS Calibur Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and analyzed using Flowjo software. a P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. cells and Virus Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were prepared by the method described before [22]. HTNV strain 76\u2013118 was propagated on Vero E6 cells. quantitative analysis of mRNA expression was done by quantitative Real-time PCR using the SYBR Green detection method. the specific primers for each gene were shown in the supporting information table S2. each gene was normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH. the transfection of the siRNA into HUVECs was performed using lipo 2000 following the manufacturer's protocol. the validity and efficiency of the siRNA was identified by determining the mRNA and protein levels of corresponding target genes after transfecting the siRNA into HUVECs. biotin-labeled oligonucleotides were synthesized with the following sequences, for NF-B1 site, (5\u2032-CATGGGACTTCCCCAGGAACAGC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCTGTTTTCCTGGGGAAGTCCCATG-3\u2032) and for ISRE site (5\u2032-ATGTTTTGGAAACCTAATTC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GAATTAGGTTTCCTCT-3\u2032) DNA-chromatin-antibody complexes were collected with protein G agarose beads. then, the DNA was purified and subjected to PCR amplification. PBMCs of HFRS were isolated and resuspended at a concentration of 107cells/mL in flow buffer. increased CXCL10 levels in HFRS patients' sera is positively correlated with HFRS severity. increased CXCL10 levels in viral loads >1500 copies/mL group were significantly higher than those in viral loads 1500 copies/mL group. serum CXCL10 levels were positively correlated with blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Crea) and white blood cells. patients with viral loads >1500 copies/mL had significant higher CXCL10 levels than those with viral loads 1500 copies/mL (***P 0.001). the percentage of CXCR3+ cells in all the CD14+ subsets in PBMCs was indicated in each graph. HTNV Infection Activates TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA-5 Pathways ELISA detection demonstrated that the secretion of CXCL10 was most robust after the HUVECs was transfected with 5 g/mL poly. HTNV infection activates TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA-5 signaling pathways. mock HTNV infection and R848 treatment for 48 h failed to raise expression of CXCL10. NF-B1 and IRF7 upregulate CXCL10 expression. p65 or IRF7 increased markedly after HTNV infection. knockdown of p65 or IRF7 impaired induction of CXCL10. p65 and IRF7 were translocated from cytosol to nucleus after HTNV infection. phosphorylation of NF-B1 and IRF7 could be detected at 24 h post infection (p.i) and 48 h p.i. p65 and IRF7 translocate to nucleus and bind to promoter after HTNV infection. p65 and IRF7 induced the nuclear translocation of p65 and IRF7. Lysates were also immunoblotted using anti-tubulin or antihistone H3 (H3) as loading controls. the input DNA and the positive (anti-polymerase antibody) and the negative control (normal mouse IgG) were used to verify the reliability of ChIP assay. a 177-bp DNA fragment containing NF-B site and a 200-bp DNA fragment containing ISRE site were amplified. increased CXCL10 level in HFRS patients' sera is positively correlated with HFRS severity. data were means SE (NC, n = 36; HFRS, n = 121). ***P 0.001, acute or convalescent phase versus NC. values were statistically different between normal control and HFRS patients in acute phase and between HFRS patients in acute phase. expression level of CXCR3 increases highly in acute phase of HFRS. TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA-5, the sensors of viral dsRNA, were upregulated after HTNV infection for 48 h. the protein levels of TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA-5 were all elevated with the extension of the infection duration. NF-B1 and IRF7 upregulate CXCL10 expression. truncated siRNA specific to TLR3, RIG-I, or MDA-5, versus siNC treated cells. luciferase activity 48 h after transfection significantly reduced the CXCL10 transcription activity. p65 and IRF7 translocated from cytosol to nucleus after HTNV infection. phosphorylation of NF-B1 and IRF7 could be detected at 24 h post-HTNV infection (p.i) and 48 h p.i. the positive mobility shifts for both NF-B1 and IRF7 binding oligonucleotides were observed only when the oligonucleotides were incubated with the nuclear extracts of HTNV-infected (24 and 48 h p.i) p65 and IRF7 translocate to nucleus and bind to CXCL10's promoter after HTNV infection. ChIP assay also documented that p50, p65, and IRF7 bound directly to the promoter. at 48 h post-HTNV infection, both a 177-bp DNA fragment and a 200-bp DNA fragment containing the NF-B1 site and ISRE site in the CXCL10 promoter can be amplified successfully. the contradictory findings of CXCL10's role in either protecting or promoting infection may depend on the host immune status and genetic background. the higher CXCL10 level in the acute phase of HFRS is correlated significantly with the HFRS severity-indicating clinical parameters. this is good proof that the production of CXCL10 is correlated with the replication of the HTNV (Figure 1(d)). the mechanism for the induction of CXCL10 during HTNV infection is still unknown. the results of the transfection of poly (I:C) suggest that the CXCL10 could be induced by dsRNA, which may be the replicative intermediate generated during HTNV replication. mock viruses, which lose their ability in replication, fail to activate the expression of CXCL10. the contents of CXCL10 (10 kDa) in HFRS patients' serum drop to the normal level after the hemodialysis treatment. the patients suffering from a severe or critical HFRS have to be treated by hemodialysis [5] to remove the low molecular weight proteins, such as cytokines and chemokines. but hemodialysis has some serious side effects, such as bleeding, hypotension, infection, and anemia. the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper."}
