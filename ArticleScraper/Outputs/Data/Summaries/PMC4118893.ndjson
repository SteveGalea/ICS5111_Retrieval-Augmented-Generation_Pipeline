{"summary": "influenza virus-borne bio-particles are discharged from an infected person through coughing and transmitted to uninfected person(s) but whether influenza virus particles are directly transmitted to the target host as large droplets or through inhalation by the host as small airborne particles remains controversial. the system cough collection developed in this study. the system is portable, even on ones back (D), and can be easily used in many situations, especially at bedside (E). the system is portable, even on ones back (D), and can be easily used in many situations, especially at bedside (E). the connected sampler was set at a constant airflow rate of 8.0 m3/h. the pumping duration was from 1 min before the start of coughing and continued until at least 1 min after the last cough. samples were aliquoted and then assessed using a plaque assay. remaining samples were stored at 80\u00b0C until quantification of viral gene copy number. swabs were vigorously washed in MEM transport medium. RNA was extracted in 80 L of RNAse-free water according to manufacturer's instructions. the RNA solution was concentrated using a freeze-drying system. the total amount of extracted RNA was used for complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis. dissolved membrane specimens were assessed for active viruses using a conventional plaque assay [14] within 1 h after collection. dissolved membrane specimens were assessed for active viruses using a conventional plaque assay [14]. patients were asked to cough voluntarily approximately 20 times at their own pace and without great effort into the cone entrance toward the gelatin membrane filter. the connected sampler was set at a constant airflow rate of 8.0 m3/h, which is the maximum pumping rate according to the manufacturer. the allantoic fluid containing the viruses was harvested and atomized in simulation experiments using an electric compressor nebulizer (NE-C16; Omron, Kyoto, Japan) the gelatin membrane was dissolved in 10 mL of MEM and treated with 10 g/mL of collagenase (Collagenase S-1, Nitta Gelatin, Osaka, Japan) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and ultra-centrifuged at 125,000 a standard curve was generated from 10-fold serial dilutions of the RNA from the M1 cDNA of influenza virus strain A/Aichi/2/68. dissolved membrane specimens containing viruses of the coughs were the serially diluted 10-fold with MEM and inoculated onto MDCK cells. the diluted specimens were assessed for active viruses using a conventional plaque assay [14] within 1 h after collection. experiments to simulate human coughing were performed using a nebulizer. size distribution patterns of the particles were confirmed to be mostly resembled between the mist of the nebulizer and human coughs. control experiments with mist particles generated from a nebulizer were drawn directly into the gelatin filter membrane, with or without a hollow paper tube to guide the mist to the membrane (A) the collection of the particles through the cone-shaped device to guide particles expelled through a cough. c Percentage of viral load on the gelatin membrane to that of collection when the nebulizer was set close to the membrane. f The cone-shaped, megaphone-like device of 50 cm in length was connected with the gelatin membrane filter and the nebulizer was set at the entrance of the device. the average patient age was 25.4 10.5 years (range, 5\u201367 years), 88% of the samples were from 18\u201338-year-old patients. none of the patients had significant health problems. forty-five (80%) cases were infected with influenza A(H1) virus, 5 (9%) with A(H3) and 6 (11%) with A(H1N1)pdm09. the highest viral content was found in a sample obtained at day 3 of illness in a patient with the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. the highest viral content was found in a sample obtained at day 3 of illness in a patient with the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir or zanamivir at the time of cough collection were plotted together in respect to the status of receiving antiviral treatment. data from days 2 and 3 of symptom onset were plotted together in respect to the status of receiving antiviral treatment. the virus detection rate of these cases was similar to those of both untreated and sufficiently treated cases. however, when the medians were compared, these short-term treated cases showed apparently smaller viral loads. the viral loads of vaccinated cases were lower than those of the unvaccinated cases. open and closed circles represent unvaccinated and vaccinated cases. cough samples were collected from patients by voluntary coughing. we considered coughing by non-symptomatic patients, by e.g., due to allergy, physiological stimulations, or causes other than influenza infection. a cough sample (plot numbers 4\u20136) did not necessarily correspond with the highest viral load in a throat swab. our results suggest that the viral load in the cough samples may have been affected by the status of the symptom of cough. the viral load in the throat swab was calculated from the viral load of the transport medium. a high viral load in the throat swab or oral secretion while very low or undetectable in the cough sample. the virus in the cough might not have originated from either the throat wall or oral cavity. the collection system was equipped with a portable air sampler unit. experiments to simulate human coughing were performed using a nebulizer. size distribution patterns of the particles were confirmed to be mostly resembled between the mist of the nebulizer and human coughs. less concentrated viral fluid (104 PFU/mL) was atomized (Table 1). control experiments with mist particles generated from a nebulizer were drawn directly into the gelatin filter membrane, with or without a hollow paper tube to guide the mist to the membrane (A) the collection of particles through the cone-shaped device to guide particles expelled through a cough (B) c Average copy number of the influenza A M1 gene in the gelatin membrane. d Percentage of viral load on the gelatin membrane to that of collection when the nebulizer was set close to the

forty-five (80%) cases were infected with influenza A(H1) virus, 5 (9%) with A(H3) and 6 (11%) with A(H1N1)pdm09. the highest viral content was found in a sample obtained at day 3 of illness in a patient with the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection. the results were analyzed from different perspectives depending on the characteristics of individual cases and initially graphed with the days of illness along the abscissa. 61%) received antiviral treatments with the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir or zanamivir at the time of cough collection. we plotted the data of days 2 and 3 together because there was no clustering of vaccination or antiviral treatment status among cases over these days. we analyzed cases that did not receive antiviral treatment. the viral loads of vaccinated cases were lower than those of the unvaccinated cases. the virus detection rate of these cases was similar to those of both untreated and sufficiently treated cases. however, the sufficiently treated cases showed apparently smaller viral loads. viral loads in coughs of antiviral-untreated influenza patients (A) and those of all cases including antiviral-treated cases (B) open and closed circles represent unvaccinated and vaccinated cases, respectively. the highest viral load in a cough sample did not necessarily correspond with the highest viral load in a throat swab (plot numbers 4\u20136) the viral load in the cough samples may have been affected by the status of the symptom of cough. the viral load in the throat swab samples from cases with and without cough symptom were compared. a high viral load in the throat swab or oral secretion while very low or undetectable in the cough sample, and vice versa. in some cases from whom the virus was collected from a cough, at least in cases with the highest viral load with very low viral loads in the throat swab or oral samples. rate of our system was estimated at approximately 10%, suggesting that the actual viral load in a cough may be 10-fold greater than our actual measured amount. however, we noticed a reflection flow in some actual cases. a stronger cough flow might collide against the inside wall, filter membrane, and/or internal air mass of the device and rebound, or flushed out the internal air mass. but the result of our preliminary experiments showed that the spill over caused by the outward flow might not affect the result. the highest viral load was 2240 copies/cough among the 56 samples. the highest viral load was 2240 copies/cough among the 56 samples. a possible factor that may play a role in spread of infection is the existence of the so-called \u201csuper spreader\u201d proposed in epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome [19] and influenza [21], [21]. correlation analyses on viral loads between cough and throat swab or oral secretion samples showed that the viral load in a cough may not necessarily reflect those of a throat swab or oral secretion. this suggests that the virus in the collected coughs, at least for cases with significant disparities in the viral load level between the two types of samples, may be mixed with cough air flow at anatomically deeper sites in the respiratory tract. the air inside a closed 2 m3 chamber was set at about 20% RH. the air was cleaned up using an air fan unit with a high-efficiency particulate air filter unit. the data of human cough are presented as absolute particle counts and standard error rang per single cough of the average of five subjects. the viral load/cough is plotted on the ordinate and the days of illness during sample collection on the abscissa. table S1 Demographics of virus-detected and undetected cases."}
