{"summary": "vaccines have successfully reduced the spread of diseases and mitigated mortality associated with infectious agents such as diphtheria, tetanus, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and hepatitis B. novel technologies and administration routes remain one of the main focuses in the vaccinology field. the development of novel vaccine delivery platforms implementing the elicitation of pathogen- or toxin-specific SIgA, as well as systemic IgG, is pivotal to improve vaccine effectiveness [10]. the most well-studied vaccine delivery platforms capable of eliciting both mucosal and systemic immunities are edible or intradermal vaccine formulations. antigen-experienced B cells migrate to distant effector regions where they differentiate into plasma cells capable of secreting dimeric or polymeric IgA molecules. erroneous mucosal vaccine formulation could induce a Treg-based tolerogenic response instead of Th17-mediated protective immunity. in the context of edible-based vaccine immunizations, it will be important to consider the characteristics of the GIT. several factors, including proteolytic enzymes, acidic pH, bile salts, and limited permeability, may hinder the induction of a protective immune response [10]. a focus of ongoing studies aimed at improving immunogenicity [18]. plant-based vaccines are characterized by improved safety relative to traditional recombinant vaccine platforms. lyophilized leaves have shown their advantages over fresh materials such as long-term stability, higher antigen content, and lower microbial contamination. plant-based vaccines are characterized by improved safety relative to traditional recombinant vaccine platforms. lyophilized lettuces expressing soluble antigen were stored for up to 15 months at room temperature without showing antigen degradation. fresh leaves contained up to 6000 cfu/g microbes when plated on growing media. plastids are not suitable for production of antigens that require glycosylation for proper folding. transgenic seeds represent a constant resource to grow transgenic plants. expression in stable transformed crop plants suffers from low yields, typically less than 1% of TSP [36]. agrobacterium or viral vectors is robust, quick, and easy to manipulate. green algae have all the positive characteristics of plant systems. biomass accumulation is extremely fast and can be used in its entirety. biomass accumulation is extremely fast and can be used in its entirety. algae can be lyophilized and stored at room temperature for up to 20 months without losing antigenic efficacy. algae cell wall assures bioencapsulation effect, as it was proven to prevent antigen degradation by enzymes of the GIT. there are no algae-based vaccines currently in clinical trials; however, preclinical formulations against human papillomavirus are under development. the baculovirus expression system is not limited only to cultured cells. insect larvae or pupae can be used for protein production. baculovirus is unable to replicate in vertebral animals, it can be considered a GRAS. two clinical trials have been developed: GS-4774 for HBV treatment and GI-5005 for hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment. despite positive results obtained from phase 1 [72], the second phase conducted in virally suppressed, noncirrhotic patients did not show a clinical benefit. lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are Gram-positive, nonsporulating, and nonpathogenic bacteria that have been used for decades for the production and preservation of food as well as for therapeutic heterologous gene expression. these bacteria have been considered potential candidates as mucosal vaccine vectors. the production of high levels of specific IgA and systemic IgG after immunization with bacillus spores expressing toxin A peptide repeat was reported. a specific Th2-based cell-mediated immune response was elicited after the immunization with Csenolase-expressing Bacillus subtilis. another study reported a Th1/Th2 immune response elicited after the immunization with Csenolase-expressing Bac GEMs are safer adjuvants compared to others because of their nature. they retain the inflammatory properties of live bacteria and enhanced immune responses of the influenza subunit vaccine. this immune response confers protection against the influenza virus [93] the delivery of an adjuvant (GEMs) and an antigen together has been correlated with enhanced vaccine immunogenicity. the absence of recombinant DNA avoids its dissemination into the environment. however, the inability of GEMs to colonize any compartment does not allow the reduction of the number of vaccine doses. Langerhans cells are a specific DC subset that migrate into the lymph node following antigen capture and aids in the initiation of an adaptive immune response. these cells are also efficiently stimulated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) using an array of germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRR), including toll-like receptors (TLR) and langerin (CD207) [100]. intradermal vaccination designates the delivery of an antigen directly into the dermis with a syringe, a needle, a microneedle, or a pressure injector. the standard intradermal immunization technique was invented by the French physician Charles Mantoux in 1910, while he was developing the tuberculin test. intradermal vaccination limits the transfer of vaccine components to the blood circulation and the risk of septic shock. it has been reported that the HBV vaccine fails to yield seroconversion in 3-5% of recipients. however, a significant improvement was observed following intradermal vaccination. novel dried solid microneedle devices are eliciting comparable immunogenicity to intramuscular-administered vaccines. the elicitation of pathogen- or toxin-specific SIgA plays a pivotal role in protecting mucosal surfaces from microbe adhesion and toxin activities. antigen-experienced B cells migrate to distant effector regions where they differentiate into plasma cells capable of secreting dimeric or polymeric IgA molecules that are transported into the intestinal lumen as SIgA [10, 16] development of rationally designed vaccines starts with the identification of the gene encoding for the protective antigenic protein(s) an erroneous mucosal vaccine formulation could induce a Treg-based tolerogenic response instead of Th17-mediated protective immunity [17]. this potential shortcoming can be circumvented using several strategies, including incorporation of an appropriate adjuvant in the vaccine formulation or using sufficiently high doses of antigen to promote induction of effector rather than regulatory cells. Medicago recently completed a phase II clinical trial using a plant-derived, virus-like particle (VLP) quadrivalent influenza vaccine. the idea that plants could serve as a delivery vehicle led to their use for oral vaccination in the early 1990s. plant vaccines would likely have a low production cost and could be easily scaled up. some studies using lyophilized leaves have shown their advantages over fresh materials such as long-term stability, higher antigen content, and lower microbial contamination. lyophilized lettuces expressing soluble antigen (PA; protective antigen from Bacillus anthracis) were successfully stored for 15 months at room temperature without showing antigen degradation. plastids are not suitable for antigens that require glycosylation for proper folding or those antigens in which a protective immune response requires glycan recognition. plastids are not suitable for production of antigens that require glycosylation for proper folding or those antigens in which a protective immune response requires glycan recognition.

GI-5005 was used in combination with Peg-IFN/ribavirin. but data on efficacy have not been published yet. recombinant foreign antigens have been considered mucosal vaccine vectors. this delivery system can confer protection against antigen degradation. recombinant LAB can activate both innate and adaptive immune responses. a different carrier system based on nonrecombinant Lactococcus lactis bacteria was recently developed. this system, called Gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM), is composed of the rigid peptidoglycan cell wall of the bacterium resulting in a nonliving particle that preserves the shape and the size as the original bacterium. the use of GEMs was further examined in a study investigating the immune response elicited by intranasal delivery of further studies will assess if this immune response confers protection against the influenza virus [93]. the data support the potential of GEMs as safe vaccine delivery vehicles and their ability to elicit systemic antibodies. the application of microneedle technology overcomes the skin permeation barrier imposed by the stratum corneum and facilitates antigen delivery. the efficacy of this new microneedle-based immunization approach is due to the presence of several types of immune cells (such as DCs, T lymphocytes, NK cells, macrophages, and mast cells) in the epithelium. intradermal vaccination designates the delivery of an antigen directly into the dermis with a syringe, a needle, a microneedle, or a pressure injector. the standard intradermal immunization technique was invented by the French physician Charles Mantoux in 1910 while developing the tuberculin test. intradermal vaccination has been demonstrated to be very safe. novel devices involve the use of needles with a smaller size than the usual. it is possible to bypass the corneous layer of epidermis by creating transient micropores. fda approved the trivalent inactivated intradermal influenza vaccine for use in adults 18-64 years of age for use during the 2012-2013 season. but similar to intramuscular vaccines, the formulation of these approved intradermal vaccines is liquid and thus still dependent on the cold chain and administered through a syringe. conclusions Infectious diseases represent a global concern, and the most effective strategy to reduce them is vaccination. edible vaccines, triggering the GALT, and intradermal approaches, involving Langerhans cells, are able to elicit both a mucosal and a systemic immune response. the increased knowledge of these approaches has led to the progression of many preclinical studies and several promising clinical trials. there are no FDA-approved compounds for edible vaccination. new emerging technologies like nanoparticles (NPs) could help to control antigen bioavailability to avoid mucosal tolerance. NPs are particles with a mean size of 10-100 nm (up to 2000 nm)"}
