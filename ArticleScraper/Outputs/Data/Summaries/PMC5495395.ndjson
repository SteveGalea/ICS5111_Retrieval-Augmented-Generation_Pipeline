{"summary": "the eggshell is a highly ordered bio-ceramic (about 5 g calcium) of fused calcite crystalline cones. the shell gland epithelium provides antimicrobial protection for both hen and egg. PP IX is an immediate precursor of heme and a major component of brown eggshell pigment. hundreds of genes that are differentially expressed between juvenile and mature laying hens have been identified. the expression of genes associated with epithelial differentiation and tissue remodelling may vary with different levels of estrogen secretion in the presence or absence of an egg. nicarbazin is one of the various factors that causes lower production and/or deposition of PP IX into eggshell. no studies have been performed to identify suitable reference genes for the normalization of quantitative PCR (qPCR) gene expression data in the shell gland of chickens. the most commonly used housekeeping genes, such as ACTB, TUBB, and GAPDH have been selected as generic reference genes. however, ample evidence has shown that the expression of these genes may not be constant across a range of experimental conditions and tissues under investigation. geNorm eliminates the genes sequentially and thus a differentially expressed gene does not affect the ultimate outcomes from the analysis. good reference genes have an M 0.5 and CV (Coefficient of variance) 0.2, while M values up to 1 are acceptable for more difficult samples. the most stable reference genes are the ones with the lowest SD values and highest coefficients of correlation with the BKI [26] bestKeeper also uses a statistical algorithm wherein the Pearson correlation coefficient for each candidate reference gene pair is calculated along with probability of correlation significance of the pair. the results of the study provide a set of reference genes that are expressed in a relatively constant level for all the birds sampled at different time-points of eggshell formation and in response to treatment with nicarbazin. the experimental setup was approved by the University of New England, Animal Ethics Approval Committee under Authority No. AEC15-022. ten reference genes were selected from literature published for chickens and other animals. extracellular fluid volume ACTB -actin cytoplasm, membranes cytoskeletal structural protein, nucleotide, and ATP binding B2M Beta 2-microglobulin Golgi membrane, plasma membrane, early endosome membrane, protein binding CA2 Carbonic anhydrase 2 cytoplasm, cell membrane catalyses reversible hydration of carbon dioxide CST3 Cystatin C extracellular as an inhibitor of cysteine proteinases GAPDH Gly CGTG 194 63 NM_001001750.1 [33] R: TCTCGTGCTCCACCTTGC CA2 F: TCAAACCAAGGGGAAACAAGC 99 63 NM_205317.1 this study R: GTAGTCAGGGTA CST3 F: ATGAGAACGACGAGCTTG 130 63 NM_205500.2 this study R: ATTCCAGACACGAGCTGCC GAPDH F: GAGGGTAGGAATGG HM reference genes at three different time-points of eggshell formation Laying hens and tissue sampling Effect of time-points on reference gene expression. hens were euthanized by CO2 and shell gland tissue was excised within 2 minutes of the euthanization. hens were divided into groups in such a way that the average L* values and egg weight (g) were not significantly different among groups. the hens were divided into groups in such a way that the average L* values and egg weight (g) were not significantly different among groups. RNA was extracted using TRIsure (Bioline, Australia) according to manufacturer's instructions. elution of RNA from spin column with 50 L of RNase-free water was repeated twice. RNA integrity was examined using 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. the 0.1\u20132 Kb RNA Ladder (AmbionTM, Australia) was used as a marker. only RNA showing two distinct 28S and 18S bands without smear was regarded integrate and used in downstream qPCR assay. a melting step was conducted to assess the specificity of PCR amplification. qPCR data of the genes were processed further when the PCR amplification efficiency was in a range of 90 to 105%. linear correlation coefficient R2 > 0.980 were considered of high standard. geNorm calculates a pairwise variation (geNorm V) based on Vn/n+1 and a higher value indicates a significant effect of additional gene on data normalization. the benefit of using an extra (n+1)th reference gene is limited as soon as the Vn/n+1 value drops below the 0.15 threshold. primers were blasted against the NCBI database using BLASTN, Ensemble Chicken Galgal4 and UCSC\u2019s chicken (Gallus gallus) Genome Browser Gateway. primer pairs with specific amplifications and high efficiency were used in the optimisation. only primer pairs with specific amplifications and high efficiency were used in the optimisation. component of the 60S subunit encodes a ribosomal protein Table 2. forward (F) and reverse (R) primer sequences of selected candidate reference and target genes. 20 hens out of a flock of 63 Hy-Line Brown laying hens were selected. the hens were 36\u201337 weeks old. the hens were divided into four groups. four groups of hens were sampled based on time-points (post-oviposition time 2, 5, 15 and 23.5 hrs) the hens were euthanized by CO2 and shell gland tissue excised within 2 minutes of the euthanization. 15 hens were fed nicarbazin @100mg/kg of commercial layer diet. the control hens were fed only commercial layer diet. the eggshell colour (L*) and egg weight were recorded for all the hens. the hens were divided into four groups in such a way that the average L* values and egg weight were not significantly different among the selected groups. the hens were euthanized by CO2 and the shell gland tissue was excised within 2 minutes of the euthanization. 15 (5 hens) 23.5 (5 hens) L* value 56.240.99 54.380.98 54.190.89 54.360.28 0.2982 Egg weight (g) 62.813.51 63.952.31 62.961.66 65.651.77 0.8326 Values are mean S.E.

NormFinder and BestKeeper were used to analyse the stability of gene expression. the most stable genes were selected on the basis of the stability of the genes across the three software. the most stable genes were selected on the basis of the stability of the genes. most of the reference genes were highly expressed, with average Cq values between 12 and 22 cycles, except ALB. the expression pattern of all ten reference genes was calculated in the combined dataset of four different time-points (2, 5, 15, 23.5 hr, post-oviposition times) a melting phase at a ramp from 50\u00b0C to 99\u00b0C at 1\u00b0C increment was conducted. a melting phase at a ramp from 50\u00b0C to 99\u00b0C at 1\u00b0C increment was conducted to assess the specificity of PCR amplification. the average expression stabilities (geNorm M) of ten reference genes were within the acceptable range (0.50) that varied from 0.252 (HPRT1) to 0.482 (ACTB) the pairwise variation (geNorm V) also chose HPRT1 and HMBS as the best set of genes to be used for expression data analysis. geNorm ranked HMBS and HPRT1 as the two most stable genes. the pairwise variations (geNorm V) for the control, nicarbazin and both the groups combined were 0.15 (a default cut-off value) the gene ranking was reshuffled and HMBS was ranked as the most stable genes. NormFinder ranked HMBS and RPL4, while the BestKeeper showed HPRT1 and HMBS as the two most stable genes. reshuffling in gene ranking was different but relatively consistent for the first four genes across all the three statistical tools. in the same group, both NormFinder and BestKeeper ranked HMBS and HPRT1 as the most stable reference genes. the overall ranking of the genes falling in middle order was reshuffled following the analyses by all the three statistical software. NormFinder showed HMBS and ALB, while the BestKeeper showed HPRT1 and HMBS as the two most stable reference genes. the stability values of B2M were slightly higher than the cut-off value (geNorm M 0.5; SD 1.0) when the data were analysed. the genes were consistent from the analyses performed by the three programs except B2M when the birds were treated with nicarbazin at three time-points of egg shell formation (birds age 42\u201345 weeks) the geNorm M and SD values of 10 reference genes were graphed to assess the ranking pattern of the genes assigned by three different software. expression levels of ALAS1, CPOX and FECH were changed in terms of the p values when the data were normalized with the two most stable and the two least stable reference genes. the p value of FECH changed from 0.0700 to 0.6134 when the data were normalized with the two least stable reference genes. amplification efficiency of all ten candidate reference genes was between 93% and 101%. amplification efficiencies were 100% for 18S rRNA, 98% for ACTB, 101% for ALB, 93% for B2M, 94% for each of CST3 and GAPDH, 94% for HMBS, 98% for HPRT1 and 94% for RPL4. the amplified products were run on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. the upper (purple) and lower (green) markers act as internal standards. the standard curve (plotting migration time against DNA amplicon size) is then used to calculate DNA fragment sizes for each well from the migration times measured. NormFinder ranked 18S rRNA and RPL4 as the two most stable reference genes. the two most stable reference genes in bestKeeper were 18S rRNA and HPRT1. the expression data were also analysed in geNorm excluding post-oviposition time 2 hours. expression data were also analysed in geNorm excluding post-oviposition time 2 hours. expression data were also analysed in geNorm excluding post-oviposition time 2 hours. the geNorm V values of the pairwise variation of the ten reference genes for the control, nicarbazin and both the groups combined were 0.15 (a default cut-off value) the expression data of time-points and the control hens from time-points and nicarbazin treatment were analysed together with the exclusion of post-oviposition time 2 hours. the gene ranking was reshuffled and HMBS was ranked as the least stable gene.

FECH normalized with the two most stable genes (P = 0.0700); FECH normalized with the two least stable genes (P = 0.6134). for the same gene in the same treatment, a,b across the bars indicate significant differences. the first two most stable genes were under the cut-off value (0.15) in qbase+, geNorm V indicates level of variation in the average values of reference gene stability with the sequential inclusion of the next stable reference gene to the equation Vn/n+1. the process continues until the least stable gene is added (for example, V9/10) HMBS and HPRT1 were the two most stable housekeeping genes. this is the first study to establish a set of stably expressed reference genes in the shell gland of avian species under various treatments. the rankings of the expression stability of the 10 candidate reference genes had similar trends but discrepancies were observed among three different statistical programs, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. there is no consensus as to which software is more powerful in the ranking of candidate reference genes. all of the reference genes except B2M were stably expressed according to the cut-off values of the programs. two most stably expressed genes, HMBS and HPRT1 are recommended for the normalization of gene expression data in the shell gland of chickens."}
