{"summary": "analysis of the magnitudes and distribution of benefits and costs for any given strategy requires that mitigation is considered in three conceptually distinct stages. surveillance obtains critical epidemiological information to decide on the appropriate intervention strategy to reduce or eradicate a disease in Stage III, 'implementation' surveillance is used for early warning when disease (re-)occurs, to detect infection or disease, to measure prevalence or incidence of pathogens or hazards found in animal populations. surveillance can be considered as a scientific, factual tool that informs policy decisions and the allocation of resources for disease control. the cost of resources committed to mitigation should at least be compensated by the value of the resulting recovered outputs. ideally, the net benefits (total output value recovered minus total mitigation costs) should be maximised, thus optimising economic efficiency. the objective of this article is to show how the technical relationships between animal disease surveillance, intervention and mitigation can be integrated as a conceptual framework to guide economic analysis in practical applications. the conceptual framework presented builds on logical reasoning, practical experience and observations of how mitigation processes evolve over time in animal health services. in the'sustainment' stage, the mitigation objective is to keep the free or acceptable status either by preventing an increase in incidence of a pathogen or by eliminating a pathogen quickly when it occurs. early warning may trigger a rapid response to contain an increase in incidence of the pathogen (e.g. disease outbreak) the acceptable status may be a historically free status, freedom from disease, freedom from infection, or contamination of food products maintained below a defined threshold. policy makers also may be aware of certain endemic pathogens, but categorise them as low priority. compliance with international regulations to document disease freedom may facilitate access to foreign markets. the surveillance approach and design chosen may vary over time. changes in external factors such as the international disease situation or environmental or behavioural patterns that facilitate the introduction and spread of a pathogen. endemic pathogens may move up the priority list due to changes in the international disease situation. Surveillance in Stage II mitigation is needed to understand the problem. alternative strategies are assessed taking into account technical, social, economic, institutional and/or management considerations. a decision is made about whether to implement Stage III mitigation or not. surveillance information feeds into technical, social, economic, institutional and/or management considerations that impact on the decision to implement an intervention programme. if Stage II surveillance demonstrates no immediate need to act, decision makers may decide to wait and gather further data to inform decisions about the specific nature of future intervention programmes. there is a wide range of intervention measures available to reduce or eradicate a pathogen. these include culling or medical treatment of diseased animals, vaccination, vector control, promotion of resistant breeds, and deliberate exposure to infected animals to promote natural immunisation. surveillance design needs to be flexible over time depending on pathogen, mitigation target, and progress of the intervention programme. the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 in south-east Asia in the past decade. policy makers recognised the need for multidisciplinary surveillance teams that detect the virus early to limit its spread, clinical effects, and economic costs. many countries that have never had a case of HPAI implemented extensive surveillance system in wild birds and poultry. Vietnam's integrated national operational programme for avian influenza from 2006 to 2010 outlined an intervention programme with four pillars. surveillance activities for HPAI in Vietnam foresaw clinical case reporting, surveys on markets and slaughterhouses. surveillance was conducted to assess vaccination protection and to investigate the cause and implement corrective measures if the results were not satisfactory. baseline survey defined reduction targets for all member states. target was to estimate prevalence of salmonella spp. in commercial large-scale holdings. other targets were to investigate relative sensitivity of faecal and environmental samples, role of vaccination and collect additional epidemiological information. the development of effective vaccines allowed implementation of vaccination campaigns that reduced the number of FMD outbreaks from almost 900,000 in 1951/52 to 34 between 1977 and 1987. in the late 1980s, vaccination was forbidden in Denmark, the UK and Ireland, while the other nine EU member states were still using vaccination. in the late 1980s, vaccination was forbidden in Denmark, the UK and Ireland. ation objective Switzerland aims to sustain its FMD-free status as stipulated in the Swiss Animal Health Ordinance (SR 916.401) a national contingency plan is available that stipulates the response measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak. there are several mobile contingency teams available to cull and dispose of affected animals and clean and disinfect holdings. the economic objective of mitigation is independent of the pathogen, animals and animal-derived products. the three stages are a continuum, the starting point for analysis found anywhere on this mitigation continuum depending on the pathogen in question and the specific disease situation. at the 'implementation' stage, the objective is to reduce the prevalence of a pathogen in relation to a defined target based on epidemiologic, economic or political criteria. the corresponding surveillance is then to inform the choice, timing and scale of intervention measures and to document progress in the light of interventions. after successful intervention the mitigation objective may again revert to the sustained absence of disease. a country, region or zone can declare itself historically or officially free from disease or infection. a country, region or zone can declare itself historically or officially free from disease or infection. a country, region or zone can declare itself historically or officially free from disease or infection. endemic diseases relevant to public health are notifiable but not subject to systematic surveillance. sporadic surveillance data about cases occurring in the population, but the true prevalence is generally not known. endemic pathogens may move up priority list due to changes in disease situation. intervention measures may be pilot-tested to assess effectiveness of putative interventions. national or international surveys are sources for baseline and comparable values for prevalence or incidence of pathogens found in animal populations or along the food chain. sampling design may be probabilistic or non-probabilistic. the focus is on problem resolution, where the planned intervention strategies are implemented to reduce or eradicate a pathogen. the strategy and targets are well-defined, and the elements necessary to support the mitigation process have been taken into account. surveillance and intervention is an essential tool throughout the whole stage and its objective changes over time. the OIE grants official recognition of freedom from bovine spongiform encephalopathy, foot and mouth disease (fMD), rinderpest and contagious bovine pleuropneumonia. it stipulates detailed surveillance requirements to provide evidence for disease freedom. after many years of Stage III mitigation activities the programme may become institutionalised and stagnate in Stage III. the stage I mitigation objective is to sustain the acceptable status. compliance with international regulations to document disease freedom may facilitate access to foreign markets. a country, region or zone can declare itself historically or officially free from disease or infection. some endemic diseases relevant to public health are notifiable but not subject to systematic surveillance. some endemic diseases relevant to public health are notifiable but not subject to systematic surveillance. sporadic surveillance data about cases occurring in the population is notifiable in Switzerland. the acceptable status may be a historically free status, freedom from disease, or contamination of food products maintained below a defined threshold. compliance with international regulations to document disease freedom may facilitate access to foreign markets. a country, region or zone can declare itself historically or officially free from disease or infection. changes in external factors such as the international disease situation may impact on real and perceived risks. a shift from a situation with minimal risk of pathogen incursion or augmentation, and consequently a low level of alert to one where higher vigilance is required. some endemic diseases relevant to public health are notifiable but not subject to systematic surveillance. a. Mitigation objective In Stage II, problem analysis is needed to understand the problem. alternative strategies are assessed taking into account technical, social, economic, institutional and/or management considerations. surveillance information feeds into technical, social, economic, institutional and/or management considerations that impact on the decision to implement an intervention programme. if Stage II surveillance demonstrates no immediate need to act, decision makers may decide to wait and gather further data to inform decisions about the specific nature of future intervention programmes. a range of sampling methods is available, such as random, systematic, stratified, cluster or multi-stage sampling. random sampling implies choosing the sampling unit (e.g. individuals, herds, farms, slaughterhouses, administrative areas) the sample is usually selected on the basis of the accessibility or the purposive judgment of the researcher. surveillance and intervention stage III surveillance provides essential input for programmes established to reduce or eradicate diseases and to enhance food safety. surveillance data can classify animals or holdings as infected or non-infected and thus mark them as intervention subjects. surveillance is also used to monitor the progress and effectiveness of intervention measures. the attainment of the mitigation target defines the endpoint of Stage III. however, after many years of Stage III mitigation activities the programme may become institutionalised and stagnate in Stage III. if decision-makers opt for the transition to Stage I, mitigation activities will focus once again on sustaining an acceptable level of a pathogen. surveillance design needs to be flexible over time depending on pathogen, mitigation target, and progress of the intervention programme. however, after many years of Stage III mitigation activities the programme may become institutionalised and stagnate in Stage III instead of moving to Stage I. the faa implemented an early warning surveillance system for the worldwide integration and exchange of avian influenza information. many countries that have never had a case of HPAI implemented extensive surveillance system in wild birds and poultry. the strategy proved to be successful, as all sporadic HPAI outbreaks in EU member states could be contained within a few months. surveillance was conducted to assess vaccination protection and investigate the cause and implement corrective measures if the results were not satisfactory. transition Vietnam may cease vaccination once the risk of infection has significantly decreased, if surveillance and disease reporting systems manage to detect and investigate all cases of suspected HPAI. the EU decision 2004/665 laid down requirements regarding the sampling frame, laboratory analysis, data collection, analysis and communication. all member states were obliged to submit plans for their national programmes setting out the intervention measures envisaged. the EU regulation 1168/2006 outlines the surveillance scheme necessary to'verify the achievement of the Community target for the reduction of salmonella' despite reluctance among veterinarians and farmers to abandon the vaccination strategy, the EU decided to implement a FMD vaccination ban in 1992. a recurrence of FMD would trigger outbreak control measures as laid down in national contingency plans until the re-declaration of freedom from FMD. there are several mobile contingency teams available to cull and dispose of affected animals. there are clear emergency disease reporting mechanisms in place, a transparent organisation and communication network. the situation would be re-assessed and a change in strategy towards a vaccination policy considered. the situation in Vietnam where HPAI was reported for the first time in 2003 illustrates the consequences of Stage I failure. the current objective of the Vietnamese programme against HPAI H5N1 is the'sustained country-wide elimination of the virus' Vietnam's integrated national operational programme for avian influenza from 2006 to 2010 outlined an intervention programme with four pillars. surveillance activities for HPAI in Vietnam foresaw clinical case reporting, surveys on markets and slaughterhouses to improve knowledge of virus circulation, and mapping of temporal and spatial distribution of wild birds. obliging member states to run national control programmes to reduce salmonella in poultry and pigs. it provided a framework for the definition of targets, the approval of mitigation programmes, and the adoption of rules regarding intervention methods and trade. EU mitigation programme for salmonella in laying hens and related surveillance and intervention measures have passed from Stage II to Stage III. the situation is different for pigs where decisions regarding the setting of control targets are under discussion. a recurrence of FMD would trigger outbreak control measures until the re-declaration of freedom from FMD. a recurrence of FMD would trigger outbreak control measures as laid down in national contingency plans. intervention campaign was assessed and effective vaccines were developed (Stage II) the mitigation programme for FMD in Switzerland that suffered its last FMD outbreak in 1980 illustrates prolonged Stage I sustainment after successful eradication. a national contingency plan is available that stipulates the response measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak. it lays down specific requirements regarding stamping out activities, hygiene, bio-security, cleaning and disinfection, and quarantine for the collection of milk and slaughtering. there are several mobile contingency teams available to cull and dispose of affected animals. a national or regional strategy for animal health, such as the EU's, will contain a mix of stages according to the status of the particular pathogens which are the foci of concern. an economic assessment of HPAI H5N1 mitigation in Vietnam would need to incorporate valuation of all economic consequences at national level due to the benefit losses from disease and the costs of its mitigation. recurrent surveillance expenditures of this kind are expected to be lower than accumulated costs of failing to maintain a situation of exclusion or acceptability with respect to a given pathogen. if Stage I fails, the inevitable result is a switch to a different approach to mitigation. a key economic consideration for all stages is to ascertain the least-cost combinations for surveillance and intervention, and the associated values of output losses thereby potentially avoided. a key economic consideration for all stages is to ascertain the least-cost combinations for surveillance and intervention, and the associated values of output losses. warning systems in Stage I must be able to detect the incursion of a pathogen quickly and must therefore be highly sensitive. the situation is similar for documentation of disease freedom where surveillance needs to detect the incidence or prevalence of disease for a defined level of confidence often stipulated in national or international legislation. all surveillance programmes at one particular stage are likely to show similar characteristics. early warning systems in Stage I must be able to detect the incursion of a pathogen quickly and must therefore be highly sensitive, which is likely to result in high costs. however, more time can be spent to design surveillance programmes that provide fit-for-purpose data to prioritise and plan intervention activities. emergence and spread of highly infectious diseases, such as the recent outbreaks of influenza A virus subtype H1N1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome. the proposed conceptual framework set out above allows integration of the relationship between disease mitigation, a source of economic value, and mitigation resources, a source of economic cost. the formation of groups with similar characteristics may inform other research projects that aim at creating conceptual frameworks relating to surveillance. authors' contributions BH, KH and KS developed the proposed conceptual framework. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
