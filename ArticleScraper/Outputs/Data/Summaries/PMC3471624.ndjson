{"summary": "serum samples from macaques were collected and stored as described (8). ELISA results indicated nucleocapsid protein antibodies against influenza in samples from macaques from Cambodia. antibodies were detected in animals 1\u201310 years of age at the time of sampling. no influenza virus\u2013specific antibodies were detected from the 73 total samples from Gibraltar. monkeys from Gibraltar are less susceptible to infection. a panel of human vaccine strains and avian influenza virus strains was used in the hemagglutination-inhibition assay. not all ELISA-positive serum samples could be subtyped. antibodies against seasonal subtype H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A strains were detected from macaques in Bangladesh, Singapore, Java, and sulawesi.

NSA, no samples available for testing; NA, not applicable for use in vaccine. swabs were immediately placed into viral transport media. we found serologic evidence of infection in several countries, contexts, and macaque species. preliminary real-time reverse transcription PCR results also pointed to the presence of virus in a buccal swab from an adult macaque from Cambodia."}
