{"summary": "human rhinovirus (HRV) infection has been emerged as an important cause of pneumonia and asthma exacerbation. human rhinovirus (HRV) infection has been emerged as an important cause of pneumonia and asthma exacerbation. viral infections are one of the many risk factors associated with wheezing illnesses and exacerbation of respiratory diseases. human rhinovirus have been classified into two genetic species: HRV-A (including 76 serotypes) and HRV-B (including 25 serotypes) from October 2011 through March 2014, a total of 432 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from hospitalized patients with ARI, all with shortness of breath or hypoxemia. from a clinical point of view, patients were further classified in two groups: pneumonia and wheezing and/or asthma. study population and clinical data All samples used in this study were collected during the monitoring of respiratory pathogens in children under 15 years of age. from October 2011 through March 2014, a total of 432 nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) were collected from hospitalized patients with ARI, all with shortness of breath or hypoxemia (oxygen saturation 90% on room air) nucleic acids extracted from 200 l samples using a high-throughput automated extraction system. data were analyzed in R version 2.15.3 (Vienna, Austria) and SPSS version 20 (Armonk, NY, USA) and STATA 11 (College Station, TX, USA) differences with P value were considered significant. single viral infections were detected in 183 samples (424%), and two or more viral infections were found in 21 samples (49%) the most common coinfections were those involving HRV and bocavirus with six cases, HRV and HCoV in three samples, HRV and HCoV in three samples, HRV and ADV with two cases each. seasonal distribution of the most prevalent respiratory viruses: (A) total viral infections, (B) HRV, (C) RSV, (D) IFV-A, ADV, HMPV, and HPIV in children with ARI from the national Institute of Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City between October 2011 and March 2014. xiphoid retraction (P = 0019; OR: 197 [95% CI: 111\u2013349]), xiphoid retraction (P = 0029; OR: 287 [95% CI: 114\u201372]) and crackles (P = 00001; OR: 036 [95% CI: 021\u2013061]), hyporexia (P = 0036; OR: 202 [95% CI: 104 Symptoms Wheezing 816* 444 588 857 667 538 615 Rhinorrhea 579 556 608 857 333 308** 584 Fever 447** 778 686 100* 833 100* 634 Crackles 395** 370 667* 857 833 769* 500 Malaise 289 519* 255 143 667* 231 273 Supraesternal retraction 329* 296 196 429 the 115 samples positive to HRV infection were typified. 494% of the samples were classified as HRV-C. the relationship between HRV-C and asthma is maintained. individuals with HMPV infection had prolonged hospital stays in days [7 (5\u2013165); P = 0015], and those with HRV infection had the shortest hospital stays [5 (4\u20136); P = 0006] Demographic characteristics Between October 2011 and March 2014, a total of 432 hospitalized children with ARI were enrolled in this study. the median age of study participants was 36 months, and 514% participants were male. coinfections between HRV and bocavirus or HPIV, RSV-A, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, HCoV and HPIV were detected once each one. 139 samples (322%) did not have any respiratory pathogen. IFV-A showed a clear occurrence during winter, with an increase in the number of cases in 2011 and 2013 winter seasons, but almost absent in winter 2012. compared individuals with a demonstrated single viral infection with those with no viral infection detected. other viruses such as RSV were mostly related with the presence of crackles (P = 0009; OR: 227 [95% CI: 121\u2013425]), hyporexia (P = 0036; OR: 202 [95% CI: 104\u2013393]), and diarrhea (P = 0002; OR: 463 [95% CI: 104\u2013393]), while influenza A infection presented more malaise (P = 0003; OR: 322 [95% CI there was no statistical difference (P > 005) among other symptoms such as cough, expectoration, intercostal retraction dyspnea, tachypnea, odynophagia, cyanosis, and nasal congestion among respiratory viruses. the 115 samples positive to HRV infection were typified. 494% of the samples were classified as HRV-C. the relationship between HRV-C and asthma is maintained. 597% of the patients tested had at least one viral infection. this is similar to a previous etiological report made in Mexico City. virus is usually detected in approximately 30\u201350% of hospitalized children. this is the most extensive analysis made that was able to detect the respiratory viruses present in the upper respiratory tract of hospitalized children with ARIs in Mexico City. this type of studies is essential to know the genomics, epidemiology, and clinical impact of the HRV-C strains in order to be capable of confronting and even predicting future outbreaks."}
