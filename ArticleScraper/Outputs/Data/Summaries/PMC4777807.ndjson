{"summary": "71 fecal samples from suspected diarrheic dogs were collected in sterile phosphate buffer saline (10% W/V) the infection was higher in Deshi/local breeds, followed by german shepherd (17.24%), equal incidences in mixed and Labrador retriever (10.34%), Rottweiler and German spitz showed 6.90% each and finally lower incidences in four breeds (3.45%) the prevalence study in india was first reported by Balu and Thangaraj in madras. the pattern of disease experienced in a population is largely influenced by the susceptibility of host, environmental conditions such as housing, hygiene, population density, and pathogenicity of the infectious agent. samples were collected from suspected dogs by introducing a swab into the anus of diarrheic dogs and homogenized (10% w/v) in sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS) the samples were kept in 2 ml collection tube with the swab. 0.5 l of each forward primer and reverse primer (IDT), 0.5 l of 2 mM dNTPS (Fermentas), 2.5 l of Taq DNA buffer A 10X (tris with 15 mM of MgCl2), 0.25 l of Taq DNA polymerase (5 U/l concentration, Genei, Bangalore) and finally 5 l of lysate was added. the different breeds were classified under four groups such as Group-1 (1-3 months), Group-2 (3-6 months), Group-3 (6-12) and Group-4 (>12 months). all the data regarding the breed, age and sex were given in the Tables-1-3, respectively. study area Dogs in and around Bhubaneswar suffering from diarrhea and vomiting were selected for the study as the suspected cases of parvovirus infection. Suspected cases were mostly presented for treatment to Teaching Veterinary Clinical Complex, College of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry, OUAT, Odisha. the lysate was stored at 20\u00b0C until further use. the commercial vaccine against CPV, Canigen DHPPi (Virbac) was used as positive control after a pretreatment by fast boiling method. the amplified PCR products were analyzed on 1% agarose gel (Lonza, USA) with the positive control and visualized under UV transilluminator. the different breeds were classified under four groups such as Group-1 (1-3 months), Group-2 (3-6 months), Group-3 (6-12) and Group-4 (>12 months). PCR negative Total case group wise Incidence over positive cases (%) Incidence over total cases (%) Incidence over total cases (%) Male 25 25 86.21 35.21 Female 4 17 13.79 5.63 Total 29 42 71 100 40.85 PCR=Polymerase chain reaction Results The breed-wise incidence rate calculated over positive cases was found to be higher in Deshi/local breeds (4.48%), followed by German shepherd (17.24%), equal incidence in mixed and Labrador retriever (10 the age-wise distribution pattern was represented in the Figure-3. the incidence was predominantly higher in males (86.21%) in comparison to females (13.79%) with respect to total positive cases. the incidence rate over total suspected cases was found to be 35.21% in males. breed-wise distribution of CPV revealed Deshi/local breeds were more prone to this infection than that of exotic breeds. similar findings were reported earlier [12] where 27.23% incidence was observed in the local breed. the higher incidence of CPV below 6 months may be due to the affinity of the virus for rapidly multiplying intestinal crypt cells in weaning pups. the fall in maternal antibody level after 3 months age might be one of the predisposing factors, which make the age group of 3-6 months old more prone to CPV. males are mostly susceptible to parvovirus infection than females. PCR screening of 71 suspected fecal samples revealed 29 samples positive for CPV with an incidence of 40.85% in the area of study. sex-wise incidence found to be more in male dogs. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
