{"summary": "novel reovirus (N-MDRV) emerged in southeast china in 2002. it can infect a wide range of waterfowl and induces clinical signs and cytopathic effects that are distinct from those of classical MDRV. results aimed to investigate the characteristics of two novel reoviruses isolated from two diseased Muscovy ducklings. potential recombination events detection in segment S2 suggests that MDRV-SH12 and MDRV-DH13 may be recombinants of classical and novel WRVs. results presented in this study will improve our understanding of the evolutionary relationships among the waterfowl-origin reoviruses circulating in china."}
