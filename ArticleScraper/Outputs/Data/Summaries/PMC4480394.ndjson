{"summary": "methods Ethical Review This investigation was part of a public health response. it was determined by the CDC Institutional Review Board to be a nonresearch investigation. all participants provided verbal consent before interview; parental permission and assent from minors were obtained as appropriate. nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab, stool, and urine samples were collected from all contacts. nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples and serum samples were collected from the case-patient on various dates. a recombinant nucleocapsid-based ELISA was performed on samples from the case-patient and 3 contacts. positive ELISA results were confirmed by a positive ELISA result and confirmation by IFA or microneutralization assay. a positive ELISA result was determined to be negative. GPS tracer tags were worn routinely by registered nurses and certified nursing assistants. the tags track the date and time that staff enter and exit a patient\u2019s room. hospital visitor contacts were defined as all persons who stayed overnight in the same household as the case-patient between his arrival in the united states and his admission to the hospital. nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab, stool, and urine samples were collected from the case-patient on various dates. two sets of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples and serum samples were collected from all contacts. a positive serologic result required a positive ELISA result and confirmation by IFA or microneutralization assay. a multiplex PCR assay virus panel was performed on samples from the case-patient and 3 contacts. the case-patient performed noninvasive procedures on 3 or 4 intubated patients. the case-patient was discharged from the hospital 11 days after admission (DOI 21) contact Investigation HCP Contacts Fifty-three HCP self-identified as contacts of the case-patient or were identified as contacts from security video footage, GPS tracer tag logs, or the case-patient\u2019s medical record. 3 were determined to not be contacts and were excluded from the analyses. six HCP contacts touched the case-patient while performing activities such as recording vital signs, listening to his lungs, and drawing blood. RNs and CNAs had the most frequent exposures; the median number of self-reported visits for each RN and CNA was 7 and 2, respectively. most HCP contacts (26 [58%]) were exposed to the case-patient 1 time. 18 were exposed >2 times, and 4 were exposed >10 times. median total self-reported exposure time was 11 minutes 30 seconds. yza, but not fever, developed in 2 household contacts; 1 of these contacts tested positive for rhinovirus. the case-patient had mild myalgias and fever without any respiratory symptoms. on may 14, the contact had a runny nose and mild cough. 1 underestimated the number by 22 visits; 1 underestimated the number by 16 visits; and 1 did not recollect the tag-recorded visits. there was no consistent pattern in the way HCP reported their number of visits. the case-patient was admitted to the hospital on DOI 11 for right lower lobe pneumonia with hypoxia. on DOI 12, he was suspected of having MERS-CoV infection. airborne precautions (i.e. N95 respirator and patient isolation in an airborne infection isolation room) were instituted. the median age was 41.5 years (range 22.0\u201361.0 years) most HCP contacts (71%) were assigned to work in the ED (n = 21 [47%]) but 12 (27%) HCP contacts worked in multiple departments. six HCP contacts touched the case-patient while performing activities such as recording vital signs, listening to his lungs, and drawing blood. RNs and CNAs had the most frequent exposures; the median number of self-reported visits for each RN and CNA were 7 and 2, respectively. most HCP contacts (26 [58%] were exposed to the case-patient 1 time; 18 were exposed >2 times; 4 were exposed >10 times. two of these contacts were exposed on hospitalization days 1 and 2 without wearing any PPE. all 3 were exposed on hospital day 3 while wearing N95 masks but no other PPE. one household contact was also an HCP contact and was included in both categories. day 2 and 9 were exposed on hospitalization day 3. the same persons could be counted on multiple days of exposure. the median age was 41.5 years (range 22.0\u201361.0 years) six HCP contacts touched the case-patient while performing activities such as recording vital signs, listening to his lungs, and drawing blood. RNs and CNAs had the most frequent exposures; the median number of self-reported visits for each RN and CNA were 7 and 2, respectively. the following symptoms most commonly developed in 9 HCP contacts: rhinorrhea (33%), odynophagia (22%), or headache (22%) within postexposure day 14. two of these contacts were exposed on hospitalization days 1 and 2 without wearing any PPE. all 3 were exposed on hospital day 3 while wearing N95 masks but no other PPE. additional nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and serum samples were negative for MERS-CoV by rRT-PCR and serologic testing. his antibody status was determined to be negative because the ELISA result could not be confirmed by either IFA or microneutralization assay. self-reported and global positioning system (GPS) tracer tag\u2013reported visits (A) and exposure times (B) could be reported for 8 certified nursing assistants and 3 registered nurses who wore GPS tracer tags. self-reported number of visits to patient\u2019s room was derived from interviews held 5\u20137 days after exposure to the case-patient. the absence of transmission to the HCP contacts may have been due to the absence of high-risk procedures. the hospital implemented strict infection control practices soon after the case-patient was suspected of having MERS-CoV infection. there have been reports of transmission to HCP contacts in hospitals with multiple MERS patients or delayed implementation of appropriate infection control practices (5,7) this investigation was unique because we had independent documentation of duration of exposure from GPS-based tracer tags for 20% of HCP contacts. most contacts accurately reported case-patient exposure. but 20 minutes\u2019 difference in exposure may alter the HCP contact risk, given that each visit was generally 3 minutes in duration. the accuracy of information collected by recall during a contact investigation. not all information could be confirmed by the GPS tracer tag logs. additional information is needed regarding the natural history of the illness."}
