{"summary": "the 2009 influenza pandemic posed one of the most serious global public health challenges in recent years. in the 21st century, the world is now a global village in terms of epidemic transmission. the virus can transmit from humans to humans by direct body contact or respiratory droplets. traffic can be modelled as a road network to simulate the transmission of airborne diseases in a city. national highways and interprovincial freeways were the foremost path for sARS being carried by people from Beijing to neighboring areas in 2003 [13] the transmission pattern of dengue in Cambodia has been found to be related to the network of national roads, where traffic allowed human carriers to move [14] a previous study found income, railway capacity, per person gross domestic product, and urban rate played roles in the interregional transmission of seasonal influenza in U.S. cities [21]. other socioeconomic factors such as population density, illiteracy, and unemployment were significantly associated with the mortality from the 1918 influenza pandemic in Chicago [19]. every data entry represents a case with attributes, such as the date of onset, date of birth, and address together with a corresponding administrative area number. MATLAB and ArcGIS Desktop were used to extract information concerning the cumulative incidence of daily reported cases during the above time period divided by the population at risk. two symmetric matrices (matrix A and D1) were constructed. matrix D1 is an adjacent distance matrix and element D1 (i, j) is the actual distance between city i and j if they are adjacent. the two matrices (matrix G and G p ) are generated using a gravity model [30,31] based on the demographic data. n is the total number of cities in the national highway network. we assumed that the highway passenger capacity within a city can be represented by the number of passengers transported within the range of a circle whose center is a certain city with a radius of 100 km. we assumed that the highway passenger capacity within a city accounted for 90% of the total highway passenger volume. the eight center cities are labeled with their names. a correlation analysis was performed to assess the associations between disease variables (cumulative incidence, onset week, and duration from onset to the first epidemic peak) and highway network node centralities. response variable observations collected at n cities; X is an n 1 vector of normally distributed (with constant variance 2) stochastic disturbances; n is the total number of cities; k is the number of explanatory variables incorporated into the regression model; n is the total number of cities; n is the total number of cities; k is the number of explanatory variables incorporated into the regression model. network of national highways in china consists of nodes (representing prefecture-level cities) and links (representing national highway lines) each link is connected to two nodes, to which the two corresponding prefecture-level cities are connected by a section of national highways. the betweenness, which is the sum of the shortest paths that pass through the node; the closeness, which is the sum of the shortest distances (geodesic paths) between that node and all other nodes in the network. the eigenvector centrality, which is a measure of the influence of a node in a network, is calculated with the igraph package [27] in the R program [28]. the two matrices (matrix G and G p ) are generated using a gravity model [30,31] based on the demographic data. n is the total number of cities in the national highway network ( n = 333 ). all the first cases in these eight centers were imported into china by planes from other countries. the multicenter distance of city i (SDi) is calculated as follows. the shortest distance along national highways from a certain city to one of the eight center cities. sumRatio is a synthetic indicator measuring the global importance of a node to all others in a network. higher values of SumRatio relate to more frequent exchanges of people and economic trade. n is the total number of cities in the national highway network ( n = 333 ). n is the total number of cities in the national highway network ( n = 333 ). m, and are set to be 1, 1, and 1, respectively, as estimated by reference [31]. a correlation analysis was performed to assess the associations between disease variables (cumulative incidence, onset week, and duration from onset to the first epidemic peak) and highway network node centralities (adjacent degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector centrality, SumRatio, and Multicenter Distance) y = W1y + X + = W2 + N (0, 2In), (5) where y denotes an n 1 vector of response variable observations collected at n cities. n is the total number of cities; k is the number of explanatory variables incorporated into the regression model. earliest epidemic peak in all cities arrived in week 35, and last one arrived in week 52. the national highway network had a mean degree of 3.06, an average clustering coefficient of 0.102, a diameter of 26 and an average path length of 10.645. in Figure 3a\u2013c, histograms of the road passenger volumes, SumRatio, and Multicenter Distance of all the cities in the national highway network are displayed. sumRatio was positively associated with the cumulative incidence (r = 0.354, p 0.001) and duration (r = 0.265, p 0.001), but negatively associated with the onset week (r = 0.348, p 0.001) the Pearson correlation coefficients between the number of slaughtered pigs and cumulative incidence, onset week, and duration of epidemics were 0.096. the correlation coefficients are significant at the 0.05 level, at the 0.01 level, and at the 0.001 level respectively. the correlation coefficients are significant at the 0.05 level, at the 0.01 level, and at the 0.001 level, respectively. b The closeness centrality was not included in the models as an explanatory variable because its VIF was larger than 10. c w is the adjacent matrix A in the Materials and Methods section. c w is the adjacent matrix A in the Materials and Methods section. the spatial dependence coefficient of the response variable was statistically significant. the duration can be lengthened by 0.803%, 0.541%, 0.472%, and 0.277%, with a 1% increase in PopDensity, College, Pig, and Multicenter Distance respectively. the earliest epidemic peak in all cities arrived in week 35 and the last one arrived in week 52. sumRatio and Multicenter Distance were significantly correlated with all three epidemiological features. a positive correlation between closeness centrality and onset week was identified. s would not be taken as an explanatory variable of the regression model when the cumulative incidence was taken as the response variable. the correlation coefficients are significant at the 0.05 level, at the 0.01 level, and at the 0.001 level. b The closeness centrality was not included in the models as an explanatory variable because its VIF was larger than 10. c w is the adjacent. cumulative incidence can increase 0.205%, 0.140%, 0.286%, 0.286%, 0.141%, 0.147%, 0.190%, and 0.326%. onset week can be delayed by 0.413% and 0.510% when PopDensity and Pig decreased by one percent. international infected individuals quickly arrived in eight center cities and other cities in eastern china with frequent international communications [34], most of which are spatially distant from each other, after long distance travel by plane [6]. this pattern was important for virus spread in the early stage of an epidemic, especially before strict control measures were taken [13] population density and number of pigs had negative effects on epidemic onset in cities. pigs can carry virus, transmit it to human beings, and may be magnifier of population. a city with a high population density would have a high proportion of susceptible people who are fuel for epidemics [38,39], which would prolong the duration of an epidemic. a city with a high population density would have a high proportion of susceptible people who are fuel for epidemics [38,39]. most people do not travel by air very often (at least in 2009, except for businessmen) airplanes bring virus carriers to areas that are far from each other and disease-free before landing, which may lead to a spatially random dispersal of viral pathogens. road travel would be more important than air travel for the spatial transmission of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus in china. people in a wealthy region travel farther than people in a relatively poor region in china due to the difference in basic facilities or people\u2019s living standard. health disparities of people in less developed and developed areas might be reduced by the interaction of epidemiological and socioeconomic factors in the face of a newly emerging influenza pandemic. the number of newly affected cities increased more quickly than in the prior period. this could be explained by two possible reasons. the first may be that almost all the new cases were local cases after week 36 (until 6 September), which meant the community transmission of the virus within a city had started. the second reason could be that the Chinese government took strict prevention and control measures before September 2009. a meta-population epidemiological model should be constructed to investigate the diffusion process of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus. the study proposes two new node centralities for a national highway network. both perform better than classic node centralities for statistically significant correlation with epidemiological features."}
