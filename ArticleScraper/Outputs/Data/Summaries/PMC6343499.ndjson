{"summary": "ferrets have been shown to exhibit exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. a serum TLI radioimmunoassay (RIA) could have utility for the assessment of exocrine pancreatic function in CF ferrets. ferret trypsin was purified from pancreatic tissue using slightly modified protocols described previously. the frozen tissue was thawed and sectioned into 1-cm3 pieces, removing fatty tissue. ammonium sulfate precipitation was carried out in 2 steps using 0.8 M for step 1; 3.0 M ammonium sulfate was used for step 2. all fractions were analyzed by a sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel and screened for tryptic activity. 8.0, with 1 mg/mL of enteropeptidase was added to begin activation. every 2 h, 50 L was taken from the pool and screened for tryptic activity. if activity persisted, more of the TLCK solution was added and the activity was further monitored. the gels were stained (Imperial stain, Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL) for 45 min. the concentration was determined before final preparation and storage. the pure ferret trypsin was sent to the Protein Chemistry Laboratory. both rabbits were exsanguinated after each of the last 3 booster injections. the collected serum was sent to the Gastrointestinal Laboratory at Texas A&M university for development of a RIA. each ferret serum sample was diluted 1:10 with RIA buffer. standards were removed from the freezer, and 100 L were pipetted into 2 polypropylene tubes. tracer and antiserum were added to all standards and samples. lytical validation of ferret trypsin-like immunoreactivity RIA Excess ferret serum samples from unrelated projects at the Gastrointestinal Laboratory at Texas A&M university. assay sensitivity was assessed by setting up 10 duplicates of B0 (100 L of anti-ferret trypsin antiserum plus 100 L of RIA buffer) the calculated sensitivity was used as the limit of detection (LOD) of the assay. the intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated as: CV = ( SD / mean ) 100. assay reproducibility was evaluated by assaying 9 different serum samples in 10 separate assay runs. all ferret serum validation samples were run in duplicate. ferret trypsin was purified from pancreatic tissue using slightly modified protocols described previously. frozen tissue was thawed at room temperature and sectioned into 1-cm3 pieces, removing fatty tissue. a porcine enteropeptidase solution (1 mg/mL in 1 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0) was added to activate any trypsinogen present. after incubation at 37\u00b0C, all samples plus controls were assayed for tryptic activity. TLCK-inhibited ferret cationic trypsin (TLCK-mcT) was incubated at room temperature for 6 h. solution was dialyzed against 4 L of 1 mM HCl for 4 h, 3 times for a total of 12 h. if activity persisted, more of the TLCK solution was added. two new Zealand white rabbits were given injections of pure TLCK-mcT. each rabbit was given a subcutaneous injection of 1 mL of a solution containing 300 g of TLCK-mcT. 125I has a half-life of 60 d, this iodination procedure was performed monthly to ensure consistent radioactivity of the tracer. the final tracer solution and fraction 4 were kept at 4\u00b0C. the 2 tubes labeled B0 contained 100 L of RIA buffer, 100 L of tracer, and 100 L of anti-ferret trypsin antibodies. all tubes were vortexed and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 24 h. the calculated sensitivity was used as the limit of detection (LOD) of the assay. all ferret serum samples were kept undiluted at 80\u00b0C until use. dilutions were prepared using 1 part serum to 9 parts RIA buffer. from 31 healthy ferrets from unrelated projects were used to establish a reference interval (RI) Ferrets were 1\u20137-y-old (n = 20, 18 males, 13 females) and had been evaluated by a veterinarian in Florida between 2008 and 2010. all samples were run at the standard 1:10 dilution. serum anti-ferret trypsin antibody titers were evaluated in both rabbits after inoculation. sensitivity of the TLI RIA was calculated to be 0.55 g/L. upper limit of reference interval were 10.1\u201332.1 g/L and 103\u2013126 g/L respectively. sample starting TLI (g/L) concentration Mean O/E ratio (%) 1 154 127.9 2 129 109.8 3 76.9 90.2 4 13.9 105.4 5 8.2 101.6 6 7.0 104.8 7 3.5 116.8 Concentration at the 1:10 dilution and mean observed-to-expected ratios after 3 serial dilution the amino acid sequence of the first 6 amino acids of the mature end of the trypsin was determined to be I-V-G-G-X-T. the amino acid sequence was determined to be homologous to trypsin from several other species. serum anti-ferret trypsin antibody titers were evaluated in both rabbits. sensitivity of the RIA was calculated to be 0.55 g/L. RI for TLI established from 31 healthy ferrets was 28\u2013115 g/L. 90% CIs for lower and upper limit of reference interval were 10.1\u201332.1 g/L and 103\u2013126 g/L respectively. sample starting TLI (g/L) concentration Mean O/E ratio (%) 1 154 127.9 2 129 109.8 3 76.9 90.2 4 13.9 105.4 5 8.2 101.6 6 7.0 104.8 7 3.5 116.8 Concentration at the 1:10 dilution and mean observed-to-expected ratios 63 0.2 3.5 7 36 0.1 2.7 Inter-assay variability 1 201 1.5 7.3 2 145 0.9 6.4 3 104 0.4 4.2 4 81 0.3 3.5 5 73 0.4 5.2 6 69 0.4 5.4 7 62 0.3 5.4 7 62 0.3 5.1 8 49 0.4 7.5 9 37 0.3 8.2 Results repeated 10 times for intra-assay and inter-assay variability. psin may have a modified amino acid in position 5 that cannot be identified by the standard procedures of Edman degradation. the protein purified was pure trypsin and/or trypsinogen. the RI for TLI (n = 31) was 28\u2013115 g/L and is well within the assay working range. however, additional validation is necessary in the upper range of the assay. an entirely new RI could be created from at least 120 healthy ferrets. further studies are underway involving ferrets with acute pancreatitis and CF."}
