{"summary": "the disease is increasing in livestock worldwide and is a re-emerging human disease. there are currently no commercial vaccines, and only one drug with significant efficacy against adult worms and juveniles. a liver fluke vaccine is deemed essential as short-lived chemotherapy is an unsustainable option in both developed and developing countries. r fluke causes economic losses of over US$ 3 billion worldwide per annum to livestock worldwide. the disease is increasing in livestock worldwide with contributing factors such as climate change. triclabendazole (TCBZ) is the most important fasciolicide, as the only drug with significant efficacy against adult worms and juveniles. the mu class GSTs have established roles in phase II detoxification of xenobiotic and endogenously derived toxins in F. hepatica. the general detoxification role is supported by GSTs contributing to 4% of the total soluble protein in F. hepatica. two new classes of GST, Sigma and Omega, have been uncovered. a mammalian and a helminth or invertebrate GST sequence were selected for each GST class where available. phylogenetic bootstrap neighbour-joining trees were produced as PHYLIP output files in ClustalX Version 1.83 [31] according to the neighbour-joining method of Saitou and Nei [32] rFhGST-S1 protein was purified from transformed E. coli cytosol. ligands were also assessed for their ability to inhibit GST activity. at least six different inhibitor concentrations were used in each IC50 determination. substrate specificities of rFhGST-S1 were estimated graphically [37]. rFhGST-S1 was pre-incubated for 5 minutes prior to starting reactions. rFhGST-S1 shows activity towards a broad range of model and natural GST substrates with a similar enzymatic profile to the Schistosomiasis vaccine trialist (Sm28GST - P09792) rFhGST-S1 also displays high glutathione-dependent lipid peroxidase activity compared to both Sm28GST and Sj26GST (Q26513). prostaglandins were extracted by adding 860 L of ice-cold ethyl acetate. the upper ethyl acetate layer was retained and solvent was evaporated under a nitrogen stream at 45\u00b0C. the remaining residue was reconstituted in 50 l of methanol/water/fomic acid mix at pH 2.8. soluble fractions were obtained by homogenisation of frozen fluke at 4\u00b0C in a glass grinder in lysis buffer (20 mM KHPO4, pH 7.0, 0.1% Triton-X100 and a cocktail of protease inhibitors. Western blotting F. hepatica Sigma GST (rFhGST-S1) and native F. hepatica S-hexylGSH-affinity purified GST samples were subjected to standard SDS- F. hepatica Sigma GST was detected by immunohistology in tissue sections of whole adult F. hepatica. sections were washed in tris-buffered saline (TBS; 0.1 M Tris-HCl with 0.9% NaCl [pH 7.2]), treated with 0.05% protease (type XXIV, bacterial: Sigma) in TBS for 5 min at 37\u00b0C for antigen retrieval. sections were incubated polyclonal antibody was diluted at 1500 in 20% swine serum in TBS. sections were rinsed, dehydrated in alcohol, cleared in xylene, and mounted. recombinant mouse GM-CSF (20 ng/ml; R&D Systems), at 37\u00b0C. cells were harvested, counted and stained with CD11c. cells were seeded into 24-well plates (Nunc) at 106/ml. group 1 (n = 10) were immunized with two subcutaneous injections of 100 g of rFhGST-S1 in 1 ml of Quil A in 1 ml of PBS each injection separated by 4 weeks. group 2 (n = 9) served as an infected control and was immunized at the same time with 1 ml of Quil A in 1 ml of PBS. hepatic lesions were scored as absent []; mild [+] (less than 10% of hepatic surface affected); severe [+++] (25\u201350% of hepatic surface affected) and very severe [++++++] (more than 50% of hepatic surface affected) tissue sections (4 m) were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. phylogenetic bootstrap neighbour-joining trees were produced as PHYLIP output files in ClustalX Version 1.83 [31] according to the neighbour-joining method of Saitou and Nei [32]. clustalX default settings were accepted using the GONNET protein weight matrices with PHYLIP tree format files viewed within TREEVIEW [33] native GSTs were purified from transformed E. coli cytosol. rFhGST-S1 was assessed by electrospray ionisation (ESI) mass spectrometry, sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 2DE. rFhGST-S1 shows activity towards a broad range of model and natural GST substrates with similar enzymatic profile to the Schistosomiasis vaccine trialist. rFhGST-S1 also displays high glutathione-dependent lipid peroxidase activity compared to both Sm28GST and Sj26GST (Q26). lipid peroxidase activity has also been seen in a 'weak affinity' fraction. reactions were performed in glass vials in 2 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mM glutathione, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM tryptophan, 1 M hematin. the nano LC-MS analyses were performed using a Waters Q-Tof micro mass spectrometer (Waters) coupled to a LC-Packings Ultimate nano LC system (Dionex) samples were loaded on the pre-column with mobile phase A (25% acetonitrile) and C (100% methanol) fractions obtained by homogenisation of frozen fluke at 4\u00b0C in lysis buffer (20 mM KHPO4, pH 7.0, 0.1% Triton-X100 and a cocktail of protease inhibitors. supernatants were considered as the soluble cytosolic fraction. western blotting Recombinant F. hepatica Sigma GST (rFhGST-S1) and native F. hepatica S-hexylGSH-affinity all western blots were developed as described previously. recombinant F. hepatica Sigma GST (FhGST-S1) was detected by immunohistology. cells were culturing bone marrow cells isolated from the femurs and tibia of C57BL/6j and TLR4/ mice in complete RPMI 1640. cells were harvested, counted and stained with CD11c. cells were seeded into 24-well plates (Nunc) at 106/ml in complete RPMI 1640. cells were treated with medium only, rFhGST-S1 (10 g) or LPS (Alexa; 100 ng/ml) ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine and 50 M 2-mercaptoethanol were added to the cells. cells were harvested, counted and stained with CD11c (Caltag Laboratories) for analysis by flow cytometry to determine purity (>90%) group 1 (n = 10) were immunized with two subcutaneous injections of 100 g of rFhGST-S1 in 1 ml of Quil A in 1 ml of PBS each injection separated by 4 weeks. group 2 (n = 9) served as an infected control and was immunized at the same time with 1 ml of Quil A in 1 ml of PBS each injection separated by 4 weeks. hepatic lesions were scored as absent []; mild [+] (less than 10% of hepatic surface affected); severe [+++] (25\u201350% of hepatic surface affected) and very severe [++++++] (more than 50% of hepatic surface affected) tissue sections (4 m) were stained with haematoxylin and eosin for the histopathological study. three animals from each group were killed at 7, 8 and 9 days post-infection. the remaining animals (7 and 6 goats per group) were killed 15 weeks after infection to study fluke burdens, fecal egg counts and hepatic lesions. a total of 10 g/ml of rFhGST-S1 was used to coat microtitre plates. 100 l/well of goat sera diluted in blocking buffer and rabbit anti-goat IgG peroxidase conjugated (whole molecule - Sigma) diluted in blocking buffer at 110000. expression yielded 57.3 mg of rFhGST-S1 from a 1 litre culture of BL21 (DE3) cells. purity was judged by the presence of a single band upon SDS-PAGE at the estimated size and a dominating single peak via ESI MS at the precise calculated theoretical mass for the complete protein sequence. Western blotting of the 2DE profile with anti-rFhGST-S1 antibody confirmed all 3 resolved protein spots as rF ligand inhibition studies on rFhGST-S1 showed enzymic activity of rFhGST-S1 with CDNB was inhibited by the major pro-active form of the main liver fluke drug Triclabendazole. bile acids, potentially natural ligands for liver fluke tegumental associated proteins in the host bile environment, were also assessed for activity inhibition. nano-LC-MS was unable to detect either PGD2 or PGE2 in negative control reactions lacking either COX-1 or GST. the rFhGST-S1 catalyses PGD2 formation in a concentration-dependent manner as previously described for rOvGST-1. a coupled assay with rFhGST-S1 and COX-1 catalyses the conversion of arachidonic acid to the H2 form. immunoblot analysis of freshly voided eggs reveals expression of the Sigma class GST is greatly reduced at the time of voiding from the host. however, immunolocalisation studies of adult parasites revealed an abundance of FhGST-S1 in the vitelline cells and eggs. some staining was also found in the parasite parenchyma and tegument. anti-F. hepatica FhGST-S1 stain in cross section within host sheep liver bile duct. brown stained areas show presence of FhGST-S1 proteins. lack of staining in host liver highlights specificity of antibody. rFhGST-S1 secreted total prostaglandin and PGE2 (DC (WT); Figure 5) but not PGD2. rFhGST-S1 was then further assessed for its potential to induce prostaglandin secretion from macrophages. after 18 hours the levels of total prostaglandin, PGE2 and PGD2 were measured. ritic cells (DCs) were cultured in vitro with medium, rFhGST-S1 (10 g/ml) or LPS (100 ng/ml) for 18 hours. production of total prostaglandin, PGE2 and PGD2 released into supernatants determined by competitive EIA. data are presented as the mean SEM following subtraction of medium controls. rFhGST-S1 immunised groups appeared to show reduction in severity of damage occurred in the rFhGST-S1 immunised group. at 15 weeks post-infection (wpi), a similar outcome is observed. in goats immunised with rFhGST-S1 smaller necrotic areas associated to a heavy infiltration of eosinophils were seen. compared to the Quil A immunised group, all migrating larvae found were surrounded by a heavy infiltration of eosinophils. an amino acid sequence comparison of FhGST-S1 with other trematode GSTs places FhGST-S1 into the Sigma class of GSTs, with identities averaging approximately 28%. despite phylogenetic neighbour-joining trees place mammalian and trematode GSTs within the same broad Sigma class. rFhGST-S1 was produced as an active protein, displaying significant enzymic activity towards the model GST substrate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) rFhGST-S1 also displays higher glutathione-dependent lipid peroxidase activity compared to both Sm28GST and Sj26GST. rFhGST-S1 catalyses the conversion of arachidonic acid to the H2 form before the prostaglandin isomer is converted to either the D or E form. nano-LC/MS analysis enabled us to detect the presence of both PGD2 and PGE2 in the assay mixture. western blots confirmed the presence of FhGST-S1 in NEJs and adult flukes and further enabled us to identify the Sigma GST in relative abundance in egg extracts. however, immunolocalisation studies of adult parasites revealed an abundance of FhGST-S1 in the vitelline cells and eggs. Membranes were incubated with anti-FhGST-S1 antibody diluted 130,000. heavily stained eggs show the presence of FhGST-S1 proteins. lack of staining in the host liver highlights specificity of the antibody. no staining can be seen in the tegumental spines (S), testes (T) or the intestinal caecum (IC) no staining can be seen in the tegumental spines (S), testes (T) or the intestinal caecum (IC). rFhGST-S1 activates DCs in vitro. the levels secreted by rFhGST-S1 secreted total prostaglandin, PGE2 and PGD2. however, the levels secreted by J744 cell line were higher. in these experiments we included medium only as a negative control and LPS as a positive control. total protaglandin, PGE2 and PGD2 released into supernatants determined by competitive EIA. results of parasitological and hepatic gross morphometric studies from vaccination. 172 0 1 2 3 0 Group 1 (goats immunised with recombinant FhGST-S1) and Group 2 (infected control group immunised with Quil A only) dpi animals showed tortuous necrotic tracts surrounded by a scarce inflammatory infiltration with occasional eosinophils. the Quil A control group did not show any specific IgG response until 2 weeks after infection. specific IgG titres increased during infection in both groups. but they were consistently higher in the immunised group. 4-HNE is the major aldehydic end-product of lipid peroxidation. it is involved in signalling of host immune cells leading to apoptosis of T- and B-cells. bile acids and flukicide TCBZ appear to bind to the enzyme. the Sigma GST from F. hepatica shares a high sequence identity with recognised Sigma class GSTs with prostaglandin synthase activity. rFhGST-S1 is capable of synthesizing both PGD2 and PGE2. eicosanoids produced by parasitic helminths may play a role in pathophysiological changes during helminth infections. protaglandins and eicosanoids have potent biological activities in reproduction. for example in the zebrafish egg, high levels of PGE2 were seen post fertilisation coupled with high PGD2 synthase transcript levels. however, in F. hepatica, eggs in gravid adults are released in an immature state in the bile duct, where they pass to the external environment. the discrepancy seen between the two techniques is probably related to the antibody dilutions used for each method. this finding emphasises the multi-functionality of FhGST-S1 where in NEJs egg productions is not yet in process, suggesting its main function is in PG synthesis for host modulation or as a detoxification enzyme. inhibition of nitric oxide production, involved in driving a Th2 immune response, may also be a contributing factor in skewing the host response to fasciolosis. prostanoids, including PGD2, are important in mediating allergic inflammatory responses. rFhGST-S1 exposure onprostanoid synthesis in host immune cells was investigated. goats vaccinated with rFhGST-S1 showed reduced gross hepatic lesions during early infection, up to day 9 post infection. this continued to week 15 post infection where liver scores for hepatic lesions appeared reduced for rFhGST-S1 immunised animals. however, high levels of specific IgG did not induced a protective response reducing worm burdens. potential to reduce pasture contamination by inhibiting egg embryonation warrants further exploration using rFhGST-S1 as a vaccine candidate. in line with current vaccine development theory we have shown FhGST-S1 to have multi-functional roles in the liver fluke physiology. however, it is important to fully characterise the host immune response during the early stages post-infection. a distinct separation of clusters is observed as with the recently reclassified \u2018Nu\u2019 class of GSTs from nematodes. phylogenetic neighbour-joining bootstrap trees were produced and viewed within TREEVIEW.
