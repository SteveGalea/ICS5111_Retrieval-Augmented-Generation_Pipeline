{"summary": "the outbreak of 2009 influenza pandemic caused more than 60 million cases, more than 256 000 of which required hospitalization. fortunately, an efficient H1N1 vaccine, PANFLU.1, became available five months after the outbreak. only 76.7% of children aged from 3 to 12 years and 80.3% in people over 60 years were seroprotected by this vaccine. the success of the 2009 H1N1 vaccine PANFLU.1 in young adults provided a possibility for screening high viral neutralizing MAbs from vaccinated individuals who received PANFLU.1. through a massive screen of 13 090 immortalized B-cell clones from three selected vaccinees with hyperimmune sera, seven clones were identified to produce MAbs with both high viral neutralizing capacities and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) activities. cells were cultured in DMEM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and penicillin-streptomycin at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. volunteers enrolled in experiments Fourteen young healthy young adults were vaccinated with 2009 H1N1 pandemic vaccine PANFLU.1. FITC-conjugated CD27, PE-conjugated CD19 (Miltenyi Biotech) cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 300 l phosphate-buffered saline. the data were analyzed using FlowJo software. the supernatant of each clone (100 l) was used to screen positive clones specific for 2009 pandemic (H1N1) HA. expression of recombinant HA proteins (rHAs) rHAs were expressed and purified using the Baculovirus/insect cell system. rHAs coated on polystyrene plates at 4 \u00b0C overnight followed by blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin. sera from vaccinees at a dilution of 1100 were incubated in wells at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-human IgG or IgM (15000) was added at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. serial dilutions of sera or MAbs were pre-incubated with pseudotype H1N1 virus. to wells, 0.75% type-O human erythrocytes were added. positive seroprotection was set at a geometric mean titer over 140. cells were cultured in DMEM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and penicillin-streptomycin at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. volunteers enrolled in experiments Fourteen young healthy young adults were vaccinated with 2009 H1N1 pandemic vaccine PANFLU.1. cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 300 l phosphate-buffered saline. the data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Version 5.7.2; Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR, USA) the supernatant of each clone (100 l) was used to screen positive clones specific for 2009 pandemic (H1N1) HA. expression of recombinant HA proteins (rHAs) rHAs were expressed and purified using the Baculovirus/insect cell system. rHAs coated on polystyrene plates at 4 \u00b0C overnight followed by blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin. sera from vaccinees at a dilution of 1100 were incubated in wells at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-human IgG or IgM (15000) was added at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. serial dilutions of sera or MAbs were pre-incubated with pseudotype H1N1 virus. to wells, 0.75% type-O human erythrocytes were added. positive seroprotection was set at a geometric mean titer over 140. healthy young adults were vaccinated with 2009 pandemic H1N1 vaccine PANFLU.1 for screening with hyper immune sera. fourteen volunteers were vaccinated with one dose of PANFLU.1 containing 15 g of HA antigen. five unvaccinated volunteers were used as a negative control. the ectodomain of HA from 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus was fused with a His tag at the C-terminus expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells. the size of rHAs was correct and the purity was greater than 80%. western blotting also confirmed that rHAs were successfully expressed and purified. sera from 14 vaccinees with hyperimmune sera were analyzed using an ELISA to assess HA-binding and using a neutralizing capacity assay at different time points after vaccination. sera from the vaccinated group had significantly higher HA-binding activity and stronger neutralizing capacity for the 2009 pandemic pseudotype H1N1 virus. vaccination with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 vaccine PANFLU.1 could effectively induce high affinity HA-specific antibodies with strong neutralizing capacities for the 2009 pandemic pseudotype H1N1 virus. sera and CD19+CD27+ memory B cells from the vaccination group (include 14 vaccinees designated as v1 to v14) were examined at various time points after immunization. purity of CD19+CD27+ memory B cells attained more than 90% after flow cytometry sorting. purity of memory B cells from three vaccinees increased from 3.9% to 90.6% after sorting. 13 090 immortalized memory B-cell clones were screened by using ELISA. of these, 617 clones were identified as positive clones. the mean frequency of HA-specific antibody-producing memory B-cell clones was 4.82%. 32 clones, including 16 clones derived from V4, were HAI+. 9 MAbs showed high affinity to rHA (Figure 6c) (P0.01) compared with controls. nine MAbs also possessed high viral neutralizing capacities against two different strains of pseudotype H1N1 viruses. seven MAbs were HAI+ and two were HAI (Figure 6f) a novel strategy for generating high viral neutralizing MAbs against 2009 pandemic H1N1 strains. we applied a novel strategy using EBV to immortalize peripheral blood memory B cells from vaccinees who received the 2009 H1N1 vaccine PANFLU.1. antibodies against the surface glycoprotein HA are of major importance for protection against infection. the ectodomain of HA from 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus was fused with a His tag at the C-terminus expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells. the 2009 pandemic H1N1 vaccine was used as a positive control (P) and 0.1% BSA as a negative control (N) sera from 14 vaccinees were analyzed using an ELISA to assess HA-binding and using a neutralizing capacity assay at different time points after vaccination. the number of memory B cells (CD19+CD27+ cells) from PBMCs from V4 was the highest in all vaccinees compared with those in the unvaccinated volunteers. rHA binding assay results suggest vaccination with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 vaccine PANFLU.1 could efficiently induce high affinity HA-specific antibodies with strong neutralizing capacities for the 2009 pandemic pseudotype H1N1 virus. serum sample was tested in duplicate or triplicate in ELISA analysis. purity of memory B cells increased from 3.9% to 90.6% after sorting. purity of memory B cells increased from 3.9% to 90.6% after sorting. the frequencies of immortalized memory B-cell clones from V1, V4 and V7 were calculated using the formula: immortalized B-cell clones/all B cell clones (per vaccinee) 13 090 immortalized memory B-cell clones were screened by using ELISA to measure the HA-binding activities. identification of high viral neutralizing MAbs A neutralizing assay was performed to identify immortalized memory B-cell clones secreting high viral neutralizing MAbs. these 9 MAbs showed high affinity to rHA (Figure 6c) (P0.01) compared with controls. these 9 MAbs also possessed high viral neutralizing capacities against two different strains of pseudotype H1N1 viruses. hAI analysis of nine neutralizing MAbs showed seven HAI+ MAbs and two HAI MAbs. nine immortalized memory B-cell clones were identified as secreting high viral neutralizing antibodies toward the pandemic H1N1 virus. compared to other techniques for generating human MAbs, we demonstrated a rapid and efficient strategy. the antibody response to pandemic H1N1 2009 vaccine may be variable among vaccinated individuals. however, it was necessary to screen the vaccinees with hyperimmune sera before the generation of human MAbs from immortalized memory B-cell clones. serotherapy with polyclonal or MAbs has been widely used for infectious diseases such as respiratory syncytial virus, Hepatitis A and B, anthrax, smallpox, meningitis and the plague. ive serotherapy with MAbs has also provided prophylactic or therapeutic protection in mice and other animal models."}
