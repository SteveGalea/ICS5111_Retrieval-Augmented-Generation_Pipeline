{"summary": "Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are divided into four subspecies: P.t. troglodytes, P.t. schweinfurthii, P.t. ellioti, and P.t. verus. to characterize genetic variation in the chimpanzee CD4 gene, we obtained sequence data from several sources. lodytes subspecies encode a unique CD4 protein in four chimpanzee subspecies. the number (n) of haplotypes investigated is shown above each pie chart. alleles encoding two glycosylation sites in the D1 domain. Residue 334 is an additional nonsynonymous polymorphism in chimpanzee CD4 specific to allele 8. chimpanzee alleles encode a unique threonine that chimpanzees\u2019 close relatives, human and gorilla, do not encode. all of the five sites of chimpanzee-specific variation fall at or near residues that have been targeted by positive natural selection. chimpanzee-specific threonines at positions 34 and 68 create N-linked glycosylation motifs. all chimpanzee CD4 alleles are predicted to encode the glycosylation motif at positions 32\u201334. only alleles 4, 6, and 7 are predicted to have the second glycosylation motif at 66\u201368. this gave rise to our hypothesis that these glycans may convey some level of protection against infection. sCD4 proteins encoded by human, gorilla, and chimpanzee (allele 6) are predicted to have 0, 1, or 2 glycosylation sites in the D1 domain. chimpanzee sCD4 ran at 20 kDa, chimpanzee sCD4 at a larger size (23 kDa) and gorilla sCD4 ran predominantly at a size in between. protein stain of concentrated imidazole eluted fractions of human, chimpanzee (allele 6), and gorilla sCD4 was determined computationally (67) chimpanzee-specific forms of CD4 were stably expressing human or chimpanzee alleles 1\u20136. blotting of cell lysates confirmed similar CD4 expression between cells. the number of predicted asn-specific glycosylation sites within the D1 domain of CD4 was determined computationally. the data are presented for CD4 proteins with zero glycosylation sites in the D1 domain (green), one glycan in the D1 domain (red), or two glycans in the D1 domain (blue). experiments with SIVcpz have, to date, been performed with live virus. for this reason, we developed a pseudotyping system for SIVcpz Env. a plasmid was cloned into a mammalian expression plasmid to generate pseudotyped viruses bearing SIVcpz Env. samples were gated for live cells, then gated for a fixed range of CD4/CCR5 receptor expression between all samples. error bars represent mean + SEM in virus titers from two independent experiments. both SIVcpz Envs tested were fully capable of utilizing human CD4 (45\u201348) alleles containing this protective SNP are circulating in chimpanzee populations. this polymorphism was identified by a recent study (49). it is interesting to note that entry mediated by SIVcpz EK505 Env (related to HIV-1 group N) (45) was at least partially impeded by CD4 alleles encoding two glycosylation sites, yet unaffected by the Q40R substitution (allele 3). mutations at sites 34 and 68 change the glycosylation status of CD4. the amino acids encoded at positions 34 and 68 of CD4 influence lentiviral entry in an additive fashion. sCD4 glycosylation inhibits HIV. infectivity of two HIV-1 Env pseudotyped viruses was determined by measurement of luciferase activity in TZM-bl cells. we then assessed the binding of variably glycosylated sCD4 to HIV-1 Env. TZM-bl cells express human CD4 and CCR5. chimpanzee sCD4 with two glycans did not neutralize HIV-1 infection even at the highest sCD4 concentrations. if the human CD4 had these two glycans, it appears that HIV-1 would have much more difficulty entering human cells. we treated our purified chimpanzee sCD4 (harboring two glycans) with PNGase F. the binding constant (Kd) for human sCD4 (0 glycans) was lower than that of chimpanzee sCD4 (allele 6, two glycans), which reflects an overall higher affinity of HIV-1 Env for human CD4. therefore, the Kd value reported (>390 nM) underestimates the true Kd value. chimpanzee alleles encode a fixed, chimpanzee-specific substitution in CD4 (68T) that creates a second glycosylation site on the virus binding surface of chimpanzee CD4. this substitution creates a second glycosylation site on the virus binding surface of chimpanzee CD4. the glycans on chimpanzee CD4 reduce binding affinity with lentiviral Env, impeding cellular entry of chimpanzees have experienced selection in favor of the creation of a potent host deterrent to virus infection. anywhere from 20 to 100% of chimpanzees, depending on the subspecies, would have one or two copies of a CD4 allele bearing the two glycans that diminish infection. human SNPs in cellular receptors have been shown to convey protection against filoviruses and hepatitis B virus. identifying genetic variation that alters inter- and intraspecies host susceptibility will be crucial to expanding our understanding of disease susceptibility and also viral zoonosis. chimpanzee-specific CD4 glycans influence entry of viruses other than HIV/SIVcpz. glycans on chimpanzee CD4 diminish susceptibility to infection by at least some primate lentiviruses. the 68T SNP (introducing a second glycan) would have been maintained if normal functions of CD4+ T cells were disrupted. to characterize genetic variation in the chimpanzee CD4 gene, we obtained CD4 sequence data from several sources. first, we processed raw whole-genome sequencing reads (Methods) obtained from the Great Apes Genome Project (32) and then performed SNP calling and genotyping for each individual. this resulted in 24 CD4 sequences, never before reported, covering all four chimpanzee subspecies. eles encoding two chimpanzee-specific glycosylation sites in the D1 domain. eles identified unique chimpanzee residues (yellow boxes), chimpanzee specific predicted glycan motifs (gray boxes) and sites that contact Env (dark orange) are part of two chimpanzee-specific glycosylation motifs. these alleles are differentiated by 10 SNPs, 6 of which are nonsynonymous. four of these nonsynonymous SNPs are within the N-terminal D1 domain of CD4. alleles 7 and 8 do not differ from represented alleles in the region shown. the two subspecies of chimpanzees that are not infected with SIVcpz in the wild, P.t. ellioti and verus (40\u201342) have the highest prevalence of CD4 alleles predicted to encode both of these glycosylation motifs. human and gorilla encode neither of the glycosylation motifs predicted in the chimpanzee CD4 D1 domain. human sCD4 ran at 20 kDa, chimpanzee sCD4 at a larger size (23 kDa) and gorilla sCD4 ran predominantly at a size in between. this is consistent with a previous study that showed that chimpanzee CD4 migrates at a higher molecular weight in an acrylamide gel compared with human CD4 (43). chimpanzee alleles 1\u20136 were stably expressing human or chimpanzee CCR5. Western blotting of cell lysates confirmed similar CD4 expression. cell lysates were then treated with PNGase F, resulting in similar CD4 migration. the gray box denotes the SIVcpz clade that gave rise to group M HIV-1. we developed a pseudotyping system for SIVcpz Env-GFP viruses. the genomic region of SIVcpz encompassing both the rev and env genes was amplified by PCR from different SIVcpz infectious molecular clones. this plasmid was then cotransfected along with a plasmid encoding full-length HIV-1Env-GFP to generate pseudotyped viruses bearing SIVcpz Env on their surface. we also produced similar pseudoviruses with the Envs of two different subtypes of all three group M-related viruses tested showed a very similar receptor use profile (Fig. 3 D and E) both SIVcpz Envs tested were fully capable of utilizing human CD4 (45\u201348) this is consistent with previous reports that SIVcpz can utilize human CD4 (45\u201348) while human CD4 supported entry of all viruses tested, some versions of chimpanzee CD4 dramatically limited virus infection. this Q40R substitution in chimpanzee CD4 warrants further exploration. it appears to interact differently with group M- versus group N-related lentiviruses. position 40 in CD4 is highly constrained as ancestral glutamine (Q) in the CD4 of all primate species. the percent cells infected (GFP+) were normalized to the percent cells infected in the control cell line expressing human CD4. mutations at sites 34 and 68 change the glycosylation status of CD4. chimpanzee sCD4 was first treated with an Asn-specific glycosidase (PNGase F), thus effectively removing glycans. infectivity was determined by measurement of luciferase activity in TZM-bl cells. sCD4 binds poorly to the doubly glycosylated CD4 receptor. chimpanzee sCD4 treated with PNGase F migrated similarly to human sCD4 but as a smear. preincubation of sCD4 with HIV-1 pseudovirus restored binding and virus neutralization in the TZM-bl assay. chimpanzee sCD4 had a similar affinity for gp120 as human sCD4. glycans on the surface of CD4 inhibit virus infection by significantly reducing Env-CD4 binding. glycans on the surface of CD4 inhibit virus infection. alleles encode a fixed, chimpanzee-specific substitution in CD4 (68T) that creates a second glycosylation site on the virus binding surface of chimpanzee CD4. chimpanzees have experienced selection in favor of the creation of a potent host deterrent to virus infection, in this case in the form of a glycan shield on chimpanzee CD4. population-level genetic variation in host cellular receptors has previously been shown to limit or prevent virus infection in some but not all individuals within a species. human SNPs in cellular receptors have been shown to convey protection against filoviruses and hepatitis B virus (53, 54) human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) uses the CD4 receptor for entry into T cells. this interaction can be blocked by treatment with soluble forms of HIV-1 gp120 (56). further investigation is warranted to determine whether chimpanzee-specific glycans influence entry of viruses other than HIV/SIVcpz. glycans on chimpanzee CD4 diminish susceptibility to infection by at least some primate lentiviruses. it appears that natural selection has favored a growing glycan shield on chimpanzee CD4. there may be a cost to coating these important host receptors with glycans. postprocessing was performed using custom scripts written in Python. data from a population-level survey of chimpanzee CD4 diversity was obtained from GenBank (EF437437\u2013EF437442, EF437451, and EF437460\u2013EF437475) chimpanzee CD4 allele was synthesized (IDT GeneBlock) and cloned into the pCR8/GW/TOPO TA plasmid (Thermo Fisher) each chimpanzee CD4 allele was then reconstructed by site-directed mutagenesis reactions using overlapping PCR primers containing the mutation of interest. HIV-1 Env BG505.W6M.B1 was a gift from Julie Overbaugh. PCR products were cloned into the pCR8/GW/TOPO TA plasmid. HEK293T cells plated in antibiotic free media were transfected with 2 g of pLPCX transfer vector, 1 g of pCS2-mGP (MLV gag/pol) and 0.2 g of pC-VSV-G (VSV-G envelope) the cells were plated at 2 104 cells per well of a 12-well dish (15% confluent) and 24-h later, transduced with 500 L of retroviral supernatant by spin y-eight hours posttransfection, cell supernatant was harvested, concentrated (100-fold) using Amicon Ultracel 100K filters (Millipore), and stored at 80 \u00b0C in single-use aliquots. titers were determined using a titration of different virus volumes on Cf2Th cells stably expressing CD4/CCR5. cells were then infected with HIV-1 pseudoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of cells were analyzed on a CyAn ADP (Beckman Coulter) flow cytometer. the data from 1 104 live cells was analyzed using FlowJo v10. sCD4 was eluted in wash buffer containing 250 mM imidazole. the mixture was pooled, washed 3 with PBS, and concentrated to 500 L. purified samples were concentrated to 1 mg/mL using an Amicon Ultra 0.5-mL centrifugal filter with a 10-kDa molecular mass cutoff. sCD4 treated and untreated viruses were spinoculated onto 1 104 TZM-bl cells plated in 96-well plates, in presence of 5 g/mL of polybrene. at 48 h postinfection, infectivity was measured by firefly luciferase assays. whole-cell extracts and PNGase F treated whole cell extracts (5 g per lane) were resolved on a 10% TGX Stain-free polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad, #1610182) by applying 180V until protein loading dye ran off the gel. membrane was blocked with 3% milk in TBST (0.1%) for 30 min at room temperature. Western blotting was carried out using a 1:1,000 dilution of anti-CD4 antibody raised in rabbit (Abcam, #133616) and a 1:10,000 dilution of a secondary anti-rabbit HRP (Promega, #W4011). soluble Env in PBS was mixed with 1 M sodium bicarbonate to increase the pH above 8. microscale thermophoresis was performed using Monolith NT.115. measured in buffer (PBS, 0.05% tween 20 and 0.5 mg/mL BSA) short read archive (BioProject PRJNA189439) were mapped onto the P. troglodytes genome (panTro4) using BWA-MEM (61) we applied GATK base quality score recalibration, indel realignment, duplicate removal, and SNP discovery and genotyping in each individual separately (62). CD4 sequences from all three sources were parsed by subspecies and combined. the sequences were then truncated to the first 1.311 nucleotides (of 1,377 total), partially omitting the C terminus of CD4. each chimpanzee CD4 allele was synthesized (IDT GeneBlock) and cloned into the pCR8/GW/TOPO TA plasmid (Thermo Fisher) each chimpanzee CD4 allele was then reconstructed by site-directed mutagenesis reactions using overlapping PCR primers. HEK293T (ATCC CRL-11268) were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, and 1% Pen Strep (complete medium) at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. the following day, retrovirus was collected, filtered through 0.22-m cellulose acetate filters. 13 106 HEK293T cells were seeded into a 15-cm dish in antibiotic free media. the cells were then transfected with 5.3 g of Q23Env-GFP (group M backbone) (71) and 2.7 g of Env plasmid. the cells were then infected with HIV-1 pseudoviruses at a multiplicity of infection. the cells were harvested from the plate and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. the fixed cells were washed three times with PBS and resuspended in 50 L FACS buffer. the cells were stained for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C with the following antibody mixture. cell supernatant containing secreted sCD4 was harvested at days 3 and 6 posttransfection. cell supernatant was spun down at 1,200 g for 5 min to remove cell debris. was then incubated with 1-mL bed volume of Ni-NTA agarose beads. reactions carried out under denaturing conditions, 1 mg of sCD4 eluted from gel filtration was incubated with 5,000 units of PNGase F at 30 \u00b0C for 16 h. this reaction was then subjected to the purification protocol described above to remove PNGase F. each virus (normalized by equivalent TDU/mL) was incubated with serial twofold dilutions of sCD4 at 37 \u00b0C for 1 sylation state of HA-tagged CD4 proteins was then determined in human immortalized CD4+ T cells. cells were lysed in nonidet P-40 buffer at 48 h postnucleofection. whole-cell extracts and PNGase F treated whole cell extracts were resolved on a 10% TGX Stain-free polyacrylamide gel. after primary incubation, cells were washed 1 1 2 3 min in TBST (0.1% Tween-20) secondary antibodies were diluted in 3% milk in TBST (0.1% Tween-20) and incubated with the membrane for 20 min at room temperature (1:10,000 anti-mouse-HRP Promega #W402B) Alexa Fluor 488 NHS Ester was resuspended in anhydrous DMSO and added at an Env:dye molar ratio of 1:10. samples were wrapped in foil and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. human CD4 D1-D4 (PDB: 5U1F) was used to generate a structural prediction of chimpanzee CD4 allele 6 using SWISS-MODEL (74, 75) the predicted chimpanzee CD4 allele six structures were compared in Mac PyMOL (the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System)"}
