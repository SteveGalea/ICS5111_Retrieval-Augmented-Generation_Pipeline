{"summary": "we calculated that, under business-as-usual policies, EID events will continue to increase by 5.371/y (SI Methods) we assumed that the nonlinear increase in the frequency of EID events will correlate with increased net damages to the global economy. the x axis represents expected damages/time. the blue line represents expected damages following business as usual. the red line, known as the \u201ccontinuation value,\u201d illustrates the expected damages under business as usual, including the value of waiting. the strategy employs scenarios that assume low or high prevalence of diseases as a basis for development of preventive measures (22). we assumed that the rate of emergence of novel pathogens will not be constrained by the size of the microbial pool in wildlife and livestock from which pandemics predominantly originate (7, 8, 23). our model results show that as the targeted reduction in mean drift rate increases, the critical EID number I* and the expected time to reach that value increase. intuitively, as the expected time to reach that value increases, damages increase, resulting in the policy becoming more effective by reducing the rate of increasing EIDs. the average of 1,000 simulations resulted in policy option C being the most valuable (i.e., the lowest E*) the average of the 1,000 simulations resulted in policy option C being the most valuable (i.e., the lowest E*) value of reducing discounted expected damages begins to decline due to the high cost of the extremely effective policy. for any of the policies, an increase in efficacy is defined as a larger decrease in drift rate (m2) after the policy is implemented. the impact of all parameters on the critical thresholds for specific policies is examined in SI Methods. m2 = 2.92, m 2 = 2.90, K = $37.4 billion K = $38.9 billion D* $6.9 billion $6.9 billion Z* 237.3 237.3 t* 0 0 Present value damages $1,189.9 billion $1,173.5 billion Savings from policy $344.0 billion $360.3 billion. we parameterized the model using data from ref. 8 to estimate the rise in EIDs over time (drift rate) and associated SD (SI Methods and Fig. S1). the four increasingly effective policy options reduce mean drift rate of EID events by 10%, 20%, 50%, and 75% to m2 = 4.8839, 4.0282, 2.6855, and 1.3427. for each of the four policies, we generated estimates of the threshold damages (D*) below which it is optimal not to implement the program of action and above which it is optimal to implement the program. we then calculated the critical number of EID events at which to implement a policy, I*, and the expected first passage time, t* (Table 1). expected net present cost E* decreases as the policies become more effective except for the extremely effective policy, D, m2 = 1.34. as damages increase due to an increase in EIDs, the policy becomes more valuable because of its potential to reduce expected discounted damages. the difference in policy costs is only $1.5 billion, illustrating increasing (10-fold) returns on the cost of the policy. the policy must result in a 9.9% reduction in drift rate, resulting in a drift rate of 2.90 to justify implementation today. mitigation policies need to be only minimally effective in reducing EID risk to be worth implementing. the window of opportunity to deal with pandemics as a global community is within the next 27 y. recent developments suggest that the timeframe is more urgent. zoonoses are increasing as a proportion of all EID events (8). multilateral efforts to mitigate pandemics have already begun. they include so-called one health approaches that focus on reducing contact with animal reservoirs in highly populous regions. they include development initiatives such as the united states agency for international development emerging pandemic threats (USAID-EPT) program. identification emergence (e.g., large agricultural developments; livestock exports; timber, mining, and other extractive industries; and travel and trade) some have called for taxes to be levied on these industries (32)."}
