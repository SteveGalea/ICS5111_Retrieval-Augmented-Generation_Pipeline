{"summary": "PAMPs are detected by cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) the toll-like receptor family detects extracellular and endosomal PAMPs. the RLR family includes three members: RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2 encoded by the genes Ddx58, Ifih1 and Dhx58. ARDs and promote homo-oligomerization, cytosol-to-mitochondrion translocation, and interaction with the mitochondrion-localized adaptor molecule MAVS. each sensor initiates a host defense response to distinct and overlapping sets of viruses. ectopic expression of MDA5 in human hepatoma cells and fibroblasts inhibits replication of WNV and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses. the importance of RLR signaling for controlling viral pathogenesis is evident from studies with genetically deficient mice. in the absence of MAVS, mice are highly vulnerable to infection with WNV and Sindbis, chikungunya, Coxsackie B (CBV), and rabies viruses. the mechanism by which WNV crosses the blood-brain barrier to infect the central nervous system (CNS) remains unclear, but it may involve passage of virus between compromised cell junctions of the BBB, trafficking of infected leukocytes into the CNS or direct infection of the microvascular endothelial cells. in humans, WNV infection can result in encephalitis, meningitis, or flaccid paralysis. the WNV strain used (3000.0259) was isolated in new york in 2000. it was passed once in C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells to generate a virus stock. titers were measured by plaque assay on BHK21-15 cells. mice were infected with 102 PFU of WNV by intracranial injection. mice were sacrificed at specified time points (i.e., day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, or 10) after infection. viral replication was measured by plaque assay. the amount of type I IFN per ml of serum was calculated from a standard curve using alpha interferon (IFN-; PBL InterferonSource) the amount of type I IFN per ml of serum was confirmed by preincubating L929 cells for 2 h with 25 g/ml of the IFNAR-blocking monoclonal antibody (MAb) MAR1-5A3 or an isotype control MAb, GIR-208 (68). spleens and brains were dispersed into single-cell suspensions with a cell strainer. brains were minced and digested with 0.05% collagenase D. spleens and brains were harvested after extensive cardiac perfusion. Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar) at 7 days after infection, splenocytes were isolated and CD8+ T cells were purified. WNV-specific CD8+ cells were identified after staining with a Db-restricted NS4B peptide tetramer. recipients CD8/ mice were perfused with PBS and viral loads in the brain, spinal cord, and spleen were measured by plaque assay. Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar) Flow cytometry data were analyzed using a 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for viral burden, serum bioassay, antibody, and lymphocyte analyses. fetal bovine serum (FBS) inoculated by footpad injection in a volume of 50 l. mice were infected with 102 PFU of WNV by subcutaneous inoculation. mice were sacrificed at specified time points (i.e., day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, or 10) after infection. multistep virus growth curves were performed after infection at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001. levels of biologically active type I IFN were determined using an ECMV cytopathic effect bioassay performed with L929 cells. kine levels in serum were measured using a bio-Plex Pro 23-plex group I cytokine kit (Bio-Rad) and Bio-Plex 200 (Bio-Rad) the levels of WNV-specific IgM and IgG were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against purified WNV E protein. Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar) at 7 days after infection, splenocytes were isolated and CD8+ T cells were purified by positive selection using CD8 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). 106 WT or MDA5/ donor CD8+ cells were adoptively transferred via an intraperitoneal route to recipient CD8/ mice that had been infected with WNV 1 day earlier. recipient mice perfused with PBS and viral loads in the brain, spinal cord, and spleen were measured by plaque assay. WNV-specific CD8+ cells were identified after staining with the NS4B peptide tetramer. Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Treestar) no significant differences were observed in viral burden in the spleen. only limited replication in the kidneys was detected in 5 of 12 MDA5/ mice. the results were unanticipated given the marked increase in viremia. higher viral burden in the brain (P 0.01) and a 21-fold-higher viral burden in the spinal cord (P 0.01) in MDA5/ mice than in WT controls. previous studies showed direct antiviral effects of the RLR signaling pathway in cells of the CNS. cells were infected at an MOI of 0.001 for 72 h, and viral replication was measured by plaque assay. dotted lines represent the limit of sensitivity of the assay. effect of MDA5 on innate immune responses in vivo. mice were infected with 102 PFU of WNV in the footpad. type I IFN activity in serum was measured by an ECMV cytopathic effect bioassay. 0.14 373.2 (147.9) 533.4 (50.5) 0.34 402.5 (126.6) 647.4 (69.2) 0.11 IL-2 49.9 164.2 (23.2) 133.6 (20.0) 0.35 163.1 (19.2) 148.0 (23.3) 0.63 173.7 (15.7) 177.3 (21.6) 0.90 152.8 (37.4) 150.0 (12.1) 0.94 IL-3 1.4 16.0 (4.7) 7.6 (4.2) 0.22 16.1 (6.7) 12.9 (4.6) 0. 1.5 (9.8) 119.1 (15.3) 0.11 172.1 (19.5) 207.2 (16.1) 0.20 174.9 (32.0) 155.5 (18.0) 0.59 IL-12 (p70) 27.1 176.1 (30.4) 104.6 (33.5) 0.15 160.7 (21.7) 141.4 (22.9) 0.56 195.5 (29.5) 214.8 (29.3) 0.65 155.9 (47.3) 188.9 (14.5) 0.48 IL-13 95.0 394.2 (101.5) 207.9 1.00 6.3 (0.0) 6.3 (0.0) 1.00 KC 9.1 159.3 (52.5) 238.6 (131.9) 0.59 111.6 (11.8) 99.7 (25.6) 0.68 105.9 (20.0) 136.9 (30.7) 0.42 112.9 (29.7) 150.1 (20.8) 0.33 MCP-1 75.2 334.5 (73.7) 171.8 (86.1) 0.19 319.6 (73.5) 268.8 (60.2) 0.61 444.0 ( c GM-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. c granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. c GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. we analyzed serum from MDA5/ and WT mice 4, 6 and 8 days after infection for binding to WNV E protein. we observed no defects in anti-WNV-specific IgM or IgG responses in MDA5/ mice. we measured antigen-presenting cells and their state of activation (B220, CD45, CD11b, CD11c, CD80, CD86, and MHC-II) but no marked differences in the quality and quantity of these leukocyte responses between WT and MDA5/ mice after WNV infection. the percentage of cells in each quadrant is shown as means (SEMs) of approximately 15 mice per group. splenocytes were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry at day 7 after infection. phenotypes of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the spleens of WT and MDA5/ mice after WNV infectiona Phenotype Fluorescence intensity within IFN-+ cells P Fluorescence intensity within TNF-+ cells P WT MDA5/ WT MDA5/ KLRG1 102.2 (3.5) 132.0 (5.2) 0.00005* 100.3 (3.2) 117.9 (7.9) 0.044* PD1 102.9 there was no significant difference in the number or percentage of WNV-specific CD8+ T cells in the brain, although MDA5/ mice had higher numbers and percentages of CD45+ CD11b+ macrophages. however, MDA5/ WNV-specific CD8+ T cells in the brain had no relative change in the expression of KLRG1, CD43, CD62L, IFN-, or TNF-. flow cytometry plots of IFN-+ and TNF-+ populations. numbers indicate the percentage of cells in each quadrant. brains were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry at 7 days after infection. numbers and percentages of indicated populations are shown as means (SEMs) of 8 mice per group. asterisk indicates significant differences between WT and MDA5/ cells. we performed two adoptive-transfer experiments to establish the role of MDA5 in T cell priming. we measured tissue viral loads in recipient CD8/ mice. those receiving MDA5/ CD8+ T cells failed to control CNS infection. these results demonstrate that CD8+ T cells primed in MDA5/ mice have functional deficits. dotted lines represent the limit of sensitivity of the assay. remained unclear whether the defect of MDA5/ CD8+ function was cell autonomous. we isolated naive CD8+ T cells from WT and MDA5/ mice. CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were purified by positive selection from naive donor WT or MDA5/ splenocytes. naive mice were infected with 102 PFU of WNV 1 day following adoptive transfer. only a small increase in viremia at a single time point. no significant differences were observed in viral burden in the spleen. only limited replication in the kidneys was detected. at day 10 after infection, we observed a 140-fold-higher viral burden in the brain (P 0.01) and a 21-fold-higher viral burden in the spinal cord (P 0.01) in MDA5/ mice. this suggests that MDA5 is important in controlling immunity to WNV in the CNS. s in cortical neurons and cerebellar granule cell neurons were infected at an MOI of 0.001 for 72 h. dotted lines represent the limit of sensitivity of the assay. effect of MDA5 on innate immune responses in vivo. mice were infected with 102 PFU of WNV in the footpad. type I IFN activity in serum was measured by an ECMV cytopathic effect bioassay. 0.89 476.2 (55.6) 277.9 (105.5) 0.14 373.2 (147.9) 533.4 (50.5) 0.34 402.5 (126.6) 647.4 (69.2) 0.11 IL-2 49.9 164.2 (23.2) 133.6 (20.0) 0.35 163.1 (19.2) 148.0 (23.3) 0.63 173.7 (15.7) 177.3 (21.6) 0.90 152.8 (37.4) 150.0 (12.1) 0.94 IL-3 1.4 16.0 (4.7) 7.6 (4.2 143.5 (19.9) 156.5 (27.7) 0.71 151.5 (9.8) 119.1 (15.3) 0.11 172.1 (19.5) 207.2 (16.1) 0.20 174.9 (32.0) 155.5 (18.0) 0.59 IL-12 (p70) 27.1 176.1 (30.4) 104.6 (33.5) 0.15 160.7 (21.7) 141.4 (22.9) 0.56 195.5 (29.5) 214.8 (29.3) 0.65 155.9 (47.3) 188.9 (14.5) 0.48 1.00 6.3 (0.0) 6.3 (0.0) 6.3 (0.0) 1.00 KC 9.1 159.3 (52.5) 238.6 (131.9) 0.59 111.6 (11.8) 99.7 (25.6) 0.68 105.9 (20.0) 136.9 (30.7) 0.42 112.9 (29.7) 150.1 (20.8) 0.33 MCP-1 75.2 334.5 (73.7) 171.8 (86.1) 0.19 319.6 (73.5) 268.8 (60.2) data represent the means (SEMs) of 5 mice per group. d GM-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. hypothesized that MDA5 might regulate production in the CNS. we analyzed serum from MDA5/ and WT mice 4, 6 and 8 days after infection for binding to WNV E protein. we observed no defects in anti-WNV-specific IgM or IgG responses in MDA5/ mice. migratory capacity (CD43 and CD62L), state of differentiation or exhaustion (KLRG1 and PD1), production of effector molecules (IFN-, TNF-, and granzyme B) after WNV peptide restimulation. no marked differences in the quality and quantity of these leukocyte responses between WT and MDA5/ mice after WNV infection. splenocytes were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry at day 7 after infection. numbers indicate the percentage of cells in each quadrant.

CD8+ T cells primed in MDA5/ mice failed to control CNS infection. CD8+ T cells primed in MDA5/ mice have functional deficits. this produces a cell-intrinsic defect that results in inability to clear WNV infection in the CNS. assay results represent means SEMs of 6 mice per group. dotted lines represent the limit of sensitivity of the assay. remained unclear whether the defect of MDA5/ CD8+ function was cell autonomous. MDA5/ mice reflects non-cell-autonomous role for MDA5 in proper CD8+ T cell priming. naive donor WT or MDA5/ CD8+ cells were purified by positive selection from naive WT or MDA5/ splenocytes. MDA5/ CD8+ T cells were primed equivalently in an MDA5+/+ host. this phenotype was less pronounced than that observed in MAVS/ mice. MAVS/ mice are less vulnerable to WNV infection than IRF-3/ IRF-5/ IRF-7/ mice. phenotype could reflect functional redundancy with RIG-I in neurons. a lack of expression of MDA5 is not expressed in uninfected cortical neurons in culture. it is possible that a cell-intrinsic antiviral effect occurs in other cell types. type I IFN production was sustained in MDA5/ mice infected with encephalitis virus, a closely related flavivirus. augmented inflammatory responses have been reported, which may contribute to the pathology observed in virus-infected MDA5/ mice. TMEV, and HMPV infection, reduced levels of several proinflammatory cytokines were observed after infection with rhinovirus and SeV (40\u201343). this variable role for MDA5 in inflammatory cytokine induction may reflect the specific PRR interactions or cellular tropism of each virus. MDA5 is not the only RLR that regulates CD8+ T cell function. CD8+ T cell dysfunction in LGP2/ mice also contributed to WNV pathogenesis. this was associated with effects on CD8+ T cell death receptor-induced apoptosis."}
