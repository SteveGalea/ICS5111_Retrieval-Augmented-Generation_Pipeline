{"summary": "ALI is characterized by intense transepithelial leukocyte infiltration, exudate accumulation in the lungs, loss of integrity of the alveolar-capillary membrane, and tissue damage. this response has been suggested to be due to increased production of inflammatory mediators including cytokines (TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6), especially by alveolar macrophages and neutrophils. leaf hydroalcoholic extract was collected at the tico seabra Herbarium of the Universidade Federal do Maranho in Sao Luis, Maranho, Brazil. a voucher specimen was deposited (voucher number 01002) the leaf hydroalcoholic extract was prepared. nebulizing gas was nitrogen (N2) flowing at 7 ml/min, a sheath gas provided at a pressure of 27 psi. helium was used as the collision gas. ALI was induced by a single intranasal (i.n.) instillation of LPS (30,000 EU in 50 l/animal and 25 l/narine) mice were culled by anesthetic overdose with ketamine (120 mg/kg, i.p.) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected. RT-qPCR assays in the Lung Tissue TNF-, IL-6, IL1-, and IL-10 mRNA expression in lung samples was determined by RT-qPCR. total RNA was extracted by using a RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) albumin measured as it is an indicator of plasma extravasation. readings obtained were compared with those of a standard curve of albumin. results are expressed as mg of albumin per ml of BALF. cells (1 105 cells/well) were treated with EAFPg (50\u2013100 g/ml), kaempferol (25\u2013100 g/ml), or dexamethasone (2\u20134 g/ml) and stimulated with LPS (10 g/ml; 30,000 EU/well/100 l; Sigma, St. Louis, MI, USA), at noncytotoxic concentrations. cells were incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% tico seabra Herbarium of the Universidade Federal do Maranho in Sao Luis, Maranho, Brazil [8] and a voucher specimen was deposited (voucher number 01002) the leaf hydroalcoholic extract was prepared, and the EAFPg was obtained as previously described [8]. the nebulizing gas was nitrogen (N2) flowing at 7 ml/min, a sheath gas provided at a pressure of 27 psi, while helium was used as the collision gas. the compounds were identified on the basis of their molecular ion mass fragmentation. four hours after the challenge, mice were culled by anesthetic overdose with ketamine (120 mg/kg, i.p.) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected. an aliquot of the BALF was separated and used for quantification of leukocyte counts and the rest centrifuged at 400 g for 10 min. total RNA was extracted by using a RNAeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) samples were treated with DNase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and then reverse-transcribed using 200 U of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase. qPCR assays were carried out in 96-well plates using a double-stranded DNA dye (GoTaq\u00ae real-time PCR Master Mix from Promega) the density of leukocytes/unit area (130 m2) was determined by counting the number of cells on the integrating eyepiece that fell into areas of the bronchioli and distal lung parenchyma. two independent researchers performed blinded analyses. animals were randomly distributed into six groups (n = 6/group) for lung analysis and five groups (n = 6/group) for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis. mice received a single oral administration (p.o.) of vehicle (saline, 10 ml/kg), EAFPg (30\u2013300 mg/kg), or dexamethasone (5 mg/kg) prior to the challenge. aliquot of the BALF with T\u00fcrk solution (1 : 20) another aliquot (50 l) was used for differential cell counts. a minimum of 200 leukocytes was considered. a third researcher performed the analysis. albumin levels in BALF samples were measured by the Bradford method. results are expressed as mg of albumin per ml of BALF. all experiments were performed in triplicate. cells were cultured and maintained in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic solution. cells (1 105 cells/well) were treated with EAFPg (50\u2013100 g/ml), kaempferol (25\u2013100 g/ml), or dexamethasone (2\u20134 g/ml) and stimulated with LPS (10 g/ml; 30,000 EU/well/100 l; Sigma, St. Louis, MI fetal bovine serum contains 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic solution. cells were stimulated with LPS (10 g/ml; 30,000 EU/well/100 l; Sigma, St. Louis, MI, USA) cells were incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. p values 0.05 were considered statistically significant. p values 0.05 were considered statistically significant. pretreatment with EAFPg at 30 mg/kg markedly reduced the collagen deposition with leukocyte infiltration. animals pretreated with dexamethasone also displayed attenuated lung inflammation (Figures 2(f) and 3(f)) leukocyte counts in the bronchial (g) and alveolar parenchyma areas (h) data is expressed as mean SD. signs were calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by the newman-Keuls multiple comparison test analysis. treated LPS-stimulated mice were stained with masson's trichrome. sections (4 m) were stained with masson's trichrome. plasma Extravasation and BALF TNF- Levels Are Reduced in Mice with ALI Treated with EAFPg Albumin and TNF- protein levels were augmented in BALF samples obtained from mice with ALI. both EAFPg (100 mg/kg) and dexamethasone diminished the levels of TNF- (a), IL-10 (b) and albumin (c) levels in the BALF. EAFPg Prevents Leukocyte Accumulation into the Alveoli Mice with LPS-induced ALI had increased numbers of total and differential leukocytes in their BALF. in contrast, EAFPg- (100 mg/kg) pretreated mice with ALI had significantly lower numbers of leukocytes in their BALF in comparison with vehicle-treated mice. significances were calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by the Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test analysis. p 0.05 differs from saline-injected mice and versus nonpretreated LPS-installed mice. p 0.05 differs from saline-treated cells; #p 0.05 differs from vehicle-treated LPS-stimulated cells. HPLC/DAD chromatogram of the acetyl acetate extract of pomegranate leaves (EAFPg) monitored at 327 nm (a) the effects of EAFPg (30\u2013300 mg/kg) and dexamethasone (5 mg/kg) on the lung tissue of mice with LPS-induced ALI. animals with ALI showed an intense inflammatory cell influx surrounding the bronchi. methasone markedly reduced the bronchial (7.5% 0.6%, 7.0% 0.1%, and 6.7% 0.3%, resp.) when compared with that of the ALI control group. p 0.05 differs from saline-treated mice; #p 0.05 differs from vehicle-treated LPS-stimulated mice. dexamethasone treatment significantly downregulated lung TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6 mRNA expression in the lungs. dexamethasone treatment significantly downregulated lung TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6 mRNA expression. AFPg (30 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, and 300 mg/kg, p.o.), dexamethasone (DEXA, 5 mg/kg, p.o.), or vehicle (PBS, p.o.) the values are presented as the median and interquartile range. the values are presented as the median and interquartile range. Mice received in the prophylactic scheme EAFPg (30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg, p.o.), dexamethasone (DEXA, 5 mg/kg, p.o.), or vehicle (PBS, p.o.). significances were calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by the Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test analysis. animals were randomly distributed into five groups (n = 6/group) Mice received in the prophylactic scheme EAFPg (30 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg, p.o.), dexamethasone (DEXA, 10 mg/kg, p.o.), or vehicle (PBS, p.o.) significances were calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by the newman-Keuls multiple comparison test analysis. 3.7. EAFPg and Kaempferol Reduce NO Release by Macrophages NO production was reduced in LPS-activated macrophages incubated with EAFPg (50\u2013100 g/ml) or kaempferol (25\u2013100 g/ml) p 0.05 differs from vehicle-treated LPS-stimulated cells. ellagic acid reduces cyclooxygenase-2- (COX-2-) induced exacerbation of inflammation, vascular permeability changes, and neutrophil recruitment to the BALF of mice with ALI induced by acid. kaempferol was found to be the major compound in EAFPg. cytokine mRNA expression was potently attenuated in the same mice. the hydroalcoholic extract from pomegranate leaves reduces TNF- mRNA expression in peritoneal leukocytes obtained from rats with acute peritonitis.
