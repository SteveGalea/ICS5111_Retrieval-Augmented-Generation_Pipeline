{"summary": "different trends in modern medicine give rise to a changing understanding of how treatment of diseases can work. diagnostic is changing dramatically because it has to be more versatile because more parameters have to be determined, be more frequently available, e.g. for a near-term therapy control move back to the patient and be miniaturized for \u201cpatient-friendly\u201d use. a lab-on-chip system was developed by seven Fraunhofer institutes. the system consists of two parts: a credit-card sized cartridge and a read-out/processing unit (5). the system is able to be produced by means of a serial and automated production. electrode array consisting of 16 different gold-electrodes based on a silicon wafer. in case of the electrode array capture molecules such as antibodies are immobilized onto the gold-electrodes. for detection, a secondary antibody labeled with a redox-enzyme is used (7). the principle of microarrays can be adapted to different types of assays. in this case small molecules or proteins known as biomarkers are bound by the immobilized capture molecules. after binding of the target molecule a secondary antibody is used. this is labeled with a fluorescent dye and can bind the analyte from the opposite side. a concentration dependent signal could be found specifically for the CRP-binding antibody but not for the other antibodies BIO I-IV in the same assay panel. the specific CRP detection is possible between 0.25-2 g/mL within this five-parameter assay panel. synthesis of the derived poly-peptidic structures a peptide microarray was spotted to evaluate specifically binding peptides. the assay structure is as follows: Specific linear peptide epitope as capture molecule, antibody from human sera as analytical target and an anti-human antibody which is fluorescently labeled as detection antibody. the assay has to run fully automated within the read-out device. a reaction protocol of about 18 minutes was also carried out. the system was designed to be producible. vD-platform can be described as a lab-on-chip system which consists of two parts: a credit-card sized cartridge and a read-out/processing unit (5). a membrane located below reagent reservoirs is deflected and pushes actively the reagents or the sample into the lab-on-chip device. the innovative pumping system enables a simplification since no error-prone liquid interfaces are needed. signal generation is conducted via the interconversion of an electro-active substrate. the other sensor type is based on an optical transducer based on the principle of \u201ctotal internal reflectance fluorescence\u201d (TIRF) (8). in this case, capture molecules such as antibodies are immobilized onto a polymeric slide based on cyclic-olefin polymer (COP) a secondary antibody is used after binding of the target molecule. this one is labeled with a fluorescent dye and can bind the analyte from the opposite side. a second antibody is then labeled since then just one antibody has to be labeled. serological assays are an important class of assays, especially for autoimmune diseases, allergies or infectious disease screening. the analytical targets are antibodies from patients\u2019 blood showing the exposure and immunization with a certain antigen. in case of autoimmune diseases, these analytical targets are components from the human body itself. antibody assay One type of diagnostic assay is based on the specific binding of antigens. small molecules or proteins are bound by immobilized capture molecules. a secondary antibody is used after binding of the target molecule. this one is labeled with a fluorescent dye. this type of \u201cenhanced\u201d sandwich assay was used in this study. as an example, the simultaneous detection of five different biomarkers is shown. the description is focused to the detection of the C-reactive protein (CRP) as a biomarker CRP can be used to trace inflammations in the human body. for allergies these are components from external allergens. in case of infectious disease screening these are epitopes from viral or bacterial origin. serological assays for antibodies against different viral target structures were developed (9, 10) specific detection a microarray can be used to circumvent amplifications methods such as helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) the use of isothermal amplification methods such as helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) can be used. production technology The Fraunhofer ivD-platform was developed as a technology platform for bringing microarrays to the patient\u2019s bedside. already established assays have to be transferred onto the Fraunhofer ivD-platform design. to match targeted prices on the regulated health-care market."}
