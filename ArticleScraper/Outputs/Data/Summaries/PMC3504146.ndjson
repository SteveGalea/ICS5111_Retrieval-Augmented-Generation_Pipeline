{"summary": "ezrin membrane-actin linker interacts with S endodomain through the F1 lobe of its FERM domain. expression of the ezrin dominant negative FERM domain enhanced cell susceptibility to infection by S-pseudotyped particles and potentiated S-dependent membrane fusion. the viral envelope glycoprotein Spike (S) is a highly glycosylated trimeric type I membrane protein, which forms the typical spike structures at the envelope of coronaviruses. the viral envelope glycoprotein is responsible for binding to cellular receptors and envelope fusion with host cell membranes. the N-terminal ectodomain and the C-terminal endodomain are most likely 1193 and 39 amino-acids long. a palmitoylation-null mutant S protein is deficient for partitioning into detergent resistant membranes. other regions within the endodomain may also regulate fusion and S-mediated entry into susceptible cells [17]\u2013[19]. ezrin is found in a cytosolic dormant state where the C-terminal ERM-association domain, the C-ERMAD, and the N-terminal FERM domains interact with each other, quenching protein binding sites. Activation opens up the molecule and releases the FERM and C-ERMAD domains, which are then free to interact with membranes and signaling molecules. a genomic yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using the SARS-CoV S endodomain as bait. a random-primed cDNA library from human placenta was screened. the most prominent result of the screen was the identification of the interaction between S endodomain and the cellular protein ezrin. 82 cDNAs corresponding to ezrin found in yeast two-hybrid screening. the domain was named ezrin F1/Spike Binding Domain (SBD) the region in light grey represents amino-acids of the FERM domain. Glutathione-sepharose beads alone and GST protein fused to the ezrin FERM domain and bound to beads (GST-FERM) were used as negative and positive controls. GST-Sendo could coprecipitate ezrin in a dose-dependent manner. lysate was used as input control which represents 1.6% and 4% of the volume used for the pull down for A. and B. respectively. the GST-Sendo could precipitate the Vero E6 endogenous ezrin protein (Fig. 2B lanes 2\u20133). glutathione-conjugated beads and GST-coupled beads could not pull down ezrin. both 8 and 19 truncations were able to significantly diminish interaction with ezrin at similar levels. however, the acidic stretch does not appear involved in the interaction. lysate was incubated with Glutathione-Sepharose beads coupled with GST, GST-Sendo wt, GST-Sendo 8 C1-4, and GST-Sendo 19 C1-4, GST-Sendo C, GST-Sendo K1227A, GST-Sendo C1-4 (C.) using 1 or 5 g of each GST fusion protein. endodomain truncations and cysteine to alanine mutations of the SARS-CoV S endodomain were found to diminish interaction with ezrin individually. a truncation mutant was tested where the positively-charged residue lysine 1227 and the polar residue threonine 1220 were point-mutated into alanines. determinants of interaction of SARS-CoV S endodomain with ezrin in vitro. to mimic SARS-CoV entry, we used Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles. ezrin accumulates at sites of entry of SARS-CoV S pseudotyped particles. rin were inoculated with lentiviral particles harboring a GFP-tagged Vpr protein (SARSpp GFP-Vpr) on ice for 30 minutes. internalization of particles was induced by placing the culture dish in a 37\u00b0C 5% CO2 chamber. at 30 minutes post temperature switch (t = 0), cells were analyzed by TIRFM. knock down of ezrin by siRNA increases entry of SARS-CoV S pseudotyped particles. ezrin binding to S endodomain negatively regulates SARSpp entry. a deletion of the last 8 amino acids of the C-terminus (S8) could have severe consequences on fusion [14]. we also generated a second S mutant with only a deletion of the 8 last amino acids of the C-terminus (S8), a modification which should partially alter interaction with ezrin. the difference in fold-change that was observed for S8 incorporation into pseudoparticles and cellular transduction suggests that partial disruption of interaction with ezrin contributes to this enhancement of transduction. ezrin binding to S endodomain decreases entry of viral particles. rin (ezrinwt) or the N-terminal FERM domain of ezrin (ezrinFERM) fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) the latter form of ezrin is known to have a dominant negative effect on endogenous ezrin [26] clones GFP-ezrinwt and GFP-ezrinFERM had means of fluorescence intensities of 2103 and 7102, respectively. cell lines were infected with SARS-CoV (strain HK39849) at M.O.I. of 5. 24 h post-infection, cells were immunolabeled for SARS-CoV S. normalized N levels ranged between 3.2104 and 3.6. 104 cells reached approximately 2.6106 at 24 hours post-infection. similar profiles were observed for qRT-PCR on viral ORF1b. expression of the dominant negative FERM domain of ezrin slightly enhances early, but not late stages of infection. we investigated levels of transduction of control, GFP-ezrinwt and GFP-ezrinFERM clonal Vero E6 cells by SARSpp. clone GFP-ezrinFERM is more permissive to SARS-CoV S-mediated entry and is consistent with higher rates of infection observed with SARS-CoV in this cell line. a new batch of polyclonal cells expressing GFP-ezrinFERM was generated. as control, we used vero E6 cells transduced to express a non-relevant HcRed protein. expression level of GFP-ezrinFERM was monitored by flow cytometry. these cells were used to carry out infections using SARSpp. control HeLa HcRed cells were not able to fuse with any of the three vero E6 cell lines. no syncytia were observed for HeLa HcRed Spike cells incubated with either GFP or GFP-ezrinwt vero E6 cells after trypsin activation. inferM cells were overlaid on HeLa cells expressing HcRed alone or HcRed and SARS-CoV S. cells were fixed, nuclei stained with DAPI and analyzed by microscopy for syncytia. results are representative of three independent experiments. the interaction was classified with high confidence score (Predicted Biological Score = A; Fig. 1A) and was not found in parallel screens performed with other viral baits [33], [34] and data not shown. these data indicate that ezrin specifically interacts with SARS-CoV S endodomain in yeast. ezrin cDNA sequences were aligned using ClustalW multiple sequence alignment program. all ezrin cDNA shared a common sequence of 264 base pairs corresponding to amino acids 6 to 93. this region corresponds almost completely to the F1 lobe of the N-terminal FERM domain. endodomain of S pulls down ezrin from HeLa cell lysate. cell lysate was incubated with Glutathione-Sepharose beads bound either to GST fused to Sendo. GST protein alone was not able to pull down ezrin. s of SARS-CoV S endodomain are responsible for the interaction. the last 8 carboxy-terminal residues and the membrane proximal cysteine cluster of SARS-CoV S endodomain are involved in ezrin binding in vitro. analysis of the S endodomain sequence revealed three regions with distinctive characteristics. eight carboxy-terminal amino-acid stretch is important for ezrin binding. another motif in the endodomain may contribute to the interaction. the acidic stretch does not appear involved in the interaction. we analyzed the implication of the nine cysteines in the interaction with ezrin. these residues are found in the membrane proximal region of the S endodomain. mutation of the cluster C1 significantly reduced binding to ezrin. the truncation almost completely abrogated the interaction with ezrin. the point mutation on the lysine K1227 did not significantly affect binding with ezrin. the cysteine mutations (C1-4) were not able to bind ezrin. cells were analyzed using a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope. green dots corresponding to GFP-Vpr SARSpp were readily observed. this result indicates that ezrin is present at sites of SARSpp entry. this could suggest that after the formation of the fusion pore, S endodomains facing the host cell cytosol have the possibility to interact with ezrin molecules. HeLa-F5 cells stably expressing the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 were transfected with siRNAs that target ezrin mRNA or non-targeting control siRNAs. the ezrin siRNA transfection decreased expression significantly, with a quantified 80% knock down at the protein level. envpp indicates lentiviral particles without any viral surface glycoprotein. the fold change in luciferase activity was calculated using the non-targeting siRNA condition as negative control. entry of mutated S pseudotyped particles along with wt S SARSpp was analyzed in SARS-CoV-susceptible Vero E6 cells. both mutated SARSpp were found to transduce Vero E6 cells more efficiently than wt S SARSpp. a 2-fold increase in transduction was measured for S8 C1 SARSpp. clonal Vero E6 stable cell lines express wild-type ezrin (ezrinwt) or the N-terminal FERM domain of ezrin (ezrinFERM) fused to the green fluorescent protein. clones GFP-ezrinwt and p24 had means of fluorescence intensities of 2103 and 7102, respectively. clones GFP-ezrinwt and GFP-ezrinFERM expressed similar levels of ACE-2 receptor at cell surface. expression of the FERM domain of ezrin increases Vero E6 cell susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection. the stable cell lines and control Vero E6 cells were first infected with SARS-CoV. infection levels were then monitored by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) on the viral N gene at 3, 6 and 24 hours post infection. all cells were stained for either actin or nuclei. a 5.8-fold increase in the percentage of infected cells (15% of cells) was observed for the clone GFP-ezrinFERM cell line. expression of the ezrin FERM domain increases S-mediated entry. a new batch of polyclonal Vero E6 cells expressing GFP-ezrinFERM was generated. the cells were infected with SARSpp and incubated for 72 hours. the activity of luciferase was measured. the results are representative of at least three independent experiments. expression of the FERM domain of ezrin by target cells enhances S-mediated entry. previous functional experiments have demonstrated a negative regulatory role for ezrin during S-mediated entry. to characterize further this phenomenon, we questioned whether ezrin could be involved in the S-mediated fusion process. 8% of nuclei were found to be in syncytia in the condition where HeLa HcRed Spike cells were co-cultured with GFP-ezrinFERM cells after trypsin activation. this 2-fold increase of fusion linked to expression of FERM in target cells was consistently found in four independent experiments. target cells expressing the FERM domain of ezrin are more susceptible to S-dependent cell-cell fusion. two-tailed t-tests demonstrate for the first time an interaction between the membrane tethering protein ezrin and the endodomain of the SARS-CoV S envelope glycoprotein. our data point towards a novel role of ezrin as a regulator of early events of infection. radixin, which shares 76% amino-acid sequence identity with ezrin [24], was also identified in the yeast two-hybrid screening for its interaction with S endodomain. the fact that radixin was found in the screen suggests that other ERMs could be implicated in the life cycle of SARS-CoV. some reports show that ERMs may negatively regulate post-entry events by affecting stable microtubules. s as well as cysteines (particularly the juxtamembrane-most first cluster C1) were important determinants for binding with ezrin. the positively charged amino-acids found in the very last 8 amino-acids contain a KxHxx dibasic motif that was shown to function as an ER retrieval signal. ezrin is a scaffolding protein that links actin cytoskeleton and cholesterol-rich lipid domains at the plasma membrane. ezrin is important for extensions of lamellipodia and filopodia. ezrin enables the organization of membrane microdomains by controlling fluidity of membrane components. this process is extremely important in regulation of signalization by trans-membrane receptors and signaling molecules. ezrin enables compartmentalization of signaling molecules into microclusters and prevents their free movement to restrict signaling. al amino-acids, named T1247 in their study, was less efficient in mediating S-driven cell-cell fusion than wt S (34.01% of wt S) this was explained by an altered surface expression of S T1247 (79.15% of wt S) a study by Giroglou et al. has shown that a S protein variant with a deletion of the last C-terminal 27 amino-acids and addition of the eight most membrane- we have shown that S8 C1 can no longer bind ezrin in vitro. the higher incorporation level could be partly responsible for the enhancement of transduction. binding to ezrin may also contribute to modulate the efficiency of S-mediated entry. in other experiments, we have observed that significant overexpression of GFP-ezrinwt was able to enhance SARSpp transduction. we speculate that massive overexpression of GFP-ezrinwt has consequences on ezrin functions in the cell that can ultimately impact SARSpp entry. the use the dominant negative FERM domain or of siRNA appears more relevant to study the role of ezrin. in cytoskeleton restricts the opening of the fusion pore. disrupting the actin network enhances fusion pore widening. ezrin has a limiting effect on SARS-CoV entry. FERM lobes of a number of FERM-domain containing proteins have been described as mediating specific interactions with proteins or phospholipids at the plasma membrane. a region located between the F1 and F3 lobes is the site where inositol-(1,4,5)-triphosphate (IP3) interacts with the FERM domain of radixin. radixin, which shares 76% amino-acid sequence identity with ezrin a series of GST-S endodomain mutants showed that residues in the last 8 amino-acids as well as cysteines were important determinants for binding with ezrin. the positively charged amino-acids found in the very last 8 amino-acids contain a KxHxx dibasic motif. ezrin is present at the site of virus fusion Analysis of GFP-Vpr SARSpp entry in vero E6 cells by TIRF microscopy. a slight 2-fold increase in entry levels for HIV-gp-pseudotyped particles has also been observed. no significant increase has been detected for HA-pseudotyped particles. ezrin is a scaffolding protein that links actin cytoskeleton and cholesterol-rich lipid domains at the plasma membrane. ezrin provides rigidity to specific cortical areas of the cell by linking membranes to cortical actin. ezrin enables the organization of membrane microdomains by controlling fluidity of membrane components. the deletion of the last 8 amino acids of the S protein allowed pseudotyped particles to achieve higher transducing levels than wt S SARSpp. this finding further supports the notion that ezrin's interaction with S negatively modulates entry, although we may not exclude the possibility that higher S incorporation observed in case of S8 SARSpp also contributes in increasing viral entry. the greater efficiency of transduction of S-H2 pseudotyped particles was likely due to preferential incorporation of S-H2. further truncations altering cysteine residues have resulted in decreased transduction levels [18], [19] and deficiencies in cell-cell fusion [14]. ezrin is naturally abundantly expressed in the cells used in this study. expression of GFP-ezrinwt did not inhibit infection or fusion. in other experiments, we have observed that significant overexpression of GFP-ezrinwt has consequences on ezrin functions in the cell that can ultimately impact SARSpp entry. studies on influenza HA and baculovirus gp64 viral glycoprotein-induced fusion have revealed that while the initial pore formation step is controlled by the fusion protein, the subsequent steps of widening of the pore is a complex, multi-step mechanism involving cell metabolism and components. ezrin's role in the fusion pore expansion induced by SARS-CoV S has yet to be demonstrated. pcDNA-optS plasmid was generated from the pcDNA-optS-FLAG [58] construct. scaffolds interactions with S endodomains, impose a limitation on membrane fluidity and act as a physical constraint restraining completion of fusion. the pGEX-4T1 based plasmids encode the FERM N-terminal domain of ezrin (residues 1 through 309) fused to the GST. the pEGFP-Vpr plasmid encodes the sequence for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G glycoprotein cloned in the pUC19 vector. optimized SARS-CoV S genes with 8 or 8 with C1 cysteine to alanine substitutions at the C-terminus respectively were synthesized and cloned by GeneCust (Dudelange, Luxembourg) optimized lentiviral packaging plasmid [61], pcHMWS-HcRed1, pcHMWS-eGFP-IRES-puromycin and pcHMWS-eGFP-IRES-hygromycin transfer d with the SARS-CoV S (SARSpp), SARS-CoV S with 8 C-terminus deletion (S8 SARSpp), the VSV G (VSVGpp) envelope glycoproteins, or no envelope glycoprotein (envpp) were generated as previously described [56], [64] in HEK-293T cells. a human placenta random-primed cDNA library, transformed into the Y187 yeast strain, was used for mating. a predicted Biological Score was attributed to assess the reliability of the interaction, as described earlier [67]. GST pull down assays GST fusion proteins were produced and coupled to Glutathione Sepharose beads as previously described [33], with minor modifications. small interfering RNA treatment Small interfering RNA (siRNA) reagents used were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, USA) a second round of siRNA transfection was performed 48 hours later. ezrin expression relative to -actin levels was done by Western blot of pooled lysates used for luminescence measurements. cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 1.5105 cells per well and infected with HK39849 at an M.O.I. of 5. Levels of viral gene expression were normalized to cellular 18S rRNA levels. cell-cell fusion assay HeLa cells stably expressing HcRed or HcRed and Spike were seeded onto glass coverslips in 24-well plates at a density of 0.75105 cells per well. after 16 hours, vero E6 cells stably expressing GFP, GFP-ezrinwt or GFP-ezrinFERM were overlaid at the same density. six hours later, cells were treated or not with 10 g/mL antibodies Rabbit polyclonal serum against the endodomain of SARS-CoV S was previously described. mouse polyclonal serum against the endodomain of SARS-CoV S was previously described. pGEX-GST-FERM encodes the FERM N-terminal domain of ezrin (residues 1 through 309) fused to the GST. the pNL4.3.Luc R+ E lentiviral vector was a gift from Dr. monique Arpin. pcHMWS-eGFP-ezrinwt-IRES-hygromycin and pcHMWS-eGFP-ezrinFERM-IRES-hygromycin were generated from sequences derived from pCB6-ezrin-VSV and pCB6-ezrinNter-VSV plasmids. pcHMWS-RFP-ezrinwt-IRES-hygromycin vector was VSVGpp were produced for generation of cell lines stably expressing GFP (VSVGpp GFP), HcRed (VSVGpp HcRed), ezrinwt/FERM fused to GFP (VSVGpp RFP-ezrinwt) and ezrinwt fused to RFP (VSVGpp RFP-ezrinwt), or SARS-CoV Spike (VSVGpp SARS-CoV Spike) lines Generation of clonal and polyclonal stable cell lines was performed according to standard procedures. cells were infected with VSVGpp enabling expression of different transgenes. cells were selected with hygromycin B at 250 g/mL for all cell lines. ezrin siRNA pool corresponds to an equimolar mix of 4 siRNA duplexes. negative control, non-targeting (NT) siRNAs were used (pool of 4 duplexes). a second round of transfection was performed 48 hours later. quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed using a light cycler 480 (Roche) levels of viral gene expression were normalized to cellular 18S rRNA levels. cell lines were seeded on microscopy chamber/slides at 105 cells per well. cells expressing GFP, GFP-ezrinwt or GFP-ezrinFERM were overlaid at the same density. six hours later, cells were treated or not with 10 g/mL of TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma) at 37\u00b0C for 15 minutes to activate S protein. after addition of FCS-containing medium to inactivate TPCK trypsin, the cells were incubated for 18 hours at 37\u00b0C 5% CO2 time-lapse images were acquired to follow movements of SARSpp GFP-Vpr particles during the internalization process at and beneath the plasma membrane of vero E6 cells expressing RFP-ezrin. fifty frames were acquired at 3 seconds intervals."}
