{"summary": "1,116 known extant species in 202 genera, bats constitute more than 20% of living mammal species. the family Vespertilionidae contains about one-third of all bat species and more than 100 species in the genus Myotis. bats display exceptional developmental and physiological characteristics. such endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) have been identified in nearly all vertebrate genomes examined (16\u201318) they often occupy a substantial fraction of mammalian genomes, accounting for about 8% of human (19) and 10% of mouse nuclear genome sequences (20) ERV integration events can often be dated, they provide a precious fossil record of past retroviral infections that have afflicted the host species or its ancestors. the overall diversity and evolution of ERVs in bat genomes remain largely unexplored. we take advantage of the recent public release of a high-quality, 7 genome assembly of the little brown bat Myotis lucifugus. generated for the Myoluc 2.0 genome assembly using tRNAscan-SE (33), and 32 retroviral-related protein domain profiles were downloaded from the Pfam database (34) to remove candidates whose reverse transcriptase domains were most closely related to those of non-LTR retrotransposons. 362 potential complete ERVs were classified into 13 families based on RT domain phylogeny and into 86 subfamilies based on LTR sequence similarity. we used MUSCLE (38), complemented by manual refinements, to build an amino acid multiple alignment of the RT domain from 177 full-length bat ERVs and 20 known exogenous and endogenous retroviruses. a previously estimated substitution rate (r) of 2.692 109 for the M. lucifugus lineage (44) was used for dating each insertion. 172 sequences formed our M. lucifugus ERV (MLERV) library. a Perl script was used to parse the RepeatMasker output to map solo LTRs. a potential full-length ERV was considered when a pair of similar LTR fragments were separated by less than 20 kb and the alignment of the pair spanned at least 100 bp. a given MLERV was considered present or absent at an orthologous locus when at least one end could be unambiguously labeled an occupied or empty site. a given MLERV was considered present or absent at an orthologous locus when at least one end could be unambiguously labeled an occupied or empty site. we identified 25,239 LTR candidates with pairs of putative LTRs and TSD using LTRharvest. all of them were annotated using MGEScan-LTR to identify potential complete ERVs. a Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction was built using MrBayes 3.1.2 (41) with two runs of 5 million generations. the tree was sampled every 100 generations, employing a mixed-rate model. the date of ERV integration was calculated as K/2r. RepeatMasker analysis. to generate a systematic annotation of ERVs in the M. lucifugus genome assembly, we first collected the LTR sequences and internal regions from complete elements. a perl script was designed to find orthologous loci of MLERVs in other bat genome assemblies. the first and last 100 bp of each MLERV plus 300 bp of their flanking sequences were extracted from the genome assembly and used as queries to search other genome assemblies using blastn. LTRdigest screens and annotates each internal sequence of the ERV candidates for putative protein-coding domains (e.g., reverse transcriptase, integrase, etc.), primer-binding sites (PBS) and polypurine tracts (PPT). a filter is then applied to retain complete or nearly complete ERVs based on the presence of a subset of these features. the LTR lengths of these 362 ERVs vary from 154 to 840 bp. the total internal lengths range from 2,291 to 12,503 bp. of the 362 ERVs, 252 (70%) have perfect TSD. 27 have identifiable TSD with 1 or 2 mutations. Phylogeny of 13 MLERV families and reference retroviral sequences. class I, class II, and class III ERVs are illustrated with blue, yellow, and green. reference retroviral sequences are shown in red. the program Vmatch clustered the 362 potential complete ERVs into 86 subfamilies (including 40 singletons) the two classification levels were congruent in that ERVs falling within a given subfamily also belonged to the same family. the total length of ERV-related sequences annotated by RepeatMasker amounted to 89 Mb. solitary LTRs typically arise as a result of intraelement recombination between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 LTRs of a full-length provirus. the size of full-length class I ERVs in M. lucifugus typically range from 6 to 9 kb. the difficulty in identifying class III ERVs using ab initio approaches has been reported for other mammals (52\u201358) the difficulty in identifying class III ERVs using ab initio approaches has been reported for other mammals (52\u201358) repeatMasker output provides a measure of sequence divergence for each DNA segment annotated to its closest consensus sequence in our ERV library. similar histories of ERV accumulation in the bat and human (and to some extent mouse) lineages are to be contrasted with the dramatic differences in DNA transposon activity. copy numbers of different ERV classes are shown in different colors. age was estimated by LTR pair divergence. the MLERV is present in the M. davidii genome with target site duplication. a precise empty site is found in E. fuscus. draft genome assemblies of Eptesicus fuscus and Myotis davidii were released. the time of divergence of M. lucifugus and M. davidii is predicted to be around 10 to 15 My (64\u201366) the age of the youngest MLERV insertions with occupied orthologous sites in E. fuscus was significantly underestimated by LTR divergence (5.4 My) this discrepancy between the results of the two dating methods could be caused by gene conversion homogenizing LTR sequences. de novo detection of ERVs in the M. lucifugus genome. first strategy relies on combination of LTRharvest (31) and LTRdigest (32). first strategy relies on combination of LTRharvest (31) and LTRdigest (32). a total of 362 distinct and potentially complete ERVs were identified in the M. lucifugus genome assembly (hereinafter referred to as potentially complete ERVs) of the 362 ERVs, 252 (70%) have perfect TSD, and 27 have identifiable TSD with 1 or 2 mutations. both methods produced trees with nearly identical topologies, allowing us to classify bat ERVs into 13 major families. representatives of the known retroviral classes were included in our phylogenetic analysis. we identified 6 MLERV families (MLERV1 to -6) comprised of 145 elements as class I ERVs (gammaretroviruses), 6 MLERV families (MLERV7 to -12) accounting for 157 elements as class II ERVs (betaretroviruses) and one family (MLERV13) represented by two elements as class III ERVs ( the program Vmatch clustered the 362 potential complete ERVs into 86 subfamilies (including 40 singletons) the total length of ERV-related sequences annotated by RepeatMasker amounted to 89 Mb. the total length of ERV-related sequences annotated by RepeatMasker amounted to 89 Mb. solitary LTRs typically arise as a result of intraelement recombination between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 LTRs of a full-length provirus. for class I ERVs, the approach identified 464 full-length proviruses and 35,404 solitary LTRs in the genome assembly. repeatMasker output identified 571 full-length and 81,967 solitary LTRs affiliated with class III ERVs. most class III ERVs are represented by highly decayed copies and nonautonomous elements. the difficulty in identifying class III ERVs using ab initio approaches has been reported for other mammals. ERV and DNA transposon dynamics in little brown bat, human, and mouse genomes are labeled with different colors. distance to consensus was corrected using the Jukes-Cantor model. most of the 362 complete ERVs invaded the M. lucifugus genome recently. most of the ERVs invaded after divergence from E. fuscus. the most recent active subfamily according to this analysis is MLERV3_15 of the ERV I class. we estimated that each of the 12 copies of MLERV3_15 have inserted within the last 2.5 My, including 4 copies with identical LTRs. these data suggest that the M. lucifugus lineage has been subject to many recent ERV infiltrations. in the E. fuscus draft genome assembly, we identified 35 MLERVs present at orthologous loci. 94 MLERVs were missing at orthologous positions. the majority of potential complete ERVs detected in M. davidii and E. fuscus integrated after speciation of E. fuscus and Myotis. insertions with occupied orthologous sites in E. fuscus were significantly underestimated by LTR divergence (5.4 My) similar trends were found in M. davidii (summarized in Table 2). this discrepancy between the results of the two dating methods could be caused by gene conversion homogenizing LTR sequences. 5 entries of internal (coding) ERV regions and 132 entries of LTR sequences for M. lucifugus in Repbase, a comprehensive database for transposable element sequences. we identified both LTR and internal sequences for 13 families and 86 subfamilies of ERVs, most of which were not reported in Repbase. however, through manual examination, several of the M. lucifugus LTR sequences deposited in Repbase were actually truncated at their the only class III family we detected ab initio in M. lucifugus is a relatively young family, with an age estimated at 4 My. the demographic profile of the three major ERV classes in M. lucifugus was more similar to that seen in the human genome. eutherian mammals classified ERVs to 13 families and 86 subfamilies. the most successful subfamilies are predominantly composed of env-less elements. the pattern of MLERV subfamily expansion brings further support to the superspreader hypothesis. in a recently active class I ERV subfamily, M. davidii identified one copy (entry 74) with apparently intact gag, pro, pol, and env coding regions. this suggests that both class I and II ERVs in M. lucifugus are potentially capable of autonomous replication and of producing infectious viral particles. we identified 362 potentially complete proviruses in the M. lucifugus genome. nearly 1,700 full-length ERVs and 130,000 solitary LTRs in the genome assembly. ERVs occupy 4.9% of the bat genome. several of the M. lucifugus LTR sequences deposited in Repbase were actually truncated at their 5\u2032 end. thus, our manually curated collection of 86 reference ERV sequences will be useful to replace existing Repbase entries. overall, the coverage of MLERV families newly identified in this study amounts to 23 Mb of the genome assembly, thus substantially improving the census of ERVs in this bat species. the demographic profile of the three ERV classes in M. lucifugus was more similar to that seen in the human genome. the bulk of class III ERVs likely predate the radiation of eutherian mammals. but the amplification of class III ERVs is much more recent and largely lineage specific. the hypothesis was supported by a detailed phylogenetic analysis of intracisternal A-type particles (IAPs) from several mammalian genomes. in lucifugus, we classified MLERVs to 13 families and 86 subfamilies. at the family level, we observed that the most successful subfamilies are predominantly composed of env-less elements. both class I and II ERVs in M. lucifugus are potentially capable of autonomous replication and producing infectious viral particles. together, these results suggest that both class I and II ERVs in M. lucifugus are potentially capable of autonomous replication and of producing infectious viral particles."}
