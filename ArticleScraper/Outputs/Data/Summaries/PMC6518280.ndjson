{"summary": "microbial flora of aerosols consists of viable and non-viable microorganisms. bioaerosols are ubiquitous in indoor and outdoor environments. they are generated from various natural and/or anthropogenic sources. biowaste facilities are characterized by notable concentrations of bioaerosols, due to the intense microbial activity involved in waste degradation. environmental hygienists insist that insufficient exposure assessments are a primary reason for the absence of bioaerosol exposure limits and strategies to mitigate risk. studies have identified the need to explore new alternatives and complementary approaches for assessing bioaerosol exposure. the upper respiratory tract includes the nasal cavity and the nasopharynx and is a primary pathway for inhaled air. study aims to explore the role of bioaerosols in the nasopharyngeal microbial content of pig farm workers. nasopharynx samples could be used as proxies for air samples in exposure assessment studies and for the determination of exposure markers. air samples were collected from eight WWTPs in the province of Quebec. summer visits occurred between September 2015 and July 2016. winter visits occurred between February 2015 and March 2016. a 1.5 mL aliquot was centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 g (J. Pilote protocol = 3 mL aliquot, 10 min, 21,000 g) the supernatant was discarded and the pellets were kept at 20 \u00b0C until DNA extraction. PCR was carried out in a total volume of 25 L containing 1 Q5 buffer (NEB, Ipswish, MA, USA), 0.25 M of each primer, 200 M of each of the dNTPs, 1 U of Q5 High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB) and 1 L of template DNA. the PCR reaction was purified using the Axygen PCR cleanup kit.

Negative controls were included in the plates as NTC (non-template controls). negative controls include unused swabs that underwent the same extraction protocol as the swabs collected from the subjects of this study. negative controls did not pass the next step of Illumina HTS. negative controls consisted of outdoor air samples that were taken outside the pig buildings sampled in this study. air samples were collected from eight WWTPs in the province of Quebec. summer visits occurred between September 2015 and July 2016. winter visits occurred between February 2015 and March 2016. pre-DNA Extraction Treatment From the 15 mL collecting solution of the Coriolis Biological Air Sampler (Bertin Corp.), a 1.5 mL aliquot was centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 g. the supernatant was discarded and the pellets were kept at 20 \u00b0C until DNA extraction. PCR thermoprotocol began with initial denaturation at 98 \u00b0C for 30 s followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 98 \u00b0C for 10 s, annealing at 55 \u00b0C for 10 s, extension at 72 \u00b0C for 30 s and a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 2 min. a fifty to 100-fold dilution of the purified product was used as a template for a second round of PCR.

IIME was used to assign taxonomy to OTUs based on the SILVA database reference training dataset for taxonomic assignment. a metadata-mapping file was produced that includes information about air and nasopharyngeal samples. all primers and probes were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. the primers, probes, hybridization temperatures, amplicon sizes and original references for all targeted genes are listed in Pilote et al. 2019 [55]. negative controls include unused swabs that underwent the same extraction protocol as the swabs collected from the subjects of this study. negative controls were not included in the analyses due to a low number of sequences. the sequencing depth was 15,000 sequences for all the groups of samples. the samples were divided into three groups: air from pig buildings, Pig farmers and non-exposed controls. the slope of the curves shows sufficient sequencing depth and good bacterial coverage in all samples. the higher the number of OTUs in a sample, the higher the value of the Chao1 index. in Shannon and Simpson diversity measures, richness is combined with abundance to obtain an evenness measure. the nasopharynx samples consistently showed the highest richness estimates and diversity measure values. alpha diversity analyses comparing nasopharynx samples of pig farmers and non-exposed controls and air samples from pig buildings. a distinct clustering of pig farmers, non-exposed controls, and air samples from pig buildings is also illustrated. the same statistical test was used to confirm the non-significant clustering of air and pig farmer (nasopharynx) samples. air samples from the pig buildings seemed to display less dispersion amongst its individuals than farmers and non-exposed groups. a, Proteobacteria, Bacteriotedes, and Firmicutes dominated the three profiles, representing more than 95% of the taxonomic abundance. however, major differences distinguished the pig farmer samples from the non-exposed controls. in the latter, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were the most abundant phyla. Clostridia had the highest relative abundance (24%) followed by Saprospirae (19%), Bacilli (18%) and Actinobacteria (11%). in the non-exposed control group, Bacteroidia represented 0.7% of the profile. the output of the test contains the test statistic, the p-value corrected for multiple comparisons, and a mean count for each OTU in the given sample group. the thirty taxa with the greatest significant differences in counts between samples from pig farmers and non-exposed controls are presented in Figure 6. taxa identified to highest possible taxonomic level with statistically significant differential abundances across pig farmers and non-exposed controls. first 15 taxa were the most abundant in samples from farmers and last 15 were more abundant in non-exposed controls. plot shows distances for microbiota of three groups of samples. nasopharynx samples from wastewater workers, non-exposed controls and bioaerosols from wastewater treatment plants. 8 air samples from pig buildings, 25 nasopharynx samples from farmers and 29 nasopharynx samples from the non-exposed control group resulted in 2,942,265 sequences. after quality filtering and the discarding of singletons, 1,190,166 sequences clustered into 6060 OTUs. pig farmers and air samples showed the highest average number of OTUs compared to non-exposed controls. pig farmers and air samples showed the highest average number of OTUs compared to non-exposed controls. Shannon values are bounded between 0 and 1, where 1 represents the most diverse case. nasopharynx samples from pig farmers consistently showed highest richness estimates. non-exposed controls displayed lowest values. the asterisks (*) indicate the statistical significance of the Mann-Whitney U tests (ns p > 0.05; ** p 0.01; **** p 0.0001). beta diversity An ecological analysis was conducted to reveal the variation in the community composition between the three sample groups. pairwise sample dissimilarity compares the nasopharynxes of farmers and non-exposed controls and air from pig buildings. clustering was statistically significant as confirmed by the PERMANOVA test (p-value = 0.0001). the slope of the curves shows sufficient sequencing depth and good bacterial coverage in all samples. pig farmers and air samples showed the highest average number of OTUs compared to non-exposed controls. measures in the air samples were nearly as high as the pig farmer nasopharynx samples. difference between air samples from pig farms and non-exposed controls was significant. the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) was used to visualize bacterial community variation. the profiles of pig farmers were more similar to the profiles of air samples than to the profiles of non-exposed controls. the same statistical test was used to confirm the non-significant clustering of air and pig farmer samples. taxonomic profiles show the relative abundance of each bacterial phylum across nasopharyngeal flora of farmers and non-exposed individuals and bioaerosols. the next step was to reveal the taxonomic distribution of the bacterial phyla across the three groups of samples. phyla names written in bold type were specific to farmers and air from pig buildings. class profiles showed notable differences between non-exposed controls and farmers/air from pig buildings. aryngeal flora samples from pig farmers, non-exposed controls and air samples from pig buildings were specific to farmers and air from pig buildings. the test compares OTU frequencies in groups of samples and ascertains if there are statistically different OTU abundances between the two groups of samples. the most notable imbalance was observed for the class Clostridia. the class Clostridia was present with a mean count of more than 800 sequences in non-exposed individuals and less than 10 sequences in the non-exposed controls. nasopharynx samples from wastewater workers did not cluster with air samples from WWTPs. difference between air and nasopharynx samples (controls and wastewater workers) was statistically significant. ium avium was not detected in the nasopharynx samples of either group. cephalosporin, and colistin resistance genes were present at a higher frequency among pig farmers compared to non-exposed controls. Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteriotedes, and Firmicutes dominated the three groups of samples, representing more than 95% of the taxonomic abundance. but major differences distinguished the pig farmer samples from the non-exposed controls. in the latter, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were the most abundant phyla. illi (11%), Gammaproteobacteria (10%) and Betaproteobacteria (8%) represented more than 90% of the taxonomic profile. in the non-exposed control group, Bacteroidia represented 0.7% of the taxonomic profile. the results output of the test is presented in Additional file 1 (Supplementary Materials) it represents the results of the Mann-Whitney U test to determine the statistical differential abundance of taxa in nasopharynx of workers and non-exposed controls. taxa identified to highest possible taxonomic level with statistically significant differential abundances across pig farmers and non-exposed controls. first 15 taxa were the most abundant in samples from farmers and last 15 were more abundant in non-exposed controls. the difference between non-exposed controls and wastewater workers was not significant (PERMANOVA p = 0.1). the plot shows the distances for the microbiota of three groups of samples: nasopharynx samples from wastewater workers and non-exposed controls and bioaerosols from Wastewater Treatment Plants. the results are expressed in percent of subjects in which pathogens or genes were detected. the bacterial populations in bioaerosols from pig buildings were compared to those of the nasopharyngeal flora of farmers. all four of the alpha diversity measures revealed greater bacterial richness and diversity in the nasopharyngeal samples from pig farmers compared to non-exposed individuals. a higher prevalence of viruses in the nasopharynxes of farmers compared to the non-exposed control group could play a role in the increased alpha-diversity. the distance metric was used as efficacy was proven with 16S rRNA bacterial genes. PCoA coupled with PERMANOVA offers a robust statistical significance of sample grouping using distance matrices. it is based on the ANOVA experimental design but analyses the variance and determines the significance by permutations. ten thousand litres of air are inhaled daily and the bioaerosols in the air may have an effect on the human nasal microbial community. farmers working with different animals may have a different disturbances of their natural nasopharyngeal flora. the high abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteriotedes in pig buildings has been shown. the rate of colonization of Moraxella spp. in healthy adult populations is around 3%. taxa identified exclusively in nasopharyngeal samples and air samples from pig buildings could be candidates for new markers to assess exposure to bioaerosols in pig farming environments. emer and colleagues found a distinct clustering between samples from the nasal cavities of pig farmers and air samples from their workplace. emer and colleagues also found a distinct clustering between samples from the nasal cavities of cow farmers and air samples from their workplace. emer and colleagues, also found a distinct clustering between samples from the nasal cavities of cow farmers and air samples from their workplace. this confirms the hypothesis of a microbial fingerprint specific to the farming environment. studies of the microbiome of the upper respiratory tract may have underestimated the influence of occupational exposure when considering the effect of a particular disease. the fact that the work environment may affect the natural flora of an exposed person on a long-term scale is crucial when he/she becomes a patient whose upper respiratory tract microbiota is the target of the disease. mcr-1 gene was found in the nasopharynxes of half of the pig farmers in this study. the use of colistin is extremely regulated in north America and limited to multi-drug resistant microbes. a longitudinal study of the bacterial diversity could unveil a long-term variation in microbial content."}
