{"summary": "intrinsic cellular defense molecules are able to detect and restrict invading pathogens at the level of the infected cell. they either directly block a component of the pathogen\u2019s life cycles and / or signal to the innate and adaptive immune system to further control the infection. restriction factors that work in defined cellular locations against a common pathogen feature of infection may also have broad anti-influenza properties. the role of IFITM3 in vivo shows it is crucial restriction factor for preventing the onset of severe influenza viral infections in a knockout mouse model. the role of IFITM3 in vivo shows it is crucial restriction factor for preventing the onset of severe influenza viral infections in a knockout mouse model. Ifitm3-/- mice were phenotyped through pipelines at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. the virus does not enter cells through the endosomal pathway, adding further to the role of IFITM3 as a central antiviral restriction factor. x 105 colony forming units (cfu) Salmonella Typhimurium M525 containing TetC, (Fragment C of tetanus toxin, to act as an antigen for subsequent antibody quantification) on day 14 post-infection, four from each group of mice are culled and organs (spleen, liver and caecum) removed. a small piece of the distal colon was fixed in 4% formalin and processed to paraffin mycobacterium tuberculosis challenge Mice were infected by low-dose aerosol exposure with H37Rv M. tuberculosis using a Glas-Col (Terre Haute, IN) aerosol generator calibrated to deliver approximately 100 bacteria into the lungs. Bacterial counts in the lungs at each time point of the study were determined by plating serial dilutions of individual lung homogenates. plasma samples from infected mice were analysed using a BD FACS Aria II. bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was inflated five times with 1 ml of PBS and BAL fluid kept on ice. weight was measured daily to monitor disease severity. flow cytometry on a BD FACS Aria II gene was measured by quantitative RT-PCR for the RSV L gene using primers and probes previously described [27], with L gene copy number determined using a RSV L gene standard. a rotor-stator homogeniser, centrifuged and the supernatant collected for cytokine analyses were quantified using duosets from R&D systems. Ifitm3-/- mice were phenotyped through pipelines at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. animals were supplied with food and water ad libitum and monitored daily for signs of illness. at day 28pi, the remaining four mice are culled following a terminal bleed. the blood was allowed to clot then centrifuged when the serum was removed and used to detect TetC antigen specific antibodies by enzyme-linked immuosorbent assay (ELISA) mice were orally infected by gavage with 1 x 109 cfu of and followed for 28 days. a transgenic Plasmodium berghei ANKA reporter line, PbGFP-LUCCON (RMgm-28), constitutively expresses a fusion protein of GFP and Firefly Luciferase. mice were monitored twice daily and scored for clinical signs of neurologic disease. mice were infected intranasally (i.n.) with 5 x 105 plaque forming units (PFU) weight was measured daily to monitor disease severity. weight was measured daily to monitor disease severity. statistical significance was calculated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni's Multiple Comparison Test. results regarding mouse survival were analysed by a Log-Rank (Mantel-Cox) test. expression of Ifitm3 was absent in all Ifitm3-/- mouse organs, as expected, but was highly expressed in all wild type organs. spleen and lymph nodes indicated that Ifitm3 was predominantly expressed in the red pulp. salmonella Typhimurium challenge wild type and Ifitm3-/- mice were intravenously dosed with 1 106 CFU of S. Typhimurium M525 bacteria. all mice survived the challenge and gained weight over the time course of the study. type and Ifitm3-/- mice were orally gavaged with 1 109 CFU of C. rodentium bacteria and monitored for 28 days pi. bacterial counts revealed no significant differences between the genotypes. Counts in the caecum (total, caeceal patch and contents) and colon showed no significant differences in bacterial colonisation and clearance. analysis of the liver and spleen revealed no instances of bacteraemia in either wild type or Ifitm3-/- mice. the experimental challenge revealed no significant difference in phenotype seen in Ifitm3-/- mice compared with wild type littermate controls. n = 9 for wild type, n = 2 for each of Ifitm3-/- mutants (A) wild type and Ifitm3-/- mice were infected with 5 105 PFU of RSV-A (A2 strain) and were monitored daily for weight loss for seven days pi. mice were intranasally infected with 5 105 PFU of RSV-A. a significant increase in total cells resident in the lungs on day seven pi in Ifitm3-/- mice. a similar increase in total cellular infiltrate in the BAL fluid on day four pi. uninfected mice were assessed against a panel of phenotypic assays [24] incorporating a robust set of adult traits capable of detecting phenotypic variations. we observed no statistically significant differences across all of our key phenotyping categories, including those assessing immune functions compared to wild type control mice. NS Craniofacial NS Homeostasis / metabolism NS Nervous system NS The heatmap is built up of top-level terms from the MP ontology. significant results that deviate from the \u201cnormal\u201d murine phenotype are indicated by \u201cS\u201d, non-significant results are indicated by \u201cNS\u201d. bacterial counts revealed no significant differences between wild type and Ifitm3-/- mice. weight loss profiles showed that neither wild type nor Ifitm3-/- mice had overt signs of illness over the course of infection. faeces of wild type and Ifitm3-/- mice revealed no significant differences in bacterial burden between wild type and Ifitm3-/- mice. mice were orally infected with C. rodentium and weighed daily to monitor morbidity (A) mice were sacrificed on days 0, 7, 14 and 28 pi to calculate the bacterial burden in the lungs. bacterial growth kinetics of M. tuberculosis in the lungs of wild type and Ifitm3-/- mice. inflammatory cytokines IFN, tumor necrosis factor alpha and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 were analysed by cytometric bead array. n = 9 for wild type, n = 2 for each of Ifitm3-/- and Ifngr-/- mutants (A) Ifitm3-/- or wild type littermate control mice were infected i.n. with 5x105 RSV A2. viral load calculated by qPCR on days 4 and 7 pi (B) Flow cytometry revealed an increase in all cellular sub-populations in Ifitm3-/- mice relative to wild type littermates on day seven pi. inflammatory cytokines, including IFN, IL-6 and IL-1 revealed differences in their levels between genotypes of mice in the lungs and BAL fluid. rodentium (C. rodentium) is a non-invasive, Gram-negative bacterium used to model enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic infections of the gut [31,32], and mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) is an intracellular respiratory bacterium that replicates primarily within macrophages and dendritic cells, before forming latent granulomas in the infected organs eight SNPs in the IFN receptor, IFNAR1, have been associated with the development of cerebral malaria in children. phenotype seen in the RSV challenge is not as striking [6,38] infection in vivo is novel and supports associations seen in the mouse model [43,44], in airway epithelial cultures [45] and in blood from hospitalised infants [46]. RSV is proposed to bind to nucleolin via its F protein, which initiates hemifusion of the RSV envelope with the cell membrane. the role of all antiviral IFITM proteins as a layered defense to different virus infections remains to be determined."}
