{"summary": "human travel has accelerated in the modern age through technological innovations such as the motor car, air travel, and international shipping. human travel through migration, leisure, or business continues to increase in parallel with a population increase and the spread of affluence. commercial air travel has been particularly effective at transporting pathogens such as influenza viruses. the most significant is the rabies virus. infection leads to fatal encephalitis, for which there is no treatment. pre-exposure vaccination protects against the disease in mammals. the dog is the most important reservoir for the virus. natural transmission is through the bite of phlebotomine sandflies belonging to the genera Phlebotomus in the Old World. estimates of autochthonous human cases in Europe are approximately 700 a year. non-endemic countries in Europe encounter cases of canine leishmaniasis as a result of pet movements. rabies, echinococcosis, and leishmaniasis are common vector-borne diseases associated with dogs. the key zoonotic diseases associated with dogs are rabies, echinococcosis, and protozoan diseases. all mammals are susceptible to the disease, but only a small number are capable of acting as a reservoir species. transmission occurs following a bite from a rabid animal, usually a reservoir host. this allows the virus to bypass physical barriers, such as clothing and skin, leading to infection of peripheral nerves. rabies has declined in Europe since the second world war. but in its place the dominant reservoir for disease has been the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) this has been successfully controlled and eliminated from many countries by oral vaccination via distribution of baited vaccine. the frequency of such incidents has highlighted the risk of illegally importing rabid dogs from north africa. rigorous control procedures and contact tracing are required to ensure protection of the public and elimination of disease. only after 2 years in which no cases were reported could a member state claim freedom from disease. all mammals can develop alveolar cysts following ingestion of eggs. these continue to develop to the extent that infected organs, particularly the liver and lungs, are destroyed and the host dies. dogs can act as a definitive host and contaminate areas where humans come into contact with parasite eggs. leishmaniasis is caused by infection with leishmania protozoa. it comes in two forms, ie, cutaneous, affecting the skin, and visceral, with involvement of internal organs. the most prevalent cause of zoonotic disease is L. infantum. cases of canine leishmaniasis are regularly reported in countries of northern Europe where there are no indigenous vectors. there are no restrictions on dog movement directed at exclusion of leishmania species from the UK. incidence of human giardiasis reported to the EuroTravNet database by 16 centers in western Europe in 2011 was 3.7% of 5,965 ill travelers. intervention that include pretravel advice on behavior in endemic areas would reduce this burden of disease. all mammals are susceptible to the disease, but only a small number are capable of acting as a reservoir species. rabies virus is found in many species of new world bats. this includes many insectivorous and frugivorous bat species, and the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) the disease is a major public health problem. animal charity relocated group of stray animals from Sri Lanka to the UK. one of these animals developed convulsions and died shortly after arrival in a quarantine facility. one of these animals died shortly after arrival in a UK quarantine facility and was confirmed to be rabid. intermediate hosts include species such as the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) and field vole (Microtus agrestis) adult tapeworms, 2\u20134 mm in length, develop in the small intestine of the definitive host. the eggs contaminate the environment and are resistant to desiccation and low temperatures. in recent years, there has been a trend for increasing human cases of disease in Europe over the past two decades. the UK is considered free of the disease through surveillance in wild fox populations. dogs are particularly susceptible to infection with L. infantum, often causing fatalities. if suspected, the dog should be treated aggressively to control the infection. the disease is considered an emerging disease of companion animals in North America. giardiasis Giardiasis is caused by genotypes of the protozoa Giardia duodenalis. the parasite infects a wide range of mammalian hosts, including dogs and cats. giardiasis is caused by genotypes of the protozoa Giardia duodenalis. the parasite infects a wide range of mammalian hosts, including dogs and cats. the prevalence of human giardiasis varies across the world. all companion animals entering the UK with their owners on an approved route are checked for compliance with the rules of the EU pet travel scheme. a 6-month waiting period, tapeworm treatment prior to entry, and treatment for ticks for pets from the EU and listed third countries. the absence of the vector will prohibit the disease from becoming endemic, but this could change if the range of sandflies increases through various factors. however, the presence of infected imported dogs provides a potential risk of physical transmission of the protozoa to humans. the climatic conditions within the UK are not suitable for R. sanguineous to establish itself in the environment due to low winter temperatures. central heating in buildings provides a potential refuge for this species. there have been reports of R. sanguineous infestations in properties. zoonotic diseases are the causative agents of severe and significant disease in humans and have an increasing distribution in pet animal hosts. the diseases listed in this review have often been described as neglected15,76,77 and thus struggle to attract funding for diagnostic services or the attention of policymakers. the free movement of people in Europe is widely seen as a positive benefit of the EU. the free movement of people in Europe is widely seen as a
