{"summary": "EBV is a large double-stranded DNA gammaherpesvirus with about 170 kilobases in its genome. the virus is ubiquitous in the human population, establishing a lifelong latent infection in 90% of people by adulthood. LMP1 and LMP2 were discovered to colocalize in the membranes of latently infected lymphocytes [18]. these oncoproteins contribute to cancer progression via diverse signaling pathways. there are no approved vaccines available to prevent initial infection by EBV. there are no approved vaccines available to prevent initial infection by EBV. prior vaccine approaches particularly lacked potent induction of CD8 cellular immunity. clinical efficacy has been reported in the context of immunotherapy for human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven neoplasia. similar data has been reported impacting HPV-driven head and neck cancers. a multiantigen immunotherapeutic vaccine for EBV infection was developed. we focused on developing a vaccine cocktail consisting of the episome-maintaining EBNA1 antigen combined with the two important latency-related membrane antigens for EBV, LMP1 and LMP2. we report the immune potency and early impact of the combined immune responses to these constructs. anti-LMP2A clone 15F9 (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA), anti-LMP1 clone CS 1-4 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and a polyclonal anti-EBNA1 antibody were used for visualization. secondary anti-rat, -mouse, and -goat antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were used for visualization. SPOT mouse splenocytes were incubated for 24 hours with peptide pools. peptide pools were composed of 15mers overlapping by 11 amino acids. splenocytes were resuspended at 5 g/mL during stimulation. retrovirus-containing media harvested from these cells was used to infect TC-1 cells by spin-infection to generate a tumor cell line. cells expressing the GFP marker were isolated using FACS. single-cell cloning was performed to obtain a clonal cell population. gene Vaccines Latent protein vaccine consensus sequences for EBNA1vax, LMP1vax, and LMP2Avax were produced from sequences obtained from strains AG876, B95-8, and GD1. alanine mutations were made to functional domains of LMP1vax and LMP2Avax to avoid signaling through potentially oncogenic pathways. slides coated in poly-L-lysine had 293T cells grow on them in 12-well plates. they were transfected with pVAX empty vector, EBNA1vax, LMP1vax, or LMP2Avax DNA vaccine plasmids. cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized using Triton X-100 in P surface (for CD4 and CD8) and intracellular (for remaining markers) staining followed. eBioscience protein transport inhibitor cocktail (Invitrogen) antibody conjugated to fluorophores used in this experiment. tumor sizes were measured by taking their longest dimension as length and the perpendicular as width. multifocal tumors were separately measured, and their total volume was calculated as the sum of the individual volumes. p 0.05 was considered statistically significant. phylogenetic trees show close relationships between the vaccine antigens and known sequences from viral isolates. large deletions were made to repetitive sequences when engineering EBNA1vax. phylogenetic trees show close relationships between the vaccine antigens and known sequences from viral isolates. western blots showed the expression of vaccine antigens in untransfected cells. beta-actin was used as a loading control. antigens are labeled in green, and DAPI shows the nucleus in blue. bred mice were vaccinated with either the empty vector, individual EBNA1vax, LMP1vax, or a combination vaccine incorporating all three plasmids. groups of five mice received biweekly vaccinations and a week after the second dose they were sacrificed to have their splenocytes collected for analysis. IFN responses to latent protein peptide pools were evaluated using an ELISPOT assay. a more robust 340 sfu were observed for the same vaccine in C57BL/6 mice. the combination vaccine was much less immunogenic. the triple vaccine generated more robust CD4 and CD8 responses in mice. the responses induced appeared to be more potent for the induction of CD8 T cell immunity, with a smaller percentage of CD4 T cell induction. peptide pools show CD4 or CD8 responses of CD-1 mice immunized with triple vaccine or empty vector (pVax) cellular responses are driven by CD8+ cells, as shown by flow cytometry following stimulation of splenocytes. this cell line serves as a vaccine target for our LMP2A immunogens. anti-LMP2A antibodies were used as primary Abs. secondary Abs conjugated to AF647. two groups of five C57BL/6 mice received three biweekly vaccinations. consensus immunogens can focus the immune response towards conserved regions of important antigens, allowing for increased T cell cross reactivity and partially compensating for minor variability in the vaccine targeted antigens. modifications were made to remove repetitive sequences and to ablate oncogenic properties inherent to the proteins while preserving the structures of the antigens. the vaccine antigen designs use a SynCon sequence embedded in a pVAX plasmid. modifications were made to the consensus vaccine antigens to avoid potentially oncogenic properties and repetitive sequences. inbred mice were vaccinated with either the empty vector, individual EBNA1vax, LMP1vax, or LMP2Avax vaccine antigens. the animals were vaccinated with either the individual EBNA1vax, LMP1vax, or combination vaccine incorporating all three plasmids. splenocytes from a mouse vaccinated with EBNA1vax generated an average of 81 spot forming units (sfu) per million cells for the individual vaccine and 104 sfu for the combined triple vaccine in BALB/c mice. a more robust 340 sfu were observed for the same vaccine in C57BL/6 mice. two constructs were made, one with a short peptide fragment inserted at the C-terminus (LMP1tt30) and the other with a 256 amino acid fragment inserted after the leader sequence (LMP1ttDOM). this design improved the immunity generated by the fusion antigen vaccine. mice were vaccinated with a combination of EBNA1vax, LMP1vax, and LMP2Avax three times at biweekly intervals, followed by harvesting of their splenocytes a week after the final vaccination. cellular responses are driven by CD8+ cells, as shown by flow cytometry following stimulation of splenocytes. vax inhibits tumor growth in mice. DAPI is shown in blue, with LMP2A labeled in green. anti-LMP2A antibodies were used as primary Abs. discussion EBV is responsible for infectious mononucleosis, multiple premalignant conditions, and various EBV-driven cancers. these cancers include burkitt Lymphoma, Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, gastric cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, HIV-associated oral hairy leukoplakia. worldwide burden of EBV-associated cancer is approximately 150,000 deaths per year. this burden continues to grow. cellular therapies targeting EBNA1 and LMPs have shown improved outcomes against EBV-associated diseases. the high frequency of nasopharyngeal carcinoma concentrated in east Asia makes for a unique environment to test prophylactic and therapeutic approaches targeting the virus. the growing burden of EBV in the US suggests immunotherapy for nasopharyngeal and gastric cancer as well as association of EBV with more common autoimmune disorders may also be important to consider as amenable to robust immuno recent developments in the DNA platform in formulation, engineering and delivery by adaptive EP have led to improved immune potency and improved consistency in clinical studies. the vaccines were biased towards driving highly desired CD8 immunity against the vaccine targets over CD4 immunity. this bias may be particularly relevant for clearing virally infected cells by cytotoxic T lymphocyte induction that would ultimately kill tumor cells."}
