{"summary": "international travelers are potentially at risk of acquiring multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria and antibiotic resistance (AR) genes. acinetobacter species, particularly MDR A. baumannii strains, are associated with hospital-acquired pneumonia. pharyngeal and rectal swabs were used to determine if pilgrims might have acquired MDR bacteria during the 2014 Hajj. data were obtained between 19 September and 12 October 2014 (24 days) from a cohort of pilgrims that was traveling from France to mecca in Saudi Arabia. inclusion in the study was voluntary, and participants were asked to sign a consent form. Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) for pharyngeal swab samples or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for rectal swab samples was added. a 250-l volume of each sample was transferred to 8 ml of Trypticase soy broth (TSB) and incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight. a flow diagram of the methods used to determine the acquisition of MDR bacteria during the Haj MICs of imipenem and ceftriaxone were determined using the Etest method. results were interpreted as recommended by EUCAST. DNA was then extracted from the pharyngeal and rectal swab samples. nonduplicate A. baumannii isolates were typed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) a CC was assigned for each group using six as the minimum number of identical loci for the definition of a CC and three as the minimum for single-locus variants. thoat swab samples were obtained from 98 (100%), 9 (9%), and 90 (91.8%) participants pre-Hajj, during the Hajj, and post-Hajj. rectal swab samples were collected from 92 (93.8%) pilgrims before, 1 (1%) pilgrim during, and 90 (91.8%) pilgrims upon their return from Hajj 2014. antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) was performed on Mueller-Hinton agar using the disk diffusion method and 16 different antibiotics. DNA was then extracted from the pharyngeal and rectal swab samples. blaOXA-48 and blaVIM genes were performed to identify A. baumannii and carbapenemase-producing bacteria in the pharyngeal and rectal swab samples. all nonduplicate MDR bacteria were searched for AR genes using PCR for carbapenemase and extended-spectrum -lactamase. for 67.4% of the pilgrims, this was their first pilgrimage to Mecca. 76 (77.5%) reported at least one respiratory symptom during the reported travel period. most frequently reported symptoms were cough, sore throat, rhinitis, and loss of voice. there were 35 specific species in the post-Hajj samples. none of the pharyngeal swab samples collected from pilgrims pre-Hajj tested positive for Acinetobacter spp. DNA was extracted from all the pharyngeal and rectal swab samples using real-time PCR targeting the blaOXA-51 gene. a total of 88 A. baumannii colonies from pharyngeal swab samples were tested. 109 A. baumannii colonies from rectal swab samples were tested. AST showed 43 different resistance profiles for the A. baumannii isolates. isolates from pharyngeal and rectal swab samples were susceptible to imipenem. one isolate showed resistance to most antibiotics; the exceptions were amikacin, rifampin, imipenem, and colistin. the strain number represents the pilgrim's number and the source of sample. a total of 35 unique STs were identified from 43 nonduplicate A. baumannii isolates. of the 30 STs found in a single isolate, 18 were reported to be new STs by MLST Pasteur: ST758 to ST775. the STs of 43 A. baumannii strains referred to in the text are indicated. blaOXA-72 in 1 post-Hajj pharyngeal swab sample (strain 149R1), blaNDM in 2 post-Hajj rectal swab samples (pilgrim 4, blaNDM-5; pilgrim 22, blaNDM-1), blaOXA-58 in 22 post-Hajj 98 pilgrims were enrolled in pharyngeal swab samples. 67.4% were female and 32 (32.6%) were male. the majority were of north african origin. pharyngeal swab samples from pilgrims pre- and post-Hajj tested positive for Acinetobacter spp. DNA was extracted from all the pharyngeal and rectal swab samples using real-time PCR targeting the blaOXA-51 gene. none of the samples taken before travel were blaOXA-51-like positive. both pharyngeal and rectal swab samples from three pilgrims were culture positive for A. baumannii and blaOXA-51-like positive. 88 colonies from pharyngeal swab samples and 109 colonies from rectal swab samples were tested. swab sample (strain 149R1) was resistant to imipenem. one isolate showed resistance to most antibiotics. the exceptions were amikacin, rifampin, imipenem, and colistin. a total of 35 unique STs were identified from 43 nonduplicate A. baumannii isolates. of the 30 STs found in a single isolate, 18 were reported to be new STs by MLST Pasteur: ST758 to ST775. the STs of 43 A. baumannii strains referred to in the text are indicated. the circles indicate that our STs belonged to a CC. blaOXA-72 in 1 post-Hajj pharyngeal swab sample. DISCUSSION MDR bacteria are becoming a major public health concern. they can spread to different environments through close contact, food, water, or animals. the hajj in particular is well-known to be a source of transmission of infectious diseases. blaOXA-72 carbapenemase gene has recently been reported in a plasmid. blaOXA-72 carbapenemase gene has led to imipenem resistance among pilgrims. pilgrim 149, who carried A. baumannii ST10 and imipenem-resistant strains, did not take any antibiotics during the Hajj. the same A. baumannii STs were found in both pharyngeal and rectal swab samples collected from the same pilgrim. the source and mode of transmission in the community are still not understood. hygiene should be taught and monitored to prevent and reduce the rate of MDR bacterial transmission."}
