{"summary": "a conceptual framework for understanding a reservoir of infection has been established through various studies that have emphasized different aspects of zoonotic diseases. however, empirical characterization of reservoirs often remains controversial and challenging. the most applicable and accepted way to investigate and define a reservoir emphasizes the annotation of a target group. simplicity and functional orientation of the presented framework allows for straightforward application but does not negate more complex populations. the same principles apply to multi-species systems and metapopulations. the accepted definition of a reservoir proposed by Haydon et al. proposes the requirements in two parts: the pathogen\u2019s maintenance in a potential population or community followed by a discussion on proof of a feasible transmission route. the two components are addressed separately but only together they demonstrate the existence of a functional reservoir. a high amount of phylogenetic relatedness of pathogens isolated from the non-target and target populations does not provide sufficient evidence for the involvement of a pathogen. the bacterium Treponema paraluiscuniculi (which causes syphilis in rabbits) is over 99% identical on the basis of the whole genome to the human pathogen T. pallidum (which causes human treponematosis), but does not infect humans. knowledge of the biology of the pathogen is essential to properly define a sequence and functional similarity threshold for a specific reservoir system. NT Feasible transmission route Time factor Pathogen Target Non-target Main transmission route High-genetic similarity Spatial and temporal connectivity Pathogen involvement Maintaining pathogen viability Example of longitudinal study Refs. a longitudinal approach is required to consider the dynamics of a potential reservoir system, including the influence of genetic variation in any given population. a longitudinal approach is required to consider the dynamics of a potential reservoir system, including the influence of genetic variation. non-target populations must be established; otherwise the non-target population remains a maintenance population with the potential to be a reservoir. for multi-species reservoir systems, the transmission route between the target and non-target populations may be indirect. the type of transmission route dictates the form of evidence needed to prove that a feasible transmission route exists between the reservoir and target. viable pathogen needs to be isolated during a transmission event. if the amount of viable and therefore infectious organisms is below the infectious dose, the particular transmission route is unfeasible. long-term investigations must focus on the transmission between the non-target and non-target populations. the use of laboratory animals or cell- and tissue-based assays can be advantageous when studying pathogenicity. but it cannot solely contribute to the understanding of the epidemiology of a pathogen, which is largely impacted by variables such as genetic diversity, co-infection, cross-protective immunity and spatial connectivity. the framework introduced in this study indicates the outstanding questions that future research should focus on to investigate the presence of a reservoir system."}
