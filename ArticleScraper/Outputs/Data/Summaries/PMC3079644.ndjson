{"summary": "the 2009 pH1N1(swine 'flu) pandemic (pH1N1) was the leading health story for eight of 24 weeks and was in the top 5 for 20 weeks. 353 news items were identified, yielding 3086 statements for analysis, with 63.4% related to the seriousness of the situation, 12.9% providing advice for viewers and 23.6% involving assurances from government. the global pH1N1 pandemic of 2009 has attracted research attention from virologists and infectious disease specialists. from the first reports of Mexican cases in late April 2009, what would become sustained Australian reportage rapidly turned to the likelihood of Australian cases involving perhaps epidemic and high mortality numbers. this period represents prolonged example of news coverage of an uncertain risk with the potential to become a major threat to public health. reportage had much in common with that for avian influenza. they were \"foreign\" in origin; threatened to arrive on australia's shores; their endemicity and expected virulence were uncertain; and prudent suite of behaviours were not prescribed as ways of minimising infection. a further degree of interest to pH1N1 and the way in which the government tried to communicate risk. no studies appear to have been published on how emerging diseases are treated by television news. tv news on a typical weeknight in australia can reach over a fifth of the population [33], while the highest state-specific newspaper reaches 1.3 million [34]. 353 news stories were identified, containing 3,086 statements. pH1N1 was the leading health story for eight weeks. the virus

729 100.0 About a third of these statements referred to the immediate need for the Government to develop, test and then news actors Of all statements, the majority were made by reporters (53.6, n = 1,653/3,086) and a further 21.5% (n = 662/3,086) by representatives of the government, including their medical officers. the remaining 12.8% were a combination of vox populi statements and comments from overseas officials, athletes or other stakeholders. despite the uncertainty surrounding the disease, statements made about pH1N1 were generally non-alarmist and reassuring, in keeping with findings related to newspaper coverage. a limitation of this study is that conclusions cannot be drawn about individual news stories in context. the emerging pandemic saw reportage fuelled by the daily release of data on new infections and deaths. infrequent advice mirrored advice for reducing contagion from common colds and 'flu' but overall this accounted for only 13% of all statements. occasional news incidents which belied any sense of banal risk may have fomented some dissonance in viewers. a cruise ship with infected passengers and crew was reported over several days. experts say the assurances being given were irresponsible or that the seriousness with which the threat was being taken and the public health measures put in place had been exaggerated. we recognise the limitations of accusing media of sensationalism or lack of balance in that it risks obscuring rather than clarifying the processes that influence media coverage. concerns over the catastrophic potential of foreign-origin infections had proved unwarranted twice before. authorities risked the charge that they had not done enough in the event that the disease caused many deaths. eric liu: if such measures were unwarranted, it would have been unacceptable for the government to promote risk reduction practices. liu: if such measures were unwarranted, it would have been unacceptable to
