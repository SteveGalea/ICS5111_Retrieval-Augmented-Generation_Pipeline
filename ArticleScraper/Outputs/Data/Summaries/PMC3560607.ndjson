{"summary": "between 330 million and 1.575 billion individuals suffer from influenza and influenza-like virus every year. the rate of vaccination against influenza is still at a very low level, which generates high social costs, not infrequently family tragedies in the case of irreversible complications of influenza. the most effective and cheapest way to combat influenza is through vaccination. influenza is a disease in which the continuous evolution of the virus is essential for the occurrence of seasonal epidemics in the human population and, from time to time, as pandemic influenza. regular vaccination is one of the few steps that may be taken to protect people, especially in high-risk groups, from the potential, serious complications of influenza. in the group of children aged 6 months to 14 years, only 1.1\u20131.6% were vaccinated. in the group of children aged 6 months to 14 years, only 13.4% of this population was immunized. the uptake of vaccine places Poland in the penultimate place in Europe (2010). the purchase of pandemic flu vaccine did not affect Poland. the decision should be considered as appropriate when taking into account the type of restrictions imposed on Poland by pandemic vaccine manufacturers. in accordance with manufacturers\u2019 requirements, the vaccine could not be available in pharmacies. the Advisory Committee on Immunization (ACIP) in the united states has recommended the routine vaccination against influenza of all individuals above the age of 6 months until late old age [19] therefore, in the epidemic season, vaccination is recommended for nursing mothers unless they were already vaccinated. vaccination of household members, caregivers of young children and of individuals who are in close contact with children under the age of 6 months. in 2010/2011, only 5.0% of the population was vaccinated despite the inclusion of the A/H1N1/pdm09 strain in the ternary composition of the vaccine against influenza. in the 2010/2011 epidemic season, only 5.0% of the population was vaccinated. Vaccines against influenza available in Poland are inactivated (containing fragments of killed influenza virus) they are not able to multiply in the body and cause disease, but produce a specific immunity directed against the influenza virus. the cost impact of influenza infection is between 76\u2013167 billion dollars. according to data from the u.s., depending on the influenza epidemic season, the cost impact of influenza infection is between 76\u2013167 billion dollars. adults aged 1921\u20131930 years of age, from 1931 to 1940 years of age, from 1941 to 1950 years of age, from 1951 to 1964 years of age, >64 years (2 dissertations) lack of doctors\u2019 greater acceptance for this form of prevention lack of awareness about the legal obligation of doctors to recommend vaccination insufficient knowledge about influenza and its complications cost, not only in individual cases, but in the whole country insufficient knowledge about the types of vaccines. the importance of virological diagnosis of respiratory infections, particularly influenza, is high, not only in medical, but also in economic terms. the appropriate use of currently available new influenza virus neuraminidase inhibitors, such as zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu), reduce the length of hospital stay. oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) have been present on the market for many years. the use of these drugs is indicated not solely for treatment of established infection, but also in prevention, including for post-exposure prophylaxis. clinical trials of a new antiviral agent, peramivir, are in progress. results of preliminary studies of this drug seem promising."}
