{"summary": "population-based study found low levels of risk literacy and poor preparedness practices among the general public. most commonly perceived potential hazards were infectious disease outbreak, typhoon and fire. researchers found that less knowledge about the causes of flood events was associated with lower flood risk perception. the study examines the profile and predictors of community disaster risk perception, awareness and household-based preparedness in Asia. the study population was the non-institutionalized population aged 15 years or above residing in Hong Kong. exclusion criteria included i) non-Cantonese-speaking respondents; ii) overseas visitors holding tourist visas to Hong Kong. telephone calls were made between 6:30pm to 10:00pm on weekdays and during daytime on weekends, to prevent over representation of the unemployed population. the subject undergoing the interview was chosen based on the \u201clast birthday method\u201d,10,11. 1,002 completed surveys were obtained from non-institutionalized, cantonese-speaking Hong Kong residents aged 15 yrs and above during the survey period. in general, the socio-demographic distribution of gender, population age structure and districts of the study population were comparable to the population data from 2011 census. only 26.1% (n=261) reported having ever received some form of first aid training. ownership of a first aid kit and non-perishable food and drinking water were less commonly reported. the younger age group (15-39 years) were associated with a higher likelihood of perceiving Hong Kong to have lower disaster awareness. having attained post-secondary education and above (OR=1.92; 95%CI=1.21-3.05, p0.001) and being religious (OR=1.39; 95%CI=1.02-1.90, p0.05) were associated with a higher likelihood of perceiving Hong Kong to have lower disaster awareness. study examined the perception towards disasters in a population-dense urbanized community. higher education such as secondary education (OR=3.87; 95%CI=1.43-10.49, p0.01) and post-secondary education (OR=5.15; 95%CI=1.82-14.56, p0.01) were associated with an increased likelihood of receiving first aid training. female (OR=0.54; 95%CI=0.37-0.78, p0.01) and being married (OR=0.63; 95% typhoons strike the city 4-7 times during the annual rainy season. fire accidents threaten life and cause damage and loss, for example, claiming 24 lives and causing 309 injuries in 2014. only 12.8% people regarded Hong Kong as susceptible to disasters. a high fatality rate of 17% 24 caused a large disruption in people\u2019s daily routines, resulting in a heightened risk awareness and concern for infectious disease outbreaks among the community. 73.2% of the respondents have heard of related measures to manage those disasters in Hong Kong. only a few people reported to have fire extinguishers at home. over 90% lived in public, subsidized or private estates where fire extinguisher facilities should already be installed in compliance with the Hong Kong Fire Safety Ordinance. only 28.3 % of respondents had all five items for household disaster preparedness. an inverse association was found in the elderly (65 years and above) between disaster risk perception and household preparedness compared with the younger age group (15-39 years old) the elderly had a significantly higher disaster risk perception (OR=2.55), which may result from having more experiences of casualty-inducing-disasters in their younger years. study found poor familiarity with preparedness items were common barriers to personal preparedness38,39. a nearby convenience store, lack of storage space and lack of storage space were common barriers to personal preparedness among the head of households25. further studies in china will be worthwhile to explore gap between perceived and real vulnerabilities, actual preparedness practices, and potential areas for strengthening health education. questionnaire was used to determine household preparedness. respondents may not have recognized the term \"disaster kit\" or \"emergency kit\""}
