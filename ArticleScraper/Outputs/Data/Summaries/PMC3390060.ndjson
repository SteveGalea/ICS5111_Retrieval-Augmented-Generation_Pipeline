{"summary": "ALI can be induced by various causes such as brain injury,[1]\u2013[4] enterovirus,[5],[6] Japanese B encephalitis,[7] and coronavirus. risk factors included septicemia, acid aspiration, infection, traumatic injury, fat embolism, ischemia/reperfusion, and other caused. a series of studies were carried out to elucidate the hemodynamic events involved in the neurogenic PE. in anesthetized rats, we measured the aortic and pulmonary blood flow. in rats with a right heart bypass, ICH produced severe pulmonary hypertension and PE. cerebral compression, there were edematous and hemorrhagic changes of the lungs. the rat is artificially ventilated. the whole rat is placed on a balance platform to record the body weight change. the whole rat was placed in a scale platform to measure the change in body weight (BW) since the lungs are completely isolated from the body, the changes in BW reflect the changes in lung weight (LW) the preparation can be accomplished in 15 min. nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) attenuated the ALI. the result suggests that NO is also involved. hypothalamic \u201cpulmonary edemagenetic center\u201d is not involved. merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) found marked iNOS expression in the lung parenchyma, suggesting iNOS may also be involved in the pathogenesis of ARDS in patients with enterovirus 71 infection. the pathology included alveolar hemorrhage, myocarditis, portal inflammation and interstitial nephritis. two cases died of ARDS following a hypercalcemia crisis caused by a parathyroid adenoma. iNOS activity in the alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells showed iNOS activity. ed by nonspecific and specific iNOS inhibitors such as N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), L-NAME, aminoguanine and dexamethosone. this study suggested that NO/iNOS, TNF and IL-1 were involved in the endotoxemia-induced ALI. risk factors causing ALI/ARDS include head injury, intracranial hypertension, [2]\u2013[4],[57]\u2013[62] sepsis,[12],[17],[35],[37],[39],[42],[44],[63]\u2013[66] and infections. experiments in vivo and in vitro have demonstrated that PMA is a strong neutrophil activator. oleic acid-induced ALI has several clinical implications. oleic acid-induced ALI has several clinical implications. chemokines, cytokines, neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde have been shown to be associated with several types of ARDS/ALI. the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators is regulated by transcriptional factors mainly nuclear factor-B. beta agonists to facilitate water removal and ion transport have been shown to be promising. these agents may also stimulate secretion of surfactant and have no serious side effects. propofol protects anesthetized rats from ALI caused by endotoxin. it depresses the sodium-and potassium-activated ATPase, but upregulates the iNOS mRNA expression. it also reduces cell aptosis caused by deforoxamine-induced hypoxia. N-acetylcysteine improved the LPS-induced systemic hypotension and leukocytopenia. it also reduced the extent of ALI, as evidenced by reductions in lung weight changes, exhaled NO and lung pathology. phorbol myristate acetate and oleic acid have been employed to induce ALI. pathogenesis of ARDS/ALI is complex. pentobarbital is capable of reducing the endotoxin-induced ALI. nicotinamide or niacinamide abrogates the ALI caused by ischemia/reperfusion or endotoxemia."}
