{"summary": "the first line of defence consists of the interferon family of soluble cytokines. the IFNs have anticancer, antiproliferative, antiviral and immunomodulatory functions1 through the expression of more than 300 IFNstimulated genes. viruses have been found to disrupt TLR signalling by interfering with adaptor molecule TRIF. retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIGI) and melanoma differentiationassociated gene 5 are negatively regulated by LGP2. the hepatitis B virus HBeAg protein uses its precore specific sequence to compete with TIR-containing proteins Mal and TRAM. a second class of PRRs is the retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIGI)like receptor (RLR) family. PB1F2 binds the transmembrane domain of MAVS, causing a drop in the mitochondrial membrane potential. hepatitis B virus protein HBx associates with and blocks the action of MAVS. japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) conceals its dsRNA among intracellular membranes. speciesspecific differences in the timing of the release of viral dsRNA account for the drastically different pathogenesis of JEV in humans compared with pigs. nuclear factorB (NFB) is held in an inactive cytoplasmic complex via interaction with its inhibitor, IB. Upon virus recognition, constitutively expressed interferon regulatory factor 3 is phosphorylated by the kinases TBK1 and IKK, leading to its dimerization and nuclear translocation. the Zaire ebola virus protein VP24 prevents the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase and the downstream activation of ATF2.39. critical factors involved in IFN expression include IRF3 and IRF7.40 IRF3, which is constitutively expressed in resting cells, is phosphorylated upon PRR signalling by the IB kinase (IKK)related kinases IKK and TBK1. NS1 from vaccinia virus associates with both IRF3 and its coactivator CBP, impeding their interaction and impairing promoter binding. elucidation of C6 activity could provide valuable insight into IFN production. IRF7 is phosphorylated by TBK1 and IKK, causing it to heterodimerize with IRF3 and stimulate full type I IFN expression. ebolavirus VP35 protein represents an interesting example of IRF7 inhibition. encephalitis virus exploits specific components of the DNAdamage response to cause proteasomal degradation of the hyperphosphorylated form of RPB1. this allows it to selectively silence elongating RNAP II complexes. this does not impede the virus itself, as RNAP II is not required for the transcription or replication of the la Crosse encephalitis virus genome. each stage of the JAK/STAT signalling pathway is disrupted by viral proteins. human metapneumovirus reduces Jak1 and Tyk2 mRNAs and proteins. each stage of the pathway is disrupted by viral proteins. adenovirus stabilizes tyrosinephosphorylated, activated STAT1 by obstructing its interaction with the protein tyrosine phosphatase TC45.81. adenovirus also impairs the dephosphorylation of STAT1 by obstructing its interaction with the protein tyrosine phosphatase TC45.81. the NS1 protein of influenza A strain H3N2 contains a short sequence that mimics the histone H3 tail. this permits histonemodifying enzymes to act on NS1; accordingly, NS1 is both acetylated and methylated in infected cells. PKR phosphorylates the eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor2 subunit (eIF2), disrupting protein synthesis. HCMV ORF94 blocks the expression and therefore the activity of OAS. adenoviruses have an unusual mechanism for impeding OAS. in some cases, viruses turn the tables completely, using particular ISGs to their own advantage. vIF2H stimulates the expression of a 56 000 molecular weight MxA isoform via alternative splicing in the absence of type I IFN production. interleukin6 upregulates SOCS3. amino acid substitutions in the core region of HCV produce interleukin6. each step in this process can be inhibited in some way by viral proteins."}
