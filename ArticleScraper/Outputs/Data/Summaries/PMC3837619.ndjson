{"summary": "multiple sclerosis (MS) is the major immune-mediated demyelinating human disease. it is characterized by varying amounts of demyelination, remyelination, inflammation, gliosis and axonal injury. in the majority of patients, the disease starts with a relapsing course (relapsing/remitting MS), followed by a progressive phase (secondary progressive MS) years later. phalomyelitis leads to the conclusion that wallerian-type primary axonal pathology due to neuronal death induces the first foci of inflammation and myelin breakdown in the spinal cord. a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction develops against the virus [13], which triggers a cascade of events in which pro-inflammatory cytokines released from virus-specific CD4+ T cells cause macrophage-induced demyelination. the aims of the present investigation were to perform an assumption-free microarray analysis of the transcriptional changes in the time course of Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis [26, 27]. unless otherwise stated, all experiments were performed with groups of six TMEV- and mock-infected mice killed at 14, 42, 98 and 196 days after infection. all living mice were repeatedly assayed at 0 dpi (pre-infection), 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 98, 147 and 196 dpi. a mean score per mouse was calculated from three trials per day. the applied antibodies were CD3 (polyclonal rabbit anti-human, diluted 1: 1000, Dako Diagnostika, Hamburg, Germany), CD45R/B220 (monoclonal rat antimouse biotinylated, clone RA3\u20136B2, diluted 1: 2000, BD Biosciences Pharmingen, Erembodegem, Belgium), IgG (H + L, polyclonal goat antimous a hybridization mixture containing 10 g of fragmented and labelled cRNA was hybridized to affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) the arrays were washed and stained with a solution containing R-phycoerythrin-streptavidin employing the Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) gene ontology data was assigned to differentially expressed probe sets. enriched pathways were selected from the biological process category of the gene ontology database at a false discovery rate of 1.0%[35, 36] random forest machine learning algorithm was employed to link the gene expression profiles of the spinal cords to the amount of demyelination. mice were trained at \u201314 dpi and at \u20137 dpi for 10 min. the rod speed was linearly increased from 5 RPM towards 55 RPM. a mean score per mouse was calculated from three trials per day. a mean score per mouse was calculated from all three locations. the applied antibodies

funiculi of the thoracic spinal cord. higher magnification from (A) displaying perivascular mononuclear infiltrates (arrowheads) and macrophages/microglia. a total of 1210 probe sets from the 45,101 probe sets of the mouse genome 430 2.0 array were identified to be differentially expressed over the study period at a false discovery rate of 1.0%. these differentially expressed probe sets belonged

BP+ area was significantly decreased at 196 dpi in TMEV-infected compared to mock-infected mice. the mean amount of each cell type or investigated protein was correlated to the respective gene expression using Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient. all investigated genes displayed a significant, moderate to high, positive correlation between the level of transcription and the amount of the corresponding antigen. oligonucleotide microarrays were used to identify the transcriptional changes in chronic progressive demyelinating Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis. the most prominent transcriptional changes in Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis are up-regulations in the chronic phase of the disease. a local antibody production seems to be the best explanation for the higher antibody titres in the CNS compared to serum in about one-third of mice 3 weeks after TMEV infection. the relative higher up-regulation of IgG2c compared to IgG1 in the present study could be an indirect hint towards a Th1-type response. multiple studies of MS and EAE show up-regulation of the FC receptors for IgG and IgE within chronic MS lesions. a dramatic reversal of the mean clinical score in the chronic phase of EAE in FCGR1\u2013/\u2013 mice compared to controls. the occurrence of a severe polioencephalitis in MHC class II deficient mice [59] is in agreement with the hypothesis formulated by Lassmann that a local immune reaction trapped behind a closed blood-brain barrier represents a key pathomechanism in progressive MS [6]. a local immune reaction trapped behind a closed blood-brain barrier represents a key pathomechanism in progressive MS [6]. the highest importance scores for cholesterol biosynthesis identified by leFE (DHCR7, FDPS, NSDHL) showed q-values above the 0.01 threshold employed in significance analysis. a microarray analysis of MS cases revealed down-regulations of multiple genes related to lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis and specific myelin proteins. another microarray study of progressive MS revealed a down-regulation of DHCR7 in the normal appearing white matter. inhibition of the HMG-CoA reductase resulted in lower clinical scores, diminished demyelination, reduced inflammation and increased amount of intralesional oligodendrocyte progenitor cells at 13 and 20 days after immunization. the different clinical and pathological outcome despite a down-regulated cholesterol biosynthesis in both studies is most likely the result of the different pathomechanisms. the present study showed an association between demyelination and multiple categories centred on an up-regulated TLR4 expression. in the normal human central nervous system TLR4 expression is restricted to microglia. in meninges, choroid plexus and circumventricular organs in the normal rat brain. however, after LPS stimulation TLR4 was also detected in rat microglial cells. the observed association of demyelination with differentially expressed genes related to neurite morphogenesis is in accordance with the hypothesis that early onset axonal injury may play an additional and possibly Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis-specific pathogenetic factor. the presence of anti-galactocerebroside antibodies bound to oligodendrocytes and myelin and immunoglobulins reacting with Fc-receptors on macrophages should be taken into consideration. the antigen detected by the employed monoclonal rat antimouse CD107b antibody is a lysosome-associated membrane protein also known as LAMP-2 or Mac-3. a down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis may inhibit fast and efficient remyelination in chronic demyelinating conditions like Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis and certain MS cases. a down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis may inhibit fast and efficient remyelination in chronic demyelinating conditions like theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis."}
