{"summary": "influenza pandemics may have dramatic consequences, as highlighted by 30\u201350 million deaths attributed to the influenza pandemic of the years 1918-1919. viral surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) facilitate FLUAV entry and release from target cells. HA facilitates viral attachment to cells by binding to sialic acids on cell surface proteins or lipids. batFLUAV-HAL, unlike FLUAV-HA, does not engage sialic acids for host cell entry [17, 22\u201324], and batFLUAV-NAL, unlike FLUAV-NA, does not engage sialic acids for host cell entry [17, 22\u201324] biochemical and structural studies imply that batFLUAV-HAL does not engage sialic acids for host cell entry [17, 22\u201324] the following cell lines were used as targets for transduction and expression experiments. they were maintained in modified Eagle's medium (PAA Laboratories) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrom) and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin, PAA Laboratories) all non-bat-derived cell lines were obtained from collaborators. the pCAGGS-based expression plasmid for NAL of batFLUAV, A/little yellow-shouldered bat/Guatemala/153/2009 (H17/N10) was provided by M. Schwemmle. the pCAGGS-based expression plasmid for the HA and NA of A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Singapore/1/57 were constructed by PCR. pCAGGS-based expression plasmids were used for the HA of a/South Carolina/1/18 (H1N1) and the NA of a/Brevig mission/1/1918 (H1N1). the expression plasmid for the glycoprotein (G) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, Indiana strain, VSV-G; GenBank: AJ318514.1) was generated by inserting the VSV-G ORF HEK-293T cells were transfected by calcium-phosphate precipitation with expression plasmids encoding viral surface proteins. the cells were inoculated with VSV*G-fLuc at a multiplicity of infection of 3 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. the cells received fresh culture medium and were further incubated for 16\u201320 h. cell culture supernatant was removed and cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) after 2 h of incubation, the cells were washed and then inoculated with pseudotypes. the cells were either directly inoculated with VSVpp or treated as specified above and then inoculated. measurement of fLuc activity was carried out in a microplate reader, Plate CHAMELEON (Hidex), using the MicroWin2000 software (version 4.44, Mikrotek Laborsysteme GmbH) and fLuc substrates from the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) or Beetle-Juice (PJK) kits. fLuc activity was displayed in counts per second (cps) or as normalized values. hek-293T cells were grown in 6-well plates with expression plasmids for batFLUAV-HAL and different TTSPs (TMPRSS2, DESC-1 or MSPL) or by incubation of HAL-expressing cells with trypsin. the 1918-HA served as positive control, since cleavage by TTSPs and trypsin has been previously shown. anti-VSV-G (I1, mouse hybridoma supernatant from CRL-2700, ATCC, 1:200) and anti-\u00df-actin (mouse, 1:10,000, Dianova) antibodies served as secondary antibodies. signal detection was carried out in a ChemoCam imager together with the ChemoStar professional software (both Intas) HEK-293T human (Homo sapiens) Kidney Huh7 human (Homo sapiens) Liver Vero African green monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops) Kidney RoNi/7 Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) Kidney HypNi/1.1 Hammer-headed fruit bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) Kidney EidNi/41 Straw-colored fruit bat pCAGGS-based expression plasmid for the HA of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, Indiana strain, VSV-G; GenBank: AJ318514.1) was generated by inserting the VSV-G ORF into the pCG1 expression vector. expression plasmids for fusion protein and glycoprotein (G, synthetic, GenBank: AF212302) were used. expression plasmids for TMPRSS2, TMPRSS11E (DESC-1) and TMPRSS13 (MSPL) were used in a previously described cell line. the cells were inoculated with VSV*G-fLuc at a multiplicity of infection of 3 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. for proteolytic activation of HA/HAL by trypsin, pseudotypes were incubated with bovine trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich; final concentration: 50 g/ml) for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. subsequently, trypsin was inactivated by addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich; final concentration: 50 g/ml) the cell culture supernatant was removed and the cells were again washed and incubated with fresh culture medium for 16\u201318 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. the cell culture supernatant was removed and the cells were again washed and incubated with fresh culture medium for 16\u201318 h at 37\u00b0C. anti-mouse (1:750, Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies were incubated with DAPI (Roth, 5 min/37\u00b0C) the cells were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with DAPI (Roth, 5 min/37\u00b0C) to stain the nuclei before the coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Mowiol (AppliChem) anti-FLAG (mouse, 1:1,000, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-FLUAV (goat, 1:1,000, Millipore), anti-VSV-M (mouse, 1:1,000, Kerafast), anti-\u00df-actin (mouse, 1:1,000, Dianova), anti-\u00df-actin (mouse, 1:1,000, Kerafast) and anti-\u00df-actin (mouse, 1:1,000, Dianova) antibodies similar numbers of HAL-expressing cells were detected by fluorescence microscopy. the intensity of fluorescence signals emitted by the cells was comparable. we pelleted pseudotype preparations through a sucrose cushion. we subjected samples to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. the blots indicate the molecular weight in kilo Daltons (kDa) the results were confirmed in an independent experiment. rhabdoviral vectors pseudotyped with these proteins mediate entry into a restricted set of target cells. vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G, NiV-F) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) none of the human, simian and canine cell lines was susceptible to entry driven by batFLUAV surface proteins. pseudotypes that harbored 1918- or H2N2-HA/NA required activation by exogenous trypsin for efficient transduction. a two-tailed, unpaired student\u2019s t-test was used to test statistical significance. pseudotypes harboring 1918-HA/NA or H2N2-HA/NA were only able to transduce some of the bat cell lines after incubation with trypsin. the proteins used to study HAL expression and virion incorporation were functional. expression of batFLUAV-NAL in pseudotype producing cells does not impact particle infectivity. expression of batFLUAV-NAL in pseudotype producing cells does not impact particle infectivity. the expression of NAL in pseudotype producer cells did not increase transduction efficiency of HAL-harboring pseudotypes. this suggests that NAL is not required for release and/or infectivity of HAL containing particles, at least in the experimental system chosen. sialidase treatment had no effect on pseudotype entry mediated by batFLUAV-HAL, NiV-F/G or VSV-G. results indicate that HAL does not use sialic acids for host cell entry. removal of sialic acids might even increase batFLUAV infectivity. on endosomal acidification Endosomal low pH triggers FLUAV-HA for membrane fusion. ammonium chloride treatment led to a decrease in transduction efficiency mediated by pseudotypes bearing the HA-proteins of FLUAV of the H1N1 and H2N2 subtype and VSV-G. TMPRSS2 activates batFLUAV-HAL cleavage by TTSPs. it requires activation by host cell proteases to be responsive to low pH. TMPRSS2 was previously shown to be essential for FLUAV-HA activation. pseudotypes bearing 1918-HA and -NA were included in this experiment. the pseudotypes were treated with trypsin to activate HA/HAL. infectivity of FLUAV-HA pseudotypes produced in the absence of TTSPs or not treated with trypsin was in the background range. hek-293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HA or HAL proteins. either trypsin treated or cotransfected with plasmids encoding type II transmembrane serine proteases. transfection of empty vector served as negative control. a single representative experiment carried out with quadruplicate samples is presented. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments with separate pseudotype preparations. a two-tailed, unpaired student\u2019s t-test was used to test statistical significance. cells transfected with an empty expression vector were visualized by DAPI staining. similar results were obtained in a separate experiment. batFLUAV can be activated by exogenous trypsin [39\u201341]. cleavage by host cell proteases to transit into active form [12]. no human, simian and canine cell lines were susceptible to entry. simian (Vero) and canine (MDCK) origin (A) or bat cell lines (RoNi/7, EidNi/41, HypNi/1.1, EpoNi/22.1, CpKd) were treated with trypsin (black bars) at 18\u201320 h post inoculation, the transduction efficiency was measured by quantification of the activity of the VSVpp-encoded luciferase. pseudotypes bearing HAL17/NAL10 or HAL18/NAL10 were both able to enter HypNi/1.1 and EpoNi/22.1 cells. EidNi/41 cells could only be transduced by pseudotypes bearing HAL18/NAL10. this suggests that batFLUAV of the HL17NL10 and HL18NL11 subtype might exhibit subtle differences in entry efficiency. Pseudotypes harboring only WSN-NA were not able to transduce target cells. pseudotypes bearing either WSN-HA alone or in combination with WSN-NA transduced both MDCK and EpoNi/22.1. transduction efficiency was 500\u20131,500-fold higher when WSN-NA was expressed. a two-tailed student\u2019s t-test was used to test statistical significance. a two-tailed, paired student\u2019s t-test was used to test statistical significance. the results indicate that HAL does not require sialic acids for host cell entry. transduction of sialidase-treated cells is shown relative to that measured for mock-treated cells (on a linear scale) similar results were obtained in two independent experiments carried out with separate pseudotype preparations. trypsin-treated vesicular stomatitis virus-based pseudotypes harboring the indicated viral glycoproteins. at 1 h post inoculation, the inoculum was removed and the cells were further incubated for 18\u201320 h in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride. transduction efficiency was normalized against the respective control (water) TMPRSS2, DESC-1 and MSPL, and trypsin treatment resulted in cleavage of the HAL precursor (HAL0) determined by the appearance of bands corresponding to the HAL2 subunit. TMPRSS2 cleavage was more pronounced than proteolysis by DESC-1 and MSPL. PRSS2 but not DESC-1 and MSPL conferred robust infectivity to HAL17-bearing pseudotypes. transfection of even the lowest amount of TMPRSS2 plasmid was sufficient to confer maximum infectivity of HAL18-bearing pseudotypes. proteases able to activate HA can also activate HAL. Pseudotypes were either directly used for transduction of EpoNi/22.1 cells. transduction efficiency was measured by quantification of the activity of VSVpp-encoded luciferase in cell lysates. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments carried out with separate pseudotype preparations. LUAV do not engage with canonical FLUAV receptors. until very recently no proof of functional activity of batFLUAV surface proteins was available. we used a vector system to analyze batFLUAV-HAL and -NAL. a cell line derived from Eidolon helvum spleen cells was found to be non-susceptible in contrast to our findings with a kidney cell line established from the same species. this suggests that entry is not a bottleneck for spread of batFLUAV between bat species. the FLUAV-HA is sufficient to mediate viral binding and entry into target cells. however, treatment of EpoNi/22.1 cells with sialidase did not decrease HAL-mediated pseudotype entry. these findings are in keeping with the work by maruyama et al. [64] and with structural data indicating that HAL does possess a distorted putative sialic acid binding site. TTSPs can cleave and activate HA in cell culture. polymorphisms in TMPRSS2 were shown to impact severity of influenza in humans. titration of amounts of TMPRSS2 had differential effects on proteolytic cleavage of HAL and rendered particles infectious in the absence of trypsin treatment. both studies show that HAL-driven entry requires prior proteolytic HAL-activation by trypsin and endosomal acidification. the present work extends these findings by demonstrating that HAL can utilize the human enzyme TMPRSS2 for its activation."}
