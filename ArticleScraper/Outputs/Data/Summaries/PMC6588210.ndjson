{"summary": "an autochthonous outbreak of dengue occurred in Tokyo, Japan. concerted efforts were made to control viral spread. mosquito control, public announcement of the outbreak, and a total ban on entering the park. despite sporadic abundance of Aedes aegypti, dengue is not endemic in the country. despite only sporadic abundance of Aedes albopictus, the species is widespread across. all western parts of Japan, theoretically allowing for chains of dengue transmission to exist [18\u201323]. 129 people had visited or worked near Yoyogi Park, a national park. a few local residents seemed to remain for extended periods in the park. the role of these individuals in amplifying transmission as primary cases has not been verified. a physician must confirm the diagnosis via virus isolation, PCR method, detection of nonstructural protein 1, elevated IgM antibodies against DENV, or plaque reduction neutralization testing. of the total 160 reported cases, four were excluded owing to the absence of information about illness onset. cases exposed to DENV for a certain number of days with a known date of illness onset (i.e., complete observation; Group 1, n = 79), cases without information of the date of exposure but with a known date of illness onset (i.e., missing observation of exposure; Group 3, n = 30). in this outbreak, the actual primary case, which must be an imported case, was not identified. interventions against adult and larva of Aedes albopictus started in Yoyogi park along with public dissemination of the outbreak as a news 4 September 2014 Ban on entrance to Yoyogi park. we decomposed the generation time of DENV infection into two parts, i.e., (i) the time from illness onset in an infected human to secondary transmission in another human via a mosquito. generation-dependent model modeled by convolution, g t = = 0 t f t - w. model does not explicitly account for the lifespan of the female Aedes species. time scope of the Tokyo epidemic in 2014 was from 9 August to 7 October 2014, consistent with the average lifespan. t + R 2 R 1 ( g * g * g * g * g * g ) t + R 3 R 2 R 1 ( g * g * g * g ) t + R 3 R 2 R 1 ( g * g * g * g ) t + R 3 R 2 R 1 ( t ) = 1 t T 1 1 T 1 t. u(t) = h ( t ) = 0 T h ( t ) = 0 T h ( t ) ( t ) = 0 T h ( ) ( ), (5) where T is the last date of the outbreak. u(t) is described on a daily basis; thus, ut represents the daily probability on day t. compared the Akaike information criterion values with a correction for small sample size (AICc) and mean squared error (MSE) we did not consider additional generations, because more generations unrealistically required shorter duration of the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) the likelihood function for case j in Group 2 is L j 2 ( n ; t e, t s, E j L, E j R, t j s, d 0 ) = = E j L E j R u z (, d 0 ) f t j s - (8) for case k in Group 3 the exposure can take place from time 0 to the onset of symptoms. j = 1 n 2 L j 2 k = 1 n 3 L k 3 i = 1 n 1 L i P. we used the method of maximum likelihood estimation to minimize the negative likelihood L(n; te, ts, EL, ER, d0). the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the effective reproduction number was computed with a parametric bootstrap method. in the present study, diagnosed cases of dengue virus fell into one of three groups. in group 1, the exact date of exposure was known. in group 2, exposure dates were interval censored, calling for interval-censored likelihood. individuals in group 2 visited Yoyogi Park on two or more consecutive days. the reported cases were categorized into Groups 1, 2, and 3 (S1 Fig). in this outbreak, the actual primary case, which must be an imported case, was not identified. we decomposed the generation time of DENV infection into two parts, i.e., the time from illness onset in an infected human to secondary transmission in another human via a mosquito. we assumed that both functions would be derived from the cumulative distribution functions of gamma distribution, G(s), i.e., fs = G(s; lP, lP)G(s1; lP, lP) for s>0. generation-dependent model was developed using gt. we assumed the epidemiological dynamics described by the generation-dependent model are what is expected in the absence of interventions. generation 1 produces R1 cases with the relative timing of infection following gt. 0 + R 2 R 1 R 0 + R 3 R 2 R 1 R 0, (2) where Rm-1 denotes the reproduction number of generation m. we have h ( t ) = g t + R 2 R 1 ( g * g ) t + R 3 R 2 R 1 ( g * g * g ) t + R 3 R 2 R 1 ( g * g * g ) t 1 + R 1 + R 3 R u(t) = h ( t ) = 0 T h ( t ) = 0 T h ( t ) = 0 T h ( t ) = 0 T h ( t ) = 0 T h ( t ) = 0 t u t - g. u(t) is described on a daily basis; therefore, ut represents the daily probability on day t. we compared models with and without 1 and 2, i.e., models in which (i) two effectiveness measures are jointly estimated (i.e., 11 and 21), (ii) only the park closure effect is estimated (1 = 1 and 21), (iii) only mosquito control and public awareness campaigns are factored in (11 and 2 = 1), and (iv) no effect of control measures are taken into account (1 = 1 and 2 = 1). case k in Group 3 can take place from time 0 to the onset of symptoms. cases in group 1 were used to estimate the incubation period. the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the effective reproduction number was computed with a parametric bootstrap method. the 100 sets of parametric bootstrap samples were generated from the multivariate normal distribution with the mean and covariance, the latter of which was obtained with diag(H-1(*) the most likely first date of exposure was in the range 26\u201328 July 2014, dating back 7\u20139 days from 4 August 2014. generation 2 was considered to be responsible for the highest peak at the end of august. only when generation 4 was assumed to have existed, generation 3 was considered responsible for a small peak on about 7 September 2014. the reproduction numbers in the absence of interventions were greater than the value of 1 by generation 2 (i.e., R1) for the three models, and by generation 3 (i.e., R2) if the assumed number of generations was 4, then the reproduction number of generation 3 (i.e., R2) was not estimated but must have been zero (owing to the absence of generation 3). generation, and four-generation models indicated that there were a total two, three, and four generations, excluding generation zero. Mean IP and standard deviation IP of the duration of the generation times, other than incubation period, were assumed as the parameters governing the gamma distribution. effective reproduction number in three models with a different number of generations. left vertical axis shows the observed number of cases. right vertical axis shows the effective reproduction number, illustrated using a black solid line. hypothetically examining counterfactual scenarios in which the relative reduction in the reproduction number during park closure, 2 (and mosquito control, measured by 1) is assumed at 1. the time at which the reproduction number declines would be delayed, indicating that the park closure has played an important role in reducing the transmissibility. mosquito control and raising public awareness were not sufficiently effective to break the chain of transmission, as they maintained Rt>1. the combined effect of mosquito control, public awareness campaigns, and park closure was needed for a substantial reduction in Rt. the combined effect of mosquito control, public awareness campaigns, and park closure was estimated to be 44%\u201388%. the model with two generations alone indicated that the outbreak came to an end with the latest estimate of a generation-dependent reproduction number (of generation 1) as large as 9.3; the reproduction number of the subsequent generation had to abruptly drop to 0. if this model result were true, the latest estimate of Ri was below the value of 1 because the epidemic came to an end in October 2014. transmission occurred in other parks in the Kanto region. we ignored environmental and ecological factors in our model. we ignored rainfall, which could have altered population dynamics of Aedes species. cases were classified into three groups: group 1, exact date of exposure was known; group 2, exposure dates were interval censored; and group 3, no information was available. light grey, white, and dark grey bars represent cases in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
