Stimulation of CLRs was previously shown to activate several proinflammatory transcription factors, including NF-B, NFAT, and AP-1. normalization of expression from individual promoters to total expression also highlights the differential transcriptional response to each agonist. NF-B-, AP-1-, and NFAT-dependent luciferase reporter gene expressions in RAW-NF-B-Luc, RAW-NFAT-Luc, and RAW-AP-1-Luc macrophages. curdlan and furfurman induced strongest expression of IL-1 (17.1-fold), KC (16.4-fold), MIP-1 (27.0-fold), MIP-1 (29.9-fold), TNF (16.7-fold), IL-12 p40 (4.4-fold), RANTES (4.0-fold), MCP-1 (3.9-fold), and MIP-3 (3.0-fold). curdlan and furfurman also induced to various extents the secretion of 16 cytokines and s were harvested on day 8 of culture, seeded in 24-well plates. expression of the maturation markers CD40, CD80, and CD86 was assessed by flow cytometry of 106 CD11c+ MHCII+ cells. data are mean fluorescence fold increase over PBS-treated cells. we quantified 26 cytokines and chemokines 48 h after stimulating splenic nave mononuclear cells with 10 g/mL TDB, curdlan, and furfurman. secretion of 10 cytokines and chemokines was enhanced relative to control cells. curdlan induced IFN (2.4-fold) more effectively than furfurman. 105 cells/well were stimulated for 48 h with 10 g/mL agonists. data are mean fold change relative to PBS-treated cells. error bars indicate standard deviations. urfurman, resp.) was used as negative control to measure nonspecific binding. the mean diameter and surface charge (Z-potential) of ovalbumin complexes were also evaluated. the mixtures were administered to mice in two subcutaneous injections two weeks apart. mincle, Dectin-1, and Dectin-2 agonists induce comparable antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response. blood was collected 14 days after the last injection from mice immunized as above and assayed for total Ig. total ovalbumin-specific IgG was significantly more abundant in mice injected with ovalbumin-CLR agonist mixtures than in mice immunized with soluble ovalbumin only. the humoral response was strongest and significantly higher in mice immunized with ovalbumin and TDB. ELISA determined whether Dectin-1, Dectin-2, and Mincle agonists induce effective mucosal immunity. bronchoalveolar and intestinal lavage fluids were collected 14 days after the last immunization from mice immunized. adjuvantation with Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 agonists, but not with Mincle agonist, robustly induces IgA production in intestinal mucosa. mice were immunized twice by subcutaneous injection of ovalbumin alone or in combination with TDB, curdlan, and furfurman. serum IgG and intestinal IgA were measured two weeks after the second injection in mice immunized by the same prime-boost immunization as described. all squalene-based formulations induced IgG responses that were 2\u20134 log2 higher than antigen mixtures without carrier. mice were immunized twice by subcutaneous injection. serum IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3 were quantified by ELISA 14 days after second immunization. NF-B-, AP-1-, and NFAT-dependent luciferase reporter gene expressions in RAW-NF-B-Luc, RAW-NFAT-Luc, and RAW-AP-1-Luc macrophages were treated for 8 h with the indicated doses (g/mL) of mincle, Dectin-1, and Dectin-2 agonists. in-2 Differentially Activates Bone Marrow-Derived Dendritic Cells Based on the observed differences in activity levels of NF-B, AP-1, and NFAT transcription factors. we quantified maturation markers in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells exposed for 24 h to 10 g/mL TDB, curdlan, and furfurman. agonists also induced to various extents the secretion of 16 cytokines and -2 (8.7-fold) was most effectively stimulated by furfurman. only curdlan and furfurman stimulated TGF-1 expression (2.0-fold) but to a comparable extent. we quantified 26 cytokines and chemokines 48 h after stimulating splenic nave mononuclear cells with 10 g/mL TDB, curdlan, and furfurman. cytokines and chemokines secreted by lymphocytes are linked to adaptive immunity. splenic mononuclear cells were isolated from C57/Bl6 mice. they were stimulated for 48 h with 10 g/mL mincle, Dectin-1, and Dectin-2 agonists. data are mean fold change relative to PBS-treated cells. we detected strong interaction between ovalbumin and CLR agonist molecules. the mean diameter and surface charge of ovalbumin-agonist complexes were also evaluated. the mixtures were administered to mice in two subcutaneous injections two weeks apart. cells from mice immunized with ovalbumin and curdlan contained 0.5% more CD4+ cells and 0.7% more CD8+ T cells. cells from mice immunized with ovalbumin and furfurman produced 0.5% additional CD4+ cells and 0.4% additional CD8+ T cells. blood was collected 14 days after the last injection from mice immunized as above. total ovalbumin-specific IgG was significantly more abundant in mice injected with ovalbumin-CLR agonist mixtures than in mice immunized with soluble ovalbumin only. tab Mincle, Dectin-1, and Dectin-2 agonists induce antigen-specific IgG in mice. mice were immunized twice by subcutaneous of ovalbumin alone or in combination with TDB, curdlan, or furfurman. parenteral administration of ovalbumin adjuvanted with CLR agonists did not significantly induce bronchoalveolar IgA. Interestingly, adjuvantation with Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 agonists, but not with Mincle agonist, robustly induces production of antigen-specific IgA in the small intestine. squalene-based formulations induced IgG responses that were 2\u20134 log2 higher than antigen mixtures without carrier. squalene-based formulations with TDB, curdlan, and furfurman resulted in significantly higher total IgG than ovalbumin alone. elucidating molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive local mucosal immunity is essential to develop more effective parenteral vaccines. a vaccine should ideally enable to induce mucosal immunity to provide host defense at the point of entry of the infectious agent. pattern recognition receptors that strongly regulate innate and adaptive immunity have provided new opportunities to create novel and effective adjuvants based on their agonists. the ability to induce local mucosal immune reactions when delivered parenterally was characterized in only a small number of such adjuvants. we have now investigated the impact of stimulating these CLRs on innate as well as adaptive immunity, including both local mucosal and systemic reactions. the agonists activated dendritic cells, another key event in adaptive immunity. we also found that CLR agonists induced production of Th17 cytokines from dendritic and mononuclear cells. curdlan and furfurman did not stimulate IgA secretion in the lung mucosa following subcutaneous immunization. however, curdlan and furfurman did not stimulate IgA secretion in the lung mucosa following subcutaneous immunization. these data indicate that immunization strategy also impacts mucosal immune reactions. we propose that inclusion of Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 agonists in vaccine composition may significantly enhance formation of mucosal IgA immune response independently from carrier nature in vaccine composition. the results suggest that new adjuvants based on Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 agonists may significantly enhance mucosal immune reactions to newly designed or already prepared parenteral vaccines. stimulation of Dectin-1 and Dectin-2, but not Mincle, along with ovalbumin antigen, induces robust formulation-independent secretion of IgA in intestinal mucosa. authors declare there is no conflict of interest regarding publication of this article. mincle stimulation activated AP-1 (40% and 46% of total luciferase expression) stimulation of Dectin-1 and Dectin-2 weakly induced NF-B-dependent expression (24% for both agonists). click here for additional data file. each sector of the pie chart represents NF-B-, AP-1-, or NFAT-dependent luciferase reporter gene expression normalized to total luciferase expression. each sector of the pie chart represents NF-B-, AP-1-, or NFAT-dependent luciferase reporter gene expression normalized to total luciferase expression. the molecular weights of TDB (987.43 Da), curdlan (1013.38 Da) and furfurman (786.65 Da) were measured on an ultrafleXtreme MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer."}
