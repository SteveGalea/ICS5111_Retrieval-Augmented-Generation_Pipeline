{"summary": "pandemic influenza H1N1 from a swine origin in 2009. sporadic zoonotic cases of swine origin influenza viruses in 2011-2012. avian influenza A virus subtypes, including H5N1, H7N7, H9N2, and neuraminidase, were all experienced to infect humans during the past years. influenza A virus is one of the most active pathogens in Taiwan causing regular, yearly islandwide epidemics. influenza subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 are currently the major circulating subtypes and have been infecting the human population for decades. influenza outbreaks have a public health priority after the SARS outbreaks in Taiwan. 62.7% of influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and 37.3% of influenza B viruses from Taiwanese isolates analyzed using postinfection ferret antisera during the past decade. the surveillance is performed by sentinel primary care physicians and is based on integrated clinical and virological surveillance components. all suspected influenza complicated cases need to be reported and specimens must be collected and sent to Taiwan CDC through NNDSS. the diagnosis of influenza infection was confirmed by viral culture, immunofluorescence antibody stain, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or a commercially available rapid diagnostic test. the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network was established in 1952. it comprises 5 WHO collaborating centers (WHO CCs) on influenza and 112 institutions in 83 countries. Taiwan NIC has not been recognized as a member of the WHO's network of influenza centers. the development of molecular methods for the direct identification of specific viral genome from clinical sample is one of the greatest achievements during this period. the advance and current phase of the center for research, diagnostics and Vaccine Development of Taiwan CDC is to measure the expression levels of large numbers of genes simultaneously or to genotype multiple regions of a genome. each probe tests for a specific sequence of DNA and small groups of probes can be used to check for specific viruses up to the species level. new technologies have been continuously added in the field of biomedical sciences, which has gradually improved science and enormously improved the quality and quantity of research output. pdmH1N1 influenza virus infection in Taiwan is defined as an individual with laboratory-confirmed pdmH1N1 influenza virus infection by one or more of the following tests. commercially available rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) detect influenza viral nucleoprotein antigen and are capable of providing results within 30 minutes. oseltamivir-resistant pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus strain in Taiwan was first isolated from a 20-year-old male in October 2009. the virus isolated before the patient received oseltamivir treatment was sensitive to oseltamivir. oseltamivir treatment was not associated with statistically significant reduction in the duration of viral shedding. a total of 450 cases with 165 deaths have been reported, and infections in both humans and birds have been observed. most of the human cases with H7N9 infection have reported recent exposure to live poultry or potentially contaminated environments. the virus does not appear to be transmitted easily from person to person, and sustained human-to-human transmission has not been reported. the first human-infected case of H6N1 avian influenza in the world was reported from Taiwan. this novel avian-origin influenza A (H6N1) virus was confirmed by the National Influenza Center, Centers for Disease Control, Taiwan. the patient was sick with pneumonia and has already recovered. in 2013, only the H1 and H3 subtypes of influenza A viruses have been detected in humans in Taiwan. the virus is a low-pathogenicity virus that circulates in domestic birds. the virus isolated from the patient's respiratory sample closely resembles the virus in poultry. the source of H7N9 virus infection in patients with confirmed cases cannot be verified. most of the scientists suspect it is likely to be infected poultry. the virus can be transmitted between people, but both animal-to-human and human routes of transmission are being investigated."}
