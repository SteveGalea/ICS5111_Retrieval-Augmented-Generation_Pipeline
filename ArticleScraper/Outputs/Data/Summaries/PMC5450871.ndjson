{"summary": "HBoV viremia/DNAemia has been associated closely with acute primary infection and moderate-to-severe illness. HBoV was detected in our patients nose and throat swabs concurrent with whole blood sample by positive polymerase chain reactions. ase level 4113 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase level 7055 U/L, total biluribin 0.8 mg/dL, direct biluribin 0.6 mg/dL, activated partial thromboplastin time 31.6 seconds, prothrombin time 24.9 seconds, international correction rate 2.38, albumin 25 g/L. laboratory and clinical findings were consistent with hepatitis and bronchiolitis. fluenza virus 1-4 and Rhinovirus were searched for the diagnostic panel. HBoV viral load was detected 8x106 copies per ml serum in blood samples concurrent with the NPA. the patient\u2019s respiratory status was improved over three days to normal. oV infection usually occurs with viremia and high viral loads. the high viral load in the blood sample of our patient can be considered as evidence of acute HBoV disease. there is limited data about the link between HBoV and hepatitis."}
