{"summary": "cohort study of 118 patients with severe COPD and acute infectious exacerbations included. episodes of exacerbations meeting anthonisen\u2019s criteria type I\u2013II were evaluated. full microbiological analysis was available in 265 samples. exacerbations become more frequent and more severe as the severity of COPD increases. an infectious etiology is by far the most frequent, with figures up to 78% for hospital-admitted COPD patients. et al demonstrated a higher level of CRP in exacerbations due to viruses. studies have not demonstrated its value for the identification of episodes severe enough to require admission. in severe COPD outpatients, studies of CRP are scarce. smoking history, severity of the disease, body-mass, airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea, and exercise index,16 comorbidities,17 and use of long-term home oxygen therapy were recorded. participants from the severe COPD Cohort underwent the same scheduled clinical controls performed by the same team of pulmonologists at the respiratory daycare unit. exacerbations were considered severe in the presence of criteria for hospital admission. sputum samples were cultured for potentially pathogenic microorganisms. cultures were considered positive when PPMs were recovered. DNA/RNA was extracted from 200 L of respiratory clinical samples previously liquefied with Sputasol\u00ae (Oxoid Limited, Basingstoke, UK) in a 37\u00b0C water bath for 20 minutes. a multiplex retrotranscriptase-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was used. a computed tomography scan was obtained to identify undiagnosed bronchiectasis. participants from the severe COPD Cohort underwent the same scheduled clinical controls performed by the same team of pulmonologists. blood analyses, including blood counts, renal function, electrolytes, CRP levels, and arterial gases, were performed in all exacerbations. exacerbations were considered severe in the presence of criteria for hospital admission. a spontaneous sputum sample was obtained before the administration of antibiotics. sputum was extracted from 200 L of respiratory clinical samples previously liquefied with Sputasol\u00ae (Oxoid Limited, Basingstoke, UK) in a 37\u00b0C water bath for 20 minutes. DNA/RNA was extracted using a multiplex retrotranscriptase-nested polymerase chain reaction assay. study population was predominantly male, with a mean (SD) age of 69 (8) years. over half of cases were classified as GOLD IV. a single exacerbation was reported in 44 patients, whereas 24 presented two. data are presented as mean SD or n (%), unless otherwise stated. hypercapnia defined as PaCO2 >5.9 Kpa. pathogenic bacteria were cultivated from 167 (63%) of episodes. seasonal virus distribution showed a higher prevalence of virus infections during fall and winter. RVs were present at all times of year, while parainfluenza, influenza, and RSV were predominately isolated in fall or winter. clinical characteristics and inflammatory biomarkers by microorganism (N=265)* HI, n=66 SP, n=28 MC, n=28 PS, n=28 Other, n=17 Negative, n=53 Only virus, n=45 P-value$ Fever (%)+ 40 56 36 11.5 33.3 41.7 34.9 0.061 UAS (%)# 26.2 17.9 28.6 5.6 6.0 18.4 25.6 0.315 WBC significant differences in CRP levels were found between community-attended episodes (37.3 mg/L, IQR 12.8\u201382.7) and hospitalized episodes (67.4 mg/L, IQR 27.0\u2013189.0) the increase in CRP was significantly associated with increases in RR and leukocytes, and a fall in SaO2. variables and comorbidities, both basal hypercapnia and CRP remained in the model, with a fourfold risk of hospital admission when the CRP level was >100 mg/L. table 4 shows a fourfold risk of hospital admission when the CRP level was >100 mg/L. a total of 386 sputum samples were obtained during exacerbations meeting 2 Anthonisen criteria in the follow-up period. a single exacerbation was reported in 44 patients, while 24 presented two. 6 episodes were excluded from further analysis due to corticosteroid treatment. 153 episodes (40%) were considered severe and required hospital admission. 118 patients with severe COPD and acute infectious exacerbations. pathogenic bacteria were cultivated from 167 (63%) of the episodes. pathogenic bacteria were cultivated from 96 samples (36%), viruses were detected. RV was the most common (56) followed by parainfluenzae (17), influenza virus (9), coronavirus (7), RV (5), and adenovirus (2). in episodes only positive for viruses (37.3 mg/L, IQR 18.6\u201379.1) and cases negative for any microorganism (36.4 mg/L, IQR 10.8\u201393.7) (P0.014) in bacterial infections, CRP reached the highest levels in exacerbations due to S. pneumoniae (74.1, IQR 42.0\u2013220.7) and H. influenza (74.5, IQR 23.9\u2013167.9) in comparison with episodes related to P. aerugi 0.039 CRP (mg/L), median (IQR) 74.50 (23.90\u2013167.90) 74.10 (42.0\u2013220.7) 38.10 (20.60\u201395.40) 45.20 (11.10\u201370.10) 51.90 (23.60\u2013166.0) 36.40 (10.80\u201393.70) 37.30 (18.60\u201379.10) 0.026 Hospital admission (%) 47 60.7 21.4 57 41.1 22.6 37.8 significant differences in CRP levels were found between community-attended episodes (37.3 mg/L, IQR 12.8\u201382.7) and hospitalized episodes (67.4 mg/L, IQR 27.0\u2013189.0) other markers of exacerbation severity such as RR, SaO2, PaO2 and PaCO2 were also associated with the need for hospital admission. 7.2\u20137.6) 0.002 PaCO2+ 4.6\u20135.9 KPa 5.7 (5.2\u20136.6) 6.2 (5.4\u20137.5) 0.001 pH+ 7.35\u20137.45 7.42 (7.40\u20137.44) 7.41 (7.39\u20137.44) 0.443 Note: CRP data is presented as median (interquartile range) the prevalence of infection in severe COPD outpatients in our study was 80%, with figures >60% for bacteria and 40% for viruses, one-half as coinfections with pathogenic bacteria. the prevalence of infection in severe COPD outpatients in our study was 80%, with figures >60% for bacteria and 40% for viruses, one-half of them as coinfections with pathogenic bacteria. bronchial infections due to H. influenzae have a clear systemic effect in severe COPD patients. this finding is clinically significant, because H. influenzae is the most prevalent cause of exacerbation in these patients. previous studies have focused on severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization. study suggests similarities with pneumonia in relation to significance of CRP. similar values of CRP have been reported in COPD exacerbations for selecting patients requiring ICU admission. infections with uncommon respiratory viruses such as metapneumovirus and bocavirus were not evaluated in our study. the true prevalence of virus infection may therefore be slightly underestimated."}
