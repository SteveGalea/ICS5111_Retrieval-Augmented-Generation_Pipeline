{"summary": "metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) assay for pulmonary microbes demonstrates significant inoculation of lower airways of immunocompromised children with diverse bacteria, fungi, and viruses. potential pathogens can be identified based on absolute and relative abundance. HODS Development of Optimized mNGS Assay We created mock-positive bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) by spiking Aspergillus niger broth into aliquots of BAL containing known Haemophilus influenzae/Human Adenovirus B coinfection (Supplementary Material 1). RNA and DNA sequencing libraries were prepared in parallel (New England Biolabs NEBNext Ultra-II Library Prep) reads underwent iterative removal of host (Hg38/PanTro), low-quality, low-complexity (Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Welch [LZW] compression ratio >0.45) we defined microbial outliers as those with Z-score 2 and 10 rpm (bacteria) or 1 rpm (viruses/fungi) the Simpson diversity index was used to associate the loss of bacterial diversity with the presence of outlier microbes (Supplementary Material 6) lysis buffer, or 200 L DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo), followed by mechanical homogenization with either 0.1 mm or 0.5 mm glass bashing beads (Omni) for 2, 5, or 8 cycles of 25 seconds, bashing at 30 Hz with 60 seconds rest on ice between each cycle. all samples underwent 10 minutes of centrifugation at 4\u00b0C, and the supernatant was used for parallel DNA/RNA extraction. the remaining sequences were aligned to the national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) nonredundant nucleotide database using GSNAPL for assignment of taxonomic IDs [22]. microbes were described as potentially pathogenic or typically nonpathogenic based on a priori literature review. immunocompromised patients aged 25 years undergoing clinically indicated lower respiratory sampling between September 2014 and April 2016. excess volume was separated, placed on dry ice within 10 minutes of the original procedure and banked at 70\u00b0C until processing. the optimized assay was able to detect as few as 0.42 Aspergillus niger colony-forming units (CFU; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12\u20131.40) at the lower limit of detection of RNA sequencing, the optimized assay was able to detect as few as 6.13 A. niger CFU (95% CI, 4.16\u20139.04; paired T test P.001) Characteristics of Enrolled Patients Demographics (n = 34 patients) Descriptor Age (median years, IQR)a 11.2 (IQR, 4.3\u201316.2) Sex Female 16 (47%) Male 18 (53%) Race White 26 (76%) Black 1 (3%) Asian 1 (3%) Asian 1 (3%) Asian 1 (3%) Asian 1 (3%) Not Hispanic/Latino 9 (26%) Other 1 (3%) Unknown 4 (12%) Ethnicity Hispanic/Latin deficiency (3/17), severe aplastic anemia (2/17), osteopetrosis (1/17). cHospital death n = 10/34 (29%). 81.7% of bacterial genera were identified at 10 rpm and within 2 standard deviations of the cohort mean (Z-score 2; Figure 2A). the value of log10-transformed reads for undetected microbes was assumed to equal \u20132 just below the lower limit of detection for our sequencing depth. 92.1% of fungal genera were quantified below 1 rpm. only 3.4% of fungal genera met outlier criteria. aspergillus RNA levels were detectable in 14/41 patient samples. only 1 was positive for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis by both culture and galactomannan assay. no cases of clinically suspected herpesvirus pneumonitis, Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, HHV-6, and HHV-7 were identified in low abundance in 9/41 samples. papillomaviruses, WU and KI Polyomaviruses, and Torquetenoviruses were also identified in 21/41 samples. n = 11 had concordant pathogens of outlier quantities on mNGS. n = 3 had concordant pathogens identified on mNGS but not in outlier quantities. n = 24 patients had samples without a pathogen detected clinically. mNGS amplicon DNA sequencing failed to identify C. glabrata in sample 37. mNGS has significantly greater sensitivity for detecting potential pulmonary pathogens than current clinical diagnostics (McNemar\u2019s P.001). the optimization did not change the detection of H. influenzae or Human Adenovirus B. at the lower limit of detection (LLOD of RNAseq), the optimized assay was able to detect as few as 0.42 Aspergillus niger colony-forming units. at the LLOD of DNAseq, the optimized assay was able to detect as few as 6.13 A. niger CFU (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12\u20131.40) negative controls demonstrated minimal environmental contamination (1 rpm of pathogenic bacteria and no pathogenic fungi or viruses Supplementary Table 3). Table 1. Characteristics of Enrolled Patients Demographics (n = 34 patients) Descriptor Age (median years, IQR)a 11.2 (IQR, 4.3\u201316.2) Sex Female 16 (47%) Male 18 (53%) Race White 26 (76%) Black 1 (3%) Asian 1 (3%) Asian 1 (3%) Asian 1 (3%) Asian 1 (3%) Asian 1 (3 bIndications for allogeneic HCT were acute leukemia (12/20), primary immunodeficiency (3/17), severe aplastic anemia (2/17), and osteopetrosis (1/17). cHospital death n = 10/34 (29%). 81.7% of bacterial genera were identified at 10 rpm. red dots represent potentially pathogenic microbes that are both abundant (10 rpm for bacteria or 1 rpm for fungi or viruses) and identified at levels greater than most other samples in the cohort. blue dots represent all other potentially pathogenic microbes; light blue dots represent typically nonpathogenic microbes. only 3.4% of fungal genera met outlier criteria. aspergillus RNA levels were detectable in 14/41 patient samples. only 1 was positive for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) 2 patients had viral coinfections (Parainfluenza-3 and Influenza-C; Adenovirus-C and Rhinovirus-A) no cases of clinically suspected herpesvirus pneumonitis, Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, HHV-6, and HHV-7 were identified in low abundance in 9/41 samples. clinical laboratory results were determined by review of medical charts. n = 17 patients had samples with a pathogen detected clinically. n = 3 had concordant pathogens identified on mNGS but not in outlier quantities. mNGS assays were performed on aliquots of the original unprocessed sample. all validation tests were concordant with mNGS with 1 exception. mNGS has significantly greater sensitivity for detecting potential pulmonary pathogens. mNGS assays have targeted amplicons within the 16S or 28S rRNA subunits, allowing detection of pulmonary bacteria or fungi, but not both, and not viruses. RNA sequencing is >10 times more sensitive for the detection of such fastidious organisms. pan-fungal and aspergillus-specific PCR have demonstrated 76%\u201379% sensitivity and 93%\u201395% specificity for probable/proven IPA [14, 40\u201347] pan-fungal and aspergillus-specific PCR have demonstrated 76%\u201379% sensitivity and 93%\u201395% specificity for probable/proven IPA [14, 40\u201347] most newly detected cultivable organisms were isolated from patients who had been pretreated with antimicrobials. one quarter of samples were concordantly negative for pathogens on clinical and mNGS testing. mNGS may demonstrate utility in safely excluding infections. the identification of microbial nucleic acid does not directly confirm the presence of viable, live organisms; does not directly implicate that microbe as a contributor to pulmonary disease. future studies are needed to determine whether prospective use of mNGS in a clinically relevant time frame might affect patient management and improve outcomes. endix Click here for additional data file.
