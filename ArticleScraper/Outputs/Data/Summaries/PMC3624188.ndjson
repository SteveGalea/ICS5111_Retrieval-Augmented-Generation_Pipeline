{"summary": "a system biological approach was used to examine the consequences of antagonizing karyopherin-dependent nuclear importation during SARS-CoV infection. the consequences of viral antagonism on host nuclear import and mRNA expression have not been carefully evaluated using genomic-based strategies. ORF6 protein binds specifically to karyopherin 2, trapping the import factor on intracellular membranes. karyopherin 1 is essential for all nuclear import by karyopherin proteins. depletion of this factor may dramatically reduce or alter transport of other cargo by karyopherin-based transport mechanisms (21) peak titers for both viruses were detected at 36 h postinfection. no significant differences in viral titers were detected at any time point. the ORF6 protein was detected exclusively in the icSARS-CoV-infected samples and increased in expression through 54 h postinfection. a cluster of genes are uniquely upregulated during infection with a mutant strain that does not express ORF6 protein. raw proteomics data can be accessed at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) Biological Mass Spectrometry (MS) data and software distribution center. all data sets and associated metadata have been submitted to the Virus Pathogen Resource. Calu3 2B4 cells were grown in minimal essential media (MEM; Invitrogen-Gibco) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic mixture (Invitrogen-Gibco) tracheobronchial epithelial cells were obtained from airway specimens resected from patients undergoing surgery under university of North Carolina Institutional Review Board-approved protocols. the media from transfected cells were harvested and served as seed stocks for subsequent experiments. real-time PCR quantification of viral genomic and subgenomic RNA species were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) cDNA synthesis was performed using 500 ng of total RNA and ThermoScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) the inoculum was removed, cells were washed 3 times with 1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then fresh medium was added prior to time zero. medium was collected to determine viral titers at each time point for each well. cells were either washed in 1 PBS and then harvested in TRIzol (Invitrogen) and stored at 80\u00b0C (for RNA) differential expression was determined by comparing icSARS-CoV- and icSARS-CoV ORF6-infected replicates to mock-infected replicates for each time point. criteria were an absolute log2-fold change of 1.5 and a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P value of 0.05 for a given time point. functional enrichment statistics and network analysis were determined using DAVID (40, 41) and Metacore (GeneGo, St. Joseph, MI) to identify the most significant processes affected by infection. the statistical Interactome tool was used to measure interconnectedness of genes in the experimental data set relative to all known interactions. LC-MS analyses were performed on all icSARS-CoV-, icSARS-CoV ORF6-, and mock-infected samples to generate quantitative data. the LC system was interfaced to an Exactive mass spectrometer (ThermoScientific) the temperature of the heated capillary and the electrospray ionization voltage were 250\u00b0C and 2.2 kV. c57BL/6J mice were infected with icSARS-CoV or icSARS-CoV ORF6. samples were then immunoprecipitated with anti-CREB antibody (clone aa5-24; Millipore), anti-VDR antibody (clone ab3508; Abcam), or an anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Laboratory) female mice were anesthetized with a ketamine (1.3 mg/mouse)\u2013xylazine mixture. each mouse was intranasally inoculated with 105 PFU wild-type icSARS-CoV mouse-adapted virus or icSARS-CoV ORF6 mouse-adapted backbone diluted in PBS. proteomics data corresponding to peptide identifications used to populate the AMT tag database are available at the PRoteomics IDEntification database. the raw quantitative proteomics data can be accessed at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) Biological Mass Spectrometry (MS) data and associated metadata have been submitted to the Virus Pathogen Resource. human tracheobronchial epithelial cells were obtained from airway specimens resected from patients undergoing surgery. primary cells were expanded to generate passage 1 cells, and passage 2 cells were plated at a density of 2.5 105 cells per well on permeable Transwell-COL (12-mm-diameter) supports. wild-type infectious clone-derived SARS-CoV (icSARS-CoV) and icSARS-CoV ORF6 the qPCR assay was performed using a SYBR green kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) with specific primers for the different RNA species. icSARS-CoV and icSARS-CoV ORF6 infection of Calu3 2B4 cells. infection of primary HAE cell cultures with icSARS-CoV and icSARS-CoV ORF6 was performed as previously described by our group. cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h; the inoculum was removed. unbound viruses were removed by washing three times with 1 PBS. significant transcript values were transformed for clustering and network analysis to the fold change (log2) of icSARS-CoV- or icSARS-CoV ORF6-infected samples compared to time-matched mock-infected samples. each membrane was washed twice with 500 l of 4 M guanidinium thiocynate, 25 mM sodium citrate, 0.5% Sarkosyl, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol. network visualizations were created in MetaCore or Cytoscape (43) network visualizations were created using an algorithm that identified the shortest path to directly connect nodes to transcription factors. quantitative LC-MS data sets were processed using the PRISM data analysis system (48), which is a series of software tools developed in-house. the peak intensity values for the final peptide identifications were processed in a series of steps using MatLab R2010b, including quality control (51, 52), normalization (53), and quantification to protein level (54). mice were anesthetized with a ketamine (1.3 mg/mouse)\u2013xylazine mixture. each mouse was intranasally inoculated with 105 PFU wild-type icSARS-CoV mouse-adapted virus or icSARS-CoV ORF6 mouse-adapted backbone diluted in PBS. 5 animals from each infection group were euthanized and the lungs were removed to determine viral titers. the large, lower lobe of the right lung was homogenized in 1 ml of sterile PBS with glass beads. all mice were housed using individually ventilated Sealsafe cages and the SlimLine system. no significant difference in titer between icSARS-CoV and icSARS-CoV ORF6 was detected at any time postinfection. at the high MOI, icSARS-CoV and icSARS-CoV ORF6 genome and subgenomic RNA transcript levels were detected by 6 h postinfection. in wild-type- but not icSARS-CoV ORF6-infected cells, ORF6 protein expression was detected after a total of 6,947 genes were differentially expressed in icSARS-CoV ORF6 and icSARS-CoV samples. most genes were more highly up- or downregulated in icSARS-CoV-infected cells compared to the mock-infected samples. this response differential was also apparent when we compared the total number of differentially expressed genes over time. heat map represents unsupervised hierarchical clustering of 6,947 differentially expressed genes (P 0.05; 2-fold change) between icSARS-CoV and icSARS-CoV ORF6 infection of Calu3 2B4 cells. values are fold change (log2) compared to time-matched mock infection or icSARS-CoV infection as indicated. icSARS-CoV had more differentially expressed genes early in the time course. some of the most highly differentially expressed genes between the viruses were detected as early as 24 h postinfection. this early response period included genes enriched for interferon signaling and innate immune response pathways. icSARS-CoV ORF6 differential gene expression was reduced to six clusters by K-means based on common patterns of expression across genes. processes related to transcription, nuclear signaling, cell proliferation and death were upregulated in icSARS-CoV ORF6 compared to icSARS-CoV (clusters C4, C5, and C6) gene cluster C4 identified as being being regulated by karyopherins in MetaCore. a significant number of downstream target genes were overconnected to downstream gene expression networks. this indicates that these transcription factors are important regulators of the host response by the ORF6 protein. over 350 gene nodes directly interact with these transcription factors. icSARS-CoV ORF6-infected cells are significantly upregulated (7- to 22-fold increase over mock) compared to steady levels in the icSARS-CoV-infected cells. two transcription factors (beta-catenin and androgen receptor) that do not require karyopherin to translocate to the nucleus are shown in Fig. 4B. the transcription factor is overrepresented in the data set, based on the connectivity ratio (actual/expected), calculated as the ratio of the actual number of connections to genes in the C4 cluster. Bold highlighted transcription factors are significantly (P 0.05) overrepresented in the data set. values are the average fold change (log2) the standard error compared to time-matched mock infection for 0 to 72 h postinfection. significant differences in gene expression between icSARS-CoV and icSARS-ORF6 at each time point were calculated by a two-way analysis. in icSARS-ORF6-infected cells, our data suggest that one of the functions of the ORF6 protein is to mediate complex hierarchical antagonism phenotypes of the nuclear import machinery. our data suggest that one of the functions of the ORF6 protein is to mediate complex hierarchical antagonism phenotypes. 1.48 2.84E07 6.88E09* Irf1 102 63.52 1.61 9.09E08 1.06E08* GCR- 199 150.60 1.32 4.94E06 1.73E08* C-fos 155 109.60 1.41 8.49E07 5.32E08* STAT1 164 128.50 1.28 2.29E04 9.82E08** Stat5a 62 36.70 1.69 4.37E06 6.31E07* Nf transcriptomics data set used as background. values for differentially expressed genes and proteins in SARS-CoV versus SARS-ORF6 Calu3 2B4 transcriptomics and proteomics data sets combined. replication titers for icSARS-CoV ORF6 increased over the entire 72-h time course. at a slightly reduced MOI, icSARS-CoV ORF6 demonstrated slower growth kinetics until later in infection in primary cells. enriched transcription factor hubs in HAE cultures, CREB1 and VDR, were also identified as important in the targeted Calu3 2B4 gene microarray data set. 4 microarray data sets are graphed in Fig. 5C for comparison. the genes B cell translocation gene 2 (Btg2), forkhead box 03a (Foxo3a), hypermethylated in cancer 2 (Hic2), human p-thromboglobulin gene (Ptg), thiamine transporter gene (Scl19a2), glucose transporter gene (Scl2a6), transforming growth factor 3 (TGF3) and POK family a total of 864 proteins were significantly differentially expressed between icSARS-CoV and icSARS-CoV ORF6-infected Calu3 2B4 cells across all time points. a total of 864 proteins were significantly (P 0.05) differentially expressed between icSARS-CoV- and icSARS-CoV ORF6-infected Calu3 2B4 cells across all time points. karyopherin-mediated transcriptional hubs are further enriched (i.e., more significant) with the addition of the proteomic data. the enrichment scores (P values) represent how connected the transcription factors are to downstream targets (genes or proteins) in the data set compared to the number of targets expected by chance. mic analysis were >1,000-fold more significant than for the transcriptomics alone. expression levels of individual downstream targets were confirmed between Calu3 2B4 transcriptional and proteomics analyses. mRNA-decapping enzyme 3 (EDC3) and golgi apparatus adapter-related complex of proteins mu 1 subunit (AP3M1) were measured at both the transcript and protein levels. gene-specific primer pairs were used to amplify DNA regions of interest by real-time PCR. the results were compared to control IgG precipitations and time-matched mock-infected controls. at least two transcription factors identified by modeling are significantly enriched on the promoter elements of their target genes following icSARS-CoV ORF6 infection. icSARS-CoV- and icSARS-CoV ORF6-infected Calu3 2B4 cells were harvested for ChIP at 0, 24, and 48 h postinfection. icSARS-CoV ORF6 is attenuated at low MOIs and in vivo. airway epithelial cells are major targets for SARS-CoV infection in humans and in mice (36, 60\u201362) icSARS-CoV ORF6 is attenuated at low MOIs and in B6 mice. 71 out of 96 genes in these pathways were significantly upregulated in icSARS-CoV ORF6 compared to icSARS-CoV at each time point. peak titers for icSARS-CoV were detected at 72 h postinfection. titers for icSARS-CoV ORF6 peaked at 96 h postinfection. titers for icSARS-CoV peaked at 96 h postinfection. 20-week-old B6 mice were infected with 105 PFU of icSARS-CoV mouse-adapted virus or icSARS-CoV ORF6 mouse-adapted virus. weight loss was measured each day, and lungs were harvested to assess viral titers at days 1, 2, 4 and 7 postinfection. icSARS-CoV and icSARS-CoV ORF6 growth kinetics in human lung cells. to determine if deletion of the SARS-CoV ORF6 gene caused a specific or more general effect on host transcription following the release of the block on karyopherin-mediated nuclear import. medium, total RNA, and protein were harvested at 0, 3, 7, 12, 24, 36, 48, 54, 60, and 72 h postinfection. icSARS-CoV or icSARS-CoV or icSARS-CoV ORF6-infected cells, ORF6 protein expression was detected after 24 h. membrane glycoprotein expression was detected at 24 h and peaked between 54 and 60 h during both virus infections. a total of 6,947 genes were differentially expressed (P 0.05; 2-fold change) differentially expressed genes were transcribed in icSARS-CoV and icSARS-CoV. after 48 h, there was 50 to 80% overlap in differentially expressed genes. this pattern of expression is likely a consequence of the differences in upstream gene regulation between icSARS-CoV and icSARS-CoV. values are fold change (log2) compared to time-matched mock infection or icSARS-CoV infection. icSARS-CoV had more differentially expressed genes early in the time course between 0 and 36 h postinfection. some of the most highly differentially expressed genes between the viruses were detected as early as 24 h postinfection. this early response period included genes enriched for interferon signaling and innate immune response pathways. this early response period included genes enriched for interferon signaling and innate immune response pathways. gene cluster C4 included 1,674 genes exclusively upregulated in icSARS-CoV ORF6 but unchanged in icSARS-CoV. the pattern of expression in gene cluster C4 was enriched in biological processes for chromosome organization and regulation of gene expression and nucleosome assembly. the number of connections between target genes in the data set and upstream regulatory transcription factors is greater than would be expected by chance. all of the transcription factor hubs (schematically represented by large circles in Fig. 3) associated with gene cluster C4 that were identified as being being regulated by karyopherins in MetaCore are listed in Table 1. diagram shows network for significantly overconnected transcription factor hubs. white circles represent overconnected transcriptional hubs. dark gray circles represent target nodes whose relative expression was lower with icSARS-CoV than with icSARS-ORF6. c Karyopherin 2 (importin 1). d The \u201cOther KPNA\u201d category includes karyopherin 1 (importin 5) and karyopherin 3 (importin 4). EPAS1 (HIF2A) uses importins 1, 3, 5, and 7. Differential gene expression quantitation for transcription factor networks. initial targeted approach identified the six transcription factors was restricted to the subset of genes in cluster C4 (Fig. 2A), which were upregulated exclusively in icSARS-ORF6-infected cells. however, we wondered if additional karyopherin-regulated transcription factors were also present in networks generated from the original 6,947 genes (in all 6 clusters) identified. this would suggest that karyopherins import transcription factors that both positively and negatively regulate downstream target genes during the course of S Calu3 2B4 transcriptomics resultsb Calu3 2B4 transcriptomics resultsb Calu3 2B4 transcriptomics and proteomics P valuec,g Actuald Expectede Ratiof P valueg p53 450 339.30 1.33 1.92E12 3.74E14* CREB1 364 265.40 1.37 2.79E12 6.93E13* VDR 103 74.82 1.38 1.76E04 2.13E05* Epas1 54 36.94 b 34 17.17 1.98 1.31E05 2.64E05 Irf5 25 11.76 2.13 4.11E05 7.84E05 Nfya 49 28.23 1.74 1.82E05 7.96E05 Arnt 47 33.41 1.41 5.89E03 4.84E04* Nrf2 76 59.52 1.28 9.82E03 1.01E03* Gata-3 101 79.76 1.27 4.36E03 3.37E03* PPAR- icSARS-CoV titers peaked at 48 h postinfection. replication titers for icSARS-CoV ORF6 increased over 72-h time course. icSARS-CoV ORF6 showed slower growth kinetics until later in infection. two of the enriched transcription factor hubs in HAE cultures, CREB1 and VDR, were also identified as important in the targeted Calu3 2B4 analysis of exclusively upregulated differentially expressed genes. the other 4 transcription factors overlapped the hubs identified from the global Calu3 2B4 gene microarray data set. a comparison of the CREB1 and VDR transcription factor networks, which were significantly enriched in both HAE and Calu3 2B4 cells, is shown in HAE cells were infected with wild-type or SARS-CoV ORF6 (MOI of 2). icSARS-CoV titers increased through 48 h postinfection. icSARS-CoV titers decreased slightly at 72 h postinfection. a total of 864 proteins were significantly (P 0.05) differentially expressed between icSARS-CoV and icSARS-CoV ORF6-infected Calu3 2B4 cells across all time points. if the proteomic data support a role for the ORF6 protein in karyopherin-mediated nuclear transport then we would expect an increase in the enrichment scores (increased significance) of these hubs. transcription factor hubs are uniquely upregulated during icSARS-CoV ORF6 infection. many protein nodes in the proteomic data set share common upstream transcription factor regulators with gene nodes in the transcriptional data. gene expression trends in icSARS-CoV ORF6 versus icSARS-CoV in both EDC3 and AP3M1. protein abundance also increased at late times during icSARS-CoV infection. icSARS-CoV infection protein levels failed to rise above mock infection values. icSARS-CoV or icSARS-CoV ORF6 cells were infected with icSARS-CoV or icSARS-CoV ORF6 or mock infected. protein and DNA were cross-linked, genomic DNA was sheared. gene-specific primer pairs were used to amplify DNA regions of interest by real-time PCR. 3 2B4 cells were infected with icSARS-CoV or icSARS-CoV ORF6. they were harvested for ChIP at 0, 24, and 48 h postinfection. icSARS-CoV ORF6 is attenuated at low MOIs and in vivo. low numbers of virus-infected cells early in infection would afford robust antiviral host gene expression and paracrine signaling, potentially limiting secondary rounds of viral replication. icSARS-CoV ORF6 is attenuated at low MOIs and in B6 mice. 71 out of 96 genes in these pathways were significantly upregulated in icSARS-CoV ORF6 compared to icSARS-CoV between 0 and 72 h postinfection in Calu3 2B4 cells. values are the fold change (log2) in icSARS-CoV ORF6 versus icSARS-CoV at each time point. weight loss was assessed each day postinfection through day 7. titers were assessed at the indicated times postinfection. mice infected with icSARS-CoV mouse-adapted virus lost weight. mice infected with icSARS-CoV mouse-adapted virus steadily lost weight. mice infected with icSARS-CoV ORF6 mouse-adapted virus lost no weight. weight loss in mice infected with icSARS-CoV mouse-adapted virus was significantly different. recombinant viruses lacking ORF6 expression are viable and replicate efficiently in vitro and in vivo (9, 59) recombinant viruses lacking ORF6 expression are viable and replicate efficiently in vivo and in vivo (9, 59) recombinant viruses lacking ORF6 expression are viable and replicate efficiently in vitro and in vivo (9, 59) the current ORF6 protein functional paradigm is that it blocks nuclear import by binding karyopherin 2 on internal membranes, sequestering karyopherin 1 and preventing karyopherin-regulated nuclear import of key antiviral transcription factors. STAT1 typically uses karyopherin 1 and 1 for import, suggesting that the primary targets for the ORF6 protein may actually be other key host response transcription factors and expression networks during infection. icSARS-CoV differential gene expression was detectable as early as 24 h postinfection and was higher than the levels detected for icSARS-CoV ORF6 through 36 h postinfection. at 48 h postinfection, a drastic change occurred with the number of differentially expressed genes still increasing for icSARS-CoV. data tracked with levels of detectable ORF6 protein expression. changes mediated by the ORF6 protein during infection can likely be uncoupled from replication kinetics but still modulate pathogenesis. CREB1 plays an important role in lung cancer but can also mediate many acute and chronic lung disease phenotypes. many viruses have designed strategies to counter p53 signaling (80\u201383) p53 expression enhances innate immunity by enhancing IFN-dependent antiviral activity via IRF-9 activation. p53 expression enhances innate immunity by enhancing IFN-dependent antiviral activity via IRF-9 activation. a range of approaches were applied to provide a comprehensive view of karyopherin-dependent nuclear importation mediated by the ORF6 protein during SARS-CoV infection. the overlap in regulatory events across systems can be considered independent confirmation of the mechanism of action for the ORF6 protein during SARS-CoV infection. the category of genes most affected by release of ORF6 protein nuclear importation block in vitro-regulated overall gene expression, cellular rearrangement for division, and factors required for differentiation. the intracellular environment may play a substantial role in determining levels of viral pathogenesis and controlling the intracellular antiviral state."}
