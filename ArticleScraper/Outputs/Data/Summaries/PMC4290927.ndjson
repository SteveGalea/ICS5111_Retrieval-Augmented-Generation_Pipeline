{"summary": "the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A H7N9 virus (H7N9) infection in china has become an important national public health concern. two waves were observed during this outbreak (2). human infections with avian influenza H7N9 virus slowed, with only a few sporadic cases reported. Enhanced surveillance for influenza A/H7N9 virus was conducted in 28 sentinel hospitals and 23 collaborating laboratories in 21 cities from 16 April 2013 in Guangdong, China. positive cases were then tested for influenza A virus subtypes (H1, H5, and H7) using commercial real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) methods. swabs and tracheal aspirates were collected and tested for potential H7N9 infections. relevant poultry and environmental samples, including poultry manure, epilator swabs, sewage swabs and chopping swabs, were collected according to potential exposure history. genome libraries were prepared with the Ion Xpress Plus fragment library kit (Life Technologies) samples were bar-coded with the Ion Xpress bar code adapter 1\u201332 kit (Life Technologies) final sequencing was performed with the Ion PGM Sequencing 200 kit v2 (Life Technologies) using the Ion 316 Chip V2 on an Ion PGM system. laboratory evidence of H7N9 infection was defined as H7N9 viral RNA detection or virus isolation from respiratory specimens. all household members and health care workers who had close contact with the confirmed case without effective personal protection were treated as close contacts. a cluster of H7N9 infection is defined as at least two close-contact persons having laboratory-confirmed H7N9 infection. hemagglutination-positive allantoic fluids were collected and subtyped by hemagglutination and neuraminidase (NA) inhibition (HAI and NAI) assays. viral RNA extraction was first performed by using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) 100 cases of human avian influenza A (H7N9) virus infection were officially reported to the Guangdong Center for Disease Control and Prevention. a total of 3,228 close contacts were followed up for a minimum period of 7 days after their last exposure to the cases. each had 2 household members, and no health care workers were involved. 9.5 38.0 39.3 White cell count (109/liter) 2.92 7.90 2.27 12.98 9.69 N/A Chest radiography Bilateral pneumonia N/A Bilateral pneumonia N/A Bronchopneumonia N/A Mechanical ventilation Yes No No No No No No Oseltamivir treatment Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Type of exposure Worked in live poultry market Handled poultry products; poultry death at home Poultry death at home. the index patient sold tofu in a live poultry market from which H7N9-positive environmental samples have since been collected. the last time she recalled going to the market was 2 January (12 days before she attended the hospital with fever) the index patient stayed at home every day and slept with his daughter at noon. the index patient was referred to a county-level hospital on 29 January. he began to take oseltamivir (75 mg twice a day) because of progressive respiratory distress. he was transferred again to a tertiary hospital in Zhongshan on 30 January. a throat swab tested H7N9 positive by RT-PCR. the index patient's daughter coslept with her parents until her father was hospitalized. sixteen close contacts of these cases were identified. cluster 3 included 2 of 8 family members living together in a private building in the suburb of Zhaoqing, Guangdong Province, china. fever (a maximum body temperature of 39.3\u00b0C), cough, sneezing, and rhinorrhea were reported at the onset of illness. the girl was treated by intravenous injection of ceftizoxime, Xuebijing, and ribavirin. the most common early symptom of illness was fever (5 of 6) for pediatric cases, only mild symptoms developed. fever, cough and rhinorrhea were also common symptoms in pediatric cases. nucleotide sequences were analyzed using the maximum likelihood method. supporting bootstrap values greater than 60 are shown. both human and chicken isolates had substitutions of Gly186Val and Gln226Leu (H3 numbering) at the receptor binding site of HA. a throat swab tested positive for H7N9 by RT-PCR. the second case was the index patient's 5-year-old daughter. the index patient sold tofu in a live poultry market from which H7N9-positive environmental samples have since been collected. cluster 2 included two of six family members living together in a rural village of Zhongshan, Guangdong province. the index patient developed chills, fever, sore throat, and dizziness. he was referred to a county-level hospital on 29 January. girl was directly admitted to the tertiary hospital in Zhongshan. initial routine tests revealed a maximum body temperature of 39.5\u00b0C, a WBC count of 12.98 109/liter, a neutrophilic granulocyte level of 80.44%, and a lymphocyte level equal to 9.64%. her condition improved gradually, and she was discharged in good health. a positive reaction was observed in a rapid influenza diagnostic test. this boy was treated with oseltamivir (75 mg twice a day) on the third day of illness (30 January), he was transferred to a tertiary hospital in Zhaoqing and treated in isolation. the boy was discharged on the 11 February. index and second patient fed 20 chickens on the top floor, 2 of which died on 17 January (9 days before the onset of symptoms in the 5-year-old girl) in their daily life, feeding chickens was reported to be one of the children's favorite pastimes. strains isolated from patients in the same cluster shared high sequence similarities. all of the eight internal genes in viral strains isolated from same cluster were clustered together in the phylogenetic trees. both were associated with the second cluster (from live poultry market) and isolated as the viral mixtures including H7N9 and H9N2 viruses. Arg292Lys substitution in NA gene associated with oseltamivir and zanamivir resistance was not recorded. this suggests that oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir should still be active. a cluster of cases may be the first suggestion of a viral or epidemiological change. in clusters 2 and 3, the durations between the onset of the index and the second case were within the documented average incubation period of 6 days (17, 18), suggesting simultaneous and/or common sources of infection. a large number of traced contacts associated with confirmed cases have not been diagnosed as infected with the H7N9 virus. the preponderance of genetically related cases in clustering outbreaks suggests genetic susceptibility as an important contributor to H7N9 infection. this finding is consistent with the case series of H7N9 infections detected through china's national sentinel surveillance system for influenza-like illness. rhinorrhea was observed in two of the four pediatric patients in this study. more comprehensive assessment of the clinical features of pediatric patients requires additional case data."}
