{"summary": "the fungal microbiome of the exhaled breath condensate of lung cancer patients was analysed. 27.9% of lung cancer patients showed a presence of aspergillus niger. inflammatory status is likely to play a role in lung cancer transformation. the main fungus that could play a role in lung cancer transformation is the Aspergillus, a mold that forms conidia which can bypass mucociliary clearance mechanisms. no comprehensive studies are available on this field. a sample from airways is completely non-invasive and apparently suitable for microbiological studies. it contains volatile, soluble and OMIC markers, most of which have already been demonstrated to be useful in the non-invasive diagnosis of several lung diseases. this is because there are no non-invasive screening tools providing a key for its early detection and improving a person\u2019s chances of survival. all the patients were enrolled in the study before pathological diagnosis. 21 subjects turned out to be negative and considered controls. suspicions of lung cancer were confirmed in the remaining 43 subjects. the sample was transferred on freshly prepared Dichloran Rose-Bengal Chloramphenicol Agar (DRBC, Oxoid) medium. the plates were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 7 days and examined daily. species names were determined by following the taxonomic keys of Klich [18] p value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. patients 64 consecutive patients with a suspicion of lung cancer consented to the study. enrolled at the Unit of Thoracic Surgery, Casa di Cura La Madonnina, Bari and the Department of Respiratory Disease, Foggia University. 21 subjects turned out to be negative and considered controls. adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in 36 (83.7%) subjects. 7 (16.2%) subjects were found to be affected by lung cancer. the plates were incubated for 7 days on CYA (Czapek Yeast Extract Agar) at 25\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. the plates were examined daily for subsequent identification to species level. paired bronchial brushing was found to have a similar sensibility compared to the bronchial brushing for fungi detection. no difference was found according to sex, age, histotype, stage, smoking habit, pack years, time since quitting smoking in subjects with fungal colonization (p > 0.05). fungal positivity has been described as a one-off report or as a result of the immunodepression. identifying other risk factors (more than the smoking habit) could have socio-economic consequences for lung cancer. we have designed this preliminary study to analyse the possible fungal involvement in lung cancerogenesis. lung cancer patients were unable to find any correlation between fungi positivity and sex, age, histotype, stage, smoking habit of subjects studied that would help us define the pathogenetic role of fungi identified in lung cancer patients. the number of patients enrolled in this study was low and justified our results, which we intend to verify on a larger population. we can offer a broader view on the infective status of airways of lung cancer patients. we support any future studies in this emerging field that could open up the possibility of microbiota manipulation."}
