{"summary": "study investigated role and mechanism of alprostadil in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by oleic acid (OA) in rats. OA model was induced by femoral vein injection of OA, and alprostadil was administrated immediately. expression of ACE, inflammatory mediators, apoptotic-related proteins, and proteins in the MAPKs and NF-B signaling pathways were determined by Western blot or immunohistochemical stain alprostadil is a lipid microsphere-incorporated prostaglandin E1. it is reported to promote pulmonary vasodilation and increase oxygenation. it is also reported to decrease lung vascular permeability. alprostadil may be useful in prevention and treatment of ARDS. a recent study showed that activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway is involved in ARDS. p38 MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) are all significantly increased in LPS-induced lung injury. inhibition of these proteins efficiently attenuates LPS-induced pulmonary inflammatory response. eicosanoids leukotriene C4, prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin I2 have been implicated in Ang II-regulated vascular permeability changes. ACE functions as a lung-injury-promoting factor in ALI. sensitivity to apoptosis signals mainly depends on the process of competitive dimerization of Bcl-2/Bax in cells. OA-induced ARDS model was used to investigate effects of alprostadil on lung injury. possible mechanisms involved in alprostadil\u2019s role in ARDS were also examined in MAPKs and NF-B pathways, ACE expression, and apoptosis. a dose of 0.1 ml/kg OA and an equal amount of saline were injected slowly into the femoral vein at to induce ARDS. rats in the control group were administered an equal volume of saline. three hours after OA administration, all animals were sacrificed. the extent of fibrosis in these sections was graded using a microscope. none (0), no evidence of fibrosis; mild (1+), focal regions of fibrosis involving less than 20% of the lung. rabbit anti-rat anti-ACE antibody (1: 300 dilution, Elabscience Biotechnology Co., Ltd, China), followed by incubation at 4\u00b0C overnight. sections were then washed 3 times with PBS or TBS for 2 min each time. reagent 1 was then added, followed by incubation at room temperature for 20 min, followed by incubation at room temperature for 2030 min. goat anti-rabbit (or mouse) secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1: 5000) was added as secondary antibody. all the antibodies used were purchased from Elabscience Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (China) rats were anesthetized with 20% urethane (Bai Hui Biological Technology Co., Ltd.) at a dose of 1 g/kg, a dose of 0.1 ml/kg OA and an equal amount of saline were administered slowly into the femoral vein at to induce ARDS. three hours after OA administration, all animals were sacrificed and the lungs were excised. each item was scored on a 5-point scale as follows: 0, minimal damage; 1, mild damage; 2, moderate damage; 3, severe damage; and 4, maximum damage. the extent of fibrosis in these sections was graded using a microscope (VANOX, Olympus, Japan) sections were then washed with PBS 3 times for 2 min each time. we added rabbit anti-rat anti-ACE antibody (1: 300 dilution, Elabscience Biotechnology Co., Ltd, China), followed by incubation at 4\u00b0C overnight. color development was performed with DAB (Cat # ZLI-9019, ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China) goat anti-rabbit (or mouse) secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1: 5000) was added as secondary antibody. results of all protein expression by Western blot are expressed as ratios of optical density value to those of internal controls. OA (0.1 ml/kg) was injected from femoral vein of rats. control group was sacrificed at 3 h after OA stimulation. alprostadil treatment ameliorates OA-induced lung tissue histopathological changes. prostadil treatment reduced collagen deposition and fibrosis scoring in a dose-dependent manner. these data suggest that alprostadil protects rat from OA-induced lung tissue damage. alprostadil inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and protects rats from OA-induced lung inflammation. rats were injected with OA and alprostadil as described in Figure 1. rats were injected with OA and alprostadil as described in Figure 1. alprostadil reduces expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax. but increases expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. rats were injected with OA and alprostadil as described in Figure 1. proteins were extracted from the lungs and analyzed by Western blot. -actin was used as internal control. expression of ACE in lung tissues was observed by immunohistochemistry. brown cells represent positive cells. DAB was used to stain the cells. bar graphs represent ACE-positive area from immunohistochemistry. the OA-induced W/D ratio was observed when 10 g/kg alprostadil was administrated (P0.05) these results suggest that alprostadil has protective effects on OA-induced lung edema. alprostadil treatment reduced collagen deposition and fibrosis scoring in a dose-dependent manner. this data suggest that alprostadil protects rat from OA-induced lung tissue damage. OA administration caused a significant increase in expression of TNF- and IL-1. alprostadil (2.5, 5, and 10 g/kg) administration caused an obviously decrease in expression of TNF- and IL-1 in the lung tissue. these results indicate that alprostadil inhibits production of pro-inflammatory mediators and protects rats from OA-induced lung inflammation. OA administration markedly increased the phosphorylation of p65. treatment with alprostadil significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, JNK, and p65. alprostadil can alleviate ARDS by suppressing MAPKs and NF-B signaling pathways. alprostadil inhibits the production of ACE in the lung tissue of rats with OA-induced ARDS. but 10 g/kg treatment significantly prevented the increase of Bax expression and the decrease of Bcl-2 expression in lung tissues. OA administration caused significant increase in ACE expression in ARDS rats. a significant difference was found when 10 g/kg alprostadil was administrated. a significant difference was found when alprostadil was administrated. OA administration significantly increased lung W/D ration, expression of ACE, pro-inflammatory factors, pro-apoptotic proteins, and activation of MAPKs and NF-B signaling pathways in the rat lung tissue. findings suggest that alprostadil administration prevents OA-induced ARDS and inflammation. masson trichrome staining was performed to observe the collagen formation in bronchial airways. results showed typical pathological changes in the lungs of OA-administrated rats. expression of TNF- and IL-1 in the lung tissues were significantly increased. the balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors in the lungs may play an important role in determining the fate of the epithelium. the sensitivity to apoptotic signals mainly depends on the process of competitive dimerization of Bcl-2/Bax in cells. ACE is a key member of the classical renin\u2013angiotensin system. the lungs are major organs that express ACE in humans and rats. the importance of ACE in ARDS has been widely emphasized. alprostadil has protective effects against lung injury in OA-induced ARDS. this protective effect might be related to its ability to prevent release of pro-inflammatory mediators, suppressing the activation of MAPKs and NF-B signaling pathways."}
