{"summary": "influenza A virus (IAV) is the most pathogenic and the only influenza virus associated with global pandemics. seasonal IAV epidemics have caused high morbidity and economic losses in the past century. avian influenza viruses became a great concern (5, 6), with over 50% mortality. innate immune system sentinel cells form first line of defense against IAV infection together with the epithelial cells. human monocyte-derived DCs express -2,3- and -2,6-linked sialic acids and can be infected with both human and avian IAVs. vaccines contain hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) antigens. the formation of siRNAs is dependent on the activity of a Dicer enzyme, an RNase III endonuclease (18, 19) the enzyme recognizes and binds to the 5\u2032 end of long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) substrate and cuts the RNA molecule into small RNA duplexes with 2-nucleotide (nt)-long 3\u2032 terminal overhangs. the size of the produced siRNAs varies depending on the organism in s can be used against different targets including new emerging viral diseases. chemically synthesized 25- to 27-nt-long siRNAs are substrates for the Dicer enzyme. this interaction with Dicer facilitates the loading of the siRNAs into the RISC. this interaction with Dicer facilitates the loading of the siRNAs into the RISC. IAV RNA polymerase genes reduced mortality in experimental IAV infection and also virus replication in the lungs. the aim of the present study was to investigate the inhibition of viral gene expression, protein synthesis, and the production of IAVs for seasonal and avian influenza viruses. a chimeric IAV construct of 2,756 bp comprising these sequences was generated based on the A/wild duck/Hunan/211/2005 virus sequences. a chimeric cDNA construct containing selected conserved regions of the PB1, PB2, PA, NP, M, and NS genes of the A/wild duck/Hunan/211/2005 strain was excluded from the construct due to their significant genetic variability. an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-expressing DsiRNA swarm was generated as a control in a similar fashion using in vitro-synthesized eGFP gene-specific dsRNA as a substrate for the Dicer. cIAV DsiRNA swarm induced significant inhibition of avian IAV replication in human macrophages and moDCs. 21 h later cells were infected with H5N1 and H7N the relative infection efficiencies of H5N1 and H7N9 viruses were almost equal in moDCs. pretransfection of cells with a nonspecific chemically synthetized 21-nt siRNA (Fig. 2, neg siRNA) or with an eGFP-specific DsiRNA swarm prior to H5N1 virus infection inhibited viral M1 RNA expression in macrophages at 24 h p.i. however, viral M1 RNA expression remained in gene-specific mRNA, and relative IAV M1 RNA levels were calculated by the CT method using untreated cellular RNA as a calibrator. data are representative of three individual experiments. cIAV DsiRNAs and control siRNAs were transfected into human macrophages or moDCs with cIAV DsiRNA swarm. antiviral activity of the control siRNA and eGFP DsiRNAs was weak. antiviral activity of the control siRNA swarm was weak. atant was significantly increased at 24 h, resulting in a 104- to 105-fold increase in virus titers. pretreatment of macrophages with a cIAV-specific DsiRNA swarm blocked the secretion of H5N1 virus into cell supernatants. in moDC suspension cultures, it was technically not possible to remove the input virus. macrophages were washed twice with PBS at 1 h p.i. and then maintained in a macrophage medium. the infective viral titers produced from macrophages and moDCs were determined by plaque assay in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. pretreated cells, viral RNA levels significantly decreased. in moDCs, cIAV DsiRNA pretreatment significantly reduced H5N1 virus production. pretreatment with cIAV-specific DsiRNA can efficiently inhibit the productive replication of H5N1 virus in human primary macrophages and moDCs. all seasonal IAVs replicated efficiently in moDCs. pretransfection of cells with either a negative siRNA or eGFP-specific DsiRNA swarm did not reduce viral M1 RNA expression of any of the seasonal IAVs except the Beijing/89 strain. however, no reduction was detected in viral protein expression under these conditions. at 24 h p.i. cells from different blood donors were pooled. values were normalized against -actin gene-specific mRNA. relative IAV M1 RNA levels were calculated by the CT method. pretransfection with the cIAV DsiRNA swarm significantly reduced viral M1 RNA expression in H3N2/72, H3N2/89, and H1N1/09 virus-infected Calu-3 cells. Western blotting data also showed dramatic inhibition of viral protein expression in infected cells under such conditions. cIAV DsiRNAs failed to inhibit IBV NP RNA expression in IBV-infected cells. cIAV DsiRNA swarm induced significant inhibition of IAV replication in A549 cells. human lung epithelial A549 cells were mock transfected (control or no-siRNA bars) or pretransfected with the indicated control and IAV-specific siRNA/DsiRNAs (10 nM) after 21 h of incubation, cells were infected with the indicated IAVs at an MOI of 1 for an additional 24 h. cIAV DsiRNAs can inhibit IAV replication in human moDCs only when administered prior to infection. moDCs were transfected with siRNAs 21 h before or 1 h after infection with H3N2/72 virus. pretransfection with cIAV DsiRNAs after IAV infection failed to inhibit viral M1 RNA expression in infected cells. the values were normalized against -actin gene-specific mRNA. relative IAV M1 RNA levels were calculated using untreated cells as a calibrator. data are representative of three individual experiments. an 88-bp dsRNA was used as a positive control. transfection with the 88-bp dsRNA induced a significant induction of IFN gene expression in macrophages and also in the moDCs. all the siRNAs (both single-site and DsiRNA swarms) induced only relatively weak IFN-1 and IFN-1 mRNA expression. values are the means (SD) of three parallel analyses. data are representative of three individual experiments. the means (SD) of three parallel analyses are shown. data are representative of three individual experiments. pretransfection of siRNAs induced weak IFN responses in macrophages and moDCs. no reduction in viral protein expression was detected in control siRNA-treated cells. however, pretransfection of the cIAV-specific DsiRNA swarm dramatically inhibited viral PB1 and NP protein expression in all types of cells. the inhibition of IAV replication by pretransfection with cIAV DsiRNAs is partly due to specific IAV gene silencing. -PCR analyses were normalized against -actin gene-specific mRNA. the relative IAV M1 mRNA level was calculated using untreated control cells as a calibrator. a representative experiment of three independent experiments is shown. construct of 2,756 bp comprising these sequences was generated based on the A/wild duck/Hunan/211/2005 virus sequences. a chimeric cDNA construct containing selected conserved regions of the PB1, PB2, PA, NP, M, and NS genes of the A/wild duck/Hunan/211/2005 (H5N1) IAV strain is shown. an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-expressing DsiRNA swarm was generated as a control in a similar fashion using in vitro-synthesized eGFP gene-specific dsRNA as a substrate for the Dicer. to assess the antiviral effect of an in vitro-produced cIAV DsiRNA swarm, cIAV DsiRNAs and control siRNAs were transfected into human macrophages or mo pretransfection of cells with a nonspecific chemically synthetized 21-nt siRNA (Fig. 2, neg siRNA) or with an eGFP-specific DsiRNA swarm prior to H5N1 virus infection inhibited viral M1 RNA expression in macrophages at 24 h p.i. however, viral M1 RNA expression remained practically unchanged in human macrophages and moDCs after transfection with the control siRNA or DsiRNA the means (SD) of three parallel analyses are shown. data are representative of three individual experiments. the data are representative of three individual experiments. radiated virus since UV treatment completely inactivated the infectivity of IAVs. pretransfection with the single-site negative siRNA reduced the expression of PB1 and NS1 in H5N1 or H7N9 virus-infected macrophages. the nonspecific antiviral activity of the control DsiRNA swarm was weak. pretreatment of macrophages with a cIAV-specific DsiRNA swarm blocked the secretion of H5N1 virus into cell supernatants. macrophages were washed twice with PBS at 1 h p.i. and separately pretransfected with the indicated siRNA or DsiRNAs (10 nM) the infective viral titers produced from macrophages and moDCs were determined by plaque assay in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Statistical significance was determined against results from samples of nontransfected H5N1 virus-infected cells. pretreatment with cIAV-specific DsiRNA significantly reduced H5N1 virus production as measured by PCR-based viral RNA quantitation in cell culture supernatants. the production of infectious H7N9 virus in macrophage culture supernatants was low due to impaired activation cleavage of the strain used, LPAI H7N9 (41), but yet pretreatment with cIAV DsiRNA showed some efficacy in inhibition of H7N9 virus cIAV DsiRNA pretransfection resulted in complete inhibition of NP and NS1 protein expression in H3N2/72 virus-infected cells. cIAV DsiRNA pretransfection resulted in substantial reduction in the expression of NP and NS1 proteins of all other tested seasonal IAVs in infected moDCs. p.i. cells from different blood donors were pooled. the values were normalized against -actin gene-specific mRNA. relative IAV M1 RNA levels were calculated by the CT method. cIAV DsiRNA swarm significantly reduced viral M1 RNA expression in H3N2/72, H3N2/89, and H1N1/09 virus-infected Calu-3 cells. western blotting data also showed dramatic inhibition of viral protein expression in infected cells under such conditions. cells were mock transfected or pretransfected with the indicated control and IAV-specific siRNA/DsiRNAs (10 nM) cIAV DsiRNAs failed to inhibit IBV NP RNA expression in IBV-infected cells. cIAV DsiRNA swarm induced significant inhibition of IAV replication in A549 cells. cells were mock transfected (control or no-siRNA bars) or pretransfected with the indicated control and IAV-specific siRNA/DsiRNAs (10 nM) after 21 h of incubation, cells were infected with the indicated IAVs at an MOI of 1 for an additional 24 h. moDCs were transfected with siRNAs 21 h before or 1 h after the infection with H3N2/72 virus (MOI of 1). pretransfection with cIAV DsiRNAs led to a 90% to 95% reduction in viral M1 RNA expression in infected cells. transfection with cIAV DsiRNAs after IAV infection failed to inhibit viral M1 RNA expression. the values were normalized against -actin gene-specific mRNA. relative IAV M1 RNA levels were calculated by the CT method. data are representative of three individual experiments. transfection with the 88-bp dsRNA induced a significant induction of IFN gene expression in macrophages and also in the moDCs. all the siRNAs (both single-site and DsiRNA swarms) induced only relatively weak IFN-1 and IFN-1 mRNA expression. qRT-PCR analysis of IFN gene expression. values are the means (SD) of three parallel analyses. data are representative of three individual experiments. the antiviral effect of a cIAV-specific DsiRNA swarm is independent of a functional IFN system. pretransfection of siRNAs induced weak IFN responses in macrophages and moDCs. IAV M1 expression was significantly decreased in cIAV-specific DsiRNA pretransfected wt, IFNAR KO, and NF-B KO cells. pretransfection of the cIAV-specific DsiRNA swarm dramatically inhibited viral PB1 and NP protein expression in all types of cells. the means (SD) of three parallel analyses are shown. data are representative of three individual experiments. a representative experiment of three independent experiments is shown. the rapid evolution of IAVs and the appearance of new virus variants create problems for the clinical efficacy of IAV vaccines. the development of various types of siRNA strategies may provide a novel means to prevent and treat severe IAV infections. a combination of siRNAs may decrease the off-target effects and increase the virus specificity of gene silencing. cIAV-specific dsRNAs were produced by an in vitro transcription and replication system. the dsRNA molecules were further digested into 25- to 27-nt-long IAV-specific DsiRNAs by the Dicer enzyme. this approach could combine the benefits of DsiRNAs and siRNA swarms. cIAV siRNAs inhibit the replication of a broad range of IAV strains. PB1 protein is the catalytic subunit of the IAV polymerase. cIAV siRNAs were pretransfected into human lung epithelial cells. liposome transfection (lipofection) can easily reduce the viability of primary cells. in contrast, liposome transfection appears to be less toxic to primary cells. in the present study, we screened several liposome reagents and found that transIT-X2 showed the highest efficiency for delivering siRNAs into the cells, and it was also the least harmful to cell viability. negative-control siRNA or eGFP DsiRNA swarm weakly inhibited viral M1 mRNA expression of some IAV strains. we also tested the potential of siRNAs and DsiRNAs to elicit IFN responses. study suggests treatment with a cIAV-specific DsiRNA swarm may inhibit IAV replication by two mechanisms: it can inhibit IAV replication through gene silencing and through induction. there is a controversy about whether inducing IFN responses by siRNA is beneficial or harmful for siRNA-based antiviral activity. some studies have shown that siRNAs can result in global inhibition of protein translation and cell death. others have reported that nonspecific immunostimulatory effects induced by siRNAs could contribute to more effective antiviral activity. cIAV-specific DsiRNA swarm effectively inhibits avian and seasonal influenza virus replication in various types of human cell systems. the findings have significant implications for the use of siRNAs and DsiRNAs for the prophylaxis and therapy of IAV infections. the cells were cultivated for 6 days, and fresh medium was added every 2 days. wild-type and KO cell lines were obtained after rigorous passaging of MEFs until a stable immortalized cell line was obtained.
