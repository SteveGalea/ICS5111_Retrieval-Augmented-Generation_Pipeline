{"summary": "enterovirus 71 (EV71)3 is a single positive-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae (1). EV71 circulates endemically each year from summer through fall, causing high morbidity with significant casualties among children. despite concentrated efforts, specific antiviral therapy is still not available against EV71. IFNs have been clinically used in treatment of many viral infections. but they have had very limited effect on patients infected with EV71 (10. surprisingly, they have had very limited effect on patients infected with EV71. IFN- failed to inhibit EV71 replication in cell cultures pretreated at high concentrations of up to 1,000 ng/ml. no significant changes between cells treated with IFN- or left untreated were detected in VP1. cytopathic effects of infected cells pretreated with or without IFN-. cells were fixed at 72 h p.i. with 3% formaldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. after washes the cells were subjected to light microscopy. transcript levels of MX1, MX2, OAS1, IFI27, ISG54, and ISG56 increased up to 128.5-, 700.4-, 225.7-, 443.7-, 84.2-, and 94.1-fold respectively, in IFN--treated cells infected with EV71. EV71 inhibited induction of ISGs stimulated by IFN-. total RNA was prepared from the cells for cDNA synthesis. cell lysates were prepared from infected or uninfected cells, stimulated with or without IFN-. EV71 inhibited the induction of MX1 and MX2. the cells were subjected to Western blot analyses with anti-MX1 or anti-MX2 antibodies. EV71 infection did not alter expression or phosphorylation status of IFNAR1 or JAK1. expression of IFNAR1 or JAK1 stimulated by IFN-, was not altered. EV71 infection did not alter expression or phosphorylation status of IFNAR1 or JAK1. cells were infected with EV71 at an m.o.i. of 1 (D) or 10 (E) for 24 h, followed by stimulation with IFN- for another 30 min. phosphorylation of STAT1/2 was not affected by EV71 infection. EV71 infection did not target STAT1 or STAT2 for degradation. STAT1/2 are phosphorylated and then associated with IRF9 to form ISGF3 complex. the complex is then translocated into the nucleus for ISG induction. EV71 infection blocked STAT1 from translocation into the nucleus. heLa cells were infected with EV71 for 24 h, followed by stimulation with IFN- at 20 ng/ml for another 30 min. the cells were fixed and incubated with anti-VP1 or anti-STAT1 antibodies. after washes, the cells were stained with DAPI. EV71 infection disrupted the formation of STAT/KPNA1 complex after IFN- stimulation. tubulin and histone H1 were used as loading controls for cytosolic and nuclear fractions. the IFN-induced complex of STAT/KPNA1 was disrupted. cells were infected with EV71 for 24 h and afterward treated with IFN- for 30 min. the immunoprecipitates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with an anti-kPNA1 antibody. KPNA1 was degraded in RD and vero cells but not in HT-29 cells. we further compared status of IFNAR1, JAK1, KPNA1, and TRIF in vero and human intestinal epithelial HT-29 cells. we previously showed a robust induction of IFN- during EV71 infection. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing tagged 2A protein (2Apro) or 3C protein (3Cpro); their expression is shown in Fig. 7A. ectopic expression of 3Cpro at various doses could cleave TRIF but had no effect on KPNA1. the cell lysates were collected 16 h later and analyzed for luciferase activities. the experiments were repeated at least three times. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with reporter plasmid, pISRE-Luc. HEK293 cells were transfected with pRK5-HA-2A or pRK5-Flag-3C. total RNA was prepared for real-time RT-PCR analyses. specific primers for MX1 (A), MX2 (B), IFIHI (C), IFI27 (D), OAS2 (E) and IFIT1 (F) were used for RT-PCR. the cell lysates were prepared for Western blot analyses with anti-KPNA1 antibodies. the cells were pretreated with proteasome inhibitor MG132 at 5 m, autophagy inhibitor 3-MA at 10 mm, or 20 nm of a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPH for 12 h. pretreatment with Q-VD-OPH significantly blocked the degradation of KPNA1. pretreatment with MG132 or 3-MA had no effect on KPNA1 expression. EV71-induced degradation of KPNA1 was caspase-dependent. inhibition of caspase-3 decreased EV71 replication through EV71. the inhibition of proteasome and autophagy affected EV71 replication independent of KPNA1. the cells were pretreated with 5 m MG132, 10 mm 3-MA or 20 nm Q-VD-OPH for 12 h. caspase-3 knockdown promoted translocation of STAT2 into the nucleus in IFN-treated cells infected with EV71. at 24 h after transfection, cells were infected with EV71 at an m.o.i. of 10. 24 h later, the cell lysates were collected and examined. fected cells with EV71 at an m.o.i. of 10 for 24 h were examined with Western blot analyses. the results showed that caspase-3 is involved in the degradation of KPNA1 during EV71 infection. caspase-3-specific siRNA1 was inhibited, and the levels of KPNA1 returned to the normal level. infection at an m.o.i. of 0.2 and observed under a light microscope for cytopathic effect (CPE) no difference was exhibited in cells treated with IFN- ranging from 100 to 1,000 ng/ml. culture medium supernatants from the cells were harvested at 48 h p.i. total RNA was isolated from the cells pretreated with IFN- for real-time RT-PCR to measure viral VP1 gene copy numbers. cells were prepared from infected or uninfected cells and then pretreated with IFN- for Western blot analyses. ISG54, and ISG56 transcripts were present up only to 29.9-, 117.1-, 37.5-, 73.2-, 20.3-, and 21.5-fold respectively. the induction of ISGs in EV7-infected cells without IFN- stimulation was barely detectable. this data suggest that IFN- signaling is strongly suppressed in EV71-infected cells. EV71 virions inactivated by UV illumination were used for infection in vero cells. induction of ISG transcripts were comparable in IFN--treated cells. expression of MX1 and MX2 was clearly induced by IFN- stimulation. EV71 infection did not alter expression of IFNAR1 or JAK1. EV71 infection at an m.o.i. of 10 did not alter IFNAR1 or JAK1 expression. both IFNAR1 and JAK were up-regulated slightly upon IFN- stimulation. blot analyses with antibodies specific for STAT1, STAT2, p-STAT1 or p-STAT2. EV71 infection had no effect on the protein or phosphorylation level of STAT1/2. the whole cell lysates were analysed with relevant antibodies. EV71 infection prevented STAT1/STAT2 from translocation into the nucleus. the two are associated with IRF9 to assemble and form the ISGF3 complex. EV71 infection inhibited STAT1 from translocation into the nucleus. p-STAT1 and STAT2 were phosphorylated upon IFN- stimulation. in EV71-infected cells, p-STAT1 was mostly retained in the cytosol. p-STAT2 was present significantly less in the nucleus in infected cells. EV71 infection blocked the IFN-stimulated nuclear translocation of p-STAT1/2. we immunoprecipitated KPNA1 by incubation of cell lysates prepared from infected or control cells with or without IFN- stimulation, with an anti-kPNA1 antibody. AT1, KPNA1, and -actin were shown by Western blot analyses. RD cells were infected with EV71 at an m.o.i. of 2. cell lysates were prepared at indicated time points for Western blot analysis. the levels of IFNAR1 and JAK1 remained unchanged in EV71-infected vero and HT-29 cells (15, 16) the targeted proteins would mostly likely be KPNA1 as well as TRIF in vero cells (and in RD cells) none of KPNA1 or TRIF was affected or degraded in EV71-infected cells. ectopic expression of 3Cpro at various doses for transfection could cleave TRIF but had no effect on KPNA1. 2Apro and 3Cpro proteases did not cleave KPNA1 or inhibit IFN- response. 2Apro and 3Cpro proteases did not cleave KPNA1. HEK293 cells were transfected with pRK5-HA-2A or pRK5-Flag-3C at the indicated doses. at 24 h post-transfection, the cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml of IFN-. the cell lysates were prepared after 16 h and analyzed for luciferase activity. EV71-induced KPNA1 degradation is caspase-3-dependent. total RNA was prepared at 12, 24, and 36 h p.i. by the TRIzol reagent. caspase-8 (Z-IETD-FMK, 30 m), caspase-3 (Z-DEVD-FMK, 100 m), and caspase-6 (Z-VEID-FMK, 50 m) were pretreated with proteasome inhibitor MG132 at 5 m, autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) at 10 mm, followed by infection with EV71 at an m.o.i. of 10 for another 12 h. cell lysates were added to the culture medium for 6 h prior to infection with EV71. only pretreatment of the cells with the caspase-3-specific inhibitor blocked the degradation of KPNA1 in EV71 infection. inhibition of caspase-3 decreased EV71 replication through KPNA1. infectious viral titers were determined by TCID50 assays in vero cells. B, a specific inhibitor for caspase-3 inhibited virus replication. cells were pretreated with or without Z-DEVD-FMK for 6 h. the cells were transfected with EV71 at an m.o.i. of 10 for 24 h, followed by stimulation with IFN- for 30 min. the cytosolic (E) and nuclear (F) fractions were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE. in EV71-infected cells, IFN-induced STAT2 was predominately retained in the cytoplasm. in uninfected cells, IFN-induced STAT2 was mainly translocated into the nucleus. but knockdown of caspase-3 increased the translocation of STATs into the nucleus for IFN response in infected cells treated with IFN-. EV71 is capable of antagonizing IFN for downstream stimulation of induction of ISGs, which is mediated by the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. previous studies showed that EV71 disrupted type I IFN signaling by down-regulating IFNAR1 and that 2A was responsible for the inhibitory effect on IFN response. however, a recent study reported that EV71 infection did not alter either the total expression level or surface expression of IFNAR1. p-STAT1 and p-STAT2 were retained in the cytosol and unable to be translocated into the nucleus even though STAT1 and STAT2 were phosphorylated. we identified a disruptive interaction by STAT1 and KPNA1 and observed that KPNA1 was targeted for degradation during EV71 infection. VP24 of Ebola virus binds KPNA1 and blocks STAT1 nuclear accumulation (9) VP24 recognizes a unique nonclassical nuclear location signal-binding site on KPNA5. p-STAT1 inhibits the interaction of p-STAT1 and KPNA1. p-IRF3 be translocated into the nucleus in EV71-infected HT-29 cells. this is in accordance with our observation that the IFN response remains intact as well in human intestinal epithelial cells. blocking the caspase-mediated proteolysis pathway, but not the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, resulted in the restoration of KPNA1 levels in EV71-infected cells. caspase-3 activation is crucial in apoptosis and mediates proteolysis of host proteins. the host proteins can be structural ones, resulting in disintegration of cellular structures, or functional ones, playing important roles in signaling or host defense. caspase cascade may play a unique role in EV71 viral replication. anti-IFNAR1 antibody (ab45172; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) was used for detecting IFNAR1 protein. anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR Total RNA was prepared from cells by using TRIzol (Invitrogen) RNA was used for reverse transcription for cDNA using reverse transcriptase Moloney murine leukemia virus (RNase H) (Invitrogen) plasmids pRK5-HA and pRK5-Flag were subcloned into expression plasmids. siRNA and knockdown of caspase-3 siRNA molecules targeting caspase-3 were synthesized with sequences: siRNA-1, siRNA-2, or control siRNA. the cells were seeded in 12-well plates and grown to 70\u201380% confluence. the cells were transfected with 0.25, 0.5, or 1 g of pRK5-Flag-3C or pRK5-HA-2A. after 24 h post-transfection, the cells were incubated with 20 ng/ml of IFN- (300-02BC; PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) anti-EV71 VP1 antibody was purchased from millipore (Billerica, MA) antibodies for STAT1 (catalog no. 9172), STAT2 (catalog no. 4594), phosphorylated STAT2 (catalog no. 9171), and JAK1 (catalog no. 3344) were obtained from cell signaling technology (Danvers, MA) DMEM were inoculated into Vero cells in 96-well plates. the cells were incubated for 7 days at 37 \u00b0C before observation under a light microscope. titers were calculated by counting the wells with CPE. confocal fluorescence microscopy HeLa grown on glass coverslips were infected with EV71 for 24 h, followed by IFN- treatment for 30 min, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. the cells were premeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. siRNA were synthesized by GenePharma Inc. (Shanghai, China) the cells were transfected with siRNA-1, siRNA-2, or control siRNA with final concentration of 50 nm. the cells were infected with EV71 at an m.o.i. of 10. 24 h later. author contributions C.
