{"summary": "necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an emergency gastrointestinal disease in neonates due to mucosal or transmural necrosis of the bowel. about 7% to 13% of all very low birth weight (VLBW) infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit develop NEC. intestine immaturity, birth asphyxia, low appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (Apgar) score, intestinal ischemic change due to umbilical artery catheterization, viruses (rotavirus, coronavirus, and enterovirus), infection from coagulase-negative Staphylococcus or Clostridium difficile, and early rapid feeding are cause of NEC4-6. all transfusions were done with packed RBCs. the number of transfused patients, the frequency of transfusions per patient, Hgb level at the time of transfusion, and cases in which the NEC diagnosis was made within 48 hours were also analyzed. the incidence of IVH and PDA tended to be more frequent in the NEC group than that in the control group. but there were no significant statistical difference between the two groups. the risk for NEC increased 1.19 times (95% CI, 1.022 to 1.387; P=0.026) the frequency of RBC(t) before NEC diagnosis increased the risk for NEC 1.63 times (95% CI, 1.145 to 2.305; P=0.007) the incidence of NEC among the VLBW preterm infants is 12%. in this study, the incidence of NEC among the VLBW preterm infants was 10%. in this study, the incidence of NEC among the VLBW preterm infants was 10%. the number of transfusions was significantly different between our two groups. the risk for NEC increased 1.297 times (95% CI, 1.097 to 1.533; P=0.002) with an increase in the number of transfusions."}
