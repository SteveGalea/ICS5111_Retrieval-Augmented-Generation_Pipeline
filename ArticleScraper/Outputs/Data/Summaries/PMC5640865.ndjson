{"summary": "virus is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the family Hepeviridae. it is a major cause of acute, sporadic hepatitis in many developing countries. mortality rates range from 0.5 to 3% in young adults. zinc salts inhibit the replication of both g-1 and g-3 HEVs. zinc salts act on HEV by inhibiting the activity of viral RdRp. zinc sulfate and zinc acetate inhibited viral sense and antisense RNA levels by approximately 50% at a working concentration of 10 M. neither magnesium sulfate nor magnesium acetate had any effect. an increase in zinc salt concentration further decreased the level of viral sense and antisense RNA in a dose-dependent manner. zinc salts inhibit the activity of g-1 HEV-EGFP replicon. qRT-PCR detection of the HEV sense-strand RNA level in the samples described in panel A. value for an untreated (no salt) sample was considered to be 100%. value for the untreated (no salt) sample was considered to be 100%. untransfected and no-salt cells refer to Huh7 cells lacking g-1 HEV-EGFP and g-1 HEV-EGFP-containing Huh7 cells without any additional salt treatment. a Huh7 cell-based model of g-3 HEV replicon expressing luciferase (clone P6 HEV-Luc) was used to estimate the effect of zinc salts on the replication of g-3 HEV. an immunofluorescence assay was performed using g-1 HEV-expressing Huh7 cells to assess the effect of zinc salts on the level of viral ORF2 protein. treatment with 100 M zinc sulfate and zinc acetate for 24 or 48 h showed a clear reduction in ORF2 signal without any cytotoxic effect. quantification of the number of ORF2-positive cells in 12 random fields revealed a significant reduction in ORF2 levels in cells treated with zinc salts. treatment represents cells transfected with the transfection reagent only (without RNA) untransfected and no-salt cells represent Huh7 cells lacking the g-1 HEV genome and g-1 HEV genome-containing Huh7 cells without additional salt treatment. at 24 and 48 h posttreatment, total RNA was isolated from the cells. qRT-PCR measured viral sense, antisense, and host gly. maximum viral RNA was detected between 12 and 14 days postinfection. between 8 and 14 days postinfection, ORF4-Huh7 cells harbored approximately 10-fold more viral RNA than Huh7 cells. g-1 HEV clinical isolate-infected ORF4-Huh7 cells were treated for 24 and 48 h with increasing concentrations of different salts. the culture medium, precipitation of the virus particles using PEG 6000, isolation of RNA, and quantification of viral genome copies.

HEV sense RNA values were normalized to the value of GAPDH. the value for the untreated (no salt) sample was considered to be 100%. the value for the untreated (no salt) sample was considered to be 100%. dsRNA was incubated with the template RNA in the presence of different salts. 0.1 M zinc sulfate or zinc acetate inhibited its activity. ribavirin treatment is known to inhibit HEV replication. ribavirin and cotreatment of 100 M Zn sulfate and 50 M ribavirin significantly increased inhibition efficiency compared to that observed with 100 M Zn sulfate or 50 M ribavirin treatment alone. ribavirin inhibited viral sense and antisense RNA levels by approximately 50% at a working concentration of 10 M. zinc salts have been reported to inhibit cellular translation in a neuronal cell line. a toxic dose of zinc sulfate and zinc acetate in Huh7 cells was measured. a toxic dose of zinc sulfate and zinc acetate was ruled out. zinc acetate treatment significantly decreased EGFP fluorescence at 24- and 48-h time points. qRT-PCR detection of the HEV antisense-strand RNA level in the samples described in panel A. values were normalized to the level of GAPDH and are represented as means SEM of triplicate samples. untransfected and no-salt cells refer to Huh7 cells lacking g-1 HEV-EGFP and g-1 HEV-EGFP-containing Huh7 cells without any additional salt treatment. a Huh7 cell-based model of g-3 HEV replicon expressing luciferase was used to estimate the effect of zinc salts on the replication of g-3 HEV. treatment with 100 M zinc sulfate and zinc acetate for 24 or 48 h showed a clear reduction in ORF2 signal without any cytotoxic effect. quantification of the number of ORF2-positive cells in 12 random fields revealed a significant reduction in ORF2 levels in cells treated with zinc salts. untransfected and no-salt cells represent Huh7 cells lacking the g-1 HEV genome and g-1 HEV genome-containing Huh7 cells without any additional salt treatment. the percentage of green fluorescent cells with reference to blue fluorescent cells is shown. PCR measurement of viral sense, antisense, and host glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) levels are represented as means SEM of triplicate samples. the value for the untreated (no salt) sample was considered to be 100%. maximum viral RNA was detected between 12 and 14 days postinfection. between 8 and 14 days postinfection, ORF4-Huh7 cells harbored approximately 10-fold more viral RNA than Huh7 cells. qRT-PCR analysis of viral sense and antisense RNA levels in ORF4-Huh7 cells revealed a significant reduction in their levels in presence of zinc sulfate and zinc acetate. qRT-PCR detection of the HEV sense-strand RNA level in cells infected with a g-1 HEV clinical isolate. total RNA was isolated at different days postinfection, followed by estimation of HEV sense and GAPDH RNA levels. ratios of HEV sense/GAPDH values are represented as means SEM. qRT-PCR detection of the HEV antisense-strand RNA level in ORF4-Huh7 cells infected with a g-1 HEV clinical isolate treated with different salts. no amplification was observed in samples treated with 100 M Zn acetate (denoted by *) zinc salts act by inhibiting the activity of HEV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. -PCR was actually recovered from internalized virus rather than virus attached to the extracellular surface. ORF2 was equally detected in all samples, irrespective of the presence or absence of different salts. zinc salts act by inhibiting the activity of HEV RNA-dependent polymerase. values are means SEM of triplicate samples. different salts were added to the reaction mixture containing RdRp protein and template RNA. different salts were added to the reaction mixture containing RdRp protein. zinc sulfate or magnesium acetate at 10 M inhibited its activity. 0.1 M zinc sulfate or zinc acetate could significantly inhibit viral RdRp activity. ribavirin treatment is known to inhibit HEV replication. zinc salts such as zinc sulfate and zinc acetate inhibit HEV replication. the therapeutic index of Zn sulfate and ribavirin was found to be approximately 45 and 50, respectively. zinc deficiency affects both innate and adaptive immune systems. zinc is reported to potentiate the antiviral action of human alpha interferon (IFN-), alleviate the symptoms of rhinovirus-induced colds. topical zinc treatment has been used to control HSV infection. zinc supplementation may not proportionately increase the bioavailability of zinc in all individuals. the net bioavailable quantity of zinc will be dependent on the level of zinc available before the onset of zinc supplementation. pSK-HEV2 (GenBank accession no.
