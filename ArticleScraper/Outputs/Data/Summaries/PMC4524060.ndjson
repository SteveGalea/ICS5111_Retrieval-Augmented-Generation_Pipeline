RESULTS Serotonin receptor agonist 5-nonyloxytryptamine impairs reovirus-induced cell death. 5-HT receptors are expressed in HeLa cells and U-2 OS cells. 5-HT receptors are expressed in HeLa cells and U-2 OS cells. mRNA was detected for all 5-HTRs tested except for 5-HTR2B and 5-HTR7. engagement of 5-HTRs regulates reovirus infectivity. to determine whether small molecules that agonize or antagonize 5-HTRs affect reovirus infectivity, CCL2 HeLa cells were incubated with DMSO, increasing concentrations of 5-NT or 5-HTR antagonist methiothepin mesylate (MM), or 4 M E64-d for 1 h, adsorbed with reovirus. 5-NT impairs reovirus infection at early times of infection. CCL2 HeLa cells were treated with DMSO, 4 M E64-d, or 10 M 5-NT at 15-min intervals beginning 60 min prior to adsorption. addition of 5-NT 60 min after adsorption resulted in negligible inhibition. or 10 M 5-NT at 15-min intervals prior to adsorption (15 to 60) or 60 min after adsorption (+60) results are expressed as percent infectivity (MFI compared to the DMSO value, normalized to background fluorescence) for quadruplicate samples. treatment of cells with higher concentrations of 5-NT or 4 M E64-d decreased infection by virions. 5-NT impairs reovirus infection at a point in the replication cycle after attachment to cells but before formation of ISVPs. reovirus attachment and internalization are not affected by 5-NT. cells were stained with reovirus-specific antiserum at times shown (A) results are expressed as MFI for JAM-A expression (A), reovirus binding (B) and as a ratio of extracellular virus to total virus (C) for triplicate samples. 5-NT impairs reovirus transport to acidified endosomes. reovirus must be delivered to acidified endosomes to efficiently infect cells. 5-NT impairs reovirus transport to acidified endocytic organelles. reovirus disassembly is characterized by cathepsin-mediated proteolysis of the virion, yielding the fragment of viral capsid protein 1 (23\u201325) in 5-NT-treated cells, the appearance of the fragment was delayed, with significant levels not detected until 2 h after adsorption. outer capsid protein is removed from incoming virions by cathepsin-mediated proteolysis. virions, which contain intact 3, are recognized by the 3-specific antibody and appear yellow. at 0 min, virions comprise less than 57% of particles detected. a single section from a Z-stack is shown. bars, 10 m. (B) Quantification of spectral overlap of virions (yellow) and ISVPs (red) data are expressed as the percentage of virions within a cell. the horizontal lines depict the means for cells at that time point. internalization of CTB and Tfn was assessed by flow cytometry. results are expressed as MFI of internalized CTB or Tfn. treatment of cells with 5-NT did not alter internalization of either CTB or Tfn. in 5-NT-treated cells, few EEA1-positive endosomes were observed at 0 min. by 30 min, abundant EEA1-positive endosomes were detected. 5-NT impairs reovirus infectivity by temporarily dispersing EEA1-positive early endosomes. 5-NT treatment impaired infection of both CHIKV and MHV. infection by CHIKV and MHV was impaired at lower 5-NT concentrations than those required to impair reovirus. infection was quantified by indirect immunofluorescence. results are expressed as percent infected cells normalized to the DMSO value for triplicate experiments. treatment of cells with either DMSO, 0.1 M 5-NT, or 1 M 5-NT had no detectable effect on reovirus-mediated cell death. cells treated with 5 M or 10 M 5-NT significantly impaired virus-induced cytotoxicity. these data corroborate the screening results and show that 5-NT impairs reovirus-mediated cell killing. mRNA was detected for all 5-HTRs tested except for 5-HTR2B and 5-HTR7. 5-HTR6 was detected in CCL2 HeLa cells and U-2 OS cells. RNA was extracted from CCL2 HeLa cells, HeLa S3 cells, and U-2 OS cells. CCL2 HeLa cells were incubated with DMSO, increasing concentrations of 5-NT, or 4 M E64-d for 1 h, adsorbed with reovirus T3SA+ at an MOI of 5 PFU/cell, and incubated in the presence of compounds for 20 h. cells were scored for infection by indirect immunofluorescence. 5-NT was added to cells 60 min prior to adsorption (60% decrease), with gradual loss of inhibition. addition of 5-NT 60 min after adsorption resulted in negligible inhibition (5% decrease) these data suggest that 5-NT must be added to cells for at least 60 min prior to adsorption to substantially impair reovirus infection. reovirus ISVPs can be generated in vitro by protease treatment of virions (23, 24), bind to JAM-A and enter cells at or near the cell surface. reovirus ISVPs can be generated in vitro by protease treatment of virions (23, 24) 5-NT treatment did not significantly diminish the cell surface expression of JAM-A during the interval tested. these data indicate that 5-NT does not compromise reovirus attachment to target cells. treatment with 5-NT delays reovirus access to acidic compartments. extracellular virus was detected by staining cells with reovirus-specific antiserum. 5-NT impairs reovirus disassembly kinetics. 5-NT impairs reovirus transport to the acidified endocytic compartments. the stronger block to reovirus acidification observed with 20 mM NH4Cl parallels the greater impairment of reovirus infection observed following NH4Cl treatment. reovirus disassembly is characterized by cathepsin-mediated proteolysis of the virion. the positions of viral proteins are labeled to the left of the gel. values are means plus standard errors of the means (error bars) virions, which contain intact 3, are recognized by the 3-specific antibody. 5-NT treatment alters transport of internalized reovirus virions to acidified endosomes. the cells were stained for reovirus outer capsid protein 3 (green) and imaged by confocal microscopy. 5-NT does not affect the cytoskeleton or internalization of cholera toxin B or transferrin. treatment with 5-NT does not alter cytoskeletal protein organization or decrease internalization of cholera toxin B or transferrin. treatment of cells with 5-NT did not alter internalization of either CTB or Tfn. 5-NT does not inhibit the internalization of cargoes that require either clathrin-dependent or clathrin-independent uptake mechanisms. reovirus endocytic transport kinetics are delayed by 5-NT. cells were stained with an antibody specific for early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1). reovirus endocytic transport kinetics are delayed by 5-NT treatment. cells were stained for early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) (green) (A) or lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) (green) (C) and nuclei (blue) (A and C) and imaged by confocal microscopy. 5-NT treatment impaired infection of both CHIKV and MHV. infection by CHIKV and MHV was impaired at lower 5-NT concentrations than those required to impair reovirus. infection was quantified by indirect immunofluorescence. 5-NT, a drug identified in a small-molecule screen for host factors required for reovirus-mediated cytotoxicity (21), has antiviral properties against reovirus and two unrelated RNA viruses, CHIKV and MHV. 5-NT impaired the establishment of reovirus infection and diminished reovirus-mediated cell killing. after reovirus infection, we did not detect significant changes in CREB activity, as assessed by a CREB-specific reporter assay or CREB phosphorylation at serine 133 in the presence or absence of 5-NT. however, forskolin, a potent CREB activator, did not affect reovirus infection despite inducing robust CREB transcriptional stimulation. these findings suggest that the effect of 5-HT on reovirus infection is not attribu 5-HTRs are internalized rapidly following ligand engagement and distribute to early endosomes (68, 69) it is possible that 5-NT-mediated signaling induces rapid uptake of 5-HTRs, which upon traversing to early endosomes, leads to the temporary dispersal of this compartment. the precise mechanism by which 5-NT disrupts early endosomes remains to be elucidated. CHIKV, MHV, and reovirus enter at least some cell types via clathrin-dependent endocytosis. reovirus requires access to late endosomes and cathepsin-mediated proteolysis. 5-NT could impair the function of endosomal components responsible for regulating endosomal pH. s. s."}
