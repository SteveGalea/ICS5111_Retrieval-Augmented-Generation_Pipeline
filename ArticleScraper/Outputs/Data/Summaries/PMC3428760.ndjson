{"summary": "nasopharyngeal aspirate oversampled children from the ICU. median age of the overall cohort was 4 months; 59% were male; 61% white, 24% black, and 36% Hispanic. bronchiolitis is one of the most common infectious respiratory conditions of early childhood. the small subgroup of children requiring continuous positive airway pressure and/or intubation remains ill-defined. data collection investigators conducted a structured interview that assessed patients\u2019 demographic characteristics, medical and environmental history, duration of symptoms, and details of the acute illness. Relevant comorbid medical disorders included review of respiratory, cardiac, neurologic, gastrointestinal, and immunologic diseases. all real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR assays were tested in duplicate. data are presented as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and medians with interquartile ranges (IQR) the number of participating sites varied over the 3 years. each month from November 1 until March 31, site investigators across 12 states used a standardized protocol to enroll a target number of consecutive patients from the inpatient ward and the ICU. emergency department (ED) and daily hospital clinical data were obtained by chart review. site investigators queried about missing data and discrepancies identified by manual data checks. Statistical analyses All analyses were performed by using Stata 11.2 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX) data are presented as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and medians with interquartile ranges. results Of the 2207 enrolled children, 379 (17%) were enrolled in the ICU. 59 (37%) required CPAP, 64 (40%) were intubated, and 38 (23%) had both CPAP and intubation. most children had nonprivate health insurance, were born term, had a birth weight of 7 pounds, were breastfed, and had no parental history of asthma. 13 Family history of asthma Neither parent 1486 67 Either mother or father 594 27 Both parents 87 4 Don't know/missing 40 2 History of infant wheezing 498 23 History of infant eczema 334 15 History of infant intubation 225 10 Major, relevant, comorbid medical disorder 460 21 Presence of apnea (chart) 153 7 Weight (lbs), median (IQR) 2152 13 (9\u201318) Temperature ( 1a 7 0.3 PIV1 17 0.8 PIV2 11 0.5 PIV3 30 1.4 RSV-A 940 43 RSV-B 664 30 Atelectasis on chest x-ray 272 12 Hyperinflated on chest x-ray 285 13 Normal chest x-ray 314 14 ABG, arterial blood gas; HMPV, human metapneumovirus; PIV, parainfluenza virus; WBC, white blood count. age in months 2 27 46.001 2\u20135.9 35 34 6\u201311.9 23 14 12 15 6 Month of birth.002 October\u2013March 60 73 April\u2013September 40 27 Gender.67 Male 59 61 Female 41 39 Race.01 White 61 64 Black 25 16 Other or missing 14 20 Hispanic 36 43.07 Insurance.65 Nonprivate 69 67 Private 31 33 Gestational age, wk.02 32 7 5 32\u201336 17 26 37 or term 76 69 Birth weight, IQR 48 (40\u201360) 50 (40\u201360).17 Retractions.001 None 22 15 Mild 43 21 Moderate 25 34 Severe 3 20 Missing 7 10 Oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter or ABG.
