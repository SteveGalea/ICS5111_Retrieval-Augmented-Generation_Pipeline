{"summary": "the disease presents clinically with recurrent fever and signs reflecting the distribution of organ lesions. the development of FIP lesions is triggered by activated, virus infected monocytes. pro-inflammatory cytokines are the main mediators of the innate immune response. IL-6 mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were found to be unaltered, only mildly increased, or variable in FIP [11,12,13], while IL-10 and IL-12 transcription was markedly depressed. in vitro transcriptome studies have not shown these classical inflammatory mediators to be significantly altered between feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) infected and uninfected cells. however, these have focused on cell culture experiments using C human and murine hepatocytes have also been shown capable of producing cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-. this led to the second hypothesis that the heart is an additional source of cytokines and thus contributes to the systemic inflammatory status that allows FIP lesions to develop. 1.1b cats had been euthanased with FIP after experimental intra-peritoneal infection with the serotype I FCoV strain FIPV-UCD at the University of Utrecht, the Netherlands. the remaining two cats were euthanased at the end of the experiment (11 weeks p.i.) six of the 16 cats with FIP had effusions, including three of the four experimental cases. group 1.2 consisted of 14 clinically healthy, male SPF cats that had been per-orally infected at an age of 8.5 to 27 weeks with previously isolated serotype I FCoV field strain. s of enteric pathotype (FCoVZu1, 2, 3, and 5 -feline enteric coronavirus; FECV) were euthanased between 2 and 12 weeks p.i. seroconverted. all cats tested positive for FCoV shedding and those euthanased more than 2 weeks p.i. seroconverted. med ln Y 2 2.1 7 m, ME, Devon Rex Peritoneum, mes ln Y 3 2.1 7 m, MN, BSH Peritoneum, lung, liver, kidney, mes ln Y 4 2.1 9 m, FN, DSH Peritoneum, liver, liver, kidney, lung, mes ln Y 6 2.1 11 m, ME, Birman Pleura, peritoneum, liver 2.1 8 m, MN, Ragdoll Kidney, liver N 17 2.1 9 m, ME, Birman Brain N 18 2.1 1 y, FN, DLH NR NR 19 2.2a 2 y, FN, DSH Oesophageal stricture 21 2.2a 3 y, FN, DSH Vertebral disc prolapse 22 2.2a 3 y, MN, DLH Lymphocytic cholangio group 2.3 comprised three cats with systemic inflammatory diseases other than FIP. all cats had been euthanased and submitted for diagnostic post mortem examination with full owner consent. mRNA levels of the housekeeping gene feline glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as internal controls. all reactions were run in duplicate, using previously published amplification conditions and assay compositions. agen RNeasy Microkit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used for RNA extraction as per manufacturer\u2019s protocol. from the final elute of 12 L of RNA, 8 L was used for cDNA synthesis using the superScript IV VILO Master Mix kit. this was followed by target specific pre-amplification using the primers described above and the TaqMan\u00ae PreAmp Master Mix (2 ) cytokine mRNA levels from cats with and without effusions were compared. cytokine mRNA levels from cats with and without effusions were compared. each disease form subgroup of FIP cats was then compared with control cats. a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against feline IL-6 (MAB23051, R&D Systems) was tested on a small set of liver samples. a mixed inflammatory cell population was present. the staining was applied to a selection of cases. incubated with antibodies blocked by the respective peptide served as negative controls. staining was graded in a semi-quantitative manner as negative, weak, moderate or strong, based on the number of positive hepatocytes and average staining intensity. 1.1b cats showed clinical signs of FIP which necessitated euthanasia of two cats at 3.5 and 4 weeks post infection. the remaining two were euthanased at the end of the experiment (11 weeks p.i.)

IL-1 and TNF- showed the greatest hepatic upregulation of the studied cytokines in association with FIP. the wet, dry, and mixed forms of FIP indicate overlapping disease states with a variable degree of vascular permeability. the degree of ascites was found to be correlated with serum VEGF levels in cats with FIP. IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokine that inhibits inflammatory cytokine transcription by monocytes, but also complements IL-6 as it can stimulate antibody production. IL-12 upregulation in the liver in association with FIP. study sheds light on the contribution of non-immune organs to systemic disease. it also provides avenues for further study into the role of these organs in other feline systemic diseases."}
