{"summary": "positive-strand RNA viruses are common causative agents of human disease, including the common cold, myocarditis, encephalitis, hepatitis, and paralytic poliomyelitis [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. these efforts have relied on the live attenuated oral poliovirus virus vaccine (OPV) and sustained in the developed world by inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) [10]. mutation in the RdRp has a statistically significant reduction in viral virulence. this is likely because the T362I RdRp is a more error-prone polymerase than the \u201cwild-type\u201d (WT) enzyme. these results are intriguing, and might suggest that the Sabin I RdRp also contributes to viral attenuation. the structure of the PV RdRp (PDB 1RA6 [33]) has fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains. the locations of the amino acid residues changed in the Sabin I polymerase are indicated in red (i.e., D53N, Y73H, K250E, and T362I) the Sabin I RdRp discriminates against nucleotides with incorrect nucleobases at the same level as wild-type (WT) enzyme. results suggest there was evolutionary pressure during the selection of the Sabin I virus to maintain an optimal level of RdRp fidelity. s/sU RNA encodes for six complimentary base pairs and a four nucleotide overhang at the 5\u2032 end. the s/sU RNA has a uracil as the first templating base in the RNA duplex. the rate and yield of competent RdRp s/sU complexes was highly similar to that of WT PV RdRp. the Sabin I RdRp contains all four amino acid substitutions (i.e., D53N, Y73H, K250E and T362I) and Sabin () RdRp contains all four amino acid substitutions. the reaction buffer was mixed with 500 M ATP and then quenched after 30 s by the addition of 25 mM EDTA. d,app values for correct nucleotide incorporation as WT RdRp. the correct nucleotide was ATP in this case, since it is templated against U. the correct nucleotide was ATP in this case, since it is templated against U. RNA was 32P labeled on 5\u2032-end; and (E) kinetic data for GMP incorporation are plotted in black, blue, and red. the lines represent data fit to a hyperbola function to yield Kd,app and kpol values. 9.3 103 70 170 Y73H 7.3 0.1 10-1 117 5 6.2 103 60 190 K250E 1.4 0.0 174 6 8.0 103 50 160 T362I 1.5 0.0 112 4 1.3 102 40 150 D53N/Y73H/T362I 1.5 0.0 132 6 1.1 102 50 150 D53N/Y73H/T362I 1.5 0.0 132 6 1.1 102 50 150 D53N/Y73 the fidelity of nucleotide incorporation can be expressed as (kpol/Kd,app)correct and (kpol/Kd,app)incorrect are the second-order rate constants for correct (i.e., ATP) and incorrect nucleotide (i.e., kpol/Kd,app)incorrect. fidelity of nucleotide incorporation can be expressed according to the kinetic experiments. we attempted to encode recombinant PV (in Mahoney background) with the four substitutions occurring in the Sabin I polymerase. this variant was not genetically stable and virus recovered from HeLa cells only retained the corresponding D53N/Y73H/T362I mutations. however, there was a possibility that the triple variant D53N/Y73H/T362I could be used in place of the Sabin variant for further biological characterization. the nucleobase selectivities for the D53N, Y73H, and K250E variants were lower than, higher than, and similar to that of WT RdRp. the changes induced by the four single-substituted variants do not readily explain the kinetic results. together the thermodynamic effects of the four single amino acid substitutions would predict a more catalytically-efficient Sabin enzyme (i.e., G is negative) for AMP and GMP incorporation, but less catalytically efficient for 2\u2032-dAMP incorporation (i.e., GD53N + GY73H + GK250E + GT362I) the G values for the multi-variants are also compared using thermodynamics cycles when (B) ATP, (C) 2\u2032-dATP, and (D) GTP are the incoming nucleotides (templated against U); all values are reported as kcal/mol. the results with the Sabin RdRp suggested that there were small allosteric effects between these amino acid substitutions. additive for AMP, 2\u2032-dAMP, and GMP incorporation. the double variant D53N/T362I had similar G values for AMP and GMP incorporation as the Sabin variant. the effects of the D53N, Y73H, and T362I substitutions appeared additive. the Y73H substitution induced an increase in the relative rates of nucleotide misincorporation when comparing the D53N/T362I and D53N/Y73H/T362I variants. the relative rate of the Sabin variant for misincorporation of nucleotide with incorrect sugar is near that of the T362I variant. the correct nucleotide is considered to be UTP as it will basepair to A. we have suggested that the peak position(s) of Met354 in motif D reports on whether motif D is in an open or closed conformation. the ternary complexes bound with UTP and 2\u2019-dUTP yield different [methyl-13C] Met NMR spectra. with 250 M RdRp, 1000 M s/s RNA, and 4 mM UTP or 8 mM 2\u2032-dUTP. the ternary complexes bound with UTP yielded [methyl-13C] Met spectra very similar to that of WT enzyme. the Sabin I RdRp more readily incorporates 2\u2032-dAMP than WT RdRp. this result may suggest that Sabin I RdRp is more susceptible to incorporating 2\u2032-C-methylAMP than WT enzyme. the s/sU RNA has a uracil as the first templating base in the RNA duplex. the rate and yield of competent RdRp complexes for the Sabin I RdRp was highly similar to that of WT PV RdRp (Figure 2). s/sU RNA is 32P-labeled on the 5\u2032 end for association and dissociation assays. RNA (0.5 M duplex) and 500 M ATP (i.e., which will template against U) were pre-incubated for 5 min at 30 \u00b0C before the addition of 1 M RdRp. the RdRp-RNA dissociation rate constants for the RdRp variants are not substantially different from the WT enzyme. we have previously investigated the nucleobase and sugar selectivity of the T362I variant using single nucleotide incorporation assays. the results for WT, T362I, and Sabin RdRp are shown in black, blue, and red respectively. the lines represent data fit to a hyperbola function to give an apparent dissociation constant (Kd,app) and a maximum rate constant for nucleotide incorporation (kpol); the experimental design for the single nucleotide incorporation assay using GTP.

Met6 packs against Phe59, which is located on the small -helix that is N-capped by Asp53. there was no evidence for two Met354 resonances in the D53N/Y73H/T362I ternary complex bound with 2\u2032-dUTP. this suggests that the Sabin 2\u2019-dUTP ternary complex populates the closed conformation. attenuated vaccine has been a major component of the global efforts to eradicate poliovirus. it has been previously suggested that changes in the IRES are the major factor contributing to the attenuation of the virus. other mutations in the vaccine strains may also contribute to viral attenuation and efficacy of the vaccine [15,16,17,18,19,20,22]. change from a positively-charged residue (i.e., Lys) to a negatively-charged residue (i.e., Glu) at position 250 may disrupt interactions between 3CD and the 5\u2032UTR. lack of selective pressure to maintain WT-levels of sugar discrimination may have allowed the Sabin I RdRp to drift towards a lower sugar selectivity, even lower than that of the T362I variant. we have shown that Sabin I RdRp more readily incorporated nucleotides with modified sugar groups. these results suggest that Sabin I may be more sensitive to 2\u2019-modified nucleotide analogs, which have been used to treat Hepatitis C. all RNA oligonucleotides were from Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Boulder, CO, USA). T4 polynucleotide kinase was from New England Biolabs, Inc (Ipswich, MA, USA) 4.3. overexpression and protein purification were conducted by following the procedure previously described [30,50,51,52]. Briefly, the reaction contained 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mM MgCl2 and 60 M ZnCl2. stopped flow experiments and the benchtop assays for nucleotide incorporation were conducted as described previously [22,29,34]. 1H, 13C HSQC NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm \u201cinverse detection\u201d triple-resonance (1H, 13C, 15N) single axis gradient TCI probe at 293 K.
