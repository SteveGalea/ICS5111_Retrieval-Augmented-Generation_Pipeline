{"summary": "results Challenging RNA Test Set was developed using a test set of 16 nonpseudoknotted and pseudoknot-containing RNAs. these RNAs included (i) 5 RNAs with lengths >300 nt, both with and without pseudoknots; (ii) 5 riboswitch RNAs whose structures form only upon binding by specific ligands, for which thermodynamic rules are obligatorily incomplete. pseudoknots allowed and no SHAPE data, and pseudoknots allowed and with SHAPE data (both using ShapeKnots) a checkmark indicates that pseudoknots were predicted correctly and that there were no false-positive pseudoknot predictions. the most widely used models are complex and include a large number of constituent parameters (11, 12). we modeled RNA pseudoknots as the sum of simple distance features or beads. there are exactly three possibilities for the structures that compose a pseudoknot. the model for the entropic cost of pseudoknot formation, G\u00b0PK, has two adjustable parameters, P1 and P2, where n is the penalty constant for in-line helices of length n. the first term penalizes formation of pseudoknots with long single-stranded regions and many nested helices. the second term enforces an optimal geometry for in-line helices. unreactive nucleotides (SHAPE reactivities 0.4) are colored black, moderately reactive nucleotides (0.4\u20130.85) are yellow, and highly reactive nucleotides (>0.85) are red. base pairs are shown as arcs, colored by whether they are predicted correctly. m and b were optimized using the seven RNAs in our training dataset that do not contain pseudoknots. m and b were optimized using a leave-one-out jackknife approach (22) to assess prediction sensitivities. we used ShapeKnots to model secondary structures for six RNAs that were not used to optimize the final algorithm. three RNAs\u2014the fluoride riboswitch, tRNAPhe, and the 5\u2032 pseudoknot leader of the HIV-1 RNA genome\u2014adopt structures that are predicted poorly by conventional approaches. the structures of the 16 RNAs in the test set are predicted poorly by a conventional algorithm based on their sequences alone. the average sensitivity (sens, fraction of base pairs in the accepted structure predicted correctly), positive predictive value (ppv) and geometric average (geo) are shown for four test cases. the ribosomal RNAs were omitted from the sensitivity and ppv calculations. for the E. coli 16 rRNA, this included nucleotides 143\u2013220. however, the pseudoknot was proved independently (23) and is included. modeled RNA pseudoknots as sum of simple distance features or beads. single-stranded nucleotides, nested helices, and in-line helices are counted as a single helix. n is the penalty constant for in-line helices of length n. entropic penalties for single-stranded nucleotides and nested helices are based on a previously developed model. RNA structure interrogation by SHAPE. most RNAs were transcribed in vitro and contained short hairpin-containing structure cassettes at their 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends (20) shapeKnots structure prediction for the SAM I riboswitch. SHAPE data are shown as colored nucleotide letters on a black, yellow, and red scale for low, medium, and high SHAPE reactivities. we used a leave-one-out jackknife approach (22) to assess prediction sensitivities, ppv, and the geometric mean of these parameters at each grid point for seven quasi-independent data sets. a two-stage refinement first finds stable helices, using a dynamic programming algorithm that does not allow pseudoknots. three RNAs were chosen because prior approaches using nonstandard data analysis suggested that they folded poorly with SHAPE data. other three RNAs\u2014the fluoride riboswitch pseudoknot, the 5\u2032 domain of the H. volcanii 16S rRNA, and the 5\u2032 pseudoknot leader of the HIV-1 RNA genome\u2014adopt structures that are predicted poorly by conventional approaches. shapeKnots is the only algorithm to achieve >90% overall and pseudoknot-specific sensitivities with this test set. RNAs with high likelihood of being mischaracterized with false-positive or missed pseudoknots that ShapeKnots predicts accurately. RNAs that interact with molecules such as ligands, proteins, and metal ions pose unique challenges. the first class includes small RNAs that contain H-type pseudoknots. the pre-Q1 riboswitch, human telomerase, the fluoride riboswitch, and a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus domain are predicted with sensitivities of 73% and 39%. RNAs with Difficult to Predict Pseudoknots are often possible in the hepatitis C virus domain (Fig. 5, Upper Left, arrow linking purple and red helices) the experimental SHAPE correction correctly reranked the stabilities for the two possible helices located close to one another. a large part of each structure was mispredicted relative to the accepted structure. the differences in conditions could cause the crystallographic structure to be different from that in solution or there may be structural inhomogenity in solution. shapeKnots algorithm recovered 93% of accepted base pairs in well-folded RNAs. RNAs with nontrivial structures are known at a high level of confidence. RNAs that have been solved by crystallography have features that make them simultaneously more difficult to predict than more typical structures. solutions may not represent the solution conformation of the purified RNAs. the approaches outlined in this work represent a critical departure point for future accurate RNA secondary structure modeling. the first class includes small RNAs that contain H-type pseudoknots. large RNAs pose a challenge to modeling algorithms due to the vast number of possible structures. in the absence of experimental structure probing data, two representative RNAs, the Azoarcus group I intron and the hepatitis C virus internal ribosome entry sequence (IRES) domain, are predicted with sensitivities of 73% and 39%. shapeKnots avoids false-positive and false-negative pseudoknot predictions. left and right columns show results of ShapeKnots predictions without and with SHAPE data. Arrows emphasize the replacement of an accepted (red) helix with an incorrect (purple) helix in the absence of data. RNAs undergo large conformational changes upon binding by Mg2+ or F\u2013 ions. binding of ligands to pre-Q1, TPP, cyclic-di-GMP, SAM, and adenine riboswitches provides a large fraction of the total interactions that ultimately stabilize the accepted structure (7). the ShapeKnots energy penalty and search algorithm may require adjustment as new pseudoknot topologies are discovered. the structures inferred from high-resolution data may not represent the solution conformation of the purified RNAs. all SHAPE data used in this work are available at www.chem.unc.edu/rna.
