{"summary": "the sacrifice, via programmed cell death, of infected cells represents the most primordial response of multicellular organisms to viruses. this response is common to all metazoan phyla, including plants (which lack an immune system based on mobile cells) microbial invasion does not only trigger PCD of infected cells but also elicits an immune reaction. this is hierarchically organized in a first-line response provided by innate immune effectors. morphological appearance of apoptosis is accounted for by an ensemble of biochemical events that include, but are not limited to: loss of the structural integrity and bioenergetic functions of mitochondria. extrinsic and intrinsic pathways are controlled by mitochondria, which collect and integrate pro- and antiapoptotic signals incoming from other organelles. reactive-oxygen species (ROS) and calcium (Ca2+) overload are able to activate the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis by favoring mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP) in some cells, mitochondrial apoptosis may ensue the activation of death receptors due to the MMP-promoting activity of the BH3-only protein Bid. mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) proteins include caspase activators like cytochrome c (Cyt c) [S13,S14] and Smac/DIABLO [S15], as well as caspase-independent death effectors such as apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) [S16,S17] and endonuclease G (EndoG] [S18]. apoptosis-associated drastic increase in OM permeability may originate at the OM itself by means of multiple mechanisms, including the assembly of large homo- or hetero-multimeric channels. apoptosis-associated drastic increase in OM permeability may originate at the OM itself by means of multiple mechanisms, including the assembly of large homo- or hetero-multimeric channels. the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) at the IM is mediated by an event taking place mainly at the IM, i.e., MPT. in this latter case, MMP begins and ends at the OM. the presence of the BH3 domain was found to suffice for apoptosis induction by Bax (as well as for heterodimerization with Bcl-2/Bcl-XL) numerous reports showed that the conserved transmembrane domain and less conserved, unstructured loops between BH domains also contribute to define the functional profile of Bcl-2 proteins. thus, \u201cactivator\u201d BH3-only proteins (e.g., Bid) Bax and Bak translocate to OM in the form of an active dimer. the release of specific IMS proteins occurs via large pores in the OM. in some cases, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MOMP) occurs without discernable m alterations. antiapoptotic proteins from the Bcl-2 family play a role in both models. BH3-only proteins Puma and Noxa are activated by DNA damage via p53-dependent transactivation [16;S85], Bim and Bmf are released from cytoskeletal structures upon c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated phosphorylation [S86\u2013S88], and Bid is proteolytically processed by caspas tBid-cardiolipin interaction requires three -helical domains (4-6) of tBid. cardiolipin may also be implicated in the dissociation of Bid fragments (tBid and nBid) but extra-mitochondrial activities contribute to their effects. PTPC activation provokes a sudden increase in the IM permeability to solutes of low molecular weight (i.e., MPT), which leads to the unregulated entry of water and osmotic swelling of the mitochondrial matrix. this may result in the physical rupture of the OM, because the surface area of the IM (with its folded cristae) largely exceeds that of the OM. the PTPC would ensure the normal exchange of metabolites between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytosol. a state of high conductance would be favored, resulting in long-lasting openings of the PTPC and MPT [12;S59], whereas cell death would result from a closed conformation, favoring a transient hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial matrix. ANT and ANT directly interact to form a channel with distinct electrophysiological properties compared to the channels formed by Bax or ANT alone [22;S110], thus pointing to a direct interaction between ANT and Bcl-2. in this system the Bax-mediated inhibition of ANT translocase activity could be separated from the formation of cooperative channels by Bax and ANT [S111] a number of viral polypeptides modulate apoptosis, either by favoring or inhibiting MMP. some viral proteins exhibit mixed apoptosis-modulatory functions. some viral proteins exhibit mixed apoptosis-modulatory functions. ovirus; EBNA, Epstein\u2013Barr nuclear antigen; EBV, Epstein\u2013Barr virus; Env, envelope glycoprotein complex; FMDV, foot-and-mouth disease virus; FPV, fowlpox virus; HHV-8, human herpesvirus 8; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus 1; HPN, herpesvirus pan; HPO, herpesvirus papio; HPV, human papilloma Target Effects Reference Direct inducers of MMP AEV 2C CEB and Cos-7 cells Induction of the caspase cascade leading to apoptosis [S154] VP3 Different cell lines Induction of the caspase cascade leading to apoptosis [S153] BLV G4 HeLa and yeast cells Alterations of mitochondrial morphology; interacts with FPPS [S140] HBV HBx Hepatocytes VDAC m loss and E1A E4orf6 Epithelial cells Inhibition of PP2A, PARP hyperactivation, AIF translocation; sensitization to TNF and Fas; BH3-only protein expression [41;S183,S187] EBV BALF1 Lymphoid cells Antagonism of BHRF1(\") [67] FMDV Unknown Thyroid cells Kidney cells Dendritic cells Reduction in endogenous levels of Bcl-2, activ E7 Epithelial cells Sensitization of cells to apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal, chemotherapeutic agents and UV rays [S194\u2013S196] PLV 2Apro 3Cpro HeLa cells Caspase-dependent apoptosis [S172,S173] SARS-CoV 7a Various cell lines Inhibition of Bcl-XL [46] VSV M Vero cells Reduction of Bcl HTLV-1, human papillomavirus 1; IAV, influenza A virus; IMS, mitochondrial intermembrane space; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MMP, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization; MTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; NF-kB, nuclear factor-kappa B; NS; non structural protein; ORF, open reading frame; P, phosphoprotein P; PARP vMIA epithelial cells block apoptosis by death receptors, c-myc, granzyme B, DNA damage, infection, radio- and chemotherapy [65],[67] BHRF1 Lymphoid cells block apoptosis by death receptors, c-myc, granzyme B, DNA damage, infection, radio- and chemotherapy [63],[67] BHRF1 Lymphoid cells block apoptos PPVO ORFV125 Skin cells Inhibits Bak/Bax activation; blocks UV-induced apoptosis [64] VACV F1L Skin cells Interacts with Bak and Bim. inhibits multiple proapoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins (e.g., Bid, Bax, Bak, Bad) patocytes inhibition of TRAIL-induced apoptosis [82] NS5A Hepatocytes Inhibition of MMP and apoptosis induced by CIDE-B [81] NS5A Hepatocytes Activation of NF-kB, interaction with FKBP38 [S284,S285] HHV-8 K13 Lymphoid cells Antiapoptotic function by interaction with HAX-1 [S286 myxoma virus NF-kB, nuclear factor-kappa B; HPN, herpesvirus pan; ORF, open reading frame; PBR, peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor; PPVO, parapoxvirus ORF virus; RID, receptor internalization and degradation complex; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; UV, ultraviolet; VACV, vaccinia virus; vIAP, viral inhibitor of apoptosis protein; vMAP Vpr-derived peptide (Vpr52\u201396) induced large amplitude swelling in less than 15 minutes. this effect could be prevented by Bcl-2 as well as by pharmacological agents targeting ANT (such as bongrekic acid [BA]) or VDAC (such as 4,4\u2032-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2\u2032-disulfonic acid [DIDS]) [24] the cytotoxic domain of Vpr that binds to ANT (aa 67\u201382) is structured as an amphipathic -helix. this hybrid peptide is highly efficient in killing human endothelial cells. it binds to the cell surface, internalizes, and finally interacts with mitochondrial membranes to trigger MMP. HBx localization to mitochondria and m dissipation do not depend on its transactivation domain [S125,S126], but require a putative TM region (aa 54\u201370) of the protein. two additional amphipathic helical domains (aa 75\u201388 and 109\u2013131) provide only marginal contributions. ultrastructural and functional impairment of mitochondria and VDAC3 overexpression have been associated with chronic liver disease. p13(II) is an 87-aa protein that is targeted to mitochondria. it promotes a rapid flux of K+ and Ca2+ across IM. p13(II) expression has been shown to enhance caspase-dependent Fas- and C2 ceramide-induced apoptosis. PB1-F2 is an 87-aa protein encoded by influenza A virus. PB1-F2 inserts into mitochondrial membranes via a positively charged amphipathic -helix. the domain necessary and sufficient for mitochondrial targeting has been mapped to residues 46 to 75 of PB1-F2 [S148] mitochondrial proteins interacting with PB1-F2 are the isoform 1 of VDAC (VDAC1) and the isoform 3 of ANT (ANT3) [S149] PB1-F2 is capable of destabilizing lipid bilayers in the electric field. PTPC blockers such as BA and CsA prevent PB1-F2-induced MMP and apoptosis. structural protein VP3 and non structural protein 2C encoded by avian encephalomyelitis virus promote cell death. VP3 localizes to mitochondria and sets off caspase cascade leading to apoptosis. in different cell lines, VP3 localizes to mitochondria. the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein complex (Env, constituted by gp140 and gp41) is expressed by infected cells. it promotes cell-to-cell fusion by interacting with its receptor/co-receptor complex (CD4/CXCR4 or CD4/CCR5) on the surface of uninfected cells. cytotoxicity relies (at least partially) on the proapoptotic activity of the BH3-only protein Bim. in healthy cells, Bim is inactivated through its association with the microtubule-associated dynein motor complex, and Tat liberates Bim from this inhibition. contradictory reports suggest that Tat might influence mitochondrial apoptosis through other mechanisms. additional viral proteases have been implicated in the induction of apoptosis. the HCV non structural protein 3 (NS3) participates in a protease complex [S170], and has been reported to induce caspase-8-mediated apoptosis independently from its enzymatic activity [S171]. Upon expression either as single proteins or in combination, PLV proteases 2A (2Apro) and 3C (3Cpro) activate caspase-dependent PP2A inhibition prolongs the signal of DNA damage emanating from phosphorylated histone H2AX (H2AX) thereby leading to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PP2A) hyperactivation. PP2A inhibition would also favor the phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of Bcl-2. the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) belongs to the family of rhabdoviruses. it is associated with the development of neurological disorders characterized by enhanced neuronal apoptosis [S197,S198] the west Nile virus (WNV)-dependent encephalitis has been associated with the activation of caspase-9 and -3. this would contribute to neuronal apoptosis and local inflammation. this would result from the proteolytic activity of the complex constituted by WNV non structural proteins 2B and 3 (NS2B/NS3). aa 52\u201396 of Vpr directly interacts with ANT and VDAC. a synthetic Vpr-derived peptide (Vpr52\u201396) induced large amplitude swelling in less than 15 minutes. this effect could be prevented by Bcl-2 as well as by pharmacological agents targeting ANT. Vpr has been reported to modulate viral replication independently from its proapoptotic function, presumably via an interaction with host proteins other than ANT [S117] the minimal cytotoxic domain of Vpr that binds to ANT is structured as an amphipathic -helix [24] HBx localizes to mitochondria and m dissipation, coupled to a perinuclear redistribution of mitochondria. HBx binds to the heat shock protein of 60 kDa (HSP60), a mitochondrial matrix chaperon. orfC is a basic protein of 120 aa that localizes to mitochondria. regressing tumors express OrfC at high levels. p13(II) N-terminus includes a short hydrophobic leader peptide. the bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is an HTLV-1 homolog causing lymphoproliferative disorders in multiple species [S139] p13(II) expression has been shown to enhance caspase-dependent apoptosis and suppress the proliferative and tumorigenic potential of cells transformed by the myc and ras oncogenes. the domain necessary and sufficient for mitochondrial targeting has been mapped to residues 46 to 75 of PB1-F2 [S148] this region comprises a short hydrophobic region including several basic residues followed by an amphipathic -helix. PB1-F2 is capable of destabilizing lipid bilayers in the electric field. keratinocytes (the natural host for HPV infection) bind to cytokeratins, thereby inducing the total collapse of the keratin (but not of tubulin and actin) cytoskeleton. the structural protein VP3 and the non structural protein 2C encoded by the avian encephalomyelitis virus promote cell death [S153,S154] indirect MMP Facilitators Multiple proteins encoded by the HIV-1 genome initiate mitochondrial apoptosis in an indirect fashion. thus, Nef stimulates lysosomal membrane permeabilization resulting in the release of cathepsin D from the lysosomal lumen into the cytosol. this triggers the activation of Bax (but not that of Bak) and MMP-dependent cell death. recombinant Tat protein added to cultured cells fails to localize at mitochondria. it primarily accumulates in the endosomal compartment, presumably due to its uptake via the endocytic pathway. cytotoxicity relies (at least partially) on the proapoptotic activity of the BH3-only protein Bim. high levels of Bcl-2 protect cells in vitro and in vivo from the viral protease and prevent apoptosis induced by HIV-1 infection of human lymphocytes. additional viral proteases have been implicated in the induction of apoptosis. E1A was the first viral protein found to promote apoptosis [37]\u2013[39] via both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms. a prominent role for BH3-only proteins (and in particular for Bik) has been reported in ADV-induced apoptosis [40;S187] PP2A inhibition would also favor the phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of Bcl-2. E6 and E7 sensitize cells to different apoptotic stimuli [S191\u2013S193], via mechanisms that may depend [S191,S193] or not [S192] on p53. wild-type and mutant M isoforms exhibit relevant oncolytic properties in vitro and in vivo. other viruses have been described to induce apoptosis by hijacking host machinery that regulates cell death rather than via direct mitochondrial effects. the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) capsid protein VP1 induces apoptosis of dendritic cells by an integrin receptor-mediated pathway that activates MMP also via a reduction in the end viruses have developed a battery of Bcl-2 homologs by which they mimic the major antiapoptotic system of host cells. in some instances, such vBcl-2s fail to show significant sequence similarity with their mammalian counterparts. a number of viral factors inhibit apoptosis via other mechanisms, which do not directly involve the Bcl-2 system. gene UL37 (pUL37x1), known as viral mitochondria-localized inhibitor of apoptosis (vMIA), has been shown to inhibit apoptosis triggered by different stimuli. vMIA, which is required for viral replication, has been shown to inhibit apoptosis triggered by different stimuli. vMIA exerts its antiapoptotic activity predominantly by inhibiting MMP at the level of mitochondria. an N-terminal MTS is necessary and sufficient for vMIA mitochondrial localization, but not for its antiapoptotic activity. vMIA exerts its antiapoptotic functions solely by neutralizing Bax. the mitochondrial inorganic phosphate carrier (PiC), thus reducing mitochondrial ATP generation, induces the release of ER Ca2+ stores into the cytosol [S231] poxviruses cause several diseases of humans and domestic animals, including smallpox, cowpox, sheeppox, fowlpox, and goatpox. the region of F1L involved in this interaction encompasses aa 64\u201384 and has limited sequence similarity to known BH3-binding domains. a direct interaction between F1L and Bax has never been detected, suggesting that F1L acts upstream of Bax activation. other poxviruses encode functional F1L orthologs. M11L has no obvious sequence homology with Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL. this allows M11L to associate with a peptide derived from the BH3 domain of Bak. this high level of structural homology allows M11L to associate with a peptide derived from the BH3 domain of Bak. the surface of N1L possesses a constitutively open groove common to other antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. FPV039 localizes at mitochondria and constitutively interacts with Bak. FPV039 is able to substitute for F1L in inhibiting Bak activation and apoptosis triggered by staurosporine and VACV infection. EBV is a prominent member of -herpesviruses, invading primary resting B lymphocytes to establish a latent infection that eventually culminates in cell transformation. the potent mitogenic effect of EBV is mediated by the coordinated expression of several gene products, including the apoptotic modulators BALF1 and BHRF1. BHRF1 inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis by preventing MMP downstream of the proteolytic activation of Bid [S249] BHRF1 (but not Bcl-2) overexpression has been shown to promote rapid transit though the cell cycle. herpesvirus papio BHRF1 is a 17-kDa protein that shares 64% sequence identity and 79% sequence similarity with BHRF1 from EBV. in functional assays, hpoBHRF1 and BHRF1 similarly protected human keratinocytes against cisplatin-induced apoptosis. KSBcl-2 exhibits an overall fold almost identical to that of Bcl-2/Bcl-XL. key differences exist in the lengths of helices and loops. KSBcl-2 neither homodimerizes nor heterodimerizes with other Bcl-2 family members. BH3 binding groove resulted in a correctly folded protein that failed to bind Bax BH3 peptide and to inhibit Bax toxicity in yeast. however, viruses harboring the same mutation exhibited impaired persistent replication and reactivation from latency in vivo. both proteins contain an MTS, an N-terminal region of a baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domain, and a putative BH2 domain [76]. K7 efficiently represses apoptosis induced by activation of death receptors (e.g., Fas, TNFR), Bax overexpression and thapsigargin-mediated ER stress. A179L codes for a polypeptide of 21 kDa that contains all known domains associated with Bcl-2 structural and functional features. this includes those mediating protein-binding (i.e., homo- and heterodimerization) and regulating cell death. other antiapoptotic Viral Strategies Viruses inhibit host cell apoptosis via a plethora of mechanisms other than vBcl-2s. vMIA-mediated inhibition of the ATP synthasome and stabilization of complex I by 2.7 RNA. this combined modulation should not lead to an increase in m, but to decreased mitochondrial ATP generation. EBNA leader protein (EBNA-LP) has been shown to interfere with host cell transcription and also with the apoptotic machinery. NS2 reportedly blocks Cyt c release and apoptosis induced by CIDE-B [81]. NS2 and CIDE-B exhibit partially overlapping signals in the nuclear proximity. another HCV non structural protein, NS5A, is localized at the ER of HCV-infected cells. the K15 gene contains eight alternatively spliced exons and encodes membrane proteins with a variable number of TM domains plus a common C-terminal region with putative binding sites. K15, a 45-kDa protein consisting of all eight exons, has been implicated in the regulation of host gene expression due to its ability to activate several signalling kinases. HHV-8 encodes a plethora of factors that participate in virus-associated tumorigenesis by modulating host cell intracellular signalling, proliferation, apoptosis, and immune response [S288]. Various proteins encoded by the E3 transcription unit of ADVs exert antiapoptotic and immune-modulatory functions, thereby protecting infected cells from cytotoxic T cells and lethal cytokines. the extracellular domain of RID is important for the clearance of EGFR from the cell surface, but not for internalization of death receptors like Fas [S310]. p35 inhibits apoptosis induced by multiple signals in cells from evolutionarily distant organisms such as humans [S314], mice [S315], insects [89,90;S316], nematodes [91,92;S317], and flies [S318]. vIAPs contain a carboxyl ring finger and tandem duplications of a Cys/His motif known as BIR (baculovirus IAP repeat) homologs have been identified in other viral strains (e.g., A224L from ASFV [S322] and in multiple metazoan organisms as diverse as humans [S323,S324], mice [94]; flies [95;S325,S326], nematodes vMAP interacts with VDAC1 via two leucine-rich motifs located in the central and C-terminal parts of the protein, thus suppressing Cyt c release and apoptosis. vMAP is necessary for efficient HV-68 lytic replication in normal cells (with an intact apoptotic apparatus). several Bcl-2 family proteins have been identified thanks to their interaction with E1B-19K. they share short homologous domains that can be exchanged between the two proteins without a significant loss in their antiapoptotic functions. vMIA has been shown to inhibit apoptosis triggered by different stimuli. vMIA exerts its antiapoptotic activity predominantly by inhibiting MMP at the level of mitochondria. an N-terminal MTS is necessary and sufficient for vMIA mitochondrial localization, but not for its antiapoptotic activity. vMIA exerts its antiapoptotic functions solely by neutralizing Bax. ATP synthasome induces release of ER Ca2+ stores into the cytosol [S231] poxviruses cause several diseases of humans and domestic animals, including smallpox, cowpox, sheeppox, fowlpox, and goatpox. the region of F1L involved in this interaction encompasses aa 64\u201384. it has limited sequence similarity to known BH3-binding domains. a direct interaction between F1L and Bax has never been detected. other poxviruses encode functional F1L orthologs. Bax-mediated apoptosis is blocked in MXV-infected cells lacking Bak expression. M11L has no obvious sequence homology with Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL. this high level of structural homology allows M11L to associate with a peptide derived from the BH3 domain of Bak. two novel Bcl-2-like inhibitors of apoptosis encoded by poxviruses have been discovered. FPV039 localizes at mitochondria and constitutively interacts with Bak. FPV039 is able to substitute for F1L in inhibiting Bak activation and apoptosis triggered by staurosporine and VACV infection. EBV is a prominent member of -herpesviruses, invading primary resting B lymphocytes to establish a latent infection. the potent mitogenic effect of EBV is mediated by the coordinated expression of several gene products, including the apoptotic modulators BALF1 and BHRF1 [S215,S244] BHRF1 is responsible for BHRF1 targeting to intracellular membranes. it contains two central hydrophobic -helices that are surrounded by several amphipathic -helices. BHRF1 is not able to sequestrate and inhibit proapoptotic BH3-only proteins. herpesvirus papio BHRF1 (hpnBHRF1) is a 17-kDa protein that shares 64% sequence identity and 79% sequence similarity with BHRF1 from EBV. in functional assays, hpoBHRF1 and BHRF1 similarly protected human keratinocytes against cisplatin-induced apoptosis. KSBcl-2 exhibits an overall fold almost identical to that of Bcl-2/Bcl-XL. key differences exist in the lengths of helices and loops. KSBcl-2 neither homodimerizes nor heterodimerizes with other Bcl-2 family members. inine and the two adjacent residues within the BH3 binding groove resulted in a correctly folded protein that failed to bind Bax BH3 peptide and to inhibit Bax toxicity in yeast. meanwhile, viruses harboring the same mutation exhibited impaired persistent replication and reactivation from latency in vivo. both proteins contain an MTS, an N-terminal region of a baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domain, and a putative BH2 domain. the MTS of K7 consists of a single TM hydrophobic region flanked by positively charged residues, and resembles that of M11L from MXV [S270] vBcl-2 family member A179L codes for a polypeptide of 21 kDa. it contains all known domains associated with Bcl-2 structural and functional features. this includes those mediating protein-binding (i.e., homo- and heterodimerization) and regulating cell death. vMIA-mediated inhibition of the ATP synthasome and stabilization of complex I by 2.7 RNA. this combined modulation should not lead to an increase in m, but to decreased mitochondrial ATP generation. EBNA leader protein (EBNA-LP) has been shown to interfere with host cell transcription. NS2 reportedly blocks Cyt c release and apoptosis induced by CIDE-B [81]. NS2 and CIDE-B exhibit partially overlapping signals in the nuclear proximity. another HCV non structural protein, NS5A, is localized at the ER of HCV-infected cells. the K15 gene contains eight alternatively spliced exons and encodes membrane proteins with a variable number of TM domains plus a common C-terminal region with putative binding sites. K15, a 45-kDa protein consisting of all eight exons and including 12 TM segments, has been implicated in the regulation of host gene expression. HHV-8 encodes a plethora of factors that participate in virus-associated tumorigenesis by modulating host cell intracellular signalling, proliferation, apoptosis, and immune response [S288]. Various proteins encoded by the E3 transcription unit of ADVs exert antiapoptotic and immune-modulatory functions, thereby protecting infected cells from cytotoxic T cells and lethal cytokines. baculoviruses infect insect cells and possess at least two different classes of proteins by which they control the host apoptotic response. p35 inhibits apoptosis induced by multiple signals in cells from evolutionarily distant organisms such as humans [S314], mice [S315], insects [89,90;S316], nematodes [91,92;S317], and flies [S318]. vIAPs contain a carboxyl ring finger and tandem duplication of a Cys/His motif known as BIR (baculovirus IAP repeat) homologs have been identified in other viral strains (e.g., A224L from ASFV [S322]) and in multiple metazoan organisms as diverse as humans [S323,S324], mice [94]; flies [95;S325,S326], nematodes vMAP interacts with VDAC1 via two leucine-rich motifs located in the central and C-terminal parts of the protein, thus suppressing Cyt c release and apoptosis. vMAP is necessary for efficient HV-68 replication in normal cells (with an intact apoptotic apparatus), but not in bax//ba/ cells. for the proteins discussed in this manuscript can be found online in Text S1.
