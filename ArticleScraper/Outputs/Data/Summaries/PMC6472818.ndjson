{"summary": "an accurate and rapid diagnostic test can facilitate better patient care by informing prompt and appropriate treatment, leading to decreased morbidity and mortality. rapid diagnostics are also critical to identify pathogens for which targeted public health interventions can be employed to control disease transmission in the community. many NAAT products now exist that have been cleared or approved by national health authority agencies. cost per test is a further barrier to adoption, as many LMICs cannot purchase these high-cost diagnostic tests without global donor support. the WHO published a target product profile for a simple and accurate diagnostic NAAT for Mycobacterium tuberculosis to supplant smear microscopy with a targeted price of US $4\u20136 [16] data were compiled and analyzed to gauge the suitability of these six technologies for future inclusion into an LMIC-appropriate integrated testing system. six developers agreed to participate in this study based upon their estimated potential to meet a critical cost goal of approximately $2 per extraction. these developers offered several innovative devices and NA extraction methods incorporating various chemical, heat, and/or mechanical lysis. human raw sputum, whole blood and stool specimen matrices were used in this study because they are common specimen types used for the diagnosis of many infectious diseases. the use of contrived samples was deliberately chosen to limit the heterogeneity of each sample type as compared to clinically derived samples. each specimen type (stool, sputum, or whole blood) was spiked with bacteria and/or an RNA-based virus to enable semi-quantitative PCR assessment of both DNA and RNA extraction efficiencies from each specimen panel. all of the real time PCR assays used in this study are qualitative and not quantitative. the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed once with PBS, resuspended in 20 mLs PBS, and stored at 4\u00b0C until use. the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed once with PBS and resuspended in 20 mLs PBS. 500 L sample volumes were liquefied using an equal volume of 2% N-acetyl-L-cysteine and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. the cells pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 L Tris EDTA buffer (pH8.0) containing acid-washed glass beads and disrupted for 2 min. a pre-RNA extraction clean-up step was done as follows. 300 L of each sample was first incubated with 300 L dithiothreitol solution. for blood samples, 400 L was first mixed with 400 L bacterial lysis buffer (Roche), 400 L pH neutral buffer, and 40 L proteinase K (25 mg/mL) for stool, 200 mg were added and the cells were disrupted twice for one minute at 5000 rpm. real time RT-PCR was performed on an Agilent Mx3005P qPCR system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at the PATH laboratory and the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast system (thermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) each panel was comprised of seven spiked (positive) and three unspiked (negative) samples. samples were spiked with different microbes to represent high (Ct 18 1.5), medium (Ct 26 1.5) and low (Ct 35 1.5) amounts of test microbe NA in each specimen panel, with corresponding levels of one microbe and/or the other. the input amount of each test microbe used for spiking was semi-quantitatively determined via PCR Crossing threshold (Ct) values. eight samples were spiked with varying concentrations of S. Typhimurium and/or MS2 phage corresponding to high, medium, or low Ct levels. the spiked blood panels were mixed to ensure an even distribution of spiking agents. the ten BL panels were then aliquoted in 1 mL volumes. the 87 test aliquots across the three specimen panels were blinded via four-digit numbers and shipped overnight on dry ice. each developer was asked to document the amount of each sample used for each NA extraction, the final elution volume, the time required and the number of user steps for extraction each panel. the extracts were stored at -80\u00b0C until testing. the five normalized parameters of ASSUR calculated each plot were equally weighted. the average of these parameters was calculated for each target microbe. six developers agreed to participate in this study based on their estimated potential to meet a critical cost goal of approximately $2 per extraction. human raw sputum, whole blood and stool specimen matrices were used in this study because they are common specimen types used for the diagnosis of many infectious diseases. the use of contrived samples was deliberately chosen to limit the heterogeneity of each sample type as compared to clinically derived samples. culture and preparation of microbial agents for specimen spiking Each specimen type (stool, sputum, or whole blood) was spiked with bacteria and/or an RNA-based virus to enable semi-quantitative PCR assessment of both DNA and RNA extraction efficiencies from each specimen panel. the cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed once with PBS and resuspended in 20 mLs PBS. the cell suspension was aliquoted in 1mL stock volumes and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. all NA eluates derived from extractions were stored at -80\u00b0C until use. 500 L sample volumes were liquefied using an equal volume of 2% N-acetyl-L-cysteine and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. the cells pelleted by centrifugation and clarified supernatants transferred to sterile microtubes. 300 L of each sample was first incubated with 300 L dithiothreitol solution. 400 L of blood was first mixed with 400 L bacterial lysis buffer (Roche), 400 L pH neutral buffer, and 40 L proteinase K (25 mg/mL) the cells were disrupted twice for one minute at 5000 rpm. the solution was centrifuged at 10 000 g for one minute and 700 L of supernatant used for extraction. real-time RT-PCR was performed on an Agilent Mx3005P qPCR system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) each panel was comprised of ten sample members. most spiked with a bacterial pathogen and/or an RNA-based virus to assess NA extraction efficiencies from the three specimen matrices. sputum was spiked with MTB and/or influenza A virus. whole blood was spiked with S. pneumoniae and/or MS2 bacteriophage. stool was spiked with S. Typhimurium LT2 and/or MS2 phage. the SP panel samples were dispensed into 0.5 mL aliquots for later use. eight aliquots were spiked with varying concentrations of S. pneumoniae and MS2 phage corresponding to high, medium, or low Ct levels. the spiked blood panels were then mixed to ensure an even distribution of spiking agents. 87 test aliquots (less the three replicates of SP6) across the three specimen panels were blinded via four-digit numbers and shipped overnight on dry ice. each developer was asked to document the amount of each sample used for each NA extraction, the final elution volume, the time required and the number of user steps for each extraction each panel. polar plots, one for each specimen panel, were generated for each developer based on the two target NAs within each panel. the five normalized parameters of ASSUR calculated each plot were equally weighted and the average of these parameters were calculated for each target microbe. each panel was comprised of seven spiked (positive) and three unspiked (negative) samples. sputum panel was prepared by pooling 210 mLs of raw human sputum and blending to create a homogenous mixture. eight aliquots were spiked with varying concentrations of S. pneumoniae and MS2 phage corresponding to high, medium, or low Ct levels. the samples were frozen using a dry ice/ethanol bath and then stored at -80\u00b0C until testing. the 87 test aliquots across the three specimen panels were blinded via four-digit numbers. each developer was asked to document the amount of each sample used for each extraction, the final elution volume, the time required and the number of user steps for extraction each panel. the use of polar plots to rank technologies on multiple key attributes The WHO created the acronym ASSURED to list the key attributes necessary for an effective point of care test. all of the developers consider their technology costs $2 per test and so all were scored at this price. the CDC further qualified the three panels by ensuring that each specimen yielded similar results to the PATH analyses. the data from the SP and BL panels extracted by the MagNaPure (CDC) closely correlated with the Qiagen (PATH) data with a +/- 2 variance observed between the mean Ct values. however, the stool panel data showed greater variance. shaded rows represent spiked (positive) and non-spiked (negative) samples. CDC used the Roche MagNaPure platform; PATH used the Qiagen extraction kits except for MTB.

RT-PCR on the extracts from developer B correctly identified the majority of replicates spiked with MS2. many of the unspiked sample extracts also scored RT-PCR positive (Table 2), resulting in poor specificity. ked samples (BL5 and/or BL7) generated variable RT-PCR results. developers E and F showed higher sensitivities at 96% and 98% respectively. all technologies achieved 90% specificity, with developers A, B, C, D and E scoring 100%. the different extraction methods used at PATH and CDC than compared to any of competitors in terms of both RNA and DNA extraction. multiple factors may contribute to the diagnostic accuracies observed with these six technologies. these include the amount of sample processed in a NA extraction, the final elution volume and the percentage of the eluate used in the amplification/detection steps. 5.0 RNA 140 28 60 8.3 2.3 Blood DNA 200 20 200 2.5 0.5 RNA 140 14 60 8.3 1.2 Stool DNA 200 20 200 2.5 0.5 RNA 28 3 60 8.3 0.2 CDC Sputum DNA/RNA 300 60 100 5.0 3.0 Blood DNA/RNA 225.8 23 100 5.0 1.2 Stool DNA/RNA 22.6 2 100 5.0 0.1 A Sputum DNA/RNA 500 100 105 4.8 4.8 Blood DNA/RNA 1000 100 105 4.8 developers ranked third with all matrices in terms of sensitivity. developers B, E and F also used larger sputum input and NA elution volumes. developers ranked third with all matrices in terms of sensitivity. the best overall performer had the longest turnaround time (55 minutes) and 6 - 10 manual steps depending on the sample type processed. developers A-F had the fewest number manual steps and processing times ( 35 minutes) for sputum and blood. each technology (developer A\u2013F) was normalized from 0.0 to 1.0. each component for ASSUR was normalized from 0.0 to 1.0. the developers are listed as A\u2013F and with panels for sputum (SP), Blood (BL) and sputum (SP) developers A and E each dropped by two places to third and fifth. the stool averages developer F was again ranked highest with developer B ranked second. developers A and F were the top two technologies developed by Akonni Biosystems and Molbio Diagnostics respectively. the inclusion of turnaround times (TAT) and manual steps in the ASSUR dataset was the underlying reason for Molbio moving ahead of Akonni Biosystems (A). each technology (developer A\u2013F) was normalized from 0.0 to 1.0. each component for ASSUR was normalized from 0.0 to 1.0. 1.0 represents the most optimal value within each component in the set of data points for each component. developers based upon specificity only is provided in parentheses; FLU, influenza A, MTB, M. tuberculosis; SP, sputum; MS2, male specific bacteriophage; SPN, S. pneumoniae; BL, blood, STM, S.
