{"summary": "mammalian defensins are cationic, tridisulfide-containing peptides comprising 3 subfamilies denoted as -defensin, -defensin, and -defensin. -defensins contribute to host defense as antimicrobial agents [1\u20136] and by regulating inflammatory [7\u201313] and adaptive immune responses [14\u201317]. -defensins, -defensins, and -defensins are chemotactic for T cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and monocytes. they induce secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from activated dendritic cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and epithelial cells. -defensins modulate inflammation via regulation of pathways shared by diverse inflammatory stimuli. results suggest that -defensins modulate inflammation via regulation of pathways shared by diverse inflammatory stimuli. cell culture THP-1 monocytes (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 + 10% HI-FBS and P/S. THP-1 cell differentiation was induced by treatment of cells (3.3 105 cells/ml) with 100 nM PMA and cultured for 2 d. medium was collected, clarified by centrifugation, first at 250 g for 8 min, then at 5000 g for 5 min. TNF-, IL-1, and IL-8 secreted in the medium were quantified by ELISA. results are from 1 of 2 similar, independent experiments. custom PCR arrays were used for simultaneous, real-time PCR analysis. master mix containing cDNA and RT2 SYBR Green was added to the array wells. a single amplicon with CtPPC = 20 2 was confirmed using a human gDNA primer. 2 105 HEK-Blue hTLR9 cells/ml were cultured for 1 d in 24-well plates. NF-B activity was defined as fold stimulation of SEAP activity compared with control cells. NF-B DNA binding was quantified by p65 ELISA. -1 cells (8 105 cells/2.5 ml medium) were starved in complete medium containing 1% FBS for 1 d. fresh 2.5 ml RPMI 1640, 1% FBS, and P/S were added for 2 h. cells were then washed 2 times with RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% HI FBS. sd and sem were calculated for experiments repeated 3 and 4 times. the Student\u2019s t test was performed to evaluate the significance of peptide effects; difference was considered significant if P 0.05. cell culture THP-1 monocytes (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 + 10% HI-FBS and P/S. THP-1 cell differentiation was induced by treatment of cells (3.3 105 cells/ml) with 100 nM PMA and cultured for 2 d. medium was collected, clarified by centrifugation, first at 250 g for 8 min, then at 5000 g for 5 min.

NF-B activation was defined as fold stimulation of SEAP activity compared with control cells. cells were starved in complete medium containing 1% FBS for 1 d as above. fresh 2.5 ml RPMI 1640, 1% FBS, and P/S were added for 2 h. cells were then washed 2 times with RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% HI FBS. arrays or bands from Western blotting were quantified using U.S. imageJ software. sd and sem were calculated for experiments repeated 3 and 4 times. difference was considered significant if P 0.05. the addition of RTD-1 had no effect on the expression of GAPDH. the peptide alone had no effect on cytokine mRNA expression. results demonstrate potent regulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression. molar concentrations of human neutrophil -defensin HNP-1 or an acyclic variant of RTD-1 were used in place of RTD-1. SEAP activity in the medium of cells stimulated with TLR agonists in the presence or absence of RTD-1 was assayed using Quantiblue. the numbers indicate the concentration of ODN2006 in g/ml. results are shown as means sd from 3 independent experiments. compared with treatment with agonist alone. g/ml RTD-1, were assayed for DNA binding. results are means sd from 3 independent experiments. compared with LPS- or TNF-treated samples. s were treated with or without LPS (100 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of MM and RTD-1. TNF- (black bars) and IL-1 (open bars) secreted in the medium were then measured by ELISA. extracts of LPS-stimulated macrophages contained elevated levels of phosphorylated CREB, ERK2, HSP27, JNK2, p38, and p38. treatment with RTD-1 alone did not suppress the phosphorylation of these proteins. RTD-1 treatment induced a 6.5-fold increase in pAkt within 10 min of peptide treatment. pAkt levels remained elevated by 2.5-fold for at least 4 h. addition of PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 markedly reduced RTD-1-induced pAkt levels. Western blots were performed using Akt or pAkt antibodies. THP-1 Dual cells were pretreated with Ly294002 for 60 min. then stimulated overnight with 100 ng/ml LPS RTD-1 (10 g/ml) a previous study found that RTD-1 suppressed secretion of several inflammatory cytokines by peripheral blood leukocytes stimulated by agonists of TLRs 2, 4, 5, and 8, and the inhibition of TNF-, IL-1, and IL-8 release was most notable. in this study, RTD-1 treatment markedly (>90%) suppressed secretion of TNF-, IL-1, and IL-8 by LPS-stimulated primary human monocytes and RTD-1 down-regulates mRNA of proinflammatory cytokines. cDNA from differentiated THP-1 cells treated with LPS (100 ng/ml) RTD-1 (10 g/ml) for 2 h or from control (untreated) cells. THP-1 Dual cells were stimulated with or without LPS (100 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of 10 g/ml RTD-1 or the acyclic S7 peptide. results are shown as means sd from 3 independent experiments. both ligands stimulated NF-B activation, 5- and 6-fold. addition of 10 g/ml RTD-1 inhibited Pam3CSK4-induced NF-B activity by 70%. peptide suppressed activation to baseline levels. decrease in inhibition of NF-B DNA binding correlated with levels of p65 in treated and untreated THP-1 cells. anti-inflammatory effects of RTD-1 were compared with those of marimastat, a potent inhibitor of TNF-converting enzyme. signaling pathways affected by RTD-1 LPS binding to TLR4 initiate a cascade of signaling events that leads to activation of a complex containing TAK1. Activated IKK phosphorylates the NF-B inhibitor IB, triggering its degradation, which activates NF-B for nuclear translocation. treatment with RTD-1 alone did not suppress the phosphorylation of these proteins. extracts from control (C), 100 ng/ml LPS-treated (L), 100 ng/ml LPS + 10 g/ml RTD-1 treated (L+R), or 10 g/ml RTD-1-treated (R) THP-1 cells were used to probe a phospho-MAPK array. PI3K\u2013Akt pathway negatively regulates activation of NF-B and MAPK pathways. we tested the effect of Ly294002 on the RTD-1-mediated inhibition of NF-B activation in LPS-stimulated THP-1 dual cells. RTD-1 alone did not induce degradation of IB, but it reduced degradation of IB in LPS-stimulated monocytes. however, as observed in experiments with THP-1 macrophages, increased phosphorylation of Akt was observed in monocytes treated with LPS, LPS and RTD-1. the effects of systemically administered RTD-1 in mouse models of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection [27] and sepsis [26] are mediated, at least partly, by suppression of immunopathological cytokine expression. the previously observed anti-inflammatory mechanisms of -defensins are mediated by regulation of inflammatory gene expression. peptide treatment markedly inhibited NF-B activation by each agonist. the human -defensin HNP-1 had no inhibitory activity. acyclic version of RTD-1 did not inhibit NF-B activation. the blockade of TNF- release and subsequent suppression of autocrine signaling cannot account for the immunomodulatory effects of RTD-1. we also analyzed the effect of RTD-1 on signaling kinases implicated in LPS-induced inflammatory responses. THP-1 cell exposure to RTD-1 alone induced phosphorylation of Akt. however, RTD-1 did not increase baseline phosphorylation of other kinase targets. PI3K-Akt inhibits secretion of TNF- and IL-1 in LPS-stimulated cells. human -defensin HNP1 and human -defensins HBD2 and HBD3 stimulate expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from human conjunctival epithelial cells. both -defensins and -defensins are known to regulate cellular responses through receptor-mediated pathways. human neutrophil peptides induce signaling pathways through the P2Y6 receptor [7] proinflammatory vs. anti-inflammatory properties of a single peptide may be a function of local concentration [55\u201357]. -defensins, expressed at very high levels in granules of circulating neutrophils and monocytes, provide a physiologic dampening of inflammatory processes following their release and/or secretion."}
