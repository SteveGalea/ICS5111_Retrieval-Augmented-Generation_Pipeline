{"summary": "inTRODUCTION Measles virus (MeV) is a highly contagious and immunosuppressive virus that still causes more than 120,000 deaths in developing countries each year. the virus has been responsible for small epidemics throughout North America and Europe, where vaccination coverage has waned (1, 2). the core of the Ig fold is formed by two opposing antiparallel sheets connected in a unique manner (21, 22) the core of the Ig fold is formed by four -strands (B, C, E, and F) augmented with additional -strands (A, C\u2032, C\u2032\u2032, D, and G) a single residue variant in the nectin-4 BC loop restricts MeV entry in pig airway epithelial cells. a single residue variant in the nectin-4 BC loop restricts MeV entry in pig airway epithelial cells. CHO-N1 and CHO-N4 cells were grown in RPMI medium. all the cell lines were kept at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. to generate MV323LucII, the firefly luciferase open reading frame was transferred into an infectious MV (i.e., recombinant MeV) genome. cells were inoculated at the indicated MOIs for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in Opti-MEM I reduced-serum medium, washed, and incubated in 5% FBS medium at 37\u00b0C. cells were infected with MV323LucII at an MOI of 0.2 in the presence of 10 g/ml of the corresponding recombinant soluble nectin-4 ectodomain. RNA was extracted from cultures of pig airway epithelial cells using the RNeasy kit. a reverse transcription step followed by a PCR using specific primers. the pN4 cDNA encoding a C-ter FLAG-tagged protein was cloned in the pCG vector. for all these plasmids, desired mutations were introduced by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis. cells were lysed in coimmunoprecipitation buffer (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 50 mM Na-Pyro-PO4, 50 mM Na-F, 50 mM NaCl2, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 100 M sodium vanadate, 1% Triton X-100) 48 h posttransfection. supernatants were harvested at days 5 and 7 posttransfection. protein concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. soluble nectin-4 ectodomains were expressed and purified as described previously (11) the antibody surface was regenerated by injection of 50 mM citric acid (pH 3.0) for 60 s followed by 10 mM glycine (pH 3.0) for 60 s. the surface was regenerated by injection of 50 mM citric acid (pH 3.0) for 60 s. antibodies R1.302, N4.61 and N4.40 were described previously. binding of the soluble nectin-4 ectodomain was assessed by flow cytometry using anti-human goat PE antibodies. cell lines were kept at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. to generate MV323LucII, the firefly luciferase open reading frame (ORF) was transferred into an infectious MV (i.e., recombinant MeV) genome. verohSLAM cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. cells were scraped into Opti-MEM I reduced-serum medium. titters were determined by 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) titration. pN4 cDNA encoding a C-ter FLAG-tagged protein was cloned in the pCG vector. pN4 cDNA encoding a C-ter FLAG-tagged protein was cloned in the pCG vector. a reverse transcription step followed by a PCR using specific primers. cell surface and total expression of the recombinant N4 were analyzed by flow cytometry and immunoblotting at 48 h posttransfection. cells were lysed in coimmunoprecipitation buffer (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 50 mM Na-Pyro-PO4, 50 mM Na-F, 50 mM NaCl2, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 100 M sodium van cos-7 cells were transfected with pCFR1 and pCFR4 encoding the full-length nectin-1 and nectin-4 ectodomains (wild type or mutants) supernatants were harvested at days 5 and 7 posttransfection, from which proteins were purified through their Fc tag using protein A chromatography (Pierce). antibody surface was regenerated by injection of 50 mM citric acid (pH 3.0) for 60 s and 10 mM glycine (pH 3.0) for 60 s. cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the corresponding FLAG-tagged nectin-4 or nectin-1. CHO-N1 cells expressing human nectin-1 were incubated with 1 g of soluble nectin-4 ectodomain in the presence of 10 g/l of an antibody directed to the V domain of nectin-1 (R1.302) additional competition experiments included a soluble H ectodomain (sH) or 10 g/l of an sH in the presence of 100 g/l of H-neutralizing antibody 20H6 (40). adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vectors expressing mCherry or the human nectin-4 were diluted in sterile PBS to an MOI of 0.1. 100 l of the solution was applied for 4 h to the basolateral surface. cross-linking the nectin-4 adhesive interface prevents infection. the right panel shows the dimer interface with the residues mutated to Cys and the expected disulfide bonds (red dotted lines) the dimerization capacity and protein expression levels of the nectin-4 cysteine substitution mutants were separated by 4 to 15% SDS-PAGE. luciferase levels were measured at 16 h postinfection to assess cell entry. the nectin-4 adhesive interface loops BC and FG are critical for MeV entry. the nectin-4 adhesive interface loops BC and FG are critical for MeV entry. -4 mutant proteins analyzed 48 h posttransfection by flow cytometry. the dashed line indicates

variant residue in the BC loop of pig nectin-4 disallows MeV entry. the right panel shows the number of infectious centers per well (averages and standard deviations) key residues in the BC, C\u2032C\u2032\u2032, and FG loops are underlined. the variant amino acids tested functionally are boxed. pig nectin-4 did not support entry of MeV in transfected cells. however, substitution of

immunoblotting. cells were infected with MV323LucII at an MOI of 0.2 in the absence (NT, not treated) or presence of soluble nectin-4 ectodomain (N4-Fc, green), or soluble mutants of nectin-4 with substitutions in the BC (QVGQ, blue), C\u2032C\u2032\u2032 (HSKY, polarized primary pig airway epithelia cannot be infected with MeV. expression of human nectin-4 through an adenovirus vector rendered these epithelial sheets susceptible to basolateral MeV infection. expression of human nectin-4 through an adenovirus vector rendered these epithelial sheets susceptible to basolateral MeV entry. sequence alignment of the IgV domains of pig and human nectin-4. key residues in the BC, C\u2032C\u2032\u2032, and FG loops are underlined. substitution of glutamic acid with glycine at position 62 (N4_E62G) reestablished MeV receptor activity to pig nectin-4. heterophilic interactions of nectin-4 with nectin-1 are much stronger than both types of homophilic interactions. nectin-4 molecules are likely to be present on the cell surface as nectin-4/nectin-1 heterodimers. CHO-N1 cells expressing nectin-1 in the absence of anti-IgV nectin-1 antibodies (R1.302), anti-IgV nectin-4 antibodies (N4.61), anti-IgC nectin-4 antibodies (N4.40), soluble hemagglutinin ectodomain (sH), or soluble hemagglutinin ectodomain (sH + 20H6) were not incubated with N4-Fc mutants L81S/H83A, NS84A/Y86A, G87S, and H89A also lost binding to nectin-1. soluble nectin-1 ectodomains 61-QVGQ-64, 83-HSKY-86, and 132-FPAG-135 did not coimmunoprecipitate with a FLAG-tagged nectin-1. at 48 h posttransfection, nectin-4 proteins were immuno proteins were detected using antibodies to the human Fc fragment of IgG1 (huFc) for soluble nectin-1 or the FLAG epitope for the FLAG-tagged nectin-4. DISCUSSION Viruses depend on cell surface molecules to enter cells. the nectin-4 FG loop (red backbone) protrudes into an H-protein hydrophobic groove (orange surface) the BC loop (blue backbone) covers the groove and helps stabilize the complex. pig nectin-4 with a glycine at the critical position has full MeV receptor activity. the conserved 131-TFP-X-G-135 motif of the nectin-4 FG loop contacts the BC and FG loops of the opposite monomer. residues protrude deep in the groove and participate in hydrophobic interactions with residues L482, Y483, Y541, and Y543 on Mev H (16). the same motif in the FG loop of nectin-1 is also targeted by HSV (29). interactions between soluble forms of viral attachment proteins and their receptors can be much stronger than homophilic interactions between receptor subunits. interactions between soluble forms of viral attachment proteins and their receptors can be much stronger than homophilic interactions."}
