{"summary": "the most commonly recognized cause of pulmonary hypertension in cattle is hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction and remodeling associated with high-altitude exposure. the most commonly recognized cause of pulmonary hypertension in cattle is hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction and remodeling associated with high-altitude exposure. mPAP may lead to increased mPAP by predisposing affected individuals to alveolar hypoxia. cows were monitored every 3 h for signs of calving difficulty and assistance provided as necessary. cows were moved to a dry-lot setting for 7 d, so calves could be processed and resorted prior to being placed on nonirrigated wheat pasture. cows were vaccinated against BRSV, IBR and PI3. cows also received doramectin and albendazole for internal parasites. calves were revaccinated against BRSV, IBR, and PI3. they were given new vaccinations that included Mannheimia haemolytica, BVD types 1 and 2. d-alpha-tocopherol was also injected with the anthelmintic doramectin. calves were retreated for respiratory disease with ceftiofur crystalline free acid (6.6 mg ceftiofur equivalents/kg; Excede; Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ) no calves were treated more than twice. the first treated and untreated calves to be processed in the chute were sampled. jugular vein, right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery have distinct pressure waveforms. blood samples shipped overnight in an insulated container lined with icepacks. plasma protein was assessed by refractometry. study site and Husbandry Seventy-four purebred Red Angus calves were born in a pasture setting from January 9, 2017 to February 22, 2017. the calves were a result of a fresh embryo transfer program that was transferred into commercial black-hided dams. cow\u2013calf pairs were moved permanently into a dry-lot setting for 7 d. cows were fed a total mixed ration consisting of corn gluten feed, cotton burrs, cracked corn, and a custom mineral supplement. each pen had shade and a creep area where calves could have access to free choice Bermuda grass hay along with a molasses-based lick tub at 12% crude protein. all procedures were approved by the Texas Tech University Animal Care and Use Committee prior to commencing the study. calves were vaccinated against BRSV, IBR, and PI3. all calves were observed nursing within 24 h of birth. calf showed signs consistent with respiratory disease and had a rectal temperature greater than 39.4 \u00b0C. the handler treated the calf with tulathromycin (2.5 mg/kg; Draxxin; Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ) no calves were treated more than twice. blood was collected in 10 mL glass tubes containing the anticoagulant EDTA. the tubes were inverted five times before storage in an insulated container cooled with ice packs. a pressure transducer connected the catheter and oscilloscope. typic and blood leukogram variables were screened for a univariable association with the outcome variable mPAP. those that had a probability of a type 1 error of 0.20 or less were included in the full regression model. the majority (75%) of calves were treated between 40 and 45 d prior to weaning. three of the calves sampled were treated twice for BRD with a 1-wk interval between treatments.
