{"summary": "mechanical ventilation Physiology In acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) the amount of aerated lung is markedly reduced as a result of alveolar collapse and flooding. about one-third of the total gas volume was poorly or nonventilated in the lungs of ARDS patients. surfactant treatment did not affect mortality but it helped in weaning from ECMO. spontaneous breathing with airway pressure release ventilation countered undesirable alveolar collapse in dependent lung regions, resulting in end-expiratory aeration. a multi-centre trial of the safety and efficacy of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) in ARDS patients. the study was prematurely stopped because of poor patient accrual. there were no statistically significant differences in mortality or survival without supplemental oxygen. no worsening of exacerbation was observed in patients treated with IPV. the hospital stay was significantly shorter in the IPV group than in the control group (6.8 1.0 days versus 7.9 1.3 days; P 0.05). the remifentanil-based sedation regimen reduced the duration of mechanical ventilation by 53.5 hours. the remifentanil-based sedation regimen reduced the time from the start of the weaning process to extubation by 26.6 hours. piratory gas volume independent of ventilation represents poorly or nonventilated gas volume. about one-third of the total gas volume was poorly or nonventilated in the lungs of ARDS patients at a positive end-expiratory pressure level of 5 cmH2O. this uneven distribution of ventilation is probably due to the presence of small airway closure and/or obstruction. tidal ventilation countered the undesirable cyclic alveolar collapse in dependent lung regions. but no indices of lung injury were assessed. allowing spontaneous breathing activity in ALI could help reduce lung injury. a post hoc analysis suggested that there was a relative improvement with HFOV compared with CMV in patients with a higher baseline oxygenation index. in patients with diffuse alveolar disease the survival rate was 56%, and this rate was 88% in patients with small airway disease (n = 17). erythropoietin is an endogenous glycoprotein hormone that is the primary stimulus for erythropoiesis. the erythropoietin response is blunted in anaemic mechanically ventilated patients compared with matched anaemic ambulatory patients. the increased IAP does not severely impair cardiopulmonary, renal, or hepatosplanchnic functions during short periods of prone positioning. many patients included in previous studies were placed on air-cushioned beds, which might have had an impact on these variables. ocomial pneumonia who received additional aerosolized colistin was better. survival and clinical cure rates for the infection were better in patients with pneumonia who received additional aerosolized colistin. this study suggests there is a need for a randomized controlled trial. aspergillus spp. was recovered in 36 patients; in 14 patients isolation of Aspergillus spp. was interpreted as colonization (mortality 50%), in 20 patients it was interpreted as invasive aspergillosis (mortality 80%), two cases were not classified. ator inhibitor-1, neutrophil elastase and interleukin-8 improved arterial oxygen tension/fractional inspired oxygen ratio at 96 hours after the start of treatment. blocking the ET-1 receptor decreases the extravascular lung water index during endotoxaemia. in patients with cystic fibrosis aerosolized colistin has successfully been used to treat acute pulmonary exacerbations of infection or initial colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. survival and clinical cure rates for the infection were better in patients with pneumonia who received additional aerosolized colistin. isolation of Aspergillus spp. should be interpreted as colonization. antifungal treatment should not be initiated when Aspergillus spp. are recovered from bronchial aspirates. haemoperfusion reduced levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, neutrophil elastase and interleukin-8 in blood at 48 hours, and improved arterial oxygen tension/fractional inspired oxygen ratio at 96 hours after the start of treatment. pulmonary oedema develops following sepsis caused by caecal ligation and puncture. a partial carbon dioxide rebreathing technique can be used to estimate cardiac output in mechanically ventilated patients. however, carbon dioxide rebreathing can result in increased minute ventilation and an irregular respiratory pattern. a respiratory variation in pulse oximetry plethysmographic waveform amplitude above 15% accurately discriminated between patients with a respiratory variation in systemic pulse pressure above 13% from those with a variation of 13% or less. the study suggests that this may be a noninvasive approach to assessment of fluid responsiveness in ventilated patients. souza and coworkers analyzed pulmonary artery pressure decay curves in patients with pulmonary hypertension due to either idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH; n = 12) or ARDS (n = 11). different algorithms yield different PCP within the groups. the study suggests that this may be a noninvasive approach to assessment of fluid responsiveness in ventilated patients. it was used to train health care workers in managing cardiac arrest while wearing unfamiliar equipment and following a modified advanced cardiac life support protocol. training Abrahamson and coworkers described effective implementation of a simulation protocol during SARS to train health care workers in managing cardiac arrest while wearing unfamiliar equipment. simulation provided insights that had not been considered in earlier phases of development of the protocol.
