{"summary": "monkeypox is an orthopox virus, closely related to smallpox. it produces vesicopapular lesions on the skin. symptoms are usually self-limiting and most people recover within weeks. 'tatafo' generates unstructured event-based reports from 350 media sites. the system uses keywords including the 41 notifiable diseases. the majority of entries came from newspapers, television and blogs. a report read 'a new airborne Ebola-like viral disease, referred to as \u2018Monkey Pox has hit the Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital (NDUTH), Okolobiri in Yenagoa local council of Bayelsa State' the media did not report that during this period, only two deaths had been reported among 197 suspected cases between September and December 2017. rumour led to closure of schools, low immunisation rates for other vaccine-preventable diseases during the period, and general widespread panic. despite this, there was less coverage of the government\u2019s reaction to the rumour compared with the media coverage of the rumour. communication about personal preventive measures is particularly useful during outbreaks as it empowers the public to take some responsibility for their own health. the media plays a very important role in the dissemination of news. in low/middle-income countries, health reporters should be targeted with increased advocacy and training to improve the messages they distribute."}
