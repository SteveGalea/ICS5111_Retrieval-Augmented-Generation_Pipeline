{"summary": "one in every 10 000 to 40 000 passengers on commercial aircraft will have a medical incident while on board. many physicians are unaware of the special features of the cabin atmosphere, the medical equipment available on airplanes, and the resulting opportunities for medical intervention. the cabin pressure in civil aircraft is at least the pressure at an altitude of 8000 feet (ca. 2438 m), i.e., no less than 753 hPa, where the air pressure of the standard atmosphere at sea level is 1013 hPa. part of the cabin air (no more than 40% to 50%) is recirculated and cleaned with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. hydrostatic edema in dependent limbs is common because of immobilization combined with the low ambient air pressure. the low humidity of cabin air, combined with hyperventilation, can lead to dehydration if the passenger does not consume adequate amounts of fluid during flight. in 2011, the airline registered one medical incident per 30 000 passengers. 70% of all incidents and emergencies occurred on intercontinental flights. common clinical problems included dizziness, collapse, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, paralysis, and colic. the categories \u201cCardiovascular conditions\u201d and \u201cneurological and psychiatric conditions\u201d are shown separately here. 70% of all incidents and emergencies occur on intercontinental flights. more than 35% involved patients over 55, with a peak between age 56 and age 65. only about 50% of the physicians who helped in medical incidents on board filled out an emergency protocol. the medical incidents were distributed proportionally to the flight volumes to the individual regions served. in-flight cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and death are rare events. more than 20 000 in-flight medical incidents documented in the Lufthansa registry (2000\u20132011), thrombosis was suspected in 202 cases (1% of the total) it was not possible to check on the correctness of these diagnoses or to include data on thromboembolic events occurring after landing. 1 intravenous infusion set with tubing, 2 Y-connectors, alcohol wipes, adhesive

be called on to help passengers with medical problems on board. physicians in aviation and emergency medicine are ready to advise in-flight helpers from the ground, assisting them both with diagnostic assessment and treatment decisions. the law on board commercial aircraft. an airplane is not a law-free zone. cabin crew often issues declaration of assumption of liability. insurance covers medical interventions even by persons whose medical qualifications are not generally recognized in the country under whose jurisdiction the aircraft or airline operates. emergency assistance is accepted and insured, but the practice of medicine as an ordinary commercial activity is not. a calm and competent demeanor on the part of the helping physician can lighten the stressful emotional situation on board and contribute to the success of any medical interventions provided. financial claims. if a physician who provides assistance on board decides to request financial compensation, this request should be made to the passenger who was assisted, rather than to the airline. the captain's power of enforcement gives the commander of the aircraft the authority to ensure that actions are taken in the interest of the affected person. unscheduled landings Depending on the (presumed) diagnosis, the severity of the patient\u2019s condition, the degree of medical expertise and support available on board, and the flight route may be considered necessary. the captain has more to consider than just the medical care of the ill passenger. in doubtful cases, the helping physician should speak by satellite telephone with a physician on the ground who has special expertise in aviation medicine. the airlines\u2019 right to do this is derived from their overall responsibility for safety on board. the risk of a medical incident increases with the age of the traveler, the distance to be flown, and the duration of the flight. climatic and hygienic conditions at the point of departure can also influence the frequency of in-flight medical incidents. medical recommendations before flying are especially useful for persons with respiratory diseases. patients with congestive heart failure, renal failure, or hepatic cirrhosis can use a supplemental oxygen unit, approved for use in flight, that delivers up to 5 liters of oxygen per minute via nasal prongs. patients with ventilatory disturbances or limited cardiopulmonary function can use a supplemental oxygen unit, approved for use in flight. medical devices are available for home use, and some may be used on board. specific information on the permitted use of various devices should be requested from the airline at least 48 hours before the flight. light intensive care."}
