{"summary": "in 2014, the system reported 2 308 influenza virus isolates (77% type A and 23% type B) (3). up until epidemiological week 43 of 2015, the system reported 2 049 isolates: 91% type A (52% H3, 10% H1N1pdm09, and 38% not subtyped) 8% of 12 300 samples were influenza viruses. in so Paulo, 20% of hospitalizations were due to type B (7). influenza mortality rate was 0.08 per 100 000 population. table to influenza in children under 5 years old ranged from US$ 250 000 to US$ 350 000 (5). influenza-like illness (ILI) (at sentinel sites) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (in patients admitted to intensive care units, and in universal SARS surveillance) trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) was introduced into the national Immunization Program (NIP) in 2011 for children 6 months to 2 years old and other target groups including high-risk individuals. from 2011 to 2015, vaccine coverage in young children (6 months to 2 years old) ranged between 72% (for the first dose) and 50% (for the second) (9). influenza immunization is routinely administered to children 6 months to 5 years old, adults 60 years old and older, pregnant or postpartum women, health care workers, the indigenous population, individuals in prison, and high-risk groups (e.g., those with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, immunocompromising conditions, etc.) in 2011\u20132014, vaccination coverage exceeded 80% in all groups (15), and in 2015 approximately 50 million people (25% of the population) were immunized. a study carried out in argentina using the influenza A/H1N1 MF59-adjuvanted vaccine showed that vaccinated pregnant women had a lower risk of giving birth to low-weight babies. vaccinating 20% of schoolchildren had a greater impact on flu-related mortality than vaccinating 90% of the elderly (20). children introduced in japan, all-cause deaths, influenza and pneumonia-related deaths were significantly reduced in all age groups. when vaccination was stopped, mortality rates increased, especially in the elderly. a second hurdle to introducing a childhood influenza control program is related to safety and reduced confidence due to adverse events following immunization. unexpected AEFIs with two flu vaccines have had a negative impact. poor vaccine performance could discredit the integrity of the NIP. introducing flu vaccine into an NIP requires evidence of cost-effectiveness. in a study evaluating missed opportunities for flu vaccination, the main reason for the lower coverage was a lack of information from health care workers. the meeting participants emphasized the superiority of the aIIV3 compared to the IIV4. the efficacy of adjuvanted vaccines exceeds 80%, while also providing protection for mismatched B lines. promoting vaccination at childcare centers; 5) carrying out longterm vaccine safety surveillance to avoid AEFIs; 6) considering the introduction of aIIV3s for infants and children. 7) considering universal vaccination of schoolchildren to gain herd protection (in brazil; in argentina, this strategy was not deemed feasible in the short-term because the main objective there is to reduce morbidity and mortality in high-risk groups rather than reducing viral circulation). proposed education actions included: 1) enhancing education of health professionals; 2) reinforcing the nurse\u2019s role in promoting immunization and delivering vaccines; 3) raising awareness of the risk of influenza in the population; 4) targeting high-risk groups, working with scientific societies and specialists; and 5) strengthening the physician\u2013parent relationship."}
