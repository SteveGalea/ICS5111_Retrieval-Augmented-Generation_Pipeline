{"summary": "the 1918\u20131919 pandemic, the socalled \u201cmother of all pandemics,\u201d was responsible for over 50 million deaths among countless infections worldwide. 40 years after the last pandemic in 1968, the world may be on the brink of another major global pandemic, with a toll that could exceed that of 1918\u20131919. a comparative evaluation of antiviral strategies in homogeneous and heterogeneous population interactions was presented by Dr. Murray Alexander. he stressed the importance of prolonging the effectiveness of antiviral drugs through an adaptive treatment strategy. a major drawback for Canadian modelers is integration with public health. models used for pandemic planning need to be critically evaluated. modelers need to be prepared for all the likely scenarios that could influence the outcome of preparedness strategies. the time has come to build a pandemic consortium in Canada to have a voice from modelers. models should be based on realistic assumptions to create fundamental knowledge in all aspects of pandemic research. on the second day, the workshop comprised several presentations by participants from the public health domain. unanswered questions included the emergence of novel infectious diseases; understanding the spacetime dynamics of influenza spread; influenza mortality in pandemics and seasonal outbreaks. estimated hospital surge capacity for a given jurisdiction during a pandemic; local implementation (e.g., identification of the tipping point when primary care will not be able to meet the 24\u201348 hour standard of care); and antivirals (e.g., identifying the optimal use of drugs and distribution methods for treatment and prophylaxis to decelerate the spread of a pandemic). new work suggests a nascent influenza pandemic can be contained at the source if antiviral therapy for a sizable proportion of affected individuals (80\u201390%) is accompanied by a rapid implementation of nonpharmaceutical measures (such as movement restriction) over a very short period of time. YingHen Hsieh, a prominent modeler in Taiwan, shared his experience with SARS. the workshop highlighted important aspects of Canadian public health that will be useful for creating an effective venue to communicate with public health in Taiwan. pandemic containment has not been a priority to date and may not be feasible. a pandemic vaccine may take up to 6 months following pandemic detection. authors wish to express their appreciation to all the participants for their significant contribution to the workshop. authors would like to thank Margaret Montague, Sarah Dietrich, and justyna Swistak for assistance with meeting logistics. proc R Soc B 2007; 274:1675\u20131684.
