{"summary": "cathepsin L is a lysosomal cysteine protease that plays important roles in cancer tumorigenesis, proliferation and chemotherapy resistance. the expression of cathepsin L was analyzed using Western blot and immunofluorescence assays. most patients die within a year after diagnosis despite most effective management, including adjuvant radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy following initial surgery. irradiation can prolong the overall survival of some patients, but the resistance of glioma cells to radiation is a major therapeutic problem3. cathepsin L inhibition may also be a promising tool to improve radiation therapy effectiveness. we also determined whether cathepsin L could regulate radioresistance in glioma cells. cathepsin L (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), cyclin A (1:750, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), cyclin A (1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), cyclin A (1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), cyclin A (1:200, MultiSciences, Nanjing, China), -actin (1:200, Millipore, MA, USA), and Bax (1:500, Millipore, MA, USA) RNA was reverse-transcribed and amplified by RT-PCR. cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 3102 cells per well. after the cells were incubated overnight, they were irradiated with X-rays or left unirradiated. the sensitization enhancement ratio (SER) is determined by calculating the ratio at the mean lethal dose. SER values greater than 1 indicate enhanced radiosensitivity. the cells were fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. the membranes were blocked in 5% BSA for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibodies at 4 \u00b0C for 24 h. the membranes were washed three times with TBST buffer (20 mmol/L Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20) they were incubated with rabbit or mouse secondary antibodies for 1 h. 500 mmol/L Na2-EDTA, 500 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 1% sodium N-lauroyl sarcosinate, 1% Triton X-100 and 10% DMSO, pH 10) at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h in the dark. the slides were electrophoresed at 25 V and 300 mA at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min, before being neutralized with 0.4 mol/L Tris buffer (pH the percentage of apoptotic cells was measured using an Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/PI apoptosis detection kit (KeyGen, Nanjing, China) five thousand cells per sample were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. cyclin B1 (1:2000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), cathepsin L (1:1000, Abcam, MA, USA), -H2AX (1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), cyclin A (1:750, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), cyclin A (1:750, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), -actin (1:1000, MultiSciences, Nanjing, China), Bcl-2 (1:200, Millipore, MA, USA the cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 3102 cells per well. after the cells were incubated overnight, they were irradiated with X-rays or left unirradiated. after the cells were transfected, they were allowed to recover for 48 h. at least 3 independent experiments were performed, and Student's t-test was performed. the SF is calculated as follows: (mean colony count/inoculated cell count)plating efficiency. the membranes were blocked in 5% BSA for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibodies at 4 \u00b0C for 24 h. the membranes were washed three times with TBST buffer (20 mmol/L Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20) they were incubated with rabbit or mouse secondary antibodies for 1 h. the slides were coated with 1% normal melting-point agarose/PBS. then, the slides were treated with freshly prepared electrophoresis buffer. the samples were electrophoresed at 25 V and 300 mA for 30 min. the percentage of apoptotic cells was measured using an Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/PI apoptosis detection kit. five thousand cells per sample were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. we found that cathepsin L was present in the nucleus of certain U251 cells. after IR, cathepsin L expression increased in both nuclear and cytosolic fractions. this suggests that gliomas with mutant p53 expression have extremely different cathepsin L activity after IR. western blot analysis of cathepsin L protein levels in the nuclear fraction, cytosol fraction and total cell lysate at 48 h post-IR. cathepsin L level in the conditioned medium at 24 h after irradiation was measured in triplicate. cells treated with the cathepsin L inhibitor Z-FY-CHO generated a reduced number of colonies compared with the Z-FY-CHO-treated cells. the cells treated with both IR and IR generated a reduced number of colonies compared with the Z-FY-CHO-treated cells (P0.01). cathepsin L inhibition could sensitize glioma cells to IR. cells were treated with Z-FY-CHO at 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 mol/L for 12 h. cells were then treated with 4 Gy irradiation (or unirradiated) cathepsin L suppression may affect the DNA repair level. irradiation-induced DNA damage in U251 cells was examined by alkaline comet assays. the cells were treated with 8 Gy of IR (or unirradiated) our results showed that the Ku70 protein level of the combined treatment group was significantly decreased compared with the IR alone group. these results suggest that the increased level of -H2AX and decreased level of Ku70 may be involved in the increased radiosensitivity induced by cathepsin L suppression. cathepsin L inhibition-induced radiosensitivity in glioma cells is also associated with altered cell cycle distribution. the results may explain the cathepsin L suppression-induced radiosensitivity in glioma cells. the combined treatments for 24 and 72 h did not result in significant increases in the cell percentages at G2/M phase compared with IR alone. cathepsin L-inhibited, IR-treated cells underwent cell cycle arrest. therefore, we examined expression of cell cycle-associated molecules. cyclins A and B1 binds to cell division cycle 2 (CDC2). cyclin-dependent kinase 1, CDK1) to form mitosis-promoting factor. the morphological changes in the Z-FY-CHO+IR-treated cells were more significant than those in the IR-treated cells. the cells were pretreated with Z-FY-CHO at 10 mol/L (or untreated) for 12 h. the cells were treated with 8 Gy IR and analyzed at 48 and 72 h post-IR. cathepsin L inhibition resulted in a higher percentage of early apoptotic cells at 72 h post-IR in U251 cells. however, an insignificant difference was observed between the Z-FY-CHO+IR treatment and IR alone treatment at the 48 h time point. p53 gene upregulates cathepsin L transcription directly by binding to the cathepsin L gene promoter and indirectly by increasing the expression of another transcription factor, C/EBP. gliomas with mutant p53 expression have extremely different cathepsin L activity after IR. the levels of secreted cathepsin L in the conditioned media were higher compared to the levels in the untreated group. however, cathepsin L secretion in the conditioned medium of U87 cells treated with IR showed no significant correlation with the levels in the untreated group. effects of IR and Z-FY-CHO treatments on cell survival were determined by conducting clonogenic assays to identify the function of cathepsin L in cell viability. the inhibition rate was lower than 10% when the cells were treated with IR (2.5\u201310 mol/L) alone. the clonogenicity of U251 cells treated with both IR and IR was significantly reduced in an ionization dose-dependent manner compared with IR treatment alone. psin L shRNA cells showed higher radiosensitivity than the Con shRNA cells. the results were analyzed by comparing the SF values of cells left untreated (SF=1), cells treated with radiation (SF=0.140) and cells treated with cathepsin L shRNA+8 Gy IR (SF=0.018) the difference in these values was statistically significant (P0.01) we performed single-cell gel electrophoresis assays (alkaline comet assays) to study the DNA damage in U251 cells caused by cathepsin L inhibition. over 90% of the repair was completed 30 h following IR in the cells. high levels of -H2AX suppress DNA damage repair26,27. the level of -H2AX was increased in the IR alone group. r-H2AX, Ku70, and Rad51 protein levels were significantly decreased. the Rad51 protein level of cathepsin L-inhibited cells significantly decreased after IR treatment compared with the IR group. based on the results of the SF value analysis and the DSB repair kinetics, cathepsin L inhibition clearly modulates radiosensitization. the cells were analyzed at 48 h post-IR by Western blot. the results indicated that cathepsin L-inhibited, IR-treated cells underwent cell cycle arrest. therefore, we examined the expression of cell cycle-associated molecules. the effect of cathepsin L inhibition on IR-induced apoptosis we assessed the ability of. Z-FY-CHO+IR to induce apoptosis to study the mechanism by which cathepsin L inhibition affects the radiosensitivity of glioma cells. Bax and Bcl-2, two of the most important proteins associated with apoptosis, have a ratio that is considered critical for cell survival or death. to explore the mechanism by which cathepsin L inhibition promotes apoptosis, we examined the expression levels of Bax and bax. a previously unrecognized function of cathepsin L inhibition in enhancing radiosensitivity. we also described a possible mechanistic function by which cathepsin L inhibition contributes to the enhanced radiosensitivity of glioma cells. cathepsin L was observed in the nucleus after G1 phase of the cell cycle. increased cathepsin L expression in the nucleus may also be involved in its regulation of cancer progression, including radiosensitivity. alkaline gel electrophoresis comet assays revealed that the combined cathepsin L suppression and IR treatment in U251 cells resulted in distinct DNA comet tails. this DNA damage was maintained, whereas the IR-induced DNA damage was eventually repaired. this finding likely elucidated the further mechanism of action in U251 cells. high levels of cyclin A correspond to a high proliferation rate. a decrease in cyclin A induces G2/M phase arrest32,53. more evident cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase was observed in the combined treatment group at 48 h post-IR than in the IR treatment group. the balance between the expression levels of Bax and Bcl-2 is considered critical in determining cell survival or death58. the balance between the expression levels of Bax and Bcl-2 is considered critical in determining cell survival or death58. and Neng YANG participated in the experiment operation; Gang CHEN and Zhong WANG participated in the statistical analyses; Zhong-qin LIANG designed study."}
