{"summary": "TEXT Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses that cause a range of diseases in humans and animals. the report focuses on three highly pathogenic coronaviruses, two of which infect humans. MERS-CoV is a newly discovered coronavirus that caused severe pneumonia in patients in the Middle East. SSYA10-001 targets the SARS-CoV nsp13 helicase, which shares significant homology with other coronavirus helicases. the binding pocket of SSYA10-001 in nsp13 is conserved among different coronavirus helicases, raising the exciting possibility of discovering broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitors. we used three pocket-prediction programs: \"SiteMap\" (Schrodinger Suite), \"SiteId\" (Tripos Associates), and \"Q-site finder\" (9) the putative binding site comprising residues Y277, R507, and K508 was chosen for further evaluation. two of the targeted proteins were successfully prepared to high homogeneity (>90%) and in active forms. nsp13 WT, nsp13 Y277A, and nsp13 K508A (50 nM) were incubated in the presence of 20 mM HEPES, 20 mM NaCl, 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 5% glycerol, and 5 mM MgCl2. reactions were allowed to proceed for the reaction was quenched with 100 mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS, and 20% glycerol. the products were separated and analyzed by the use of 6% nondenaturing PAGE. the fraction of unwound DNA was plotted against the concentration of the inhibitor. error bars represent standard deviation of the results from three independent experiments. SSYA10-001 inhibits MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV replications with 50% effective concentrations (EC50s) of 25 M (selectivity index = >20) and 7 M (selectivity index = >71), respectively. after 24 h, the cells were harvested and a standard plaque assay was performed to analyze the effect of the compound on MHV replication. SSYA10-001 is able to inhibit replication of at least three coronaviruses. binding of SSYA10-001 has not been demonstrated in MERS-CoV and MHV nsp13. this compound could serve as a lead for the development of effective broad spectrum anticoronavirus drugs."}
