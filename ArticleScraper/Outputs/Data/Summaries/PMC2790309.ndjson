{"summary": "peptidases are enzymes that hydrolyse the peptide bonds between amino acids in a protein or peptide chain. hydrolysis of such bonds is required for removal of targeting signals. pathogens use peptidases to enter the host and to degrade host proteins for food. residues on the left-hand side of the scissile bond are numbered P1, P2, P3, etc. with cleavage occurring between P1 and P1\u2032. the substrate-binding pocket in the peptidase that accommodates the P1\u2032 residue is known as the S1\u2032 pocket. predicting where a peptidase will cleave in a native protein is difficult. despite the importance of protein cleavage, there has been no centralized repository for cleavage data collection. despite the importance of protein cleavage, there has been no attempt to curate these cleavages by mapping them to residue positions in protein primary sequence databases. collection of known cleavages in substrates has been added to the MEROPS database. for each peptidase there is a page listing known substrates. the sequence is displayed showing where cleavage occurs and which peptidase performs that cleavage. the bibliography in MEROPS for a peptidase is reviewed to find substrate cleavages with a preference for peptidases without any substrates in the MEROPS collection. each cleavage in the protein is mapped to a specific residue in the UniProt protein sequence database entry. some cleavages were acquired from the cutDB database. a bespoke program was written to parse the data to the published papers. a bespoke program was written to collect the data, translate the provided substrate Protein Identifier to a Uniprot accession. the observed frequency for each amino acid in each position is calculated as a bit score, the maximum possible being 4.32 bits. an amino acid is shown in the logo (in single-letter code) if the bit score exceeds 0.1. the letter is shown in uppercase when the bit score exceeds 0.7. each entry contains sequences sharing 50% or more sequence identity. sequence alignments were generated and highlighted to show peptidase preference. the term \u2018atypical\u2019 is used for an amino acid that has not been observed. each cleavage in the protein is mapped to a specific residue in the UniProt entry. a bespoke program was written to add each cleavage in a protein substrate. the program connects to the local version of UniProt. cleavages were acquired from the CutDB database, but have been manually checked against the original reference and the UniProt sequence. a bespoke program was written to collect the data, translate the provided substrate Protein Identifier to a Uniprot accession, and add new cleavage events to the MEROPS collection. the data collected are non-redundant. amino acid is shown in the logo (in single-letter code) if the bit score exceeds 0.1. the letter is shown in uppercase when the bit score exceeds 0.7. the second display is a frequency matrix, which is an 8 20 matrix. the amino acids are ordered so that those with similar properties are adjacent. merOPS cleavage collection contains 39 118 cleavages. the number of cleavages that can be mapped to entries in the UniProt database is 34 606, the remaining 4512 consisting mostly of synthetic substrates. the number of cleavages in common between the MEROPS and CutDB collections is 5876, of which 3424 were originally found in the literature by the CutDB researchers. the number of cleavages from the CutDB database that failed to make the MEROPS collection was 560 (9.5%), mostly due to being mapped to the wrong residue or sequence. otic signal peptidase complex (XS26-001;
