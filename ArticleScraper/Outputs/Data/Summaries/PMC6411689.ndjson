{"summary": "new antigenic variant (CPV-2a) completely replaced the originally identified CPV-2 virus between 1979 and 1980. new antigenic variants of CPV-2b and CPV-2c are still being identified. CPV-2 variants need to be identified effectively for diagnosis and epidemiological monitoring. HI testing needs at least four monoclonal antibodies (Nakamura et al., 2003) to identify CPV-2 variants. PCR coupled with high resolution melting curve analysis has been developed to genotype CPV-2 variants. however, it is not feasible to detect multiple mutation sites of CPV-2 variants in a single test tube using DNA binding dye. probe-based FMCA is powerful tool for SNP genotyping of target sequences based on the melting temperature generated by thermal denaturation of the probe-target hybrid. 113 fecal samples (30 CPV-2 fecal samples of known genotypes collected in 2013, and 83 field samples collected in 2017 and 2019) four batches of CPV-2 vaccines, and six plasmids (two as reference and four as control plasmids) were used in this study. three sets of primers and two dual-labeled probes were used in this study. the primer sets 87f-1/87r-jb, cpv-F2/ab-Rev, and probes P1 and P2 were designed to differentiate between the vaccine strains of CPVpf and CPVint. primer set CPV-1270F/1270R was used to generate recombinant plasmids. all primer and probe sequences were analyzed using BLAST to confirm their specificity. all primer and probe sequences were analyzed using BLAST. amplification started with denaturation for 5 min at 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 55\u00b0C for 15 s, and 72\u00b0C for 15 s. fluorescence from both the FAM and HEX channels was measured at each step. melting Tm difference between reference plasmid p-CPV-2 and detected samples was calculated in the HEX channel. ovirus type 2 (CAV-2), canine rotavirus (CRV), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV) and six plasmids were used to study the specificity of the duplex FMCA assay. two of the six plasmids (p-CPV-2, pCPV-2a, pCPV-2b, pCPV-2c, pCPVpf, and pCPVint) were artificially polle pCPV-2c, pCPVpf, and pCPVint were generated using the pMD18-T Vector Cloning Kit (Takara, Dalian, China) the insert fragments of the plasmids were amplified from CPV-js1 (CPV-2a; GenBank accession no. KJ754512), CPV-js2 (CPV-2b; KJ754513), CPV-js primer sets 87f-1/87r-jb, cpv-F2/ab-Rev, and probes P1 and P2 were used in this study. the primer set CPV-1270F/1270R was used to generate plasmids. all primer and probe sequences were analyzed using BLAST to confirm their specificity. green, pink, purple, and orange curves represent original CPV-2, CPV-2a, CPV-2b, CPV-2c, and vaccine strains CPVpf and CPVint variants. duplex FMCA assay was performed on a lightCycler\u00ae 96 real-time system (Roche, Switzerland) the melting Tm difference between reference plasmid p-CPV-2 and detected samples was calculated in the HEX channel. the reference plasmid was pCPV-2a in the FAM channel. duplex FMCA was performed on different days using six plasmids. clinical study A total of 83 field samples were analyzed using the duplex FMCA assay. results showed that the developed duplex FMCA assay could identify original CPV-2, CPV-2a, CPV-2b, CPV-2c, and vaccine strains CPVpf and CPVint based on the Tm values and the type of fluorescence of the melting peaks. CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c were separate from each other. the original CPV-2 and CPVpf strain were also separate from each other. the Tm values were 58.37 0.30\u00b0C, 51.87 0.31\u00b0C, and 48.85 0.36\u00b0C. the specificity of duplex FMCA was validated using DNA or cDNA (complementary DNA) samples from six CPV-2 variants and five other viruses. no specific melting peak was detected with the other non-targeted dog viruses such as CDV, CAV-2, CCV, CRV, and CPIV in either the FAM or HEX channels. dTm: Different letters indicate statistically significant differences (P 0.05). dTm: Different letters indicate statistically significant differences (P 0.05). strain CPV-js11 was detected using probe-based FMCA. results showed that the co-infected sample CPV-js11 could be easily identified using the probe-based FMCA assay. 83 fecal samples collected in 2017 and 2019 were tested using the probe-based FMCA method. of the 83 fecal samples, 41 (49.39%) were positive for CPV-2a, 8 (9.63%) were positive for CPV-2b, 14 (16.87%) were positive for CPV-2c, and the remaining 20 samples were negative for CPV-2. the detection limit of the duplex FMCA assay was determined as 1 100 copies per reaction for recombinant plasmids pCPV-2a, pCPV-2b, pCPV-2c, pCPVpf, and p-CPVint. no specific melting peak was detected with the other non-targeted dog viruses such as CDV, CAV-2, CCV, CRV, and CPIV in either the FAM or HEX dTm, \u00b0C (Mean SD) bTm, \u00b0C (Mean SD) Original CPV-2 10 55.10 0.04a 0.03 0.03 58.42 0.07a 0.08 0.04 CPV-2a 186 50.01 0.26b 5.35 0.18 58.37 0.30a 0.37 0.20 CPV-2b 72 49.91 0.29b 5.45 0.20 0.20 51.87 0.31b 6.85 0.22 CP the relative height of the melting peaks was positively correlated with the ratio of the mixed genotypes. the assay was not evaluated when pCPVpf and pCPVint were simultaneously present in the same reaction. strain CPV-js11 was detected using probe-based FMCA. 83 fecal samples collected in 2017 and 2019 were tested using the probe-based FMCA method. of the 83 fecal samples, 41 (49.39%) were positive for CPV-2a, 8 (9.63%) were positive for CPV-2b, 14 (16.87%) were positive for CPV-2c, and the remaining 20 samples were negative for CPV-2. two TaqMan probes were designed to identify six different CPV-2 variants using melting temperature difference in a single tube. a standard TaqMan probe consist of an 18\u201325 bp oligonucleotide probe that is labeled with a reporter fluorophore at its 5\u2032 end and a quencher fluorophore at its 3\u2032 end. a HEX-labeled probe was created to match the target sequence of CPV-2a. this probe allows a 1-bp mismatched hybridization with the CPV-2b VP2 gene region (A4062G) and a 2-bp mismatched hybridization with CPV-2c (A4062G and T4064A) the melting temperature differences were 6.85 0.22\u00b0C and 9.86 0.29\u00b0C for fully matched hybridization. strain CPV-2b and vaccine strain CPVpf both had a 1-bp mismatched hybridization with the FAM-labeled TaqMan probe. but only at the mismatched position was they different to each other. the same phenomenon also occurred on the HEX-labeled probe. co-infection with different CPV-2 variants has been reported sporadically in dogs. co-infections in clinical cases with CPV-2a and CPV-2c have been reported sporadically in dogs. probe-based FMCA assay was used to detect the commercial attenuated live vaccine of Vanguard\u00ae Plus 5. two melting peaks were observed in the FAM channel. CPVpf and original CPV-2 co-existed in the commercial vaccine. CPV-2a/2b variants were almost replaced by new CPV-2a/2b variants. sporadic cases of asp-300(2a/2b) were occurred. a tricolor probe-based FMCA can be developed to solve this problem. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. conflict of interest Statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
