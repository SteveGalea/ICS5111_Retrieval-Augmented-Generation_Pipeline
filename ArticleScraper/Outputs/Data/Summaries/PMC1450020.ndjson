{"summary": "emergence of hypervirulent avian influenza subtypes has underlined the potentially devastating effects of pandemic influenza. we developed stochastic models of the international spread of influenza based on extensions of coupled epidemic transmission models. restrictions on air travel are likely to be of surprisingly little value in delaying epidemics. ideally, such measures would reduce the average number of secondary cases caused by each primary case to below one. this happened during the SARS epidemic, where isolation, quarantine, and behaviour change were able to bring about control. the main value of interventions is more likely to be in reducing the incidence and slowing the rate of spread of the virus. stochastic model was used to estimate key parameters using data from the 1968\u20131969 (1968/9) influenza pandemic and to evaluate the impact of interventions using contemporary demographic and transport data. the model was used to estimate key parameters using data from the 1968\u20131969 (1968/9) influenza pandemic. a major strength of our approach is that the observed time of an epidemic peak should be unaffected even by large between-country variation in influenza reporting rates. the predicted epidemic peak for a given city was defined as the day on which the highest number of infected people first developed symptoms. we considered only major epidemics, which we defined as those peaking with at least one case per 10,000 people per day. we assumed measures were introduced only after the first 100 symptomatic cases in each city except the originating city. we also evaluated the sensitivity of the results to these assumptions. the best fit to data from the 1968/9 pandemic was achieved when transmissibility varied sinusoidally in temperate regions and was constant and equal to the north/south maximum in the tropics. best-fit SSQs approximately three times greater than those obtained when transmissibility in the tropics was set to the north/south maximum. the tropics is constant and taken as the north/south maximum. the seasonal maximum R 0 (R 0,max) is held constant at 3.0 in (A) and the seasonal minimum R 0 (R 0,min) is held constant at 1.6. the fraction of the population initially susceptible was fixed at 0.6. the model showed good agreement with data from the 1968/9 pandemic. observed and predicted times of epidemic peaks differed, on average, by 31 d. the first epidemic peaks occurred much later than might have been expected in London and Tokyo. in the northern tropics they are closer to countries north of the tropics. the southern tropics tend to be more closely aligned with countries south of the tropics [24] this occurs despite the fact that the model has no explicit assumptions about seasonality for cities in the tropics. flights are not shown when travel restrictions have been imposed by the given time in more than 95% of simulation runs. area of circles is proportional to city population size. shading indicates probability of each city having experienced a major epidemic by the given time. transmission reductions are imposed in each city after one case in the given city (A and B); 100 cases (C and D); 1,000 cases (E and F); and 10,000 cases (G and H) interventions in the originating city (Hong Kong) occur after 1,000 cases (A\u2013F) or 10,000 cases (G and H) large delays and reductions in the number of affected cities result from two effects acting in the same direction. the reduced R t slows the epidemic within each city (delaying epidemic peaks) and the reduced total number of cases reduces the rate of spread between cities. assuming greater degree of infectiousness early in the course of infection did not substantially alter the conclusions about the value of the interventions. if, however, the virus behaved more like the SARS coronavirus, with extended latent and infectious periods. a greatly delayed rate of global spread could be expected, giving more chance of delaying epidemics until the next influenza season. if travel from the first affected city was restricted to 1/128 of its former value on (and after) day 1 there would be approximately the same number of influenza cases leaving the city on day 21 + t as there would have been on day t. the highly connected nature of the air travel network prevents such minor delays between pairs of cities combining into substantial delays over the whole network. we have systematically adopted optimistic assumptions, chosen to give the interventions the greatest chance of success. we assumed that seasonal effects are important (delaying the rate of spread outside the influenza season), and that asymptomatic cases do not contribute to transmission. we have ignored travel that is not by air and not between major airports; and we have ignored the possibility of transmission during flights themselves. a new pandemic strain might not show the same pattern of seasonality as in 1968/9. a similar amplification effect could occur with an unusually virulent influenza virus that led to many hospitalisations. a new type of flu virus appears that is much more likely to kill. this happened, for example, in 1918, when a worldwide flu pandemic killed between 20 million and 100 million people. this happened, for example, when a worldwide flu pandemic killed between 20 million and 100 million people. researchers concluded that restrictions on air travel would achieve very little. this is probably because, compared with some other viruses, the flu virus is transmitted from one person to another very quickly and affects many people. a worldwide flu pandemic killed between 20 million and 100 million people in 1918. the virus does not pass easily from birds to humans, and it does not seem to pass from one human to another. the fear is that this virus might change and that human-to-human infection could then be possible. the virus would already have spread to most parts of the world. if a major outbreak was under way, banning flights from affected cities would be effective at significantly delaying worldwide spread only if almost all travel between cities could be stopped. measures could include use of vaccines and antiviral drugs if they were available and effective against the virus. the virus could spread more quickly than in previous worldwide pandemics. restrictions on international travel might be considered necessary, particularly travel by air. if they are not effective, resources could be wasted on enforcing them. information Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030212."}
