{"summary": "a common feature among many different viruses is the induction of specialized membranous compartments within the cytoplasm of an infected cell. the unique features of those structures that facilitate virus propagation are best expressed by the commonly accepted term \u201cviral replication factories\u201d this review focuses on animal plus-strand RNA virus induced replication compartments. ribosomes responsible for RNA translation and RNA-binding assembly factors are excluded from replication sites. replication factories of all plus-strand RNA viruses are built up of ribosome-free membranes. for all Flaviviridae (excess) amounts of core/capsid protein, binding RNA with high affinity, are frequently targeted to other cellular organelles such as lipid droplets. ribosomes responsible for RNA translation and RNA-binding assembly factors are excluded from replication sites. replication factories of all plus-strand RNA viruses are built up of ribosome-free membranes[7-11], and for all Flaviviridae (excess amounts of core/capsid protein, binding RNA with high affinity, are frequently targeted to other cellular organelles. plus-strand RNA virus infection is an important evolutionary conserved feature. electron tomography has been instrumental to decipher the 3-D architecture of viral replication factories. this accounts for evolutionary diverse plus-strand RNA viruses such as flock-house virus (FHV)[24], rubella virus (RUBV)[8], the two enteroviruses coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)[25] and poliovirus (PV)[26], severe acute respiratory syndrome corona plus-strand RNA viruses appear to induce one of two different membrane alterations: the invaginated vesicle (InV) or spherule type and the double membrane vesicle (DMV) type. morphologies that will be used to group plus-strand RNA viruses may reflect the use of different host cell pathways. replication factories Spherules at PM and CPVs Spherules at PM and CPVs Invaginations at CPVs Spherules at mitochondria Invaginated vesicles at the ER Diameter of invaginations (nm) 50 50 80-500 50-70 50 90 50-150 Primary membrane source PM, endosomes PM, endosomes Endosomes ER Outer mitochondrial membrane ER ER Proposed replication factories 150 nm 100-200 nm, 100-300 nm 650 nm, 150 nm 150 nm, 1-5 m 200-350 nm 90 nm Primary membrane source ER Golgi, ER Golgi, ER ER ER ER Proposed sites of replication Possible role of DMVs but largely unknown On SMT/DMV outer membrane Inside DMVs Inside DMVs. replication factories corresponding to the InV/spherule type are induced by alphaviruses such as SFV[29,30] and Sindbis virus[31], by FHV[24], RUBV[8], DENV[10] and WNV[9]. pioneering electron microscopy studies from Grimley et al[29] describe SFV replication sites at modified membranous structures, date back to the 1960s. electron tomography of RUBV-infected cells revealed InVs on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) similar to alphavirus spherules, the single membrane building up the spherule is continuous with the OMM and a membranous neck with an interior diameter of approximately 10 nm connects the spherule lumen to the cytoplasm. replicon-containing cells were connected via neck-like pores to the cytoplasm. dsRNA and replicase proteins were localized to inVs in the rough ER. ribosomes were excluded from the InVs, but localized in close proximity on ER membranes. the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM; blue); B: InVs (white) and rigid membrane sheets (dark brown) in a modified endosome (the cytopathic vacuole, CPV) in cells replicating RUBV. the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is shown in light-green. architecture of DMV-like replication factories formed by enteroviruses CVB3[25] and PV[26], SARS-CoV[11], EAV[27] and HCV[28]. structural alterations of cellular membranes were observed already more than 50 years ago. immunofluorescence analyses showed co-localization of CVB3 replicase proteins 3A and 3D with dsRNA[25] during the log phase of viral replication. the exact localization of viral proteins and RNA with respect to the rearranged membranes remains to be determined. early after infection SARS-CoV replication factories appear as presumably ER-derived CMs. reticulovesicular network of interconnected DMVs in EAV-infected cells. those observed for EAV were smaller in diameter (approximately 90 nm) membrane tubules with approximately 43 nm diameter were associated with the EAV capsid protein N. the viral replicase protein non-structural protein (NS)5A co-localizes with dsRNA. however, direct detection of the HCV replication site at ultrastructural level was not successful. no 3-D reconstruction of alphavirus replication factories has been published yet. the spherules themselves are devoid of ribosomes and viral capsid protein. the first 3-D reconstruction of a plus-strand RNA virus replication factory was published by Kopek et al[24] spherule-like membrane invaginations and rigid straight membrane sheets are continuous with the outer membrane of the CPV. CPV membranes were free of ribosomes, but frequently surrounded by rough ER sheets and golgi stacks, thus facilitating translation and encapsidation of viral RNA. plus-strand RNA virus-induced membrane alterations revealed by electron tomography. morphologies of membrane structures belonging to the invaginated vesicle (inV)/spherule type (A-C) or the DMV type (D-F) the ER is colored in light-brown, interconnected outer membranes of DMVs in yellow and inner membranes in blue. outer membranes of DMVs are shown in light-brown and inner membranes in orange. CVB3 replicase proteins 3A and 3D localize to the outside of single and double membrane structures. nascent viral RNA localizes to the outside of both single and double membrane structures. dsRNA a marker for viral replication intermediates, was predominantly found in DMVs or inside the vesicles of VPs. a comparable architecture of virus-induced membrane rearrangements was observed for EAV, a virus that belongs to the order Nidovirales. ER-derived DMVs have an average diameter of approximately 150 nm. around 50% of DMVs were linked to the ER via the outer membrane. a small subset (approximately 10%) showed a pore-like opening to the cytoplasm. the same applies to detection of viral RNA with the dsRNA-specific antibody that can bind to RNA structures present in genomes of plus-strand RNA viruses. the same applies to detection of viral RNA with the dsRNA-specific antibody that can bind to RNA structures present in genomes of plus-strand RNA viruses. replication is thought to occur on the cytoplasmic side of single and double-membrane structures[26,48] however, the fact that during the log phase of viral replication predominantly single membrane tubules are found in PV- or CVB3-infected cells[25,26] suggests that active enteroviral replicase complexes primarily reside on these membrane structures. in this case one might speculate that RNA replication ceases after membrane enwrapping and DMV sealing. RNA replication of plus-strand RNA viruses inducing invaginated vesicles/spherules is thought to occur in the spherule lumen. examples of viruses inducing this type of remodeled membranes are denoted. the neck like opening to the cytoplasm allows export of progeny RNA destined for translation or packaging. replication might occur in the interior of DMVs as long as they are linked to the cytosol. however, upon membrane sealing DMVs would contain dead end replication complexes that are no longer active. the other models described above also apply to HCV. curvature for invaginated vesicle/spherule type (A) and double membrane vesicle type (B) replication factories is indicated in red and green. examples of viral and cellular (in italics) proteins are given at the bottom of each panel. p1 of alphaviruses interacts with anionic phospholipids via an amphipathic helix. AH-mediated nsp1 membrane association proved crucial for SFV replication[58], whereas palmitoylation mutants could be rescued by second site compensatory muations in vitro. only expression of the P123 protein precursor induced spherule-like structures as seen in SFV-infected cells[61]. studies of the membrane topology of DENV NS4A revealed an ER luminal helix in the central region of the protein. this topology is compatible with the negative curvature of InVs, arguing that NS4A increases the surface area of the ER membrane on the luminal side. however, the role of NS4A self-interaction and a possible interplay with other viral factors, in membrane remodeling remain to be determined. NS4B that inhibit HCV RNA replication also alter NS4B self-interaction and morphology of HCV-induced DMVs[77], implying a functional relationship between DMV morphology and HCV RNA replication. NS3-5A polyprotein fragment is sufficient to induce DMV structures with morphological similarity to those observed in infected cells[28]. more dramatic membrane remodeling including tubular membrane swirls inside a highly dilated ER[92] implying a regulatory role of 2B in 2C membrane remodeling. however, in most cases more than one viral factor is involved in generation of viral replication factories. autophagy is an evolutionary conserved catabolic mechanism for degradation of long-lived organelles and cytoplasmic material. similar observations have been made for the Coronaviridae. MHV infection induces lipidation of LC3 that co-localizes with nsp2/3 in infected cells. however, functional studies based on knockouts of central autophagy factors led to contradictory results. EM-based studies of membrane remodeling events argues for role of autophagy in biogenesis of DMV like replication factories. autophagy might be an epiphenomenom, being activated as a cellular stress response to tremendous amounts of virus induced cytoplasmic membrane alterations, engaged in cell homeostasis and survival during viral infection. reticulon protein 1a directly binds to and recruits reticulon proteins to spherule-like membrane invaginations. it may stabilize positive membrane curvature in neck-like openings to the cytoplasm. it remains to be determined whether reticulon proteins are co-opted also by other plus-strand RNA viruses. knockdown experiments proved an important role of amphiphysins in alphavirus replication. a similar mechanism could be proposed for BMV and reticulon proteins. a similar mechanism could be proposed for reticulon proteins. plus-strand RNA viruses recruit and utilize membrane-active host cell proteins in order to generate and/or maintain replication factories. a eukaryotic cell and (endo)membrane organelles are depicted schematically as indicated on the bottom. virus infection often induces de novo lipid and membrane biosynthesis in order to increase membrane surface area, which is required for the formation of viral replication factories. de novo lipid homeostasis and virus-induced lipogenesis has been reported for a broad range of plus-strand RNA viruses. SREBPs are major transcription factors for expression of genes required for lipid biosynthesis. they reside as inactive membrane-bound precursors in the ER. they are proteolytically activated by site 1 protease (S1P) and S2P and subsequently stimulate gene transcription. in non-infected cells PI4P localizes to the Golgi and the plasma membrane. it recruits multiple factors involved in vesicle budding and lipid biosynthesis. locally elevated PI4P levels allow specific binding of the viral 3D RdRp to the membrane favoring viral replication. the closely HCV-related flaviviruses DENV and WNV do not depend on PI4KIII/ or PI4P[129,142], highlighting a functional relationship between PI4P and DMV-like replication factories. the strong dependence of positive strand RNA viruses on cellular membrane-active proteins and on pathways implicated in cellular membrane homeostasis renders those host cells factors very attractive targets. BMV replicase protein 1a directly binds to and recruits reticulon proteins to spherule-like membrane invaginations. reticulon proteins may stabilize positive membrane curvature in neck-like openings to the cytoplasm or facilitate expansion of the spherule volume by partially neutralizing overall negative membrane curvature. onine phosphatase interacting protein 2 (PSTPIP2) also belongs to the BAR protein superfamily. PSTPIP2 binds to NS4B and NS5A and thus is recruited to the membranous replication compartment[118]. Interestingly, upon over-expression PSTPIP2 induces cytoplasmic tubular membranes. PV replication factories of BFA-treated cells were shown to be inactive. however, PV subversion of cellular arf-GEFs is important for maintenance of functional replication factories. plus-strand RNA viruses recruit and utilize membrane-active host cell proteins in order to generate and/or maintain replication factories. alteration of cellular lipid homeostasis and virus-induced lipogenesis has been reported for a broad range of plus-strand RNA viruses. virus infection often induces de novo lipid and membrane biosynthesis in order to increase membrane surface area, which is required for the formation of viral replication factories. proteolytic cleavage of SREBP and transactivating phosphorylation has been observed in HCV-infected cells or upon over-expression of NS4B. but by using S1P-specific inhibitors SREBP-mediated lipogenesis was found to be dispensable for HCV replication but required for assembly and release of progeny virus[137]. PI4KIII by enteroviruses is executed via 3A-GBF1 interaction, activating Arf that in turn recruits PI4KIII to viral replication factories. Knock-down as well as pharmacological inhibition of PI4KIII dramatically decreases enteroviral replication. depend on PI4KIII/ or PI4P[129,142] highlighting a functional relationship between PI4P and DMV-like replication factories. the strong dependence of positive strand RNA viruses on cellular membrane-active proteins and on pathways implicated in cellular membrane homeostasis renders those host cells factors very attractive targets. a new field is the specific in-membrane interaction of proteins with certain lipids. the tight membrane association of proteins of plus-strand RNA viruses suggests that such specific protein-lipid interactions also occur for this large virus group. time-resolved techniques might shed light on coupling of viral RNA translation and replication."}
