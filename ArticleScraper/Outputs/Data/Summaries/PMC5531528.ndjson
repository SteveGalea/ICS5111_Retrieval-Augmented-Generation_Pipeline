{"summary": "ribosomes synthesize polypeptide chains. nascent chains of -galactosidase still bound to the ribosome are enzymatically active. nascent chains of -galactosidase are enzymatically active. ary structure, measured by intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan, starts after the polypeptide chain is 95% complete. the longest construct, with 63 residues, was recovered from bacterial inclusion bodies. important evidence that the process of folding occurs during the synthesis of a protein comes from the lower recovery of the native fold. sequences of rare codons in the mRNA, which slows down the translation at specific lengths of the protein, are concentrated at the end of the coding sequence for a protein domain. nascent polypeptide chains have high tendency to aggregate; nascent polypeptide chains still bound to the ribosome cause enormous signal interference. nsp1 is a viral protein expressed as a soluble protein in Escherichia. designed nascent polypeptide chains of the nsp1 adopt intermediates with hydrophobic clusters and significant 3D compaction. these intermediates appear with 2 of the 6 -strands and the -helix, represented by the designed protein nsp1(13\u201366) the study involves the use of purified ribosome-bound nascent polypeptide chains or free C-terminally truncated proteins to mimic the growth of a polypeptid soluble and small (56 amino acids) immunoglobulin-binding domain of streptococcal protein G to the C-terminus of the truncated polypeptides. it mimics a growing chain appended to a structured scaffold [24]. the GB1 domain has a fast and very efficient fold, which avoids interactions with any N-terminal incomplete polypeptide chain. a 20-residue spacer is long enough to allow the N-terminal polypeptides to reach the surface of the ribosome during the beginning of the synthesis of the GB1 domain. nsp1 constructs included six intermediates and the full-length chain of nsp1 protein. fusion constructs nsp1(13\u201325), nsp1(13\u201350), nsp1(13\u201366), nsp1(13\u201384), nsp1(13\u2013100) and nsp1(13\u2013111) showed CD spectra distinct from the GB1 spectrum with an increase of negative ellipticity around 200\u2013230 nm. full-length fusion construct displayed a CD spectrum similar to the nsp1(13\u2013111) truncated fusion construct. this characteristic appeared even earlier in the fusion construct nsp1(13\u201384) but was somehow obliterated in fusion construct nsp1(13\u2013100) this most likely reflects an intermediate state of folding distinct from the other fusion constructs. construct nsp1(13\u2013100) has 43 long-range contacts, considering the native full-length nsp1 fold. in contrast, the construct nsp1(13\u2013100) has 47 additional long-range contacts compared to construct nsp1(13\u201384) the 2D [1H,15N]-HSQC spectrum of the full-length fusion construct has a wide dispersion of chemical shifts. this data indicates that the nsp1 domain in the fusion construct has the same fold as the free domain. this data indicates that the nsp1 domain in the fusion construct has the same fold as the free domain. the intermediate constructs have much lower dispersion than the well-folded, full-length domain. it is clear that the intermediates of nsp1 do not have a well-defined fold. the spectra of nsp1(13\u201366) up to nsp1(13\u2013111) proteins do not overlap. 2D [1H,15N]-HSQC spectra of each designed fusion construct back-calculated with Cara v. 1.9.1.5. the bars represent the medians and the dispersions were calculated on the quartiles. fusion construct nsp1(13\u201350) to nsp1(13\u201384) has only a few missing peaks, indicating a well-folded 3D domain. fluorescence of bis-ANS dye occurs with decreasing dielectric constant of its surroundings. binding of bis-ANS to proteins is dominated by hydrophobic interactions. the fusion constructs present an average hydrophobicity of 0.51 0.03. the urea-denatured samples do not bind significantly to bis-ANS dye. the accumulated hydrophobicity of GB1 domain fused to a His-tag. the nsp1 fusion construct behaved as a globular particle with Rg of 2 nm and Dmax of about 6.8 nm. from the Kratky plots we found indications of flexible elongated polypeptide segments in all designed fusion constructs. a sinusoidal function in the Kratky plot is observed, indicative of a compact, globular structure with no major intrinsically disordered components. the fusion proteins nsp1(13\u2013100), nsp1(13\u2013111) show a reduction in Rg and Dmax compared to the theoretical and to the other fusion constructs. the fusion constructs nsp1(13\u2013100), nsp1(13\u2013111) show a reduction in Rg and Dmax compared to the theoretical and to the other fusion constructs. full-length nsp1 fusion construct presents two clearly defined minor radii of approximately 3 nm and 6 nm, which fit with the presence of the GB1 and nsp1 globular domains. the intermediates of nsp1 have consistent indications for the formation of hydrophobic clusters and after construct nsp1(13\u2013100), the presence of defined secondary structure. the most representative exception is the segment from residues 74\u201387 in fusion construct nsp1(13\u2013100) this segment corresponds to the first half of the most flexible loop in the native structure, which connects native strands 3 and 4. The signals belonging to this segment were absent in the spectra collected. orange bars represent the secondary structure propensity (SSP) and blue bars are the values predicted on the basis of the nearest amino-acid residue neighbor in the sequence using the online server: Advanced Protein Secondary Structure Prediction Server (APSSP). positive values identify helical conformation, while negative represent extended conformation such as -strands. nsp1(13\u2013100) intermediate has propensities close to zero. there is the presence of helical propensity for the polypeptide segments. the opposite propensity was shown for sperm-whale apomyoglobin, an all--helical protein. we collected 3D NOESY data for the three samples mentioned in this subsection. we noticed that they are very sparsely populated with homonuclear NOEs within the nsp1 polypeptide segments, showing almost exclusively the expected sequential dN and dNN. the paucity of NOEs is a strong indication for the lack of stable tertiary structure within the studied nsp1 segments. the smaller in strand 1 and helix indicate that these two elements are already in a chemical environment more similar to the hydrophobic core of stably folded nsp1. the conformation of nsp1(13\u201325) is very similar to that of its corresponding sequence in nsp1(13\u201350) and nsp1(13\u2013100), since the values between nsp1(13\u201350) and nsp1(13\u2013100) are below soluble and small (56 amino acids) immunoglobulin-binding domain of streptococcal protein G to the C-terminus of the truncated polypeptides. GB1 domain has a fast and very efficient fold, which avoids interactions with any N-terminal incomplete polypeptide chain during its synthesis. the attached GB1 domain behaved like the native, well-folded globular domain, with well-defined secondary structures and high 15N1H NOEs. the constructs ranged in size from 11 to 22 kDa and included, from the N- to the C-terminal domain. nsp1 constructs behaved similarly during purification and provided stable samples for at least two weeks. fusion constructs nsp1(13\u201325), nsp1(13\u201350), nsp1(13\u201366), nsp1(13\u201384), nsp1(13\u2013100) and nsp1(13\u2013111) were shown. full-length fusion construct nsp1(13\u201350), nsp1(13\u201366) and nsp1(13\u2013100) showed a CD spectrum very similar to the nsp1(13\u2013111) truncated fusion construct. this characteristic appeared even earlier, in the fusion construct nsp1(13\u201384), but was somehow obliterated in fusion construct nsp1(13\u2013100) the formation of secondary structure depends on the presence of strands 1\u20134 and helix, represented by construct nsp1(13\u2013100) the segment coding up to strand 3 has 43 long-range contacts, considering the native full-length nsp1 fold. the fusion constructs and the GB1 construct lost most of their secondary structure signal, reaching an ellipticity level around -12 to -6 deg.cm2.dmol-1. the 2D [1H,15N]-HSQC spectrum of the full-length fusion construct has a wide dispersion of chemical shifts. this data indicates that the nsp1 domain in the fusion construct has the same fold as the free domain. fusion constructs from nsp1(13\u201366) to nsp1(13\u2013111) have different conformations. median signals of the two shortest fusion constructs, nsp1(13\u201366) and nsp1(13\u201350), are very similar to the urea-denatured samples nsp1(13\u201384), nsp1(13\u2013111) and the full-length nsp1, all around 8.3\u2013 2D [1H,15N]-HSQC spectra of each designed fusion construct back-calculated with Cara v. 1.9.1.5 in order to present solely the backbone signals of nsp1. the bars represent the medians and the dispersions were calculated on the quartiles. fusion construct nsp1(13\u201325) has only a few missing peaks, indicating a well-folded 3D domain. the full-length fusion protein has only a few missing peaks, indicating a well-folded 3D domain. the fluorescence of bis-ANS dye causes a wide dispersion of chemical shifts and allows straightforward identification of backbone HN signals. the increase of bis-ANS binding does not correlate linearly with the accumulated hydrophobicity [33] in each construct. the fusion constructs present an average hydrophobicity of 0.51 0.03. it is also worth mentioning that the urea-denatured samples do not bind significantly to bis-ANS dye. large decrease in accessible hydrophobic clusters in the full-length well-folded globular domain of nsp1. the nsp1 fusion construct behaved as a globular particle with Rg of 2 nm and Dmax of about 6.8 nm. from the Kratky plots we found indications of flexible elongated polypeptide segments in all designed fusion constructs. fusion constructs nsp1(13\u2013100), nsp1(13\u2013111) show a reduction in Rg and Dmax compared to the theoretical and to the other fusion constructs. the fusion constructs nsp1(13\u2013100), nsp1(13\u2013111) show a reduction in Rg and Dmax compared to the other fusion constructs. the full-length fusion construct presents two clearly defined minor radii of approximately 3 nm and 6 nm, which fit with the presence of the GB1 and nsp1 globular domains. the intermediates of nsp1 have consistent indications for the formation of hydrophobic clusters and after construct nsp1(13\u2013100), the presence of defined secondary structure. the most representative exception is the segment from residues 74\u201387 in fusion construct nsp1(13\u2013100) this segment corresponds to the first half of the most flexible loop in the native structure, which connects native strands 3 and 4. the signals belonging to this segment were absent in the spectra collected. the orange bars represent the secondary structure propensity (SSP) and the blue bars are the values predicted on the basis of the nearest amino-acid residue neighbor in the sequence using the online server. positive values identify helical conformation, while negative represent extended conformation such as -strands. the nsp1(13\u201325) construct has only the sequence coding for the first -strand and part of the first loop. however, none of the native -strands have propensity to be in extended conformation. the opposite propensity was shown for sperm-whale apomyoglobin, an all--helical protein. us up to residue V26, residue V35, and a few residues around strand 3 and the end of the loop connecting this strand to strand 4. the polypeptide segments correspond to the native helix, 310 helix and strands 2 and 4. the GB1 globular domain in these fusion constructs exhibited a very reasonable number of NOEs, compatible with the number observed for the isolated domain. 310, have the highest, suggesting that these are the regions that suffer the greatest conformational change, from nsp1(13\u2013100) to full-length globular nsp1. the smaller in strand 1 and helix indicate that these two elements are already in a chemical environment more similar to that of its corresponding sequence in nsp1(13\u201350) and nsp1(13\u2013100) nsp1(13\u2013100) has an -helical propensity in a very similar polypeptide segment. nsp1(13\u2013100) has the highest propensity among all the secondary-structure elements of nsp1 formed after the intermediate nsp1(13\u201350) synthetic polypeptides of nsp1 do not adopt stable conformations. this is common sense for proteins studied by the use of truncated polypeptides. nsp1(13\u2013100) starts to adopt stable secondary structure. fusion constructs nsp1(13\u2013100) and nsp1(13\u2013111) acquire tertiary structure. main core for folding of nsp1 might be the helix, which starts to form with the designed fusion construct nsp1(13\u201350) there is formation of hydrophobic clusters in nsp1(13\u201366) with concomitant formation of residual non-native -helices. a second segment with helical propensity in fusion construct nsp1(13\u2013100) does not show amphipathicity. nsp1(13\u2013100) represents a crucial step in the cotranslational folding of the -barrel of nsp1. plasmid pET25b containing the cDNA encoding the six nsp1 intermediates truncated at different positions at their C-termini and the full-length globular
