{"summary": "PEDV infection causes acute diarrhea, dehydration, and even death in suckling piglets (10) since 2010, PEDV had re-emerged in vaccinated swine herds and caused great economic losses to the swine industry in china (3, 5, 7) complete genome sequence of GD-1 shared 98.3%, 98.1%, 97.6%, and 96.8% nucleotide sequence identity with those of GD-B, CH/FJND-3/2011, DR13, and CV777 respectively (2, 6, 8, 9) similar deletions could be observed in the S gene of PEDV strains GD-A and AJ1102 (1, 4), which were recently isolated in China. complete genome sequence of PEDV strain GD-1 has been deposited in GenBank under accession no. JX647847."}
