{"summary": "the global public health community has seen an increase in the number of emerging infectious disease (EID) events [1], with the majority of infectious agents originating in animals [2]\u2013[4]. countries and communities have failed to predict specific EID events and in many cases have been ill equipped to respond once a disease has emerged. surveillance of animal populations is changing rapidly [7], according to traditional methods of infectious disease surveillance in animal health. the AVSN-VPS is considered integral to the AVSN as it informs the activities of other program components, including disease investigations by ARD pathologists, epidemiologists, and veterinarians. the success of the AVSN-VPS is dependent upon ongoing participation by private cattle veterinarians in Alberta. qualitative research methods are becoming increasingly common in the animal health field [16]\u2013[18]. they have also been employed in the human health field to explore the use of health data in public health practice, as well as factors that act to facilitate or hinder use of these data. however, in the animal and human health fields, qualitative studies are rare in comparison to the frequency of quantitative studies. study participants characterized by sex, number of years in practice, practice location and type. ten were purposively selected to take part in in-depth interviews. ten selected participants were contacted individually to schedule times for individual interviews. participants were asked at the beginning of the interview to confirm orally that they had signed the consent form. each in-depth interview, conducted by KES, was no longer than 2 hours in length. all in-depth interviews were recorded using two digital audio recorders. one file was then sent to a professional transcriptionist who transcribed the interview verbatim. the error was noted immediately following the conclusion of the interview. the probes were reviewed and revised a third time after the fifth interview. the remaining five interviews were conducted during a three-week time period during a three-week time period during December 2009. field notes were reviewed after each interview and therefore informed the probes in subsequent interviews. the term \u201cfocused ethnography\u201d describes a qualitative research approach employed when what is sought is an explication of behaviour or beliefs pertaining to a specific area so that their meaning might be understood [23]. study Participants Eligible participants were linked by their experience as cattle veterinarians in private veterinary practice in Alberta and participants in the AVSN-VPS at the time the interviews were conducted. ten selected participants were contacted individually to schedule times for individual interviews. participants were asked to confirm orally that they had signed the consent form. each in-depth interview, conducted by KES, was no longer than 2 hours in length. testing provide \"flags', 'indicators', or scenarios that prompt you to consider laboratory testing more carefully\" participation in a disease monitoring and surveillance program \"what are the obstacles to participation\" \"how could veterinarians be better engaged in disease monitoring and surveillance\" the probes were reviewed and revised based on analysis of the first two interviews. the remaining five interviews were conducted during a three-week time period during December 2009. the remaining five interviews were conducted during a three-week time period. results study participants were located in a variety of practice settings in all areas of the province of Alberta. each participant came from a different veterinary practice; two participants were female (20%) vets had from two to 38 years of clinical experience. two themes and eight categories emerged from data analysis that are linked to the aim to describe the complex of factors that influence cattle veterinarians engaged in mixed-animal and exclusively cattle private veterinary practice in Alberta to submit cases to a diagnostic laboratory. themes and categories are linked to the research aims of this study. participants targeted specific syndromes of interest; cases with poor response to treatment or pharmaceutical produce failure; cases where results from diagnostic laboratory testing would inform clinical practice; cases where there was no diagnosis from clinical or gross post mortem examination; cases where there was a suspicion of a notifiable or reportable disease; atypical case presentations; cases where the economic consequences of disease were potentially high. participants also submitted samples to a diagnostic laboratory at the request of owners/producers and in instances where it was convenient. participants talked about enabling a definitive or etiological diagnosis, facilitating participant learning, improving confidence, and informing cases where there were legal concerns. participants talked about facilitating learning and building confidence, and informing cases where there were legal concerns. the economics of the cattle industry made diagnostic laboratory testing cost prohibitive. people don\u2019t even want an exam let alone take lab samples to send away. a lot of what you see is on farm looking at the rest of the herd. participants indicated that they were submitting fewer cases to diagnostic laboratories over time. they attributed this decline to a variety of factors: as you moved along in your career as a veterinarian there were fewer things you had not seen. the value of cattle has decreased, making it more difficult to submit samples. participants cited time and effort as the costs of surveillance they incurred. participants cited time and effort as the costs of surveillance they incurred. participants expressed frequently the opinion veterinarians should take more active role in surveillance. participants talked about gains through the involvement of veterinarians in surveillance. participants highlighted that the AVSN-VPS could be used to inform diagnostic laboratory-based surveillance. the AVSN-VPS received a greater number of submissions compared to diagnostic laboratories. participants described how surveillance influences the frequency of veterinary presence on farms. a farmer loses one, [...] a cow dies... he thinks it incidental, drags it in the bush and that\u2019s the end of it. when BSE hit they wanted samples from these specific ones and the ones that died were included in that. participants expressed the opinion that surveillance needed to be government driven. the government is so intent on cutting costs that they\u2019re putting their animals, their industries... The billions of dollars lost with BSE is way higher than the cost of running some extra provincial government labs. participants discussed their perceptions of government. the AVSN-VPS added to their respect for the provincial veterinarians. one participant articulated dissatisfaction with the AVSN-VPS. participants discussed surveillance outputs to inform clinical practice and increase awareness of regional differences in infectious disease burden. one participant expressed the opinion that disease had not changed much over the past twenty years. participants also cited veterinarians, the industry, and the public as beneficiaries of surveillance. participants highlighted that the role played by veterinarians had historically been different and was bound to continue to change. one participant described how much the veterinary profession had changed during their career. in a 5,000 mother cow practice, we might do four or five Caesarians. it\u2019s much smaller [the gains that can be made] so for them to quit using veterinarians now doesn\u2019t make as big an impact as it did before. the same participant predicted that cattle veterinarians in small mixed practices would no longer exist once current veterinarians retired. the fear of a reportable or notifiable disease was in part attributable to producers fearing the stigma of being the person in the community with the affected herd. some participants discussed the importance of independence to producers along with the concern that once current producers got out of cattle farming there would be no one willing to farm cattle. a number of participants raised confidentiality and privacy as of concern to producers. one participant said: \"there\u2019s a lot of less open minded people out that are very anti-government and there\u2019s also just people that aren\u2019t necessarily anti-government but that value privacy\" study participants were located in a variety of practice settings in the province of Alberta. each participant came from a different veterinary practice; two participants were female (20%) vets had from two to 38 years (median, 24 years; mean, 22) clinical experience. mes, and Categories One theme and five categories emerged from data analysis that are linked to the aim to describe the complex of factors that influence cattle veterinarians engaged in mixed-animal and exclusively cattle private veterinary practice in Alberta to submit cases to a diagnostic laboratory. themes and categories are linked to the research aims of this study. participants targeted specific syndromes of interest;

cases where there was a suspicion of a notifiable or reportable disease; atypical case presentations; cases where the economic consequences of disease were potentially high. participants also submitted samples to a diagnostic laboratory at the request of owners/producers. the reason for testing is it going to change my therapy when it comes to beef. the benefits of diagnostic laboratory testing referenced by participants included: enabling a definitive or etiological diagnosis; facilitating participant learning; improving confidence; and informing cases where legal concerns. the economics of the cattle industry made diagnostic laboratory testing cost prohibitive. people don\u2019t even want an exam let alone take lab samples to send away. people take pride in their animals and take pride in their herds. participants indicated that they were submitting fewer cases to diagnostic laboratories over time. they attributed this decline to a variety of factors: as you moved along in your career as a veterinarian there were fewer things you had not seen. the value of cattle has decreased, making it more difficult to submit samples. participants submitted samples to a diagnostic laboratory at the request of owners/producers. participants stressed that they were more likely to pursue diagnostic laboratory testing when the results impacted case management. participants talked about enabling a definitive or etiological diagnosis; facilitating participant learning; improving confidence; and informing cases where there were legal concerns. participants also talked about the limitations of diagnostic laboratory testing. the economics of the cattle industry made diagnostic laboratory testing cost prohibitive. people don\u2019t even want an exam let alone take lab samples to send away. people don\u2019t even want an exam let alone take lab samples to send away. participants referred to reductions in services provided by the provincial veterinary diagnostic laboratory system and a lack of large animal clinicians at private veterinary diagnostic laboratories. many participants reported that it was the producer who was the final decision maker when it came to submitting samples to a diagnostic laboratory. participants discussed the ability of veterinarians to influence the decisions made by producers. drivers behind participation varied among veterinarians. participants discussed the importance of receiving information through surveillance initiatives. participants said they did not often access the outputs from the AVSN-VPS. a couple of participants talked about past cases where the AVSN-VPS informed diagnostic laboratory-based surveillance. they expressed the view that they would be more engaged, and the program could be improved, if there was more diagnostic laboratory support provided through the program. participants felt frontline pre-diagnostic disease surveillance was vital to understanding disease trends, was essential as a marketing tool, and assisted in identification of outbreaks. participants expressed the opinion that surveillance needed to be government driven. the government is so intent on cutting costs that they\u2019re putting their animals, their industries... The billions of dollars lost with BSE is way higher than the cost of running extra provincial government labs. the AVSN-VPS was not viewed favourably, though the provincial government fared better. the AVSN-VPS added to their respect for the provincial veterinarians. \"something reportable is right here in our own backyard and we weren\u2019t even notified by them,\" he says. participants stressed the importance of communication, emphasizing that problems could persist if information was not made available to veterinarians and producers for use in prevention and treatment. participants cited frequently that surveillance benefitted the cattle industry. some expressed frustrations that producers were not deriving any benefit from increased surveillance. participants also cited veterinarians, the industry, and the public as beneficiaries of surveillance. drivers behind participation varied among veterinarians. participants discussed the importance of receiving information through surveillance initiatives. participants cited monetary compensation, interest in surveillance and access to diagnostic laboratory services. the AVSN-VPS made participants aware of regional differences in infectious disease occurrence. participants described how surveillance influences the frequency of veterinary presence on farms, referencing the BSE surveillance program in particular. the government is looking at cutting costs and providing bare necessity services and moving costs onto individuals. the individuals do not have the ability to pay for the costs of testing. the individuals do not have the ability to pay for the costs of testing. the AVSN-VPS was not viewed favourably, though the provincial government fared better. one participant articulated dissatisfaction with the CFIA and its handling of reportable disease cases. participants discussed surveillance outputs to inform clinical practice and increase awareness of regional differences in infectious disease burden. participants cited frequently that surveillance benefitted the cattle industry, though a few expressed frustrations that producers were not deriving any benefit from increased surveillance. participants also cited veterinarians, the industry, and the public as beneficiaries of surveillance. participants discussed the dynamic nature of the beef industry, the veterinary profession, and the relationship between the two. the next generation of veterinarians are going to do what they do for a living. one participant described how much the veterinary profession had changed during their career. he said he made a significant portion of income by vaccinating heifers. participants expressed the view that producers feared a reportable or notifiable disease. one participant expressed the view that producers would love it if the government came in and compensate them for the loss of their herd due to a notifiable disease. some participants discussed the importance of independence to producers. the only reason you farm is a lifestyle. a number of participants raised confidentiality and privacy as of concern to producers. participants discussed the dynamic nature of the beef industry, the veterinary profession, and the relationship between the two. participants discussed the dynamic nature of the beef industry, the veterinary profession, and the relationship between the

participants discussed the importance of independence to producers along with the concern that once current producers got out of cattle farming there would be no one willing to farm cattle in Alberta. a number of participants raised confidentiality and privacy as of concern to producers. one participant said: \"there\u2019s a lot of less open minded people out that are very anti-government and there\u2019s also just people that aren\u2019t necessarily anti-government but that value privacy\" the authors observed that there was data redundancy and the categories, themes and relationships between them were thoroughly described. the authors observed that there was data redundancy and the categories, themes and relationships between them were thoroughly described. there are three components of expectancy theory: expectancy, instrumentality, and valence [27], [28]. these three components play an interactive role in motivation. one of the primary goals of cattle veterinarians in private veterinary practice is to achieve positive case outcomes for their clients. participants also cited suspicion of a reportable or notifiable disease or concern for a public health risk as case characteristics that encourage sample submission. the goal may be to confirm the absence of a reportable or notifiable disease or a public health risk. participants indicated that samples were submitted when there were unusual outbreaks or in situations where large numbers of animals affected. diagnostic laboratory-based surveillance is unlikely to detect slower-moving EID events that present more sporadically or changes in trends of known endemic problems. incomplete sampling is unlikely to generate a signal in the diagnostic laboratory data stream [29] participants cited information to guide laboratory-based surveillance, greater submissions, and more timely information as gains from veterinary involvement in pre-diagnostic surveillance. participants advocated for increased government involvement in surveillance, though they stressed that efforts should be collaborative. s in private practice to submit data has the additional responsibility to provide data submitters with clinically relevant information. future surveillance initiatives and modifications to existing programs must take this task into account during design, implementation, and evaluation. results show that this approach needs to be one of collaboration and must take into account the relationship between producers and veterinarians. increased contact could prove essential to recognition of future EID events. producers could be more likely to bring animal health concerns to the attention of their veterinarian. previous work has suggested that the trust of producers is critical to event detection and response. Efforts to communicate with farmers about such programs would help to ensure cases are brought to the attention of veterinarians. the results demonstrate how the AVSN-VPS has served to provide cattle veterinarians in Alberta with a shared perspective on the burden of clinical disease in the cattle population. the results also indicate that the information produced from the AVSN-VPS has had limited utility in cattle veterinary practice. a collaborative effort between cattle veterinarians and veterinarians at the ARD could enhance the relationship between cattle veterinarians and the ARD. this type of endeavour could be invaluable during future EID events, particularly as control of past events has required cooperation among producers, veterinarians, and multiple government agencies. participants highlighted that at the time the interviews were conducted the beef industry and the cattle veterinary profession in Alberta were going through a period of significant change. participants perceived that farming has historically attracted individuals that value independence and privacy. there is inherent potential for conflict between producers and the need for improved government-driven EID surveillance. future surveillance initiatives need to incorporate an enhanced understanding of the human dimension of surveillance to encourage people closest to EID events to recognize, report, and respond. participants indicated that the expected level of disease varied between farms according to management practices. the responses demonstrate that cattle veterinarians in Alberta are an underutilized resource in terms of EID surveillance. governments face the added challenge of assuring producers they will not disproportionately bear the social and economic costs of future EID events. a decreasing frequency of laboratory submissions from participants was biased toward: outbreaks; outbreaks with unusual mortality rates; atypical case presentations; bizarre cases; and cases with poor response to treatment or produce failure. the patterns detected by diagnostic laboratory testing are unlikely to reflect disease burden in the Alberta cattle population. a large part of expectancy theory is what individuals perceive. if a veterinarian perceives a strong correlation between performing diagnostic laboratory testing and case outcome then instrumentality will be high. participants also cited suspicion of a reportable or notifiable disease as case characteristics that encourage sample submission. atypical case presentations or bizarre cases are likely to make it to the level of the diagnostic laboratory, though participants reported that it would be unlikely for the index case to be submitted. submission to diagnostic laboratories would also necessitate veterinarians to recognize that a number of cases over time were sufficiently similar to have an underlying etiology. the objective of the CAHSN is \"early detection of animal disease threats to the food supply, food safety or public health originating through bio-terrorism or \u2018natural\u2019 causes. the results reported here suggest that such efforts alone will be insufficient to permit early detection of animal disease threats. participants advocated for increased government involvement in surveillance, though they stressed that efforts should be collaborative. individual-level influences on surveillance The socio-ecological model emphasizes the importance of characteristics of the individual to intervention strategies. the results show that while monetary compensation was important, it was not sufficient to guarantee veterinary participation in surveillance. the success of private veterinarians is dependent on their relationship with producers. a better approach would be to include producers in the process of negotiating changes to existing surveillance initiatives. it is common practice to calculate the economic consequences of EIDs [35] and investigate their impact more broadly [36] projecting the economic benefits realized through surveillance remains a challenge [37] social-level influences on surveillance The socio-ecological model recognizes that changing the policies and practices of a workplace can serve to support behavioural change. in Alberta, providing the ARD with additional resources to support the activities of cattle veterinarians is an incentive for surveillance system participation that was identified by participants as essential. the AVSN-VPS has generated information about the perspective veterinarians have on health-related events in the cattle population. participants highlighted opportunities to enhance this relationship. a collaborative effort between cattle veterinarians and veterinarians at the ARD to develop a government-supported diagnostic laboratory surveillance program that satisfied veterinarians\u2019 desire for further diagnostic laboratory support. participants emphasized that surveillance relies on private clinical veterinarians to input data must generate information that is of value to veterinary clinical practice. one challenge to animal health surveillance programs is that they need to serve the interests and needs of a number of stakeholders including governments, consumers, industry stakeholders, and producers. it is common practice to calculate the economic consequences of EIDs [35] and investigate their impact more broadly. it is also impossible to pinpoint EID events that have been averted as a result of surveillance. previous work has suggested that the trust of producers is critical to event detection and response. collaboration on a list or decision tree that would inform diagnostic laboratory testing supported by the government is one approach to future diagnostic laboratory-based surveillance by the ARD. this type of approach could be particularly useful as it would enable targeted case presentations to reach the level of the diagnostic laboratory and it would heighten awareness to these cases among cattle veterinarians. the AVSN-VPS has generated information regarding the perspective veterinarians have on health-related events in the cattle population. participants highlighted opportunities to enhance this relationship, in particular the need for diagnostic laboratory support guided by the outputs of the AVSN-VPS. participants in this study identified this phenomenon and the need for the veterinary profession to change in response. if the model of private veterinary services to food-producing animals is going to persist, changes to the services provided by the veterinary profession are going to have to be economically relevant to producers. participants perceived that farming has historically attracted individuals that value independence and privacy. a component of this issue is the relative lack of attention that has been paid to the social elements of EID surveillance. future surveillance initiatives need to incorporate an enhanced understanding of the human dimension of surveillance to encourage people closest to EID events to recognize, report and respond."}
