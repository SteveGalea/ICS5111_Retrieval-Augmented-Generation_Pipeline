{"summary": "the patients were 26\u201353 years of age, and six were men. the incubation period ranged from 2 to 12 days. of the seven patients, four had recently returned from china. 7 patients who responded well to ribavirin and antibiotic treatment. serum from patient 5 was positive for mycoplasma pneumoniae immunoglobulin (Ig) M. RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV were positive in oropharyngeal swabs from patients 6 and 7; sputum from patients 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5; and serum specimens from patients 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. cytopathic effects in the vero E6 cells were first found between day 3 and day 4 after injection of serum specimens from patients 3 and 4. the number of nucleotide differences between this TW1 isolate and the Urbani (AY278741), Tor-2 (AY274119), HKU-39848 (AY278491), and CUHK-W1 (AY278554) strains was 6, 3, 12, and 10, respectively. IgG antibody to the SARS-CoV was detected by a standard indirect fluorescence antibody assay (IFA) with serial serum specimens from the seven patients. the suspension was mixed with SARS-CoV\u2013infected Vero E6 cells. slides were dried and fixed in acetone. antibody levels reached a plateau in all patients, viral RNA persisted in the serum samples from patients 1 and 2 and sputum from patients 1 and 4 for 19 to 29 days after onset of their illness. the peak level of antibody was 1:400 in patients 2 and 6, 1:800 in patient 3, and >1:1600 in patient 1. Conclusions Serologic study indicated that the antibody to SARS-CoV appeared as early as 9 days after disease onset. studies are needed to determine whether the viable viral particles existed in body fluids in the presence of high antibody to the virus. the serum and sputum RT-PCR for SARS-CoV were positive in this patient, and the sequence was confirmed. the upsurge of IgG antibody to SARS-CoV and its correlation with the progression of ARDS were evident. the number of nucleotides ranged from 29,705 (SIN2677 strain) to 29,751 (TOR2) since February 2003, at least three different clusters of SARS outbreaks occurred in different parts of Taiwan. the availability of the sequence data of different strains in a given geographic area will have an immediate impact on the effort to trace the origins and transmission of SARS-CoV."}
