{"summary": "chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is transmitted by mosquitoes. origins are traced to africa as an enzootic spillover. CHIKV is composed of a positive, single-stranded genomic RNA of 12 kilobases. chikungunya vaccines are based on live-attenuated or inactivated CHIKV, chimeric CHIKV, DNA, subunit, virus-like particle (VLP) and viral-vectored platforms. they are mainly designed to induce humoral responses against the structural viral protein E2 as well as E1. in vitro neutralising activity was achieved upon a single immunisation. a viral vectored vaccine for CHIKV is a good candidate for further pre-clinical and clinical studies. plasmid containing the sCHIKV cassette (C,E3,E2,6K,E1) and the sCHIKV C (E3,E2,6K,E1) were digested with KpnI and NotI restriction enzymes (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) to allow in-frame ligation between the CMV promoter and the Poly(A) regions contained in the shuttle plasmid. both the sCHIKV and the sCHIKV cassette C were digested with KpnI and XhoI to allow in-frame ligation between the P7.5 promoter and the TKR locus. plasmids were expanded in E. coli and a midiprep (Qiagen) was used for plasmid purifications. baby hamster kidney-21 (BHK-21) cells were maintained in Glasgow s Minimum Essential Medium (GMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% L-glutamine, 10% tryptose phosphate broth, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 100 U/mL penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. electron microscopy (TEM) Formvar/Carbon 200 Mesh Cu grids were glow-discharged in air and loaded with 3.5 L of the sample from ChAdOx1 sCHIKV vaccine stock. grids were stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 30 s, excess uranyl acetate was carefully removed using filter paper. plates were incubated with 50 L of Streptavidin-ALP (Mabtech) at 1:1000 dilution in PBS for 1 h. after another washing step, developing solution was used. Spots were acquired using an ELISpot reader. me-Linked immunosorbent assay was measured by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) mice sera were diluted in Nunc Maxisorp Immuno ELISA plates coated with E2 diluted in PBS to a final concentration of 2 g/mL. plates were washed 6 times with PBS/0.05% Tween (PBS/T) and blocked with 300 L. readout of secreted Gaussia was performed at 24 h post infection using a Renilla luciferase assay system. results are presented as 50% neutralisation (NT50) titres. synthetic gene cassette was produced by GeneArt\u00ae (Fisher Scientific, Regensburg, Germany) and named sCHIKV. plasmid containing sCHIKV cassette (C,E3,E2,6K,E1) and sCHIKV C (E3,E2,6K,E1) digested with KpnI and notI restriction enzymes. plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing using flanking primers. plasmids were digested with KpnI and XhoI to allow in-frame ligation between the promoter and the TKR locus contained in the entry plasmid MVA. all vaccines were administered at a dose of 1 106 plaque-forming units (PFU) per mouse. HEK-293 cells were grown in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% non-essential amino acids. X PBS-Tween- 5% milk and incubated with anti-CHIKV E1 antibody (1:500), followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000). electron microscopy (TEM) Formvar/Carbon 200 Mesh Cu grids were glow-discharged in air and loaded with 3.5 L of the sample from ChAdOx1 sCHIKV vaccine stock. nocytes from nave mice per well were discarded after 16 h incubation. 50 L of biotinylated anti-mouse IFN mAb was added to each well. plates were incubated with 50 L of Streptavidin-ALP (1:1000 in PBS) eluted protein dialysed using slide-A-LyzerTM cassette. mice sera were diluted in Nunc Maxisorp Immuno ELISA plates coated with E2. CHIKV replicon particles (VRPs) expressing Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) were seeded in 96-well plates at 2 104 cells per well. the next day, VRPs (MOI of 2.5) were preincubated with 2-fold serial dilutions of serum samples for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. readout of secreted Gaussia was performed at 24 h post infection. quently conservation was assessed within each clade (intra-clade; Figure 1b) using a sliding window approach. conservation scaled between 0 and 1 with 0 being fully conserved within respective clades. Q1 cut-off for conservation of each clade indicated by coloured dashed line. full structural antigens (sCHIKV), capsid-deleted structural antigens (sCHIKV C) and non-structural antigens from CHIKV were synthesised. the antigen cassette is located within the early gene E1-deleted region. supernatant was collected from HEK293 cells expressing the sCHIKV antigen. the supernatant was then subjected to sucrose gradient showing a characteristic sedimentation band. further electron microscopy preparations revealed particles of approximately 70 nm in size. a western blot was performed using a monoclonal antibody against CHIKV E1. we detected a specific band in the positive control E1 protein (lane 9) and a 55 kDa band in all the supernatant fractions from both ChAdOx1 sCHIKV- and ChAdOx1 sCHIKV C-transduced cells. sCHIKV-Cellular Responses after Vaccination. we immunised groups of BALB/c animals (n = 6) with single and non-adjuvanted vaccine dose of ChAdOx1 sCHIKV, ChAdOx1 sCHIKV C, and control ChAdOx1 NS. a single injection of ChAdOx1 sCHIKV or ChAdOx1 sCHIKV C is immunogenic. a single injection of ChAdOx1 sCHIKV or ChAdOx1 sCHIKV C is immunogenic. 96-well plates were coated with CHIKV-E2 protein. two weeks after a single vaccination strategy, specific IgG antibody binding to CHIKV protein was detected in sera from vaccinated animals. the animals increased the levels of OD405 binding to the E2 protein. a single vaccination with no adjuvant strategy is able to induce early, specific and long-lasting B responses in BALB/c mice towards CHIKV-E2 protein. a heterologous prime 1.5 month-boost 0.5 month is presented. the method we used is based on the virus replicon particle-based (VRP) chikungunya virus neutralisation assay to determine NT50 values. sera from the ChAdOx1 sCHIKV- and ChAdOx1 sCHIKV C-vaccinated groups showed high neutralisation activity against VRP CHIKV. antibodies against CHIKV-infective particles tested by in vitro model. NT50 titres were calculated using a non-linear fit of the log-dose versus response. a neighbour-joining tree was created which identified three distinct clades (A, B, C; Figure 1a) a viral-vector was used to construct the MVA sCHIKV, the MVA sCHIKV C and the control MVA NS. in addition, Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) viral-vector was used to construct the MVA sCHIKV. antigenic cassette is inserted between the thymidine kinase (TK) locus. non-structural regions were used to generate the control vaccines ChAdOx1 NS and MVA NS. in cells transduced with ChAdOx1 sCHIKV, we detected bands at approximately 55 kDa in supernatants. in cellular extracts, we detected specific bands of 35 and 18 kDa. however, no bands of 50 kDa or 18 kDa were found in the concentrated supernatant. our results suggest that our adenoviral-vectors are able to express the sCHIKV antigens which are able to induce the formation of chikungunya viral-like particles. thus, we aim to mimic a real antigen exposure of CHIKV particles. mice receiving vaccines encoding sCHIKV antigens showed high T cell frequencies after stimulation with the sCHIKV peptide pool. control group ChAdOx1 NS showed low specific T cell responses against the NS peptide pool and no responses to specific sCHIKV peptide pool. dOx1 sCHIKV C is immunogenic and able to induce specific T cell responses in mice. mice were immunised intramuscularly (i.m.) with a dose of 108 I.U. of ChAdOx1 vaccines. sera from vaccinated animals showed specific IgG antibody binding to CHIKV E2. levels of anti-E2 antibodies increased over time for both ChAdOx1 sCHIKV or ChAdOx1 sCHIKV C prime-vaccinated animals. remarkably they were maintained after 10 months upon a single vaccination strategy. BALB/c mice (n = 6 per group) were immunised intramuscularly (i.m.) with a dose of 108 I.U. of ChAdOx1 vaccines. a heterologous prime 1.5 month-boost 0.5 month is presented. ChAdOx1 sCHIKV/MVA sCHIKV showed a further 2.8-fold increase of the NT50 titre. similar increase was found in the sera from mice vaccinated with a prime-boost ChAdOx1 sCHIKV C/MVA sCHIKV C. a mosaic-based approach ensures a high coverage aimed at raising neutralising antibodies against all variants circulating worldwide. a vaccine encoding the full structural CHIKV polyprotein (sCHIKV) and a vaccine in which the capsid antigen was deleted (sCHIKV C) chikungunya-VLPs, E2 and E1 proteins from CHIKV and other viral-vectored vaccines have been shown to be capable of expressing chikungunya-VLPs. chikungunya-VLPs promote the correct conformational antigens to be presented upon vaccination, thus mimicking a real exposure to wild-type CHIKV. CHIKV-specific CD8+T cells were directed mainly against E1 and E2 proteins in C57Bl6 mice. CHIKV-specific CD8+T cells were directed mainly against E1 and E2 proteins in C57Bl6 mice. in vitro neutralisation assays are an excellent standard to test the capacity of CHIKV sero-positive serum to neutralise CHIKV. infected cells secreting Gluc can be detected as a surrogate detection of CHIKV infection. infected cells secreting Gluc can be detected as a surrogate detection. CHIKV neutralisation titres have been assessed in human sera yielding NT50 titres of 2.6x104, 1.8x104 and 1x104 in three different CHIKV patients returning from Mauritius, La Reunion and Seychelles. no licensed vaccine is yet available to prevent CHIKV infection. only one human adenovirus expressing CHIKV structural antigens has been published. adenoviral-vectored vaccines are not suitable to vaccinate humans. safety and immunogenicity should be achieved by a single vaccine dose and no adjuvant requirement."}
