{"summary": "overlapping genes are regions of DNA or RNA that are translated in two different reading frames to yield two different proteins. they were first detected in the genome of the bacteriophage X174 [1] for a long time they were thought to be mostly restricted to viruses, but computational [2\u20134] and experimental studies [5\u20139] indicate they also occur in prokaryotes and eukaryotic genomes. some experimentally proven overlapping genes are not deposited in reference databases. some hypothetical overlapping genes deposited in databases may be artefacts of genome annotation. overlapping genes often overlooked during genome annotation. we gathered a large dataset of experimentally proven overlapping genes from viruses infecting eukaryotes. we focused on viruses for three reasons: first, they contain the vast majority of proven cases of gene overlap. second, there is abundant information on the function and mechanism of expression of viral overlapping genes. we excluded bacteriophages (174 species corresponding to 509 overlaps) and viruses with a genome longer than 30 kb. most of these genomes, indeed, have not been subject to individual review. we also excluded from the remaining 1373 overlaps 93 antiparallel overlaps. viral genomic and protein sequences based on data extracted from file viral.1.genomic.gbff.gz (Release 50) from NCBI website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.niv.gov); ii) the viral taxonomy extracted either from ICTV-Master-Species-List-2011_v2.xls (http://ictvonline.org) or from the NCBI RefSeq files if not available for each genus, we chose only one representative overlap. we classified as \"reliable\" proteins encoded by overlapping genes for which there was partial experimental evidence. overlapping genes can be considered homologous if they occur in phylogenetically related genera. two pairs of overlapping genes with no apparent sequence similarity occurred in the same genome position in phylogenetically related viruses. we compared the nucleotide sequence of the 80 overlapping genes that were classified as \u201creliable\u201d. the number of genomes is lower than that of overlapping genes because some genomes contain more than one overlap. chi-square test used a chi-square cut-off value of 100.0 (1 degree of freedom; P0.00001) the consistency of the composition bias revealed by the chi-square test was checked with the Wilcoxon test for paired data [63]. principal component analysis of overlapping genes is significantly different from that of non-overlapping genes. we found genes having an overlapping coding region equal to or longer than 180 nucleotides (nt) in 894 genomes. we excluded bacteriophages (174 species corresponding to 509 overlaps) and viruses with a genome longer than 30 kb (142 species corresponding to 3440 overlaps), since curation of large genomes proved too difficult. we removed 72 overlaps out of the 124 initially identified, coming to a total of 52 proven overlaps. the initial automated analysis was performed by means of a custom-written Perl script, using 3 sources. we updated each selected genome against the NCBI RefSeq viral genome database Release 80. curation of experimentally proven overlapping genes made final dataset of 80 overlaps. for each genus, we chose only one representative overlap. for each genus, we chose as representative virus species that were human or plant pathogens. we performed remote homology searches on both proteins using Psi-Blast [59] with a cut-off of significance of 103. if two pairs of overlapping genes with no apparent sequence similarity occurred in the same genome position in phylogenetically related viruses, we tested whether they were homologous. the nucleotide sequence of the 80 overlapping genes was classified as \u201creliable\u201d. we used a stringent chi-square test to detect what elements of the feature were the main determinants of the difference. the consistency of the composition bias revealed by the chi-square test was checked with the Wilcoxon test for paired data [63]. the 80 experimentally proven overlapping genes come from 55 genera, distributed in 30 viral families covering a wide range of viruses. they belong to 61 virus species, 13 of them having more than one overlap. we added to the NCBI RefSeq genome database the proteins encoded by overlapping genes whose existence was proven but that were missing from the database. we added to the NCBI RefSeq genome database 5 overlapping genes that are experimentally proven but could not be included in the dataset because they are shorter than the cut-off of 180 nt. a large majority (60 out of 80) have a length ranging from 180 to 500 nt. the remaining 5 overlaps have a length greater than 1000 nt. the longest one encompassing 2,682 nt in Alphacarmotetravirus. the interaction was established in a virus species from the same genus, Cotton leaf curl Kokhran virus-Dabawali. the interaction was established in. interaction between proteins encoded by overlapping genes is critical for viral assembly. VP2/capsid overlap of chicken anemia virus [69], VP1/AAP overlap of Adeno-associated 2 virus and ORF3/capsid overlap of hepatitis E virus. in 2 overlaps, the interaction affects the virus replication. agic fever virus, together with GP2, interact to form a disulphide-linked glycoprotein complex that probably affects the viral entry in the cell. proteins encoded by overlapping genes can also interact in a more indirect way, by taking part in the same biological pathway. the alternative start codon is only accessible because of the use of a subgenomic RNA. more than two thirds of overlapping genes are expressed by translational mechanisms. the most common translational mechanism is the use of an alternative start codon. overlapping and non-overlapping genes differ significantly in their nucleotide and amino acid composition. the pooled set of overlapping regions (35,394 nt) differed significantly from that of non-overlapping regions (487,158 nt) for each of the five composition features examined. overlapping genes are highly depleted in the nucleotides A and T, the dinucleotides AT, TA, and TT, the amino acids tyrosine and isoleucine, the synonymous codon TAT. overlapping genes are highly depleted in the nucleotides A and T, the dinucleotides AT, TA, and TT, and in amino acids with a low codon degeneracy. PCA summarized the information carried by the 20 variables into three synthetic variables. they accounted for 31.6, 29.8, and 11.7% of the total variation in the source data matrix. in the first one, PC2 was plotted against PC1. in the second PC3 was plotted against PC1. map yielded by PC1 and PC2 revealed the presence of 3 outliers. the first is the overlap Pol/X of human hepatitis B virus. it falls outside the ellipse because of a high negative PC1 score (-26.1) CG -0.41 0.41 -0.24 CC -0.58 0.64 0.16 Arginine 0.05 0.20 -0.84 Serine -0.49 -0.30 -0.03 Proline -0.56 0.52 0.14 Tyrosine 0.18 -0.55 0.14 High-degeneracy amino acids -0.48 -0.49 -0.60 Low-degeneracy amino acids 0.91 -0.02 0.16 CGA (Arg) 0.22 0. this overlap is thus an outlier because of a strong depletion in T (-13.0%), AT (-5.8%), and TT (-5.6%), compared to the non-overlapping counterpart. this composition bias is remarkably stronger than that of the pooled overlapping dataset. only 1 outlier has a highly atypical composition bias. a small set of mammalian overlapping genes follows a composition bias similar to viral ones. we calculated the value of the 20 composition features in each mammalian overlap and in the non-overlapping counterpart. new tab The mammalian overlapping genes are indicated by bold triangles, the viral overlapping genes by empty circles. the 3 circles and the triangle outside the ellipse are outliers, that is overlaps with a composition significantly different from the rest. some of the proteins encoded by these mammalian overlaps also interact. some genera contain several overlapping gene pairs cSome genes overlap with more than one gene S1 Dataset contains the biological information that we collected for each pair of overlapping genes. the file contains not only the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the two overlapping frames but also those of the non-overlapping coding region in the virus genome. however, this biological and sequence information was not present in the previous combined datasets. a large majority (60 out of 80) have a length ranging from 180 to 500 nt. the remaining 5 overlaps have a length greater than 1000 nt. there is only a weak correlation between the length of viral genomes and that of their overlapping genes. a number of overlaps encode interacting proteins. we could identify 11 pairs of overlaps that encode such interacting proteins. a particular case of proteins that take part in the same pathway is when they interact directly. interaction was established in a virus species from the same genus, Equine arteritis virus. interaction was established in a virus species from the same genus, Cotton leaf curl Kokhran virus-Dabawali. interaction between proteins encoded by overlapping genes is critical for viral assembly. the interaction between the X protein and the phosphoprotein of Borna disease virus 1 is involved in regulating the trafficking of viral RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [77] in human papillomavirus type 16, the interaction between E2 and E4 leads to a partial relocation of E2 from nucleus to cytoplasm [78]. in the remaining 2 cases, the interaction affects a different step of the viral cycle. more than two thirds of overlapping genes are expressed by translational mechanisms (54 out of 71 cases, Table 3). the most common translational mechanism is the use of an alternative start codon. use of subgenomic RNAs is the most common (13 cases), followed by transcriptional slippage. these mechanisms are ribosomal frameshifting and transcriptional slippage. they are relatively rare, accounting for only 11 overlaps in the dataset. we performed a more stringent chi-square test using a cut-off value of 100.0 (P0.00001) overlapping genes are highly enriched in the nucleotide C, the dinucleotides CG and CC, the amino acids arginine, serine, and proline. overlapping genes are highly depleted in the nucleotides A and T, the dinucleotides AT, TA, and TT, and in amino acids with isoleucine, which is depleted, is encoded by AT-rich codons (ATA, ATC, and ATT) the three PCs accounted for 73.1% of the total variation, i.e. the reduction from 20 to 3 variables resulted in a relatively small loss of information. circles outside the ellipse are outliers, that is overlaps with a composition significantly different from others (P0.05). the star symbol near the origin of the axes indicates the pooled dataset of overlapping genes, while the black circles indicate the individual overlapping genes. the overlap NS1/7.5 kDa protein of human parvovirus B19 falls outside the ellipse because of a high negative PC1 score (-19.5). this overlap has a depletion in A (-4.8%), a strong depletion in low-degeneracy amino acids (-15.6%), and a strong enrichment in C (13.6%). the third outlier was the overlap E2/E4 of human papillomavirus type 16. it falls outside the ellipse because of a high negative PC1 score (-12.6) and a high positive PC2 score (14.5). three main variables contribute to PC2: the content in T, in AT, and in TT. the overlap Pol/X is thus an outlier because it has a strong depletion in A (-14.7%) and in low-degeneracy amino acids (-18.1%), and a strong enrichment in C (15.2%), with respect to the non-overlapping counterpart. only 5 outliers out of 80 overlapping genes have a composition bias that goes in the same direction as that of the pooled overlapping dataset. pletion in low-degeneracy amino acids of only -4.9%. enrichment in C of only 5.4% compared to non-overlapping counterpart. overlap NS1/7.5 kDa protein of human parvovirus B19 falls outside the ellipse. bias is remarkably stronger than that of the pooled overlapping dataset. the third outlier was the overlap E2/E4 of human papillomavirus type 16. it falls outside the ellipse because of the joint effect of a high negative PC1 score (-12.6) and a high positive PC2 score (14.5). compared to the non-overlapping counterpart, this overlap is enriched in A (3.0%) and in low-degeneracy amino acids (9.7%), and it is depleted in C (-2.3%) and in high-degeneracy amino acids (-1.0%). in summary, there are only 5 outliers out of 80 overlapping genes. 4 of them have a highly atypical composition bias. this overlap shows a composition bias remarkably stronger than that of the pooled overlapping dataset. the mammalian overlapping genes are indicated by bold triangles, the viral overlapping genes by empty circles. the 3 circles and the triangle outside the ellipse are outliers, that is overlaps with a composition significantly different from the rest. we can distinguish two main (non-exclusive) hypotheses that could explain this composition bias. in the first hypothesis, the composition bias would be a contributing factor (i.e. a cause) to the existence of overlapping genes. for example, depletion in T, A, and TA reduces the probability of occurrence of stop codons. arginine, serine and proline are highly enriched in proteins encoded by overlapping genes. this \"preoptimized\" composition might have favoured the retention of the overlap after its birth. we found only 5 outliers, 4 of which have a composition bias going in the same direction. we pooled their data concerning non-bacterial RNA and DNA virus with genomic length below 30 kb and we obtained r = -0.56 (not shown) in contrast, we find a weak, albeit significant, negative correlation (r = -0.27). the discrepancy is due to the use of a normalization and of a logarithmic transformation in the calculations of Chirico and co-workers [42]. recent experimental studies have revealed numerous putative overlapping genes in large viruses such as herpesvirus [94] and poxvirus [95]. the weak correlation between the length of viral genomes and the length of their overlapping genes, which we and Brandes & Linial [43] report, can only be considered proven for genomes shorter than 30 kb. researchers who sequence viral genomes need to pay closer attention to overlapping genes. this means systematically detecting overlapping genes that are likely to be expressed. this means systematically detecting, by computational methods such as Synplot2 [53], overlapping genes that are likely to be expressed. this means systematically detecting, by computational methods such as Synplot2 [53], overlapping genes that are likely to be expressed. depletion in t, A, and TA reduces probability of occurrence of stop codons. the viral genome has an unusually low proportion of TA dinucleotides. the overlapping region has a comparable proportion of TA dinucleotides. arginine, serine and proline are highly enriched in proteins encoded by overlapping genes. the overlapping region had a composition different from the rest of the genome. this

proven such genes that fit the size criteria of our dataset. PCA has a poor ability to separate overlapping genes from non-overlapping genes. overlapping genes are present in most viral families that we sampled. researchers need to deposit experimentally proven overlaps in databases.
