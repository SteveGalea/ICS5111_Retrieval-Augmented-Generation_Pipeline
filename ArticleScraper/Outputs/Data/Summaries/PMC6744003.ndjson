{"summary": "the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at OAS1 rs2660 and rs1131454 were analyzed using SNPscan multiple SNP typing methods. results No significant differences were found between the case and control groups in genotype or allele distributions of rs2660 and rs1131454. a total of 13.8 million cases of HFMD were reported in china from 2008 to 2017, with an increasing trend of morbidity and severe cases. around 45% of them were associated with EV71 and nearly all deaths were attributed to EV71. human gene polymorphisms have been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of EV71 infection. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of OAS1 gene are known to modulate the expression level and enzyme activity of OAS1 to potentially influence the susceptibility to and the severity of viral diseases[7]. so far 57 SNPs have been identified in OAS1 gene. children with persistent high fever and nervous system symptoms were classified as having severe HFMD. all the children in the control group were screened against a history of HFMD or herpangina. all the participants in this study were unrelated Chinese of Han Nationality. rs2660 and rs1131454 of OAS1 gene were selected as target polymorphic loci in this study. PCR was carried out for 35 cycles with annealing temperatures of 62 and 52 \u00b0C for rs2660 and rs1131454 respectively. the children with EV71 infection and healthy controls were compared. wethen compared the children with CNS involvement and those with mild EV71 infection. all the associations were estimated by calculating age- and gender-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) participants in this study were unrelated Chinese of Han Nationality. the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University. written informed consent was obtained from the guardians of the participants. PCR was carried out for 35 cycles with annealing temperatures of 62 and 52 \u00b0C for rs2660 and rs1131454 respectively. the children with EV71 infection and healthy controls were compared to estimate the associations of the alleles and genotypes with the susceptibility to EV71 infection. polymorphisms of OAS1 (rs2660 and rs1131454) were considered statistically significant. 108 children had severe infections involving the CNS. gender distribution was comparable between mild cases and cases with CNS involvement. s1131454 was consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in children with EV71 infection and healthy controls. distribution of genotypes and alleles of rs2660 and rs1131454 showed no significant difference between the children with EV71 infection and the healthy controls (Tab. 1), or between the children with CNS involvement of EV71 infection and the healthy controls. the genotype AG frequency was significantly higher (OR=2.27, 95% CI: 1.07-4.85) and the genotype GG frequency was significantly lower in children with CNS involvement. the distribution of the genotypes and alleles of rs1131454 showed no significant difference between the children with CNS involvement and those with mild EV71 infection. 105 59 - AG 85 45 1.06 (0.66-1.72) 1.06 (0.65-1.73) GG 11 4 1.55 (0.47-5.07) 1.38(0.75-2.54) AG+GG 96 49 1.23 (0.77-1.97) 1.23 (0.76-1.98) A 295 163 - - G 107 53 1.12(0.76-1.63) 1.05 (0.87-1.28) rs1131454 AA 61 32 - - AG 100 the age (median: 24 months; range: 8-72 months) and gender distribution (male/female: 119/82) were comparable to those of the EV71-infected children (2=0.24, P=0.62; MannWhitney U test, P=0.837, respectively) the genotypic distribution of rs2660 and rs1131454 in OAS1 gene was consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in children with EV71 infection and healthy controls. association between single nucleotide polymorphisms of OAS1 gene and severity of EV71 HFMD Genotype Mild cases(n=72) CNS involvement (n=108) Crude OR (95% Cl) Adjusted OR (95% Cl) rs2660 AA 41 59 - AG 20 45 1.56 (0.81-3.03) 2.27(1.07-85) GG 11 4 0.25 (0.08-0.85) 0.27 (0.08-0.97) AG+GG 31 rs1131454 showed no significant difference between children with CNS involvement and those with mild EV71 infection. association between single nucleotide polymorphisms of OAS1 gene and CNS involvement in EV71 HFMD Genotype Controls (n=201) two functional OAS1 polymorphic markers (rs2660 and rs1131454) are associated with multiple viral infections, including hepatitis C virus and west Nile virus[8, 9, 11, 16]. it has been shown that patients with EV71 infection with different genotypes of rs1131454 have significantly different blood leukocyte count, C-reactive protein level, and blood glucose concentration[20, 21], which reflect the severity of EV71 infection. 60 AA genotype promotes disease susceptibility, whereas GG genotype confers protection[22-24], possibly because AA genotype results in the lowest, AG the intermediate and GG the highest OAS1 enzyme activity. rs2660 AG genotype may not increase the risk of EV71 infection, but can be associated with an increased possibility of CNS involvement after infection."}
