{"summary": "most cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection have a mild outcome. some present as severe acute respiratory infection (ARDS) and require admission to intensive care unit (ICU) the main reason for admission to ICU is a pulmonary inflammatory syndrome characterized by diffuse alveolar damage. 61.2% were males with a median age of 44.3 years. 17.5% were children 5 years and 23.3% were 65 years. data on comorbidities presence were available for nearly 70% of study patients. clinical specimens that resulted negative to influenza virus detection were then screened by real-time RT-PCR/PCR for a panel of respiratory pathogens. cases which resulted negative to all diagnostic assays were further investigated by VIDISCA-454 technique. A(H1N1)pdm09 was identified in 77.8% (7/9) of fatal ARDS cases. four (4/7: 57.1%) of these individuals belonged to risk categories. HRV/hEV were the most frequently identified viruses followed by influenza A(H3N2) virus, accounting for 27.5% (11/40) and 20% (8/40) of infections. y-six (46/206: 22.3%) SARI/ARDS cases resulted negative to all diagnostic assays. VIDISCA-454 revealed no sequence reads that could belong to a novel virus or viral variant in any of the 46 specimens. most (34/45: 75.6%) cases that could not be diagnosed were ARDS and two (2/45: 4.4%) were fatal. 1% of laboratory-confirmed cases and 13% of laboratory-confirmed deaths were among persons 65 years of age or older. a marked shift toward mortality among persons 65 years of age occurred, so many more life-years were lost. the proportion of SARI/ARDS cases associated with respiratory viruses other than A(H1N1)pdm09 was significantly lower. 5\u201320% of cases of acute respiratory infection have a viral etiology. measles infection should be considered in complicated pulmonary disease."}
