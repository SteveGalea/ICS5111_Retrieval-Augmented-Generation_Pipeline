{"summary": "the domestic cat has offered enormous genomic potential in the veterinary description of over 250 hereditary disease models. the occurrence of several deadly feline viruses (feline leukemia virus -- FeLV -- feline coronavirus -- FECV, feline immunodeficiency virus - FIV) that are homologues to human scourges (cancer, SARS, and AIDS respectively) a rich literature of feline veterinary models reveals a unique opportunity to explore genetic determinants responsible for genetic diseases, infectious disease susceptibility, behavioral and neurological phenotypes, reproduction and physiology. house cats have become a familiar companion to people since their original domestication from the Asian wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica), recently estimated at approximately 10,000 years ago. sequenced six additional cats of different breeds and one african wild cat. the new reads increase the depth-of-coverage of the genome by 50%. this translates to 25% more genomic sequence. reads, assembly and mapping Assembly of the cat genome was carried out in similar method as published for the 1.9X assembly of Cinnamon[4] except in this case the Phusion method[7] was used for contig and scaffold generation. the total sequence placed onto cat chromosomes at 1.71 Gb, an increase from 1.64 Gb in the 1.9X assembly by 22%. clone sequence from ENCODE target regions to this assembly would result in a higher level of coverage across these regions than an estimated genome average. the 4% discrepancy could be due to ENCODE's selection of relatively gene-rich and highly evolutionarily conserved regions. the wild cat, Nancy, gives the highest rate at one SNP per 360 NQS bases. the rate of polymorphisms is estimated at one SNP per 600 bases. 555 SNPs detected from the fosmid-end sequence of six domestic cats sequenced in this study. of 94 variants, 92 were confirmed, one had low quality sequence traces for the cat carrying the detected variant. one variant detected from the ragdoll, Scooter, was not observed in this cat. 40 detected DIPs from the sequence traces fell within the PCR amplicons. x 272,607 164,054 503 Scooter Ragdoll 298,409 168,455 510 Speedy Domestic Shorthair 310,364 158,148 569 Cocoa Siamese 293,712 152,984 516 Nancy African wild cat 1,373,060 938,386 360 Cinnamon is listed. reads, assembly and mapping Assembly of the cat genome was carried out in a similar method as published for the 1.9X assembly the 4% discrepancy could be due to ENCODE's selection of relatively gene-rich and highly evolutionarily conserved regions. the two lowest covered regions, ENr112 and ENr113, at about 47% coverage, are ENCODE regions with no genes and very low multi-species conservation. Nancy gives the highest rate at one SNP per 360 NQS bases. compared a sequence read from Cinnamon to the assembly has increased chance of comparing to the same haploid. at the other extreme, the wild cat, Nancy, gives the highest rate since the African wildcat, Felis silvestris cafra, is one of several continental subspecies of wildcat. of 94 variants, 92 were confirmed, one had low quality sequence traces for the cat carrying the detected variant (Nancy), and one variant detected from the ragdoll, Scooter, was not observed in this cat. gDNA sample was then tested for functionality in PCR reactions with positive and negative control primers. primer pairs were tested at a concentration of 0.16 uM each in 10 ul PCR reactions containing iQ supermix (BioRad) and 5 ng of control feline DNA (Tipper sample used for first round and Speedy used for second round of QC) cycling conditions were: activate enzyme at 95C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95C for 15 sec, 60C for 15 sec, 72C for 60 sec, then 72C for 5 min and hold at 10C. a trace amount of a plasmid with a unique non-feline insert was added. the gDNAs were then diluted to a working concentration of 2.5 ng/ul. the reactions were sequenced on 3730 DNA Sequencers (Applied Biosystems) the sequence traces were then individually inspected for quality. PCR amplification of amplimers was performed in 10 ul reactions in 384-well plates. the reaction conditions were described above. in the new assembly, there are only 8 windows with less than 100 SNPs. over 80% of the 15 kb windows across the genome contain at least one category A SNP. over 80% of the 15 kb windows across the genome contain at least one category A SNP. 55,010 110,129 192,266 1,983 991 567 chrB1 131,184,541 62,260 118,189 196,456 2,107 1,110 668 chrB2 101,553,943 49,898 95,152 161,014 2,035 1,067 631 chrB3 96,970,780 47,679 93,489 167,719 2,034 1,037 5 877 1,868 997 541 chrF2 56,475,142 29,011 55,998 93,247 1,947 1,009 606 chrX 83,845,181 19,431 32,619 65,352 4,315 2,570 1,283 chrUnCf 217,904,849 101,325 198,166 323,505 2,151 1,100 674 chrUn. if a SNP is selected every 15 kb from the category A SNPs, 80% of the genome can be covered. the remaining 20% can be filled in with more widely spaced category A SNPs, or using additional category B or C SNPs. another 20 k genotype assays for the remaining regions would yield a 120 k SNP chip. on chromosome X there are 34 windows with less than 100 SNPs per Mb across the autosomes. the effect population size for the X chromosome is 34 that of the autosomes, and 3) male hemizygosity allows much stronger purifying selection to occur around X-linked functional loci. over 80% of the 15 kb windows across the genome contain at least one category A SNP. the fraction of windows with one or more SNPs for a range of window sizes and three categories of SNPs. 41 638 chrC1 160,223,031 76,483 147,928 245,762 2,095 1,083 652 chrC2 107,198,630 53,479 98,226 163,338 2,004 1,091 656 chrD1 81,705,395 45,881 88,125 130,989 1,781 927 624 chrD2 67,243,459 37, there are 964,285 SNPs discovered from at least one of the six breeds sequenced (category A SNPs in Table 2). A SNP will not be informative unless it has a minor allele frequency (MAF) of at least 5%. however, the MAFs of these SNPs are not known until they have been genotyped. wildcat Nancy was identified as wild-caught 15 years ago in the Arabian Peninsula, so she should geographically fall into the African subspecies Felis silvestris lybica. a STRUCTURE analysis was completed using a genomic DNA sample from Nancy, and genotypes from 18 of the 36 short tandem repeat loci were used to resolve genomic distinctions. the insert sizes are all about 40 kb in size with fairly tight distributions of less than 10% coefficient-of-variation. paired-end reads could pinpoint structural rearrangements among cat breeds using available methods[22]. Availability and requirements All SNPs and DIPs described are freely available through dbSNP [5] and through the web browser interface [6]. table S3 lists variants by position on the genome assembly, which alleles are expected. pink colored cells indicate the cat(s) from which the alternate allele was discovered in the light whole genome sequence."}
