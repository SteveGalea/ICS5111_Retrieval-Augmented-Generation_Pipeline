{"summary": "as people age, the burden of chronic disease rises sharply. by 2030 there will be three times more elderly people over 65 years old. each person above 65 is four times more likely to be hospitalised. the government is taking a larger share of the overall healthcare expenditure. the other part is because of rising healthcare costs. if we continue with the current models of care delivery, we will be able to continue with the current models of care delivery. many developed countries today meet the gap by importing trained healthcare workers from other countries. but emerging countries too will have the capacity to absorb more of the trained manpower. the answer is 'no', as most healthcare systems are not really structured for this change. a focus on public health and primary care is necessary to help us deal with this problem, but it will not be sufficient. if we are able to deal with the massive increases in chronic diseases, the large number of elderly people coming in with multiple medical problems will demand even more. a focus on public health and primary care is necessary to help us deal with this problem, but it will not be sufficient. the vision for healthcare 2020 revolves around three major pillars. the first is enhancing access, which involves expanding infrastructure such as physical buildings and engaging the private sector. the second is a greater focus on primary care by engaging and supporting general practitioners through family medicine clinics. many of the steps that we have taken across the healthcare system are aimed at right-siting to primary care or step-down care. many of the steps that we have taken across the healthcare system are aimed at right-siting to primary care or step-down care. in most hospitals, we also have completely automated pharmacy systems. all these result in tremendous savings in manpower usage. also improve on workflows. IMAGINING THE HEALTH SYSTEM OF THE FUTURE This leads me to the next segment of my presentation, which is really about imagining what the healthcare system of the future will look like. if we think about health needs of patients or the community, it revolves around a stronger focus on bringing together different elements. the early psychosis intervention programme was spearheaded by Prof Chong Siow Ann from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) it took nearly three years before someone who had symptoms was diagnosed. the team decided that they needed to detect patients early. to address this problem, they created a wide network of community partners. three times a year, students visit 500 households living in rental flats in Taman Jurong. they also help patients who have chronic diseases improve medication compliance through education. one project they took up was blood pressure control, which improved from 27% to 73%. behavioural sciences provides us with rich information on how we can do this better. behavioural sciences provides us with rich information on how we can do this better. behavioural sciences provides us with rich information on how we can do this better. a number of patients with non-complex diseases are being referred to the SOCs. in the future, we need to transfer them to supervised empowered care in their own homes. if we focus on this 8%, we can theoretically release another 14% of hospital bed-day capacity. patients with single/multiple conditions, frequent admitters and elderly patients with multiple medical problems could be looked after by primary care teams. from a primary care team point of view, each team must be able to see substantially more patients than if they were operating under the current face-to-face consultation model. the idea is not to merely treat the patient and fill up the facilities so that we have to build more and more of them. fibre bed is able to measure a patient\u2019s heart and respiratory rates while the patient lies on it, as well as display the results. it is able to measure a patient\u2019s heart and respiratory rates while the patient is lying on it, as well as display the results. a fibre chair is now working on a bed that can measure electrocardiogram (ECG) spirometers can be built at a cost of less than ten dollars per piece. they can also be easily enabled by Bluetooth to measure expiratory flow rate. there are now three-dimensional visualisation glasses that can conjure up holographic panels. there are some fundamental things that go beyond technology and clinical care components that will decide whether these things can happen or not. the main thrust is to deliver as good or even better quality care, with greater convenience and at lower costs for the patient and health system. the real challenge is not the development of component parts, as many have already been developed, assembled and implemented.
