{"summary": "the world health organization (WHO) closely examines such concerns in order to have an effective health system. for 50 years, we have been confronted with the end of the golden age of antibiotic discovery, while some antimicrobial substances have existed for years. the use of an antibiotic and the emergence of its resistance are inevitable and intrinsically linked (Mohr, 2016). 178 (93%) Klebsiella pneumoniae had KPC enzymes (carbapenemases), with 76 (43%) resistant to colistin (Monaco et al., 2014). last-line treatments may no longer be effective, increasing the risk of spreading infections. alternative to last resort treatments must be considered to avoid treatment failure. this review focuses on drug repurposing, also called repositioning. this therapeutic shift is the subject of several studies in different pathologies. in general, the most common bacteria are first tested or those most at risk or in a therapeutic deadlock. a few articles are published on this specificity for which we are striving to synthesize them. we will define drug repurposing and its characteristics. we will then make an inventory of what has already been published as a drug. drug repurposing presents real economic advantages. it is possible to skip preclinical trials because toxicity and pharmacokinetic are already known. repurposing drugs can offer new pathways or targets to study new perspectives for curing diseases. three major methods can lead a drug to be repurposed. first, phenotypic assay can be performed by high throughput and screening of commercial, public, pharmaceutical compound libraries. phenotypic tests have the advantage of being highly physiologically relevant because the effect is observed directly on bacteria. a drug class is assigned to a molecule to describe and group similary together drugs because of their therapeutic use, their biochemical mechanism, by their way of action or their chemical structure. the current trend therefore seems to be moving away from this definition. drug repurposing presents real economic advantages. it is possible to skip preclinical trials because toxicity and pharmacokinetic are already known. repurposing drugs can offer new pathways or targets to study new perspectives for curing diseases. three major methods can lead a drug to be repurposed. first, phenotypic assay can be performed by high throughput and screening of commercial, public, pharmaceutical compound libraries. these assays consist in classical broth microdilution to identify a hit. the last approach is random discovery and can include all types of configurations. the side effects of one drug in one disease may be effective for another, such as for the antidepressant bupropion reoriented as an anti-tobacco drug. however, these unexpected observations could also be identified by informatics methods. five-fluorouracil and 6-thioguanine seemed to be the best candidates for repurposing to treat MDR clinical A. baumannii. their IC90 values or MIC were lower than standard plasma drug concentration levels in human, suggesting a possible use without major adverse events. son-Banning et al., 2013 Oncology 5-fluorouracil Antineoplastic Zidovudine A. baumannii Carbapenems Cheng et al., 2019 Mitotane Antineoplastic Polymyxin B A. baumannii P. aeruginosa K. pneumoniae Carbapenems Polymyxin Tran et al., 2018 Gallium Antineoplastic Alone ESKAPE species all mechanisms of action and targets are considered because the objective is to escape therapeutic drug classes. an antifungal agent developed nearly forty years ago, ciclopirox, also has good repurposing criteria. a phase 2 trial in cystic fibrosis patients assess the activity of gallium and suggests its safety and efficacy for human infections. this once again represents potential and promising targets for the control of infectious germs. mDR enterobacterial infections has revived the forgotten antibacterial properties of this drug mentioned for the first time in 1986. a series of Enterobacteriaceae with different colistin resistance profiles (mcr-1 gene, mgrB or pmrB mutations) its antibacterial action was confirmed with MICs ranging from 0.2 and 6.25 M. AZT can be a recovery therapy against MDR bacteria. some molecules have the advantage of not being used alone. combination studies with another drug may be considered in order to use it effectively. antibiotics Research in repurposing for combination with known antibiotics on carbapenem and colistin-resistant bacteria has been conducted in association with polymyxins drugs (Table 1). Niclosamide, an anthelmintic drug, known to be active against most tapeworms, seems to interact with the negatively charged outer membrane of colistin-resistant strains leading to a synergistic effect with colistin. this effect was observed on 18 strains with 13 colistin-resistant the effect is more or less strong but as for neuroleptics (prochlorperazine, chlorpromazine, promazine) associated with meropenem appear to be effective against MDR A. baumannii. only spironolactone showed non-toxic levels of minimum concentration for synergy with polymyxin B against E. coli isolates. resveratrol was active alone and in synergy with streptomycin and ciprofloxacin. pterostilbene is known for its anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. eugenol is a phenylpropanoid present in essential oil of many plants. all these molecules are still being tested in vitro or in clinical trials. none have yet received new indication for MDR infection treatment. research on drug repurposing is gaining new dynamism if we can refer to the number of annual publications in recent years. drug repurposing for combination with known antibiotics on carbapenem and/or colistin-resistant bacteria has mainly been conducted in association with polymyxins drugs (Table 1). Niclosamide, an anthelmintic drug, known to be active against most tapeworms, seems to interact with the negatively charged outer membrane of colistin-resistant strains leading to a synergistic effect with colistin. efflux pump inhibitors did not have an effect on bacteria alone. combined with an antibiotic, they demonstrated restoration of its activity. effect is more or less strong but as for neuroleptics associated with meropenem appear to be effective against MDR A. baumannii. the stilbene and polyphenol resveratrol is produced by various plants (as grapes and blueberries) it is known to have various antioxidant properties and chemopreventive activities. it was active alone and in a synergy with streptomycin and ciprofloxacin. pterostilbene appears to enhance polymyxin activity in vitro and in vivo. mcr-1 gene expression was down regulated by eugenol and suggested a possible binding between eugenol and MCR-1 protein. all these molecules are still being tested in vitro or in clinical trials. fecal microbiota (Davido et al., 2017), antimicrobial peptides (Hashemi et al., 2017) or bacteriophages (Parmar et al., 2017). a Streptomyces sp. present in alkaline soil in Ireland has been in the spotlight recently to inhibit growth of MDR bacteria (Terra et al., 2018) the problem remains to be able to routinely test a large panel of molecules, in an automated, reproducible, and not too expensive way. the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
