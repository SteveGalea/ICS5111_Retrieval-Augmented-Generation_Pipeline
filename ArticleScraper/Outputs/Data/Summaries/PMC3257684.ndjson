{"summary": "the topic of immunoglobulins in milk immediately brings to mind the relationship between mother\u2019s milk, transfer of passive immunity from mother to neonate, and the immature immune system of the neonate. the immunoglobulins are transported through the mammary epithelial cells by receptor-mediated mechanisms and transferred out of the mammary gland by milk ejection during suckling. review begins with summary of some of the research on what has been termed \u201cimmune milk\u201d and then discusses various aspects of immunoglobulins in mammary secretions. traits related to stability and processing methods for collecting milk immunoglobulins are reviewed. the ability to direct the cow\u2019s immune system to produce antigen-specific antibodies that are secreted in colostrum and milk. breast feeding is associated with a reduced incidence of Campylobacter diarrhea in young children compared with children that do not breast feed. breast milk may not contain IgA antibodies specific for the common antigen of Campylobacter [37], suggesting a degree of antigen specificity contained in the breast milk. the idea of immunizing the pregnant animal with the intent of controlling neonatal morbidity and mortality is well established. heterologous transfer of passive immunity set the stage for considering the opportunities for heterologous passive transfer. colostrum milk products generally are some form of protein product derived from dairy cattle. cows typically are hyperimmunized against one or more antigens representing pathogens of bacterial or viral origin. milk from cows immunized with a heat-killed, lyophilized mixture of bacteria found to reside in the human gastrointestinal tract has been studied. most studies on the use of immune milk have examined the potential of immune milk for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. milk from non-immunized cows also has been found to contain measurable antigen-binding activity against several human pathogenic bacteria. treatment of children with hyperimmune bovine colostrum from cows immunized with human rotavirus serotypes reduces the duration and severity of diarrhea due to rotavirus. 80% of children\u2019s stools became negative for the E. coli strains used to hyperimmunize the cows that provided the source of immunoglobulin. only one in nine children treated with the immunoglobulin concentrate developed negative stools. 90% of volunteers who received control immunoglobulin concentrate prior to challenge developed diarrhea after the E. coli challenge. subsequent studies using IgG isolated from bovine colostrum from cows hyperimmunized against specific E. coli colonization factor antigens also have shown protective effects. colostral whey preparation reduced adherence of Streptococcus mutans in vitro. antibodies in the whey preparation remained functional when added to milk that had been treated via ultra-high temperature pasteurization or milk that was fermented to extend shelf-life. in a child with AIDS who had severe diarrhea caused by cryptosporidiosis, administration of a commercial hyperimmune bovine colostrum preparation with anticryptosporidial activity improved the diarrhea. the immunization regimen occurs during the prepartum period of the cow. most dairy cattle will have their first calf early in their third year, marking the start of their first lactation. mastitis is the major disease in dairy cattle and most often is caused by intramammary infection. effective vaccines against mastitis-causing pathogens can increase antigen-specific immunoglobulins in the serum. the immunization also may be causing the mammary gland to become hyper-responsive to bacterial challenge. immunization protocols range from immunizations during the dry period [97], to peak lactation [98], and even late lactation [99]. intramammary immunization also can result in an increase in antigen-specific immunoglobulin in milk, as well as in the serum [100,101,102,103]. antigen can be achieved with antigen encapsulated in biodegradable microspheres. transgenic animals also have been used to produce antigens. the ability to direct the cow\u2019s immune system to produce antigen-specific antibodies that are secreted in colostrum and milk. the widespread consumption of immune milk from cows inoculated against diseases such as avian influenza has been suggested as a potential means of slowing outbreaks. infants consuming breast milk may not contain IgA antibodies specific for the common antigen of Campylobacter [37], suggesting a degree of antigen specificity contained in the breast milk. the idea of immunizing the pregnant animal with the intent of controlling neonatal morbidity and mortality is well established. heterologous transfer of passive immunity set the stage for considering the opportunities for heterologous passive transfer. colostrum milk products generally are some form of protein product derived from dairy cattle. cows typically are hyperimmunized against one or more antigens representing pathogens of bacterial or viral origin. rheumatoid arthritis, high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and oral submucous fibrosis have been studied. most studies on the use of immune milk have examined the potential of immune milk for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, particularly gastrointestinal disease. milk that does not come form hyperimmunized cows may in some sense be considered as immune milk. 80% of childrens\u2019 stools became negative for the E. coli strains used to hyperimmunize the cows that provided the source of immunoglobulin in a bovine colostrum/milk immunoglobulin concentrate consumed by children for 10 days. only one in nine children treated with the immunoglobulin concentrate developed negative stools, underscoring the importance of the bacterial strain-specificity of the immune product. bovine colostrum concentrate preparations derived from cows that have not been hyperimmunized against specific antigens also may provide some benefit via passive immunization for some diseases. similar preparations from non-immunized cows may provide protection against bacterial toxins that are the cause of diarrhea in AIDS patients. the colostral whey preparation reduced adherence of Streptococcus mutans in vitro and caused aggregation of suspended bacteria. antibodies in the whey preparation remained functional when added to milk that had been treated via ultra-high temperature pasteurization or milk that was fermented to extend shelf-life [75] administration of a commercial hyperimmune bovine colostrum preparation with anticryptosporidial activity improved the diarrhea and eliminated the parasite. the immunization regimen occurs during the prepartum period of the cow. most dairy cattle will have their first calf early in their third year, marking the start of their first lactation. effective vaccines against mastitis-causing pathogens can increase antigen-specific immunoglobulins in the serum. in the case of the J5 E. coli bacterin vaccine, the immunization also may be causing the mammary gland to become hyper-responsive to bacterial challenge. immunization protocols range from immunizations during the dry period [97], to peak lactation [98], and even late lactation [99]. intramammary immunization also can result in an increase in antigen-specific immunoglobulin in milk, as well as in the serum [100,101,102,103]. immunoglobulins, or antibodies, found in colostrum or milk are the same as those found in the blood or mucosal secretions. they are a family of proteins with a range of protective bioactivities. IgG, IgA and IgM are the major immunoglobulin classes in mammary secretions. each immunoglobulin molecule has two antigen binding sites. the Fab includes the variable amino acid domain. the constant fragment (Fc) confers the identity of an immunoglobulin as a particular subclass. human colostrum has a low content of IgG (2%) and the IgG required to provide systemic immunity is transferred across the placenta before birth. colostral IgG content in many other species is typically greater than 75% of the total immunoglobulin content. high concentration of IgG in colostrum declines rapidly with successive milkings. role of colostrum and milk immunoglobulins is to provide immune protection both systemically and for the gastrointestinal tract. for many species the proportion of IgA increases between colostrum and milk. in is internalized via an endocytic mechanism [121], transported to the apical end of the cell and released into the alveolar lumen. the receptor responsible for transcytosis of IgG into colostrum is referred to as FcRn. it was initially identified in the neonatal rodent intestine as the receptor responsible for the specific uptake of maternal IgG. the majority of the IgG2 taken up by the mammary epithelial cell during colostrum formation is not passed on to the alveolar lumen, but rather is recycled back to the extracellular fluid. this is supported by studies of overexpression of FcRn in transgenic mice where there is an extension of the half-life of serum IgG. RT gene, coding for the MHC Class I -chain of FcRn, are associated with serum concentrations of IgG in neonatal beef calves [143] haplotypes of the 2-microglobulin gene (2M) also are associated with serum IgG concentrations in newborn calves [143] 10% of cows had mass transfer greater than one standard deviation above the mean. lymphocytes from the GALT system migrate to the mammary gland. this means that maternal colostrum and milk will contain antibodies specific for pathogens that may be encountered by the neonate\u2019s intestine. sIgA and sIgM provide the neonatal intestine a level of protection through their immune exclusion actions and anti-inflammatory effects. polymeric IgA or IgM bound to pIgR is internalized and transported to the apical end of the mammary epithelial cell by an endocytic process. in the case of pIgR receptor sites that are not occupied by immunoglobulin, the secretory component is still cleaved from the membrane-bound portion of pIgR. the secretory component has protective effects of its own, potentially blocking epitheli the receptor-bound immunoglobulin is internalized via an endocytic mechanism [121]. the receptor responsible for transcytosis of IgG into colostrum is referred to as FcRn. it was initially identified in the neonatal rodent intestine as the receptor responsible for the specific uptake of maternal IgG. the majority of the IgG2 taken up by the mammary epithelial cell during colostrum formation is not passed on to the alveolar lumen, but rather is recycled back to the extracellular fluid. this is supported by studies of overexpression of FcRn in transgenic mice where there is an extension of the half-life of serum IgG [133,134] haplotypes of the FCGRT gene, coding for the MHC Class I -chain of FcRn, are associated with serum concentrations of IgG in neonatal beef calves. 10% of cows had mass transfer greater than one standard deviation above the mean, perhaps indicating a genetic or hormonal regulation of the variance of transport. maternal colostrum and milk will contain antibodies specific for pathogens encountered by the neonate\u2019s intestine and other mucosal tissues. transepithelial transport of IgA and IgM across the mammary epithelial cells occurs via the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) only IgA or IgM that contain the J chain have a high affinity for pIgR [116,151,152]. polymeric IgA or IgM bound to pIgR is internalized and transported to the apical end of the mammary epithelial cell by an endocytic process. the pIgR molecule is cleaved to release a receptor fragment, called secretory component (SC), which remains bound to the immunoglobulin molecule. the secretory component has protective effects of its own, potentially blocking epithelial adhesion of enter in ungulate species such as cattle, sheep, goats and pigs, the young are born essentially agammaglobulinemic. the intestinal uptake in the immediate period after birth is transient and nonselective. the intestinal cells become unable to absorb macromolecules within 24-36 h after birth probably due to developmental processes occurring in the enterocytes. in adults of a pIgR-deficient strain of mice, there is an increased serum IgA and IgG that react with commensal organisms and food antigens. this may be because sIgA is not being secreted into the intestinal lumen to participate in its role in immune exclusion. this may be because sIgA is not being secreted into the intestinal lumen to participate in its role in immune exclusion. colostrum and milk contain oligosaccharides that function as analogues of microbial ligands on mucosal surfaces. oligosaccharides that function as analogues of microbial ligands on mucosal surfaces, antimicrobial heat stable peptides (defensins), and soluble CD14. colostrum and milk contain leukocytes, including activated neutrophils, macrophages intracellular immune exclusion occurs when sIgA is being transcytosed by the enterocytes and comes into contact with viral particles within the endosomic system [15] secretory IgA neutralizes pathogens in the intestinal lumen and internalizes into intestinal epithelial cells. this suppression of the proinflammatory mechanisms is counterbalanced by systemic immune factors, including systemic IgG. an IgG Fc binding site has been identified in association with the intestinal mucus. the binding protein blocks passage of IgG-antigen complexes to the enterocyte surface, thereby blocking their uptake and transport to the lamina propria. colostrum also may impact immunological development of the neonate. intestinal cells become unable to absorb macromolecules within 24-36 h after birth. enterocytes will nonselectively absorb large molecular weight proteins and other molecules. failure of passive transfer of immunity in these species is defined as occurring when a threshold concentration of IgG is not reached before closure occurs. colostrum and milk contain antimicrobial factors and factors that may impact the immune system. colostrum contains leukocytes, including activated neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes. colostrum contains cytokines and growth factors that may affect neonatal intestinal development. colostrum provides a source of energy which may impact IgG absorption in the neonate. some portion of macromolecules is transported across the intestine intact. some portion of the immunoglobulin consumed in an immune milk can be expected to be partially or completely digested. antigens are part of oral tolerance mechanisms in the intestine [158], counterbalanced by systemic immune factors, including systemic IgG. post-closure uptake of IgG can occur via the FcRn receptor. intestinal FcRn may deliver IgG-antigen immune complexes to the enterocyte for immune processing [158,177] colostrum or milk immunoglobulins are harvested at milking and undergo various types of processing. they are exposed to a number of conditions that may alter the structure and function of the protein. some methods used to concentrate or isolate the immunoglobulins include steps that involve exposure to heat, acid or pressure. pepsin digestion of IgG yields an F(ab\u2019)2 fragment that includes the two antigen-binding sites of the IgG molecule. in the small intestine, immunoglobulins are further digested by pancreatic enzymes. bovine IgG1 is more susceptible to hydrolysis by pepsin than IgG2. in vitro incubations of IgA and IgG with small intestinal content of young lambs have shown that IgA is more resistant to digestion than is IgG [17] in adult humans consuming a bovine whey protein concentrate, approximately 59% of IgG and IgM was detected by radial immunodiffusion from effluents from the jejunum. in adult humans consuming a bovine whey protein concentrate, approximately 59% of IgG and a pepsin-resistant form of bovine IgG representing approximately 10% of colostral immunoglobulin has been isolated with a lectin that binds O-linked oligosaccharides. the pH of bovine mammary secretions transiently drops at calving (to approximately pH 6.4), then increases over several days to pH 6.6 to 6.9 [206], which is the pH characteristic of mature milk. antigen-binding activity of bovine IgG also reduced after heat treatment. detecting IgG in colostrum or colostral whey also reduced by heat treatment. thermal protectants such as sugars or glycerol can increase stability of isolated IgG to heat treatment. high voltage pulsed electric fields have been used as a nonthermal processing method for pasteurization in various foods. microbial inactivation in bovine IgG solutions as a result of pulsed electric fields did not change the secondary structure or the thermal stability of the secondary structure of the IgG. high-pressure processing is another non-thermal method with the potential for inactivation of microbial and certain enzymes in food products. the stored colostrum then is fed to newborn calves to assure adequate uptake of IgG for protection of the calf. colostrum may contain pathogens as a result of shedding from the mammary gland, contamination of the colostrum after harvesting or improper storage of colostrum prior to feeding to the calves. immunoglobulins are exposed to a number of conditions that may alter the structure and function of the protein. some methods used to concentrate or isolate the immunoglobulins include steps that involve exposing the protein to heat, acid or pressure. some methods have been used for isolation of immunoglobulins from colostrum or milk. in the small intestine, immunoglobulins are further digested by pancreatic enzymes. one of them, trypsin, preferentially digests bovine IgG1 over IgM. another enzyme, chymotrypsin, preferentially hydrolyzes IgM over IgG. detecting immunoglobulin in stool samples of infants fed the same immune product accounted for 10% of the ingested immunoglobulin [58] in adults fed a bovine immunoglobulin concentrate, fecal IgG was typically less than 4% of ingested dose [204] encapsulation of the immunoglobulin product can significantly increase the IgG detectable in the stool [204], although only low levels of IgG are detectable in the ileum of adults studies of isolated immunoglobulin stability indicate that bovine IgG isolated from milk is stable for several hours at 37 \u00b0C when in pH 6-7, however stability is significantly reduced at pH 3 and 10 [207,208] the negative effect of pH on IgG stability, even in the range of 4.5-6.5, is enhanced under elevated temperature conditions. many milk processing protocols include heat treatment of the colostrum, milk or whey. commercial milk samples that have undergone a typical pasteurization process can retain 25-75% of the IgG concentration compared with raw milk. antigen-specific IgG in milk is relatively stable under typical conditions of pasteurization. high-pressure processing is another non-thermal method with the potential for inactivation of microbial and certain enzymes in food products. high-pressure processing also has been used for human breast milk with minimal effect on the milk IgA. heat treatment of colostrum at 60 \u00b0C for one hour results in higher concentrations of serum IgG and greater apparent absorption efficiency of IgG in new born calves consuming the treated colostrum. the immunoglobulins in colostrum and milk can form an important link between the immunological experience of the mother and the immune capacity of the newborn. cows immunized against specific pathogens provide a medium for the heterologous transfer of passive immunity, and may offer disease protection in a range of species. new technologies for enhancing efficacy of vaccination may enhance future use of colostrum and milk based on their potent immunological activity."}
