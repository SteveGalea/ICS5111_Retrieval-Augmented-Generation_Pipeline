{"summary": "the mortality rate in piglets is extremely variable, ranging from 0 to 50%. the loss in growth in recovered piglets is economically the most important effect of the disease. there are three groups of rotaviruses that affect humans and animals. rotavirus nonstructural protein NSP4 has recently been suggested to have a toxin-like function. gut mucosal immune responses are likely to play an important role in protective immunity against rotavirus infection. recombinant VP4-expressing L. lactis can induce specifc immune responses. FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) lactococcal surface-expression vector pNZ8112, including the Cm resistance determinant, repA and repC replication elements, usp45 signal sequence, nisA-promoter, and the cell wall anchor motif. PCR products were purified and digested by SphI and XbaI. electroporation of Lactococcus lactis was carried out as previously described. 10 L of pNZ8112-VP4 plasmid DNA was added to 150 L of NZ9000. pNZ8112-VP4/NZ9000 was inoculated in fresh M17 medium with 0.5% glucose. nisin was added to a final concentration of 10 ng/mL when grown to optical density at 600 nm of 0.5. bacterial protein supernatant was examined by 12% SDS-PAGE. 5% skimmed milk at 4\u00b0C overnight and washed in PBS three times. cells were then pelleted and washed three times with sterile PBS 0.05% Tween 20. the cells were then incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. pNZ8112-VP4/ZN9000 and pNZ8112/NZ9000 were cultured and centrifuged. all of the mice in the two groups orally received a dose of 109 CFU/mL. the immune protocol was performed as described previously. ELISA plates were used to detect sIgA levels in feces, ophthalmic and vaginal washes. the plates were washed three times with PBS containing 1% Tween 20. after washing, 100 L of fecal extracts, ophthalmic and vaginal washes were added. cells were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C for 72 hours. 10 L of 5 g/L MTT was added to each well and solubilized with 150 L of 30% dimethyl sulfoxide. pET-VP4 recombinant expression plasmid containing porcine rotavirus VP4 gene was constructed in our laboratory. pET-VP4 recombinant expression plasmid containing porcine rotavirus VP4 gene was constructed. VP4 protein was expressed and purified as described previously. pET-VP4 containing the complete VP4 gene using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a specific forward primer, 5\u2032GACGCAAGCATGGCTTCTCATTTATAGACAA3\u2032, containing an XbaI site. PCR products were purified and digested by SphI and XbaI and then inserted into the corresponding sites of the pNZ8112 expression vector. pNZ8112-VP4/NZ9000 was harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. pellets were washed twice with sterile 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. bacterial protein supernatant was examined by 12% SDS-PAGE. 1000 with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37\u00b0C for 60 minutes. immunoblots were then washed and incubated with 1 : 2000 dilution of HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG in 10 mL for 60 minutes. pNZ8112-VP4/ZN9000 and pNZ8112/NZ9000 were cultured and centrifuged. cells were washed three times with PBS 0.05% Tween 20 and streaked onto slides. air dried on a glass slide and fixed with cold acetone for 30 minutes. two identical samples from sera, feces, ophthalmic and vaginal washes were washed with 200 mL PBS and collected on the same days as those of the ophthalmic washes. the plates were washed three times with PBS containing 1% Tween 20 and blocked with 200 L of 200 L of 1. the optical density (OD) of each well was measured at 490 nm using a microculture plate reader. the cells were isolated and purified as described. the cells were randomly divided into the control group. nisin-induced pNZ8112-VP4/NZ9000, pNZ8112-VP4/NZ9000, and non-induced pNZ8112-VP4/NZ9000 were analyzed using anti-VP4 serum of porcine rotavirus. massie blue gel staining shows expression of a 27 KD protein in pNZ8112-VP4/NZ9000 induced by nisin. no corresponding protein in non-nisin-induced pNZ8112-VP4/NZ9000 (lane 3) and nisin-induced pNZ8112/NZ9000 (lane 4) can be seen. pNZ8112-VP4/NZ9000 stained either with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG containing 1% Evans blue dye (a) or FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG without Evans blue dye (c). no green fluorescence was observed, but red pellets can be seen in induced pNZ8112-VP4/NZ9000 stained either with 1% Evans blue dye (a) or mucosal antibody sIgA was evaluated in feces (Figure 5(a) and vaginal (Figure 5(b)) and ophthalmic washes (Figure 5(c)) in orally immunized mice. the higher anti-VP4 sIgA was obtained following the booster series. a second booster did not raise sIgA titers much higher than the first booster. mice were orally immunized with 109 CFU of pNZ8112-VP4/NZ9000 and pNZ8112-VP4/NZ9000. the immune protocol was administered on three consecutive days. arrows on the X-axis indicate the times of vaccination and boosters. pNZ8112-VP4c 0.5 0.036d 0.002 0.087d 0.003 5.0 0.058d 0.001 0.971d 0.003 Positive control (5 g/mL Con A) 0.871 0.003 0.822 0.002 Control group (RPMI 1640) 0.031 0.002 0.026 0.002 a n = 10. MA104 cells were infected with porcine rotaviruses at a dose of 100 TCID50. anti-PRV antibodies inhibited cytopathicity in a dose-dependent manner. in contrast, the control serum could not inhibit virus induced cytopathicity. 8112 could effectively induce the expression of heterologous protein. total cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blot. no corresponding protein in non-nisin induced pNZ8112-VP4/NZ9000. the localization analysis results suggested that VP4 protein could be exposed on the outer side of the cell wall. it could not be detected in the supernate of induced cultures of pNZ8112-VP4/NZ9000, even after concentrating 50-fold using a Millipore Ultrafree-15 column. pNZ8112-VP4/NZ9000 showed specific green fluorescence when stained either with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig a high level of serum antibodies against porcine rotavirus VP4 occurred in the pNZ8112-VP4/NZ9000 group compared with the pNZ8112/NZ9000 group. a second booster did not raise the sIgA titers much higher than the first booster. specific anti-VP4 IgA responses were measured in fecal (a), vaginal washes (b), or lacrimal fluids (c) specific anti-VP4 IgA responses were measured in fecal (a), vaginal washes (b), or lacrimal fluids (c) pNZ8112b pNZ8112-VP4c 0.5 0.036d 0.002 0.087d 0.003 5.0 0.058d 0.001 0.971d 0.003 Positive control (5 g/mL Con A) 0.871 0.003 0.822 0.002 Control group (RPMI 1640) 0.031 0.002 0.026 0.002 a n = 10. MA104 cells were infected with porcine rotaviruses at a dose of 100 TCID50. anti-PRV antibodies inhibited cytopathicity in a dose-dependent manner. the control serum could not inhibit virus induced cytopathicity. a nonglycosylated outer capsid protein has been implicated as a virulence determinant in mice and piglets [21]. VP4 also induces neutralizing antibodies [22, 23], and antibodies directed against VP4 neutralize the virus in vitro [24, 25] and passively protect mice against heterologous rotavirus challenge in vivo [26], further studies have shown that VP4 effectively induces protective immunity in animals. we investigated the potential adhesion and persistence of cFDA-SE-labeled L. lactis NZ9000 orally fed to mice in the intestines. at day 7 following inoculation, the amounts of L. lactis NZ9000 that remained adherent to the intestinal mucosa were 69.76%, 51.59%, and 60.67% of those on the first day in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum serial dilutions of the antisera of mice immunized with pNZ8112-VP4/NZ9000 and control sera immunized with pNZ8112/NZ9000 were mixed with an equal volume of 100 TCID50 rotavirus at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. cytopathicity was strongly inhibited by the addition of the antiserum of mice immunized with pNZ8112-VP4/N a booster at a two-week interval apparently increased the production of anti-VP4 sIgA, but a second booster did not seem to increase the sIgA titer much higher than that of the first booster. an oral administration regime was used in this study, which consisted of three sets of successive daily doses of the recombinant L. lactis as the experimental vaccine. using L. lactis as an expression vector for rotavirus VP4 surface antigen was safe and effective following oral vaccination in mice. the mice after administration are all in good condition. none of the mice exhibited any ill effects or died."}
