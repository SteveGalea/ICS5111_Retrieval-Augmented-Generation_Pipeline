{"summary": "interferon treatment should be considered in patients at high risks for ZIKV-associated complications when the potential benefits outweigh the side effects of treatment. as of 27 October 2016 > 70 countries/territories have reported continuing mosquito-borne transmission of ZIKV. most infected adults were asymptomatic or developed a self-limiting acute febrile illness which resolved within 1\u20132 weeks. some infected adults may also develop severe neurological complications. a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis died of disseminated infection with detectable ZIKV RNA in blood, brain, spleen, liver, kidney, lung, and heart. a number of animal models have been developed for studying the pathogenesis and evaluating countermeasures for ZIKV infection. mice with intraperitoneal or subcutaneous ZIKV inoculation develop fatal, disseminated infection. these models have complete/near-complete deficiency in interferon response. these mice are suboptimal for the study of host immune response. aliquots of ZIKV were applied on confluent Vero cells in 96-well plates. the plates were observed for cytopathic effect for 5 days. TCID50 was interpreted as the amount of virus that causes cytopathic effect in 50% of inoculated wells. three mice in each group were sacrificed at 5 dpi for virological, histological, and immunohistochemistry analyses. the remaining mice were sacrificed at 14 dpi or euthanized when there was a 20% weight loss or 10% weight loss with 1 clinical sign. blood samples were also collected for RNA extraction and real-time PCR analysis. dpic 2 F ip 6 106 TCID50 50 mg/kg q24h ip, from 3 days before to 9 dpi inclusively No 5 (n = 3) and 14 (n = 6) dpi 3 M ip 6 106 TCID50 No No 5 (n = 3) and 14 (n = 6) dpi 5 M No 50 mg/kg q24h ip, from 3 days before to 9dpi inclusive gylated IFN-2b 1920 IU/dose q96h sc at 1, 5, and 9 dpi 5 (n = 3) and 14 (n = 8) dpi 11 M ip 6 106 TCID50 50 mg/kg q24h ip from 3 days before to 9 dpi inclusively IFN-1b 160,000 IU/dose q48h ip at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 dpi 5 (n paraffinized and rehydrated tissue sections were treated with antigen Unmasking Solution according to manufacturer's instructions. the primary antibody mouse anti-ZIKV-NS1 antiserum (1:1000 dilution with 1% BSA/PBS) was incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight with primary antibody (rabbit anti-mouse CD45, or rat anti-mouse CD8 (Abcam) for 15 min. 5 l of purified TNA was amplified in a 20 l-reaction containing 10 l of 2 QuantiNova Probe RT-PCR Master Mix, 0.2 l QN Probe RT-mix, 0.8 M forward primer, 0.8 M reverse primer, and 200 nM probe. internal control -actin gene was measured by using QuantiNova Probe RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN), Hilden, Germany. a series of 10-fold dilutions equivalent to 1 102 to 1 106 copies/reaction mixture were prepared to generate standard curves and run in parallel with the test samples. t-test was used to determine significant differences in virus titers. TCID50 was interpreted as the amount of virus that causes cytopathic effect in 50% of inoculated wells. mice were kept in biosafety level-2 housing and given access to standard pellet feed and water ad libitum. mice in negative-control groups were injected with the same volume of PBS. their body weight and survival were monitored for 14 days post-inoculation. the remaining mice were sacrificed at 14 dpi or euthanized when there was a 20% weight loss or 10% weight loss with 1 clinical sign. date of sacrifice/euthanasia 1 M ip 6 106 TCID50 50 mg/kg q24h ip, from 3 days before to 9 dpi inclusively No 5 (n = 3) and 12 (n = 6) dpic 2 F ip 6 106 TCID50 50 mg/kg q24h ip, from 3 days before to 9 dpi inclusively No 5 (n = 3) and 14 (n = 6) d 106 TCID50 50 mg/kg q24h ip, from 3 days before to 9 dpi inclusively IFN-1b 160,000 IU/dose q48h ip at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 dpi 5 (n = 3) and 14 (n = 8) dpi Abbreviations: dpi, days post-inoculation; F, female; IFN, interferon; ip, intraperitoneal; M primary antibody mouse anti-ZIKV-NS1 antiserum (1:1000 dilution with 1% BSA/PBS) was incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight. followed by mouse on mouse HRP polymer kit (Abcam) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 15 min. color development was performed using 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) 5 l of purified TNA was amplified in a 20 l-reaction containing 10 l of 2 QuantiNova Probe RT-PCR Master Mix, 0.2 l QN Probe RT-mix, 0.8 M forward primer, 0.8 M reverse primer, and 200 nM probe.

P-values 0.05 are indicated by (no interferon treatment versus interferon-2b treatment) dexamethasone-immunosuppressed mice with ZIKV inoculation developed mild ( 5%) weight loss (Fig. 1A) and no mortality at 5 dpi (Fig. 1B and C) weight loss was consistently more significant than those of their comparators. dexamethasone-immunosuppressed mice with ZIKV inoculation and control mice were monitored for 14 days or until euthanasia. body weights, (B) clinical scores, and (C) survival times and rates. dexamethasone immunosuppression had higher blood and tissue viral loads at 5 dpi while they were on dexamethasone. dexamethasone was stopped after 9 dpi. this led to prominent weight loss and increased symptoms in the dexamethasone-immunosuppressed mice. all 6 mice with dexamethasone immunosuppression and ZIKV inoculation had weight loss of 10% at 12 dpi. none of the mice with dexamethasone immunosuppression from 3 days before to 13 days post-infection (group 9) developed abrupt weight loss between 10 dpi and 14 dpi. the mice in the other control groups (groups 3 to 9) had either gained weight or had 5% weight loss with spontaneous recovery at 14 dpi. the most prominent inflammatory changes were seen in the brain (cortical parenchymal and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates) the most prominent inflammatory changes were seen in the brain (cortical parenchymal and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates) histological changes in the model mice were unrelated to dexamethasone-induced effects such as drug-induced testicular toxicity. the absence of inflammatory infiltrates in the ZIKV-inoculated mice without dexamethasone withdrawal (group 9) supported the role of the host immune response in eliciting the clinical and histological changes in the mice with dexamethasone withdrawal (group 2). sections of the kidney (12 dpi) showing (D) acute tubulitis with a large amount of inflammatory exudation in tubular lumens. sections of the kidney (12 dpi) of a dexamethasone-immunosuppressed mouse showing normal architecture. dexamethasone-immunosuppressed mice with mock infection (F and H) stained the necropsied testis of the dexamethasone-immunosuppressed mice with ZIKV inoculation and those of the dexamethasone-immunosuppressed mice with CD45 (pan-leukocyte) and CD8 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte) antibodies. mice treated with pegylated interferon-2b (group 10) or interferon-1b (group 11) had 10% weight loss with spontaneous recovery at 14 dpi. all of these mice remained asymptomatic and survived through the study period. tissues showed prominent inflammatory reactions in H&E staining at 5 dpi or 14 dpi. they had reduced mean viral loads in blood and all the tissues. the reductions were most significant in the tissues with high viral loads. 160,000 IU/dose every 48 h intraperitoneally at 1 dpi, 3 dpi, 5 dpi, 7 dpi, and 9 dpi. results were combined from two independent experiments. the previous assumption that ZIKV infection is an entirely self-limiting disease without severe or long-lasting sequelae has been overturned by the increasing recognition of congenital malformations, neurological complications, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. this has led us to hypothesize that, like many other flavivirus infections, the host immune response may also play a role in these complications. inflammatory cell infiltrate (pan-leukocyte marker CD45 +) with predominantly CD8 + T lymphocytes. male mice developed earlier onset of disease than female mice. weight loss, clinical scores, and histological evidence of inflammatory reactions were most severe soon after dexamethasone withdrawal. this tissue tropism of ZIKV in our mouse model concurs with the in-vitro observation that ZIKV efficiently replicates in diverse cell types of neuronal, testicular, prostatic, renal, intestinal, hepatic, and placental origin. histological evidence of orchitis has not been reported due to the difficulty in obtaining the patients' testicular tissues for histological examination. previous mouse models for ZIKV infection utilizing types I/II interferon-signaling-/receptor-deficient mice have also showed that viral particles and/or RNA could be detected in the mice's testes. recombinant type I interferons have broad-spectrum antiviral activities including those against ZIKV, but type I interferon-signaling-/receptor-deficient mice were not suitable for evaluation of the effects of recombinant type I interferons. these potential complications may be increasingly recognized as the ZIKV epidemic continues to expand into developed countries with a large ageing and immunosuppressed population. clinical trials should be considered to evaluate the benefits of early use of interferon treatment in patients at risk of developing severe ZIKV-associated complications. the optimal timing of treatment commencement should be further investigated as late commencement of interferon treatment may be useless or deleterious and should be avoided. the individual viral load data points of the blood and major organs of dexamethasone-immunosuppressed mice with or without interferon treatment (S1A) and female mice (S1B) in Fig. 3, Fig. 7 are shown in scattered plots. authors declared no conflict of interests."}
