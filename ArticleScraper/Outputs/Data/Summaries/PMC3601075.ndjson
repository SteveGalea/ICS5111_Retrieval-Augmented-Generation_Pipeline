{"summary": "equine influenza infection induces neutralising antibodies against the surface glycoproteins haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) there have been no isolations of H7N7 virus from horses for over 30 years. equine influenza pseudotyped lentiviruses may provide a solution to the requirement for a reliable and reproducible assay. a pseudotype virus has the \u2018core\u2019 of one virus (e.g., a retrovirus) and the outer \u2018envelope\u2019 protein of another (e.g., the HA of influenza virus) serum samples surplus to diagnostic requirements were obtained from 20 routinely influenza-vaccinated donkeys. a batch of serum from a hyper-immunised experimental pony vaccinated with a number of H3N8 strains over two decades. sera were stored at -80\u00b0C until use. the full haemagglutinin gene was amplified by the QIAmp viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) four plasmids expressing the equine influenza virus (EIV) haemagglutinin (HA), HIV gag-pol, firefly luciferase reporter gene and TMPRSS2 protease are transfected into HEK293 cells. luminescence measured using a GloMax 96 luminometer and Relative Luminescence Units (RLU) per ml (auto-luminescence normalised using cell only control) was normalised by deducting any background luminescence produced by cell-only controls (no pseudotype virus) ted donkeys were recently vaccinated with a booster dose of a commercially available inactivated vaccine containing the american-lineage H3N8 strain A/equine/Newmarket/1/93, the European-lineage H3N8 strain A/equine/Newmarket/2/93. the epitope-bearing HA1 regions of the Sussex/89 and Newmarket/93 viruses share 99% amino acid identity (as determined using CLUSTAL software) I.18 expression plasmid was used previously for other influenza HA pseudotypes. four plasmids expressing the equine influenza virus (EIV) haemagglutinin (HA), HIV gag-pol, firefly luciferase reporter gene and TMPRSS2 were combined. lentivirus is harvested from virus supernatant, added to target 293 cells. 1U of exogenous soluble Clostridium perfringens NA (Sigma) was added to facilitate sialic acid cleavage and pseudotype virus egress. cell culture supernatant was harvested after further 24 hrs. equine influenza pseudotyped virus (EIPV) supernatant produced had a titre of 1109 RLU/ml. no detectable virus was produced in the absence of this plasmid. pseudotype virus neutralization assay (PVNA) and single radial haemolysis (SRH) measured antibodies in 20 equine sera. SRH antibody levels ranged from 61-207 mm2. control serum showed strong neutralization, with an IC50 of >40,000. the antibody titres of both serum samples were 80, the cut-off for a negative result. SRH antibody levels ranged from 61-207 mm2. hepatitis C (Bartosch et al, 2003; Hsu et al, 2003; Temperton et al, 2005); rabies and lyssaviruses (Wright et al, 2008; 2009; 2010) and avian influenza viruses (Temperton et al, 2007) to be handled in BSL1/2 facilities. all other influenza A viruses have monobasic cleavage sites with a single lysine or arginine residue. it has been shown that cleavage at these sites is mediated by specific type II transmembrane serine proteases such as TMPRSS2 and HAT (human airway trypsin-like protease) antibodies detected by SRH are largely neutralizing. differences between SRH and neutralization assays such as PVNA and micro-neutralization (MN) a protective titre will be determined using sera obtained from vaccination and challenge studies."}
