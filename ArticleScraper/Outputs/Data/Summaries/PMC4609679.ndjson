{"summary": "TEXT Caliciviruses are nonenveloped, small round viruses with a single-strand positive-sense RNA genome of 7 to 8.5 kb in size. the family includes the genera Vesivirus, Norovirus, Sapovirus, Lagovirus, and Nebovirus. in recent years, novel, yet unclassified caliciviruses have been identified in mammals, birds, and fishes. the genome was 7,484 nt long, excluding the poly(A) tail. the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) was 67 nt long, while the 3\u2032 UTR was 80 nt long. ORF1 encoded a large polyprotein of 2,226 amino acids (aa) in length. highest nucleotide identity was to neboviruses (48%), followed by lagoviruses (38%), while lowest nucleotide identity was to recoviruses and to caliciviruses. highest identity (51% nt and 42% aa) was to neboviruses, while identity to other caliciviruses was lower than 39% nt and 23% aa. dRp Capsid nt nt aa nt aa nt aa Bo/NB (AY082891) Nebovirus 48 59 59 44 41 Le/EBHSV (NC002615) Lagovirus 38 46 38 36 21 Go/strain N (KJ473715) Nacovirusb 32 43 36 33 20 Ch/V0021/Bayern/2004 (HQ010042) 30 42 36 32 21 Hu neboviruses are relatively highly conserved and segregate into two major clades, Nebraska-like or Newbury-1-like, genetic heterogeneity due to recombination (9) or genetic drift (10) has also been reported. the Krklareli virus differed in its genome organization from neboviruses. oligonucleotides specific for neboviruses failed to recognize Krklareli virus RNA in RT-PCR. the virus failed to replicate in vitro, as observed by monitoring the onset of cytopathic effect in serial passages and viral replication by RT-PCR. experimental infection with the nebovirus prototypes causes anorexia, diarrhea, and xylose malabsorption in gnotobiotic calves. if Krklareli virus retains these pathogenic properties should be demonstrated by experimental infections."}
