{"summary": "MERS-CoV is a positive-strand RNA virus belonging to the C lineage within the Betacoronavirus genus. it is genetically closely related to coronavirus sequences obtained from insectivorous bats originating from Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. the detection of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and the recovery of viral sequences and virus in dromedary camels across the countries of the Middle East suggest the potential involvement of an intermediate reservoir in vitro studies using a variety of primary and immortalized cell lines reported a broad tropism of MERS-CoV (19\u201322) most cell lines with a human, bat, nonhuman primate, or swine origin were found to be susceptible to infection with MERS-CoV. fresh animal tissues were obtained from local slaughter facilities (cow, goat, and sheep) or from an in-house tissue repository (rhesus macaque and mouse) or collected under a tissue sampling protocol (hamster and ferret) approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Rocky Mountain Laboratories. supernatant was centrifuged at 400 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C and washed 3 times with HBSS. pellet was then resuspended in DMEM-F12 GlutaMAX medium containing 1 mg/ml collagenase. cells were seeded at a density of 5 104 cells/cm2. cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer. cellular lysates were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. membranes were incubated overnight with anti-DPP4 rabbit polyclonal antibody. hesus macaque, mouse, ferret, sheep, goat, and cow or a 1:800 dilution for hamster and biotinylated anti-rabbit SS link. Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and processed for immunohistochemistry using the Discovery XT automated processor (Ventana Medical Systems) total RNA from lung and kidney samples from different species was extracted using the RNeasy minikit ( human and hamster DPP4s in pcDNA3.1(+) were restriction digested, purified, and ligated with the humanized hamster or hamsterized human DPP4 fragments. modified DPP4 sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. samples of cells were stained with secondary antibody only. cells were washed, resuspended in PBS with 2% FBS. cells were stained with 7-aminoactinomycin D (Life Technologies) mRNA was purified from total RNA via the NucleoTrap mRNA minikit. qRT-PCR was performed in three experiments on the Rotor-GeneQ. fresh animal tissues were obtained from local slaughter facilities or from an in-house tissue repository (rhesus macaque and mouse) the collection was performed following the guidelines of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International (AAALAC), by certified staff. nonsupplemented DMEM-F12 GlutaMAX medium containing 1 mg/ml collagenase. supernatant was centrifuged at 400 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. pellet was then resuspended in DMEM-F12 GlutaMAX medium. all cell lines were maintained at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer. cellular lysates were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. membranes were incubated overnight with anti-DPP4 rabbit polyclonal antibody. et, sheep, goat, and cow or a 1:800 dilution for hamster and biotinylated anti-rabbit SS link.

Modified DPP4 sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. samples of cells were stained with secondary antibody only. cells were washed, stained with 7-aminoactinomycin D (Life Technologies) data were analyzed using an LSRII flow cytometer. mRNA was purified from total RNA via the NucleoTrap mRNA minikit. qRT-PCR was performed in three experiments on the Rotor-GeneQ. MERS-CoV replicated efficiently in Huh-7 and vero cells. in contrast, MERS-CoV did not replicate in BHK, MEF C57Bl6 and 3T3 and ferret primary kidney cells. the presence of the MERS-CoV receptor, DPP4, is essential in the initiation of infection. western blots of cellular lysates of Huh-7, vero, BHK, primary ferret, 3T3 and MEF C57Bl6 cells probed with anti-DPP4 or anti-actin antibodies. samples were collected using an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using GraphPad software. DPP4 was present on kidney vascular smooth muscle cells, with weak staining in the hamster, moderate staining in the macaque and mouse. all species except the mouse displayed the presence of DPP4 on either glomerular or vascular endothelium.

DPP4 was more abundantly expressed on alveolar interstitium in camel, goat, and sheep lungs compared to in dromedary camel, rhesus macaque, hamster, mouse, and ferret lungs. Camel DPP4 diverged from goat, cow, and sheep DPP4 when comparing partial protein sequence alignments. IHC was performed on lung and kidney tissues from camel, goat, cow, and sheep using an anti-DPP4 antibody. Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin embedded in paraffin.

BHK or primary ferret cells were left untransfected (red) or transfected with DPP4 (blue) and stained 24 h posttransfection using anti-DPP4 (R&D) and an FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Life Technologies) samples were collected using an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software. 336 in human DPP4 forms hydrogen bonds with RBD residue Tyr499 and a salt bridge to RBD residue Asp455. hamster DPP4 has significantly higher binding energy (less favorable interactions) than human DPP4 to MERS-CoV. binding energy associated with the humanized hamster DPP4 and MERS-CoV spike protein complex was lower than that of hamsterized human DPP4 and MERS-CoV spike protein. us macaque mouse P A R T S V Ferret E D S T Y S E E E T Camel V G Cow V G Goat V G a Full DPP4 protein sequences were compared using MegAlign software. a cartoon representing the binding between human DPP4 or hamster DPP4 and the spike protein of MERS-CoV is depicted in white. the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of MERS-CoV is depict expression plasmids were synthesized with human DPP4 containing the five hamster-specific amino acid residues (humanized hamster DPP4) and hamster DPP4 containing the five human-specific amino acid residues (humanized hamster DPP4). inoculation of BHK cells transiently expressing hamsterized human DPP4 did not. the binding energy of ferret and mouse DPP4 to MERS-CoV spike protein was found to be relatively high. rhesus macaque DPP4 was found to have binding energy levels similar to human DPP4. transfection of the DPP4 of ferret or mouse origin into BHK cells did not render these cells susceptible to MERS-CoV replication. abundantly expressed on alveolar interstitium in cow, goat, and sheep lungs compared to in dromedary camel, rhesus macaque, hamster, mouse, and ferret lungs. camel DPP4 diverged from goat, cow, and sheep DPP4. as a control, human (red) or hamster (blue) DPP4 was expressed on BHK cells. expression of DPP4 mRNA was measured via qRT-PCR. expression of mRNA was normalized to HPRT. IHC was performed on lung and kidney tissues from camel, goat, cow, and sheep. MERS-CoV replicated efficiently in cells of human and nonhuman primate origin. this suggests the existence of a host-barrier restriction of MERS-CoV. this suggests the existence of a host-barrier restriction of MERS-CoV for some species. the cocrystallization between the human DPP4 and the MERS-CoV spike protein revealed the receptor binding domain of MERS-CoV and the amino acid residues of human DPP4 interacting with this domain. expression of the humanized hamster DPP4 in BHK cells rendered these cells permissive for MERS-CoV, whereas expression of hamsterized human DPP4 did not change the nonpermissiveness of the cells. the only available animal disease model for MERS-CoV is the rhesus macaque. research into therapeutic and prophylactic countermeasures is restricted by the absence of a small animal model allowing high-throughput in vivo screening of antivirals. protein sequence alignments of full-length and partial DPP4 revealed that camel DPP4 differs from goat, cow, and sheep DPP4. it is possible that subtle differences in binding of spike and DPP4 account for the apparent lack of MERS-CoV circulation in the goat, cow, and sheep population. our data support the potential for the existence of one or multiple natural reservoirs for MERS-CoV. the ability of DPP4s of cows, sheep, goats, and dromedary camels to function as a MERS-CoV receptor and the abundant DPP4 presence in the respiratory tract suggest that they would be susceptible for MERS-CoV infection."}
