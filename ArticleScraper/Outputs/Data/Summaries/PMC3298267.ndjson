{"summary": "participants and Methods The study population was composed of Chinese-speaking residents of Hong Kong (22) who were 18\u201360 years old. survey 1 was conducted from December 30, 2003, to

of life (QOL) and vitality QOL subscale scores (p 0.05) the relevant sociodemographic variables were entered as input variables in stepwise linear and logistic regression models to predict IES scores, mental health, and vitality QOL scores and various psychological effects. Stage 2 Analysis (Adjusted for Variables Significant in Stage 1) Those who felt apprehensive because of SARS were more likely to report posttraumatic stress symptoms or have a lower mental health QOL and vitality QOL scores. sociodemographic variables were entered as input variables in stepwise linear and logistic regression models to predict IES scores, mental health, and vitality QOL scores and various psychological effects (e.g., whether one had trouble falling asleep) Those who felt apprehensive because of SARS were more likely to report posttraumatic stress symptoms (as measured by IES) or have a lower mental health QOL and vitality QOL scores. more than 90% of respondents perceived that mask use, frequent hand washing, and disinfection of living quarters are efficacious means of SARS prevention. the general public has apparently been forming their own attitudes in a \"bottom-up\" manner. perceptions such as perceived efficacy and perceived susceptibility were predictive of the use of preventive measures and emotional responses (20,21,35). in survey 2, the prevalences of avoiding hospitals and China were 66.7% and 68.6%, respectively. a 40%\u201350% of respondents reported that their mental health status had been worsened. 40% felt that their levels of work- and family-related stress had increased during the epidemic. similar effects had been documented in studies conducted after the 9/11 terrorist attack in the united states. the response rates of the studies were moderate (58% in survey 1 and 65% in survey 2), and no data were available from nonresponders. results should reflect the direct effect of SARS, rather than the general psychological status of the respondents."}
