{"summary": "mortality associated with the 2009\u20132010 Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic was 31% (95% CI 28\u201334) mortality was highest in south Asia (61% [95% CI 50\u201371] and sub-saharan Africa (53% [95% CI 29\u201375]) high income economies had significantly lower reported mortality compared to upper middle income economies respectively (P0.0001). the 2009\u20132010 Influenza A (H1N1) outbreak was declared the first pandemic of this century after early reports of high morbidity and mortality. early outbreak reporting informs expectations in morbidity, mortality and guides health systems\u2019 response, to specific outbreaks. detection bias towards identification and inclusion of the sickest patients and selection bias are substantial threats to the internal validity and generalizability for early outbreak studies. Methods Search Strategy We searched Medline (January week 1, 2009 to March week 2, 2016), Embase Classic + Embase (2009 week 1 to 2016week 10), LILACS and African Index Medicus. we reviewed the references of all retrieved studies and reviews to identify any additional studies. we considered full text articles published in any language. primary objective was to determine mortality of critically ill patients with influenza A (H1N1) during the 2009\u20132010 pandemic. we preferentially used hospital, then 1 month, then in-ICU mortality, whichever represented the longest period of follow-up. primary outcome was abstracted in duplicate from all studies by a second author (RF) quality assessment We used the Newcastle-Ottawa scale to assess study quality. the scale allocates up to 9 points to evaluate the risk of bias in cohort or case-control studies in 3 domains. the scale allocates up to 9 points to evaluate risk of bias. a paired analysis was performed for all the countries that reported mortality both during Wave I of the pandemic as well as enrolled for longer than nine months. we also performed a paired analysis for all the countries that reported mortality both during Wave I of the pandemic.

ARDS: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; ECMO: Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Study Characteristics The study characteristics were similar when combined for both the meta-regression and the hierarchical meta-regression. there was no clinically important difference in the reporting of demographic, and intervention variables among populations when we evaluated all included studies. mortality described is a mean of all studies reporting short term mortality associated with critical illness during the H1N1 pandemic Risk of Bias and quality of evidence assessment. most studies were considered to be of high quality (Table B in S1 File) for the first wave of the H1N1 pandemic was 39% (95% CI 33\u201345), 30% (95% CI 23\u201339) in wave 2, and 31% (95% CI 25\u201336) during prolonged enrollment (p = 0.66). Fig 2. Reported mortality associated with 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) associated critical illness. the report from early case-series gave an approximate estimate of the overall mortality in any given country though the entirety of a pandemic. however, we found significant intra-country differences in the reported mortality among different continents and geographical regions. the black squares represent the point estimate and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around the mortality for each subgroup. the use of geographical regions is associated with the best discriminative power to report the differences in mortality in a global context. Mortality was comparable in North America (25% [95% CI 22\u201327]); West Europe (25% [95% CI 22\u201330]) and East Asia and Pacific (28% [95% CI 23\u201333] all showed a more pronounced effect when the geographical region rather than the hemisphere was considered. the black squares represent the point estimate and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around the mortality for each subgroup. specific patient populations Mortality was substantially higher among patients undergoing mechanical ventilation (42% [95% CI 36\u201349]) in comparison to unselected critically ill patients, (27% [95% CI 24\u201330]) (Fi 4). Mortality in patients with ARDS was 37% (95% CI 32\u201344) and 44% [95% CI 26\u201364] among critically ill patients. the black squares represent the point estimate and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around the mortality for each subgroup. the black diamond is the summary or overall combined estimate of mortality associated with the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic Discussion. the lack of standardized definitions and differences in severity of disease recognized as critical illness have been cited as potential barriers. the use of geographic variables such as hemispheres or continents is likely less sensitive to differences between regions. the economic development of the country might be a surrogate marker for the availability of ICU specific therapies. global pandemic-associated mortality is higher than previously reported. standardized global approach to reporting on outbreaks and pandemics will provide us more accurate estimates of morbidity and mortality associated with new diseases. table C: differences in baseline characteristics based on studies only describing unselected critically ill patients. studies describing patients under consideration or actually getting ECMO."}
