{"summary": "the upper respiratory tract is a natural niche for potentially pathogenic bacteria embedded in commensal communities forming the nasopharyngeal microbiome. microbial communities of the nasopharynx are associated with respiratory diseases, i.e., severe pneumonia, which are responsible for substantial mortality and morbidity in humans worldwide. imbalances in microbial composition can lead to acquisition of new viral or bacterial species and invasion of potential pathogens, which in turn can become detrimental. commensal respiratory microbiota facilitated immune-support against Influenza A virus infection (IAV), but also impaired CD4 T-, CD8 T-, and B-cell immunity. influenza A viruses belong to the family of Orthomyxoviridae. the 8-segmented genomes of influenza A viruses are classified into 16 classical HA and 9 classical NA subtypes. influenza can be transmitted between animals, including swine, birds, horses, and humans, making it a zoonotic disease. around 95% of all severe cases and deaths were attributed to secondary infections with bacterial pathogens, most predominantly by Streptococcus pneumoniae. pneumonia accounted for about 44% of deaths during the Asian Flu. mortality rates were rather low, but most deaths occurred in healthy young individuals with no underlying conditions. about 25\u201350% of severe or fatal cases were linked to complications due to bacterial pneumonia. Pneumococci, S. aureus, and GAS are important human Gram-positive pathogens. all of them are frequent colonizers of the human nasopharynx. they share many features including pathogenic mechanisms and clinical aspects. the pneumococcus is a typical colonizer of the human nasopharynx. about 20\u201350% of healthy children and 8\u201330% of healthy adults are asymptomatically colonized. this bacterium is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. the pneumococcus is estimated to cause ca. 10% of all deaths in children below 5 years of age. influenza A virus binds via HA to either 2,3- or 2,6-linked sialic acid at the surface of epithelial cells of the upper and lower respiratory tract. the presence of viral proteins during infection induces also direct activation of the intrinsic or indirectly the activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via production of inflammatory cytokines. however, aberrant coagulation induced by virus infection causes a hyper-inflammatory response. potential pathogenic bacteria express arsenal of virulence factors responsible for attachment to human host structures. bacterial cytotoxins include pneumolysin of pneumococci, hemolysin, and leukocidins. Streptolysins S and O and Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B of S. pyogenes can synergize with viral counterparts to further increase lung tissue pathology. additional potential mechanisms by which the initial colonization of the lower respiratory tract and lung tissue damage might occur include potentiation of the development of pneumonia by IAV neuraminidase. induction of interferons as a response to viral infection compromises the immune sensing of Gram-positive bacteria by neutrophils and macrophages. subsequent infection with Gram-positive bacteria enhances the type I interferon expression, which in turn suppresses production of the CCL2 chemokine. studies on interplay between IAV-pneumococci and human dendritic cells revealed TLR3 as a crucial sensor of viral and bacterial RNA leading to enhanced IL-12p70 production. bacterial infiltrations of the lungs might occur much later, i.e. during the onset of wound healing after partial clearance of IAV. pneumonia is characterized by hyper-inflammatory conditions of the lungs at the onset of infection followed by a hypo-inflammatory state with immune paralysis. pneumonia may worsen due to bacterial invasion and enhanced cellular infiltration of the lungs by neutrophils. pneumococci, S. aureus, and GAS can activate and modulate the coagulation system, leading to extensive expression of tissue factor. nall et al., 2016; Uhlmann et al., 2016; nall et al., 2016; Uhlmann et al., 2016; nall et al., 2016; Uhlmann et al., 2016; nall et al., 2016; Uhlmann et al., 2016; nall et al., 2016; nall et al., 2016 inflammasome activation leads to the release of IL-1 and IL-18. the presence of viral proteins during infection induces also direct activation of the intrinsic or indirectly the activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway via production of inflammatory cytokines. aberrant coagulation induced by virus infection causes a hyper-inflammatory response. potential pathogenic bacteria express arsenal of virulence factors responsible for attachment to human host structures. bacterial cytotoxins include pneumolysin of pneumococci, hemolysin and heparin-binding protein. cidins of S. aureus (Mairpady Shambat et al., 2015), and Streptolysins S and O and Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B of S. pyogenes (Tsai et al., 1998; Gurel et al., 2013; Siemens et al., 2015, 2016) can synergize with viral counterparts to further increase lung tissue pathology IAV are able to induce suppression and killing of the resident alveolar macrophages. these cells are usually replaced by differentiation of recruited monocytes into macrophages of different polarization patterns. this in turn creates a delay in pathogen clearance and opens a window for host susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections. cells were identified as a crucial upstream mechanism of depressed antimicrobial activities by alveolar macrophages. it seems likely that IAV NA is also able to activate host cell receptors in a TGF- dependent manner, which in turn promotes GAS invasion and subsequent lung pathology. however, depending on the bacterial species the disease manifestation and underlying innate immune responses might vary. pneumonia is characterized by hyper-inflammatory conditions of the lungs at the onset of infection followed by a hypo-inflammatory state with immune paralysis. in co-infections, the situation might worsen due to bacterial invasion and enhanced cellular infiltration of the lungs by neutrophils. pneumococci, S. aureus, and GAS can activate and modulate the coagulation system. the cytolytic effects caused by bacterial toxins might synergize with the outcome of IAV cytotoxic accessory protein, PB1-F2, mediated tissue pathology leading to enhanced cytokine production. the constant increase of animal studies in the last decades is in contrast to their reproducibility in humans (Hackam and Redelmeier, 2006). mammalians are mostly used because of their anatomical and physiological proximity to humans. rodents and in particular mice are used more frequently as a pneumonia model organisms. mouse models for bacterial and viral infections have several limitations. most of the bacterial and viral species under study are human pathogens. host genetic variations and sex differences have an impact on predisposition, severity, and outcome of infection. ferrets are naturally susceptible to IAV isolated from different species. the infection of ferrets with human seasonal IAV isolates results in an upper respiratory tract infection similar to human influenza infection. there are only few reports on bacterial and IAV co-infection in this model organism. the guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) was also used in pneumonia research. it is often used in non-infectious lung diseases, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. commercial availability, ease of husbandry and ability to work with non-adapted pathogens are reasons for using this in vivo model. bacteremia in 85% of untreated animals within 46 h. the cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) was reported to be susceptible to IAV. the infection led to increased breathing rates and decreased body temperature. bacterial pneumonia does not convert the sub-lethal viral infection to a lethal outcome. rats were easily colonized with pneumococci, but viral replication was strain dependent. the biggest disadvantages are low animal availability, aggressiveness of the species, and lack of specific reagents. rabbits are frequently used for antibody production. rabbits are used for safety investigations of vaccines. despite their susceptibility to IAV infection, rabbits are only rarely used. the 1918 pandemic IAV strain induced dysregulation of the antiviral response leading to insufficient protection of the host. the 2009 pandemic H1N1 US isolate caused severe pathological lesions in the lungs of the macaques. rhesus macaques mimicked the clinical and pathological features of early mild to moderate pneumonia in humans. no involvement of PVL in lung pathology or immune cell influx of the lungs could be detected. colonization was induced in eight of eight infants, lasted for 2 weeks in all animals and for 7 weeks in more than 60%. the same group tested detoxified pneumolysin (dPly) and pneumococcal histidine triad protein D (PhtD) as potential vaccine candidates. rhesus macaques were challenged with a 19F pneumococcal strain. human and porcine organs have many common features and functions. the upper respiratory tract of humans and pigs is anatomically similar. pigs possess tonsils, which are absent in mice. the pig has previously been used to mimic a number of human infectious diseases. examples for S. aureus infections with this model organism are wound infections (Sanden et al., 1989; Svedman et al., 1989) a lot can be translated and learned from studies on the porcine zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus suis. S. suis usually inhabits mucosal surfaces of tonsils, nares, genital and alimentary tract of piglets. the bacteria can cause meningitis, septicemia, arthritis, and pneumonia. mouse models are a useful tool to study in vivo effects of different infectious agents. they represent approximately 3% of all pneumonia research published in peer-review journals. but the constant increase of animal studies in the last decades is in contrast to their reproducibility in humans. rodents and in particular mice are used more frequently as a pneumonia model organisms. rapid reproductive rate, small size, less complicated handling, the ability to reproduce and compare results with already published bacterial and viral mono-infections are reasons for the use. genetic engineering allowed to generate a wide variety of mouse variants with gain-of-function, loss-of-function or reporter genes. mouse models for bacterial and viral infections have several limitations. most of the bacterial and viral species under study are human pathogens. host genetic variations and sex differences have an impact on predisposition, severity, and outcome of infection. ferrets are naturally susceptible to IAV isolated from different species. the infection of ferrets with human seasonal IAV isolates results in an upper respiratory tract infection similar to human influenza infection. there are only few reports on bacterial and IAV co-infection in this model organism. guinea pigs are susceptible to human, avian, and swine influenza viruses. guinea pigs exhibit only minor clinical symptoms. transmission of pneumococci in guinea pigs is promoted by co-infection. the infection led to increased breathing rates accompanied by weight loss. the animals developed pneumonia which persisted for nearly 3 weeks. there are only few studies on bacterial co-infections in rats. rabbit models of pneumococcal and staphylococcal pneumonia are based on intra-bronchial or intra-pulmonary infections which make them useful for pathogenesis. most recent rabbit models of pneumococcal and staphylococcal pneumonia are based on intra-bronchial or intra-pulmonary infections. rabbits are used for safety investigations of vaccines (e.g., CoVaccine HT or Aflunov) in recent years cottontails shed relatively large quantities of viral RNA. despite their susceptibility to IAV infection, rabbits are only rarely used as model. the 1918 IAV strain induced dysregulation of the antiviral response leading to insufficient protection of the host. the 2009 pandemic H1N1 US isolate caused severe pathological lesions in the lungs of the macaques. a non-lethal IAV (H3N2)-S. aureus co-infection model in cynomolgus macaques caused mild pneumonia, but did not predispose the animals to subsequent severe infection with the USA300 clone. only two studies on pneumococcal carriage and pneumonia were conducted in 2013. rhesus macaques were challenged with a 19F pneumococcal strain. the vaccine protected the animals against S. pneumoniae-induced pneumonia. the optimal in vivo model for human pneumonia remains to be identified. pigs could be an appropriate model system for studying infectious diseases. porcine immune system resembles over 80% of the human immune system. mice share less than 10% with humans. pigs have 50\u201370% of circulating polymorph nuclear cells. pigs and humans are infected with identical subtypes of IAV (H1N1, H3N2) and show similar clinical presentation and pathogenesis. pigs and humans are infected with identical subtypes of IAV (H1N1, H3N2), and show similar clinical presentation and pathogenesis. the bacteria can cause meningitis, septicemia, arthritis, and pneumonia in pigs. some strains are considered to be hyper-virulent and others hypo- or avirulent. human 3D-organotypic tissue models and ex vivo organ tissues should be considered, as they are most valuable tools to study host\u2013pathogen interactions in a more complex setting. tissue engineering approaches were originally focused on regenerative medicine (Langer and Vacanti, 1993) model relevant for pneumonia consists of lung fibroblasts embedded in a collagen matrix with a stratified epithelial layer on top. the engineered tissue is suitable for implanting and studying immune cells, including dendritic cells. bacterial and viral co-infections of the respiratory tract are highly lethal and present a dramatic burden for the global health system. the synergistic mechanisms between viruses and bacteria leading to enhanced morbidity and mortality are poorly understood. conflict of interest Statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
