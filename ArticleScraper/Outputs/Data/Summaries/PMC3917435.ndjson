IRF-Frederick focuses on emerging viral pathogens that require animal biosafety level 4 (ABSL-4) or biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) containment, including specific arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, flaviviruses, and filoviruses. biosafety precautions for ABSL-4/BSL-4 experiments are implemented through facility-specific standard operating procedures. the method of choice for decontamination at the IRF-Frederick is paraformaldehyde gas. successful decontamination of a Class III BSC is documented from the results of biological indicators that validate agent inactivation. one researcher is manipulating the contents of one of the Class III BSCs via synthetic rubber gloves. the other researcher is monitoring the parameters of the experiment electronically. the IRF-Frederick class III BSC laboratory is docked to the ABSL-4 suit laboratory. two specialized transport carts within the ABSL-4 suit laboratory are docked to the ABSL-4 suit laboratory at the Rapid Transfer Port. non-infectious items/tools may be passed into the contaminated class III BSC. a liquid barrier created by the appropriate disinfectant protects the researcher. a dedicated high-efficency Particulate Air (HEPA) filtration system is used. the glove ports are furnished with extended, arm-length synthetic rubber gloves that range in thickness and material depending on scientific application and disinfectants used. the latex/nitrile gloves are a protective barrier between the user and the class III BSC in the event there is a breach of containment within the integrated synthetic rubber gloves. the AAMP is fully contained within the Class III BSC. it is controlled by mass flow controllers and experimental parameters dictated by the researcher on a laptop. droplets produced by aerosol generation pass through a mixing tube, are diluted with additional air, and dried. the vacuum pulls air through the whole body chamber ensuring that newly generated particles pass through the chamber while maintaining a dynamic system. aerosol generators, exposure chambers, biosamplers, and aerodynamic particle sizers can be used in conjunction with the AAMP in the Class III BSC. a variety of aerosol generators can be used in conjunction with the AAMP in the class III BSC. the researcher analyzes particle size (mass) within a dedicated size range. as the particle size decreases, the ability to travel further through the device increases. aerosol generators, biosampling devices (e.g., flow rate), particle sizers, exposure chambers (e.g., leak detection), flow controllers, air and vacuum supply, autoclaves. the AAMP automatically monitors and maintains environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, negative pressure) within the exposure chamber. plethysmography equipment is calibrated for baseline parameters. minute volume is calculated from a calibration curve that is produced by injection of a known volume of air into the plethysmograph over a wide range of simulated respiratory frequencies. such calibrations can capture simulated animal-to-animal variations in pulmonary function but cannot account for changes in respiratory function caused by the use of anesthetics. the researcher can control the amount and duration of the inhalation procedure. by monitoring the respiratory function during the experiment, the researcher can control the amount and duration of the inhalation procedure. the AAMP will then terminate the exposure when the target dose of the virus is achieved. the class III biosafety cabinet (BSC) is a hermetically sealed stainless steel cabinet containing an ABSL-4 environment under negative pressure. materials can be introduced into the BSC by staff working in the ABSL-4 cabinet laboratory through an under-cabinet-mounted stainless steel tank. materials, animals, and viral pathogens can also be moved into the BSC from the ABSL-4 suit laboratory side. the gas is pumped into the BSC and decontaminates the BSC after an appropriate contact time (i.e., 6 h) the gas is then neutralized by ammonium bicarbonate for an additional 6 h (12 h total decontamination). Biological indicators are placed throughout the BSC and the results are recorded and analyzed by staff. two specialized transport carts within the ABSL-4 suit laboratory are docked to the Class III BSC at the Rapid Transfer Port. through windows in the wall between the ABSL-4 suit laboratory and the class III BSC, researchers see into the adjacent ABSL-4 cabinet laboratory containing the Class III BSCs. if samples are transported out of the Class III BSC for any reason, then appropriate barriers and disinfectant should be used to provide protection and containment. a liquid barrier created by the appropriate disinfectant protects the researcher by ensuring contaminants within the BSC are fully contained. the latex/nitrile gloves are a protective barrier between the user and the class III BSC. when exiting the laboratory, staff must take a shower, and all used scrubs must remain inside the containment portion of the change room. the scrubs are placed into laundry bags, autoclaved outside of the laboratory, and then laundered. a biosampler or cascade impactor and particle sizer are attached to the whole body chamber for collection and analysis. the turnkey unit electronically controls and monitors numerous parameters that can influence an aerosol delivery. the class III BSC is equipped with an integrated, connective port between the AAMP and the user\u2019s laptop. the centered flow Tangential Aerosol Generator (CenTAG) is used and controlled by a syringe pump and AAMP software. the particles are diluted with additional air, dried to an optimal size within the mixing tube, and delivered to the exposure chamber. pressure within the exposure chamber can be positive or negative, depending on parameters set by the researcher. the deposition pattern is dependent on particle size, density, shape, airway geometry, and breathing pattern. small particles are preferred for penetration to the tracheobronchial and pulmonary regions of the lung. small particles will distribute close to the head airway region via impaction. biosampler airflow, airflow into and out of exposure chamber, flow rate for aerodynamic particle sizer, and plethysmography protocols are programmed into the AAMP. prior to animal experimentation, aerosol generation, biosampling, particle size distribution, and plethysmography protocols are validated and optimized. the inhaled dose for the set duration of the exposure can be back-calculated using either predetermined, formula-generated minute volume values or actual minute volume values obtained via plethysmography. in larger animals, the inhaled dose is calculated using a simplified formula, cc/min = 2.1 (body weight in grams)0.75 [24] aerosol studies are a necessary part of research on infectious agents that are either naturally or intentionally spread by the respiratory route. an efficient, reliable, and safe environment is ensured for in vivo research with high consequence viral pathogens."}
