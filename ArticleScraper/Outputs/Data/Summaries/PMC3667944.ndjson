{"summary": "the development of subunit vaccines through genetic engineering has the potential to phase out whole pathogen vaccines and their associated safety risks. the development of subunit vaccines through genetic engineering has the potential to phase out whole pathogen vaccines and their associated safety risks. VLPs are more stable than subunit vaccines and can be manufactured with recombinant technology in expression systems without requiring the capability to support viral replication. the particulate nature of VLPs allows them to induce potent T-cell mediated immune responses through interaction with antigen-presenting cells. a single VLP feeds thousands of epitopes into the processing and presentation machinery of APCs, further enhancing their potency in CTL induction. particles of 20\u2013200 nm can diffuse rapidly to lymph nodes, allowing VLPs to be presented efficiently to B and T cells. five VLP-based vaccines for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) have been approved by regulatory agencies and licensed commercially. they have demonstrated excellent safety profiles, high effectiveness, and the ability to induce long-lasting antibody responses in humans. the major challenge is to develop novel production platforms that can overcome issues of the current production systems. we will highlight recent achievements in expression and assembly of VLPs in plant systems as well as their immunogenicity in animal models and safety and efficacy in humans. bacteria-derived HBsAg is non-immunogenic and difficult to purify from the host cell. in yeast cells, HBsAg VLPs can be produced, but the antigens are aglycosylated, unlike those found in infected sera. plant biomass generation and upstream processing capacity can be operated and scaled-up in a flexible, capital-efficient manner that cannot be easily matched by current fermentation-based technologies. the development of new plant expression systems and progress in plant glycoengineering has all been overcome by the development of new plant expression systems. the development of plant virus-based transient plant expression systems has overcome the challenges of VLP production speed and yield. cloning and high-level transient expression of plant-derived VLPs is simple and can be achieved quickly in 1\u20132 weeks of vector infiltration with a tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) RNA replicon. this approach is appealing because it may eliminate or reduce the need for the costly downstream processing. the needle-free delivery method and natural preservation of vaccines in plant tissue may circumvent logistic challenges. general concerns for efficacy of orally delivered subunit vaccines include the possible denaturation and degradation of antigens by the digestion system. new expression vectors have allowed more consistent VLP accumulation per unit of plant tissue. current plant expression systems offer the traditional advantages of proper eukaryotic protein modification and assembly, low cost, high scalability and increased safety. plants are proficient in expressing and assembling both enveloped and non-enveloped VLPs, including those with more than two types of proteins and chimeric proteins. plants are proficient in expressing and assembling both enveloped and non-enveloped VLPs, including those with more than two types of proteins and chimeric proteins. NVCP is the major cause of non-bacterial gastroenteritis in the world. the 58 kDa NVCP alone in insect cells is sufficient to drive the assembly of a non-enveloped icosahedral VLP. the NVCP VLPs are composed of 90 dimers of NVCP in a T = 3 symmetry. NVCP VLPs are acid and protease resistant and stable in the oral-gastrointestinal environment. the unique structure of VLPs allows them to potentially overcome these challenges and elicit potent gut immune response upon oral delivery. NVCP VLPs orally delivered in freeze-dried tomato were more immunogenic than that in freeze-dried potato tubers. the relative low phenolic and high antioxidant (i.e., ascorbic acid) content of tomato fruits provided a less oxidative environment than that of potato tubers and resulted in better VLP stability. the beYDV replicon system permits NVCP VLP expression and assembly with as high of a level and efficiency in lettuce as those of MagnICON system in N. benthamiana. the highest level of VLP accumulation was observed within 4 d of lettuce infiltration,30 a week faster than the MagnICON system in tobacco. NV is a member of the norovirus genus. there is still no licensed norovirus vaccine for human use on the market. HBcAg is highly immunogenic and has been shown to enhance the immunogenicity of HBsAg VLPs when co-delivered together. the full virus-based expression vectors also suffer from the drawback of coproduction of plant virus particles. deconstructed MagnICON vector allowed even higher-level HBcAg expression (2.38 mg/g FLW) in N. benthamiana. intraperitoneal injection of partially purified HBcAg VLPs (20 g per dose at weeks zero and two) stimulated strong serum antibody responses in mice, with the same timing and intensity as the E. coli-produced VLPs. plant-derived HPV16 and 11 VLPs were shown to be as immunogenic as the commercial vaccines in mice and rabbits when administered subcutaneously. however, subsequent oral or subcutaneous delivery of low doses of purified VLPs significantly boosted the L1-specific response. toxin as an adjuvant provoked RTV-specific serum IgG and fecal IgA responses comparable to those of attenuated RTV vaccines. plant-produced RTV VLPs are effective yet low-cost vaccine candidates against RTV. HBsAg VLPs isolated from plasma are the first licensed VLP vaccine for preventing an infectious disease. yeast-produced HBsAg VLPs are also the first VLPs ever produced in plants. s were superior to the yeast-derived antigen in both priming and boosting anti-HBsAg IgG responses in mice. these preclinical successes have led to two human clinical trials with plant-derived HBsAg VLPs. soluble HA antigen or inactivated virus in inducing antibodies against a broader panel of distinct influenza isolates. soluble HA antigen from two Type A influenza strains (H5N1 and H1N1) accumulate at a level of 50 g/g FLW in the apoplast, the space between the plasma membrane and the cell wall. the antigenicity of plant-derived HA VLPs has been tested in animal models. a single dose (5 g) of H1N1 (swine flu)-H1 VLPs induced a positive immune response in 100% of animals. homologous strain meets the protective criteria of influenza vaccine established for product licensure by the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human use (CHMP) the same study also demonstrated the efficacy against heterologous H5N1 virus. two doses (5 g) of injection in mice triggered a potent HI antibody response with a mean HI titer of 1:385 in the presence of the adjuvant (alum) and 1:116 in the absence of alum. this real-life test demonstrated that a highly efficacious pandemic VLP vaccine can be produced in plants within days from the identification of a new influenza strain. plant-derived VLPs were able to boost both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice primed with a Gag DNA vaccine. this suggests that a T-cell stimulating HIV vaccine based on plant-derived VLPs is becoming possible. gen,96 HBsAg VLPs displaying hepatocyte receptor binding epitope,97 HBsAg VLPs displaying HIV-1 ENV and GAG epitopes98 and HIV-1 Gag VLPs produced in N. benthamiana99. leaf tissue was infiltrated with Agrobacterium harboring the WNV prM-E construct. membranes were incubated with an anti-WNV E antibody (Lanes 1\u20133) or an anti- HBsAg S protein Stable transgenic plants, Transient expression with MagnICON and Geminiviral \u201cdeconstructed\u201d viral vectors Tobacco, lettuce, tomato, tomatillo, potato, corn, banana, N. benthamiana, soybean IP induced better serum anti-HBsAg responses in mice. anti-HIV-1 specific CD8+ cell activation in mice.95,114 HBsAg VLP displaying HBV preS1 epitope Stable transgenic plants Rice IP induced both anti-preS1 and anti-HBsAg responses in mice. genetic fusion offers several advantages including a stable bond between VLPs and the fused antigen and a less complex manufacturing process for the target cVLPs. many antigens are incompatible with VLP assembly and only small peptides shorter than 30 amino acids can be displayed. the domain III (DIII) of the WNV E protein was genetically fused to HBcAg. cVLPs provoke strong B and T-cell responses superior to that of the non-fused DIII antigen. chimeric VLPs induced a neutralizing antibody response similar to that from an equivalent amount of the commercial vaccine (Gardasil\u00ae) in mice. chimeric HPV L1 VLPs also elicited CTLs activities against the E6 and E7 epitopes. chimeric HBsAg VLPs displaying HIV-1 ENV and GAG epitopes were produced in transgenic tomato. chimeric HBsAg VLPs displaying HIV-1 ENV and GAG epitopes were produced in transgenic tomato. a cVLP consisting of the envelope protein gp41 and Gag of HIV-1 was also produced in N. benthamiana. transient expression of a \u201cdeconstructed\u201d version of gp41 in stable Gag-expressing transgenic plants suggested that the two proteins may assemble into chimeric enveloped VLPs. the conjugation approach has also allowed the creation of chimeric VLPs that display nonprotein antigens. chimeric VLPs are well tolerated and elicit high anti-nicotine antibody titers and consequently promoted abstinence from smoking up to 12 mo in immunized volunteers. genetic fusion offers several advantages including a stable bond between VLPs and the fused antigen and a less complex manufacturing process for the target cVLPs. many antigens are incompatible with VLP assembly and only small peptides shorter than 30 amino acids can be displayed. the domain III (DIII) of the WNV E protein was genetically fused to HBcAg. in this construct, the domain III (DIII) of the WNV E protein was genetically fused to HBcAg. cVLPs provoke strong B and T-cell responses. chimeric HPV L1-E6/E7 VLPs have also been created by genetic fusion to display epitopes of influenza M2 protein. chimeric VLPs have been employed to develop animal vaccines. several enveloped chimeric VLPs have been produced in plants. for example, the 239 amino-acid full length GFP was genetically fused to HBsAg and the fusion protein was shown to fold correctly and form VLPs in plants. a leaf co-expression of the fusion protein resulted in disulfide cross-linking to create heterodimers. a cVLP consisting of the envelope protein gp41 and Gag of HIV-1 was also produced in N. benthamiana. transient expression of a \u201cdeconstructed\u201d version of gp41 in stable Gag-expressing transgenic plants suggested that the two proteins may assemble into chimeric enveloped VLPs. antismoking therapeutic vaccine was successfully developed by conjugating nicotine to VLPs of the bacteriophage Qb. antigens can be linked to VLPs through either covalent or noncovalent bonds. 1,72,118 epitopes from a variety of pathogens have been chemically conjugated to plant viruses (PV) the resulting chimeric plant virus particles have been shown to be immunogenic and even protective in animal models. the application of chemical conjugation of antigens to plant-produced non-PV VLPs has not been reported. peptide containing determinants of glycoprotein and nucleoprotein of rabies virus (RV) was fused to the N-terminus of the alfalfa mosaic virus (AlMV) CP and cloned into viral vectors. the chimeric peptide displayed on the RV cPVPs was more immunogenic than the non-conjugated peptide co-delivered with adjuvant in mice. plant-derived cPVPs displaying RV epitopes may provide an affordable, safer, and needle-free vaccine alternative for the developing world. the activation of cell-mediated immune responses by cPVPs has also been demonstrated. a single subcutaneous injection of 1 mg of the chimeric particles protected 100% mink from a lethal challenge of MEV. protective immunity was also demonstrated for cPVPs that display epitopes of urine hepatitis coronavirus,130 foot-and mouth disease virus (FMDV),131,132 and bacterial origin. meric CMVs also stimulated IFN- production by DC8+ T cells from HCV patients.198,199 HCV HVR1 of E2 epitope-CTB fusion TMV N. benthamiana IN delivery elicited weak gp120 specific antibody response in mice. MV Tobacco IP delivery induced strong cellular and humoral responses in monkeys. GP and NP AIMV/TMV N. benthamiana IP induced long-term protective immunity against lethal challenge of RV in mice. recombinant tobamovirus fused the CP to a functional protein A fragment of the same size. viral replication, particle assembly, and systemic movement of the recombinant virus were found adequately active. cPVPs and VLPs can also be created by chemical conjugation. cPVPs and cVLPs with stable bonds would have a more stable antigen on their surface. it was suggested that cPVPs would have a more stable crystalline array of antigen on their surface. cPVPs chemically-conjugated with T-cell epitopes also stimulated potent CTL responses. cPVPs suffer from several inherent disadvantages. for example, conformational epitopes may not be presented as correctly as by native virus or corresponding VLPs. the biggest challenge may come from the regulatory aspect of this technology. the presence of mixed and inconsistent glycosylation types is a common phenomenon for most mammalian cell-produced glycoproteins. the unique plant glycosylation pattern can be advantageous for certain pharmaceutical applications, as in the case of glucocerebrosidase (GCD). mammalian cell-produced GCD requires in vitro N-glycan processing to achieve the desired efficacy. carrot-cell produced GCD already has the required glycoform. plant-specific glycans provide a unique advantage for producing flu VLPs vaccines based solely on HA. 146,152This portfolio of plant lines provides a superior system for producing VLPs with defined and uniform carbohydrate constituents. the creation of these plants provides an additional advantage for plant-based expression systems to become a desirable VLP production platform. downstream processing for a particular VLP depends on the size, shape and architecture of the assembled VLPs. lipid bilayer is often targeted for their purification. separation of enveloped VLPs from host cell-derived membrane-bound vesicles is often difficult. the major challenge for insect cell-produced VLP processing is the separation of the target VLPs from baculovirus particles. centrifugation and density gradient methods are widely used for characterizing VLP size and assembly. ultracentrifugation and density gradient methods are widely used for characterizing VLP size and assembly. however, their application to large-scale commercial VLP manufacturing is limited because they are time-consuming and difficult to scale up. membrane chromatography based on newer, disposable membrane technology is gaining momentum as the leading alternative to traditional beads for VLP purification. membrane-based separation methods have gained increasing importance in the capture and polishing steps including microfiltration for media clarification and product sterilization. the development of virus-based transient expression systems has significantly increased the yield of VLPs in plant expression systems. the cost of downstream processing has become an increasingly significant proportion (> 80%) of the total cost. affinity chromatography is a powerful separation technique that may reduce the number of purification steps and increase yield and purity. the commonly used affinity ligands are biologics which are expensive to make, prone to degradation, easily denatured by sanitizing agents, and likely to leech into the purified products. the low cost of peptide production will likely allow the large-scale application of this technology. the feasibility of efficiently extracting and purifying enveloped VLPs from plants at a commercial scale has been demonstrated by the production of influenza VLPs vaccines. the cGMP VLPs have been tested in human clinical trials. their efficacy and safety in human studies has been demonstrated. it is critical to prevent plant host contaminants from entering processing feed streams at an early stage. two doses of 20 g vaccination of plant-derived VLPs elicited an immune response that meets all three protective criteria. this trial demonstrated the safety of the plant-derived VLP vaccine in humans as it was well tolerated at all doses. the sponsor is planning a phase II human trial for its seasonal trivalent vaccine with the recommended H1N1, H3N2 and B influenza strains. the results suggest that plant-made VLPs are viable human vaccine candidates against both seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses. poor VLP assembly in potato tubers caused variable effective VLP dosage. it is also possible that VLPs were not effectively released from the potato tissue in the gut lumen, further reducing the effectiveness of the antigen. this suggests purified NVCP VLP is a better oral vaccine candidate than that in unprocessed plant tissue. the protective anti-HBsAg level for humans has been defined as > 10 mIU/ml. the protective anti-HBsAg level for humans has been defined as > 10 mIU/ml. six out of nine participants fed with rabies recombinant spinach showed significant increase in rabies-specific serum IgG or IgA levels. three antigen-consumed subjects, but none of the control volunteers, developed neutralizing antibodies against rabies following the single-dose administration of HDCV. 4.4 billion combined accumulative revenue for the two HPV VLP vaccines (through year end 2009), and average annual revenue of $ 993 million, $64 million, and $26 million for the three HBV vaccines. the urgent need of vaccines in resource-poor countries and the encouraging revenue numbers have attracted more interest than ever from the pharmaceutical industry. this last hurdle has been overcome by the recent approval of a plant-produced GCD by the FDA for treating Gaucher disease. we speculate that many successful cases and novel applications of plant-made VLPs will emerge in the near future."}
