{"summary": "iron is a critical cofactor for many host and bacterial enzymes. many vertebrate-associated bacteria harbor high-affinity uptake systems targeting heme. the most abundant source of heme iron in the mammalian host is hemoglobin. IsdB is the primary hemoglobin receptor for S. aureus. it is highly expressed in human blood (14) and a promising vaccine target (15), underscoring its importance in human disease. heme is the preferred iron source of S. aureus during murine infection (21) the transferrin family of iron-binding proteins has undergone extremely rapid evolution in primates at protein surfaces bound by iron acquisition receptors from Gram-negative bacteria. these findings are consistent with the existence of a long-standing evolutionary conflict for nutrient iron. mutations in iron-binding proteins that prevent bacterial scavenging protect the host from infection and are favored by natural selection. all tests detected significant evidence of positive selection acting on both - and -globins using both species and gene phylogenies. multiple analyses repeatedly identified two sites in - and -globins exhibiting strong signatures of positive selection (Fig. 1A) phylogenies for the 27 -globin and 30 -globin orthologs analyzed. hominoid (orange), Old World monkey (purple) and new world monkeys (brown) are shown. the full phylogenetic trees are displayed in Fig. 3 and 4. an established biochemical assay was used to measure the binding of hemoglobin by S. aureus. the binding patterns did not strictly match the predictions based on host phylogeny. the binding patterns did not strictly match the predictions based on host phylogeny. growth of S. aureus in iron-depleted medium with 2.5 g/ml of purified recombinant hemoglobin as the sole iron source. compared to growth using human hemoglobin. copyright 2018 Choby et al. this content is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. each gel represents a biological replicate from independent binding assays. Molecular weight markers are indicated, with arrow showing hemoglobin band. chimeras containing either human - or -globin were bound more effectively than baboon hemoglobin. -globin T8 and N78 were found to be proximal to the NEAT1 domain of IsdB. species-specific diversity in -globin restricts heme scavenging by S. aureus. an iron-starved S. aureus wild type was incubated with purified recombinant hemoglobin, including mutagenized human hemoglobin. bound hemoglobin was quantified. panel A shows the means from 6 independent experiments with 2 to 3 biological replicates. -globin divergence contributes to S. aureus hemoglobin binding. baboon and human -globins differ at both positions 9 and 76. baboon and human -globins differ at both positions 9 and 76. no single residue substitution improved binding by S. aureus IsdB. this is consistent with the NEAT1 domain of multiple IsdB monomers engaging in hemoglobin capture by binding both - and -globins. IsdB diversity among related staphylococcal strains impacts primate-specific hemoglobin capture. the variation among related staphylococcal strains impacts species-specific hemoglobin capture. S. aureus lacking native isdB but harboring constitutively expressed plasmid-borne isdB variants were incubated with purified recombinant hemoglobin. hominoid (orange), old world monkey (purple) and new world monkeys (brown) were bound hemoglobin quantified. Q162 and S170T were mutagenized in S. aureus IsdB to mimic the sequence of S. schweitzeri and S. argenteus. these residues are not expected to disrupt IsdB tertiary structure. reus isdB variants using hemoglobin as the sole iron source were monitored over time. panel C shows the means from three independent experiments with 3 biological replicates SEM; **, P 0.005; ***, P 0.0005 by two-way ANOVA. panel D shows the results of two independent experiments with six biological replicates each standard deviation. multiple analyses repeatedly identified two sites in - and -globins exhibiting strong signatures of positive selection. it became apparent that these rapidly evolving sites localized to similar regions of the - and -globin proteins, specifically, the N-terminal A helix and the hinge region between the E and F helices. parallel signatures of selection between - and -globins might indicate that a similar selective pressure has driven this divergence between primate species. selection were identified in -globin and -globin (blue arrows) using PAML. identity between globins is noted as conserved (*), highly similar (:) and similar (.) the binding patterns did not strictly match the predictions based on host phylogeny. we then determined the ability of primate hemoglobins to support growth of S. aureus as the sole iron source. variation among primate globins dictates bacterial hemoglobin capture. a representative silver-stained SDS-PAGE gel of recombinant Hb was loaded (lane 2) to demonstrate apparent molecular weight. the apparent hemoglobin band is specific to Hb, as it is not visible when S. aureus is incubated with PBS alone (lane 3) copyright 2018 Choby et al distributed this content under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. each dot is a single biological replicate from three independent experiments, with one missing for talapoin. baboon chimera bound significantly better than -baboon -human. -globin T8 and N78 were found to be proximal to the NEAT1 domain of IsdB. substituting the Thr residue of human -globin with the Lys residue reduced binding by S. aureus. us wild type was incubated with purified recombinant hemoglobin, and bound hemoglobin was quantified. panel A shows the means from 3 independent experiments with 2 to 3 biological replicates. panel E shows the means from 2 independent experiments with 2 to 3 biological replicates. baboon and human -globins differ at both positions 9 and 76, suggesting that these residues contribute to the inability of IsdB to bind baboon hemoglobin. species phylogenies and sequence alignments surrounding positions exhibiting signatures of positive selection in -globin. an iron-starved S. aureus wild type was incubated with purified recombinant human hemoglobin or variants of human hemoglobin encoding variants in -globin. we measured the ability of IsdB from S. argenteus and S. schweitzeri to bind hemoglobin by expressing them ectopically in S. aureus lacking native isdB gene. however, both the IsdB of S. schweitzeri and S. argenteus displayed reduced binding of talapoin hemoglobin. recombinant hemoglobin and from hominoid (orange), Old World monkey (purple), and New World monkeys (brown) were quantified. the means from three independent experiments with 3 biological replicates SEM are shown;
