{"summary": "patients with bronchospasm received a helium-oxygen mixture at three time points (30, 60, and 120 minutes) this protocol includes patients with bronchospasm who sustained a modified Wood score of moderate to severe. the severity score showed a significant improvement as of 30 minutes (p0.001). the use of the helium-oxygen mixture (heliox) decreases the transpulmonary pressure and improves tidal volume in an experimental study with tracheostomized dogs. in patients with obstructive disease, the turbulent flow of the proximal airways worsens respiratory distress and decreases lung ventilation. the use of the helium-oxygen mixture is not restricted to patients with spontaneous breathing. the effect of Heliox\u00ae in decreasing the inflammatory process of respiratory distress syndrome patients, despite being confirmed, is not yet understood. 0 0.5 1 2 SatO2 95% in RA 90-94% in RA 90% with FiO2>21% 90% with FiO2>21% Breathing sounds Normal Slightly asymmetric

was prescribed for 80% of patients. treatment considered prophylactic was maintained during hospitalization for three patients. the variation of respiratory rate showed a similar progression as the severity score. we did not observe a relation between the days of hospitalization and the severity score (r=0.15 and p=0.4) study showed a high rate of utilization of bronchodilators and oral steroids. another recommendation would be the use of the heliox only one hour after starting the conventional drug treatment. the time between the start of drug treatment and the installation of the helium-oxygen mixture was 10 hours. in two successful cases, there was an association with noninvasive ventilation. the need for ventilators prepared to receive the mixture limits the process. a review as to the use of noninvasive mechanical ventilation with Heliox\u00ae reinforces the complementary role of both therapies. use of the helium-oxygen mixture in children with obstructive diseases showed positive outcomes, with a significant reduction in distress score and respiratory rate in the first 30 minutes of use."}{"summary": "patients with bronchospasm received a helium-oxygen mixture
