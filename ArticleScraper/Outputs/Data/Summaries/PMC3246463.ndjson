{"summary": "the transmission of viruses from bats to humans has been proven only for rabies and some other lyssaviruses [3], as well as for Nipah and Hendra virus [5]. a wide range of highly pathogenic viruses have been detected in bats, e.g. Ebola [7] and Marburg [8] viruses. a wide range of highly pathogenic viruses have been detected in bats. ing the subfamily Parvovirinae (viruses that infect vertebrates) and the subfamily Densovirinae (viruses that infect arthropods) are non-enveloped viruses, containing a single stranded DNA genome of approximately 5 kb. the parvovirinae subfamily is currently subdivided into 5 well established genera (Parvovirus, Amdovirus, Erythrovirus, Dependovirus, Boc two new parvoviruses were identified by applying this methodology. the nearly full-length genome sequences were determined, their prevalence in the respective populations was investigated, and viral concentrations in blood and different organs were determined. virus discovery cDNA-AFLP was performed with 110 l of pooled serum/EDTA-plasma samples as previously described. Sequence analysis and nearly full-length genome sequencing Primer and MID sequences were trimmed from every read. sequences were then assembled with codonCode Aligner software version 3.5.6. 10 pools (10 eluates each) were prepared with 40 l of each DNA isolate from Ghanaian Eidolon helvum serum samples. 22 pools (5 eluates each) were made with 5 l of each DNA preparation from Panamanian Artibeus bats specimens. DNA was isolated from organ tissues of Eidolon helvum bats found to be parvovirus-positive. TCCTTTGGAT Quantification EhParvo-quant-forward GAGGCAGCTCGCAATCATG EhParvo-quant-reverse GACGTCCCCGTGGGAAATG-MGBNFQ Amplicons from the hemi-nested PCRs were TA cloned into the pCR\u00ae4-TOPO\u00ae plasmid vector according to the instructions of the manufacturer. nucleic acid concentration was determined spectrophotometrically. bootstrap test (1000 replicates) [32] was performed using the Neighbor-Joining method. only clusters associated with a value higher than 75% were considered significant. positions where both sequences have a gap did not contribute and positions with a gap in only one sequence counted as mismatch. whole EDTA blood samples from Panamanian artibeus jamaicensis and A. lituratus fruit bats were exported under a state agreement between the Republic of Ghana and the Federal Republic of Germany. additional export permission was obtained from the Veterinary Services of the Ghana Ministry of Food and Agriculture. Identified viral fragments were used as a template for primer design. Molecular screening and parvovirus quantification in blood and organs DNA from 100 serum samples collected from Ghanaian Eidolon helvum bats was isolated. liver (n = 6), kidneys (n = 7), spleen (n = 7), small intestine (n = 5) and large intestine (n = 4) were analyzed. nucleic acid was prepared from 20 mg of tissue by using the TissueLyser method. phylogenetic analysis and genome characterization Fifty-nine reference nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences were downloaded from the GenBank database. only complete coding sequences were included in the analysis. evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method for nucleotides. VIDISCA is a virus discovery technique that can identify RNA and DNA viruses without prior knowledge of its genome sequence. the technique was successfully used to discover human coronavirus NL63. genome walking was possible to amplify and sequence the viral genome from 2 previously unknown members of the Parvovirinae subfamily. no other reads with clear identity to any known viruses were detected in any of the samples. olon helvum parvovirus was performed with full genome as well as with separate genes and proteins. we named the novel virus Eidolon helvum Parvovirus 1 (Eh-BtPV-1). Phylogenetically, Eh-BtPV-1 was located between the Porcine Parvovirus 2 (PPV2) and the PARV4-like groups resembling a separate branch near the root of the PARV4-like the NS1 protein of Eh-BtPV-1 is equally distant from NS1 of all other PARV4-like viruses. the protein is on average 41.4% amino acid identical to primates viruses, 42.4% identical to the bovine virus and 43.8% identical to porcine virus. the NS1 protein of Eh-BtPV-1 is equally distant from NS1 of all other PARV4-like viruses. 97 48.2 47.6 ChimpPTV ORF1 48.5 81.2 82 79.8 - 54.6 56.3 ORF2 54.9 85 84.7 84.5 - 64.5 64.9 MARF 59.8 98.5 98 98.5 - 48.2 47.6 PHoV ORF1 46.5 55.1 55.3 54.7 55.6 - 67.7 ORF2 53.1 62.9 62.9 63 63.4 - 66.1 MARF 60.1 59. the bovine virus, 50.2% with the porcine virus and on average 50.3% with the primate and human viruses. the VP1 of Eh-BtPV-1 contains the phospholipase A2 motif. this motif is located in the N-terminal VP1 region that does not overlap the VP2 protein (VP1 unique region) 7 (7%) resulted positive for the presence of Eh-BtPV-1. Viral concentrations ranged from 2.84E+4 to 1.47E+10 copies/ml. the boldface viral concentrations indicate organs with a concentration at least 10 fold higher than serum. the sequences obtained from the Eh-BtPV-1-positive bats (both from blood and organs) were 98.7\u2013100% identical to each other, demonstrating the circulation of a single type in the analyzed bat population. phylogenetic analysis showed no clustering in the different trees and no clearly identifiable closest relative in any of the known genera. the top identity percentages of Aj-BtPV-1 were found with Dependoviruses. the first one (at position 1965 of the sequenced genome) is only 3 nucleotides after the stop codon. the second start codon is located at position 2025. tPV-1-positive animals belonged to the frugivorous bat species Artibeus jamaicensis (7/92, 7.6%) and one animal belonged to the closely related frugivorous bat species Artibeus lituratus (1/18, 5.5%). the phylogenetic tree was based on a 740 nt fragment (nucleotides 3820\u20134561) of Aj-BtPV identified in artibeus jamaic in one pool of 2 serum samples collected from frugivorous Eidelon helvum bats from Ghana. in one pool of 50 EDTA blood samples collected from frugivorous artibeus jamaicensis bats from Panama 136 parvoviral hits. 168 parvoviral hits (2.4% of the Artibeus jamaicensis bat reads,resulting in 22 different fragments) VP1 (919 aa) and VP2 (544 aa) were identified by using ORF finder. an additional ORF (Middle Alternative Reading Frame, MARF, nucleotides 2829\u20133062) were also identified. the NS1 protein of Eh-BtPV-1 is equally distant from NS1 of all other PARV4-like viruses. the NS1 protein of Eh-BtPV-1 is equally distant from NS1 of all other PARV4-like viruses.

MARF overlaps with the PLA2 motif in the VP1 unique coding region. the boldface viral concentrations indicate organs with a concentration at least 10 fold higher than serum. a viral concentration is indicated as copies/ml in serum and copies/g of tissue obtained from different organs; NEG = negative; NA = not available. spleen and kidney are potential replication sites of Eh-BtPV-1. the 5\u2032 ORF (nucleotides 174\u20132252) putatively encodes for the non structural protein (NS1, 692 aa) and the 3\u2032 ORF (nucleotides 2279\u20135038) for structural viral proteins VP1 (919 aa) and VP2 (544 aa) virus 2 (PPV2) and PARV4-like groups resembling a separate branch near the root of the PARV4-like genus thus sharing a common ancestor with human PARV4-like viruses. NS1 protein phylogenetic analysis of Eh-BtPV-1 and Aj-BtPV-1 with 59 reference NS1 proteins obtained from GenBank. .9% and 96.8%, Table 2). Identity ranges (%) of the 3 ORFs at amino acid (bold) and nucleotide level between species in the PARV4-like virusesa. the VP1 protein of Eh-BtPV-1 (919 aa) coded by ORF2 appears to be larger than VP1 of the primate PARV4-like viruses (914 aa) but smaller than the one of the porcine hokovirus (925 aa) and the VP1 of the bovine virus (931 aa) like NS1, VP1 protein of Eh-BtPTV-1 is similarly equidistant from the lipase A2 is located in the N-terminal VP1 region that does not overlap the VP2 protein (VP1 unique region) as expected, this motif was conserved among all PARV4-like viruses. the catalytic domain of PLA2 (HDXXY) had only one difference in Eh-BtPV-1 compared to all the other viruses. the boldface viral concentrations indicate organs with a concentration at least 10 fold higher than serum. the boldface viral concentrations indicate organs with a concentration at least 10 fold higher than in serum. the sequences obtained from the Eh-BtPV-1-positive bats (both from blood and organs) were 98.7\u2013100% identical to each other, demonstrating the circulation of a single type in the analyzed bat population. beyond this, all the sequences obtained from samples belonging to the same bat (but different body districts) were identical, showing no apparent variability during the infection. Dependoviruses were found with 53.4 to 59.6% at the amino acid level. but all trees were consistent with the previous ones. two alternative start codons could be hypothesized as the transcriptional origin of the VP1 protein. phylogenetic analysis of a 740 nt fragment (nucleotides 4329\u20134561) amplified from different bats showed three different viral types. type 1 and 2 were the most closely related towards each other. type 3 (only one sequence available) was the most diverse one. 61 of Aj-BtPV-1 NS1 ORF was possible to identify a more conserved region of approx. 500 nucleotides. this region was then used to perform additional alignments and create further phylogenetic trees. the top identity percentages of Aj-BtPV-1 were found with Dependoviruses. the phylogenetic tree was based on a 740 nt fragment (nucleotides 3820\u20134561) of Aj-BtPV identified in Artibeus jamaicensis and Artibeus lituratus (#174) bats from Panama. three types of Aj-BtPV-1 were distinguishable. bats are the only mammals able to fly and some species regularly travel more than 3000 km crossing large stretches of land and water barriers. the scientific community increasingly recognizes bats as natural reservoir host for many zoonotic diseases including a wide range of viruses. a rapid mutation rate and the tendency to recombine make a virus more prone to spread in a new host species [40]\u2013[42]. Eh-BtPV-1 is the first potentially autonomously replicating member of a putative new parvoviral genus identified in bat blood. the baboon virus could not be included in the phylogenetic analysis due to the limited length of baboon viral sequence. a greater spectrum of PARV4-like viruses potentially present in bats has to be elucidated. it can be assumed either humans or other mammals could have played a role in transmitting the ancestral virus from bats to the other species. discovery could open new research paths aiming to search for similar viruses in other mammals including humans. presence of high viral variability may also increase the chance that further mutations could favor a viral transmission to other species. the two parvoviruses reported here were identified from blood samples. none other viral sequences were identified during our study. the presence of bat parvovirus in the intestinal tissue suggests that those viruses might be present in feces."}
