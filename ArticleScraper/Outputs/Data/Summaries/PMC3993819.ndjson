{"summary": "worldwide circulation of influenza A viruses in avian and mammalian hosts provides the basis for the emergence of novel influenza viruses that may cause outbreaks of severe respiratory disease or even provoke an influenza pandemic. the outbreak of an avian H7N9 influenza virus in 2013 that caused 137 confirmed human infections and 45 deaths (WHO; 52) once again demonstrated that the emergence of novel influenza viruses poses unpredictable challenges for public health. influenza virus infection is initiated by HA through attachment to cell surface receptors and fusion of the viral lipid envelope and endosomal membranes upon endocytosis to release the virus genome into the cytosol. most influenza viruses, including low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) and human viruses, possess a single arginine (R) at the cleavage site and are activated by trypsin in vitro. knockout of TMPRSS2 protects mice from lung infection with lethal outcome by H7N9 and H1N1 viruses. knockout of TMPRSS2 did not affect pneumotropism and lethality of H3N2 virus in mice, indicating another protease is responsible for activation of H3 HA. explants of trachea, bronchi, and lung were separately maintained in 12-well plates. incubation and infection of explants were performed in DMEM; Gibco. RT-PCR analysis of MAT1- and TMPRSS2-specific mRNA in respiratory tissues of wild-type and TMPRSS2 knockout mice. infection medium supplemented with 0.3 mg/ml Geneticin (Gibco) and 2 g/ml puromycin (InvivoGen) protease expression was induced by addition of 0.4 g/ml doxycycline (InvivoGen) total RNA of murine respiratory tissues was extracted using the RNeasy minikit. RT-PCR was carried out with 1 g of total RNA by using the oneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) cDNAs of murine TMPRSS2 and MAT1 were cloned from total RNA of the lung and trachea. cells were seeded in 24-well plates and grown with or without 0.4 g/ml doxycycline for 24 h. cells were infected at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 to 0.0001 and incubated for 24 h. 103 PFU of H7N9 or H1N1 or 105 PFU of H3N2 for 1 h. at 16, 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection, virus titers were determined as PFU/ml. toChem Plus HRP-3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) broad-spectrum kit (Zytomed) according to manufacturer's protocols. all animal experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the german animal protection law. RT-PCR analysis of MAT1- and TMPRSS2-specific mRNA was used as a control. cells and viruses maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS (Gibco), glutamine, and antibiotics. all cell growth and incubations were performed at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. H7N9, H3N2, and H1N1pdm were propagated in MDCK cells. all experiments with H7N9 influenza virus were performed at biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facilities. cDNAs of murine TMPRSS2 and MAT1 were subcloned into expression vector pTRE2pur (Clontech) all primer sequences are available upon request. RT-PCR of -tubulin mRNA was used as an internal control. cells were grown in 6-well plates in absence or presence of doxycycline for 24 h. cells were infected at an MOI of 0.05 to 0.001 for 1 h. proteins in cell lysates or cell supernatants were visualized using the ChemiDoc XRS+ system with Image Lab software. TMPRSS2/ mice (n = 16) were intraperitoneally anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine (100 and 10 mg/kg, respectively) and intranasally inoculated with a volume of 50 l of 105 PFU of H7N9, H1N1pdm, or H3N2 virus diluted in PBS. mice were monitored for disease, survival, and weight loss for 14 days. MAT1 mRNA was present predominantly in the larynx and at lower levels in the trachea and bronchi but was not detected in the lung. TMPRSS2/ mice express TMPRSS2 in the larynx, trachea, and bronchi but only TMPRSS2 in the lung. TMPRSS2 is essential for replication of H7N9 influenza virus in murine respiratory cells. explants of murine trachea, bronchi, or lung were infected with 4 103 PFU H7N9 or H1N1 or 105 PFU of H3N2. replication of human strains A/PR8/1/34 (H1N1) and A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) was analyzed in airway explants of TMPRSS2/ and WT mice. TMPRSS2 is essential for pathogenicity of H7N9 and H1N1pdm, but not H3N2 virus in mice. TMPRSS2/ mice and wild-type littermates were infected with 105 PFU of the indicated virus. survival (A) and weight loss (B) were monitored for 14 days. TMPRSS2 and MDCK-MAT1 cells with doxycycline-inducible protease expression were infected with the indicated virus at a low MOI. either cells were immunostained against the viral nucleoprotein at 24 h p.i. or cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis at 40 h p.i. TMPRSS2 and MDCK-MAT1 cells were infected with the indicated virus. virus-containing supernatants or cell lysates (H7N9-infected cells) were subjected to SDS-PAGE. cells without induction of protease expression were used as controls. SS2 and MAT1 may support multicycle replication of H3N2 virus in tracheas and bronchi of TMPRSS2/ mice and probably also WT mice. the differences in susceptibility to TMPRSS2 correlate with the obtained virus growth kinetics in airway explants. TMPRSS2/ mice presented reduced numbers of infected cells in the tracheas. pdm also led to severe weight loss, and 20% of the animals died. infection of mice with 105 PFU H3N2 virus resulted in 100% lethality in both animals within 6 days after infection. mRNA was present predominantly in the larynx and at lower levels in the trachea and bronchi but was not detected in the lung. TMPRSS2/ mice express TMPRSS2 in the larynx, trachea, and bronchi but only TMPRSS2 in the lung. TMPRSS2/ mice express TMPRSS2 in the larynx, trachea, and bronchi but lack expression of the two proteases in explants of murine trachea, bronchi, or lung were infected with 4 103 PFU H7N9 or H1N1 or 105 PFU of H3N2. replication of human strains A/PR8/1/34 (H1N1) and A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) was analyzed in airway explants of TMPRSS2/ and WT mice. TMPRSS2 is essential for pathogenicity of H7N9 and H1N1pdm, but not H3N2 virus in mice. TMPRSS2/ mice and wild-type littermates were infected with 105 PFU of the indicated virus. survival (A) and weight loss (B) were monitored for 14 days. either cells were immunostained against the viral nucleoprotein at 24 h p.i. or cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis at 40 h p.i. to examine cleavage of the HA0 precursor into the disulfide-linked subunits HA1 and HA2. MDCK-TMPRSS2 and MDCK-MAT1 cells were infected with the indicated virus. cells without induction of protease expression were used as controls. virus-containing supernatants or cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. the differences in susceptibility to TMPRSS2 and MAT1 correlate with the obtained virus growth kinetics in airway explants. the data suggest that MAT1 may support multicycle replication of H3N2 virus in tracheas and bronchi of TMPRSS2/ mice. TMPRSS2/ mice presented reduced numbers of infected cells in the tracheas. no virus-positive cells were detected in the lungs compared to large numbers of infected cells in the lungs of WT mice. infection of mice with 105 PFU H3N2 virus resulted in 100% lethality in both animals within 6 days after infection. H1N1pdm caused apathogenic infection in TMPRSS2/ mice. replication and pathogenicity of H3N2 were only marginally affected by knockout of TMPRSS2. both WT and TMPRSS2/ mice succumbed to disease upon H3N2 infection. replication of H7N9 and H1N1 in airway explants correlated with virus spread in vivo. the lack of H3N2 propagation in lung explants was probably a matter of insufficient initial infection and maintenance of lung explants. it remains unknown which protease activates H3 HA in the lungs of mice. influenza strain A/WSN/33 (H1N1) contains unusual HA cleavage site motifs. many H9N2 influenza isolates from Asia and the Middle East possess di- or tribasic motifs R-S-S-R and R-S-R-R, respectively. a recent study assessed cleavage of the 16 HA subtypes by human TMPRSS2 and HAT in vitro. previous studies demonstrated that proteases secreted by some strains of Staphylococcus aureus are capable of cleaving influenza virus HA with a monobasic cleavage site. TMPRSS2 might be involved in regulation of the airway surface liquid (ASL) volume by proteolytic cleavage of epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) (45). TMPRSS2/ mice lack a discernible phenotype, suggesting functional redundancy in the host (20). TMPRSS2 has been shown to activate also the fusion proteins of influenza B virus, human metapneumovirus, respiratory parainfluenza viruses. the combination of TMPRSS2 inhibitors and NA inhibitors may provide a potential and novel approach for influenza chemotherapy. the present study identified TMPRSS2 as a host cell factor essential for influenza virus pneumotropism and pathogenicity in mice."}
