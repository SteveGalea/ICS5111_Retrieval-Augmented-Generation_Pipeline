{"summary": "new diseases can emerge when existing viruses evolve the ability to bind the ortholog of their cell-surface receptor in a new species (1, 25, 35) the principal genetic component defining host range in coronaviruses is the spike protein on the surface of the virus and, in particular, its receptor-binding domain (RBD) (5, 14). it is believed that the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic resulted from the zoonotic transmission of a coronavirus from bats to humans a bat coronavirus recombined with the coronavirus of a second, unknown species to create a novel hybrid virus that can use ACE2 (20) over long periods of time, coevolutionary dynamics can develop between viruses and their hosts (24) over long periods of time, coevolutionary dynamics can develop between viruses and their hosts (24) some models allow certain codons to evolve under positive selection (M2a and M8). others do not allow positive selection (M1a, M7, and M8a) a model that allows positive selection is compared to a null model. the P value indicates the confidence with which the null model can be rejected. three additional codons were identified in the analysis of the full-length gene. structures have been solved for human ACE2 (36) and for human ACE2 in complex with the SARS-CoV spike protein (17). six residues under positive selection in bat ACE2 correspond to human ACE2 residues that interact with the SARS-CoV spike. ACE2 residues that mediate contact with each virus are indicated in red. five of these cluster around a key glycosylation site at position 90 of human ACE2. position 90 is conserved as an asparagine in many bat species. the attached glycan faces the virus RBD (gray structure in Fig. 2b) the results are consistent with a model in which an ACE2-utilizing bat coronavirus infected civets and/or other intermediate hosts. the data do not support the less parsimonious model that ACE2 utilization was acquired after transmission of a bat coronavirus to another species. others have concluded that phylogenetic incongruencies within coronavirus genomes do not necessarily support a model of interhost virus recombination during the emergence of SARS 86_11_6350__index.html (1,019B, html)."}
