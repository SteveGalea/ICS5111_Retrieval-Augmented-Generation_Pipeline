{"summary": "an unexpectedly high seroprevalence and pathogenic potential of human parvovirus B19 (B19V) have been observed in certain malaria-endemic countries. the study was to assess the effect of CQ and other common antimalarial drugs on B19V infection in vitro and the possible epidemiological consequences for children from Papua new Guinea. ed icosahedral virus has a single-stranded DNA genome. it has been classified within the Erythrovirus genus of the Parvoviridae family. the virus is readily transmitted via the respiratory route and has a worldwide distribution. chloroquine (CQ) was used as first-line treatment for malaria in these countries. at the time the studies were performed in PNG [4] and Niger [5] chloroquine (CQ) was used as first-line agent. a serosurvey performed in Eritrea revealed an unusually high B19V seroprevalence. the study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. UT7/Epo cells were cultured in RPMI, 10% FCS and 2 U/ml of recombinant human erythropoietin (epo; Janssen-Cilag, Midrand, South Africa) the highest concentration of the drugs did not exceed 0.2% of total culture volume. UT7/Epo cells are the most susceptible cell line to B19V infection. BMMCs have been shown to support B19V infection. cells were lysed in protein loading buffer and total proteins resolved by PAGE. blot was probed with mouse antibody against B19V structural proteins (12,000 dilution; US Biologicals, Swampscott, MA), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (120,000 dilution). 111 children 10 years of age with severe anemia (hemoglobin 50 g/L) 89 community-based age and sex-matched healthy control children with a hemoglobin >100 g/L. those with severe anemia represented a subset (15.9%) of all 697 children admitted to Modilon Hospital, Madang province. the assay had a limit of quantitation of 1 g/L for each analyte. written informed consent was obtained from each parent/guardian. the highest concentration of the drugs did not exceed 0.2% of culture volume. UT7/Epo cells are most susceptible cell line to B19V infection. BMMCs have been shown to support B19V infection. mRNA was isolated and viral NS1 quantified using established methods. analysis of viral protein expression UT7/Epo cells were infected as specified above in the presence of 0 or 25 M CQ. at increasing post-infection times, cells were lysed in protein loading buffer and total proteins were resolved by PAGE. UT7/Epo cells were infected with 20,000 viral particles per cell. cells were washed 8 times with PBS to remove unbound virus. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in the presence or absence of antimalarials. plasma was assayed for chloroquine and amodiaquine. the assay had a limit of quantitation of 1 g/L for each analyte. kinetic studies in the presence of 25 M of CQ showed that viral DNA synthesis was more rapid and extensive than in untreated cells. panel A shows the quantification of viral DNA synthesis from HepG2 cells 90 h after infection with B19V in the presence of increasing CQ concentrations (0\u2013200 M) the results are the average of three independent experiments. UT7/Epo cells were infected with B19V at 4\u00b0C for 2 h. the cells were washed with PBS to remove unbound virus. after 24 h, the amount of B19V NS1 RNA was quantified. the data indicate that CQ acts early in B19V infection. panel A shows the decreasing boosting effect of CQ when added at increasing post-infection times. UT7/Epo cells were infected with B19V at 4\u00b0C for 2 h. at progressive post-infection times, CQ (25 M) was added to the cells. after 24 h post-infection, the viral NS1 RNA was quantified. concentrations by B19V IgM/PCR and 4-aminoquinoline status are shown in Figure 5. the lowest concentrations were in the 5 children who were both IgM and PCR positive (i.e. had acute B19 infections) these children had a similar mean age (53 vs 57 months) and body weight (15 kg in both groups) to those who were either IgM or PCR positive (P>0.37 by Mann-Whitney U test) effects of CQ on B19V replication in UT7/Epo cells increased production of NS1 gene transcription after 24 h incubation. at CQ concentrations ranging from 10 to 75 M, NS1 RNA increased up to 1,170%. kinetic studies in the presence of 25 M of CQ showed that viral DNA synthesis was more rapid and extensive than in untreated cells. panel B shows the quantification of viral RNA transcription in BMMCs at increasing post-infection times in the presence of 0 or 25 M CQ. results represent mean values from two independent experiments. UT7/Epo cells were infected with B19V at 4\u00b0C for 2 h. the cells were washed with PBS to remove unbound virus and incubated at 37\u00b0C. after 24 h, the amount of B19V NS1 RNA was quantified. UT7/Epo cells were infected with B19V. at progressive post-infection times, the cells were washed and the viral DNA was quantified. a trendline was plotted using the average values from two independent experiments. percentages with malaria were similar (40.0 vs 44.4%; P = 0.63 by Fisher's exact test) in patients who were either IgM or PCR positive (but not both), 4-aminoquinoline use was associated with a significantly lower hemoglobin concentration (P = 0.037) consistent with the in vitro data, CQ had a greater suppressive effect on bone marrow than AQ in our patients. we hypothesize that CQ promotes B19V replication and contributes indirectly to severe anemia. but the present results provide already a strong evidence for this hypothesis. all parvoviruses studied to date also depend on endosomal acidification. the mechanism underlying the stabilization of B19V by CQ or AQ is likely to extend beyond pH-neutralizing activity. in this way, CQ would facilitate the endosomal escape of B19V before it reaches the degradative lysosomal compartment. this is of particular importance since nuclear targeting has been identified as a major limiting factor in parvovirus infections [22], [25]. other drugs tested, including primaquine and mefloquine, did not influence B19V infection in vitro. some other viral infections (SFV, EMCV and EBV) are enhanced by CQ but not by other 4-aminoquinoline antimalarial drugs. a non-4-aminoquinoline drug should be preferred to partner the artemisinin derivative so that the contribution of B19V to severe anemia is minimized."}
