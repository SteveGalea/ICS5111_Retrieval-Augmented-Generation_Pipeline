{"summary": "since 2012, more than 2400 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have been identified. the vast majority of MERS-CoV cases have occurred in Saudi Arabia. most remarkable travel-associated case of MERS-CoV occurred in 2015 in south Korea. diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease, underlying respiratory disease, and hypertension have all been shown to predispose a patient to more severe or lethal disease after MERS-CoV infection (16\u201320), and having more than 1 comorbid illness further increases the risk for severe disease (17). asymptomatic individuals were less likely to have an underlying comorbidity compared with those with fatal cases (21). both T1D and T2D result in hyperglycemia, but the mechanism by which this occurs is different. T2D is the most prevalent form of diabetes, constituting more than 85%\u201395% of all diabetes cases (25). etiology of T2D is closely intertwined with obesity and results from chronic inflammation induced by excess adipose tissue. mice were replaced with the human DPP4 sequence (DPP4H/M) (34) these mice express human DPP4 in the appropriate cell types, including nonciliated epithelial cells and alveolar type 2 cells. mice lose weight; exhibit clinical signs of illness, including labored breathing and lethargy; and exhibit pulmonary histopathological characteristics similar to those observed in humans. diabetes is a significant risk factor for the development of severe or lethal disease following MERS-CoV infection in humans (16\u201320, 22) male DPP4H/M mice develop diet-induced T2D and exhibit prolonged severe disease following MERS-CoV infection. male and female mice were fed either a normal diet or an HFD for 12 to 17 weeks. male and female mice maintained on an HFD for 12 to 17 weeks. males fed an HFD gained significantly more weight than HFD females. a healthy mouse can control blood glucose levels within 2 hours of glucose administration. a healthy mouse can control blood glucose levels within 2 hours. a healthy mouse can control blood glucose levels within 2 hours of glucose administration. male DPP4H/M mice developed type 2 diabetes on an HFD. the mice were split into age- and sex-matched cohorts at 4 to 6 weeks of age. they were maintained on either a high-fat chow (diabetic) or normal chow (control) diet. ic mice were slower to add on weight (Figure 2A, P = 0.0439) diabetic mice continued to lose weight for a longer period than control mice. the clinical course of disease was more similar between female HFD and control mice with less of a difference in the extent of weight lost. lost were measured daily in (A and C) male and (B and D) female mice. clinical scores were determined on following scale: 0 = healthy; 1 = slight ruffling of the fur, altered hind limb posture; 2 = mildly labored breathing, no lethargy; 3 = moderately labored breathing, severe lethargy; and 5 = dead. mRNA in lungs of diabetic and control male (Figure 3, C and E) or HFD and control female mice (Figure 3, D and F) together these data suggest that virus replication and clearance are not affected by diabetes or HFD. data are from n = 4\u201311 mice/group and are presented as the mean SEM. it is not clear how common extrapulmonary dissemination and replication of MERS-CoV are in humans because of the minimal amounts of virology data from patients with MERS. no differences in genomic virus RNA or virus mRNA were observed in any of the extrapulmonary tissues or blood isolated from diabetic male and control mice or HFD and control female mice. inflammation in the lungs of diabetic male mice is delayed but prolonged following MERS-CoV infection. weight loss and the appearance of clinical signs of disease are typically associated with lung pathology. inflammation in female HFD mice was similar to that observed in control mice. edema was evident by 7 days following infection, increased through 10 to 14 days after infection. no differences were observed between diabetic and control male mice or HFD and control female mice. n = 5\u201311 mice/group from 2 to 3 independent experiments. data are pooled from 2 to 3 independent experiments with n = 5\u201311 mice/group. the number of B cells found in the lungs of control mice was consistently, though not significantly, higher during infection. male diabetic mice had fewer CD4+ T cells at days 4 and 7 after infection compared with control male mice. male diabetic mice had significantly fewer IMMs in the lungs 7 days after infection compared with control male mice. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on the cells isolated from the lung. the data are pooled from 2 independent experiments with n = 3\u20139 mice/group. male diabetic and control mice were infected intranasally with 1.5e5 PFU of MERS-CoV. male diabetic and control mice were infected intranasally with 1.5e5 PFU of MERS-CoV. Ifng, Il4, Il17a, and the transcription factor Foxp3 were found to be indicative of CD4+ T cell function. skewing is important during SARS-CoV pathogenesis (43) male mice had reduced upregulation of Tnfa at 2 (P = 0.0145) and 7 (P = 0.0041) days after infection. however, nos2 expression was upregulated similarly in the lungs of male diabetic and control mice during MERS-CoV infection. male and female mice were fed either a normal diet or an HFD for 12 to 17 weeks. males fed an HFD gained significantly more weight than males fed an HFD. males fed an HFD gained significantly more weight than females. a healthy mouse can control blood glucose levels within 2 hours of glucose administration. a healthy mouse can control blood glucose levels within 2 hours. a healthy mouse can control blood glucose levels within 2 hours of glucose administration. male DPP4H/M mice developed type 2 diabetes on an HFD. the mice were split into age- and sex-matched cohorts at 4 to 6 weeks of age. the weight, (B) fasted blood glucose concentration, and (C) fasted serum insulin concentrations were determined. diabetic mice continued to lose weight for a longer period than control mice and lost significantly more net mass following infection. the clinical course of disease was more similar between female HFD and control mice with less of a difference in the extent of weight lost. weight loss and (C and D) amount of weight lost were measured daily in (A and C) male and (B and D) female mice. clinical scores were determined on following scale: 0 = healthy; 1 = slight ruffling of the fur, altered hind limb posture; 2 = mildly labored breathing, no lethargy; 3 = moderately labored breathing, severe lethargy; and 5 = dead. in the amount of genomic virus RNA or virus mRNA in the lungs of diabetic and control male (Figure 3, C and E) or HFD and control female mice (Figure 3, D and F) together these data suggest that virus replication and clearance are not affected by diabetes or HFD. data were normalized to TfRC and then normalized to PBS controls. it is not clear how common extrapulmonary dissemination and replication of MERS-CoV are in humans because of the minimal amounts of virology data from patients with MERS-CoV. no differences in genomic virus RNA or virus mRNA were observed in any of the extrapulmonary tissues or blood isolated from diabetic male and control mice or HFD and control female mice. inflammation in the lungs of diabetic male mice is delayed but prolonged following MERS-CoV infection. weight loss and the appearance of clinical signs of disease are typically associated with lung pathology. pathology and inflammation compared with control male mice. inflammation in female HFD mice was similar to that in control mice. no differences were observed between diabetic and control male mice or HFD and control female mice. data pooled from 2 to 3 independent experiments with n = 5\u201311 mice/group. total lung inflammation, (C) bronchiolar inflammation, and (D) perivascular inflammation scored by a board-certified veterinarian. the number of B cells found in the lungs of control mice was consistently, though not significantly, higher during infection. male diabetic mice had fewer CD4+ T cells at days 4 and 7 after infection compared with control male mice. male diabetic mice had significantly fewer IMMs in the lungs 7 days after infection compared with control male mice. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on the cells isolated from the lung. the numbers of (A) CD45+ cells, (B) inflammatory monocyte/macrophages, (C) CD3+ T cells, (D) CD4+ T cells, (F) B cells, (G) NK cells, and (H) neutrophils were determined. male diabetic and control mice were infected intranasally with 1.5e5 PFU of MERS-CoV. male diabetic and control mice were infected intranasally with 1.5e5 PFU of MERS-CoV. Ifng, Il4, Il17a, and the transcription factor Foxp3 were evaluated. cytokines showed little expression of Il4 during MERS-CoV. skewing may also be important during SARS-CoV pathogenesis. s2 as well as the antiinflammatory M2-related genes Il10 and Arg1 reduced upregulation of Tnfa at 2 (P = 0.0145) and 7 (P = 0.0041) days after infection. however, nos2 expression was upregulated similarly in the lungs of male diabetic and control mice during MERS-CoV infection. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the IMM response and, to a lesser extent, the CD4+ T cell response were altered in diabetic mice following MERS-CoV infection. we needed to use mice that are transgenic for human DPP4 for productive infection. the species cross-reactivity of gliptins and other drugs used to treat T2D, including metformin and sulfonylureas, will allow us to study the effects of anti-T2D drugs on MERS-CoV pathogenesis. the metabolic syndrome associated with T1D and is susceptible to MERS-CoV infection to determine the contribution of hyperglycemia in the absence of obesity. male C57BL/6 mice are more susceptible than females to diet-induced obesity and the subsequent development of metabolic disease. male C57BL/6 mice are more susceptible than females to diet-induced obesity and the subsequent development of metabolic disease. increased infection with viral and bacterial pathogens has been characterized in diabetic humans and animal models. infection of M. tuberculosis and B. pseudomallei has been previously shown to lead to reduced ability to control bacterial replication. alterations in the CD4+ T cell response to MERS-CoV infection in diabetic mice were not clear. a higher frequency of these cells produced IFN, IL-2, and IL-17F. the magnitude of infiltrating CD4+ T cells was reduced during the first 7 days following MERS-CoV infection in diabetic mice. an increase in antigen-specific Th1 cells and both non\u2013antigen-specific and antigen-specific Th17 cells were observed. increased serum levels of Th1 and Th17 cytokines were observed. increased IL-17 expression in diabetic mice may also be coming from other cellular sources. macrophages from diabetic mice or humans have been shown to have reduced phagocytic function and expression of TNF-, IL-6, CCL2 and IL-12 (65\u201367) diabetic mice did not upregulate Arg1 as efficiently as control mice, suggesting a defect in initiating this regulatory response. the current model to study diabetes and MERS-CoV infection provides the opportunity to investigate a wide variety of questions, such as the contribution of age to disease severity in diabetic mice. the model is a stepping-stone in understanding how diabetes affects MERS-CoV pathogenesis. mice with wild-type C57BL/6 mice were put on a diet of normal chow. mice were weighed and tested for elevated blood glucose levels and glucose intolerance. mice were fasted overnight (16 hours) and weighed. mice were intranasally inoculated with 50 L of PBS, 1.5 104 PFU or 1.5 105 PFU of MERS-CoV Jordan diluted in PBS for a total inoculation volume of 50 L. only mice found dead in the cage were scored a 5. titers in PFU per milliliter were determined by plaque assay on vero E6 cells. titers in PFU per milliliter were converted to PFU per gram of lung. RNA was extracted using the DIRECT-zol RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research) uninfected or MERS-CoV\u2013infected mice were euthanized with isoflurane. lungs were excised and placed in cold PBS. single cells were isolated from lungs using gentleMACS system. total live cells were counted using trypan blue exclusion. 1 106 cells were plated and washed twice with PBS containing 2 mM EDTA. cells were stained for viability using the Live/Dead Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Molecular Probes) cytometer (Beckton Dickinson) and data were analyzed using FlowJo analysis software (FlowJo, LLC) histology. Formalin-fixed lungs were embedded in paraffin, and 5-m sections were cut followed by staining with hematoxylin and eosin. slides were blinded and were scored by a board-certified veterinary pathologist. mice were bred and maintained at the University of Maryland School of Medicine by crossing hDPP4-homozygote (DPP4H/M) mice with wild-type C57BL/6 mice (DPP4M/M) at 4 to 6 weeks of age, hDPP4 mice were put on a diet of normal chow (22% kcal from fat; Teklad, 2019S) or a diet consisting of high-fat chow (60% kcal from normal-chow and high-fat\u2013chow mice were fasted overnight (16 hours) and weighed. baseline fasted glucose levels were measured using Contour glucose test strips and glucose meter (Bayer) mice were infected approximately 1\u20132 weeks following diabetes testing. tissue collection was performed on infected mice at days 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 21 after infection. lungs were homogenized in 1 mL of PBS for RNA extraction or PBS for virus quantification. fast 1-step PCR mix (Life Technologies) was used along with primer and probe sets targeting upE for viral genomic RNA, the leader sequence and M for viral mRNA, and the mouse TfRC. RNA was extracted using the DIRECT-zol Mini RNA Extraction kit (Zymo Research) per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. uninfected or MERS-CoV\u2013infected mice were euthanized with isoflurane. lungs were excised and placed in cold PBS. single cells were isolated from lungs using gentleMACS system. cells were stained with antibody cocktails made in PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA. cells were stained with antibody cocktails made in PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA. slides were blinded and were scored by a board-certified veterinary pathologist. the scoring scale used was as follows: 0 = no inflammation; 1 = scant inflammation (5% multifocal or 1 small focus); 2 = mild inflammation, 25% parenchyma; 3 = moderate inflammation, 25%\u201350% parenchyma; 4 = marked inflammation, 50%\u201375% parenchyma; and 5 = severe inflammation, >75% parenchyma. version 1. 09/24/2019 In-Press Preview Version 2. 10/17/2019 Electronic publication."}
