{"summary": "commercial molecular assays detect and identify multiple pathogens associated with clinical syndromes. these tests are revolutionary, enabling health care providers to rapidly diagnose certain infections. these technologies have also introduced challenges. multiplex tests are often expensive, requiring the development of utilization management strategies to guide their appropriate use. there has been an increase in hospitalizations for severe sepsis over the past decade. there has been an increase in the number of hospitalizations for severe sepsis over the past decade. delays in the administration of effective antimicrobial therapy are associated with increased mortality rates. -TOF MS for the identification of bacterial isolates from positive blood cultures after short-term incubation has been adopted by many laboratories, including our own (7\u20139). this method has excellent performance, enabling the identification of organisms in 92% (45/49) of blood culture bottles positive for Gram-negative bacilli following a 4-h incubation. this is the first FDA-approved/cleared assay to provide rapid (within 7 h) phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing directly from positive blood cultures. this system extrapolates MIC values by analyzing bacterial growth in presence of specific antibiotic concentrations. species Enterobacter cloacae complex Citrobacter species Yeasts Candida albicans Candida glabrata Candida krusei Candida parapsilosis Candida tropicalis Ability to detect presence of resistance gene mecA vanA vanB blaKPC blaOXA blaIMP blaCTX-M Time to result (h) 1 2.5 2 The BCID test is a closed, multiplex PCR system that offers automated sample preparation, amplification, detection, and the test has a hands-on time of 5 min and a run time of 2.5 h. the verigene and BCID tests provided correct identification for 90.6 and 87.2% of samples, respectively, compared to conventional methods. the BCID panel detected mecA in 4 staphylococcal isolates (n = 3 for Staphylococcus aureus and n = 1 for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species [CoNS]) the presence of an altered staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec element was thought to account for the discrepant mecA results. these studies show a decrease in the time to organism identification and generally show a decrease in the time to optimization of antimicrobial therapy. however, there have been inconclusive results in terms of these panels' impacts on mortality rates and lengths of hospitalization. analysis of the data is complicated by suboptimal study design in many cases. no difference in mortality rate, ICU LOS, cost, or 30 day-readmission rate Audit and feedback by ASP performed Monday to Friday during daytime. no templated comments in report 22 BioFire BCID single-center, pre/postintervention study of 336 subjects Decreased TAT. shorter duration of empirical vancomycin use in patients with contaminated blood cultures and MSSA bacteremia, earlier effective therapy for VRE bacteremia, and shorter LOS. study included treatment guidance comments 19 Verigene BC-GN single-center, retrospective, pre/postintervention study involving 195 subjects Decreased TAT, ICU LOS, 30-day mortality rate, mortality rate associated with MDR pathogens. pre/postintervention study evaluated the impact of the Verigene BC-GP assay on a cohort of 74 patients with enterococcal bacteremia. authors observed reductions in hospital length of stay by 21.7 days (P = 0.04) and mean hospital costs by $60,729 (P = 0.02) compared to those in the study period before the implementation of the multiplex assay (16). negative bacteremia in 195 hospitalized patients over a 6-month period before and after the implementation of Verigene BC-GN test. the length of intensive care unit stay, 30-day mortality rates, and mortality rates associated with multidrug-resistant pathogens were lower. a total of 617 patients were randomized to one of three arms, a standard processing or control arm, which included organism identification using MALDI-TOF MS performed on isolated colonies (n = 207); BCID results reported with templated comments and real-time audit with feedback by an antimicrobial stewardship team (n = 212). the time to blood culture clearance among these groups was shortest for the BCID group with antimicrobial stewardship intervention (14). the implementation of rapid blood culture bottle diagnostics such as MALDI-TOF MS, peptide nucleic acid FISH, or microarray technologies was associated with a lower mortality rate (odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 0.8) the BCID panel identified organisms from blood culture bottles before positivity using simulated BacT/Alert FA Plus BC bottles spiked with five isolates each of Escherichia coli and S. aureus. 9/10 were detected 5 h and 1 was detected 7.5 h after incubation in the blood culture system (26) the panels do not cover all causes of bloodstream infection and may not be capable of identifying all pathogens in mixed infections. a narrow spectrum of genes associated with drug resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is included in these panels. sensitivity of blood culture-based diagnostics is decreased when antimicrobial therapy is initiated prior to culture. sensitivity of blood culture-based diagnostics is decreased when antimicrobial therapy is initiated prior to culture. the T2Candida panel (T2 Biosystems) is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the direct detection of Candida species from whole-blood specimens. this test runs on an automated platform (T2Dx) and uses PCR and T2 magnetic resonance for the multiplex detection of five Candida species. sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 91.1 and 99.4%, respectively. the Accelerate Pheno system (Accelerate Diagnostics) is a newer, completely automated system that uses gel electrofiltration and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the identification of a limited number of bacteria and yeast within 90 min directly from positive blood cultures. this is the first FDA-approved/cleared assay to provide rapid (within 7 h) phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing directly from positive blood cultures. ococcus faecium Listeria species Listeria monocytogenes Gram-negative bacteria Klebsiella oxytoca Klebsiella pneumoniae Serratia marcescens Proteus species Acinetobacter species Acinetobacter baumannii Haemophilus influenzae Neisseria meningitis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Enterobacter cloacae complex Citrobacter species Yeasts the verigene processor SP provides automated sample preparation and detection of bacterial DNA in a microarray format by using gold nanoparticle probe-based technology. the verigene reader generates results based on light scatter analysis from microarray spots. a single verigene reader can control up to 32 Processor SP units, allowing scalable workflow. a study by Bhatti et al. assessed the performance of the BCID and Verigene assays in comparison to conventional, culture-based methods. 95% and 99% of identifiable isolates in monomicrobial cultures were correctly identified by the BCID and Verigene assays. the BCID panel detected mecA in 4 staphylococcal isolates. occus faecalis and 1 isolate each of Escherichia coli and alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus species were not part of the panel. the majority of organisms that were not identified were not part of the panel. the BCID panel could not accurately assess the methicillin susceptibility of S. aureus in a polymicrobial sample containing CoNS. study design Outcomes of rapid test compared to standard methods Antimicrobial stewardship intervention(s) Reference BioFire BCID single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled trial of 617 subjects Decreased TAT; decreased time to deescalation of antibiotics in BCID group with ASP intervention; treatment guidance comments included in microbiology result report 14b BioFire BCID single-center pre/postintervention study of 364 subjects Decreased TAT; shorter time to effective therapy; no no difference in mortality rates or LOS Audit and feedback by ASP daily 20b Verigene BC-GP single-center, retrospective, pre/postintervention study involving 235 hospitalized subjects Decreased TAT, 30-day mortality rate, cost, and time to optimization of antimicrobial therapy ID physicians reviewed and gave recommendations for all positive blood cultures on weekdays. in a multicenter, pre/postintervention study involving 167 hospitalized patients with bacteremia, the use of the Verigene BC-GP assay was associated with decreased durations of unnecessary antibiotic treatment, median lengths of stay, and hospitalization costs compared to conventional identification using the BD Phoenix system. however, the overall mortality rates were similar between the groups. beal et al. reported increased deescalation of empirical antibiotics and a reduction in the time to optimal antibiotics for patients with methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia. in a retrospective analysis of Gram-negative bacteremia in 195 hospitalized patients over a 6-month period before and after the implementation of verigene BC-GN test, the length of intensive care unit stay, 30-day mortality rates, and mortality the BCID group had a shorter time to effective therapy (5 h; P 0.001) than the control group (15 h) or the antimicrobial stewardship group (13 h) there was no difference with respect to the mortality rate, 30-day readmission rate, intensive care unit length of stay, or cost of care (22) a total of 617 patients were randomized to one of three arms, a standard processing or control arm, which included organism identification using MALDI-TOF MS performed on isolated colonies (n = 207); BCID results reported with templated comments (n = 198); or BCID results reported with templated comments and real-time audit with feedback by an antimicrobial stewardship team. the results of these assays should be reported to providers as quickly and directly as possible. they should also be communicated to an expert in antimicrobial stewardship who can work with the providers to optimize therapy (10) a feature of these assays that may be helpful in the future is that it is theoretically possible to identify organisms and detect antibiotic resistance genes in blood culture bottles. the BCID panel detected organisms that were not visualized upon Gram staining or recovered in culture in 1.7% of positive BD Bactec blood culture bottles (Becton Dickinson) the presence of nucleic acid from nonviable organisms in blood culture bottles could potentially explain this finding. the T2Candida panel (T2 Biosystems) is an in vitro diagnostic assay for the direct detection of Candida species from whole-blood specimens. this test runs on an automated platform (T2Dx) and uses PCR and T2 magnetic resonance for the multiplex detection of five Candida species directly from a whole-blood specimen. predictive value of this assay was 99.4% in a population with a 6% prevalence of Candida infection. other methods, such as 16S and 18S rRNA gene PCR/sequencing and metagenomic shotgun sequencing, are being developed and evaluated.

TAG RVP Fast reported overall sensitivities and specificities for each panel of 84.5 and 100% for FA-RP, 98.3 and 99.2% for eSensor RVP, 92.7 and 99.2% for eSensor RVP, and 84.4 and 99.9% for Luminex xTAG RVPv1. the greatest discrepancies between the multiplex panels and the reference standard was for adenovirus (for which the FA-RP had compared the performance of the ePlex RPP to those of laboratory-developed RT-PCR assays. 10 out the 12 RT-PCR positive/ePlex RPP negative discordant targets were confirmed by a third assay to be human bocavirus (n = 3), rhinovirus (n = 2), human coronavirus (n = 3), parainfluenza virus 2 (n = 1), and human metapneumovirus (37). the preintervention group (n = 2,349 patients) was tested by enzyme immunoassays, direct fluorescent-antigen tests, PCR assays and/or viral cultures. the postintervention group (n = 2,430) was tested by using the FA-RP. 44 percent of patients in the postintervention group had a positive result. patients assigned to the POCT group (n = 362) were tested by using the FA-RP. patients in the control group (n = 358) were tested for respiratory viruses by laboratory PCR assays. more patients in the POCT group received single doses or brief courses (48 h) of antibiotics than in the control group (17% versus 9%; P = 0.004) pathogen panel (Luminex, Austin, TX) offers flexible configurations for customized testing (34, 44) the verigene RP Flex panel also allows the unmasking of suppressed results without running an additional test, at an extra cost. multiplex respiratory panels are likely to allow the epidemiology of certain pathogens to be better defined. the use of these assays may be associated with a sense of \u201cfulfillment and closure\u201d for treating clinicians and their patients by providing a microbiological diagnosis. Luminex xTAG RVP v1 and xTAG RVP Fast detect 12 and 8 targets, respectively, and have turnaround times of 8 and 6 h. the FA-RP includes the most targets (n = 20) and has the fastest turnaround time (1 h) the eSensor RVP assay is performed on the eSensor XT-8 system. it uses microarray hybridization and solid-phase electrochemical detection to detect 14 targets within 8 h. the FA-RP can simultaneously detect 20 targets and has a turnaround time of 1 h. eSensor RVP, xTAG RVPv1 and xTAG RVP Fast compared the performance of four assays using 300 specimens. sensitivity and specificity were calculated by using the criterion \"positive by at least two platforms\" the greatest discrepancies between the multiplex panels and the reference standard was for adenovirus and influenza B virus. the NxTAG-RPP has a higher sample throughput than that of the FA-RP (96 samples versus 1 sample per run) and a turnaround time of 5 h (for up to 96 samples, which may be misleading, as the assay is often batched) versus 1 h (for 1 sample) for the FA-RP assay (36). the preintervention group (n = 2,349 patients) was tested by enzyme immunoassays, direct fluorescent-antigen tests, PCR assays, and/or viral cultures. the postintervention group (n = 2,430) was tested by using the FA-RP. forty-two percent of patients in the postintervention group had a positive result. patients assigned to the POCT group (n = 362) were tested by using the FA-RP. patients in the control group (n = 358) were tested for respiratory viruses by laboratory PCR assays. more patients in the POCT group received single doses or brief courses (48 h) of antibiotics than in the control group (17% versus 9%; P = 0.004) the verigene RP Flex panel (Nanosphere) and the Luminex xTAG respiratory pathogen panel (Luminex, Austin, TX) offer flexible configurations for customized testing. multiplex tests may have a lower sensitivity for the detection of certain pathogens. multiplex respiratory assays may have clinical benefits, including potentials to deescalate antibiotics if a viral pathogen(s) is detected. an EV D68 outbreak in 2014 was rapidly detected because of the use of multiplex respiratory panels (46) multiplex respiratory panels may allow the epidemiology of certain pathogens to be better defined. the world Gastroenterology Organization estimates that there are 2 billion new cases each year, leading to 1.9 million deaths among children under the age of 5 years (49). a thousand deaths in children under the age of 5 years are recorded annually in the united states (50\u201352). the use of multiplex GI panels requires ordering clinicians to select the pathogens that are most likely to be associated with the disease. however, this approach can become expensive if a large number of individual assays are ordered. Enterotoxigenic E. coli Enteroaggregative E. coli Plesiomonas shigelloides Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (stx1-stx2) c Clostridium difficile (toxin A/B) Viruses Norovirus GI/GII Rotavirus A Astrovirus Adenovirus 40/41 Sapovirus Parasites Cryptosporidium species Entamoeba histolytica Gi the bioFire GIP is an automated, pouch-based assay that can identify 22 targets. the sample input for the GIP is 200 l of stool preserved in Cary-Blair medium. results are available in 1 h. an additional 22% of their specimens were positive for at least one target. the Luminex GPP had a higher sensitivity than conventional methods for C. difficile, Campylobacter species, norovirus, and rotavirus. a study in the Netherlands assessed asymptomatic children (n = 5,197) in day care centers for enteric pathogens found 19.9% were positive for EPEC. other studies involving symptomatic patients have found high rates of coinfections involving organisms other than EAEC or EPEC. the bioFire GIP demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% for Campylobacter species, Shigella species, stx1-stx2 and rotavirus. lower sensitivities were observed for norovirus and rotavirus. the specificity of the BioFire GIP was 100% for all the tested targets except norovirus and rotavirus. the Verigene assay showed sensitivities of 95.4% for Shigella species, 91.7% for stx1-stx2 and 89.0% for norovirus. the overall specificity of the BioFire GIP was 97% (58) Goldenberg et al. conducted a parallel diagnostic study on hospitalized patients (n = 800) to compare the costs of conventional enteric pathogen testing and the Luminex GPP assay. laboratory costs and costs associated with patient isolation were measured or estimated for each patient. multiplex GI panels offer several benefits over conventional methods. they allow results to be reported within hours of sample collection. multiplex panels accept stool in Cary-Blair medium, transport of specimens is easy. the Luminex GPP and the Verigene EP allow users to customize which targets are reported. masked results cannot be unmasked at a later time and reported to patients. conventional methods are still needed to detect pathogens that are not covered by the panels. gastrointestinal panel (BioFire GIP; BioFire Diagnostics, LLC) received FDA approval/clearance in 2014. gastrointestinal panel (BioFire GIP; BioFire Diagnostics, LLC) and verigene EP (Verigene EP) test (Luminex Corporation) received FDA approval/clearance in 2014. anensis No. of samples (throughput) 1\u201332 (scalable) 24 1\u201312 (scalable) Time to result (h) 2 5 1 a EP, enteric pathogens; GPP, gastrointestinal pathogen panel; GIP, gastrointestinal panel. the Luminex GPP detects 14 gastrointestinal pathogens. the bioFire GIP and Luminex GPP assays have positive rates of 33 and 30%, respectively, compared to only 8% with routine testing (58, 59) a multicenter study involving 709 samples across 10 european countries reported that the BioFire GIP detected at least one organism in 54% of samples. the most commonly detected organisms have been C. difficile, enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), salmonella species, norovirus, rotavirus, sapovirus, and Cryptosporidium species (56, 59\u201362). a consistent observation of studies evaluating multiplex GI panels is that detection of 2 targets occurs more frequently than with conventional testing. asymptomatic individuals can be colonized with C. difficile, making it difficult to interpret the finding of a positive result for C. difficile in a patient in whom this organism may not have been historically looked for. only one study has directly compared the three commercially available multiplex GI platforms to conventional testing (65) the specificity of the BioFire GIP was 100% for all the tested targets except norovirus and rotavirus. Sensitivities for the Luminex GPP were 99.3% and 98.6% respectively. the Verigene EP demonstrated good specificities for all six of the tested targets. clinical stool samples (n = 100) were tested by a laboratory-developed norovirus RT-PCR assay. results were compared with those of the BioFire GIP norovirus assay. the results suggest commercially available, multiplex GI panels offer overall high sensitivity and specificity. study found 21 (13.3%) were positive for an organism by the multiplex GI panel that was not identified by conventional methods. 25 (16%) patients were placed under contact precautions unnecessarily for a total of 181 days (61) multiplex GI testing may be useful (71) the Luminex GPP targets 14 pathogens and can run 24 samples in 5 h. the assay requires some hands-on preprocessing time (45 min) the verigene EP is also designed as a closed, sample-to-answer system that can identify 9 pathogens in 2 h. acute diarrheal infections in adults indicate that antibiotic susceptibility testing is typically not recommended because empirical treatment failure is uncommon. clinical laboratories utilizing multiplex GI panels may consider culturing for the organism(s) detected molecularly (i.e., reflexive culture) (72), a strategy that can also be adopted when public health laboratories need isolates (95) in cases of fungal, viral, and tuberculous meningitis, WBC counts may also be elevated but generally to a lesser degree than with bacterial meningitis. a detailed patient evaluation, including vaccination history, may aid in narrowing the differential diagnoses. microbiologic testing of CSF is generally required to establish a definitive diagnosis. in 2015, the filmArray Meningitis/Encephalitis panel (MEP) received FDA approval/clearance, offering the first rapid, multiplex assay for the diagnosis of CNS infection. this PCR-based panel queries a total of 14 targets (Table 6). EP detected at least one pathogen in 136 (8.7%) samples. the highest positivity rate was 12% (105/863) among pediatric patients. the MEP was positive in 4.4% (31/697) of patients >18 years old. at least one false-positive result was identified among 10 of the panel targets (75) the authors reported an overall positive agreement rate of 84.4% and a negative agreement rate of >99.9% between the MEP and conventional testing. the MEP identified one additional sample as being positive for EV that was negative by the Cepheid Xpert EV assay. discrepancy analysis confirmed that the sample was positive for EV (78) a diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis may be made by culture (5 to 14 days), cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) testing, or India ink staining. the study included HIV-infected adults (n = 69) with suspected meningitis/meningoencephalitis. bacterial meningitis caused by these organisms is now rare in the united states due to the success of immunization programs. bacterial meningitis caused by these organisms is now rare in the united states due to the success of immunization programs. several studies have reported positive results by the MEP not confirmed by conventional methods. authors suggested this may have been due to amplified DNA contamination or S. pneumoniae colonization of health care workers or laboratory staff handling samples. the CrAg test is quick, inexpensive, and sensitive, making it challenging to replace. there is a dearth of reported information as to its clinical utility. research evaluating its effect on patient outcomes, including length of hospital stay, morbidity, and mortality. the majority of samples were obtained from patients who were hospitalized or presented to an emergency department. the MEP detected at least one pathogen in 136 (8.7%) samples. the highest positivity rate was 12% (105/863) among pediatric patients. results falsely positive for S. pneumoniae may lead to overuse of inappropriate antibiotics. at least one false-positive result was identified among 10 of the panel targets. results were compared to those of conventional testing. twenty children were found to have EV present in respiratory and/or fecal samples. a laboratory-developed PCR assay detected EV (n = 38), HPeV (n = 16), HSV-1 (n = 4), and HHV-6 (n = 77). a recent study at the Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania evaluated the MEP for pediatric patients. testing by the MEP correlated with the results of routine methods for 129/133 CSF specimens containing viral targets. discordant results were observed for 4 samples. a diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis may be made by culture (5 to 14 days), cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) testing, or India ink staining. the MEP showed 100% sensitivity (18/18) and specificity (24/24) compared with culture methods. patients on cryptococcal treatment were monitored for conversion to culture negativity. the cultures collected to monitor when patients became culture negative were also tested by using the MEP. positive panel results for a viral CNS infection may help clinicians quickly discontinue unnecessary antibiotics. rapid HSV results can help clinicians expedite the start or stop of acyclovir treatment. the specificity of multiplex panels is especially important. CSF Gram staining, glucose level determinations, and protein level determinations will continue to be part of the routine diagnostic algorithm. the CrAg test is quick, inexpensive, and sensitive, making it challenging to replace. the filmArray BCID panel was used to identify Streptococcus pyogenes from synovial fluid in a child with septic arthritis and to identify S. pneumoniae from pleural fluid in another child with complicated pneumonia with empyema. the sensitivity and specificity of the BCID panel were 71 and 97%, respectively. the BCID panel accurately identified 100% of organisms in monomicrobial infections and 75% (18/24) of targets if multiple organisms were recovered by routine culture. the panel is not FDA approved for direct testing of clinical specimens or of specimens other than blood in positive blood culture bottles. failure to detect the causative agent due to reliance on insensitive methods can lead to delays in starting appropriate treatment and preventing the further spread of disease in the community. syndromic panel-based tests for additional syndromes will become less expensive."}
