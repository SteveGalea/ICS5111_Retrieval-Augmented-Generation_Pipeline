{"summary": "feline caliciviruses (FCV) are members of the Caliciviridae family (genus Vesivirus) and a major pathogen of cats worldwide. the virus has been associated with vesicular and upper respiratory tract disease, especially in multi-cat environments, such as shelters, colonies, and catteries. the phylogenetic classification of FCV strains has demonstrated the circulation of a single genogroup (GI) around the globe. there are no specific antivirals available against FCV infections. current vaccines do not prevent infection, viral shedding, or the development of FCV-VSD, but can reduce or even prevent clinical symptoms. a single amino acid change (A539T) in the P2 domain of VP1 was able to confer resistance. a single amino acid change (A539T) in the P2 domain of VP1 was shown to be effective at blocking FCV entry using in vitro assays. PIs, and the broad-spectrum nitazoxanide, were tested for FCV antiviral activity using both in vitro enzyme and cell culture-based methods. 2.1. cells and FCV Crandell Rees Feline Kidney cells were propagated in Eagle\u2019s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM, ATCC 30-2003) sbuvir (MedChemExpress, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA), 7-Deaza-2-C-methyladenosine (7DMA; Carbosynth, Berkshite, United Kingdom), rupintrivir (In Vitro Technologies, Melbourne, VIC, Australia), GC376 (Focus Bioscience, Brisbane, QLD, Australia), and nitazoxanide (Sapphire Bioscience, Sydney, NSW, the equilibration buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 5% glycerol (v/v) and 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v) all buffers were prepared at pH 8. the protein concentration was determined using a BCA Protein assay kit. fluorescence was measured on a fluoStar Optima microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany) the half maximal cytotoxic concentrations were determined with GraphPad Prism v.7. aa sequence of the cleavage site between the precursor leader capsid and the mature capsid protein (VP1) of the FCV genome was synthesized as a fluorogenic substrate peptide. a stock solution (10 mM) was prepared in 100% DMSO. IC50 and Km values were determined using GraphPad Prism v.7. 2.7. inhibition of FCV Plaque Formation in cell culture plaque reduction assays were performed as previously described. 105 cells/well were infected with FCV at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.0005 for 1 h. media was replaced with media containing drug and incubated for a further 24 h. an 83 bp amplicon of the ORF1 region was generated using a serially diluted plasmid. cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. the FCV strain was purchased from ATCC. pVRL345-transformed Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) were grown in Luria-Bertani media (2 L) at 37 \u00b0C with 100 g/mL kanamycin until the OD600 was 0.6. the equilibration buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 5% glycerol (v/v) and the purified protein was concentrated using an Amicon\u00ae Ultra centrifugal filter. the protein was dialyzed against three buffers with decreasing NaCl concentration. the protein concentration was determined using a BCA Protein assay kit. dsRNA was measured using the fluorescent dye PicoGreen (Life Technologies) dsRNA was used as the negative control. dsRNA was used as the negative control. protease assays were performed in 384-well plates using a reaction volume of 50 L containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 6 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA, 50% glycerol (v/v), 600 ng of FCV Pro-Pol and the fluorogenic substrate. the initial measurements to determine the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) of the substrate were performed using increasing concentrations (0\u2013100 M) with in the percentage of inhibition of FCV infection was assessed over a dose-response matrix that included four concentrations of nitazoxanide and 2CMC (0 to 4 M) the effects of drug combination were assessed using SynergyFinder [38] and the zero-interaction potency model [39] was used to generate synergy scores from a dose-response matrix. the cycling parameters were 50 \u00b0C for 20 min, 95 \u00b0C for 5 min and 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 10 s and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min. all reactions were run in duplicate. recombinant FCV RdRp was used to generate dsRNA from a poly(C) RNA template using rGTP as a substrate. after 1 h of incubation at 30 \u00b0C, the reactions were stopped with 10 mM EDTA and dsRNA was quantified using the fluorescent dye PicoGreen.

The inhibitory activity of selected non-nucleoside inhibitors against recombinant FCV Pro-Pol exhibits a bifunctional activity of polymerase and protease in vitro. the protease activity was not inhibited with increasing NaCl concentrations. however, only GC376 exhibited an inhibitory effect against the protease. antiviral activity of the protease inhibitor GC376 against FCV was determined using a FRET assay. concentrations ranged between 0.1 and 125 M and FCV protease activity was compared to DMSO treatment. 2CMC showed CC50 values of >100 M, while nitazoxanide showed value of 12.7 M. nitazoxanide showed value of 12.7 M, and therapeutic index values were of >40 and 21.1 respectively. tazoxanide and 2CMC showed a synergistic antiviral effect against FCV. data were analyzed using an unpaired t-test. a decrease of dose-dependency in FCV RNA levels was observed after 24 h of treatment for both compounds. FCV Pro-Pol expression We successfully expressed the FCV Pro-Pol polyprotein containing a C-terminal 6-histidine tag in E. coli BL21 cells, under the control of the T7 promoter system. the presence of the His-tag was confirmed by Western blotting. yringae bacteriophage (6) RdRp was used as positive control. the baseline NaCl concentration of the reaction mixture before any additional NaCl was 3 mM.

GC376 is under development for feline coronavirus infection (feline infectious peritonitis) famciclovir is used for the treatment of feline herpesvirus (FHV)-associated clinical disease. no antiviral effect was observed for either PI against FCV protease."}
