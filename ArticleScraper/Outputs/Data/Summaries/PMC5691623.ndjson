{"summary": "globalization, environmental changes, population growth, and urbanization make viral diseases (VDs) one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the world [1,2]. emerging and re-emerging VDs pose a constant threat to public health. anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w) and pro-apoptotic (Bax, Bak, and Bad) Bcl-2 proteins may represent cellular targets for novel antivirals. commercially available Bcl-2 inhibitors (Bcl-2i) could be tested as antivirals. we also showed that ABT-263 induced apoptosis in cells transfected with viral RNA or plasmid DNA but not in mock-transfected cells. only ABT-737, ABT-263, A-1331852, and A-1155463 limited viral replication. we found a potential solution for the prevention and treatment of a broad-spectrum of VDs. viruses human influenza A/Udorn/307/1972 (H3N2) and B/Shandong/7/97 viruses were grown in embryonated hen eggs as described previously [25,26] EV1 and EV6 strains were propagated in a monolayer of african green monkey kidney (Vero) and adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells. VGM for RPE contained 0.2% BSA, 2 mM l-glutamine, 0.348% NaHCO3 and 1 g/mL l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin (TPCK)-trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMEM-F12. VGM containing cellTox Green Express cytotoxicity reagent (CTxG, 1:2000 dilution in the assay well, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) no compounds were added to the control wells. the cells were mock- or virus-infected. curves were fitted with four-parameter logistic functions (Equation 1). m is the dose that produces the half-maximal effect. m is the dose that produces the half-maximal effect, and is the steepness (slope) of the curve. IAV and FLUBV were titered using plaque assay on MDCK cells. EV1 and EV6 titers were also determined by plaque assay on A549 cells. SFV4 was titered by plaque assay on BHK-21 cells. DTEB contained 135 mM trehalose, 50 mM KCl, 20 M EDTA, 20 M EGTA, 0.1% BSA, 5 mM succinate, 10 mM HEPES-KOH, 0.005% digitonin, 10 g/mL Oligomycin A, 5 g/mL Oligomycin A, 5 M -mercaptoethanol, 1 M JC-1 fluorescent probe (all from Sigma) sample analysis was performed on an Acquity UPLC-MS/MS system. a Xevo TQ-S tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was operated in both positive and negative polarities. electro spray ionization was chosen as the ionization mode. the heatmap was generated using the pheatmap package based on log transformed profiling data. berg false discovery rate (FDR) controlled at 10%. liophilized lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 mg/mL) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) Plasmid pEGFP was from Clontech (Mountain View, CA, USA) and ATP (10 mM solution; cat #: PV3227) were from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA) human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) F12 supplemented with 50 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin (PenStrep), 2mM L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.25% sodium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich) vero cells were grown in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1 Antibiotic-Antimycotic solution. the cells were grown for 24 h in appropriate cell growth medium. cells were mock- or virus-infected. using logistic regression analysis, with R2PRESS = 0.997 and R2PRESS = 0.995 for the dsDNA and ATP calibration curves. this allowed accurate estimation of unknown concentrations by finding intersects with known fluorescence and luminescence measurements on the calibration curve. titers were expressed as plaque-forming units (PFU), 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) or fluorescence-forming units (FFU)/mL. EV1 and EV6 titers were also determined by plaque assay on A549 cells. 104 cells were plated per well in 96-well plates. after 16 h, the cells were infected with IAV or transfected with pEGFP plasmid. analysis was performed on an Acquity UPLC-MS/MS system. electro spray ionization was chosen as the ionization mode with a capillary voltage at 0.6 kV in both polarities. metabolites were determined at a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) controlled at 10%. the heatmap was generated using the pheatmap package based on log transformed profiling data. peptides were in-gel digested with trypsin. BH3 peptide profiling revealed that Bad, Bim, Bid, Puma, and Noxa enhanced MoMP in IAV- but not in mock-infected human non-malignant RPE cells. a co-immunoprecipitation experiment using antibodies against pro-survival Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, or Mcl-1 followed by mass spectrometry showed that several cellular proteins, including Bad, Bax, Bak, UACA, increasing concentrations of ABT-263 kill IAV-infected (moi 3) but not mock-infected retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells at 24 h. cyanine dye stains the dsDNA of dead cells. the CTxG assay uses fluorescent asymmetric cyanine dye that stains the DNA of dead cells. CTG assay quantifies ATP, an indicator of metabolically active living cells. high values indicate that ABT-263 was an effective trigger of the premature death of infected cells. the treatment of pancreatic cancer cells infected with SFV with ABT-263 at low moi attenuated the replication and spread of the virus in these cells. this suggests that Bcl-2i might be used as broad-spectrum antivirals. we hypothesized that viral or other foreign RNA or DNA could trigger ABT-263-sensitized apoptosis. BH3 peptides of Puma, Bad and Bid induced MoMP in pDNA-transfected ABT-263-treated cells as early as 3 h post transfection. as expected, ABT-263 did not accelerate the death of RPE or A549 cells treated with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) ABT-263 did not show any effect on these cells (Figure S7). results confirm that intracellular foreign RNA/DNA or its replication intermediates triggered apoptosis, and Bcl-2i accelerate this process. fluorescent microscopy images show that increasing concentrations of Bcl-2i kill IAV-infected (moi 3) but not mock-infected RPE cells at 24 hpi. asymmetric cyanine dye stains the dsDNA of dead cells; (D) quantification of dsDNA in dead cells. ABT-263 treatment induced apoptosis during the early stages of a viral infection if the viral load was high or during the late stages of a viral infection if the initial concentration of viral nucleic acid was low. in both cases, ABT-263 treatment could prematurely terminate viral replication. structures of A-1155463 and its analogues bound to Bcl-xL may provide further ideas for the development of this compound as an antiviral. binding of A-1155463, A-1331852, and WEHI-539 to their targets induces major conformational change (7 backbone movement) in the Bcl-xL that disrupts the local (R103-D107) helical structure of the protein. the viral dose is likely to be high, infecting a large number of cells. therefore, A-1155463 or its derivatives must be evaluated as prophylactic rather than therapeutic agents against viruses that cause acute infections."}
