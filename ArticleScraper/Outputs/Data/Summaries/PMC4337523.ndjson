{"summary": "ICTV has revised the nomenclature and taxonomy to reclassify the three CoV groups into three genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus (3). novel CoVs, which represent a novel genus, Deltacoronavirus, have also been identified (4\u20136) ine CoV HKU15 has been identified in pigs, suggesting bird-to-mammal transmission. a model for CoV evolution was proposed, where bat CoVs are likely the gene source of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus and avian CoVs are the gene source of Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus. however, no human CoV has yet been identified from Betacoronavirus lineage D. HCoV OC43 is likely to have originated from zoonotic transmission. the virus is most closely related to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and rat coronavirus (RCoV), which together are now classified as murine coronavirus (3, 20, 42) samples from southern china were collected from animal markets or restaurants.

nucleotide positions 30944 to 31012) that is conserved in CoVs (70). nsp5 (3C-like protease), nsp12 (RdRp), nsp13 (Hel), nsp15 (exonuclease [ExoN]), nsp16 (nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease [NendoU]), and nsp16 (2\u2032-O-ribose methyltransferase [O-MT] e polyprotein 1ab between ChRCoV HKU24 and other lineage A betacoronaviruses Replicase polyprotein domain Pairwise amino acid sequence identity with the ChRCoV HKU24 sequence. related HEs have been found in influenza C viruses, toroviruses, and lineage A CoVs, but not other CoVs. the HE of ChRCoV HKU24 forms a deep branch at the root of all members of the species Betacoronavirus 1 except ECoV. previous studies have demonstrated the heterogeneity of gene expression of HE proteins among different MHV strains. a new tab estimates tMRCA of the ChRCoV HKU24 strains, BCoV/HCoV OC43, and ChRCoV HKU24/members of Betacoronavirus 1/RbCoV HKU14. the mean estimated dates (above the branch) and Bayesian posterior probabilities (below the branch) are labeled. sera from two rabbits with RbCoV HKU14 infection were positive for antibodies against recombinant ChRCoV HKU24 N protein by Western blot assay. sera from two patients with HCoV OC43 infection were positive for antibodies against recombinant ChRCoV HKU24 N protein. sera from two rabbits with HCoV OC43 infection, sera from two rabbits with RbCoV HKU14 infection, and sera from two patients with SARS-CoV infection were all negative for antibody against recombinant ChRCoV HKU24 spike polypeptide by Western blot assay. the genome of ChRCoV HKU24 possessed features that resemble those of the genomes of both Betacoronavirus 1 and HCoV HKU1. it is more similar to murine coronavirus by the higher sequence identities in most predicted proteins, including NS2a, NS5 and S. Western blot assays based on recombinant ChRCoV HKU24 N protein and spike polypeptide showed a high seroprevalence of ChRCoV HKU24 infection among Norway rats from Guangzhou. no cross-reactivities between spike polypeptides were detected, supporting the specificity of coV spike polypeptide-based assays. four black rats and 15 Norway rats were positive for antibodies against the ChRCoV HKU24 N protein but not the spike polypeptide. this suggests a possible past infection by another CoV(s) and cross-reactivity from a close lineage A CoV. HCoV NL63 and HCoV 229E shared a common ancestor with diverse CoVs from leaf-nosed bats in Ghana. no complete genomes are available for the putative bat ancestors of HCoV NL63 and HCoV 229E. south african bat has been found to share 85% nucleotide sequence identity to the nucleotide sequence of the MERS-CoV genome. there has been no evidence that bats are the origin of human lineage A CoVs, such as HCoV OC43 and HCoV HKU1. however, the ancestral origin of members of Betacoronavirus 1 remains elusive. toroviruses and influenza C viruses can be found in bovine and porcine samples. further studies are required to determine if the HE proteins of potential rodent CoV ancestors may have been acquired from cattle or pigs. the potential pathogenicity and tissue tropism of ChRCoV HKU24 remain to be determined. strain sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) is more associated with upper respiratory tract, salivary and lacrimal gland, and eye infections and strain RCoV Parker causing pneumonia in experimentally infected rats. further investigations are required to study the tissue tropism and pathogenicity of ChRCoV HKU24 in Norway rats and other potential rodent reservoirs. some lineage A CoVs can replicate in cell lines such as BSC-1 and HRT-18. attempts to isolate ChRCoV HKU24 from the three positive samples were unsuccessful."}
