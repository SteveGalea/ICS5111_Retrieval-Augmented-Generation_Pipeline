{"summary": "the IAV NA protein is essential for release of virus particles from infected cells and decoy receptors. the NA protein is also an important target of the immune response and antiviral drugs (1\u20133) the optimal balance between the HA and NA proteins is probably adapted to the receptor repertoire of a specific host (13) the HA proteins of avian and human viruses generally prefer binding to 2,3- and 2,6-linked sialosides. the enzymatic activity of the NA protein may be modified via mutation of the catalytic site residues. substitution of a residue lacking SIA contact (here, a noncontact residue) in the 400 loop could also affect binding and cleavage of substrates. other substitutions in the 2nd SIA-binding site and the 2nd SIA-binding site in other NA subtypes affect/contribute to binding. the 2nd SIA-binding site in N1 was also shown to affect virus replication in vitro. previously, we expressed recombinant soluble tetrameric versions of the N1 proteins derived from different highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses. cleavage of glycan chains from fetuin and transferrin by serially diluted NA proteins was quantified by analyzing the binding of lectins with different binding specificities. a remarkably different result was obtained when the relative specific activity was determined with fetuin using ECA staining. all proteins preferred cleaving 2,3-linked (determined with fetuin-MALI) over 2,6-linked (determined with fetuin-SNA) SIAs. the HB protein displayed the largest preference for the cleavage of 2,3- over 2,6-linked (determined with fetuin-MALI) protein differs from the others by the mutation N369H in the 370 loop of the 2nd SIA-binding site. this mutation did not affect the ability of the resulting protein (HN-N369H) to cleave MUNANA or transferrin (Fig. 5A and C). s corresponding to the SIA contact residues in the 2nd SIA-binding site are underlined. Residues that differ between the avian HN and HB, WSN, and CA/09 proteins in the 2nd SIA-binding site are in boldface. substitutions in the HN mutants are also in boldface. amino acids at positions 368 and 369 that differ between HN and WSN are shown in stick representation (light blue) hydrogen bonds between SIA and residues in the 2nd SIA-binding site are shown as dashed red lines. membrane vesicles were analyzed using similar amounts of NA protein based on MUNANA activity (22) the membrane vesicles were analyzed in a biolayer interferometry binding experiment using similar amounts of NA protein. SIA contact residues in the 2nd SIA-binding site are highly conserved in N2 proteins of avian IAVs but much less so in human IAVs (9, 11, 14) also for N1, the conservation of the 2nd SIA-binding site appears lost in human IAVs (9, 11, 14) 1N1pdm09 viruses from 2009 to 2014 (pandemic human N1) using the Influenza Research Database. enzymatic activity and specificity of the HN N1 protein with those of the N1 proteins of the H1N1pdm09 virus and the human (laboratory-adapted) H1N1 WSN virus showed 2- to 3-fold lower specific activity than that of the HN protein when MUNANA was used. substrate specificities of indicated N1 proteins were determined by ELLA using different glycoprotein-lectin combinations. mean of 2 to 3 independent experiments performed in triplicate are shown for the MUNANA and ELLA assays. a large negative effect was smaller when transferrin was used. the HN TN-DS protein was relatively better in cleaving 2,6-linked SIAs linked to transferrin (transferrin-ECA/SNA) than 2,3-linked SIAs linked to fetuin (fetuin-ECA/MALI) compared to the wild-type HN and the HN TN-IS proteins. Means of 2 to 3 independent experiments performed in triplicate are shown. standard deviations are indicated. substitution of residues in the 400 loop either had a small negative effect on cleavage of all substrates including MUNANA. on the cleavage of fetuin-linked sialosides was observed when the SIA contact residue in the 430 loop (i.e., K432) was replaced by E, as observed in WSN NA. this substitution, which even resulted in increased cleavage of MUNANA, also decreased cleavage of transferrin-linked glycans. the H155Y substitution, located next to a framework residue (Fig. 3), resulted in reduced specific activity for all three substrates. the S434D mutation, located two residues downstream of the K432 residue, reduced cleavage of sialosides linked to fetuin and transferrin. the specific activity against MUNANA was not significantly affected. a large proportion contained the AAG codon encoding K432, as determined by sequence analysis of cloned PCR products. the rapid reversion of the mutant virus precluded detailed analysis of the in vitro growth kinetics. the presence of a functional 2nd SIA-binding site in N1 also affects growth in vitro. fetuin, containing both types of sialosides, was used as the substrate. human H1N1 viruses were relatively better in cleaving 2,6-linked SIAs. transferrin, which contains only 2,6-linked SIAs, was also apparent. substitution of noncontact residues in the 370 loop (position 368/369) resulted in even larger effects than mutation of a contact residue (position 372) in this loop. the most dramatic effects, however, were observed after substitution of the K432 residue in the 430 loop. mutation has only a marginal effect on the cleavage of sialosides linked to transferrin. other mutations in the 2nd SIA-binding site, however, were shown to significantly affect cleavage of sialosides linked to transferrin. recombinant virus carrying a mutated 2nd SIA-binding site rapidly reverted to functional 2nd SIA-binding site through back mutation of the residue at position 432. mutation of the 2nd SIA-binding site significantly affected in vitro growth. the importance of the 2nd SIA-binding site for replication and transmission in vivo remains to be established. expression plasmids encoding the NA ectodomain (head plus stalk domain) of A/duck/Hunan/795/2002 (H5N1) fused to a Staphylothermus marinus tetrabrachion tetramerization domain and a double Strep-tag. similar expression plasmids were constructed for the N1 proteins of A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) (GenBank accession no. AAA NA proteins were expressed by transfection of HEK293T cells (ATCC) with NA gene-containing plasmids. the proteins were purified from the cell culture supernatants. the activity of the proteins toward the synthetic monovalent substrate MUNANA was determined by using a fluorometric assay. purified NA protein (4 g) was precomplexed with anti-Strep-tag mouse antibody (2 g) (IBA) and with lumazine synthase nanoparticles genetically fused to domain B of protein A (0.25 g) (37) on ice for half an hour prior to incubation of limiting dilutions of these complexes. hemagglutination assays were performed twice in duplicate. plasmids consisting of synthetic H5 or N1 genes in vector pHW2000 were obtained from GenScript. plasmids consisting of synthetic H5 or N1 genes were flanked by the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 untranslated regions of the corresponding segments from PR8. similar expression plasmids were constructed for the N1 proteins of A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) (GenBank accession no. AAA91328.1; referred to as N1 WSN) and A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) the proteins were purified from the cell culture supernatants as similarly described previously (36). activity of the NA proteins toward the synthetic monovalent substrate MUNANA (Sigma-Aldrich) was determined by using a fluorometric assay as similarly described previously (10) the activities of the NA proteins toward multivalent glycoprotein substrates fetuin and transferrin were analyzed by ELLA as similarly described previously (10) HEK293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding full-length N1 HN and HB proteins (22) as described above. at 72 h posttransfection, cells were vesiculated as similarly described previously (30), and vesicle preparations were purified using Capto Core 700 beads. similar amounts of NA activity, and thus NA protein (22), were applied in the biolayer interferometry assays. the AAA codon encoding K432 in wild-type HN N1 was replaced by the GAG codon encoding E432 in the mutant HN N1. the nucleotide sequence encoding the wild-type multibasic amino acid sequence was modified to encode a low-pathogenic cleavage site."}
