{"summary": "more than three billion people continue to be at risk of rabies virus infection in more than 100 countries. 55,000 people die each year of rabies, which may be 100 times less than the actual figure. the gold standard for routine rabies virus detection is a direct fluorescent antibody test that uses postmortem brain tissue. dRIT requires a light microscope and refrigerated reagent storage. it is difficult to maintain cold storage in developing countries because of frequent interruptions to the power supply. dRIT requires a light microscope and refrigerated reagent storage. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethical Committee of the Medical Research Institute, Colombo, Sri Lanka, for experiments on human brain samples. animal samples were not used for any purposes other than the RICT. only a fraction of samples sent to the laboratory for routine diagnostic purposes were used for the RICT. animal brain samples were stored at \u201370\u00b0C until use. animals were removed from skulls of suspected rabid animals. animals were removed at site of death by a veterinarian. the type I kit12 was further improved by replacing the absorbent paper and nitrocellulose membrane, increasing the width from 5 mm to 6 mm, and increasing the amount of antibody on the test line from 0.5 g/strip to 1 g/strip. the buffer used with the type I kit was also replaced with a new buffer solution (20 mM Tris base, 1% Tween-20, and 0.1% sodium azide, pH 7.2) canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus, japanese encephalitis virus, chikungunya virus, west Nile virus, and dengue virus type 2) were applied directly to the test strip. results were read as described above. kappa is a measure of agreement that shows whether a test correctly predicts an outcome. the kappa value was interpreted as follows: poor agreement = 0.20, fair agreement = 0.20\u20130.40, moderate agreement = 0.40\u20130.60, and very good agreement = > 0.80.18 Sequences were manually edited and compiled. human samples could not be collected in Thailand because human rabies is rare in this country. it is also difficult to obtain permission to acquire samples from families of patients that died of rabies. animals were removed from skulls of suspected rabid animals by a trained person in the Rabies Laboratory. human brain samples from suspected rabies patients were forwarded by the Judicial Medical Officers from different districts in Sri Lanka while maintaining a cold chain. all samples were stored at \u201370\u00b0C until use. animal brains were removed from skulls of suspected rabid animals at regional laboratories. in the current study, the type I kit12 was further improved by replacing the absorbent paper and nitrocellulose membrane. the buffer used with the type I kit (0.1% Triton-X, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) was replaced with a new buffer solution (20 mM Tris base, 1% Tween-20, and 0.1% sodium azide, pH 7.2) canine adenovirus type 2, infectious canine hepatitis virus, canine parainfluenza virus, canine coronavirus, canine distemper virus, japanese encephalitis virus, chikungunya virus, and dengue virus type 2. supernatants from suckling mouse brain homogenates were applied directly to the test strip and results were read as described above. kappa is a measure of agreement that shows whether a test correctly predicts an outcome. deduced amino acid sequences of N genes were compared with those of rabies viruses that produced the same or different results with the FAT and RICT. FFU/mL Culture sup Pos NA (C1300) 1088-N1 2.0 107 FFU/mL Culture sup Pos NA (C1300) Nishigahara 1.0 107 FFU/mL Culture sup Pos BHK ERA-C1300 3.9 107 FFU/mL Culture sup Pos BHK Lyssavirus Lagos-B19 ND SMB Neg Mokola ND SMB Neg Duvenhage ND SMB Neg 248 samples were collected in Sri Lanka, including 115 brain samples from cats, 86 from humans, and 47 from other animals. sensitivity, specificity, specificity, PPV, NPV, accuracy, and kappa measure of agreement for the RICT compared with the FAT are shown in Table 2. five FAT-positive and three FAT-negative dog brain samples produced the same results when the RICT was stored at 25\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C for 48 hours. the RICT strips stored at 40\u00b0C for 24, 48, and 72 hours produced positive reactions with two rabies-negative samples. the complete N gene was determined for five strains that produced positive results using the FAT and RICT. three strains produced negative results using the FAT but positive results using the RICT. one strain produced a positive result with the FAT but a negative result with the RICT. a latex agglutination test was developed to diagnose rabies by using dog saliva. the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 97.6%, 97.4%, 95.2%, and 98.7% respectively. further studies are required to confirm whether this test can be used for brain samples because the presence of rabies virus in saliva is not a reliable indicator. the RICT showed a high sensitivity and specificity when testing for animal rabies. only cat brains produced a lower sensitivity. the kappa measure of agreement was good for cat samples. the RICT has the advantages that it is user-friendly, rapid, robust, easily deliverable, and requires no specialist equipment. Molecular tests and the FAT can be used as periodic confirmatory tests to ensure good laboratory practice."}
