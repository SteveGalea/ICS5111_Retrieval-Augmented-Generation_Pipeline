{"summary": "BVDV is categorized as a notifiable disease by the Act on domestic animal infectious disease control. other animals in the same herds must then be tested for BVDV infection (outbreak investigation of newly infected herds) to control BVD in the cattle population, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in Japan has promoted a vaccination and testing policy. the default probability of cattle being persistently or transiently infected was the same as those observed in the previous study. in several scenarios, a certain proportion of cattle in outside were assumed to be vaccinated. in several scenarios, a certain proportion of cattle in outside were assumed to be vaccinated; thus they would possess enough immunity to protect from BVDV infection. the cost of compulsory testing should be assumed either as 2,000 JPY by RT-PCR or as 1,000 JPY by antigen-detection using ear-notch sample. we adopted the cheaper price of each of two tests and set the unit cost of BTM and compulsory testing as 10 JPY and 1,000 JPY per animal. BVDV prevalence among inherent cattle in the target area was changed from 0.4% as a default setting to either 0.1% or 0.025%. probability of persistent infection in the scenarios of 0.1% and 0.025% inherent BVDV prevalence were set to half those of persistent infection in the same scenario. BVD is categorized as a notifiable disease by the Act on domestic animal infectious disease control. other animals in the same herds must then be tested for BVDV infection (outbreak investigation of newly infected herds) in the default setting, none of cattle introduced from outside was assumed to possess sufficient immunity to protect from BVDV infection because none would have been vaccinated. in several scenarios, a certain proportion of cattle in outside were assumed to be vaccinated; thus they would possess enough immunity to protect from BVDV infection. compulsory testing of introduced animals was applied as an optional control measure. the cost of compulsory testing should be assumed as 2,000 JPY by RT-PCR or as 1,000 JPY by antigen-detection. the cost of compulsory testing should be assumed either as 2,000 JPY by RT-PCR or as 1,000 JPY by antigen-detection using ear-notch sample. in the scenarios of compulsory testing of non-vaccinated animals, we set a total of five different vaccination coverages in outside of the target area. BVDV prevalence among inherent cattle was changed from 0.4% as a default setting to either 0.1% or 0.025%. probability of persistent infection in the scenarios of 0.1% and 0.025% inherent BVDV prevalence were set to half those of persistent infection in the same scenario. a set of 5%, 50%, and 95% percentiles of the sum of the missed animals and expected natural infections were calculated in each simulation. probability of persistent infection among inherent cattle was fixed at 0.4% [RiskPert (0.003, 0.004, 0.005)] median number of detected and missed BVD cattle was 18.3 and 16.2 respectively. if BTM testing was also implemented, the median number of detected cases increased to 23.2 and the median number of missed cases decreased to 13.5. median numbers of detected and missed BVD cattle cases decreased with lower BVDV prevalence. median numbers of detected and missed BVD cattle cases decreased with lower BVDV prevalence. median numbers of detected and BVD cattle cases decreased with lower BVDV prevalence. BVD prevalence without implementation of compulsory or BTM testing decreased from 0.4% to 0.15% in approximately 10 years. compulsory testing of heifers affected the decrease in the 15-year BVD prevalence. implementation of compulsory testing of heifers estimated the 15-year BVD prevalence to be approximately 0.06% and 0.03%. simulations of each control measure were repeated from 0.40% of prevalence (0 year) to 15 years. abbreviations of the scenarios were same as ones in Fig. 2. introduced heifers were 18.3 and 16.2 respectively. if BTM testing was implemented, the median number of detected cases increased to 23.2 and the median number of missed cases decreased to 13.5. compulsory testing was effective in increasing the number of detected BVD cattle. median numbers of detected and missed BVD cattle cases decreased with lower BVDV prevalence. median numbers of detected and missed BVD cattle cases decreased with lower BVDV prevalence. median numbers of detected and BVD cattle cases decreased with lower BVDV prevalence. implementation of BTM testing estimated the 15-year BVD prevalence to be less than 0.1%. compulsory testing of heifers affected the decrease in the 15-year BVD prevalence. implementation of compulsory testing of all cattle with and without BTM testing estimated the 15-year BVD prevalence to be approximately 0.06% and 0.03%, respectively. seven cattle on six farms tested positive for persistent infection with BVDV among 5,949 cattle from 79 farms analyzed. four out of six affected farms had not implemented vaccination for one year. none of the seven PI animals had been vaccinated, indicating that non-vaccination may be a major factor in Japan for persistent BVDV infection in cattle. the effectiveness of BTM tests using antigen monitoring has been widely recognized and reported. however, this effective and cheap monitoring program cannot be applied to beef cattle population. under very low BVDV prevalence, the monitoring effectiveness at 0% of vaccination coverage was not apparently different from that at 100%. a certain proportion of infected cattle could not be removed from the entire population even by monitoring with a highly sensitive test for a long time. prevalence of BVD in cattle decreased to 0.02% in Switzerland and to 0.03% in Germany but could not reach zero [11, 40] it should be beneficial to spend control expenditures in a short period. the longer the status is maintained, the more cost effective the program becomes. cost-effective analysis should be performed to develop appropriate voluntary BVD control measures."}
