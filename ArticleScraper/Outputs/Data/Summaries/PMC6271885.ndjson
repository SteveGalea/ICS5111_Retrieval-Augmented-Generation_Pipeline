{"summary": "lignans are important components of foods and medicines biosynthetically deriving from the radical coupling of two molecules of coniferyl alcohol at C-8/C-8\u2032 positions. they are classified in different groups\u2014dibenzylfuran, dihydroxybenzylbutane, dibenzylbutyrolactol, dibenzylbutyrolactone, aryltetraline lactone and arylnaphtalene derivatives. the authors proposed two different pathways for hinokinin biosynthesis starting from (+)-pinoresinol (Scheme 1). in the first pathway, pinoresinol is reduced to secoisolariciresinol by a pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase (PLR-Lc1) followed by the formation of the methylenedioxy bridges on pinoresinol. hinokinin was isolated from C. formonensis [16] and from several other plants. it was also found in different species of Phyllanthus [30,31,32], Aristolochia [33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43], Piper [44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53], Virola [54,55,56,57,58], Linum [59 et al. tested hinokinin (1) isolated from anthriscus sylvestris [68] against cell lines using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)-microculture assay. results are reported in Table 1. hinokinin (1) could be regarded as an antitumoral compound against P-388, HT-29, B16F10, HeLa and MK-1 cell lines. mansoor et al. evaluated the apoptosis induction of hinokinin in human hepatoma HuH-7 cells. hinokinin significantly reduced viability of HuH-7 cells and it showed to be a strong inducer of apoptosis. hinokinin is a potent inhibitory compound on human neutrophil superoxide generation and elastase release by neutrophils with an IC50 of 0.06 0.12 g/mL and an inhibitory percentage of 24.7 6.2 at 10 g/mL. also, it was able to inhibit LPS-induced nitric oxide generation in RAW264.7 macrophages. hinokinin exerts its anti-inflammatory effects via an NFB-dependent mechanism. il-6 and TNF- exert a central analgesic activity too. trypanosoma cruzi has a complex life cycle characterized by several developmental forms present in vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. this parasite exists in at least three morphologically distinct forms: infective (metacyclic or blood trypomastigotes), insect borne (epimastigotes) which replicate in the vector, and intracellular replicative (amastigotes) hinokinin (1) was selected to be assayed against epimastigote and intracellular amastigote forms of T. cruzi. in vitro and in vivo assays obtained results showed hinokinin (1)promoted 70.8% of parasitaemia reduction in the parasitaemic peak. hinokinin was shown to be effective on trypomastigotes, but it resulted toxic to mammalian cells and with a low parasite select the reduction of tissue parasitism upon treatment with hinokinin (1) was evaluated in vivo by Esperandim and coworkers. treatment with hinokinin (1) promoted significant reduction of tissue parasitism (liver, spleen and heart) compared with data recorded for untreated controls. m2) Spleen Heart Liver CINF 10.86 2.45 18.20 8.81 32.99 7.78 C b 8.12 2.04 15.05 8.64 28.56 5.69 Hinokinin 20 c 9.32 2.22 17.48 8.53 30.15 7.90 Hinokinin 50 d 10.00 2.68 18.56 7.74 30.50 7.49 BZN 20 c 9.69 2.50 17.59 7.08 29.46 8.03 BZN 50 d 9.62 2.37. kinin (1) has been studied for its bioactivity against several other microorganisms. for example, Silva et al. examined the activity of this compound against oral pathogens. it can be pointed out from data reported in Table 5 that 1 showed a discrete antimicrobial activity. hinokinin has a protective effect in preventing clastogenic damage caused by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), with the percent reduction ranging from 37.4% to 57.6%. mutagenicity assays show 1 did not induce any increase in the number of revertant colonies relative to the negative control. Hinokinin (1) showed neuroprotective activity against glutamate induced neurotoxicity in primary cultures of rat cortical cells. but this protective effect of hinokinin was not dose dependent. non-competitive antagonist of NMDA (n-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor (one of the glutamate receptors) showed at 1.0 M 71.7 1.2 and at 10.0 M 77.4 2.1 percentage of protection) in humans, 57 isoforms of CYP were identified, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 among others. the cytotoxicity of hinokinin (1) has been investigated by several authors against different cancer lines. the cytotoxicity of hinokinin (1) has been investigated by several authors. hinokinin was also examined as antitumor promoter agent in a human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) immediate early early antigen expression in human lung adenocarcinoma (A-549) cells. the authors found that 1 was able to reduce the IE antigen expression in HCMV-infected lung cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Hinokinin was shown to be a potent inhibitory compound on human neutrophil superoxide generation and elastase release by neutrophils with an IC50 of 0.06 0.12 g/mL and an inhibitory percentage of 24.7 6.2 at 10 g/mL. this anti-inflammatory activity was accompanied by an analgesic effect as demonstrated by da Silva et al. hinokinin (1) exerts its anti-inflammatory effects via an NFB-dependent mechanism. it has no activity against NFAT transcription factor [80] but was found active in the lipopolysaccharide induced cytokine production assay. activity against trypanosoma cruzi Hinokinin showed an interesting activity against trypanosoma cruzi, the responsible of Chagas\u2019 disease. nifurtimox and benznidazole (BZN) cause serious side effects. hinokinin (1) was selected to be assayed against epimastigote and intracellular amastigote forms of T. cruzi, both in vitro and in vivo assays. hinokinin was shown to be effective on trypomastigotes, but resulted toxic to mammalian cells. the treatment of infected mice with hinokinin-loaded microparticles was able to reduce the number of parasites more than hinokinin itself. the reduction of tissue parasitism upon treatment with hinokinin (1) was evaluated in vivo by Esperandim and coworkers. hinokinin reduced the number of circulating forms at peak parasitemia of 51%, while at 50 mg/kg of 34.2%. the karyometry analysis once again showed a better behavior of 20 mg/kg dose. antiplasmodial activity Hinokinin was tested against 3D7-chloroquine sensitive and Dd2-chloroquine resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. the IC50 of hinokinin (90.7 1.4 g/mL and 54.4 8.5 g/mL, respectively; chloroquine IC50 0.094 g/mL) showed that 1 doesn\u2019t possess significant antimalarial activity against either strain [94]. hinokinin (1) was selected to be assayed against epimastigote and intracellular amastigote forms of T. cruzi, both in vitro and in vivo assays. hinokinin was shown to be effective on trypomastigotes, but resulted toxic to mammalian cells and with a low parasite selectivity index. the treatment of infected mice with hinokinin-loaded microparticles was able to reduce the number of parasites more than hinokinin itself. the reduction of tissue parasitism upon treatment with hinokinin (1) was evaluated in vivo by Esperandim and coworkers. hinokinin reduced the number of circulating forms at peak parasitemia of 51%, while at 50 mg/kg of 34.2%. the karyometry analysis once again showed a better behavior of 20 mg/kg dose. antiplasmodial activity Hinokinin (1) was tested against 3D7-chloroquine sensitive and Dd2-chloroquine resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum. the IC50 of hinokinin (90.7 1.4 g/mL and 54.4 8.5 g/mL, respectively; chloroquine IC50 0.094 g/mL) showed that 1 doesn\u2019t possess significant antimalarial activity against either strain. hinokinin has a protective effect in preventing clastogenic damage caused by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) it has a protective effect in preventing clastogenic damage caused by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) the mutagenicity assays show that 1 did not induce any increase in the number of revertant colonies relative to the negative control. the differences of micronucleated cells between treated animals and control were not significative, demonstrating no genotoxic effect. however, this protective effect of hinokinin was not dose dependent. monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonine have a positive action as classical growth factors. glutamate and GABA are down-regulating proliferation agents [104] Hinokinin (1) showed neuroprotective activity against glutamate induced neurotoxicity in primary cultures of rat cortical cells. usia et al. showed hinokinin is active on CYP3A4 but not on CYP2D6 [109] and that CYP3A4 is inhibited in a time-, concentration- and NADPH-dependent manners via the formation of a metabolite intermediate complex. the most studied biological activities of these compounds are their antioxidant and anticancer properties."}
