{"summary": "the spike (S) glycoproteins of coronaviruses are no exception and mediate binding to host cells followed by membrane fusion. they are major targets for neutralizing antibodies and form the characteristic corona of large, distinctive spikes in the viral envelopes. level of overall sequence similarity between the predicted amino acid sequence of the SCV S glycoprotein and the S glycoproteins of other coronaviruses is low (20\u201327% pairwise amino acid identity) two other groups obtained similar results and found that independently folded fragments containing residues 318 to 510 [8] and 270 to 510 [10] can bind receptor molecules. a short RBD fragment containing only two potential glycosylation sites folds independently and binds ACE2. the fragments were secreted in the culture supernatant (Fig 1A) and bound to ACE2-expressing cells. the other fragments were not secreted (Fig. 1A) but could be detected by Western in cell lysates. these results suggest that a short fragment (S319\u2013518) can be independently folded and secreted in a soluble form, and can bind ACE2. mutants that significantly decrease binding to ACE2 are shown in bold. mutants that significantly decrease binding to ACE2 are shown in bold. mutants that significantly decrease binding to ACE2 are shown in bold. all three mutants were expressed and ran on SDS-PAGE at molecular weights of about 3 kD smaller than the unmodified fragment. the shorter fragment (S319\u2013518) where asparagines were also mutated to glutamines, which better mimic asparagines. these results suggest that all glycosylation sites in the RBD are functional. mutants were mutated to either alanines (Ala 2) or glutamines (Gln 2). these mutants were not detected in the culture supernatants. these results suggest that at least one glycosylation site is required for secretion of functional RBD fragments. the protein mutated at R441 expressed poorly and we were not able to assess its role in the RBD binding. the mutated fragment expressed at low concentration but its binding equaled the binding of the non-mutated protein. the mutations for the selected panel of residues that do affect binding are significantly (about 2-fold) more than those that do not, suggesting possible mechanisms of immune evasion. six cysteine residues are conserved indicating the possibility for up to three possible disulphide bridges within the S RBD. most of the residues we found important for binding are highly variable except T431, Q492 and R495, which are highly conserved. the results suggested that the SCV S RBD is much more distant than the respective regions of the other tested coronaviruses. hepatitis virus (MHV, 325\u2013611). phylogram tree is shown with distances along the protein names. phylogram tree is shown with distances along the protein names. two mutants with very significantly reduced binding to ACE2 make contacts with ACE2 residues. they are separated by residues whose mutations do not affect binding to ACE2. buried residues are seen as blurred red. the numbers after S denote the amino acid residues confining the fragment. the fragments were secreted in the culture supernatant (Fig 1A) and bound to ACE2-expressing cells and purified ACE2. the other fragments were not secreted (Fig. 1A) but could be detected by Western in cell lysates. mutants that significantly decrease binding to ACE2 are shown in bold. binding and expression values for the individual mutants are expressed as a percentage of the value for the S319\u2013518 (wt) that is assumed 100%. the potential glycosylation sites in the RBD fragments are functional. all three mutants were expressed and ran on SDS-PAGE at molecular weights of about 3 kD smaller than the unmodified fragment. these results suggest that all glycosylation sites in the RBD are functional. only one glycosylation site is required for secretion of functional RBD fragments. mutants were mutated to either alanines (Ala 2) or glutamines (Gln 2). RBD fragment mutated at D454 or Y494 was expressed at slightly lower levels but binding was much more significantly reduced. the T431 mutation reduced binding but to lesser extent than the other mutations that decreased very significantly (more than 10-fold) the RBD-ACE2 interaction. four of the other 12 mutations (indicated with * in Table 1) do not affect binding to ACE2 when converted to A. six cysteine residues are conserved indicating the possibility for up to three possible disulphide bridges within the S RBD. equine coronavirus (ECoV, 327\u2013622), porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV, 327\u2013608), rat sialodacryoadenitis coronavirus (RtCoV, 325\u2013610) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV, 325\u2013611) dark and gray colors indicate the identity and similarity of residues aligned. the residues that decrease the receptor binding are labeled (R426, N473). the buried residues, which reduce the receptor binding as observed in the experiment, are seen as blurred red. ACE2 binds with high (nM) affinity to S and is expected to induce conformational changes required for membrane fusion [6-8,14]. ACE2 binds with high (nM) affinity to S and is expected to induce conformational changes required for membrane fusion. residues R426 and N473 are likely to contribute to the bulk of the free energy of interaction. further studies are required for the elucidation of the energy profile of the S RBD-ACE2 interaction. all glycosylation sites are localized at the N-terminal portion of the RBD. most of the mutations described in this study did not affect binding of the S RBD to ACE2. this finding suggests that the virus could easily mutate and escape antibodies that do not exhibit the same energy profile of binding to ACE2 as ACE2. further studies are required in the context of the whole oligomeric S protein. PCR amplified fragments were then directionally cloned into expression vector pSecTag 2B using restriction enzymes Bam HI and Eco RI. the various mutations on S317\u2013518 and S319\u2013518 were generated using the QuickChange\u00ae XL Site Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) inant vaccinia virus encoding the gene for the T7 polymerase. soluble S fragments were obtained from the cell culture medium. Western blotting buffer and DTT (final concentration 50 mM) were added to either S proteins concentrated from the culture supernatant. the ELISA was used to score binding of the various S protein fragments to the receptor ACE 2. the second ELISA was used to score the binding of the various S protein fragments to the receptor ACE 2. monoclonal anti-c-Myc epitope antibodies (unconjugated and conjugated to HRP) were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, California) fragments S364\u2013537 (5'-GATCGGATCCTCAACCTTT AAGTGC-3' and 5'-GATCGAATTCC AGTAC CAGTGAG-3') were PCR amplified using the primers mentioned within the parentheses. cloned into expression vector pSecTag 2B using restriction enzymes Bam HI and Eco RI. mutations on S317\u2013518 and S319\u2013518 were generated using the site directed mutation kit. cells were infected with vaccinia virus encoding the gene for the T7 polymerase. the cell pellets were incubated with ABTS substrate from Roche (Indianapolis, IN) at RT for 10 min. the substrate was cleared by centrifugation, and OD405 was measured. a sandwich ELISA was used in which the plate was coated with anti-His tag antibody. BLAST against PDB database retrieved 5 hits. 4 of them have longer stretch of amino acids. author declares they have no competing interests."}
