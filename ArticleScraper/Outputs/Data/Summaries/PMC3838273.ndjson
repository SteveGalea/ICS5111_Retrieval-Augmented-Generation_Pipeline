{"summary": "in 2008, Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) was identified as clonally integrated in 80% of MCCs (5). it is the most recently discovered virus known to cause human cancer and the first human polyomavirus strongly linked with tumor induction (6, 7) previous studies with related polyomaviruses, such as simian virus 40 (SV40), show that ST is required for upregulation of early viral promoter activity and also stimulates LT-mediated activation of the late viral promoter. SV40 ST activity is due to an interaction with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), the major cellular serine/threonine phosphatase. NF-B is found in an inhibited cytoplasmic form, maintained in this conformation by virtue of an interaction with members of the inhibitor of B (IB) family of proteins. NF-B activated in response to inflammatory stimuli by cytokines. human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and molluscum contagiosum poxvirus target NEMO to disrupt IKK activation through an interaction with NEMO. the virus prevents NF-B activation downstream of the IKK complex by encoding an IB orthologue, replacing the host inhibitor upon IKK-induced degradation. the MCPyV ST was PCR amplified from MCC genomic DNA. primers 5\u2032-GGG GGT ACC ATG GAT TTA GTC and 5\u2032-GGG CCC GGG CTA GAA A were cloned into pEGFP-cI to generate pEGFP-ST. ase gene in pGL3-Basic, to generate pGL3-Early. antibodies against NEMO, LC3 (Cell Signaling), lamin B (Calbiochem), GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Abcam), phospho-IB (Cell Signaling), phospho-IKK/IKK (Cell Signaling), p50 (Santa Cruz), FLAG (S cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40) doxycycline hyclate was induced with 2 g/ml doxycycline hyclate for up to 48 h. proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE before transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane. i293-ST and MCC13 cells were transfected with 50 ng of reporter plasmid expressing firefly luciferase under control of the NF-B elements from the concanavalin A promoter (32), a cyclic AMP responsive promoter (pCRE) or a tandem AP-1 element reporter using polyethyleneimine (PEI) after 24 h, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. lysates were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehydehydehydehydehydehydehydehydehydehydehydehydehydehydehydehydehydehydehyde 293 cells were transfected with 2 g of pEGFP-cI or pEGFP-ST. after 12 h, the appropriate wells were either mock treated or treated with either an inhibitor cocktail (pepstatin [100 M] and leupeptin [3.64 M]) or 3-methyladenine (5 nM) for 12 h at 37\u00b0C. beads were resuspended in 40 l 2 protein solubilizing buffer. each sample was then mixed, separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. each gel slice was then subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin. pEGFP-ST truncation series was PCR amplified from pEGFP-ST. pGFP-ST95-111 and pGFP-ST111-128 deletion mutants were produced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis were carried out. hek293, Huh7, and Flp-In 293 cells were cotransfected with iST-FLAG and pPGK/Flip/ObpA using Lipofectamine 2000. RNA was harvested from uninduced or induced i293-ST cells by TRIzol extraction, before incubation with chloroform and precipitation by addition of isopropanol. RNA was treated for genomic DNA contamination using a DNase-free kit (Ambion), before purification using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) cells were transfected with 50 ng of pRLTK Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid expressing firefly luciferase under the control of the NF-B elements from the concanavalin A promoter (32), a cyclic AMP responsive promoter (pCRE) or a tandem AP-1 element reporter using polyethyleneimine (PEI) 293 cells were transfected with the appropriate vectors to perform epitope tag-based coimmunoprecipitation assays. cellular lysates were harvested after 48 h and then incubated with protein A-agarose beads. after 48 h, precleared cellular lysates were then incubated with no antibody, a control antibody, or a NEMO-specific polyclonal antibody (Abcam) for 2 h. 293 cells were transfected with 2 g of pEGFP-cI or pEGFP-ST. after 12 h, the appropriate wells were either mock treated or treated with either an inhibitor cocktail (pepstatin [100 M] and leupeptin [3.64 M]) or 3-methyladenine (5 nM) for 12 h at 37\u00b0C. the entire protein gel lane was excised and cut into 6 gel slices. each gel slice was then subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin. i293-ST cells were induced for 42 h and then incubated with 100 ng/ml TNF- (InvivoGen) in 10% DMEM. the MCPyV ST gene amplified is identical to the MCC350 isolate (5). a stable inducible cell line was subsequently produced via site-specific DNA recombination within a Flp-In 293 cell line, termed i293-ST. i293-ST cells remained uninduced or were incubated for either 24 or 48 h in the presence of doxycycline hyclate. HEK 293 cells were transfected with either pEGFP-cI or pEGFP-ST and pGL3-Early. cell lysates were harvested after 24 h and used in a luciferase assay. results show the average luciferase emissions of triplicate measurements. MCC13 cells were transfected with either control EGFP or EGFP-ST expression constructs. they then stimulated NF-B activation using TNF-. ELISAs were then performed, measuring secrete levels of both CCL20 and IL-8. independent experiments were performed in the i293-ST cell and the MCC MCC-negative MCC13 cell line transfected with control EGFP or EGFP-ST expression constructs. MCPyV ST specifically downregulates NF-B activity downstream of receptor complexes. cotransfections were performed using NF-B, the cyclic-AMP responsive promoter, and tandem AP-1 responsive reporter plasmids. samples were then analyzed for luciferase activity. a plausible alternative is that MCPyV ST interacts with another target protein within the pathway. 293 cells were cotransfected with either EGFP or EGFP-ST. no other interactions were observed with other tagged proteins associated with the NF-B pathway. 293 cells were cotransfected with EGFP or EGFP-ST in presence of either GST or GST-NEMO expression vectors. transfected cell lysates were probed with either beads alone control, control antibody (Ab) or GFP-TRAP affinity beads. bound protein was immunoblotted with a GST-specific antibody. expression of EGFP-ST resulted in an increase in the number and size of the cytoplasmic puncta. this was particularly evident in the EGFP-ST-transfected MCC13 cell line. confocal imaging suggests that the puncta are cytoplasmic, but we cannot rule out the presence of some nuclear puncta. MV targets NEMO for autophagosomal degradation, curtailing the cellular inflammatory response (26). cytoplasmic puncta containing MCPyV ST and NEMO observed colocalized with the autophagosome marker, microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) (45). endogenous NEMO levels were also assessed in the presence of MCPyV ST. interaction between NEMO and upstream kinases may interfere with phosphorylation status of cytoplasmic IB upon NF-B stimulation. i293-ST cells remained uninduced or MCPyV ST expression was induced for 42 h prior to 6 h serum starvation. p50, RelA, and phosphorylated IB levels were not detected in unstimulated cells. MCPyV ST inhibits phosphorylation of IB and prevents nuclear translocation of the NF-B heterodimer. cells were then serum starved before TNF- was used to stimulate activation of the NF-B pathway. phosphorylation (Ser176/177) returned to basal levels by 60 min in uninduced cells. phosphatases are required to inhibit IKK/IKK phosphorylation. i293-ST cells remained uninduced or induced for MCPyV ST expression. polyomavirus ST-PP2A interactions are well characterized (46); however, the interaction between MCPyV ST and PP2A A is not required for MCPyV ST-mediated cellular transformation (14). SILAC-based pulldown assays were employed to identify additional MCPyV ST cellular phosphatase-interacting partners. iST-293 and i293-FLAG cells were grown in \"light\" and \"heavy\" DMEM. precipitated proteins were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. LC-MS/MS analysis was then performed to identify precipitated proteins. for PP4C immunoprecipitations, cell lysates were incubated with protein A-agarose beads. immunoprecipitated proteins were identified using a control or FLAG-specific antibody. results show that MCPyV ST interacts with both PP4C and PP2A A subunits. cells were transfected with either EGFP or EGFP-ST in the presence of myc-NEMO and FLAG-PP4C expression vectors. after 24 h, cells were fixed and permeabilized, and GFP fluorescence was analyzed by direct visualization. endogenous NEMO and PP2A A were identified by indirect immunofluorescence using NEMO- and EE-specific antibodies. the amount of EGFP, EGFP-ST, or cellular phosphatase proteins also precipitated was identified using a polyclonal Myc-specific antibody. results show that in the presence of EGFP-ST, an increase in precipitated FLAG-PP4C or EE-PP2A A is observed compared with the presence of control EGFP alone. 293 cells were transfected with an EGFP control vector, EGFP-ST, the EGFP-R7A mutant or each EGFP carboxy-terminal truncation in the presence of a NEMO-myc expression vector. a region containing residues 95 to 128 is required for PP4C binding. a similar experiment was also performed to map the MCPyV ST interaction domain required for NEMO binding. 2A A is not required for the interaction between PP4C and NEMO. 293 cells were cotransfected with either an EGFP control vector, EGFP-ST, EGFP-ST R7A or each EGFP carboxy-terminal truncation in the presence of a FLAG-PP4C expression vector. similar coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed as described for the carboxy truncation mutants above. results showed that deletion of residues 111 to 128 (111-128 mutant) had no effect on PP4C binding. however, residues 95 to 128 of MCPyV ST are required for the interaction between MCPyV ST and both PP4C and PP2A A. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with pEGFPcI, pEGFP-ST, R7A, 95\u2013111 mutant, 111\u2013128 mutant, or pGL3-Early. results show the average luciferase emissions of triplicate measurements. EGFP-ST, EGFP-ST R7A, EGFP-95\u2013111 mutant, or 111\u2013128 mutant were transfected with a reporter plasmid expressing firefly luciferase. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TNF- for 12 h. to normalize transfection efficiency, values were normalized relative to the densitometry expression levels of the EGFP and EGFP FP-ST R7A, EGFP-ST 95-111, and 111-128 mutants inhibited NF-B-driven luciferase expression in response to TNF-. PP2A A is not required for MCPyV ST-mediated downregulation of NF-B-targeted transcription. this suggests that the interaction between the cellular phosphatases PP4C and/or PP2A A, NEMO, and MCPyV yV ST gene amplified is identical to the MCC350 isolate (5). yV ST downregulates cellular gene expression associated with the NF-B pathway. a stable inducible cell line was produced via site-specific DNA recombination within a Flp-In 293 cell line, termed i293-ST. uninduced (Uni) or induced (In) i293-ST cells were transfected with pGL3-Early. cells were harvested after 24 h and used in a luciferase assay to determine the amount of light emitted in relative fluorescence units. ELISAs were then performed, measuring secreted levels of CCL20 and IL-8. results showed that in TNF-stimulated cells, levels of both CCL20 and IL-8 were downregulated significantly in the presence of MCPyV ST. independent experiments were performed in the i293-ST cell and the MCC-negative MCC13 cell line transfected with control EGFP or EGFP-ST expression constructs. MCPyV ST strongly inhibited NF-B-driven luciferase expression in response to known NF-B activating agents, TNF-, TPA, and IL-1. uninduced or induced i293-ST (i) or MCC13 cells were cotransfected with a concanavalin A promoter reporter plasmid. samples were analyzed for luciferase activity, *, P 0.05 versus control (t test) a series of coimmunoprecipitations were performed using GST-Sepharose 4B beads. results show enhanced binding between MCPyV ST and the NF-B pathway. no other interactions were observed with other tagged proteins associated with the NF-B pathway. transfected cell lysates were incubated with either beads alone control, control antibody (Ab) or GFP-TRAP affinity beads. bound protein was immunoblotted with a GST-specific antibody. i293-ST cells remained uninduced or were incubated with doxycycline for 48 h. a proportion of MCPyV ST colocalizes with NEMO following transfection of Huh7 (A) and MCC13 (B) cells with either pEGFP or pEGFP-ST in the presence of pNEMO-myc. after 24 h, cells were fixed and permeabilized. cytoplasmic puncta containing MCPyV ST and NEMO observed colocalized with the autophagosome marker, microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) (45). endogenous NEMO levels were also assessed in the presence of MCPyV ST. 293 cells expressing EGFP or EGFP-ST were left untreated or incubated for 12 h. i293-ST cells remained uninduced or MCPyV ST expression was induced for 42 h prior to 6 h serum starvation. NF-B activation was then stimulated using TNF-. nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were then subjected to immunoblotting and densitometry-based quantification. i293-ST cells remained uninduced (Un) or induced (In) for MCPyV ST expression. cells were serum starved before TNF- was used to stimulate activation of the NF-B pathway. nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were then isolated and analyzed. cells treated with broad-spectrum phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid increased IKK/IKK phosphorylation in MCPyV ST-expressing cells. i293-ST cells remained uninduced for MCPyV ST expression. cellular phosphatases are required to inhibit IKK/IKK phosphorylation. SILAC-based pulldown assays were employed to identify additional MCPyV ST cellular phosphatase-interacting partners. i293-ST cells expressing the MCPyV ST-FLAG-tagged protein were metabolically labeled in \u201cheavy\u201d media containing 13C isotopes of arginine and lysine. iST-293 and i293-FLAG cells were grown in \"light\" and \"heavy\" DMEM. precipitated proteins were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. LC-MS/MS analysis was then performed to identify precipitated proteins. for PP2A A, cell lysates were incubated with GFP-TRAP beads. immunoprecipitated proteins were identified using an EE-specific antibody. results show that MCPyV ST interacts with both PP4C and PP2A A subunits. GFP fluorescence was analyzed by direct visualization. endogenous NEMO and PP2A A were identified by indirect immunofluorescence. 293 cells were transfected with either EGFP or EGFP-ST. EGFP-ST, or cellular phosphatase proteins also precipitated was identified. increase in precipitated EGFP-ST is also observed in the presence of both cellular phosphatases, particularly PP4C. this suggests that MCPyV ST can enhance the interaction between the cellular phosphatases and NEMO. blot analysis was performed using a myc-specific antibody to assess the presence of interacting GFP-ST fusion proteins. results show that the R7A mutant inhibited the interaction between MCPyV ST and PP2A A. however, analysis of the MCPyV ST interaction domain required for PP4C binding showed that a region containing residues 95 to 128 is required for PP4C binding. 293 cells were cotransfected with either an EGFP control vector, EGFP-ST, EGFP-ST R7A or each EGFP carboxy-terminal truncation in the presence of a NEMO-myc expression vector. transfected cell lysates were probed with GFP-, FLAG-, or GAPDH-specific antibodies to serve as a loading control (Input) deletion of residues 111 to 128 (111-128 mutant) had no effect on PP4C or NEMO binding. however, residues 95 to 111 are required for interaction between PP2A A and PP4C. coimmunoprecipitation assays performed using 293 cells cotransfected with an EGFP control vector, EGFP-ST or either the EGFP-ST95\u2013111 or 111\u2013128 mutant. transfected cell lysates were probed with EE-, GFP-, or GAPDH-specific antibodies to serve as a loading control (Input) ase under control of the NF-B elements from the concanavalin A promoter. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TNF- for 12 h. to normalize transfection efficiency, values were normalized relative to densitometry expression levels. a similar inhibition was observed for the R7A mutant, which failed to interact with PP4C and PP2A A and NEMO. this suggests that the interaction between the cellular phosphatases PP4C and/or PP2A A, PP2A A and NEMO is required for the MCPyV ST-mediated suppression of NF-B-targeted transcription. NF-B pathway inhibition is a common mechanism used by viruses to subvert the host innate response, preventing expression of cytokines, chemokines, and proteins involved in antigen presentation. NEMO controls NF-B activation in response to a wider range of stimuli. NEMO is an attractive target for virus subversion of host responses. sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (HPV) ORF71 protein binds NEMO, regulating NF-B. HPV E7 protein also inhibits activation of NF-B by attenuating the IB complex. PP2A and PP4C have been shown to dephosphorylate and inactivate the IKK complex. phosphorylation events serve to regulate NEMO function and inflammatory signaling. it will be of interest to determine whether NEMO is also a target for ST-associated protein phosphatases in MCPyV-expressing cells. tumor sets are indistinguishable in terms of histological and clinical features. no MCPyV-positive tumors present phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/pAKT activation. a subset of MCPyV-negative tumors contains PI3K-activating mutations. protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) interacts with the PP2A A and B subunits (64) PP5 differs from the other serine/threonine phosphatases, as its regulatory and catalytic regions are encoded within a single polypeptide chain (65) PP5 catalytic region is related to the PP2A catalytic subunit. between PP2A A and PP4C will allow further dissection of the function of these phosphatases in the MCPyV life cycle. these findings highlight a novel and important role of MCPyV ST to subvert the innate immune response."}
