{"summary": "fluorescence and gel electrophoresis experiments revealed a tight self-assembly of TMD in the model membrane. the central TMD oligomer was packed by FP in an antiparallel fashion. FP insertion into the membrane was altered by binding to TMD. a previous study revealed that the functional fusion peptide of influenza virus had a kinked helix structure with a fixed angle in the micellar environment. the role played by TMD remains controversial except for the recognition that it anchors the fusion protein on the viral membrane and is involved in the late stages of the fusion process. the structure, orientation and interaction of the TMD of HA2 (X:31 strain) has been investigated. it was found that the highly helical TMD inserted into lipid bilayer nearly perpendicular to the membrane surface. they suggested that TMD had a role at the late stages of membrane fusion, including dehydration of water at the apposing membrane surfaces. the two peptide molecules form a loose complex in an antiparallel manner. TMD oligomers interspersed with FP molecules and modulation of lipid penetration of FP by interacting with TMD. an operational model of the fusion mechanism was constructed to shed light on the role of the two regions in HA2 represented by TMD and FP. the smaller KSV value, 10.6, compared with 14.9 at pH 7.4. the difference in the ratio of KSV in the two pH tested suggests that the insertion of the peptide is deeper at acidic than neutral pH. the flatness of the normalized intensity in the x = 1\u20130.3 range suggests a very tight TMD association. in the low x (0.3) regime a much smaller increase in the normalized intensity than the case of FP also corroborates the idea of tight self-binding for HA2 TMD molecules. labeled FP exhibits less self-quenching, indicative of a loose association for the peptide molecules. FP of HIV-1 gp41 causes no change in Rho-TMD dequenching or Rho-TMD of HA2. a higher propensity of self-association for TMD than FP is revealed by SDS-PAGE. a substantial increase in Rho-TMD FP at low pH upon addition of TMD suggests association of these two peptides. this suggests a dispersed FP subunit by complexing to TMD (i.e. reduced intra-subunit association), supporting the concept of an inner TMD core in the membrane. a negative control is provided by the self-quenching data on mixing of HA2 TMD and gp41 FP of HIV-1. no detectable change in the extent of quenching is observed compared with gp41 FP alone. the association between FP and FP in the complex is tighter at acidic pH than neutral pH. the association between FP and FP in the complex is tighter at acidic pH than neutral pH. FRET is larger when the donor-acceptor pair is labeled at different ends than FRET for the pair attached to the same end at either N- or C-terminus of the peptides. the pattern is the same at both pH 5.0 and 7.4 with larger FRET efficiency at acidic pH suggesting a stronger FP:TMD complex at the fusogenic pH. the findings may have a bearing on the role of TMD in promoting membrane hemifusion to complete fusion transition. FP inserts deeper into the membrane on association with TMD as probed by KSV values measured from NBD quenched by Co2+. flu HA2 resides mainly at or prior to the stage of helix hairpin formation [19]. helix content is an average of that of TMD and FP. helix accounted for 64% of the secondary structure. in lipid acyl chain orientation caused by FP and by TMD, FP has a greater membrane-perturbing effect than FP. the lesser membrane-perturbing effect of TMD than FP is compatible with the results of leakage experiments. higher-frequency band is assigned to non-hydrogen bonded lipid owing to dehydration. lower-frequency band is assigned to hydrated hydrogen bonded lipid. FP has a higher dehydration level than TMD. a twofold reduction in KSV in the vesicular dispersion compared with that in PB buffer shows that tryptophan side chains are embedded deep into the membrane. a twofold reduction in KSV, as well as decreased KSV on neutralization, upon incubating in PC:PG vesicles at pH 5.0 compared with that at pH 7.4 suggests that the TMD penetration is deeper at acidic pH. a much smaller increase in the normalized intensity than the case of FP also corroborates the idea of tight self-association for HA2 TMD molecules. this conclusion is further supported by the association between FP and FP described in the next section. a higher propensity of self-association for TMD than FP is revealed by SDS-PAGE. a higher propensity of self-association for TMD than FP is revealed by SDS-PAGE. a substantial increase in Rho-labeled FP at low pH upon addition of TMD suggests association of these two peptides. a negative control is provided by the self-quenching data on mixing of HA2 TMD and gp41 FP of HIV-1. a negative control is provided by the self-quenching data. no detectable change in the extent of quenching is observed compared with gp41 FP alone. a substantial Rho-TMD dequenching upon addition of FP is observed in the composition variation study, particularly at low x values. NBD and Rhodamine were labeled to the two peptides as the donor-acceptor pair. higher efficiency obtained for experimental curves than that calculated with random distribution of the two peptides in the lipid clearly indicates an interaction between them. the effect of adding TMD on KSV is the same for pH 5.0 and 7.4. the effect of adding TMD on KSV is the same for pH 5.0 and 7.4. the finding may have a bearing on the role of TMD in promoting membrane hemifusion to complete fusion transition. FP inserts deeper into the membrane on association with TMD as probed by KSV values measured from NBD quenched by Co2+. both FP and FP:TMD display dose-dependent leakage activity. the characteristic time of leakage is approximately 200 s for P/L = 0.05. helix accounted for 64% of the secondary structure. dehydration caused by TMD:FP is more pronounced than FP and TMD individually. this suggests a role of TMD and FP association in destabilizing the fusing membranes. higher-frequency band is assigned to the non-hydrogen bonded lipid. lower-frequency band is assigned to hydrated hydrogen bonded lipid. FP has a higher dehydration level than TMD. the association between the two kinds of molecules is further affirmed by the FRET results shown in Figure 3. the orientation between TMD and FP can be resolved by FRET experiments in which pyrene (donor) and NBD (acceptor) were labeled to TMD and FP at either N- or C-terminus. the result clearly showed an antiparallel TMD:FP association. the active distance for these fluorescence measurements is in the range of 10\u201350, which covers the loose interaction between FP and FP. it is possible that the TMD oligomers are surrounded by FP on the external surface or loosely associated FP molecules disperse around TMD homo-oligomers. it has been shown that the polar segment immediately following FP of HIV-1 gp41 is conformationally plastic. fusion activity is retained with the TMD segment replaced by TMD from other membrane proteins [8,9]. the loose interaction between FP and FP may foster clustering of neighboring FP and the associated TMD molecules, a necessary step for the fusion pore formation and enlargement. the two apposing membranes undergo dehydration, deformation and coalescence of the outer leaflets, causing hemifusion. the compact TMD homo-trimer approaches the loose FP aggregate and may be interspersed with FP molecules. however, the interaction is sufficiently strong to align FP with TMD to a certain extent and deepen FP penetration into the inner leaflet, further destabilizing the bilayer. target membrane by deepening FP membrane insertion. this latter effect is manifested by the requirement of TMD length for different phenotypes of fusion, hemifusion and full-fusion activity. the differential results on the effect of altering the basic residue in the middle of the HIV-1 TMD sequence may be related to the weak association between TMD and FP. more indirect evidence for tighter association of TMD than FP can be deduced from Figure 2C. more indirect evidence for tighter association of TMD than FP can be deduced from Figure 2B. ergistic membrane-perturbing effect of the TMD:FP complex suggests that association of the two HA2 domains promotes membrane merger mediated by the influenza hemagglutinin. in this work, fluorophotometry, such as FRET and Rhodamine self-quenching, was used to study the association between TMD and FP and membrane organization of TMD. refolding occurs when HA is exposed to acidic pH, pulling the apposing membranes close. in the membrane interior, FP and TMD move towards each other in antiparallel orientation. the loose interaction between FP and FP may foster clustering of neighboring FP and the associated TMD molecules. FP inserts into the target membrane following disengagement of HA1 from HA2. the inner leaflet of the bilayer is minimally disrupted by FP. FP self-assembly and tight self-association of TMD in the membrane. the role of TMD in the fusion process lies more in disrupting the inner leaflet of the fusing membranes than the specific interaction with FP is consistent with the inability of a GPI-anchored HA ectodomain to mediate full fusion [6]. the results presented in the work highlight the importance of the interaction of TMD with the membrane and TMD in complex with FP. peptides of TMD (GYKDWILWISFAISCFLLCVVLLGFIMWACQRG) and FP (GLFGAIAGFIENGWEGMIDGWYGFR) of HA2 were synthesized using a solid-phase method on a Rainin PS3 peptide synthesizer. labeling of TAMRA or NBD, purification and characterization were described previously. the fluorescence quenching study monitors the accessibility of Trp to the acrylamide quencher. a larger quenching constant of Trp by the aqueous phase quencher acrylamide indicates that the Trp is located closer to the membrane interface. 0.06 M of each peptide (labeled and unlabeled) was used. excitation and emission wavelengths of 530 and 578 nm were used. the normalized emission intensity Ix/x was plotted against 1 - x. the FRET between NBD and Rho was measured at 50\u00b0C by adding Rho-TMD to NBD-FP/DMPC/DMPG 0.06:150:150 M. the ratios of [Rho-TMD]/[NBD-FP] were 0.3, 0.6, 1, 1.5, 2 and 2.5. Idonor+acceptor and Idonor are the intensities of pyrene-TMD/NBD-FP mixture and pyrene-TMD only, respectively. a large quenching constant by the aqueous cation reflects closer proximity of NBD tag to the membrane interface. the fluorescence was recorded at ambient temperature with excitation and emission wavelengths of 270 and 490 nm, respectively. the percentage leakage of Tb3+ was calculated as follows: leakage (%) = [(Ft - F0)/(Fmax - F0)] 100. lysoPC was mixed with 10 l Laemmli buffer, except that in lane 3, 5 l of each of the TMD and FP were mixed before added to 20 l Laemmli buffer. FP exhibits less tendency than TMD to form oligomers in either neutral or acidic buffer, as shown in lanes 1 and 2. at a spectral resolution of 2 cm-1, the data were smoothed with triangular apodization and the absorption peaks were analyzed using the Peakfit program to obtain the secondary structure components. the infrared linear dichroic ratio is defined by RATR = A/A [34,35], where A and A are the absorbances at parallel and perpendicular polarizations of the incident infrared light. the data were analyzed using the Stern-Volmer equation [27]: F0/F = 1 + KSV[Q] where F0 is the fluorescence intensity at any given quencher concentration, whereas KSV represents the apparent Stern-Volmer quenching constant, obtained from the slope of the plot of F0/F versus [Q] to DMPC:DMPG (30/30 M) vesicles at pH 5.0 or 7.4, the Rho-labeled TMD (or FP) was added followed by adding the unlabeled FP (or TMD) we used 0.06 M of each peptide and the parameters were the same as those used in the Rho composition experiments described above. the measurements of FRET from Pyrene to NBD were recorded to investigate the alignment between TMD and FP peptides. the final concentration of each peptide was 0.06 M. peptide was 0.06 M. an incremental amount of CoCl2 stock solution (0.1 M) was then injected into the cuvette to give final Co2+ concentration in the range 0.04\u20132.0 mM. corrections were made to the observed fluorescence intensities. slit bandwidths of excitation and emission were 5 and 2.5 nm respectively. an incremental amount of acrylamide stock solution (1 M) was added to the 1 M TMD peptide solutions (in PB buffer or in DMPC:DMPG 50:50 M) the normalized emission intensity Ix/x was plotted against 1 - x [28]. intra-trimeric interaction is detected for x values near 1. the probability of finding a pair of labeled peptides is slim. the intensity of donor (NBD-FP) without acceptor (Rho-TMD) was taken as 100%: Efficiency (%) = Idonor+acceptor/Idonor 100. Idonor+acceptor and Idonor are the intensities of pyrene-TMD/NBD-FP mixture and pyrene-TMD-FP only. Co2+ quenched NBD fluorescence can be quenched by divalent cobalt ions [30] via a collisional quenching mechanism. a large quenching constant by the aqueous cation reflects a closer proximity of NBD tag to the membrane interface. the percentage leakage of Tb3+ was calculated as follows: leakage (%) = [(Ft - F0)/(Fmax - F0)] 100. the percentage leakage of Tb3+ was calculated as follows. electrophoresis was conducted at 20 mA constant current for 90 min. FP exhibits less tendency than TMD to form oligomers in SDS in either neutral or acidic buffer. FP exhibits less tendency to form oligomers in either neutral or acidic buffer. A and A are the absorbances at parallel and perpendicular polarizations of the incident infrared light, respectively. the tilt angles, relative to the membrane director, were calculated from equations described in Additional file 1.
