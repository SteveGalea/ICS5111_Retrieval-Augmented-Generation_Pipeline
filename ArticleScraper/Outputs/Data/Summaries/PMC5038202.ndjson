{"summary": "estimated worldwide incidence of severe pneumonia in children less than 5 years of age is 50\u201380 per 1,000 person-years. mortality is 1.0\u20135.5 per 1,000 person-years (3\u20135). severe pneumonia produces corresponding clinical symptoms, such as respiratory failure, heart failure, toxic encephalopathy and intestinal paralysis. patients were hospitalized due to fever, cough, asthma, dry and wet rales could be heard in lung auscultation. a chest X-ray showed thickened lung markings with visible punctate and flake-like shadows. there was one case of concurrent toxic encephalopathy, 1 case of gastrointestinal bleeding, and 1 case of toxic intestinal paralysis. X-ray examination showed thickened lung markings, and flake-like shadows, and abdominal palpation showed enlarged liver and spleen. Respiratory or circulatory functions were at different levels of exhaustion. treatment After admission, comprehensive emergency treatment measures were taken. conditions such as fever, cough, extent of choked asthma, the presence or absence of breathing, faster heart rate, pulmonary rales, orthopnea, nose flap, three depression signs and cyanosis were assessed. a medical history was carried out to determine whether the children patients had a history of recurrent respiratory tract infection. children patients with type I pneumonia with respiratory failure showed signs of dysphoria, quickening heart rate, worsening asthma, or enlarged liver in a short period of time, indicating heart failure. close observation of consciousness, pupil changes and muscle tension was carried out, and if manifestations of intracranial pressure such as drowsiness, convulsions, irregular breathing and increased muscle tension appeared, immediate rescue steps were taken. tracheal intubation ventilator was employed to improve the cure rate. oxygen mask inhalation method is comfortable and without stimulation. patients were placed in a horizontal position, with neck raised high, in order to unblocked airways. aerosol inhalation was conducted every 4 or 6 h, with sputum suction ensuing. hypocalcemia may produce laryngospasm and tongue tenesmus. hypocalcemia may produce laryngospasm and tongue tenesmus. application of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) may be considered a priority. for severe pneumonia, NCPAP can support cardiopulmonary function. early application can improve timely oxygenation, stabilize disease, prevent disease progression. phosphodiesterase III (PDE-III) inhibitor milrinone, a second generation of phosphodiesterase III (PDE-III) inhibitor, was administered to maintain heart function. milrinone strengthens myocardial contractility, increases cardiac output, exerts direct relaxation on vascular smooth muscle, dilates blood vessels and reduces cardiac preload and afterload. ion, dysphoria, coma, increased muscle tension, irregular breathing, and increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure are important in order to ease cerebral edema. the head was raised 15\u201330\u00b0 to facilitate the intracranial venous return. a dental pad was placed between the upper and lower teeth to prevent tongue bite. a dental pad was placed between the upper and lower teeth to prevent tongue bite. phenobarbital and diazepam were administered to control fear. children were guarded by specially-assigned persons to prevent scratches. intravenous injection of immune globulin is considered a safe and effective method for the treatment of children with severe pneumonia. it can rapidly improve immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in the patient's blood; enhance the body's resistance to infection and immune function. high-dose intravenous injection can increase the IgG concentration 3- to 6-fold in circulating blood compared to a normal person. condition assessment and diagnosis a detailed inquiry of the medical history was carried out to determine whether the children patients had a history of recurrent respiratory tract infection. conditions such as fever, cough, extent of choked asthma, the presence or absence of breathing, faster heart rate, pulmonary rales, orthopnea, nose flap, three depression signs and cyanosis. drugs, cardiac drugs and other medications were administered to patients at the appropriate dosage, the appropriate time and in an accurate manner. if children showed signs of dysphoria, quickening heart rate, worsening asthma, or enlarged liver in a short period of time, indicating heart failure, then the infusion rate was reduced. emergency treatment and therapy for respiratory failure Type I respiratory failure refers to the presence of hypoxemia and absence of hypercapnia. tracheal intubation ventilator was employed to improve the cure rate. tracheal intubation ventilator was used to clear respiratory secretions. 20,000 units of gentamic gentamic gentamic gentamic gentamic gentamic gentamic gentamic gentamic gentamic gentamic gentamic gentamic gentamic gentamic gentamic gentamic gentamic aerosol inhalation was conducted every 4 or 6 h, with sputum suction ensuing. hypocalcemia may produce laryngospasm and tongue tenesmus. hypocalcemia may produce laryngospasm and tongue tenesmus. halation significantly shortened the time of the disappearance of all the clinical signs. there was no bleeding and other adverse reactions involved in the clinical treatment process. the use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) may be considered a priority. s of endotracheal intubation Short-term intubation ventilator was used when there was: i) Respiratory arrest or respiratory and cardiac arrest; ii) blood PaCO2 >60 mmHg, in order to accelerate the discharge of PaCO2 and reduce respiratory acidosis. phosphodiesterase III (PDE-III) inhibitor acts on the receptor accessory pathway, was administered to maintain heart function. children show signs of exhaustion, dysphoria, coma, increased muscle tension, irregular breathing, and increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure. the head was raised 15\u201330\u00b0 to facilitate the intracranial venous return, leading to acorresponding reduction in intracranial pressure. fright-checking agent forcibly press the child's body, in order not to cause fractures. a hot water bag was placed on the abdomen, to facilitate venting. anal venting was also used and children became quiet after venting. anti-infective therapy was carried out as much as possible. intravenous injection of immune globulin is considered a safe and effective method for the treatment of children with severe pneumonia. it can rapidly improve immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in the patient's blood; enhance the body's resistance to infection and immune function. high-dose intravenous injection can increase the IgG concentration 3- to 6-fold in circulating blood compared to a normal person. condition assessment and diagnosis A detailed inquiry of the medical history was carried out to determine whether the children patients had a history of recurrent respiratory tract infection. conditions such as fever, cough, extent of choked asthma, the presence or absence of breathing, faster heart rate, pulmonary rales, orthopnea, nose flap, three depression signs and cyanosis were also assessed. side effects of various drugs were observed. if children patients showed signs of dysphoria, quickening heart rate, worsening asthma, or enlarged liver in a short period of time, indicating heart failure, then the infusion rate was reduced. tracheal intubation ventilator was employed to improve the cure rate. oxygen mask inhalation method is comfortable and without stimulation. patients with severe heart failure and wheezing were placed in a horizontal position. 20,000 units of gentamicin, 2\u20133 mg of -chymotrypsin, 1\u20132 mg of dexamethasone, and 20 ml of saline were used. hypocalcemia may produce laryngospasm and tongue tenesmus, which causes obstruction and sudden suffocation. ambroxol and low-dose heparin combined with aerosol inhalation significantly shortened the time of the disappearance of all the clinical signs. there was no bleeding and other adverse reactions involved in the clinical treatment process. the use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) may be considered a priority. ventilator pneumonia was used when there was: i) Respiratory arrest or respiratory and cardiac arrest; ii) sputum congestion, dyspnea, serious cyanosis; iii) blood PaCO2 >60 mmHg, in order to accelerate the discharge of PaCO2 and reduce respiratory acidosis. children show signs of exhaustion, dysphoria, coma, increased muscle tension, irregular breathing, and increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure. the head was raised 15\u201330\u00b0 to facilitate the intracranial venous return, leading to acorresponding reduction in intracranial pressure. sions and exacerbating cerebral hypoxia and brain edema, thereby aggravating intracranial pressure. treatment and care were performed simultaneously, as much as possible, and operating and any negative stimuli were reduced to prevent convulsions. intravenous injection of immune globulin is considered a safe and effective method for the treatment of children with severe pneumonia. it can rapidly improve immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in the patient's blood; enhance the body's resistance to infection and immune function. high-dose intravenous injection can increase the concentration 3- to 6-fold in circulating blood compared to a normal person. prevention and treatment of diseases, such as that children usually need to do exercise, enhance nutrition, bask more in sunshine and engage in outdoor activities, ensure adequate sleep, pay attention to personal health, and get vaccinated."}
