{"summary": "sequence data is being generated daily by sequencing centres and individual laboratories. prediction and annotation of genes is the first and most critical step in understanding genome components of viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes. but the development of tools that interpret sequence data still lag in pace of sequence data production. universal gene prediction programs are available for public use. species-specific gene prediction programs have been developed to conduct the gene calling for specific viral genomes. RNA editing In many RNA viruses, such as measles virus, mumps virus and parainfluenza virus, the P gene is a polycistronic gene from which multiple proteins can be produced. the edited mRNA, in which one or more non-templated G residues are inserted, will be translated into the V or D protein. two different proteins can be produced from the first large gene by a mechanism known as stop codon leakage (also known as stop codon read-through) for the majority of mRNA, translation will terminate when the ribosome reaches the first stop codon (UGA) an Arg residue, however, will be incorporated into the protein product at the stop codon position (UGA) for a portion of mRNA. the VIGOR interface was implemented in Perl CGI, PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript. users can submit the FASTA or multi-FASTA format genomic sequences by pasting them into the input sequence area or uploading a local sequence file. a URL for the result page will be displayed immediately on submitting data for prediction. hPIV-3, bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (bPIV-3) and sendai virus, the faithful transcript of the P gene will guide synthesis of the P protein. the edited mRNA, in which one or more non-templated G residues are added, will be translated into the V or D protein. the stop codon read-through site region is selected by aligning the deduced amino acid sequence to the reference protein in database. the leakage site is finalized by the codon (UGA) and the conserved motif (Arg-Leu) next to the read-through site (9). the start codon of C protein gene is downstream the start codon of P protein gene, but the reading frame of C protein gene is different. the time needed to complete the gene predictions depends on the size of data submitted by the user. users can periodically refresh the result page or wait for notification e-mail, if it is provided. the following two types of predictions will be counted as partial agreements. stop codon and the reading frame are the same as these in GenBank record. for some genes, an internal stop codon is detected and the truncated protein sequence is shorter than 95% of its reference sequence length. YFV and JEV are single-stranded, positive sense RNA viruses and belong to viral family Flaviviridae. the genome sizes of these viruses are 11 kb and only a single long polyprotein is encoded in these genomes. this long polyprotein will be co- and post-translationally processed into 10 to 11 mature peptides by host signal peptidases. norovirus is responsible for at least 23 million cases of foodborne illness every year in the u.s. every year. the viruses enclose a non-segmented, positive single-stranded RNA genome of 7.7 kb with three genes encoded (16). the second and third genes encode viral structure proteins named VP1 and VP2. the first large ORF encodes a non-structural protein that will be digested into six mature peptides by the viral two ORFs (M2-1 and M2-2) are encoded in the M2 gene region with different reading frames (17,18) 243 genes were detected by VIGOR, the same number of genes were annotated in GenBank. in the mumps virus genome, one extra small hydrophobic protein is encoded between the fusion gene and the HN gene. two non-templated G residues are inserted into the mature transcript that is going to be translated into the P protein, and the mRNA without editing encodes the V protein (6). VIGOR detected 15 new genes validated by comparing them with other viral proteins. in the first large gene of VEEV and some alphaviruses, a stop codon (UGA) is present downstream of the coding sequence of mature peptide nsP3. translational read-through occurs at this stop codon, an arginine or another residue is incorporated at this position. a larger non-structural protein is synthesized because of the translational read-through and one additional mature peptide (nsP4) is translated. hPIV-2 and hPIV-4 belong to the rubulavirus genus. bPIV-3, bPIV-3 and Sendai virus constitute the respirovirus genus. the P gene encodes at least four proteins (P, D, C and V) hPIV-2 and hPIV-4 are members of the rubulavirus genus. the genome size of hPIV-4 is 17.7 kb, 2 kb longer than other parainfluenza virus genomes. 62 of the 311 genes predicted by VIGOR were not annotated in GenBank. the polyproteins were BLASTed against the mature peptide database. conserved signature residues and alignment are used to find the exact cleavage sites. 46 complete genomes of rubella virus retrieved from GenBank were tested by VIGOR. VIGOR picked the longer version as the reference sequence to define the start codon. all of these 33 new genes were the M2-2 and M1-2 genes. each of the different virus-specific VIGOR programs has also been tested with the viral genomic sequences generated by JCVI. the three mature peptides (C, PrM/M and E) from the N-terminus of the polyprotein are structural proteins. the other seven or eight mature peptides from the C-terminus are non-structural proteins. one hundred seventy complete genomes of both YFV and JEV were tested by VIGOR. only a small number of genomes of these two viruses have their mature peptides annotated in GenBank. the first large ORF encodes a non-structural protein that will be digested into six mature peptides by the viral 3C-like protease (3CLpro) the mature peptides p48, NTPase, p22, VPg, 3CLpro and RdRp are ordered from N- to C-terminus (16). only a small number of norovirus genomes have their mature peptides annotated in GenBank. VIGOR detected internal stop codons in the coding regions of four genes. the truncated proteins were shorter than 95% of the reference protein length. the stop codons in GenBank of these genes are the same as those predicted by VIGOR. a total of 101 complete genomes of measles and mump viruses were downloaded from NCBI. VIGOR predicted 774 genes, whereas GenBank record indicates 759 genes in these genomes. most of them are the C protein gene, which overlaps with P protein gene but in a different reading frame. the mature peptide cleavage sites are identified based on the alignment between the polyprotein and the homologs in the mature peptide database. the conserved signature sequences next to the cleavage sites are used to identify the exact position of the cleavage. only a small number of genomes of these two viruses have the mature peptides annotated in GenBank. the P gene gives rise to a maximum of six different proteins by means of RNA editing, overlapping frames and ribosomal shunting. the faithful transcript encodes the P protein. four additional proteins (C\u2019, C, Y1 and Y2) are also encoded in the polycistronic P gene by a process known as ribosomal shunting (12,23) the genome size of hPIV-4 is 17.7 kb, 2 kb longer than other parainfluenza virus genomes. 62 of the 311 genes predicted by VIGOR were not annotated in GenBank records. a total of 46 complete genomes of rubella virus retrieved from GenBank were tested by VIGOR. all the 92 genes annotated in GenBank were detected by VIGOR, but the start codon of one gene was different. peptide sequences predicted by VIGOR were also validated by the GenBank annotations. VIGOR is able to accurately define the start and stop codons of genes in the designated viral genomes. it can also precisely identify the complex gene features like RNA editing, stop codon read-through, alternative splicing and alternative translation initiation."}
