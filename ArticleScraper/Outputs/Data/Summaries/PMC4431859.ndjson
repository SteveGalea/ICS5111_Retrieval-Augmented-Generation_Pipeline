{"summary": "bioaerosols may include intact microorganisms and/or parts or products of organisms. airborne pathogens are readily transmitted by airflow and can cause a variety of diseases, including allergic rhinitis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), influenza. carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been applied to the control of water quality and IAQ. single-walled CNTs are more toxic to bacteria than multi-walled CNTs. inorganic nanoparticles can exert adverse effects on health. a Euscaphis japonica extract was used to produce natural-product nanoparticles that were deposited onto air filters. extracts of E. japonica are an ingredient in traditional herbal medicines used primarily to treat inflammation. pulverized E. japonica was extracted with methanol (106,009; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and sonicated for 3 days. the extracts were passed through nonfluorescent cotton filters. after concentration, the extract was lyophilized for 24 h and the resulting extract powder was stored at 5\u00b0C. range particle spectrometer (WPS-100XP; MSP Co., Minneapolis, MN, USA) calibrated to a size range of 10\u201310,000 nm. the fabricated nanoparticles were continuously deposited onto polyurethane resin fiber filters (Clean & Science Co., Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea) droplets containing test bacteria were sprayed using a six-jet nebulizer. bacterial aerosols were introduced onto the surface of the filter medium. particle size and concentration of bacterial aerosols were measured with an aerodynamic particle sizer. ABAF is the active proportion of bacteria from the control filter. ABAF is the active proportion of bacteria from the antimicrobial filter. ABAF is the active proportion of bacteria from the filter. the gradient mode was as follows: 0\u20135 min, initial mobile phase solvent A/B (90:10, v/v); 5\u201340 min, linear gradient 30:70; 40\u201350 min, isocratic mode 30:70. the LC pump solvent flow rate was 150 mL/min. the sample injection volume was 5 L. cells (1 104 cells/well) were plated in 96well plates, incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. at the end of the incubation, 10 L of EZ-Cytox solution was added to the well. the absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a Synergy HT Multi-microplate reader. 20 milliliters of the above E. japonica solution was poured into a one-jet Collison nebulizer (BGI Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) the resulting E. japonica aerosol was passed through an activated carbon absorber, mixed with 9 L/min of clean and dry air, and passed through a thermal glass quartz tube heater to remove methanol. test bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus were used as the test bacteria in this study. the bacteria are widely used in bioaerosol research [57] and are common in indoor environments and on human skin [58,59] the bacterial aerosols were deposited onto the filters for 3 min. after a contact time of 10 min, the filters were placed in 5 mL (V extraction) of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.01% Tween 80. the resulting bacterial suspension was serially diluted onto plates of nutrient agar. chemical analysis of the E. japonica extract was performed using an HPLC-ESI/MS device. the mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. in vitro cytotoxicity of E. japonica nanoparticles A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cancer cells and HEL 299 human lung fibroblasts was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. the cells were maintained in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. the distribution is best represented by a monomodal curve with a peak diameter of 75.16 nm, a geometric mean diameter (GMD) of 75.82 nm, and geometric standard deviation (GMD) of 1.217. more than 98% of particles with diameters less than 43 nm and greater than 277 nm were deposited onto the control filter. d from 590 to 1150 g/cm2 filter correspond to deposition times of 3, 6, and 9 min respectively. pressure drop across filter increased linearly from 1.1 to 13.4 mmH2O. filtration efficiencies were tested using S. epidermidis and M. luteus aerosols. flat panel-type filters were used in these tests to estimate effects of natural-product nanoparticles. the pressure drop through the antimicrobial air filters is shown as a function of particle deposition conditions. Error bars indicate standard deviations (n = 3). micrococcus strains have been shown to exhibit greater resistance to novobiocin than Staphylococcus strains. chromatogram detected at 280 nm contains three major peaks (1\u20133) with relative peak areas of 16.6, 5.8, and 3.2%, respectively. kaempferol-3-O-glucoside was identified as kaempferol-3-O-glucoside. flavonoids quercetin-3-O-glucuronide and kaempferol-3-O-glucoside exhibited antibacterial activity by reducing the fluidity of the inner and outer layers of bacterial membranes. cytotoxicity tests were conducted using EZ-Cytox cell viability assay kits. the required E. japonica concentrations were 137 and 256 g/mL, >57% higher than those of the SNC. the inhibitory effects of E. japonica and a soluble nickel compound (SNC) on A549 cancer and HEL 299 cells. in vitro cytotoxicity and disk diffusion tests showed that E. japonica nanoparticles were less toxic and had stronger antimicrobial activity on some bacterial strains than the SNC, which is classified as a human carcinogen. we are considering a field experiment of our filters in a future study. this study provides valuable information for the development of an environmentally friendly bioaerosol control system."}
