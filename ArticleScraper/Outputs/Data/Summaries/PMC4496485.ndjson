{"summary": "signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) are a family of transcription factors that play crucial roles in regulating a number of diverse biological functions. STATs are activated by the signals from cytokine and growth factor receptors in the plasma membrane and regulate gene transcription. each STAT family protein responds to a defined set of cytokines. noncanonical STAT Activation In the noncanonical model, unphosphorylated STATs are consistently found as a result of constant nuclear import and export. STAT3 regulates cell-cycle progression and apoptosis, plays a key role in oncogenesis and is aberrantly expressed in cancer cells [16]. the structure of STAT3 is similar to the other STAT family members. the structure of STAT3 is similar to the other STAT family members. IL-21, IL-22, IL-27, IFN-, TNF-, LIGHT, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (MIP-1), CCL-5/RANTES, stem cell factor (SCF) and oncostatin M (OSM) also activate STAT3, including epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs), hepatocyte growth factor receptors (FGFRs), platelet-derived growth factor receptors ation has been considered to be a secondary event after Tyr705 phosphorylation. however, recent evidence suggests that ser727 phosphorylation on STAT3 is not necessarily a secondary event after Tyr705 phosphorylation. STAT3 phosphorylation at serine 727 promotes maximal transcriptional activation of a subset of target genes. ers recognize an 8- to 10-base pair inverted repeat DNA element with a consensus sequence of 5-TT(N)AA-3. nonphosphorylated STAT3 monomers are also capable of dimerization and induction of transcription through binding to NFkappaB [48, 50]. a range of endogenous protein regulators tightly control the receptor-induced STAT3 activation. STAT3 signals either by direct binding and inhibition of JAKs, or by binding signalling proteins and targeting them for proteasomal degradation. STAT3 is a signaling mediator of IL-6 and IL-10 family members and other cytokines such as leptin and G-CSF. a number of DNA and RNA viruses are known to regulate STAT3 activation. a number of viral proteins interact with STAT3 resulting in the phosphorylation activation. hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein [69], saimiri transforming protein (STP) oncogene of Herpesvirus saimiri subgroup A strain 11 (STP-A11) [73] and Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) [74] promote STAT3 phosphorylation. human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation but rapidly promotes nuclear localization of unphosphorylated STAT3 to the nucleus. HCV promotes STAT3 ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome. STAT3 regulates proliferation, survival, and differentiation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. STAT3 interacts with hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF-3) and activates hepatitis B virus (HBV) gene expression. there is a STAT3 binding site within the core domain of hepatitis B virus enhancer 1. IL-6 and epidermal growth factor stimulate the interaction of HBV enhancer 1 DNA-STAT3 protein resulting in overall stimulation of HBV enhancer 1 function. STAT3 activation induces the antiapoptotic protein survivin. both STAT3 and surviving are essential for VZV replication. mumps virus V protein functions as a ubiquitin ligase that targets STAT3 for degradation and STAT3 evasion. STAT3 is constitutively phosphorylated in neoplastic cells. many viruses exploit the oncogenic effects of phosphorylated STAT3. STAT3 plays a central role in the pathogenesis of viral infections. antiapoptotic protein survivin plays a major role in the pathogenesis of lytic as well as tumorigenic herpesviruses. STAT3 activation is essential for the skin infections caused by VZV which is necessary for viral transmission and persistence in the human population. STAT3 is also known to promote host defense against virus infections. the seemingly contradictory role of STAT3 in viral infections raises a number of interesting questions. the author declares that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper."}
