{"summary": "pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PRRs) are activated upon binding to conserved molecular structures, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) the fact that most PAMPs are expressed only by microbes and not by host cells allows the innate immune system to respond specifically to non-self. cGAS binds cytosolic DNA and catalyzes the synthesis of the second messenger cGAMP. cGAS and IFI16 signal through the adaptor protein STING. TBK1 and IRF3 recruitment to STING induces the phosphorylation and activation of IRF3. receptors have been proposed to be important for cytosolic DNA recognition, including absent in melanoma (AIM2), gamma-interferon-inducible protein (IFI16) and cyclic GMP\u2013AMP synthase (cGAS)1, 2. the activated inflammasome cleaves the proforms of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-18 to generate bioactive cytokines. cGAS-produced 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP is a highly potent stimulator of both murine and human STING. 22 cGAMP binds in a pocket at the interface of the two STING protomers, resulting in translocation of STING from the ER compartment to perinuclear autophagy-like vesicles. IFI16 binds the DNA via two HIN domains, allowing the formation of filamentous oligomers on the DNA molecule. a small pool of IFI16 is cytoplasmic and has been demonstrated to co-localize with herpes simplex virus. cGAS is essential for control of infections with HSV-1 (intravenous infection), murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (intraperitoneal infection), and vaccinia virus (intranasal infection) this is believed to be dependent on induction of type I IFN. 34 STING/ mice showed elevated mortality rate after intravenous HSV-1 infection compared with wild-type mice. viral genomic DNA is released into the cytosol upon infection. this is preceded by ubiquitination of capsid associated factors. other studies suggest that virus-induced cellular stress triggers release of mitochondrial DNA into the cytosol, which in turn activates the cGAS-STING pathway. the RNA:DNA intermediate has been reported to be detected by TLR9 and cGAS. 41 the single-stranded DNA species and the final double-stranded DNA products also have the potential to stimulate type I IFN expression. 42 Viral ssDNA molecules named \u2018strong-stop ()-strand DNA\u2019 are present in the cytosol upon HIV-1 infection. two papers by bridgeman et al. and Gentili et al.,46, 47 detected cGAMP in Vaccinia virus and murine CMV virions. cGAMP-containing virus particles stimulated cGAS/ STING+/+ cell lines to produce type I IFN. at present it is not known whether cGAMP is actively packed into the viral particles as an antiviral strategy. the infected cell protein (ICP)0 protein encoded by HSV-1 possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity through the RING finger domain. the ubiquitination activity and an active proteasomal pathway was reported to be crucial for the establishment of lytic infection in HSV-1 infected cells. pUL83 is a tegument protein of human HCMV. pUL83 is the most abundant protein in the HCMV particle. the protein localizes to the nucleus early during infection. ORF52 was reported to be a DNA-binding protein. the ability to sequester stimulatory DNA was shown to be important. cGAS binding to DNA occurring with higher affinity than DNA binding by ORF52. study aims to identify novel KSHV-encoded proteins targeting DNA sensing pathways. the viral IRF1 interacted directly with STING at a time point after STING trafficking from the ER. this interaction impedes the binding of TBK1 to STING, thus inhibiting phosphorylation and activation of STING. the family of herpesviruses has been reported to evade the DNA sensing machinery. we previously identified a conserved herpesvirus deubiquitinase to inhibit STING-dependent DNA signaling in macrophages. this occurred upstream of DNA release into the cytosol, thus suggesting the deubiquitinase to prevent the viral DNA to become accessible for DNA sensors. retroviruses recruit cytosolic host proteins to the viral capsid to protect against sensing of replication intermediates by cytosolic nucleic acid sensors. pUL83 is the most abundant protein in the HCMV particle and the protein localizes to the nucleus early during infection. cGAS is well established to be a DNA sensor, and unlike the case for IFI16, there is mechanistic understanding of how cGAS links to STING-dependent signaling. ORF52 is like HCMV pUL83 a tegument protein, but contrary to the nuclear localization of pUL83, ORF52 is only found in the cytosol and in perinuclear regions. a study aims to identify novel KSHV-encoded proteins targeting DNA sensing pathways. the viral IRF1 (vIRF1) interacted directly with STING. this interaction impedes the binding of TBK1 to STING. vIRF1 was found to be able to inhibit type I IFN production. ORF45 is phosphorylated on two serine residues in a TBK1-dependent manner. IRF7 remains non-phosphorylated and thus inactive. this mechanism does not affect IRF3 activation but leads to decreased type I IFN expression. the LXCXE motif was reported to inhibit STING and inhibit downstream signaling. knock out of E1A and E7 increased the potential to mount type I IFN responses to dsDNA in these cell lines. the HIV-1 genome is recognized by cGAS in cases with non-intact capsids. ssDNA, Y-form DNA, RNA:DNA hybrids and dsDNA are recognized by cGAS as well as by IFI16. it is thus conceivable that retroviruses have evolved different mechanisms for inhibition of the DNA sensing pathway. ssRNA genomes have been reported to modulate STING and downstream signaling. first, RIG-I has been shown to interact with STING in a manner dependent on MAVS following activation by positive ssRNA viruses. second, Schoggins et al.33 found lower basal expression of IFN-stimulated genes in cGAS/ mice. the protease NS2B3 from dengue virus is another STING targeting protein, with specific affinity for the human form of STING. the virus is enveloped with a non-segmented positive sense ssRNA genome, which normally induces low type I IFN levels. the virus replication was shown to be more efficient in STING-depleted cells. microbes with DNA genomes have evolved mechanisms to evade sensing. this is probably of central importance for the ability of DNA viruses to establish infection. further knowledge on the cellular targets and mechanisms of action of viral strategies will lead to better understanding of the pathogenesis of viral diseases."}
