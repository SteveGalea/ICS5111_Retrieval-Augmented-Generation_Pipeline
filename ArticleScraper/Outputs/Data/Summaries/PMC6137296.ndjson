{"summary": "canine cyclosporiasis and cystoisosporiasis are frequently associated with immunocompromised patients worldwide. cyclospora cayetanensis is considered an important pathogen in humans and vertebrates since human cyclosporiasis was first identified in diarrheal patients from Papua new Guinea [2]. the genus Cyclospora comprises obligate intracellular coccidian protozoa that reside in the intestinal epithe a 3-month-old female maltese puppy was hospitalized with mild to moderate symptoms of repetitive diarrhea, dehydration, and reduced appetite in a local veterinary clinic. blood chemistry and hematology profile were analyzed using the Fuji DRI-CHEM NX500 automated clinical chemistry analyzer. the microscopic image was acquired and analyzed by LAS V4.1 software (Leica Microsystems, Frankfurt, German) the microscopic image was acquired and analyzed by LAS V4.1 software (Leica Microsystems, Frankfurt, german). rast microscopy showed that the fecal smears were negative for spirochetes. all oocysts were 20 to 22 m in diameter, with an oval structure. the genus of the pathogen could not be confirmed based on microscopic morphology. multiplex real-time PCR showed a positive reaction only for C. cayetanensis. the threshold cycle value of C. cayetanensis was as high as 28.8. sequence analysis was performed as described previously. the phylogenetic tree was analyzed using the neighbor joining method. the phylogenetic tree was deposited in the Genbank at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. canine cystoisosporiasis has not been documented in Korea to date. this is the first phylogenetic analysis of C. ohioensis isolates confirmed in a veterinary clinic in Korea. previous studies have reported high prevalence of canine cystoisosporiasis. ITS1 and 18S rRNA genes of Cystoisospora spp. were used for phylogenetic analysis. for diagnostic purposes, detection by the 18S rRNA gene has limitations in differentiating C. ohioensis from C. ohioensis. ciprofloxacin or nitazoxanide was not prescribed in this case. clavamox and metronidazole can be considered as an alternative treatment for canine cyclosporiasis."}
