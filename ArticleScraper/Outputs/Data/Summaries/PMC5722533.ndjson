{"summary": "a rapid, sensitive, specific and multi-target assay for detecting major and common respiratory viruses is desirable. a rapid and accurate diagnosis is important for adopting early antiviral treatment, preventing nosocomial spread, decreasing stay duration and reducing patient management costs. molecular diagnostic assays have been demonstrated to have superior sensitivity to conventional assays and are now being accepted as the new gold standard. one-step multiplex reverse transcription-PCR(RT-PCR) and Luminex xMAP technology were used to develop a respiratory multiplex LiquiChip assay (rMLA) for the detection of 6 common respiratory viruses in Jiaxing, including influenza virus type A (FluA) and B (FluB), para-influenza virus type 3 (PIV-3), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus. determined to be 7, 10, 6, 22, 8, 11 and 9, 12, 8, 114, 78, 15 copies per l for fluA, fluB, PIV-3, RSV, MPV, and MERS-CoV. both assays were able to detect all target viruses and no cross signals were observed. PC-Mix1 and PC-Mix2 were used to analyze multi-target detection capacity for co-infection samples briefly. biotin-labelled RT-PCR products of samples or controls were identified by bead-coupled capture probes (z axis) and showed by the MFI values (y axis) MLA for the two targets were lower than the multiplex real-time RT-PCR assayc. Target Lab Diagnosisb rMLA assay Real-time RT-PCR assayc. rMLA and multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay were tested in duplicate. same positive specimen for each target was tested for ten times in three months. the rMLA took at least 3 h (190 min) to test one plate if two panels of the assay were availably setup in one 96-well plate. the rMLA took at least 3 h (190 min) to test one plate. the rMLA took at least 3 h (190 min) to test one plate. Luminex analysis (hybridization &.Reading data) $0.94 Luminex analysis (hybridization &.Reading data) 60 min 90 min Capture probes (6 targets) &. hybridizatio reagents $5.47 $1,050.00 Total 190 min 260 min $13.44 $2,580.00 aBased on the purchase prices in china in 2015. the total reagent cost for a Luminex xMAP analysis was $3. the detection limits of the two assays were determined to be 7, 10, 6, 22, 8, 11 and 9, 12, 8, 114, 78, 15 copies per l for fluA, FluB, PIV-3, RSV, MPV, and MERS-CoV respectively. the analytical sensitivities of the rMLA and multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay developed in this study were assessed by testing in duplicate 10-fold serial dilutions of positive standards. the results showed that the rMLA had satisfying analytical specificities and multiplex detection capacity for target viruses. the rMLA assay has good diagnostic sensitivities for fluA (97.10%, n = 293), FluB (94.59%, n = 157), PIV3 (98). 68%, n = 133), RSV (94.87%, n = 74) and MPV (9.92%, n = 82), approximate to the multiplex real-time RT-PCR. both detection data were re-analyzed by SPSS. bLaboratory diagnostic methods used previously, adopting in-house monoplex real-time RT-PCR. cRepresenting the two-panel multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay. the CVs of intra-assay obtained by testing ten positive specimens in duplicate for each target were fluA 6.21%, fluB 5.20%, PIV3 8.76%, RSV 7.68%, MERS-CoV 6.41% for the rMLA, and fluA 7.04%, fluB 7.52%, PIV3 9.83%, RSV 8.53%, MPV 8.40%, MERS-CoV 6.06% for the real-time RT-PCR analysis 90 min 90 min $3.31 $318.00 TaKaRa One Step RT-PCR reagents $0.78 Primers (biotin-forward and reverse, 3 targets) $2.34 First RT-PCR Panel 2 (25 l) and analysis 90 min $318.00 Second RT-PCR Panel 2 (25 l) and analysis 90 min $318.00 Total 130 min 440 min $12.88 $2,472.00 rMLA RNA extraction 40 min 80 min $6.25 $1, rMLA need at least 6 h (350 min) and $2,580 ($13.44/reaction) the overall turnaround time of the rMLA assay could be shorten to 4.5 h (260 min) if more specimens needed to be tested within an 8-h clinical shift, the rMLA can still be setup by one technician to run another plate with another ordinary thermocycler. multiplex real-time RT-PCR assays for more targets have to be divided into two or more panels. the limited throughput capacity became its obvious shortcomings due to the limited fluorescent channels in a real-time instrument and the adverse interactions between primers and probes in one reaction. the limited throughput capacity became its obvious shortcomings due to the limited fluorescent channels in a real-time instrument. the primer/probe design for a Luminex assay becomes easier because the criterion of probe and the size of amplicon are not as strict as a real-time PCR. the same primers and probes (slightly modified) shared by the rMLA and the real-time RT-PCR ensured not only the amplification efficiency and sensitivity of the rMLA assay. the detection limits of the rMLA for the six targets could be up to 6, 9, 5, 15, 6 and 10 copies/l if the cutoffs for rMLA were set at three times the blank control recommended by ACS Commitee on environmental improvement. rMLA for two targets, RSV and MPV, may be higher than the real-time RT-PCR, despite not confirmed by our statistical data in diagnosis. the new-developed real-time RT-PCR for 6 common respiratory viruses has great sensitivity and specificity comparable to the real-time RT-PCR. the rMLA can be expanded to include more respiratory pathogen targets, to meet local seasonal or emerging changes of respiratory infectious diseases. target DNAs were synthesized by Shanghai Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd.
