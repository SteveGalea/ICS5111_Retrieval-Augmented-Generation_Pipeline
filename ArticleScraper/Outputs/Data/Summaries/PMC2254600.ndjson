{"summary": "most emerging health threats are of zoonotic origin. their causative agents are RNA viruses which include but are not limited to HIV, Influenza, SARS, Ebola, dengue, and Hantavirus. of increasing importance therefore is a better understanding of global viral diversity. rPCR method combines reverse transcription primed with an oligonucleotide. initial modification was first used to construct a whole cDNA library from low amounts of viral RNA. DNAse-SISPA technique includes steps to detect both RNA and DNA sequences. we perform reverse transcription using a combination of random (FR26RV-N) and poly T tagged (FR40RV-T) primers in order to capture 5' ends of viral RNA. a random hexamer primer tagged with a conserved sequence at the 5' end was added to the Klenow reaction. the method can result in complete genome sequence of viruses ranging in size from 3,000\u201315,000 kb in a single experimental procedure. Figure 3 shows the sequence coverage obtained for three viruses: positive ssRNA phage MS2, positive ssRNA rhinovirus and negative ssRNA Newcastle disease virus (NDV). the SISPA method was performed for enterobacteriophage M13 (6407 bp), Newcastle disease virus Lasota (15,186 bp) and enterobacteriophage lambda (48502 bp) one, two or three 96-well blocks of clones were sequenced, trimmed and assembled. obtaining full genome coverage was analyzed using the Lander and Waterman model [17] which estimates the number of gaps present as a function of sequence number and genome size. the scaled difference between actual and expected coverage is 48.3 for the sequencing of a plate of 96 clones, 464.4 for two plates and 5477.4 for three plates. woodchuck hepatitis virus purified from plasma by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. human rhinovirus 16, purchased as a cell culture supernatant from ATCC, was subjected to a low speed spin to remove cellular debris. the polyT containing primer is added to the RT reaction at a concentration 200 fold lower than the random primer in order to reduce competition with the random primer. the conserved primer was used in the Klenow step of the SISPA protocol to enrich for the presence of amplicons from the 5' end. when used in combination with the 3' primer, we have been able to obtain full rhinovirus genome coverage in a 192 clone experiment. non-viral contaminant sequences were identified if they had a cut off value below 10-10. a cutoff e value of 10-25 was used to identify viral sequences. contaminant sequences ranged from 3\u201340%. a random hexamer primer tagged with a conserved sequence at the 5' end was added to the Klenow reaction. in order to capture 5' ends of viral RNA, a random hexamer primer tagged with a conserved sequence was added to the Klenow reaction. double stranded DNA is amplified by PCR using the primer tag (FR20RV) 96\u2013288 colonies are picked, plasmid DNA is purified and the inserts are sequenced. we have successfully used the SISPA method on viral samples. four contigs were generated per experiment, ranging in size from 248 nt to 4495 nt with a median contig size of 1395 nt. the contigs had high sequence redundancy, with a median depth of coverage of 14.33, varying from 11.18 for turkey astrovirus (TA) to a high of 40.29 for MS2. lambda was 26.7%, 42.9%, and 52.4% after one two and three 96 well blocks were sequenced. the coverage for lambda was 26.7%, 42.9%, and 52.4%. lambda phage, observed coverage and redundancy approach expected coverage. the scaled difference between actual and expected coverage is 48.3 for the sequencing of 96 clones, 464.4 for two plates and 5477.4 for three plates. the SISPA method works efficiently on viruses purified from a number of sources and by several methods. the sum of the total lengths of edited contigs for each dilution was calculated as percent of the total reference genome length. non-specific sequences were determined as those sequences which did not match reference genome with a cutoff value less than 10-25. the initial results indicated low sequence coverage at the 3' and 5' ends of most viral genomes. TURKEY ASTROVIRUS Contig Length Sequence reads Best Hit 689 2 Avian 501 2 None 423 2 None 518 2 None 259 2 None 1267 28 Turkey astrovirus 1692 43 Turkey astrovirus Total Sequences 148 Percent Specific 93.24% Genome coverage 90.84% HUMAN RHINOVIRUS 16 Contig Length Sequence Reads Best Hit 265 8 Mammalian 537 2 Mammalian 981 27 in experiments resulting in nearly complete genome sequences, contaminant sequences ranged from 3\u201340%. the nature of the contaminant sequence depended on the initial viral host and included mammalian, avian, bacterial, fungal, viral and unknown sequences. the majority of contaminant was of derived from human or mycobacterial nucleic acids. we routinely pick a total of 192 clones (or two 96 well blocks) per viral sample. this represents the most affordable sequence coverage to efficiency ratio. the 3' end of the virus generally has the lowest coverage in any use of this protocol. idated viral genomes to allow the removal of most extra-viral contaminants. the viral nucleic acids in samples whose capsid structures have been disrupted cannot be separated from contaminants, and therefore cannot be amplified by SISPA. l RNAse A was added to the viral resuspension and was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. the RNA pellet was resuspended in 20 l of nuclease-free water. the DNA was eluted with 50 l of nuclease-free water. a-tailed PCR amplicons were analyzed in a 1% agarose gel. fragments between 500 and 1000 nt were gel purified. clones were sequenced bidirectionally using the M13 primers. the loss of coverage due to various biases is represented as the difference between the ideal coverage and the actual coverage. to allow quantitative comparison, this'shortfall' difference is scaled by the standard deviation of the coverage probability distribution as given by Wendl [18] images were generated using the seqMan II sequence analysis software, DNASTAR Inc. 1989\u20132002. the following complete genomes were used as reference genomes for viruses discussed in this study. in 20 l of nuclease-free water, the DNA was eluted with 50 l of nuclease-free water. RNA was processed for random reverse transcription as previously described. cDNA was synthesized by Klenow reaction the presence of random primers. clones were plated on LB/Amp/XGal agar. individual colonies were picked for sequencing. we routinely sequenced 192 or more per library. EV = (1 - )N Where is the ratio of the read length and the genome length and N is the number of reads. the second moment is given as: EV2 = exp(-2) + 2/Nexp(-) Where, the redundancy, is define to be equal to N The expression for the variance is then: 2 = (1 - )2N - exp(-2) + 2/Nexp(-) enterobacteriophage M13 (NC_003287); human Rhinovirus 16 (L24917); Turkey Astrovirus (NC_002470); enterobacteria phage lambda (NC_001416) Competing interests The author declares that there are no competing interests."}
