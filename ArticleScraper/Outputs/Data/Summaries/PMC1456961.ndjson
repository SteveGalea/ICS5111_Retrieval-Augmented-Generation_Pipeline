{"summary": "results Informants expressed similar needs for improved information access. a hypothetical ideal model for information organization and delivery was developed based on informants' stated information needs. a major difficulty in meeting these needs is the great breadth of the PH discipline which makes it difficult to identify and collect evidence-based literature. studies of the information needs of PH professionals have addressed information seeking behaviors of PH workers, obstacles to information access, and defining and classifying the specific types of information needed. investigators focusing on the types of information needed by PH professionals have noted the need for diverse kinds of information. there is also a need for linkages among multiple databases as well as providing access to databases related to best practices, outcome measures, statistical information. the EBPPH project sought to examine and classify the features of the clinical evidence-based medicine resources. it sought to assess their potential for improving access to the PH literature. the project also works on identifying other existing projects aimed at synthesizing, summarizing or improving access to evidence-based PH information. all four participated in the development of interview questions and the conduct of focus groups. the first step was to identify and characterize existing information resources available to medical and PH professionals. the second step was to collect data on information accessing needs, behaviors, and barriers via individual interviews. the director of each sample work group was asked to provide names of individuals who most often needed access to information from multiple sources. eight potential interviewees from the CHP group were selected by their Director in the areas of cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease prevention and control. seven of the eight approached from CHP participated in a follow-on focus group at a later time. qualitative research consultant listened to the focus group tapes and took notes of study participants' comments related to information accessing features presented as close to verbatim as possible. coding and sorting of text segments can be done based on theme codes. a continuously evolving codebook was developed defining themes identified in the interview script as well as subthemes. the consultant informally explored the resources he identified and catalogued. the key access, formatting and content features these resources offered are listed in Table 1. individual interviews with BCDC informants took place in the fall of 2003. a follow-on focus group was held in the spring of 2004. the individual interviews with BCDC informants took place in the summer and fall of 2004. the hypothetical model that addressed most articulated needs was presented. additional questions were asked about the use of PubMed [23] as a foundation. the focus group was conducted in the early spring of 2005. findings were presented to a focus group of PH professionals previously interviewed. in the fourth process step we used information gathered to revise the individual interview script and make it more specific for interviewees in a second, but related domain of PH practice. eight potential interviewees from the CHP group were selected by their Director in the areas of cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease prevention and control. seven of the eight approached from CHP participated in a follow-on focus group at a later time. qualitative research consultant developed codebook defining themes identified in the interview script. transcripts in the Microsoft Word table structures were coded thematically in a table column adjacent to the relevant text segment. some themes were further deconstructed creating additional subthemes after sorting when this seemed appropriate. formulated search filters, (3) automatic notification (e.g. periodic emails to subscribers with information on recently published research reports), (5) systematic reviews, (6) evidence-based guidelines, (7) comprehensive knowledge sources, (8) within article indexing with links that allows access to the specific information needed. the individual interview script was developed by the project team. the individual interviews with BCDC informants took place in the fall of 2003. a follow-on focus group was held in the spring of 2004. the focus group agenda for BCDC included reviewing a summary of findings from their interviews. the focus group was conducted in the early spring of 2005 by project team members. all MDPH staff had desktop computers and access to the Internet. the main MDPH offices are located in multiple sites in the Boston area. the sources included websites, electronic automatic notifications often via listservs, journals, presentations at meetings, and personal communications. email was a key means for receiving automatic notification via listservs and exchanging a variety of types of information. a few informants who were less comfortable with Internet access still relied on hard copies of relevant journals that were circulated within their workgroup.

PH practitioners are regularly confronted with new problems and complex tasks that require a timely response, often before researchers can complete studies to offer guidance. the study confirms the findings of others that PH practitioners need access to information supported by limited evidence. participants identified several limitations in information access and in some cases suggested means for overcoming those limitations. review information is stored in a searchable registry. the site also provides summaries of the reviews but has not yet included access to unpublished work. other databases that present summaries of evidence-based practice information are more limited. listservs are available for only a few PH disciplines. a serious limitation of listservs is that they tend to deliver large amounts of information in formats that make it difficult for a user to quickly seek out specific information relevant to his/her interests. sycINFO and others have developed pre-formulated searches aimed at locating information in PubMed relevant to specific health people 2010 goals. developers have provided access to systematic reviews of PH interventions. they have also made strides in addressing the need for PH-specific search terms. search filters for PubMed to enable efficient retrieval of articles relevant to healthcare quality and costs based on several criteria related to methodological rigor. there is clearly a need to develop and promote more and better search terms and filters for PH because these will be important for locating studies for reviews. PH practitioners are regularly confronted with new problems and complex tasks that require a timely response. our study confirms the findings of others that PH practitioners need access to information supported by limited evidence. participants identified several limitations in information access and in some cases suggested means for overcoming those limitations. systematic reviews of PH interventions are rated by two independent reviewers. review information is stored in a searchable registry. other databases that present summaries of synthesized evidence-based practice information are more limited. listservs are available for only a few PH disciplines. a serious limitation of listservs identified by several subjects is that they tend to deliver large amounts of information in formats that make it difficult for a user to quickly seek out specific information relevant to his/her interests. a set of PH-specific search terms has been developed, tested and made accessible for routine use in PubMed. a set of filters aimed at identifying publications reporting high quality, evidence-based studies has been developed, tested and made accessible for routine use in PubMed. a set of search filters for PubMed to enable efficient retrieval of articles relevant to healthcare quality and costs based on several criteria related to methodological rigor. there is clearly a need to develop and promote more and better search terms and filters for PH since these will be important for locating studies for reviews and for skilled and interested users. the market for information-related products for medical practitioners is large enough to attract large investments in many new and creative ventures. a second reason that PH practitioners have fewer resources available to them is a lack of good primary research in PH that can be systematically reviewed [3,26]. government entities may be able to negotiate reasonable cost licenses for large PH populations to provide access via emerging systems. organizations concerned about PH practitioners' access to information should consider joining forces to sponsor further research. pre-publication history The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/6/89/prepub Supplementary Material Additional File 1 Script for BCDC key informant interviews at DPH.
