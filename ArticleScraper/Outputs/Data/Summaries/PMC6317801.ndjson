{"summary": "the family of PRRs includes secreted, membrane-bound and cytosolic PRRs. pathogenic organisms use sophisticated strategies to modulate PRR recognition. the human enteropathogen Shigella exploits different mechanisms to hijack the innate immune response. highly inflammatory hexa-acylated lipid A form to a less inflammatory tetra- and tri-acylated lipid A variant. this low-inflammatory LPS is poorly recognized by the PRR Toll-Like-Receptor 4 (TLR4), making macrophages and neutrophils less able to control the infection. Shigella induces TLR2-mediated apoptotic death through a mechanism mediated by T3SS, independent of cell PTX3 is a new player in the Shigella cross-talk with the infected tissues. results PTX3 binds to virulent S. flexneri, affects Shigella epithelial cell invasion and macrophage internalization. it contributes to serum bactericidal activity. PTX3-opzonized-bacteria display increased FITC staining with respect to bacteria incubated with BSA. recombinant PTX3 (50 g/mL, corresponding to 1,1 M), anti-IpaD Ab, BSA (both at 50 g/mL) or BSA (both at 50 g/mL) was used as a control and evaluated by flow cytometry. 105 CFU/mL of exponential phase M90T were treated with varying concentrations of human serum or heat-inactivated serum (HIS) survival was calculated as % of reduction of CFU number at 17% of NHS plus PTX3/ number of CFU at 17% NHS taken as value of 100. PTX3 opsonization with only the concentration of 50 g/mL significantly decreased the number of intracellular bacteria at 1 h and 2 h post-infection. in human peripheral blood monocytes-derived macrophages, opsonization with recombinant PTX3 at same concentrations as above only determined a significant improvement of bacterial phagocytosis at the concentration of 50 g/mL. bactericidal serum assay against S. flexneri M90T was sensitive to concentrations of > 10% pooled normal human serum (NHS) exposure to 17% NHS killed around 60% of bacteria. low doses of PTX3 increase the bactericidal activity of serum/complement. treatment with recombinant human PTX3 was carried out for 48 hours. animals infected with PTX3 survived even when treatment with PTX3 was stopped. animals infected with PTX3 survived even when treatment with PTX3 was stopped. n = 22 for M90T-infected-mice, n = 19 for M90T-infected and treated-mice. n = 10 for non-infected PTX3-treated mice. n = 10 for non-infected PTX3-treated mice. infected animals were 106 CFU (per lung) in PTX3 treated animals. local level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines was measured in BALs (broncho- alveolar lavage) and lung homogenates. chemokines/cytokines were previously shown to be involved in Shigella infection. hematoxylin-eosin staining showed acute pneumonia with severe bronchoalveolitis, alveolar edema and many damaged areas in the parenchyma. in PTX3-treated mice, lungs conserved a physiological architecture with a moderate inflammation of the aerated parenchyma and airways and a low and scattered neutrophilic exudate. PTX3-deficient mice showed increased mortality and lung colonization [12, 17]. mice challenged with PTX3 showed an accelerated death with respect to M90T-infected wild type mice. bacterial load in lungs of the infected animals was around ten times more. bacterial load (total CFU in one lung) in lungs (n = 10 for Ptx3-/- and n = 13 for C57BL/6 mice, respectively) dots represent CFU in individual mice, horizontal lines represent mean values and the error bars represent the standard error of the mean (SEM) BMDCs were infected with shigellae at the Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) of 10. PTX3 and TNF- production was monitored in parallel at 1, 3, 6 and 18 h. BS176 induced a significantly higher release of PTX3 than M90T. BMDCs stimulated with 1 ng and 10 ng of LPS derived from intracellular shigellae (iLPS), shigellae grown in TSB medium (aLPS), Shigella msbB1 msbB2 (msbB) LPS and purified commercial E. coli LPS for 12 h. to confirm this trend, the protocol of BMDCs was modified to abrogate the invasive phenotype BMDCs exposed to invasive and non-invasive strains previously killed with gentamicin. release of PTX3 did not change in BMDCs infected with killed BS176. in contrast, PTX3 values induced by killed M90T were significantly higher than those recorded with live M90T. Shigella induces PTX3 release mainly through myd88 and Trif pathways in human or murine DCs. infection of Myd88-/- BMDCs significantly reduced release of PTX3 with respect to wild-type BMDCs. BMDCs stimulated with iLPS and M90T msbB1 msbB2 LPS. PTX3 and TNF- release were similar for M90T and M90T msbB1 msbB2. the effect of acylation degree of LPS on live bacteria was not evident in murine DCs. the effect of acylation degree of LPS on live bacteria was not evident in murine DCs. we analyzed whether Shigella could promote PTX3 release in macrophages. BMDMs stimulated with 10 ng/mL of LPS derived from intracellular shigellae (iLPS), shigellae grown in TSB medium (aLPS), shigellae grown in TSB medium (aLPS), M90T msbB1 msbB2 LPS (msbB) and purified commercial E. coli LPS for 4 h, and infected with M90T (MOI BMDMs were primed with iLPS and M90T msbB1 msbB2 LPS. they released significantly less PTX3 than those primed with aLPS. PTX3 and TNF- yields were lower with iLPS and M90T msbB1 msbB2. the difference between M90T and M90T msbB1 msbB2 was maintained. no significant difference was induced by priming with the various LPSs. we then examined whether MoMs respond to Shigella infection. BMDCs used myd88-/-, Trif-/-, Irf3-/- and Cd14-/- BMDMs. PTX3 release was abrogated in all knockout BMDMs. BMDCs found that the MyD88 pathway was involved in the release of TNF- (S5G and S5H Fig) plasma samples were collected from 31 patients in the acute stage of culture-proven S. sonnei shigellosis. the highest levels of PTX3 in patients and controls were 50 ng/mL and 11.75 ng/mL, respectively. PTX3 binds to virulent S. flexneri, affects Shigella epithelial cell invasion and macrophage internalization. PTX3 (50 g/mL, 1,1 M) opsonized the wild type S. flexneri 5 strain M90T. PTX3-opzonized-bacteria display increased FITC staining with respect to bacteria incubated with BSA. recombinant PTX3 (50 g/mL, corresponding to 1,1 M), anti-IpaD Ab, BSA (both at 50 g/mL) or BSA plus recombinant PTX3 (both at 50 g/mL) was incubated for 1 h and 2 h of 105 CFU/mL of exponential phase M90T were treated with varying concentrations of human serum (NHS) or heat-inactivated serum (HIS) survival: CFU in the presence of NHS/CFU in the presence of HIS x 100. PTX3 opsonization with only the concentration of 50 g/mL significantly decreased the number of intracellular bacteria at 1 h and 2 h post-infection. in human peripheral blood monocytes-derived macrophages, opsonization with recombinant PTX3 at same concentrations as above only determined a significant improvement of bacterial phagocytosis at the concentration of 50 g/mL. exposure to 17% NHS killed around 60% of bacteria. low doses of PTX3 increase bactericidal activity of serum/complement. treatment with PTX3 improves survival of mice infected intranasally. treatment with recombinant human PTX3 (0.5 mg/Kg, 11 M) was carried out for 48 hours (three PTX3 injections) during the 72 hours, 55% of mice infected with M90T and treated with PTX3 survived even when the treatment with PTX3 was stopped. n = 10 for M90T-infected-mice and n = 11 for M90T-infected and treated-mice respectively. n = 10 for non-infected PTX3-treated mice Data show total CFU per lung. the local level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines was measured in BALs and lung homogenates. we chose some chemokines/cytokines, which have been previously shown to be influenced by PTX3 treatment [12 and 17, 29] and/or to be involved in Shigella infection [6, 34, 8] hematoxylin-eosin staining showed acute pneumonia with severe bronchoalveolitis, alveolar edema and many damaged areas in the parenchyma. phlogosis was characterized by a severe and diffuse neutrophil infiltrate in peribronchial, intraluminal and interstitial areas between alveoli. lungs conserved a physiological architecture with a moderate inflammation of the aerated parenchym deficiency of PTX3 could affect the virulence of Shigella. mice challenged with M90T showed an accelerated death. bacterial load in lungs of Ptx3-/- of the infected animals was around ten times more. invasive Shigella induces lower PTX3 release by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. BMDCs from C57BL/6 mice were infected with the invasive strain M90T. BMDCs were infected with shigellae at the Multiplicity of Infection (MI) of 10. PTX3 and TNF- production was monitored in parallel at 1, 3, 6 and 18 h. BS176 induced a significantly higher release of PTX3 than M90T. BMDCs stimulated with 1 ng and 10 ng of LPS derived from intracellular shigellae (iLPS), shigellae grown in TSB medium (aLPS), Shigella msbB1 msbB2 (msbB) LPS and purified commercial E. coli LPS for 12 h. to confirm this trend, the infection protocol of BMDCs was modified to abrogate the invasive pheno the release of PTX3 did not change in BMDCs infected with killed BS176. the PTX3 values induced by killed M90T were significantly higher than those recorded with live M90T. we prevented cell internalization by treating the cells with cytochalasin D, which disrupts cytoskeleton organization. the absence of Trif, Irf3 or Cd14 greatly reduced the release of PTX3. the absence of Trif, Irf3 or Cd14 greatly reduced the PTX3 production. BMDCs stimulated with iLPS and M90T msbB1 msbB2 LPS. PTX3 and TNF- release were similar for M90T and M90T msbB1 msbB2. acylation degree of LPS plays a pivotal role in triggering PTX3 release in human DCs. the effect of acylation degree of LPS on live bacteria was not evident in murine DCs. we analyzed whether Shigella could promote PTX3 release in macrophages. BMDMs stimulated with 10 ng/mL of LPSs as in (B) for 4 h and infected with M90T (MOI 10) for 3 h p.i. BMDMs were primed with M90T aLPS (mainly hexa-acylated), M90T iLPS (mainly tetra-acylated). BMDMs were primed with different LPSs and then infected with M90T msbB1 msbB2 LPS (mainly penta-acylated) and released significantly less PTX3 than those primed with aLPS. the amount of TNF- was similar for all the LPSs, as already shown [8]. sbB1 msbB2 was maintained, while no significant difference was induced by priming with the various LPSs as for PTX3(S5D Fig). we then examined whether MoMs respond to Shigella infection and LPS stimulation as observed with BMDMs, BMDCs and MoDCs. BMDCs used myd88-/-, Trif-/-, Irf3-/- and Cd14-/- BMDMs. we then used myd88-/-, Trif-/-, Irf3-/- and Cd14-/- BMDMs. plasma samples were collected from 31 patients in the acute stage of culture-proven S. sonnei shigellosis. highest levels of PTX3 in patients and controls were 50 ng/mL and 11.75 ng/mL. sonnei shigellosis and from healthy controls were assessed for PTX3 levels. phase fluid PRM PTX3 could play a decisive role in resolving Shigella infection. the treatment with recombinant human PTX3 rescues animals from death. antibodies directed against Shigella surface structures have been shown to prevent epithelial cell internalization and to promote the opsonophagocytic activity in macrophages. PTX3 opsonization is reminiscent of some in vitro properties of protective antibodies against Shigella external structures, thus contributing to Shigella eradication before the adaptive immune response is mounted. in wild type mice, low levels of CXCL1 and CXCL2 were associated with few areas filled by a neutrophilic exudate. PTX3 can directly contribute to local regulation of the inflammatory reaction based on neutrophil infiltrate. this binds to the adhesion molecule P-selectin and inhibits leukocyte rolling in the endothelium. levels of PTX3 correlate positively with severity of shigellosis. epithelial cells, macrophages, DCs and neutrophils have all been described as producers of PTX3. PTX3 is likely to be released only when inflammatory signals like TNF- and especially IL-1 are present. virulent/invasive shigellae induce lower levels of PTX3 than non-invasive shigellae. phenotypes associated with invasiveness play a major role in controlling PTX3 production. role of IRF3 in PTX3 production has already been observed in tissue repair. PTX3 could potentially contribute to the eradication of the infection by targeting the poorly explored extracellular phase of the invasion process. this can be considered the \u201cAchille heels\u201d of the Shigella invasion process. 107 CFU were incubated in 50 l HBSS with 0.5% BSA and biotinylated PTX3 (50 g/mL) after 1 h at room temperature, samples were extensively washed with HBSS. exposed phase bacteria were suspended in Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline (DPBS) with Mg2+ and Ca2+. incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min in the presence of NHS or HIS.
