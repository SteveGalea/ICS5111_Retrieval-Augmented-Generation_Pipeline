{"summary": "solid organ transplantation is a therapeutic option for many human diseases. complications such as infection and allograft rejection remain major causes of morbidity and mortality following solid organ transplantation. polyoma virus may induce CMV gene expression by stimulating cellular regulator proteins or by its own gene regulator proteins. increased viral replication and persistence may contribute to allograft injury (fibrosis) or chronic rejection. viral infection can also lead to the generation of cross-reactive T cells directed against shared antigens between virus and graft. pretransplant screening of potential organ donors and recipients is an essential part of solid organ transplantation. several guidelines for pretransplant screening have been published recently. a consensus conference on the immunocompromised patient and the American Society for Transplantation clinical practice guidelines on the evaluation of living renal transplant donors. universal prophylaxis include acyclovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, valganciclovir, and immune globulin preparations. reduction of immunosuppression, infusing donor lymphocytes, infusing EBV-specific cytotoxic T. intravenous immunoglobulin Hepatitis B and C (acquisition of new infection) Months 1\u201312 and beyond 1 year No data Serologic screening for antibody donor and recipient Interferon. the optimal management of immunosuppression in HIV infected individuals remains unknow Adenovirus, respiratory, syncytial virus, influenza, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus. in the renal transplant population, infection can occur acutely or as reactivation of latent virus. in the absence of prophylaxis, acute infection is most likely to occur between the first and third months following transplant. however, the onset of acute infection has been delayed by the use of prophylactic antivirals in the early posttransplant period. asymptomatic CMV infection was independent risk factors for overall mortality beyond 100 days posttransplantation and reduced graft survival. infection with CMV has also been implicated in chronic allograft nephropathy. it is still unclear whether the virus itself leads directly to this glomerulonephropathy. acyclovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, and immune globulin preparations have been evaluated for universal prophylaxis. ganciclovir and valacyclovir prophylaxis are equally effective in the prevention of CMV disease after renal transplantation. the length of prophylactic treatment varies by institution, but generally lasts for a minimum of 3 months. serology, viral culture, shell vial culture, pp65 antigenemia test, and qualitative and quantitative nucleic acid detection assays are currently available to aid in the diagnosis of CMV disease. the standard of care for treating active CMV disease is 2 to 3 weeks of intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg twice daily, dose adjustments for renal dysfunction) in seronegative patients, the addition of CMV hyperimmune globulin (100 to 150 mg/kg per dose intravenously, given monthly) may be useful. fda-approved for use in solid organ transplant recipients include foscarnet, cidofovir, and leflunomide. both foscarnet and cidofovir may exhibit synergistic nephrotoxicity with calcineurin inhibitors. one of the biggest challenges regarding the treatment of CMV is the emergence of antiviral resistance. universal prophylaxis involves giving antiviral therapy to all \u201cat-risk\u201d patients beginning at or immediately after transplant. patients with early replication are then treated with antiviral therapy to prevent symptomatic disease. each approach has advantages and disadvantages that must be considered in the context of the patient and the allograft. ganciclovir and intravenous ganciclovir were found to be as effective as oral ganciclovir for prophylaxis. but the use of ganciclovir may be associated with a greater rate of CMV resistance when compared with valganciclovir, at least in the highest risk recipients. the schedule for screening should be linked to the individual's risk for infection. weekly to biweekly screening should be considered to ensure the absence of infection for 3 to 6 months. the standard of care for treating CMV disease is 2 to 3 weeks of intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg twice daily, dose adjustments for renal dysfunction) valganciclovir has allowed for the oral treatment of CMV disease in SOT recipients. persistent viraemia at the end of therapy is associated with a higher risk of disease relapse. alternative therapies include foscarnet, cidofovir, and leflunomide. foscarnet is active against most ganciclovir-resistant strains of CMV. human herpesvirus 1-herpes simplex virus 1 belongs to subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, genus Simplexvirus, species human herpesvirus 1. seroprevalence for HSV-1 in the adult population is 60%, while the incidence of HSV in renal transplant recipients is estimated to be approximately 53%. mucocutaneous HSV infection should be treated with oral acyclovir. disseminated or deep HSV infection should always be treated with intravenous acyclovir. ganciclovir and foscarnet are also effective against HSV. 7.4% of the renal transplant recipients had herpes zoster with a median time to onset of 9 month. the main complications of a VZV infection in this immunosuppressed population were disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and hepatitis in almost half and pneumonitis in 29% of patients. reactivation of VZV and also HSV is recommended to prevent severe recurrences. patients who do not require CMV prophylaxis can receive valacyclovir or acyclovir for approximately one to three months posttransplant. most authorities defer vaccination with live vaccines; killed vaccine appears to be beneficial. the majority of symptomatic infections in renal transplant recipients are primary infection, likely related to reactivation of donor virus. the majority of symptomatic infections in renal transplant recipients are primary infection, likely related to reactivation of donor virus. PTLD is divided into four major histopathologic subtypes with corresponding clinical and biologic features. these include early lesions, polymorphic PTLD, monomorphic PTLD, and classical Hodgkin lymphoma type PTLD. biopsy is necessary to confirm a diagnosis of PTLD and to rule out other infectious lesions. indications for EBV load testing in an immunosuppressed transplant recipient typically include lymphadenopathy or other mass lesion. routine monitoring of EBV load in high-risk patients can help identify PTLD before signs and symptoms appear. preemptive therapy may include reducing immunosuppression and infusing anti-CD20 antibody or donor T cells. clinical management of PTLD typically involves reducing iatrogenic immunosuppression so that natural immunity against EBV and the neoplastic clone is restored. patients with isolated allograft involvement have a five-year survival of approximately 68% compared with those with PTLD extending beyond the transplanted kidney. HHV-6 isolates are classified into two variants (termed HHV 6A and HHV 6B) most infections in renal transplant recipients are due to HHV 6B. HHV7 uses the CD4 molecule as its receptor and is more strictly lymphotropic. HHV 8 is associated with Kaposi's Sarcoma, primary effusive lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman's disease. HHV 8 is thought to lead to Kaposi's Sarcoma through upregulation of VEGF receptor Flk1/KDR in endothelial cells. ian virus belongs to polyomaviridae, genus polyomavirus. it occurs in 1% to 10% of patients with kidney transplantation. lack of recognition or late diagnosis resulted in rapid loss of graft function in more than 50% of patients. the major sites of persistence for both BKV and JCV are the cells of the kidney and urinary tract. the most striking feature of BK infection in kidney transplant recipients is the lack of fever, malaise, myalgias, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, or other symptoms. cytopathic effect seen by light microscopy is typical, but not pathognomonic for BKVN. PCR provides a more objective estimate of true viral load and can distinguish BK viruria from JC viruria. the relative costs of PCR versus cytology are a center-dependent variable. a definitive diagnosis of rejection concurrent with viral nephropathy should only be made if there is endarteritis, fibrinoid arterial necrosis, glomerulitis or accumulation of the complement degradation product C4d along peritubular capillaries. only a few published cases of PVAN have been attributed to JC virus. protocol has resulted in clearance of Vm with no graft loss or significant rejection. step 1, decrease in the dose of MMF by 50% immediately after diagnosis. step 2, 50% decrease in the target trough level of tacrolimus at 3 months if decoy cells persisted. systematic reduction in immunosuppression has not been associated with clear evidence of increased chronic rejection. longer times of followup and more stringent studies are necessary to determine the longterm impact of the interventions for PVAN on long-term graft outcomes. multivariate analysis showed that HBsAg was an independent factor associated with inferior patient survival at 10 years (P b.0001). a more recent study by Matos and colleagues attempted to identify factors that increase liver fibrosis formation in renal transplanted patients. reactivation may cause necroinflammatory liver injury with biochemical dysfunction. fulminant hepatic failure due to HBV reactivation has been already noted after renal transplantation. current recommendations for HBV vaccination in susceptible dialysis patients are administration of 4 double doses (40 g each dose) by intramuscular route at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months. the risk of HBV transmission to the renal transplanted recipient is a function of serologic status of both donor and recipient. there have been no studies regarding the use of telbivudine and tenofovir after renal transplantation. the management of HBV after renal transplantation has given encouraging results with lamivudine, adefovir, and entecavir. liver biopsy is important because it is difficult, on clinical grounds alone, to estimate the severity of liver disease in CKD population. chronic immunosuppression used in transplant recipients also leads to higher circulating levels of virus and intrahepatic virus due to decreased T-cell response to the NS3 region of hepatitis C virus. transplant recipients may acquire hepatitis C through transplantation itself, which may lead to severe hepatitis. posttransplant monotherapies with ribavirin and/or amantadine have no apparent impact on HCV viremia or liver histology. such strategy could prevent liver disease progression and even HCV-related morbidities such as glomerulonephritis and posttransplant diabetes mellitus. a legal ban on the use of these organs seems unwarranted and likely harmful. the current era of HIV management, a legal ban on the use of these organs seems unwarranted and likely harmful. adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus can cause respiratory disease in the renal transplant population. adenovirus infections tend to be more prolonged, more severe, and sometimes fatal in immunocompromised patients. pathological clues to diagnosis of AV infection include gross haematuria, often severe, with haemorrhagic cystitis and fever with or without pneumonitis. most AV infections occur within weeks or months of transplantation due to activation of a latent infection, but AV infection can also occur years later. cidofovir may have activity against adenovirus, but its use must be balanced with the associated risk of nephrotoxicity [146, 147]. west Nile virus (WNV) belong to family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, species west Nile virus. virus has been responsible for thousands of cases of morbidity and mortality in birds, horses, and humans. the presence of new and emerging viral infections that may be transmitted by transplantation, such as west Nile virus, will likely present many future challenges for physician treating transplant recipients."}
