{"summary": "study of the etiology of severe childhood pneumonia was undertaken in the coastal area of The Gambia. there was high coverage with conjugate Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine. no routine use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), which is the case currently in many African countries. culture, nonmolecular serotyping, HIV testing, singleplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for lytA and cpsA (for Streptococcus pneumoniae) and glpQ (for H. influenzae), 16S rRNA PCR, multilocus sequence typing, and multiplex fast-track 33 PCR. laboratory analyses were done blinded and independent of each other. organism cultured from 21 of 56 (38%) specimens: S. pneumoniae in 14 (25%), H. influenzae (all non\u2013type b on latex agglutination) in 3 (5%), and Staphylococcus aureus in 3 (5%) 11 21 S. pneumoniae and S. aureus 1 2 S. aureus and H. influenzae 1 2 a McIntosh K. Community-acquired pneumonia in children. serotype 1, 22%; serotype 4, 18%; serotype 14, 18%; serotype 5, 16%; and serotype 9V/A, 2%. ten- and 13-valent PCVs both include serotypes that account for 76%\u201380% of serotypes identified in the samples in this study. Streptococcus pneumoniae and H. influenzae, predominantly NTHi, were detected together in around 1 in 5 cases in this hib-vaccinated population. current PCVs include >75% of serotypes identified in these samples. if there are any clinical samples for which pathogen detection alone is sufficient to assign causation, then these are lung and pleural aspirates. the challenge of accurately assigning causation to the pathogens detected remains, particularly when using more generally available specimen types."}
