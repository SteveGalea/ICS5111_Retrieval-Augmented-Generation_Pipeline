{"summary": "retrospective cohort study was carried out in the medical-surgical intensive care unit at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC) and King Abdullah Children\u2019s Specialist Hospital (KACSH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. study includes data from medical records of all patients admitted to ICUs who received mechanical ventilation between 2016-2018. the mortality rate was calculated as all mechanically ventilated patients who died in ICUs during the study period. the mortality rate was calculated as all mechanically ventilated patients who died in ICUs during the study period over the total number of mechanically ventilated patients in ICUs during the same year. baseline characteristics of patients at the time of ICU admission were reported as number and percentage for categorical variables. the primary outcome measure was the mortality during the ICU stay after the initiation of mechanical ventilation. the exit time was set as the earliest of either the death date or the discharge date. 98 patients died after receiving mechanical ventilation during the study period. the overall mortality for patients admitted to ICUs was 37%. the average duration of mechanical ventilation was 11 days. a total of 175 patients were admitted to ICUs and received mechanical ventilation between 2016-2018. most of the patients were below 1 month (89% of the whole population) and 59% were boys. by the end of one month, 75% of patients on mechanical ventilation are still alive. with respiratory problems (50%) was the main recorded cause of the initiation of mechanical ventilation, followed by respiratory distress syndrome (37%). 169 (96%) of the neonates were intubated in ICU while only 3% had already been intubated before their ICU admission. studies in literature have addressed mortality as an outcome among patients receiving mechanical ventilation. previous studies carried out in developed countries have shown an overall mortality rate of 30-44% among their population. this reaches 70% in countries with a low-resource setting. a higher percentage of patients who received mechanical ventilation were male. however, they were similar to females in terms of survival after the mechanical ventilation was initiated. this finding limits our generalizability of the results to the wider pediatric population. both KAMC and KACSH assign ICD-10 diagnosis codes for ICU admission diagnosis. re-grouping the principal diagnoses of ICU admission into mutually exclusive categories would impose further challenges as we may under- or overestimate the association of specific categories with others."}
