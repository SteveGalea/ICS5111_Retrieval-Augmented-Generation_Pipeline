{"summary": "the 29,931 ft2 murine vivarium includes 7117 ft2 of murine housing space and 4510 ft2 of procedural, surgical, imaging, irradiation, and genetic engineering space. the facility accommodates 62,496 mice in 15,624 IVC in 18 housing rooms, including 8064 immunodeficient mice in 2016 IVC in 4 isolation housing rooms. a separate necropsy room is equipped with a dual-draft necropsy workstation and hematology and serum chemistry analyzers. a double-sided rack configuration holding 126 microisolation units is used. each pair of racks is ventilated and exhausted by a separate AHU. IVC racks are sanitized at 180 \u00b0F final rinse in a rack washer with dryer. clean IVC are bedded, reassembled, and clamped shut. in separate loads, prepared IVC and municipal water\u2013filled bottles are then sterilized by passage through 2 roll-in prevacuum bulk steam sterilizers with bio-seals. biologic indicators detected VHP levels capable of a 6-log kill of Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores sealed inside pouches. biological indicators provided a visual, ink-on-card indication of 2-, 4-, or 6-log microbial kill VHP levels (Bioquell) oproteinase 2 (MMP2)-KO, and RAG2-KO/MMP13-KO mice were used to collect specimens from the interiors of IVC exhaust plenums. swabs were collected by tracing a circular pattern with the swab for 3 circumferences as the tip was rolled. swabs were then PCR-tested for evidence of 15 opportunistic microbes, 14 bacteria, and a fungus real-time PCR analysis was performed using a standard primer, standard probe concentrations, and a master mix on a real-time PCR platform. unconditional exact tests were performed using R 3.4 statistical software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) aspiculuris tetraptera, parainfluenza virus type 1 (Sendai), coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus), coronavirus (pneumonia virus of mice), poliovirus (theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus strain GDVII), reovirus type 3, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, mouse adenovirus types 1 and 2. changes occur every 2 wk and use a bag-out procedure while spraying with OxivirTb (Diversey Sealed Air, Charlotte, NC) Mice were fed a sterilized rodent diet (Teklad Global 18% protein, Envigo, Somerset, NJ), housed on sterilized pelleted paper bedding. IVC racks, plenums, and connecting hoses are washed in a mechanized rack or tunnel washer with 180 \u00b0F final rinse temperature. the exterior surfaces and interior prefilter chambers and hose connecting ports of AHUs are hand-sanitized. all washed IVC racks, connecting hoses, and hand-sanitized AHU are then VHP-decontaminated in a \u2018flex room\u2019. fecal pellets were collected from primary enclosures of immunodeficient mice. swabs were used to collect specimens from interiors of IVC exhaust plenums. swabs were then PCR-tested for evidence of 15 opportunistic microbes. hydrolysis probe-based real-time PCR assays targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were used to ensure DNA recovery and the absence of PCR inhibitors in extracted nucleic acids. a yearlong, facility-wide PCR surveillance tested 1738 specimens for 15 opportunistic microbes. 197 murine and 1541 IVC exhaust plenum specimens were evaluated by PCR. equipment specimens were collected monthly for 12 mo from each of the soiled IVC exhaust plenums of mouse-occupied IVC racks. proteus mirabilis 17/184 (9%) 219/1215 (18%)c 2/140 (1%)d 1/110 (1%) 0/76 (0%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa 0/184 (3%) 37/1215 (3%)c 4/140 (3%) 0/110 (0%) 0/76 (0%) Pasteurella pneumotropica biotype Heyl 7/184 (4%) 428/1215 (35%)c 3/140 (2%)d 0/ abilis, and Pasteurella pneumotropica biotype Heyl were detected in murine specimens. a 4th microbe, Klebsiella oxytoca, was detected sporadically in murine specimens. after the affected inventory was depopulated, Klebsiella oxytoca was no longer PCR-detected in murine specimens. the median percentage-positive value is represented by the thick horizontal line inside each box. blue dots indicate the percentage of tests that were PCR-positive during each month for each microbe. the 8 PCR-detected microbes were more readily detected in soiled IVC exhaust plenum PCR tests. mechanized washing significantly reduced the overall percentage from 19% PCR-positive tests of soiled plenums to 4% PCR-positive tests of washed plenums. PCR evidence of microbes was not substantively diminished in exhaust plenums after static-open VHP exposure compared with mechanized washing. d VHP exposure of equipment during months 7 through 10 significantly reduced overall the PCR evidence of microbes in plenums compared with static-open VHP exposure. fewer PCR tests of exhaust plenums after active-closed VHP exposure (6 of 608 tests; 1%) were positive for a microbe compared with after static-open VHP exposure (33 of 880 tests; 1%). Staphylococcus xylosus was the most prevalent microbe detected but became PCR undetectable in exhaust plenums after active-closed VHP exposure during months 8 through 10. all 8 opportunistic microbes recovered were overall and individually more readily PCR-detectable in IVC exhaust airways than in murine specimens. sanitization by mechanized washing reduced PCR evidence of microbes in exhaust plenums. however, assembled IVC racks connected to AHU set on to the VHP cycle ensured that VHP was effectively drawn through the IVC manifolds and plenums. despite the absence of marked, widespread morbidity attributable to Corynebacterium bovis, this organism can be harbored by a number of immunodeficient strains. us was the most prevalent microbe that we detected in both murine and plenum specimens. we complete semiannual active-closed VHP sterilization of all secondary housing equipment during each murine housing room change-out. we do not claim that implementing such sterilization efforts eradicates commensals. primary housing equipment by PCR testing of airway interiors for Staphylococcus xylosus contributes to immunodeficient murine biosecurity. the prevalent murine opportunistic microbes previously identified in surveys of programs7,8,30,41 and diagnostic laboratories37,51 include Helicobacter spp., Corynebacterium bovis, Proteus mirabilis, and Pasteurella pneumotropica as frequent isolates."}
