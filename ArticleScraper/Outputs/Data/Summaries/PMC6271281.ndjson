{"summary": "the use of metal-based drugs can be traced back to ancient times. mercurous chloride (Hg2Cl2) was used as a diuretic during the Renaissance period. modern medicinal inorganic chemistry though is a relatively young but vibrant research discipline. pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate, BSS), developed in 1901, is currently used to treat gastritis and dyspepsia. other current bismuth medications include De-Nol (colloidal bismuth subcitrate, CBS) and the more recently developed Pylorid. bi has a ground state electronic configuration of [Xe]4f145d106s26p3 and trivalent and pentavalent Bi, Bi(III) and Bi(V), respectively, are the two predominant oxidation states. such compounds possess a so-called inert 6s2 pair of electrons, which can have a stereochemical effect. Bi(III) is classified as a borderline Lewis acid according to the Hard Soft Acids Bases theory. it can form weak complexes with hard Lewis bases for example. an affinity for thiolate ligands is considered to be an important property of Bi(III) in biological systems. a bismuth(III) complex of 1,4,7,10-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (TPC) was demonstrated to bind calf thymus DNA. this interaction is likely to be non-covalent interchelative [22] bi(GSH)3 is therefore more stable than Bi(III) complexes with edta (log K = 27.8) or citrate (log K = 13.5) for example [24]. a formation constant for Bi(GSH)3 of log K = 29.6 was determined using 1H-NMR upon titration of GSH with [Bi(Hedta)]. hTF is an iron-transport glycoprotein. it binds Fe(III) tightly but reversibly. it plays a key role in iron homeostasis, transporting Fe(III) from extracellular fluid to cytosol. bi-based compounds are gastrointestinal, anti-microbial, anti-leishmanial and anti-cancer agents. bi-based compounds have been widely used at the start of the 20th century, for example for the treatment of syphilis, but demand declined dramatically after the development of antibiotics. sa. pylori is a microaerophilic and neutralophilic Gram negative bacterium that has the ability to colonise the human stomach. it was first identified as a potential pathogen in 1984 when it was linked with idiopathic gastritis. pylori has become associated with dyspepsia, peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. despite being in medicinal use for over 100 years the exact structure of BSS is not fully understood. the structures feature BiO clusters of formula [Bi38O44(HSal)26(Me2CO)16(H2O)2], Figure 5b, and [Bi9O7(HSal)13(Me2CO)5]. subfigures b and c are reproduced from [56] with permission from John Wiley and Sons, 2006. many different bismuth citrate complexes have been isolated by X-ray crystallography. urease is a dinuclear nickel(II) enzyme, which facilitates the bacteria to grow in the highly acidic stomach. urease is a highly conserved cysteine residue (Cys319) located at the entrance of the urease active site. HspA is a molecular chaperone and assists with protein folding processes within the bacterial cell. it was also proposed to be involved in nickel homeostasis in H. pylori due to the presence of a nickel binding domain, a His and Cys rich C terminus. the precise mechanism by which Bi-based compounds heal ulcers is not understood. the precise mechanism by which Bi-based compounds heal ulcers is also not understood. the anti-ulcer effects of CBS may well be more complicated than straightforward precipitation. 5-sulfosalicylic acid is found to be singly and doubly deprotonated. ethanol complex, [PhBi(HSal)EtOH], was determined to be insoluble in aqueous solution. two remaining complexes were remarkably water soluble resulting in solutions of pH 1.5. the 5-sulfosalicylic acid complexes had better activity than BSS. the complexes were all insoluble in water and aqueous HCl solutions. the molecular structure is shown in Figure 7d. four complexes of general formula, [Bi(O3SR)3] were synthesized, where R = phenyl, p-tolyl, 2,4,6-mesityl or S-(+)-10-camphoryl. MIC values as low as 0.049 g/mL were determined for a clinical H. pylori isolate 251. nine new tris-substituted Bi(III) aminoarenesulfonate complexes of general formula [Bi(O3S-RN)3], where RN = o-, m- and p-aminophenyl, 6-amino-3-methoxyphenyl, 2-pyridyl, o-aminonaphthyl, 5-aminonaphthyl, 4-amino-3-hydroxyn all ten reported NSAID complexes of general formula [BiL3]n or [BiL3(H2O)]n were found to exhibit excellent in vitro activity against H. pylori with MIC values of 6.25 g/mL. the carboxylate groups chelated Bi(III) in a bidentate fashion [77] with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry. novel bi(III) complexes of fluoroquinolones, a family of broad spectrum antibiotics, were developed by Shaikh and co-workers. the complexes were characterised by molar absorptivity determination, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, elemental analysis and FT-IR spectroscopy. complexes of high (1240 kDa), medium (675 kDa) and low molecular weight HA (240 kDa) were synthesized and characterised by elemental analysis, FT-IR, NMR and CD spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. it was proposed that Bi(III) binds to the hydroxyl, carboxylate and amino groups the use of high molecular weight glycosaminoglycans and polysaccharides is an interesting approach. neither authors speculate on the potential physiological impact of using such high molecular weight molecules on absorption for example. eradication of H. pylori is an important goal for the global scientific community. potassium bismuth tartrate, bismuth quinine iodide and iodobismitol. colitis (bismuth subnitrate, bismuth citrate), diarrhea (BSS and bismuth nitrate) and wound infections (bismuth oxide) the biochemical targets of Bi-based compounds have been studied much more extensively for H. pylori than other bacteria. there has been a resurgence of interest in the development of novel Bi-based compounds as anti-bacterial agents. the MIC for tetracycline hydrochloride against S. aureus was found to be 0.3 M though. only one of the complexes tested, [Bi(2Fo4Ph)Cl2], exhibited enhanced activity as compared to its free ligand against the Gram-negative bacteria, P. aeruginosa. bi(III) complexes of 2,6-diacetylpyridine bis(benzoylhydrazone) derivatives investigated as anti-bacterial agents. bi(III) complexes were more active than their Sb(III) analogues. bi(III) hydrazone complexes were more active against the Gram-negative bacteria. quinolones are either singly protonated (cfH) at piperazine N or doubly protonated (cfH) quinolones are either singly protonated (cfH) at piperazine N or doubly protonated (cfH) in (cfH2)(cfH)[BiCl6]2H2O the six chloride ions coordinate Bi(III) with octahedral geometry to give [BiCl6]3 anion. in (cfH2)2[Bi2Cl10]2H2O the Bi(III) is coordinated by chloride ions to give a centrosymmetric [Bi2Cl10]4 anion. a family of halobismuthanes derived from diphenyl sulfone exhibited promising anti-fungal activity against S. cerevisiae. they initially identified a family of halobismuthanes exhibiting promising anti-fungal activity against S. cerevisiae. organobismuth(III) dithiocarbamate analogues, Figure 11c, were inactive. a subsequent study of the influence of varying the structure of the carboxylate ligand on lipophilicity and anti-fungal activity suggested that the lipophilicity of the carboxylate compounds had no bearing on anti-fungal activity. there has been recent interest in this area and encouraging results. the disease is transmitted by the genus Leishmania. in north and south America it is transmitted by the genus Phlebotomus. it is prevalent in 98 countries worldwide, where 350 million people are at risk of contracting it. the residues involved in trypanothione reduction are indicated as sticks. trypanothione substrate, modelled on the basis of the T. cruzi TR structure (PDB code 2W0H), is also indicated as sticks and coloured cyan. the ion is coordinated in a distorted tetrahedral geometry by the two aforementioned cysteinate sulphurs, one threonine (Thr335) and one histidine (His461) from a second TR that forms a dimer complex. the parasite\u2019s ability to buffer oxidative stress is thought to be decreased [112]. the activity of four NSAIDs, naproxen, ketoprofen and diflunisal and their homoleptic tris-carboxylato Bi(III) complexes were investigated against leishmaniasis major promastigotes and human primary fibroblast cells for 48 h. a significant difference in the activity of naproxen and its tris-carboxylato Bi(III) complexes was observed though. o- and m-methoxybenzoic acid, 3,5-diacetamidobenzoic acid and 5-[(R/S)-2,3-dihydroxypropyl carbamoyl]-2-pyridinecarboxylic acid were reported. the o-methoxybenzoic acid complex, [PhBi(o-MeOC6H4CO2)2(bipy)], possessed the lowest IC50 of 1.9 thioxoketonate complexes of formula R1C-(=O)CH2(=S)R2 were synthesized. the complex is 7-coordinate and has disordered pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. the complex is 7-coordinate and has disordered pentagonal geometry. the thioxoketones were selectively toxic to L. major promastigotes as opposed to the primary human fibroblasts. surprisingly the Bi(III) thioxoketonates were less toxic than their free ligands. lipophilicity, stability and low lability were highlighted as factors. these complexes were tested against wild type (WT) and Sb resistant (SbR) strains of leishmania infantum chagasi and leishmania amazonensis. both complexes are 80 times more active than the trivalent BiCl3 and SbCl3 compounds. two novel triphenyl Sb(V) and two triphenyl Bi(V) complexes of benzoic acid derivatives and their respective free ligands were screened for activity against leishmaniasis promastigotes. toxicity occurs at a 6-fold higher level as compared to the active concentration against leishmaniasis promastigotes, indicative of the potential selectivity of these compounds. triphenyl Sb(V) and triphenyl Bi(V) complexes of acetylsalicylic acid and 3-acetoxybenzoic acid, acetylsalicylic acid, 3-acetoxybenzoic acid and metal salts were at least as active as the complexes. the ligands probably dissociate from the complexes prior to exerting their activity. the organo Sb(V) complexes were found to be 10 fold less toxic than organo Bi(V) complexes. resistance, compliance and toxicity are factors associated with current treatment options. there has been interest in developing new Bi-based drugs. bi(III) complex of 2-acetylpyrazine N(4)-phenylthiosemicarbazone (HL), [Bi(L)(NO3)2(CH3OH)] was found to be significantly less active (IC50 = 46.2 M) than cisplatin (1.2 M) and indeed the free ligand against K562 (leukaemia) cells on 24 h treatment. a bi(III) complex of 2-acetylpyridine, N(4)-pyridyl thiosemicarbazone (HL), [Bi(HL)(NO3)3] shows dodecahedral geometry around the bismuth atom of the asymmetric unit. the neutron thiosemicarbazone coordinates the Bi(III) via its pyridine nitrogen, imine nitrogen and thione sulphur. ligand 2,6-diacetylpyridine bis(4N-methylthiosemicarbazone), H2L, Figure 17a, [Bi(H2L)(NO3)2]NO3 was also reported. the bi(III) centre is nine-coordinate where the neutral pentadentate thiosemicarbazone ligand coordinates via three nitrogens and two sulphur atoms (N3S2) and two nitrate e Li et al. developed a 7-coordinate Bi(III) thiosemicarbazone complex. this complex differs only by the substitution of a pyridine ring for a pyrazine ring and a solvating ethoxide as opposed to a methoxide in the 2-acetylpyrazine N(4)-phenylthiosemicarbazone complex. it has sub-10 M IC50 values against bi(III) complexes of bis(2-acetyl- pyrazine)thiocarbonohydrazone (H2L) were found to be the most cytotoxic of the compounds studied and 14-fold more cytotoxic than the free thiocarbonohydrazone ligand against HepG2 liver cancer cells [94]. apoptosis observed is connected with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and also reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential. bi(III) complexes of 2,6-diacetylpyridine bis(benzoylhydrazone) derivatives are known to possess anti-microbial and anti-tubercular activities. bi(III) complexes of 2,6-diacetylpyridine bis(benzoylhydrazone) derivatives are known to possess anti-microbial and anti-tubercular activities. corresponding p-choro-benzoylhydrazone derivative, [Bi(HAcpClPh)Cl2] was more cytotoxic than the free ligand. corresponding p-choro-benzoylhydrazone derivative, [Bi(HAcpClPh)Cl2] was more cytotoxic than the free ligand. the authors undertook a relatively comprehensive investigation into the mechanism of action of this heterocyclic organobismuth(III) compound. the compound induced apoptosis at low concentrations (0.22\u20130.44 M) cisplatin and bis(O-alkyldithiocarbanato) Pt complexes performed the best, followed by Bi complexes such as those shown in Figure 19e. pH 6.8 was investigated given the assertion that solid tumours often have pH\u2019s of 6.8 and lower [121]. the organometallic Bi polymer of GA, BiPh3/GA, is described as a mixture of bridging and non-bridging structures about the Bi though largely non-bridging and asymmetric. the polyamine ester organometallic Bi polymer of norfloxacin, BiPh3/NF represents a better example of the anti-cancer potential of Bi containing polymers. bi polymer exhibits selectivity when its cytotoxicity is compared to its toxicity towards the WI-38 normal embryonic human lung fibroblast cells (EC50 = 4.2 g/mL) the results in this study are encouraging and the anti-cancer activity of Bi containing polymers certainly merit further investigation. 212Bi and 213Bi are -emitting radionuclides with half-lives of 60.6 and 45.6 min respectively. radiometals such as 212Bi and 213Bi are also used to develop therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. radiotherapy is the use of high energy radiation to kill cancer cells. chelating agents include diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, DTPA and 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid. bifunctional ligand was conjugated with trastuzumab, a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targeting antibody. RIT at 3.7 and 7.4 MBq exhibited a median survival greater than 303 and 227 days respectively. only moderate and transient toxicity was associated with treatment. peptides are analogues of gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) bi has been linked with the alleviation of side effects associated with cisplatin treatment. administration of Bi(III) salts prior to cisplatin treatment has been shown to depress the renal toxicity associated with cisplatin treatment. this renoprotective effect is due to Bi increasing metallothionein production in the kidneys. the development of effective Bi-based treatments for H. pylori could in turn indirectly have positive effects on the incidence of gastric and gall bladder cancer worldwide. Bismuth-based drugs are routinely used for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders and are found as key components of quadruple therapeutic regimens. important roles in medicinal chemistry."}
