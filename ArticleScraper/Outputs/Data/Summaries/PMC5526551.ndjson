{"summary": "the currently available cancer therapies usually suffer from poor selectivity between normal and invaded cells, with serious side effects and the development of drug resistance. the moiety of 1H-Indole-2,3-dione (isatin) moiety constitutes the backbone of a number of agrochemicals, dyes and bioactive molecules. indirubin is a bis-isatin isomer of the widely used colorant indigo (5, Fig 2). it inhibits both glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) via binding to the ATP pocket with IC50 values of 0.190 and 0.075 mM. polyesters such as copolymers of lactic and glycolic acid are attractive biomaterials for the encapsulation of pharmaceuticals and bioactive compounds. in this case, encapsulated drugs are not as readily available to biological systems as when they are in solution because the release of the drug will occur only after the onset of polymeric degradation. the microspheres were prepared with poly (D, L-lactide co-glycolide) PLGA (50:50, mol. wt 30,000\u201360,000) the emulsifier, low molecular weight polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was obtained from Alfa Aesar (Karlsruhe, Germany) the reaction mixture was refluxed for one hour. glacial acetic acid was added to equimolar quantities of hydrazones 2a-c (1 mmol) and benzaldehydes 3a-e (1 mmol) in ethanol (10 mL) the reaction mixture was refluxed for four hours and then cooled to room temperature. the obtained precipitate was collected by filtration, dried and re-crystallized. -d6) ppm: 56.1 (OCH3), 111.2, 112.4, 115.3, 117.1, 122.8, 126.6, 127.3, 129.4, 131.5, 133.9, 145.3, 162.4, 163.2 (Ar-CH Ar-C and C = O); MS (ESI) m/z: 280.1 [M+1]+; Anal.
