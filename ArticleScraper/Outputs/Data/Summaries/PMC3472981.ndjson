{"summary": "80% of infected individuals do not clear the virus following acute infection and will develop chronic infection that can lead to end-stage liver disease and complications. sustained clearance of the virus is only achieved in approximately 40% of individuals infected with HCV genotype 1 and 60\u201370% of those infected with genotypes 2 or 3 [1] antibodies induced against conserved, conformational epitopes in the viral envelope E1 and E2 glycoproteins [10]\u2013[12] can be broadly cross-neutralising. the fact that these antibodies neutralise different HCV genotypes highlights the importance of including epitopes from both envelope proteins for a vaccine strategy to be effective. vaccination of macaques using VLPs in a prime-boost regime has been reported to induce broadly neutralising antibody responses against different HCV genotypes. the fact that heterologous viral vectors and/or unrealistic dosing regimes are required to induce protective immunity indicates that it is necessary to improve their immunogenicity. the forward Core/E1 primer was designed to introduce an XbaI enzyme restriction site followed by a Kozak sequence, a start codon and a His(6) tag at amino terminal end of the core protein. the reverse primer of core/E1 (5\u2032 ggCTTAAgCCCggTgACgTgggTTTCC gCgTCgAC 3\u2032) was designed to introduce a double stop codon and an EcoRV restriction site at the 3\u2032 end of the Huh7 cells were infected with rAdHCV-CE1E2 at a MOI of 1. resulting pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl for 4 hours at 4\u00b0C. branched anionic peptide construct containing eight N-terminal glutamic acid residues (E8) using traditional Fmoc chemistry has been described previously [23]. synthesis was carried out manually using PEG-S RAM solid support. dendritic cells were cultured in the presence of 5 g FITC-labelled VLPs alone or in association with E8Pam2Cys (0.01 nmoles/ml) cells were harvested after 24 hours, washed, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde. a line of murine BALB/c-derived DCs (D1 cells) was prepared and propagated according to the method described by Chua et al [26] after a minimum of 21 days in culture, cells were stained for Class II MHC using FITC conjugated anti-IA/IE antibody (Clone M5/114.15.2; Becton Dickinson, USA) data were analysed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, San Carlos, CA) cells were exposed to varying concentrations of aluminium hydroxide gel, Alhydrogel (Sigma Aldrich, Missouri, USA), E8Pam2Cys or lipopolysaccharide (5 g/ml) as a positive control. cells were harvested, washed and analysed for expression of surface class II MHC antigen. cells were harvested 5 days later, washed and serial dilutions commencing at 5105 cells/ml performed in polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane-lined 96-well plates (Millipore, Ireland) previously coated with 5 g/ml anti-IFN- capture antibody. cells were then cultured in the presence of 3.75105 irradiated autologous VLP-pulsed (10 g) splenocytes for phosphatase was added and incubated for 2 hours in a humidified atmosphere. plates were then washed and streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase added and incubated for a further 2 hours. ivalis lectin (2 g/ml; Sigma Aldrich Australia) in carbonate buffer (15 mM NaCO3, 35 mM NaHCO3, 0.21 mM NaCl) for 30 minutes at room temperature Following removal of antigen, 100 l of BSA (10 mg/ml) in PBS was added and plates incubated for 1 hour at room temperature before washing four times with PBST. 5105 splenocytes in 200 l of RF-10 medium were added and incubated for 36 hours at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. biotinylated anti-IgG antibody and streptavidin-conjugated horse-radish peroxidase were used as detection reagents. core/E1 genes were amplified from pBRTM_HCV 1\u20133011 plasmid. plasmid containing genome of HCV 77H, genotype 1a (a gift from Prof C Rice) reverse primer of core/E1 (5\u2032 ggCTTAAgCCCggTgACgTgggTTTCC gCgTCgAC 3\u2032) was designed to introduce a double stop. the core/E1 and E2 amplicons were cloned into pGEMEasy (Promega) and subsequently subcloned into pAdTrack-CMV (provided by B Vogelstein, Howard Hughes Medical Centre, Baltimore) this construct was subsequently subcloned into pAdTrack-CMV (provided by B Vogelstein, Howard Hughes Medical Centre, Baltimore) the suspension was vortexed vigorously and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. all VLP preparations were stored in aliquots at 70\u00b0C until use. isopropylethylamine (DIPEA; Sigma, Australia) to generate E8 has an overall charge of 8. the Pam2Cys lipid moiety was then coupled according to Zeng et al [25] to generate E8(Pam2Cys) lipopeptides were analysed by reversed phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using a Vydac C4 column (4.6300 mm) installed in a Waters HPLC system. the chromatogram was developed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using 0.1% TFA in H2O. cell fluorescence was quenched by addition of an equal volume of 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4.0) containing 250 g/ml trypan blue. cells were exposed to varying concentrations of aluminium hydroxide gel, Alhydrogel (Sigma Aldrich, Missouri, USA), E8Pam2Cys or lipopolysaccharide (5 g/ml) female HHD mice (3 per group) were inoculated subcutaneously on each side of the base of tail (50 l per dose) with VLPs (30 g) either alone, emulsified in an equal volume of complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (CFA) or with an equal amount of E8Pam2Cys on days 0 and 14. splenocytes were restimulated in vitro at a concentration of 3106 cells/ml in RF cells were then cultured in the presence of 3.75105 irradiated autologous VLP-pulsed (10 g) splenocytes for 40 hours at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. plates were then washed and streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase added and incubated for a further 2 hours. 96-well polyvinyl plates were coated with either purified HCV VLPs (10 g/ml) or recombinant E2 protein (5g/ml) in PBSN3 overnight at 4\u00b0C. 96-well plates coated with 100 l of PBS containing VLPs (10 g/ml), recombinant E2 (10 g/ml) or anti IgG antibody (10 g/ml) were washed 5 times with PBS and blocked for 2 hours using RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, USA) cells were washed with PBS (0.1% FCS) and then fixed in BD Cytofix. inhibition of VLP entry was determined by flow cytometry. sera from vaccinated mice showed a decrease in specific cellular binding of 50% compared to sera from nave mice. untreated DCs contained two populations of cells which were MHC class IIlow and MHC class IIhigh. incubation with HCV VLPs mixed with E8Pam2Cys caused a dramatic shift in the distribution of MHC class II expressing cells. cells were left untreated, exposed to LPS (5 g/ml) or to similar amounts of each adjuvant alone. cell surface MHC class II expression was determined after 16 hours using a PE-conjugated anti-IA/IE antibody. cells expressing low levels of MHC class II molecules were deemed to be immature whilst those expressing high levels were considered to be mature. HCV VLP-specific antibody titres in sera obtained after one, two or three doses of each formulation were then determined by ELISA. administration of VLPs alone in saline was able to elicit detectable titres of specific antibody that were marginally increased after each dose of antigen. inoculated (100 l) sub-cutaneously at the base of the tail with 20 g of VLPs alone, pre-incubated with an equal volume of aluminium hydroxide (13 mg/ml) or 60 g of E8Pam2Cys in saline on days 0 and 21. an additional dose of each formulation was also administered to 3 mice. antibody secreting cells were enumerated in a ELISPOT assay. the ability of sera from vaccinated animals to Neutralise VLP cell entry. we first set out to assess the neutralising activity of antibodies induced by vaccination. supernatants were clarified by centrifugation, incubated with Huh7 cells (5105) in a total volume of (500 l) for 1 hour. cells were then harvested and cellular fluorescence levels analysed. the frequency of peptide-specific T cells producing IFN- was determined in an ELISPOT assay. each bar represents the average number of IFN- producing T cells. each bar represents the average number of IFN- producing T cells. ed with lipopeptide E8Pam2Cys also resulted in higher levels of cell fluorescence compared to untreated DCs. the percentage of fluorescenated cells in these cultures was similar to cultures that contained FITC-VLPs alone. however, the levels were still higher than untreated cells confirming the presence of intracellular FITC-VLPs. dendritic cells (2105 cells) were incubated with VLPs (5 g) alone or formulated with E8Pam2Cys (0.01 nmoles/ml) or Alhydrogel (5 g) in a total volume of 1 ml. cells were either left untreated, exposed to LPS (5 g/ml) or to similar amounts of each adjuvant alone. no DC activation was observed in the presence of Alhydrogel. the presence of E8Pam2Cys in HCV VLP-containing formulations promotes uptake of HCV VLPs. groups of BALB/c mice (n = 3) were inoculated with (100 l) sub-cutaneously at the base of the tail with 20 g of VLPs alone. groups were pre-incubated with an equal volume of aluminium hydroxide (13 mg/ml) or 60 g of E8Pam2Cys in saline. the tail with 20 g of VLPs alone, pre-incubated with an equal volume of aluminium hydroxide (13 mg/ml) or 60 g of E8Pam2Cys in saline on days 0, 21 and 56. the ability of sera obtained from mice inoculated with VLPs to inhibit the binding and entry of VLPs into Huh7 cells. Huh7 cells (5105 cells) were incubated with FITC labelled VLPs (200 ng) in the presence of a 140 dilution of anti-CD81 antibody or serum from nave mice. cells were then harvested and cellular fluorescence levels analysed by flow cytometry. cell-mediated responses elicited by vaccination. HLA-A2kb transgenic mice were inoculated (100 l) subcutaneously at the base of the tail on days 0 and 14 with 30 g of VLPs alone. emulsified with complete freund\u2019s adjuvant (CFA) or pre-mixed with 30 g of E8Pam2Cys. icacy is the quadrivalent VLP-based vaccine Gardasil. it prevents persistent infection and associated disease caused by human papillomavirus. other studies of VLP-based vaccination strategies have also shown promising results. the use of the anionic lipopeptide E8Pam2Cys overcomes many of the technical complexities related to this process. the ability of Pam2Cys to dramatically enhance the immunogenicity of HCV VLPs was demonstrated in the improved overall antibody responses that we observed. branched anionic lipopeptide together with VLPs containing HCV antigens can provide benefits in terms of inducing improved levels of neutralising antibody titres. this strategy could therefore constitute a valuable addition to the armamentarium of current VLP-based vaccine developments against HCV."}
