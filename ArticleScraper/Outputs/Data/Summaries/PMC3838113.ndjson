{"summary": "human coVs cause illnesses including the common cold and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the recently identified Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) associated with infection of a novel coronavirus. four main genera have recently been designated (2): alphacoronaviruses, which contain human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and HCoV-NL63; betacoronaviruses, containing human coronaviruses SARS-CoV, H MHV genome encodes 16 nonstructural proteins processed by viral papain-like protease 1 (PLP1), PLP2 and nsp5 protease. nsp5 is responsible for 11 processing events between nsp's 4 and 16. nsp5 is responsible for 11 processing events between nsp's 4 and 16. studies evaluating nsp5 dimerization have identified three separate mutations in nsp5 that are >9 from known dimerization determinants. other studies have demonstrated that mutations in nsp3 and nsp10 alter or reduce nsp5-mediated polyprotein processing (20, 21) chimeric MHVs were unable to compete with wild-type MHV (WT-MHV) in direct coinfection fitness experiments. exchange of nsp5 proteases from other genogroups did not permit recovery in chimeric MHV. nsp5 sequences for human coronaviruses HKU1 (H5-MHV) or OC43 (O5-MHV) were synthesized in the cloned MHV cDNA genome fragments. sequences were confirmed prior to attempted virus recovery. s were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 PFU/cell and grown until 30 to 50% of the cells were involved in syncytia. RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and cDNA amplicon synthesis were performed as previously described. amplicons using oligonucleotides flanking the nsp5-coding region were generated and treated with HKU1 (HincII) and OC43 (BsiWI) sequence-specific restriction enzymes. the bands were resolved on a 0.8% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide, imaged, and quantified by densitometry. nsp5 sequences for human coronaviruses HKU1 (GenBank accession number NC_006577), OC43 (accession number NC_005147), SARS-CoV (accession number AY278741), 229E (accession number NC_002645) and NL63 (accession number NC_005831) were synthesized in the cloned MHV cDNA genome fragments (BioBasic) confluent monolayers of DBT cells in T25 (25-cm2) flasks were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 PFU/cell and grown until 30 to 50% of the cells were involved in syncytia. RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and cDNA amplicon synthesis were performed as previously described. the medium supernatant was thawed at 4\u00b0C, and 5 l was added to each of three T25 flasks of confluent cells. RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed as previously described. HCoV-HKU1 nsp5 (PDB accession number 3D23) was used for structure comparisons. structural models were generated by using Modeller and MacPyMol (29) replicate plates of murine DBT cells were infected at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) or a high MOI (1 PFU/cell) both H5- and O5-MHV exhibited similar replication and attained peak titers at the same time postinfection (p.i.) MHV temperature-sensitive mutations differ in their phenotypes in chimeric H5-MHV and O5-MHV. the three temperature-sensitive mutations impair virus replication and nsp5-mediated polyprotein activity at a nonpermissive temperature. -MHV, H5-MHV, O5-MHV, and H5- and O5-MHV containing either S133A or V148A mutations were determined by plaque assays on DBT cells at either 32\u00b0C or 40\u00b0C. the temperature either remained at 32\u00b0C (B) or was shifted to 40\u00b0C (C) at 6 h p.i. no second-site mutations were detected in the nsp3- and nsp10-coding regions of the H5-V148A, O5-V148A, and O5-S133A populations at peak titers. the delayed recovery of replication in the O5-S133A mutant suggested the emergence of phenotypic revertants. titers for WT-MHV, MHV-V148A ts mutant, and O5-MHV containing V148A and Y134H mutations were determined by plaque assays at either 32\u00b0C or 40\u00b0C. a single H134Y suppressor mutation in MHV was capable of partially or fully suppressing independently the phenotype of all three ts mutations (S133A, V148A, and F219L) a second-site suppressor mutation of all three MHV ts mutants resulted in a lethal phenotype. these data demonstrate a critical role of residue 134 in nsp5 function. the replication assays and results from introduction of MHV ts residues into the backgrounds of H5- and O5-MHV indicate subtle differences in structure or sequence can have a significant impact on nsp5 activity and regulation. culated with a 10:1 advantage over WT-MHV, the amount of WT-MHV was equivalent to or exceeded the amount of the chimeric mutants by P2 and WT-MHV was dominant in both cases by P3. cDNA amplicons containing the nsp5-coding region were generated and digested with an HKU1 nsp5-specific restriction enzyme. 1:1 ratio for coinfection, the relative amounts of H5:O5 detected were approximately 1:1, with no clear fitness advantage through P3. chimeric MHV-A59 viruses encoding nsp5 from HKU1 (H5-MHV) and OC43 (O5-MHV) were readily recovered at 37\u00b0C and exhibited cytopathic effects. the complete genome sequences of chimeric H5- and O5-MHV identified an intact heterologous nsp5 sequence and no additional mutations. replicate plates of murine DBT cells were infected at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) or a high MOI (1 PFU/cell) MHV temperature-sensitive mutations differ in their phenotypes in chimeric H5-MHV and O5-MHV. the three temperature-sensitive mutations impair virus replication and nsp5-mediated polyprotein activity at a nonpermissive temperature of 40\u00b0C (23, 24) titers for MHV, H5-MHV, O5-MHV, and H5- and O5-MHV containing either S133A or V148A mutations were determined by plaque assays on DBT cells at either 32\u00b0C or 40\u00b0C. titers were determined by plaque assays in duplicate per sample. no second-site mutations were detected in the nsp3- and nsp10-coding regions of the H5-V148A, O5-V148A, and O5-S133A populations at peak titers. plaque isolates were selected and sequenced for nsp5 mutations, resulting in identification of two putative suppressor mutations, A116V and N8Y. nsp5 protease residue Y134 regulates nsp5 function in MHV and OC43. MHV-A59, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 are labeled with asterisks. titers for WT-MHV, the MHV-V148A ts mutant and O5-MHV containing V148A and Y134H mutations were determined by plaque assays the Y134 residue identified as a second-site suppressor mutation in the background of H5-V148A resulted in a lethal phenotype. these data demonstrate a critical role of residue 134 in nsp5 function. the replication assays and results from introduction of MHV ts residues into the backgrounds of H5- and O5-MHV show reduced fitness relative to WT-MHV. of 1:1, WT-MHV represented >75% of supernatant infectious virus after passage 1 (P1), and by P3, almost no chimeric virus was detected. even when H5-MHV or O5-MHV was inoculated with a 10:1 advantage over WT-MHV, the amount of WT-MHV was equivalent to or exceeded the amount of the chimeric mutants. ror bars represent the standard deviation from the means for each of the relative frequencies shown. the relative amounts of H5:O5 detected were approximately 1:1, with no clear fitness advantage through P3. nsp5 of closely related coronaviruses mediate all required activities for replication in culture in the heterologous MHV background. nsp5 proteases from several divergent CoVs may have provided a pressure for intramolecular reorganization. nsp5 must properly fold within context of replicase polyprotein and an nsp4-10 intermediate, orchestrate its autoproteolytic processing, dimerize, and recognize and process up to 9 additional cleavage sites. coroner nsp5 proteases display a high degree of tertiary structure conservation. there are a number of conserved residues, independent of known catalytic and dimerization regions, which span the protease structure. the structural and functional roles of these residues and other nonconserved residues proximal to them remain largely unknown. potential explanations of Y134 function may include stabilization of the active site, disruption of dimerization, or modification of protease specificity. biochemical characterization of purified mutant proteases will be essential to precisely define the functional role of the tested mutations. chimeric substitution of more diverged nsp5 proteases prevents virus recovery. nsp5 proteases of betacoronaviruses MHV, HKU1 and OC43 exhibit 80 to 84% sequence identity to each other and occupy the same genogroup, genogroup 2a. nsp5 is part of a cistron containing nsp's 5 to 16, which share a functional role in the replication of the virus. three different studies have shown a critical regulation of nsp5 by other elements of the replication complex. chimeric substitution of nsp5 proteases into the cloned genome background may constitute a robust platform for evaluating structural and functional differences in an isogenic replicating virus. nsp5 proteases are primary inhibitor targets due to their central role in the processing and formation of viral replication. temperature-sensitive residues reported for MHV nsp5 domains 2 and 3 are also important for replication and temperature sensitivity in HKU1 and OC43. this results also demonstrate that the genetic divergence of nsp5 is associated with subtle refining of the intramolecular communication networks and their role in regulating protease activity. potential explanations of Y134 function may include stabilization of the active site, disruption of dimerization, or modification of protease specificity. biochemical characterization of purified mutant proteases will be essential to precisely define the functional role of the tested mutations. nsp5 proteases of betacoronaviruses MHV, HKU1 and OC43 exhibit 80 to 84% sequence identity to each other. nsp5 proteases of alphacoronaviruses 229E and NL63 and more distantly related betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and bat HKU4 show no greater than 53% identity. nsp5 is part of a cistron containing nsp's 5 to 16, which share a functional role in the replication of the virus. three different studies have shown a critical regulation of nsp5 by other elements of the replication complex or the polyprotein backbone. coronavirus nsp5 proteases are primary inhibitor targets due to their central role in the processing and formation of viral replication. more promising inhibitor candidates have been limited to low M concentrations and have yet to be tested against a replicating virus."}
