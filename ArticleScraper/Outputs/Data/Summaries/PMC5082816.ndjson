{"summary": "the authors discuss the proviral role of virus-induced membrane contact sites (vMCSs) vMCSs channel lipids to viral membranes and tune the lipid composition for optimal generation and functioning of replication organelles. replication organelles can have one of two distinct types of morphology. organelle is formed by protrusion from host membranes to generate tubular and/or vesicular replication organelles. many viruses have been described to form double-membrane vesicle-shaped replication organelles. VMCSs promote the morphogenesis and functioning of viral replication organelles. membrane contact sites play a major role in cellular lipid homeostasis. membranes of two organelles come in close apposition to facilitate communication. membranes of two organelles come in close apposition to facilitate communication between various organelles. the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is known to form MCSs with many different organelles. different MCSs harbor specific sets of machinery that regulate MCS formation and stability. signals lipids regulate MCS formation and stability and provide a driving force for the transfer of other lipids. vMCSs channel lipids to viral membranes and tune the lipid composition for optimal generation and functioning of replication organelles. viruses can recruit the MCS proteins directly, through interactions with viral proteins (VPs) or indirectly, by hijacking a cellular pathway that recruits the MCS machinery. vMCSs formed between the ER and peroxisomes could be stabilized by self-interaction between viral replication proteins to tether the donor and acceptor membranes. viruses from other families that build invagination-type replication organelles also recruit vMCSs and recruit sterol shuttling proteins. enteroviruses primarily target the Golgi complex to generate replication organelles, while cardioviruses and HCV are proposed to target ER membranes. vMCSs are used differently among +RNA viruses, which may be related to replication organelle morphology. vMCSs form transiently between two subdomains of apposing membranes, then sliding onto new neighboring subdomains of the same organelles, thus acting as a molecular assembly line. protrusion-type replication organelles can directly engage other organelles via vMCSs and regulate their stability via PI4P signaling lipids and the physiological ER\u2013Golgi MCSs. enteroviruses are insensitive to such disruption. sterols seem to facilitate both the morphogenesis and functioning of replication organelles. vMCSs play critical roles in morphogenesis and functioning of replication organelles. future experiments will address whether the co-opted vMCSs are involved in metabolite/phospholipid uptake by replication organelles. all +RNA viruses remodel host membranes into specialized membranous structures where the viral genome is replicated. a second type of replication organelle is formed by protrusion from host membranes to generate tubular and/or vesicular replication organelles. many viruses have been described to form double-membrane vesicle-shaped replication organelles. replication organelles of enteroviruses (e.g., poliovirus, coxsackievirus, and rhinovirus) appear very dynamic. s, PI4Ks produce PI4P lipids to recruit OSBP. then, OSBP mediates the accumulation of cholesterol in replication organelle membranes. PI4P is hydrolyzed after delivery at the ER by Sac1 phosphatase. the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is known to form MCSs with many different organelles. different MCSs harbor specific sets of machinery that regulate MCS formation and stability. signals lipids regulate MCS formation and stability and provide driving force for the transfer of other lipids. vMCSs channel lipids to viral membranes and tune the lipid composition. vMCSs can recruit the MCS proteins directly, through interactions with viral proteins (VPs) or indirectly, by hijacking a cellular pathway that recruits the MCS machinery. vMCSs formed between the ER and peroxisomes could be stabilized by self-interaction between viral replication proteins to tether the donor and acceptor membranes. viruses from other families that build invagination-type replication organelles also recruit vMCSs and recruit sterol shuttling proteins. enteroviruses primarily target the Golgi complex to generate replication organelles, while cardioviruses and HCV are proposed to target ER membranes. vMCSs are used differently among +RNA viruses, which may be related to replication organelle morphology. vMCSs form transiently between two subdomains of apposing membranes, then sliding onto new neighboring subdomains of the same organelles, thus acting as a molecular assembly line. protrusion-type replication organelles can directly engage other organelles via vMCSs and regulate their stability via PI4P signaling lipids and the physiological ER\u2013Golgi MCSs. virus with protrusion-type replication organelles display a remarkable heterogeneity with respect to dependence on the cytoskeleton. current findings likely represent only a narrow window into the roles of vMCSs during virus infections. future experiments will address whether co-opted vMCSs are involved in metabolite/phospholipid uptake by replication organelles, alteration of cellular signaling, ion homeostasis and pathogen defense signaling."}
