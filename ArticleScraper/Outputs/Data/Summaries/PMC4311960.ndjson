{"summary": "the poultry gut is the site of nutrient absorption and can be a site for the introduction and proliferation of myriad microorganisms. poor gut health can affect poultry performance in general\u2014even in the absence of a recognized disease state\u2014resulting in the failure of birds to reach well-established genetic potential. studies have focused on individual intestinal viruses as possible etiologic agents in PEC and RSS [14\u201318]. suspect enteric viruses implicated in these syndromes are also found in healthy poultry flocks, and pathogenic bacterial and even protozoal infections may be present in certain cases. contact birds were placed on farms in order to provide a dynamic sample of bacteria and viruses capable of colonizing the avian intestinal tract through normal routes. this is in contrast to earlier investigations in which crude homogenates prepared in the laboratory are orally inoculated into experimental birds under isolated conditions. these sentinel birds represent an environmental sample that captures interactions with other birds in the flock and the environment of the house, farm, or yard. pooled intestines were immediately processed via blending (Waring) into 10% homogenates in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) five pooled intestinal tracts from pre-contact SPF chickens were also received and homogenized separately from the contact birds\u2019 intestines. 450l of the re-suspended pellet, 50l 10X Turbo DNAse buffer (Ambion), 2.5l Turbo DNAse (2Units/l), 0.25l RNAse A (20mg/ml, Invitrogen), 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. total viral RNA was precipitated via sodium acetate/ethanol precipitation, re-suspended in 50l TE buffer, and stored at -80\u00b0C. cDNA representing the total viral RNA was submitted directly for high-throughput sequencing. prepared cDNA was barcoded and sequenced using the Ion Xpress Library Kit (Life Technologies) and the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine. sequences were de-multiplexed and preprocessed with the Galaxy toolkit [35] and our own custom tools [36]. additional quality controls per recent recommendations and standard protocols were completed using Perl and Bioperl scripts to trim pyrosequencing tag sequences. sequences were further limited to a range of 325\u2013425 bp. differentially abundant taxa between the MSPF flock and each experimental flock were detected using the chi-square test. 16S bacterial metagenomes are publicly available at MG-RAST with metagenome identification numbers 4579001.3\u20134579008.3. five two-week old healthy contact birds were placed on the farms. no specific permits were required for the collection of the diagnostic samples by company veterinarians in the field. care and handling of contact birds was in accordance with the IACUC guidelines and the SEPRL approved Animal Use Proposal FY2014\u201302. multiple MagMax extractions were performed using a KingFisher instrument. total viral RNA was precipitated via sodium acetate/ethanol precipitation. cDNA was ligated to the included EcoRI/NotI double-stranded oligonucleotide adapter and sephacryl-column purified to remove excess adapters to select for cDNA size (>500bp) d contact bird metagenome was uploaded to the MG-RAST metagenomics analysis server [30] and subjected to the stringent MG-RAST quality pipeline. d contact bird metagenome was subjected to the stringent MG-RAST quality pipeline. the method consisted of duplicate read inferred sequencing error estimation (DRISEE), a method to estimate sequencing error that is independent of the high-throughput sequencing platform used [31]. chimeric sequences were identified with usearch [39] and ChimeraSlayer in mothur [40]. taxonomic classification was performed with the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) nave Bayesian classifier [41] v2.6 and the EMBL taxonomy from v115 of the Silva project curated seed database. results and Discussion Clustering of 16S rRNA sequence data from each flock using CCA revealed the bacterial communities associated with the MSPF flock to be distinct from each of the experimental flocks. this result likely reflects the higher biosecurity conditions under which the MSPF flock was maintained compared to the commercial or back yard settings in which the sentinel birds were placed. the back yard (BY) flock was over-represented by members of the Coprobacillus genus, a group of bacteria that have only recently been detected. the VG flock was the only flock with significant over-representation by members of the Clostridium XIVb cluster, and members of the Robinsoniella and Lactonifactor genera were under-represented in only the CAB and DM flocks. ractor 0.90 1.18 0.92 Robinsoniella 0.81 1 Proportions shown in bold indicate significant over-representation for a sentinel group relative to the pre-contact MSPF group. ratios shown in italics indicate significant under-representation for a sentinel group:pre-contact MSPF birds. members of the Leviviridae (+ssRNA phages) were also noted in some flocks. the Leviviridae have been noted previously in the enteric RNA viral metagenome from turkeys. the rotavirus infections correlated with the presence of several bacterial Families, including members of the Clostridiaceae and the Eubacteriaceae. the avian astroviruses\u2014chicken astrovirus and avian nephritis virus specifically\u2014correlated weakly with the Clostridiaceae and Ruminococcaceae. two sets of sentinel birds, placed on flocks NG and BY, had viral reads with homology to the avian coronaviruses (order Nidovirales) coronaviral reads comprised just a small percentage of the viral reads in the NG flock. avian enteric picornaviruses have been described in birds in Hungary [21,67]. a recent metagenomic analysis of the turkey gut viral metagenome has been noted in all avian PBVs to date. the genogroups in the present analysis all appear to be members of the PBV genogroup I. the bacterial communities associated with the MSPF flock were distinct from each of the experimental flocks. the majority (>70%) of sequences classified as Lachnospiracae incertae sedis belonged to the genera Blautia or Ruminoccus. compared to pre-contact birds, each of the sentinel bird groups had genera specifically under-represented in their intestines. the GT, BY, and NG flocks each had significant over-representation by the Blautia genus, while the CAB flock was the only flock with significantly more Lactobacillus spp. reads. summed across all samples are excluded for clarity. comparisons of Genera Significantly Over- or Under-Represented in Each group of Sentinel Birds. the presence of the phage Propionibacterium phage PA6 (a member of the Siphoviridae family) correlated strongly with the presence of members of the Lachnospiraceae family of bacteria and with members of the Clostridium cluster XIVa. avian leukosis virus (ALV) was also noted in some flocks. the avian astroviruses and rotaviruses have been implicated in poultry enteric disease for decades. the rotavirus infections correlated with the presence of several bacterial Families, including members of the Clostridiaceae and the Eubacteriaceae. the avian astroviruses are almost ubiquitous constituent of the poultry gut. flocks showed homology to the calicivirus chicken/V0021/Bayern/2004. designation means specific (or specified) pathogens of concern are routinely assayed for. biosecurity of the flock reflects the need to exclude these pathogens. turkey enteric coronavirus polyprotein gene 1ab is a respiratory disease in chickens. it can affect other tissues and replicate in the intestines without causing outward disease signs in birds. three sets of sentinels from flocks DM, TR, and NG had small numbers of viral reads with homology to the avian picobirnaviruses. enteric avian enteric picornaviruses play in enteric disease and production loss is unclear at this time. the present analysis supports earlier insight into the diversity of the picornaviruses in the chicken gut and the potential for the chicken to be a reservoir for the avian picornaviruses in general. metagenomic/community-level analysis can be applied to diagnose animal disease through the identification of disease- or low performance-associated microbes.
