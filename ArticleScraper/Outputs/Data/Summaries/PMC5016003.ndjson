{"summary": "the five technical documents reviewed recommend that the CSD cleaning area should have a negative differential ambient air pressure, but scientific articles on the impact of this intervention were not found. there is evidence of aerosol formation during cleanup activities in the central service department. there are reports of aerosolization of other microorganisms such as fungi, Clostridium difficile and Staphilococcus aureus 4 - 5. the droplets that are larger than 5m remain suspended for a few seconds. the liquid portion can evaporate, depending on the environmental conditions, resulting in aerosols. differential ambient air pressure means that there is a difference in measuring the relative air pressure between two areas. this parameter works to provide a positive or negative pressure within a particular area in order to prevent air from migrating from one to the other. if a room has a negative air pressure it means that the air supply is less than the exhaustion 6. a consultation of experts in the field of air treatment methods in health system was held with the clinical engineers and professionals from the Brazilian Association of Refrigeration, air conditioning and heating. the documents were accessed through the websites of organizations such as the national health surveillance agency (ANVISA), CDC and the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). the controlled descriptors of MESH were primarily used in a single search box. access to Embase was restricted in the country at the time of data collection. the search was carried out between March and April 2015. a final table with all the relevant data extracted from the studies was prepared. the risk of bias was assessed according to the design of each study. results Five technical documents and four scientific articles were analyzed. the technical documents analyzed 6, 9 - 12 advocate that the reception area, and the cleaning and separation of CSD materials should have a negative differentiation ambient air pressure relative to adjacent areas (min 2,5Pa) there is no consensus on the number of air changes per hour, as well as on the dilution method for the elimination of pathogens. air samples above the water surface in the washer tank were collected. air samples from surfaces on nine points around the washer were collected. the ultrasonic cleaner should be used with the lid to minimize release of aerosols. the size of aerosols generated after the use of a pressurized automatic washer and cleaning with stiff bristle brush were compared. the wall was infected one day prior to the collection of air samples. the wall was infected one day prior to the collection of air samples. the authors used three gauges of particle sizes not aiming to identify microorganisms in aerosols. it was observed that when used in higher pressurization (efficient method), more and smaller particles were identified (up to 2m) there is a consensus of the need for negative pressure air in cleaning and decontamination areas of the MD in CSD. the directive corresponds to the norms of the RDC ANVISA 15/2012 7 where it is stated that in class II CSD a negative differential ambient air pressure (minimum 2,5Pa) should be kept between adjacent areas. negative pressure air efficiency in isolation rooms was demonstrated in the study by Adams, Johnson and Lynch 17. the air pressure differentials were measured between the room and the anteroom. the average in the aerosol count per m3 where larger when there were greater movement of people and doors, however the aerosol score decreased as the air pressure differential increased. bronchoscopy is a procedure recognized for its potential to generate aerosols. but the contamination level returned to baseline values after cleaning procedures. it took fifteen minutes to the bioaerosols levels to return to baseline. in the studies included in this review 13, 16, it was shown that using pressurized water cleaning devices generate more aerosol when compared to conventional methods (brushing and low pressurization of water) the pressurized water guns are used for crude dirt cleaning. contamination of water and air by Legionella pneumophila was evaluated. it was identified that the strains detected in aerosols were of the same subtype of the samples of shower water and hot tap water 15. this study has limitations regarding the collection of data because there has been no standardization of the number of samples, time and air collection instrument. no studies have assessed the risk of disease transmission via aerosols. there were no scientific evidence on occupational diseases related to the cleaning activity in CSD. the use of PPE in CSD is problematic due to the compliance to the use and discomfort reported by the professionals working in this sector 28. advances in scientific knowledge in the control of air pollution in CSD provide theoretical foundations for better understanding of the phenomenon studied. aerosols are generated during cleaning activities and use of devices found in the ultrasonic cleaner and the washer with pressurized water."}
