{"summary": "blood groups are genetically determined traits with known polymorphic expression among individuals and populations. many blood groups are receptors for toxins, parasites, and bacteria. they can facilitate colonization or invasion or evade host clearance mechanisms. bacteria can stimulate antibodies against blood group antigens. malaria has potential interactions with 8 to 9 different blood group systems. this is particularly true of malaria, which has potential interactions with several different blood group systems. 7,000\u201310,000 CD99 012 Xg XG 2 Xp22.33 XG, MIC2 Adhesion molecule 200\u20132,000 \u2014 013 Scianna SC 7 1p34.2 ERMAP Unknown. unknown CD297 014 Dombrock DO 8 12p12.3 ART4 ADP-ribosyltransferase Unknown, likely raft associated. 5,000 CD147 024 Ok OK 3 19p13.3 BSG Basigin, RBC trafficking and senescence, cytophilin receptor, cell adhesion and signaling 3,000 CD151 025 Raph RAPH 1 11p15.5 CD151 Tetraspanin, cell adhesion Unknown, likely raft associated CD108 026 John Milton Hagen JMH 6 15q24.1 SEMA7A T-cell-mediated inflammation, integrin receptor (11) Unknown, likely this review is organized by blood group system, based on commonalities in blood group structure and disease associations. the first half of the review focuses on the carbohydrate-based blood groups ABO, Lewis and Secretor, and globo-related antigens (P1, Pk, and LKE) the H antigen is formed by the addition of an 1-2 fucose (blue diamonds) by FUT1 or H-glycosyltransferase. group A individuals express an 1-3 N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal) (red trapezoid), group B individuals express an 1-3 galactose (Gal) (orange circles) the Bombay phenotype lacks H, A, and B antigens due to 6 43.9 S+ 45 69 55 55 94 44.7 Henshaw 0 3 6\u201327 0 0 Mi.III 0.1 0.1 NA NA 6 NA Diego Di(a+) 0.01 0.01 2\u201354 4\u201310 NA 2, 9, 21\u201323, 29 Duffy Fy(a+b) 17 9 3 33 93 42.1 2, 8, 12, 14, 15, 17, 24, 29 Fy(a+b+) 49 1 1 27 7 4.5 Fy(a+b+) group O person possesses both anti-A and anti-B. group AB, which expresses both antigens, is negative for ABO antibodies. clinically, the forward and reverse grouping results must match for a blood type to be determined (1, 28). several genetic, developmental, and clinical conditions can affect ABO typing. in many epithelial tissues, ABO expression is heavily dependent on the inheritance of the Secretor/FUT2 gene. 20% of group A individuals belong to the A2 subgroup. gene, an 1,2-fucosyltransferase that adds a terminal fucose to lactosamine to form Fuc1-2Gal1-4GlcNAc-R. H antigen can then serve as a substrate for ABO, which adds either an N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal) (A antigen) or galactose (Gal) (B antigen), in an 1-3 linkage, to the same subterminal type 1 chain synthesis is highly regulated and can be downregulated in response to inflammation and neoplastic transformation (34, 35). er Pig red cells, intestine +/ + 2 Fuc1 O-glycanf A, H active Fuc12Gal13GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr Gastric mucosa (ALeb) + 6 Fuc1 O-glycanf A, H active Fuc12Gal13GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr Gastric mucosa (ALeb) both FUT1 and FUT2 are capable of synthesizing type 3 H, type 4 H, and H-GM1 glycolipids. synthesis is tissue restricted, with strong expression in fluids and respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tissues.

CTx holotoxin is a hexameric protein complex composed of five B subunits and a single A subunit (AB5). multivalent binding is believed to recruit GM1 into lipid rafts. GM1 constitutes only 1% of total ganglioside and 0.01% of all the GSLs in the human small intestine. hLT is a classic AB5 multimeric toxin with 80% sequence homology to CTx (106) the identification of a second binding site on hLT led to the hypothesis that group A, B, and AB individuals may be protected from severe cholera through adsorption of CTx by A/B-active glycoconjugates. however, only hLT binds BLeY (119) b Thr47 associated with BLeY binding is highlighted in boldface type. the mutant was not tested clinically but is hypothesized to lack ABO specificity relative to disease severity. hLT and CTx of the classical biotype can bind leY, ALeY, and BLeY. hLT and CTx of the classical biotype can bind leY, with no apparent ABO preference. hLT can bind leY, with no apparent ABO preference. the level of hLT binding to group AB rabbit intestine was 4-fold higher than that in group H rabbits (48.7 versus 11.4 fmol/g protein) hLT binding to AB glycoconjugates was able activate adenylate cyclase with fluid secretion. hLT binding to AB glycoconjugates was enhanced by papain digestion, suggesting possible GSL receptors (116). ri et al. found a higher incidence of diarrhea in group A, B, and AB children (P = 0.02 to 0.03) (126), analogous to the results with rabbits. ri et al. also examined the role of the Lewis phenotype and ETEC infection. lori is located within the mucin layer in close proximity (25 m) to the foveolar gastric epithelium. the foveolar epithelium secretes the mucin 5AC (MUC5AC), the major constituent of the surface mucous layer. analysis of surface O-glycans shows predominantly fucosylated, branched-core 2 O-glycans bearing ABO-active epitopes. it took another 5 years to isolate the H. pylori fucose binding lectin BabA (134), a 78-kDa glycosylated protein. most of these strains are \u201cgeneralists,\u201d capable of binding to (O)Leb, ALeb, and BLeb (135). several studies have examined the role of host ABO type in H. pylori infection. patients with gastric and duodenal ulcers were more likely to belong to group O (141\u2013143) the impact of Lewis and Secretor types on H. pylori risk is modest, despite early studies showing an increased incidence of ulcers among nonsecretors (142, 157). the impact of Lewis and Secretor types on H. pylori risk is modest. the results of past studies may be hampered by the method and sample used for Lewis and Secretor typing. discrepancies between gastric Lewis expression and genotype were well documented. in the united states, there are an estimated 2.5 million cases of Campylobacter infection per year. most individuals exposed to C. jejuni remain asymptomatic, with only 1% developing clinical enteritis (163). invasive C. jejuni strains can induce mucosal damage by stimulating the synthesis of proinflammatory mediators. lectins and monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against type 2 chain epitopes (H-2; LeY) were able to inhibit C. jejuni adhesion in both cell cultures and Western blots. the preference of pathogenic strains for type 2 H antigen may explain the colonization of the lower gastrointestinal tract. mice fed fucosylated human milk oligosaccharides or 2\u2032-fucosyllactose were relatively protected from C. jejuni colonization. similar results were observed in a transgenic mouse strain, which selectively secretes H antigen in breast milk. the prevalence of the nonsecretor phenotype was increased among patients with Gram-negative sepsis. a nonsecretor status is also linked to Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder with altered microflora. PA-IIL are homotetrameric proteins composed of single subunits of 12.7 kDa and 11.7 kDa. both adhesins are capable of agglutinating human red cells. PA-IL shows slightly stronger agglutination against group B red cells and Pk and P1 red cells. antigens with terminal fucose epitopes, including leb and leY, are relatively inactive (181) mapping studies indicate that PA-IIL binds fucose along a shallow groove and is highly dependent on van der Waals interactions between PA-IA and the C-5 methyl group of fucose (182). the recognition of A epitopes is inconsistent with either PA-IL and PA-IIL. there has been considerable interest in the potential role of ABO and Lewis types in cystic fibrosis patients. between 1932 and 1968, 20 studies on ABO types in patients with pharyngitis (190, 191), scarlatina (192\u2013194) and rheumatic heart disease (191) were reported, with most studies showing a trend between streptococcal disease and a non-group O status. group B Streptococcus is a major pathogen in newborns and is generally acquired during labor. there was a higher rate of tonsillectomy among nonsecretors. there was no correlation between ABO group and carrier status. LLY is not specific to S. mitis strains and was identified in strains of S. pneumoniae, S. pseudopneumoniae, and S. mitis/S. oralis. toxicity of LLY is variable between platelet donors, suggesting host-specific differences. alylated type 2 chain antigens (NeuAc2-3Gal1-4GlcNAc-R) via an L-lectin-type domain in the molecule (203) hypothesized that sialic acid adhesion to platelets plays a role in endocarditis caused by S. aureus and viridans group streptococci. one group implicated the lea antigen as a receptor for some S. aureus strains. lea was detected in 63/71 (71%) specimens tested (206), which is a higher rate than that observed for adults (54). study subjects included 156 individuals with persistent nasal carriage and 77 pharyngeal carriers. in 1349, this region was decimated by a severe outbreak of plague. a comparison of individuals interred in the 1300s and those interred in the 1600s showed a significant decrease in the prevalence of group O (59% to 39%; P = 0.01) Candida can recognize stratherin, hydroxyapatite, and RGD-containing proteins. Candida species also possess lectin-like adhesins. one of the best-studied Candida adhesins is the fucose binding lectin. Candida vaginitis is a common disorder among women. 75% of all women experience at least once episode of vulvovaginitis. 5 to 10% of women suffering recurrent infections (221) FUT2 is expressed by endocervical glands and ectocervical squamous cells. in FUT2-null mice, there is a selective loss of H-active mucins. mucins with Lea and LeX activity are still synthesized. early small studies reported an increased rate of carriage among group O individuals (231, 232), although this was not substantiated in subsequent studies (233\u2013235). nonsecretor status was identified as a risk factor for chronic hyperplastic candidosis (68% versus 38%) among nonbacterial gastrointestinal illnesses, 50 to 67% of all foodborne illnesses, and 40% of all epidemic outbreaks of gastrointestinal illnesses. the presence of host factors has long been suspected. controlled studies with volunteers also supported the presence of nonimmune host defense factors. viral capsids prefer type 1 H and Leb over type 2 chain H-active substrates. no binding to related lea and leX antigens has also been demonstrated. secretor may play a protective role in infant diarrhea due to norovirus. animal studies with human norovirus strains show viral tropism for enterocytes along the tips of intestinal villi of the duodenum and proximal small intestine (250) this correlates well with developmental changes in ABH expression during enterocyte maturation. GII strains possess slightly different lectin sites along the VP1 protein (256) crystallography studies with GII strains show extensive interactions between VP1, fucose, and either Gal (type 1 H) or the terminal GalNAc (type 1 A) (256). absence of detectable binding to group B antigen is attributed to the absence of an N-acetyl group. BH groups could play a role in the global dissemination of virus strains. oysters, mussels, and clams are able to bind norovirus via blood group A antigens on gastrointestinal epithelial cells. pigs also express A and H antigens (37, 113, 250, 265) rotavirus is highly polymorphic, with 35 known P or capsid genotypes that display species-specific infectivity (269). three P genotypes (P4, P8, and P6) are responsible for the vast majority of human infections (71%) (270). rotavirus can infect mammals, including monkeys, birds, cows, pigs, goats, canines, and antelopes. studies with a recombinant VP8* capsid protein show blood group specificity against saliva, mucins, and commercial glycoconjugates (269). VP8* recognized a antigen along the GalNAc1-3Gal backbone, with no fucose interaction; the latter was orientated perpendicularly and away from the capsid. there are few reported studies on the impact of host blood types on rotavirus infection. HIV is an enveloped retrovirus that can adopt a host glycan profile. the Env glycoprotein gp120 possesses 25 N-glycan sites. the types of N-glycans expressed can range from high-mannose, intermediate hybrids to mature, complex N-glycans. antibodies against blood group A and LeY inhibited HIV infection in a dose-dependent fashion, with 80% virus inhibition at micromolar concentrations. a retrospective 16-year study of 271,000 Brazilian blood donors reported a slightly higher incidence of HIV among group B donors (286). women were more likely to be Se+ (86% versus 72%), even after adjusting for coinfection by other sexually transmitted diseases. a nonsecretor phenotype appears to provide mild protection against heterosexual HIV transmission. one caveat with the Senegalese study was the reliance on allele-specific PCR for a single FUT2 polymorphism (se428) the original SARS outbreak in the winter of 2002 to 2003 infected >8,000 individuals worldwide, with a fatality rate of 10% (292). in a Hong Kong outbreak, there was an apparent association between disease transmission and ABO type (293) studies with human anti-A showed effective blocking with higher-titer anti-A (1:256) only; low-titer anti-A was ineffective (292) the latter finding has implications for individuals in industrialized countries, who tend to have low ABO titers. the incidence of le(b+) in patients with influenza A or B virus infection was 86%, versus 72% among controls. avian strains prefer terminal NeuAc2-6Gal epitopes, which are richly expressed along the upper respiratory tract. influenza virus pathogenicity is moderated by changes in cell surface sialylation. strains that preferentially recognize sLeX epitopes have been described. serti and Dzik carefully examined the incidences of ABO types relative to malaria. the incidence of group O reaches 87 to 90%, with 10% of the population being typed as group A. group A predominates among northern european populations who are not exposed to malaria. three large genomic studies involving nearly 6,000 patients confirmed that group O is an independent genetic factor that decreases the risk of severe malaria. a small study of 198 Gambian mothers reported an inverse relationship between ABO type, malaria, and parity. throcyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) proteins expressed on malaria-infected red cells. all strains that recognize A/B antigens share the same DB11-CDR1 amino-terminal head region (330) Schistosomiasis Schistosomes are trematodes or flukes that require freshwater snails as an intermediate host. it is estimated that 200 million people worldwide are afflicted with schistosomiasis. group A individuals express an 1-2 fucose (blue diamonds) by FUT1 or H-glycosyltransferase. group A individuals express an 1-3 N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) group B individuals express an 1-3 galactose (Gal) (orange circles) and group B individuals express an 1-3 galactose (Gal) (orange circles) the Bombay phenotype lacks H, A, and B antigens due to null FUT1 alleles. ABO is unique among all human blood groups in that it requires the typing of both red cells and plasma or serum (Table 3) (1, 28). in forward or red cell typing, red cells are typed for expression of A and B antigens on red cells by hemagglutination using monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. f Bombay Oh is a rare autosomal-recessive phenotype due to amorph FUT1 (hh) and FUT2/Secretor (se/se/se/se) 20% of group A individuals belong to the A2 subgroup. ABO is markedly depressed on newborn red cells due to developmental delays in I blood group gene expression. newborns lack ABO antibodies for the first 4 to 6 months of life. oligosaccharide backbone contributes to ABH recognition by antibodies. genitourinary and gastrointestinal epithelial cells are rich in type 1 chain structures. type 1 chain ABH antigens are also found in fluids and secretions. cNAcRc + + 2 Fuc1 Type 1, ALeb GalNAc13Gal13GlcNAcR + /0 + + 2 4 Fuc1 Fuc1 Type 2 A (A-2) GalNAc13Gal14GlcNAcR + + 2 3 Fuc1 Fuc1 Type 3 A (A-3)d (mucinous A), GalNAc13Gal13Gal13Gal14GlcCer + 0 + + 2 2 c, fucose; galactose; galactose; galNAc, N-acetylgalactosamine; glc, glucose; glcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine. c R, upstream sequence of various sizes, may be expressed on the glycoprotein or glycosphingolipid. e Found as glycosphingolipids only. Lewis synthesis is tissue restricted, with strong expression in fluids and respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tissues (35). there are two Lewis antigens (Lea and Leb) and four potential Lewis red cell phenotypes, although only three types are considered common. lea is synthesized by FUT3/Lewis, which adds an 1-4 fucose to the subterminal GlcNAc of the type 1 chain precursor (LeC) leb cannot be synthesized directly from Lea due to steric blocking by 1-4 fucose. once formed, leb can serve as a substrate for FUT3/Lewis. phenotype reflects inheritance of functional FUT3/Lewis gene and two null FUT2/Secretor (se/se) genes. le(a+b) individuals are always secretors of ABH and Lewis antigens. phenotype is a FUT3/Lewis-null phenotype. antigens in blood and secretions by Western blotting or by hemagglutination inhibition assays (HAI) using saliva. the latter involves preincubation of saliva with anti-A/B antibodies. in presence of soluble ABH antigens, anti-A/B is neutralized. ABO and other cell surface Glycoconjugates ABO is a terminal modification. the presence of fucose stops further chain elongation as well as branching. the presence of fucose stops further chain elongation as well as branching. bombay are rare autosomal-recessive phenotypes due homozygosity for two FUT1-null alleles (h/h) both phenotypes lack type 2 chain ABH antigens on red cells. individuals with para-Bombay phenotype still express type 1 chain ABH in secretions, intestinal mucosa, and other tissues. the se428 allele is also common among africans, Iranians, and Turks (2, 51). in china and neighboring Asian countries, Se385 (Ile129Phe) is the predominate SeW allele. the ABO gene resides on chromosome 9q34.1 and contains 7 exons, which encode a 354-aa glycoprotein. group O alleles belonging to the O1 family contain a deletion in exon 6 leading to a frameshift and a premature stop codon. Alleles belonging to the O1 family share a nucleotide deletion (G261; fs88stop118) and account for 95% of all group O alleles (2). heterozygous inheritance (for example, A1/O1) does not affect ABO expression on red cells. gene is located on chromosome 19p13.3 as a cluster of three related glycosyltransferases, FUT5-FUT3-FUT6 (65). strongest FUT3 mRNA expression is observed in the trachea, intestine, bladder, and lower female reproductive tract (35). a study of cystic fibrosis patients relied on 4 SNPs common in Caucasians and many other populations. some le alleles have an apparently greater effect on Lewis GSL synthesis. some le alleles have an apparently greater effect on Lewis GSL synthesis. both phenotypes lack type 2 chain ABH antigens on red cells. individuals with the para-Bombay phenotype still express type 1 chain ABH in secretions, intestinal mucosa, and other tissues due to an active FUT2 gene. individuals with the para-Bombay phenotype are also nonsecretors (se/se) and therefore have no ABH synthesis on cells or in secretions. se385 (Ile129Phe) is the predominate SeW allele (52\u201354) in china and neighboring countries. individuals with a SeW/se genotype are particularly at risk for having a nonsecretor phenotype. group O alleles belonging to the O1 family share a nucleotide deletion. Alleles belonging to the O2 family share a mutation at aa 268. a comparison of A1 and B consensus alleles shows they are essentially identical. alleles carry a G802A mutation, leading to Gly268Arg. heterozygous inheritance (for example, A1/O1) does not affect ABO expression on red cells but can be associated with weaker ABO expression on other tissues. the strongest FUT3 mRNA expression is observed in the trachea, intestine, bladder, and lower female reproductive tract (35). a majority of le alleles (33/37; 89%) have at least two SNPs, and many alleles contain four or more. some le alleles have an apparently greater effect on Lewis GSL synthesis. le59 (Leu20Arg) leads to a loss of Lewis GSL in plasma (and, therefore, red cells) but retains weak Lewis expression on intestinal glycoproteins. most children acquire a normal \u201cadult-type\u201d microbiome by 1 year of age (80) Bacteria, particularly Gram-negative intestinal flora, appear to be the primary immune stimuli underlying their development. in a survey of 282 Gram-negative organisms, activity was detected in 137 organisms (49%).

Cholergenoid (B5) is composed of the five B subunits (CTx-B) and is not biologically active. the B subunits recognize GSL receptors on the intestinal epithelium. the A1 subunit activates adenylate cyclase, with the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and induction of secretory diarrhea. hLT is a classic AB5 multimeric toxin with 80% sequence homology to CTx (106) unlike CTx, hLT recognizes GM1 as its physiologic cell receptor. hLT can bind complex GSLs and glycoproteins with blood group A and AB activity (112\u2013116) the inability of El Tor CTx to bind BLeY was attributed to a Thr47Ile polymorphism in the leY binding site. it is believed that classical V. cholerae O139 (Bengal) also displays group O specificity due to the same Thr47Ile polymorphism (119). b Thr47 associated with BLeY binding is highlighted in boldface type. mutant was not tested clinically but hypothesized to lack ABO specificity relative to disease severity. hLT binding to AB glycoconjugates was 4-fold higher than that in group H rabbits. hLT binding to AB glycoconjugates was able activate adenylate cyclase with fluid secretion. hLT binding to AB glycoconjugates was able activate adenylate cyclase with fluid secretion. toxin binding was enhanced by papain digestion, suggesting possible GSL receptors (116) this was confirmed by the isolation of rabbit intestinal GSLs, which showed hLT binding to A- and AB-active GSLs but not group H GSLs (115). hLT binding to HMW, A-active glycolipids from human red cells and group A pigs was also observed. pylori infects the gastric epithelium and is a cause of chronic gastritis. chronic infection and inflammation can lead to intestinal metaplasia, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric lymphoma. of 70 O-glycans characterized, 30 to 50% express H and/or Leb epitopes. the highest density is found for group O individuals (48). colostrum rich in leb, but not Lea, inhibited H. pylori binding to the gastric epithelium by 78%. BabA does not bind Lea, LeX, or LeY, a difucosylated type 2 antigen with H activity (133). many H. pylori strains can express adhesins that recognize sialic acid (SabA), lipoproteins (AlpA and AlpB), and sulfated glycans (132). lori immune status has also been reported in several small studies of patients undergoing endoscopy (138, 144\u2013146). a second study also reported an increased number of group O and A2 individuals among H. pylori-infected individuals (138). a later study compared histology and secretor status in 84 endoscopy patients with confirmed H. pylori infection (159) a nonsecretor phenotype was associated with more inflammation and higher grades of lymphocyte (P = 0.01) and neutrophil (P = 0.012) infiltration. a later study found an association between nonsecretor status and H. pylori in newly delivered mothers (160). campylobacter jejuni is a flagellated, Gram-negative, thermophilic, microaerophilic bacterium and a common cause of foodborne illness in industrialized countries. in the united states, there are an estimated 2.5 million cases of Campylobacter infection per year. most outbreaks are linked to consumption of contaminated poultry. earliest studies showed high concentrations of free fucose were capable of inhibiting C. jejuni in INT407 intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. breast milk, which is rich in fucosylated oligosaccharides, is protective against C. jejuni infection in breastfed infants. pathogenic strains for type 2 H antigen may explain colonization of lower gastrointestinal tract. low levels of type 2 ABH antigens can be detected on jejunal GSLs and glycoproteins (168, 169), with stronger expression in group O, Lewis-null individuals (168, 714) tizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a disease of premature infants (weighing 1,500 g) it usually occurs within the first 2 weeks of life and is characterized by bowel inflammation and necrosis. it is characterized by bowel inflammation and necrosis, with evidence of a disturbed intestinal microbiota. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an aerobic, Gram-negative bacterium widely found in the environment. this organism possesses multiple virulence factors, including lectin-type adhesins, a mucoid polysaccharide, proteases, and exotoxin A, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. studies indicate that PA-IL possesses a disaccharide binding site with strong binding to P1- and B-active glycans. PA-IL is also capable of recognizing the terminal -galactosidase (Gal) on type 1 and type 2 chain precursors. the hydroxyl groups on C-2, C-3, and C-4 of fucose also contribute to binding through electrostatic interactions with calcium ions, water, and PA-IIL. clinical evidence is weak, at best, and may involve additional adhesins. mice, both intrabronchial fucose and mannose decreased pulmonary toxicity and improved survival following P. aeruginosa pneumonia 187. a registry study of 808 patients examined ABO, Se/FUT2 and Le/FUT3 genotypes and disease outcomes. eight studies also typed patients for secretor status by using HAI assays. there is a slight increase in the prevalence of the nonsecretor status among patients. 11% of 1,062 mothers were culture positive for group B Streptococcus. no correlation was found in an Ohio study that included 50% african Americans or in a prospective case-control study. there was considerable interest in a possible correlation between secretor status and rheumatic fever. between 1932 and 1968, 20 studies on secretor types were reported. rheumatic fever/heart disease patients had slightly increased risk. there was a higher rate of tonsillectomy among nonsecretors. no correlation between ABO group and carrier status. group B Streptococcus is a major pathogen in newborns. LLY is not specific to S. mitis strains and was identified in strains of S. pneumoniae, S. pseudopneumoniae, and S. mitis/S. oralis. toxicity of LLY is variable between platelet donors, suggesting host-specific differences. 27 kDa was shown to recognize sialylated type 2 chain antigens (NeuAc2-3Gal1-4GlcNAc-R) via an L-lectin-type domain in the molecule (203) it has been hypothesized that sialic acid adhesion to platelets plays a role in endocarditis caused by S. aureus and viridans group streptococci (203, 204) study subjects included 156 individuals with persistent nasal carriage and 77 pharyngeal carriers. pharyngeal colonization was uncommon among secretors (Se+). indirect evidence cited was the relatively low incidence of group O in areas spared from severe plague outbreaks in medieval times. anthropology studies showed a shift in ABO frequencies over several centuries. in 1349, this region was decimated by a severe outbreak of plague, which killed 37% of the population. the potential role of blood groups in Candida infection has been the subject of several epidemiological studies. Candida can recognize stratherin, hydroxyapatite, and RGD-containing proteins such as fibronectin and fibrinogen. Candida vaginitis is a common disorder among women. 75% of all women experience at least once episode of vulvovaginitis. 5 to 10% of women suffering recurrent infections (221) secretors is 2.52 (95% CI, 1.84 to 34.5; P = 0.0001) there was no significant correlation between Candida and ABO type (223, 224). in FUT2-null mice, there is a selective loss of H-active mucins. early small studies reported an increased rate of carriage among group O individuals (231, 232), although this was not substantiated in subsequent studies. nonsecretor status was also identified as a risk factor for chronic hyperplastic candidosis (68% versus 38%) the adhesin was characterized as a 15.7-kDa protein of 152 amino acids. the adhesin was characterized as a 15.7-kDa protein of 152 amino acids (219) Candida vaginitis is a common disorder among women. studies have reported an association between Candida vaginitis and Secretor/FUT2. there was no attempt to determine secretor type by genotyping or testing of saliva. secretor status was determined by HAI assays using patient saliva. FUT2-null mice showed a 3-fold increase in total fungal burden over wild-type controls (226, 227) this increase could be eliminated by intravaginal administration of H-active mucins or by surgical removal of the cervix through hysterectomy (227). yeast was isolated in 24/45 patients with duodenal ulcers. yeast was isolated in 24/45 patients with C. albicans. yeast was isolated in 24/45 patients with C. albicans. norovirus empty capsids strongly agglutinated human RBC from group O, A, and AB donors but not group B or rare Bombay cells (Oh) (242). authors reexamined serum samples from 51 volunteers previously exposed to norovirus to compare donor ABO types with symptomatic infection and immune responsiveness. virus binds saliva from group O and A secretors but not saliva from nonsecretors or group B individuals. at least five studies demonstrated a role for Secretor in host susceptibility in human subjects. in a nursing home outbreak, 97% of all affected patients were genotyped as Se+. undifferentiated Caco-2 cells express type 2 chain H antigen. the epithelium shows a loss of tight junctions, anion secretion, apoptosis, and villus blunting. the norovirus capsid is an icosahedron composed of 90 dimers of the VP1 capsid protein. group O Le(b+) secretors are clearly more susceptible to GI strains than are individuals with other blood types (43, 243, 244) GII strains infect secretors, regardless of ABO type (247, 249, 258) in Nicaragua, GII strains were present in 74% of infected children. rotavirus Rotavirus is a nonenveloped, double-stranded RNA virus. it is a major cause of acute infectious diarrhea. 75% of children show humoral immunity by 5 to 6 years of age. rotavirus strains tend to recognize sialic acid, including strains specific for N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc), a sialic acid variant found in many animal species but absent in humans. rotavirus capsid is composed of two major proteins, VP4 and VP7 (272). VP4 forms the major spike protein responsible for host recognition and binding. there are few reported studies on the impact of host blood types on rotavirus infection. in immortalized cell lines, there is a clear correlation between ABO expression, VP genotype, and infectivity (271). rotavirus replication is inhibited by human milk and jejunum mucins, which are rich in ABH epitopes (271). some HIV and gp120 isolates can react with blood group-active monoclonal antibodies and lectins. aBH-active HIV can also be produced by propagating HIV in lymphocytes of a known ABO type (280, 281). negative cell lines were partially neutralized by ABO-incompatible serum (groups O and B) but not by group A serum or heat-inactivated serum (280). a retrospective 16-year study of 271,000 Brazilian blood donors reported a slightly higher incidence of HIV among group B donors. there has been some interest in the role of Secretor in HIV progression and infection, especially heterosexual HIV transmission. the nonsecretor phenotype was overrepresented only among men with long-term asymptomatic disease (66.7% versus 21%; P 0.001) one investigator proposed that the le(b+) phenotype might actually be protective against HIV infection. group O individuals were relatively resistant to infection, with an OR of 0.18 (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.81; P = 0.03) group O individuals were relatively resistant to infection, with an OR of 0.18 (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.81; P = 0.03) influenza is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA orthomyxovirus (295) za Viruses Influenza virus is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA orthomyxovirus (295) strains are responsible for most pandemic outbreaks, including the 1918 Spanish flu and the 2009 H5N1 outbreak. studies of animal and human strains show that virus binding is dependent on the neuraminic acid type (NeuAc or NeuGc) and the glycosidic linkage (2-3 or 2-6). avian strains prefer terminal NeuAc2-6Gal epitopes, which are richly expressed along the upper respiratory tract of humans. influenza virus strains that preferentially recognize sLeX epitopes have been described (300, 303) Plasmodium falciparum Plasmodium falciparum is a parasitic protozoan transmitted by anopheles mosquitoes (310) this organism initially infects the liver, followed by the release of merozoites and infection of red cells. early studies concluded that ABO type played no role in malaria. no correlation between ABO type, malaria incidence, parasite density, and immune response. more recent studies have focused on ABO type and the risk of severe malaria. study of 198 Gambian mothers reported inverse relationship with group O. group O primiparae were at an increased risk of active placental malaria (OR, 2.18; P = 0.02) recombinant DBL1 binds human RBC in an ABO-specific fashion. binding is inversely related to H expression (A1 > A2, and B > Ax > O; R = 0.67; P = 0.001). heparin can disrupt rosetting, possibly by inducing conformational changes. it is estimated that 200 million people worldwide are afflicted with schistosomiasis. there are reports suggesting a link between blood group A and increased susceptibility to schistosoma infections, particularly S. mansoni. the resulting antibody recognized the P1 blood group antigen, which was expressed on most, but not all, human red cells. over the last 15 years, the glycosyltransferases necessary for the synthesis of Pk, P, and P1 antigens have been cloned. the P blood group has now expanded into three blood group systems and six serologic antigens. most members of the \u201cP family\u201d are globo-family GSLs. this family includes Pk (globotriaosylceramide [Gb3]), P (globoside [Gb4]), Gb5, LKE (monosialylgalactosylgloboside [MSGG] [SSEA-4]), NOR, and Forssman antigens. the synthesis of long-chain globo-GSLs requires the synthesis of Gb5 by 3GalT5, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of both Gb5 and lacto-family GSLs. both FUT1 and FUT2 appear to be capable of fucosylating Gb5 (38\u201340), although FUT2 likely predominate in genitourinary tissue. a related globo-GSL can be observed in 10% of platelet donors (band 0.03; Gal1-4\u2013Gb5) and is associated with increased Gb3 synthesis (350, 351) the Forssman antigen is a common globo-GSL in animals (for example, chickens and sheep) but is absent from humans (352). all human red cells express both Gb3/Pk and Gb4/P antigens. Gb4 is the predominant GSL, representing nearly 10% of the total red cell lipids. 0 +++ 0 0 0 0 0 0 PX2 Anti-PP1Pk (Tja) NOR Rare + + 0 + +++ NA NA +/0 NOR Apae Rare + + + +++ NA NA +/0 Fors a Inheritance of at least one functional glycosyltransferase gene (+). b Incidence in the white population. plex globo-GSLs make potent anti-P that can cause hemolytic transfusion reactions and spontaneous abortion. there are no known physiologic abnormalities associated with the Pk phenotype. there are no known physiologic abnormalities associated with the Pk phenotype. the p phenotype occurs sporadically in many populations and is more frequently encountered than Pk. northern Europe has the highest incidence of p individuals where populations were relatively isolated by geography. p phenotype has been associated with a variety of mutations. p phenotype has been associated with a variety of mutations. p phenotype is red cell specific and is labile during storage at 4\u00b0C. the localized sphingomyelin/GSL content in lipid rafts is 50% higher than that in the rest of the membrane. rafts are resistant to disruption by detergents, leading to the terms \"detergent-resistant membrane,\" \"detergent-insoluble glycolipid complexes\" cholesterol is critical to raft integrity, which acts as a \"filler\" or molecular spacer between sphingolipid molecules. GEMs enriched in globo-GSLs have been identified in several cell types. red cells contain large GEMs rich in Gb4 (386) Gb4- and Gb3-rich GEMs contribute to binding and uptake of Shiga toxins, parvovirus B19, and HIV and inflammatory signaling. 2 binds the lipid A moiety within a deep hydrophobic cavity. it triggers endocytosis of the lipid A complex or activates an MD88-dependent signaling pathway. lipid A acyl chains can alter and temper the inflammatory response to LPS. LPS with fewer acyl chains can evade or block TLR4 signaling due to altered MD2 binding. Ceramide, with only two acyl chains, is sufficiently hydrophobic to block LPS-MD2 binding. TLR4 is most strongly expressed by monocytes, spleen, and placenta. recombinant P-fimbriated E. coli specifically provoked increases in IL-8 and IL-6 levels and pyuria (400) the recombinant P pili are composed of a long heteropolymeric protein fibrillum bearing the PapG adhesin at the fimbrial tip (401) the papG lectin binding domain is relatively large and lies along one side of a folded, \u201cjelly roll\u201d structure (402). a follow-up study with 68 female children with recurrent pyelonephritis again showed an increase in the incidence of P1 in patients with mild reflux (97%; P 0.01) and bacteriuria (68% versus 25%; P 0.001) but not in children with severe reflux (408). no correlation between P1 and recurrent UTI in adult females was reported by Sheinfeld et al. pyelonephritis was associated with a nonsecretor phenotype in premenopausal women only (57% versus 30%; P 0.001) (412) this is consistent with the known epidemiology of E. coli UTI and vaginal colonization in women, which is much more likely to occur during the first half of the menstrual cycle. P-fimbriated E. coli strains can bind a range of globo-GSLs. but quantitative studies with isolated kidney GSLs show a clear preference for the globo-ganglioside MSGG, also known as LKE antigen and SSEA-4 (422). s, but not secretors, by thin-layer chromatography using both an anti-MSGG antibody and radiolabeled P-fimbriated E. coli. the ability of FUT2 to divert Gb5 toward the synthesis of ABH-active globo-GSLs raises the question of whether the host ABO type also affects E. coli adhesion. human anti-A and anti-B failed to agglutinate several E. coli serotypes commonly isolated from E. coli UTIs (428). infections with Shigella dysenteriae type 1 are particularly serious due to copious production of Shiga toxin (Stx) (429). HUS occurs in 5 to 15% of patients, with the highest rate of occurrence being found in young children and the elderly (433). exposure to antibiotics can raise the risk of HUS through increased Stx production and bacterial lysis (433). Stx recognizes GSLs bearing a terminal galabiose or Gal1-4Gal disaccharide (350, 436) these GSLs include P1, Gb3, galabiosylceramide (Gal2Cer) and an extended globo-GSL, \u201cband 0.03\u201d. the latter is a trace GSL, related to MSGG/LKE, found on some platelet donors. Stx binds to a subset of platelets, with platelet activation and the formation of platelet-leukocyte aggregates. Stx1 has a 10-fold-higher binding affinity than does Stx2. other membrane GSLs can alter the sensitivity of tissues to Stx. in epidemic outbreaks, only 20 to 30% of infected individuals develop HUS (433, 435) young children (5 years of age) are more likely to develop HUS than adults and show more diffuse Stx binding to renal glomeruli (435) several small studies compared the incidences of P1/P2 phenotypes in patients with E. coli-associated HUS, with very mixed results. two studies suggest the P1 phenotype may be protective (449, 450) a decrease in the prevalence of group B (16% versus 22%; P 0.05) relative to the normal population. there was no correlation between ABO type and severity of illness or long-term sequelae. human and porcine meningitis are commonly caused by S. suis type 2 (457) strains express a galactose-specific lectin, streptococcal adhesion P (SAdP) (459) the lectin preferentially binds glycans with a terminal Gal1-4Gal disaccharide. p individuals may have enhanced resistance to S. suis, although this has never been shown due to the rarity of the p phenotype in most populations. any future globo-null blood types should be investigated relative to rare globo-null blood types. SEB demonstrates high-affinity binding to renal tubular cells (467) whereas the intestinal mucosa shows scarce weak patchy binding to isolated lipid rafts (469). as a superantigen, SEB has a characteristic structure with two domains at each end of the molecule. parvovirus B19 can be a cause of pure red cell aplasia and is found in 27 to 40% of patients with aplastic anemia (475). During pregnancy, B19 can precipitate life-threatening anemia, fetal hydrops, and fetal death. rates of B19 infection are 10-fold higher in malaria patients. patients with erythroblast hyperplasia due to chronic hemolytic anemia are particularly susceptible to severe B19 infection. the primary receptor for parvovirus B19 is globoside (Gb4; P) the parvovirus B19 capsid is composed of VP2 (light blue) and VP1 (dark blue) protomers. the majority of the modified B19 dissociates, where it may adhere to a high-affinity coreceptor on erythroblast membranes. more recent studies have failed to find evidence of specific VP2-Gb4 binding using microcalorimetry and surface plasmon resonance. more recent studies have focused on VP1 and specifically the unique VP1 N-terminal domain. VP1u capsids and anti-VP1u antibodies are capable of inhibiting B19 infection (490) Gb4 accounts for 60% to 70% of the total red cell GSL content. VP1u also determines B19 tropism. erythropoietin, cell cycle arrest, and erythroid transcription factors may also favor B19 replication. Puri et al. showed a loss of gp120-mediated cell fusion in cells grown in PPMP, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthesis. other investigators found an inverse relationship between Gb3 and HIV, with increasing Gb3 levels associated with HIV resistance. HIV reportedly binds GSLs via the gp120 envelope between amino acids 206 and 275 (499, 500) it is now clear that HIV-GSL interactions occur at GEMs. a terminal galactose (or, in the case of ganglioside GM3, a penultimate galactose) with a free C-4 hydroxyl group is necessary for binding. P1 substances can be detected in hydatid cyst fluid but only in the presence of scolices (503) it is unknown whether the P2 phenotype and development of anti-P1 are advantageous in helminth infections. china has the highest incidences of echinococcus infection and the P2 phenotype in the world. Globo-H and galactosylgloboside (Gb5; stage-specific embryonic antigen 3 [SSEA-3]) are immunologically active and can be recognized by human polyclonal antibodies on stem cells and other cell lines (38, 343) the synthesis of long-chain globo-GSLs requires the synthesis of Gb5 by 3GalT5, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of both Gb5 and lacto-family GSLs. both FUT1 and FUT2 appear to be capable of fucosylating Gb5 (38\u201340) paragloboside can also serve as a substrate for 3GalNAcT1, which adds a 13GalNAc epitope to form PX2. both P1 and PX2 are recognized by polyclonal anti-Pk and anti-P antibodies. NOR is a very rare phenotype due to a missense mutation in A4GALT1 that permits Gb4 to serve as an acceptor. downregulation of globo-GSLs with 2-deoxy-d-glucose has been reported. mutations in FAPP2 or treatment of cells with brefeldin leads to a loss of globo-GSL, with increased GM3 and LacCer levels (355, 356) the LKE type can occur on either the P1 or P2 background. 80 to 90% of individuals being typed as LKE strong, 10 to 20% being typed as LKE weak, and 1 to 2% being typed as LKE negative. nonsecretors have the highest LKE/MSGG levels on the genitourinary epithelium (361) nonsecretors have the highest LKE/MSGG levels on the genitourinary epithelium (361) phenotype is an autosomal-recessive phenotype due to homozygous globo-GSLs. seven null alleles associated with the Pk phenotype have been reported to date. the p phenotype is a true globo-null phenotype due to amorph A4GALT1 alleles. the basis for the NOR phenotype is still not entirely resolved. the phenotype is an autosomal-recessive phenotype due to homozygous B3GALNT1-null alleles. p is a true globo-null phenotype due to amorph A4GALT1 alleles. the p phenotype occurs sporadically in many populations and is more frequently encountered than Pk. the absence of globo-GSLs is associated with increased susceptibility to sepsis. the absence of globo-GSLs is associated with increased susceptibility to sepsis. this gene contains 3 exons, although exon 3 encodes the active enzyme (342). strong globo expression, including globo-H and LKE, is a feature of genitourinary tract tissue (38, 39, 361, 368, 371) in many tissues, globo-GSLs are relatively cryptic and undetectable by routine flow cytometric or immunofluorescence methods using IgM monoclonal antibodies (372, 373) cholesterol is critical to raft integrity, which acts as a \u201cfiller\u201d or molecular spacer between sphingolipid molecules. the disruption or loss of cholesterol by agents such as -methyl cyclodextrin disrupts raft integrity. lipid A molecule is highly hydrophobic, consisting of a -1\u2032,6-linked glucosamine disaccharide bearing up to six long fatty acid acyl chains. lipid A molecule is highly hydrophobic, consisting of a -1\u2032,6-linked glucosamine disaccharide bearing up to six long fatty acid acyl chains. mice developed severe inflammation and had significantly higher mortality rates than wild-type mice. LPS upregulated A4GALT1 transcription, leading to increased Gb4 synthesis and expression on cells. Uropathogenic E. coli E. coli is the most common cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs), accounting for 80 to 90% of all cases in otherwise healthy individuals (395). recombinant P-fimbriated E. coli specifically provoked increases in IL-8 and IL-6 levels and pyuria (400) several PapG variants are known, which are classified into three subgroups based on hemagglutination and relative binding to globo-GSLs. PapGI generally favors Gb3/Pk, PapGII prefers Gb4/P antigen, and PapGIII recognizes extended globo-GSLs. pyelonephritis was associated with a nonsecretor phenotype in premenopausal women only (57% versus 30%; P 0.001) (412) no correlation between P1 and recurrent UTI in adult females was reported by Sheinfeld et al. (410). 62 children with UTI, including 34 children 1 year of age and 41 children 2 years old, had a 3.2-fold relative risk of UTI. in older children, the nonsecretor phenotype is associated with a heightened inflammatory response. genitourinary epithelium expresses globo- and 3GalT5 glycosyltransferases necessary for synthesizing MSGG and type 1 chain antigens (35, 368, 371) in nonsecretors, MSGG was identified on 100% of cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. the strains strongly bound MSGG, Forssman antigen, and globo-A (type 4 A) but did not recognize A antigen on type 1 or type 2 chain backbones (A-1-6, A-2-6, and ALeb-7) 422, 425. no study has linked a group A Se+ phenotype with increased UTI risk. S. dysenteriae is a serious, potentially life-threatening illness characterized by fever, leukocytosis, abdominal cramps, painful defecation, and a bloody, mucoid diarrhea. mortality rate can reach 5 to 15%, especially among the very young. cells are more sensitive to toxin due to differential synthesis and expression of GSL receptors during the cell cycle. once bound, the A subunit undergoes enzymatic processing to produce the catalytically active form of the toxin (A1 [27 kDa]), an rRNA N-glycosidase (429). Stx holotoxin may bind between 5 and 15 molecules of Gb3 (439) the gut epithelium expresses Gb3, although it is a minor GSL (111, 350, 368). the renal epithelium is especially rich in globo-GSLs and galabiosylceramide. Stx1 has a 10-fold-higher binding affinity than does Stx2. however, Stx2 has a very low dissociation rate, which favors toxin uptake (438) other membrane GSLs can alter the sensitivity of tissues to Stx. b3/Pk can range from 5% to 40% of the total platelet neutral GSL (350, 351) in platelets, 30% of donors possess a globo-rich platelet glycotype reminiscent of kidney epithelium (Gb3 Gb4 LacCer), including 13% who expressed Stx receptor band 0.03 (350, 351) Conversely, nearly half (52%) of normal donors have very little Gb3 or Gb4 on platelet membranes. three studies from the e. coli O157:H7 network in the northwestern united states found no correlation between P1/P2 type, E. coli HUS risk, and clinical outcome (451\u2013453) in multivariate analysis, a P1 type was associated with a 4-fold risk of developing HUS. infection can cause pneumonia, meningitis, septicemia, and endocarditis. in a large outbreak in china affecting 215 individuals, meningitis occurred in nearly half of patients (48%), followed by sepsis (28%), streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (28%), hepatic insufficiency (74%), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and death (456). the galactose lectin domain lies near the amino terminus and has no homology with PapG or Stx (460). the galactose lectin preferentially binds glycans with a terminal Gal1-4Gal disaccharide. the latter would account for the strong hemagglutination of rabbit red cells (461), which express long, branched GSLs bearing Gal1-3Gal epitopes. in animals, SEB produces extensive inflammatory changes along small intestinal mucosa. most of the toxin eventually enters the circulation, with rapid localization to the kidney and proximal renal tubules. galabiosylceramide shares a gala-series GSL (467, 468) oligosaccharide -barrel fold found in CTx and pertussis toxin. -grasp motif is present among many bacterial proteins involved in Gram-positive cell wall synthesis. sequences in domain II (aa 130 to 160) linked to apoptosis. acute and chronic B19 infections have been reported in 18 to 31% of patients. patients with erythroblast hyperplasia are particularly susceptible to severe B19 infection. b19 binds to Gb4 and Forssman antigen by thin-layer chromatography and HAI assays. recognition of Forssman was 10-fold weaker than that of Gb4 (483) in addition to Gb5 and MSGG/LKE, two related extended globo-GSLs. hemagglutination, cell adhesion, and HPTLC immunostaining require incubation at 4\u00b0C (368, 482, 487, 488) nearly two-thirds of bound viral particles rapidly dissociate from cell membranes. the B19 capsid is composed of two related proteins, VP2 (95% capsid; 58 kDa) and VP1 (5%; 83 kDa) VP1/VP2 capsids and VP1u peptides are able to bind UT-7 cells. the modified virus may either detach or bind a secondary coreceptor. any detached virus possesses enhanced membrane binding capacity and avidity, increasing the odds of successful infection upon subsequent cell attachment (487). Ku80 was proposed to be an alternate receptor in reportedly Gb4-negative cell lines (ACHN and HT9) (486) there is no direct evidence showing B19 binding to 1 integrins; however, 1 integrins might facilitate viral internalization through integrin cross talk and signaling in some cell lines. studies showed increased HIV resistance after treatment of cells with 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin. globo-GSL depletion by PPMP (353) or by targeted inhibition with a small interfering RNA against -galactosidase potentiated HIV infection (495, 496) echinococcus is an encysted parasitic infection that may not be diagnosed for several years. echinococcus is an encysted parasitic infection that may not be diagnosed for several years. echinococcus is an encysted parasitic infection that may not be diagnosed for several years. the duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) is a 236-amino-acid integral membrane glycoprotein. it consists of seven transmembrane domains, a 62-amino-acid extracellular N-terminal domain, and two disulfide bonds. it is unable to mount an intracellular signal due to the lack of a G-protein motif. the cytoplasmic loop of the transmembrane domain (Arg89Cys) is responsible for the FyX phenotype. the gene resides on chromosome 1q23.2. FY*BES, FY*B/FY*A, and FY*X are shown. BES encodes a silent Fyb allele due a single point mutation in the DARC promoter. the latter abolishes a critical GATA motif leading to a selective loss of DARC expression on red blood cells only (2, 29, 509) FY*AES and FY*A arose fairly recently in human evolution due to selective pressure from P. vivax (509). e FY*X red cells can be serologically typed as Fy(b) or Fy(bw) due to very weak Fyb expression (5% of normal) e FY*X red cells can be serologically typed as Fy(b) or Fy(bw) due to very weak Fyb expression (5% of normal) the most recent global maps show the highest incidence of the duffy-null phenotype in sub-saharan africa. the high incidence of the Fy(ab) phenotype coincides with a low incidence of P. vivax (0.6%) (24). the high incidence of the Fy(ab) phenotype coincides with a low incidence of P. vivax (24). P. vivax and Fya and Fyb Phenotypes Individuals heterozygous for a silent FY*BES allele have a 50% lower DARC expression level and a decreased risk of malaria (17, 509, 514) the risk of P. vivax infection in Fy(a+b) individuals was 220 to 270% lower than that in Fy(ab+) individuals, even after correction for the FY genotype (515). it is now believed that Fya also arose in response to P. vivax. DARC heterozygous individuals were more likely to make antibodies against P. vivax blood-stage antigens (PvDBP and PvMSP1) than were DARC \u201cdouble-positive\u201d individuals. the poor humoral immune response observed in \u201chigh-DARC\u201d individuals is a consequence of the higher parasite burden and parasite-mediated immune suppression. Fy-Null Phenotype, Neutropenia, and Severe Malaria The Fy(ab) phenotype is linked to benign ethnic neutropenia. this decrease may reflect a decline in early bone marrow progenitors. there is some speculation whether Fy(ab) and neutropenia could be advantageous against the development of severe malaria. a baseline absolute neutrophil count of 2,500 was associated with an Fy-null genotype. the authors of that study could not ascribe an independent effect of either on HIV susceptibility. the authors suggested that the Fy-null phenotype may have higher circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines. the DARC level is highest on young reticulocytes (509) duffy or DARC antigen and gene contains a large extracellular domain and 7 transmembrane domains. the amino-terminal extracellular domain contains the P. vivax PvDBP binding site (aa 8 to 42), of which the negatively charged Fy6 epitope (aa 19 to 26) is critical. /Fyb antigens are the result of a SNP, leading to either a Gly42 (Fya) or Asp (Fyb) substitution (2). there have been several FY alleles described to date (2, 509). FY*A encodes a weak Fyb antigen, with only 10% of normal Fyb expression. ++ 7.2 104 2.70 1.36\u20135.79 FY*B/FY*X Fy(ab+) + ND ND FY*B/FY*BES Fy(abw)e w ND ND Resistant to blood-stage infection. FY*BES, Fy-null allele carrying a GATA promoter mutation leading to a loss of DARC expression on red cells only. earliest studies suggest inherent resistance to malaria arose from research on syphilis (509) it was noted as early as the 1920s that neurosyphilis was uncommon in patients with malaria. syphilis patients deliberately infected with P. vivax malaria often showed significant clinical improvement. PvDBP recognizes a 35-amino-acid epitope (aa 8 to 42) along the DARC amino-terminal domain. fine mapping using DARC mutants identified the Fy6 epitope (aa 19 to 26 [QLDFEDVW]) as critical for PvDBP binding. the prevalence of the FY*A/FY*BES genotype was significantly lower than predicted (10.9% versus 18.8%; P = 0.005) there was no difference in the frequencies of the FY*B/FY*BES genotype between patients and controls (P = 0.32). anti-PvDBP antibodies were 200 to 300% more effective in blocking PvDBP binding to FY*A/FY*A red cells (515). there is controversial evidence that the FY genotype may influence the immune response to P. vivax as well. PF4 is a CXC chemokine that binds red cells via DARC. it exerts a lethal effect on malarial growth and survival. the phenotype is linked to benign ethnic neutropenia. a baseline neutrophil count of 2,500 was associated with an Fy-null genotype and a 3-fold increased risk of HIV seroconversion. the findings were disputed by other investigators, who found no correlation between the FY genotype, CD4 counts, HIV load, and disease progression. AE1 exists as dimers and tetramers and is preferentially located at junctional complexes and the \u201cband 3-ankyrin\u201d metabolon. the amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain is involved in oligomerization and interacts with the underlying cytoskeleton. AE1 contains a single massive N-glycan that expresses ABO and is responsible for 50% of all the ABO antigens on red blood cells. most Diego antigens are low-incidence antigens, except for the Dia/Dib polymorphism. AE1 numbers 1 million copies per RBC and is responsible for 50% of all the ABO epitopes on red cells. mutation compromises red cell deformability by increasing membrane rigidity (528), leading to ovalocytosis. truncated protein is unable to transport anions and actually reduces transport capability of normal AE1 (527) a normal AE1 phenotype (wt/wt) was associated with a high risk of cerebral malaria (P = 0.013) and impaired consciousness (P = 0.0025) compared to patients with SAO. AE1 is closely associated with known malarial receptors. infected SAO red cells may be more susceptible to extravascular hemolysis, opsonization, and splenic clearance. a recent study of AE1 in primates found evidence for adaptive mutations in the AE1 cytosolic domain, but not in the transmembrane and extracellular loops. the prevalence of the SLC4A15699C allele was increased among fatal cases. luciferase assays showed 18 to 27% higher promoter activity in K562 erythroleukemia cells. it is unknown whether increased promoter activity is associated with higher AE1 expression levels or altered red cell deformability. antibodies against AE1 are absent from B. bacilliformis, which may recognize and adhere to red cells by its flagella (542) in areas of Peru, there are differences in clinical B. bacilliformis infection. in some populations, the verrucous or eruptive phase (Peruvian wart) is predominant (544) AE1 exists as dimers and tetramers and is preferentially located at junctional complexes and the \u201cband 3-ankyrin\u201d metabolon. AE1 exists as dimers and tetramers and is preferentially located at junctional complexes and the \u201cband 3-ankyrin\u201d metabolon. the amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain is involved in oligomerization and interacts with the underlying cytoskeleton. most Diego antigens are low-incidence antigens, except for the Dia/Dib polymorphism. AE1 numbers 1 million copies per RBC and is responsible for 50% of all the ABO epitopes on red cells. all SAO individuals identified to date are heterozygous for the mutation (wt/SLC4A127); homozygous inheritance is considered embryonic lethal (529). in areas of the western Pacific where malaria is endemic, the incidence of SAO can reach 35% of the population. a normal AE1 phenotype (wt/wt) was associated with a high risk of cerebral malaria (P = 0.013) and impaired consciousness (P = 0.0025) compared to patients with SAO. a normal AE1 phenotype (wt/wt) was associated with a high risk of cerebral malaria (P = 0.013). a recent phylogenetic study of AE1 in primates found evidence for adaptive mutations in the AE1 cytosolic domain, but not in the transmembrane and extracellular loops, in humans and great apes (538. an increase in ankyrin-AE1 binding could also increase membrane rigidity, analogous to the SAO polymorphism. luciferase assays showed 18 to 27% higher promoter activity in erythroleukemia cells. AE1 and Bartonella Bartonella bacteria are small, curved, facultative, intracellular Gram-negative organisms that display host and tissue specificity. a recent epidemiologic study compared the incidence and presentation of B. bacilliformis relative to the duffy, MN, Ss, and Diego (Dia/b) blood types (544) there was no difference in Dia expression between individuals with Oroya fever and those in the verrucous phase (Peruvian wart) Glycophorin A-null phenotypes are not associated with anemia or altered red cell function (29). the MN antigens are defined by the first 5 amino acids and O-linked glycans on glycophorin A. Glycophorin B contains 15 O-glycan sites and >20 high/low antigens. most of the O-glycan (70%) consists of a classic type 1 core O-linked tetrasaccharide bearing two sialic acids and is located at Ser/Thr residues along the first 30 amino acids of the amino-terminal domain (Table 10) (341) Variations in O-glycan structure are known, including enzymatic desialylation (T antigen), congenital glycosylation deficiencies (Tn syndrome), and substitution by GlcNA glycophorin A (GYPA) and glycophorin B (GYPB) are on chromosome 4 as part of a 330-kb gene cluster (A-B-E) the mature glycophorin A is encoded by exons A2 and B4 to A7. recombination is also responsible for three null phenotypes. the M and N antigens are two autosomal-codominant antigens encoded by the first 5 amino acids on glycophorin A and include 3 O-linked glycans as part of the epitope (29, 341) the antigens differ at two amino acids (aa 1 and 5), where M is a 1Ser-Thr-Thr-Gly5 and N is 1Leu-Ser-Thr-Glu5. glycophorin A- and B-null phenotypes were relatively resistant to malaria invasion in vitro (546\u2013548). the importance of O-linked glycans was inferred by the profound resistance of Tn and Cad red cells, which have altered O-glycan expression. P. falciparum invasion is equivalent in MM, MN, and NN red cells in vitro (547) similar results were observed with rare Mg (Thr4Asn) and Mc (Leu1Ser) red cells, which also type as M N and have altered glycosylation (331, 549) -frequency antigen (HUT; MNS19) leads to a loss of the N-glycan at Asn26 (Fig. 9) (2, 29) and a potential O-glycan at Thr28. Thr58Asn is the site of the Mta antigen (Thr58Ile), which is present in 1% of Thailand natives (2). resistance of Wr(b) cells was equal to or greater than that observed with En(a), U, and MkMkMk glycophorin-null red cells (546\u2013548). however, there is no evidence of impaired P. falciparum invasion in HAG+ red cells. s+ is the predominant allele in most populations, including Caucasians (85%), African Americans (93%), and populations in Thailand (90%) and Brazil (92%). prevalence of the GYPB*S (S+) is variable between populations, being significantly higher in Caucasians than in African Americans (55% versus 30%) in native Africans, the prevalence of the GYPB*S allele in the population can range from 6 to 50% (562). henshaw occurs in 3% of african americans and 3 to 14% of africans (2, 16, 29, 545) henshaw is particularly frequent in the Congo (14%), a region where P. falciparum is hyperendemic. GP.Mur cells have 25 to 67% more AE1 than normal, with increased CO2 respiration, buffering capacity, and osmotic resistance. there is speculation that this could be advantageous against malaria-associated acidosis (559) a panel of 10 monoclonal antibodies identified glycophorin A bearing the M antigen (GYPAM) and glycophorin B bearing the S epitope (GYPB-S) as possible ligands. monoclonal antibodies against GYPAM were more potent inhibitors of B. divergens invasion than was anti-S. Gram-negative organisms can produce neuraminidase (569, 570) T activation most frequently occurs in the setting of NEC, ruptured bowel, sepsis, invasive Streptococcus pneumococcal infections. bacterial infections can also stimulate antibodies against glycophorins A and B. glycophorin A is a 131-amino-acid type 1 glycoprotein. it includes a 72-amino-acid amino-terminal extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a 36-amino-acid cytoplasmic domain. it is heavily glycosylated, with one N-glycan and 21 potential O-glycan sites. Glycophorin B is a 72-amino-acid glycoprotein related to glycophorin A. its extracellular domain is only 44 amino acids, with 11 O-glycan sites. it is also less abundant than glycophorin A, numbering only 170,000 to 250,000 molecules per red cell. glycophorin A (GYPA) and glycophorin B (GYPB) are on chromosome 4 as part of a 330-kb gene cluster (A-B-E) the mature glycophorin A is encoded by exons B2 and B4 to B6. Glycophorin B-negative (S s U) cells are due to recombination and deletion of exons B2 and B4/B5. the phenotype (M N S s U) is due to recombination between GYPA and GYPE. individuals with glycophorin-null phenotypes have decreased sialic acid content. sialic acid is a receptor for P. falciparum. treatment of red cells with neuraminidase or trypsin markedly decreases adhesion and invasion. a few studies have examined the impact of glycophorin A polymorphisms on malaria. rare En(a) red cells, which are M N due to the deletion of exon A2, are 50% more resistant to P. falciparum infection than normal (546, 547) a recent study of 15 native africa populations identified several fixed polymorphisms, possibly as a result of selective pressures (Thr28Lys, Ala35Pro, Thr58Asn, Ala65Val, and His67Arg) the most intriguing fixed polymorphisms identified by Ko et al. are his67Arg and Ala65Val (16), which could potentially impact Wrb. recombination and amino acid polymorphisms within this short peptide region can alter or suppress Wrb expression, regardless of the AE1 genotype. recombination and amino acid polymorphisms within this short peptide region can alter or suppress Wrb expression. aria Glycophorin B is a receptor for the P. falciparum erythrocyte binding ligand EBL-1 (561). variant glycophorin B-deficient red cells (S s U) show moderate resistance to malarial invasion (72%) but show nearly complete resistance (5%) after trypsin treatment to remove glycophorin A. the phenotype is a variant B-A-B glycophorin (GP.He) as a result of gene conversion between the B2 and A2 gene loci. this leads to a loss of the N\u2032 antigen and can lead to a loss of the s/S antigen but no significant change in glycosylation. GP.Dantu cells have 25 to 67% more AE1 than normal, with increased CO2 respiration, buffering capacity, and osmotic resistance. despite its potential selective advantage, Dantu is still quite rare. 45% decrease in Babesia invasion with neuraminidase or trypsin to remove glycophorin A (565) studies showed 45% decrease in Babesia invasion with En(a) cells but not Kell-null or Duffy-null cells (565). neuraminidase converts the normal O-linked tetrasaccharide to the asialo-T antigen. T activation becomes clinically detectable only after a 25 to 55% loss of sialic acid (568) many Gram-negative organisms can produce neuraminidase (569, 570) uropathogenic strain IH11165 specifically recognized M antigen. binding was sensitive to periodate but not neuraminidase. GERBICH blood group antigens are high-incidence antigens. Glycophorins C and D are products of the GYPC gene. they differ by 21 amino acids at the amino-terminal end. the altered protein is underglycosylated and expresses an immature, high-mannose N-glycan. there is an altered interaction with the junctional complexes. BL-VSTK specifically recognizes glycophorin C (576) binding is dependent on sialic acid and the single N-glycan near the glycophorin C amino terminus. recombinant EBA140 does not bind red cells treated with neuraminidase (578) it has been postulated that the F1 domain may engage with sialylated O-glycans. an early study by serjeantson examined the incidence of malaria and Gerbich positivity in 266 Melanesians from northern new Guinea (580) the overall rate of parasitemia among Gerbich-negative individuals was one-third that of Gerbich-positive individuals (5.7% versus 18.6%; P = 0.06) the Wb+ phenotype is rare in all populations (0.01%), with the highest incidences being found in Australia and Wales. the Gerbich blood group antigens are high-incidence antigens that reside on glycophorins C and D. the altered protein is underglycosylated and expresses an immature, high-mannose N-glycan. there is an altered interaction with the junctional complexes, leading to ovalocytosis. the cytoplasmic tails of both glycophorins interact with several cytoskeletal elements. it has been postulated that the F2 domain may engage with sialylated O-glycans. it is unclear why individuals with the Gerbich phenotype should display resistance to P. falciparum. a deletion of exon 3 is not associated with a loss of glycosylation sites. a larger study of 705 genotyped individuals from the Wosera region identified the Gerbich GYPCex3 allele in 71% of the population. there was a correlation between the GYPCex3 genotype and the relative number of circulating ovalocytes. it is important to note that both studies looked only at parasitemia and not disease severity. CR1 is expressed on many blood cells, including red cells, monocytes, granulocytes, dendritic cells, and glomerular podocytes. CR1 is a large glycoprotein (30 kDa) with four isoforms and variable membrane expression. CR1*1 and CR1*2 are the two most common allelic forms in humans. CR1*1 is the most common form in most populations. CR1*1 is composed of 30 CCPs, 4 LHRs, and 3 complement binding domains (2, 25) genetic polymorphisms have been linked with high and low CR1 densities (587) rs11118133 is an AT transition in intron 27 of LHR-D. the intron 27 polymorphism is in linkage disequilibrium with three other polymorphisms. falciparum can invade red cells via sialic acid-dependent (glycophorins) and sialic acid-independent invasion pathways. CR1 was suspected to be a candidate red cell receptor because of its exquisite sensitivity to trypsin (25), which inhibits sialic acid-independent invasion. merozoites binding induces CR1 capping and is inhibitable by soluble CR1 and anti-CR1 (589, 590) in a case-control study involving 358 individuals, the CR1-L allele was protective against severe malaria even in heterozygotes (OR, 30; P = 0.04) (592). CR1 density was determined by typing for both the intron 27 and exon 22 polymorphisms. there was no significant difference in intron 27 alleles between patients with severe malaria and those with uncomplicated malaria. early studies suggested that the Sl genotype is associated with a decreased risk of severe malaria (594) red cells with an Sl(a) or Sl2/2 phenotype also showed weak rosetting, although many of the samples tested also had very low CR1 expression levels (599) one case-control study of Kenyan children reported a decreased incidence of cerebral malaria in Sl2/2 individuals. but did not correlate these findings with evidence of rosette formation (594) leishmania species belonging to the L. braziliensis complex can produce a latent or chronic infection in a small proportion of people. compared monocytes from individuals with a history of leishmania infection of >12 months in duration to those from individuals with a positive skin test but no history of active infection (604) two studies have examined the role of Knops antigens in mycobacterial infections (607, 608) individuals heterozygous for both McCoy (McCa/McCb) and Swain-Langly (Sl1/Sl2) antigens were less likely to have tuberculosis (OR, 0.25; P = 0.008) (606) red cells account for 85% of total CR1 in humans (25). CR1 is a large glycoprotein (30 kDa) with four isoforms and variable membrane expression (25, 585). each CCP contains 60 amino acids and 4 cysteine residues. CR1*1 is the most common allelic form in most populations. it is composed of 30 CCPs, 4 LHRs, and 3 complement binding domains (2, 25) the CR1 variant on red cells is composed of 30 complement consensus repeats arranged as 4 long homologous repeats (LHR-A to -D) CR1 is home to the Knops (KN) blood group system, which is located within LHR-D (25, 28) many Knops antigens show very pronounced differences between blacks and whites, leading to speculation that Knops/CR1 has been subject to selective pressure by malaria or some other infectious disease. merozoites binding induces CR1 capping and is inhibitable by soluble CR1 and anti-CR1 (589, 590) on red cells, merozoites binding induces CR1 capping and is inhibitable by soluble CR1 and anti-CR1 (589, 590). CR1 was identified as the receptor for the reticulocyte binding-like protein PfRh4 (589, 591). CR1 density was determined by typing for both the intron 27 and exon 22 polymorphisms. patients with severe malaria tended to have CR1-H alleles (P 0.0001) and overall poor survival (61% versus 36.6%; P = 0.0007) a brazilian study suggested that Knb increased susceptibility to P. falciparum. risk was specifically associated with the H8 allele with coinheritance of Knb and KCAM antigens. other studies found no correlation between Knops phenotypes and severe malaria. the site of PfEMP1 binding is mapped to the C3b binding sites located in LHR-B and LHR-C. more recent studies with CR1 constructs suggest that CCP15 to -17, especially CCP17, are receptors (586). CR1 variants bearing different McC and Sl antigens were able to equally disrupt rosetting and played no direct role in PfEMP1 binding (586). authors attempted to look at CR1/CR3 activity on monocytes indirectly. they measured the ability of monocytes to bind and rosette complement-coated sheep red cells. there was no relationship in patients with a history of chronic infection. a genetic study in northern Malawi reported that a McCb/b homozygous genotype was protective against leprosy. differences in Knops antigens, which reside in LHR-D, might alter binding by mannose binding lectin (607) CD147 is widely expressed on epithelial tissues, blood cells, retina, and neural cells. there are 3,000 molecules of CD147 per human red cell (2). the most common isoform contains single C-type and V-type domains. the Ok(a+/a) polymorphism is located at amino acid 92. all laboratory and wild-type P. falciparum isolates express PfRh5. mutants lacking PfRh5 are incapable of red cell invasion. a preference for CD147 favors infection of reticulocytes and young red cells. CD147 is a receptor for cyclophilin A, an intracellular peptidyl-prolyl isomerase important in protein folding. the incorporation of cyclophilin A into HIV-1 particles increases their infectivity by nearly 6-fold (616) the absence of cyclophilin A as a result of viral mutations, or by growing HIV in the presence of cyclosporine, severely attenuates virus infectivity. the basigin-2 extracellular domain is composed of two immunoglobulin-type domains. the extracellular domain is a receptor for the leukocyte chemotactic factors cyclophilins A and B. there are 3,000 molecules of CD147 per human red cell (2). the Ok(a) phenotype has been identified in only 8 individuals of Japanese heritage due to a polymorphism in D1 (Glu92Lys) (2). four additional amino acid polymorphisms are known (K36N, V60L, L90P, and G153V), but these polymorphisms have not resulted in alloantibody formation. antibodies against CD147 can induce splenomegaly and anemia in mouse models (614) studies of primate CD147 show a high degree of conservation between humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas (615). cyclophilin A is a receptor for cyclophilin A, an intracellular peptidyl-prolyl isomerase important in protein folding (610). immunoprecipitation experiments showed that HIV binding was mediated by virus-associated cyclophilin A. cytophilin A is incorporated into the SARS coronavirus envelope and can interact with CD147 (618) measles virus binds CD147 via virus-associated cyclophilin B. CD55/DAF is absent in individuals with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) due to defects in GPI synthesis. soluble CD55 arises from alternate splicing and is found in secretions and body fluids. gene for CD55 is located on chromosome 1q32 and is organized over 11 exons. most polymorphisms are low-incidence antigens present in rare individuals (2, 624) the afa/Dr family of adhesins was named after their inability to agglutinate rare Dr(a) and PNH red cells. the latter may arise due to genetic mutation or may be an acquired phenotype (624). similar results were obtained by using CD55 deletion mutants lacking specific CCP domains. three additional amino acids (Gly159, Tyr160, and Leu162) were found to participate in Dr binding. i H. pylori can recognize and utilize host ligands as an adaptive response to inflammation and altered glycosylation. H. pylori was associated with elevated CD55 expression on inflamed gastric mucosa (633) of 342 Kenyans showed that CD55 levels was strongly correlated with the percentage of C3b+ red cells (636) low CD55 levels could promote increased erythrophagocytosis and accelerated splenic clearance. Hantavirus readily infects endothelial cells, a significant factor in pulmonary and renal pathology. 3 integrins, C1q, and CD55 have been shown to bind hantaviruses in vitro. treatment of cells with phosphoinositol-specific phospholipase C also increases cell resistance. coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM), 21 integrin, and CD55 (645) in many cases, CD55 is a low-affinity receptor for these viruses, with many investigators hypothesizing that CD55 is a high-density scaffold. there are a few interactions between VP2 and CCP3 of the CD55 molecule (631). there are no direct interactions with Cromer alloantigens. CVB3 binding to CD55 is quite weak compared to that of hantavirus. bind CD55, including ENV3, ENV6, ENV7, ENV11, ENV12, ENV13, ENV19, ENV24, ENV29, and ENV33 (652). epitope mapping studies with CCP-specific antibodies and CD55 deletion constructs indicate that most enteroviruses require nearly full-length CD55 for binding (CCP1-4 and CCP2-4). EV-7 and EV-12 share only two contacts on CD55 (aa 104, 112, 121, 141, and 160) EV-7 recognizes a short peptide sequence on CCP4 (aa 213 to 216) that includes the CROV antigen (Glu122Lys) as well as several amino acids (160, 162, 166) adjacent to the Dra antigen (Ser165; CCP3). CD55/DAF is absent in individuals with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) due to defects in GPI synthesis. soluble CD55 arises from alternate splicing and is found in secretions and body fluids. CD55 is a member of the LPS receptor complex. it can modulate intracellular signaling and cytoskeletal alterations. the gene for CD55 is located on chromosome 1q32 and is organized over 11 exons. differences in CD55 expression have been linked to promoter polymorphism. CD55 is absent or its expression is reduced in individuals with PNH and the Inab phenotype (Crnull) the latter may arise due to genetic mutation or may be an acquired phenotype (624). similar results were obtained using CD55 deletion mutants lacking specific CCP domains. three additional amino acids (Gly159, Tyr160, and Leu162) were found to participate in Dr binding. Helicobacter pylori H. pylori can recognize and utilize host ligands as an adaptive response to inflammation and altered glycosylation. bacterial binding to CD55 and bacterial internalization may promote chronic infection by avoiding complement-mediated destruction. a study of 342 Kenyans showed that CD55 levels was strongly correlated with the percentage of C3b+ red cells (636) low CD55 levels could promote increased erythrophagocytosis and accelerated splenic clearance. Hantavirus is zoonotic illness spread by mice and other rodents. new world hantaviruses cause acute pulmonary syndrome. Old world hantaviruses are a cause of hemorrhagic fever with renal failure. s are spread by fecal-oral transmission, binding to epithelial receptors in the small intestine, followed by symptomatic viremia 4 to 6 days later. s are a common cause of febrile illness in young children, aseptic meningitis, and myocarditis. the CVB capsid is constructed of 60 protomers, each containing four viral proteins (VP1 to -4) (631, 644) there are a few interactions between VP2 and CCP3. there are no direct interactions with Cromer alloantigens, although VP2 interacts with V121, adjacent to CROV. epitope mapping studies with CCP-specific antibodies and CD55 deletion constructs indicate that most enteroviruses require nearly full-length CD55 for binding (CCP1-4 and CCP2-4). the exception is ENV12, which appears to recognize epitopes on CCP3 and/or CCP4 (652). EV-11 and EV-12 preferentially interact with CCP3 and CCP4. EV-7 and EV-12 share only two contacts on CD55 (aa 155 and 214) EV-7 recognizes a short peptide sequence on CCP4. virus uptake involves signaling through raft-associated Src kinases (648) in cell cultures, CVB infection can be blocked by soluble CD55 and CD55 antibodies. CD55 knockout mice infected with CVB3 have low viral titers. enterovirus 70 (ENV70) is the etiologic agent of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. it is a highly contagious form of conjunctivitis that has caused widespread outbreaks. echovirus binds CD55 with transfer to tight junctions in a raft-dependent manner, followed by internalization (657) echovirus can be internalized as a CD55-virus complex. EV-7, EV-11, and EV-12 preferentially interact with CCP3 and CCP4. the molecule consists primarily of a large amino-terminal extracellular domain composed of a 90-amino-acid, globular hyaluronan binding domain and a variable stem region rich in O-linked glycans. the interaction of CD44 with band 4.1 proteins (ERM proteins) is required for the formation and extension of microvilli and cell motility. globular domain is capable of binding hyaluronic acid (HA), including hyaluronic acid on S. pyogenes. the molecule contains a long cytoplasmic domain that interacts with ankyrin and ERM proteins to modulate the cytoskeleton. the molecule is implicated in a variety of biological functions. inb, IN3 and IN4 are high-incidence antigens (2, 664). ina is a low-incidence antigen (1%) in most populations except Indian (4%) and Arab (11 to 12%) populations (2). the high-incidence blood group antigen Anton (AnWj) is also believed to reside in the Indian blood group system. yaluronic lectin binding domain leads to cytoskeletal rearrangements, disruption of intercellular junctions, and tissue penetration (667, 669). anti-CD44 recognition of hyaluronic acid has also been reported for Pasteurella multocida serogroup A (670). CD44 would fit the original data for H. influenzae hemagglutination. agglutinated true Lu(ab) red cells, but not In(Lu) and cord red cells, which suppressed CD44 expression (672) CD44 is present in saliva, which was reported to possess variable quantities of AnWj (676, 677) listeria Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive, facultative intracellular organism capable of direct cell-cell transmission (682) the organism is widely distributed in soil, water, and livestock, with several large outbreaks linked to contaminated dairy products and vegetables. null cells still showed evidence of listeria actin tail formation. investigators have examined the role of CD44/Indian in the response to and outcome of bacterial pneumonia by using a CD44-deficient mouse model. oforms due to alternative splicing and differences in posttranslational glycosylation. the molecule consists of a large extracellular domain composed of a 90-amino-acid, globular hyaluronan binding domain and a variable stem region rich in O-linked glycans. arginine (R41 and R78) and tyrosine (Y42 andY79) residues important for hyaluronic the molecule contains a long cytoplasmic domain that interacts with ankyrin and ERM proteins to modulate the cytoskeleton. Binding by L. monocytogenes invokes ezrin binding and phosphorylation with actin polymerization. CD44 is implicated in a variety of biological functions. the high-incidence blood group antigen Anton (AnWj) is also believed to reside in the Indian blood group system. there are no known CD44-null individuals, although Indian antigens are depressed on In(Lu) red cells. H. influenzae type b possesses adhesive fimbriae capable of hemagglutinating red cells (672) studies by van alphen et al. in the late 1980s tentatively identified the AnWj antigen as a possible receptor. CD44 levels are usually quite low in saliva but can be increased with smoking, periodontal disease, oral dysplasia, and cancer due to higher CD44 expression levels on buccal epithelium (676, 677). there is strong evidence implicating CD44 in both Shigella adhesion and invasion. severe infections, including meningitis, are observed for nearly half of immunocompromised patients. cell-to-cell infection involves CD44 and ezrin, an ERM band 4.1 protein. this process requires ezrin phosphorylation and activation, which opens an F-actin binding site on the molecule. the same mouse model has been used to study E. coli peritonitis and tuberculosis. CD44 mediates macrophage recruitment, phagocytosis, and immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. AQP3 gene spans 6 kb on chromosome 9p13 and is highly conserved. no missense mutations in the translated protein were identified in a recent study of european and africa individuals (665). AQP3 is the predominant water channel in brain and plays multiple roles in regulating water homeostasis, edema, and inflammation (695). AQP3 mRNA levels were shown to be decreased in children with severe malaria and anemia. decreased AQP3 expression could be multifactorial due to quinine, hypoglycemia, and inhibition of erythropoiesis (665). on peritoneal macrophages, AQP3 is localized along the leading edge of pseudopodia and the phagocytic cup. lycerol, hydrogen peroxide (690, 691) is a 292-amino-acid multipass protein containing six transmembrane domains and a single N-glycosylation site. it is believed to reside in detergent-resistant microdomains as homodimers. AQP3 is highly expressed in RBCs, kidney, small intestine, stomach, colon, and lung (693) infected red cells, AQP3 was shown to preferentially relocate from the red cell membrane to the cytoplasmic parasitophorous vacuole (692). AQP3 mRNA levels were shown to be decreased in children with severe malaria and anemia. AQP3 is localized along the leading edge of the plasma membrane of migrating, activated T cells. it is a member of the neprilysin family of zinc-neutral endopeptidases and has endothelin-3 convertase activity. it is not required for normal red cell development, and its exact role in red cell biology is still unclear. tetraspanins play a role in cell adhesion, tumor metastasis, cell signaling, and several viral infections. CD151 is a 253-amino-acid, 28- to 32-kDa multipass protein with four transmembrane domains, four cysteine residues, two extracellular loops. the second, large extracellular loop (EC2) contains a QRD motif for integrin binding (aa 194) a MER2-negative, autosomal-recessive, CD151-null phenotype was identified in three individuals of Indian ancestry due to a nucleotide insertion (exon 5; G383). all three individuals had nephrotic syndrome with end-stage renal disease and neurosensory deafness. Neisseria can express several adhesins, including type 4 pili, which recognize CD46 (709), leading to speculation that TEMs could play a role in Neisseria infection. tetraspanins play a role in cell adhesion, tumor metastasis, cell signaling, and several viral infections. CD151 is a 253-amino-acid, 28- to 32-kDa multipass protein with four transmembrane domains, four cysteine residues, two extracellular loops. the second, large extracellular loop (EC2) contains a QRD motif for integrin binding (aa 194) two SNPs (R171C and R178H) have been identified in three individuals with MER2 alloantibodies (707) all three individuals had nephrotic syndrome with end-stage renal disease and neurosensory deafness. HPVs are nonenveloped DNA viruses capable of infecting epithelial cells. Neisseria meningitidis is a Gram-negative diplococcus and a cause of meningitis. it can express several adhesins, including type 4 pili. TEMs could play a role in Neisseria infection."}
