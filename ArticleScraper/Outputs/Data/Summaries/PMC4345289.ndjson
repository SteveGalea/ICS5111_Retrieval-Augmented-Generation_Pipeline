{"summary": "the world health organization (WHO) report on surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in 20141 stated that resistance to common bacteria has reached alarming levels in many parts of the world. the report makes a clear case that resistance to common bacteria has reached alarming levels in many parts of the world. in some settings, few, if any, of the available treatments options remain effective for common infections' emergence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii9 and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE)10,11 have been reported in many parts of the world. the prevalence of MRSA (A), ESBL-E. coli (B), CRAB (C) and CRPA (D) in a teaching hospital in Hong Kong between 1998 and 2012 cese isolates with decreased susceptibility to carbapenems collected from 2004 to 2008 in 16 teaching hospitals. CPE was noted in 33% (16/49), Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC-2) was found in six isolates. imipenemase-4 (IMP-4) and imipenemase-8 (IMP-8) were identified in eight and two strains. the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa was found to be 29% in 2011. the proportion of CRAB also increased from 50% to 60% from 2009 to 2011, and OXA-23 was the most prevalent plasmid-encoded carbapenemase among CRAB isolates in china. patients with non-pneumonic MRSA infections had a crude mortality of 50%, according to a large cohort of 1148 patients over 15 years. even in critically ill patients, those with MRSA bacteremia had a significantly higher attributable 30-day mortality rate (53.2% vs. 18.4%) and in-hospital mortality rate (63.8% vs. 23.7%) the median length of stay after bacteremia was 11 days for cases (interquartile range: 5\u201321) versus 5 days for controls (interquartile range: 3\u20139) (P0.001). the average hospital cost was Israeli shekels 65 509 for cases versus 23 538 for controls (P0.001). the cost of a medical intensive care unit closure due to an outbreak of CRAB in a hospital was estimated to be \u20ac216 553, while the cost of waste elimination and cleaning procedures was about \u20ac12 000. the increased trend of antibiotic consumption in animal husbandry was associated with the spread of antimicrobial resistance. the estimated annual antibiotic use in livestock was 13.54 million kg, followed by humans (3.29 million kg), aquaculture (0.15 million kg), pets (0.15 million kg) and crops (0.07 million kg) the use of antibiotics in human also correlated with increasing isolation of multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs) antimicrobial abuse in china is not driven by patients' demands, but mainly a supply-driven phenomenon. simulated patients with identical flu-like symptoms visited the same physician. simulated patient A asked questions that showed knowledge of appropriate antibiotic use, whereas patient B said nothing beyond describing the symptoms. fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin), macrolides (dehydroerythromycin, roxithromycin and clarithromycin), sulfonamides (sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethazine) and trimethoprim were ubiquitous in wastewater. sulfamethoxazole was the most frequently detected antibiotic residue in the major pearl river. endemic presence of ESBL-producing E. coli isolates in food-producing animals increased from 2008/2009 to 2012/2013. approximately seven out of 10 live chickens, eight out of 10 pigs and five out of 10 cattle were found to carry these bacteria. ESBL-producing E. coli in food animals (1260 chickens, 610 pigs, and 590 cattles), in Hong Kong, 2008\u20132013. the control of antibiotic use in farms has become one of the most important upstream control measures. restriction of antibiotic use as growth promoters in farms was first introduced in Sweden in 1986. control measures to combat dissemination of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) should be banned. increase farm productivity by improving biosecurity. hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand rub if hands are not visibly soiled. practice of \u201centry and exit\u201d control by implementing directly observed hand hygiene for conscious patients before oral hygiene, ingestion of meals and medications, and after using the toilet. the proportion of ESBL-producing E. coli was significantly higher in the effluent than in the influent (0.6% vs. 0.3%, P=0.017) another study evaluated the risk of dissemination of antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa from a hospital to the environment via the wastewater network. physicians reported decreased antibiotic prescription from 2000\u20132003 compared with control physicians (75% vs. 58%, P=0.03) a clear health message has to be disseminated to the general public that ready-to-eat, undercooked food items should be avoided. influx of enterococcal antibiotic resistance and virulence genes was associated with ready-to-eat foods because they are commonly consumed. nine of the 50 cattle sampled in France carried the carbapenemase-producing A. lwoffii blaOXA-23 gene. the identification of a blaNDM-1-carrying strain of A. lwoffii revealed the potential of blaNDM-1 transmission from animals to human. in a summer camp outbreak of foodborne salmonella gastroenteritis, two multi-resistant E. coli strains were found along with S. enterica in nine of the 22 investigated individuals. researchers from Spain evaluated this possibility further by investigating stool samples from 905 people involved in 132 episodes of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks. 21% of returning travelers had fecal colonization by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. ingestion of plasmids or DNA fragments containing the resistance determinants may also pose a risk because the human microbiota may acquire the resistance genes by transformation. the risk of resistance emerging from this route of exposure seems exceedingly low. pro-active surveillance cultures allow for early recognition of patients with asymptomatic colonization of MDROs. for MDROs that are not yet endemic in hospitals, pro-active surveillance cultures allow for early recognition of patients with asymptomatic colonization of MDROs. a'safety net' to screen patients hospitalized for 14 days or more. a'safety net' was implemented as previously described90,97,98. for newly diagnosed patients carrying VRE or CPE, bedside assessment is carried out. active surveillance played an important role in the control of a hospital-wide outbreak of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae infection Israel. of 12 391 days of contact precautions, 4713 (38%) were added as a result of active surveillance. infection control measures should not be limited to an institution. hand hygiene monitoring demonstrated compliance of over 70% in our center. manual observation of hand hygiene practice may be overestimated due to the Hawthorne effect. a designated healthcare assistant or nurse delivers alcohol-based hand rub to conscious patients once every 2\u20133 h. 114,115 MRSA-positive cases are best nursed in isolation rooms. the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics could increase bacterial loads. a 5-day regimen of nasal mupirocin ointment, chlorhexidine mouth rinse and whole-body wash with didecyldimonium chloride. bacitracin-containing regimens given orally or via a gastrostomy tube for 10 to 29 days have been reported. 120,122,124 long-term follow-up showed that persistent decolonization of VRE was observed in 33%\u201353% of patients at three weeks post-treatment. transmission of asymptomatic nasal MRSA was three times higher than in the hospital. infection control measures must be implemented in residential care homes for the elderly in order to reduce the burden of MRSA carriers in healthcare settings. funding of the Food and Health Bureau and the Consultancy Service for Enhancing Laboratory Surveillance of Emerging Infectious Disease of the department of health."}
