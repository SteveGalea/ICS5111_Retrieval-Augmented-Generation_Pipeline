{"summary": "the causative agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus classified within the Arteriviridae family. since its emergence in the late 1980s, PRRS has been the most important threat to the swine industry. eIF2 inhibits the exchange of eIF2-GDP for eIF2-GTP. phosphorylation of eIF2 decreases the level of the active eIF2/tRNAiMet/GTP ternary complex. these complexes recruit multiple RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to nucleate SG assembly. many viruses have been reported to inhibit SG accumulation. SGs, or at least SG components, may potentially function to repress productive viral infections. inhibition of SGs results in an enhancement of IAV replication. however, several viruses have been reported to benefit from SG formation. the interplay between PRRSV and the cellular stress response remains largely unclear. about 2 ml of virus suspensions were dispensed to form a layer of fluid less than 2 mm deep in a round, flat tissue culture plate of 10 cm diameter. the tissue culture plate was placed in clean bench and irradiated within 20 cm far from shortwave (254 nm) ultraviolet light source for 1 h. the loss of infectivity was confirmed by the inability of the UV-irradiated virus to produce a cytopathic effect on monolayer rabbit monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against phospho-eIF2 (Ser51) and eIF2 (goat polyclonal) were purchased from cell signaling technology. mouse mAb against beta-actin was obtained from medical and biological Laboratories. horsesradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse, and HRP-conjugated donkey anti-goat were purchased from medical and Biological Laboratories. indirect immunofluorescence assay MARC-145 cells were seeded on circular glass coverslips and left to grow until they reached 80\u201390% confluence. equal amounts of samples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) the separated proteins were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF) the expressions of TIA1, G3BP1, eIF2 or phospho-eIF2 protein were analyzed using appropriate specific antibodies. beta-actin was detected with an anti-beta-actin mouse the resulting cDNA was then used as the template in a qPCR assay. the abundance of individual mRNA transcripts in each sample was assayed three times. the primers were designed with Primer Express software v.3.0 (Applied Biosystems) at least 10 high-powered fields (HPFs) were randomly obtained with at least 250 cells counted for each sample. the total number of cells was quantified by counting the number of nuclei. mL penicillin, 100 g/mL streptomycin sulfate in humidified 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 incubator. PRRSV strain was isolated from the brains of pigs suffering from \"high fever\" syndrome. ldrich and (St Louis, MO, USA) were used at concentrations of 500 M and 0.25 mM respectively. the siRNAs targeting monkey TIA1, G3BP1, HRI, or GCN2 were each transfected at a final concentration of 50 nM using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. mAb against NF-B p65 and phospho-NF-B p65 were purchased from cell signaling technology. mouse mAb against PRRSV nucleocapsid protein was prepared by our laboratory. fluorescent images were acquired with an Olympus FV10 laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus, Japan) Western blot analysis Cell lysates were obtained by the addition of lysis buffer (4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 3% dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.065 mM Tris-HCl, [pH 6.8], and 30% glycerine) the cells were overlaid with 1.8% (w/v) Bacto agar mixed 1:1 with 2 DMEM containing 0.05 mg/ml neutral red. Plaques were counted 2 days post-infection. the average plaque numbers and standard deviation were calculated from three independent experiments. at least 10 high-powered fields (HPFs) were randomly obtained with at least 250 cells counted for each sample. the total number of cells was quantified by counting number of nuclei. data of three independent experiments were shown as the mean standard deviation (SD) Statistical significance was determined with a p-value 0.01. Ethics statement All animal experiments were approved by the Hubei Administrative Committee for Laboratory Animals. results PRRSV infection induces stable SG formation depending on viral replication. i, 50% of cells at 24 hpi, 90% of cells at 36 and 48 hpi. PRRSV infection induces the formation of stress granules. uninfected cells were treated with 0.5 mM for 1 h. MARC-145 cells were inoculated or mock-inoculated with UV-inactivated PRRSV for 36 h and then fixed and stained with antibodies against G3BP1 and PRRSV N. both SA treatment and PRRSV infection induced robust SG formation. SG formation was not detectable in cells mock-inoculated or inoculated with UV-inactivated PRRSV. granules appeared by 12 hpi and remained thereafter. G3BP1 might co-localize with TIA1 within SGs throughout PRRSV infection. onical SGs, MARC-145 cells were infected with PRRSV. the cells were fixed for three-color immunofluorescence assays at 12, 24, 36, or 48 hpi. eIF3 is recruited to PRRSV-induced SGs late in infection rather than early. the increase in eIF2 phosphorylation began by 12 h post-inoculation. this was consistent with previous research (Huo et al., 2013) and maintained throughout infection. this timing is consistent with the appearance of SGs. the inoculum was removed and replaced with medium containing the same concentration of PERK-I or vehicle as described above. cells were transfected with 50 nM/well of siGCN2, siHRI, or negative control (NC) for 36 h each. PERK-I acts as a highly potent PERK inhibitor by targeting PERK in its inactive DFG conformation at the ATP-binding region. no appreciable cytotoxicity in MARC-145 cells was detected at concentrations of 0.25\u20131 M for C16, 0.25\u20131 mM for 2-AP or 0.5\u20135 M for PERK-I. the designed GCN2- or HRI-specific siRNAs used in this study were able to reduce the endogenous mRNA levels of GCN2 or HRI in MARC-145 cells by over 70 or 60% respectively. this was compared with the negative control (NC) siRNA. these cells were fixed and immunostained at 36 hpi to examine the presence of SGs. SG disassembly has no prominent influence on PRRSV replication. specific siRNAs were designed to knock down endogenous TIA1, G3BP1 and TIAR. the knockdown efficiency was demonstrated by the results of real-time RT-qPCR and Western blot assays. silencing efficiency of TIA1-, TIAR-, or TIAR-specific siRNAs was determined by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. silencing efficiency of TIA1-, TIAR-, or TIAR-specific siRNAs was determined by RT-qPCR (top) and Western blotting. MARC-145 cells were transfected with siTIA1, siG3BP1 and siTIAR for 24 h. at 36 hpi, the cells were fixed, stained with antibodies against PRRSV N, TIA1, G3BP1, TIAR or eIF3, followed by staining with Alexa 594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG for PRRSV N. mRNA expression of some pro-inflammatory cytokines was detected by real-time RT-qPCR. the IL-6, IL-8, and TNF- mRNA expression levels in the concomitant depletion cells were increased to varying degrees compared with those for the negative control-transfected cells. PRRSV-induced p65 phosphorylation levels increased in cells transfected with siRNA pools of TIA1-, TIAR-, and G3BP1. the total p65 level remained unchanged in cells transfected with the specific siRNAs compared with those for the negative control-transfected cells. PRRSV triggered the formation of SGs in approximately 10% of cells at 12 hpi, 50% of cells at 24 hpi, and 90% of cells at 36 and 48 hpi. results suggest a robust SG response was induced by PRRSV beginning at approximately 12 h after inoculation. MARC-145 cells were inoculated or mock-inoculated with UV-inactivated PRRSV for 36 h. SG formation was not detectable in cells mock-inoculated or inoculated with UV-inactivated PRRSV. SG formation was not detected in cells that were mock-inoculated with UV-inactivated PRRSV. both TIA1 and TIA1 granules appeared by 12 hpi. G3BP1 might co-localize with TIA1 within SGs throughout PRRSV infection. a positive control, cells were treated with 0.5 mM SA for 1 h. al antibody specific for PRRSV N (blue) was used to detect PRRSV-infected cells. the cells were fixed for three-color immunofluorescence assays at 12, 24, 36, or 48 hpi. eIF3 is recruited to PRRSV-induced SGs late in infection rather than early. PKR, PERK, GCN2 and HRI are involved in SG assembly through phosphorylating eIF2. the increase in eIF2 phosphorylation began by 12 h post-inoculation. this timing is consistent with the appearance of SGs. TIA1 (red) and PRRSV N (green) expression levels were analyzed by Western blotting using -actin expression as a loading control. eIF2 and phosphorylated eIF2 expression levels were analyzed by Western blotting. PERK-I acts as a highly potent PERK inhibitor by targeting PERK in its inactive DFG conformation at the ATP-binding region. no appreciable cytotoxicity in MARC-145 cells was detected at concentrations of 0.25\u20131 M for C16. specific siRNAs were used to test the effects of GCN2 and HRI on PRRSV-induced SG formation in MARC-145 cells. they reduced endogenous mRNA levels of GCN2 or HRI by over 70 or 60% compared with the negative control (NC) siRNA. 2 were observed in the absence of PRRSV infection. there was no significant difference in the total eIF2 levels among the various treatments. SG assembly triggers SG assembly via eIF2 phosphorylation. cells were transfected concomitantly with TIA1-, TIAR-, and TIAR-specific siRNAs. cells were harvested together with the supernatants at 12, 24, 36, or 48 hpi. simultaneous depletion of TIA1, G3BP1, or TIAR caused no significant difference in PRRSV replication compared with control levels. stained cells were examined by confocal microscope. percentage of SG-positive cells (up) and average number of SGs per cell (down) were quantified. Error bars show standard deviations. stitial pneumonia is considered one of the most remarkable features of PRRSV infection. a large number of studies have reported that PRRSV infection induces inflammatory cytokine production in vivo and in vitro. the mRNA expression of some pro-inflammatory cytokines was detected by real-time RT-qPCR. PRRSV-induced p65 phosphorylation level increased in cells transfected with siRNA pools of TIA1-, TIAR-, and G3BP1. at least four distinct patterns of SG formation have been reported following infection with RNA or DNA viruses. poliovirus infection causes a transient SG formation during the early phase of infection. PRRSV induces SG formation within 12 h of inoculation. previous studies showed that the infection of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV), both viruses belong to Nidovirales order as PRRSV, could also induce SG formation. inhibition of PERK, but not of PKR, HRI, or GCN2, completely abrogates SG formation and decreases the eIF2 phosphorylation level in PRRSV-infected cells. previous studies showed that PRRSV infection upregulated phosphorylation level of PERK and the phosphorylation level of PKR was not well correlated with that of eIF2 in MARC-145 cells. SGs exhibit proviral or antiviral roles for different viruses. for example, expression of a cleavage-resistant G3BP1 restored SG formation during poliovirus infection. depletion of TIA1 resulted in enhanced VSV growth and gene expression. a limitation of this study is that only MARC-145 cells were used to study the formation of SGs during PRRSV infection. it is therefore vital to detect the relationship between PRRSV and SGs in primary porcine alveolar macrophages. the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. conflict of interest statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
