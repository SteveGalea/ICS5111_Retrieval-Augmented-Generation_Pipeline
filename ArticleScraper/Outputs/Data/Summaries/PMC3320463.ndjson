{"summary": "study hospital X is a Toronto-area community hospital with 425 beds. all nonhealthcare workers with probable or suspected SARS were included in this retrospective cohort investigation. the outbreak involved 88 case-patients whose exposure setting was hospital X. twenty-four (83%) of the 29 SARS patients tested were positive by RT-PCR, serology, or both. the 5 remaining patients had negative acute-phase SARS-CoV serologic results, and their convalescent-phase results were not available. patients with late SARS recognition/total SARS (%) RR (95% CI) p value Postoperative 5.3 (1.8\u201316.2) 0.001 Yes 8/11 (72.7) No 3/22 (13.6) Maximum temperature during hospitalization (\u00b0C) 0.8 (0.3\u20133.1) 1.0 38.8 5/15 (33.3) >38.8 6/15 (40.0) First symptom includes Fever 1.0 (0.2\u20135.4) 1.0 Yes 10/30 (33.3) No 1/3 (33.3) Cough patients with late recognition of SARS were more likely to have no known contact with another SARS patient (p 0.001), to have symptom onset while hospitalized, and to be a postoperative patient. the hospital reintroduced enhanced SARS precautions on may 23, 2003, under the direction of public health authorities promptly after the nosocomial outbreak was recognized. a small number of patients with a diagnosis of SARS may not actually have been infected with SARS-CoV. this possibility could have biased the results either way. the occurrence of seasonal respiratory infections such as influenza may compound the difficulty in identifying a SARS case. this recommendation is particularly important if the hospital housed SARS patients within the previous 20 days or if unexplained febrile respiratory clusters had been noticed within the institution. a sensitive infectious disease surveillance system must be in place in healthcare facilities for early detection and implementation of appropriate measures to interrupt transmission."}
