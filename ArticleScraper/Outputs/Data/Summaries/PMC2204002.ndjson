{"summary": "a cost analysis of a respiratory infection control was conducted. a threshold analysis was conducted to estimate a threshold value of the intervention's effectiveness that could generate potential savings in terms of averted health-care costs by the intervention that exceed explicit costs. there are few evaluations of outreach facilitation that have studied the net costs of delivering interventions of this nature that exist in the literature. an exception is a study authored by Hogg, Baskerville, and Lemelin [4] which consisted of a randomized, controlled, field trial of an intervention aimed at improving preventative care tailored to the needs of participating family practices. the best practices promoted by the intervention are the droplet and contact precautions. the intervention was conducted in the city of Ottawa and delivered by five public health nurses. a total of 53 family medicine practices participated in this pre-post intervention observational study. four respiratory control activities for an ambulatory office were viewed as primary indicators of effective respiratory infection control. the auditors were blinded to the outcome measures and aware only of data gathering requirements. cost analysis We conducted a cost analysis of the respiratory infection control intervention. a standard cost-benefit analysis or cost-effectiveness analysis could not be conducted. the intervention referred to the costs of medical care averted due to improved respiratory infection control practices. the cost of training of the nurse facilitators was amortized over a 3-year life span at a discount rate of 5% based on the training expenses initially incurred at the beginning of the intervention. the entire training cost was amortized over a 3-year life span at a discount rate of 5% based on the training expenses that were initially incurred at the beginning of the intervention. the cost of the training of the facilitators was amortized over a 3-year life span at a discount rate of all costs were presented in micro detail for the 5-week period over which the intervention was executed, both in terms of total levels and on the basis of costs per practice. the cost estimates that we generated should generalize to similar projects in other geographic areas that are on either larger or smaller scales. a patient who is infected with influenza may rest at home, visit an emergency room, or be hospitalized. in such a case, cost arises from the patient's perspective, but not from the societal perspective. a few patients die from influenza, but it is impossible to attach a precise value for the cost of death. flu cases avoided due to the intervention in the physician's office*proportion of the infected people who were hospitalized. the second element in each of the terms in parentheses, which is a counterfactual, can be expressed as: the number of flu cases avoided in the physician's office due to the intervention. a total of 53 family medicine practices participated in this pre-post intervention observational study. 110, or 77 % of them, completed all or part of the pre-intervention questionnaire. the intervention commenced with the public health nurse facilitators providing baseline audit feedback. physicians presented with evidence-based best practices and a facilitative \"tool kit\" a box of procedural masks, wall-mounted alcohol gel dispensers with refills, alcohol gel pumps, and hospital-grade disinfectant wipes. the facilitators corresponded with the project team daily and attended scheduled weekly meetings. the number of practices that applied all of the four audited primary prevention measures was 3.8% (0%\u20139.1%) prior to the intervention and 52.8% (38.9%\u201366.7%) following the intervention. a standard cost-benefit analysis or cost-effectiveness analysis could not be conducted in this case. the cost of the training of the five nurse facilitators was amortized over a 3-year life span at a discount rate of 5 percent. the cost of the training of the facilitators was amortized over a 3-year life span at a discount rate of 3 years. based on the training expenses initially incurred at the beginning of the intervention, we included the entire training cost into cost analysis instead of amortizing it. results were presented at discount rates of 0% and 8% in the mathematical summary which details the discounting process. in order to generate an accurate estimate of the total health-care costs averted by this intervention, one would require the following pieces of information: i) the incidence or frequencies of transmission at physicians' offices, iii) the effect of the intervention in reducing those rates, iii) the probabilities of the various potential health outcomes that could arise given infection, and iv) the cost of the treatments associated with those outcomes. cost savings \u2013 intervention cost > = 0. was judged to be worthwhile if: Cost savings \u2013 intervention cost > = 0. a critical element for this calculation is transmission rates for influenza in settings such as physicians' offices. population was unable to find research pertaining to the incidence of transmission in physician offices. we searched for papers on Medline, CINAHL and EMBASE by the key words \"Influenza or flu\" a nurse facilitator spent approximately 11 1/2 hours at each practice. an annual total of 1,950 hours worked in one year, the hourly wage rate of one nurse facilitator was $24.55. in the 5-week intervention period, the labour costs (for time actually worked) for all five nurse facilitators combined amounted to $15,147.35 ($24.55 617 hrs) in parentheses indicates the share of the 875 hours that is accounted for by each facilitator. the total costs for the intervention are presented in Table 2. the third column provides the data on the costs of the outreach facilitator intervention denominated in 2004 dollars. the training cost for five facilitators would be totally fixed for a 3-year period. each practice site was compensated for time lost $7,950.00 $20,670.00 $82,680.00 $7,950.00 Intervention costs $52,810.71. the variable costs that were incurred for this 5-week project amount to $48,927.51. this corresponds to approximately $923.16 per participating practice. this estimate is premised on salaries in effect in the Ottawa area, as well as travel distances for a fairly large urban area. the cost of an emergency room visit due to influenza was approximately CN $76.00 in 1999 or CN $84.00 in 2004 [4,13]. this cost was virtually identical to the costs for an outpatient visit reported in other studies [14,15]. this cost was virtually identical to the costs for an outpatient visit reported in other studies [14,15]. Nichol derived from the Monte Carlo simulation the difference of the hospitalization rate (as well as the outpatient visit rate and the illness rate) for influenza and its complications between unvaccinated and vaccinated subjects. however, the influenza's complications were widely defined in Nichol's paper. threshold value for the efficacy at which the cost savings barely outweigh the costs was 0.83%. the goal would thus be to reduce the probability of infection occurring in FPs' offices by at least 0.83%. the hourly wage rate of one nurse facilitator was $24.55. in the 5-week intervention period, the labour costs for time actually worked amounted to $15,147.35 ($24.55 617 hrs) the total for each row (in the right-most column) indicates the share of the 875 hours that is accounted for by each facilitator. the figure listed beside it indicates the share of the 875 hours that is accounted for by each facilitator. five nurse facilitators $15,147.35 $39,383.11 $157,532.44 $15,147.35 0.5 full-time equivalent project manager $4,831.54 $12,562.00 $50,248.02 $4,831.54 Total training course, experts, test practices $3,883.20* $3,883.20* $10,562.30 Audit Auditors and travel $11,100.00 $28,860.00 $115,440.00 $11,100.00 Supplies Tool kits $7,472.18 $19,4 the variable costs for the 5-week intervention based on the actual 5-week length of the project and the training cost was not amortized. the variable costs that were incurred for this 5-week project amount to $48,927.51, which is the sum of all of the costs listed in the third column of Table 2. approximately 104,033 patients visited the 143 participating physicians over 5 weeks. they obtained the estimated cost of an emergency room visit due to influenza from Jacobs and Hall. this cost was virtually identical to the costs for an outpatient visit reported in other studies. the authors obtained estimates of 'hospitalization rate due to influenza and its complications', 'outpatient visit rate due to influenza and its complications', and 'the influenza illness rate' among healthy working adults aged between 18 and 64 years. the threshold value for the efficacy of the intervention was equal to 0.83%. the goal would thus be to reduce the probability of infection occurring in FPs' offices by at least 0.83%. we did not have enough evidence to evaluate precisely the benefits of the intervention. we undertook a threshold analysis to estimate a threshold value of the efficacy that could render the intervention cost saving. if we assume that there was a 1.00% chance of contracting influenza in FP offices without intervention, the probability of contracting influenza would be 0.17%. as of June 27, 2003, SARS had cost Ontario's health-care system $945 million. this was spent mostly on special supplies and added health-care workers needed to protect health-care workers. this in turn had a huge impact on non-SARS related health care system utilization. Patricia Huston conceived the intervention, provided the data, participated in the study design, assisted with the calculations, and thoroughly revised the manuscript. wei Zhang acquired the economic data, performed the cost evaluation analysis and interpretation, and drafted the first pass of the manuscript."}
