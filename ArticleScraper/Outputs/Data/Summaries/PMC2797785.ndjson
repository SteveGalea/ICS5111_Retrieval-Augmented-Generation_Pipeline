{"summary": "DC-SIGNR polymorphism has been extensively studied on its role in host genetic predisposition to viral infection. the polymorphism has been investigated for genetic predisposition to various infectious diseases, though conflicting results were reported. DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR originated from the duplication of the same ancestral gene. they are located side-by-side within a 26-kb segment of chromosome 19p13.2-3. they share similar functions as cell adhesion receptors and pathogen recognition receptors. the neck region is responsible for the homo-oligomerization that brings the CRDs into proximity for high-affinity ligand binding. however, heterozygous expression of DC-SIGNR of different length in the neck region may lead to reduced ligand-binding affinity and loss of the efficient recognition of multivalent ligands[8,10]. ages of the subjects were authenticated by the official certification of the fifth nation census in china. only subjects with their age supported by both government identity record, local village record and fulfilled the required number of offspring generation were included. this research has been approved by the Ethics Committee on human experimentation of Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and institutions in Dujiangyan. the genotype was determined by separating the PCR products in 3% agarose gel with ethidium bromide. 10% of the samples were re-genotyped by either duplicated genotyping experiments or direct sequencing. a sample of 657 cases and 657 controls chromosomes is required to show an effect caused by an allelic odd ratios of 1.5 at power of 80% at a 2-sided value of 0.05. for most of the prevalent VNTR alleles, our sample has sufficient power to detect an association with allelic odd ratios of 2, except for the allele of 8-repeats. for QC samples and negative control, we blindly pull out a block of 180 male and 180 female samples for genotyping. one additional male sample was used for reaction optimization and his genotype results was also included. 342 healthy younger individuals, including 156 females and 186 males, were also recruited from the same area to serve as a control group. a sample of 657 cases and 657 controls chromosomes is required to show an effect caused by an allelic odd ratio of 1.5 and 2. the sample size (number of chromosomes) required to show an allelic odd ratio of 1.5 and 2 was determined by the program STATCALC (CDC, USA) allele 7 has the highest frequency of 66.6%, followed by allele 5 of 15.5%, allele 9 of 14.15% and allele 6 of 3.62%. the allele 8 was fairly rare in Han Chinese population with a frequency of only 0.13%. the genotype frequencies of peri-centenarian and control population did not deviate from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. arian Controls Genotype (N = 361) (N = 342) P 5/5 9 2.49% 10 2.92% 0.082 5/6 3 0.83% 5 1.46% 0.495 5/7 70 19.39% 73 21.35% 0.574 5/9 15 4.16% 14 4.09% 1.000 6/6 2 0.55% 0 0.00% 0.500 6/7 15 4.16% 15 4.39% 1.000 6/9 3 0.83% 6 1.75% 0.329 7/7 165 2 1.11% 0 0.00% 0.501 0 0.00% 0 0.00% nc 6/7 10 5.56% 2 1.28% 0.041 5 2.76% 13 6.99% 0.089 6/9 2 1.11% 3 1.92% 0.666 1 0.55% 3 1.61% 0.623 7/7 83 46.11% 74 47.44% 0.827 82 45.30% 77 41.40% 0.463 7/8 0 0.0% 1 0.64% 0.4 a total of 11 genotypes and 5 alleles in neck region tandem repeat of DC-SIGNR were investigated in this population. the absence of association between the neck region polymorphism of DC-SIGNR and longevity in Han Chinese population may be caused by various reasons. our results did not imply that the DC-SIGNR polymorphism was associated with longevity in our population. the question of whether the DC-SIGNR could affect longevity remains unknown. authors declare that they have no competing interests. table of sample size required to detect an association caused by alleles at various allelic frequencies. we would like to acknowledge Shi-Fang Wu and Chun-Ling Zhu for their help."}
