{"summary": "innate immune response is first line of defense against virus infections in vertebrates (1, 2). IFNs execute antiviral activity by binding to cognate receptors on the cell surface to activate a signaling cascade leading to induction of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) among the ISGs, those encoding IFN-induced transmembrane proteins are widely expressed and can be induced by all three types of IFNs in many cell types. several groups have reported that IFITMs inhibited entry of HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV into their host cells with varying efficiency (8, 22, 23) the currently favored hypothesis postulates that the existence of IFITM proteins in the endocytic membranes alters either the membrane curvature or fluidity to make the endosomal membrane rigid. an alignment of human IFITM1 (hIFITM1), IFITM2 and IFITM3 protein sequences using vector NTI 8.0 software is shown. five structural domains, i.e., the N-terminal domain (NTD), intramembrane domain (IMD), intracellular loop (CIL), transmembrane domain (TMD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) are indicated. ACE2 is the common receptor for both SARS-CoV and NL63. it provides a unique opportunity to investigate the role of viral receptors in IFITM modulation of HCoV entry. IFITM2 and IFITM3 inhibition of IAVpp infection was 4- and 20-fold more potent in HEK293 cells than in Huh7.5 cells. steady-state levels of IFITM1 were lower than those of IFITM2 and IFITM3 in both HEK293 and Huh7.5 cells. the more potent inhibition by all three IFITMs of infection by NL63pp than by SARSpp suggests that host cellular factors other than viral receptors have FLIP-IN T Rex 293 cells expressing CAT or the indicated IFITM protein were cultured in the presence or absence of Tet for 24 h. they were then infected with 229Epp, NL63pp, SARSpp, MERSpp, IAVpp or LASVpp. y20 can be phosphorylated by the tyrosine kinase Fyn, which regulates IFITM3 trafficking and metabolism. compared to wild-type IFITM3, replacement of Y20 with alanine (A) and aspartic acid (D) or glutamic acid (E) did not alter steady-state levels of expression and activity to enhance the entry of HCoV-OC43. Y20 of IFITM3 plays a critical role in modulating the entry of 229E, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and NL63 in both 293 and Huh7.5 cells. expression of FLAG-tagged IFITM proteins was detected by Western blotting assay using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. -Actin served as a loading control. h7.5-derived cell lines were infected with OC43pp (G), SARSpp and NL63pp (H), 229Epp (I), MERSpp (J), or LASVpp (K) luciferase activities were determined at 48 hpi. Y20 mutation alters IFITM3 subcellular localization. pp infections were efficiently inhibited by NH4Cl treatment in a concentration-dependent manner. the results thus suggest that although Y20 mutant IFITM3 proteins primarily accumulate in the plasma membrane regions, enhanced infection by SARSpp and MERSpp is low pH dependent. Y99A or Y99D mutants had slightly increased activity to enhance OC43pp infection but significantly reduced activity to inhibit infection by SARSpp, NL63pp, IAVpp, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVpp) both Y99A and Y99D IFITM3 enhanced MERSpp infection by approximately 10-fold. oligomerization of IFITM3 is essential for suppressing entry of HCoVs. the function of IFITM proteins is regulated by cysteine palmitoylation (44, 45), ubiquitination (46, 47), and homo- and hetero-oligomerization (24, 29) the mutants were replaced with alanine to yield two mutants. FLIP-IN T Rex 293 cells were cultured in the presence of Tet for 24 h. expression of the IFITM proteins was detected by Western blotting assay. luciferase activities were determined at 48 hpi. terminal 12, 15, or 18 amino acids significantly compromised or abolished the ability of IFITM1 to inhibit infection by SARSpp. deletion of the C-terminal 3, 6, and 9 amino acids increased the activity of IFITM1 to inhibit 229Epp infection. however, further truncation of the CTD gradually attenuated and ultimately abolished the activity of IFITM1 to inhibit 229Epp infection. deletion of the C-terminal 18, but not 18, amino acids significantly increased activity to inhibit NL63pp infection. expression of FLAG-tagged IFITM1 proteins was detected by Western blotting assay using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. the above-mentioned cell lines were infected with HCoV-NL63 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5. the percentages of cells infected by NL63 are expressed as averages standard deviations. results suggest two partially overlapping functional motifs exist in the CTD of IFITM1. IFITM1/TC6 and IFITM1/TC18 primarily accumulate in regions close to or at the plasma membrane. however, modestly increased intracellular localization of both IFITM1 and IFITM1/TC18 is evident. compared to wild-type IFITM1, IFITM1/TC6 but not IFITM1/C18, demonstrated reduced mono- and diubiquitination. 293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing the indicated wild-type (WT) and mutant IFITM1 or IFITM3 proteins. immunoprecipitation was performed by using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. the precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a membrane. FITMs in either HEK293 or Huh7.5 cells did not inhibit infection by lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the envelope proteins of Lassa fever virus (LASVpp) all three IFITMs significantly inhibited the infection by lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the viral envelope proteins of LASVpp. IFITM proteins inhibit infection by pseudoviruses in FLIP-IN T Rex 293 and Huh7.5 cells. expression of FLAG-tagged IFITMs in FLIP-IN T Rex 293 cells was detected by a Western blot assay using a monoclonal antibody against FLAG tag. -Actin served as a loading control. replacement of Y20 in IFITM3 enhances SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV entry. FITM proteins contain conserved CD225 domain flanked by sequence-divergent N- and C-terminal variable regions. mutant IFITM3 proteins showed significantly reduced activity to inhibit NL63pp and 229Epp infection. mutant IFITM3 proteins increased infection by SARSpp and MERSpp. Y20 is critical for endocytic sorting, which is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. infection efficiency is the ratio of the luciferase activity in cells cultured in the presence of Tet over that in cells cultured in the absence of Tet. expression of FLAG-tagged IFITM proteins was detected by Western blotting assay using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. FITM3 proteins is due to the induction of membrane fusion on the plasma membrane, we examined the effect of endosomal pH on HCoVpp infection of Huh7.5 cells expressing wild-type or Y20A IFITM3. among the five tested HCoVpp, MERSpp and NL63pp infections were less sensitive to NH4Cl treatment that elevated endosomal pH. the results thus suggest that although Y20 mutant IFITM3 proteins primarily luciferase activity is the ratio of the luciferase activity in cells treated with NH4Cl over that in the mock-treated cells. y99 was shown by mass spectrometry analysis to be phosphorylated in cells and to play a role in restricting the infectious entry of IAV, but not dengue virus. cells were cultured in the presence of Tet for 24 h to induce IFITM mutant expression. the cells were then infected with HCoV-OC43pp (B), SARSpp or NL63pp (C), 229Epp (D), VSVpp or IAVpp (E), or MERSpp (F) IFITM3 containing F75A and F78A mutations (IFITM3/2FA) completely lost the ability to inhibit infection by SARSpp, 229Epp, MERSpp, and IAVpp. suppression of NL63 spike protein-triggered membrane fusion does not absolutely require the oligomerization of IFITM3. sequential truncation of the C-terminal 18 amino acid residues from IFITM1 did not affect its activity to inhibit infection by IAVpp. deletion of the C-terminal 3, 6, or 9 amino acids did not apparently affect the activity of IFITM1 to inhibit infection by SARSpp. however, further truncation of the C-terminal 12, 15, or 18 amino acids abolished the enhanced inhibitory effect on NL63pp infection. tagged IFITM1 proteins were detected by western blotting assay. cells were left untreated or treated with 1 g/ml of Tet for 24 h. cells were then infected with SARSpp, NL63pp, or MLVpp (B); 229Epp (C); or MERSpp (D) infected cells were transduced with retroviral vectors expressing wild-type IFITM1, IFITM1/TC6, IFITM1/TC18, or an empty vector. expression of FLAG-tagged IFITM1 proteins was detected by Western blotting assay using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. in the CTD of IFITM1, its C-terminal 9 to 12 amino acid residues contain a motif that downregulates antiviral activity against HCoV-NL63. the motif located in the N-terminal 9 amino acid residues of the CTD is important for IFITM1 to suppress SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E entry. 293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing the indicated wild-type and mutant IFITM1 or IFITM3 proteins. the localization of FLAG-tagged IFITM1 (A), IFITM1/TC6 (B) and IFITM1/TC18 (C) was detected by immunofluorescent staining with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (red). cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). IFITM interaction with viral and host cellular factors plays a critical role in IFITM modulation of virus entry. the difference in the potency and the requirement for IFITM oligomerization in inhibition of SARSpp and NL63pp infection strongly suggest that IFITM interaction with viral and host cellular factors plays a critical role. metallopeptidase STE24 forms complexes with IFITM proteins. the sensitivity of IAVs to IFITM3 appears to depend on the pH value at which the viral hemagglutinin (HA) undergoes a conformational transition and mediates membrane fusion (54). FITM3 Y99A mutation does not apparently alter subcellular localization. it compromises antiviral activity of IFITM3 against IAV, but not dengue virus. a small fraction of the mutant IFITM3 might still traffic to the sites where the viral spike protein-induced membrane fusion occurs. FITM3 bearing F75A and F78A mutations completely lost its ability to inhibit infection by SARSpp, 229Epp, and MERSpp. but still partially inhibited NL63pp infection. NL63 appears to be an exception to the CTD of IFITM1. the effects of the CTD on the entry of different viruses imply versatile functions of the CTD. further investigation into the structure, posttranslational modification, and membrane topology of the CTD will shed light on the mechanism by which the CTD regulates the function of IFITM. the human colon cancer cell line HCT-8 was grown in RPMI 1640 medium (ATCC; catalog no. 30-2001) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. FLP-IN T Rex 293 cells were purchased from Invitrogen and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. all the resulting plasmids were cloned into the pQCXIP vector (Clontech) all the resulting plasmids were sequenced to verify the desired mutation(s) the mutants were also cloned into the pQCXIP vector. the modulation of a given pseudotype was determined with a titrated amount of pseudotypes that yielded a luciferase signal between 10,000 and 1,000,000 light units per well of 96-well plates. for a given pseudotype, the input of pseudoviral particles was consistent across all the experiments. total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) qPCR was performed as previously described on a LightCycler 480II (Roche) with a modified forward primer (5\u2032-AAA CCT CGT TGG AAG CGT GTTC-3\u2032) and reverse primer (5\u2032-CTG TGG AAA ACC TTT GGC ATC-3\u2032) cells were stained with a monoclonal antibody recognizing HCoV-NL63 N protein. cells were counterstained with 4\u2032,6-diamidine-2\u2032-phenylindole dihydrochloride. Alexa Fluor 488 was excited at 488 nm, and its fluorescence emission was collected between 560 and 660 nm. negative controls were performed to make sure there were no significant spectral bleedthrough artifacts between channels. es were resolved in a nuPAGE Novex 4 to 12% Bis-Tris gel in morpholineethanesulfonic acid buffer (Invitrogen) the membrane was probed with rabbit polyclonal antibody against FLAG epitope (Sigma; catalog no.
