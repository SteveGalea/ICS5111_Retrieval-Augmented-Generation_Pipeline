{"summary": "the 18-month-old male cat was presented to his referring veterinarian for further investigation of episodic fever, lethargy, and decreased appetite. since 9 mo of age, the cat had been presented to his referring veterinarian for 5 similar episodes over 8 mo. a mild neutropenia without a left shift [2.23 109/L, reference interval (RI): 2.5 to 12.5 109/L], band neutrophils (0.042 109/L, RI: 0 to 0.3 109/L) and lymphopenia (1.47 109/L, RI: 1.5 to 7.0 109/L) tled spleen, hypoechoic left limb of the pancreas with irregular margins. retroperitoneal lymph nodes were not aspirated due to their small size and proximity to the aorta. toxoplasma titers were negative for IgM and 1:16 for IgG. the cat\u2019s temperature was 40.2\u00b0C and a keratic precipitate was noted on the right eye. a CBC was performed (Table 1) and showed a severe neutropenia (0.046 109/L) with mild toxic change. the blood culture bottle was vented and incubated at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere supplemented with 5% carbon dioxide. each subculture yielded no growth. the patient was anesthetized and arthrocentesis was performed on the left carpus and right stifle. EDTA-anticoagulated blood was submitted to the University of Tennessee Immunology Laboratory. the cells did not require fixation due to overnight shipping and immediate processing upon receipt. no neutrophil surface antibodies were detected in this patient. the patient was discharged on prednisolone (PrednisTab; Lloyd, Shenandoah, Iowa, USA), 1.1 mg/kg BW, PO, q12h, and cyclosporine (Atopica); 5.6 mg/kg BW, PO, q24h for suspected immune-mediated neutropenia; oral doxycycline (Vibramycin; Pfizer); 4.5 mg/kg BW, PO, q12 the cat\u2019s automated neutrophil count was zero the day of initiating immune suppressive therapy. a CBC was not evaluated prior to filgrastim administration. two days later, a CBC revealed a neutrophilia (15.9 109/L, RI: 2.5 to 12.5 109/L), band neutrophils (0.230 109/L, RI: 0 to 0.3 109/L) and a monocytosis. the patient was diagnosed with herpes keratitis and was prescribed idoxuridine (compounded ophthalmic drop), one drop, OD, q6h, ofloxacin (Ocuflox; Allergan, Irvine, California, USA), one drop, OD, q8h and sodium chloride ophthalmic ointment. the cat is clinically normal 24 mo after initial diagnosis. neutropenia is well-characterized and is caused by antibodies directed toward neutrophil surface antigens. the disease most commonly affects infants, with 95% of cases resolving by age 3 (9,10) neutropenia was not included in the initial differential diagnoses because of the mild degree of neutropenia and a lack of steroid administration in the 7 mo prior to presentation. hypoplasia can be seen if autoantibodies are directed at bone marrow precursors (3,10) the globulin level decreased substantially after 1 wk of clindamycin therapy. it is suspected a secondary bacterial infection contributed to the cat\u2019s malaise prior to the first referral visit. it is unclear whether the single dose of filgrastim contributed to the increased neutrophil count."}
